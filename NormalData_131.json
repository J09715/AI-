["Q: Problems Downloading Server 12.10 I've been trying to download the ISO for Server 12.10 amd64 for a week now.  None of the MD5 checksums match the posted values.  I am not having any problems downloading from other sites, and I've tried the download from multiple computers.\n\nA: The MD5sum of the server file is 4bd3270bde86d7e4e017e3847a4af485 *ubuntu-12.10-server-amd64.iso and the .ISO is found here http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.10/ubuntu-12.10-server-amd64.iso\naccording to http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.10/\n\nA: Try torrenting the files from the .torrent files on the site.  The BitTorrent protocol has built in file checking, so your likelihood of a corrupted download is much lower - plus, file download speeds will most likely be faster!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 cannot connect to wireless network (wireless card unspecified) I have just recently installed 12.04 and I can't seem to get it to hook up to my wireless network. I tried plugging it in directly and it worked. Any suggestions?\n\nA: Wireless support can be dependent on your wireless chip.  I would recommend using lspci (terminal command) to find your wireless chipset and then google around using that information to see if others have theirs working.  good luck!\n\nA: A lot. \n\n\n*\n\n*Is your Wi-Fi supported by Ubuntu? Not all are.\n\n*Is the device turned on?\n\n*Is the device blocked? Hardware or software alike can block Wi-Fi.\n\n*Drivers work as they should?\n\n*No drivers conflict / shadowing?\n\n*Are you within reach for your Wi-Fi? Some signals can be blocked surprisingly easy.\n\n*Is your router ready to work with new device? Some older models may require restarting to \"pick\" up new kid on the block.\n\n\nThere is more, so perhaps you could extend the question with information what have you tried so far and how it went?\nFor starters, when I had WiFi troubles I looked here:\nUbuntu 10.04 Wireless Troubleshooting\nDon't worry that it's for 10.04, identifying devices, commands and other links found there should be a good reference anyway. \nMore info can be found in community docs\n\nA: It's supported and on...as I said, it sees the network...every time I click on \"additional drivers\" it crashes and shows an error report.  The adapter is 18 inches from the modem; shouldn't be a problem. It already sees it.\nThe adapter finds my home network and a hidden one (which must be a neighbor's), but every time I click on the home network the window remains blank.\nSince the driver thing keeps crashing and it won't read the CD, I'm guessing that's the problem, but I'm new to Ubuntu, so I wondered if there might be something else.\n", "Q: Cannot install Ubuntu due to a \"problem mounting the file\" error I downloaded ubuntu 12.10 iso image; but when i click on it, I get a 'Sorry, there was a problem mounting file' error message.\nThe same thing happens after I downloaded the 12.4 LTS version too.\nI am on Windows 8.\nThank you\n\nA: I had no trouble mounting the ISO file on Windows 8 simply by double-clicking on the filename.  This automatically mounts the ISO file to a virtual DVD drive and assigns a drive letter.  Perhaps your ISO downloads are corrupted in some way.  I am assuming that mounting ISO files in this way is working for you on other ISO files.\n\nA: I had the same issue. I presume you are trying to mount the file for a bootable USB. Understand that this is a bootable ISO image that you downloaded and therefore Windows might have problems mounting the file. I have 7Zip (or you can even use WINRAR) which I used to 'Open Archive' and then used \"Extract\" to extract it to a folder. From there I wrote it to a USB.\n", "Q: unity launcher recovery I recently added cairo-dock which worked fine until I added a 2nd dock at the top left of the screen.  Since then, my computer has consistently reported system errors.  How do I get the unity launcher back?  I've have clicked \"remove\" for the cairo dock in the software section; it tells me it is removed, but yet it remains.  Feels a bit like \"Hal\" from 2001.  Any suggestions?\n\nA: If the software has indeed been removed then \"log out\" and back in. This should start a new session. If then you don't have the \"Unity\" ......Ctrl+Alt+F2 then log in and type this unity --replace  now Ctrl+Alt+F7 and return to your desktop.\n", "Q: ralink rt2860 not working anymore in ubuntu 12.10 I just upgraded from Ubuntu 12.04 to 12.10, however, my network card is not working anymore. When I had 12.04 installed, I just had to download the driver from Ralink, go to the directory and enter:\nmake\nsudo make install\nThis made my network card work.  When I try to do this in 12.10, it seems like it works, but it doesn't. I can enable the module, it recognizes the network card, but I am unable to connect to any wireless network.\nHow can I get my wireless card working again?\nIf anyone knows a solution, please tell me.  Thanks in advance.\n\nA: The open source rt2800pci module should work with your card for all the 12.x+ releases.  Deinstall the vendor's rt2860sta module (or whatever it's called), check that no \"blacklist rt2800pci\" line is present in any file in /etc/modules.d, and you should have a working wireless.  The rt2800pci module is present in the default installation, and is even present on the live media.  Wireless should work out of the box for you.\n", "Q: install extra compiz plugins (burn) and (groups & tabs) How to install these plugins in ubuntu 12.10 ?\nI watched some videos for installation and using them ,but I didnt find any thing  !\nhelp please \n\nA: You will need to install the compizconfig-settings-manager, compiz-plugins-extra, and of coarse compiz. All available in the repository through the software center or synaptic. Once installed you can select the \"extras\" that you want enabled. Watch the tutorial here\nBTW when you install compiz it will pull in a lot of extra packages. Just let it. You will need them to run.\n*since the first half of my answer isn't working for you I will edit this to include another option *\nRemove the two .HIDDEN files in your ~/HOME directory, .compiz-1 and .compiz then log out or reboot. To verify that these are indeed the correct files....open your file manager> in your ~/HOME directory> Ctrl+h which will show your hidden files. You may have the option to rename them or make a backup by opening a terminal and use this CLI: \nsudo mv ~/.compiz-1 ~/.compiz-1_old \nand \nsudo mv ~/.compiz ~/.compiz_old\nREBOOT\n\nA: In ubuntu 12.10 with mate i was able to get a few of the extras to work. Downloaded the addons script from gnome-looks. Right now im working on figuring out what exactally needs to be changed for this to work on 12.10 gnome fallback session. As of now I can compile the addons fine but get ld -ign errors when installing. After the script runs i can see Freely transformable windows, wizard and Anaglyph in ccsm but once i enable them ccsm kills itself. \n", "Q: multiple users same desktop I have my desktop set up how I like it for my admin (root) user (Cinnamon)\nI want to create a non-admin account, but keep the same desktop setup as the root.\nHow to do this? \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I'm assuming you mean the account with sudo access when you say root. \nIts pretty simple where you want to copy userone's account to usertwo - create a new account (usertwo), copy over the contents of /home/userone to /home/usertwo (with sudo cp, to handle permissions issues), then sudo chown -R  usertwo /home/usertwo to give ownership of the directory to the new user.\nIf you want all users to have the same initial account setup, I believe setting /etc/skel appropriately will do the trick\n", "Q: Gameboy Advance emulator for Lucid?

The dd command is commonly used to make image backups of a drive or partition. However, it performs poorly if the source drive is unreliable or failing. I read that ddrescue/dd_rescue is a good tool to use to recover an image from a bad drive, since it intelligently attempts to re-read sectors that it failed to read the first time.\nBut in the Ubuntu repositories, I see two different ddrescue programs, with 3 different but similar names showing up in different places: ddrescue, gddrescue, dd_rescue. What's the difference?\n\nA: ddrescue, confusingly, can refer to two completely separate programs, dd_rescue by Kurt Garloff, and GNU ddrescue. Both have the same purpose and are actively developed.\nGarloff's program dd_rescue is the first attempt to improve on dd; GNU ddrescue is newer and was created to address shortcomings in dd_rescue.\nSeveral sources prefer GNU ddrescue over dd_rescue. For example,\n\n\n*\n\n*http://lwn.net/Articles/430000/\n\nddrescue wins (in my book) because it is an efficient self-contained program written in C++ (not a shell script kludge), produces much cleaner output on the console/terminal, and (most importantly) handles unreadable blocks gracefully and intelligently.\n\n\n*http://www.toad.com/gnu/sysadmin/index.html#ddrescue\n\nGNU ddrescue is your best friend.\nIt is modeled after the two preceding programs, dd_rescue (with an underbar), and dd_rhelp. But GNU ddrescue it's far better than both -- I've tried all three, on the same drive, as well as trying to use plain old \"dd\".\nAntonio Diaz Diaz's GNU ddrescue learned from these experiences. It combines both dd_rescue's ability to read big blocks and then shift gears, with dd_rhelp's ability to remember what parts of the disk have been looked at already. It keeps this info in a really simple logfile format, and keeps it updated every 30 seconds, or whenever it stops or is interrupted. It's written in C++ and it's small and fast.\n\nOne advantage of GNU ddrescue is that it backs up most data faster, by first skipping bad blocks (hich are slow to recover) and coming back to them only after good blocks have been backed up. One disadvantage of GNU ddrescue is that it doesn't support piped output, which means you can't compress the output image with gzip or lzop.\nUbuntu packages\nUnfortunately, the package names in the Ubuntu repositories are confusing; dd_rescue is packaged under the name ddrescue, and ddrescue under gddrescue! From the package summaries:\n\n\n*\n\n*gddrescue package:\n\nPlease note that this is the GNU ddrescue version providing\n  the /sbin/ddrescue executable. If you are searching for the\n  ddrescue version of Kurt Garloff please check out the\n  ddrescue package instead.\n\n\n*ddrescue package:\n\nPlease note that this is the dd_rescue version of Kurt Garloff\n  providing the /bin/dd_rescue executable. If you are searching\n  for the GNU ddrescue version please check out the gddrescue\n  package instead.\n\nSummary of names:\nProgram name     Ubuntu package name     Executable name    Name in URL\nGNU ddrescue     gddrescue               ddrescue           ddrescue\ndd_rescue        ddrescue                dd_rescue          ddrescue\n\n", "Q: Can't connect (ssh, ftp,... timeout) to one computer on LAN (ping possible) Since I've had a laptop (A), I've been trying to connect it with my Desktop PC (B) via router in a LAN, problem is (B) won't even answer any request aside from a ping. I've tried ssh, ftp, vnc, samba, vpn and in each case, (A) won't be able to reach (B) but (B) is able to reach (A)'s severs just fine. I've also tested this with an android device (C) and again (B)=>(C) but (C)=/=>(B).\nA note on samba, I don't know if it's supposed to be a stable protocol but it's kind of the exception, it doesn't always connect (B) to (A) either. Another thing is sometimes samba via nautilus sees there is a (B) machine but is always unable to mount it...\nI've tried a test of another post on the subject: booting (B) via a Live CD. There everything works, from ftp to ssh and samba or vnc.\nSo I followed another of his advices and tried to figure out if I (B) has a firewall. So far nothing seems to indicate it since by default there's none, I don't remember installing any and I checked my installed software for one.\nMy questions would be:\n1. how can I be sure I don't have a firewall or any other type block, I can give you other details like iptables --list output (no idea what that is though).\n2. If you don't think it's that, what in hell could it be, I used to fault the ethernet of my MB but now I know it's the drivers at most. Looks to be software now and that gives me hope again.\nI'll be checking this post to give you anything you need to answer. Thanks for your help.\n\nA: The first thing to do is ensure that all of these services are running. I'm pretty familiar with debugging SSH so I'll use this as an example; but the same would apply to any protocol.\n1 - check the service is running. It's obvious, but sometimes things don't start, for whatever reason. Run sudo service ssh start to ensure the service is running.\n2 - check there's no firewall active (or that SSH access is allowed). If you're running on a desktop installation there's no firewall installed by default (as Ubuntu doesn't ship with any network-listening services enabled by default), but if there is (or if you're using ubuntu server), check the status of the firewall by using sudo ufw status (viewing the status of the firewall needs root access).\n3 - see what another machine sees. Use a portscanning utility, such as nmap to make sure that the services are running and listening. nmap [IP address] will portscan the given IP and tell you what services are running. Note - you should run this from another machine to be sure that you're seeing what's actually accessible.\nFrom this you'll be able to figure out where the trouble is being caused.\n", "Q: IP being masked, mysteriously I'm running Ubuntu with Cinnamon. When checking my IP I noticed it is being masked. I have done nothing to set this, other than installing Tor. But - I am not starting up Tor, yet is it still running somehow, even from a reboot where I did not start Tor.\nLooking at my system with Firestarter I see Tor is running.\nHow could Tor (or some aspects of it) be running on it's own? How can I shut it off? I see no mention of Tor under system processes that are running.\n\nA: I assume you have Tor either from Ubuntu archives or from the Tor archives installed. They install Tor as a daemon. This means the software is started automatically on every boot. You'll find a start script in /etc/init.d/tor.\nYou basically have two options to shut it off:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall Tor\n\n*Remove Tor from the startup\n\n\nFor the second case you can use bum, the bootup manager. Maybe this is not installed. So you have to install it first. Then you open bum as root and look for the entry tor. Make a right-click and select Deactivate & apply now:\n\nNow Tor will not start automatically, but only when you want it to start.\n\nA: Are you sure that the IP is going through a proxy like Tor and you're not just confusing your internal and external IP addresses? Try making sure that Tor isn't listed as a startup program, and check this site from the Tor project to be sure that it is Tor that's running https://check.torproject.org\n", "Q: When I extract an application that I have downloaded, where should I be extracting them to? What do I type into the terminal to tell it where to go? I don't really understand how to move files using the terminal.\n\nA: \nThe question is where to extract application files, so I'd\n  recommend to extract it to a temporary folder inside /home\n  directory and then copy it into a permanent location in the file\n  system.\n\nFor deb files\nMethod 1: using dpkg\ndeb is the extension of the Debian software package format and the most often used name for such binary packages. \ndpkg is the package manager for Debian. So using dpkg command you can list and extract deb packages.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use dpkg -c to list the contents of a deb package:\n$ dpkg -c <file-name>.deb \n\n\n*Use dpkg -x to extract the files from a deb package:\n$ dpkg -x <file-name>.deb </path/to/temp-dir>\n\n\nMethod 2: using ar\nDebian packages are standard Unix ar archives that include two tar archives optionally compressed with gzip (zlib), Bzip2, lzma, or xz (lzma2): one archive holds the control information and another contains the program data.\nTherefore .deb files always contains three files — debian-binary, control.tar.gz, and data.tar.gz.\nUse ar and tar command to extract and view the files from the deb package.\n\n\n*\n\n*To extract the contents of .deb archive to your /home directory:\n$ ar -vx <file-name>.deb\nx - debian-binary\nx - control.tar.gz\nx - data.tar.gz\n\n\n*To extract the contents of data.tar.gz file:\n$ tar -xvzf data.tar.gz </path/to/temp-dir>\n\n\n*To extract the files into the root directory tree, which should place everything where it should go, you can:\n$ tar -xvzf data.tar.gz /\n\nNote: \ndeb files should be installed with dpkg, so to install the package, do:\nsudo dpkg -i <file-name>.deb\n\nIf the deb file(s) are in another directory inside your /home directory, you can install it by:\ncd <directory>\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\n\nFor Tar files\nTAR(tape archive) is a file format (in the form of a type of archive bitstream) for archiving files.\n\n\n*\n\n*To extract a tar file:\ntar -xvf file.tar\n\n\n*To extract a .tar.gz (gzip) file, (note -z option):\ntar -xzvf file.tar.gz\n\n\n*To extract .tar.bz2 (bzip2) file, (note -j option):\ntar -xjvf file.tar.bz2\n\nBy default files will be extracted into the current directory. To change the directory use -C option.\nFor example, to extract to /home/data:\ntar -zxvf data.tar.gz -C /home/data\n\n\n\n*\n\n*To view a detailed table of contents (list all files) for this archive:\ntar -tzvf data.tar.gz\n\n\nUsing a GUI tool: Archive Manager\nYou can use the Archive Manager GUI application to create, view, modify, or extract an archive.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the Super key to Open the Dash and type Archive Manager. This will launch the Archive Manager window.\n\n\n*Click on Open and browse for the tar or deb file.\n\n*Click on Extract and select the directory to where you want to extract the file.\n\n\nA: It depends what the application is. If it's a .deb file, you can say:\nsudo dpkg -i filename.deb\n\nIf it's a .tar.gz file, you can say:\ntar zvxf filename.tar.gz\ncd directory-name\nmake\nmake install\n# (or ./install or similar)\n\n\nA: Not to minimize other excellent answers, I wanted to provide a very simple answer.\nIf the file ends with .tar.gz (or .tgz), move the file to the directory to which you want to extract it and cd to that directory. Then:\ntar xzvf filename.tar.gz\n\nIf the filename ends with .tar.bz2 or .tbz, then change the z in the above command to a j.\nWhich directory?\nAny directory you like. I normally use /tmp because everything there is automatically deleted on reboot. If the program is designed to be run directly after extracting it without running an installer, then the traditional location would be ~/bin.\n", "Q: after uninstalling ubuntu the boot entry is still there I had an error during the install of ubuntu so when I uninstalled it, the boot entry was still there. I wish to attempt a reinstall, but this is not working, and I think the boot entry is the problem. I was installing Ubuntu 12.10, if that is of any importance.\nI had installed it on a windows 7 system.\n\nA: If the grub menu is the issue, you'll have to do some careful editing to get it to work. I am not sure what your exact setup is, but I'll assume that you want to reinstall ubuntu on the same drive or partition that the old uninstalled setup was on. I am fairly sure there is an option to reinstall or upgrade ubuntu, or at last resort format the driver/partition and then install, under the custom install option when you boot from the external installation device. Also remember to hit a key like F11 (varies by computer) to choose which boot medium you use when your computer is initially turning on to actually reach the installation process.\nEdit: If you just want to remove the grub entry, just do a quick search and find something like http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/clean-up-ubuntu-grub-boot-menu-after-upgrades/\n", "Q: Display artifacts under Ubuntu 12.10 I am getting some display artifacts under a fresh install of 12.10.\n(Open image in an another tab to get the full effect)\n\nAnyone have any idea what might be going on here or a possible solution?\nMy first assumption was display driver, but I've been have some difficulties getting the Nvidia binary driver to work. So I wanted to check for other possible solutions before I spend a lot of time messing with getting that to work. \n\nA: The artifact occurs when the video feed to the device isn't in sync with the display's refresh.

Now I want to enable that kind of feature in Ubuntu 12.04.\nHow can I achieve this?\n\nA: \nAccording to the Ubuntu ManPage Repository, pklocalauthority - PolicyKit Local Authority makes a distinction between user authentication (to make the user in front of the system prove he really is the user) and administrator authentication (to make the user in front of the system prove he really is an administrator)\n\nTherefore you can use this policykit to provide administration authentication for mounting all (internal and external) devices. \nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal(CTRL+ALT+T) and type:\ngksu gedit /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/10-vendor.d/com.ubuntu.desktop.pkla\n\n\n*In line 4, look for ResultActive=yes and change it to:\nResultActive=auth_admin_keep \n\n\n*Save and Close the file.\nUbuntu will now require a password when mounting all drives (internal and external drives).\n\nFor specific partitions:\nIn 10.04 and newer versions, mounting all devices (internal and external) are allowed without asking for password unless it was defined in the filesystem table (fstab) file. \nTherefore, to make Ubuntu prompt users for sudo password when mounting specific partitions, you need to edit your fstab file. \nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and type:\ngksu gedit /etc/fstab\n\n\n*At the last line, add the UUID of your partition with the defaults option. \nYou can find out the UUIDs of partitions by running blkid in the terminal.\nFor example:\n$ sudo blkid\n/dev/sda1: UUID=\"5474ce02-5c07-4002-a0e7-10c8bc5dba2c\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda2: LABEL=\"windows\" UUID=\"7355DDFB0563F31F\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda5: LABEL=\"data\" UUID=\"7e3fbc57-03fe-4742-bb72-756f31852059\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda6: LABEL=\"films\" UUID=\"a319fb28-3061-404f-abbc-6519cf81c6c9\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda7: LABEL=\"tv\" UUID=\"5D10E5D66886BCCF\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sda8: UUID=\"12d16683-5530-454e-809b-1a30ed47a8c9\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n\nNow that you know the UUID, you can add it to the fstab file. But first, you need to create a mountpoint where the partition will be mounted. \nYou can do that by running:\nsudo mkdir /path/to/dir/name-dir\n\nIn my example, I want to mount the partition under /media/data:\nsudo mkdir /media/data\n\nNow, I can simply add the line below to make sure that Ubuntu prompts for a password when the \"data\" partition is mounted:\nUUID=7e3fbc57-03fe-4742-bb72-756f31852059 /media/data   ext4 defaults 0 0\n\n\n*Save and Close the file.\nNote: \nThe defaults option uses the default options that are rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, and async.\nThe user allows normal users to mount the device, whereas nouser lets only the root to mount the device. \nFor detailed information, visit How to edit and understand /etc/fstab.    \n\nA: The easy answer is to edit the policy file with one of the commands below:\ngksu gedit /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/10-vendor.d/com.ubuntu.desktop.pkla\n\nor\nsudo -H gedit /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/10-vendor.d/com.ubuntu.desktop.pkla\n\nAnd add # at the start of line 2 \nIdentity=unix-group:admin;unix-group:sudo\n\nchanging it to\n#Identity=unix-group:admin;unix-group:sudo\n\nSince the system will no longer identify mount requests as admin or sudo requests it will require the password for mount requests not listed as user mountable in /etc/fstab.\n\nA: To ask password when you also mount USB drives (above answer by @Peachy works only for internal drives),\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal (Shortcut = Ctrl+Alt+T).\n\n\n*Type\nsudo gedit /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/10-vendor.d/com.ubuntu.desktop.pkla\n\n\n\n*Add org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-*; to Line 3.\n\n\n*Change line 4, ResultActive=yes to ResultActive=auth_admin.\n\n\n*After edits Lines 1 -4 will look like :\n[Mounting, checking, etc. of internal drives]\nIdentity=unix-group:admin;unix-group:sudo\nAction=org.freedesktop.udisks.filesystem-*;org.freedesktop.udisks.drive-ata-smart*;org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-mount-system;org.freedesktop.udisks2.encrypted-unlock-system;org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-fstab;org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-*;\nResultActive=auth_admin\n\n\n\n*Save and Close file.\nNow Ubuntu will ask password each time before mounting usb-drives.\nThis worked for me in Ubuntu 20.04.\n", "Q: Systems Not Booting after Ubuntu installation \nPossible Duplicate:\nFailure to Boot Windows 7 after Ubuntu install \n\nI recently installed Ubuntu on my PC dual-booted with Windows 7.

Done\nE: Unable to locate package libjpeg\nE: Unable to locate package libjpeg-devel\n\nIs there an easy way to get those libraries installed ? I am using Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: If you decide to build ImageMagick from source, you need to be prepared to manually resolve all dependencies. Unless you have a pressing need, you should install all software on Ubuntu from a repository -- either the official repos or a PPA.\nIf you install Imagemagick using APT (apt-get, Synaptic, Software Center, etc.), then JPG files will work just fine, as I confirmed on my machine.\nIf your reason for building from source is to get a more recent version, hunt for a PPA that tracks the most recent version. If you're building from source in order to help with development, then you should find out from the Imagemagick folks just what is required to succesfully build it from source. It might be that you need to specify some flag to ./configure or have some development library installed before running ./configure.\nBut normally, building from source just needlessly complicates things.\nOh, by the way, Red Hat and Ubuntu use different names for packages. So if yum complains about a missing package, it shouldn't be surprising if apt-get can't find a package by that name. You shouldn't mix package managers on a system unless you have a really good reason to do so. Even then, try every other option first.\n\nA: Note that the no decode delegate error can (quite confusingly) result from imagemagick (or some part of it) not finding the file. So before running to reinstall imagemagick, check with identify -list format and convert -list configure whether the JPEG format is supported, and if it is, the problem will probably be somewhere else.\nFor example, convert -resize 50% foo\\ bar.jpg gave me a no decode delegate for this image format eror, but convert -resize 50% 'foo bar.jpg' worked perfectly.\n\nA: I fixed the problem by installing from source the jpeg encoding library available at http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v8c.tar.gz.\ncd /usr/local/src\ntar xvfz jpeg-8c.tar.gz\ncd jpeg-8c\n./configure --enable-shared --prefix=$CONFIGURE_PREFIX\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nThen I re-installed ImageMagick from source:\ncd /usr/local/src\ntar xvfz ImageMagick-6.6.9-5.tar.gz\ncd ImageMagick-6.6.9-5\nexport CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include\nexport LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib\n./configure --prefix=/usr/local --disable-static --with-modules --without-perl --without-magick-plus-plus --with-quantum-depth=8 --disable-openmp\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nNow its working, I've tested it like this:\nsam@ubuntu:~/RubymineProjects/project/tmp$ identify 1.jpg\n1.jpg JPEG 128x106 128x106+0+0 8-bit sRGB 2.22KB 0.000u 0:00.000\n\n\nA: If you have just installed php5-imagick, try also installing the full imagemagick package. This will install all required libraries, such as the jpeg one.\nsudo apt-get install imagemagick\nThen restart your webserver to reload al libraries:\nsudo service apache2 restart\nJPEG decoding should now work without error.\n\nA: have you tried :\nsudo apt-get install libjpeg62\nif the above command doesn't work, please go through following link.\nhttp://psx-scene.com/forums/f150/help-install-libjpeg-libpng-ubuntu-9-10-livecd-64122/\nLet em know, if this was helpful, good luck... :)\n\nA: | Easiest way | \nDownload \"Synaptic Package Manager\" from Software center. --> removed older libjpeg packages* --> reinstalled libjpeg8 & libjpeg-turbo8 & libjpeg-turbo8-dev.\nPS:\nI was getting same error. It took me 2 days to get solved. My error when I was trying to display jpg image:\nno decode delegate for this image format `jpeg' @ error/constitute.c/readimage/504\n\nThen, I download \"Synaptic Package Manager\" from Software center. --> removed older libjpeg packages* --> reinstalled libjpeg8 & libjpeg-turbo8 & libjpeg-turbo8-dev.\n(*synaptics package manager will show dependency with other package, remove only older independent libjpeg packages)\nAfter that I am able to open JPEG images without any fear of error.\nHope it helps :)\n\nA: That error message also appears if you have SPACES in file's names, as imagick and its toolset can't process those correctly on Linux.\nSo before processing the files with imagemagick, mogrify, or identify, or any of the tools that come with imagemagick, do a\nsudo find ./ -depth -name \"* *\" -execdir rename -v 's/ /_/g' \"{}\" \\;\n\nto replace all spaces in file names with underscores;\nI hope this will help someone\n\nA: I resolved it by installing ImageMagick rpm using dnf command.

Then I opened the pdf in windows for printing purposes. Many of the lines and curves I made in Inkscape were missing. \nThen I tried the same graphics in coreldraw. Converted it to pdf. Then I opened the file in Ubuntu. All lines and curves were there.\nI want to use Ubuntu for all my work. But this problem makes it difficult for me as I have to take the pdf to a printer who works only with Windows.\n\nA: Rest assured that you absolutely can use Inkscape in a professional graphics workflow - now to fix your issues...\nThere are a load of potential explanations for your observations. Can you upload the .svg file so we can take a look?\nMartin is right to question what pdf viewer you're using. I've had files rendered with glitches by Evince but the files have viewed and printed fine elsewhere.\nA top reason would be the stroke style for the affected lines - are they dashed or using end markers? I've had issues with these not outputting reliably in the past.\nI'd also try opening the .svg file in Scribus and outputting to pdf from there.  You've got more output settings, can handle bleed and add printers' marks etc.  Scribus opens svg files natively or you can 'Import Vector' into an existing Scribus document.\nThis is the version of Scribus I use to produce my print-ready artwork:\n\nor command line:\nsudo apt-get install scribus-ng\n\n\nA: I had the same issue with some objects that had a blank stroke style. Removing their stroke completely made them appear again in the output PDF when viewed with Evince. \n\nA: None of this solved the issue for me (removing all strokes, using union). Half of my resume (a pdf generated from svg file with inskape) is disappearing when zooming over 150% with Evince. Only some part of the text appears and rasterized images disappears, there must be some underlying logic to this bug but I can't find it.\nScribus is unable to open my svg correctly, most of the file is missing.\nHowever, I managed to get a working file by opening the svg in Gravit Designer and exporting it to a 300dpi pdf. Gravit does not like images in svg that much so I had to tweak them a little after the svg import. It is a workaround but at least it works, the pdf file is even light (400ko against 800ko with inkscape). \n\nA: When you go to print:\nFile - Print - (NOTICE THE RENDERING TAB AT TOP OF PRINT WINDOW)\nRendering - Select BITMAP\nThis works for me when some objects do not print - for example, clipped bitmaps.\n", "Q: Bootable USB drive won't run installation I am having issues installing 12.10 on a laptop from bootable USB Drive 4GB FAT32.\nAlso I changed order on BIOS to boot from USB.\nBut only I see is the black screen with\nSYSLINUX 4.06 EDD 4.06-pre7 Copyright (C) 1994-2012 H.

I've an Asus netbook with this graphics card. The problem is that I cannot set screen resolution to 1024x600. The only available resolution, 800x600, looks very bad.\nI've read some answers to this problem in this forum, but all them are using Ubuntu 12.04. The only possibility to get my graphics card working with suitable drivers is to update my system to 12.04?\n\nA: CedarView driver is only available for Ubuntu 12.04.\nIt's also worth mentioning that 11.04 has reached End of Life last month (Oct 2012). Thus, I'd recommend installing 12.04 both for the driver and for support.\n\nA: FWIW, the graphics requirements for 12.10 (no 2d unity?) are beyond the capabilities of the driver (or the hardware/driver combination) so actually 12.04 is the only version which will work nicely.\n", "Q: System locks up, but accessible by SSH I have been running a Python script for extended amounts of time that relies on the pyCUDA module.  \nOn two occasions, the desktop has become locked up and totally unresponsive, except, oddly, through SSH.  Logging in remotely shows that the Python script is no longer running when the system is (locally) locked up.  Because this Python script runs for a long time, I haven't been around to see when exactly it locks up.  It has never locked up without the script having run.\nRunning 12.04 with a GeForce 460 GPU.  The Python script doesn't make one CUDA call that lasts for over an hour, but hundreds that last for less than 30 seconds, so I don't think the GPU is locking up the system.  Thanks for any ideas.\n\nA: You mentioned that when you log in via SSH, the script is no longer running. Is it because it terminated or crashed?\nYou can also run your script with strace. This way you can capture every system call it makes, especially what it does when it terminates/crashes.\nstrace -f /path/script.py -o /tmp/output.log\n\nIt will produce a rather large file, so make sure you have enough free space.\n\nA: A few ideas and debugging hints:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you log in via SSH, is the system idle or is a process hanging with heavy load?\n\n*What does \"totally unresponsive\" mean?

But then I couldn't click on 'new' and failed to create a partition.\nHow can my problem be solved?\n\nA: Windows will refuse to see and change any Linux partitions on your drive. It is therefore recommended to change the partitions from a live Ubuntu session as was further elaborated in this answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why I'm seeing a lock besides the partition I'm trying to modify with gparted?\n\nPlease do take the time to backup your data before you change partitions or install another OS.\n\nFor installing another OS (e.g. Windows) it is best practise to leave an unpartitioned space on the drive and let the installer partition and format it. Note that you cant have more than 4 primary partitions.\nAfter having installed Windows you will have to repair Grub to be able to boot Ubuntu again:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I repair grub? (How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?)\n\nA: Windows overwrites the original boot loader (GRUB). You need that boot-loader to select which OS to go to. To install the boot loader again, enter to the installation process from your thumbdrive ( you can boot ubuntu from your thumbdrive easily, Google it to find out more). \n1) Installation (CUSTOM)\n2) create a \"SWAP AREA\" partition of 500 MB, from the beginning (logical).\nClick continue, it should install a fresh copy of the data.

How to make grub rescue go away? I had a Windows 7/Ubuntu 12 dual boot and I decided to clean install Windows 8 over them. \nThe problem is that after I deleted all partitions and installed windows I was getting an \"Operation system not found\", however after an \"enter\" the system will normally boot into Windows 8.\nI realized that Windows did their trick and put the system (not partition anymore?!?) \"tag\" (Disk Management) on my media hard drive.\nAfter trying to fix the boot/mbr to be able to boot from my main drive the \"Operation system not found\" changed to the \"grub rescue>\" prompt. I know that I cannot use that because I have killed the grub files. Windows can still boot as long as I choose to boot from the media drive.\nThe question is, is there any way to move the \"system\", whatever it is now, to the main drive and have the PC boot from there, while making grub disappear?\nAnd if that is possible after that, can I just make the Media drive inactive or I will have to somehow remove the \"system\" tag?\n\nA: If you have your Windows 8 disc, you can get to the recovery options and access a command prompt by inserting the disc and booting from it. Refer to your motherboard manual for steps to change the boot order of your hardware from within the BIOS so your CD/DVD drive boots first.\nOnce you have chosen to repair Windows with your installation disc, open a command prompt and type the following commands:\n\nbcdedit /export C:\\BCD_Backup\nC:\ncd boot\nattrib bcd -s -h -r\nren C:\\boot\\bcd bcd.old\nbootrec /RebuildBcd\n\nAnother Method\n\nIf that does not work, try these in this order:\nbcdedit /export C:\\BCD_Backup\nC:\ncd boot\nattrib bcd -s -h -r\nren C:\\boot\\bcd bcd.old\nbootrec /FixMbr\nbootrec /FixBoot\nbootrec /RebuildBcd\n\nI have had success myself with these steps in the same situation.

Ideally the delay caused by the network would occur once the command is entered/sent rather than each key input.\n\nA: I believe the delay needs to be there. The terminal cannot guess if you are typing or there's some other event to be run on particular keypress. So after each key (or key combination) pressed your terminal needs to wait for the effect from the server. Which usually is adding a letter/character to the prompt.\nYou can press multiple keys in sequence without waiting for the answer, but you have to wait for the answer before the effect of typing would be visible.\n", "Q: Read only file system I'm running Ubuntu 12.10, Upon opening any shell I get the following error:\n/home/jack/.rbenv/libexec/rbenv-init: line 87: cannot create temp file for here-document: Read-only file system\n\nI realised this wasn't simply a rbenv issue, as any file I try to write to returns an error saying the system is Read-only.\nI don't know how else to describe my problem, each time I boot up the system goes through a disk check, where it supposedly fixes several errors in my disk.\nHere is my /etc/fstab\n# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>\nproc            /proc           proc    nodev,noexec,nosuid 0       0\n# / was on /dev/sda1 during installation\nUUID=1cc4b2ab-a984-4516-ac25-6d64f5050244 /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n# swap was on /dev/sda5 during installation\nUUID=4e0dfeae-701a-43ce-b5c6-65f15ab3d8e3 none            swap    sw              0       0\n\nThe entire file system is read-only.

The FS suddenly and randomly become read-only. Maybe it is related to this bug:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1063354\nIt seems like the problem is with new kernel.\n\nA: Had this happen on mine and seem to have it sorted, at least for the moment.  Boot from an older kernel in grub, then do the update to the newest version of xubuntu again.  After that, immediately restart.  When grub comes around again, boot in recovery mode for the latest kernel. Choose fsck. It'll come up with a message saying it has to change the file system to read/write to continue (or something along those lines).  Select yes, let it do the check, and restart.  Boot up normally and it should work, did for me anyway.\nOne thing I should note here, don't try to just go straight to recovery without booting/updating the older kernel first.

So that makes me difficult to read the folder names whenever I align all folders in a same line. What I want is to re-size the folders name area to make it readable. Is it possible?\nP.S: The same requested for the file names also.\n\nA: Horizontal Adjustment: Overlapping icons\n\nIf this is your first experience with Ubuntu, you might have noticed that icons can be arranged in a way where their file names are overlapping.\n\nThis is not an error, it's a wanted behavior. The user should not be limited in the ways, he can arrange his icons. If he wants the icons to overlap, he should be able to do so.\nWhat you expected is a \"snap to grid\"-like functionality like you might know from other operating systems. In Ubuntu you are free to place your icons where you want to place them and lock the arrangement. You might call that \"lock to place\" instead of \"lock to grid\".\nThis means you just have to move the icons until they do not overlap anymore. When you are happy with your arrangement, right-click to open the context menu and choose to lock the arrangement.\n\n\n\nVertical Adjustment: Change the number of displayed lines of icon text\n\n\n- Install dconf-tools\nOpen up a terminal with CTRL+ALT+T and install dconf-tools with:\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n- Change nautilus configuration\nStart the dconf editor with the command:\ndconf-editor\nThen navigate through /org/gnome/nautilus/desktop and change the value for the field-key \ntext-ellipsis-limit to 0 (if you don't want your file names to be truncated) \nor insert a value x > 0 for displaying up to x  lines of the file name.\n- Restart nautilus\nnautilus -q and then open a file-manager window to start nautilus again.\n\nIcon Adjustments: Change details displayed in the icon text\n\nOpen a file-manager window and go to Edit -> Settings in the menu.

Upon installation, it creates a user account using one's phone number as username (Jabber ID: [phone number]@s.whatsapp.net). WhatsApp software automatically compares all phone numbers from the device's address book with its central database of WhatsApp users to automatically add contacts to the users WhatsApp contact list. Previously the Android and s40 versions used an MD5-hashed, reversed-version of the phone's IMEI as password, while the iOS version used the phone's WiFi MAC address instead of IMEI. *A recent update now generates a random password on the server side.*\n\nA: it can be done ive got whatssapp working on ubuntu 13.10 with noproblems\nvirtual box 4.22 required and gemymotion emulator\nwhen you are asked for the sms code just type any number i will then give you the option to be called to your phone pick up the call type in the numbers you are told over the phone on your emulator and thats it\ndo not use your whatsapp in your phone while your emulator is running or you will need  to re do the verification procces in your phone\nthey only allow  whatsapp to run in one device only\n", "Q: optirun fails in Ubuntu 12.10 I am trying to use Nvidia Optimus on my laptop by using Bumblebee, I have an Intel Core i5 with an Nvidia Geforce GT 630M.\nI have followed the instructions on the wiki page at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee, but when trying to run optirun with Firefox (or any other program, like glxspheres), I get the following error:\n[ 1921.452820] [ERROR]Cannot access secondary GPU - error: Could not load GPU driver\n[ 1921.452905] [ERROR]Aborting because fallback start is disabled.\n\nI have tried googling the issue but I couldn't find any solution that didn't cause more problems.\nThank you for your time.\nHere is my bumblebee.conf: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1333324/\n\nA: Probably your problem is in the configuration of Bumblebee. To configure it you need to edit /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf. To do so, you can run in a terminal, or using Alt+F2\ngksu gedit /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf\n\nFirst, you need to select which driver you want Bumblebee to use: nvidia or nouveau. If you have installed bumblebee-nvidia itś better to use nvidia. Replace Driver= with\nDriver=nvidia\n\nAlso update the two ocorrences of PMMethod with\nPMMethod=none\n\nAfter rebooting this should make Bumblebee work. If you get a error running optirun regarding permissions you must execute the following command, replacing  with your username:\nsudo usermod -a -G bumblebee <username>\n\nThis will only let you use your NVidia card (ie it will not make nothing regarding power management). If you want Bumblebee to turn off the NVidia card when it is not used you should check the Wiki link you provided, and the TurnCardOffAtExit value in Bumblebee  configuration.\nAlso, you should install bbswitch-dkms (it requires linux-headers-generic\n)\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\nsudo apt-get install bbswitch-dkms\n\n\nA: It seems I have fixed my problem.

I am running 11.04 and sometimes I need to take a screenshot of a full-screen application - and the Gnome panels on top and bottom are usually in the way.\nSo, I can click the \"hide buttons\" (panel handles?) on left and right of each panel bar, and then the panel goes left or right - however, the handle itself is still visible, and \"always on top\" - so again it ends in the screenshot.\nIs there any way to hide the panel handles completely?\n\nA: Well, it's possible - albeit a bit tricky: right click on the panel handle, choose \"Properties\" - \"Panel Properties\" starts up; here check the \"Autohide\" option, click \"Close\". \nThe important part here, is that \"hide\" doesn't work, if the panels are \"collapsed\" (that is, only the handles are visible on top in screen corner) - so first \"expand\" the top and bottom panel; then wait for a second or two - and then the panels will go upward (or downward, respectively) outside of the screen, and so will finally be completely hidden for view :)\nHope this helps someone.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu v12 on computer running Windows ME I want to put Ubuntu on a computer running Windows ME.I have the Ubuntu CD that I purchased, but my computer will not boot to this disc.

I'm trying to do LAN gaming with Crossover for Linux, but my computer doesn't ever get found by other players in my network, neither does it find other players itself.\n(I tried with 2 games, Battle for Middle Earth 2 and Anno 1602.)\nIs there a general method for achieving LAN access for Wine?\n\nA: You might be able to try Hamachi (unmanaged), since it creates a virtual LAN network. As far as Wine is concerned, I've only used Hamachi with Wine to play Diablo II TCP/IP, not LAN. However, I assume this would work, since I've gotten Minecraft LAN to work with computers out of my network using Hamachi.\n\nSo you'll want everyone you want to play LAN with to install Hamachi, and you all join a single network; Then, when you open a LAN game, if you connect using an IP, you'll want to use your Hamachi IP, which I believe usually is something like 5.x.x.x\n\nA: Your best best is to ask on the wine forums at winehq (it's the same people) or on the forums at crossover. \nFirst, you need to make sure that you have real access to the LAN. Check your firewall, and make sure your not blocking any ports. Make sure that the port your trying gets used. \nYou can also experience problems with older games that try to access NICs directly or some such. However for most part wine just uses the network you have. It doesn't care if the packets are routed to the internet or 5 feet away. This could be very game specific. \nOlder DirectPlay games also have some problems. If you look at Anno 1602 for example you will find that dplay (networking) is a problem. see the bug report. There is a workaround.  Download the dll files you need for dplay better instructions here and set them to use them by doing something like \nWINEDLLOVERRIDES=\"dplayx,dpnet,dpnhpast,dpwsockx=n\" wine 1602.exe\nKeep in mind this is just one way to achieve this.\n", "Q: add platform to ubuntu I am new in Ubuntu (come from Windows 7), i want to know how can i add environment variable in Ubuntu, because the platform where i use exaggerate \"To compile and run SCA composites with OW2 FraSCAti, you also have to set the FRASCATI_HOME system environment variable.

Now, you'll be able to issue gammu commands without sudo.\nOf course, remove previous rules in your 40-41-descriptive-name.rules\nPlease note that two lines in 99-phone.rules are there only to ensure that all possible cases for initial phone recognition are covered (also note MODE=\"0666\" - that will give rw for all users/groups).\nThis is approach I'm using for my own SMS gateway (using three phones and based on gammu-smsd) and, so far, works well.\n\nA: One should also check Gammu daemon gammu-smsd and it's configuration file.

I often need to take screenshots of windows that are larger than the currently shown desktop. I'm on Ubuntu 11.04, gnome-about says Version: 2.32.1; compiz --version says Compiz 0.9.4.0 -- and I have four virtual desktops/workspaces, which are arranged as such: \n \n\n\nThe above images were obtained by moving into each separate workspace, and taking a screenshot via PrintScreen key - that is to say, gnome-screenshot. (I am aware that there are better ways of obtaining firefox shots, like the \"Page Saver\" addon - the above is taken simply as an example of a generic oversized window).\nEDIT: I'm apparently using the wrong nomenclature here (found via xorg - Get current Virtual Desktop - number/name/tag/id? - Unix and Linux) - it turns out, in the above example, I still have only one workspace; what is changed, instead, is the viewport - this is what wmctrl -d shows on each of the \"virtual desktops\": $ wmctrl -d\n0  * DG: 2048x1200  VP: 0,0  WA: 0,1 1024x598  Workspace 1\n$ wmctrl -d\n0  * DG: 2048x1200  VP: 0,600  WA: 0,1 1024x598  Workspace 1\n$ wmctrl -d\n0  * DG: 2048x1200  VP: 1024,0  WA: 0,1 1024x598  Workspace 1\n$ wmctrl -d\n0  * DG: 2048x1200  VP: 1024,600  WA: 0,1 1024x598  Workspace 1  so to switch between \"virtual desktops\" from the command line, I should in fact change the \"viewport\", as in: wmctrl -o 1024,0\nObviously, moving to each virtual desktop, taking a screenshot and stitching them together - and finally cutting the application window - is a bit tedious, so I was wandering if there was a tool (preferably command line) that would allow me to pick a window that is larger than the current desktop, and takes a screenshot of its entire contents, in one go. There could be two scenarios here as well:\n\n\n*\n\n*A larger-than-desktop window is moved so it takes up space on several virtual desktops (like the images above show)\n\n*A larger-than-desktop window is moved outside of the total size of all virtual desktops (from the perspective of top-left desktop in composition above, imagine moving the application window towards the top-left, and outside of desktop area - as opposed to it being moved bottom right as shown above)\n\n\nThe first case is possible, if not in any other way, then manually (as I did it above) -- and for the second case, I guess it should be possible for an application to either \"move\" the window briefly to the total all-desktops area - or create a \"virtual\" graphics context not shown on screen, and render the window there (although, I don't know enough details to know for sure). \nI have tried the following tools so far: \n\n\n*\n\n*gnome-screenshot\n\n*xwd \n\n*scrot\n\n*import (ImageMagick)\n\n\nand they will all capture just a \"corner\" of the entire application window, which is shown on the current desktop (in a situation as shown above). When trying to capture \"root\" or \"full-screen\", all of these capture just the currently rendered desktop (not the total area of all virtual desktops). \nI also tried shutter (0.87.2 Rev.1071), and while I've found information that from version 0.86.4 onwards, \"you can capture all virtual desktops now. Shutter will go through all of them, take a picture of every one and compose them into a one large screenshot\" - I did give a try clicking on \"Capture all Workspaces\" - but it only takes a shot of the current workspace/desktop; window captures are likewise cut at the limits of current desktop (or fail with \"Error while taking the screenshot: Maybe mouse pointer could not be grabbed or the selected area is invalid.\" if the window fully sits in a virtual desktop other than the current one). \nThen I read that there is a screenshot plugin for compiz - and since here compiz manages the virtual desktops, I thought it could handle the total area - but there are no settings there (in CompizConfig settings manager), but: \"Enable plugin\", an output directory, and a button to enable and set hotkeys for \"Initiate rectangle screenshot\" -- and since apparently only thing you can do is drag with the mouse to specify a rectangular area, I doubt that plugin would help capturing the total area in one go. \nThus, I'd like to ask for some suggestions about tools, that can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Capture the total area (all workspaces/virtual desktops) in one go; or\n\n*Capture the total area of the selected window, even if it is pushed outside of the currently rendered desktop (also in one go)\n\n\nI would prefer something that deals with this stuff in memory - I myself could come up with something worse: such as a bash script that sends keystrokes to change desktops (or just via wmctrl), and takes individual screenshots there -- but that would be a pain to use, especially since I'd be visually exposed to the \"desktop switching\" while the screenshot is being captures... If not any complete programs, suggestions for C/Perl/Python APIs that can access bitmap data on all/any virtual desktops would be great too.\n\nA: Ok, found this for X windows: \nFVWM Forums • View topic - Thumbnailing a Window on another Viewport\n\nAs to why you can't access a window (that is, take a picture of it when it is not on the same desk/page as the current viewport) is because windows that are not on the current page are unmapped. This is true when one changes pages/desks -- the windows are unmapped, and the windows on the current viewport are remapped.\n\nSo, I guess that means what I want is impossible? Although there are two workarounds: \n\n\n*\n\n*use xrandr to increase the virtual size of (each of the four) viewports\n\n\nThis is what works for me - first query to see which output you want, then execute:\n$ xrandr -q\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1024 x 600, maximum 4096 x 4096\nLVDS1 connected 1024x600+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 0mm x 0mm\n   1024x600       60.0*+\n   800x600        60.3     56.2  \n   640x480        59.9  \nVGA1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n\n$ xrandr --output LVDS1 --panning 1600x768\n\n... see also X/Config/Resolution - Ubuntu Wiki\n\n\n*\n\n*Use xvfb for virtual render\n\n\nGot this via x11 - Remote offscreen rendering - Server Fault, also see Xvfb - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia for examples. This is what worked for me - each command goes in own terminal (as some of them are meant to be services)\n# start xvfb as display 1 - note the \"screen 0\" there refers to \"its own\" screen 0; should set it to 24-bit color\n\nXvfb :1 -screen 0 1600x1200x24 -pixdepths 3 -fp /usr/share/fonts/X11/Type1\n\n# start metacity on display 1 (would start gdm, but [Bug #598848: gdm no longer works with xvfb](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/598848)\n# needed to we have title bars, and possibility to move windows around \n\nDISPLAY=:1 metacity\n\n# start application (here web-browser arora) again on display 1\n\nDISPLAY=:1 arora\n\n# start vnc server, which will bridge display 1 to port 5900\n# note - this command exists, however starts a server in background \n\nx11vnc -display :1 -bg -nopw -listen localhost -xkb\n\n# start vnc viewer on port 5900 - so we can see display 1:\n# note also - when vncviewer exits, it also will kill the x11vnc server\n\nvncviewer -FullColor=1 localhost:5900\n\nThe problem here is that not all parts of the OS are initialized - so there are no window decoration, and only basic X fonts; although, apps may find their own fonts, as seen below:\n\nxvfb looks almost ideal to me - since I could basically set up an \"invisible\" environment, as big as I want, and take screenshots directly from it (using xwd). The problem is that I cannot have a window on \"my\" DISPLAY=:0, then switch it to the 'virtual' DISPLAY=:1 for screenshotting, then bring it back to DISPLAY=:0. Then one must set up an application specifically for xvfb; and if so happens you need more size - then the whole chain above needs to be restarted. \nOn the other hand, I find working with 4 workspaces and large viewports (shwere the mouse moves you around within a viewport) a bit confusing - then again, can change the size there on the fly and nothing needs to be restarted; and plus I can use any of the usual screenshot tools (but I'd still have to switch viewports).\nNeedless to say, I'd still love to hear about a possible command line solution that could do this kind of screenshotting in one go :)\n\nA: On my FreeBSD workstation I created a bash script to do the captures of multiple virtual workspaces then run the results through ImageMagic 'montage' to stitch them. Here is the bash script:\n#!/usr/local/bin/bash\ndnum=$(xdotool get_num_desktops)\ndesk=0\nwhile [[ \"$desk\" -lt \"$dnum\" ]];\n     do\n          xdotool set_desktop $desk;\n          sleep 2;\n          maim --format png /dev/stdout > ~/capture/desktop$desk.png;\n          desk=$((desk+1));\n     done\n\nHere is the command I run in the ~/capture/ directory to stitch them together:\nmontage  desktop*.png  -tile 10x1 -geometry 1920x2160+1+1 workspaces.png\n\nObviously one would change the -tile and -geometry for one's own system. ;)\nOne needs to have installed bash, maim (or equivalent), xdotool, and ImageMagick montage for this solution.

I'm looking at ways to reduce the amount of space taken up by my large collection of music, mostly Ogg Vorbis with the occasional MP3. What prompted this was thinking ahead to potentially using an Ubuntu tablet with limited storage. Consequently, I thought of writing a script to gzip each track (i.e. foobar.ogg becomes foobar.ogg.gz).\nThe problem is, I then need an audio player smart enough to decompress the gzipped music on the fly, find out what format it actually is and play it as normal.

I have tried purging and reinstalling the package, but nothing has changed even after reboot (see screenshot).\nWhat can I try to do to get the overlay-scrollbars working again?\n\n\nA: It seems that the main reason why overlay scrollbars didn't work is because I have configured my system to boot to console first.

However, it seems that 12.10 doesn't load this GTK module, so I had to manually execute this line declare -x GTK_MODULES=\"overlay-scrollbar\". I ended up adding it to my .bashrc file so that I don't have to type it every time.\nI got this idea from the /etc/X11/Xsession.d/81overlay-scrollbar file which says:\n# This file is sourced by Xsession(5), not executed.\n\nif [ -z \"$GTK_MODULES\" ] ; then\n    GTK_MODULES=\"overlay-scrollbar\"\nelse\n    GTK_MODULES=\"$GTK_MODULES:overlay-scrollbar\"\nfi\n\nso I guess that this file used to be executed on each start of the X windows syst, but now it isn't used because the GTK_MODULES variable wasn't set after start.\n", "Q: Grub Bootloader error every second boot Every time I turn on my laptop I get a grub bootloader error.

I'm new to Ubuntu. My experience with Ubuntu is only two weeks.\n\nA: It might be because you do not have the permissions to use those partitions.\n\n\n*\n\n*To take ownership of a drive or partition (internal and external), simply run the following command:\nsudo chown -R username:username /partition/mount-point\n\nWhere username is your actual username, mount-point is the directory in the file system to which the partition will be mounted and not the device name (eg: /dev/sda1). \n\n*To determine the mount-point, run mount in the terminal, and locate the line that corresponds to the drive or partition. \n\n\n*\n\n*If you have not set a label for the partition, it will look something like this:\n/dev/sda5 on /media/7e3fbc57-03fe-4742-bb72-756f31852059\n\n\n*If you have set the label with something descriptive, it should look like this:\n/dev/sda5 on /media/data\n\nBased on the example, the mount-point will be something like /media/7e3fbc57-03fe-4742-bb72-756f31852059 OR /media/data. \nNow, all you need to do now is run the command below with your username and the correct mount-point:\nsudo chown -R peachy:peachy /media/7e3fbc57-03fe-4742-bb72-756f31852059\n\nOR\nsudo chown -R peachy:peachy /media/data\n\nNote: Your username and mount-point will be different. Also, if you have set a label that contains spaces (e.g. 1TB External or My Files), you will need to enclose the entire mount-point path in single quotes, such as:\nsudo chown -R peachy:peachy '/media/My Files'\n\nOR \nsudo chown -R peachy:peachy '/media/1TB External'\n\nYou are now the owner of the partition and should be able to do whatever you want with the drive or partition.\n\nTo change ownership of NTFS partitions, see:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I use 'chmod' on an NTFS (or FAT32) partition?\n\n*How to 'chown' on an NTFS ( or FAT32 ) partition?\n\nA: There might be several reasons for this problem.\nMaybe the partitions are mounted read-only, which is the default for NTFS partitions as far as I remember. If you're using NTFS, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountingWindowsPartitions for how to mount them read-write.\nFor other file systems you can have a look inside the file /etc/fstab. Documentation about how entries in this file should look like could be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab. But be careful if you modify this file, you might loose access to your filesystems completely.\nAnother reason could be that you're not granted the rights modify files on the partition. Open the partition in Nautilus file manager and choose File -> Properties -> Permissions. If this folder is not owned by you or your group, change the ownership or give 'others' write permissions.\n", "Q: How do I make Ubuntu \"power loss proof\"? I like to run a system unattended for every day 'kiosk' use. \nHowever, the system may be powered off anytime without someone doing a proper shutdown before. By default, Ubuntu is not expected to be shut down by power loss. After rebooting after a power loss, fsck may be run to check the file system, and fsck may tell the system to reboot after it has finished. So even if no configuration data gets corrupted, the machine may not boot well after power loss. So I tested some workarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*change the root mount fsck priority to 0 (last field in fstab root entry)\nthat prevents running fsck after every power loss. However, the the system may boot with root mounted read-only then, which is not expected by many services and results in a console login prompt instead the graphical login.\n\n*Replace errrors=remount-ro by errors=continue. This gives a bad feeling that further data loss may occur by an incosistent filesystem. However, with fsck enabled again, it should increase the system's boot propability after power loss. So I dropped 1).\n\n*Reconfigure grub2 to use a normal default option timeout after a failed boot. For that, i've added GRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT=0 to /etc/default/grub. \nHowever, it is hard to know if these hacks make the system power loss proof. Any ideas? Any more one can do?\n\nA: Some times after an unclean reboot (say power loss or reset button pressed or even a kernel panic), the system will not boot asking you you to press \"y\" for an fsck to repair the partition.\nIf you would like to avoid this, edit /etc/default/rcS and change:\nFSCKFIX=no\n\nTo:\nFSCKFIX=yes\n\nThis will ensure this repair is ran automatically without prompting you.\nThe downside may be that you can lose data and you may want to take the hard drive out and clone it first if there is anything critical on it that isn't backed up. \nFor example if your hard drive controller has a fault and fsck falsely identified the partition as broken and tries to repair it, that can lead to data loss that can otherwise be avoided. I have never experienced this myself and have dealt with close to a thousand servers over the past 7 years or so - but still this is something to keep in mind.\n\nA: As of today, for a kiosk read-only solution one can also install the package overlayroot by\nsudo apt-get install overlayroot\n\nwhich will easily provide a complete solution like the one of the approved answer. It also allows for the beneficial command \nsudo overlay-chroot\n\nwhich will log into an shell having the former read-only base disk mounted on /. It is then possible to make any changes to the protected system one like and for example use apt-get to install packages to the former readonly disk. However, after exiting the shell a reboot is strongly recommended as temporarly overwritten files on RAM may obscure newly installed ones.\n\nA: For kiosk application, the problem is solved by using a readonly root partition. In addition, any changes users make or save are undone at the next reboot.\nTo provide a writable root for most applications needs, overlayfs can be used to overlay the readonly partition with a writable ram tempfs. \nThere is a script that helps creating such a setup at the bottom of https://help.ubuntu.com/community/aufsRootFileSystemOnUsbFlash . The script contains the instructions to set this up:\n\n\n*\n\n*put the file in /etc/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-bottom/root-ro\n\n*sudo chmod 0755 root-ro\n\n*sudo update-initramfs -u\nI suggest to add GRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT=0 to /etc/default/grub and run sudo update-grub too, otherwise the boot menu may appear without timeout.\nAfter that, reboot. The machine then starts in readonly mode, which can be checked by  mount. Any change applied will vanish on next reboot. To make any changes, install software and updates etc. you just need to enter the GRUB menu, press e to change the boot command lines, and append disable-root-ro=true to the line starting with kernel. Press F10 to continue booting. You can then use mount to confirm root is mounted writable as usual.

I assume that jianyue is your username. Ubuntu seems to have a bug in that they now want to mount these removable drives in /media/'username' but it does not automatically create it...\nSo, I think this should work for anyone for their own user account:\n$ sudo mkdir /media/$USER\n$ sudo chown $USER.$USER /media/$USER\n\nYou would need to have administration privileges to be able to do execute these commands.

My suggestion would be to boot into ubuntu via a livecd or a liveusb. This way you can see how ubuntu works without actually going through the full install. You will be able to see if are any hardware compatibility issues and such. It will boot slower and may run slower from CD/USB than a harddrive install will, but it will give you an idea of what a full install will look like.\nAlso, are you sure you should use a 64bit version? 32bit works on 64s but not vice versa (as far as I know...)\nGood luck!\n\nA: Explain your question a little better.

This will output the SSID and nothing more.  Previously, I was using this clunker:\niwconfig <iface> | grep ESSID | awk -F: '{print $2}' | sed 's/\\\"//g'\n\nOne of my favorite things about the *nix world is the ability to string together a bunch of commands and programs that utilize standard input and output to achieve whatever it is that I need.  However, when a single flag can be passed to a program like iwgetid to accomplish the same thing, it's no longer a decision between which to use.  It's an IQ test.\nKeep in mind you can still specify different wireless network interfaces using iwgetid like so:\niwgetid <iface> -r\n\n", "Q: Upgrade php5-gd to 2.0.1 on 12.04?

I installed php5-gd with apt-get, and aptitude hasn't found new packages.\nDo I have to add a new PPA? Where can I find it? What about forcing a version?\n\nA: According to http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/php5-gd You should have libgd 2.0.36 in Ubuntu 12.04. I believe the \"2.0\" there is just a major/minor version and isn't sharing with you the patch level. Perhaps something else is going wrong.\n", "Q: Why I can't see the thumbnails in Nautilus? Problem Loading Thumb Previews:\n\nThis started to happen after upgraded Ubuntu from 12.04 to 12.10.\n\nA: I had the same issue.\nI solved it by moving the .thumbnails folder and setting a symbolic link to .cache/thumbnails instead.\nmv ~/.thumbnails ~/thumbnails\nln -s ~/.cache/thumbnails ~/.thumbnails\n\nIs it possible that there were some changes?\nIt looks to me like the thumbnailers create their thumbnails in .cache/thumbnails, while nautilus keeps looking in .thumbnails.\n\nA: Looks like the path has changed in recent versions.  For me the issue in 13.04 was that ~/.cache/thumbnails was owned by root.\nSo for 13.04 at least, the command is:\nsudo chown -R yourusername:yourusername ~/.cache/thumbnails\n\nSo Salem did have it-\n\nA: try changing nautilus preferences\nEdit-> Preferences-> Preview-> Other Previewable Files-> only files under (set a higher MB value and then try reloading)\n\nA: This may happen if you get a different UID from the one you had before (this will remove you the ownership of those files). Try executing this on a terminal:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/.thumbnails\n\nFrom 12.10 onward, thumbnais are also stored in ~/.cache/thumbnails, so you may repeat the same process for this location.\nIf none of those solves your issue, you can always remove them (they are automatically generated, and I think failed thumbs generations are cached):\nsudo rm -rf ~/.thumbnails/* ~/.cache/thumbnails/*\n\nNote: it's not the case of OP, but if you don't get previews to video files (ex: mkv, mp4) probably you are missing the video codec. This can be easily fixed by open the video with \"Movie Player\": it will propose a suitable codec.\n\nA: If you are trying to access a network device like a NAS, then go to nautilus preferences, and choose Edit-> Preferences-> Preview-> Other Previewable Files->Show thumbnails->Always\nHope this helps!\n\nA: there may be another factor causing this - perhaps you didn't install the right codec as suggested here: http://iwillfolo.blogspot.co.il/2013/10/thumbnail-doesnt-load.html\ntry installing ubuntu restricted extras. Open a terminmal and type:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras -y\n\n\nA: Depends on version of glib, the change was in the Gio module starting in the 2.35 series. \nThe thumbnail cache directory is prefixed with $XDG_CACHE_DIR/ and the leading dot removed (since $XDG_CACHE_DIR is normally $HOME/.cache). The glib ChangeLog indicates the path for large sizes was \"fixed\" (Added $XDG_CACHE_DIR)\nstarting with 2.35.3 so as to match the path for normal sizes, implying some versions using the added prefix, pior to 2.35.3 (I did not find any) are broke. The solution to add the symbolic link would provide a work-around for these broken versions.\n\nA: In my case it was pretty simple: All I had to do is to change the preference in nautilus, by switching from \"show thumbnails: only local files\" to \"show thumbnails: always\" (my JPGs located in my smartphone weren't being shown). I found the issue thanks to Aswn, practically, so thumbs up for him/her.\n\nA: Change nautilus preferences in\nEdit -> Preferences -> Preview -> Files -> Show Thumbnails\nfrom \"Local files Only\" to \"Always\".\nThis could be helpful for usb memories or any external source like phones.\n(ubuntu 14.04 LTS)\n\nA: I had the same symptom and fixed it by installing the following package\nsudo apt install libgdk-pixbuf2.0-bin\n\n\nA: In my case I disabled a kernel sysctl setting because of CVE-2022-32250 and this broke \"bwrap\" from package bubblewrap which is used internally when creating thumbnails!\nSo the following as \"root\" made it work again for me:\necho \"1\" > /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_userns_clone\n\nUnfortunately the actual error messages in nautilus is hidden deeply inside so that only running with strace allowed to find out the \"bwrap\" commandline which then showed the proper error-message.\n", "Q: How to set keyboard shortcuts from a script I appear to be suffering from this bug that means my custom keyboard shortcuts are lost on reboot. I have 8 custom shortcuts, and re-setting all 8 via the GUI method for setting keyboard shortcuts is tedious.\nI am using 12.10 and Unity. The keyboard shortcuts I want to customise are \n\n\n*\n\n*\"Shift to workspace left\" (right/above/below) - with shortcut CtrlAltl (h/k/j)\n\n*\"Move window one workspace to the left\" (right/up/down) - with shortcut ShiftCtrlAltl (h/k/j). \n\n\n(At least those are the names I see in the keyboard shortcut dialogs.)\nSo until the bug is fixed, I would like to be able to run a script to set all 8 after I have logged in. So what command line program and options do I need to run to set a keyboard shortcut?\n\nA: I think you can achieve that effect using a script like this (only deals with switching desktop, but it can be extended changing switch-to-workspace* with move-to-workspace*):\n#!/bin/bash\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-up \"['<Control><Primary><Alt>k']\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-down \"['<Control><Primary><Alt>j']\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-left \"['<Control><Primary><Alt>h']\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-right \"['<Control><Primary><Alt>l']\"\n\nNOTE: Maybe the <Primary> part in shortcut is redundant.

I know that I can convert pdf files to text files one by one like this :\n$ pdftotext filename.pdf\n\nBut is there a single command that would make that conversion without specifying separate file names so as to convert them all? \nI see here, on Wikipedia, that \"Wildcards (*), for example $ pdftotext *pdf, for converting multiple files, cannot be used because pdftotext expects only one file name.\"\n\nA: The following will convert all files in the current directory:\nfor file in *.pdf; do pdftotext \"$file\" \"$file.txt\"; done\n\n\nA: write a bash script\nfor f in *.pdf; do\n  pdftotext \"$f\"\ndone\n\nor type it in a one-line command as follows:\nfor f in *.pdf; do pdftotext \"$f\"; done \nI hope this helps. I do not have a large group of .pdfs to test this on, but I use this strategy to convert my .flac files to .ogg files.\n\nA: ls *.pdf | xargs -n1 pdftotext\n\nxargs is often a quick solution for running the same command multiple times with just a small change each time.

In this page:\nhttp://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes\nThey suddenly start talking about \"renewing\" an ubuntu installation, but without a single explanation as to what they mean nor how to do it.\nCould someone please explain that concept?\n\nA: well just read more\n\"Renewing the Installation without formating the partitons (in contrast to upgrading), will also keep the personal data and configurations under /home but will renew all system settings under /etc as well as the default set of installed packages. \"\n\nA: You would need a separate root partition as designated by:\n/\n\n& separate home partition as designated by:\n/home\n\nTo renew you would uncheck the format option during installing so as not format home.  This as I understand will leave most of your personalisation intact.  Most People agree it is best to have a separate home and root setup for this very reason.  Root gets formatted whichever option you choose.  \nHowever I believe you would have had to of used advanced formatting option when installing your OS to have a separate home partition.  You can check with GParted (but you must never use GParted to run partitioning on a live/mounted environment, but rather only offline.)  This aside, GParted will show your partitioning structure if you are not sure.  It is possible to move home to it's own partition in a vanilla install, but that is not in the scope of this question, (IE; I do not know without Google!)\n", "Q: Application as desktop background in Ubuntu I was thinking, if there is any way to set, for example, a java application as my desktop background?

Please help!!!\n\nA: Windows 7 partitions are created using the NTFS filesystem, which does not support Unix-style file permissions, which Ubuntu uses. You can, however, use Umask along with fstab to mount easily:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run gksu gedit /etc/fstab to open Text Editor.\n\n*You are now in fstab.\n\n*Open a Terminal. Determine the partition UUID:\nblkid\n\nand note the UUID for your partition.\n\n\n*\n\n*Also make a directory to mount:\nsudo mkdir /media/windisk\n\n\n*Now go back to the text editor and add a line:\nUUID=[YOUR UUID HERE] /media/windisk ntfs-3g auto,users,permissions 0 0\n\nSave, and reboot.\nYou can now mount this partition and work with permissions on it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 and Realtek Wireless Card Incompatible Quick background: I installed Linux Ubuntu 12.04 on a Dell Inspiron 3520 after uninstalling Windows 8.  A friend suggested to do this as opposed to buying a laptop with Linux pre-installed.  Everything except the wireless card works.\nWhen I load up the laptop, I see a wireless animation as if it's trying to locate the wireless connection (for a while, then it goes blank), but no connections appear under the wireless option (under \"Edit Connections\" then \"Wireless\").\nWhat I've tried:\n- Doing ndiswrapper.  Failed.\n- Installing a few kernels for realtek.  Failed.\n\nA: I had similar problem with RTL8187SE wireless NIC.  The problem was because of the default driver r8187se is buggy.  For me ndiswrapper solved the problem, but I had to blacklist the original driver (yours will be different from r8187se).  After I blacklisted the original driver, and enabled ndiswrapper at the startup, everything is fine now.  You can see my post here.\n", "Q: What's the caret (^) mean in apt-get? I'm seeing various instructions that request that you install something like:\napt-get install lamp-server^\n\nWith the oddball caret in the command. It doesn't seem to be mentioned in apt-get manual. What's the deal ? \n\nA: The ^ character is not a typo. If you remove it, apt-get will complain that the package cannot be found.\nThis article and its comments describe what the caret does:\n\nWell, the answer is that the caret symbol is a short form for performing a task that otherwise the program “tasksel” would have done with the given package name. tasksel is a program to ease the installation of commonly used things that go together for a particular use.\n\n\nA: The ^ symbol let you install \"Tasks\", a set of packages. This can replace tasksel, dedicated tool to work with tasks.\nBy doing\napt-get install lamp-server^\n\nYou are actually running installing a set of packages that would have been installed via the command (even is not exactly the same):\ntasksel lamp-server\n\nIn other words: Tasks are very similar to meta-packages and live independently of tasksel. You can install tasks without installing tasksel package.\n", "Q: ethernet not working on new Lubuntu 12.10 installation The title says it all, I freshly installed Lubuntu 12.10 and it isn't able to connect to the intranet and/or internet.

What I am trying to do is bring a third node up so that I can have some slavecluster nodes. But I am now facing the same problem as with the second node:\nMAAS is not installing the juju-agent enabled image to the third node, so the agent status is always not-started.\nIs this a juju problem, where juju must inform MAAS that it should install the correct image to the node? Or is this a MAAS problem where states are out of sync?\nIt really surprising that to get this to work, I have to destroy-environment, and then bootstrap again, and everything is OK.\nAnyone have any ideas what I have done here?\n\nA: There shouldn't be no need to re-run 'juju bootstrap' to get your nodes working. The bootstrap phase is only needed to get the juju environment started.\nYou said you rebooted the second node and I think that's the key: did you configure the power parameters of your nodes (I assume you run the quantal version of MAAS)?  If you can't do that, once you deploy a charm manually and you see the node only which the charm will get deployed 'allocated' on the MAAS UI, you need to power on the nodes so that Ubuntu can get installed on the machine and the charm installed (this can take a while depending on the hardware you have).  What I'm saying is that if your node uses IPMI or any other kind of supported power mechanism and you've configured the credentials, then MAAS will power up the nodes but if you can't do that, then you need to do that manually.\nIf this does not solve your problem, I suggest running 'juju debug-log' to see why the charm cannot be deployed.\n\nA: What DNS domain do you have set in MaaS?\nDoes it end in .local?\nIf so, it's a problem with avahi-daemon.\nEdit the MaaS generic preseed and take out avahi-daemon from the install list.\nAlternatively, edit /etc/nsswitch.conf and change the hosts: line to:\nhosts: files dns mdns4\nOn all nodes.\nYou'll know if this is the problem by not being able to ping the initial ZK node FQDN from your other nodes by name.\n", "Q: Trouble hosting a Minecraft server I've been trying to host a Minecraft server for some time now.

OK, so I am a deadbeat. I just upgraded Ubuntu 10.10 to 11.04. (I suspect now to have LTS I cannot have installed any packages from outside the core supported in LTS). I did this only last week, the upgrade was done only after I used Partition Magic to rob space from an unused extended partition and I had to erase swap partitions to be able to resize the extended partition because it was busy, neither qparted or Partition Magic tell you that they found swap and are using it. They complain if you want to use that partition, and they should. The upgrade took a couple of hours and added more than a gig of usage on the root. So just today I get a notice from Update Manager that my install has fallen out of support. OK, I need to upgrade my install again this time to 12.04 and possibly on to 12.10. So why am I doing this? I thought that Connonical was going to lessen this rat race, or is it a race condition? I think that it is a bad idea to be on a bleeding edge anyway preferring to be down rev a couple. I vote for a longer support cycle and consider this cause to replace ubuntu with another linux.\n\nA: Every long term support release is supported for five years, while the in-between releases are each supported for two years. If you are interested in a longer support cycle, Ubuntu 12.04 is the way to go, and you could also have stuck with Ubuntu 10.04 for a while longer. The next LTS release will be Ubuntu 14.04, and when that comes out you will be able to upgrade from 12.04 to 14.04 in one step, but you don't need to do that until April 2017.\n", "Q: 12.04 LTS won't boot after modifying root directory permissions I accidentally changed permissions to root directory on my system and now my system won't boot, I tried to fix packages from grub recovery and check file system but nothing.\nHere's the code I accidentally typed:\n     sudo chown -hR jmayerz:jmayerz /\n\nAfter it executed, X11 shut down and system got stuck, so I rebooted and it won't boot again.\nI tried changing back permissions to system superuser from liveCD but how can I change it to the user on the machine itself not the liveCD?\nlike this:\n     sudo mkdir /media/mount\n     sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/mount\n     sudo chown -hR <user which originally owns root on the machine itself not liveCD, I think root user> / \n\nHow would that last line be executed?? which user is it?? and how is this executed from livCD?\nWhen I try to use that method in recovery, it tells me that files are read-only, when I try to perform tasks that mount root in read-write it still doesn't do it.\n     mount -ro remount,rw\n\nsays that /etc/fstab reports that directories are already mounted.\n     chown -hR root /\n\nsays that files are in read only mode, after mounting read-write through doing something like fixing packages, it doesn't output anything.\n     chmod -hR jmayerz:jmayerz /home/jmayerz/\n\nsame thing.\nAnd now the liveCD won't boot, says general filesystem mount error.\n\nA: There's always a user called root in Ubuntu, and its User ID is always 0. When using chown you can specify either user name or user ID, so I suppose both of the following commands should work when booted from a LiveCD:\nchown -hR root:root /media/mount\nchown -hR 0:0 /media/mount\n\nafter which I think you'll need to change the ownership of home directories - you'll have to use user IDs in this case because users from your machine do not exist when booted from LiveCD. You can see what was the user IDs of the users in your system by looking into /etc/passwd on the hard disk (so, in your case it'll be something like /media/mount/etc/passwd)\n", "Q: Why couldn't i mount windows 7 partition when it is hibernated? \nPossible Duplicate:\nUnable to mount Windows (NTFS) filesystem due to hibernation \n\nWhen i try to mount windows 7 partition when it is hibernated the system give me this message : \n\nso Why this happen, and can i mount it read/write ?\n\nA: Hibernation is basically a snapshot of a running OS, with all its running applications, open files (maybe in the middle of a write operation), file caches etc. \nIf you mount a hibernated partition from another OS and change data on disk - the actual state of the disk and what Windows knows of the disk goes out of sync, which can lead to severe corruption of the filesystem.\nThe accepted answer at Unable to mount Windows (NTFS) filesystem due to hibernation provides more details.\n", "Q: Stop CPU from slowing down When playing a 720p video file, I can hear the laptop CPU fan kick in which after a few minutes causes the video file to play back in a very choppy manner.

Try executing this in one terminal\nsudo modprobe uvcvideo\n\nThis should provide no output. If you get any error post it in the comments. Then try to use the webcam (with Cheese, by example).\nIf this solves your problem, you should add uvcvideo to /etc/modules file, to force the system to load it at boot time. The content of that file at the end should be\n# /etc/modules: kernel modules to load at boot time.\n#\n# This file contains the names of kernel modules that should be loaded\n# at boot time, one per line.

Try toggling ''exposure_auto_priority'' to see if that looses the grip of the auto algorithm on that particular setting.\nFor me, for example, setting  ''white_balance_temperature_auto'' to 0 allowed me to manually set ''white_balance_temperature'' which resulted in \"failed: Input/output error\" before.\n\nA: Using\nv4l2-ctl -d /dev/video1 -c exposure_auto=1 \n\ninstead of exposure_auto = 0, you can set exposure to manual then set exposure_absolute to change the value.\n\nA: Hi it's easy to find out what parameters your camera accepts with uvcdynctrl\nsudo apt install uvcdynctrl\n\nTo get a list of all supported commands type:\nuvcdynctrl -c -v\n\n-c will give you a list of all available settings\n-v stands for verbose, giving you the range of values accepted\nmy Microsoft Lifecam will give me this output:\n  Brightness\n    ID      : 0x00000001,\n    Type    : Dword,\n    Flags   : { CAN_READ, CAN_WRITE },\n    Values  : [ 30 .. 255, step size: 1 ],\n    Default : 133\n  Contrast\n    ID      : 0x00000002,\n    Type    : Dword,\n    Flags   : { CAN_READ, CAN_WRITE },\n    Values  : [ 0 .. 10, step size: 1 ],\n    Default : 5\n  Saturation\n    ID      : 0x00000004,\n    Type    : Dword,\n    Flags   : { CAN_READ, CAN_WRITE },\n    Values  : [ 0 .. 200, step size: 1 ],\n    Default : 83\n\n.. and so on.\nYou can then get the actual value with\nuvcdynctrl -g 'Exposure, Auto'\n\nor set the value with\nuvcdynctrl -s 'Exposure, Auto' 1\n\n", "Q: I removed nvidia driver and lshw -c video still shows nvidia Today I tried to activate the newer experimental drivers and both 304 and 310 failed to even install.

Make sure that /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head only contains comment lines and that /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base and /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail are absent or empty.  Then ifdown and ifup the interface. Confirm that the nameserver address(es) that you added to /etc/network/interfaces now appear in /etc/resolv.conf.\nIf name service still does not work then there's most likely a local problem: a misconfigured DHCP server, for example. Another known cause of problems is third-party VPN clients which trash the symbolic link /etc/resolv.conf. If your LAN seems OK and you aren't using third-party networking software then file a bug report against NetworkManager or resolvconf, whichever you think is more likely the culprit.\n\nA: I have the same problem... and I tried both with dnamasq and without it.\n\n\n*\n\n*When using dnsmasq for DNS it is getting started by network-manager, /etc/resolv.conf is pointing to localhost, but dnsmasq is unable to resolv any DNS names.\n\n\nMy network is configured in such a way that I can only exit through a HTTP proxy and the tricky part is that it is set with proxy.pac so for getting the proxy configuration I also need the DNS to work...\ndnsmasq should not try to connect directly to the DNS root servers(which it looks like it does), but it should just use the DNS servers available from within my network that I get through DHCP. But there is nothing telling it to use them, since both /var/run/nm-dns-dnsmasq.conf and /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d are empty.\n\n\n*\n\n*When not using dnsmasq for DNS in network-manager, I get the right DNS servers set inside /run/resolvconf/interface/NetworkManager, but resolvconf just won't use them, since it keeps getting localhost from /run/resolvconf/interface/lo.dnsmasq. The problem goes away after removing this file and restarting resolvconf.\n\n\nI think the problem can be worked around in two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*If using dnsmasq, you should configure your name servers in /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d\n\n*If using just resolvconf, the removal of /run/resolvconf/interface/lo.dnsmasq and restart of resolvconf should do the trick.\n\n\nStill, NetworkManager should be fixed in order to solve this problem properly...\n", "Q: Thunderbird gmail with priority inbox?

Ubuntu install process will find the empty space and create its own sets of partitions. Ubuntu uses ext4 formats for partitions. Creating partitions using Windows, for Ubuntu will not work.\nAdvanced Solution:\nKeep unallocated space for future use during Windows installation as before. \nDuring Ubuntu installation, choose the \"Something Else\" when it comes to the type of installation so that you can create your own sets of Ubuntu partition.\nI recommend 3 partitions, / (also known as root), /home, and Swap. The size of the first two will depend on your usage needs. \nFor normal desktop uses 30GB / should be sufficient for updates and new software you may want to install. If you want to run web server type of things, you may need more.\nFor normal desktop use, `/home' takes most of the space. This is where all the users' data files like music, photos, videos, etc. will stay. \nSwap can be small, say 2-4GB, unless you want to hibernate your PC, in that case, 6GB.\nThe / and /home should be formatted ext4. Swap has its own format in the drop down list.\nFor more on /home see Home on a different partition\nI hope this helps. \n\nA: I assume that you have 250GB free space as you mentioned. When you began the installation of ubuntu, it will ask for a partitioning method. The easy way is to select \"use free space\" option. well, if you want to set up the partitioning manually, select \"Something else\" option. then create two partitions as follows.

I am thinking of buying a printer, and the ones that I am looking for connect to a computer/laptop with WiFi. \nDo I need WiFi or can I connect with the printer in another way?\n\nA: If you have a wifi router and several machines, you can connect the printer to the router via wifi and the other machines connected to the same LAN (same subnet will be easier) via ethernet cable will be able to use the printer.\nIf you have a network with no wifi and the printer can only connect via wifi (very unusual), you won't be able to connect to it.\nIf your router has no wifi and you have a machine with wifi, you can connect the printer to this machine and share it from there but this is not the best way as your machine will need to be always on (and working).\nIf you have a router with an USB port and no wifi, almost certainly, the printer will have an USB port and you can use it to connect to the router and share it to the network.\nIf you have only one machine, you can use wifi if available on your machine but almost certainly your printer will have an USB connection available too.\n\nA: You can connect using WIFI but I myself have yet to see any printer that does not include also a method to use either ethernet (this is mainly for network printers) or USB (do not forget about that one since it is the most common method). \nThe question is ehmmmm somewhat wrong: the usage of internet has nothing to do with the ability to use a printer. Yes you can have printers that need the router that is used for internet connectivity but those are mainly network printers (those tend to have an ethernet connection). \nThe general method for printing from a desktop/notebook is to use USB or WIFI but this is directly from desktop/notebook to the printer (the printer has USB, system has USB, plug in an USB cable and the printer should be detected (of course WIFI even does not require a cable)). Just pick one others on the web marked as Linux compatible.\n\nA: It depends if the wifi and ethernet are on the same network or not. If your wifi is supplied through an access point on the same network as the ethernet one you shouldn't have problems.\nSo in short, you can check the ip addresses of your printer and your computer and the first three numbers should be identical. Example: 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.245 are on the same network; 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.1.245 are not on the same network.\n", "Q: how to capture scroll window in ubuntu In windows we can capture scrolled window using the software SNAGIT \nIs there a software or utility that can be used to capture the entire page.\n\nA: Have you tried gnome-screenshot ?

Then type Software - the first thing that pops up is the Ubuntu Software Center - you use this to search for and install new programs (games, office suites, IDEs for programming, etc.)\n\nA: To change the \"cursor theme\" in Ubuntu, install Ubuntu Tweak:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\nubuntu-tweak\n\nThen, select \"Tweaks\" and then \"Themes\".

Right now, I'm trying to use xdotool and xclip:\nxdotool type \"$(xclip -o)\"\n\nThis command works if I stay in a terminal window, and type that command myself. It types back my clipboard contents when I run the command.  My goal is to bind this command to a hotkey, so that it works in any application. \n\nIf I use this hotkey, unexpected behavior occurs to whatever window has focus. e.g. my terminal window size shrinks (it's somewhat amusing, actually).  Similar results occur if I save it as a script and call the script, or if I encapsulate the command with sh -c. How can I make practical use of the powerful xdotool type command?\n\nA: xdotool creates keypresses, and it won't release the Ctrl key for you... The simplest solution is to add a delay, eg sleep 0.5 to wait for half a second, and to make sure you release Ctrl fast enough.\n\nA: sh -c 'xdotool type --clearmodifiers -- \"$(xclip -o -selection clipboard)\"'\n\"--clearmodifiers\" gets rid of CTRL/ALT/Shift etc, hopefully meaning the sleep is not required\n\"--\" means end of xdotool options so that if the pasted test begins with - xdotool will not try to interpret it as an option\n\nA: You have two problems with this command. The first is that you need to make sure that the meta-keys in the binding are not pressed when it tries to run the command.  Second, by default xclip selects XA_Primary buffer rather than the XA_CLIPBOARD.  So you should pass clipboard as the selection parameter for xclip. Change your hotkey command to the following:\nsh -c 'sleep 0.5; xdotool type \"$(xclip -o -selection clipboard)\"'\n\n\nA: Actually there are two buffers accessible with Ctrl+V (the clipboard copy-paste) and Shift+Insert (the mouse mark and middle-click paste).\nIf you have the sessions appropriately connected to share clipboard, then one of the two should work automatically, no?\n", "Q: not able to change volume in ubuntu 12.04 I am using Ubuntu 12.04\nI am unable to change volume and the devices are not shown in sound setting in root ,\nbut in guest session ,it is working well. \n\nA: First, goto \"System Settings\", then, \"Sound\", under the Hardware category.

Under Wired you should see a connection named Auto eth0 as seen below.\n\nClick Edit from the right and enter your password and you should see a window similar to the one below.\n\nNow change the method to Automatic (DHCP) addresses only and down the bottom next to DNS servers enter 8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4 as seen below. These are DNS servers provided by Google and are very reliable.\n\nNow click Save down the bottom and lastly lets restart your network connections to make sure we are using the new settings. The easiest way is to turn your network off and on again as seen in the image below.

Easiest to inspect this is to set a cron job as follows:\n* * * * * set > /tmp/environment.log\n\n# | | |  \\day of week    0-7 (0 or 7 is Sun, or use names)\n# | |  \\--month          1-12 (or names, see below)\n# |  \\----day of month   1-31\n#  \\------hour           0-23\n#\\--------minute         0-59\n\nFor the syntax of the crontab itself check man 5 crontab.\nThen wait for a minute and remove the cronjob again, because otherwise this nonsense job will run every minute.\nThen check the difference between the interactive shell (just type set) and the cronjob (just type cat /tmp/environment). Especially PATH and SHELL may surprise you.\n\nA: If you are interested in scheduling tasks as a normal user account in Ubuntu (i.e. you're not doing system-wide things as root), then you should skip all the specifics of cron, crontab, at, and anacron.\nInstead, look at the Scheduled Tasks application available in Ubuntu via the Unity Dash or similar applications menu.  It vastly simplifiies the work of scheduling items.  There are some \"gotchas\" related to its use, but this way you don't have to do anything in the command line.\nFor example, I have a little backup script that I run periodically using Scheduled Tasks.  (The program basically inserts items into your crontab, etc.)\nScheduled Tasks provides two different views. One view is simplified, like this:\n\nThe other view shows what the crontab would show:\n\nOne of the \"gotchas\" is that your normal \"PATH\" is not available for a specific scheduled item, so you need to be explicit about what command is to be run.\nAnyway, the details of cron, crontab, at, and anacron are all a bit too broad to be Ubuntu-specific.  \n", "Q: Default keys \"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0\" to input \"! @ # $ % ^ & * ( )\" Doing math homework on a full keyboard.

The easiest way to get your desired result is to create a new layout by copying an existing one. Choose the one you are using at moment (you can have a look inside the files to find see the user friendly name of a layout). So for English (US) type\nsudo cp /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us_math\n\ninto a terminal window. Now you have to edit the key specifications of the number keys. Open the file for editing, for example:\ngksudo gedit /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us_math\n\nSearch for the layout variant you are using, in the case of English (US) you will find it at the beginning of the file:\nname[Group1]= \"English (US)\";\n\nChange this text to:\nname[Group1]= \"English (math)\";\n\nBelow you see the definition of the particular keys. Change (or insert, if you are using a variant that doesn't explicitly define these keys) the entires for keys AE01 to AE10. In our example we would replace\nkey <AE01> {    [     1,    exclam      ]   };\nkey <AE02> {    [     2,    at      ]   };\nkey <AE03> {    [     3,    numbersign  ]   };\nkey <AE04> {    [     4,    dollar      ]   };\nkey <AE05> {    [     5,    percent     ]   };\nkey <AE06> {    [     6,    asciicircum ]   };\nkey <AE07> {    [     7,    ampersand   ]   };\nkey <AE08> {    [     8,    asterisk    ]   };\nkey <AE09> {    [     9,    parenleft   ]   };\nkey <AE10> {    [     0,    parenright  ]   };\n\nby\nkey <AE01> {    [     exclam,   1   ]   };\nkey <AE02> {    [     at,       2   ]   };\nkey <AE03> {    [     numbersign,   3   ]   };\nkey <AE04> {    [     dollar,   4   ]   };\nkey <AE05> {    [     percent,  5   ]   };\nkey <AE06> {    [     asciicircum,  6   ]   };\nkey <AE07> {    [     ampersand,    7   ]   };\nkey <AE08> {    [     asterisk, 8   ]   };\nkey <AE09> {    [     parenleft,    9   ]   };\nkey <AE10> {    [     parenright,   0   ]   };\n\nThis will give you access to the special keys without using Shift and by Shift-ing you will be able to write numbers if you like to. Now edit anything else you like and save and close the file.\nIn the last step we will register the new keyboard layout with Gnome so you will be able to select it from the System settings.\nTherefore open /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/endev.xml in the text editor of your choice, f.e.:\ngksudo gedit /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.xml\n\nFind the text <layoutList> and insert the following description directly after it:\n<layout>\n  <configItem>\n    <name>us_math</name>\n\n    <shortDescription>en_math</shortDescription>\n    <description>English (math)</description>\n    <languageList>\n      <iso639Id>eng</iso639Id>\n    </languageList>\n  </configItem>\n</layout>\n\nAfter saving the file you have to restart the X server.

I was thinking about buying a Raspberry Pi, and running Ubuntu on it. I have looked around the web, and a lot of stuff says that it's difficult for it to work on ARM processors. Has anyone figured out how to get a Raspberry pi to run Ubuntu?\n\nA: From the Official FAQ Page at Raspberry Pi:\n\nWhat Linux distros will be supported at launch?\nFedora, Debian and ArchLinux will be supported from the start. We hope\nto see support from other distros later. (Because of issues with newer\nreleases of Ubuntu and the ARM processor we are using, Ubuntu can’t\ncommit to support Raspberry Pi at the moment.) You will be able to\ndownload distro images from us as soon as the Raspberry Pi is\nreleased, and we will also be selling pre-loaded SD cards shortly\nafter release.\n\n\nSource: My answer on Raspberry Pi SE\n\nEDIT\nIt seems that since the launch of Raspberry Pi 2, Snappy Ubuntu Core can be run on RP2.\n\nThanks to a very successful collaboration between the Raspberry Pi Foundation and Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, we are pleased to announce that Snappy Ubuntu Core is available for the Raspberry Pi 2, the latest Raspberry Pi family member.\n\n*\n\n*Snappy Ubuntu Core on Raspberry Pi 2 | Ubuntu Insights\n\nHowever, it should be noted for the anxious that this is not a desktop version of Ubuntu.\n\nA: Raspberry Pi preinstalled Ubuntu 20.10 Desktop and preinstalled Ubuntu 20.10 Server images are available from ubuntu.com. The preinstalled images allow you to unpack a preinstalled version of Ubuntu onto a target device.\nThe Ubuntu Raspberry Pi wiki is the most reliable and up-to-date source for information about installing Ubuntu on the Raspberry Pi, but the Ubuntu image for Raspberry Pi linked to at the Ubuntu Raspberry Pi wiki is not an officially supported Ubuntu release. An Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr) image is available for the Raspberry Pi 2, which combines the released 14.04 distribution with a PPA containing kernels and firmware which work on the Raspberry Pi 2. The instructions for installing this image are at the same webpage.\nOfficial images\narmhf\n\n*\n\n*Raspberry Pi 2: ubuntu-18.04-preinstalled-server-armhf+raspi2.img.xz (4G image, 296MB compressed)\n\n\n*Raspberry Pi 3: The official Raspberry Pi 2 images can be used with a Pi 3B/3B+ after minor changes (see instructions).\n\n\n*Ubuntu MATE for Raspberry Pi 2/3\n\n\n*Raspberry Pi 4: You can install Ubuntu Server + desktop environment (optional) on a Raspberry Pi 4 by following the instructions in this answer.\n\n\n*Further releases can be found at http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/releases/\narm64\nThe generic arm64 ISO images can be used with the Raspberry Pi 3. Instructions for booting these are here.\nCanonical has released official [Ubuntu Core 16 and Core 18 images for Raspberry Pi 3. The instructions for installing it are at Install Ubuntu Core on a Raspberry Pi 2 or 3. As the wiki says: Snappy Ubuntu Core is a new rendition of Ubuntu with transactional updates - a minimal server image with the same libraries as today’s Ubuntu, but applications are provided through a simpler mechanism.\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Core 16 is based on Ubuntu 16.04, and is supported for 5 years.\n\n\n*Ubuntu Core 18 is based on Ubuntu 18.04, and is supported for 10 years.\nA new release of Ubuntu Core is released every 2 years on even numbered years (2016, 2018, etc.).\nUbuntu MATE 16.04 has fully working bluetooth and wifi on the Raspberry Pi 3.\nRaspberry Pi packages\nAlthough the majority of the Raspberry Pi cloud/server image works like any other Ubuntu system, there are a few packages in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu that you may not be familiar with.\n\n*\n\n*linux-firmware-raspi2 - GPU firmware bootloader files and WiFi firmware configuration files\n\n*linux-raspi2 (linux-image-raspi2) - Linux kernel with patches from https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux\n\n*u-boot-rpi - Provides the various uboot* binaries under /boot/firmware\n\n*flash-kernel - Automatically copies the latest kernel, dtb file and u-boot script to the Pi's FAT-formatted GPU firmware partition.\n\n\nA: Based on the latest update on the official website's FAQ:\n\n...\n  Raspbian (based on Debian), Arch Linux, and Pidora run on the\n  Raspberry Pi 1, 2, and 3. Ubuntu MATE and Ubuntu Snappy Core also run\n  on Pi 2 and 3 only.\n  ...\n\n\nA: Some complications with ARM are a common issue for all distributions, they are not always Ubuntu-specific.  They stem from the fact that ARM has a number of different architectures, offering limited to no compatibility between each other.\nThe leading Linux ARM distributions are the following (excluding Gentoo which by definition is compiled to the exact target), and I am listing the corresponding target architecture:\nUbuntu: ARMv7 and up, thumb 2 (32 bit)\nDebian: ARMv4t and up (armel), ARMv7 and up (armhf)\nFedora: ARMv5tel (arm) ARMv7hl (armhf)\nArch Linux: ARMv5te or higher\n\nTo your specific question, the original Raspberry PI runs a BCM2835 (ARM1176JZF-S) Broadcom CPU. This is armv6k architecture, which is not compatible with recent builds of Ubuntu, which are optimized for performance at the expense of compatibility with older chip designs like this Broadcom's.\nThe obvious choice is to run the armel architecture of Debian -- you will feel almost at home as if you were on Ubuntu.\nRevisiting this a few years later, there are now many models of R.PI available on the market:\nRaspberry PI A, B, A+, B+, Zero, and Zero W: These are not compatible with Ubuntu ARM builds, as they use the BCM2835 Broadcom CPU (ARM v6k).\nRaspberry PI 2, model B: this runs a BCM2836 Broadcom CPU. This is ARMv7 architecture, a Cortex A7 to be precise. This board (and presumably all subsequent \"series 2\" R.PI boards) will run Ubuntu just fine.\nRaspberry PI 3, model A+, B, B+: these run on a BCM2837 Broadcom CPU. This is ARMv8 architecture, a Cortex-A53 64-bit chip to be exact. These board are a superior option over any R.PI 2 boards when it comes to running Ubuntu. Revision 1.2 of the Raspberry PI 2 uses this same 64 bit core, making the newer PI 2 boards significantly better than the original version.\nRaspberry PI 4, model B: this one is based on the BCM2711, a Quad core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit chip almost thrice as fast as the SoC in PI model 3 boards. This board is now the best option to run Ubuntu on Raspberry PI.\nCanonical has released Ubuntu Core (aka \"Snappy\") for the R.PI 2, but it bears noting this is a server distribution with no desktop environment. Additionally, standard Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04 server images that can be expanded to include a desktop environment are available for R.PI 2 and R.PI 3. Ubuntu MATE is now also available for Raspberry PI.\nFinally, starting with 20.04, official Ubuntu Desktop images are available for Raspberry PI. As long as Raspbian continues to ship a 32-bit userland, Ubuntu 20.04+ should be considered the best fully 64-bit option for Raspberry Pi.\nAll current Raspberry PI images are linked from this page on the Ubuntu wiki.\n\nA: Currently not - Canonical only support ARM's ARMv7 processor architecture and the Pi has an ARMv6 chip.\n\nA: If you are considering purchasing a new Raspberry Pi 4 don't be dissuaded by articles stating Ubuntu doesn't support it. From:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 19.10 delivers Kubernetes at the edge, multi-cloud infrastructure economics and an integrated AI/ML developer experience\nIt states:\n\nThe Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is supported by Ubuntu 19.10. The latest\n  board from the Raspberry Pi Foundation offers a faster\n  system-on-a-chip with a processor that uses the Cortex-A72\n  architecture (quad-core 64-bit ARMv8 at 1.5GHz) and offers up to 4GB\n  of RAM. With the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, developers get access to a\n  low-cost board, powerful enough to orchestrate workloads at the edge\n  with MicroK8s.\n\n", "Q: Can I delete my home folder to start fresh? and if I can how?\nI'm using Gnome Shell\nIf that matters\n\nA: Yes you can.

One exception is files inside /tmp, which are owned by the user that created them. However, /tmp itself is owned by root, but is writable by anyone (permissions 777).\nThe other exception is files inside /proc, but the contents of this directory are created by the kernel and you don't need to alter the permissions of anything inside.\nTo fix permissions, boot into recovery mode, CD to /, and run:\nchown root:root -R *\n\nThen CD to /home and fix each home directory:\n chown <user>:<user> -R <home_dir>\n\n", "Q: Is there way to boot from Windows by default?

Could anyone point me to a solution to this problem?\n\nA: This is caused by this bug. The bug has been fixed, but in order to apply the fix to the bug you will have to successfully boot first. In order to do so, you need to blacklist the gma500_gfx module when you boot to install the updates.\nIn GRUB, add the kernel parameter gma500_gfx.blacklist=yes as a boot parameter, as per https://askubuntu.com/a/204261/12188 .

The idea is just to be used for a small team (maximum 10 persons) that will have constant access by SSH to the main projects and could add features with Git, and will, as well, have their own directory (with VirtualHost configured) for their own personal projects.\nEverything is configured and running, but my question is :\nWhat is the best solution here for everyone to work? It is to have them on the http group and then all have access as normal users to the /var/www folder (that also contains GitWeb and Drupal), or would be to create a new user named after the project (as an example) where only those with the password could have access to work (configured with VirtualHost).\nNotice: The idea is to have 1 person responsible of the server directly (since he is the one who is hosting it), 2 more people that will have access to the root from their home in order to configure anything from their home, plus anyone else that joins the group without any root access, but just the necessary access to create personal works and work with Git.\n\nA: Your solution will probably work okay. You just need to make sure that Apache is able to read the files in /var/www.\nAs an alternative, you can always install apache2-mpm-itk, which will allow you to configure virtual hosts running as users other than the one that Apache runs as (normally www-data). More info about apacke2-mpm-itk here.\n\nA: The best solution is not to have anyone but the server administrator ssh or remote into the machine.  Instead, have each developer work on their own machine, and each person just does git pull/push to fetch code from the central server branch.   That way, the work that each person does is completely independent except when they are merging changes from others.   Git will take care of all of the permissions, all you would need to do is make sure every developer has a login account to use. \nPlease refer to the \"Using git for collaboration\" section of this document:\nhttp://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html\nYou may also be interested in the \"Distributed workflows\" section of this document:\nhttp://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitworkflows.html \n\nA: There are 2 separate questions, one about setting up Apache and another about setting up git.\nRegarding Apache: there is no need to give access to /var/www to everyone, Apache supports per-user web directories, so, after you enable per-user directories with a single line in the config, users should be able to add files to public_html directory in their home directory and have it served at http://example.com/~username/\nRegarding Git: the trick here is to add all users into a group and then make sure the repository on the server is created with --shared flag and is owned by that group. I'm using a script for that:\n#!/bin/bash\nREPONAME=$1\nBASE=/var/www/git\n\necho \"Creating new repository: \" $1\nmkdir $BASE/$REPONAME\ncd $BASE/$REPONAME\ngit --bare init --shared\ngit update-server-info\nchown -R apache:apache $BASE/$REPONAME\necho \"Done.\"\necho \"SSH clone URL is ssh://example.com/www/git/$REPONAME\"\n\nSuch repository needs to be created by a super-admin user, but after that everyone will be able to push and pull from it.

There appear to be two types of Ubuntu installations: 'live' installations (typically USB or CD) and what I'm going to call 'full' installations (typically on an internal HDD).\nFull installations can use \"Startup Disk Creator\" to create live installations, and live installations ask if you would like to try Ubuntu or install to a hard drive, creating 'full' installations.\nHow can I create another 'full' installation on another partition/disk, without creating an intermediate bootable 'live' medium? This seems like it should be simple.\nExample Scenario:\nA computer with four partitions: swap, /home, / , and one blank. Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop is currently installed on partition 3.

How do I perform a full (not 'live') install of 12.04-server to the fourth partition without buying a USB stick or CD drive?\n\nA: If you mean to do this in the same way that Archlinux is installed, there is the debootstrap command which may be of help.\nYou can create the necessary partition with cfdisk (or gparted) then format it correctly (probably ext4) and mount it.  You should then run debootstrap and chroot into the formatted partition before using aptitude to finish the installation.\nI'm not exactly sure which packages ubuntu 12.04-server installs as part of the base installation, so I can't tell you exactly what you need to install with aptitude.

So I am looking to accomplish a full install with only the use of wubi\n\nA: What you are trying to accomplish is impossible. The WUBI runs from inside Windows. It creates a virtual partition in a big file inside Windows partition (such as C:). The bootloader is tricked to look inside the Windows partition for the Ubuntu partition that is actually a file.\nBy destroy Windows 8 if you mean to reformat the Windows partition, then you will lose your Ubuntu installation as well.

I use the combination of Flashgot and wget for downloads. I reset my Firefox preferences due to some other problems.

But before resetting the settings, I could download items to \"Downloads\". \nWhat should I do to make the default directory of wget to \"Downloads\"? \n\nA: wget by default will store downloads to the current directory where you run the wget command.\n\nMethod 1: Pass the -P option to specify a download directory\n\n\n*\n\n*To change the directory, you need to add the -P argument in your wget command:\nwget -P /path/to/directory <download-url>\n\nOr\nwget --directory-prefix=prefix <download-url>\n\nwhere prefix is the directory where you want the downloads to be stored.\nWith this method, you need to specify the -P or --directory-prefix=prefix every time you download.\n\nMethod 2: Use alias to make a permanent default directory\n\n\n*\n\n*To set a permanent default download directory, you can use alias, like this:\nalias wget='wget --directory-prefix=prefix'\n\nChange prefix with the directory you want and put the alias command on .bashrc to make it permanent.\n\nA: As far as I was aware wget usually downloads into the current working directory. You have the following options to specify the directory.\n1.Change to the directory you wish it to be downloaded to first then run your wget command.\ncd /home/yourname/Downloads\n\nThen run your wget command\nwget http://download.files.com/software/files.tar.gz\n\n2.Add the directory to the wget command like this.\nwget -P /home/yourname/Downloads http://download.files.com/software/files.tar.gz  \n\n", "Q: Require password to login to Nexus 7 The default behavior in the Nexus 7 Image is to log straight in to the default user's desktop, bypassing the lightdm greeter.

This has the added benefit (in my case) of not messing with the system's folders, as my Ubuntu knowledge levels are fairly low and I worry about what I might be screwing up when I mess with system stuff.  If you are also low level please note that the \".\" in the directory name makes it a hidden directory.\n\nA: A previous answer mentions the command gio trash, which is fine as far as it goes. However, on server machines, there is no equivalent of a trash directory. I've written a Bash script that does the job; on (Ubuntu) desktop machines, it uses gio trash. (I've added alias tt='move-to-trash' to my alias definitions file; tt is a mnemonic for \"to trash\".) The script is tested to work; I use it all the time myself. Script updated on 2020-08-10.\n#!/bin/bash\n#\n# move-to-trash\n#\n# Teemu Leisti 2020-08-10\n#\n# This script moves the files given as arguments to the trash directory, if they\n# are not already there. It works both on (Gnome) desktop and server hosts. (The\n# gio command only exists for Gnome.)\n#\n# The script is intended as a command-line equivalent of deleting a file from a\n# graphical file manager, which, in the usual case, moves the deleted file(s) to\n# a built-in trash directory. On server hosts, the analogy is not perfect, as\n# the script does not offer the functionality of restoring a trashed file to its\n# original location, nor that of emptying the trash directory; rather, it offers\n# an alternative to the 'rm' command, giving the user the peace of mind that\n# they can still undo an unintended deletion before emptying the trash\n# directory.\n#\n# To determine whether it's running on a desktop host, the script tests for the\n# existence of the gio command and of directory ~/.local/share/Trash. In case\n# both exist, the script relies on the 'gio trash' command. Otherwise, it treats\n# the host as a server.\n#\n# There is no built-in trash directory on server hosts, so the script creates\n# directory ~/.Trash/, unless it already exists.\n#\n# The script appends a millisecond-resolution time stamp to all the files it\n# moves to the trash directory, both to inform the user of the time of the\n# deletion, and to avoid overwrites when moving a file to trash.\n#\n# The script will not choke on a nonexistent file.

First I used the simple:\n$ cp .emacs Dropbox/.emacs\n\nthen I tried using rsync (or gsync), well it works but I cannot grasp the difference between rsync and cp for this very simple backup. In fact, even if I have activated the option RSYNC_ENABLE=true in the rsync file, every time I modify the .emacs in my home I have to run the command rsync (or use gsync), as a cp, without having it automatically. How can I have it automatically?\nProbably I'm missing something from the very basics of rsync.\nThanks for your help\n\nA: You're misunderstanding what rsync does. Unlike what the name suggests, it doesn't really sync anything on its own. It works almost the same as cp, except that it when it encounters the same file on the destination, it only updates it if it has changed. That is helpful when you're copying over a network, because it can save bandwidth. It does not, however, monitor files.\nA better solution in your case is to move your .emacs directory to ~/Dropbox/.emacs, and have ~/.emacs be a symbolic link to it:\n$ mv .emacs ~/Dropbox\n$ ln -s ~/Dropbox/.emacs .emacs\n\nThen you don't need any local syncing.\n\nA: The best answer for this is to use a symbolic link. Just do the following once\nln -sn ~/.emacs ~/Dropbox/.emacs\nand it will create a link to ~/.emacs in Dropbox folder. This will be treated as a file by dropbox and synchronised. Every change you make to .emacs will automatically be synced by dropbox\n", "Q: Internet access problem in 12.10 Using ethernet connection, I cannot establish a internet connection on my chromium browser, received a DNS error (or something related to that.

In a previous version of byobu there was an option in byobu-config (via the F9 key) to create new windows which had a checkbox option to select if it was a startup option. The whole 'create new window' section of byobu-config is not there anymore!\nI've tried adding the details of the windows I want to ~/.byobu/windows (below) but this has had no effect.\nscreen -t localhost bash\nscreen -t staging ssh dt123\nscreen -t fsuk1 ssh fs\nscreen -t php php -a\nscreen -t python bpython\n\n\nA: As @Jorge Castro mentioned in a comment, the reason your ~/.byobu/windows configuration isn't working is because byobu is now based on tmux (the \"Terminal Multiplexer\"). As mentioned by @Hai Vu, there is a workaround that allows you to use screen as byobu's backend, but it isn't overly complicated to switch to tmux. \nYou'll want to edit the .tmux.conf file located in your user's .byobu folder (~/.byobu/.tmux.conf). Here you will want to write commands to construct your terminal windows using the commands found in the tmux manual. Here is a simple example that can help get you started:\nnew-window -ad -n Git\nnew-window -ad -n \"Project Build/Run\"\nnew-window -ad -n PostgreSQL\n\nHere I have inserted three commands into the .tmux.conf file. As defined by the manual:\n\nThe configuration file is a set of tmux commands which are\n                     executed in sequence when the server is first started.\n\nSo in this case, when you start Byobu, you should see three pre-created windows with the titles \"Git\", \"Projected Build/Run\", and \"PostgreSQL\" (from left to right). Hope this helps.\n\nA: I found that if you run \nbyobu-select-backend\n\nand choose screen, then it works. Selecting tmux as backend does not work.

I want only acces to terminal.\n\nA: You need to setup a reverse ssh tunnel\nssh -nNT -R 1100:local.mydomain.com:22 user@remote.mydomain.com\n\nWhat this does is forwards any connections on port 1100 of the remote server to port 22 of the local system. You'd have to prepare this connection in advance, and it is not as reliable as a VPN.\nIf you want more reliability (ssh connection might get dropped), go for openvpn.\n\nA: You could set up a reverse NAT rule in your router/NAT/firewall so that any connection to your router from outside on a port will be translated to a another machines address and port in your local network.\nSo port 22 on your router could translat to port 22 on your server.  Then you just need to register in your DNS your server with the global IPv4 address of your router.\nOr you can set up IPv6 and then all your machines could have proper global adressers.  But the machine you then connect from also need to be on a IPv6 net.  Don't forget to set up firewall on your IPv6-router and your machines.  Which is quite easy to do with ufw.\n", "Q: Is Chromium GTK+ theme lighter than the others? \nOr is it heavier? What other aspects could one consider here beside aesthetics?\n\nA: I tested out my chromium install (Version 24.0.1311.0 (164559)), and it turns out that the GTK Version has a slightly higher memory footprint. \nI tested it by enabling and disabling GTK Theme, while checking the memory footprint (Shift+Esc). I had killed all extensions to make sure they didn't affect the results. I also kept only the settings page open so as not to have webkit rendering affect it either.\nMy results were:\n\n\n*\n\n*GTK Version - 157,676K\n\n*Classic Theme - 157,456K\n\n\nSo, there is a difference, but its too little to be of any relevance. \n\nA: Thnx to Capt.Nemo who showed me how to test this I made my own experiment, which should be seen as a complement to the his answer, that I'll set as definitive, in the sense that the differences are negligible: especially given that my results are different (GTK theme appears lightest)\nUsing Google Chrome 22.0.1229.94, also killed all extensions and let the help tab open\nResults were:\nGTK+theme\n\nClassic theme\n\nAluminium theme from Chrome Web Store\n\n(As a result, considering the \"Classic theme\" as a sort of \"no theme\" situation, and comparing the other two, I go for the GTK theme.)  \nAlso, it is possible that the GTK theme would give different results depending on the desktop environment. My test is made in Lubuntu 12.04 (LXDE).\n", "Q: Problems installing ubuntu 12.10 alongside windows 8 I can't install ubuntu on my computer (Asus ux31 with windows 8), the primary reason is that I cannot boot from any usb device with the new windows called \"uefi\". \nDo you guys have an solution for this?\nI apreciate the help!\n\nA: First, UEFI is not a \"new Windows;\" it's a new firmware that's in the process of replacing the 30-year-old BIOS. See the Wikipedia article on UEFI for details.\nThere are a number of possible causes for your problem. The easiest one to solve is that you simply need to select the boot device using a boot menu. On my ASUS P8H77-I motherboard, this menu can be accessed by pressing F8 as the computer starts up. (As soon as you power on, start repeatedly tapping F8.) It's possible you'll need to use another key, though. Using it should produce a boot menu that gives you boot options. If you have trouble getting the menu, try again; it can be finicky. Be sure to select the boot option for your USB drive that includes the string \"UEFI\" or \"EFI,\" otherwise you're likely to install in BIOS mode, which will cause further problems down the line.\nAnother possibility is that your problem is with a specific UEFI feature called Secure Boot. Microsoft is requiring computers that bear a Windows 8 logo to ship with Secure Boot enabled, but this blocks other OS installations. Linux distribution maintainers have announced plans to work around this obstacle, but I don't know offhand if they were implemented in time for Ubuntu 12.10's release. If not, you'll need to do something about it yourself. The only practical solution at the moment is to disable Secure Boot in your computer's firmware. To do this, you'll need to enter the setup utility, locate the option, and disable it. On my ASUS P8H77-I motherboard, you'd press Del during the boot process to enter the setup utility. Once in, pressing F7 enters Advanced mode, which is necessary to get at the options. Enter the Boot menu and select the Security Boot Parameters option, which reveals additional options to enable or disable Secure Boot. My motherboard shipped with Secure Boot disabled, so I'm not sure exactly what you'll see, but my hunch is you'd want to change OS Type from Windows 8 UEFI to Other Legacy & UEFI. Of course, all this assumes that you'll see the same menus in your ASUS UX31 computer as I see in my ASUS P8H77-I motherboard. That's not really a safe assumption; you may need to improvise. In the future, major distributions will ship with installers and boot loaders that will work with Secure Boot, and additional boot loader programs will exist to help work around the trouble that this feature causes. (Note that Secure Boot has real potential to solve some security problems, particularly in Windows 8. Although conspiracy theories abound concerning Secure Boot, I'm unconvinced by them.)\n", "Q: \"waiting for network configuration\" Problem This problem happens sometimes when ubuntu starts up. You can't really boot to the interface sometimes.\nSplash Screen with the 5 dots and a message saying:\n\nwaiting for network configuration\n\nfollowed by:\n\nwaiting an additional 60 seconds for network configuration\n\n\nA: I decided to go the CLI and Alt+Ctrl+F2 approach so YOU ARE FREE to do that while you are logged in to the GUI  - Okay, I will write the general steps so feel free to use whatever approach you like.\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/network/interfaces:\nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you are typing this from LXTerminal while logged in to the GUI then:\ngksudo leafpad /etc/network/interfaces\n\n\n\n*Remove whatever written there and just keep this:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nIt is very good idea to keep a backup copy of \"interfaces\" file just in case so please make sure to save a \"interfaces.bak\" file before you do anything \n\n\n*Ctrl + O if you are using nano and Ctrl + S (File > Save) if you are using leafpad.\n\n*Ctrl + X if you are using nano and Ctrl + Q (File > Quit) if you are using leafpad.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n*Done.\n\nA: In every situation that I have run into this it is a problem in /etc/network/interfaces\nYou should not have to remove everything as suggested in an earlier post, but rather inspect for common problems.\nIn my case it was defining the gateway parameter for additional ethernet IPS.  You only need to define the gateway for the primary interface for each card.\nWhat I mean by this is if your file looks like this:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n  address 10.0.0.5\n  netmask 255.255.255.0\n  network 10.0.0.0\n  gateway 10.0.0.1\n\nauto eth0:0\niface eth0:0 inet static\n  address 10.0.0.6\n  netmask 255.255.255.0\n  network 10.0.0.0\n  #gateway 10.0.0.1\n\nThe 2nd gateway param will cause ubuntu to hang for 60+ secs during boot, you only need to define the gateway for the first eth0 section, you DO need to define the gateway for any additional nic cards, IE eth1, wlan0 etc but NOT for additional IPS assigned to the same nic.  Earlier version of Ubuntu did not have any issues with this, but Ubuntu 12.04 does not like it...  Be nice if it could simply ignore it.\nI'm sure there are other \"problems\" in this file that can cause this, so you should inspect the file and make sure there are no typos etc.\n\nA: This might help too:\nhttp://tech.pedersen-live.com/2012/05/disable-waiting-for-network-configuration-messages-on-ubuntu-boot/\nBasically you edit this /etc/init/failsafe.conf file and disable (comment) the sleep commands which actually pause the system. Besides accomplishing the job, at least in my case there was no error at all in the network configuration, so everything went fine.\nBy the way, you solution only allows to configure the loopback interface, something I could not afford in my setup (I had to manually setup the interfaces and bridges).\n\nA: The real(!) solution to this problem is following command:\nsudo sed -i.old-`date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S` '/^auto lo$/!s/^auto /allow-hotplug /' /etc/network/interfaces\n\nIn /etc/network/interfaces this changes all interfaces (except lo) from auto to allow-hotplug.  This way the boot is no more waiting for the interfaces to come up first.\n\nWarning:  After this change a permanently connected interface might stay down after boot until systemd receives a real plug event.  See Notes below.\n\nExample before (look at auto eth0):\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# The primary network interface\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nExample after (look at allow-hotplug eth0):\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# The primary network interface\nallow-hotplug eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you mount network shares in /etc/fstab, use auto and not allow-hotplug for the interface to the network shares.  Else you might see strange things happen on boot process, because network must be available prior to network share mounts. allow-hotplug does not ensure this.\n\n*If the interfaces are in auto mode, you express: \"These interfaces are crucial for boot, so we must wait for them to come up before we have booted.\"  Hence, if they do not come up, Ubuntu delays the boot with failsafe, waiting for them to appear for up to 120 seconds.  And this is the right thing to do.\nIn contrast, Interfaces which are set to allow-hotplug tell Ubuntu, that they are optional.  Hence they are not essential to boot.\n\n*Ubuntu records which interfaces are available at install time, and assumes, that they are important for later operation.  This is a conservative choice, in case the interface is later needed because some Service binds to it, as such services fail to start if they miss the interface being up.\n\n*There also is a kernel setting which allows processes to bind to nonexistent IPs, so you can always use allow-hotplug if you like, without harming the stability of the boot process.  However, this is a completely different story.\nNotes (update 2018-01-04):\n\n\n*\n\n*At my side, allow-auto does the same as auto, so it does not help (tried with br0).\n\n*After upgrading one of my systems to Debian Stretch and switching to SystemD, boot became unbearably delayed while waiting for the (permanently connected outside) interface br0 to come up.  However with allow-hotplug  the interface br0 stayed down after boot.  Perhaps this is caused by SystemD not receiving any real or synthetic plug event on such an interface.  I did not dig deeper into this, as some obscure crontab entry @reboot /sbin/ifup br0 for root fixed it for me.  (This works, but probably is something, which better should not be recommended to others.  I'd like to hear if somebody has some better idea.)\n((Text ends here, the rest is for your entertainment))\nAnd here is a bed time story, inspired by this:\nSome crops farmers went on rampage.  Their crops dried out!  So they\ninvestigated why there was not enough water in the irrigation ditch. \nIn the nearer distcance they immediately spotted their culprit.  The\ndam!  The damned dam held up all the water!\nFrom this moment on it was clear what to do.  \"Blow up the dam!\" they\nyelled and started to collect their dynamite.  Then they all headed\nstraight for the dam.\nThe little son of one of the farmers asked his father about\nwhat was going on.  He told his son: \"There's not enough water in\nthe ditch, so we blow up the dam!\"  Then he immediately left to\nfollow the pack.\n\"But\", the little one tried to shout after his father, \"But there is a\nvalve!  Just open the valve!\"  Sadly, his voice was too gentle, and\nhis legs were too short, so this message did not reach anybody.\nThe boy sat down and cried.  Half an hour later he heared the distant \"Boom\" which destroyed his favorite plaground at the dam, where the valve was located, too.\nWhat happened next?\nThe Flood swept away all the precious crops.\nThe bank took away the boy's father's farm.\nHis father was unable to pay for a good school.  So the boy joined the army to get a higher education.  There he learned everything about the phyics of explosives and now tries to invent a blast resitant dam.\nWhat has this story to do with this here?\n\n\n*\n\n*The crops farmers are the other answers.\n\n*The little boy is this answer here.\n\n*The dam is the Ubuntu failsafe sleeping.\n\n*The valve is the proper interface setting.\n\n*The water is the boot process.\n\n*The crops is your Ubuntu OS.\n\n*And the filled ditch is, how the boot process should look like.\n\n\nThe setting of the interface, which lives in /etc/network/interfaces, is blown up with the sleep in failsafe removed, and even if somebody sees the closed valve (auto), nobody spottet that it could be openend as well!\n\nA: I had a similar problem.  By running ifconfig -a, I determined that the only network devices on my computer were p4p1 and lo.  There was no eth0.\nSo I edited /etc/network/interfaces, replacing all instances of eth0 with p4p1.  The file's contents are now:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto p4p1\niface p4p1 inet dhcp\n\nAfter rebooting, the networking was working fine.\nIf it matters, I was using Ubuntu 12.04.5 Server edition.\n\nA: Add a # in the /etc/init/failsafe.conf file in front of all lines containing sleep <n>. Doing so would help to boot fast.\nThis would lead to a faster boot, and it would not fix any issues with the /etc/network/interfaces file. Fixing issues with the /etc/network/interfaces file is not the purpose of /etc/init/failsafe.conf file.\nThere are situations where you want the network interface to not work (i.e. have a laptop that only has the eth0 interface (wired connection) plugged in some of the time). I don't want to have to wait 2 extra minutes for my laptop to boot because I don't have the wired connection plugged in.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 directory is full and won't boot I tried to restore some permanently deleted files from my external hard drive the other day, but I didn't take into account the fact that my home folder had not so much free space left and now it's full.\nIt appeared to have no problem at the time but when I turned off the laptop and tried to boot in Ubuntu again it just stays in the boot screen and says something like \"swap error\". Tried to delete those restored files through windows but everything I've tried so far does not work since they have write protection.\nAny suggestions? Is this actually the problem, that my home folder is full? \n\nA: Looks like your swap area partition has been deleted, you might have lost the boot menu, the best solution, I think is to partition another partition for grub and install a grub loader.

The fact that the name is \"personal package archive\" and the fact that they're created under my launchpad username make it seem like I should have all of my projects in one PPA - would that cause problems?  What if it's multiple similar/related packages, such as unity lenses?\nThe instructions don't really say anything about how much to put in a single PPA, though they do indicate having more than one is okay.  \n\nA: There is no need to create multiple PPAs, unless it's necessary. For example, daily builds, and stable releases, of the same project (same package) would need to be separate PPAs, since you can't have multiple versions of the same package, in a single archive. However, just making packages of various things you find an interest in, or as a point of staging packages you wish to propose for inclusion in the Ubuntu or Debian archives, does not require multiple PPAs.\nThe best thing you can do is organize in a way that minimizes any potential damage to users' systems who decide to add your PPA. Packaging of libraries and applications that exist in Ubuntu already, can greatly increase potential for damage, especially if you start adding extra patches and such.\n\nA: I'd say its dependent on a use case and how the projects are related to each other.  If you have numerous projects separate from each other, then use different PPAs for each.  If they're all related to each other, use one PPA.\n\nA: If you look at tualatrix PPA's you will see there is a package for every project: \nhttps://launchpad.net/~tualatrix\nlists the following\n\nPersonal package archives\n\n\nPPA for Software Center\nPPA named daily for Ding Zhou\nGIMP\nFcitx Gimpanel\nGNOME Shell\nGNOME Terminal with Google Search Support\niBentu PPA\nlibnotify\nMeeGo\nNautilus\nTualatrix's Next PPA\nPPA for Personal Use\nUbuntu Tweak Stable PPA\nVPN Indicator\nWayland Unofficial PPA\n\nI would say: 1 PPA for 1 project.\n", "Q: How do I get rid of the \"Advanced Options for $OS\" GRUB menu items? I'd like to simplify my GRUB menu so it has only the installed OS's list. (In my case, the Windows that came with the machine, Ubuntu 12.10, and CentOS 6.) I see no options in /etc/default/grub that disable this. I thought it was GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY but that's not it.\nIs there a \"clean\" way to do this?\n\nA: You can uninstall all the older kernels from Ubuntu, and the \"Advanced Options\" for Ubuntu should go away at least. Possibly the same for CentOS. I don't think I've ever seen an \"Advanced Options for Windows\" selection.\nAlso, if you've got CentOS and Ubuntu both installed to disk, then there is chance they will fight over the grub install to the MBR (or wherever your grub is installed to), as well.\n", "Q: I can't install Skype on Ubuntu 11.10 from the Software Center I have my new dell inspiron 5520 factory pre installed ubuntu 11.10 i really liked it but I didnt knew any thing about it first it download or intall everything from software center after 3 days i tried installing ESET antivirus, not knowing that ubuntu doesn't need anti-virus.

Instead, specify the display in which to start kwin from tty1. Hence,\nPress Ctrl+Alt+F1 to access a terminal. Log in.\nType killall kwin. Then, type in DISPLAY=:0 kwin.\nPress Ctrl+Alt+F7 to change back to your primary display.\n\nA: In later Kubuntu/Plasma 5 kwin still hangs/crashes (especially with Intel display drivers it seems), but can be more easily restarted: just run in krunner - Alt-Space, or Alt-F2: kwin --replace\n\nOr, create a new custom shortcut for that: e.g. Trigger: Meta+K, Action, Command/URL: kwin --replace.\nIn this way kwin can be restarted with just the Meta-K shortcut.\n\nA: As described in the official Kwin documentation, a good way to go would be to try this either on a running terminal application or on a virtual console (i.e.: Ctrl+Alt+F1), :\nDISPLAY=:0 kwin --replace\n\n\nA: Press Ctrl+Alt+F1. Log in. Type killall kwin.\nPress Ctrl+Alt+F7.\nQuit all open applications until a terminal becomes visible. Hover the mouse over the terminal application. Type kwin &.\nWhat's that, no terminal application open? Tough - you'll just have to reboot.\n\nA: Shortcuts\n\n*\n\n*krunner: Alt+F2\n\n*Or: tty [number]: Ctrl+Alt+F[number]\n\nCommand\nsetsid kwin_x11 --replace &\n\n\nLegend\n\n*\n\n*setsid: creates a new session, so if the terminal is closed kwin still runs.\n\n*kwin_x11: only on x11, as in wayland the window manager holds the hole session (no way to restart without closing everything).\n\n*--replace: kills any running kwin before launching a new instance.\n\n*&: as a separate process.\n\n\nA: This actually works. It is a nasty bug but at least I can recover now. \nIn my case, there is no need to go back to the console login using ctrl+alt+f2 but using alt+f2 I can simply type killall plasma-desktop plasma-desktop and then using alt+f2 again, \nI can run plasma-desktop. Could also be used in a script of course. This way I get back my mouse and I will not lose any work. \n\nA: If restarting kwin does not help (or if e.g. you have just lost the start menu), it may be plasma. In this case plasmashell is the one to run as of KDE 5.21 (replacing the old plasma-desktop).\n\nA: Just do:\nkillall plasma-desktop\nplasma-desktop &\n\nyou could have it all in a bash script in case you need it more times,\nrecoverkde.sh:\nkillall plasma-desktop\nplasma-desktop &\n\n", "Q: Upgrading Apache to 2.2.23 on ubuntu 12.04 LTS We had done a PCI scan on one of our servers running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with apache 2.2.22.\nThe scan reported a vulnerability in apache 2.2.22 (Apache HTTP Server Zero-Length Directory Name in LD_LIBRARY_PATH Vulnerability).The report states to upgrade the version to the latest stable release of either 2.2.23 or 2.2.24.\nHow do I upgrade to the 2.2.23 to fix the vulnerability or is there a patch available that can fix this and if yes can you let me know how that can be patched.\n\nA: According to the package search for apache2 there is no package greater than 2.2.22 in the Ubuntu repos. \nHowever if you look at the specific vulnerability it is 'just' a local exploitable vulnerability which leads unauthorized disclosure of information. So it might be acceptable to wait for a fix. More information about the vulnerability can be found at the entry CVE-2012-0883.\n\nA: rmadison apache2 shows that version 2.2.22-1 is the stable version in Ubuntu 12.04. You'll have to wait for a security upgrade to be applied to the apache2 package or for it to be updated by its maintainers. \nYou won't be able to update to version 2.4 in any version of Ubuntu as it isn't in the repositories yet. I wouldn't count on 2.4 entering the precise repositories as 12.04 is LTS and packages as commonly used as apache2 aren't updated on a whim.\n\nA: Ubuntu does not backport feature releases, but just security vulnerabilities if they do have impact.\nThis specific one is considered to be negligible, according to this page. Quoting:\n\njdstrand> Debian/Ubuntu packages contain 038_no_LD_LIBRARY_PATH (see\n  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=276670 for more\n  information)\n\nSo, I suggest you can now spend your time on more useful stuff. :-)\n", "Q: Installing additional drivers resulted in command line interface Installed Ubuntu in my MacBook. It worked fine at first. Installed additional drivers and updated the restarted. Now, all I get is a command line. I can't boot back into the USB stick I originally used to install Ubuntu. Help?\n\nA: I had a similar problem after choosing the nvidia_current driver. I had my background picture displayed after logging in, but nothing else except for an error message.\nIn my case, it turned out that the nvidia_current driver had been blacklisted, so it was not loading correctly. To check if that's your problem, run the following:\ngrep nvidia_current /etc/modules /etc/modprobe.d/*\n\nI had a file called blacklist-local.conf containing the line blacklist nvidia_current. Since that was the only line in the file, I used sudo to remove it, and everything worked.\nI've raised bug #1083998 to complain that the Additional Drivers utility didn't spot the blacklist.\n", "Q: How can I install GTK themes on Ubuntu? How can I install themes in ubuntu 12.10 ? \nFor example, how can I install the following themes on ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*GrayDay \n\n*Elegant+Eggplant\n\nA: You download it, extract it to ~/.themes, and you can use ubuntu tweak tool to select the theme. I will guide you through it with the grayday theme you selected in gnome-look.org.\nJust a warning, not all themes work nicely under unity.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download grayday, and double-click it in nautilus to open it in the archive manager.

I've downloaded McAfee for Linux.\nBut I don't know how to:\nCopy pam_unix.so from /lib/security of a 32-bit Ubuntu (till version 10.10) system\nto a temporary directory /tmp on the 64-bit Ubuntu system. From Ubuntu 11.04\nonwards, pam_unix.so is available under /lib/i386-linux-gnu folder.\nDo I need to download the whole 32-bit version to get this pam_unix.so file?\n\nA: Without meaning to sound flippant, it's unlikely you'll need antivirus. Unless you're in a really high-sensitivity environment it's unlikely you'll come across a situation where you'll face a Linux virus. In any case I would recommend ClamAV as an open source antivirus product. You can install it through apt-get install clamav. \nThe majority of antivirus products I've come across - particularly Sophos antivirus - only scan for Windows viruses, and even then only do that by hashing the file. This means if a virus changes even one byte in the file which contains it, the AV product wouldn't think it's a virus any more.\n", "Q: How can I change mouse keymapping I have Razer DeathAdder(left handed edition) and A4Tech wireless mouse.

Now, with that in mind, select the id you want to use, e.g. 12, and gain the detailed readout of your device with xinput list-props 12, as you have indeed done in your third codeblock. \nNow to get the button arrangement, run\nxinput get-button-map 12\n\nwhich will get you the list of button labels, which will be a list, say probably from 1-24 in the case of your wireless mouse. The information listed with xinput list-props 12 (in your third codeblock) has a 'button labels' section and the list of button labels there (24) usually directly correlates with the list of digits given by the xinput get-button-map command. This means that 1 will refer to 'button left' from the 'button labels' information, so we need to swap 'button left' (1) and 'button right' (3). To do this, remembering to specify the device id (12), we can shorten the command to 13 digits:\nxinput set-button-map 12 3 2 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 \n\nThis method should work for any mouse, as I can confirm it works for mine.  \nThis answer may also be of interest, as it is related to xinput:\n\n\n*\n\n*Where to configure synaptics touchpad to use inverted two finger scrolling?\n\nA: Try btnx: https://launchpad.net/btnx\nI haven't used it in a while, but as i remember it, it was guided and easy to use.\n", "Q: Developing gnome shell extensions with eclipse as a IDE I would like to know whether any body has used Eclipse JavaScript support for developing gnome-exensions.

I recently blew the dust of it and wanted to upgrade to 7/Ubuntu 12.10 so I began by formatting the Ubuntu side of the partition and apparently damaged the mbr as I could only get black screen with the error message:\nGRUB loading...\nerror: no such partition\ngrub rescue>\n\nI then slaved the hdd to my win7 desktop and formatted the entire drive, both sides of the partition then reinstalled it in the Acer and tried to install win7. Upon starting the Acer I got the same error message:\nGRUB loading...\nerror: no such partition\ngrub rescue>\n\nI then tried to reinstall Ubuntu 9.10 as I have an Ubuntu produced installation cd. Same result. \nNext day I received a new battery I had ordered for the Acer. I plugged it and the power supply in and hit the power button just to see if I at least could charge the battery but to my surprise Ubuntu 9.10 began to install, so I let it and it did. Now the hard drive shows 58 gb and 2.5gb partitions neither of which is formatted NTFS for/by windows.

I am a beginner and don't know much about linux or the terminology. Thank you for your thoughts and help.\n\nA: the deal is, you don't upgrade it 9.10 to 12.10 because you can't. You have do this long way instead:\n9.10 --> 10.04 --> 12.04 --> 12.10\nof course it's MUCH easier to make a fresh install of 12.10\ninstall windows 7 first then install 12.10 is the easiest and fastest way to get your dual boot setup. \n\nA: You can't. Acer Aspire 3000 has only 256 mb of memory. Unless you have upgraded it you are not going to be able to load neither Windows 7, nor Ubuntu 12.04 on it. Both need way more memory.\nIn my experience Windows 7 needs at least 2Gb to run smoothly and Ubuntu 12.04 at least 1 Gb. Both will refuse to install with only 256 Mb.\nYou should be able to install Lubuntu, a lighter version of Ubuntu, 12.04 on it and make it usable, but even them you will be short of RAM.

My new mouse (Logitech RX250) supports a new feature - scroll wheel tilt: it feels like clicking if I lean the wheel to the left or to the right. But it does nothing. I would like to set it up to do do something (act like Home/End for example). How to do it? \n\nA: Here is how to do it:\nInstall xbindkeys: sudo apt-get install xbindkeys\nInstall xte: sudo apt-get install xautomation \ncreate the xbindkeys config file xbindkeys --defaults > $HOME/.xbindkeysrc \nnow run xev, put your mouse in the box and click the button you want to map.\nYou should get something like  \n  ButtonRelease event, serial 41, synthetic NO, window 0x4400001,\n    root 0x2e9, subw 0x4400002, time 21579213, (28,34), root:(818,86),\n    state 0x110, button 1, same_screen YES \n\nIn this case \"button 1\" is the number of the button we want to map.\nNow we need to edit xbindkeys config file.\ngedit $HOME/.xbindkeysrc\nScroll to the bottom of the file and create a new line.\nIf you want to bind 'button 1' to the 'home' key type:\n\"xte 'keydown Home' 'keyup Home'\"  \nb:1\n\n\nNow make xbindkeys start on startup.  Open startup applications. Click 'Add' put xbindkeys in the 'name' field and  /usr/bin/xbindkeys in the 'Command Field'.\n\nRestart the computer.\nThat will bind 'button 1' to the 'home' key.\n", "Q: How may I clean ALL the cruft from 12.04? I do not want any games. I do not want any AV-related stuff (no music, no videos, no photos, ... no entertainment at all).  I do not want the LibreOffice package(s).  I am thinking about just installing the server edition, but it is a dual boot machine and wubi was a very convenient way to get it going.\n\nA: I have a very similar attitude to yours and have two ways for solving your problems, both used by me with success:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove unnecessary packages, leaving only those that you deem necessary. Read this thread. It's quite long, a bit complicated and I remember experiencing problems (which taught me a lot and were well worth the trouble\n\n*Get Ubuntu MinimalCD and install your system from scratch (not as scratch as linuxfromscratch) and build up from there. I did it several times, it's not at all difficult and taught me a lot about dependencies between packages. I'm not sure whether you can marry that approach with wubi, though (didn't check, have no idea).\n\nA: It is not very hard or difficult to do from within Ubuntu Software Center. There is an 'installed' option inside USC and all you need to do is this for anything you need removed.\n\nThe games section should have just 4 or 5 options. Office is there too and has only 5 options. Same also for the audio and video option. This also removes the need to know what packages they are but for future usage you can see the package name when you click 'more info'.\nSo all in all the manual work to do this is not that difficult if you want to keep gnome/unity that is. Besides that: this is almost fool proof; using apt-get remove you can use wildcards yes, but those can remove more than what you would expect.\n", "Q: Does home directory encryption depend on gnome keyring? My gnome-keyring has somehow gotten messed up. It prompts for a password (that I know I never provided - yes I chose 'unsafe storage'). None of the possible passwords that I use (including empty) are working.\nSo basically I want to delete the default key so I can start over.  I just want to confirm that this isn't somehow tied to my home directory encryption.  I want to be sure that if I delete the default key from it, I will still be able to log in normally and decrypt my home directory.  It seems likely that they're unrelated as the keyring is within the home directory and is thus itself encrypted, but I just thought I'd ask.\nAnyone have any thoughts?\n\nA: Ubuntu uses eCryptfs to encrypt home.\nI don't think gnome-keyring is related.

The laptop is really overheating (79°c) and it used to work normally in older Ubuntus. (12.04, 11.10 as I tried).\n\nA: I have the same card.It seems to me that this type of configuration is not solved properly as we need to install 2 types of drivers. First of all forget about using 12.10.Whit this card it is recomended to not use above 12.04 and use fglrx legcy due to X.org incompatibility.And after this only your low performance card will work.The proprietary driver is not capable to switch between a legacy chip(4250) and a non legacy chip(5650).Atleast this is what my testing shows so far. I am going to try to install the older driver catalyst 11.5 but i have no idea why it shuld work better then my current catalyst 12.6. other possibility is to use opensource drivers + vgaswitcheroo to manually switch between them but then again the open source driver has terrible power management and the fan will run all the time with high graphics chip temperatures.please report this issue on amd site under the legacy drivers section.\n", "Q: How to enable new lock screen on gnome 3.6?

Upon booting, I am greeted with the Ubuntu logo and the error \"The disk drive for / is not ready yet or not present\". I have the option to wait, to skip and to access a basic shell. Waiting overnight did nothing, skipping just gives me the same error for /tmp, /home, then for a UUID and finally it just goes to a black screen with a white \"_\" in the top left corner. My setup is a dual boot one with XP on a single hard drive, I use separate partitions for / and /home. Back in the day I installed 8.04 directly from the CD while leaving a partition for XP, which I installed after. This setup had never caused any such issues, even when upgrading from 8.04 to 10.04.\nI have done plenty of research regarding this issue, as many others seem to have had similar issues after doing the same upgrade as me. However, while for most what fixed the problem was running: \napt-get -f install\n\nafter remounting / in read-write, it didn't do it for me. I got dependency errors (see here), which I also investigated. I found https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-defaults/+bug/990740 where most people say the solution that worked is (prior to running the above command) running:\napt-get install -o APT::Immediate-Configure=false -f apt python-minimal\n\nbut that also got me a lot of dependencies errors as output (see here), similar to #34 in the above thread. I also read that running: \ndpkg --configure -a\n\ncould help, at first it wouldn't run because it had trouble parsing /var/lib/dpkg/status since there was an extra blank line in a package description (see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dpkg/+bug/916799) but I removed it using vim (and then reran the command). It still gives me output that looks like an error, though. Here it is: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1338074/. I also tried re-running the above apt-get commands after that, to no avail. I'm running out of things to try in the hope of getting this fixed, your help would be very much appreciated!\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: The apt-get -f install did not work, to many dependency package was not installe,  the solution to maintain data was download a 11.10 cd version an perform an upgrade from 10.04 to 11.10.

I have access to usb ports and can try a fresh install of say openbox or something via usb if that is possible.\nEdit:\nI don't have network access from the grun/root option. So I can't update my nvidia driver as in here\n\nA: First, the package you should install to get the \"classic\" Gnome desktop is gnome-session-fallback.\nI guess you just removed LightDM and didn't installed GDM, or GDM is not being run at startup.\nTo solve this, when you get to that part it seems the system is stuck (showing Checking battery state) press Ctrl+Alt+F1. This should take you to a prompt where you can login. After logging in, install the missing packages:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback\nsudo apt-get install gdm\n\nAfter all is installed, just execute in the same terminal\nsudo service gdm start\n\nThis should show you the normal login window.\nEdit\nI'm assuming that despite your not being able to connect to your network now you have some connection configured in the system. To see the list of available networks, use \nnmcli con list\n\nThis will display the list of the networks in your system, giving a name and uuid. If for example, your connection is named MYCONNECTION you can connect to it using\nnmcli con up id MYCONNECTION\n\nThen you should have network conectivity and can download/install the required packages.\n", "Q: Are the newly launched NVIDIA drivers supported in Ubuntu or will they be? NVIDIA just launched new versions of most of their GeForce drivers. I heard they give performance improvements up to twice a fast.\nThe NVIDIA GeForce driver website mentions that it's possible that the new drivers are not yet fully working in certain distributions.\nSo, how fast does the Ubuntu team usually adopt such driver updates? Or can I just install them without any risk?\n(I have a MacBook Pro, and I read in this question that someone else already has problems by installing the new driver; I want to avoid that...)\n\nA: Yes, we are providing and supporting updated NVIDIA drivers in Ubuntu.\nUpdate your system, then look in Additional Hardware Drivers to see the available update options.  (Scroll down if necessary.)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*nvidia-current (version current) is what was stable at the time of the ubuntu release.  This is your baseline driver.  We never update this driver (except for critical packaging fixes) post-release.\n\n*nvidia-current-updates (post-release updates) is a newer version which our testing has found to be reasonably stable.  We can't guarantee that, which is why we provide it via this opt-in package.  We update this driver periodically, usually within a few weeks of an update becoming available.\n\n*nvidia-experimental-304 should be ignored.  We may provide some updates here but these won't be that interesting.\n\n*nvidia-experimental-310 (experimental beta) is a very new, unstable, bleeding-edge version that we have done no testing on.  But it will give you the latest and greatest NVIDIA support, and if you want to run Valve Steam games at maximum performance this is what you want.  Once you install this package, as new versions are released by NVIDIA we'll include them here, so when you do routine system updates it'll pull in updates for you.  In theory each update of this package should become more and more stable.  We are hoping to update this package in precise within a week or so of a new update becoming available.\nThe above options are what I'd call officially supported versions.  We'll accept bug reports about them and work with NVIDIA towards finding fixes (time permitting...)\nThere are also PPA options via x-updates and xorg-edgers.  x-updates is semi-official in that we try to keep it to known-stable versions and we accept bug reports (at low priority for fixing).  xorg-edgers really should be used only by people who know what they're doing - it's really just for testers, not users.  We don't accept bug reports for xorg-edgers.\nFor directions and more information on installing drivers for Valve Steam see http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Valve\n\nA: The new drivers will probably be made available in an unofficial form via a PPA fairly soon, though that mainly depends on how quickly they are built and tested against the Xorg server.  \nSome likely sources for getting the latest available drivers:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/x-updates\nhttps://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa\nRead the warnings on those pages before using them!\n\nA: It turns out Quantal (Ubuntu 12.10) still doesn't have the 310 drivers, except in proposed. Hopefully they'll land soon.\n", "Q: desktop not getting keyboard focus after upgrade to 11.10 After upgrading from 11.04 to 11.10, unity desktop icons do not get keyboard focus. As a result, can no longer rename or delete files from the desktop view, and any keyboard input continues to be directed to the last application with focus, e.g., a text editor. \nThe text control under each icon receives mouse focus but not keyboard focus, so is not editable, i.e. F2 or selecting 'Rename' from context menu has no effect.

If there are no problems it will install. It looks like most installations are source based for network manager though.\nYou can get the source files and install that. There will be a 'how to install' or readme among the files. This does require more than average knowledge; you might need to tinker with settings or be able to understand errors or notices you get along the way. It is not for the faint hearted. \n\nOther options:\nUnless you need to stick with 12.04 (it being a LTS) consider updating to 12.10. It is something that will be less hassle then installing from source.  \nWhen installing from source you can also try IRC channel #nm at irc.freenode.net. It might even be worth to see if someone can help you get the version from 12.04 fixed. \n", "Q: Wireless not detected on a Dell 5720 witha Broadcom BCM 43142?

While it won't fix all NTFS troubles, it will fix some problems.\nFirst, ensure ntfs-3g is installed:\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-3g\n\nNow, run the following to try to repair:\nsudo ntfsfix /dev/sda1\n\nand let it try to fix things up.\nIf this fails, download and install testdisk. This is a bit more manual but will let you get at any important files that otherwise can't be recovered.\nsudo apt-get install testdisk\n\nand run it:\nsudo testdisk\n\nYou will then see it scanning volumes and then you can select the correct volume. Follow guidelines for what keys do what at the bottom of the terminal window.\n\nAll commands are in a terminal. When you open the terminal, wait until you see the prompt ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ before running the command. Since you are in a live CD, you will lose changes when you reboot. Consider installing Ubuntu to a larger external hard disk to have a permanent Ubuntu installation about.\n  When you use sudo, it might prompt you for the password. On the live media it is ubuntu. If you install Ubuntu, it is your user password. When you type it, it will not be seen(not even ****)\n\n", "Q: How to keep zoomlevel in Evince constant after clicking a link? I really love how Evince works but this little thing is annoying me so much. When I select a title or a subtitle from the table of contents it shifts the zoom. On windows it was just easy as pie with Foxit but its Linux version really needs time.\n\nA: this should work.\nopen up a terminal and type: \ngsettings set org.gnome.Evince allow-links-change-zoom false \n\n\nA: Simple run $dconf-editor then org/gnome/evince or search via Ctrl+F after opening the editor.\nThen change the default settings default/continuous/zoom etc.\n\nA: This issue seems to be related to dconf and Evince apparmor settings. A possible solution is buried at this link:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/evince/+bug/682492\ntl;dr\n\n\n*\n\n*First, install dconf-tools:\napt-get install dconf-tools\n\n\n*Then reconfigure apparmor:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure apparmor\n\n\n*Configuration will ask for the path to your home folder. Which is generally: \n/home\n\nThis helped me.\n\nA: To set the default zoom, you can either set it in the program and then go to edit > 'save current settings as default' or select your value and run\ngsettings set org.gnome.Evince.Default zoom 1.75\n\nHowever, i think what you are really referring to is when, say you have a big zoom level of 175% and you have the sidebar enabled and continuous mode enabled, scrolling to the next page upsets the zoom. This makes the page go off centre and you have to adjust it manually each time, as the first screenshot below shows.\nTo change this behaviour, the only real fix is to select the 'fit page width' option by going to view > 'fit page width'. Then go to edit > 'save current settings as default'. This will eliminate the issue, as the second screenshot shows, although the zoom level will drop a bit as you can't set a zoom level and have the 'fit page width' option enabled. \n \n\n\nA: The maximal zoom is constrained by page cache size so by setting higher value you should be able to get higher zoom:\ngsettings set org.gnome.Evince page-cache-size 300\nWorked for me.\n", "Q: IP Alias to Virtual Machine Thank you in advance for any help you can give. I have searched and searched and have not found an answer to my issue. I'm not sure if this should be in virtualisation or networking - since it's mostly a networking question, I'll ask here.\nI have a rent-a-server with one NIC and two real-world IP addresses. The first IP, 69.xxx.xxx.xxx, is the actual IP address of the server. The second IP, 209.xxx.xxx.xxx, is an IP alias. The interface is defined as follows:\n# loopback interface\n\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# ethernet interface\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n  address 69.xxx.xxx.xxx\n  network 69.xxx.xxx.0\n  netmask 255.255.255.0\n  broadcast 69.xxx.xxx.255\n  gateway 69.xxx.xxx.1\n\n# virtual interfaces\n\nauto eth0:0\niface eth0:0 inet static\nname Ethernet alias LAN card\naddress 209.xxx.xxx.xxx\nnetmask 255.255.255.255\n\nThe 69.xxx.xxx.xxx address has a web server and a number of functioning services on it. The 209.xxx.xxx.xxx address is a recently purchased address. It \"pings\" as defined above. I've no previous experience with IP aliaes, but as I understand it, the address is NOT associated with a network at all. There is no broadcast or gateway associated with the address.\nI am attempting to install a product that functions within a virtual machine hosted on the same server. I want the virtual machine to be addressed by the 209.xxx.xxx.xxx address. The pre-built VMWare based virtual machine obtains its IP through DHCP. Both the host and virtual machine are Ubuntu 10.04 server. I would prefer to change the VM to use the 209.xxx.xxx.xxx static IP, but have no idea how to set that up since there is no actual network/broadcast/gateway. When I attempt to set up the dhcp3-server on the host, it fails to start, issuing the error message: \"No subnet declaration for eth0:0 (0.0.0.0). ** Ignoring requests on eth0:0.\" as if the eth0:0 interface is not up. The eth0:0 is, however, up.\nHost: Ubuntu 10.04 LTS server version\nVM:   VMWare Server 2.02, Guest Ubuntu 10.04 LTS server version\nAnyone know how to set the above scenerio up? Is it even possible with an IP alias?\n\nA: Normally you would make eth0 a bridge interface, define the virtual interface in VMWare to use that bridge, and then just configure the 209.x.y.z static IP in the guest as normal (i.e. you don't even need to create an alias entry for 209.x.y.z on the host).\nSo your /etc/network/interfaces on the host would change to something like:\nauto br0\niface br0 inet static\n  address 69.xxx.xxx.xxx\n  network 69.xxx.xxx.0\n  netmask 255.255.255.0\n  broadcast 69.xxx.xxx.255\n  gateway 69.xxx.xxx.1\n  bridge_ports eth0\n  bridge_fd 2\n\nI'm not sure exactly how you configure VMWare to use br0 though (I use KVM with libvirt myself) but I'm certain it must be possible.\n\nA: From a quick Internet search, it appears that VMPlayer has problems configuring the virtual device on Ubuntu.  KVM appears to be able to run VMWare images.  In any case the first issue to solve is to configure your guest to use a fixed address.  Once you have known IP addresses you can do the rest quite simply. \nOne solution would be to resolve the issue with your new static address, and then use IP tables to DNAT traffic to the the virtual machine.  A tool like Shorewall (available as an Ubuntu package) would do this simply.  The Shorewall documention covers NAT very well.\nAlternatively, you can move the address to the virtual machine as you desire.  Replace 192.0.2.10 in the following with the IP address of your virtual sever. I would add the address on one of the private address blocks (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, or 192.168.0.0/16).  I would expect your virtual server container to use one of these by default.  If it sets up a DHCP server, you can add a static address on that network outside the DHCP address range.\nMove the eth0:0 definition to the virtual server.  (I believe you should remove the name line which may be causing problems.  In any case, it is not needed.)\nRoute traffic for 209.xxx.xxx.xxx to the virtual machine with the command:\nip route add 209.xxx.xxx.xxx via 192.0.2.10\n\nThis command will need to be run after the network device used for the virtual machine has been created.  If you can create the network in your /etc/network/interfaces file you could add it as post-up command.\nA second method to move the address would be to configure it as a point to point address on the virtual machine. You should be able to use eth0:0 instead of eth0 in the following.  On the virtual client /etc/network/interfaces block would be like:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 209.xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\n    pointopoint 69.xxx.xxx.xxx\n    netmask 255.255.255.255\n\nThe point to point network should work as your default route if you don't have an alternative default route.   I haven't verified this.  However, if you do have a default route it will should handle traffic correctly. \nYou will need a point0-to-point route.  A command like this route like work if your network device for the virtual network is br0.  Use the correct device for your server.\nip route 209.xxx.xxx.xxx dev br0\n\nWill Daniels is correct about the using a bridge device for the virtual machine network.  Your eth0 device does not need to part of the bridge.  In my case, I can't connect my eth0 device to the bridge as I have multiple bridges.  I document my Manual networking for KVM.  If your eth0 device is not joined to the bridge, you will need to enable IP forwarding.  (ShoreWall does this for me.)  You should be able to safely create and remove bridge devices which are not connected to your network interface.\nAs you mention this is your production server, I would recommend you try setting up the require configuration on a non-production server first.  You can assign address from unused portions of the private network zones for testing.  Then use the correct addresses on the production setup.\n", "Q: GParted wont resize extended partitions I have dual booted windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and have decided that I need more space on my Ubuntu partition. I used gparted on a Live CD to shrink my Windows 7 partition (/dev/sda3) but when i try to resize the extended partition (/dev/sda4), which houses my linux partition (/dev/sda6), the right click options are greyed out and there is a key next to the extended partition. \nI have resized the partitions within the extended partition before to provide room, but now I can go no further with that, and need to grow the extended partition. The free space lies to the left of the extended partition and there is a small amount of free space directly to the right as well. \nAlso, within the extended partition is /dev/sda5 (ntfs) , which I have no idea what is on it, but most of the space (3.42GB) is used, /dev/sda6 (ext4, mount point: /), my partition containing Linux, and /dev/sda7 (linux-swap). I hope you guys can help me with this because I really don't want to screw something up while trying to resize the extended partition.\n\nA: It is likely that the extended partition is locked because your LiveCD environment is swapping to the swap partition which is inside of the extended partition.\nRight-click on the swap partition and select \"Swap off\"\n", "Q: custom kernel, multimedia chortcuts for asus 1225c several minutes compiled my custom kernel, checked everythink and it seems multimedia keys doesn't work and not showed by xet and showkey.

Hopefully, maybe someone this research will be helpfully.\n\nA: These are hotkeys, and are managed by udev.\nIf you freshly compiled your kernel and the hotkeys do not work, then udev is not running or not communicating with the kernel. The brightness control bypasses udev, which is the reason it works. Multimedia hotkeys require udev to be running.\n", "Q: how to remove update repo that always fails A week or so ago I tried to add a new package repo that supposedly had a package I wanted.

Can I just replace my HD and install Ubuntu and expect it to work? Will my wifi work with a different operating system than the one designed for this machine?\n\nA: Yes you can replace Win 7 with Ubuntu(I did on the computer I'm using to type this).  Everything is likely to work.  The wireless may be the exception, they have the tendencies to give you the most trouble but many work flawlessly.\nThe easiest way to see if how your laptop will work is to boot from a LiveUSB/DVD.\nCreate a USB Stik with Windows\nBurn a DVD with Windows\nThe Live media will run slightly slower than a full install but it will allow you to test your hardware.\nThe other option is to install inside Windows with Wubi and create a virtual install inside Windows.  Again this will run slower than a full install but will allow you to test your hardware.\nAny of the option I listed will require you to download the ISO file from here.\nYou can also check to see if you laptop is listed as Certified.  Certified hardware has been tested and will run as if Ubuntu was the native OS.  To check the whole laptop here and to check for your wireless or any other specific component go here.\n\nA: 99% is that your newly installed Ubuntu will not create any wireless access problem. \nBut in order to save your time you can just try to find out (google it, or check the compatibility lists as it was recommended in the first answer) - does your laptop WI-FI module supported by Ubuntu.\nSome times several type of WI-FI modules are perfectly work under windows but has a problem with linux (for ex., I had a problem with Ubuntu 11 + nc6000 + some broadcom based chipset WI-FI card compatibility)\nAlso as I remember Ubuntu has an option to start a virtual kind of installation in \"test, trail\" mode, when you are not going to change or delete your HDD content - but you can basically check the Ubuntu functionality and make some kind of your possible new OS review, maybe it's another chance to check your wifi question.\nPS: Finally, if your Laptop's wi-fi module in not currently supported by Ubuntu - you can always replace the card to another one. HW replacement procedure is extremely easy. The cost of new compatible wi-fi card will be not more than 10-15USD. But always remember that you will save hundred's because of no permanent payment to Microsoft for every new windows release.\n\nA: You should have no problems at all running Ubuntu on your machine. I have Ubuntu on both my desktop and laptop machines. In both of my machines there was no problem with the wireless.

This question is related to How to recover deleted files? but it is slightly different in nature.\nSuppose I have a file named ~/something open in a text editor. Further suppose that I open a terminal and run the following command while the file is still open in the text editor:\nrm ~/something\n\nThis will delete the file. Now suppose that I changed my mind and wanted to get the file back. The file is still open in the text editor, so it hasn't been removed from the disk or filesystem yet.\nIs there any way to recover it?\n\nA: I don't know whether there are any text editors which keep the file opened while you are editing it. Normally (i.e. in Emacs), the file is read into a buffer in RAM and then the file is closed. You edit only in RAM. When you save the buffer, the file is opened, written, and closed again. You can use ps auxw | grep your_editor to find the PID of your editor, then lsof -p your_PID to see the files that are still open.\nOn the other hand, if the file is still in the buffer of your editor, you can just save it.\nBut that was not your question, so let's pretend you are using cat as your editor, and the file is really still open:\n% cat >the_file.txt\nHello world!\n^Z\nzsh: suspended  cat > the_file.txt\n% rm the_file.txt \n% ls -l the_file.txt\nls: cannot access the_file.txt: No such file or directory\n\nYou can use lsof -n to see all opened files and grep to search for your filename.\n% lsof -n | grep the_file.txt\ncat  2145  elmicha  1w  REG  9,1  13 108003357 /home/elmicha/tmp/the_file.txt (deleted)\n\nIn the second column you can see the PID of your cat command. You can change into the corresponding directory in the /proc filesystem, and into the fd (file descriptor) subdirectory:\n% cd /proc/2145/fd\n% ls -l\ntotal 0\nlrwx------ 1 elmicha elmicha 64 2012-11-07 00:22 0 -> /dev/pts/4\nl-wx------ 1 elmicha elmicha 64 2012-11-07 00:22 1 -> /home/elmicha/tmp/the_file.txt (deleted)\nlr-x------ 1 elmicha elmicha 64 2012-11-07 00:22 15 -> /proc/4501/auxv\nlrwx------ 1 elmicha elmicha 64 2012-11-07 00:22 2 -> /dev/pts/4\n\nNow you can just copy the \"file\" 1 to another file:\n% cp 1 ~/tmp/the_old_file.txt\n\nAnd see, it's there:\n% cat ~/tmp/the_old_file.txt\nHello world!\n\n\nA: Just save the file in the texteditor. Should work very well. \nBy the way, often you are prompted with a »leave unsaved?« message, when you still have the file open in an editor and try to close the window, because the texteditor also takes notice that the file was deleted and is currently »unsaved« (at least in that location). \n(nitstorm, please don't use the comments for answers ;)\n", "Q: 'Installing breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)' while trying to run Steam I installed steam for ubuntu , so I tried to launch it and i get this :\n~$ steam\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(1352224866_client)\n\n~$ lsb_release -a\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 12.10\nRelease:    12.10\nCodename:   quantal\n\n\n~$ lspci | grep VGA\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI Whistler XT [AMD Radeon HD 6700M Series] (rev ff)\n\nWhat is the problem and how to fix it?\n\nA: Steam needs a lot of 32 bit libraries from your system.\nIf any of these are missing, the Steam executable will crash.\nOn openSUSE you can check what package provides a specific library with the command zypper wp libpng12.so.0.\nOn Ubuntu there is no such an easy way, but this site explains the process above quite well.\nThe full list required for starting Steam:\n    libGL.so.1\n    libX11.so.6\n    libXau.so.6\n    libXext.so.6\n    libXi.so.6\n    libXrandr.so.2\n    libXrender.so.1\n    libappindicator.so.1\n    libasound.so.2\n    libc.so.6\n    libcairo.so.2\n    libdbus-1.so.3\n    libdl.so.2\n    libfontconfig.so.1\n    libfreetype.so.6\n    libgcc_s.so.1\n    libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0\n    libgdk_pixbuf-2.0.so.0\n    libglib-2.0.so.0\n    libgobject-2.0.so.0\n    libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0\n    libm.so.6\n    libnspr4.so\n    libnss3.so\n    libnssutil3.so\n    libpango-1.0.so.0\n    libpangocairo-1.0.so.0\n    libpangoft2-1.0.so.0\n    libplc4.so\n    libpng12.so.0\n    libpthread.so.0\n    librt.so.1\n    libsmime3.so\n    libstdc++.so.6\n    libsteam.so\n    libxcb.so.1\n    libz.so.1\n\nIf you want to find out quickly what is missing, run the following command:\nstrace -E LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/USERNAME/Steam/ubuntu12_32/ -e trace=open /home/USERNAME/Steam/ubuntu12_32/steam (replace USERNAME twice with your account name on your Linux)\nIt will give you an output something like this in one of the last lines:\nopen(\"/home/user/Steam/ubuntu12_32/libspeex.so.1\", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nIf there is no line after which doesn't mention ENOENT, you will have to search which package provides the shared library (libspeex.so.1 in this case) according to the tutorial above.\n\nA: Install ia32-libs:\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\n\nA: LANG=C LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${HOME}/Steam/ubuntu12_32 ldd ${HOME}/Steam/ubuntu12_32/* | grep 'not found'\n\nThat should give you a list of all the missing libraries; even if you use a language other than English, leave the last part as 'not found'.\nThe steam executable itself doesn't depend on many, but those it loads at runtime will exit the process cleanly if their dependencies are unsatisfied, giving no output apart from the \"exception handler being installed.\"\n\nA: On Reddit I saw a solution:\napt-get install libpango1.0-0:i386\napt-get -f install\n\n\nA: The easy solution these days is to enable multiverse and simply apt install steam:\n$ sudo add-apt-repository multiverse\n$ sudo apt install steam\n\nhttps://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-steam-on-ubuntu-18-04-bionic-beaver-linux\n", "Q: Hibernation failed due to insufficient Swap partition \nPossible Duplicate:\nAdding swap partition after system installation \n\nI got 8GB RAM on my laptop but only partitioned 1GB for swap, now the hibernation cannot be achieved even if I use sudo pm-hibernate.\nIs there any solution?\n\nA: Hibernation basically writes the contents of RAM to disk, using the swap partition. So, for hibernation to work, you need a swap partition not smaller than your RAM - I'd try something like 10Gb.\nFrom SwapFAQ:\n\nHibernation (suspend-to-disk) The hibernation feature\n  (suspend-to-disk) writes out the contents of RAM to the swap partition\n  before turning off the machine. Therefore, your swap partition should\n  be at least as big as your RAM size. The hibernation implementation\n  currently used in Ubuntu, swsusp, needs a swap or suspend partition.\n  It cannot use a swap file on an active file system.\n\nYou'll need to boot from a LiveCD and use gparted to resize partitions.\n\nA: I'd suggest increasing the size of the swap partition if you can. Traditionally swap was twice the size of the RAM but you could probably get away with 4Gb. \nYou should also look at how much of the swap space is getting used with something like activity monitor.\n", "Q: Grub rescue prevents live cd/usb or boot menu TL;DR: grub rescue comes up and won't let me even load bios, boot menu, or fire up live cd/usb. Laptop is EUFI capable, with Windows 8 on one partition. \nI have a Lenovo Ideapad which just came in packaged with Windows 8. I repartitioned the hard drive, turned off EUFI and fired up Ubuntu live dvd. Then I installed Ubuntu. However, I quickly decided that it was a mistake and decided to reinstall Ubuntu Server edition. I opened up Windows, deleted partition, prepared everything, and then rebooted. Now, however, grub rescue comes up. This is fine because I've had to deal with this pesky little booger other times, but every time I simply fixed it by loading up a live cd and just doing update-grub and a few other things, and voila. However, this time...well, it just won't let me. Before installing Ubuntu for the first time, I simply pressed F2 (or ESC, I'm not sure) to load up the BIOS and changed settings there (turned off UEFI and stuff). Then, restarted and pressed F12 (or F8, again not sure) to load up boot menu to choose Ubuntu live cd. It all worked splendidly the first time. This time though grub rescue comes up and it isn't even allowing me to enter BIOS, boot loader or anything. As soon as I fire up the machine, the \"LENOVO\" sign comes up and I desperately press any key I can, but it goes straight up to grub rescue. This is especially terrifying because now I can't go back to the BIOS to switch EUFI back on and load my Windows hard drive. Maybe this may be useful, but \"ls\" on grub rescue outputs:\n(hd0)(hd0,gpt7)(hd0,gpt6)(hd0,gpt5)(hd0,gpt4)(hd0,gpt3)(hd0,gpt2)(hd0,gpt1)(hd1)\n\nI have my Ubuntu server ed. USB ready and Ubuntu desktop ed. DVD fired up. But as I said they are both also helpless against the monster that is grub rescue. Help is much appreciated. \n\nA: PROBLEM SOLVED: For Lenovo IdeaPads with EUFI support, loading bios can be tricky. One way that apparently works is by shutting down the computer and then pressing the OneKeyRecovery button (which looks like a upside-down U with an arrow and is located on the top left). That should force the laptop to enter boot manager/bios, etc. I would delete this question since it's not very applicable to a lot of people, but it might happen to someone else with a Lenovo. \nThe key should look like this\n", "Q: What libraries do I need to install if I want to compile Emacs?

To let the changes take effect either reload udev (sudo udevadm control --reload) or reboot (recommended).\nMaking programs available\nInstead of modifying the path variable I would suggest adding a symbolic link to the executable either in ~/bin/ (user only) or in /usr/local/bin/ (system wide).\nmkdir ~/bin/\nln -s /opt/android-sdk-linux/platform-tools/adb ~/bin/\n\n\nA: I bumped into the same issue with a tablet from China (some weird manufacturer).\nIn addition to /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules file, I needed to change ~/.android/adb_usb.ini as well.\nRun below on terminal; \nsudo gedit ~/.android/adb_usb.ini\n\nand your adb_usb.ini file should look like:\n# ANDROID 3RD PARTY USB VENDOR ID LIST -- DO NOT EDIT.\n# USE 'android update adb' TO GENERATE.\n# 1 USB VENDOR ID PER LINE.\n# ie 0x2207\n0x<!!!Your Vendor ID here!!!>\n\nDisconnected and reconnected device and also needed to run below commands on terminal;\nadb kill-server\n\nand afterwards\nadb start-server\n\nAnd the device was detected.\n\nA: In my case instead of MTP mode some Smartphones needed just to be set in PTP mode unlike most devices who required MTP mode to be detected by my Android Studio (v1.5.1). \nSo be sure to first try both MTP and PTP modes before without need spending time to the more complex ADP Configuration of Unix and maybe harming them.  \nIn newer devices you can choose it directly at Dev options, while in older it is in the USB Connected Options on the Status Bar.\nYet also for me the newest Sony Xperia Devices from Z5 and above, will not work no matter the USB mode.

My primary hard drive on my laptop was getting full so I decided to install Ubuntu 12.10 on an external hard drive. \nWhen I have the hard drive plugged in, I am first presented with the Grub screen where I have to option to boot in Ubuntu or Windows. Everything works fine with the external drive plugged in but when I try to boot without it, I get a grub rescue screen and can't do anything. \nI believe my problem is that the computer first looks for the Grub menu and can't find it. It then freezes up and is unusable. \nIs there any way to get past this problem so I don't have to carry my external drive around all the time?\n\nA: The problem is that GRUB depends on some configuration files that are stored in the Ubuntu partition, and since your Ubuntu is in the external drive, it works only when you have that one plugged in.\nThere are multiple solutions to this problem:\nPersonally, I recommend solution number 1. Some other people may differ.\n\n*\n\n*Insert a Windows CD and boot into a Recovery Console and run fixmbr, this will restore windows boot-loader on your internal HDD.\nIn order to boot Ubuntu from your external drive, you select the external drive in the BIOS boot order (or boot menu) as boot option (assuming that the external drive has grub installed, which it should, if it doesn't, you may need to reinstall GRUB on your external drive (not on your internal one) or just reinstall Ubuntu into your USB HDD again, and make sure to select the external drive the device to install grub to).\n\n\n*Make a new partition on your internal drive, and make it the /boot partition, which will contain all the configuration files needed for GRUB to boot.\nThis partition will mainly have all files contained in your /boot folder under your Ubuntu partition. You may also need to reinstall GRUB in order to tell GRUB to find the GRUB files in the new partition. You may also need to mount this new partition to /boot in Ubuntu.\n\n\n*Install Ubuntu alongside Windows in your main HDD, this will reinstall GRUB and everything will work, but you wont have Ubuntu in your external drive.\n\n\n*If you have any other Linux partition inside your internal drive, you may reinstall GRUB and make this other Linux partition the one containing the GRUB files.\n", "Q: TCP advertised window in Ubuntu 11.10 I want to increase TCP advertised window beyond 10 packets.

How can I write data on it? I have a MicroSD card reader in my notebook. When I insert a MicroSD memory card into it, I can't write any data on it - it's read-only. The same thing happens when I try to do it under root. And I can't change the permission policy for it. This problem happens for all microSD cards (I've tested 2 cards). I've encountered it on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, now I'm on Ubuntu 12.10, the problem is still on it's place. When I try to insert such a \"read-only\" card in my mobile phone, everything's OK and I can write data on it. So, can anybody tell me, how can I write a data onto the card?\nUPD: here's fdisk -l output:\nDisk /dev/sdc1: 2013 MB, 2013135360 bytes\n62 heads, 62 sectors/track, 1022 cylinders, total 3931905 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00000000\n\n Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n\nThe file system of the card is msdos. As to me it's weird. \nUPD2: I've found a small \"lock\" switch on my card adapter, and it turns out, that when I insert it in my notebook, it switches on. Perhaps, I have to find some glue or something to get that switch stuck...\nUPD3: There was no glue near me, so I've decided to buy another card-reader.\n\nA: While in the command window, you could see if the system objects to making the \ndisk read-write. Suppose for example it is mounted as /dev/sdb1. Become root or \nuse sudo: \nmount -orw,remount /dev/sdb1 \n\nwill either make the disk writable or give you an error message indicating why \nit can't. \n\nA: Two possibilities, first is that being a hardware thing, as micro SDHC have a little notch you can easily notice which matches another notch in the reader and that basically just enables it in read-only mode. That you can't change, just try to use another reader or you could put a piece of silicon or tape on notch, easiest thing is to use another reader.\nSecond possibility is that being a file permission issue, in which case you can do the following :\nIn terminal, use these commands:\ngksudo nautilus\n\nThis will launch nautilus in root shell and bypass all permissions.\nOR:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nThis will give you a list of the drives on your system, figure out which drive it is in the list, easiest way is to look for the blocks as this is the space. It will probably be /dev/sdb or /dev/sdc, then \nsudo chown -hR <your username> <the SDHC drive, /dev/sdb for example>\n\nthis will change ownership of the drive to you. OR:\nsudo chmod -R 777 <the SDHC drive, /dev/sdb for example>\n\nThough if you just execute the first command sudo nautilus it will save you all this trouble, but you'll have to do it every time you use the SDHC. \nIf all of this doesn't work, use this command :\nsudo mount --options remount,rw <the SDHC drive, /dev/sdb for example, find it using fdisk -l>\n\nIf there's anything you don't understand just comment.\n\nA: I was just having the same problem and read in another post that Ubuntu somehow locks the SD once it's been improperly removed. Anyone who gets the \"Destination is read-only\" message check that the locking switch in the SD to MicroSD adapter is not in Lock mode, and if that's true, try again after logging out of Ubuntu and logging back in.\nWorked for me in Ubuntu 16.04. \n\nA: Not able to get it try this login to root mode.. open terminal type\nhdparm -r0 /dev/sdc\n\nthan your write protection bit or say ur read only bit will be set to ZERO and now you type\nmount /media/ur_pen_drive_name(like mine is HSR)/ -o remount,rw\n\nAnd that's it.... remember windows can't do this because there is a virus in your pen drive ok... now it doesn't any permission to be changed so if you find any .exe file not getting deleted from your pd just do the above two step and than you'll be able to delete it...\n\nA: Physical write protection\nFor those who never used SD cards before (there's a first time for everything, mine was in my late 20's!), you have to move the LOCK switch to the unlocked position:\n\nImage attribution.\nIt is analogous for a micro SD adapter with a MicroSD inside: the dongle is on the adapter:\n\nRelated: https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/8225/trying-to-image-sd-card-not-working-read-only-file-system\n\nA: I too had this problem. I first noticed it when it wouldn't let me empty the bin. I searched on here for a solution and nothing I tried worked. Then, I noticed on the SD Adapter a little sliding tab which 'locks' the card. Slide that so that it isn't locked. Simple. Never noticed it. After hours of beating my head against a wall, it was a simple mecahnical solution.\n\nA: I had the same issue. Try to reboot system with SD card inserted. After reboot my SD card surprisingly became writable.\n\nA: FYI, I had a microSD card that failed (read-only) with its original Samsung SD adapter with the OPs symptoms. A final throw of the dice, putting it in a different SD adapter, this time from SanDisk made it operational again.\n\nA: Tried everything above. Still read-only.

I'm presently using pidgin, but it doesn't adequately notify me when I receive a message. I know I can get it to make noise, and pop up a notification, but I very specifically would like the icon to flash or wiggle (or something) on the sidebar until I check it. Is there a way I can get pidgin to do this/and or is there a different program that does? It needs to support MSN.\n(Edit: Can someone create the \"messenger\" tag please?)\n\nA: Pidgin does have a icon that runs in the Notification Area but all but the default applets are disabled.

On the download page for Ubuntu it says \"Download Ubuntu for your desktop\". Is ubuntu 12.10 only compatible with desktops? Or does it work with notebooks as well?\n\nA: It works for both laptops and desktops. \n\nA: You can use it on a desktop.\nThe \"desktop\" is actually a misnomer. It will work on laptops quite well. In fact, I'm using it on a laptop right now.\nThe term \"desktop\" is only to distinguish it from \"server\" edition where it has no GUI and only a terminal. That will work but it is not useful for a non-server-class user.\nYou can look in the official resources to know if your hardware is fully supported and avoid any surprises. Look in the wiki page or the certified hardware page. You should note graphics cards, and wireless, especially.\nAfter this, download the file, burn it, and boot it!\nI hope you'll enjoy Ubuntu.\nRemember that if your processor is 32-bit, you'll need the i386 (32-bit) edition of Ubuntu.\nI also want to note that Ubuntu will work on tablets, thanks to Paddy Landau's comment:\n\nIn addition to the helpful answers, Ubuntu also works (with the right hardware) on touch-screen tablets. There are even Ubuntu TV and Ubuntu for Android[to install on Android devices, not referring to what kernel and system libraries power the OS] but  in development.\n\n\nA: Desktop here is a synonym for GUI that you can see in your laptop or pc.Unlike desktop there is a another version which primarily can be used for server,it does not contain any GUI. \np.s: rightly explained by @neon_overload\n\nA: Desktop is basically a computer with a display, keyboard, and mouse (or equivalent).  This is the same paradigm that \nI use the same distribution on my desktop and laptops.\nThe server edition is the same but it has different tools installed.  The netbook version is also the same but with fewer installed goodies.\nTablets are a bit different, but Ubuntu interface seems to be moving toward tablet/surface type interface and away from focus on supporting the legacy desktop paradigm, but that is just my opinion.\n\nA: No.\nThe reason that edition of Ubuntu is called \"desktop\" is because it comes with a graphical desktop (by default).  A \"graphical desktop\" is what you are familiar with if you have used most modern operating systems such as Windows or Mac OS.  It means that there are windows, icons, menus, buttons etc all sitting in a virtual \"desktop\" on the screen, and that you use a mouse or other pointing device:\n\nThis is to distinguish it from the \"server\" edition which does not come with a graphical desktop by default.  Instead, on a server you typically interact with it via a text console:\n\nSo the \"desktop\" refers to the desktop you see on-screen when you boot the OS, not to the fact that it runs on a desktop computer.  The desktop edition is the same edition you should use for desktop computers, laptop computers, notebooks, netbooks, and so on as long as they're compatible (and if they run Windows 7, they probably are).\nI can see how this confusion occurred, and possibly Ubuntu might need to think about how they convey this to people new to Ubuntu, and whether they need to reconsider the names for their editions.  For example, if instead of calling their editions \"desktop\" and \"server\", they could call them \"Ubuntu for users\" and \"Ubuntu for servers\".\n\nA: No, Ubuntu can work on a desktop, laptop, and netbook. If you have a netbook it may run a bit slower, and you must be up to date with your netbook. But, any laptop or desktop should work.\n\nA: Ubuntu work on any IBM PC (anything that is called PC whether \"Desktop\", \"Notebook\", \"Netbook\", with Intel CPU or with ARM CPU's).\nThere are Ubuntu versions prepared for running on Android phones too.\nAnd if you have know-how you can run Ubuntu on some tablets too.\nThere are also Ubuntu version for servers and for cloud too.\n", "Q: Running kile from terminal I installed kile from offline installer and everytime I want to run it, I need to go to the install directory and then run it\ncd /home/usrname/kile-install\n\n./kile\n\nis there anyway to add a command so that this process is automated?\ni.e i want to type \"kile\" in the terminal and it should open kile.\nEdit: tried modifying .bashrc file\nadded the following lines to .bashrc\n\n\n*\n\n*PATH=PATH$:/home/usrname/kile-install/bin\n\n*PATH=PATH$:/home/usrname/R2009b/bin\nThe second one works but kile does not work. \nThanks.\n\nA: Copy the binary file into /usr/local/bin with the following command:\nsudo cp /home/username/kile-install/kile /usr/local/bin\n\n/usr/local/bin is a folder where we usually put custom application binaries.\nafter copying, just re-open the terminal and you should be good to go.\n\nA: If you're installing the program for a single user only, there's no need to mess with system directories - you can configure everything in your home directory. No need to use sudo either.\nCreate a folder called bin in your home directory and create a symlink from your executable into that directory:\nmkdir ~/bin\nln -s ~/kile-install/kile ~/bin\n\nor, if kile needs to be started from a particular directory, create a small shell script and place it in ~/bin:\n#!/bin/sh\ncd /home/usrname/kile-install\n./kile\n\nIf you haven't had ~/bin directory previously you'll need to log out and then log in back, but in the future it'll be added to your PATH automatically so everything you put there can be invoked without specifying the full path.\n", "Q: I get a command prompt instead of login screen when I boot ubuntu Is that normal?

I had some troubles finding the right tags, feel free to edit them\n\nA: OK, far too general a question, but roughly...\nFirst you figure out which package supplies the software you want to alter (ubuntu is made up of hundreds of separate software packages and there's a number of different ways to figure out which one supplies each installed program/file) then:\napt-get source <packagename>\n\nThis will download the source code and unpack it in a subfolder under the current location.\nE.g. if I want to change the behaviour of the Rhythmbox music player:\napt-get source rhythmbox\n\nEdit the source code as you please. How to build and run, debug etc. really depends on the program... language, build system, type of software etc. Mostly, linux software projects all use makefiles. There should also be a variety of README files in the root of each source tree explaining how to handle that particular project.\nOnce you are happy with your changes, to build a replacement package that you can install, you create a new version and run a command (supplied by installing the devscripts package) to build the installable \"deb\" files. You will find a \"debian\" folder in the root of the package source code. Edit the file debian/changelog creating a new entry with a new version number and describing your changes. Now run the command debuild to build a new package.\nYou can use the PPA system in Ubuntu's Launchpad to create your own software repositories and upload your changed source packages there (using debuild -S then dput to upload the .changes file) to be built automatically for all supported architectures and installable by anybody that wants to add your repository to their list.\nThere's a lot more to it of course, but that is a typical (and \"traditional\") workflow. I vaguely recall a project called Ground Control that was trying to make it all more point-and-clicky.\n\nA: Ubuntu packages holds the packages for all supported releases (Hardy 8.04 LTS is the oldest system). You can find the source files for any package here. This is the official place to find source files.\nLaunchpad is a software collaboration platform that provides code hosting and alot more. You can find alot of source code here where people created their own software and alterations to existing software and use it to store changes they made and made public. \nAs a coder you will understand that it is the source code that you can edit, then build, compile (if it not interpreted) and install into your system. Basically the source code you downloaded has an install file or a read me that explains how to install it (configure, make, make install are things you will see alot) so you edit what you need and then follow the instructions. \nFinding the correct package might be taunting. You probably need a better description or an image for anyone to tell you what package you actually need if you want that answered. It is far too broad.   \nSome resources about building software that will get you started: \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware Here is explained what package you need to build.

I installed the beta version of Windows 8 and re-installed GRUB. When I boot my computer and select Windows 7, I get the new Windows 8 booting screen asking to boot between either Windows 7 or 8.\nIf I choose Windows 7, my computer then restarts and I have to select Windows 7 again in order to boot into 7. But if I choose Windows 8 it boots right up. I understand I can choose which OS to boot by default, but I want my GRUB options to be the only way to choose between OS's. So my question is, how can I set this up so that when I click on Windows 7, I go there, and when I select Windows 8, I boot 8?\n\nA: Simple answer is: You can't.  Windows 8 uses a new type of bootloader, starting the operating system almost completely before asking you to select which to boot.  It then reboots into the correct OS.  In this case, if you select Windows 7 it boots into the Windows 7 bootloader and then Windows 7.  If you select Windows 8, it reboots into the Windows 8 partition with the flag to skip the Windows 8 bootloader.\nWeird answer: You may be able to uninstall or disable the Windows 7 and Windows 8 bootloaders, allowing GRUB to take sole control.  This is not really an Ubuntu-related task though.  Try asking someone at M$?\n\nA: I assume you have everything installed (Windows 7/8 and Linux) and Windows have separate partition for bootloader.\nYou need to boot into Windows 7, open elevated Command Prompt (in menu start instead of left-clicking, right click and select 'run as administrator') and issue:\nbcdboot c:\\Windows /s c:\n\nThen you can reboot into Linux and assuming you have os-prober just issue:\ngrub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nYou'll find entries as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu\n\n*Advanced options for Ubuntu\n\n*Windows 8 (on /dev/sda1)\n\n*Windows 7 (on /dev/sda2)\n\n\nSelecting Windows 8 allows to 'select' Windows 7 as previously. Possibly running bcdboot in Windows 8 would fix the problem but I haven't tried it - an easy and safe workaround is just to change timeout to 5s.\nUnfortunately I don't use Ubuntu so the description is more what I've done it on Gentoo so grub2-mkconfig may be differently named etc.\nPS. I don't think that matters but I've done it before I managed to do it by bcdboot. I get the bootsect.exe from Windows 7 install disk (it's in boot directory) and run:\nbootsect.exe /nt60 C:\n\nBefore you try any of the commands above read the documentation (I've just try it today and it worked - I'm not an expert).\n", "Q: cannot boot Ubuntu after removing packages?

Your boot does not get beyond the purple Ubuntu boot screen.\n\n*You can boot, but not into the desktop?\n\n*You can boot, but into the desktop, but there is something wrong with programs that you use , data you once had, or some combination of the two.\n\n\nIf you can boot, but not into the desktop, there's a way to get a terminal without going into the desktop. If greeted with a black screen after booting, where your computer seems to stall, press Shift+Alt+F1 to get the first terminal. Once Ubuntu is started, there are six terminals (F1 - F6). The desktop is always in F7 (Shift+Alt+F7); by default, after booting, Ubuntu starts in the desktop mode.\nIf you cannot log in, then you might need to fix your partition table or bootloader; you might need to fix something in GRUB.\nSince your disk is encrypted, you might have permanent data loss.

Any chance to recover files (see Best tool to recover removed files) would have to be done while running from a LiveCD.\nI am assuming you are talking about a ext4 partition. The biggest issue you will have is finding the exact files to restore, as the names of the files will be lost (unlike the FAT32 file recovery).  Some of the recovery tools can search for patterns that certain files types have.  For example, all jpg files have parts of the file that share a common binary pattern.  You can tell a recovery tool to recover files with that pattern.  You maybe successful at recovering some files that way, but as for restoring you entire system, your best bet is to reinstall, as you will not be able to provide file names for all of the files that were deleted.\n\nIs using boot-repair safe?\n\nI am not familiar with boot-repair, so I can not give you definitive answer here.

The checksums match, so all you need to do is open the downloaded SHA256SUMS file in a text editor, and replace all the * characters with space characters, and erase the two entries for files that were not downloaded with the package. That should fix the issue (at least it did for me). Hope that helps!\nSource: I ran sha256sum checksums on both files (raring-preinstalled-desktop-armhf+nexus7.bootimg and raring-preinstalled-desktop-armhf+nexus7.img.gz) and they match what's in the file SHA256SUMS, minus the * characters, so I just erased the * characters, and all other lines after the first two. It worked, so it's likely a parsing error in the installer, possibly to do with the * characters, and possibly to do with the lines for checksums for files that were not included in the download.\n", "Q: How disable one core from dual core machine I have a Toshiba Satellite L300 dual core laptop.

I think you meant\nstart on runlevel [2345] and started memcached\n\nHowever, this will also fail you because the 'runlevel 2' event will only be emitted once, at boot time (or whenever you return from single user mode). What you probably actually mean is just\nstart on started memcached\n\nThe runlevel [2345] is implied by the fact that memcached will only be started on runlevel [2345]. However, this is also a fairly limited approach. What if you move memcached off these boxes so they can run on a dedicated memcached cluster? Now you can't control boot order. The better approach is for your application to be fault tolerant and handle the lack of memcached gracefully.\nWhether this means alerting your load balancer to not send traffic to this node, or just sending back a \"please wait\" ajax spinner to your users, this will lead to less pages for your ops guys, and more resilience for your application in general.\n", "Q: How to make wget faster or multithreading?

This saves some time at the end because the program doesn't have to concatenate all the downloaded parts.\n\nA: I tried axel upon Gufran's recommendation but it hugely disappointed me. My goal was to find a CLI replacement for DownThemAll because it hogs the CPU and hard disc and slows the entire system down even on an 8-core Mac Pro. I also wanted a multithreaded replacement for wget and curl, not some kludge of a script that runs multiple instances of these. So I searched further and found what I think right now is the ultimate most modern multithreaded CLI downloader there is -- aria2. The big problem I had with axel was that it 'faked' downloading files over SSL. I caught it doing that with tcdump. It was downloading https links as ordinary http. That really pissed me off and if I hadn't checked, I would have had a false sense of security. I doubt that many people know about this serious breach in security. Getting back to aria2, it is more advanced than any other downloader. It supports HTTP(S), FTP, BitTorrent, and Metalink protocols, is multiplatform, and is a download guerrilla. It maxes out my ISP's bandwidth with no load on the CPU or hard disk, unlike DTA. The man page is gigantic. I will never use more than a few of its many options. And oh, BTW, I checked its SSL performance with tcdump and it is solid, not fake. I wrote a script that mimics DTA's behavior, if not its convenience.\nThe basic command I use to get max bandwidth is\naria2c --file-allocation=none -c -x 10 -s 10 -d \"mydir\" URL\n\n-c allows continuation of download if it gets interrupted, -x 10 and -s 10 allow up to 10 connections per server, and -d \"mydir\" outputs file to directory mydir.\naria2files.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfilename=\"$1\" # get filename from command line argument\n\nwhile read -r line\ndo\n    if [ \"$line\" ] # skip blank lines\n    then\n        if [[ \"$line\" =~ (https?|ftp)\\:\\/\\/ ]] # line contains a URL, download file\n        then\n            echo \"URL: '$line'\"\n            aria2c --file-allocation=none -c -x 10 -s 10 -d \"$currdir\" \"$line\"\n        else # line contains a directory name, create directory if not already present\n            echo \"Directory: '$line'\"\n            currdir=\"$line\"\n            if [ ! -d \"$currdir\" ]\n            then\n                mkdir -p \"$currdir\" # '-p' enables creation of nested directories in one command\n            fi\n        fi\n    fi\ndone < \"$filename\"\n\nIt reads a text file of the format:\nfiles.txt:\ndierctory 1\nurl1\nurl2\n…\ndirectory 2/subdirectory/sub-subdirectory/…\nurl3\nurl4\n…\n…\n…\n\nThe script reads the filename from the command line:\naria2files.sh files.txt\n\nIt creates the directories and downloads to them.

Fortunately I closed that terminal immediately and reverted everything by checking dpkg log file, but I was wondering why an install command should act like remove? \nIs it a bug? \nConsider the situation that you are looking for a package name (pressing Tab twice) and going through possibilities by pressing Enter key and those Enter keys remain in the keyboard buffer and.... youhaaaa... apt-get is removing the entire installation in front of your eyes.\n\nA: This is apparently a feature of apt. \nFrom the manpage for the apt-get command ,\n\nIf a hyphen is appended to the package name (with\n             no intervening space), the identified package will be removed if it\n             is installed.

This minus sign is valid for every package . I tried with smplayer- with firefox- and always acting like remove. \nSo the only thing I can think is that the dash sign at the end of a package considered by apt-get like a minus and install command converted to remove.\nIf you wanted to install everything about python3 , then you had to add an asterisk sign after this dash(minus) sign \nsudo apt-get install python3-*\nIn the begin I thought this was just a conflict issue , but is not. Sometimes when you install some package and conflict with an other package then the already installed package will be removed due to new installed package , but this is not our situation here.\nWe've learned something useful today.\nFrom the man-page of apt-get .

Similarly a plus sign (+) can be used to designate a\n  package to install. These latter features may be used to override\n  decisions made by apt-get's conflict resolution system.\n\nEventually is not a new option or something weird , is just we don't read the man-pages  carefully.\n", "Q: Storing application preferences and data I am looking at creating some Ubuntu applications, but finding good resoures are hard.\nI am using the quickly toolkit, but would really like some more insight. How does one normally store application preferences and settings in Linux / Ubuntu.\nIs it as simple as creating a XML file and saving the information and then reading from said file on application bootstrap?\nIf someone can point me in a direction it would be greatly appreciated. \nEDIT\nThis is something I wrote whilst waiting for a reply. Probably exactly what preferences does, but just coded out. You might find it usefull:\nimport ConfigParser, os # We need to be able to store and recal settings\n\n#first try to read the config.cfg file\nconfig = ConfigParser.RawConfigParser()\nconfigFile = 'data/config.cfg'\n\n# We need to set some defaults\nmonState = False\ntueState = False\nwedState = False\nthurState = False\nfriState = False\nsatState = False\nsunState = False\n\n# Creating the Config file\ndef createConfigFile(fileName):\n    print \"CREATING CONFIG\" # not needed, but nice for debugging\n    config.add_section('Preferences')\n    config.set('Preferences', 'mon', False)\n    config.set('Preferences', 'tues', False)\n    config.set('Preferences', 'wed', False)\n    config.set('Preferences', 'thur', False)\n    config.set('Preferences', 'fri', False)\n    config.set('Preferences', 'sat', False)\n    config.set('Preferences', 'sun', False)\n    rewriteConfigFile(filename)\n\n# After reading the config file, we can update configs in memory. \n# But this will save it to file for when the application is started up again. \ndef rewriteConfigFile(filename):    \n    with open(filename, 'wb') as configfile:\n        config.write(configfile)\n\n# Reading the config file \ndef readConfigFile(fileName):\n    print \"READING CONFIG\"  # not needed, but nice for debugging\n    global monState, tueState, wedState, thurState, friState, satState, sunState\n    monState = config.getboolean('Preferences', 'mon')\n    tueState = config.getboolean('Preferences', 'tues')\n    wedState = config.getboolean('Preferences', 'wed')\n    thurState = config.getboolean('Preferences', 'thur')\n    friState = config.getboolean('Preferences', 'fri')\n    satState = config.getboolean('Preferences', 'sat')\n    sunState = config.getboolean('Preferences', 'sun')\n\n# If the config does not exist, create it, then read it. Otherwise simply read it\nif not config.read(configFile):    \n    createConfigFile(configFile)\n    readConfigFile(configFile)    \nelse:\n    readConfigFile(configFile)\n\nA: If you are storing user data, you typically save it under $HOME/.config/$YOURAPP/ (though the user can change this, so it's better to use xdg.BaseDirectory.xdg_config_home).\nIf you are using Python, I recommend the ConfigParser library which makes it easy to read and write structured config file data.\n\nA: Quickly applications use the glib schemas for application preferences. A default schema is created in data/glib-2.0/schemas.  It's an xml file called net.launchpad.XXXX.gschema.xml where XXXX is your application name.\nHere's an example entry:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<schemalist gettext-domain=\"drawers\">\n  <schema id=\"net.launchpad.drawers\" path=\"/net/launchpad/drawers/\">\n    <key name=\"maxicons-row\" type=\"i\">\n      <range min=\"1\" max=\"15\"/>\n      <default>5</default>\n      <summary>Maximum Icons per Row</summary>\n      <description>Minimum value = 1 Max=15</description>\n    </key>\n  </schema>\n</schemalist>\n\nKey's can be integers (type=\"i\"), boolean (type=\"b\"), or floats (type=\"d\"). Use only lower case and - in key names.\nTo access the settings and bind them to widgets, you can get them as follows (taken from the PreferencesXXXXWindow.py generated by quickly):\ndef finish_initializing(self, builder):# pylint: disable=E1002\n    \"\"\"Set up the preferences dialog\"\"\"\n    super(PreferencesDrawersDialog, self).finish_initializing(builder)\n\n    # Bind each preference widget to gsettings\n    self.settings = Gio.Settings(\"net.launchpad.drawers\")\n    widget = self.builder.get_object('maxicons_row')\n    self.settings.bind(\"maxicons-row\", widget, \"value\", Gio.SettingsBindFlags.DEFAULT)\n\nTo read values for variables within a program you can do the following:\nfrom gi.repository import Gio\nsettings = Gio.Settings(\"net.launchpad.drawers\")\ninteger=settings.get_int(\"intsetting\")\nfloat = settings.get_double(\"floatsetting\")\nbool = settings.get_boolean(\"booleansetting\")\n\nHope that helps.\n\nA: I dont have much work experience with linux. But the similar issue i faced while working on my application.\nIn linux, every application generates a file which includes all the settings. If its Linux own application, you can easily search for the file in \" /etc/ \" folder.\nplease provide some sample Application name for more details.\nHope this may help you find your way. \n", "Q: 12.04 does not upgrade to 12.10 My ubuntu is 12.04, I tried to follow the instructions in: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/upgrade, but the upgrade button does not appear.\n\nA: Have you tried going into settings and changing the value for when to look for distro upgrades? by default I think it's set you only look for long term updates, you need to change this to \"For Any Version\"\nSo -\nUpdate Manager > Setting > change \"Notify Me Of A New Ubuntu Version\" to \"For All Versions\"\nHow this will help you?\n", "Q: Do you need sudo rights to shutdown on Ubuntu?

For the most part, everything works fine, but I have a few small problems with Unity, or maybe Compiz.\nWhen I hit the Super key, or click on the dash launcher, the dash sometimes comes up behind the other windows on the screen. As you can imagine, this makes it somewhat tricky to use.\nOnce it has started coming up behind, no amount of trying again will convince it to come back to the front.\nPossibly related, the Alt-Tab switcher doesn't show either. It maybe that there isn't one, or maybe that's behind also? Alt-Tab does switch the windows, but there's no visual indicator.\nWhen I hit Super-W, the windows do all do the zoom thing, but it's slow and juddery where it used to be smooth in 12.04.\nI'm using the standard \"radeon\" driver, same as before, with a triple-head monitor setup (and that works fine). I've not tried the proprietary drivers as I've previously found the multi-monitor support much weaker than the default driver, but maybe that's the way to go now?\nVideo play fine.

I'm not sure exactly what solved it, so I'm going to list what I tried and didn't appear to work also.\nFirst, I tried the fglrx driver. I installed this using the tab in \"Software Sources\". When I rebooted, the first thing I noticed was that the Ubuntu splash screen only came up on two of my three monitors. Then the login screen came up similarly on only two monitors. Interestingly, the montors were not \"mirrored\", as with the xserver-xorg-video-ati driver, but only one screen had the login prompt, and the others just Ubuntu logos.\nHaving logged in I tried all sorts of ways of configuring the display using both the Ubuntu display controls, and the ATI Catalyst Control Centre, but no amount of fiddling could get all three monitors working. It kept claiming that either the monitor wouldn't come on, or that there wasn't enough memory, despite the fact I've been using it triple-head for years.\nOn the plus side, the 3D effects did seem much snappier, and the Unity dash and HUD did come up on top. Some might consider this a fix, but I was still one monitor down.\nSecond, I tried the fglrx-updates driver, also selected in \"Software Sources\". I observed no apparent differences to the straight fglrx driver.\nFinially, I restored the xserver-xorg-video-ati driver, and tried playing around with the Compiz Control Centre (actually, I'd tried this before, but failed to fix anything).\nAfter much futzing with Compiz Plugins that didn't fix the problem, I eventually disabled the Unity Compiz Plugin. This made all the Unity UI elements vanish. For a while I thought I'd stitched myself up because none of the windows would respond, but then they came back to life, another application-switcher got enabled, although there was still no obvious way to launch new apps. I then re-enabled the Unity Plugin, and everything came back the way it had been, but with the Dash in front of the other windows where before it had been behind.\nSo far, fingers crossed, the problem has not recurred, so I'm considering it solved. :)\n", "Q: Instant Messenger for Ubuntu and Windows Does anyone know if there is an instant messenger that can (easily) be installed and work on both Windows (7) and Ubuntu?\n\nA: Pidgin works well on both \n\nPidgin is an easy to use and free chat client used by millions.\n  Connect to AIM, MSN, Yahoo, and more chat networks all at once.\nSupported chat networks:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*AIM\n  \n*Google Talk\n  \n*IRC\n  \n*MySpaceIM\n  \n*Sametime\n  \n*Zephyr\n  \n*Yahoo!\n  \n  \n  Find More Here\n\n\nScreenshot from Run Skype as a daemon and manage it from Empathy or Pidgin in Ubuntu 11.04\n\nA: I use Skype on my windows 7, Ubuntu and my Android phone.\n\nA: You can give Pidgin a try.

The desktop support ended in 2011 so mirrors may have started cleaning things up too eagerly. If you're having problems (packages or lists not available), you may need to switch to another.\n\n\n*Things are pretty old. \"Support\" for an application is essentially a promise that security updates will be backported but it's not a guarantee for anything else.

Consider the effort you're putting in here and wonder if that would not be better spent just installing 12.04.

The resolution is outlined below, with detailed steps and explanations to follow.  Note that this problem could arise out of other buggy drivers as well, and may work.  I am describing my situation with RTL8187SE on msi wind U100 netbook running ubuntu 12.10.  \n\n  \n*\n  \n*Download the WinXP driver for the realtek wireless lan.  \n  \n*Install ndiswrapper-1.58rc1 (not the default version ndiswrapper-1.57 from the repository.  See more details below.  \n  \n*Install the downloaded driver using ndiswrapper.  \n  \n*Blacklist r8187se.  \n  \n*Configure to load ndiswrapper.  \n  \n\nSTEP 1. Download the Windows driver for Realtek RTL8187SE wireless LAN\nDownload the suitable driver from Realtek.  Unpack the zip file, navigate to the appropriate WinXP folder and locate the driver as *.inf file.  \nSTEP 2. Install ndiswrapper-1.58rc1\nThe version found in the ubuntu repository of this driver is 1.57.  There has been many problems reported using this version or compiling from ndiswrapper-dkms.  That is why I am not suggesting the straight foward use of apt-get to install ndisgtk.  It gives the error \"driver not found.\"  For the work around I followed and suggest the following method:  \n\n  \n*\n  \n*Download ndiswrapper-1.58rc1 from \n  this site.  \n  \n*Extract  \n$ tar -zxvf ndiswrapper-1.58rc1.tar.gz     \n  \n*cd to the extracted directory.  And type in the command line:  \n$ make\n$ sudo make install\n\nNow ndiswrapper is installed.  \nSTEP 3. Install the Windows dirver in ndiswrapper.\nFollow these steps:  \n$ ndiswrapper -i /full/path/to/WinXP/Driver/driver.inf\n$ ndiswrapper -m\n$ modprobe ndiswrapper\nNow the Windows driver is ready to be used.  \nNow we need to disable r8187se from loading, and make ndiswrapper load automatically at startup and wake up from suspend.  \nSTEP 4. Disable r8187se.\nEdit the file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf (or, an appropriate file to this effect, if you are running an older version of ubuntu) as root and add the line:  \nblacklist r8187se\nSTEP 5. Enable ndiswrapper automatically.\nEdit the file /etc/rc.local and add the following line before the last line:  \nmodprobe ndiswrapper\nMake sure this file ends with the line:  \nexit 0\nNow there should be no problem.

After using the new hard drive for a few days, I noticed that the new hard drive has bad sectors. So I decided to plug my old hard drive back in.\nFirst, I plugged both hard drives in and copied some data files from the new hard drive to the old one. After unplugging the new hard drive, I booted the computer with the old hard drive, and here I got a surprise: I can see 0 bytes available on my /home partition!\nThe df utility shows that the /home partition has 0 available bytes. I have tried to move some files. But I still has 0 bytes on /home! However, GParted correctly shows that the available size is near 2Gb.\nUPDATE 1:\nTo my surprise, System Monitor shows me that approximately 2 Gb are free and 0 bytes are available on the /home partition. It's slightly shocked me! Are \"free\" and \"available\" not the same?\nAny help is really appreciated!\n\nA: Your question is unclear, but I will attempt to answer as best I can.\nWhen trying to discover the amount of free space you have, you will get different answers from different applications. This is because there are different definitions for the disk space units (KB, KiB, kB, K, k, etc), and there are different definitions of the terms \"free space\" and \"available space\". Also, different utilities may approximate differently.\nUnit definitions\n\n\n*\n\n*A bit is a zero or a one. A byte is compromised by 8 bits. Nowadays, there is consensus on these definitions.\n\n*The shorthand for bit is a lowercase b, and the shorthand for a byte is an uppercase B. Many people get this confused, but most applications make this distinction correctly. So if your browser tells you that the download is 8bps, that means eight bits per second, or one byte per second (which is extremely slow). This is not the same as 8Bps!\n\n*According to the IEC 60027-2 standard, one kilobyte is 1000 bytes, and the unit is denoted as kB. However, in practise, many older applications on Linux and most applications on Windows take one kilobyte to equal 1024 bytes, and use the unit KB. However, newer Linux applications, OS X and hard drive manufacturers use the correct 1000 bytes definitions (known as the SI definition, for its similarities to the metric system).\n\n*Similarly, according to the standard, one megabyte is 1000000 bytes, and the unit is denoted as MB. However, in practise, many applications take 1MB to mean 1048576 bytes, which is very confusing.\n\n*According to the standard, one kibibyte is 1024 bytes, and is denoted as KiB. Fortunately, when applications use the KiB unit, there is no confusion. Unfortunately, many applications still don't use that unit, using KB instead, which is ambiguous.\n\n\nYou can read up more on the unit confusion here.\nFree space and available space\nBy default, Linux will reserve 5% of a partition's space for the root user. This is a good idea, because it makes sure the disk will at least be bootable if the hard drive fills up. However, you may find that 5% is too high a figure, and you can adjust it using tune2fs.\nHere's how you see how much disk space is reserved:\n$ sudo tune2fs -l /dev/sda6 | grep -i -e reserved -e 'block size' -e 'block count'\nBlock count:              487936\nReserved block count:     24396\nBlock size:               4096\nReserved GDT blocks:      119\nReserved blocks uid:      0 (user root)\nReserved blocks gid:      0 (group root)\n\nThe block size in this example is 4096 bytes. That means, we have 4096 * 24396 bytes reserved in this partition.\nYou can change the percentage like this:\n$ sudo tune2fs -m 4 /dev/sda6 # change to 4%\n\nDifferent applications output\ndf\nHere's what df shows me:\n$ df /home\nFilesystem     1K-blocks   Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda6        1921036 134604   1688848   8% /home\n\ndf has an option that uses the SI units:\n$ df /home --si\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda6       2.0G  138M  1.8G   8% /home\n\nThe least confusing is probably just using the number of bytes, like this:\n$ df /home --block-size=1\nFilesystem      1B-blocks      Used  Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda6      1967140864 137834496 1729380352   8% /home\n\nSo as you can see, according to df, the size of the partition is 1 967 140 864 bytes, which is 1.967140864GB, or approximately 1.832042694091GiB.\nAccording to df, the size of available space is 1 729 380 352 bytes, which is 1.729380352GB, or approximately 1.61061096GiB. This is the amount of free space that is available to non-root users. The root user can use the additional 5% reserved space.\nIf you take the total disk space and subtract from it the available and used space, you will get the reserved space:\n1967140864B - (1729380352B + 137834496B) = 99926016B\n\nIf you do the maths, you will find out that that equals 5% of the total disk space, as we expected.\nSo, as you can see, by default, df using the unit K meaning 1024 bytes. When passed --si, df uses the unit G meaning 1000000000 bytes, and rounds the results.\nSystem monitor\nThis is what System Monitor tells me:\n\nDevice     Directory Type  Total   Free    Available Used\n/dev/sda6  /home     ext4  1.8GiB  1.7GiB  1.6GiB    7%\n\n\nSystem Monitor correctly takes the unit GiB to mean 1073741824 bytes. It rounds the result before displaying it to the user.\nThe \"free\" space is that which is unallocated on the disk, it includes the disk space reserved for the root user. The \"available\" space does not include the space reserved for the root user.\nGParted\nAnd this is what GParted tells me:\n\nPartition  File System  Mount Point Size     Used       Unused \n/dev/sda6  ext4         /home       1.86GiB  161.44MiB  1.70GiB\n\n\nGParted correctly takes the unit GiB to mean 1073741824 bytes. It rounds the result before displaying it to the user.\nThe \"unused\" space is equivalent to the \"free\" space displayed by System Monitor: it is the amount of space unallocated, including the space reserved for the root user.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 / media playing problem I recently upgraded my OS and I have now Ubuntu 12.10 ( the Gnome 3 version ).\nSince I installed this OS, I have a problem in playing media files or video/audio in general.

There may be some way to do this with options to the CUDA installer, but I can't figure it out. \nTo fix the Samples problem, you can put a link to where it is expected:\n    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglut.so /usr/lib/libglut.so\n\n\nA: The flag -override compiler can be used to suppress the error message about the compiler being unsupported.\n./cuda_5.0.35_linux_64_ubuntu11.10-1.run  -override compiler\n\nFor me, that also got rid of the glut lib error. \n", "Q: Clementine Error: The stream is encrypted and decryption is not supported So Clementine won't play some songs from my ipod and give the error in the title. Anyone knows if there is a way to fix this? I'd appreciate any help. \n\nA: There is a package called  ubuntu-restricted-drivers that support playback for mp3 and some other patented/restricted formats but this will probably be of no help. Those files you are talking about are mostlikely DRM protected and you will not be able to use those files on anything else than your Apple products (and even that usage seems limited). Their user agreement is far too restrictive for my taste. So no, nothing to be done here for those music files specifically. \nAlternative: In my country I am allowed to download music files (even though this source itself might be illegal). So in my case I would download an OGG version of that music and use that for playback with Clementine. \n", "Q: How to save opened windows?

You can access to this advanced partitioning, by selecting Something else at the partition selection stage for your Ubuntu. \nAlternatively, you could use grub rescue process without installing Ubuntu again and again. This answer is a very good one I think. Note that, after rescuing Grub2, you need to delete the obsolete Ubuntu installation. You can do that by using gparted. It can be installed with the command\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nin a terminal. After installation, open it and detect the older obsolete Ubuntu partition and delete it or format it to use the spaces.\nIt is highly recommended to use these two commands after manipulating partitions in Ubuntu. So, after you have done with gparted, open a terminal and use these\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: Dash doesn't recognize that application is installed I've installed Geary from the software center, but I can't launch it from the Dash nor did I manage to create an app icon on the Launcher.

I tried re-installing the app and restarting the computer but that has no effect at all. I have practically installed nothing on this computer, so I can't imagine what app could interfere with the Dash\n\nA: This isn't an issue with the Dash.  Rather, it's a known issue with Geary 0.2.1.\n\nA: The search results in the dash indicate that the application is not installed. This could be a bug in Unity or one of its components, so you should file a bug about it by running ubuntu-bug unity.\nI just tried to install geary to test this and the dash worked fine to launch the application, and it did appear in the launcher. I was unable to actually configure geary though, so it was not usable.\nYou can try to log out of Unity, wait a few seconds, then log back in. It should work ok then. If the dash still isn't showing it correctly after that, then the bug could run a bit deeper than Unity.

Even if you did get it to work, chances are all of your work would be undone as soon as an upgrade happened. So instead, use override files.\nIn that same directory (/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas), make a file. The file name must end in \".gschema.override\".\nIn there, specify your defaults.

The pros are user-defined macros as well as many convenient pre-defined hotkeys in addition to the pluses of Vim (efficient text editor).

Copy the file for tty1, that is /etc/init/tty1.conf to /etc/init/hvc0.conf. Then edit the new hvc0 file in your favorite text editor, replacing all occurrences of tty1 with hvc0. The next time you boot using Xen, your serial terminal should now work correctly. You should be able to log in to dom0 and use the command line, or by hitting Ctrl-a 3 times, switch to direct serial communication with the hypervisor.\nSincerely,\nSegfaultreloaded\n\nA: I had this problem.

A few days ago I set up Ubuntu on my old Laptop. I used a Live CD with version 12.10 on it. I am new to Linux, but everything went fine. However, it would not let me split off a big partition from my hard drive(with Windows Vista installed) to use for Ubuntu.\nThis was fine in the beginning, but because I only had a very small partition for Ubuntu, it has now started to complain about low memory/unable to save bookmarks, etc.\nNow I would like to resize the Ubuntu partition so that it becomes bigger. Problem here is that windows programs don't seem to see the Ubuntu partition, and programs ran on Ubuntu like Gparted are somehow unable to read the windows Partition Manager table (Or whatever it is called.) Basically they see the whole disk as one big blob, instead of partitions.\nStrange thing is, that in the file system on Linux, I can see and use the windows partitions without a problem.\nThe only option that is left that I can see, is to re-install Ubuntu completely, getting space from that new partition. My biggest problem with that is however, that I would lose all programs and settings I've installed so far.\nSo my question: Is there a way to back up my settings and programs so I can load them on the newly installed Ubuntu?\n\nA: your settings are basically stored within your /home/YourUsername folder (home folder, or just ~/ ) so if you back it up, it will restore all your SETTINGS, not your applications. but you can easily reinstall them trough the software center.\ni suggest you split your whole hardrive into 3 partitions: 20gb[ntfs] for windows 20gb[ext4] for ubuntu and the rest becomes your DATA[ext2] partition. on ubuntu you simply define your DATA partition as /home, your ubuntu partition as /, and the windows as /windows. on windows you'll have to install a ext driver, and just constantly mount it as D: this setting works great if you use windows just once in a while, but is a pain if you primarily use it.\n", "Q: Uninstalling KDE from Ubuntu 12.10 Ok, as I could not find the solution of my problem here:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/214208/kde-plasma-is-totally-crashed-ubuntu-12-10\nI want to uninstall kde desktop environment.

I'm connecting to my university's VPN so I can connect to the network drive. The VPN seems to be working fine and I can connect to the drive by typing the address into Nautilus and entering my login details:\nsmb://139.___.___.140/home\n\nHowever, this fstab entry doesn't work:\n//139.___.___.140/home /media/___ cifs domain=CS,username==___,password=___,uid=sai,gid=sai  0 0\n\nNor does manually mounting it:\nsudo mount -t cifs //139.___.___.140/home /media/___ -o domain=CS,username=___,password=___,uid=sai,gid=sai,user\n\nThe only error it gives is:\nmount error(112): Host is down\nRefer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g. man mount.cifs)\n\nIt's obvious the host isn't down since I can view the share from Nautilus.\nWhy is Nautilus mounting it fine but not the normal mount command? What could cause this error?\n\nA: fstab is run at boot, before VPN connections get a chance to actually connect.\nRun nmcli con list to get your connection's UUID. Note that or copy it to a text file.\nNow, make another shell script in your home folder:\n#!/bin/bash\nsleep 25\nnmcli up uuid <your uuid here>\nsleep 5\nmount //139.___.___.140/home /media/___\n\nreplacing VPNNAME with the name of your VPN, and <your uuid here> with the UUID you noted earlier when getting the list of network connections.\nAdd that script to startup applications.\nReplace the line in fstab with:\n//139.___.___.140/home /media/___ cifs domain=CS,username==___,password=___,uid=sai,gid=sai,user  0 0\n\nso it can be mounted by user.\nYou'll notice that you need to fill in the data you redacted from your post. The command will take 30 seconds to get intalized, allowing for connectivity. You can make the sleep times shorter if you wish.\n\nA: This thread http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/mount-drive-on-windows-98-computer-947748/ led me to try several different things.\nI ended up specifying the server name (servern=) and capitalizing everything.

I have a little question about my fresh installation of Ubuntu 12.10 on a Dell XPS 15z (Intel i7, 8 Go RAM, Nvidia GeForce something and an SSD (256 Go).\nA few months ago, I installed Ubuntu 12.04 and it was perfect, without any lag or something. Great! Then I uninstalled it.\nOn Monday, I tried Ubuntu 12.10 with a live USB and it was perfect, fast, Unity 3D enabled, no lags... Great! (Except that I had to boot with the acpi=noirq option, as I read ot on the wiki and as I did before with Ubuntu 12.04.)\nThen I decided to install it on my computer. No problems, all went perfeclty fine. When Grub appeared, I enabled the acpi=noirq and... blank screen. I know people have already encountered this bug so I won't go further. (With the acpi=off all was fine, but no battery manager.)\nI logged in, no problem. And once the desktop open, all become laggy! It became unusable! \nAnimations very slow, crachs of Compiz very often...\nMy question is: How is this possible? How Ubuntu can be slower once installed than on a USB device? And how a newer version can be completely slower (and unusable) than the previous version?\nEDIT\nHow do I turn off compiz ?\nkillall compiz?\n\nA: When you install it..Startup applications get added..they make booting a bit longer.\nWhat i did was introduced a shell script that did this job of starting the startup apps but with a delay.\nSo now in my startup apps,i have just 2 scripts...they start,execute a delay and then progresively start otherapps.\nAlso compiz is a major reason why ubuntu gets slower! I dont know why!\nAlso resorting to diabeling networking before shut down will boot the system a biiit faster...\nAlso,for your question about why 12.10 is slower, Ubuntu becomes stable over a period of time.\nAs it is open source and has a pretty fast release cycle(of 6 months) the bugs that were not either exactly encountered during beta tests(as not all use beta) and the ones not fixed untill released(though such things are not introduced untill complete mostly).\nAs the users all over use Ubuntu,new problems and bugs are found and fixed.Even 12.04 was not perfect at release. It became better over a period of about 2 months after the exact release and so do the other versions.Also, 12.04 being LTS(5 yrs) will recieve more stability as many users prefer staying there.\n", "Q: Webcam and Cheese: Unbelievably slow I have a machine with 4 GIG of RAM on a 64 bit computer. Yet, Cheese is unbelievably slow in recording videos. To my surprise, even YouTube records videos faster than Cheese. \nWhat would be an apt alternative for video recording on Ubuntu systems? \n\nA: You may wish to give GUCView a try; it is in the default repositories of Ubuntu 12.04 and probably other version. The official website at sourceforge provides comprehensive information about the software but it is very simple to use indeed.\nHere's a screenshot of GUCView in action:\n\n\nA: Testing a couple of Webcam tools because of the slowness of Cheese (Very slow indeed) as suggested by Geppettvs I have the following:\nGUCView (As suggested by Geppettvs) which installs and works the following way:\nThe following line will add the PPA for this app, update the repositories and install the app:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:pj-assis/ppa -y && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install guvcview\nAfter which you can run the app with the command guvcview. Be warned that if your webcam is not in /dev/video0 it will throw a warning. You will need to change it to where your webcam is, for example:\nguvcview -d /dev/video1 - In my case it was in video1, but it can be in video2, video3... Depends on what USB port it was connected to. guvcview does not automatically detect the webcam if it is connected in another one that is not video0.\nThis offers many options compared to Cheese:\n\nCamorama - Much faster than guvcview and obviously MUCH more than Cheese\nIt has the same problem as guvcview in regards to finding the webcam device. You need to run it from terminal like this: camorama -d /dev/video1 if your webcam is not in video0.\n\nThere is also Kamerka but since it needed to download a lot of KDE libraries I tested this one in another Pc with Kubuntu and works excellent.\n\nA: kamerka takes nice photos but it does NOT do videos as of the latest version I could find. Cheese,  not only is horribly slow but it can slow down your computer.\nIt just amazes me that no one seems to have a descent webcam capture for Ubuntu.

My application Variety Wallpaper Changer runs from /opt/extras and uses an indicator icon. I would like to make this indicator icon theme-specific.

I have two questions regarding this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Variety installs and runs from /opt/extras.ubuntu.com.

You didn't specify your model of SSD, but Intel and Crucial/Micron SSDs are generally rated for something like 25% of the drive's total capacity in writes per day for 5 years minimum.  You're vanishingly unlikely to go anywhere near that here unless there's something really, really mind-boggling about your setup that you haven't described.\n\nA: /var/spool should not be the tmpfs mount for postfix. Use the active queue directory path for postfix i.e.; /var/spool/postfix/active. Make sure you have a battery backup and dual power for that system to reduce the risk of data loss. Your inactive (retry queue) postfix dir should be on regular disk or SSD. TMPFS can be used in production, it just takes planning time and patience.

I am wondering if there is a way to compare folders in Ubuntu? I have tried to organize my photo folders many times...and for this reason I have several folders that contain the same files (maybe a couple of extra ones) and it would be great to have a tool to figure out which files are extra and which files are identical.\nP.S. I have just found an application that works well. It's called FSlint. Here is a link to it with a detailed description: http://www.addictivetips.com/ubuntu-linux-tips/clean-up-ubuntu-remove-duplicates-with-fslint-filesystem-lint/\n\nA: diff will help you find duplicate files in two different directories, but if your mess is greater or if, for any other reason, you want to find duplicate (exact) image files in a whole directory, including subdirectories, you can use the gthumb image browser viewer, which is probably already installed in your system.\nGthumb provides a tool to search for duplicate media/audio/video/images/text/all files in a directory. To do this, just select your directory in the view mode that displays a left pane with your directory tree, and then, from the menu select Edit>Find duplicates... a dialogue window shows the duplicates and lets you choose which file(s) to delete. This procedure is visual and helpful in many cases; but it is slow, if you have too many duplicate files to delete.\n\nA: just use diff directory1 directory2\n\nA: If you want to find duplicate files, you can use fdupes program as explained in this question: How to find (and delete) duplicate files\nHowever, with a photo collection this won't find different versions of an image (you can have multiple copies of an image with different metadata, different resolution etc.)\nTo find dupolicated images you can use DigiKam, which is in general an awesome tool for managing a photo collection. It has Find Duplicate Images Tool:\n\n\nA: You may want to have a look at dupeGuru Picture Edition. Seems like one of the best options to me, if not the best, handling also similar (non-identical) images.\nFor exact duplicates and scripting you might use duff.\n", "Q: Intermittent wireless connection in Ubuntu but not in Windows I am new to Ubuntu. My wireless connection on Ubuntu is not consistent. It connects then  disconnects and playing an ON and OFF game. Please suggest some solution. \nIs there something that I have change in software because it works pretty good on Windows?\n\nA: If you are using either 12.04 or 12.10, the problem appears to have been solved about a week ago by updating the system. I too had the same problem, it was fixed by updating. So do the following:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\nAfter that reboot and you should be done.

I think I have the solution but I am pretty incompetent with Ubuntu (just started using it the other day) so a step by step process would be unbelievably appreciated! Here are the links to what I think possible solutions are:\n[1] https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=146223\n[2] http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=31374\nI've tried googling how to preform the solutions such as changing the alias/script for steam (no idea what that is) to -no-dwrite or launching with wine Steam.exe -no-dwrite. The dwrite seems to be the issue in all this but I can't for the life of me figure out how to do anything about it.\nAny useful input is what I'm hoping for but for the brave soul who feels like typing a bit more, perhaps a step-by-step list of instructions starting from downloading Steam off the official website, would be my saving grace.\nIf there is any more info you guys need let me know and I'll of course be happy to oblige!\n\nA: One alternative to updating your launchers to pass the -no-dwrite option is to disable DirectWrite support in Steam's preferences.  While you can do this within Steam if you can navigate the menus and settings dialog box with no text, it is probably easier to change the setting outside of Steam.\nWith Steam closed, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run wine regedit.\n\n*Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Valve\\Steam in the tree on the left.\n\n*Look for a DWriteEnable value in the pane on the right. If it doesn't exist, add it as a DWORD value.\n\n*Set DWriteEnable to 0 and exit out of the registry editor.\n\n\n\nYour existing launchers should now start Steam with visible text.\n\nA: The no-dwrite registry modification should also be possible with this command:\nwine reg add 'HKCU\\Software\\Valve\\Steam' /v DWriteEnable /t REG_DWORD /d 00000000\n\nNote if steam is installed under a specific prefix (e.g. ~/.wine-steam)  you may need to prefix the command with the appropriate environment variable - so for instance :\nenv WINEPREFIX=\"$HOME/.wine-steam\" wine reg add 'HKCU\\Software\\Valve\\Steam' /v DWriteEnable /t REG_DWORD /d 00000000\n\nSource: Wine AppDB entry\nEDIT:\nNo workarounds for displaying text etc in Steam should be necessary with Wine versions 1.7.49 or newer as the bug has been fixed.\nUsing PlayOnLinux etc, it uses the last known version that worked with the appropriate workarounds etc - but often newer wine versions will work, perhaps better - the info that says 'this is latest version of wine that will work for this' can become out of date with newer releases.\nTo install the latest wine version (currently):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install wine1.7\n\nThis is also heavily detailed here.\nN.B. As far as I know, Wine has even and odd releases, even (e.g. 1.4, 1.6) are 'stable', odd (e.g. 1.7) are 'staging'. Staging releases genrally work fine, and may work better with some apps as they are more up to date, unless they suffer from regressions. The wiki says:\n\nYou should avoid using them [development versions of wine] unless the current stable version of Wine does not support or is incompatible with the application you wish to use.\n\nbut that may be out of date anyway... It is recommended by Wine though to test the app in newer versions before reporting any bugs.\n", "Q: Problem booting Ubuntu I have installed Ubuntu over a previous Windows 7 installation using wubi.\nOnce the boot manager asks for which operating system I want I click on Linux, but a message comes up that says:\n(Taken from screenshot from comments).\nWindows failed to start.

Where would I go to get current battery state, last charge capacity, original battery capacity, etc?\n\nA: /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0 ?\n\nA: You can try installing acpi and then calling acpi -V to get info about batteries and temps for your machine.\nsudo apt-get install acpi\nacpi -V\n\n\nA: This command is valid if your distro has the folder 'battery' in / proc / acpi, if that does not find this, the solution is not to create such a folder with mkdir command with root permissions (sudo mkdir) until same because the system does not allow the creation of folders in this directory when started, then the said resolution to the issue is to use a distro 'live CD' logically with its already installed on the HD, and finally create the folder 'battery' in / proc / acpi.\nWell, it is not relevant to the issue discussed here in this topic, but the aforesaid distro technique of using 'live CD', to create folder distros already installed on HD, is useful even for recognition, for example, the USB port. Even for those who use virtual machine, this technique is especially useful if said machine virtualization for Virtual Box, as this is flawed at this point. The procedure under discussion, it is simple to create folders in / proc, creating subsequent folders, which are: / bus / usb. Like this: '/ proc / bus / usb'.\nNow, back to this 'post', this topic. How to create the folder with 'live CD' if the distro I installed the HD out to use: \"LVM\"? Well, I will not explain not to escape the main subject, here goes: For those who can not use the command suprarelatado have this simple form, with the following alternatives:\nInstalling the 'package' acpi to;\nUbuntu and Debian \"'s like\":\nsu-c 'apt-get install acpi'\nFedora (the best in my opinion), or Red Hat's related:\nsu-c 'yum install acpi'\nAnd then, finally, run: 'acpi' (without the quotes, of course, a logical corollary).\nBut the list of alternatives, do not stop there. Then install:\nsu-c 'yum install powertop'\nThen run as super user: su-c 'powertop' (the powertop is the best of all, it updates itself).\nWe have, moreover, \"gkrellm\", add the battery option, remembering that this is GUI (ultra light). There is conky, but this is problematic because the distro has to have the folder 'battery' in / proc / acpi.\nRegards to all, using the intelligence and use Linux.

I mean a program that uses intelligent algorithms or that has an advanced search engine where yo can specify the words/phrases you want and/or don't want to appear in the name, brief description or long description of the package.\n\nA: Ahhhhh....

However, I'll need to create some simpler ones building up to it.  \nAnyway, which of the three languages C++, Python, or Java is most supported under Ubuntu for this type of programming operation?  Also, which libraries should I be studying using for such endeavors - OpenGL, the venerable Allegro, or others I'm not aware of yet?\n\nA: Python and C++ are the Ubuntu \"default\" languages, both are more used than java for native development. There is not even one java program in the default install.\nNow, choosing between this two is harder. You already have experience with python and pygame, so this is a great choice to get a quick start. You will be productive as soon as possible and your game will be cross-platform.

I plan on sharing this drive over a network using samba.  The hard drive is formatted in ext4 but I need a windows machine to be able to read and write to it over the network to access files, make backups and general storage. \nI chose ext4 because I heard ntfs-3g has a ton of latency when accessing drives and I like how I can move files while I'm using them. \nIs this possible or will I have to install some program to at least read the drive?\n\nA: It is certainly possible. To my knowledge, Samba doesn't care what file system you're using, just so long as you can read it and mount it. If you setup a Samba share that points to a directory on your esata drive, windows machines will be able to view it without ever having to know that it's formatted ext4.\nedit:\nTo provide more information, modifying your /etc/samba/smb.conf is how you would go about creating a share for your esata drive.\nAs an example, here is a relevant entry in my smb.conf:\n[raid]\n   comment = 4TB Raid5\n   path = /mnt/raid\n   public = yes\n   writable = yes\n   create mask = 0777\n   directory mask = 0777\n   force user = nobody\n   force group = nogroup\n\nThat will create a share named raid that points to the directory /mnt/raid.

I was running out of space on my disk when trying to install applications.  Without understanding how Wubi worked, I partitioned my C drive (creating a new 90 GB partition) in Windows, booted from the Ubuntu 11.10 install/live disk, and used the \"something else\" option to create a ext4 (setting the mount point to root) and swap space partitions (/sda5 and /sda6).  After the install, my computer no longer boots with the previous Wubi menu and is now using the Linux grub.  The options I have are /sda2, which boots Windows 7; /sda1, which doesn't do anything and reloads the same menu, and the run Linux options.  So I now have Ubuntu running on a separate partition, as well as the original Wubi install.  I want to delete the seperate partition and go back to running Ubuntu on Wubi...if I remove the partition will I  need the Windows 7 disk to restore the boot loader?

Actually, it would be fantastic if I could migrate my Wubi install into the new partition because I had downloaded the AOSP on the Wubi install (as well as other files) and would love to preserve them.  If i can do that and work on the new partition with the old files than that would be great, and I can worry about wiping out the partition completely later on i.e. when I have the windows disk or something.  Can you tell me how to do this migration??  So when I select the /sda2, it loads up my Windows.  If i click on the Linux, it loads up the newly install Linux (my files that were on the Wubi install aren't there) fine.  If I click on the /sda1 (SYSTEM_DRIVE... this is what the Wubi was using to boot the menu that let me select Windows 7 or Ubuntu)... it fails and just reloads the original menu.  \nHere is the link to my boot info script\nhttp://pastebin.com/dMrY0NL3\n------------------------------------------------------EDIT 2-------------------------------------------------\nI really appreciate the help bcbc.  So I used the repair disk to run the \"bootrec /fixboot\", which now brings me to the Wubi Windows boot menu... It asks to select Windows 7 or Ubuntu just like it originally did.  If I select Windows 7, it boots Windows without any problems.  However, if I choose Ubuntu, it starts to boot Ubuntu by displaying the Ubuntu logo with the progress bar, then displays the purple screen.  After this, it goes to dark screen and just sits there until I have to power off.  The first time I tried it, it gave me a black screen with some few lines of output::\n*Checking battery state...

Can you help me fix it :) ??\n\nA: Whenever you install Ubuntu in a dual boot (non-Wubi), it replaces your Windows bootloader with Grub. Grub's bootloader is more complex than Windows' and has to load up modules from the Ubuntu partition. So, if you delete the partition, Grub will fail to load successfully, and will be unable to boot Windows. Instead you'll see a grub rescue prompt.\nSo the first step in uninstalling is to replace the Grub bootloader with a Windows equivalent.\nTo install a Windows bootloader, boot Windows and create a Repair CD. Boot from the repair CD (or from your original Windows DVD) to a repair prompt and run:\nbootrec /fixmbr\n\n(If you use Windows XP then the command is: fixmbr)\nIf you can't boot Windows and can't create a repair CD, you can install something like lilo which works the same. Boot from an Ubuntu CD/USB and select \"Try Ubuntu\", connect to the internet and drop to a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T):\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install lilo\nsudo lilo -M /dev/sda mbr\n\nNote, when you install lilo it will popup a big warning. You can ignore this - Tab to OK and hit enter. Also, if you don't boot from /dev/sda change as appropriate.\nOnce you're replaced the bootloader, make sure that the computer boots straight into Windows. After that you can go and delete the Ubuntu partition and swap partition and reclaim the space etc.\nEdit\nIf you install Ubuntu as a dual boot and find that Windows no longer boots, then run the bootinfoscript. If you see something like this:\nsda1: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ntfs\n    Boot sector type:  Grub2 (v1.99)\n    Boot sector info:   Grub2 (v1.99) is installed in the boot sector of sda1\n                       and looks at sector 856028928 of the same hard drive\n                       for core.img. core.img is at this location and looks\n                       for  on this drive. No errors found in the Boot\n                       Parameter Block.\n    Operating System:  \n    Boot files:        /bootmgr /Boot/BCD\n\nThen it means that grub has overwritten the Windows boot sector and Windows cannot boot. Sometimes it just goes straight back to the grub menu, but not always. First, file a bug as this should never happen, and then fix it either by booting from a Windows repair CD and, from a repair prompt, run:\nbootrec /fixboot\nOr, from Ubuntu, you can recover the backup boot sector... First install testdisk:\nsudo apt-get install testdisk\nsudo testdisk\n\nThen restore the backup boot sector using this guide to the testdisk screens:\nFirst   screen:  Select \"No Log\" and press enter.\nSecond  screen:  Select the hard drive containing  the Windows system partition and  choose \"proceed\".\nThird   screen:  \"intel\"\nFourth  screen:  \"advanced\",\nFifth   screen:  Select the Windows system partition  and choose \"boot\"\nSixth   screen:  \"BackupBS\"\nSeventh screen:  type \"Y\" to confirm\n\nEdit 2\nIf you run the bootinfoscript and see something like:\nsda2/Wubi: _____________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ext3\n    Boot sector type:  -\n    Boot sector info:  \n    Mounting failed:   mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/loop0,\n       missing codepage or helper program, or other error\n       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try\n       dmesg | tail  or so\n\nThen it indicates some internal file system corruption in the root.disk. What you need to do is fsck the root.disk. (I'd also recommend running chkdsk /f in Windows beforehand for good measure because there could be corruption there as well).\nIn your particular case you can mount and fsck the root.disk from your other install:\nsudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt\nsudo fsck /mnt/ubuntu/disks/root.disk\nsudo umount /mnt\n\nNote: you can supply options to fsck such as -fvy. (force/verbose output/answer yes to all prompts).\n", "Q: How to Install Windows OS along side of Ubuntu 12.04? Ok guys i need some help here, I want to install Windows along with Ubuntu 12.04 with Ubuntu being my primary boot. \nI've partitioned my Hard Disk to a NTFS format for Windows, when I rebooted my computer i tried to install Windows and everything was going good until a blue screen appeared.\n\nA: If you install windows after installing ubuntu, windows will replace Grub bootload with its own bootloader, which will remove the boot menu when you turn on your PC, removing you the ability to boot ubuntu. \nAlthough you can always restore grub, i'd always recomend installing ubuntu AFTER windows. Whay i'd recomend now, is to reinstall windows in the whole drive, then re-install ubuntu and select \"install ubuntu alongside windows\" when installing ubuntu and the ubuntu installer will let you choose how much space from windows you want to take for ubuntu and it will do all the dirty stuff needed to get the dual boot working correctly.\n", "Q: Problem with nvidia drivers installation I want to install new nvidia drivers R310 so I downloaded driver and when I run it it says that i can't install new drivers because there is this nouveau driver.

After reboot same thing, I searched through endless topics/questions/etc, i ran sudo apt-get remove --purge xserver-xorg-video-nouveau and tried other things and still didn't find solution how to install new drivers.\n\nA: BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia says it is unnecessary to remove the Nouveau drivers.\nInstead of downloading R310 directly yourself, try doing it through Ubuntu's \"Additional Drivers\" feature. Follow the instructions at Steam Support > Home >    Steam >    Troubleshoot and How-To's >    Linux Issues >    Switching Proprietary Drivers, which I'll copy here for convenience.\nFor Step 2, select \"NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (*experimental*beta) (version experimental-310)\". Note that \"Additional Drivers\" has an incorrect URL for version 310. The correct URL is here.\nI tried the following directions, and I am not prompted to remove the Nouveau driver.\n\nTo change to the recommended proprietary driver used by Ubuntu, do\n  the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open Additional Drivers either through Systems Settings or by\n  clicking the Unity dash icon and entering \"additional drivers\".\n  \n*From the list of available drivers, select the proprietary driver requested by Steam. Your current driver is indicated by a green\n  symbol.

The message will also tell you which NVIDIA driver you should download (in my case version 172.14.xx).\nWhen you download the file you'll need to set it as an executable.\nOpen folder, right click file --> properties --> permissions --> Check Execute -->close.\nNext you need to run it as administrator from outside your current x-session.  Press CTRL-ALT-F1.\nchange the current directory (cd/) to the folder where the file is located and run:\nsudo ./[Name of the driver goes here]\nThen answer all the yes/no questions (mine had a couple of errors which I continued through) and it should work.\nBest of luck,\nGil\n\nA: I was able to solve this by following rft183's approach here:\nsource\nBasically, install the linux-source and linux-headers-generic packages, then reinstall the nvidia-current-updates package (it worked for me just by providing the --reinstall flag, I didn't need to remove the package). Then reboot.\n", "Q: Overlay text editor? I find myself often taking quick notes. E.g. jotting down what files I have edited etc, or a quick reminder.\nFor this I just have a gedit window open to which I alt + tab, and then apply \"always on top\" to when I wish to take notes, and reverse to process when I am done.\nBut I am looking for something much more convenient, What I am hoping exists is a Guake-like text editor, that I can just hit a key and it drops down from the top of the screen, hit the key again and it pops back up.\nDoes said item exist anywhere?\n\nA: I don't think there's anything currently out there that directly provides this functionality, short of running a console text editor within Guake.\nYou may be able to repurpose Scribes into a tolerable substitute, though. With a little help from Compiz and custom keyboard shortcuts, it gets pretty close to what I imagine you're looking for. At first glance, Scribes is fairly plain looking:\n\nPress Ctrl+H, though, and your screen will be overlaid with a sizable army of keyboard shortcuts for advanced text editing functions like word completion, automatic quote escaping, and multi-edit mode.\nAssign a custom keyboard shortcut like Ctrl+` to scribes /home/user/notes.txt for instant access to your notes. When you're done, just close the window (Ctrl+W). It saves automatically.\nTo keep your notes (and only your notes) always on top, set CCSM ▸ Window Management ▸ Window Rules ▸ Matches ▸ Above to class=Scribes & title=notes.txt.\n\nA: I use Tilda to keep a terminal handy at all times http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilda_(software)\nAnd often in said editor; Vim with my DailyLog.otl loaded. (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=517)\nVery handy; have said log reside in Dropbox; and the world is your oyster. or something.\n\nA: You can use Sublimte Text 2 for that. Although it isn't specially designed for your purpose, you can get the functionality quite easy. You can write down notes, close the program without saving and reopen the program again to see your notes. It's amazingly fast, it will open instant.\nThe only thing you've to do is to define shortcuts to open and close the program.\nAnd besides taking notes, it is a great editor. It isn't commercial, but \n\nSublime Text 2 may be downloaded and evaluated for free [...] There\n  is currently no enforced time limit for the evaluation.\n\n", "Q: How to install the MPEG-4 AAC decoder and the H.264 decoder?

Almost every time I start up my Ubuntu 12.04 system I'm told about an internal error relating to Rhythmbox, which I have as a start-up application.\nI've been opting to send an error report each time this happens, but I'm not sure if this useful - should I keep on reporting these errors month in, month out, until they're fixed, or is there a better way?\n\nA: I think it is, indeed, useful to do. Because there is obviously something wrong and if you continue sending reports, whoever receives them can see what is going on. It might take ages for them to be able  to do anything about it but you are at least putting some effort in, even if just a button click.  \nHowever, you also might want to try disabling the Ubuntu One store and Magnatune store plugins, there is a confirmed bug that they can cause Rhythmbox to crash. (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rhythmbox/+bug/820191)\nI've also seen around that some of the other plugins such as Cover Art, Cover Art Search, and Replay Gain might be effecting the frequency of crashes, but I'm not entirely certain if disabling them will help or not. \nIn either case, you hopefully won't be getting these crashes and having to continuously send bug repots. :3 Idk if it will fix your problem, but it can't hurt to try. \n", "Q: Any linux command to perform parallel decompression of tar.bz2 file? I have a rather large file (~50GB) and it takes some time to run\ntar xvf file.tar.bz2\non it.  I'm aware of programs that can do parallel compression for bzip2 files but unaware of programs that can do parallel decompression for bzip2 files.\nAre there any programs that can achieve this?  What is the exact syntax of the command to use to extract from the file?\nI'm using ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: you can use pbzip2 with the -d flag to \"decompress\",\nfrom the manpage: \n  pbzip2 -d myfile.tar.bz2\n\nThis  example  will  decompress  the  file  \"myfile.tar.bz2\"  into  the\n       decompressed file \"myfile.tar\". It  will  use  the  autodetected  #  of\n       processors  (or 2 processors if autodetect not supported).\nAfter decompressing, you need to untar the file with \n tar xf myfile.tar\n\nA tar file is just a container, to which you can apply multiple compression algorithms, for example, you can have a \".tar.gz\" or a \".tar.bz2\" which both have different compression algorithms applied. So pbzip2 will only uncompress the archive but it will not extract the files, use tar to extract the files. Tar shouldn't take long since the archive is already uncompressed and it will just extract the files. (note that we are Not using the 'z' flag or the 'j' flag in the tar command, which they indicate that we also want to decompress the file) \n\nA: lbzip2 seems a lot better than pbzip2 in your case as it is able to speed up decompression of standard .bz2 files while pbzip2 doesn't do that. (Just tested it - 17 seconds for lbzip2 vs 56 seconds for pbzip2 on a partially loaded quad core).\n\nA: lbzip2 and pbzip2 are the tools which you can use for parallel compression and decompression. \nUsage:\nlbzip2 -d <file.tar.bz2> \npbzip2 -d <file.tar.bz2> \n\n-d option is used for decompression.\nTo install these packages:\nlbzip2 type:\nsudo apt-get install lbzip2\n\npbzip2 type:\nsudo apt-get install pbzip2\n\n\nA: You can uncompress your archive with a single command using the tar -I option.\nIt gives you the ability to use any compression utility that supports the -d option.\ntar -I lbzip2 -xvf <file.tar.bz2>\n\nIt comes very useful when deailing with big archive as you don't need to have twice the uncompressed size available on the target filesystem (the tar temp file and the output file)\nIt's also faster as you need far less disk IO.\nOf course that works when compressing too :\ntar -I lbzip2 -cvpf <file.tar.bz2> <file>\n\nCheck tar --help for more options.\n", "Q: How to enable Num Lock after login in 12.10?

You can download it through terminal (see other answer) or through the software center. Adding a separate PPA for version 20 is unnecessary.\nIf you want the most updated stable release (or daily builds for that matter), however, you should add a PPA.

You can replace that by the path of your HDD.\n\n*-name \\*.txt is the name filter. It can use wildcards(*) if you escape them with . You can read this like \"Find all the file with a name ended by .txt\". Replace that by the pattern you're looking for: \n\n\n*\n\n*All file beginning by a: find . -name a\\*\n\n*The file aba.txt: find . -name aba.txt\n\n\n*-size +599k is the size filter. Here you say \"Find all the file with a size strictly superior too 599KB\". Change 599 to the size you want, and k is just the unit.\n\n*-exec allows to execute another command once a file is found. So here, for each file found, we do mv fileFounded targetFolder. The {} will be replace by your result. This part has to end with \\;.\n\n\nKeep in mind that you have a lot of other filters: type, date, owner, permissions,...\n\nA: I am not aware of some readily available program for it, but you can write a shell script by combining commands like \ndu -a | sort -nr\n\nwill display files in reverse order of size.\nand you can use it in combination with NorTicUs's script mentioned in post above \nfind . -name \\*.txt -size +599k -exec mv {} bigTextFolder \\;\n\nto specify dynamic size by replacing 599K with variable holding output of 1st command.\n\nA: I'm making a Python script that sort files by their extensions.

Or in short style: rake -V. See the documentation for rake (read below on how to do that).\nYou used a single dash in front of a long style command. If you use a single dash, all following letters will be treated as individual command line options. \nFor example rake -h will show you a list of possible command line options and \nrake -Vvt prints out the version of rake, activates message logging to standard output and enables tracing with full backtrace. That means, the combined short style options -V, -v and -t are passed to the programm. In your case, you tried to execute rake with the options -v, -e, -r, -s, -i, -o and -n. That worked for -v (verbose) and -e (execute code), but rsion could not be found.\nrake --Vvt would search for an option with the name Vvt, and rake --version searches for an option with the name version.\nBe aware that this is all convention, it's up to the programmer to obey these or net. To get a list of all documented command line options of your programm use \nman programm for the manpage and programm -h or programm --help for a short documentation, replace \"programm\" with, for example, rake, to see the options for rake.\n", "Q: Radeon Open Source Drivers Configuration How does one configure the Radeon Open Source drivers?

Yesterday, I freshly installed  Ubuntu 12.04 and it worked fine, but today when I booted the computer something strange happened. The Unity Launcher disappeared!\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: You need to launch CCSM and make sure that Enable Ubuntu Unity Plugin is ticked.\nIf you don't have CCSM installed, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+T to launch the Terminal.\n\n*Type the following command and press Enter\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n\n*Now, launch CCSM by running this command from the Terminal:\nsudo ccsm\n\n\n*In the CCSM window, select Desktop → Ubuntu Unity Plugin.\n\n\n*In the next window, make sure Enable Ubuntu Unitu Plugin is checked.\n\n\nA: I had pretty much the same problem under 12.04 (64 bit).  Unity was slow with my aged GPU, so I was using Unity 2d as my desktop for months. For no apparent reason, it suddenly refused to display launchpad and title bar (for all users). Autohide was disabled.  Reenabling Unity in CCSM as sugggested above was part of the solution, but none of the other measures suggested in several other related threads, including, but not limited to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstalling unity\n\n*Reinstalling ubuntu desktop\n\n*Removing all relevant (e.g. compiz, gconf, etc.) configuration information \nhelped me to completely resolve these symptoms.\nunity --reset \nwould not work for me. After delivering a variety of error and information messages, it would always hang at:\nSetting Update \"run_key\"\n\nas shown in the log posted in the thread titled \"unity has vanished\" for unity run with no arguments.\nI noticed that the error message delivered by:\n/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p\nwas similar to some of the errors reported by unity --reset:\nerror while loading shared libraries: libGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.\n\nAfter extensive searching, I found the following solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the path of libGL.so.1 by using the command locate libGL.so.1.\n\n*Add a link to the library in /usr/lib/ as shown in the following example:\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/i386/mesa/libGL.so.1 /usr/lib \n(courtesy of J.D. Bartlett)\n\n*Restart the computer.\nThis not only allowed both unity_support_test-p and unity --reset to run, it also allowed Unity 2d to start. Like the author of the above-mentioned post, I have no idea what caused my problems.  I am also still not sure whether the link is a complete solution, or whether I should reinstall the graphics libraries completely, as described by Cynical here.\n\nA: I had the same problem, but for me the fix was:\nsudo dconf reset -f /org/compiz/\nsetsid unity\n\nwhich I found in this thread:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2238678\nIf the first two answers don't work for you (they didn't for me) hopefully this will help.\n\nA: Similar symptoms: 12.04, launcher and menu bar disappear during a logged-in session.

I have a 32bit version of Windows XP and all the music software I have runs on this. However, I want to use all the RAM and can only do so by moving to 64bit Windows.\nMy questions are:\nWill Ubuntu run my Audio software or would I need to get Linux specific Audio software?\nAre there any good (pro) shareware Linux based multi-track audio software packages?\nWill VST plug-ins work through UBUNTU?\n\nA: Unfortunately it is very unlikely that your Windows Audio software will run without latency with Ubuntu. You may be able to run it with the compatibilty layer Wine but it is unlikely that they will perform as expected. Due to latency running Windows audio applications in a virtual machine is not an option.\nHowever there are quite a few alternatives for Ubuntu that may meet your needs (even though they will be different to the Windows counterparts):\n\n\n*\n\n*Jack is an audio server with a more professional ambition.\n\n*Ardour is a multitrack audio processing tool that can be built with support for VST.\n\n*Rosegarden is a full blown, highly configurable MIDI sequencer\n\n*Audacity is a professional audio wave editor\n\n*and many many more.\n\n\nAll these applications can be easily installed and fairly easily configured in a standard 64-bit Ubuntu desktopb edition.

I would like to use some utility or script to convert an A4 pdf to an A5 booklet one.\nI found this page but I'm getting an error : pdfjam ERROR: can't find pdflatex!\nHow do I get past this issue?\nDoes anybody know of any other solution?\nI'm on Ubuntu 12.10 AMD64\n\nA: The best solution I found is at http://bernaerts.dyndns.org/linux/74-ubuntu/248-ubuntu-imposition-print-book (linked as \"this page\" in original question).\nInstallation command given is \nsudo apt-get install poppler-utils pdfjam texlive-extra-utils\n\nwhich should take care of dependencies.\nThis is an easy step-by-step guide, including a nifty right-click for Nautilus (which is easily done in Thunar as well).\nI still wonder why this function isn't included in CUPS or the general print dialogue.\nEDIT oct '19: As of now I recommend the answer above, https://askubuntu.com/a/763721/142472 - install Boomaga\n\nA: Use pdfbook from texlive-extra-utils\n\n\n*\n\n*Install texlive-extra-utils:\nsudo apt-get install texlive-extra-utils\n\n*Then run pdfbook:\npdfbook [pdf file]\nThis will output a pdf file that is in the form of a booklet.\nsource\n\nA: It should have nothing to do with your printer as long as the printer has duplex(both sides of a page) printing. It has to do with page ordering.\nIt is incredible that such a simple function does not exist yet in Ubuntu.\nI solved for my 4 pages booklet, putting the number of the pages to be printed in this order: 4,1,2,3.\nFor a 8 pages booklet it would be 8,1,2,7,6,3,4,5. For a 16pages one... 16,1,2,15,14,3,4,13,12,5,6,11,10,5... and so on .... Not practical and immediate but Works.\n\nA: I found this python-gtk script, pdfbooklet that takes a PDF, rearranges the pages to make a booklet, and saves that as a PDF. It has a number of options to automatically generate different types of booklets.\nIt depends on python-poppler.\n\nA: I installed Boomaga from Ubuntu 16.04's repository. It solves all the problems, and dependencies from Acrobat Reader (now unsupported in GNU/Linux). It works with any installed printer.\nIt works very well and opens quickly with perfect render.\nsudo apt install boomaga\n\n\n\nA: tl;dr\npdfjam seems the best option:\npdfjam --landscape --signature 40 /path/to/your/document.pdf\n\n\nWhat we want is one or more signatures/booklets (a bunch of sheets folded in half).\n\npdfbook is one option which was, however, not quite satisfying since it is only able to create one booklet. In order to create multiple booklets its \"brother\" pdfjam helps us out here:\npdfjam --landscape --signature 40 /path/to/your/document.pdf\n\nCreates a document mirrored along the long edge and creates 40 signatures.\nNote: For --signature n: n must be a multiple of 4\n\nThere's also pdfbook2. Unlike pdfjam it shows the --signature option in the manpage. However it seems to be very slow or not working compared to pdfjam\n\nA: I found a solution. I installed PDF XChange Viewer for Windows (running through Wine). It has booklet format printing option that works well.\nAnother option native to Ubuntu is to install Adobe Reader for Linux.

The words \"embedded system\" are usually thrown in for good measure.\nThe most clear example of a tailored operating system would be an OS designed to power a PDA or similar device and which has only those elements required to correctly operate the device.  This might be a modified version of Linux (eg TomTom GPS), Windows (eg various PDA implementations), Android (notably Phones) or any other horizontally deployed operating system (eg many Ebook readers with code compiled to run on low power processors.)\nYou could possibly argue that the linux kernel, when compiled with modules designed for a specific device might comprise the core of a tailored operating system, however I don't think that you could argue that Ubuntu as an OS product fits this definition.\n", "Q: boot menu in aspire one 725 can you tell me how to enter boot menu on startup\nso I can install ubuntu 12.10 \non aspire there is a grub menu and kernel installed but my skills are not good enough to do anything with it \n\nA: I managed to solve this problem I had usb formatted as ntfs and not fat took a fat32 usb stick and It worked great\n", "Q: How to override system keyboard shortcuts?

You can not use dd to clone a filesystem while it is mounted read/write or the clone will end up corrupt since the source is being changed during the copy so the destination will be partially out of date and partially not.  If you really want to be able to use dd to hot copy a partition, you can do so with LVM snapshots.  This requires that you have installed the system using LVM in the first place, but then you can create a snapshot at any time, and since the snapshot is frozen and not mounted, you can safely dd the snapshot, then remove the snapshot.  The other down side to using dd is that it wastes time copying all of the unused space in the volume, and requires the destination be at least as large, even if most of the source is unused.\nRather than use dd, you can simply use traditional backup tools such as tar or dump to backup the snapshot.  This has the advantage of not wasting time copying free space, and can be restored to a smaller partition as long as it has space for the files.  You can also extract only some of the files to do a partial restore.  You also don't have to use LVM with this method: as long as you are reasonably sure that no files are being modified when you make the backup, it is safe to do on a mounted filesystem.  The worst thing that can happen is that an individual file that is modified during the backup will be corrupt, rather than the entire backup being corrupt, as can happen with dd.\nAs you seem to have realized, after restoring the filesystem, you still need to reinstall grub to get the system to boot.  I'm not sure why you got that error when you tried, but it seems you were using grub-legacy, since grub2 does not have a stage1.\n\nA: Using something like rsync or tar to copy the partition may be simpler.  I would mount the partition on a second mount point like /mnt before the copy.  These options also allows you to change the partition size or type.  You may have structures on additional partitions as well.  I often have separate partitions for /var and /usr.  These will need to be considered as well.\nYou may need to dig into the grub documentation to determine how to target the disk and partition correctly.  install-grub may make incorrect assumptions which don't do what you want.\nThere are tools like mondo which allow you to create a bootable recovery CD with your OS installed on it. \n\nA: I think there is no real option to do a reliable backup of a running system on the device level: Your file system would get too corrupted as you cannot freeze the current state and the backup operation takes a significant amount of time.\nHowever you could try following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the system within a VM. You can create a snapshot of the system and then do a backup of this snapshot. When backup is done, snapshot can be easily discarded. This solves the problems mentioned above.\n\n*Do the backup on file-system level, not on device level. I can recommend rsnapshot for this.\n\n", "Q: How to move multiple files at once to a specific destination directory? I got a bunch of files in some directory (along with many other files) that I want to move. \nLuckily, all the files I want to move contain a certain identifier in their names, so I can ls | grep IDENTIFIER to get the exact list of files to move. \nBut, how can I execute mv file /path/to/dest/folder/ at once, and not one by one (there's a lot of files to move)?\n\nA: Use this command:\nmv `ls|grep IDENTIFIER` /path/to/dest/folder  \n\nHowever, ls is not recommended for this kind of use. Use find command instead.\n\nA: find -type f -name \"[range]\" -exec mv {} target-directory ';'\n\nthis command will move file names with any pattern/range to target-directory.  \neg. \nfind -type f -name \"file[1-50000]\" -exec mv {} target-directory ';'\n\nit will move files with names like file1, file2 ... file50000 to target-directory.\n\nA: If you have so many files to move you can actually have too many for the mv command (or other commands like rm).  I suggest using xargs to move each file individually in a loop like fashion. One way to get around that is to do:\nls -1 | grep IDENTIFIER | xargs -i mv {} /path/to/dest/folder/\n\nThe ls -1 (minus one) ensures that there is only one filename on each line.  If you have hidden aliases for the ls command you can have multiple filenames on a single line and inadvertently move a file you did not intend to move.  \n\nA: Easiest way is like this\nmv {file1,file2,file3} DESTINATION\n\nor directory\nmv {directory1,directory2,directory3} DESTINATION\n\nor both files and directories\nmv {file1,file2,file3,directory1,directory2,directory3} DESTINATION\n\nHope this helps\n\nA: You can use wildcards.\nFore example, to move all files having a .doc extension:\nmv *.doc /path/to/dest/folder/\n\nThis will move all doc file under the current directory to the specific destination.\nEdit\nTo answer the comment:\n\nbut the list of files to move is not determined by extension. some of the files are named: ABC-IDENTIFIER-XYZ.ext and some just IDENTIFIER-XYZ.ext all having different extensions, mostly xml or properties.\n\nmv *.ext  *.xml *.txt /path/to/dest/folder/\n\n\nA: If you want to move a set of arbitrary files (no common pattern in the names and types) you can do as Mr. Rajanand said:\nfirst go to the directory that contains the files you want to move\nmv file1.ext1 file2.ext2 file3.ext3 /destination/\n\nIn case the files are scattered in different directories, you only need to specify the path for each file in the mv command.\n\nA: You can use find and -exec like this:\nfind . -name \"Identifier\" -exec echo mv {} <destination_path> \\;\n\n\nA: You could use:\nmv -t DESTINATION file1 file2 file3\n\nThe following also works, but I'm not sure if mv is invoked multiple times or not, as grep will output a new line for each match:\nmv -t DESTINATION  `ls|grep IDENTIFIER`\n\n\nA: You can use the output of ls as input to the mv commnad:\nmv $(ls | grep IDENTIFIER) /path/to/dest/dir\n\nThe command between $() returns a list of the file names matching your search, and that can be provided as a parameter for the mv command.\n\nA: If the files are in the same dir you can use\nmv /path/to/source/dir/{file1,file2,*.ext1,*.ext2} /path/to/destination/\n\n(tested in Ubuntu 16.04)\n\nA: I use tuomaz's technique, but slightly modified:\nmv file1 file2 file3 -t DESTINATION\n\nI find this easier to remember and harder to screw up since it uses the same ordering as the vanilla mv operation:\nmv file1 DESTINATION\n\n\nA: If you want to move ABC-IDENTIFIER-XYZ.ext or IDENTIFIER-XYZ.xml, you can use:\nmv *IDENTIFIER* ~/YourPath/\n\n* is a wildcard for zero or more characters, this means zero or more characters, followed by IDENTIFIER, followed by zero or more characters.\nThis will move all the files that contain the IDENTIFIER you specified.\n\nA: Using this command you can move multiple files:\nmv SourceFilenames ~DestinationPath\n\n\nA: If you are using fish shell most things are fortunate. So it simple goes like this, just key in the destination as the last file. \nmv file1 file2 file3 DESTINATION\n\n\nA: Run this below command it will move all files\nmv * DestinationPath\n\n", "Q: Cannot transfer file due to \"Filesystem does not support symbolic links\" error When I want to transfer files from my local hard drive to my thumbdrive, I keep getting this error: \nFilesystem does not support symbolic links. \n\nI don't know what this is, I need help with transferring files.\nDragging and dropping, does not work for me, the error appears. Right-click on the file and select copy, and then right click on the thumbdrive and select Paste does not work, I am still getting the same error. \n\nA: If the copying is done in some shell terminal (i.e. bash), then cp can be explicitly told to copy the file that a link points to with --dereference, instead of the link itself. The default behavior of cp is to copy files by following their links, but many graphical file browsers seem to have a default behavior of attempting to copy links and generally perserving most attributes. \nman cp\n\n\n\n-a, --archive\n       same as -dR --preserve=all\n\n-d     same as --no-dereference --preserve=links\n\n-L, --dereference\n       always follow symbolic links in SOURCE  \n\n\n\n\nExample\ntouch SomeFile.txt\necho \"some content\" > someFile.txt\nln -s -T someFile.txt someLink\necho \"Some content for the test file.\" > someLink\nmkdir someDirectory\nln -s -T someDirectory someDirLink\n\nThe fact that someLink is a link, is shown by the l flag in the first position of the listing output (and `d' designates a directory). \nls -l\n\n\n\ndrwxrwxr-x. 2 user group 4096 Aug 17 17:17 someDirectory\nlrwxrwxrwx. 1 user group   13 Aug 17 17:17 someDirLink -> someDirectory\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 user group   32 Aug 17 17:01 someFile.txt\nlrwxrwxrwx. 1 user group   12 Aug 17 17:12 someLink -> someFile.txt \n\n\nThe file contains the content, and the link points to the file, but can be used in nearly any manner the file could be.

Then copying the file to the directory, through the link.

Since this example used a linking based on the relative path of the target being in the same directory as the link being created, the link was broken when it was copied to a new directory. \ncat someDirLink/newCopy\n\n\n\ncat: someDirLink/newCopy: No such file or directory \n\n\ncat someDirLink/newCopy.txt\n\n\n\nSome content for the test file. \n\n\n\nA: you can simply compress the folder and then copy it as you like \n\nA: A symbolic link is a file that points to another file, a kind of alias for a filepath. It is not compatible with the FAT-32 filesystem commonly found on USB drives.\nTo find the symbolic link, you can open the terminal and do an ls -al in the directory you are having problems with - the symbolic link will have an l as the first character in the listing (where directories have a d). Or else, you can do a find DIR -type l where DIR is a directory that might (indirectly) contain symbolic links (. is ok too).\nIf you want to copy the content: ls -al LINK, where LINK is your link, will tell you where it points to (if LINK is a directory you will have to remove the final slash in case you have one). Just copy that.\nN.B.: ls -l is normally sufficient, I just added the a in order to display hidden files, whose name starts with a dot - for the case where the link is a hidden file.\nBut, if you are afraid of the terminal: in Nautilus (the file browser), the icons of links are marked by a small arrow on the bottom right (but not all icons marked like that are links). If you right click on the icon and select Properties, if it is a link, its Type will start with Link to, and its Link target will tell you where the real stuff is (unless that is a link itself, in which case you will have to follow the chain).\n\nA: The file you are trying to copy is apparently a symbolic link, which just points to another file.  Removable media typically are formatted with a Microsoft filesystem such as FAT32 or NTFS, which do not support symbolic links, so you can not place one on the drive.  Note that copying just the link would not do any good anyhow since having the link without the file it points to would be useless.\n\nA: Your thumbdrive/pendrive is probably formatted as FAT32. Try formatting it as NTFS (Make sure to backup it's content first). Of course, EXT3/EXT4 support symlinks too - but you'll have compatibilty issues with non-Linux systems then.\nCheck out this related thread. \nBut, as psusi correctly mentions - copying a symbolic link can create more problems because it might point to a file or folder on your local harddrive and therefore will not be accessible from other computers. Symlinks are preserved if they are relative symlinks (e.g., pointing to a directory above the current directory).  \n\nAccording to rumors NTFS-formatted pendrives tend to wear out\n  earlier. This is not verified :). [Edited]\n\n\nA: An easy workaround for this is just compressing the files you want to copy, then copy it to your drive and extract the data after you put it on the location you need to.\nSo you don't have to deal with the formatting problem in a hurry. \nLater on you can still save all files on the drive and reformat your device with a more compatible one, if you wish to.\n", "Q: Regarding ufw firewall I am using Gproxy software in my computer(Ubuntu 12.10). I  want to allow incoming connection from only one IP adress,so that he can use internet. what settings should I configure in ufw firewall.\n\nA: For UFW, you should make an Inbound rule which will allow you to accept connections via port 5123 (probably TCP and UDP).\nsudo ufw allow proto tcp from [SourceIP] port 5123 should be sufficient for what you need, it'll open port 5123.\n\nFor the record, and for those who use iptables directly in case you are curious, the same functionality can be obtained with this:\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s [SourceIP] --dport 5123 -j ACCEPT\n", "Q: Can't activate \"mirror display\" I have Ubuntu 12.04 on a Dell latitude E6410, I have a problem when using the VGA output I always have dual monitor and can't switch on the \"mirror display\" toggle under systems setting/displays.

While most displays are superior to this now, they will still work at this resoltuion if told to.\nCheck your options for each screen resolutions, and see if there are any matching.\nIt's possible setting it manually may help, although both of mine allowed me to tick the box and then automatically limited my resolution options (which is also stated below the checkbox).\n\nA: I think this is a design problem: for many laptops, only one screen resolution is listed by the display setting tool and xrandr, even though the hardware is capable of other suboptimal modes (resolutions). The current laptop I am using and for which I am experiencing this problem is a Samsung serie 9 NP900X3C running Ubuntu 12.04 with an Intel® HD Graphics 3000 and an optimal resolution of 1600x900 pixels (that usually is not supported by projectors).\nI solved this in the following (not very practical) way:\n\n\n*\n\n*connect the projector. This makes all the projector resolutions available, although not directly usable by the laptop screen\n\n*issue the following command, possibly testing several resolutions from the projector\nxrandr --addmode <laptop_monitor_name> <projector_compatible_resolution>\n\nnote that this command fails before I connect the projector, it seems that xrandr becomes aware of them only with the projector connected.\n\n*use either xrandr or the normal display settings to select the common resolution and mirror the displays.\nThis has been working for me, but it would be much better if there was a function in the display settings that did this automatically, or at least in a more intuitive way.\n", "Q: Why can't I get Firefox to close? \nFirefox is already running, but is not responding.

I appreciate any and all help.\n\nA: This is first time answering to a question, I also new to ubuntu like you. First of all you have to start your computer with windows then open ubuntu disk in the drive. then open windows installer and choose the option to help start ubuntu without disc or something like that. But this process would be distroy your datas in the hard drive. So backup them before try to this. I do this some weeks ago and it helps me to install ubuntu to my desktop \n\nA: You may want to attempt to manually repair GRUB from your LiveCD. Instructions on how to do so can be found on this Ubuntu Documentation page.\nIn case you haven't already, you may also want to check the integrity of your downloaded .iso file by performing an MD5 sum on it. If the computed checksums don't match, then your download was corrupted, and you should try downloading it again and burning a fresh image.\nNo guarantees either of these will fix your issue, but it's worth a shot to narrow down some possible causes.\n", "Q: Using 12.04 installation as a persistent pen drive Disclaimer: I aim to build a self contained pen drive with our application inside for running it in as many machines as possible. Portability. So no matter about updates. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong linux distribution to do this... Please let me know if you think so. I've tried many knoppix and ubuntu flavors (and still am trying many others) but they don't come with enough drivers for Unity3D (nothing to do with Ubuntu's Unity) to work - even lubuntu won't work! I'm betting it's lack of openGL 2.0 support.\nCreating a custom live persistent pen drive is a real pain and I'm trying for 1 day without any success. Sure, being able to do it would probably be ideal and occupy the minimum space.\nUsing the installation image on a pen drive, however, is good enough and is really easy to create. We can even do it from any OS, using UNetBootin, LiLi USB Creator or some other methods. Straight forward.\nSome recommend installing it on a pen drive. But that requires way too much space! Almost 3gb, I can only use this if it's 1gb at most. And, I believe, it won't behave as good as something meant to be installed on a usb disk, because of memory management and, again, drivers. The MinimalCD installation doesn't even recognize a wireless network / device on the first computer I've tried.\nSo, there are only a few negative points on using the installation image that I can think of.\nQuestion here, is how to remove those drawbacks (in order of importance):\n\n\n*\n\n*Having to press \"Try Ubuntu\". That's the big one. Couldn't find how.\n\n*Unable to remove \"Install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\" app (minor importance).\n\n*Unable to load everything on memory and keep on running without the pen drive (like this).\n\n*Setting the ISO to use maximum amount of space for the OS will leave pen drive with zero space left and any file saved within it from ubuntu is inaccessible from the outside (when plugging in the pen drive and not booting from it).\n\n\nThe last 2 items are obviously not that important.\nAm I missing something? Can those points be fixed?\n\nA: As far as I know, what you want can't be done with a persistent Live USB. \nA full install in an 16GB USB drive (8GB may work, but I have not tested it.) will solve most of the four issues you mention.\nI have a 16GB USB with full install and am yet to face any memory management issues. Most computers these days have 4GB or more RAM. So, swap file/partition is not as important. You can do a full install and set swappiness to 0, and limit updates to \"Important Security Updates only\" to avoid unnecessary writing to the USB.\n\n\n*\n\n*No \"Try Ubuntu\" in a full install. Bonus, password protection.\n\n*Unplugging the pen drive when Ubuntu is running from it, either in\npersistent, or in full mode will be a bad idea. I have no solution\nfor this.\n\n*A full install will not have the \"Install Ubuntu\" on the desktop.\n\n*If you use a 16GB pen drive, you can create a 1 or 2 GB FAT32\npartition in the beginning for \"normal\" use. The rest can be ext4\npartition with / mount point. The first partition will be\naccessible both when booted from the pen drive as well as when just\nplugged in.\nIt may even be possible to put some folders like \"Music\" in the\nFAT32 partition and sym link it to your home folder. I have not\ntested it. If it works, you have a bigger FAT32 partition and a\nsmaller ext4 / partition.\nMinimal install\nOne option for full install may be to use the server iso or the minimal iso and add the desktop and whatever else you need on top of it. I don't know if it will reduce the size of install to less than 1GB, but it is worth a try. See how to install Unity on top of a server install.\nWarning:\nThere are some WiFi chips that only work with proprietary drivers. A full install USB stick with only opensource drivers will not have WiFi connections when plugged into and booted from such a computer. There may be similar issues with some graphics cards as well. Installing various proprietary drivers into a full USB installation for all possible combinations of hardware may have unexpected results. A full USB install will not be as portable as a Live USB stick.\nHope this helps\n\nA: disclaimer again: This isn't exactly answering the question, but it's almost and close enough to me today. If no better answer shows up, eventually I'll simply accept this one. I'm still in hope to be able to get a mini-live-usb-persistent-ubuntu able to run on RAM (like so many live cd linuxes out there, some I mention below), because ubuntu interface and drivers are way superior to all others.\nI've checked almost every knoppix and ubuntu variation in this list. and I've tried all which seem like it could stick in less than 1 gb and / or were meant and build to run in USB drives. I've also tried damn small linux and other such variants. Slax was also a noteworthy attempt to mention, quite a nice ubuntu alternate, but got not enough drivers.\nThe only one I found to be somewhat reliable was macpup - and I could use it. It also doesn't play nearly on as many machines as the ubuntu live pen drive, but at least it runs smoothly on most I've tried.\nIt even \"addresses\" the first 3 points I raised (eventhough the first 2 are only relevant to ubuntu :-P) and the last point can't really be fixed. The pen drive has to be in FAT32 and, that way, it's bad to save files for linux usage in it, so we use the persistent file. Only solution is choosing smaller persistence and leaving some room. You can do that with either ubuntu or macpup.\nSo, yeah, the answer here is \"go macpup!\".\n\nP.S.: On my first macpup trials I was going with my newest machine around here, which should be the most problematic to run, and it did run almost everything. Except, as I mentioned somewhere else, our app was too slow. Then I finally decided trying it in other machines and it so happens this test one was the only one it behave that way. So, it is good!\n\n", "Q: Bluetooth - can't browse files in ubuntu 12.10 I can send files to my phone , but I can't browse the files ...\nmy bluetooth informations :\n~$ lsusb | grep Bluetooth \nBus 002 Device 003: ID 0a5c:21b4 Broadcom Corp.

The PHP code is trying to put an image in /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/narrowcasting/thumb. \nCan anyone give me a tip how to achieve this with a symbolic link?\n\nA: if you want to create a SOFT or symbolic link from\n/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/narrowcasting/link-file\n\nto\n/var/www/destination-file\n\nyo do:\n$ ln -s /var/www/destination-file /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/narrowcasting/link-file\n\nTry to use absolute paths because if not, the paths should be writen not from your current directory but from the directory the link-file will be\n\nA: use the  ln  command to do symbolic links.\n ln -s <real folder> <link folder>\n\nin this example, you will create link folder that will actually contain what  real folder  have, and if you save something to link folder it will actually save it into real folder\nYou can verify the link with the command ls -l which will show an arrow to where the link points.\nNote that the folder containing the link must exist, so you would have to create it first.\nSo in your situation, the commands that you are looking for are\nsudo mkdir /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/narrowcasting\n\nsudo ln -s /var/www/thumb /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/narrowcasting/thumb\n\nAgain, you can verify that the link was actually made with \nls -l /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/narrowcasting/thumb\n\n\nA: ln -s [source_folder] [link_location]\n\nThis will create a link named like source folder, but you can rename the link.

I recently upgraded from Mint 12 to Ubuntu 12.10 + Cinnamon.  I have an external usb drive that when I plug it in, automatically mounts to /media/[username]/Backup/.  Thing is, under Mint, it didn't include the [username] portion.  It just mounted to /media/Backup.  My question is, how do I switch back to that format?  I don't need the drive mounted under my username.  Just under media.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 13.04 you can tell udisks2 to automount in /media/ instead of /media/[username]/ by adding a udev rule that sets the environment var UDISKS_FILESYSTEM_SHARED. You can do this by adding a file called (eg) /etc/udev/rules.d/99-udisks2.rules that contains:\nENV{ID_FS_USAGE}==\"filesystem\", ENV{UDISKS_FILESYSTEM_SHARED}=\"1\"\n\nI think udev monitors the /etc/udev/rules.d folder to detect changes, but if not, you can force it to reload its rules with sudo udevadm control --reload. Note though that the new mount location doesn't seem to take effect until you physically remove and plug the external drive back in.\nThis doesn't work in Ubuntu 12.10 because it uses udisks version 2.0.0, and support for the above didn't appear until version 2.0.91.\n\nFor your convenience, you can paste the following into the terminal\necho 'ENV{ID_FS_USAGE}==\"filesystem\", ENV{UDISKS_FILESYSTEM_SHARED}=\"1\"' | \\\nsudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/99-udisks2.rules\n\nNow anyone accessing your machine can access the removable disks you plug into it. So be careful. Tested on 14.04, but as pointed out above, it should work on 13.04 and later.\n\nA: Instead of doing : \nsudo rmdir /media/your_username\nsudo ln -s /media /media/your_username\n\nYou can just do the following, if for example you have a mount point /media/username/DISK_A : \nln -s /media/username/DISK_A /media/DISK_A\n\nlike this all your previous configured softwares can continue to access to your files. \n\nA: You can remove media directory, create a soft link by name media under / which points to your desirable location. Make sure nothing is mounted under media when you do this. Plug your pen-drive and it gets mounted under your desired path.\nWorked for me.\n\nA: It's not the kernel but udisks2 where the automount location is hardcoded. You can't configure it.\nThe original udisks2 uses /run/media/username but Ubuntu patched it to use /media/username/.\nI guess Mint 12 like Ubuntu 12.04 comes with udisks1  which uses just /media/.\nIf you really need the automount disks to be mounted in /media/ you could try to replace /media/your_username with a symlink pointing to /media:\nsudo rmdir /media/your_username\nsudo ln -s /media /media/your_username\n\n\nA: For anyone who is having this problem with a USB-based Banshee media collection and who does not wish to implement the workarounds above, it's easy to modify the Banshee database directly for the new username/USB location.\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Banshee\n\n*Back up your banshee.db\ncp ~/.config/banshee/banshee.db ~/.config/banshee/banshee.db.bak \n\n\n*Run this SQLite3 query to change the OLD path to the NEW path.\nsqlite3 ~/.config/banshee/banshee.db 'update coretracks set uri = replace(uri, \"file:///media/USB%20drive/folder/\", \"file:///media/[yourusername]/USB%20drive/folder/\") where uri is not NULL;'\n\nNote: %20 for spaces, use 3 slashes in file:///, and use a trailing /.\nsource: https://mail.gnome.org/archives/banshee-list/2014-January/msg00019.html\n", "Q: Unable to install Google Chrome I receive this in my terminal when I try to install using\nwget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_i386.deb\nsudo dpkg -i google-chrome*\n\nor\nsudo dpkg --install /Path/to/chrome.deb\n\nI receive\nSelecting previously unselected package google-chrome-stable.\n(Reading database ... 146911 files and directories currently installed.)\nUnpacking google-chrome-stable (from google-chrome-stable_current_i386.deb) ...\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of google-chrome-stable:\n  google-chrome-stable depends on xdg-utils (>= 1.0.2).\n\ndpkg: error processing google-chrome-stable (--install):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nProcessing triggers for man-db ...\nProcessing triggers for bamfdaemon ...\nRebuilding /usr/share/applications/bamf.index...\nProcessing triggers for desktop-file-utils ...\nProcessing triggers for gnome-menus ...\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n google-chrome-stable\n\nI then type\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nAnd retry installation though it still does not install and I receive the same errors.

Any way out of this?\nAnd to make matters worse, deja dup seems to have completely emptied my ~/.local/share/evolution folders of all date.  I have lost all my email.  Best to assume that this procedure is a non-starter and use more mundane methods a package at time.\n\nA: The easiest way of doing is consists of two parts: First, backup your complete home directory including hidden files. It contains all configuration and data specific to your user. The second part is to have a list of packages that are installed. You can use\naptitude search '~i'\n\nto generate a list of all installed packages, filter for the lines that don't have an A. After installing your new system you can apply this list again in order to install all previously installed software. Have a look at the aptitude user manual on how to do that.\nAfter installing the new system, you can restore the backup of your home directory and everything should be back.\nThe list of installed packages can be generated using following command:\naptitude search '~i' | grep '^..[^A]' | awk '{print $2}' > installed_packages.txt\n\nThe packages can then be reinstalled using the following command:\naptitude install $(cat installed_packages.txt)\n\nNote that this may not produce exactly the same results as we filtered automatically installed packages in first command. It is better not to install automatically installed packages as they will remain on the system forever. However, some dependencies are only 'recommended', and they might not get reinstalled when applying the package list.\n\nA: Use Deja Dup backup tool to backup on a local or cloud folder (backup-folder). To restore, just open Deja Dup after clean installation, click 'I want to restore files from previous backup...' and give backup-folder path to restore the system.\n\nDeja Dup is available in Ubuntu Store.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 12.10 on new computer with Windows 8 \nPossible Duplicate:\nInstalling Ubuntu on a Pre-Installed UEFI Supported Windows 8 system \n\nI recently purchased a new HP computer (P6-2330) with Windows 8.  I have tried unsuccessfully to install Ubuntu 12.10 64bit alongside Windows 8.  The computer is UEFI with Secure Boot enabled.  I've tried following the instruction at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI.  \nI am able to get the GRUB menu to show up.  However, as soon as I press Enter on either Try Ubuntu or Install Ubuntu, the screen goes blank.  Nothing works at all, not even the Num Lock or Caps Lock keys on the keyboard.  I have to use the power button to restart the computer.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get Ubuntu installed?\nTo clarify, I have actually tried installing using both a USB stick and a DVD.  The USB stick gave a blank screen, while the DVD gave the error message \"Empty Security Header\" after pressing Enter at the GRUB screen.\n\nA: @ Athelstan - this is the solution that many other threads were missing. Unfortunately, I found this thread after a few hours of tweaking it on my own :)...\nAllowing for legacy USB and reordering the boot order was not enough to install 12.04 cleanly. Many people have been reporting the \"missing file\" error or the inability to get past the black screens. At one point, I could chose the boot disk, but it wouldn't allow it.\nMoral of the Story: Win8 is a beast and the hardware setting reflect this. Setting \"Secure Boot Control\" to DISABLED and tweaking the UEFI settings allowed for me to seamlessly install 12.04 on a new laptop with Win8.\nB\n\nA: I'm not thrilled with this solution, but it has worked.  I paid an extra Microsoft tax of $40 to upgrade my Windows 8 to Windows 8...  Then I reconfigured my UEFI settings so that I could do everything in BIOS mode.  I reformatted my hard drive using gparted so that it was in msdos style instead of gpt.  I then clean installed Windows 8.  Since it was an upgrade disk, I had to \"upgrade\" the freshly installed Windows 8 with Windows 8.  I was then able to install Ubuntu.  Ugh.  I hope this mess is straightened out soon.\n\nA: I found in my bios a setting called \"Secure Boot Control\". I set it to disabled and now can boot into Ubuntu and Windows 8 with no issues.\n", "Q: Excluding results from synapse Synapse is showing all results from zeitgeist, locate, ...\nHow do I exclude some private Results from being displayed in synapse?\nKeep files from showing up?  \nThe best would be an option to enter wildcards like \"*log\" that shouldnt be displayed in the search results\n\nA: In Zeitgeist, it is possible to blacklist some folders in the activity log manager:\n\nsee: http://www.webupd8.org/2011/05/keep-files-from-showing-up-in-unity.html\n", "Q: Mix SATA and IDE drives for dual boot I have Windows Vista on a 180G IDE HD.

To pause or continue audio playback, you use any keyboard shortcut that you configured system-wide for audio in the system settings. I use F7 to pause, F8 to continue.\n\nTo install transcribe:\nFirst, you have to add a PPA:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:frederik-elwert/transcribe\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen you can install it:\nsudo apt-get install transcribe\n\n\nA: Automatic voice recognition software normally reduces the manual transcription needs. But Automatic voice recognition technology is not still matured to produce accurate transcription for non-American accents, or with people speaking quickly or multiple speakers audio files.  If you have more than one voice it is almost impossible to get a good transcript. Add to that any background noise or a weak recording and you can pretty much forget it.\nSo, after automatic transcription, you have to massage this transcription into the final form.

You're free to use whatever document program you desire.\nControls:\nF2 is play/pause.\nF4 is rewind 3 seconds.\nI may advance the program further, if there is enough outcry but at this time, I have no need to do so.\nYou will need to install Python3 and Pyglet (minimum).

I certainly can't afford to have my ubuntu install unbootable right now, but looking into this issue is bothering me too much. Help appreciated!\nI have Win7 DVD & Ubuntu live USBs with me, I am just looking for a sure shot way of fixing Win7 without any harm to my existing Ubuntu install.\n\nA: Usually Windows 7 creates two partitions during setup: a partition with the boot manager and a partition to the operating system. It seems that your Windows selected the recovery partition and used it as the boot partition, probably overwriting it (it is the only partition with the \"boot\" flag (line 79 of the log)). So to boot Windows i think you must boot the recovery partition (/dev/sda3).\nBut if i'm not wrong, booting from your recovery partition may reset the MBR, and so replace GRUB with the Windows 7 MBR. So before doing this, you really should create a backup of your Ubuntu, or of the MBR atleast!\nThe best way to proceed is creating a new boot entry in /etc/grub.d/40_custom, editing it with root privileges:\nsudo gedit /etc/grub.d/40_custom\n\nThis file should already have one entry. After it add the following: \nmenuentry 'My Windows entry' --class windows {\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod ntfs\n    set root='hd0,msdos3'\n    chainloader +1\n}\n\nSave the file and run sudo update-grub in a terminal. This will recreate the Grub boot entries. After that, the next time you reboot you should have a new entry, which hopefully will let you boot on Windows 7.\n\nA: If you installed Ubuntu with Wubi you will not be getting grub menu.

Because my notebook has a SSD and a HDD, I want use the SSD as cache just like Rapid Storage in windows. I find bcache offers this functionality so I decide to try it.\nI got bcache and bcache-tools via git then followed the guide at:\nhttp://evilpiepirate.org/git/linux-bcache.git/tree/Documentation/bcache.txt\nGetting started:\nYou'll need make-bcache from the bcache-tools repository. Both the cache device\nand backing device must be formatted before use.\n  make-bcache -B /dev/sdb\n  make-bcache -C -w2k -b1M -j64 /dev/sdc\n\nDoes that mean I have to format the whole HDD to enable the bcache?\n\nA: There is no need for a fresh install.  See the blocks README and the bcache FAQ.  To enable bcache on your root filesystem, you would convert the root device with blocks, whether or not you have a fresh install.\nObDisclaimer:  I wrote the conversion tool.\n\nA: \nDoes that mean I have to format the whole HDD to enable the bcache?\n\nThat's certainly what is suggested, yes. This is fairly common in RAID-like situations. You start by generating a new mapped bcache device and then you format that, instead of the hardware directly.\nHowever, the other RAID-like things (mdadm, dmraid, etc.) have documentation that make it quite clear how you create one of these setups and then install on top of it (and have initramfs load the right stuff so you can boot!)\nI'm fairly experienced messing around with bizarre file system arrangements and kernel modules, but even I wouldn't want to touch this, especially not if I was trying to retrofit it into an existing installation.\nI would concentrate on what I've got in front of me. If your SSD is fast and of a moderate size ~10GB+, stick Ubuntu on there and host /home on the spinning rust. That should give you some room for installing things, though you might have to move /opt to rust at some point. It may seem complicated now, but it's quite easy to split an installation over multiple disks.\nIf the SSD is tiny (<8GB) and/or slow, it may be worth considering just not using it.\n\nA: Another option that don't require you to do a fresh install (given that you use ext3 or 4) is to move the journal to ssd, and add data=journal for the different filesystems you have. For the rootfilesystem this has to be added as a kernel parameter rootflags=data=journal .\nMore about this can be read on http://insights.oetiker.ch/linux/external-journal-on-ssd/\n", "Q: i cann't install eclipse ADT-plugin on ubuntu12.04 i want to install the Eclipse Plugin but it doesn't work. and this is the detail.\nWarning: You are installing software that contains unsigned content.

So i did alias eclipse=/opt/eclipse/eclispe\nThis opens eclipse but the icon in unity is a ? mark, can this be made into the eclipse icon?\n\nA: If you have an icon defined by the .desktop file, I would have thought that would work.\nPersonally, when I have non-standard programs on my system, I put a symbolic link to the executable in a directory in my $PATH - I tend to put them in $HOME/bin. For example, with the film script writing software celtx, I created a symbolic link to the executable (in this case $HOME/.celtx/celtx) within $HOME/bin named celtx. Then, I make the .desktop file call simply 'celtx' rather than the /path/to/the/executable. Thus, the .desktop file looks like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Celtx\nExec=celtx\nComment=Write movie and television scripts\nCategories=Applications\nStartupNotify=true\nIcon=/home/evilsoup/.celtx/celtx/icons/default48.png\n\nThis works exactly as you would think it should (launched either from Unity, or from the terminal, I get the icon defined in the .desktop). I would have thought that your method of using an alias would work just the same (maybe if you change the Exec line in your .desktop to call the alias, rather than the full /path/to/command?).\n", "Q: Using ubuntu server as host for mac/windows I hate to be that guy and ask a question that may have been asked before, but I have a specific usage case in mind and feel the question is justified.\nSo here goes.

No. So, are you going to jump hoops to get this done? Just using SSH is the normal method.\nDropbox/Ubuntu One may be  difficult to use on a headless server. Perhaps you could rsync from the server to one of your Macs or use a different, better backup solution.\nThe Mac is Darwin Unix so you could use NFS for file sharing, or maybe your IDE can log in via SFTP, or you could even use Samba because Windows is in the scenario.\nYes, it will be fast enough.

If RAM consumption gets too high I have no problems with processes being terminated. How do I disable swap?\nNote: I do not have a swap partition and this is running in a VM (VMware)\n\nA: If you're concerned about the content of the swap, you can always turn it off as specified in the usual way with sudo swapoff -a and then fill the swap device with zeros or random data using dd.\nFirst use the content of fstab to find your swapfile or device (less /etc/fstab).\nHaving located it and double and triple checked its location at say sda5 or /swapfile (swap partitions were replaced by default with a swapfile in Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty Zapus) and beyond).\nIn the case of a swap partition or drive (prefaced with /dev): issue the \"disk destroyer\" command (not to be used lightly),\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=swap, replacing the word swap with the swap device or file you located in /etc/fstab\nto blast it full of zeros or\nsudo dd if=/dev/random of=swap again replacing the word swap with the swap device or file you located in /etc/fstab\nto blast it full of random data.\nIn the case of a swapfile (prefaced with only a path):, you can simply delete the file with sudo rm /path/to/swapfile, but it's better to just fill it with garbage as described above, so that the next time you turn swap on with\nswapon -a\n\nthe system will happily use it again. If you have plenty of RAM you may not need swap at all. Issue the command\nfree\n\nwhen the system is under heavy load and see how much is in use to make this determination.\nIf you determine that you permanently don't need swap (for hibernation or anything else) you can simply comment out that line in fstab as suggested here.\n\n\nA: You may disable swap after reboot by just commenting out (add # in front of the line) the swap entry in the /etc/fstab file. It will prevent the swap partition from automatically mounting after a reboot. To do this in a single command:\nsudo sed -i '/ swap / s/^\\(.*\\)$/#\\1/g' /etc/fstab\n\nOr simply:\nsudo sed -i '/ swap / s/^/#/' /etc/fstab\n\nNow your swap entry on /etc/fstab will look similar to this:\n#UUID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxxx-xxx-xxxxxxxxxxx none            swap    sw              0       0\n\nWith your own specific numbers and lower case letters instead of the letters \"x\".\n\nA: Using   \nsudo swapoff -a  \n\nis the usual way to turn off swap, with the swapon -a command used to turn it back on.\nSee man swapoff   for more information about turning off swap for explicit devices.\n\nA: Go into a terminal and execute this command: gnome-disks. It is not installed in all distributions. If so, follow the instructions printed to install it and try again. Look for a device with the word 'swap' on the left pane. It usually has a size the same as your physical memory. Click the square button to disable it. Authenticate this change with your root password.\nScreenshot:\n\nIn the System Monitor application (gnome-system-monitor), you will see it reports the swap area as 'not available'. The swap area is disabled, but not deleted. You can enable it easily again in the future. Deleting the swap space has caused my system no harm, but you will create more work for yourself if you do decide you want it back (hibernation) in the future.\nTo prevent it from mounting at startup, you should go into the \"Edit Mount Options...\" in gnome-disks and uncheck \"Mount at startup\".\n\nA: sudo swapoff -a\n\nAbove command disables swap only for a current session, you need to comment out swap partition in /etc/fstab file. To do this you just need to add \"#\" (comment line) to the beginning of swap line. Steps are as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open fstab file, type sudo gedit /etc/fstab in terminal. \n\n\nFile's contents would look like this:\nproc            /proc           proc    nodev,noexec,nosuid 0       0\n/host/ubuntu/disks/root.disk /               ext4    loop,errors=remount-ro 0       1\n/host/ubuntu/disks/swap.disk none            swap    loop,sw         0       0\n#/dev/sda10 /media/ASD  vfat    defaults    0   0\n#/dev/sda1  /media/98   vfat    defaults    0   0\n\n\n\n*Just add hash (#) to the beginning of the swap partition line, so the line looks as:\n\n\n#/host/ubuntu/disks/swap.disk none            swap    loop,sw         0       0\n\n\n*Reboot your PC\n\n\nA: It may be lame solution, but I used it often.\nYou can simply type\nsudo -s\ncrontab -e\n\nAnd add\n@reboot sudo swapoff -a  \n\nSo, it will be disabled automatically on boot.\n\nA: Replace the defaults with sw,noauto in the line which consists of the swap entry in the file /etc/fstab:\n/dev/mapper/centos-swap swap  swap    sw,noauto        0 0\n\n(The path /dev/mapper/centos-swap is probably different for you).\nNow checkout the output after reboot, your swap never get mounted:\n$ free -m\n              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available\nMem:           3791         100        3408           8         282        3483\n**Swap:             0           0           0**\n\n", "Q: Distorted graphics on start up So I am using dual monitors and every time I boot up my machine after entering my password to login, both screens show distorted graphics which eventually go away.

Viruses for Linux are not that mature to affect us. The smaller marketshare might have something to do with it. Or that the average Linux user is more aware of what he/she is doing. Might be all of those. But nevertheless a Linux virus like they appear in Windows has yet to be found.\n2 problem area's:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can execute it with wine. Wine has restrictions but this can(/will) affect your wine 'partition' and programs used with wine and everything you can access from within wine as long as the Linux permissions let you. So -never- use sudo or go to root when using wine (this is more of a general rule and not related to Viruses).\n\n*If you use Ubuntu to download a file with a virus and then move the file to a Windows system this virus will be activated on executing that file and it will affect your Windows system.\nSo the answer to your question is: yes, if you move those files to a Windows system it will be able to harm your Windows system.

I normally just leave the window in the background and simply use ssh. Extra info: The drive i believe is NTFS\n\nA: Yes, normally the automatic mount is done through gvfs, and this does not run until you log in. The reason for that is that otherwise, the system cannot know which user should be given the rights to the mounted disk (remember that NTFS does not allow the Unix permissions and ownership!), and mounting as root would prevent any other user from mounting it.\nDepending on what you want to achieve, you have two options.\n\n\n*\n\n*If this is a disk that is always attached, then make an apropriate entry in /etc/fstab. It will be mounted at boot time.\n\n*Use the udev system to create a rule to automount the disk.\n\n*Mount manually after you log in with ssh.

I'd like to disable the Guest account and I'd like the only login accounts listed at startup to be accounts you can actually log in with.\n\nA: You had to have created a password during installation--if you were not the one who installed the system, ask for the password from the person who did.

But what is the best solution for now when we are using Ubuntu (Gnome) and Windows?\n\nA: It appears that if you create a file and a symbolic link on computer A, on computer B dropbox just creates two separate copies of the file. Probably not what you want.\nThe closest equivalent to a .lnk file in Linux is a desktop file. An example link-type .desktop file is a text file containing:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Invoice_5.doc\nType=Link\nURL=file:///home/username/Dropbox/Clients/SomeName/Invoice_5.doc\n\nAll of these fields are mandatory, and the URL must conform to the file URL scheme, so only absolute paths are possible.\nTo automate creating such links, you'll need to look into adding a custom action to Nautilus.\n\nA: Why don't you create symbolic links?\nln -s Invoices/Invoice_5.doc Client/SomeName/\n\nwill create a symbolic link in the directory Client/SomeName/ with the original remaining in Invoices/. Of course, you can do it with a Nautilus (right-click, \"Make link\").\nHowever, I don't know DropBox and I do not know how DropBox treats symbolic links.\n", "Q: How do I install Logkeys?

After unpacking 0 B will be used.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: Package lkl was only used for an (now) old release of Ubuntu. The package on launchpad shows only Hardy.\nSo if you want this you need to install the source code from here. Download it, open a console and extract the files from the archive. The following commands should install it:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd lkl\n\n*./configure\n\n*make\n\n*make check (not required but it does some tests).\n\n*sudo make install\nto install the package program and you should have the command lkl on your system. \n", "Q: partitioning SSD + HDD I recently bought an SSD drive 128 GB and I would like yo have your suggestions on partitioning and installing Ubuntu 12.10 on it.\nFirst of all my drives are :\n\n\n*\n\n*HDD 640 GB\n\n*SSD Samsung 830 series 128 GB\n\n\nWhat's the best partitioning for these drives ? 128 GB is sure enormous amount of space only for / (root) . \nIs it a good choice if I make 2 partitions on SSD (20 GB / and 100 /home) and leave HDD as backup drive for my data (files,movies,music etc) ? In this case what mount point must have HDD ?\nCan you suggest me the best partitioning for my drives ?\n\nA: I think your idea to partition the SSD into a smaller root and larger home and use the HDD for large data files (movies, backups) is perfect. At least that is exactly my setup.\nClearly, /root has to be on the SSD (because this is where the SSD will be most advantageous), and clearly, the root partition does not need much space. Actually, 20 Gb is still an overkill -- I have 15Gb and still over 3Gb free with tons of software installed.\nAlso, if you plan for a swap partition, put in on the SSD.\n/home makes perfect sense on the SSD, as there are tons of user-specific configuration files that need to be accessed quickly.\nFinally, if you run any kind of databases you might consider creating a database partition on the SSD. SSD are not much faster than HDD when it comes to data transfer rates, but they beat HDD by order of magnitude in terms of access time -- and this is often the limiting factor in databases.\nAs for the mount point: you can make your HDD mount for example to /data, and then create symbolic links in your /home that point to a particular directories on the /data:\nln -s /data/Videos ~/Videos/\n\n\nA: Why do you want your \"/\" (root) and \"/home\" be on separate partitions? If you have no good reason for this, leave them on the same partition. This will save you some space.\nI would go with the following setup (sda - SSD, sdb - HDD):\n\n\n*\n\n*sda1 - / \n\n*sda2 - 2GB swap\n\n*sdb1 - /home/media\n\n\nMake sure to turn on TRIM support in \"/etc/fstab\" !\n\nA: You should consider bcache, which will copy often-accessed data from the HDD to the SSD.  See How do I install and use flashcache/bcache to cache HDD to SSD?\n", "Q: Beep at resuming from suspend Since the upgrade from Precise to Quantal, the kernel beeps (quite loud) when waking from suspend. Is there a way to disable the beep?\n\nA: You can try disabling the kernel module that is responsible for creating the beeps. Just edit the file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf and add the lines\nblacklist pcspkr\nblacklist snd_pcsp\n\nIf you save the file and reboot your PC should not beep any more. Consider that your PC doesn't beep any more at all. This might be what you want, but if not, this is not the right way for you.\n", "Q: Is this tactic of switching from btrfs to ext4 safe? I've been using btrfs on Ubuntu 12.10 for both / and /home for several weeks. Through out the time I've come to the conclusion that ext4 performs better on my system and I'd like to switch back however I've found no easy way of converting both my btrfs partitions to ext4.\nToday I've come up with an idea however I'm not sure how safe it is: I'm going to boot from a live environment and shrink my home partition. On the newly created space I'm going to tar my / and /home, reformat the old partitions and finally untar back onto the new ext4 partitions and update grub.\nTechnically this should be safe however I'm sure that there's some quirk that needs to be done after the whole process which I'm not aware of.\nHow safe is the process described above and is there a better way of doing it?\n\nA: This will not work for the root partition (special device files, kernel etc.). Unless you have very good reasons not to, I would install the system from scratch.\nAlso, I would not modify both partitions at the same time, but proceed step by step, always checking that everything works.\nAnd I would start by doing a backup.\nI would proceed as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a rigorous backup on an external disk\n\n*Test that the backup works and that you can restore the data\n\n\nNow, to the /root partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from live CD. Delete the root partition. Format ext4. Install system from scratch.\n\n*Check that the new system works.\n\n\nAs for /home, rather than using tar, I would move it to the new ext4, check that it works and then delete btrfs and expand ext4. However, if disk space is an issue, do as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from live CD. Shrink the home partition.\n\n*Boot normally and test that the data is not corrupted.\n\n*Boot from live CD. Create an ext4 partition in the empty space. Archive your home there.\n\n*Delete the btrfs partition, create an ext4 partition, untar your home (as you have proposed).\n\n*Boot normally and test that all worked as expected and that your /home is fully restored.\n\n*Boot from live CD, remove the ext4 partition containing the archives, expand your /home partition back to the full size.\n\n", "Q: Mount problem on 12.10 I've just done an online upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10 - seemed to have gone well, but now I cannot access other drives (partitions) on my PC, also flash drives.\nI get the following error:\nUnable to mount location - Adding read ACL for uid 1000 to\nmedia/malcolm failed: Operation not supported.\n\nContent of mount -l:\n/dev/sdb8 on / type ext2 (rw,errors=remount-ro)\nproc on /proc type proc (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)\nsysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)\nnone on /sys/fs/fuse/connections type fusectl (rw)\nnone on /sys/kernel/debug type debugfs (rw)\nnone on /sys/kernel/security type securityfs (rw) \nudev on /dev type devtmpfs (rw,mode=0755) \ndevpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,noexec,nosuid,gid=5,mode=0620)\ntmpfs on /run type tmpfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,size=10%,mode=0755)\nnone on /run/lock type tmpfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,size=5242880)\nnone on /run/shm type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev)\nnone on /run/user type tmpfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,size=104857600,mode=0755)    \nbinfmt_misc on /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc type binfmt_misc (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)\ngvfsd-fuse on /run/user/malcolm/gvfs type fuse.gvfsd-fuse (rw,nosuid,nodev,user=malcolm)\n\nHere's some more system info \n(fdisk)\n$ cat /etc/fstab\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n# <file system> <mount point> <type> <options> <dump> <pass> proc /proc proc nodev,noexec,nosuid 0 0 /dev/sdb8 / ext2 errors=remount-ro 0 1\n# swap was on /dev/sdb1 during installation UUID=2bafe271-cb66-41ae-a4e4-831fa3b85fbe none swap sw 0 0 \n# swap was on /dev/sdb9 during installation UUID=1f1e2de9-4983-4105-8a64-c8da5382ca2d none swap sw 0 0\n\n\nA: Try creating/setting ownership on the path /media/malcolm\nsudo mkdir -p /media/malcolm\nsudo chown malcolm:malcolm /media/malcolm\n\n", "Q: How to drag widgets from monitor to monitor in kubuntu?

In the second case I need other packages (apr, apr-util and pcre) and so I abandoned the attempt.\n\nA: It is because when you use apt-get (default package manager for Ubuntu), it automatically installs the dependencies. But when installing manually (using ./configure, make and make install), you'll have to make sure that the dependencies are already installed for the program to work. Otherwise, you'll have to manually install the required dependencies as well.\nYou can refer the answer to this question for further details:\nInstalling suggested/recommended packages?\n", "Q: WIFI no longer working for no apparent reason.....on 12.04 Since today, my wifi LED is off, I cannot enable it and it seems that the OS cannot detect the Wifi card at all.

I've searched around Ask Ubuntu and the App Developer site, but I can't seem to find the answers to my questions.\nI'm wanting to get back into programming, and I'd eventually like get into app development for Ubuntu, but I'm not sure where to get started. \nWhich version of Ubuntu is currently recommended for app development, especially for those wanting to publish their apps to the Software Centre?\nShould app developers use the current LTS release, or, can any of the new releases be used?\nShould developers use the 32-bit or 64-bit edition of Ubuntu, or does this not matter?\nWhat effect would the above choices have on the eventual publication of an app?\n\nA: Just use the version you want to use yourself. If you stick to LTS stick with it. If you want the newer Ubuntu use that. In general it does not matter what version you use; of course the more difficult your application, the more dependencies, the more you will run into situations where an older Ubuntu does not have a package you require for it to work. But the difference between 12.04 and 12.10 is not that big. \nEven if you include packages that are available as of a certain Ubuntu version you need to take care of that in your application yourself, limit the application to a certain Ubuntu version and newer or provide a version that can be used on that version of Ubuntu. It is even possible to create a backport for your application so you can have users get it to use on Hardy (but... most of us would probably not care for that ;) )\nIf you want it in the official Ubuntu Software Center you are not going to get in into 12.10 and should aim for 13.04 or 13.10. Since you need to follow the official procedure for submitting it. You can skip those steps by creating a PPA. \n", "Q: 12.10 screen resolution on Acer Aspire S3 I'm new to Linux and recently installed 12.10 alongside Windows on my laptop.\nInitially 3D screen effects (i.e., Docky) were not working and I tried different things like installing and reinstalling nvidia-current, compiz, etc... \nNow, I think I messed up the display drivers completely.

If you are running low on space there are other alternatives to tidy things up, such as those in  this question.\nFor an ext2 or an ext3 system fsck normally takes a couple of minutes or less, but it depends on the size of the partition being checked.

I thought I found the answer with a google search that suggested using this code where user is my username. Unfortunately now my media hard drives won't mount. I am the only user of this computer and should have superuser privileges. When I try to mount the hard drives I am asked for a password but my password doesn't work. It also won't let me take a screenshot. Action: org.freedesktop.udisk2.filesystem-mount-system. FWIW the cradle is downloading fine but it looks like the code removed or changed my superuser password\n\nA: You left out the -a switch to add, rather than replace your groups.  Now you are ONLY in the dialout group.  You will need to boot into rescue mode and go to a root shell, make sure the disk is mounted r/w, and put yourself back in the other groups:\nmount -o remount,rw /\nusermod -G dialout,adm,cdrom,plugdev,admin\n\n", "Q: Unity doesn't appear after installing Nvidia drivers I've just installed 12.10 from scratch. Unity also started okay, but in a poor resolution. I found a setting (I think it was in \"software sources\") to change the display driver to Nvidia, and then I rebooted.\nWhen Ubuntu now starts, it goes to the desktop (I see a file that I saved to the desktop) but there are no other screen elements -- no Unity, no menu bar at the top, no window decoration, nothing.\nCtrl-Alt-T and Ctrl-Alt-F2 work as they should, but it's kinda limiting... \n\n\n*\n\n*How can I restore the default driver? I guess I need a way to open those \"software sources\" settings again - or anything else that could fix it! I hope I don't have to type all this by hand.\n\n*How can I install a proper Nvidia driver so that I can get up to 1280x1024? My old tricks don't seem to work, but perhaps they might if I solve #1... \n\n\nA: To restore the default driver you have to uninstall the package nvidia-current. You can do this in your STTYs (Ctrl-Alt-F[1-6]).\nsudo apt-get remove nvidia-current\n\nAfterwards simply reboot and you should be fine.\n\nA: The headers I have were newer than the kernel I was running. For that reason I had to upgrade my kernel version. Then, I would recommend the following procedure:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install linux-source\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\nsudo apt-get remove nvidia-current\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\n\nA: I just went through this myself, the problem is that there is a bug in the Ubuntu installer that removes the Linux Headers needed for the Nvidia drivers to work. \nYou'll need to do the following:\nFrom a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic && sudo apt-get remove nvidia-current && sudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nIf you don't see output from nvidia-current being installed then one of the first two commands failed.\nYou'll need to reboot, and once you do you'll be able to use your computer again.\n\nA: In my case the problem was the proprietary driver from NVIDIA which doesn't work on Optimus laptops. All I had to do was running\nsudo nvidia-uninstall\n\nand removing /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nOBS: You need to turn off X server to do that. Use ctrl+alt+f1 to go to \"interfaceless\" mode and type\nsudo stop lightdm\n\nAfter uninstalling run\nsudo start lightdm\n\n\nA: I had the same issue, nothing helped until I ran this:\nsudo apt-get autoremove fglrx --purge\n\n", "Q: X : conditional xorg.conf file during startup I've got a computer which I use at a couple of different sites, and I've got differen monitors at those sites. What I've done is that I've ceated different xorg.conf files for each of these sites.\nNow, I've created a script which queries the nvidia driver for connected monitors, and based on those I apply the right xorg.conf file. However, I'd like this process to take place automatically during startup. However, I can't really get things to work.\nI've been trying with Upstart, and created the following monitors.conf file in /etc/init:\ndescription \"configure monitors\"\n\nstart on starting gdm\ntask\nsetuid root\nexec /etc/X11/monitors.sh\n\nI've read that start on starting gdm is the right way to run a script just before X11 is about to start. I need to run the script just before X11 to have X11 to pick up the right X11 .conf file. However, nothing really happens?\n\nA: I solved this by having the /etc/init/monitors.conf file to contain the following:\ndescription \"configure monitors\"\n\nstart on login-session-start\n\nexec /home/myuser/.x11/monitors.sh\n\n", "Q: Dual booting Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.10 on UEFI laptop I have a notebook pre-installed with Windows7 and I installed Ubuntu 12.10 on it following the standard installation steps in the installation image.\nThe only problem is that on reboot the machine continues to boot Windows ignoring the presence of Ubuntu (Grub never comes up).\nMy partition scheme is this\nsda1: NTFS 612MB\nsda2: NTFS 50GB (after resizing during Ubuntu installation.

Tried rEFInd boot manager but it doesn't support NTFS partitions.\nI don't know what else to try. My next attempt is to try to install GRUB by hand to the MBR.\nAny other Ideas?\n\nA: If the partition data you presented is accurate, you are not booting in UEFI mode. The computer may support UEFI boots, but most UEFI computers also include a compatibility feature that enables them to boot in BIOS/legacy mode, and my hunch is that's what you're using.\nTo better diagnose this, I recommend you download the Boot Info Script and run it from a live CD. Post a link to the RESULTS.txt file that the script generates. This information will tell us how GRUB is installed, give us more details about your partitions, etc.\n\nA: I have had the same issue, and a few more... This is how I sorted it out:\nI finally sorted it, after understanding a few things and doing:\nInstalling Ubuntu (you have done that already)\nCreating a Live-USB or LIVE-CD (I did it with Universal-USB-Installer)\nrunning Live USB (just restarting your computer for CD, otherwise entering BIOS and selecting usb for booting)\nInstalling and running boot-repair from Dash Home->terminal with:\nLocating boot-repair with this command:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair  \n\nUpdating with:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nInstalling it with:\nsudo apt-get install boot-repair\n\n\n\n*\n\n*GRUB came out here\n\n\nThen I logged and couldn't click on anything until I:\nSelected Ubuntu Classic/2D in login screen.\n\n\n*\n\n*Here I was able to click on things after\n\n\nUpdating with Software Up to date at the top right hand corner\nRestarting and selecting normal mode\nHope it helps, I just fixed it two hours ago!\n", "Q: Is there a way to make the speaker silent while the headphone-jack keeps working? 12.04LTS The PC I am working on is in a loud environment.

You need to check for it.)\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install kvm libvirt-bin virtinst bridge-utils\n\nThis gets you the requisite packages.\nsudo adduser `id -un` libvirtd\n\nThis puts you in the requisite group to play with virtualization.

If you need help using virsh to create and manage guests, please ask that as a separate question - it gets pretty chewy. :)\nIf you want to use virt-manager running on a remote workstation, be aware that you will need working SSH access to the server from that workstation.  As long as you have that, and as long as the user you're SSHing in as has been added to the libvirt-bin group as shown above, it will 'just work' from there - you'll set up the connection in virt-manager on the remote machine as \"type SSH\" and specify username and ip address from there, and it will prompt you for a password on connection (unless you've set up passwordless public-key auth, in which case it'll use that).\n\nA: I have run into the same issue.\nTo get past it, open up the terminal and enter:\nsudo virt-manager\n\nThen enter your password and the GUI should open right up.\nI hope this helps!\n\nA: You haven't mentioned what your virtualization flavor is.\nI have no experience with libvirt; nonetheless, like you, I've found myself in need of a virtual-machine manager. Here is how I solve the problem.\nI'm using Virtualbox, currently version 4.2. This version installs a service called vboxweb-service, and with this service activated at boot, apache web server and phpvirtualbox now I've got a fully function virtual-machine-manager that I can use even when I'm not at the office.\nUnfortunately the virtualbox script that is supposed to boot and shutdown the virtual machines automatically isn't completely functional, so I've created a script with some code I've found online, it's a bit slow, but will do the job until vboxautostart-service gets completed.\nFollow this guide: How to autostart a virtualbox vm and of course the phpvirtualbox guide too.\n\nA: *\n\n*The user is a member of libvirtd.\n\n\n*The end user does not have rights to the socket.

(nevermind this setup since is just for dev)\nthis is my user's .profile : \n# set PATH so it includes flash scripts\nif [ -d \"/var/www/flash/scripts\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"/var/www/flash/scripts:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nwhen trying to run as sudo i get:\nsudo: script: command not found    \n\nany ideas?\n\nA: When you run the script as sudo you are trying to access root. So your $HOME/.profile wont be accessed instead /root/.profile will be accessed.\nSo make the changes what ever you did in $HOME/.profile to /root/.profile. To create /root/.profile. Use the following commands.\nsudo su\ncd /root\ntouch .profile\n\nafter making the changes try running the script.\nor edit $HOME/.bashrc and add the following line\nalias sudo='sudo env PATH=$PATH $@'\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: that is the behavior of sudo in ubuntu..\nfor example run following command\necho 'echo $PATH' | sh\n\nand than this one\necho 'echo $PATH' | sudo sh \n\nyou see the output is different!\nto avoid different paths put the following in your ~/.bashrc\nalias sudo='sudo env PATH=$PATH'\n\n\nA: You can preserve the value of $PATH when using sudo. Use visudo to add $PATH to the list of variables to keep. A line like the following in /etc/sudoers should do the trick:\nDefaults env_keep += \"PATH\"\n\n\nA: You can also move your file in a sudoers used directory :\n    sudo mv $HOME/bash/script.sh /usr/sbin/ \n\n", "Q: Does the Nexus 7 version of Ubuntu support the same software as the desktop version? I'm wondering whether the Nexus 7 version of Ubuntu ('Ubuntu on Android') supports the same software (i. e., VirtualBox, Google Chrome, LibreOffice Writer) as the desktop version. Is there any difference between the Nexus version and the Android version in terms of software support?\n\nA: The Nexus tablet is not a full PC. It has an ARM CPU, which while having a pretty OK clock speed, doesn't necessarily perform well at some very CPU intensive tasks. It is designed for minimal power consumption. It also does not have the same instruction set as the x86 CPUs you're used to using in a PC. Therefore, some software will just outright not work or be available (such as VirtualBox), or may perform very poorly. You can see what packages are available by looking through the archive for binary packages built for the architectures armhf or all.\nHowever, most software will be available, even though there are plenty of packages in the archive which only build on x86 architectures, or even on other architectures, but not ARM.\n\nA: As dobey said it has a different processor architecture, so to summarise it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Most software that emulates another systems like Virtualbox, VMWare or Wine will not work. Some, like Qemu will work as they have a processor emulation but much more slowly.\n\n*Most open source software will work, as most will compile fine to arm.\n\n*Most closed source software won't work, Adobe Flash, Reader, Chrome (as opposed to Chromium), commercial games, etc... as most companies don't ship arm binaries for Ubuntu.\nIn every case, expect poorer performance, specially in heavy packages like LibreOffice.\n\nA: Only apps that have been compiled for armhf will run on the Nexus7.  If there are any that you'd really like to use that aren't compiled for armhf yet, you may have to compile it.  However, it is my understanding that most apps would be available for armhf at this point. \n", "Q: Can't find my Ubuntu partition after laptop crashed My laptop crashed last week and as a first step, I reinstalled the hatefulness that is Windows 7.\nNow I can't see my Ubuntu partition but when I try to install the new version of Ubuntu, I get a message asking if I want to uninstall.  This suggests to me that my Ubuntu partition is hiding somewhere!\nCan anyone help please?\nI can't be absolutely certain as I've been using Ubuntu for a while now but I think I had version 11.10 running.\n\nA: By installing Windows you erased the Ubuntu partition.\nMy guess to why it's asking to uninstall Ubuntu upon the installation, is that GRUB still lives on your hard disk.\nSo if you want to install Ubuntu just skip the uninstall question.\n", "Q: gtk problem in ubuntu 12.04 I installed ubuntu 12.04 64-bit I have python 2.7 with some additional packages.

(This step needs internet connection.) \nRead the README & README.debian for instructions on how to install without internet-access \n\nA: There's a step-by-step tutorial on the Codeblocks wiki for installing it on Ubuntu: Installing Code::Blocks nightly build on Ubuntu\nIf you aren't required to use Codeblocks, then perhaps you should try a more easily-installed C++ editor, such as Geany, which you can find in the Software Center or by typing (in the terminal):\nsudo apt-get install geany\n\nGeany is pretty nice as editors go. If you don't have Internet access, make sure to follow the steps to add the Ubuntu installation DVD/CD as a package source: Installing software packages without an Internet connection\n\nA: You've probably downloaded a source tarball. Usually what that means is that you have to install libraries/utilities that are required to the compilation of your software and then configure, build and install the compiled program.\nThere's no single way to do that, usually when you unpack your tarball, there's either a README* or INSTALL* file that describes what needs to be done to install it. It's fairly common to just:\n./configure --prefix=/opt/myapp\nmake\nmake install\n\nThere's a drawback to this method - you'll end up with files installed completely outside of your package management system that your PMS has no idea about and cannot manage. It's usually fine for temporary testing and if you know what you're doing and keep files installed in such a way in a separate directory.\nYou said you're not used to working in the terminal - unfortunately working in the terminal is the least complicated part of compiling programs from scratch.\nYou might want to find your application among packages already available to Ubuntu and download the Ubuntu distribution on the DVD and then use apt-cdrom to add it as a source of available packages.\nPS. if what you've downloaded is an already built application, you can view the contents using:\ntar tjf program.tar.bz2\n\nand \ntar xjf program.tar.bz2\n\nbut you have to be sure that you know what you're running.

I tried to do it myself, but Grub2 configuration files on /etc/grub.d/ looks too cryptic to me, and /etc/defaults/grub can set booting into text but it doesn't seems to allow keeping a menu item for graphical booting as well as setting text or graphics as default, and I prefer to keep the booting process simple to novice users so they won't need to mess with starting services manually or editing the kernel boot command line in Grub2.\nSimilar threads: https://askubuntu.com/a/196613/19967, https://askubuntu.com/a/79682/19967 - completely remove GUI and start it from the command line instead of Grub2 menuitems.\n\nA: A easy way to achieve what you want is editing the file /etc/grub.d/40_custom and create there a manual entry:\nmenuentry 'Ubuntu (Text mode)' --class ubuntu {\n    recordfail\n    insmod gzio\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod ext2\n    set root='hd0,msdos1'\n    linux   /vmlinuz root=/dev/sda1 ro   text\n    initrd  /initrd.img\n}\n\nof course, you need to replace sda1 and msdos1 with the correct partition (or UUID if you prefer).\nAfter that run sudo update-grub and the new entry should be added at the end of the list.\nThis only creates a manual entry.

Wubi has some limitation. Wubi installs Ubuntu on a large virtual partition that is a single big file called the root.disk. In your case, this file seems to be 20GB and is located in the 100GB partition you created.\nWhat to do?\nUbuntu has its own partition format ext4 and can't use the format used by Windows. To install Ubuntu in its own partition, you have to create a live DVD/USB and boot directly from the DVD/USB. \nBefore you boot from Ubuntu DVD/USB, you should delete the 100GB partition while you are in Windows.

I copied a folder containing other subfolders, with some thousands of text files inside, from a FAT32 usb drive to the desktop of ubuntu.\nAfter doing this, I checked the folder properties, to be sure I've correctly copied all, and I see that the two windows presents the same number of files, but have a difference of 88KB ? \nCan this be due to the filesystem change ? My concern is about the reliability of the copy. Any ideas is appreciated. \nThanks\n\nA: Yes, the discrepancy could be due to block size and other file system overhead. Linux (EXT) uses less fragmentation overhead, and a more compact disk structure so most of the times it will result in smaller files.  \nThe easiest tool to compare files is diff if all you want to know if a file is the same.\ndiff file1 file2\n\nIt will tell you if files are identical and show nothing when there is no difference.\nExample:\nrinzwind@schijfwereld:~$ more 1\n1\nrinzwind@schijfwereld:~$ more 2\n1 \nrinzwind@schijfwereld:~$ diff 1 2\n\nand\nrinzwind@schijfwereld:~$ more 1\n1\nrinzwind@schijfwereld:~$ more 2\n2\nrinzwind@schijfwereld:~$ diff 1 2\n1c1\n< 1 \n---\n> 2\n\nYou can also let diff compare directories.\ndiff ~directory1 ~directory2 \n\nWithout any option, diffing 2 directories will tell you which files only exist in 1 directory and not the other, and which are common files. Files that are common in both directories are diffed to see if and how the file contents differ. If you also want to search into subdirectories add the -r option.\nBasically this should not show any differences if a copy was done correctly. \n", "Q: Screen Timeout Ubuntu 12.10 Cinnamon I am running a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.10 with Cinnamon,\nafter roughly 10 minutes the screen turns black.

I install it onto my big hard drive but when I am in ubuntu I cannot access any of the files on that drive as they are all in root.\n\nA: It is part of Linux security that you can not access files owned by root as a normal user.  It has nothing to do with partitions as such.\nYou should however have a separate ext4 partition for your Ubuntu installation if you are doing a full installation.  If you install within Windows this is called a wubi install.\nA wubi install is OK if you want to try Ubuntu, or if Windows is still your primary operating system.  To do a full Ubuntu install you would need to make a bootable Ubuntu disk or USB (LiveDVD or LiveUSB) and boot off that to start the install.\nFor a minimal install of Ubuntu you would need about 8GB (recommended) for the operating system, plus enough space for whatever data you intend to have in your /home directory.  In actual fact Ubuntu will install in under 4GB but this does not really allow for any room for maintenance updates or installing other programmes.\nTo access files owned by root to change things in Linux it's necessary to prefix commands with 'sudo'.  For example to update the system from comand line the command is \"apt-get update\" however as a normal user you will get a permissions error if you do this.  The correct command for your admin user is:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nwhich will update the files list, and \nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nto actually download and install any available updates.\nThe main area where your user has normal access to is /home/username.  Some of the configuration files are kept there so that each user can have their own working environment, and all of the data is also kept there.\nAdvanced partitioning topic:\nYou can have a separate partition for /home if you wish, and this keeps data separate from the / partition.  When Linux boots this separate partition is mounted at /home so that it works seamlessly, as it now appears to be part the / filesystem.  There are some advantages to this, such as making it easier to re-install or upgrade, and the extra safety of having system files and data on separate partitions or even different drives.\n", "Q: package .NET desktop application for UBUNTU is it possible to package a .NET application as a .DEB package and include MONO runtime so the software can be installed automatically and run on UBUNTU?\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to package a .NET application as a deb package, and you can tell it that it depends on mono so that it will be installed if not already present.\nThe best way to do this is to use xbuild to build your mono application. Here is the lines from my debian rules file, for my mono application widemargin\n#!/usr/bin/make -f\n\ninclude /usr/share/cli-common/cli.make\n\noverride_dh_auto_build:\n    xbuild $(CURDIR)/WideMargin.sln /p:Configuration=Release\n\nThen put the following line in your control file:\nDepends: ${cli:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}\n\nThis will automaticaly calculate your dependencies (including mono) and specify them for you.\nThe result is that when you install your Deb mono will be installed if it is not already present.\nIf you need further help with debian packaging of mono applications then the best place to get it is on #debian-cli on IRC OFTC server. These are the people responsible for mono packaging in debian and are really friendly and helpful.\n", "Q: Fan always running I have an HP laptop pavilion dv619ca ( 8 GB RAM ; 64-bit ; i7 ; 256 GB HDD).\nI installed the latest ubuntu 12.10 but the fan is always running and decreasing my battery life.\nI need to know how to fix it please.\nThanks a million :D.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with an HP laptop. I turned out the the graphic driver was unstable, therefore my graphical card became very hot with result that the fan was blowing very hard.\nInstall lm-sensors and check the temperature of your system with sensors. When youre CPU's arent very hot (below 80 degrees) you might have the same problem. \nI 'solved' the problem by disabeling the graphical card and run on the Intel HD Graphics as described here.\n\nA: Looking at http://www8.hp.com/uk/en/support-drivers.html to try to find your model to see if there are any linux drivers for power management, I could not find your model. \nI think this is a power management issue you need the proper drivers, either for the graphical card or other, unless there is no physical obstruction to cooling like keeping it on the cushion, sheets or similar. Unfortunately the info provided was not sufficient to find the model on the internet.\n", "Q: Transferring files from OS X to an Ubuntu Server seems to not copy all the data I have a problem (or at least I think I have a problem) that I am facing for a while an have found no solution so far - to be honest, I am not sure if it is a \"real\" problem at all, but I am unsure about that and found nowhere else an answer. That is why I am desperately hoping for some insight from here.\nThe situation is the following:\nI have an OS X work machine (a Mac Book Air to be precise) and an Ubuntu 12.04 file server.\nNow all I wanted to do is to back up (a lot) of data from the OS X machine to the server. However, that does not seem to work, as it seems never all the data is transferred - no luck whatever I try.\nTo not make it overly complicated, let's just concentrate on my music library in \n/Users/me/Music/iTunes. \nThe recent try I did was to use ftp (ncftp on the client, vsftpd on ubuntu)\nAfter the ftp put -R iTunes I have:\non OS X: Total Size 43,09 GB 10289 Items\non Ubuntu : Total Size 37,58 GB 9293 Items\nWhy is that so? This data cannot be correct, right? Or am I missing something?\nI have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*smb (drag and drop the folders)\n\n*scp\n\n*rsync\n\n\nThere are always a few GB(!) missing and a whole lot of files (the number varies, however).\nIn my desperation, I even tried to use git...but alas, in the case of my Music library it \nbails out early as it cannot handle that much data.\nHas someone any idea why I seemingly are not able to make a good backup of my files over the network? Am I doing someting wrong? I understand that sizes may differ from file system to filesystem, but they wont in the GB range, will they?\nAny ideas how to solve this?\nThank you for any hints.\n\nA: The size and number may not matter. There are blank files (zero length) or directories, preview images (thumbnail), and other anomalies. Also files sizes will change radically on a different file system.\n\nYou need to retry, with a smaller sample.  Try one artist, or one album / collection.  Then try to identify what actually useful data files were not copied.\nReport back on your findings, adding details to the question.\n", "Q: Software to track application profile I am developing a software for number theory investigation, and I am suspicious that is leaking memory.\nIt would be very nice to log the CPU, and RAM usage of this program through some application.

This is not a problem since the permissions of symbolic links are never used.  However,  for\n         each  symbolic  link  listed on the command line, chmod changes the permissions of the pointed-to file.\n         In contrast, chmod ignores symbolic links encountered during recursive directory traversals.\n\nCheck the permissions of the target instead: ll /usr/share/software-center/software-center.\n\nA: If you only want root user to have access to the software center, you will need to change the 'other' access to the file /usr/share/software-center\nsudo chmod 750 /usr/share/software-center\n\nIf you want to restore access to software center for your user you can change the group for the file /usr/share/software-center to your group:\nsudo chown root:username /usr/share/software-center\n\nthis will result in only root and you having access.\nIf you want other users to also have access, you can make a group for this purpose, eg 'install' and make the group access 'install', and add any users you want to give access to this group.\nAs pointed out, /usr/bin/software-center is a link, not the actual file so you can't change its permissions\n", "Q: OSError: [Errno 36] File name too long I'm using rdiff-backup since a long time to pull backups over SSH to the backup-server. Recently rdiff-backup crashed with Errno 36. So I deleted the file which had the long name in the source. However, I can't get rdiff-backup to work again. I keep getting the following notice: \n\nPrevious backup seems to have failed, regressing destination now.\n  Regressing to Tue Sep 11 02:07:50 2012 \n  Exception '[Errno 36] File name too long: '....\n\nThe file name pointed out here is in the destination. I've checked the path, and there is no such file. So, the file is not in the source, nor in the destination, but I keep getting this error. \nI though it might be possible to get completely rid of the last failed backup info, to start from the last working one. That is actually what rdiff-backup is saying. But it keeps on falling over this file which does not exist anymore. \nAny ideas? \nIs there a database where it gets the info about this file from, and where I can remove it? \nThanks! \n\nA: OK. If found the cause of the problem: eCryptFS. The backup destination was located in my encrypted home directory. And obviously long file names are a problem. After moving the destination to an unencrypted folder outside my home, it works.

Since Ubuntu 12.10, you need to install the kernel headers yourself.\nSo, revert your KernelDriver change (the Driver= one does not matter) and install the kernel headers:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\n\nThis should automatically build the nvidia module. When this is completed, reboot or start the Bumblebee daemon:\nsudo start bumblebeed\n\nThen try running optirun glxspheres again.\n\nA: There is even a better way to manage Optimus graphic card on Linux: it's called Primus, it depends on Bumblebee.

Currently the partitions are arranged (shown from left to right on the disk utility) sda1 (WinRE)13GB:sda2(Windows'C')52GB:sda4 with sda5 and sda6(Ubuntu 12.04)46GB:sda3 (Windows'D')49GB. I have downloaded and burnt an Ubuntu 12.10 DVD.\nI want to take space from sda3 and increase the Ubuntu partition. sda3 is virtually empty (only 350MB used) because I am only using Windows for iTunes and a very few drivers/programmes that I need occasionally.\nMy question - can I use the Ubuntu 12.10 DVD to both change the partition scheme to increase the Ubuntu space AND upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10? If so, can anyone point me to a clear set of instructions? Thanks for any advice.\n\nA: Yes you can use the LiveDVD to resize partitions and to upgrade.  Boot off it then select \"try Ubuntu\", then when it has finished booting run Gparted to alter and resize partitions.\nI would actually suggest making the Ubuntu / partition smaller, say about 25GB and increasing the size of /dev/sda3 to fill the rest of the drive and format it as ext4.  You can then use this partition to mount as /home and keep all your data on it.  That way you would have about 85Gb for /home data.\nI note that /dev/sda4 is probably an extended partition with (most likely) sda5 and sda6 inside it.  You'll have to resize and move those before you can resize the extended partition.  I'm thinking sda6 is most likely a swap partition.\nAn alternative approach would be to delete /dev/sda3 (after backing up the 350MB of data) and increasing the size of the extended partition to the end of the disk.  You could then just make another logical ext4  partition inside the extended partion, or resize/move the existing ones according to your needs.\nIf you want to try upgrading 12.04 boot off the LiveDVD and select the upgrade option if it offers one.  I believe this is a better and faster way of upgrading compared to doing an on-line upgrade.\n", "Q: How to get network drive to work in ubuntu I have added this line to my /etc/fstab in my ubuntu environment\nfs-abc-03.abc.mycompany.com:/vol/vol02902/drive /projects/drive nfs intr,nolock 0 0\n\nbut after I reboot and I 'cd /projects/drive', it said 'path not found'.\nWhat else I need to do/trouble shoot this problem?\n\nA: The mountpoint (/projects/drive) needs to exist before the NFS mount can\nsucceed.  So make sure you create it with\n sudo mkdir -p /projects/drive\n\nOnce the mountpoint exists, you can test the mount, to see if you get any displayed\nerror messages (such as the remote server denying mount access, or you have some\nconfiguration typo in your /etc/fstab):\n sudo mount /projects/drive\n\nIf that works, then you should be all set for the next reboot to mount it\nautomatically.\n", "Q: Creating floppy drive special devices under Quantal First, I'd like for the various special devices for different floppy capacities (like /dev/fd0u720 etc.) to be available. I tried to adapt some udev rules I found online. I tried this, which I saved as /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-floppy.rules:\n# change floppy device ownership and permissions\n# default permissions are 640, which prevents group users from having write access\n\n# first fix primary devices (/dev/fd0, /dev/fd1, etc.)\n# also change group ownership from disk to floppy\nSUBSYSTEM==\"block\", KERNEL==\"fd[0-9]*\", GROUP=\"floppy\", MODE=\"0660\"\n\n# next recreate secondary devices (/dev/fd0u720, /dev/fd0u1440, etc.)\nSUBSYSTEM==\"block\", KERNEL==\"fd[0-9]*\", ACTION==\"add\", RUN+=\"create_floppy_devices -c -t $attr{cmos} -m %M -M 0660 -G floppy $root/%k\"\n\nBut to no avail. It seems the create_floppy_devices script isn't provided with 12.10. How do I obtain it?\nSecond: I'm using MATE, and whenever I log in I get a message box saying it tried to mount the drive but failed. How do I disable this?\nThird (which is probably related to the second): Whenever there's a disk in the drive, the motor won't stop spinning. If I do a mdir of it, after it returns, the motor stops, and then starts again. I suspect there's some process in MATE doing this.\nUPDATE: For CentOS 6 (who does have a create_floppy_devices program) the following rules file worked. Saved as /etc/udev/rules.d/98-floppy.rules:\n# change floppy device ownership and permissions\n# default permissions are 640, which prevents group users from having write access\n\n# first fix primary devices (/dev/fd0, /dev/fd1, etc.)\n# also change group ownership from disk to floppy\nKERNEL==\"fd[0-9]*\", GROUP=\"floppy\", MODE=\"0660\"\n\n# next recreate secondary devices (/dev/fd0u720, /dev/fd0u1440, etc.)\n# drive A: is type 4 (1.44MB) - add other lines for other drives\nKERNEL==\"fd0*\", ACTION==\"add\", RUN+=\"/lib/udev/create_floppy_devices -c -t 4 -m %M -M 0660 -G floppy $root/%k\"\n\n\nA: It really seems that create_floppy_devices is not available in Ubuntu. To make this work you can try two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the source code and try to compile it manually. Here is the code of that utility (it is a fork of udev, but you can search in the internet for the original);\n\n*fdutils package provide a command called MAKEFLOPPIES that seem similar to create_floppy_devices. You can check if it suits your needs and adapt that script to use it.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Can I sync Evolution's notes with Ubuntu one?

(I think I forgot something but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it) \n\nA: AMD stopped providing support for Radeon 9800 in 2009, whihc means there won't be any proprietary drivers available.

It can be fixed with a can of compressed air.\nA lot of us ran into this trying to image SD cards for the Raspberry Pi. And with that device you have no option but to boot off of the SD.\nThis raises a fascinating fact. It seems that the lock switch is a purely mechanical \"intent indicator\" that must be sensed by the host device.

However, because it is called Secure Digital and is solid state, you would expect the card to protect itself, not rely on the host.\n\nA: Since it's silly that sudo (essentially 'root') can't access the device with dd it would seem that the error message \"Permission denied\" does not actually mean that root has a permissions problem.  iow it's a red herring.\nDouble check that the device is not still mounted - run the unmount command again as per step 7 and double check that it really is unmounted but still accessible as a device.\nA common problem I've had with making USB boot devices under linux is an inconsistent partition table.  Delete the partition table completely and remake it, then create the new new partition as FAT and format it for good measure.  The errors I get under Linux don't make any more sense than this one, so I'm hoping that this is what your problem is.\nI'll have a shot at removing the partition table under OSX.  Note that I am a linux user, so I'm relying on the fact that OSX is similar, and that the same thing seems to be found for OSX on a google search.\nFirst we'll use dd to erase the partition table on the USB drive.  In a terminal type:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk4 bs=512 count=1\n\nThis should overwrite the first 512 bytes of the device, thus destroying the partition table.  Instructions I found here seem to suggest\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk4 bs=1 count=1024\n\nfor OSX however the difference is minor and I believe the end result should be the same.  As for any dd operation make sure you have the correct partition as there will be nothing left of the data on the device after you press enter.\nNext I believe you should use disk utility to to recreate the partition table, and a new partition, and format it FAT.  I'm a linux user, so I'm afraid I can't be more specific but I believe that the disk utility should complain that that there is no partition table and either make one for you, or prompt you to do so.\n\nA: I came across this once too. Use 'diskutil' to check the device your SD card appears as:\ndiskutil list\n\nThen unmount it (Don't unmount using 'Finder', it wont work):\ndiskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk_4\n\nNow use the 'dd' command to load your image:\nsudo bash -c 'gzip -dc the_image_file.img.gz | dd of=/dev/disk_4'\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: Use sudo in front of the dd command\nsudo dd if=/Users/JPurcell/Downloads/Fedora-18-x86_64-Live-Desktop.iso of=/dev/disk2\n\nWARNING: Improper use of the sudo command could lead to data loss or the deletion of important system files. Please double-check your typing when using sudo. Type \"man sudo\" for more information.\nthat fixed the permission denied for me. it seems to be working now. \nand I was root before hand. I also did the \nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk4 bs=1 count=1024 before sudo dd if=/Users/JPurcell/Downloads/Fedora-18-x86_64-Live-Desktop.iso of=/dev/disk2\n\nI did it right after without reformatting the usb drive. \nI dont know if its been successful but lights blinking on the drive and terminal is not giving me errors.\n\nA: Here was my solution:\nSudo wasn't asking for my password when I tried to use it.  I thought that was odd.\nSo, I su'd to root and did it from there.\nsudo su\n<enter password>\n\nThen I ran the commands and they worked.\n\nA: Potentially try ejecting the usb drive and reformatting first, then retry all the steps. diskutil list, unmount, then write the iso to the disk. I ran into similar issues where dd was giving permission denied errors and I reformatted my usb and everything worked correctly.\n\nA: ls -l /dev/disk2 gave me this result:\nbrw-r-----  1 root  operator    1,   5 Dec 17 10:27 /dev/disk2\n\nI solved the problem by changing the owner of the file:\nsudo chown <myUser>:<myGroup> /dev/disk2\n\nThen I was able to dd the files to the USB stick.\n\nA: From this related question, a comment on the highest-voted answer seems to suggest you aren't the only one having troubles with dd.\nThe same answer recommends using optical media (a.k.a. a LiveDVD) instead of a USB drive if you can, as that seems more reliable.\n*Note: I am not and never was a Mac user, so I'm afraid I can't help out much more than this.\n\nA: Well, I struggle a lot with this but finally succeed...\nserver:~ myusername$ sudo dd if=/Users/myusername/Desktop/ubuntu1304.img of=/dev/disk1s1 bs=1m\n\nWARNING: Improper use of the sudo command could lead to data loss\nor the deletion of important system files.

After the system unmounted the root partition, I detected that some files are missing in the filesystem.\nwifi and the gwibber icons disappeared from the indicator applet\nI am trying to check if other files are missing using the ls program and the locate program, which woks with indexes of a previous state of the filesystem.\nThus, \nlocate /usr/share/icons/* | xargs ls -d 2>&1 >/dev/null\n\nserves for that purpose because ls displays an error message for each non-existent file that locate locates; and I can count the missing files like this:\nlocate /usr/share/icons/* | xargs ls -d 2>&1 >/dev/null | wc -l\n\nexcept for the case where filenames have blank spaces in them; and, not very surprisingly, that is the case with Ubuntu (OMG!! It is no longer \"forbidden\" like in good old times).\nIf, for example, I use:\nlocate /usr/share/* | xargs -Iñ ls -d 'ñ' 2>&1 >/dev/null\n\nit is not working because there is some kind of interference in the syntax between the redirections of the standard outputs and the use of the parameter -I.\nCan anyone please help me with this syntax or giving another idea?\nEDIT.-\nI have eliminated the problem with the blank spaces, but it is not very elegant, like this:\nlocate /usr/share/* | sed -e 's/^/\"/' -e 's/$/\"/' | xargs ls -d 2>&1 >/dev/null|\n\nBut I'm sure there must be many better solutions which I am eager to read.\n\nA: Both locate and xargs have an argument to separate filenames using the null character instead of space or newline. That should fix the problem with spaces in filenames.\nlocate -0 /usr/share/icons/* | xargs -0 ls -d 2>&1 >/dev/null\n\nfrom man locate:\n   -0, --null\n          Separate  the  entries  on  output using the ASCII NUL character\n          instead of writing each entry on a separate line.   This  option\n          is  designed  for interoperability with the --null option of GNU\n          xargs(1).\n\nfrom man xargs:\n   --null\n   -0     Input  items  are  terminated  by a null character instead of by\n          whitespace, and the quotes and backslash are not special  (every\n          character is taken literally).  Disables the end of file string,\n          which is treated like any other  argument.   Useful  when  input\n          items  might  contain  white space, quote marks, or backslashes.\n          The GNU find -print0 option produces  input  suitable  for  this\n          mode.\n\n", "Q: Will apt-get dist-upgrade upgrade my system to a newer version? I am using Ubuntu 12.04 right now. If I use the command sudo apt-get dist-upgrade will that upgrade my Ubuntu to 12.10? Does that mean I won't be using the LTS version after that? I don't want to use Ubuntu 12.10 because I've already tried it and it's very heavy for my netbook.\n\nA: No, sudo apt-get dist-upgrade will not upgrade to a new Ubuntu release. It will just install available updates for the Ubuntu release you already have installed.\nUnlike sudo apt-get upgrade it may install new packages or remove installed packages if that is necessary to satisfy dependencies. So be careful when using it.\n\nA: you cannot jump from 12.04 to 13.04 directly you would have to have update manger set to normal then do \nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nor\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nthe difference between the commands is that dist-upgrade wants you to change your config files during the upgrade\nthey both will upgrade your dist when the time comes \nsudo apt-get upgrade \nonly upgrades the software on your system it does not install or remove packages like dist-upgrade.\n\nA: You can read the man-page of apt-get to see what each command do. \nOpen the manual \nman apt-get\n\nFind the section dist-upgrade and read\n\ndist-upgrade \n       in addition to performing the function of upgrade,\n       also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions\n       of packages; apt-get has a \"smart\" conflict resolution system, and\n       it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the\n       expense of less important ones if necessary. So, dist-upgrade\n       command may remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list file\n       contains a list of locations from which to retrieve desired package\n       files. See also apt_preferences(5) for a mechanism for overriding\n       the general settings for individual packages\n\n\nSee also: What is “dist-upgrade” and why does it upgrade more than “upgrade”?\nIn order to upgrade Ubuntu to a newer release you have to run in terminal\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nWe read from the man-page \nman do-release-upgrade\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\nUpgrade  the  operating  system  to  the  latest  release from the\n  command-line.  This is the preferred command if the machine has\n  no graphic    environment  or  if the machine is to be upgraded over a\n  remote connection\n\n\nA: If you do not want to upgrade to non-LTS versions, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Ubuntu Software Center.\n\n*Go to Edit -> Software Sources.\n\n*Go to the Updates tab and make sure you have selected For long-term support versions in the Notify of a new Ubuntu version.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and run sudo apt-get update (just to be sure :) ).\n\n*Now, when you run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade it'd be upgraded to the next LTS version and not non-LTS versions.\n", "Q: What is the recommended partition scheme for my Ubuntu Server? I am going to deploy Ubuntu server having following servers on it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bind server\n\n*DHCP server\n\n*LAMP Server\n\n*OpenSSH Server\n\n*Ldap server\n\n*Mongodb database\n\n*FTP server\n\n*Mail server\n\n*Samba server\n\n*NFS server\n\n*In the future,  I want to set up Openstack for PAAS. \n\n\nI currently have a Raid 5 filesystem with 10TB storage.\nHow should I set up my partition scheme?\nI am looking to ensure that I don't have problems in future and that storage size can be easily expanded. Can you suggest a partition scheme giving specific percentage of storage to partitions like /, /boot, /var, /etc?\n\nA: Before you decide on partitioning schemes it might help to actually understand the reasons for splitting various parts of the linux.\nFirstly multiple partitions are 'safer' since if one filesystem is damaged, the others should be alright. This won't save you from a disk failure. Backups would, as might the parity scheme in your raid level.\nSecondly it was a way to use multiple drives of different styles before LVM - this is moot for you \nSource - Linux Installation and getting started\nIn short, the multi partition scheme is sort of a relic of older times, continued for legacy reasons. If you need to ask why, you're better off with a single partition.\nIn the modern context the smart partitioning method would be to use a single large partition (and a second one, optionally for swap, swap files would be an option). Use LVM so you can add disks if you can if you think you may need to add space. A single large partition means things will handle themselves as long as there's enough space, and you can backup /etc/ /user/local and /home, and use that and a list of installed packages should a bare metal recovery be needed.\n\nA: I generally recommend a /boot of 1GB, a / of 20GB, and a /data which uses the rest of the available space.  This is so that you can get through a fsck / in a hurry if need be; nothing sucks more than having to sit through three hours or more of fsck just to see if your system will be willing to boot at all!\nAside from that, be sure to use LVM on top of your RAID5; it's hard to give further advice without knowing more details of your RAID array - is it hardware, or is it kernel RAID (mdraid)?  Etc.\nOne other note - you might consider RAID10 instead of RAID5, depending on how serious your space needs are.  RAID10 will give you less available storage for the same number and size of drives (n/2 instead of n-1), but it will be both higher performance and more resilient in the event of device failure than RAID5.  (It will also be much, much, MUCH higher performance when actually running in degraded mode if and when a device DOES fail.)\n\nA: There can be no perfect answer to this question, the best one can say is that it depends. The size of /, /boot and /etc don't need too be too much. Where you actually need space is where you'll be storing your content i.e. the websites or user emails etc. This can be configured too but if they're in /var then that's where most of the space would be needed.\n10 TB sounds awesome but one can't be future proof, linux always allows you to add more media and mount them as a subdirectory of say /var in your case giving you and your users a transparent view. \nI haven't gone into percentages and specifics because those would depend on a case to case basis but I hope that you get an idea.\n", "Q: Modem won't respond Modem will not respond in Efax-gtk or in Minicom after initialization. \nThis modem works fine in Windoze, SAME machine, just switched to Ubuntu 12.04 drive by mechanical switch.

This list is not exhaustive.\nThis can be solved by creating a file (e.g. /tmp/pin.txt) containing:\nPackage: *\nPin: release n=*\nPin-Priority: 1001\n\nand running:\nsudo apt-get -o Dir::Etc::Preferences=/tmp/pin.txt dist-upgrade\n\nWarning: This will install the version available in the repositories for ALL packages. Be careful if you have installed any packages from somewhere else (just make sure apt-get is not trying to downgrade anything when prompted for confirmation).\n\nA: Install Synaptic if you don't have it, Open it, then go to Edit > Fix Broken Packages.

I have Ubuntu running on my Lenovo G570, how can I turn off my Radeon graphics card, which is getting heated up a lot while I use it. \n\nA: The Ubuntu Community Help Wiki provides an interesting about Hybrid Graphics and how to disable/enable graphical cards. \n\nA: You might not have an option to turn it off at all. It depends on your computer's BIOS. Go into BIOS (press F2 during Boot), then look for an option to select the graphic adapter. If there is such an option, you can choose between 'Switchable' and 'Integrated'. Select the 'Integrated' Option.\nI'm highlighting again that your BIOS may or may not have this setting available. If it doesn't, then there's not much you can do about it, unfortunately.\n\nA: Finally got it.\nI turned off my graphics card using the command\necho OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch.\nNow its not heating up and i am getting a battery life of about 3.5 hours where i had been getting about 1.5 hours for full discharge before.

I was able to get the set screen brightness to work by setting the values of both /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness and /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness.\nI was trying to set both of them individually to see if one worked, I'm pretty sure just setting acpi_video0/brightness used to work before 13.04 but since I've updated I've been having trouble. \nI would think that both values need to be the same so make sure to check the values you want are correct (acpi_video0/brightness is from 0 - 15 and intel_backlight/brightness is from 0 - 1808). For the record I am running Ubuntu GNOME 13.10 on the same model of macbook pro (8,1).\nSo for me I have it booting with a brightness of 3 so acpi_video0/brightness has a value of 3 and intel_backlight/brightness has a value of 357.

There's no easy way to get any of your data back.\nThere may still be data there in the form of a data stream, but the indexes to the files will be missing.  The more you use the drive the more it gets written to, and the less of that stream there will be to recover. Recovery operations would start with mounting the drive as read only and searching for any indication of the old partition table and allocation tables for the files.

When I load only unity-2d-panel I have problems with global menu, for example: I have close, minimize and maximize buttons on unity panel and on window title bar. I think it's a bug. So can you help me fixing it.\n\nA: Your question is somewhat vague in areas, so I will answer it the best I can given my understanding of what you are asking.\nYou can run the unity-2d panel with the dash from another DE (like Lubuntu) after installing unity-2d (and all the things it pulls in) by pressing Alt+F2 and typing in unity-2d-shell  (or opening a terminal and using the same command)\nThis will give you the lefthand sidebar with the dash. However, this will interfere with your Lubuntu setup as Nautilus handles the desktop, etc...\nIf however you are just trying to run unity-2d log out and choose it from your session menu.\nunity-2d-panel is the upper panel with global menu integration.\nunity is a very self integrated DE, and it is not good at playing with other DE (like LXDE, XFCE4...)  So problems can easily occur trying to use the panel only, or the sidebar only in another DE.\nedit: since my post was down-voted with no reason given, I will add more information here. Though the lack of clarity in the question requires somewhat ambiguous answers, I will continue to try to address my understanding of what the OP might want to do.\nRunning unity-2d-panel global menu by itself is pointless.  A window manager is needed.  if you are trying to remove the unity-2d-shell from your current session, edit your /usr/share/gnome-session/sessions/ubuntu-2d.session file removing the DefaultProvider-shell=unity-2d-shell line and the word shell; from the RequiredProviders line.\nIf you are trying to run it from another window manager then running it with unity-2d-panel may work but by only using some of the components of Unity (a very tightly integrated DE) will probably cause you issues.  unity-2d has been abandoned in all future releases of Ubuntu, so this is only pertains to the LTS (and the older releases that are soon to lose support like 11.10 at the current time of writing this)\nP.S. launchpad is the place to report bugs, if you believe this is a bug file it there.\n", "Q: Number of processes named 'doodle' I have been using 12.10 for a few days.

How to install Macbuntu in Ubuntu 12.10? Currently, there are no updates for Macbuntu. The last update is only for Ubuntu 10.10.

I have a large number of manga (Japanese comics) loosely organized in compressed folders per story, which I sorted into folders by the category of authors. Is there an application that could add tags to each story/compressed folder to indicate, for example, the manga's genre (romance, drama, tragedy, adventure) so if I want to search for manga which have adventure I can easily find them?\nParticularly, is there an application which has a GUI and is not run in the terminal? I'm not that good at using terminal commands.\n\nA: As your question is very specifically about comics, there are really two graphical applications in the repositories called calibre and comix that would be very useful to you. \nYou could manage all your comics in calibre, which has many more tagging and management features than comix, and then just use comix as the default viewer for your .cbr files. This would probably be the best of both worlds as both calibre and comix can read from archived tar and compressed zip folders. \nIf you create your library just with comix, it is possible to add comments per imported folder or comic, and then search throughout your library. If that is sufficient then you could just use comix for management and viewing, although calibre definitely gives your more options for tagging and managing your comics. \nI note that you refer to manga comics, and comix has several features that support manga such as a setting to switch to right to left reading.\nScreenshot featuring Comix with a sample Marvell (tm) comic:\n\n", "Q: How can I add the softwares I have installed from USC of kubuntu 12.04 into kubuntu 12.10 iso installation file I am currently using Kubuntu 12.04.

I don't want to download packages from Ubuntu customization kit (UCK) or similar software.\nI don't prefer using APTonCD or similar software. What I want is to add these software into this Kubuntu 12.10, so that they appear along with the default application which will be installed as default when the OS is installed. Is this possible?\n\nA: No you can't\nBelive me, you can't copy installed s/w to different version of software. But you may can install some packages via aptoncd but still highly dangerous and may lead to system crash .\n\nA: I agree with the other replies that you will not be able to have the apps installed by default unless you build a custom remix. However, you can make installing them after installing the OS a bit easier.\nFirst, install synaptic package manager with the command:\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\n Then open it & search for and install Ubuntu Software center. Next, open Ubuntu Software Center & go to file>>sync between computers. Now you should be able to see the differences.

I've recently installed ubuntu 12.04 on my oldie ThinkPad, along with Python-interpreter idle and obviously Python.\nI'm looking to learn the basics of this programming language, but I've had no luck finding a conclusive beginners guide for the most recent Python that doesn't require knowledge of previous coding language.\nI know how to use the GUI and use terminal for installation or basic tasks, and I have a basic knowledge of BASIC (goto, print, input, if, next, etc.) But absolutely no knowledge of Python or any other coding.\nIf someone could briefly explain or point me in the right direction to a guide, that would be great! \nAlso, if anyone can recommend a better language to start off with for a beginner, I would be very interested. However, from what I've researched it seems Python is the most supported cross-platform and in general?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: When I started python I followed the official documentation, but it seemed too complicated for me at the time.\n\n\n*\n\n*There's a great tutorial series on youtube (you can skip the first one, since you already installed python).\n\n*Lynda has a training on python too, you can watch the second chapters for free.\n\n*You can also find some books on o'reilly from begginer to advanced, I have \"Programming Python 3th edition\" and I really like it.\n\n*This question on stackoverflow has been a guide for me when I wanted more hidden features of python, the answers I found there I couldn't find elsewhere.\nThe way I really started to learn python was using it all the time. Here where I work, I had to backup some files, this was my first official project with python, it took me about a week to finish it. I had to search on google each time I had a problem, but after some time, you get used to the overall language syntax.\nI really recommend you start learning python first, I started learning programming using C, it was hard and I couldn't understand much of it, if I had started with python, my life would be a lot easier. The reason for this is that python is interpreted, the errors are much more readable, for a begginner:\nExample of the classic Hello World in python:\n print \"Hello, World!\" \n\nNow the same program in the C++ language:\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main()\n{\n   std::cout << \"Hello, World!\" << std::endl;\n   return 0;\n}\n\nAt the time, I had many questions when I saw this and I was too terrified to start programming in C++, if I had started with python or C#, I wouldn't be that scarified of learning a new language.\n\nA: Go for Python !! \nThe approach which I think would be a good for learning it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start with: http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/ . The tutorial'll get you started.\n\n*Once you feel comfortable and want to learn more python, start looking at library reference section of docs.python.org website. \n\n*With this you can go for reading code for the libraries present already in the directory /usr/lib/pythonX where X is the version of python you have on your machine. Reading the functions present in these files would familiarize you with the style and conventions you could use to write standard python code and other tricks-n-treats too. \n\n*If you don't want to learn the language too deeply, you could skip step 3 and just start writing some application in python. In essence, just start practising rather than reading standard code. But this is a hard way to learn things.. But that's just my opinion.\n\n\nIn summary, Follow docs.python.org website's tutorial for starting. Then go for other text present on this website. You can read the code present in standard library while referring the website to learn the style you could write python in.\n", "Q: Installation errors on all installs after installing an i386 package on a 64 bit system I am just setting up a new install of Ubuntu 12.04.1 x64\nI need to log on to my workplace citrix so installed the icaclient.

Then follow these directions to remove the i386 packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to remove all i386 packages from Ubuntu 64bit?\n\nA: This is solved now.  The problem was actually two problems.  I cleared out the icaclient problem although this was initially stalled by the second problem which was an uncompleted install of playonlinux via apt-get.  I had not figured how to accept the MS ttf EULA in the terminal.  which for info is done by using tab to select  then hit space to excecute.\n", "Q: How can I add a custom item to the nautilus context menu, but NOT in a sub-menu? I am interested in adding a custom script to the Nautilus context menu.  I am aware of solutions such as the Scripts folder and the Nautilus Actions application.\nI created a test action in Nautilus Actions, but it only appears under the \"Nautilus-Actions actions\" submenu.\n\nI would like to be able to add an item to the root level of the context menu itself (at the same level as cut, copy, dropbox, compress...) and not in a submenu.\nIs this possible with Nautilus Actions? \nIf it isn't, is there any other way? (If it involves coding or strange configuration changes, that's OK too)  \n\nA: As far as I know that's not possible with Nautilus Actions. But you can write a Nautilus extension  that adds a menu item. For Python install the package python-nautilus and have a look at the examples in /usr/share/doc/python-nautilus/examples/\n\nA: You can do it with nautilus-actions. Launch nautilus-actions-config-tool and go to Edit > Preferences > uncheck \"Create a root Nautilus Actions menu\"  and bottom of the first tab. -- This affects all actions.\n\nAlso, in the left panel the entries (actions) can be grouped as sub-menus. Create your actions (New action'), then create a  'New menu' with right-click or under 'File' for each action category, and then drag&drop your actions of that category on it.\n\nWhich gives this:\n\n", "Q: Launch a program when X starts I want to launch a program when X (not unity/gnome/etc) starts.\nIn particular, I want to launch xset r 105 when lightdm starts.

Just set it to your script. Turn that xset command into an executable shell script and stick it into /usr/bin. Then the config file will be:\ndisplay-setup-script=/usr/bin/xset_script.sh\n\n", "Q: How to install on a laptop w/o internet access?

I have downloaded the file to my current desktop but how do I make a bootable USB if I do not have Ubuntu on my pc?  Do I need to make bootable DVD for this application?\n\nA: You don't need to have Ubuntu on your PC. Download unetbootin, and make a bootable media from the downloaded ISO file.

Here's the procedure:\n1) Open \"Disk Utility\", and look for your device, and click on it.  This will let you be sure you know the correct filesystem type and device name for it.

For example,\nmail user2 [enter] then enter message and send produces a from address of user1@host.domain.com\nI want the from address to be just user1@domain.com.  I did not have this problem in 12.04, it only started when I upgraded to 12.10.  Is there a system config file somewhere that would allow me to only set the domain.com as being added to the username when sending mail and not the full host name?\nThanks,\nTim\n\nA: To use a local domain other than the hostname in Mailutils:\nCreate a file /etc/mailutils.conf with the following contents:\naddress {\n  email-domain somedomain.com;\n};\n\nYou can see what else can be configured in mailutils.conf with:\n$ mail --config-help\n\nFor more configuration possibilities for the mail command using the .mailrc file, refer to the GNU Mailutils Manual. One useful setting is set xmailer=false to stop disclosing the Mailutils version in the X-Mailer header.\n\nNote: /etc/mailutils.conf influences only the mail command. It has no effect on submitting email via sendmail, SMTP to localhost:25, etc. - for those use your MTA's \"qualify domain\" feature (e.g. /etc/mailname, or qualify_domain = somedomain.com in exim4.conf).\n\nA: Frustratingly there is no easy generic mailutils configuration file way to do what you are asking (have the mail program from mailutils use a different default domain through said configuration file).\nFWIW I've found that mailutils mail crafts addresses that look like user@host when sending a mail to just 'user' before the mail is given to the MTA. Thus how the FQDN is actually created was down to the MTA configuration (e.g. you can configure some MTAs to always append the contents of /etc/mailname thus creating other problems). That might explain why other answers on this question linked to the other answers explaining how to make to force headers when using mail (e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/a/380573/4513656 ).\n\nA: You can do this by changing the hostname, or using the -F option of the mail command.\nSee also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54725/change-the-from-address-in-unix-mail\n", "Q: postgreSQL installation from graphical installed I tried to install postgreSQL on ubuntu 12.04 64-bit.

Specially 12.10, as they dropped Unity 2D and replaced it with an \"alternative\" version which uses llvmpipe instead of OpenGL.\nSo probably your system isn't capable to virtualize Ubuntu 12.10. Try virtualizing 12.04, which still has Unity 2D, or some alternative versions like Xubuntu, which uses the XFCE desktop environment, or Lubuntu, which uses LXDE.

If you are a fan of aptitude then you can use aptitude to show the information in a more human friendly way:\nfor pack in $packages ; do aptitude show $pack; done\nIf you are happy with the output you can further output this into a file:\nfor pack in $packages ; do aptitude show $pack >> packages.txt; done\nA copy/paste version of all of this would be:\nAPTITUDE Version\npackages=$(dpkg --get-selections '*' | grep 'install' | cut -f1)\nfor pack in $packages ; do aptitude show $pack; done\nAPT-GET Version\npackages=$(dpkg --get-selections '*' | grep 'install' | cut -f1)\nfor pack in $packages ; do apt-cache showpkg $pack; done\nIf you do all packages, it will take some time for them to be included in the file as output.\n", "Q: Displaying system information on Gnome 3 desktop I am looking for some extension which will display all system information such as CPU usage, temperature, Internet usage, running processes etc.\nI would like to see all of the output continuously updated on my desktop.

However, the cube reflection and deformation plugins are also gone.\nI am running a fresh 12.10 install, and I have every compiz plugin package installed (including compiz-plugins-extra, which supposedly contains everything that compiz-fusion-plugins-extra package used to have), but those two plugins are still missing. I haven't been able to find anyone with the same problem. \nAny ideas? (thanks!)\n\nA: If I am allowed, I would like to cover certain doubts and questions in regards to Compiz. I will first start with the original question and add 2 more related sujects in regards to compiz\nCompiz Plugins Missing / Theme Decorators\nAs seen in the following Bug Report and launchpad links HERE and HERE they are part of a much larger group of Addons that still have performance, stability or compatibility issues.\nThey were removed to assure the end user, that Compiz would have less chance of crashing the system or creating stability issues in general. Although some of them were later implemented, they need proper testing to ensure that when they get added again, they will work correctly. Some might not get added back again, some will do. Others still need more work to let them use less CPU/Memory or create Crashes. The latter is the one that is getting more work since it affects Unity directly.\nYou can see how everything is coming along here: https://launchpad.net/compiz\nAnd if you look here: https://launchpad.net/compiz/+milestone/0.9.9.0\nyou can see there are more important things to fix before adding new material/plugins again to the code. For example, the most noticeable of all is performance issues which, in past versions took a big chunk of the frames your video card had (And affected Unity's performance at the end).\nCompiz Performance\nIn the past (Ubuntu 11.04 & 11.10), the performance of Compiz (And Unity as a derivative of it) had a performance impact when using low to mid range Video Cards. Even high grade cards felt the impact. With version 12.04, the performance impact was lowered for most users and it was much better than previous versions. This performance was better improved when the 12.10 came, bringing with it a more updated video drivers (Nvidia and Intel specially). More users reported better performance in general. With the 310.xx series of Nvidia for example, users could feel the huge benefit from video performance. \nIn fact, I did a check with 5 computers, comparing the 306.xx series with the latest 310.xx series and the results were truly 50% better. I actually did not trust the 50% but using Unity with Wine games, OpenGL games or doing a glx or any kind of benchmark (Before and after using the 310.xx series) I could see a general performance boost. The computers I tested were:\n\n\n*\n\n*Nvidia Geforce 8600 GT + Intel Core 2 Duo 7200 + 2GB  \n\n*Nvidia Geforce 9500 + Intel Core 2 Duo 8500 + 4GB  \n\n*Nvidia Geforce 440  + Intel Core 2 Quad Q9500 + 4GB  \n\n*Nvidia Geforce 550 GTX TI + Intel Core i7 2600 + 16GB  \n\n*Nvidia Geforce 560 GTX TI + Intel Core i7 2600 + 16GB  \n\n\nThe latest version of Nvidia has an specific improvement for Unity  in the last part were it mentions:   \nImproved performance and responsiveness of windowed OpenGL applications running inside a Unity session\nNvidia is not the only one working to improve the performance in Ubuntu while using Compiz/Unity. Intel with it's latest drivers also improved for users using Sandy Bridge or Ivy Bridge video technology. (The 3000/4000 series). Apart from this, AMD/Ati is not far behind with much work on the latest proprietary drivers. So basically with the help from several companies in the gaming and hardware world, Unity/Compiz is becoming a much better desktop with performance and stability in mind.\nCompiz Performance with OpenGL Apps (Games, 2D, 3D)\nShould be mentioned that as part of an ongoing work to improve OpenGL performance, specially with the help from Nvidia, intel and Valve, there has been a lot of work on Compiz and Unity about this. Posts like THIS mention improvements with Compiz of 18%. Between this and the enhancements with Ati, Intel and Nvidia (Nvidia and Intel with performance boosts) you can be sure that performance and stability are #1 with the Compiz project. \nAlthough Plugins come second, they are still worked on if you follow the changelog for Compiz. Apart from this, many performance issues are been worked on for Ubuntu 13.04 (But also for 12.10 and previous active versions) that will come from several parts, including the Linux Kernel 3.8, the Nvidia Drivers, the Intel Stack, the new Ati Drivers, the work done by the Ubuntu Developers in Unity and Compiz and the Testing done by it's users.\nCompiz Development Slowed\nAs some have read, Sam Spilsbury, one of the main Compiz developers left Canonical in pursuit of his university studies (Good decision), but this does not mean Compiz is dead, dying, slowed or other wise. As a matter of fact, Compiz right now has a little over 100+ members related to the Compiz team, of which, 13 are direct ones which are still active and working on either Compiz 0.9.9, Compiz 0.9.8.8 or both.\nSo this means that there are more developers right now working in Compiz than there were years ago and activity within the Compiz project is not dead at all, so much so that we can see articles that mention Improved gaming performance.\nNow, with this is mind, there is also work that has started in relation to Wayland and how it might change the landscape of compiz, Unity and Ubuntu over the following years. There is already talk about Unity moving towards Wayland and how this move is supported more and more over time with all the technical issues surrounding the development of X and the impact Compiz has on some video cards and their performance.\nLittle by little Ubuntu will be gaining support for Wayland in each new release towards a final goal of switching completely from X to W(ayland).\nI hope the users that read this understand all the good news. I wrote all of this to help everyone understand some of the facts about Unity, Compiz and the work done in general.\nIf you have any additional information please feel free to comment. If you have found bugs, please report them here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/compiz\nHope to help everyone with trouble with compiz. Remember to check Askubuntu for other related Compiz problems or doubts ( Like How to correctly enable Desktop Cube )\nThank you.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 Manually installing Catalyst 12.11 Beta Hello i have problem with my driver.\nWhat i did, \n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install ia32-libs-multiarch i386 lib32gcc1 ia32-libs libc6-i386 ia32-libs\n$ sudo sh amd-driver-installer-catalyst-12.11-beta-x86.x86_64.zip --buildpkg Ubuntu/quantal\n$ sudo dpkg -i fglrx_9.010-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb\n$ sudo dpkg -i fglrx-dev_9.010-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb\n$ sudo dpkg -i fglrx-amdcccle_9.010-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb \n$ sudo aticonfig --initial\n$ sudo reboot\n\nAfter reboot \n$ fglrxinfo\n\nAnd i get \nX Error of failed request:  BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)\n  Major opcode of failed request:  154 (GLX)\n  Minor opcode of failed request:  3 (X_GLXCreateContext)\n  Serial number of failed request:  17\n  Current serial number in output stream:  18\n\n:_(\nHere are my logs \nmedia.cdn.ubuntu-de.org/forum/attachments/08/45/5006157-Terminal_log.txt\nmedia.cdn.ubuntu-de.org/forum/attachments/08/45/5006157-Xorg.0.log\nmedia.cdn.ubuntu-de.org/forum/attachments/08/45/5006157-Xorg.0.log.old\n\nModule build for the currently running kernel was skipped since the\n  kernel source for this kernel does not seem to be installed.\n\nMy PC \nMainbaord:Z77A-G14\nGPU:AMD/ATI HD5850\nFestplatte:596GB Western Digital\nRAM:18,0 GB Dual-Kanal DDR3\nCPU:Intel Core i7 3770\n\nA: Hi I'm fairly new to both Ubuntu and askubuntu.com.

I purchased an HP laptop with the Qualcomm Atheros AR9565 (QCWB335) wireless adapter. I understand that this adapter is currently not supported on Ubuntu 12.04 and there is no way to get wireless access.\nI installed compat-wireless-3.6.6-1 ath9k driver and it didn't work, lshw -C network still showed *-network UNCLAIMED after reset.\nHow can I figure out when Ubuntu will have driver for AR9565? Is there a workaround to get wireless working somehow?\n\nA: Your device is covered in this package: http://www.orbit-lab.org/kernel/compat-wireless-3-stable/v3.6/compat-wireless-3.6.6-1-snpc.tar.bz2\nThe files with extra letters, in this case snpc, are pre-patched to add newer devices and, sometimes, features. Yours is a good example.\n\nA: Here's one way to solve this. I myself had the same problem as mentioned here. I followed two posts on ubuntuforum by anoop-n2 and chili555, and kind of did a mix of things, which can be outlined as follows:\nYou need to have linux-headers-generic and build-essential installed, try\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic build-essential\n\nwhich will turn out to be of the newest version if those are already there.\nThe following should be done in a terminal as root:\nsudo -i\nwget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/stable/v3.9-rc4/compat-drivers-3.9-rc4-2-s.tar.bz2\ntar xvf compat-drivers-3.9-rc4-2-s.tar.bz2\ncd compat-drivers-3.9-rc4-2-s/\n./scripts/driver-select ath9k\nmake\n\nNow this will probably give the following error:\nerror: redefinition of ‘kref_get_unless_zero’\ninclude/linux/kref.h:47:32: note: previous definition of ‘kref_get_unless_zero’ was here\n\nIn this case, open the header file, and find the entire block of the function:\nstatic inline int __must_check kref_get_unless_zero(struct kref *kref)\n{\n    return atomic_add_unless(&kref->refcount, 1, 0);\n}\n\nNext comment out the entire block of the function using line comment (put // in front of each line) or block comment in c as,\n/*static inline int __must_check kref_get_unless_zero(struct kref *kref)\n{\n    return atomic_add_unless(&kref->refcount, 1, 0);\n}*/\n\nthen type the following commands one by one:\nmake\nmake install\n\nThen load the driver using\nmodprobe ath9k\n\nor reboot the system. Afterwards the wifi should be working.\n\nA: The compat-wireless package will probably require adding your pci.id to the pci.c file as well as some other changes, similar to this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=12201881&postcount=35\nDid you do that?

One of the people suggested Mint and it came up working on the first install, not just wifi, but all the communication stuff.  Maybe time to switch distro's!\nI did resolve my problems with a backport and now that it's installed I have no problems with the AR9565 set.  Might look at available backports to see if there is a hint about support there.\nIt is cheap to download and burn a DVD with Mint live on it to just boot and see if it's supported, instead of banging your head.  I'm confident that it will support yours, because it supports mine! Also, anyone you speak with will understand that the chip-set is supported somewhere in the Linux world and not spend half of your time debating if it's supported or not.  Plus it's nice warm willies to have it come up and work after all the work you put into it!\n", "Q: How to install the locate command?

It lets you duplicate a hard drive to another, completely zero a hard drive, etc. But once you launch a dd command, there's nothing to tell you of its progress. It just sits there at the cursor until the command finally finishes. So how does one monitor dd's progress?\n\nA: Update 2016: If you use GNU coreutils >= 8.24 (default in Ubuntu Xenial 16.04 upwards), see method 2 below for an alternate way to display the progress.\n\nMethod 1: By using pv\nInstall pv and put it between input / output only dd commands.\nNote: you cannot use it when you already started dd.\nFrom the package description:\n\npv - Pipe Viewer - is a terminal-based tool for monitoring the\n  progress of data through a pipeline. It can be inserted into any\n  normal pipeline between two processes to give a visual indication of\n  how quickly data is passing through, how long it has taken, how near\n  to completion it is, and an estimate of how long it will be until\n  completion.\n\nInstallation\nsudo apt-get install pv\n\nExample\ndd if=/dev/urandom | pv | dd of=/dev/null\n\nOutput\n1,74MB 0:00:09 [ 198kB/s] [      <=>                               ]\n\nYou could specify the approximate size with the --size if you want a time estimation.\n\nExample Assuming a 2GB disk being copied from /dev/sdb\nCommand without pv would be:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=DriveCopy1.dd bs=4096\n\nCommand with pv:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdb | pv -s 2G | dd of=DriveCopy1.dd bs=4096\n\nOutput:\n440MB 0:00:38 [11.6MB/s] [======>                             ] 21% ETA 0:02:19\n\n\nOther uses\nYou can of course use pv directly to pipe the output to stdout:\npv /home/user/bigfile.iso | md5sum\n\nOutput\n50,2MB 0:00:06 [8,66MB/s] [=======>         ] 49% ETA 0:00:06\n\nNote that in this case, pv recognizes the size automatically.\n\nMethod 2: New status option added to dd (GNU Coreutils 8.24+)\ndd in GNU Coreutils 8.24+ (Ubuntu 16.04 and newer) got a new status option to display the progress:\nExample\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/null status=progress\n\nOutput\n462858752 bytes (463 MB, 441 MiB) copied, 38 s, 12,2 MB/s\n\n\nA: Easiest is:\n dd if=... of=... bs=4M status=progress oflag=dsync\n\noflag=dsync will keep your writing in sync, so information of status=progress is more accurate. However it might be a bit slower.\n\nA: Use option status=progress to get the progress during the transfert.\nIn addition, conv=fsync will display I/O errors.\nExample:\nsudo dd if=mydistrib.iso of=/dev/sdb status=progress conv=fsync\n\n\nA: For the sake of completeness: \nVersion 8.24 of the GNU coreutils includes a patch for dd introducing a parameter to print the progress.\nThe commit introducing this change has the comment:\n\ndd: new status=progress level to print stats periodically\n\nMany distributions, including Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS use this version.\n\nA: Use Ctrl+Shift+T while dd is running, and it will output the progress (in bytes):\nload: 1.51  cmd: dd 31215 uninterruptible 0.28u 3.67s\n321121+0 records in\n321120+0 records out\n164413440 bytes transferred in 112.708791 secs (1458745 bytes/sec)\n\n\nA: This one forces dd to provide stats every 2 seconds which is default for watch:\nwatch killall -USR1 dd\n\nTo change from every 2 seconds to every 5 seconds, add -n 5 option like this:\nwatch -n 5 killall -USR1 dd\n\n\nA: From HowTo: Monitor the progress of dd\nYou can monitor the progress of dd once it's running without halting it by using the kill command to send a signal to the process.\nAfter you start dd, open another terminal and enter either:\nsudo kill -USR1 $(pgrep ^dd$)\n\nOr, if you're on BSD or OS X:\nsudo kill -INFO $(pgrep ^dd$)\n\nThis will display the progress in the dd terminal window without halting the process (by printing to its stderr stream).

With this pipeline, at least, pv has no idea how big the input file is so it won't be able to tell you how far along you are so there's no disadvantage to doing it as follows- and you get a nice speed advantage:\nI would avoid pv on anything large, and (if using Bash):\nControl-Z the dd process\nbg to put it in background. Observe that bg will give you output like [1] 6011 where the latter number is a process id. So, do:\nwhile true; do kill -USR1 process_id ; sleep 5; done\nwhere process_id is the process id you observed. Hit Control-C when you see something like:\n[1]+  Done dd if=/path/file.qcow2 of=/dev/kvm/pxetest bs=4194304 conv=sparse\n-bash: kill: (60111) - No such process\n\nYou are done.\nEdit: Silly Systems Administrator! Automate your life, don't work! If I have a long dd process that I want to monitor, here's a one-liner that will take care of the whole enchilada for you; put this all on one line:\n dd if=/path/to/bigimage of=/path/to/newimage conv=sparse bs=262144 & bgid=$!; while true; do sleep 1; kill -USR1 $bgid || break; sleep 4; done\n\nYou can, of course, script it, perhaps make $1 your input file and $2 your output file. This is left as an exercise for the reader. Note that you need that little sleep before the kill or the kill may die trying to send a signal to dd when it's not ready yet. Adjust your sleeps as desired (maybe even remove the second sleep altogether).\nBash- FTW!  :-)\n\nA: http://linuxcommando.blogspot.com/2008/06/show-progress-during-dd-copy.html\nBasically:\nkill -USR1 < dd pid >\n\n\nA: A few handy sample usages with pv and less typing or more progress then other answers:\nFirst you will need to install pv, with the command:\nsudo apt-get install pv\n\nThen some examples are:\npv -n /dev/urandom | dd of=/dev/null\npv -tpreb source.iso | dd of=/dev/BLABLA bs=4096 conv=notrunc,noerror\n\nNote: the first sample is 5 characters less typing then dd if=/dev/urandom | pv | dd of=/dev/null. \nAnd my favorite for cloning a disk drive (replace X with drive letters):\n(pv -n /dev/sdX | dd of=/dev/sdX bs=128M conv=notrunc,noerror) 2>&1 | dialog --gauge \"Running dd command (cloning), please wait...\" 10 70 0\n\n\nsource: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-dd-command-show-progress-while-coping/\nAlso for archiving myself.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 16.04\nUbuntu 16.04 comes with dd (coreutils) Version 8.25 .

It also has some fixes for incorrectly cached downloads.\nNow vs updating and then re-installing, you can get essentially the same results by upgrading.  However, a simple upgrade won't do, you'll need to run (on the device):\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && sudo apt-get install linux-image-nexus7\nThe reason for the additional package install is that there was a change in the kernel meta-package structure.

The subset changes daily (different projects, different versions of libraries). What takes longer when I use it seem to be disk seeks.\nFor example if I do a du twice the second time it takes as much time as the first, and disk activity is similar.\nIdeally I'd like to tell the kernel to allocate X Mb to the metadata and Y to data in the folder, like the options for nfs cache.\nIs it possible in some way, other than mounting nfs from localhost and caching it to a ramdisk?\n\nA: I think that is a question that has no positive answer. Linux does not provide any mechanism to specify how much metadata and data to cache on a per directory basis for file systems like ext2,ext3,ext4,xfs etc.\n\nA: I believe what you want is to do a full readahead() and/or posix_fadvise() on the data you know will be needed on the next day.\nIf you don't know or the resulting data is too large to be cached, then you already know the answer.

If I'm not mistaken, SAMBA is designed for local/secure-ish networks, whereas alternatives, such as sshfs, scp, sftp, may be a better solution for you.\nEnsure SAMBA lockdown\nBefore allowing SAMBA to be accessed remotely (over the Internet), make sure you set it up in such a way that you can control access to your files. How-To\nRouting\nIn order for remote computers (those outside of your LAN) to access your SAMBA machine(s), you will need to set up port forwarding such that the TCP ports 135, 139, 445 as well as the UDP ports 135-139 are forwarded to your SAMBA machine.

The maximum disk size for an MBR partitioned disk is indeed 2.2TB.  You need the to have GUID partition table to exceed this limit.  Here's a wikipedia page.\nThe error message you got seems to suggest using Gparted to format this drive, so the implication is that Gparted understands GUID partition tables and can write them.\nYou will still appear to lose some of the capacity as the drive manufacturers say '3TB' when what they actually mean is 3,000,000,000 bytes, which is actually about 2.7 real TB.  As stated you will also appear to 'lose' about 5% for filesystem tables and allocations for an ext4 partition.  Actually, the 5% is based on 512bytes/sector and I don't think that will apply in this case.  The final figure may be a bit different.

I moved from windows to Ubuntu and I'm trying to understand if all the prgrams in Ubuntu are portable?\nIn Windows, you can use a regular program which spread it's files all over the FS, writes to the registry and has an entry in the add/remove menu, or you can use a portable program which store all it's data and files in one folder.\nso,for example, it I want to have two different versions of Eclipse, that wasn't a problem in Windows because Eclipse is a portable application, but in Ubuntu I got Eclipse by apt-get, and in it there is only one version I can manage. So how can I do it? \n\nA: If an application is portable or not depends on the way it was packed or distributed. Normally, you can install different version of applications via apt-get (ubuntu repos) and they'll co-exists, if they can't, you will be notified when installing the second one that you must remove the first in order to install the second. Packets installed via apt-get normally store their binaries in /usr/bin and their configuration files on hidden folders (folders starting with a dot) on your home directory, you can see them by pressing ctrl-h in the file manager while in your home dir.\nIf we go to the specific case of eclipse, you can do it as you do in windows, you can always download eclipse from their site (NOT from ubuntu repos) and keep it in a folder and it will store all of its config and data inside that folder.\ncheck out the download page of eclipse (for linux)\nhttp://www.eclipse.org/downloads/\nIt will download a compressed folder which you decompress and can directly execute the binary file inside the folder.\n\nA: İf you download tar.gz packages of program , this is portable. \n\n\n*\n\n*download tar.gz\n\n*excract tar.gz\n\n*find program file ( etc. android)\n\n*and open it .\n\n", "Q: ksoftirqd uses 100% cpu I am running 32bit Ubuntu 10.04.

You should have one ksoftirq for each CPU.\nThe soft interrupts are normally serviced on return from a hard interrupt.  It is possible that the soft interrupts can be triggered faster than they can be serviced.  If a soft interrupt is triggered again while the soft interrupt is being handled then the ksoftirq daemon handles the soft interrupts in a kernel thread.  If this happens a lot you will see a heavy soft interrupt load on the ksoftirqd threads.\n100% CPU utilisation in a ksoftirqds and the need to reboot sounds like some hardware is saturating the machine with an interrupt storm.

I downloaded ubuntu 12.10 iso from http://www.ubuntu.com/ then I burned it to a dvd.  I tried to install it and everything goes fine until I reach the option install ubuntu alongside windows 7 then on clicking continue the DVD ejects itself and \"please remove the installation source from the tray\" appears on the screen, and again windows starts and the installation remains incomplete.\nI then created a bootable USB and tried to install but again on the same option installation stops.  I'm not an advanced user so the \"try something else option\" looks too complicated. I tried to use it but I dont know how to use this option.  How can I install ubuntu? Is it that windows 7 is not allowing me to install ubuntu or is the problem something else?\n\nA: It's been so long since I've duel booted Windows, but I do believe that current Ubuntu distros can be installed from with in Windows via wubi. This page may help:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/install-ubuntu-with-windows\nStart up Windows and pop in the ubuntu dvd, or the usb to make things a lot faster. Wubi may autorun if you're using the liveCD, and if you're using the usb just open it up and click on the wubi icon. \nFYI, installing Ubuntu then Windows usually messes up the boot loader (grub) and will only boot Windows.\n\nA: I guess you'll have to use the \"something else\" option BUT be careful: you may loose everything on your disk.\nSo, here's a step by step way of installing Ubuntu alongside Windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup everything important on your disk. Hopefully unnecessarily but better safe than sorry.\n\n*Boot windows and start the partition tool. Reduce the size of the Windows partition to create space for Ubuntu. 50Gb is recommended, minimum is 4Gb but in my option it is very limiting. You may need to create an extended partition if you already have 3 primary partitions and then create logical partitions, because you can only have a maximum of 4 primary partitions.\n\n*Boot from your liveDVD or live USB and choose the something else option.\n\n*When you arrive at the partitioning stage, create two partitions in the empty space. One large partition type ext4, mount point / and one 3 or 4 Gb \"swap\" partition. Swap is virtual memory. Not strictly necessary but recommended.\n\n*When you arrive at the bootloader stage, make sure you could the right disc. On Windows drives are labelled C,D,E etc. On Linux it is sda, sdb for the drive and sda1, sda2 etc for the partitions of the respective drives. Make sure you choose the right disc. If your Ubuntu is on sda3, then install the bootloader (Grub) on sda.\n\n*Finish installation and reboot.\n\n\nA: Its not that windows is not allowing you, try use Linux Live usb creator to create image on the usb and install ubuntu in a separate drive that is not containg windows.Use ext4 partition for intalling ubuntu.\n\nA: Sounds like you have to use the option \"something else\" and manually create partitions, and select the option to put the boot loader on C drive (which in Linux is sda...note: not sda1 or sda2, just put it under sda).\nThere are good guides available if you google for dual-boot.\n", "Q: Do I need to make a separate partition when installing via Wubi? I am using Wubi. Do I need to make a separate partition for Ubuntu? The last time I tried this, it made a folder called root on my drive and I could not access any files on that drive within Ubuntu.\n\nA: No, if you are using Wubi (the Windows installer) to install Ubuntu in Windows, you don't need to do any repartitioning. Partitioning your drive is only required if you plan on installing Ubuntu alongside Windows via the LiveCD/USB method. Wubi installs Ubuntu in such a way that it is more like a Windows program instead of a standalone OS with its own space.\nIf you need to access your Windows files in Ubuntu if you installed it using Wubi, see Accessing Windows partition inside Wubi.\nFor more information on Wubi in general, see here.\n\nA: I believe you can access it. However, I'd recommend installing it on a small partition of about 20GB.\nIt will be relatively hassle free (unless you like tinkering with the system).\n\nA: you should do it in windows . if you will do it in linux , maybe can be a problem.

I want them to use software RAID 1 mirroring, so I was following this document religiously step by step:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/advanced-installation.html\nTo summarize the above official documentation:\n\nto set up a software RAID 1 mirror in Ubuntu Server, you choose manual partitioning during the setup, and do this on each drive:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*\"swap\" partition of roughly RAM size\n  \n*\"physical volume for RAID\" partition for remaining drive size\n  \n  \n  After that, you set up the RAID 1 mirror using the RAID partitions on drive A and B, make it ext4 and containing the root filesystem partition.\nSetup continues from there just fine.\n\nOne caveat: I was completely unable to select the \"physical volume for RAID\" as bootable.

Is there some way for me to make the physical volumes for RAID bootable after the fact, perhaps from a live CD or something?\n\nA: While Jeff provided a solution that fixes the symptom, the underlying reason is a missing partition of type \"biosgrub\".  The process described by Jeff creates one such partition (only 1MB in size).\nIt is advisable to create such a partition on both drives, if you would like to boot even if one drive failed.\n\nA: Well, I was able to proceed by deviating from the official install docs slightly.\nRather than manually configuring the free space on the two drives, I selected \"automatically partition the free space\" on each drive.\nNote that this caused automatic creation of a 32 GB (equal to RAM size) swap partition, and one large ext4 partition.

Any suggestions?\n\nA: This instance of the problem might be caused by a bug; I recommend considering reporting this as a bug in PolicyKit.\nHowever, this problem can occur with or without a bug, for example, as a consequence of manual PolicyKit configuration changes (or deinstallation). Therefore, it merits an answer here.\nThis is happening because the PolicyKit service is not running. Here's a couple ways to fix this:\nMake sure the necessary PolicyKit packages are installed.\nOpen a Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install policykit-1 policykit-1-gnome\n\nThen reboot and see if the problem is fixed. (Logging out and back in might fix the problem too.)\nRun the Software Center with gksu/gksudo instead of PolicyKit.\nIf that doesn't work, you can still run the Software Center by working around the problem. PolicyKit is one way an authorized user (typically an administrator) can perform actions as root in a typically configured Ubuntu system, but it is not the only way. sudo is the other.\nFor graphical programs, running them with sudo directly often will work (as in Thomas's answer). But it is not recommended, primarily because it can cause the non-root user's configuration files to become owned by root.\n\n*\n\n*For graphical programs that don't store configuration files in a user's home directory, this doesn't matter. But most do, and the Software Center is no exception. (It uses ~/.config/software-center, where ~ is your home directory.)\n\nSo it's recommended to use a non-graphical frontend instead: gksu/gksudo, or (if you're running Kubuntu) kdesudo.\nSo, press Alt+F2 and run:\ngksu software-center\n\n\n(This works in all desktop environments, not just Unity, though of course it looks different in others.)\nThen you'll be prompted for your password. Enter it, and the Software Center will run as root.\nPlease note that this is a little different from the way Software Center usually runs. Ordinarily, it runs as a normal user, and uses PolicyKit to perform actions as root just when it is needed. It would be non-trivial to get it to use gksu/gksudo or kdesudo to do that.\nBut running it as root typically works fine and causes no problems.\nOther graphical utilities can be run as root with graphical sudo frontends, too.\nThe problem itself doesn't appear related specifically to the Software Center--any program that uses PolicyKit will fail.

Yes, I know that this question has been asked many times before, but none of the answers really helped.\nI'd like to package the Minecraft launcher (which has no proprietary code, AFAIK,) into a .deb file so that I can put it on a flash drive and share it with my friends. I have managed to install Minecraft it manually (put some files into /opt/minecraft, download an icon, and create a .desktop file in /usr/share/applications,) and I have made a shell script that completely automates the process, but it relies on wget to retrieve a few files, including the .desktop file. (It isn't a self-extracting archive, after all.)\nI'd like to be able to do this offline, as a lot of my friends have slow or no internet. (One of their internet lines was buried so shallowly that it actually got knocked out by the lawnmower.)\nI won't be loading it into a PPA or anything like that; I just want it to be a \"formal\" package that can be easily installed and uninstalled. (One thing that I would like is for sudo apt-get purge minecraft to also remove the .minecraft folder. It would also be nice to define the dependedcies as being able to accept OpenJDK or Sun's JVM.)\nOh, just so you know, the Minecraft launcher is a .jar file, but I can very, very easily launch it via shell scripts.

I'm sure there are a lot of people out there\nthat have written little useful scripts and would like to package and share them\nbut its just to time consuming & frustrating when trying to create a .deb for\nthe first time.\n\nA: http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/ is a good start. It'll also tell you that packages should never touch /home :)\n\nA: As far as I know, it's actually not really proper to redistribute the launcher either, but I'm not sure of the specifics.\nI can recommend having a look at minecraft-installer by Graham Edgecombe, which is a debian package which automatically downloads and sets up the launcher with icons and shortcuts. So downloading the launcher happens when you are installing the package, (the package doesn't actually contain any part of minecraft, only scripts to get it and set it up).\nI have a slight bias since a made a few contributions to the project ;)\n\nA: When you've built your application using Apache's Maven (best thing to do btw), you can use the pkg:pkg plugin from Tarent.  You can find this open source package here: https://evolvis.org/projects/mvn-pkg-plugin.\nA tutorial is available.

(in this matlab version there's not the command memory which maybe could help me).\nEDIT\nSolution: \nThere was a variable that was too large, saving the results differently prevented the out of memory error.\n\nA: I am not an avid MATLAB user, but may I suggest you to try: \nFile > Preferences > General > Java Heap Memory. \n\nThen you can increase the amount of memory beyond the default value of 196 MB. Hope this helps.\n\nA: Memory management is a long standing problem for Matlab. The most likely cause of your out of memory error is that there is a memory leak. Memory leaks can be found, but finding them is technically challenging and time consuming.\nTo completely free up the memory, Matlab needs to be restarted. If there is a way to save the results after processing some of the data, save the data and restart Matlab. Reload the data and process another another chuck of data. Repeat until all the data is processed. The amount of data to process should be less than 20 years.\nThis is far from elegant and depends on being able to save and reload the data. Also, I assume that the size of the data itself is not the problem.\n\nA: Try this, it works well for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Home -> Preference icon -> General -> Java Heap Memory -> Allocate what size of memory you want\n\n*In Preference window, go to \"Workspace\" (out of Java heap memory level) -> See \"Matlab Array size limit\"\nMake sure uncheck the 'Limit the maximum array size to a percentage of RAM'.

Maybe this helps you although in my case the fix only worked once.\nOnce you have access to a terminal, you might want to remove the nouveau driver and/or blacklist it and then install the proprietary nvidia driver by\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nor use this link:\n\nI hope this helps\n\nA: i had the exact same problem with the 12.04 and 12.10 desktop and an nvidia card.  i was not able to get past the login screen without it hard-freezing the whole machine.  this appears to be a widespread problem with ubuntu 12 desktop installations and nvidia cards.\nfwiw, i was able to get up and running by installing the ubuntu 12.10 server edition that comes with no drivers or desktop (you don't have to install any of the actual server components like lamp or tomcat).  then, with the luxury of a working console:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\nsudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop\n\n...after installation, launch the desktop with\nstartx\n\n...and tada, you've got a beautiful new desktop.  the last hurdle was that after rebooting, i was stuck in 640x480 resolution.  there are a number of different suggestions to fix this if you search around - they all have to do with editing the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file.  the one that i tried, which worked, was to change the HorizSync and VertRefresh values as suggested here:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1659556\n...and that's all i had to do to get a stable, hi-res ubuntu 12.10 desktop working with an nvidia card.  \nfrom reading around, it sounds like the problem may have been due to bad interaction between the nouveau video driver that comes with the desktop version by default, and the unity desktop that also is the desktop default.  i can't offer any useful debugging info, all i know is that by completely avoiding the default drivers and the unity desktop i was able to get up and running with no problem.\nhope this helps.\n\nA: given that the problem arises as soon as you try to boot from the DVD it seems the problem is the DVD is faulty maybe it's not properly burned, sometimes it happens specially on faster burn speeds.

I need to simulate the behavior of the keyboard shortcut (ALT+F4) using Terminal for a given application.\nIf I open for example gedit and click ALT + F4 , then GEDIT will be xkilled.\nIf I want to achieve same thing using Terminal, how should I proceed?\nThe following command (in order to kill gedit process) works fine:\nkill $eval `pidof gedit`\n\nyet, the command\nxkill -id gedit\n\nprompts me to click on the application client window in order to xkill it, thing That I want to avoid from the beginning.\nThe reason why I want to achieve this behavior is that some applications clients keep their process running, even though you ALT+F4 it.\nMy need is that I have an application that starts up on every login and I need to automatically close its client 3 or 5 seconds after it shows up.\n\nA: An equivalent of xkill is the windowkill function in xdotool. If you don't have xdotool installed, please run \nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\nWith this tool you can indeed kill a window by using the search option and by specifying its class:\nxdotool search --class gedit windowkill\n\nYou can find the pid of the process with getwindowpid, but just specifying the name of the class of window (i.e --class gedit) is enough. The tool is non-interactive in the sense that you do not need to click on a window to kill it as you sometimes need to do with xkill.\nMore information on the options available with xdotool are available with man xdotool and at the Ubuntu manpages online. The manpages explain well how xdotool can be incorporated into a script much easier than xkill could be. \nSo I think probably xdotool's windowkill option is what you want and it may be more handy than that of xkill. \nHowever, if you still want to use xkill and feed it the window's resource id, so that it closes the window without prompting you, you could parse the output of xwininfo, as in this example using the program Meld:\nxkill -id $(xwininfo -name Meld | awk -F ':*\"*' '{print $3}')\n\nHowever, the name of the program sent to xwininfo must be in the proper case, so launch the program beforehand, and, in our example here, see if it is Meld or meld. \nI prefer the xdotool command I gave above, as the case doesn't have to be correct: Meld or meld will work as the search --name switch instead uses regex to match a given string and ignores the case.\n\nA: you can use killall which will send a TERMSIG (terminate signal) to the application you specify. you can use killall with the following command \nkillall <id> \n\nfor example, you can close firefox with \nkilall firefox\n\nif for some reason you must find the correct id of an application/process, you can always use  ps  to see all running processes and their names.\n\nA: kill -9 <id>\n\nwill definitely kill everything associated with that pid.\nto find the pid, I use\nps -u $USER -f | grep gedit\n\nthey can then be incorporated into one command if you need to do it often\n\nA: Use top Command to get  particular process Id. Note down it and type following command to kill Process.\nkill <process id>\n\n", "Q: System doesn't show option to select operating system during startup! i am new at linux and ubuntu,\ntoday i installed ubuntu 12.04 but during installation some problem happened, i don't remember what was that exactly (but can tell you that it was related to boot), so i reinstalled ubuntu (using usb stick both time) and ubuntu installation finished successfully,\nNow problem is that when I start my computer then system is directly selecting ubuntu as my operating system, i have installed it along with windows 7 in option during installation, so it should give me option to select which operating system i want to use.

You will want to check the difference between load and cpu usage (eg. using top). Chances are that CPU usage is very low, while CPU load is high. This is caused by the what cpu load indicates and is most of the time completely harmless.\nFrom the uptimeman page:\n   System  load  averages is the average number of processes that are either in a runnable or uninterrupt‐\n   able state.  A process in a runnable state is either using the CPU  or  waiting  to  use  the  CPU.   A\n   process in uninterruptable state is waiting for some I/O access, eg waiting for disk.  The averages are\n   taken over the three time intervals.  Load averages are not normalized for the number of CPUs in a sys‐\n   tem, so a load average of 1 means a single CPU system is loaded all the time while on a 4 CPU system it\n   means it was idle 75% of the time.\n\nIn other words it is the average number of processes waiting for being serviced. But because of the fact that all these processes are waiting for data of the disks this number can get large when a lot of disk I/O is being scheduled.\nSolution: Don't worry or buy faster disks (or decent RAID, SAN, ...). \nI personally like dstat for troubleshooting these issues.\n\nA: It is very normal for the load to be high during lots of disk activity what you should check is \"top\" and \"iowait\"\nOr in this case \"0.7%wa\" is the iowait time.  I suspect yours will be high.\nCpu0  : 17.4%us,  3.0%sy,  0.0%ni, 78.9%id,  0.7%wa,  0.0%hi,  0.0%si,  0.0%st\n\nIn your example I am not sure what units those measurements are in but if the wa is % then it is quite high.\nProblem\nI see that your Samsung disk specifically is horribly slow in the benchmarks: http://usb.userbenchmark.com/SpeedTest/4007/SAMSUNG-HD501LJ \nThis poor performance you are seeing is definitely a result that mirrors the benchmarks.  In fact I've never seen a slower 7200 RPM drive!\nSolution:\n1.) Replace your disk with a higher performing model (highly recommend any of the newer Toshiba SATA3 7200 3.5\" models).\nFor example I've found with 2x2TB Toshiba 7200 RPMs in mdadm RAID 10 my IO speed is approximately 389-400MB/s (effectively double the speed of a single drive).\n", "Q: How to change the guest session keyboard layout? I use the Dvorak keyboard layout. When I switch to a guest session it defaults to the Dvorak layout as well. Unfortunately this only produces gibberish for most people typing.\nIs there a way to set the default guest session keyboard layout?\n\nA: Actually as far as I know , You can't do that , You can have 2 user accounts and each one with a different keyboard style , But a Guest doesn't get those settings and a user can't change then , Most likely you can do it in the Terminal with UNIX commands or GRUB but I am not a expert with that , Sorry I can not help that much but the easiest way is making a a Guest User Account on it and limiting the things it can do , Not making it an admin , And putting a password only you can know \n", "Q: Why limit the number of open files and Running processes in Linux? I do not have much knowledge about operating system internal workings, so why do we have limits for maximum number of open files and running processes in Linux?\nI would appreciate it if anyone could help me understand.\n\nA: There are limits to most everything, both in life and in Linux.  Sometimes the limits are very high and not worth worrying about, and sometimes they are too low, set arbitrarily by a lazy programmer, or set by limits to the hardware.\nArbitrary limits come about when a programmer makes a decision such as the maximum number of characters allowed in a field, such as an address.  It's a lot easier to set some arbitrary limit than to dynamically allocate memory as needed.  You don't want to allocate all available memory to a simple input field, but you don't want to allow the input to overwrite other memory that may be important, either.  For open files and processes, there may be an arbitrary limit, or it may be limited by available memory.  If the latter, then bad things will start to happen as you approach the limit, and the system may hang, so it's often good to have a limit that comes into play before that happens.  Sometimes, the arbitrary limits may be determined at startup depending on memory or disk space, and are usually fairly intelligent, but still arbitrary - someone decided where performance would become intolerable or dangerous, and set limits to avoid that situation.\nThen there are limits set by hardware, such as the size of an integer or character.  If you have a 32-bit system, then there are limits set by the maximum size of an integer (4,294,967,295 if unsigned, or half that if signed).\n\nA: For processes, /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max is the maximum pid allowed, so this is the hard limit of the number of processes that can run at any instant. However, limits on memory normally come into play well before that.\nFor the upper limit on open files on the entire machine, /proc/sys/fs/file-max is the hard limit; this is based on the amount of memory in the machine, so it will vary.  The kernel sets this to be:\n    n = (mempages * (PAGE_SIZE / 1024)) / 10;\n    files_stat.max_files = max_t(unsigned long, n, NR_FILE);\n\nwhich works out to be about 100 for each 1 MB of RAM.    \nPer process limits are different. ulimit will define these.\n\nA: This is mainly for historical reasons. On older Linux mainframes, many users would connect and use the mainframe's resources. Of course, itwas necessary to limit, and since such operations like file handles and processes were built into the kernel, it was limited there. It also helps limit attacks like the fork bomb. A defense against the form bomb using process limits is shown here.\nIt also helps keep complex services and daemons in check by not allowing runaway forking and file opening, similar to what the fork bomb tries to do.\nAlso to be noted are things like the amount of RAM and CPU available, and the fact that a 32-bit counter can only reference so much(only 4294967296 entries that can be counted by a 32-bit counter), but such limits are far above those usually set by programmers and system administrators. Anyway, long before you have 4294967296 processes, your machine would have probably been rebooted, either just as planned, or as it began to lock up due to starving another resource. \nUnless you run the Titan with its 584 TiB of memory(you won't, since Linux cannot be run as one instance on a supercomputer), you probably won't reach this process limit anytime soon. Even then, the average process would only have roughly 146KB of memory, assuming no shared memory.\n\nA: We have a limit because computers have limits , I have 4GB of RAM , So I can't run 15 games now can I?\nI most likely can run it with some lag but it wouldn't be human , It is the limit on your PC and Linux's Kernal , You would need a better kernal and alot of RAM to be able to hold any program that is thrown at you.\nLike my laptop when I ran Windows 7 , I could Play Battlefield , But It took 80% of my RAM so if I tried to play \"Need For Speed\" , That takes 60% Ussually , I can open both but then my whole system is slowed down since I am running 2 Heavy Duty Programs , They are both fighting for RAM (Random Access Memory)\nIn short words , A normal computer can't run alot of programs at once\nMusic , Notepad , Browser , Email , Game , You think that is alot on a computer but that is mere , A game like World of Warcraft takes alot more RAM and makes your computer struggle (Unless you have 8-16 GB of RAM like expensive laptops do!)\n", "Q: 12.10 nvidia Geforce gt650m support?

But the Unity desktop was unusable because the Dash and Launcher are not shown.\n\nA: NVidia GForce have limited support on most Operating Systems.\nOne way you can do is Sign in, Sign out, Then use Classic gnome and it will most likely work.\nAnother way is that you can re-install Ubuntu with a LiveCD .iso or on Windows with the Ubuntu Installer called Wubi.exe.\nThere are other ways but I personally do not know them, I hope this can atleast give you a start of what to look for.\n", "Q: Isn't there an installer package for Oracle Database?

And probably will never be: if Oracle licensing for Java doesn't allow it to be hosted in the main repositories, it should be even more restrictive regarding Oracle DB.\nAlso the creation of \"metapackages\" (ie: a package that downloads and install it) should be hard to achieve, since even to download Oracle Express Edition you need to have an Oracle account.\n", "Q: Multi-display issues T61 on 12.04 TLS Installed 12.04 LTS on T61 laptop.

I have an old Asus netbook (an Eee PC 1000) that has been a traveling companion of mine for quite some time.  I installed Ubuntu on it after I bought it back in 2008, and have been updating it with new releases as they've come out.\nMy needs for it have always been light: basically a machine for typing, either into LibreOffice, the terminal, or a browser window. For most of its life the Eee has had plenty of power to handle this. But with recent releases it's started to get pretty slow -- it's not uncommon for my typing to outpace the cursor, and browser windows frequently freeze up and gray out on JavaScript-intensive sites -- so I've become more and more hesitant about making updates to avoid making the problem worse.  Currently it's sitting on Ubuntu 11.10.\nI've been thinking about bringing it up to date with 12.10, but the slowness problem, combined with 12.10 ditching Unity 2D, makes me wonder if it's really suitable for this old piece of kit. The Eee PC 1000 is pretty weak spec-wise -- Atom CPU, 1GB RAM, Intel GMA 950 integrated graphics. So I'm thinking it may just not be up to running modern versions of Ubuntu, since those have become increasingly GPU-intensive.\nThe problem is that nobody really makes machines like this one anymore -- the netbook sector has been eaten up by tablets on the low end and ultrabooks on the high end. Plus, call me old fashioned but I hate throwing away a perfectly good machine.\nHave any of you tried running 12.10 on an Eee 1000 or a similarly-spec'ed netbook? How did it work out?\n\nA: My experience with an Eee PC 1215 is that Ubuntu 12.10 with Unity is no fun to use on this machine. Opening the dash or typing in it is sluggish. But I can recommend Ubuntu 12.04 on the 1215 (which has a dual core Atom CPU with 2GB RAM and integrated Intel graphics) which is fast enough for fluid working. \nSo if you want to upgrade to a more recent Ubuntu try 12.04 which also has long term support.\n\nA: I am writing from an eee 1000 and I have enjoyed this machine for the past 4 years.\nI recently installed Ubuntu 12.10 using the Minimal CD.  The text installer after the basic setup,  will ask for what packages you want to download and install.  I only seleced \"Ubuntu Base Server\" and \"OpenSSH Server\", without any Desktop Environment (GNOME, XFCE, etc.).  Then I install my preferred minimalistic tiling window manager: dwm.\nEverything works out of the box (wifi, audio, mic, etc.) and my eee has never been faster.\n\nPS: if you are looking for a less radical solution, try crunchbang linux, it's a pretty lightweight debian-based distro that runs well on an eee.\n\nA: Lubuntu seems to be a widely preferred alternative, followed by Xubuntu. I reckon Linux Mint might also run ok.\n\nA: ubuntu 12.04 with unity 2d has been very good on eeepc 701, unity is amazing on a small screen, you should try it with a live cd/usb and see what you think. DO NOT USE 12.10\n\nA: EasyPeasy (Formerly Ubuntu Eee or Eeebuntu, I forget which - the other became AuroraOS) seems very nice and snappy for me. I just installed it on my Eee901, which is essentially the same device as yours with a 1.2\" smaller screen.\nEverything worked straight out of the box, it's fairly responsive - a short pause before opening each program, which is survivable, and battery life seems decent on a 4 year old machine.\n", "Q: PHP `virtual()` with Apache MultiViews not working after upgrade to 12.04 I use PHP's virtual() directive quite a lot on one of my sites, including central elements. This worked fine for the last ~10 years -- but after upgrading to 12.04 it somehow got broken.\nExample setup (simplified)\nTo make it easier to understand, I simplify some things (contents). So say I need a HTML fragment like <P>For further instructions, please look <A HREF='foobar'>here</P> in multiple pages. 10 years ago, I used SSI for that, so it is put into a file in a central place -- so if e.g. the targeted URL changes, I only need to update it in one place. To serve multiple languages, I have Apache's MultiViews enabled -- and at $DOCUMENT_ROOT/central/ there are the files:\n\n*\n\n*foobar.html (English variant, and the default)\n\n*foobar.html.de (German variant).\n\nNow in the PHP code, I simply placed:\n<? virtual(\"/central/foobar\"); ?>\nand let Apache take care to deliver the correct language variant.\nThe problem\nAs said, this worked fine for about 10 years: German visitors got the German variant, all others the English (depending on their preferred language). But after upgrading to Ubuntu 12.04, it no longer worked: Either nothing was delivered from the virtual() command, or (in connection with framesets) it even ended up in binary gibberish.\nTrying to figure out what happens, I played with a lot of things. I first thought MultiViews was (somehow) not available anymore -- but calling http://<server>/central/foobar showed the right variant, depending on the configured language preferences. This also proved there was nothing wrong with file permissions. The error.log gave no clues either (no error message thrown).\nFinally, just as a \"last ressort\", I changed the PHP command to <? virtual(\"central/foobar.html\"); ?> -- and that very same file was in fact included. But the language dependend stuff obviously did no longer work.\nOf course I tried to find some change (most likely in PHP's virtual() command), using Google a lot, and also searching the questions here -- unfortunately to no avail.\nFinally: The question\nPutting \"design questions\" aside (surely today I would design things differently -- but at least currently I miss the time to change that for a quite huge amount of pages): What can be done to make it work again? I surely missed something -- but I cannot figure out what...\nAddition (EDIT)\nMy remaining problem now is that as soon as the document needs to be negotiated (e.g. has different language variants), virtual() always adds the content at the very beginning of the generated document (i.e. in front of the <HTML> tag) -- regardless where it was placed. It however gets placed correctly when no negotiation is involved.\nAny idea what's going on there, and how to fix it?\n\nA: As the \"binary gibberish\" mentioned above made me curious, I investigated a bit further and copy-pasted it into a file named foo.gz, and ran gzip -d foo.gz. As already suspected, this yielded no error message (though the output still was gibberish -- just different gibberish). Comparing the /etc/apache2/mods-enabled on my new machine with a similar setup on an older machine turned up mod_deflate being enabled on the new machine. So I removed that from the enabled mods (by simply deleting the symbolic links deflate.conf and deflate.load), reloaded Apache... problem solved. At least it looks like...\nEdit:\nOnly the \"gibberish part\" is solved by disabling mod_deflate. Remaining issue: As soon as the link passed to virtual() triggers mod_negotiation (i.e. the MultiViews part), the included text is moved to the very top of the output (i.e. in front of the <HTML> tag), which breaks most pages. If the targeted link does not need to be negotiated, the included text is placed correctly. Very confusing.\n", "Q: empathy can't connect to facebook chat I am using ubuntu 12.10, and when I try to connect to my Facebook account through Empathy, it gets disconnected and says this account is already connected to the server.\n\nA: I had the same problem. Here is what I did and it worked perfectly so maybe it would work for you. I just deleted the account and added it again. The Ubuntu did the rest  automatically for me (asked for email / login and password). Now it is working properly.\n\nA: Try manually conecting to Facebook chat, as it's really a jabber server. Set up a new XMPP/Jabber account. Use this settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*User Name: Your Facebook username (your url, such as http://www.facebook.com/my.username.\n\n*Domain: chat.facebook.com\n\n*Jabber identifier: your.username@chat.facebook.com\n\n*Password: Your facebook passsword.\n\n*Server: chat.facebook.com\n\n*Port: 5222\n\n*Use SSL/TLS: Yes\nIf asked, use plain text as autentication.\nHope it helps you! For more information, check Facebook's chat page.\n\nA: Other people have also been having this issue on other chat clients, such as pidgin and trillian. I think facebook may have changed something, although some people seem to have it back up. \nHere's some posts that are related, hopefully this helps\nhttp://www.ceruleanstudios.com/forums/showthread.php?p=854491\n", "Q: How do I delete these files in the /root directory?

The same for others that appear.\nUPDATE -\nIf you really want to delete all of them AND you are sure they will not create any problem with the system or that you have additional files with the \"Trash\" word in them (Like music or video files), then you can do the following:\nsudo find / -type d -name '*Trash*' -exec rm -fr {} \\;\nThis will delete EVERYTHING with the name \"Trash\" in them in every place that is mounted.\nIf you get an error like the following:\nfind: `/home/cyrex/.local/share/Trash': No such file or directory   \nfind: `/media/cyrex/xtreme/.Trash-1000': No such file or directory    \n\nit means that a previous delete already eliminated the Folder, so the rest that were found in the same folder are already gone. No need to worry about this.\nYou can double check if everything was deleted by executing the command again.\nThis will create a problem with the Trash Can icon in Unity since it will still show as FULL.\n\nA: Short and simple:    \nsudo find / -type d -name 'Trash' -exec rm -rf {} \\;\n\nMore information:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-how-to-find-and-remove-files/\n\n*http://gerardmcgarry.com/blog/linux-using-find-utility-with-regex-delete-files\n", "Q: How to write Appindicators in python?

Here's what I use these days if I use synaptics:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"Default clickpad buttons\"\n    MatchDriver \"synaptics\"\n    Option \"SoftButtonAreas\" \"50% 0 66% 0 0 0 0 0\"\n    Option \"TapButton2\" \"2\"\n    Option \"TapButton3\" \"3\"\n    Option \"CoastingFriction\" \"5\"\n    Option \"CoastingSpeed\" \"8\"\n    Option \"AccelFactor\" \"0.1\"\n    Option \"PalmDetect\" \"1\"\n    Option \"PalmMinWidth\" \"4\"\n    Option \"PalmMinZ\" \"30\"\n    Option \"VertEdgeScroll\" \"1\"\n    Option \"FingerHigh\" \"35\"\n    Option \"FingerLow\" \"20\"\nEndSection\n\nIf you don't know what settings you want, you can test in the command line. Find ones you like, then put in file.  LIke this\nsynclient -l\n\nlists all settings, then test some like\nsynclient VertEdgeScroll=0 FingerHigh=30\n\nWhen you do that, the cursor will respond differently right away. Of course, when you change settings in xorg.conf.d, you need to log out and log in again.\nNow, since you are (probably) using libinput, you might stop where you are and instead consider learning to configure libinput.  It is the new thing, the way things will be (probably), and the way things are in Fedora now.  It is a much less configurable device, but it is trying to get right the basic fundamentals and then forget the rest.\nlibinput is mostly usable the way it is, but it does not have tap to click enabled.  You go through the same process you did before, copying a file from /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d, except this time get the one for libinput. That needs almost no changes, except to insert this one line in the very last stanza.\n Section \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"MyTouchpad\"\n    MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n    Driver \"libinput\"\n    Option \"Tapping\" \"on\n EndSection\n\nIf you do that, then I think you will get two finger drag and some other basics.\nThe libinput driver is not so full of features, it is trying to get the basics correct, hopefully we won't think we need all those features.  However, on many devices (you'll see people yelling about this everywhere), the automatic, simple feature settings are not working exactly right.

If I have gnome-screensaver running, it simply blanks the screen. On the other hand, if I run xscreensaver and use the xscreensaver-command --lock, then it runs the selected screensaver, but it uses the UGLY UGLY xscreensaver login prompt. \nI've read the following:\nCan I replace the XScreenSaver lock dialog with the version from Gnome-Screensaver\nBut it doesn't appear to answer the question. Instead, it simply answers that there's a hacky way of 'themeing' the xscreensaver. \nAny advice on what I should do if I want a halfway decent looking login screen with some type of idle computation/display application?\n\nA: On 12.04 you can install both xscreensaver and keep default gnome-screensaver, together, despite the \"warnings\" about how xscreensaver won't run unless you stop gnome-screensaver (which aren't true).\nIf you have, in \"brightness and lock\" settings under system settings, the screen set to \"require my password when waking from suspend\", then, if xscreensaver kicked in before the computer suspended (a question of timing), you will see xscreensaver running on wakeup, and you will have to unlock xscreensaver (the ugly xfce theme), and you will then also be greeted by another screen to unlock, the gnome-screensave theme. This happens for me even if I set xscreensaver to NOT lock the screen. That's the best I can figure. You can have xscreensaver's unlock screen or both, but you can't have just gnome-screensaver's unlock, if you want xscreensaver.\nEdit: After resuming from suspend that would have happened after the lock screen timeout for gnome-screensaver AND with lock screen UNselected for xscreensaver, the gnome-screensaver unlock will quickly come up to interrupt the xscreensaver and I will only have to unlock gnome-screensaver's \"pretty\" screen, without being bothered by the xscreensaver lock dialog even once.

I haven't committed to installing it yet, because I don't really understand the consequences.\nMy main concerns are that instead of simply selecting Windows or Ubuntu in Grub, I would also have to change my Bootmode every single time, which seems like a lot more trouble than it should be. \nSo, the question: how can I install Ubuntu 12.04 or 12.10 in UEFI boot mode?\n\nA: This is probably a Secure Boot issue, at least in part. (Selecting the correct EFI-mode boot option may be part of the issue, too.) On the one system I've got that can handle Secure Boot, enabling it and trying to boot from a disc that can boot in either EFI or BIOS mode, but without a valid Secure Boot signature, results in a BIOS-mode boot, even if I tell the computer to boot in EFI mode. This behavior exactly matches your description of what's happening to you. Furthermore, you say this is a new computer with Windows 8 installed, which means that it almost certainly shipped with Secure Boot active.\nIf I'm right, you have three options for how to proceed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Secure Boot in your firmware -- this is the easiest method if you're familiar with setting basic firmware options, but you'll need to track down the right  one.\n\n*Install using a distribution that's been signed with a Secure Boot key -- Ubuntu 12.04's installer has not been so signed, AFAIK, but I suspect that Ubuntu 12.10's has been. I'm not positive of that, though. (I've not yet tested it on my Secure Boot-capable PC.) Fedora 18 is supposed to be signed, but it's not yet been released, and I'm not sure of the status of whatever pre-release version is out there.\n\n*Create your own Secure Boot keys, sign everything yourself, and use Secure Boot in that way. This is the hardest approach by far.\n\n\nFor more information on all of these approaches, see this Web page I wrote on the subject. Note that the Web page says nothing about OS installation. Most of the issues and procedures would be the same for OS installation as for anything else, but modifying files on an installation CD is trickier than modifying files on a USB flash drive, so keep that in mind when you're considering your options.\n\nAddition: I can think of a number of reasons why you might be getting an \"Operating system not found\" message even when booting in EFI mode with Secure Boot disabled. I suggest you check the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check your Secure Boot setting again. Yes, I know you said you've disabled it, but firmware settings can be tricky sometimes. It's worth double-checking.\n\n*Using gdisk or parted, verify that the USB drive you're using has a valid GUID Partition Table (GPT) with an EFI System Partition (ESP; identified as partition type code EF00 in gdisk, or by a \"boot\" flag in parted). If the disk uses an MBR partition table, a fussy firmware might reject it. Likewise if it lacks an ESP.\n\n*If the disk uses a hybrid optical disc/hard disk configuration (as some installation disk images do), it could be that a fussy firmware will reject it. In this case, backing it up, creating a fresh GPT on the disk with a new ESP, and restoring everything on a file-by-file basis might get it working.\n\n*Mount the ESP and look for a file called EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi. (Case shouldn't matter; but see below.) This is the boot loader file. If it's absent, the disk won't boot. You'll need to figure out what happened to the file and restore it.\n\n*Although the FAT filesystem used on ESPs is case-insensitive, I've encountered one badly broken EFI with case sensitivity issues. Messing with the filename case might fix it, but there are a lot of possible variants.\n\n*Check that the ESP uses FAT32, not FAT16. Most EFIs seem to be happy with both, but the spec does say the ESP should be FAT32, and I know of one implementation that's unhappy with a FAT16 ESP.\n\n\nYou could also try booting something else in EFI mode. One possibility is rEFInd, which is an EFI boot loader that, if you can get it to boot, it may be able to detect and run the Ubuntu installer's boot loader. There's a CD image of rEFInd, but that really is a CD image, not a USB image. To create a USB image, you'd need to download the binary file and install it manually. Tip: There's a new install.sh script that's available here. (It's destined for the next release, but that release isn't finalized yet.) This version of the script includes a new option, --usedefault, that can be used to help create a bootable USB flash drive. You'd use it like this:\nsudo ./install.sh --usedefault /dev/sdc1\n\nThis example should create an EFI-bootable USB flash drive on /dev/sdc1, provided that partition is an ESP on the USB flash drive. Note that you must partition the disk and create a FAT ESP before running install.sh.\nOne more possibility is to install in BIOS mode and then sort it out later. You can install rEFInd, gummiboot, or an EFI-enabled version of GRUB after installing in BIOS mode. You might need to jump through some hoops with renaming boot loaders to get things working, but if you can't get your installer to boot in EFI mode, this may be your only option.\n\nA: Use the 64-bit installer. Hopefully, you are comfortable with dealing your BIOS*. You need to ensure that your DVD Drive/USB ports are considered first for bootable media before your HDD or the Windows Boot Manager. Then, you need to add the .efi found in the \"efi\" directory of your Ubuntu installer to your whitelist; for this, check the \"Security\" tab of your BIOS. You might need to set certain passwords first before you can proceed with this. After whitelisting, restart with your installer inserted (USB port, DVD Drive, wherever) and you should be able to boot from it now.\nBased on my experience, though you may get to boot from your LiveCD, that may not be the end of your problems. Feel to ask around (and browse the previous questions) and good luck with dual booting!\n*If not, there are plenty of howtos online. Proceed with caution though!

If you use the -j option, it will strip out all paths, as there isn't really an equivalent of the tar option --strip with which different levels of path removal can be specified. \nSo please cd to your target directory (kit123) and enter:\nzip -r kit123.zip *\n\nThis will recursively (-r) preserve all (*) files and directories of files in the current directory (kit123), and as relative paths (-p) are preserved automatically unless the -j option is present, the directory structure will be as you wished. Kit123 and subfolders (kitpart1) with their own files will be present:\nkit123\n    kitpart1\n        file.xcf\n        anotherfile.xcf\n    kitpart2\n\nYou can check the contents of the zip file with unzip -l zipfile.zip.\nFor more information on the other options available for zip, see man zip and the Ubuntu manpage online.\n", "Q: Lubuntu 12.10: Icon Display Problems First off, I would like to let you know that I am new to Linux. I finally decided to give it a try and my first project was installing Lubuntu on an old PC and using it for a media server for my PS3.\nSo, one thing that I noticed right away is that my icons for applications, files, folders, etc...are not visible. If I move my mouse over the name of the application or file (It only works if I move the mouse up from the bottom of the name) then the icon will appear, but if I move my mouse back over any other place on the file the icon will disappear again. Also, if I open a folder sometimes an icon or two will be displayed but the rest won't, and like I said before if I move my mouse over the top of the application or file the icon will disappear.\nIs there any way to fix this? Is this normal? Or could it be a problem with my hardware? I never had this issue when I was running the last OS (Windows XP). Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Right now the power statistics show that:\nEnergy when full: 25.5 Wh  \nEnergy (design):  93.2 Wh\n\nAnd indeed the battery doesn't seem to be lasting as long as it used too. \nMy question:\nIs this data reliable? Does it really indicate that I should replace the battery, or could it be the charger, laptop, or OS that is stopping the battery from fully charging?\nIs any way of validating the battery is indeed to blame? I'd like to be sure before shelling out 90$ for a new battery.\n(If it helps, the battery is a 3 year old dell 9 cell rated at 90 Wh).\n\nA: For x86 laptops, the battery information you see in /sys/class/power_supply/*/uevent is as accurate as the data provided from the battery.  Typically this smart battery data comes over something like an i2c bus via an embedded controller and firmware allows one to gather the dynamically changing information via the ACPI battery status _BST control and the hard-set static battery information via _BIX or _BIF controls.   Since these are the standard ACPI interfaces and are accessible to userspace via the /sys/class/power_supply/*/uevent data I suspect the data you see here is exactly what Windows will be seeing too.\nThe only thing which will be different is the way the data is presented to you in higher level applications and widgets. Who knows what kinds of data averaging tricks will be done on the data in these applications.  In my opinion, if you want to see what the battery is actually reporting, look at the /sys interface.\n\nA: As a person with an experience with battery failures, here is a strategy: \n\n\n*\n\n*For two consecutive days work with the charger plugged in. On the third day, work with the battery. When the battery strength goes upto 5% set it to charging.\n\n*One a month, completely discharge your battery overnight by starting it in the expert command prompt mode. \n\n\nA good solution to get the maximum out of your battery. Furthermore, a battery has a certain number of cycles (charging and discharging). Near the end of the number of cycles, the battery would go down. The lesser the charging and discharging cycles go, the battery would last the longer. But make sure that you DO discharge the battery completely once in a month. \nRegarding the answer to the question: the battery power status is displayed differently in M$WINDOWS and Ubuntu Linux.

It started up fine, but it couldn't read the adapter (WN111v2) so I tried entering the disk for it but that didn't work either.

The manual will also provide the default username/password.\nNext, find the router's reset hole. Use a pin and reset it. Next connect your computer to the router. Switch on your router and the computer. Your computer will negotiate with the router and obtain an IP address. \nNow, type the IP address of the router (as provided by the manual) in a browser.

If neither of these packages can be removed then try the following command to install the nouveau driver as I believe it will make it current in any case.  To remove a driver other than nvidia-current or nvidia-current-updates we will need to know exactly what it was that you installed.\nIf you want to make sure the current open source nouveau driver is installed, do \nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-nouveau\n\nSince you're still having trouble, re-install the current driver then see if you can set a better resolution with nvidia-settings.\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nthen type 'nvidia settings' into the dash and click on the icon it finds.  Resolution can be found under the tab 'Xserver Display Configuration'  If that works save the settings.\nIf it doesn't work, then repeat the exercise but install nvidia-current-updates then run nvidia-settings again.\n\nA: also another option to look into use using the nvidia console and changing the resolution to the proper size for your display, or using Jupiter to change the resolution (Which I have now found to be the quickest option for switching resolutions)\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/jupiter\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install jupiter\n\nand then from unity launch Jupiter and it will be a small indicator where you can then change resolution and screens.\n", "Q: How do I find what kernel module is behind a network interface? How do I find out what kernel module is used for any given network interface?\n\nA: IMHO for scripts the best is to use sysfs info (as Jeremy Kerr shows), but for more info:\nethtool -i IFACE_NAME\n\nE.g.:\n$ ethtool -i eth0\ndriver: 8139cp\nversion: 1.3\nfirmware-version: \nbus-info: 0000:00:07.0\nsupports-statistics: yes\nsupports-test: no\nsupports-eeprom-access: yes\nsupports-register-dump: yes\nsupports-priv-flags: no\n\n\nA: For USB devices you can use the lsusb command e.g.:\nlsusb -t\n\n\nA: On the command line run\nsudo lshw -C network \n\nFor every network interface you'll get a section starting with *-network. Every section hast a logical name: line that contains the interface name and a configuration: line that contain the driver and some other information.\n\nA: You can query sysfs to tell you this information. To tell which driver a network interface is using:\nls -l /sys/class/net/<devname>/device/driver\n\n... where <devname> is something like eth0. This driver directory will be a symlink to the driver node in sysfs.\nTo get the name of the module that provides that driver:\nls -l /sys/class/net/<devname>/device/driver/module\n\n... and this module directory will be a symlink to the module node in sysfs.\n", "Q: How can I remove modem-manager from boot? I would like to remove  modem-manager service from my boot, how can I do it ?\n\nA: The simplest way is to:\nsudo apt-get purge modemmanager\n\nWorks fine in 12.04 LTS. Nothing in my system had dependencies on modemmanager.\nOr you could search for \"modemmanager\" in the Ubuntu Software Center and remove it from there (the title is \"D-Bus service for managing modems\").\n\nA: This it looks to work fine: \nsudo mv /usr/share/dbus-1/system-services/org.freedesktop.ModemManager.service /usr/share/dbus-1/system-services/org.freedesktop.ModemManager.service.disabled\n\nInstead this doesn't work ( don't know y ):\n\"echo manual | sudo tee -a /etc/init/modemmanager.override\"\n\n\nA: systemctl disable ModemManager.service\nsystemctl stop ModemManager.service\n\nThis worked to disable UML-295 modem from being managed by ModemManger which in turn enabled web-control via http://mbb.vzw.com on CentOS 7.\nCheck after disabling via:\nsystemctl list-dependencies multi-user.target | grep Modem\n\n\nA: *\n\n*If it is SysV init style symbolic links\nupdate-rc.d [-n] [-f] base_name remove\n\n\n*If it is per user (X11 session), check the following folders and remote corresponding files:\n~/.config/autostart    \n/etc/xdg/autostart\n\n\nA: I found this had only a deleterious function when I tried the experimental version in Debian Sid and it failed to find my modem at all. That nearly doubled my speed and drops and failures became rare. I will probably remove it but for the time I want it to suspend function.\nIn /etc/init.d I stored this file:\n#!/bin/sh\n# NOMODEMMANAGER.sh DHM, Feb'19\n# The ModemManager appears to slow down and interfere with the internet on my Dell laptop.\nModemManager --no-auto-scan\n\n", "Q: USB write speed irregular I would like some advice on why this is happening to my USB devices...\nI have tried a few USB 2.0 pendrives, FAT32, EXT4, NTFS. All no more than 16 GB big.\nRead speeds are fine (25-27MB/s)\nWrite speeds however...\nStart really fast i.e. 50 to 60 MB/s then drops significantly down to 10MB/s before gradually slowing down to 2MB/s and less.\nOverall the copy process is extremely slow. 30min for 3 files totalling 4.5GB and even slower for 8,422 php/css/html files totalling 352MB.\nWhere do I begin? Google and forums yielded no help.\n--Update--\nI have run benchmarks since acquiring Windows 7 and various other flash pendrives and HDDs.\nThere is a significant difference. Windows shows transfer speeds averaging around 80MB/s where as Ubuntu never averages above 11MB/s. Same hardware, same USB ports.\nThis, along with poor battery life is quite disheartening.\n\nA: Write speeds are fast to begin with because the blocks of data are being cached and are in the process of being eventually written back to the slow device.  After some time, the available memory for caching will run out and you then get throttled back to the speed of the underlying USB device. So this is why you see the performance drop over time for a large write to the USB device.   So I expect you have a USB pendrive that has fast read access but slow writes, and the caching effect makes it seem that it fast to begin with but ultimately you are seeing the native write speed of your flash device.\n", "Q: Can I remote upload URLs to Ubuntuone account? There is a file on Internet which weighs 3GB, and I need it to directly transfer that file to My UbuntuOne account.. Can I do that?\n\nA: To answer this question: I highly doubt that you could do that because it works a lot like Dropbox where it downloads to your computer and then uploads to their server. I am pretty sure there isn't a way to do that...there is a php script that can do server to server but I don't know if it would work with UbuntuOne or not...though I doubt it would.

I need to complete my installation today because i need some important data from my external hard disk which is not accessible in Windows.\n\nA: In the case of the important data you can always run your live cd and access the external hd.

To say it more precisely:  I want to make the current window as big as possible without overlapping new windows (windows already overlapped should be ignored).\nIs there a keyboard shortcut or an extension to the KDE Window Manager that makes such a shortcut or a window button?\nI would also appreciate a hint, how to write a script that could do this window thing on keyboard shortcut invocation. I am a programmer but don't know what the best way is to control KDE Windows via script.\n\nA: So, I wanted to avoid the classic \"someone else had this problem but no one has answered this\" google result. I'm not an Ubuntu/Kubuntu user but I found that the behaviour you desire has been in the bug reports for almost 9 years for KDE.

You can do more but this is the bare necessary.\nAlso, because you are installing from a usb, don't forget to change the boot to your hdd. I believe that by default it goes to your usb.\nI hope this helps, and enjoy ubuntu ;).\n\nA: first of all a quick terminology check. - I assume you partitioned your drive and you created a 25 gigabyte partition where you intend to install Ubuntu. \nIf you want a swap partition, then now is a good time, before you install, to delete that partition you made and create a new 25GB minus your desired swap partition size.\nA good swap size is somewhat a matter of opinion these days, and depends on the amount of RAM in your computer. As a very rough rule, go with the same size swap as your amount of RAM, assuming you have at least 2GB or RAM (as you are running Windows 7, I will assume you do.\nSo, make a 23GB parition and make another 2GB partition for swap.\nDon't bother formatting it with NTFS this time, as you will need a different format for your Ubuntu install. In fact you are probably better off just leaving the space unpartitioned and allowing the Ubuntu installer to deal with it.\nYour Ubuntu installation should go well, and if you install the boot loader (GRUB) to the Master boot record, you should, when Ubuntu has finished installing, be able to dual boot into Windows 7 and Ubuntu. That is the way it is designed to work.\nHowever, things can go wrong, and as there are so many variables and possibilities, the best advice I feel that I can offer you is to find somebody who knows how to recover an non-bootable system and who has the tools to do it. If you can get them to hold your hand as it were, during the installation, you will be fine. \nIf you decide to go it alone, then do the installation beside another computer that has access to the Internet, so that if at any point during the installation you feel uncomfortable about something, you can search for help. Be careful when choosing the partitions to install to. \nSomething you could do, if you are up for it, is to install virtualbox http://www.virtualbox.org on your windows 7 OS and create a virtual machine to practice installing Ubuntu on a virtual hard disk. This may allow you to become more comfortable with the installation procedure before you go ahead and install on your internal HD.\nIt goes without saying that you should backup your entire Windows 7 install before you proceed.\nAt the very least, (as to be honest, if you are wary of installing Ubuntu, a full backup that would allow you to restore to a bootable system may be somewhat impractical for you) make a copy on an external USB memory or hard drive of all your work and documents, and ensure you have your original Windows 7 restore media and installation media for the programs you have installed, so that in the case of absolute disaster, you can factory install your Windows 7 and then restore your applications and your personal files.\nI won't address the issue of the live USB, as you don't actually ask a question there, however, if you are asking for help with that, I would suggest you refrain from asking about two issues in the one thread.\n", "Q: Can't change remmina quality I'm using remmina on Ubuntu 12.04 to connect to a windows xp computer.\nI'm trying to change the connection quality on \"preferences-RDP-quality option\" from \"poor(fastest)\" to \"good\".

I've deployed a haproxy->lamp->mysql stack using juju. It seemed pretty straight forward and it works well from my tests. I've also seen its easy to scale a layer and add extra units to the lamp servers for example. The rest of our configuration on the server is done by puppet.\nHowever within the same environment \"ec2\" (specified in my environments.yaml) in this case, I wish to deploy another set of servers using the same formular haproxy->lamp->mysql.\nHowever it doesnt seem possible as you get this error:\nERROR Service name 'mysql' is already in use\n\nIs there a way to do this? \nI had the idea to create separate environments in the yaml file with the same EC2 credentials but this seems like its going to spin up an extra juju config server per environment. As we are running over 250 web sites in these type of stacks that means an extra 250 servers on our AWS bill which is far from ideal.\nIdeally I'm aiming to deploy multiple haproxy->lamp->mysql stacks without having to create new charms for each website. \nAny suggestions welcome or if it can't be done I need to rethink things.\n\nA: Yuu can explicitly name services in juju. So for for example instead of:\njuju deploy haproxy\njuju deploy mysql\n\nyou can just name them whatever you want:\njuju deploy haproxy mynewproxy\njuju deploy mysql dbserver2\n\nor whatever fits your model. You just need to remember to add-relation based on name after that, so: juju add-relation mynewproxy dbserver2\nIt's awesome that you're using juju for this, if you want to give us some feedback on how it's working out for you please send a post to the juju mailing list.\n", "Q: How to make a Ubuntu LiveCD (on a USB) I would like to make a LiveCD (on a USB flash drive) so I can run GParted and edit my partitions.\nHow would I make the LiveCD?

It's pretty fancy. But, regardless of how cool it is I will never switch back to Unity.\nAfter a cursory glance at the facilities that enable the Webapps interface to work, it appears this is not possible - at least at the moment.\nI considered perhaps making a gnome-shell extension to create an interface object that would act as the Unity object in gnome-shell. This couldn't possibly work though because the facility to install the webapps is a Firefox/Chromium extension called Unity Desktop Integration. This extension allows for installations to be scripted on a web page. \nGnome-shell, too, has a plugin called Gnome Shell Integration which allows extensions to be installed from a web page, however it is only available for use on extensions.gnome.org for security reasons. So other sites cannot use the scripting available on extensions.gnome.org on another site (such as Pandora, Gmail, etc).\nSo, unless somebody makes a bridge between the Javascript in the browser and the Javascript in gnome-shell it is currently impossible. Again, it is a potential security vulnerability to allow for any arbitrary site to have script access to gnome-shell, so even if a new FF/Chromium extension were to pop up translating the Unity Webapps capability to gnome-shell it would have to be restricted to a limited subset of sites. Not saying this wouldn't still be useful.\nAlso, Unity webapps are launched using a program called unity-webapps-runner. Therefore, somebody would have to create a similar program (or modify Unity's) to actually run the webapps in gnome-shell. Then again, I don't believe that Unity is scriptable like gnome-shell (ie. gnome-shell extensions), so they may need this program to make the webapps show up in the unity notification panel. This type of facility already exists in gnome-shell in the form of extensions, so this step may not be necessary.\n\nA: Unfortunately no\nUnity web app is a unique feature of unity, and it is not yet (15/11/2012) ported to gnome shell or other DE\n", "Q: find hidden URL for streaming radio I would like to find a utility that can find the hidden URL to eg this streaming radio\nso I can use that in mocp (music on console player). \nURLsnooper is there for windows, but I can't find an alternative for Linux.\n\nA: This playlist is readable with any old text-editor, which will reveal the URL?\n[playlist]\nnumberofentries=1\nFile1=http://91.121.91.110:4000\nTitle1=(#1 - 26/150) M2 CALIENTE : ONLY LATIN MUSIC - Live From Paris France - www.m2radio.fr\nLength1=-1\nVersion=2\n\nSo unless you mean something else entirely, the url you are looking for is http://91.121.91.110:4000 ?\nIn that case the utility is anything that can read txt files (Vim, gedit, less, more, cat etc :)  )\nFor clarity, this is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*go to that url in my browser, and save it as a file\n\n*\n\n*alternatively you could use \"wget\" in the commandline to download it.  \n\n*the object of this step is to get that file (called tinein-station.pls) on your computer\n\n\n*Open the file with any program that you would use to read .txt files.

This is a GRUB bug. You can try replacing the entry with something like the following:\nmenuentry \"Windows 7\" {\n    insmod part_gpt\n    insmod chain\n    set root='(hd0,gpt5)'\n    chainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nI make no guarantees that this will work, but it might. If it does, add that entry to /etc/grub.d/40_custom so that it will be created again whenever Ubuntu updates its GRUB configuration.\nAnother option is to use a different boot manager in addition to or instead of GRUB. rEFInd, for instance, will auto-detect both Windows and GRUB; and if you're using 3.3.0 or later kernels (as shipped with Ubuntu 12.10, but not with Ubuntu 12.04), you can boot Linux directly with rEFInd, bypassing GRUB entirely. gummiboot is another option with similar boot capabilities, but it requires more manual maintenance if you wanted to boot Linux directly with gummiboot.\n\nA: Finally i've solved formatting and reinstalling everything from scratch ... basically ( don't know why ) grub had overwritten the windows 7 loader, that was the problem.\n\nA: As of today, in Xubuntu 22.04, I have been using the information provided above for my laptop using UEFI. However now I have had to add the location of the ESP partition to the chainloader line.\nThis is what my working configuration looks like now:\nmenuentry \"Windows 10\" {\ninsmod part_gpt\ninsmod chain\nset root='(hd0,gpt4)'\nchainloader (hd0,gpt2)/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n\n}\nAlso, the file in which I have had to insert it in order for it to work, is the file \" custom \" located under /etc/grub.d/proxifiedScripts.\nOne more annoyance was occurring at the same time : several sets of entries had appeared in the Grub boot stanza for the same Xubuntu install (not several installs). I have used grub-customizer, installed from its PPA, to fix it.\nIt seemed to me that the different entries had been generated through several proxy files located under /etc/grub.d, probably 10_linux_proxy, 31_linux_proxy, and 41_linux_proxy.\nI would not dare change the default settings manually, of course.\n\nA: This an Update to the Answer for this question -- Ubuntu 22.04 MATE either ignores or otherwise over wrote my Win 10 Pro boot ... a quick jump to Ventoy and loading the Win10 ISO installer and then select Repair Boot fixes the issue ... whether it comes back after a kernel update remains to be seen :P\nThx/Sx\n", "Q: Softwares and lib files I have been using suse until now.

Is there any way to see packages and library lists on Ubuntu like opensuse?\n\nA: There are multiple ways to find a Ubuntu package:\n\n*\n\n*Use https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/ to find the package via a browser.\n\n\n*Use Ubuntu Software center and search for the package you are looking for.

The language switches only in Windows and it passed to Linux. The problem with the language/keyboard mapping was until i changed to remote control on linux from TigerVNC to TurboVNC.\n\nA: I have exactly the same problem when connecting to a remote instance on AWS.

See for instance this thread, which describes a detailed work-around.\nEDIT: Took me a while to get back to this, but since there has been no further activity in this thread, I finally got around to add details as suggested (demanded?) in the comments. \nThese are the steps I had to do to fix the keyboard layout in xrdp in Ubuntu 12.04.

I just ran setxkbmap -print on the client PC (which incidently also runs Ubuntu 12.04) to get an idea about these values. Note that setxkbmap needs to have a display to run. You can either run the console through a RDP session or perhaps even login through ssh with X display redirection, like this ssh -X <server>.\n\n*Generate XRDP keymap file:\nxrdp-genkeymap km-0414.ini\nsudo mv km-0414.ini /etc/xrdp\nsudo chown root:root /etc/xrdp/km-0414.ini\n\nReplace the country code 0414 with the correct code for your country.

If this file can't be found, is there another way to recover data?\n\nA: You cannot view your data until you recover the root.disk. See this post for information (selected details shown below). Note that recovery does not work in all instances.\nHere's a summary of what is detailed in the post linked to  above. First run chkdsk /f, look for the hidden \\found.??? directories, and check for a file named file0000.chk that's about the same size as your old root.disk:\nC:\\>dir /a:h\nC:\\>cd \\found.000\nC:\\found.000>dir\n Volume in drive C is OS\n Volume Serial Number is B4B7-99A8\n\n Directory of C:\\found.000\n\n19/07/2011  02:02 PM    15,000,000,000 file0000.chk\n               1 File(s) 15,000,000,000 bytes\n               0 Dir(s)  222,258,069,504 bytes free\n\nC:\\found.000>move file0000.chk \\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk\n        1 file(s) moved.\n\nNOTE: you have to run those commands from CMD.EXE that you selected \"Run as administrator\".\nI really don't advise running boot-repair on Wubi installs. This is what it did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace your windows bootloader with a generic syslinux MBR bootloader\n\n*Reset the boot flag on /dev/sda1 (already set)\n\n*Attempt to fsck the root.disk (failed)\n\n*Announce \"Boot successfully repaired\"\n\n\nI've asked the author to fix this a number of times. I'm not sure what forcing an fsck on a root.disk with NTFS corruption does, but it can't fix that and I would avoid anything that jeopardizes recovery.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Nexus 7 as USB device does not work I connected USB cable from Nexus 7 running Ubuntu to my Ubuntu laptop but there is no new USB device found when I run lsusb.

The steps are summarized here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the go-mtpfs library, which you'll be using to connect:\nsudo apt-get install golang fuse git-core libmtp-dev libfuse-dev\nsudo adduser $USER fuse\nmkdir /tmp/go \nGOPATH=/tmp/go go get github.com/hanwen/go-mtpfs\nsudo mv /tmp/go/bin/go-mtpfs /usr/bin/\nmkdir ~/MyAndroid\n\n\nNote: At some point during installation, a screen may come up in your terminal asking if you want to share information about public Go packages you install with the developers. Feel free to answer this question however you want.\n\n\n*Mount your Nexus 7 or whatever using this command after plugging it into your USB port:\ngo-mtpfs ~/MyAndroid &\n\n\n*When you are finished, unmount your device by using this command:\nfusermount -u ~/MyAndroid\n\nI would also like to thank James Gifford for pointing this article out to me on Google+. ;)\n\nA: I found that it doesn't work with cheap cables - if it doesn't even show \"Nexus\" in lsusb, your cable is bad. Try a better one.\n\nA: If the Nexus tablet has the Software Data Cable app available, this program will let you easily transfer files via a wireless link.

The question is clearly about \"Nexus 7 running Ubuntu\" and as far as I understand there is no special service in this first Ubutu port for the Nexus 7 that acts as a USB device.

I always get the message: No space left in ‘/’. (which is NOT the path I backup to).\nThe preferences are set to back up my Home ignoring Trash. And the destination has ~500GB of space free!\nIs there some way to get to the cause of this strange error? (which internally fails, because not being able to allocate space in /tmp.)\nEDIT:\nAdded more details.\n\nA: I don't use that tool but I suppose that even if it doesn't backup to the same directory, it needs to store some logs or temporary data somewhere on it.\nApart from the fact that having your root filesystem full is a bigger issue that needs solving first, I'll suggest a generic idea for finding out where it writes to.\n\n\n*\n\n*Free up some space on your root filesystem. Find logfiles under /var/log that might have grown too large and haven't been modified in the last, say 3 days:\nfind /var/log -xdev -mtime +3\n\n*Move them elsewhere outside of your root fs or compress them (gzip/bzip2)\n\n*Set deja dup to back up a small directory\n\n*Create a file in /tmp: touch /tmp/tstamp\n\n*Run deja-dup\n\n*Find files which it modifies with find / -xdev -newer /tmp/tstamp\nIf it's the temporary files it needs to created on your root filesystem somewhere, you'll probably need to run the last find command during the execution of your backup.\nOtherwise, if it's just the logfiles, you could probably find them after you run your backup. But ultimately, you need to free up space on your root FS.\nDo you have separate partitions for /home, /tmp, etc.?\n\nA: This is a problem with Deja, since the UI does not allow for changing the tempdir.\nIf e.g. you want to use tmpfs you probably have to invoke duplicity manually via:\nduplicity --no-encryption --gio --tempdir /var/tmp /home/<username> file:///<yourbackupdir>\n\nSee https://bugs.launchpad.net/deja-dup/+bug/872233/comments/6\n", "Q: Problems updating system with apt-get After trying apt-get update and apt-get upgrade I have the following error message:\nThis is a coppy of my terminal (in spanish)\nroot@LinuxJGP:/home/javiergp# apt-get upgrade\nLeyendo lista de paquetes...

I've heard that Nvidia has released new drivers few days ago and I don't know which they are. I tried installing them with .run file but I can't.\n\nA: I recommend first activating the Proposed, Restricted, Multiverse, Universe and all other repositories. It should look something like this (Open software sources first to activate them. Them do a sudo apt-get update):\n\nAfter you update and reboot (If an update asks you to) you should see the Nvidia drivers like this:\n\nAnd that's when I come in ^^ to explain the 5 types of options:\nThere are 3 types of Nvidia versions:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Open Source Nouveau which runs by default if no other Proprietary driver is installed.\n\n*The Proprietary driver (Tested)\n\n*The Proprietary driver (Experimental)\nDepending if \"you feel lucky punk!\" you can go with Nouveau which works well in most cases but is not recommended if you want to start testing out Windows Games with Wine or Ubuntu games that use extensive OpenGL.\nYou then have the Tested Proprietary drivers (Right now is the 304.xx versions). This will work stable and give you considerable more FPS for your card than Nouveau. The Nvidia update you mention on your question might be the 304.64 which comes with many Linux fixes.\nLastly you have the Experimental Proprietary drivers (Right now the 310.xx versions). This will work good in most cases (Using them right now and they work perfectly). There was another update to the 310.xx series, the 310.14 which brings a considerably higher performance. You should feel the change when playing L4D2 or see it with unity on how fast Dash and other Compiz features react.\nUPDATE: The latest drivers are the 313.xx series which have a huge boost in performance compared to the others mentioned here.\nDepending on which one you want, you can go with Open Source Nouveau, Proprietary Tested one or the Experimental one. Note only that both Proprietary are more recommended for latest Nvidia cards (Series 6000 and above). Nouveau is more general in that regards.\nAnother good question would be: But why so many options now?\nThis is because there is good moves right now between Valve, Canonical and Nvidia (Mainly them if you have followed the trends, news and others Canonical sites) for bringing Games to Linux (The right way). What this means right now is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu will be handling faster Nvidia driver updates. hence we start to see the Experimental versions of Nvidia in the Additional Drivers tab, this were once found only on the X-Swat PPA.\n\n*More work being done with Compiz and Unity (Much more than before)\n\n*Steam Beta tests that will help find and solve even faster some of the Problems with games and Ubuntu that we face today. This also includes much help from the Steam community and Valve developers (Apart from obvious Canonical developers).\n\n*Much more contribution between this 3 companies in regards to offering a better performance, stability and game deployment for Linux, starting with Ubuntu.\n\nA: There are two distinctly different drivers to choose from here, open source and proprietary.  The open source driver is being provided by the community and the source code is available for download, inspection, modification, etc.  Some users would prefer to keep their system as open source as possible, and they may be more apt to choose the open source driver.  However, the open source driver may not fully support all features and functionalities your video card is able to provide.  For me, using the open source driver results in my inability to use dual monitors properly.  Your results may vary.\nThe proprietary drivers are developed by nVidia.  Generally speaking, they will support the full functionality of the card; however, since the driver is not open source, if there are issues, the community may not be able to determine the cause of any problem.\nMost people would probably say you should use the tested proprietary driver (the first one on your screen shot) to get the best results.  This has been tested outside of nVidia to verify its functionality.  The third driver listed is the most current official stable release from nVidia, but it hasn't been formally tested by others to verify its functionality - it's probably safe though.  Additionally, the 304 driver (the last one on your screen shot) has been found to be generally pretty stable and provide a decent performance boost.  You would want that driver if you plan on using the Steam for Linux beta.  \nIf you don't feel the need to live on the bleeding edge and don't plan on doing any gaming, the first or third driver on your list are probably the best bets.  Oh, and you aren't bound by any of these choices.  You can change your mind or try different ones out to find the one that gives you the best results.  Just go back to Additional Drivers in System Settings later if you change your mind.  Just an FYI, you will sometimes have to deactivate the current driver first to be able to activate a new driver.\n", "Q: Windows' Time gets reset when using wubi installer?

Everything is working fine till now, but I noticed an strange issue:\nEverytime I boot Ubuntu and later use windows the system time gets set to 11:54 of the current day.  \nPlease could anyone tell me whats the issue?\n\nA: That's been happening a long time - not sure the exact reason but I suspect that ubiquity always assumes the computer clock is UTC and then it corrects it to local time. But if you connect your Wubi install to the internet it will pick up the correct time. Also, make sure your Windows is also connected to a time server... or, for example, you'll find like I did that whoever sets daylight savings first affects the other and get dropped back 2 hours.\n", "Q: Is Juju deploy data accessible on the instances?

As your question alludes to, services can have multiple units. For current implementations of juju, one unit does mean one instance, but at some point instances will be split up with multiple service units on them.\nTo answer your question more directly, yes, the unit name is accessible as\n$JUJU_UNIT_NAME\n\nFrom the documentation:\n\nJUJU_UNIT_NAME\nThe name of the local unit being executed.\nJUJU_UNIT_NAME=vanilla/0\n\n\n(source)\n", "Q: Finding out if Ubuntu supports a specific laptop? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I know if a laptop will work with Ubuntu? \n\nAccording to How to install hardware drivers for my laptop, the answer supplied by NorTicUs says:\n\n\"If your hardware as open drivers for Ubuntu, they will be install with Ubuntu. If there is driver from HP, you can find them into your Setting->Additional drivers.\nThis is Jockey, and it will let you know which drivers are available for your hardware. Just select which one you want and click Install.\"\n\nBut what if you do not already own the system, and you want to find out before you buy?\n\nA: Check out sites like linlap.com to see if any specific model works with Linux.  They seem to have more info than the more official compatibility lists.\n\nA: Google is your friend in this case. Simply run a Google search for something like \"[your laptop model] Ubuntu compatibility\" and you will generally find the information you need.\nThat said, here are a few general things to know:\n\n\n*\n\n*A large number of new Dell computers are Ubuntu certified (and, from what I understand, nearly all of them have actually been tested with Ubuntu, as they ship it almost exclusively outside of the US). This means Ubuntu has been tested to run on them and will work (usually out of the box). So, if the computer you're getting is a Dell, then you shouldn't need to worry about the hardware in general (though, unfortunately, if you live in the US, you can't get a machine with Ubuntu pre-installed on it; thank you, marketing department). Ubuntu's certified page also lists that several HP and IBM models are certified as well. Even if you can't get the exact models, matching specs/hardware should also perform equally well.\n\n*Most computers will be supported at least on a basic level. Usually the hangups occur with network cards (specifically, the wireless card), and graphics cards. Both nVidia and ATI/AMD have fairly good support for most cards on the market. The biggest issue I've seen is with cutting edge ATI/AMD cards, due to the lag in the open source driver development. nVidia supplies their own proprietary driver, which usually avoids the issue the ATI cards have.\n\n*Intel laptops ship with a feature called Optimus. It's a power saving feature that allows the computer to switch between the descrete and shared video, depending on the current needs of the computer. By default, this is known to cause issues with Ubuntu, but there are two ways to deal with it - install Bumblebee, or go into your BIOS settings and disable Optimus. \n\nA: There is a list that the Ubuntu Team complied it has all the Hardware OEMs and the desktops(and laptops) they put through certification.\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/certification/desktop/\n\nA: You should probably ask the employees at the store what the specs are, then look up \"Ubuntu driver \" Most of the time, you'll find a page that says \"Ubuntu supports  out of the box, but a proprietary, non-open-source driver can be found here.\"\nUbuntu actually has a great collection of built-in drivers, so it shouldn't be too much of a concern whether it has the necessary drivers, but I'd recommend just asking the employees what the hardware is. (e.g., my computer is a Pentium 4 with dual logical processors @300GHz and 3 Gig of RAM. :)\n", "Q: Gnome-classic lock screen no password prompt I have ubuntu 12.04, on a Dell Inspiron 14r, Intel HD 3000.\nI set on the Power settings, \"When the lid is closed: Do nothing.\" \nThe password prompt worked just fine when i closed and opened the lid.\nBut now after i have updated the Intel graphics driver, most of the times, when i open the laptop lid, there's no password prompt.

Once you're able to ssh bar without having to explicitly log into \"foo\" first, sshfs should work transparently (and it does, I just tested it).\nTo accomplish this, add stuff like this to .ssh/config:\nHost bar\n   ProxyCommand ssh foo nc -q0 %h %p\n\n", "Q: How can I capture text from a specific terminal and redirect it to a log file while simultaneously working? I viewed this question to redirect text to file while displaying the output.

So I need constant and immediate redirecting of commands and their outputs (with errors) to a file (say cmdlog.log).\n\nA: The script command can do this, it starts a session and all output is by default captured into a file called typescript.  Alternatively, one can specify the filename to contain the captured session, e.g.\nscript capture.txt\n\n..then run your commands and finally type \"exit\" to exit the session.\nTo ensure you don't get any control characters, use:\nTERM=dump\nscript capture.txt\n\nand when you exit, use:\ncol -b < capture.txt > cleaned-capture.txt\n\n", "Q: Ugly lock screen in Xubuntu when I lock my screen, I don't get the nice login dialog which is present after my laptop reboot.

I hate them. I want only to lock my computer while I go to bathroom or for a lunch. I want my login screen.\n\n\nA: Xscreensaver is a package which is an extensible screen saver framework, and locks the computer.\nAccording to this linuxfromscratch.org page.\n\nThe XScreenSaver is a modular screen saver and locker for the X Window\n  System. It is highly customizable and allows the use of any program\n  that can draw on the root window as a display mode. The purpose of\n  XScreenSaver is to display pretty pictures on your screen when it is\n  not in use, in keeping with the philosophy that unattended monitors\n  should always be doing something interesting, just like they do in the\n  movies. However, XScreenSaver can also be used as a screen locker, to\n  prevent others from using your terminal while you are away.\n\nI don't know the reason why it is used in Lubuntu and Xubuntu, but it might be because of the its popularity, stability, and probably it is light weight. \nIt also reduces the burden of building a new package to replace already existing software.\n\nA: Do you like black? Try slock, it's the best example of the KISS principle.\nTo install it: sudo apt-get install suckless-tools\nThen, the easiest way to configure it in xubuntu is: sudo apt-get remove xscreensaver\nThis is because by default xscreensaver takes precedence over other screensavers, slock among them. Once removed, you can either kill the xscreensaver thread already running in background or just restart.\nEnjoy simplicity.\n\nA: Remove xscreensaver and install gnome-screensaver which has a more polished look:\nsudo apt-get remove xscreensaver\nsudo apt-get install gnome-screensaver\n\nYou can also set a shortcut to lock the screen with the keyboard:\nStart > Settings Manager > Keyboard > Application Shortcuts > Add\nCommand: xflock4\nShortCut: <Super>l   ; (e.g. press the \"Windows key\" + l) \n\nNOTE: The only potential downside to this is that gnome-screensaver will pull the gnome dependencies which in a very minimalistic desktop might not already be present.

Now I would like to make it a dual boot with a new install (12.10) on the SSD and the old installation on my old HDD. In a few months, I will pull out the old HDD and put it in a new box for my kids. But until then it should be able to boot into the old version.\nWhat's the best way to do this? I have tried something similair a few years back but that gave me a lot problems. Each update/upgrade gave problems with the boot loader and I had to change things manually after which it start working again. I'm trying to prevent that this time.\nMy own thought would be to remove my old drive, put in the SSD, install Ubuntu from CD. After the installation is completed, I plug in my old HDD and run update-grub.\nIs that the best way to do it?\n\nA: Typically, booting an OS on another architecture/different hardware setup is not recommended. Once you install your OS on your SSD and plug in your HDD, grubupdate should add your other drive as a boot option.\n", "Q: Razer naga & ubuntu 12.10 Are there any configurators with profiles for the Razer naga mouse? I've found this link, but I don't know how to install it.\n\nA: Sadly, other than that, there is no configurator for Razer devices (other than one that is now quite a bit outdated), and according to Razer, they have no plans to port their Synapse to Linux.\nAs for installing Razercfg, all the instructions are in the README file, but I guess I can summarize it for you:\nThe following is required in order to install:\n\n*\n\n*Python 2.5 or 2.6 (should be installed by default)\n\n*libusb (1.0<)\n\n*QT4 Python Bindings (python-qt4 in the Debian/Ubuntu repos)\n\n*CMake  (2.4<) (cmake in the Debian/Ubuntu repos)\n\nExtract the archive, then, in terminal, move to the directory you just extracted. Next, type cmake, then make. After that, you will want to switch to root (sudo su) and then type make install.\nAgain I'll say it: all of this is in the README file that comes with razercfg. It's not terribly difficult to follow the instructions in it, but just in case it is, this guide should be a bit easier to follow.\n\nA: Thats odd. My mouse seems to switch from the number row to the key pad just fine when I flip the switch. Btw that razer config tool isn't really outdated. Just looks like the dev isn't constantly working on the tool all the time. Sometimes going for a year without an update, but still updating none the less. The last update bing in October last year doesn't seem to old. \nI think the only thing that isn't saving form windows is my dpi settings. I haven't been running this config tool for a while. My death adder just stored the setting internally. My naga doesn't seem to do this. Ill get back to this once I try it out.\nRazer's new cloud config software kind of sucks if you ask me. \n", "Q: Software Compliance I am new to this and all linux distributions.\nAfter installing Ubuntu 12.04 and getting all the updates, I then ran a software scan on this machine.\nIt came up with over 250 applications.  \nAre all of these “free” in terms of license use?\nAre all distributions of linux licensed for free to use?\nIf I want to run a software security audit on my linux machines, do I need to bother or is there a legal document stating that all apps and software on this linux machine is legal to use?\nJust trying to understand this whole linux world that I am slowing coming into.\nAny info would help.\nThanks\n\nA: First, what do you mean by \"ran a software scan\"? And why would a \"software security audit\" have anything to do with whether the software is legal?\n\nAre all of these “free” in terms of license use?\n\nAnything you install from the Software Center on a default installation (that is, you haven't done anything to modify where Software Center looks for software), is legal to use, yes (in Ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10, some software isn't necessarily monetarily free, but those are labelled as such). The same goes for Yum, Zypper, and the other package managers for the other distributions, since they have to comply with certain standards (either legal, or self-imposed) for distributing software bundled with the operating system or turned on by default in the package manager.\nWhere things get more hairy is when you start downloading software from the Internet. In that case, it's just like any other platform. Not only is the licensing going to depend on the software, but its legality is going to depend on where you get it. For example, a bootleg copy of Halo is still a bootlegged copy of Halo, but getting the latest version of Gimp or Chrome from their respective websites is perfectly legal, as is installing a legitimate copy of Halo. \n\nAre all distributions of linux licensed for free to use?\n\nTechnically speaking, no, because it's likely there are versions of Linux out there that are under more restrictive licenses. This is the nature of the ubiquity that Linux actually enjoys (which most people don't realize), and the wording of the common licenses (which often allow you to build off an open source item and redistribute your new work under a more restrictive license). It's very likely that the version of Linux used as a base for Motorola's cable modems, or Cisco's routers, are under a more restrictive license model, making it not legally free to use.\nThat said, for typical desktop purposes, the Linux distributions you're likely to find and use will be free to use, in both the \"free as in freedom\" and \"free as in beer\" senses. However, if you have any doubts, you can always look up what license the distribution is released under and read the terms of the license itself. Most are released under the GNU GPL (or LGPL), MIT, Creative Commons, or Apache licenses, or some variation thereof, so those would be a good place to start.\nAdditionally, the Linux kernel itself (the core that all Linux distributions are built from; it's what makes them all \"Linux\"), is open source and free to use. Specifically, it's distributed under the GNU GPL version 2.\n\nIf I want to run a software security audit on my linux machines, do I need to bother or is there a legal document stating that all apps and software on this linux machine is legal to use?\n\nYou're not going to find a single legal document stating what you want. However, as I mentioned earlier, most Open Source software is licensed under one of the aforementioned licenses. Feel free to read them, but generally speaking, they all allow you to use them for personal and commercial use. Additionally, any software title will come with either a EULA (which usually means it's closed sourced or otherwise restricted) and/or a license, either of which will state the terms under which you're allowed to use the software. When in doubt, read the license that ships with the title in question.\nIf you're planning on letting other people use your computer(s) and allow them to install software (especially if you're looking for enterprise/business use), then it would still be a good idea to occasionally run audits to ensure that all of the software installed is legal. If you're just using it for home purposes, then there's not really any need.\nFor more information on open source software in general, you might want to check out the Free Software Foundation.\n", "Q: sudo aptitude full-upgrade = 420 conflicts I think the following will explain my concern for not wanting to choose Y.\noshirowanen@desktop:~$ sudo aptitude full-upgrade\nThe following NEW packages will be installed:\n  libavcodec53{a} libavutil51{a} \nThe following packages will be upgraded:\n  libavdevice53 libavformat53 libpostproc52 libproxy1 libproxy1:i386 libproxy1-plugin-gsettings libproxy1-plugin-networkmanager \n  libswscale2 python-libproxy \n9 packages upgraded, 2 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.\nNeed to get 3,804 kB of archives.

I have an LCD monitor that has built-in speakers which I use as my default monitor.  I also have an LCD TV which I use as a second monitor sometimes to watch shows from the couch.  \nBoth are hooked up to my graphics card via HDMI cables.  I can get the displays to go into Twinview via NVidia X Server Settings, but I can't figure out how to get the audio to switch from the monitor speakers to the TV speakers. \nThere is no audio section in the NVidia settings, and the sound section in System Settings can only see my default monitor apparently.\n\nA: Nevermind.  I've figured out a way to do it.  If I switch to Twinview, then disable my default monitor, the TV becomes the only monitor, and thus the default, and the sound automatically switches to it.\n", "Q: Steam: error while loading shared libraries: libGL.so.1: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64 After Nvidia driver installation when I try to run Steam I am getting this error:\nsteam: error while loading shared libraries: libGL.so.1: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64\n\nI found this question and one of the answers that suggest installing:\nsudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-glx:i386\n\nI have already installed libgl1-mesa-glx:i386. Than I found this. It suggests making a symlink to 32bit libGL. How can do that? Do you have any other suggestions?\n\nA: Fixed this in raring ringtail (xubuntu 13.04) with nVidia 319.17 drivers by adding /usr/lib32 to a new file:\n$ sudo nano /etc/ld.so.conf.d/lib32.conf\n\nthen running:\n$ sudo ldconfig \n\nSince the file /etc/ld.so.conf contains include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf, any file in that directory with the extension .conf gets parsed.\n\nA: From: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/321\nI got the same issue and solved it by doing this:\n$ cd ~/.steam/bin\n$ ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/mesa/libGL.so.1 .\n\nThis worked for me as well.\n\nA: I ran into the same problem, but with skype. All the solutions above (creating symlinks, configuring LD_LIBRARY_PATH) didn't work for me.\nI finally found help in the post already mentioned above - but with a different solution.\nIt seems that the nvidia updater (when asking for permission to install OpenGL 32-bit compatibility libraries) messed up and removed /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/mesa/libGL.so.1 and /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/mesa/libGL.so.\nReinstalling the libgl1 library did help:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libgl1-mesa-glx:i386\n\nA: Fixed this for Mint 14 with the newest 64 bit Nvidia drivers 310.32 with the 32bit driver support installed in  \n/emul/ia32-linux/usr/lib \n\nby adding\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/emul/ia32-linux/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH \n\nAfter the first \"export\" in the beginning of the /usr/bin/steam file.\n\nA: This problem on 64-bits systems is caused by /usr/lib being earlier in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH than /usr/lib32. Steam tries the 64-bit libraries and complains, without looking any further.\nIt can be fixed however by in ~/Steam/steam.sh but that file seems to be restored to the original version every time steam is ran.\nI fixed it by creating a script that does this:\n#!/bin/bash\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib32:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\nsteam $*\n\nThis prepends /usr/lib32 to the library path, then starts steam (with the script's original arguments).\nNow /usr/lib32 is found in the path before /usr/lib, and steam will successfully use the 32-bit libraries.\nYou may also want to add the line \nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib32:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n\nto /usr/bin/steam, it will have the same effect, as long as you add it before the very last line. You'll need to sudo to edit /usr/lib/steam.\n\n\n*\n\n*This has the added bonus that it's a better fix, since everything that starts steam (the application menu entry, file type associations, URI associations) will work correctly.\n\n*The disadvantage is that /usr/bin/steam is likely to be overwritten when steam is updated.\n\n\nI use the latter method, while keeping the script as a backup. That way, if /usr/bin/steam gets overwritten, I can simply copy paste the line again from the script to fix it.\n\nA: If you're using Steam for Linux limited beta, I would post that on the Steam for Linux forums. They should have better help, and if it's a problem with the software itself, the developers will be able to fix it. Also, if you're using a 64-bit OS, there are plenty of people there that have probably gone through the troubles you have, and, therefore, know exactly what to do.\n\nA: I had exactly same issue on Linux Mint Debian Edition 2 64-bit.\nI resolved it by re-installing NVIDIA drivers with the 32-bit GL libraries (after installing those libraries steam requested).\nI just assume that installing those other 32-bit graphics libraries broke some linking, and reinstalling NVIDIA drivers with those real 32-bit libraries fixes the linking problem.\n\nA: I had this problem with Skype. I fixed it by installing official Nvidia driver again and install 32 bit compatibility library during installation.\n", "Q: LibreOffice Base menu disappears I just installed LibreOffice Base on my 64 bit Ubuntu 12.10 machine.

Go in to the Preferences and switch the Output Module to Pulseaudio audio output.\nQuit VLC & relaunch.\nHope it helps!\n\nA: For me 3 things (Easier than other options I could try) worked. You could either:\n\n*\n\n*Change the Sound Preferences in VLC by going to Tools --> Preferences --> Sound and changing the Default from one option to another. For example Alsa to Pulseaudio or  Pulseaudio to Alsa are the most common ones.\n\n\n\n*Try pausing the movie for 2 to 5 seconds, then unpause it. The sound should come immediately of after 1 or 2 seconds without the horrible static.\n\n\n*If you are using HDMI or outputting it to a TV/Monitor with Speakers and already checked all the Sound settings in your TV or Monitor, try changing the Sound Preferences in Ubuntu:\n\n\nA: Solution #23 worked for me for 2 computers for skype and vlc that made problems with sound: pulseAudioBugWebSite\nThe solution is to change the lines in /etc/pulse/default.pa. I've changed this line:\nload-module module-udev-detect\n\nto this:\nload-module module-udev-detect tsched=0\n\nreboot. It worked for me!\n\nA: None of the Module changes made anything better. Some made it worse. What finally fixed it for me was just unselecting \"Enable Time Stretching Audio\":\nTools > Preferences > Audio > Enable Time Stretching Audio (uncheck)\nThis was checked by default (I know because I uninstalled and reinstalled and also reset preferences), so I don't know when it became a problem, but everything checks out now.

I know this isn't a great solution, but since LTS is -- well -- long-term, you could always keep a 12.04 running in a virtual box until needed.\nTo the other part of your question, I've looked too and can't find anything else that actually works in terms of editing PDF content, and not just shuffling/adding/deleting pages.\n\nA: As mentioned above, Qt3 is still supported in 12.04 LTS. However both Qt4 and Qt3 are capable of coexisting together on the same machine, therefore I suggest reloading the Qt3 libraries from the archive instead of trying to convert pdfedit to use qt4 libraries.\nI've tested the following commands on 12.10, and they work as of this post. If not, you might need to check the archive as see if the version name/link has changed...\nOn 32 bit systems use this:\nInstall Qt3 library (libqt3-mt) from 12.04 LTS:\nFILE=`mktemp`; wget http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/q/qt-x11-free/libqt3-mt_3.3.8-b-8ubuntu3_i386.deb -qO $FILE && sudo dpkg -i $FILE; rm $FILE\n\nInstall pdfedit:\nFILE=`mktemp`; wget http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/p/pdfedit/pdfedit_0.4.5-2_i386.deb -qO $FILE && sudo dpkg -i $FILE; rm $FILE\n\nFor 64 bit versions use the following commands:\nInstall Qt3 library (libqt3-mt) from 12.04 LTS:\nFILE=`mktemp`; wget http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/q/qt-x11-free/libqt3-mt_3.3.8-b-8ubuntu3_amd64.deb -qO $FILE && sudo dpkg -i $FILE; rm $FILE\n\nInstall pdfedit:\nFILE=`mktemp`; wget http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/p/pdfedit/pdfedit_0.4.5-2_amd64.deb -qO $FILE && sudo dpkg -i $FILE; rm $FILE\n\n\nA: You can download the source code from SourceForge or find old packages online, but the installation or buildconfigure cannot continue due to a dependency on Qt3. \nOne would have to port it to Qt4. Since this this tool is not one of many, I don't understand why it still relies on Qt3.\nMeanwhile I am looking for alternatives. No luck.\n\nA: I can confirm that jsncttn's solution works, I tried it too. One caveat is the first time I ran the first command, it could not install libqt3-mt but this failed because of missing dependencies:\nlibxcursor1:i386 (1:1.1.13-1),\nlibxfixes3:i386 (1:5.0-4ubuntu5),\nlibxft2:i386 (2.3.1-1),\nlibxinerama1:i386 (2:1.1.2-1),\nlibxrandr2:i386 (2:1.4.0-1)\nI made a note of them and launched Synaptic Package Manager to see if they were there and install them, and since somehow they were detected as \"broken packages\" by Synaptic I selected to fix the broken packages, reran the first command to install libqt3-mt, then the second command to install PDFEdit, and it installed fine.  When Ubuntu 12.04 was released libqt3-mt was still in Debian Testing (Wheezy), but was removed from Debian Testing in late May 2012, so my best guess it that's why it got dropped from Ubuntu 12.10.  Oddly enough is in Debian sid so maybe it will get into Ubuntu.\nqt3 removed from Debian May 2012:\nhttp://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2012/11/#qt3\nA project to backport qt3 back to Debian Wheezy/Sid:\nhttp://projects.tryphon.eu/blog/2012/10/12/qt3-backport-for-debian-wheezy-and-sid/\nCurrently since libqt3-mt is (back?) in sid .... I don't know if that means it might make it to be included in Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring).\n\nA: None of the above worked on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.  Well, at least not on my system.  I ended up with broken packages and an app that didn't run.\nHowever, I came across a script that does work and used it.  Perfect installation.  No broken packages.  And, it also worked on Ubuntu running in WSL on Windows 10.\nGot it from here:  https://gist.github.com/bmaupin/a23161b50f27179e6e5b064d6066b034\n", "Q: Set \"older\" kernel as default grub entry I installed a mainline kernel for testing purposes. I would like to set grub to boot from the older kernel by default.\nI know I can set the GRUB_DEFAULT=0 setting for the first page of grub but how do I set it to boot by default from one kernel in the second page (Advanced page)?\nI would prefer doing this without installing other software (ex. grub-customizer).\n\nRelated Questions:\nHow do I set Windows to boot as the default in the boot loader?\nHow do I change the grub boot order? \n\n\nA: The best solution for me was to set (in /etc/default/grub):\n GRUB_DEFAULT=saved\n GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true\n\nWith this settings the last selected value is kept for the next boot.\nIf you have a new kernel you don't have to edit your config.\nDon't forget to re-run sudo update-grub\nThe solution is from reading: info grub-mkconfig\n\nA: Now that an Advanced menu is default in Ubuntu, you'll need to select it before the kernel you want using the > character.\nSet e.g.:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=\"1>7\"\n\nin /etc/default/grub and re-run sudo update-grub.\nIt is important to note that for the GRUB menu entries numbering starts with 0. Therefore the 1 above points to the Advanced menu. As a precaution, you may want to initially set GRUB_TIMEOUT=5. Some may be unable to access GRUB by hitting a key at boot time. This is a safety net in case you accidentally point to something like Memory test instead. It is also necessary to include the above numbers in quotes. It will not work otherwise.\nI tested on 16.04 LTS.\n\nA: When I have initially posted this I haven't noticed the OP's specific requirement not to propose grub-customizer... Sorry.\nFor what it's worth I'll leave it here but also confirm that the best solution is indeed the most up-voted one HERE, with variables that can be found as indicated in THIS complementary answer.\n\nIn order to do it with a GUI, I use Grub Customizer (I'm in Mint but that doesn't count here).\nThe simplest and most direct way (thanks @eMKi for the suggestion in comment) — best suited for a permanent setting, in General Settings > default entry > predifined, simply select the desired kernel in the drop-down list.\n\n\nOr, in case one needs the \"previous booted entry\" to be the one selected (might be useful in dual boot with Windows when doing an Windows update that requires restart, for example) — keeping the Advanced options in the grub list in case the default list is changed within Grub Customizer:\n\nunder General settings select the default entry: previous booted entry.\n\nThen, reboot, and during boot select the \"Advanced options\" entry in the grub list:\n\nand select the older kernel\n\nOn the next reboot, the \"Advanced options\" item will be the one selected by default in the grub list and the last selected kernel from under there will be booted (without opening the full list of kernels).\nIn case Windows is used, or other option in the grub list, remember to re-do the previous procedure.\n\nA: To be able to set which boot option to use as default you need to know what there is... so:\nTo display the menu entries without actually booting, try something like:\n\n$ lsb_release -s -rdc\nUbuntu 16.04.4 LTS\n16.04\nxenial\n\n$ update-grub --version\ngrub-mkconfig (GRUB) 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.17\n\n$ grep -Ei 'submenu|menuentry ' /boot/grub/grub.cfg | sed -re \"s/(.? )'([^']+)'.*/\\1 \\2/\"\nmenuentry  Ubuntu\nsubmenu  Advanced options for Ubuntu\n    menuentry  Ubuntu, with Linux 4.4.0-34-generic\n    menuentry  Ubuntu, with Linux 4.4.0-34-generic (upstart)\n    menuentry  Ubuntu, with Linux 4.4.0-34-generic (recovery mode)\nmenuentry  System setup\n\n\n\nA: First, make a backup copy of /etc/default/grub. If something goes wrong, you can easily revert to the known-good copy.\nsudo cp /etc/default/grub /etc/default/grub.bak\n\nThen edit the file using the text editor of your choice (e.g. gedit, etc.).\nsudo -H gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nFind the line that contains GRUB_DEFAULT - this is what you'll want to edit to set the default. You must know the full name of the kernel you want - e.g. Ubuntu, with Linux 3.13.0-53-generic - along with the full name of the \"advanced menu\" - e.g. Advanced options for Ubuntu.\nYou then combine those two strings with > and set GRUB_DEFAULT to them as: GRUB_DEFAULT=\"Advanced options for Ubuntu>Ubuntu, with Linux 3.13.0-53-generic\" (including quotes).\nSave it, then build the updated grub menu.\nsudo update-grub\n\nSee also: GNU GRUB Manual 2.02 or more specifically section 15.1.0 on setting the default.\n\nNote: There is a method utilizing numbers to access kernels and menus but this is not recommended as it is unreliable when kernel updates occur.\n\nA: In order to change the default kernel to load you can set kernel boot priority in /etc/default/grub file.\nFirst\nTake a backup of /etc/default/grub before making any changes.\nWhile booting if you don't see Grub boot loader at all, you have to make it visible, for that change these 2 lines in Grub as\nGRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=menu\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=10\n\nNow while loading you should be able to see the grub menu.\nTo change the kernel loading priority you have to make a change in GRUB_DEFAULT as the default setting it is set as\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\n\ncheck the serial number of the kernel that you want to set as default, the numbering is 0 indexed, change the index accordingly. eg if you want to load the 6th entry from the top, you have to set the index as 5.\nGRUB_DEFAULT=5\n\nNow update grub using sudo update-grub and restart.\nCheck this YouTube video to make grub visible.\nCheck this Ubuntu help page to know about GRUB_DEFAULT.\n", "Q: ubuntu 12.04 wpa key length only 63 characters if I choose personal wpa my ubuntu 12.04 wifi gui apparently accepts a maximum of 63 characters only instead of the standard 64, which makes it impossible to connect to 64 character protected nets, while enterprise pwa gui shows no such limitation - what can I do? thanks roberto\nMaybe my question was not so clearly formulated as I hoped.\nWhat I mean is when I want to connect to a specific wifi net from OpenSUSE I am given a 64 character field tagged \"password\" where I can type the 64 hex digit string - 0 to 9 and a to f - that I got from the administrator and I get connected.\nWhen I try to connect from Ubuntu I only get a field 63 character long to type in. The string last digit is truncated and I can't get connected.\n\nA: The network manager will accept 63 ascii characters or 64 hex characters.

Just found out about lvm and installed a fresh 12.4 alternate without touching my old and seperate /home folder (encrypted I'm sure, although accessible now with root privileges) on another SSD. \nI encrypted the (new) /home during install. I am looking to combine the two /home folders and set up existing swap partition that lies on the old /home drive (as I removed the standard swap during install due to a lack of space on the root drive).\nCan I do both actions with the lvm program?\n\nA: Ubuntu use eCryptfs to encrypt /home.\nThe new /home and old home could be using different ciphers, keys and options. I don't think it is possible to merge the 2 logical volumes.\nAnyway, you can do it manually by mounting the old home and use rsync to copy all files over to the new /home (data will be encrypted again using the ecryptfs options on the new /home), you can keep using the swap file on the old /home anyway, just edit the /etc/fstab\nMore on eCryptfs\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/ecryptfs.html\n", "Q: Cannot connect wireless internet with 12.10 on Dell Inspiron 1525 I have just installed Ubuntu 12.10 on my Dell Inspiron 1525 laptop.

I've reinstalled Ubuntu now, and now if I hit escape at the end of the BIOS/POST startup screen, it takes me to GRUB menu. Otherwise it automatically loads Windows. It seems like GRUB is now the acting bootloader, it just doesn't automatically start that unless I ask it to open a bootloader. In my other machines, it has always automatically started at the end of BIOS/POST.\nEDIT2: Using gparted, I just looked at my partitions, it would seem that my linux-swap partition is currently flagged as the boot partition for my Ubuntu install. I currently only have 2 partitions: one of \"ext4\" with a mount point of \"/\" and flag \" \"; and the \"linux-swap\" with mount point \" \" and flag \"boot.\" \nIf I change the boot flag to be on \"/,\" it does not reliably solve the problem. After 10 boots: \n\n\n*\n\n*2 Booted successfully to GRUB\n\n*5 Booted directly to Windows 7\n\n*3 booted to the black screen with the cursor and hung there\n\n\nFurther research makes me think this is an issue of the BIOS not reliably booting hard drives in the same order or not finding both hard drives. If I ask it to create a \"boot menu\" sometimes it has 2 entries for \"Internal HDD,\" sometimes 1. Also the list it creates changes order every time I bring it up; so it is not following a consistent boot sequence. Will report back if this is not an issue with GRUB.\nEDIT3: After changing the 'boot flags' about a bit, I have found a pattern. This machine actually has 3 hard drives, 2 SATA 750GB ('sda' and 'sdb') and a 128GB SSD ('sdc'). When I boot, I think it is loading from a different one of them each time in this order: 'sda' (Windows loads with no boot loader), 'sdc' (black screen with cursor), then 'sdb' (GRUB loads and I can choose to load windows or Ubuntu). I think the problem is trying to tell the BIOS to reliably choose a partition to boot from; not in the way Ubuntu installed.\n\nA: After changing the 'boot flags' about a bit, I have found a pattern.

This file is needed to ensure the package is uninstalled cleanly, and removing it could potentially leave traces of the package remaining, leave the system configured in a way that expects the package to be installed, or leave services provided by the package running, even once the files are removed.\nThat makes this technique safer, though potentially it might not work if there is also a problem running the .prerm script. (This may have been why owl said to delete it.) Fortunately, usually the .prerm script does not fail.\n\n*This technique potentially removes more configuration files, so depending on the cause of the problem, this might be more effective.\nIt also makes sure we are fetching the correct version of the package to install.\nRun:\nsudo dpkg -P php5-mysql\nsudo apt-get --purge autoremove\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install php5-mysql\n\nIf there are no errors, then everything is cleaned up from the previous installation and php5-mysql is installed.

Have tried sudo + Apache2 integration methods.  http:///wws and http:///static-sympa still experiences permissions problems.\nSeeking an Ubuntu-specific procedure tailored to the 'sympa' package.  Have yet to find anything.  Suspect I'm not executing procedure properly and/or missing some \"small\" setp.\nAlternatively:  seeking means to simply \"sanity check\" the installation by granting apache2 (www-data) process \"all/unsecure\" rights to access anything, simply to ensure I've got everything installed properly.  Then I can dial back to proper/secure permissions.\nThoughts?\n\nA: Addendum: Further in my installation trials I realize that this answer has been incomplete, so I'll edit it. The solution below solves the permission problems with the files in /static-sympa. But you'll probably run in further problems down the line, because the config snippet in /etc/apache2/conf.d/sympa is really incomplete. You can replace the whole contents of this file by the version shown at Debian Wiki. There you also find instructions how to create the necessary wrapper at /var/www/sympa/wwsympa.fcgi. With this, Sympa itself and the web interface WWSympa should be working.\n\nI realize this question is a bit older, but I just run into a similar problem. Maybe the solution I found can help others. \nThe Sympa package in Ubuntu seems to be a bit bungled, to say the least. One of the problems is that it tells Apache where to find its stuff, but doesn't give it permission to go there ;)\n/static-sympa is an Alias that is defined in /etc/apache2/conf.d/sympa, along with the ScriptAlias for /wws. The actual location for the files that are aliase'd to static-sympa is /var/lib/sympa/static_content. That, of course, is miles away from any DocumentRoot Apache knows about. And Apache is wary about integrating stuff from \"outside\", unless you explicitely tell it it's ok. So the default is, \"you no touching anything there\", i. e. \"403 - Forbidden\".\nTo give Apache the needed permission, you can just extend the configuration snippet, /etc/apache2/conf.d/sympa. Below the existing Alias and ScriptAlias definition, you can do something along the lines of\n# For anything below the (URL) location /static-sympa\n<Location /static-sympa>\n    Order allow,deny # order of permissions: First handle 'allows', then 'denys'\n    Allow from All # allow access to anybody\n</Location>\n\n", "Q: I can't upgrade to 12.10 Quantal Quetzal After hearing about some of the features in 12.10, I decided to upgrade my Ubuntu from 12.04 LTS to the newer 12.10.

Is there a solution to allow for regex matching of paths for this parameter?\n\nA: No, regular expressions aren't supported by deja-dup and there is no workaround currently.  You'll need to specify the folders explicitly.\n\nA: While it doesn't support regular expressions, you can exclude specific folders by adding a .deja-dup-ignore file in the folder. Here is a script which will go and add this file to any matching folders, defined below as 'ignoreFolder'. Customize as needed. Note that the example below is ignoring 'node_modules' folders, but it won't go deeper than the first parent node_modules folder it finds in any hierarchy (ie. it won't add it recursively under their child dependencies, because it doesn't need to). The mindepth/maxdepth there is only to speed up the find, but feel free to remove.\n\nTo customize:\n-change startPath to the folder you want the script to run from (ie. /home/rw3iss/Sites)\n-change ignoreFolder to the folder pattern you want ignored (ie. node_modules')\n-if you don't need it to ignore sub-dependency directories, just remove the '-not -regex \".$ignoreFolder.$ignoreFolder.*\"' bit.\nstartPath=/home/rw3iss/Sites\nignoreFolder=node_modules\n\nfind $startPath -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 5 -name \"$ignoreFolder\" -type d -not -regex \".*$ignoreFolder.*$ignoreFolder.*\" | while read fname; do\n  echo \"\" > \"$fname/.deja-dup-ignore\"\n  echo \"$fname/.deja-dup-ignore created.\"\ndone\n\n\nGist: https://gist.github.com/rw3iss/1db5d19a85470f2646ee2a1da1cf9fc5\n", "Q: Mounted disk suddenly became readonly While running Ubuntu, sometimes my disks suddenly become read-only, and any write attempt on it result in error: Read-only file system, but mount -l shows that disk as rw.\nAfter restarting, some failures are detected in disk and fsck fix the problem, but after a while all of this happens again.

I'm trying to decide if I need a different computer instead.\n\nA: A crash suggests a bug in libparted that's interacting with some sort of problem with the partition table. Try downloading and running the Boot Info Script and then post a link to the RESULTS.txt file that it produces. That will provide more information. You could also try running gdisk on the disk. (This will require installing the gdisk package -- but it's not readily installable from the Ubuntu live CD, so you might need to install manually or run a live CD like Parted Magic, which includes gdisk.) Type v at the gdisk main menu; this performs a verification operation that may return clues if there's something obvious wrong with the partition table.\n", "Q: Card Reader Read Speed Is Slow BACKGROUND INFO: My hard drive recently failed and I haven't had the money/time to replace it. I tried a Live version of Ubuntu from a thumb drive and decided I liked it, so in the meantime I've decided to install 12.04 to a SD card and run it from there. I've spent about a week working on drivers, customization, and basic exploration, scouring Google for answers and learning from my mistakes, but a couple of items I could not find any good information on so I've decided to suck it up and ask.\nPROBLEM(s): I started out installing to a microSD card (within an adapter) simply because I had one, but it was running quite slow. I purchased an Ultra SDHC card (16 GB) because it boasted a 30 MB/s read speed and installed Ubuntu 12.04 to it. This sped things up a bit. However, I'm still getting only ~20 Mb/s read speed maximum, and 11 Mb/s read speed on average. Is this typical for these media readers? I've tried benchmarking the drive on Ubuntu 12.10 as well, and also while running the OS from a LiveUSB drive (so the card reader wasn't in use during testing). These all had similar results. Is this typical of these card readers or the cards themselves? I have no way of testing the drive in Windows or in any other setting. Could this be a driver issue? \nAlso, my computer seems to dislike booting from the card reader. It will boot from it just fine (I'm running Ubuntu from it right now), but no matter how many times I update the BIOS it seems to forget about the card reader altogether, so I have to always boot using the boot options menu. About 1/4 of the time, the reader won't even show up, though a quick restart and return to boot options always resolves the issue. This is regardless of the fact that there is literally nothing else to boot from.  \nLastly, the computer will not fully wake up from sleep. You can hear it start up, but the screen remains blank no matter how long I wait. This happens every time I allow to go into sleep mode (as opposed to only some of the time). It has never awoken from sleep. \nBelow, I hope, is any information you might need:\nPer the Gateway support page for my laptop, the card reader is an RTS5117. It is not listed on Realtek's website under products (though they do list an RTS5116). \nRunning lsusb in the terminal, the device identifies as: \nBus 001 Device 004: ID 0bda:0158 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. USB 2.0 multicard reader\nDisk utility displays the drive with the following info: \"Generic Multicard Reader\", Firmware Version: 1.0, Device: /dev/sda , Connection: USB at 480.0 Mb/s\nThe laptop is a Gateway T-1625. Here are the motherboard specifications, where it shows the card reader model. I would provide more links but I've hit the link limit. \nThe card I'm using is the 16GB SanDisk Ultra SDHC Class 10 Memory card. On the website it is item # SDSDU-016G. (I've hit the link limit or I would provide one.)\nThis is the Windows Vista driver recommended by Gateway, in case that can provide any information.\nI'm aware that I grouped a few problems into one thread, but I thought that they may be related. If they are not I can update the post accordingly. My main problem is the read/write speed of the card reader. The booting is only an annoyance and I can disable sleep if needed. \nThanks for your help. If you need any additional information just ask and I will update my post. \n\nA: I think this is about what I would expect. The class 10 does mention the number 30, but keep in mind that this is sales-speak: it means \"Up to 30MB/s read speed\".\nIf you look at the specs of what \"class 10\" means1 you get:\n\nClass 10 is more than or equal to 10 MB/sec performance \n\nIt also mentions this little gem of information \n\nNote that the unit of performance [MB/sec] indicates 1000x1000 [Byte/sec] while the unit of data size \n  [MB] indicates 1024x1024 [Byte]. This is because the maximum SD  Bus speed is specified by the \n  maximum SD clock frequency (25 [MB/sec] = 25000000 [Byte/sec] at 50 MHz) and data size is based \n  on memory boundary (power of 2).\n\nSo we also have the 1000 vs 1024 \"gap\".\n1: page 5 of this pdf\n", "Q: Midnight Commander is showing some weird characters I have no idea why this happens, how do i fix it ?\n\n\nA: A little more information would be nice.

In any application in Unity, the main menu for the application that has focus gives the options of 'file', 'edit', 'view', 'go', bookmarks', 'help', etc. - just like windows does. While this makes sense for anyone who's used a computer for years, it is not very intuitive - especially the first two (file and edit).\nI'd like to know if the options in this menu can be re-organised.\nFor example, 'File' should perhaps be renamed to 'Application', because the sub-menu items like 'New folder' (in Nautilus) and 'Quit' affect the entire application. 'Preferences' and 'About' should be in that menu too by this logic. The 'Edit' menu could be renamed 'File', and have all options that affect whatever item is selected (or whichever tab or document view is opened) in the application, such as 'Copy', 'Paste', and 'Print'. The 'Properties' item should be in that menu as well.\n\nA: The application menu just displays an application's menu, it doesn't generate the menu itself. \nThere's no real way to do what you want other than modifying the menus in each application.\n", "Q: Menu doesn't work in libreoffice 3.6 Translated (using Google Translate): I have a problem with Libreoffice and menu bar.

As far as I know, the last command you would normally run is this one: show listing of last logged in users (from its man-page). \nAre you checking last reboot ?

It won't tell you which filesystem is being written but it will give you some processes to investigate.\nsudo apt-get install iotop\nsudo iotop\n\nIt shows instantaneous disk reads and writes and the name of the command reading or writing.\nIf you are trying to catch a process that writes infrequently, you can use the --accumulate option or log the output to a file:\nsudo -i\niotop --batch > iotop_log_file\n\nObviously the writing of the log file will show up in the results, but you should also be able to grep for other processes writing to disk.\nBy this point you should be able to find some candidate suspect processes. The left column in iotop shows the pid. Next, find out which file descriptor the process is writing to:\nsudo -i\nstrace -p <pid> 2>&1 | grep write\n\nYou should see output like this when the process writes:\nwrite(1, \"\\n\", 1)                       = 1\nwrite(4, \"test\\n\", 5)                   = 5\nwrite(1, \">>> \", 4)                     = 4\n\nThe first argument to write is the file descriptor. We are probably looking for values greater than 2, because 0, 1 and 2 are just stdin, stdout and stderr. File descriptor 4 looks interesting.\nYou can now find out what file the file descriptor points to with:\nlsof -p <pid>\n\nWhich should yield output like:\n...\npython  23908  rob  mem    REG    8,1    26258 8392656 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gconv/gconv-modules.cache\npython  23908  rob    0u   CHR  136,5      0t0       8 /dev/pts/5\npython  23908  rob    1u   CHR  136,5      0t0       8 /dev/pts/5\npython  23908  rob    2u   CHR  136,5      0t0       8 /dev/pts/5\npython  23908  rob    3w   REG   0,25      909 9049082 /home/rob/testfile\npython  23908  rob    4w   REG   0,25       20 9049087 /home/rob/another_test_file\n\nLook at the 4th column. 4w means that file descriptor 4 is open for writing and the file is another_test_file.\nIt is possible for a process to open, write and then close a file, in which case lsof would not show it. You might catch this happening with:\nstrace -p <pid> 2>&1 | grep open\n\n", "Q: Valve's Steam on Ubuntu 12.04 x64 I've tried installing Steam from Valve's website , although I had a persistent error when trying to start steam:\nInstalling breakpad exception handler for appid(steam)/version(1352224866_client)\n\nI've so far tried the another askubuntu.com solved question with installing ia32-libs, although this didn't work.

In this case, the target filesystem is Armel so it's not compatible.\n\nA: I found this page which explains exactly what I was trying to do to chroot into the target filesystem: \nhttp://www.omappedia.com/wiki/OMAP_Ubuntu_Core#Chroot.27ing_into_the_Ubuntu_Core_Filesystem\nIt's then a simple case of running adduser ubuntu or similar.\nCopied in case it goes dead:\nChroot'ing into the Ubuntu Core Filesystem\nOne solution to customize your Ubuntu Core Filesystem is to do it from the Linux PC. Using a 'chroot' is sometimes quite convinient as you can run commands as you normally do on the ARM target. Here are some quick steps to get running:\nChroot configuration on the Linux PC\nVerify that on your Linux PC you have the 'qemu-user-static' Ubuntu package installed. This can be done with the following command line (on your Linux PC):\ndpkg -l qemu-user-static\n\nHave your SD Card mounted on your Linux PC and go to your rootfs Ubuntu Core folder, generally:\ncd /media/rootfs\n\nCopy the qemu for arm file:\ncp /usr/bin/qemu-arm-static usr/bin/\n\nIf not done yet, have your network settings properly configured:\nmv etc/resolv.conf etc/resolv.conf.saved\ncp /etc/resolv.conf etc/resolv.conf\n\nThen, mount sys, proc and dev:\nfor m in `echo 'sys dev proc'`; do sudo mount /$m ./$m -o bind; done\n\nFinally, chroot into your target filesystem:\nsudo LC_ALL=C chroot . /bin/bash\n\nYou are now in your 'chroot' which means you can run commands like if you were on your target ARM device.\nUsing the 'chroot'\nThe first step is to verify the network connection is fine. You can run:\napt-get update\n\nYou are now ready to install any new package in your Ubuntu Core Filesystem using APT tools.\nGetting out of the 'chroot'\nUn-mount the target filesystem:\nMake sure your at the / target FS and run the following commands:\nfor m in `echo 'sys dev proc'`; do sudo umount ./$m; done\n\nGo back to your original network settings:\nmv etc/resolv.conf.saved etc/resolv.conf\n\n\nA: Perhaps, this will work (apart from your workaround: mounting the new filesystem it in an ARMEL system):\nbefore doing chroot, do mount --bind the directories conntaining architecture-dependent binaries from your host system onto the corresponding pats in the new filesystem (/bin/, /sbin/, /lib/ -- perhaps this will suffice for adding a user; or /usr/* as well, if not), then chroot and run the commands. /etc/, /home/, and /var/ from the new filesystem will be modified.\n", "Q: User Account Disabled After Upgrade to 12.04.1 LTS I upgraded from 10.xxx to 12.04.1 LTS using the upgrade feature within Ubuntu.

If you can log in there, it's not the account that's broken, but the graphical interface. You'll also be able to see any error messages that your login produces.\nIf you can login, then you need to find out why your graphical interface doesn't work.

I want to dualboot Ubuntu - Windows.\nI can easily access LiveUSB with both UEFI enabled and disabled. I heard that there were problems with UEFI, so I disabled it. After I've installed the system I couldn't access it. It just boots to Windows straight.\nAnother unusual thing, that never happened to me before was that the partition editor wanted me to create a BIOS reserved area, which I did, but not at the beginning of the table.\nAny ideas how to access the Ubuntu partition?\nAs far as I can guess both Windows and Ubuntu have to be both of the same type of boot, either Legacy or EFI. This is not the case of what I have now. So, if I reinstall Ubuntu in UEFI mode that correlates with my Windows type, will I then be able to boot into it?\nI have a constraint, my laptop doesn't have a CD ROM, so I cannot reinstall WIndows, nor can I move around the Windows recovery partition.\nThis is the boot-repair report :\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/1354254/\nSOLUTION\nI've enabled UEFI in BIOS, and reinstalled Ubuntu with UEFI enabled. It works fine now, although if I select Windows from the GRUB menu, it doesn't work. But I can live with that, since I can just select Windows boot from the BIOS instead.\n\nA: It sounds like Windows was installed in EFI mode. (Evidence: You refer to a \"BIOS reserved area,\" by which I believe you mean a BIOS Boot Partition, which is valid only on GPT disks. Since Windows will boot from a GPT disk only in EFI mode, Windows must be installed in EFI mode. This analysis could be incorrect if I'm misinterpreting what you mean by a \"BIOS reserved area,\" though.) A BIOS Boot Partition in Linux means that Linux is booting in BIOS/legacy mode. The two, as you've correctly inferred, are awkward to switch between on most systems.\nThere are several possible solutions. This list is not exhaustive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use your firmware's boot manager -- All modern systems offer a built-in boot manager, usually accessed by hitting F8, F10, F12, or some other key at boot time. It pops up and gives you boot options. On most UEFI systems, those options include both BIOS/legacy and UEFI boot options. Thus, you can select your OS by using this feature. Some UEFI implementations, though, provide such a poor built-in boot manager that this isn't a practical option, or it may not work at all.\n\n*Install a Linux EFI boot loader -- Ubuntu uses an EFI version of GRUB 2 for this, in the grub-efi package. Installation will be tricky, though; unless you're booted in EFI mode, installation will be incomplete, so you'll need to use an EFI-booted emergency system to do the installation. There are other EFI boot loaders available; see this page of mine for details. (IMHO, GRUB 2 is the worst of them, so alternatives are worth investigating.)\n\n*Use rEFInd -- The rEFInd program, which I maintain, is an EFI boot manager that can launch an EFI boot loader or (on many, but not all, UEFI systems) a BIOS-mode boot loader. You can install rEFInd from Windows and then try editing its refind.conf file to add hdbios to its scanfor line. If this works, you'll then get a rEFInd boot menu that shows Windows and a generic option. The generic option will boot your BIOS-mode GRUB. If you installed Ubuntu 12.10 or if you're comfortable compiling your own kernel, you can use rEFInd to boot Linux in EFI mode, too; rEFInd is one of those alternative EFI boot programs noted in the previous option. You'll almost certainly need to adjust the configuration a bit to boot Ubuntu in EFI mode from rEFInd, given your current setup. See rEFInd's documentation page on booting Linux for details.\n\n*Reinstall Ubuntu -- You can wipe your Ubuntu installation and re-install it in EFI mode. This is the easiest option to describe, and it may be the easiest to do; but you'll learn the least doing it. It's also not guaranteed to work; EFI-mode installation still has quirks and pitfalls, many of them system-specific.\n\n*Revert to BIOS -- You can wipe the hard disk of all data and re-install both OSes in BIOS mode. This is probably more effort than it's worth, and the Windows media you can create from files on your Windows installation may not even support it.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*So, if I reinstall Ubuntu in UEFI mode that correlates with my Windows type, will I then be able to boot into it?\n\n\nYes (with little additional operations).\nHere is how to do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Setup your BIOS to boot in UEFI mode\n\n*From a Ubuntu disk, use Gparted to delete the Ubuntu partitions\n\n*Run the Ubuntu installer to \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows\". It will install Ubuntu in UEFI mode.\n\n*Reboot the pc, it will show a GRUB menu with valid Ubuntu entries, but invalid Windows entries. Now let's add a valid entry: boot into your installed Ubuntu (default line of the GRUB menu), in a terminal (or Alt+F2) type: gksudo gedit /etc/grub.d/40_custom , press Enter, type your password, press Enter again. At the bottom of the text file that will open, copy paste the paragraph below (remove the blank lines).\n\n\n\nmenuentry WindowsUEFI {\nsearch --fs-uuid --no-floppy --set=root 04B0-92AD\nchainloader (${root})/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nSave the file. Close the text editor. Then type the following in a terminal: sudo update-grub. Reboot the PC, you should now have a valid WindowsUEFI entry in the GRUB menu.\n", "Q: I cannot delete files from root's Trash I deleted some large files from nautilus launched as sudo.

Here's the issue.\nWhen I first installed W8, the Wubi loader would launch just fine, no issues, no fuss... At the time, I elected to avoid installing through Wubi, and just setting up a dedicated partition, and I think this is where I messed up.\nI installed my drivers (no OEM bloatware*), ran truecrypt, set up a dedicated partition.. Everything appeared to be fine, was still able to run my TC bootloader, I couldn't [esc] to grub yet though, I thought to myself \"okay, it's just because I haven't encrypted the system yet, but rather only installed the bootloader\".\nAfter 8 hours of encrypting, I woke up and thought \"awesome, let me reboot & check Ubuntu\", which, to my dismay, did not properly install.\nSoooo... I booted my 12.10 liveCD to try another installation, and that's when all hell broke loose. Ubuntu refused to identify any partitions within the installer. Gparted threw an error about my hdd when I launched it, showed me 3 partitions, 2 of which were \"Unknown\" thanks to TrueCrypt, and the one where I attempted to install Ubuntu. The Ubuntu partition was labeled \"Extended\".\nBeing too scared to screw around with the partitions, or make any changes to the table, I booted into Windows 8 (YES! Still worked!), attempted to run Wubi, and I got the dreaded error where it refuses to run. I checked my Environment Variables, no python path.. Okay... So I checked my startup folder.. Still there... Check the temp folder for a Wubi log file.. NOPE!\nBasically, I have several issues, and each one is only compounded by the next. Any help with this situation can make my day vastly better.\nSystem Specs:\nThinkpad Edge e535,\nAMD APU A4-4300m,\n4GB ram,\nWindows 8,\nUEFI (THE DEVIL!!!)\nand, well, that's about it.\n*OEM BLOATWARE: I don't ever install OEM software, and seeing as it's a Thinkpad, I related it to they Python issue, but that's not the case.\n**Side note: I did a side-by-side installation with Win8 from the Ubuntu installer AFTER I installed the Truecrypt bootloader, and before I encrypted my drive.\n***EDIT: I have Secure Boot disabled with UEFI, and I have it set to UEFI+Legacy booting mode.\n**EDIT2: I don't care about encrypting Ubuntu, I only want my windows partition encrypted. My priority is dual-boot.\n\nA: Okay. I solved this. I'm going to start from the basics.\nI found how to simultaneously dual boot Windows 8 (Truecrypt encrypted) & Ubuntu 12.10 (home folder encrypted) while keeping secure boot enabled!!\nUEFI/BIOS:\nConfiguration:\nCheck all settings, confirm that USB is set to secure boot.\nBoot settings: Enable UEFI/Legacy, with legacy booting first.\nSave & Exit.\nInstall Windows 8, once installed, restart.\nInstall Ubuntu using the \"Install alongside Windows 8\" setting in the installer.\nInstall Gparted (or your favorite partition manager)\nShrink the Windows 8 partition by 250mb AFTER the data layer.\nMake Ext4 filesystem on 250mb partition.

And when you boot a Wubi install or from a live CD you are bypassing the drive MBR which holds the truecrypt bootloader. \nSo what you are seeing is the expected behaviour.\nIf you browse the truecrypt forums you'll see that other people have suggested methods of using dual boot, but it doesn't appear to be supported out of the box by truecrypt. Although some people have posted workarounds, I haven't seen any for Wubi which uses grub4dos to boot.\n", "Q: No root account Okay, here's my problem.  I was being an idiot and installed compiz-core on my Xubuntu 12.10.  So there I was, trying to figure out how to fix my issue, and I did sudo xfwm4 --replace.\nThen I was unable to login.  So I logging with guest, delete my old account, without deleting the home folder, of course, and I create a new account \"michael2\".  Instead of creating a new home folder for it, I instead instructed the program to use my old home folder.  Unfortunately, it completely erased the folder, along with over 150GB worth of downloads and about 200 hours worth of work (I work from home, so, yeah).\nAnd to top it all off, whenever I try to use the sudo command, I get the error \n\nmichael2 is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.\n\nI don't know how to fix this, nor can I login to root (I never set the root password, because I never had the need to login as root to do anything).\nAny help will be appreciated.  Is there maybe a way that I can do system restore to restore my previous files and username?  I need answers as soon as possible, because I'm literally losing money by the second (the entire work from home kinda thing).\n\nA: To regain root access, you will need to boot in recovery mode. When you reach GRUB, select an entry labeled \"(...) Recovery mode\".\nAfter some time you should get a screen similar to this one, when you should select \"Drop to root shell prompt\"\n\nThen you will be in a shell as root, and can add your used to the sudo group again:\nusermod -a -G adm <your_username>\nusermod -a -G sudo <your_username>\n\nAfter reboot, you should have again sudo permissions. If that's not the case, repeat the procedure but use visudo to add yourself to the sudoers file.\n\nA: You'll need to use the Ubuntu installer in rescue mode to mount your root partition and edit the sudoers file to add your new user account.\n", "Q: grub-probe: error: cannot find a GRUB drive for /dev/sda1 I'm trying to add windows 7 for my new 12.10 grub bootloader.\nNone of the things worked out; such as .. copying bootx64.efi methods, I'm getting this output: \ngrub-probe --target=fs_uuid /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n\ngrub-probe: error: cannot find a GRUB drive for /dev/sda1.

Assuming your ESP is mounted there, you should have a file called /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi. (Note that the case can vary after /boot/efi, since that's a FAT filesystem, which is case-insensitive.) If that file is missing, try widening the search on /boot/efi; typing find /boot/efi -iname \"*.efi\". This will show you all the EFI boot loaders and other programs on the ESP.\nIf the bootmgfw.efi file is present but is in a strange location, try moving it. If it's not present, you'll need to run Microsoft's recovery tools to get it back. They may tinker with your boot loader boot order, though, necessitating booting a Linux emergency disc and fixing things with efibootmgr.\nIf bootmgfw.efi is present and is where it should be, try grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg. This will generate a fresh GRUB configuration file with your 40_custom entry. (That entry obviates the need to probe for your Windows installation.)\nIf that fails or if you don't like the result, you can supplement or ditch GRUB. I recommend rEFInd (disclaimer: I maintain it). rEFInd has the advantage of auto-probing for available boot loaders at boot time, so it should auto-detect both Windows and GRUB. Since you're using Ubuntu 12.10, rEFInd can even boot Ubuntu without the help of GRUB, although that requires some extra configuration, as described on rEFInd's Linux booting page.\n", "Q: How to make a Portable Server for ubuntu? I want my server to be portable so it will be available everywhere when I plug it in to other ubuntu computers.\nLike I want to use it at school, I will just have to run a script and the server runs.

Like the distribution of lampp, but I want that portable.\nIs it possible to make lighttpd server portable too?\n\nA: Sure; you can either specify an amount of extra space on the thumb drive to use as persistent storage when you create a drive using usb-creator normally, or, if you prefer, you can install Ubuntu directly to the thumbdrive as though it were a normal hard drive.  Boot from the thumbdrive, and you're running your \"portable server\".\n\nA: Before you start off, use Ubuntu's x86(32-bit image), as this will allow you to use both 32-bit and 64-bit machines. Yes, a 32-bit of the server is also available, just take look at the Alternative Downloads page.\nAlso, I use Lili because its easy and I use Windows for setting up Ubuntu. You can use any other application, although for Method 2, you need an application which allows you to create Persistent Storage.\nFor method 1, you need another thumb drive(hereon referred to as Thumb drive 2), where you can use a software like LiLi to get that thumb drive bootable to install Linux.(I will also be calling the pendrive which you want to install the portable Ubuntu server version as Thumb Drive 1)\nFor method 2, you require only one thumb drive(Thumb Drive 1)\nMethod 1 - \nIt seems easy(just kidding no not that much).\n\n\n*\n\n*Make thumb drive 2 a bootable Ubuntu installer(eg Using LiLi).(Or, you can even use a CD, and, you need a PC anyways to start off)\n\n*Install Ubuntu onto Thumb Drive 1, by booting into Thumb Drive 2, so that Thumb drive 1 will now have a fully functional copy of Ubuntu server(You might want to configure it immediately, as the option to install a LAMP server is shown during the installation of Ubuntu Server).\n\n*Boot into Thumb Drive 1, and configure the server as per your wish.\n\n\nMethod 2 - \n\n\n*\n\n*Using a software that installs a Live Image onto Thumb Drive 1 (I prefer Lili, again), use Persistence to allow for storing of data.\n\n*Boot into Thumb Drive 1, and configure it.\n\n\nI personally prefer Method 1, as that way, drivers are installable easily, although rarely, it might not boot properly on certain machines(Not sure about this one, might happen between different chipsets, that is, if you switch between Intel and AMD) . \nVarious Links - \n\n\n*\n\n*How to install a LAMP Server\n\n*Download Lili (Windows)\n\n*Ubuntu Images - Alternative Downloads\n", "Q: Is there a version of the Chromium browser that will run on Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy) Looking for a version of the Chromium-browser that will run on Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy).\nThere must be one since I'm using Google Chrome 12.0.742.60 beta on that machine now but I've been unable to locate any.

Next to that Google Chrome 12.0.742.60 beta is not Chromium. Google chrome is the actual version Google released. But even Chrome was released for 8.10+ only. \nYou could check synaptic for the package.

Per crontab man page:\n\nEach  user  can  have their    own    crontab,    and    though\n  these    are    files   in /var/spool/cron/crontabs,  they are not\n  intended to be edited directly.\n\nFiles under /var/spool are considered temporary/working, that's why they probably get deleted during an upgrade, though a closer look at the cron package's upgrade scripts may shed some light on this.\nAnyway, it's always a good practice to back up your cron entries or keep them in a file in your home directory.\nI assume you're using crontab -e to create crontab files on the fly. If so, you can get a \"copy\" of your crontab file by doing crontab -l. Pipe that to a file to get a \"backup\":\ncrontab -l > my-crontab\n\nThen you can edit that my-crontab file to add or modify entries, and then \"install\" it by giving it to crontab:\ncrontab my-crontab\n\nThis does the same syntax checking as crontab -e.\n\nA: I finally found out why my crontabs and Postfix installation kept breaking after boot.

In doing so, I blindly mounted /tmp, /var/tmp and /var/spool as tmpfs without thinking of the repercussions. I thought /var/spool was like /proc/ or /run/ and that it was only useful for the duration of the session.

Im using xubuntu because I'm having problems finding anything with Unity. The system seems to recognize the HDMI audio and I can select it in the audio settings. I see the green bar moving when im playing sound but no sound seems to reach my TV. Here are some screenshots of the settings and a pastebin from the aplay -L command:\nhttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/699329/sound2.png to sound5.png\n(there are pictures up to sound5.png but I cant post that many hyperlinks\nhttp://pastebin.com/Z2WQcyAb\nI also found a setting in bios where you could chose SPDIF or HDMI for digital audio and I have chosen HDMI.

I don't know of a way of enabling it without that driver.\n", "Q: swap area provided during installation then converted it to ntfs, any problem? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs it safe to turn swap off permanently? \n\nIn my PC there is two OS, windows7 and Ubuntu . I installed Ubuntu after the installation of Windows 7. During installation i provided one windows partition as swap area. After the completion of installation I changed the swap area in to ntfs using windows. now i use ubuntu without swap area. any problem......\n\nA: Swap partition considerations\nSwap area is necessary only to supplement RAM. Simplifying a bit: When your computer is running short of Ram it uses Swap as virtual RAM.\nIn my experience, Ubuntu uses very little RAM when compared to other OS's. SO if you have, say 4 Gb of RAM, it is unlikely you'll ever need it unless you run programs that require a lot of RAM (photo and video editing are examples).\nIn any case it is good to have a Swap area just in case. 3 to 4 Gb should be enough.\nHow to add a swap partition\nTo create a Swap partition you'll need to modify your partitions using gparted. If you want to reduce the Ubuntu partition by 4gb to make space for Swap you'll have to boot from a liveDVD or live USB because you cannot modify a partition that is mounted.\nHow to create a swap partition depends on your current partition table. You can only have 4 primary partitions. So if you do not have an extended partition (which can contain many logical partitions) and you already have 4 primary partitions, you'll have to delete one partition, create a new extended one and then recreate two new partitions or whatever is needed.\nMake sure you keep a backup of anything important on the drive, because partitioning is a low-level operation and a mistake or a power failure at the wrong moment might cause data loss.\nSo boot from a liveDVD or liveUSB Ubuntu, run gparted, reduce the Ubuntu partition by 4 Gb or so. create a new partition setting it as swap.\nUpdate Grub\nAfter you do this you might need to update grub by typing sudo update-grub in a terminal before restarting your computer.\nIf you require more specific information, specify how your disk is partitioned.\n\nA: Not sure about this but I believe that swap is also used to save what is in the RAM when you hibernate the computer, as it will last even when power is off.\nIf I'm correct you may not be able to hibernate.\n", "Q: Connect 4.1 speakers to Acer V3-571G with Ubuntu 12.10 I have the Acer Aspire V3-571G that has only 2 audio jack: 1 for headphone and 1 for microphone.\nCan I connect my Creative 4.1 speakers and have sound in all 5 channels?\nThe problem is that speakers have a double green/black wire for front/rear channel but PC has only 1 jack. Is it possible to use microphone jack to export sound instead of import?\n\nA: Some sound cards support a 2.1 setup with headphone/mic but I've only ever seen that once, on a very high-end laptop. That was also with a proprietary Windows driver. I've no idea if that would ever support Linux. 4.1 in this vein will be impossible. 4.1 will require at least three jacks.\nThe solution is simple: a cheapy 5.1 USB soundcard dongle.

I get all the time notifications in the upper right corner and as a tray icon for all kind of actions, especially downloads.\nWhat app is that in Lubuntu? (it is not notify-isd)\nIs it possible to set what notifications to see? If not, how to remove this completely?\n\n\nUpdate edit: \nRemoving notification-demon (that being it seems the culprit, as an answer suggests) involves removing some important applications:\n\nLubuntu-desktop is a metapackage I guess. But what about removing deluge and update-notifier?\nCan I add these back without getting back the notifier?? I do not want in any case to remove these two.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure that whether notifications are sent to the notifier daemon is on a program by program basis, and you would have to change that in your browser's settings (if possible). I am not 100% sure on this though. At any rate, to just remove notifications altogether:\nsudo apt-get remove notification-daemon\n\nYou can also replace Lubuntu's notification system with XFCE's, which won't queue up your notifications, like the default one does. To do that:\nsudo apt-get install xfce4-notifyd\nsudo apt-get remove notification-daemon\n\nWhen doing it this way, it shouldn't ask to remove all those extra packages, as there will still be a notification system in place. I think it will still say it is uninstalling lubuntu-desktop, but that is because it is a meta package, meaning a package of packages. It won't remove your desktop. :-)\nTo change the settings for XFCE's notification system (timeouts, position, color), run this:\nxfce4-notifyd-config\n\n", "Q: Displaying two subtitle tracks simultaneously Is there a way to display multiple subtitles at the same time? It would help a lot while learning a new language. I have some *.mkv movie with two embedded subtitles, how would I turn them both on, so that one will be on the bottom and another one on the top? Or at least a fast switch with immediate text update without rewinding back would be nice.\n\nA: mpv\nI think that the best approach is with mpv (available via sudo apt install mpv). \nI'm going to assume that all the subtitles are either built-in (as specified in the question) or in a separate, but suitably named external file (e.g. if your movie is called file1.mkv your subtitle file should be file1.srt). If not, you can specify the subtitle files explicitly by adding the options --sub-file=subtitle_file_lang_xx.src, --sub-file=subtitle_file_lang_yy.src etc. or by playing around with --sub-auto (e.g. --sub-auto=fuzzy).\nIrrespective of how they were chosen (built-in or from an external file) each set of subtitles will be in its own \"stream\" when you play the video file. The streams are assigned consecutive, integer indices (1, 2, 3...). In general, the built-in subtitles will (logically) have the earlier indices. The stream indices, their languages (if the subtitle has a specified language), and whether the subtitle comes from an external file, are displayed in the terminal when you play your file with mpv. For example, after running mpv file1.mkv:\n(+) Subs  --sid=1 --slang=eng (*) (subrip)\n    Subs  --sid=2 --slang=fra (subrip)\n    Subs  --sid=3 'file1.srt' (subrip) (external)\n\nHere the first two subtitles are built-in, with languages English (eng) and French (fra) respectively, while the third one is from an external file. The indices (sid) are 1, 2, 3. The default subtitle stream is the first one (marked with a (*)) and it's also the one that's selected (with a (+)).\nKnowing these indices, you can specify the \"main\" and secondary subtitles with the options --sid and --secondary-sid. For example, to display the English subtitles, from the previous example, as the main subtitles, and the French ones as the secondary ones, you can run (in a terminal):\nmpv --sid=1 --secondary-sid=2 file1.mkv\n\nCycling secondary subtitles with keyboard shortcuts\nBy default, there aren't any keyboard shortcuts for cycling the secondary subtitles (in the way that you can cycle the \"main\" subtitles with j and J (Shift+j)). However, you can very easily add some. \nFor example, if you add the following to your ~/.config/mpv/input.conf (or more generally, your ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/mpv/input.conf):\nCtrl+j cycle secondary-sid\nCtrl+J cycle secondary-sid down\n\nthen Ctrl+j will cycle your secondary subtitles in the same direction that j cycles the main ones (increasing subtitle stream index), and Ctrl+Shift+j will cycle them in the opposite direction J (decreasing subtitle stream index).\nVLC\nIf you prefer VLC, it also supports dual/secondary subtitles, as of the beta 4.0.0. Making it work seems to currently be a bit more fiddly than with MPV.\nFirst, you need to turn them on, overall. Go to Tools > Preferences > Subtitles/OSD > Dual Subtitles (at the very bottom) > Align and change it to anything but unset. You may also need to adjust the offset (the adjacent setting). \nWhen playing a video, you need to \"Toggle secondary subtitle control\" with the default shortcut Ctrl+Shift+V. (This means that the normal subtitle control shortcuts like v or Alt+v, for cycling between subtitles backwards and forwards, will now apply to the secondary subtitles, rather than the main subtitles. Pressing Ctrl+Shift+V again will toggle back to having these apply to the main subtitles.) Then, press v the right number of times to switch to the (secondary) subtitles that you want.\n\nA: Another tool to merge subtitles is DualSub (http://dualsub.sourceforge.net/). It works with SRT subtitles for input and output. It has many options for customization. In addition you can use it to translate subtitles to any language.\n\nA: I spent a few days googling about this topic. The short answer is that there is no way to play two subtitle tracks in a *.mkv file simultaneously, in Ubuntu.\nThere are, however:\n\n\n*\n\n*a tool to merge two subtitles from two .srt files (2srt2ass)\n\n*vlc player have an extension that allows you to play one track from .mkv file and one track from another subtitle file:\nhttp://addons.videolan.org/content/show.php?content=152364\nThe best you can do with your .mkv files is to extract one subtitle from .mkv file and put it in a separate subtitle file, so that you can take advantage of the vlc extension.\nAlternatively you can consider KMplayer for Microsoft Windows. I never tried it, because I don't have a Windows, but apparently it is what always comes out top if you google for dual subtitle players.\n\nA: Combine subtitles\nMost video players do not have the ability to play two concurrent sets of subtitles at once. But luckily it is easy enough to combine two subtitles into one file online. At http://pas-bien.net/2srt2ass/ select the Spanish subtitle file you downloaded in step one, and add it as the top subtitle, and the English subtitle file as the bottom.\nfor further help go to the link below.\n\nCourtesy: http://spanish.amandajw.com/2012/11/multiple-subtitles/\n\n\nA: The easiest option that \"simply works\", out of the box (at least, for me) is SMPlayer. In context menu, select Subtitles -> Primary and Secondary tracks: \n\nA: The best and simplest way i found is to play second subtitle with a standalone subtitle player like PenguinsSubtitlePlayer. \nHere is a demo:\n\nHope it helps.\n\nA: Also, SMPlayer can play two subtitles simultaneously. You can load subtitles via load options and then choose primary and secondary subtitles. This is my favorite since there are no keyboard shortcuts to memorize.\n\nInstallation guide from their website:\nUbuntu\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:rvm/smplayer \nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get install smplayer smplayer-themes smplayer-skins \n\nFlatpak\nsudo flatpak install smplayer*.flatpak\n\nSnap\nsudo snap install smplayer\n\n\nA: Aegisub merges and positions subtitles where you want in a single file:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:alex-p/aegisub\nsudo apt-get install aegisub\n\n.srt's (left) will pile subs on top of each other and font settings aren't conserved so be sure to save the result as an .ass/.ssa file (right).\n\nI had a similar question as OP except I wanted transcribe subtitles from a video and then translate them, combining the results into one file that would automatically play in VLC.

Search for the package name for your Ubuntu release, click on the relevant search result, click on your architecture (i386 for 32 bit and amd64 for 64-bit) and choose a mirror. Repeat for each required package.\nOnce you've saved all the .deb files, move the files over to the offline computer and install them one by one in reverse order by opening them in Ubuntu Software Centre.\nIf you look at synaptic dependencies, you'll notice that it has more dependencies than the ones I've listed. I've only listed the ones that will be missing from a typical Ubuntu 12.10 desktop install.\nHow to install a particular package on an offline computer:\nAt this point, you have Synaptic installed on both your online and offline machines.\n\n\n*\n\n*In the offline computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Synaptic.\n\n*Find the package you want to install, and tick the box. If Synaptic asks you to confirm whether you want to install dependencies as well, accept the confirmation.\n\n*Click \"File\", \"Generate package download script\".\n\n*Save the script on a USB stick.\n\n\n*Take the USB stick to an online computer running Ubuntu.

As far as I know there are only two solutions to this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keep going back to the internet connection, downloading each dependency one at a time, installing and trying again.\n\n*Just connect the computer to the internet and install the software in two minutes.

I feel absolutely limited by using Windows, and I need to switch to a Unix environment.\nI once installed Red Hat on my laptop (screen + external monitor setup; 4GB ram; x64) and it worked fine, but I saw that the computer cluster that is the birthplace of my unix knowledge switched to Ubuntu, so naturally I follow.\nTo the point. When I installed Ubuntu onto my machine via the Windows Installer, it ran quite slow. Opening Firefox takes about 8-9 seconds, it freezes up often, unable to handle its own background processes.\nI saw in a thread that, perhaps, it is running slow because the Windows Installer is installing an x64 version. Of course, my computer has had no performance issues in the past(except that time with the trojans but you know, no one is perfect ;) )\nAnyways, I uninstalled Ubuntu, freeing up the max allocated memory it took up, and continue to be sad, trapped in my MS world with only a buggy Cygwin, any assistance is greatly appreciated! :)\nThanks\n~Ben\n\nA: Wubi installs the architecture that matches the one you're running, so it should be x64.\nThat said, it's probably not the architecture that's your problem (I have no issues with x64 Ubuntu, even in virtual machines), but the fact that you installed it with Wubi. According to Wikipedia, Wubi installs Ubuntu on a loopmounted device (basically, a disk image) within the Windows partition, instead of its own partition. This means that the disk image itself is prone to fragmentation (thank you, NTFS), which will slow it down.\nThere are a few different paths you can take, depending on your circumstances, to be able to use Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wipe out Windows If you don't need your Windows partition at all, just blow it up and replace it with Ubuntu and be done with it. \n\n*Dual boot Windows and Ubuntu If you have the drive space, the Ubuntu installer can repartition your hard drive and install Ubuntu next to Windows, allowing you access to both operating systems.\n\n*Run Ubuntu in a Virtual Machine If your computer is powerful enough, and you need Windows at the same time, then this may be the way to go. Grab VMWare, VirtualBox, or your favorite Virtual Machine program (I've had the best luck with VMWare, personally, for integration purposes), and install it there. That gives you a standalone Ubuntu install, while still allowing you access to Windows without having to restart the computer.\n\n*Install Ubuntu on a USB thumb drive If you need Windows for certain things, but can't install Ubuntu on drive for whatever reason, you can create a bootable USB drive with Ubuntu installed on it. Then, you can simply plug it in, tell your machine to boot from USB, and off you go! (This actually has two added bonuses - it's as fast as your USB version, which can make it super fast; and you can run it on any computer at any time. Though you are limited by the space available on your thumb drive, so keep your install lean and get a good-sized drive.)\n\n", "Q: How to set LibreOffice to suggest corrections for UK English?

(I'm in Lubuntu.) They are all related and I guess I can post them together.\n\n\nIt is clear that the first selection of the main language is done during the installation of the OS. Then, different languages can be installed through Language Support.\nBut already here some things are unclear. Opening Language support I see this:\n\nEnglish US is the language I selected during installation and that I use for my computer. But I never installed the other English languages. \nSub-question 1: What are the English languages (UK, US, South Africa, Australia, etc) that are installed when selecting English as the main language? I guess not all are.\nI remember that spelling for UK was missing and I had to install it separately. (See this question.) French and Romanian are installed by me in Language Support. \nBut (sub-q 2): what about the other ones (German,Chinese) in the image above?\n\n\n*\n\n*I see that in Lubuntu I can select different keyboard layouts from the same language, display, select them and use them through the Keyboard Layout Handler from LXPanel and that all sort of keyboard layouts can be added for languages that are not installed. So, a certain part of the language-support (namely keyboard layouts) is installed although languages themselves (displayed language of system and programs) are not. What about spelling, thesaurus and such?  \n\n\nSub-q 3: What is the relation between language support for programs and the spelling in different languages in text editors and internet browsers? Installing languages in Language Support means installing support for system and programs in those languages and at the same time for spelling and other features in text editors?  \nBeside the English-UK spelling issue (see comment below) I was also intrigued by how keyboard support works and is set. Now I understand how to set that (see question and answer) but I would like a clear cut presentation of the way in which are related these three elements: languages installed in Language Support, Spelling/correctors  (spellcheckers, thesaurus and so forth) in text editors and internet browsers and keyboard layouts.\n\nA: There are different levels where different languages can be set\n1) Language of Lubuntu OS menu\n2) Language of keyboard input\n3) Language of application menus (browsers, LibreOffice, Skype...)\n4) Language of spell-checking in each browser and each text editor\n5) Language for regional format (date, currency)\n\nThere are different languages for each diferent level. You can install Lubuntu menu in English, Chromium browser menu in Romanian, spell-checking in Chromium in French, LibreOffice menu in English, LibreOffice spell-checking in Romanian etc.\nMay exist 5 different questions about each language setting. If you specify your question in will be possible to explain about choosing language of LibreOffice, Chromium, Firefox etc.\nSome languages are installed in the first place along with the system - based on the selected iso and/or on the settings made during installation process.\nSpell-checkers are not set at system level but are application-related (like for internet browsers and office suites) and you may need to install those separately (for example, on UK-English spell-check and thesaurus in LibreOffice, here).\n\nA: I'd like to add something.\nLinux per default is intended to be used by more then one person.\nJust imagine your computer was a shared PC at a university. The main language of your installation may be English, but Linux is capable to switch between languages quite easily.\nSo you could set a different language for each user. The french teacher, the chinese student, the guy with the German scholarship.... all of them can work on the same PC/server, because they can have a different language pack attached to their account. This is the reason behind this.\nAs English is spoken in many parts of the world and sometimes with different accents, the system takes care of this up front. Linux or Lubuntu does not know if you are American or from Scotland or New Zealand, it just installs all the different aspects of that language. I'm German and it is the same with me. Austrian and especially the Swiss accent is vastly different from German.\nAnd of course you can mix that up. I always choose to install my system in English but use a German DE_de keyboard with it. You just get more help over the internet with English error messages as with German ones, just because most users speak English and have an English installation.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 \"Turn screen off when inactive for: Never\" still turns off After a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.10, my screen still goes off after about ten minutes.  I've been to the Brightness and Lock control panel.

There is some sort of background process or settings manager that keeps resetting the screensaver, no matter what I do.\nI've found a brute-force solution. Just add a line to your crontab to turn off DPMS and the screensaver every single minute.

In Lubuntu's Language Support application I see no way of differentiating between different types of the same language (English US, UK, etc) nor between different types of keyboard layouts for the same language (standard, etc). To select a certain special keyboard layout I had to edit manually /etc/default/keyboard.\nAll that was possible by GUI when I used Xubuntu, and I think all that is available in Ubuntu proper.\nCan I do that in Lubuntu or do I have to install a new application? \n\nA: *\n\n*In order to install different languages that are to be used by the system, Lubuntu has the Ubuntu Default Language Manager.\n\nThis should be easily accessed through the Preferences>Language Support.

I always specifically mount my drives using /etc/fstab, and specify where and how it gets mounted.  The flags that are important are the dmask and fmask, and setting the uid and gid.  I am the only user, so I set the uid and gid to my user name, the dmask to 002, and the fmask to 113.\n\n*You need to set the owner of the directory where the partition is mounted, which will be remembered next time.  You can do this before mounting the drive.\n\nA: NTFS doesn't support the same right system as you are used to from EXT. For instance it has no owner and no group. The access rights in Windows are managed differently. The owner and the rights for your mounted USB drive are emulated so that you can use it in the file tree.\n", "Q: Is 12.10 ready from prime time?

For reasons not worth explaining, I cannot physically plug the computer into the network. I have another computer, a MacBook Pro running OSX, from which I can download files and port them by USB thumb drive.\nThe wifi card in the PowerBook G4 is by Broadcom. The chip is BCM4306, rev. 3. The PCI number is 14e4:4302.\nI have downloaded b43-fwcutter_015-14_powerpc.deb and dropped it into the Home folder on the Ubuntu machine. However, it will not install. When I double-click, it opens with Ubuntu SoftwareCenter, but the \"Install\" button is inactive: I can't click it. There's a message beside the inactive button saying, \"An older version of 'b43-fwcutter' is available in your normal software channels. Only install this file if you trust the origin.\" If I \"right-click\" the .deb file and open with Archive Manager, it shows me the \"DEBIAN\" and \"usr\" folders, but I'm unsure what to do from there...and fairly certain this is not the right way to do things.\nMaybe I have the wrong version of b43-fwcutter for my machine/version of Ubuntu?\nThe documentation for this problem is a mess. It refers to all sorts of out-of-date Ubuntu versions and to an array of different \"cutter\" and firmware files. Maybe I'd be able to figure this out if I were a more seasoned Ubuntu user, but I have no idea why Sofware Center won't let me do the install. I would be VERY grateful for an explanation of how to get the wifi card working on this machine again. Thank you!\n\nA: Edit: You may wish to consult the Ubuntu Wiki on this issue before reading my answer, it's at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx\nIt has a clearer solution. I have left my original answer, however please note that the wiki lays it out better than I do.\nYou have a newer version? I would try to figure out what the version for 12.04 is and download that one instead. If that IS the version, it's because the system hasn't had apt-get update run in a while - since you can't connect to the network, you may need an older version.\nYou could look into aptoncd as well - this is a way that allows a computer WITH a network connection to serve as a package repository for a computer that doesn't have one - by, say, burning the packages to CD. (There are other options.)\nIf you need to manually install a .deb file, the easiest way is with gdebi which should still be in the Software Center. Since you can't do that...see below.\nYou may also want to install synaptic so you can do some things a little more manually. gdebi, apt-get, synaptic, and Software Center all use the same package repositories but allow you to do different things - Software Center is the easiest to use. The thing is you'll need a network connection (or aptoncd on another machine, or you'll have to install the packages manually.)\nThe reason this method is frowned upon is that you're delving into the sausage factory, and if you don't know what you're doing you can end up with some serious dependency problems and broken packages.\nRight-clicking the file with archive manager is easily explained - .deb is an archive format. You could uncompress the file and try to run the contents manually...but...don't. It's not worth the trouble in most cases.\nI also suggest a USB-Ethernet adapter, or a USB wireless card with a chipset \"known to work\" out of the box - Atheros chipsets should work flawlessly. That will at least get you on the network instead of having to play sneakernet.\nUPDATE: Still reading? None of those worked? It's time to dive headlong into the sausage factory.\nOpen a terminal and type this: sudo dpkg -i b43-fwcutter015-14_powerpc.deb\nYou will most likely get warnings - hell it may not even install, it may want dependencies.\nHowever this is only HALF the problem - you still need the firmware file to have the cutter cut it. Consult the wiki for the proper firmware file for your card.\nThis is the sort of thing we steer everyone away from here - because it's the sort of thing that was automated so you wouldn't have to do it manually, because it's easy to screw up. You know those whole \"oh I spent all weekend recompiling my kernel so my graphics card would work\" stereotypes? Yeah, we're trying to avoid those.\nI really really recommend borrowing a USB-Ethernet or USB Wireless card with a non-broadcom chipset. It will be thousands of times easier.\n", "Q: How to benchmark Ubuntu server? I have Ubuntu Server 12.04 and I want to benchmark it. I found something called nbench but it's old.

The GUI terminal profile manager only allows choosing fixed width or monospace fonts by default. That means, a font with which you can see (if you definitely want it on the Terminal) whether or not the msfonts are accessible from within Ubuntu would be the Courier New.\nThey should also be available in LibreOffice, however.\nThere may be a way to force a non-monospace font to be displayed in the Terminal through altering the profile files to point to the correct font, but that's discouraged as monospace fonts are intended to make text-only formatting (f.e. ASCII drawings, character-based tables) possible.\n\nA: In LibreOffice Writer, access Tools -> Options -> Fonts\nPut a check in the Apply replacement table field. Replace some font you don't \nwant with the one you do.  Writer seems to make all new fonts available at\nthat time.\n", "Q: Command-line / Virtual terminal issue I've recently got into Ubuntu, still learning using the terminal.

Also the graphics doesn't seem to be fast, e.g. when I'm scrolling in software center. (I want to use gnome3.) So I don't think the drivers actually 'work'.\nThe drivers worked on 12.04.

Not too long ago I switched from Windows 7 to Ubuntu 12.04 (64-bit) on my laptop, which only has a AMD Dual-Core E1-1200 APU 1.4 GHz processor but 4GB RAM, in the hopes that I would get more out of my weak CPU. I wonder if I could do anything further to get more out of my hardware, so I thought maybe I could switch to Xubuntu or Lubuntu. I know for example Lubuntu is much lighter on the RAM but since I have plenty of that (relatively speaking) is there a point to switching or is it a waste of time? If it is adviced for me to switch, to which version?\nAlso, is there a big difference in CPU intensity between 32-bit and 64-bit?\nSince I am new to the world of Linux in general I'll take any advice I can get. Thanks a bunch!\n\nA: Im not really sure if the CPU is really your Problem, but its always a good idea to try some different desktop environments and look how they work out.\nThe main difference of the distros is the desktop environment and the main programms. Ubuntu itself may be a little bloated. XFCE and LXCE are both really lightweight but for sure very nice and useable. There are also much lighter ones like Flux/Openbox but you may dont like them for now.\nMy suggestion is to just try them.\nYou can easily install one of those desktop envs. on your current ubuntu.\nhttp://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/xubuntu\nhttp://wiki.lxde.org/en/Ubuntu\nOr just try there live CDs, with a little help of unetbootin you dont even have to waste actual CDs\nhave fun in the ubuntu world\n\nA: You don't need to reinstall Ubuntu, you can convert it to Lubuntu by running the following command:\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\n\nA: For using all of your 4GB RAM,you must use 64-Bit version.Normally,there isn't big difference between 32-Bit and 64-Bit.\nYour cpu isn't bad for Ubuntu 12.04 and Unity Desktop.But I advice you to use AMD/ATI's drivers.To use this driver, launch \"Software Sources\" and then open the Additional Drivers tab.Probably,this drivers will be showed in list.Click on it and activate.\nIn Lubuntu,the system is used much less memory.But Unity Environment is more useful and quickly than LXDE.\n\nAlso, with PAE, you can use all of your 4GB RAM on 32-Bit system.\n\nThanks for additional information to @jackweirdy\n", "Q: Brasero yields \"SCSI error on write(1248864, 16)\" I was using Brasero to burn a Win7 .iso for a friend (sorry, couldn't convince him to try Linux e.e) and when it was at 80% the process stopped with a \"SCSI error on write(1248864, 16)\".\nI burnt some DVDs a day or two ago and it worked perfectly, and I know for sure the error isn't caused by the .iso file.\nI'm using a DVD from a pack I bought today, they're Verbatim DVD+R, while the other day I was using DVD-R. My computer is pretty old but I changed the DVD burner a couple of years ago or so, and DVD+R are supposed to be compatible with more DVD players, so I can't guess where's the error.\nI'm using Ubuntu 12.04. Any idea will be welcome. Thank you.\nPS: And please, ask me for information in case you needed it.\n\nA: SCSI error on write(1248864, 16)\n\nThe drive refused to write a chunk of 32 kB after many other\nsuch operations have already succeeded. (Exactly 78054 write\noperations did work. That's 2.5 GB.)\nThe error message is supposed to be accompanied by some SCSI\nerror code: 3 hex Numbers and their translation to human readable \ntext.  E.g.: \n[3 0C 00] Write error\n\nWhatever, since the drive already worked on that burn job without\ncomplaining, it is clearly a hardware problem. Drive and medium\ndid not like each other any more.\nIt is not a problem of burn software (in this case libburn, where\ni am the developer) or of input data (the ISO image).\nIf this happens once in a large number of burns, then i would\ncount it as a particular bad medium.\nIf this happens often and with media from different manufacturers\nthen i would blame it on the drive. (Sometimes they go bad in\ntheir youth, sometimes they die slowly after years of service.)\n\nA: When you click on \"write on disk\" a window will pop up, then click on properties,\ndecrease the speed to its minimum and select burnProof (it will decrease the risk of failure).\nIt worked for me so good luck.\n", "Q: Manually installing ia32-libs-multiarch on Ubuntu 12.10 64bit I manually downloaded ia32-libs-multiarch from packages.ubuntu.com and the version should be compatible with the 64bit 12.10.\nFrom terminal, I get a 'package has no installation candidate. After several manual attempts with dpkg, I tried manually installing ia32-libs from HERE, but failed.\nWhat is the correct way to install ia32-libs?\n\nA: First of all, did you try installing Skype before installing the libs? I've seen a few reports that there's no need to manually install ia32-libs on Quantal (ie - 32bit applications install just fine), though I haven't confirmed that myself. If you haven't, try that first. If you have, then continue on (and, since you're new, it'd be good to read on, anyway).\nYou don't need to download packages from packages.ubuntu.com in order to install them. That site is really only there for documentation and reference purposes.\nAll you need to do is open up terminal and run:\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\nIt'll prompt you for your password.

The guest will then create its own partitions within /dev/sdb1 as its own native /dev/vda1, /dev/vda2, etc, and the host will only be able to see them via kpartx in the way you want it to.\nYou could also set up /dev/sdb1 as a block device for LVM on the host, create an LV within it, and give that to the guest as /dev/vda and partition from there.

On Ubuntu, in what kind of situations, if any, running a command as a non-root to access a file/folder or create/delete a file/folder using sudo may result in \"permission denied\"\nwhile running the same command as root user would succeed? The user is assumed to be a sudoer, of course.\nPractical example on Ubuntu 12: I've got this directory in / with root:root ownership and drwxr-xr-x permissions and I tried sudo date > file while in it as well as sudo date | tee file but got the same\n-bash: file: Permission denied\n\nin both cases. Sure enough, there're no problems if I'm root. This is quite frustrating.\n\nA: What's the command you are trying? A common mistake is sudo foo > output which doesn't run the output redirection as root because it's done by the shell. A solution to this one would be foo | sudo tee output (or sudo foo | sudo tee output if foo requires root access)\n\nA: sudo lets you run a program as another user - as root by default. \nIt's the same as if root runs that program (except maybe for some environment variables and such).

The script ran until it failed for what's look like a kernel-related problems (???).\nThanks for any help, I'm stuck there for now\nHere's the log file from the failed install:\n>nvidia-installer log file '/var/log/nvidia-installer.log'  \ncreation time: Tue Nov 13 17:28:49 2012  \ninstaller version: 1.0.7  \n\n>PATH: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin  \n\n>option status:  \n  license pre-accepted               : false  \n  update                             : false  \n  force update                       : false  \n  expert                             : false  \n  uninstall                          : false  \n  driver info                        : false  \n  precompiled interfaces             : true  \n  no ncurses color                   : false  \n  query latest version               : false  \n  OpenGL header files                : true  \n  no questions                       : false  \n  silent                             : false  \n  no recursion                       : false  \n  no backup                          : false  \n  kernel module only                 : false  \n  sanity                             : false  \n  add this kernel                    : false  \n  no runlevel check                  : false  \n  no network                         : false  \n  no ABI note                        : false  \n  no RPMs                            : false  \n  no kernel module                   : false  \n  force SELinux                      : default  \n  no X server check                  : false  \n  no cc version check                : false  \n  run distro scripts                 : true  \n  no nouveau check                   : false  \n  sigwinch work around               : true  \n  force tls                          : (not specified)  \n  X install prefix                   : (not specified)  \n  X library install path             : (not specified)  \n  X module install path              : (not specified)  \n  OpenGL install prefix              : (not specified)  \n  OpenGL install libdir              : (not specified)  \n  utility install prefix             : (not specified)  \n  utility install libdir             : (not specified)  \n  installer prefix                   : (not specified)  \n  doc install prefix                 : (not specified)  \n  kernel name                        : (not specified)  \n  kernel include path                : (not specified)  \n  kernel source path                 : (not specified)  \n  kernel output path                 : (not specified)  \n  kernel install path                : (not specified)  \n  precompiled kernel interfaces path : (not specified)  \n  precompiled kernel interfaces url  : (not specified)  \n  proc mount point                   : /proc  \n  ui                                 : (not specified)  \n  tmpdir                             : /tmp  \n  ftp mirror                         : ftp://download.nvidia.com  \n  RPM file list                      : (not specified)  \n  selinux chcon type                 : (not specified)  \n\n>Using: nvidia-installer ncurses user interface  \n-> License accepted.  \n-> Installing NVIDIA driver version 71.86.15.  \n-> Running distribution scripts  \n   executing: '/usr/lib/nvidia/pre-install'...  \n-> done.  \n-> The distribution-provided pre-install script failed!

I have Ubuntu 12.04 and also downloaded Gnome desktop.\nIs recovering from the recycle bin/rubbish bin/trash can available with Gnome or not?\nI get conflicting answers about this from Forum search and “Answers”\nSome say you can find it in “local” but I can find no local file where it should be.\nOne post says navigate to ~/.local/share/Trash/ but I cannot find “local”.\nThe only way I can find anything like this is Places>Computer>File System>usr>local>share but “share” contains no trash folder.\nIs “~” the same as user name?\nI am the only user on this pc, is that why I can't find it?\nOthers say you have to download Gnome Tweaks.\nWhat I am looking for is the same in Gnome as there is in Unity, a trash can that you can open and restore trashed items from, but I don't seem to have it in Gnome, however if it is there somewhere I would rather find it than download Gnome Tweaks.\nAlso what is the correct term? Recycle bin, rubbish bin or trashcan? On my Ubuntu 12.04 when deleting it is referred to as “the rubbish bin” but no-one else seems to call it that, is it because I opted for English Language UK rather than US?\n\nA: The location you gave is correct  ~/.local/share/Trash but the file you are looking for is hidden as signified by the .  Any file names that have a . preceding are hidden unless you force them to be shown.  \nShowing hidden files in Nautilus is done by pressing Ctrl+H \nThe ~ in the path signifies that the file is in the current users home directory it is short hand for /home/{your username}/.local/share/Trash\nSo to get to the trash files the way you were trying to do it it would be  Places>Computer>File System>home>{your username}   (then press Ctrl+H) >.local>share>Trash>files.\nHowever it is easier to Places>Home(press Ctrl+H)>.local>share>Trash>files.\nBoth of the above are still doing it the hard way.  You can open the Trash(correct name BTW) directly and then right click and select Restore and it will go back to the folder it was deleted from.  Alternatively, you can drag and drop it to any place you want as well.  If I remember correctly(could be wrong I use Unity) the Trash icon is also in Places.\nThe Trash icon can also be found in any Nautilus Window one the right hand tree menu at the bottom of the Computer section.\n", "Q: how do i stop root from running a program I would like to prevent my root user from running certain applications that can change the permissions of files which in turn prevents normal users from running those applications again.\nfor example, if i sudo to root, and then run thunderbird from the command prompt, it changes the permissions of files within my home dir / profile so i can no longer run it as a normal user; what i would like to do is prevent root from running thunderbird and hence stop this user error from repeating itself.\nany suggestions?\nto clarify, \nif i have a lot of administration to do i use \"sudo -s\" which gives me a root shell, its just once a year or so, i shoot myself in the foot.\n\nA: I believe as this is a case of stopping a bone headed user shoot them selves in the foot that there is no easy way to do this. with great power comes great responability, and it would probably be best if learnt not to use sudo -s quite so often.\nthat being said, i am going to wrap a bash script around thunderbird, that checks the user name using whoami or $SUDO_USER and then aborts if it is an administrator. its not a general solution, but it will help in this isolated case.\n\nA: I have the habit of opening an extra session for root access with sudo su - and with a conspicuous prompt. This stops me from doing stupid things with sudo.\n\nA: Open up the program's source code, find main(), add the lines\nif (geteuid() == 0) {\n    fprintf(stderr, \"Access by root is disabled.\\n\");\n    exit(255);\n}\n\nrecompile and install.\n\nA: If you have thunderbird installed locally, somewhere in your home directory then you could change the permissions to 500 so that only you can execute that program.\nRun this on the executable\nchmod 500 thunderbird\n\nAlso as TrailRider has said, don't run programs by prefixing sudo, it can be potentially dangerous. You can fix the permissions by changing the ownership of the thunderbird directory to your user name.\n", "Q: How to change the hard drive file type? I installed Ubuntu OS. Then tried to install Windows 7 as dual boot. But i get error message that unknown file system. Not NTFS. Now there is no OS in System. How to change the hard  drive file system to NTFS to install Windows 7 and then Ubuntu?\n\nA: You can do it from any installation media (ubuntu/windows 7).\nTake a backup important data using any live OS (like ubuntu). Following procedure will delete the data in your system. You can not change file system type without deleting data.\nSince you want to install windows 7 first, do the following steps..\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot using windows 7 dvd/usb.\n\n*Choose \"Custom Installation\" (not upgrade)\n\n*It will show a list of partitions available in your system. Filesystem other than FAT/NTFS will be shown as unknown file system\n\n*Below the list, there will be an option written as Advanced, click that it will open hidden options.\n\n*From here, you can delete the partitions and recreate (All data will be lost but will be fresh system), or do a format. The formatted disk will be ntfs. If formatting repeat the steps for other drives (which are not ntfs).\n\n*Now choose the first partition (or partition of your choice) where you want to install windows.\n\n", "Q: Touchpad is recognized but not working on Toshiba P855-S5312 - Ubuntu 12.10 i just made a new fresh install of ubuntu 12.10, everything works nice but the touchpad istn working, it is recognized but it is not working, here a paste bin of what i get when I type \"xinput list\".\n$ xinput list\n\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Genius Optical Mouse                      id=9    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad                id=12   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                     id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Video Bus                                 id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ TOSHIBA Web Camera - HD                   id=10   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard              id=11   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Toshiba input device                      id=13   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\n\nA: I also have the same issue with HP ProBook 4540s\nthe xinput list results:\nVirtual core pointer                            id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad                id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                         id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Video Bus                                 id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Sleep Button                              id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ HP HD Webcam [Fixed]                      id=9    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard              id=10   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ HP WMI hotkeys \n\n\nA: Solved, i dont know how, but suddenly my touchpad its working, maybe something i installed or i dont know how, 2 days ago wasnt working but know after making a playonlinux installation it started working, i also installed a windows xp virtualbox machine, maybe it was that, well thanks anyway for your help. \n", "Q: atheros ar8161 not recognized Apparently I am not the only one with this problem, this was my solution, but it did not work, of course:\nI downloaded the tar from another computer.

From since it crashes every now and then, without forewarn or malfunctions, it simply stops working.\nMy WiFi repeater is also an Ethernet switch, so both the server and WiFi are plugged in there, one physically through Ethernet, the other being integrated in the switch. Luckily I can reboot just the WiFi by pressing a button on the repeater, but since I started the server project to have all files available on any device on the network.\nWhen someone is looking at a video through a WDTV device the crash means he has to reconnect and start over, so rebooting it is not an option for me ..\nI must admit I'm more than just inexperienced with Ubuntu, so I would happily accept any suggestion.\n\nA: I have a similar setup.\nI have a Netcomm ADSL modem (connected to phone line), which has an Ethernet connection to a D-Link 4-port GigaBit WiFi router.\n\nWhat might help:\nI disabled PPPoA on the ADSL modem, and instead use PPPoE on WiFi router.\nThis is now significantly more stable, as otherwise the ADSL router reset every 4-5 hours. It would usually auto re-connect, but would disrupt downloads, email, etc.\n\nStill unsure what might be causing the WiFi issue for you.\n", "Q: How to plot xy coordinate graph in Ubuntu? I'm learning network and transportation model. I' d like to plot graph in xy coordinate from the following data:\n\nI am familiar with R and LaTeX, but I don't know is there any easy to learn and easy to control software in Ubuntu that can help me plot xy graph in xy coordinate.\nThanks!\n\nA: If you want simple, you should probably just put your data into LibreOffice Calc and have it draw a plot.\nIf you want something you can customise more and script for repeated use, there are many choices, but since you say you know R this would be the obvious choice. Some others might be python+matplotlib, octave, gnuplot, etc...\n\nA: You have grace (xmgrace) and gnuplot which are common software.\nxmgrace has got a graphical interface whereas gnuplot is a prompt where you enter some commands.\nI think xmgrace (grace is the package name) is easier than gnuplot because of the graphical interface. The only drawback of xmgrace is that you cannot plot 3D graph. \n", "Q: command 'top' what do \"3 users' mean?

You can install it using the Software Center. It is kind of hard to give step by step instructions since I don't own the game but PlayOnLinux has an easy assistant.\nFor starters: Klick Install. In the following menu you can select predefined profiles. Sadly there is none for your game so you have to do it manually. Klick Install a non-listed program in the lower left corner. Just follow the assistant. You want to create a new virtual drive. At some point it will ask you for the installer. Just enter your game disk (or whatever you have) an select the .exe file that will install the game.\nThere is no guarantee that your game will work on Ubuntu but this is the easiest way to try.\n", "Q: change firefox icons I am using ubuntu os 12.10 with faenza ambiance icon theme.\nBut with this theme , changed also firefox's icon theme . Is it possible to replace the icons with the default one ?\nHere is a screenshot of how it is now :\n\nand i want it like this (ubuntu mono dark) :\n\nIs it possible to change them ?\n\nA: The icons you have indicated are called, from left to right, go-previous.xxx, go-next.xxx, go-home.xxx and view.refresh.xxx (or document.revert.xxx) where xxx would be the image format (typically png or svg). I'm assuming the icons are named according to this. \nWhat you have to do is to locate where these icons are: at a system-wide level they would be in /usr/share/icons/name_of_icon_theme/. At the user level, they will be in ~/.icons/name_of_icon_theme if you have created such a folder. Within the particular folder, you may need to look in the subfolder called actions. Within actions, the icons maybe in /16 or /22 or /24, etc. (At least one theme has the size first and then actions as a subfolder.) For me, the icons are spread over /16 and /22.\nDepending on whether the icons you wish to replace are in /usr/share/icons or in ~/.icons you will need to use sudo. First, rename the icons you think you want to replace, then copy over the icons from the source you desire. You need to make sure they're the same size (16, 22, 24, whatever) and the same format. And ignore the ones represented by logical links.\nTo see if the changes are indeed the ones you want, you need to change to another icon theme and then back to your desired theme to effect the changes (using something like Ubuntu Tweaks or MyUnity or Gnome Tweak tool). Alternatively, you can log out and log in.\nSo long as you're systematic, nothing will go wrong and you can always revert the changes.  \nAlso, all apps that use these icons will be affected, not just Firefox!\n", "Q: VLC MSS2 codec missing I was Playing a video in VLC but it displayed the error message\nVLC does not support the audio or video format \"MSS2\"\nHow to solve this error\n\n\nA: VLC does not support MSS2 codec for now. It should be supported in release 2.1 as can be seen from the comments here https://trac.videolan.org/vlc/ticket/750. The latest version available for download for now is 2.0.4. So wait for version 2.1 or try some other player for example MPlayer which supports MSS2 codec.\n", "Q: Dual Boot (Ubuntu and Windows 7) on a RAID SSD's with UEFI I recently bought an Sony Vaio SVS13A1V9EB, which has a RAID between two 64 GB SSDs and a Hybrid-graphics.\n(Major Issue)\nI want to have Windows 7 (It is preinstalled) and Ubuntu on this notebook i.e. on the RAID Drive. In UEFI boot mode, the Ubuntu installation fails to start with both Alternate- and Live-CD, throwing an Kernel Panic error.\nDoes anyone have suggestions? \nThank you in advance!\n\nA: A kernel panic is unlikely to be caused by your partitioning. It's more likely a kernel bug or hardware incompatibility. The two easiest solutions are likely to be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Return the computer and buy something else in its place.\n\n*Switch to another distribution.\n\n\nAlso, it appears that your computer is booting in UEFI mode and using GPT, which means that there's no 4-primary-partition limit as there is with older computers that boot in BIOS mode and use MBR partitioning. Thus, there's no point to deleting those two partitions except to reclaim the space they consume, which you haven't specified as an issue.\n\nA: You will setup ubuntu live usb and you will update it kernel to newest one (MUST ANOTHER PC). then you can try install it  . it will work\n", "Q: Can't connect to wifi in ubuntu 12.10 Since upgrading to 12.10 while it was in beta, I have been unable to connect to wifi, which I was able to do while using 12.04.

Unfortunately you will need to google it\n", "Q: Add two new HDD in Raid 1 I just made a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.10 on a new SSD (/dev/sda). Now I would like to add two 1TB drives (/dev/sdb /dev/sdc) in RAID 1 but I'm pretty clueless on how to do it.\nThis is what I came up with (but didn't work):\nFirst created partitions on the new drives:\nsudo fdisk /dev/sdb\ncreated primary partition and write table to disk\nAfter that:\nsudo mdadm --create --level=1 --name=raidarray --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdb /dev/sdc\n\nHowever this outputs:\nmdadm: device /dev/sdb exists but is not an md array.\n\nCan somebody point me in the right direction on how to do this?\nOne bonus question: Would it be possible to reserve a part (same size of SSD) of one HDD  and create a RAID 1 with the SSD and part of the HDD. And if so, how and can I keep my installation?\n\nA: You have not specified the name of the resulting raid device. As such, mdadm is assuming that you're trying to create a RAID device ad /dev/sdb and then failing because /dev/sdb already exists.\nYou should modify your command:\nsudo mdadm --create --level=1 --name=raidarray /dev/md0 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdb /dev/sdc\n\n/dev/md0 is the name of the new RAID device you're going to create.\n\nA: The default command should look like this:\nmdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=1 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb2\n\nYou are not adding a complete disk, you should add a device (use /dev/sdb1 (or2), not just /dev/sdb) as far as I know. The target name (/dev/md0) was also missing.\nI always use this cheatsheet: http://www.ducea.com/2009/03/08/mdadm-cheat-sheet/  :D\n", "Q: Thinkpad X1 Carbon wakes up from sleep automatically So, I bought a Thinkpad X1 Carbon and put Ubuntu Gnome Remix 12.10 on it. I've had an issue. Sometimes, the device will resume from its sleep state automatically. This has happened both under Windows and Ubuntu. All updates applied.\nI have no idea what causes it, and the resume tends to happen some time (~1 hour) after:\na) I choose \"Suspend\" from the Gnome menu.\nb) I unplug the machine from power.\nThis has occurred twice under Windows with Automatic updates disabled.\nThis has occurred at least 4 times on Ubuntu and I cannot recognize any pattern other than each time, I had a lot running. For example, stats show\nRAM:\n3.0GB (84.6%) of 3.6GB\nSWAP:\n3.8GB (47.5%) of 7.9GB\nMy theory is that after some time, it tries to hibernate (though it is disabled and I am unable to enable it in the menus). 'pm-hibernate' allows me to lose my work when I turn on my computre.\nI have tried upgrading to Kernel 3.6.6 to see if any changes occurred, no change.\nOne peculiar note, the laptop itself blinks the 'moon light' while in sleep and documentation states that it will keep blinking as long as it is in SLEEP. This happens in Windows. In Linux, this stops after an hour or so, however, the system usually restores without issue from the sleep state.\nI apologize for the long read. How can I troubleshoot and which logs are useful? \nI have made a copy of all in /var/log/.\nThanks you very much\n\nA: In the Bios, in the category \"Power\", there is a feature called \n\nIntel (R) Rapid Start Technology\n\nWhich tries to enter a more efficient sleep state after being asleep for (by default) an hour. You could try to disable this option.\n\nA: After two months of different experiments finally found the solution!\nIn my case: I put my X1 to sleep or hibernate and at some point, I find out the laptop has started by itself!\nWhat has finally worked for me is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start Lenovo Vantage\n\n*Go to Hardware Settings\n\n*Go to Power\n\n*Turn OFF \"Smart Standby\"\n\n\nThat's it!!\nFinally can put the laptop in the bag without worrying that it will start by itself while inside :-)  \n", "Q: Unable to sign in.

The same result is met by using the network manager applet in the unity notification area to \"Enable Wireless.\"\nThis week alone I've had CentOS, openSUSE and Fedora running fully updated on my system without any wireless issues.\nAny help is appreciated.\nAdditional info:\n$ lspci | grep Broadcom\n01:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM43225 802.11b/g/n (rev 01)\n03:00.0 Ethernet controller: Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme BCM57760 Gigabit Ethernet PCIe (rev 01)\n\n$ lsmod\nModule                  Size  Used by\nrfcomm                 46619  0 \nbnep                   18140  2 \nparport_pc             32688  0 \nppdev                  17073  0 \next2                   72880  1 \nsnd_hda_codec_conexant    57842  1 \nbtusb                  18334  0 \nbluetooth             209199  11 rfcomm,bnep,btusb\narc4                   12529  2 \nbrcmsmac              531848  0 \nmac80211              539908  1 brcmsmac\nbrcmutil               14755  1 brcmsmac\ncfg80211              206566  2 brcmsmac,mac80211\ncordic                 12535  1 brcmsmac\ncoretemp               13400  0 \nkvm_intel             132759  0 \nkvm                   414070  1 kvm_intel\nacer_wmi               32453  0 \nsparse_keymap          13890  1 acer_wmi\nmicrocode              22803  0 \nsnd_hda_intel          33491  2 \nsnd_hda_codec         134212  2 snd_hda_codec_conexant,snd_hda_intel\nsnd_hwdep              13602  1 snd_hda_codec\nsnd_pcm                96580  2 snd_hda_intel,snd_hda_codec\nbcma                   35656  1 brcmsmac\nsnd_seq_midi           13324  0 \nsnd_rawmidi            30512  1 snd_seq_midi\nsnd_seq_midi_event     14899  1 snd_seq_midi\nsnd_seq                61521  2 snd_seq_midi,snd_seq_midi_event\npsmouse                95552  0 \nserio_raw              13215  0 \nlpc_ich                17061  0 \nuvcvideo               76749  0 \nvideobuf2_core         32851  1 uvcvideo\njoydev                 17457  0 \nvideodev              120309  2 uvcvideo,videobuf2_core\nvideobuf2_vmalloc      12860  1 uvcvideo\nvideobuf2_memops       13368  1 videobuf2_vmalloc\nintel_ips              18049  0 \nsnd_timer              29425  2 snd_pcm,snd_seq\nsnd_seq_device         14497  3 snd_seq_midi,snd_rawmidi,snd_seq\ni915                  520629  8 \nsnd                    78734  13 snd_hda_codec_conexant,snd_hda_intel,snd_hda_codec,snd_hwdep,snd_pcm,snd_rawmidi,snd_seq,snd_timer,snd_seq_device\ndrm_kms_helper         46784  1 i915\ndrm                   275528  4 i915,drm_kms_helper\ni2c_algo_bit           13413  1 i915\nsoundcore              15047  1 snd\nwmi                    19070  1 acer_wmi\nsnd_page_alloc         18484  2 snd_hda_intel,snd_pcm\nmei                    40690  0 \nvideo                  19335  2 acer_wmi,i915\nmac_hid                13205  0 \nlp                     17759  0 \nparport                46345  3 parport_pc,ppdev,lp\nums_realtek            17949  0 \nusb_storage            48838  1 ums_realtek\nuas                    17844  0 \nhid_generic            12493  0 \nusbhid                 46947  0 \nhid                   100366  2 hid_generic,usbhid\ntg3                   148780  0 \n\n\nA: Thanks, Web-E, for the link.\nSolution found:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unload brcmsmac, bcma modules\n\n*Completely uninstall bcmwl-kernel-source\n\n*Install b43-fwcutter\n\n*Install bcmwl-kernel-source\n\n\nTo be clear, this works with the Broadcom BCM43225 wireless adaptors.\nThere appears to be something broken around the brcmsmac module, causing a system-wide freeze.\n", "Q: How do I pause and resume apt-fast package download? I know that in order to speed up apt-get downloads, I can use apt-fast (which uses the aria2c or axel engine - it depends on which one I install during the configuration). But even though it says it can pause and resume downloads, I don't know how to do it,  and I can't find any answer online that tells me how to do it. \nI have no intention of pausing apt-fast update function, I just want the ability to pause the sudo apt-fast install package_name function and resume the downloading of a package in Ubuntu at will using apt-fast (with axel or aria2c)\nI have seen in some forums that sudo apt-fast update cannot be paused because it requires starting the entire process. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\nAny help would be much appreciated.\n\nA: Yes, it is not possible to interrupt current downloads smoothly. But if you cancel those downloads with a signal (e.g. pressing ^C) and if you are using aria2 you can easily continue downloading later. Axel does not support continuation of aborted downloads (and is therefore not recommended for apt-fast).\nIf you have already downloaded some files via aria2 and cancel the download they aren't available for APT until all downloads with apt-fast are finished.\nAnd on the other side if you cancel an apt-get/aptitude/synaptic/etc. download you have to start from scratch with apt-fast. But of course if some packages are already downloaded successfully and therefore are in your archive cache (usually /var/cache/apt/archives) apt-fast will ¨detect¨ them and don't add it to download queue again.\n", "Q: I don't start win7 from grub2 When I start Win7 from list.

But the Tor and the Vidalia are still running good.\nWhen Tor Browser(FireFox) freeze crash, how can I restart the browser without clicking 'stop tor' button in the Vidalia Control Panel?\n\nA: There should in theory be a way to restart the browser without causing any security concerns, however the developers probably don't view the feature as a priority. On the official site it is seen not as a bug, but as a feature request:\n\nPeople want to:\nStart Tor Browser Bundle, close Tor Browser for various reasons, leave Tor and/or Vidalia running for various reasons, and restart Tor Browser later.\n\nAgain, the official line is that the developers are 'working on a way to make this possible on all platforms'.\nNone of the current Linux stable or alpha versions of tor browser bundle currently implement the restart feature. This is because they do not contain the version of Vidalia that had the feature which allowed you to restart the browser after closing it. That version of Vidalia is discussed in this request, although there have been requests and discussion of the feature for all platforms here and here.\nIn summary, the aforementioned official sources make it clear that this seemingly simple browser restart feature is not so simple to implement. It would require a specific patched version of Vidalia, a specially patched version of Firefox (beyond the one already included in the bundle), and much work to make sure that there were no security holes introduced into the software.\nThere doesn't seem to be a quick way to implement a shell-script to do it unfortunately, so it's just a case of waiting for the developers to implement the feature or trying to help out with the development oneself.\n\nA: I don't know if this is too late to help, but saw this post browsing around for another answer.\nThe way I relaunch Tor Browser is by pointing a new firefox shortcut to ~/[tor browser directory]/App/Firefox/firefox and just loading the dang thing from there. If you've used another firefox since, you may have to reconfigure your proxies on the browser\n(prefs -> advanced -> network -> settings), but that's 127.0.0.1 and 0 on everything but SOCKS, then for SOCKS5 127.0.0.1 9150.\nPretty straightforward.\n", "Q: Is there any way to install and run Autodesk Civil3D (2010-2013) or Infrastructure Design Suite under Ubuntu 12.10?

As I thought yesterday when I used the newer, 304.64 driver from ubuntu-x ppa: \nI set up everything, the only missing thing is that the Nvidia settings aren't saved. \"Well, there's this button here saying Save to X Configuration file, let's press it\", so I pressed it, saved to the /etc/X11/xorg.conf as it suggested me in the input field.\nRestart. Slow computer. Confused user.\nFiring up terminal, top shows that Xorg eats my CPU. Looking at htop says that it's /usr/bin/X : 0 -core -auth /var/run/lightdm/root/:0 -nolisten tcp vt7 -novtswitch. It's using the CPU almost constantly and ~50% every time.\nAfter some time spent searching on Google, the best \"help\" I could find was that X doesn't like if you change its settings. \nOkay then, I reinstalled Ubuntu, deleting the previous. Now, I installed the \"tested\", 304.43 driver, but the problem is present. The only difference is that I had to use nvidia-xconfig, because there was no xorg.conf and only after that was I brave enough to save the X configuration to file from within the Nvidia settings.\nThe only thing I know is that changing (or even creating?) xorg.conf file makes Xorg CPU-hungry and the problem is present with 304.43, 304.64 and the 310.xx beta driver and even in Linux Mint.\nSome other info I think could be important:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit with Unity\n\n*ASUS GTX 560 DirectCU II OC\n\n*using two monitors, one with DVI one with HDMI (but it doesn't seem to change anything)\n\n\nIf anyone could help me how to resolve the problem I'd appreciate it, even a little help where to start would be good.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I had a similar problem, which I able to solve by enabling ACPI in my BIOS. It had been disabled, which had apparently caused the problem.\nI tested to see if there was still a performance problem after changing the BIOS settings, and it appears to be running very well. Blender runs at 60 fps! On a freshly installed system the nvidia-current-update driver package, the process listed as /usr/bin/X : 0 -core -auth /var/run/lightdm/root/:0 -nolisten tcp vt7 -novtswitch only uses 1% of the CPU.\nDetailed machine/software specs.\nSo, try making sure ACPI is enabled in your BIOS settings.\n", "Q: Ubuntu is already installed in parallel to windows, how do I replace Windows entirely? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I delete Windows after an Ubuntu install? \n\nI have already installed Ubuntu in parallel to Windows 7 on my laptop. I now want to replace Windows 7 entirely. I have already tried to boot off of CD I made of Ubuntu 12.10, however the computer seems to go straight to the GNU GRUB screen (the screen that allows me to boot to Windows or Ubuntu). Any help would be much appreciated.\n\nA: If you have Ubuntu and Windows already installed in separate partitions (that is, Ubuntu was not installed using Wubi), I think it's just a matter of booting into Ubuntu and from there (1) reformat the Windows partition(s) using your filesystem of choice (ext4 for example) and (2) run sudo update-grub to automatically remove Windows from the GRUB list.\nIn your question, I don't understand why you're trying to boot from CD. If Ubuntu is already installed then there should be no need. Maybe I'm missing something?\nAnyway, if the boot sequence goes straight to GRUB, it could be that:\n\n\n*\n\n*booting from CD is not enabled in your BIOS settings, or it's after the HDD in the sequence\n\n*the CD is damaged\n\n\nA: İ'm sorry but windows is closed-source \nwhatever i found link but you need a setup disk to repair\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/howto/32523/how-to-manually-repair-windows-7-boot-loader-problems/\n\nA: Simplest way is with gparted from the Ubuntu Live CD. This question links to an answer:\nIs it possible to use an Ubuntu Live CD and run GParted to partition a my HDD (including the partition that is usually mounted on a given system)?\nBasically the steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back Up everything\n\n*Boot with an Ubuntu Live CD\n\n*Run 'gparted' to edit partitions.\n\n*Delete the Windows partition\n\n*Resize your linux partition onto the new free space\n\n\nThere are some caveats here, listed on this page:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowtoPartition/OperatingSystemsAndPartitions\nMostly this involves making sure your boot loader (GRUB) can still find your operating system, but modern grub should work fine and find your Linux partition just fine.\n", "Q: Can't install Ubuntu 12.10 because it can't connect to internet I downloaded Ubuntu 12.10 on a CD, but I can't install it on my PC because it doesn't connect to the wireless internet. It doesn't even show the wireless option on the top right of the screen. System Settings doesn't open when I just try Ubuntu on the CD (without installing it). What should I do!??\n\nA: It seems that your wireless adapter is not supported out of the box. Install your system using a wired connection, after that you can (let's hope) install the drivers for your wireless card.\nNote: we can help just if you post the hardware details of your PC.\n", "Q: Freestanding network connection GUI application Does anyone know of a freestanding desktop independent GUI application for connecting to a (wireless) network?\n\nA: NetworkManager is the one used in Ubuntu but can theoretically be installed on basically any Linux. An alternative would be wicd.\n\nA: As mentioned by André, use wicd. To start it as a regular GUI application, use the command wicd-client --no-tray. To use a wireless connection you also need to specify the interface, e.g. wlan0, in Preferences -> General Settings -> Wireless interface.\n", "Q: How do I delete Windows after an Ubuntu install? I downloaded Ubuntu 12.04 LTS to my Dell Dimension 4600 with Windows XP installed.  I now have a neat dual-boot system, but I want to get rid of the XP OS and keep Ubuntu as my only OS.  How do I do this?  \n\nA: back up your data and use instructions here\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot using the Ubuntu Live USB.\n\n*Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), and run the following commands:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/os-uninstaller\nsudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install -y os-uninstaller && os-uninstaller\n\n\n\n*\n\n*After the commands have run successfully, you'll see this:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose the OS you want to remove and press OK.\n\n*A confirmation window will appear: \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Click \"Apply\" to start the removal.\n\n\n\nSource: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OS-Uninstaller\n\nA: Assuming you DID NOT install Ubuntu using WUBI (Windows Ubuntu Installer) and you did it via the LiveCD, LiveDVD or LiveUSB (Live whatever), then follow this steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open DASH and look for Disks\n\n\n*Open the Disks utility and select the Hard Drive you want to use (Hard Drive selection is on the Left panel)\n\n\n*After selecting the Hard drive, select the Partition you want to delete. Depending on the Disks version, you can right click the partition and choose DELETE, click on the Minus sign below the partition selection, click on a Cog above the partitions and choose DELETE. There are several ways of doing it. The only thing is that you need to have the partition UNMOUNTED and already have done ANY BACKUP you need from that partition before blowing it up into extinction.\n\n\n*After you have deleted the partition you can create a new one (Learning curve for Disk is very low, very easy to use). The important part about step 4 is that you need to update grub so it notices that you no longer have Windows with you. So open up a terminal and type the following sudo update-grub:\n\nIt will say that it has detected X kernel versions but no Windows partitions. So the next time you boot the PC, no Windows partitions will appear.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04.1 Server error on apt-get update?

You would be installing the applications (such as LibreOffice, Acrobat, etc) on each of the \"clients\", not on a central server.\nIn theory you could set up a headless PXE boot environment where the clients acted as thin clients - google LTSP, Linux Terminal Server Project for details - but this is almost certainly going to be be both overkill and considerably more complex to get running than your stated experience level sounds compatible with.

I've got a very minimalistic setup of ubuntu precise, created using debootstrap. So please don't assume that any packages are installed just because they usually are. On that system, I'd like to play some sounds from a java applet. However, this always fails with the following error message:\njavax.sound.midi.MidiUnavailableException: Can not open line\n    at com.sun.media.sound.SoftSynthesizer.open(SoftSynthesizer.java:1132)\n    at com.sun.media.sound.SoftSynthesizer.open(SoftSynthesizer.java:1036)\n    ...\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No line matching interface\n        SourceDataLine supporting format PCM_SIGNED 44100.0 Hz,\n        16 bit, stereo, 4 bytes/frame, little-endian is supported.\n    at javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getLine(AudioSystem.java:476)\n    at javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem.getSourceDataLine(AudioSystem.java:604)\n    at com.sun.media.sound.SoftSynthesizer.open(SoftSynthesizer.java:1066)\n    ... 35 more\n\nAs the messages mention a soft synthesizer, and pcm lines, I expect that the lack of some midi daemon is not the issue here. As far as I can tell, the alsa kernel modules are loaded, including snd_hda_intel, snd_pcm, snd_seq_midi among others. I've also included the alsa-base and alsa-utils packages in my installation. alsa-mixer looks good, using “HDA Intel PCH” as its default device.\nWhat other packages, configuration settings or daemon startups does java require to make its sound output work?\n\nA: I've solved this myself. Using strace (I love this tool!), I found out that java attempts to access various alsa sound control devices. Most of them don't exist (ENOENT), but the first and primary one gives (EPERM) indicating insufficient permissions.\nFrom there, the fix was obvious: the device in question belongs to the audio group, but the user running the java applet in question does not. Adding him to that group made the error message disappear.\nI'm still not hearing any sound, but that might be due to some other problem, located within the applet itself.\n", "Q: How to install .tar.gz/.tar.bz2 packages without root privileges? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to install a .tar.gz  (or .tar.bz2) file? \n\nI had already tried many things but none of them worked.\nI've tried tar xzf file.tar.gz(replacing file by the package name).\nI'm using 12.04.1 precise pangolin.\n\nA: Untar the file using command\n tar xjvf tarball_package.tar.bz2\n\nor\n tar xzvf tarball_package.tar.gz\n\nIf there is a .deb(Precompiled binaries) file in the extracted package.

I have an Asus K55V and I'm wondering which version of Ubuntu I should be attempting to use. The website offers 12.04 (LTS) and 12.10.\n\nA: In addition to Oli's great answer:\nIf you are new to Ubuntu and wish to \"just use\" the operating system rather than play and experiment with it (e.g. if it is for business), go for the long-term support (LTS), i.e. 12.04 LTS. You will not have to upgrade until 16.04 LTS (April 2016), although you would probably want to upgrade when 14.04 LTS comes out.\n(LTS versions come out every two years in April.)\nIf you prefer the latest software, and playing and messing about (as many do), go for the latest version.,Be aware that you would need to upgrade every 18 months at a minimum, although you'd probably prefer to upgrade every six months.\nNote that you can always upgrade to the latest software (selectively) even if you decide on 12.04 LTS, so you can have a mix of the best of both worlds.\n\nA: Your question might be coming from the fact that 12.04.x is long term while the 12.10 is \"normal term\". For what I have read, you are the typical end user for Ubuntu, so you will most likely enjoy more the benefits of having the latest version of Ubuntu (The 12.10 right now) instead of the more stable version of Ubuntu with longer support (The 12.04.1).\nIt might sound weird since I know you want the newest but also the stability and support. Do not worry about this since 12.10 also has it, but the long term support versions are mostly made for types of users that want to stick with one version of Ubuntu for a long time, one to start/create a server or want something that will have support in case of worst case scenarios (Like the same server caught on fire or something).\nFor the normal user like you and me, the latest will always be the best because:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have the latest, tested Linux Kernel. Which means you have more device support, better drivers, new technologies, etc. This will also go to a long term support version but only after a lot of testing.\n\n*You have the latest updates for, as an example, Unity, Compiz and other GUI tools (Like LibreOffice, Empathy, etc..)\n\n*Since you are into programming, 12.10 has an updated list of GUI apps like Codeblocks, Eclipse and others. Installing services like Apache or MySQL is the same in both cases (12.10 or 12.04.x) but they are more up-to-date on 12.10.\n\n*12.10 has less errors since it is based on the knowledge and software from 12.04. Of course, since 12.04 is a long term support, it will backport any enhancements from 12.10 to it.\nThe only downside from using a normal release like 12.10 would be than when the new version comes out, like 13.04 in April, you will most likely need to update to it to keep  up with the latest and greatest (Assuming you want this), which I would recommend since 13.04 packs too many good features to name here.\nAt the end is your decision to whether go with 12.04 (Stability and more checking) or 12.10 (Latest fixes and enhancements, etc..)\n\nA: I own the same computer as you and everything works fine with 12.04 and 12.10 except for the touchpad, it works poorly with 12.04 and perfectly with 12.10.\nAlso, I advise you to install Bumblebee if you want to enhance your battery life and use the Nvidia card.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.04 is Long-Term Support, which means it is provided security updates for five years without needing to upgrade to a newer release.\n12.10 (a non LTS release) will get similar upgrades but for just two years.\nIf you are new to Ubuntu and wish to \"just use\" the operating system rather than play and experiment with it (e.g. if it is for business), go for the long-term support (LTS), i.e. 12.04 LTS. You will not have to upgrade until 16.04 LTS (April 2016), although you would probably want to upgrade when 14.04 LTS comes out.\n\nA: 12.04 and 12.10 are two different releases. They're named based on the date (April and October of 2012, respectively).\n12.04 is a LTS which means it is provided security updates for five years without needing to upgrade to a newer release. Note that these updates do not upgrade everything to the latest version and non-security updates are only pushed back to fix major bugs.\nThe .1 on the end of 12.04.1 indicates the LTS has been re-released bundling in a load of updates. This means you'll have fewer things to upgrade after you do an install.\n12.10 (a non LTS release) will get similar upgrades but for just two years. If you went with 12.10 it would probably be expected that you upgrade to 13.04 after its release but that isn't necessary until you want (as long as you do it within 24 months of release).\n\nWhich you want to use is not a simple question to answer because they provide different things. The LTS (12.04) should remain a stable, solid operating system but 12.10 (and then 13.04, 13.10 etc) will provide newer packages which may have improved features, perhaps at the cost of stability, though that is never by design.\nIf bandwidth is cheap and you have a bit of time, consider just testing both releases. Both ISOs allow you to burn to a USB stick and then you can test Ubuntu without installing it. It should let you know if everything works.\n\nA: Assuming you do not really care about long term support and that you don't have any 12.04 specific applications, you 'll be just fine with 12.10.\nHere is a little more on long time support, and here you can see some differences between the two.\nHaving used both, I can tell you it's 99% the same thing, 12.10 having just a few extra features.\n\nA: That depends on what you want.\nThere are two different kinds of release\n12.10 is normal release and 12.04 is a LTS (Long Term Stable) release.\nThe key difference is that LTS releases have more testing and are supported for longer (typically 5 years) where as normal releases are supported for 18 months.\nMy personal choice would be the LTS version as they tend to be more stable and I wont have to upgrade for a long time.  The normal releases (12.10 for example) have more recent versions of the software however.\nSo the choice is yours If you want the latest features go with 12.10 and you can upgrade again every 6 months if you want and you have to upgrade at least every 18 months.  If you just want a stable system then go with 12.04 and you wont have to upgrade until April 2017\n", "Q: mysql completely removing I broke my mysql and now I want to completely reinstall it.

Just follow the steps:\nOpen terminal (Clt+Alt+T)  and run the command given below:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nNow the new window opens and you will see the lines given below:\n GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quite_splice\"\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"\" \n\nNow you have to change the lines above by the command lines given below:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash pcie_aspm=force acpi_backlight=vendor\"\n\nThen save the window and Update the grub from the terminal using :\nsudo update-grub\n\nNow you can Increase or decrease the brightness of your PC in Ubuntu 12.04 and the other versions also. This technique can be used in HP DV6, Acer Aspire, Dell Inspiron,  Toshiba and more others.\n                    Hope this Helps!\n                       RefreshIt\n\nhttp://www.refreshit.info/2012/08/solved-brightness-increase-and-decrease.html\n\nA: I have good news and bad news.\nAfter a routine 12.10 update installed 3.7.0.4 kernal, F5 and F6 brightness keys work!

Things like vnc are not good for this.\nYou are much better to use something like xdmcp if you want a full remote desktop. If however you simply need to run the odd application then X11 port forwarding via ssh is a easier solution. see forwarding gui programs\n", "Q: Can I use Amazon Glacier as the backup location? Amazon Glacier storage is attractively inexpensive. Is there a way to make Backup use it as the backup location?\n\nA: Not yet, however there's been progress in this area, follow this bug report:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1039511\n\nA: At the moment, I have a work-around that may be of use to someone out there.\nI use backupninja with a duplicity back-end to back up all of my system stuff ( everything except $HOME ) to a local drive in my network as well as S3 ( to comply with having an out of premises backup ).\nFor my $HOME, I use Déjà Dup.  I have it set up to back up directly to S3 as I still haven't figured a way to get Déjà Dup to back up to multiple places yet.\nHere is how I have Amazon move my data from S3 to Glacier automatically for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your browser to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3\n\n*After you log on, either pick an existing bucket where you'll be storing your data or, create a new one.\n\n*After you have created ( or selected ) your bucket, click on the Properties button on the top row of buttons ( The row should read Refresh, Properties, Transfers, Help ).\n\n*After you click on the Properties button, a bottom pane should show up with the properties for the bucket you selected ).  The tabs shoud read: Permissions, Website, Logging, Notifications, Lifecycle, Tags.\n\n*We are interested in the Lifecycle tab, click it.\n\n*You should now see a button labeled Add rule ( with a green \"+\" sign next to it ), click that to add a new rule.\n\n*This allows you to define rules for archiving and removal of data in the selected bucket.\n\n*A new pop-up window shows up with some options that need to be completed before the rule(s) are saved:\n\n*\n\n*Name (Optional):  Pick a name that makes sense for you or, one will be created for you\n\n*Prefix:  This is an important one; Any object that matches this prefix will be subject to the rule we are creating.  In my case, I typed Backup/.  This means that any object in my bucket that starts with Backup/ will be subject to this rule.  If you think of S3 like a file structure, this would mean that any \"file\" or \"folder\" inside of the \"Backup\" directory in this bucket will be subject to this rule.\n\n*Time Period Format:  Days from creation date or Date.  I picked the first one (Days from creation date) so I can use relative terms when referring to my data.  It will make sense in a minute I promise.\n\n*Add a Transition rule by clicking on \"Add Transition\".  This will add a \"Transition to Glacier\" option.  This rule specifies when to move data from S3 to Glacier.  In my case, I want data to be moved 25 days after it has been created.\n\n*Add an Expiration rule by clicking on \"Add Expiration\".  This will add an \"Expiration\" option.  This rule specifies when to remove data from S3.  I have mine set up to 90 days after creation.\n\n\n\nOnce you are happy with your Transfer and Expiration rules, click on Save and you're done.\nIf you followed my set up, your data will be moved to Glacier 25 days after it has been created and removed after it has been in S3 for 90 days.  \nA few things to note:\n- I move the data to Glacier 25 days after creation ... yes that's an odd number I know ... Déjà Dup rotates it's data and creates a fresh backup every 28 days, six months, a year or never.  I picked 28 days on Déjà Dup hence the 25 day rule in S3.  I have backupninja create new backup files every 30 days.  Both Déjà Dup and backupninja run every day on my systems.\n- I still have my backup tools clean up their data after 60 days or so but, if anything happens to be in S3 for longer than 90 days ( software crashed, changes in the rules, etc. ) it will be wiped out by the Expiration rule in S3.  This saves me money.\nThe above is how I backup my data.  How do you backup yours?  You do backup your data right?\n-Juan\n", "Q: Headphone and Speaker both works together in 12.10 This is the most common problem. My headphone and speakers working at the same time.

If I have multiple juju environments defined, I will often want to run a series of commands on one of them.  Specifying -e on every call is rather tedious, but changing the default every time you switch projects is also annoying.  Is there an environment variable I can set in my shell session to specify which environment all subsequent juju commands should be run against?\n\nA: There are three ways to manage Juju environments within the command line. One way is to set the \"default\" YAML key to the environment you want to use by default:\ndefault: devel\nenvironments:\n  production:\n    ...\n  devel:\n    ...\n  staging:\n    ...\n\nYou can override the default environments.yaml key by passing an -e flag with each Juju command, the value set to which environment you want to use:\njuju bootstrap -e staging\njuju deploy -e staging mysql\njuju status -e production\njuju destroy-environment -e devel\n\nLastly, Juju will look for the JUJU_ENV environment variable.

Yes, it's normal.\nApache can use multi-processing modules (MPM) to handle concurrent requests (see Apache MPM documentation).  The default used in Ubuntu is prefork, which spawns several processes and allows each one to serve incoming requests.\nIf the server was receiving significant traffic, you would see even more processes spawned, but even without traffic there will be several spare processes waiting.\n", "Q: How can I delete files in terminal fluently? For example, I do\ncd Music\ndir\n\nand get\n123456789.mp3\nqweerkrtrkgljdjfkdjfdkf.mp3\na.mp3\nb.mp3\nblabla.mp3\n\nhow do I delete, say, files qweerkrtrkgljdjfkdjfdkf.mp3 and blabla.mp3 with least effort?\nUPD: Key idea is that file names can be long so I actually dont want to type them.\n\nA: Try this:\nrm -f 2.mp3 blabla.mp3\n\nrm removes files, and -f forces it to (so that it wont stop, asking you if you want to delete the file). If this not in your home directory, prepend sudo. Here is another way that might require less typing (a bit harder to read though)\nrm -f {2,blabla}.mp3\n\nThis expands to 2.mp3 blabla.mp3. If you want to use larger filenames, you can use the wildcard character (*), which will return all items starting/ending with the filename you chose. For example:\nrm -f bla*\n\nwill remove all files starting with bla. If you used this:\nrm -f *.mp3\n\nIt will remove all files ending with .mp3. If you used this:\nrm -f bla*.mp3\n\nIt will remove all files starting with bla and ending with .mp3. Possibilities are nearly endless with the * character :P\n\nA: Just as everyone says, rm -f <file> is the way to go, however, as stonedsquirrel said, you can type the first few letters and hit <TAB> and it will autofill the file name.\n\nA: Easy, rm 2.mp3 blabla.mp3.\nCAUTION: This will cause permanent deletion!\n\nFor files:\n\n1234.MP3\n1345.MP3\n1234.MP4\n\nrm -f 1*3*.MP3 would delete the first 2, no confirm, PERMANENTLY!\n* is anything even blank that is why it still deletes the second one.\n\nA: Try this:\nrm qweer*.mp3 bla*.mp3\nCaution:\nIf there is a file name which is started with these letters,this command will detete that.\n\nA: As @Hckr already mentioned there no similarities between the name. You can use wildcards, e.g. rm *.mp3 would remove all files whose names end with .mp3. If there are no such similarities you need to specify every file indivually.\nYou can in fact save some typing by using tab completion. In your example, if you type rm q and press the tabulator key it will be completed to rm qweerkrtrkgljdjfkdjfdkf.mp3. This works because its the only file starting with q. If you'd type rm b this would not be enough for completion because you have two files starting with b.\n\nA: What I would do is put the files you didn't want to delete in a folder before running these commands if there were less of them than you wanted to get rid of. But ultimately a combination of Wildcards (\"*\" and \"?\") and defining statements would get the job done easily. Just depends on what files you have that you want to keep, or get rid of. \nEver tried dragging the files to delete into terminal app window? It may clone the directory as well as the file-name path style for you. However, if you are only deleting 2 or 3 files I hope it is simply for learning purposes otherwise I would type the paths and file-name in manually using the \"TAB\" on my keyboard it should auto-complete file-names given in the current directory that start with what you already typed.\n\nA: Tab completion is the way. It's enabled for bash in Ubuntu by default. It works like this:\n$ rm bl<tab>\n\nwill automatically be changed to\n$ rm blabla.mp3\n\nIf the file name is ambiguous, you need to press tab once more to see a list of possible file names:\n$ rm b<tab><tab>\nblabla.mp3  b.mp3\n\nThis also works for a number of other commands, such as apt-get, service and so on.\nIf you're interested in an even more sophisticated tab completion, check out zsh with the Grml config, it's mind-blowing.\n", "Q: How do I remove window buttons and file menus from panel in 12.10?

I like to have my buttons on the right, but when a window is maximized, Unity displays the window buttons on the left of the panel. I want to stop Unity from taking control of my maximized windows. \n\nA: I have not tried it, but I think it's the tool that would get you the furthest: \nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/11/unsettings-a-comprehensive-tweaking-tool-for-unity\nMaybe it's worth a spin, however I use gnome shell, so I don't know.\n", "Q: Stop unity from being used in VNC sessions If I do not want the unity launcher to be used in VNC sessions (:2, :3, :4, etc.) is there a way to force all my VNC sessions to be gnome classic? I log into my system (12.04) using the \"gnome classic\" display, after installing gnome3 that is. Unity keeps crashing in my other VNC sessions.\n\nA: VNC show exactly the same what is currently on your desktop, so if you login to Gnome, VNC also will be with Gnome. If you are logged in Unity, you can only login as another user to different GUI (eg.

It only works if you take out that refresh bit.)\n$ xrandr --addmode VGA1 1680x1050\n\n(This should add the new resolution you used to get, my monitor only gets to 1680x1050. The VGA1 is the connection type you get in the first command i mentioned. You might have something like hdmi1 or something.)\n\nA: Try \nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\n\nReboot your machine afterwards.\n", "Q: can xdiagnose tools can help me with troubleshoot suspend/resume on my laptop I've found a tool called xdiagnose on my 12.04LTS, but no documentation.\nI have a  Dell Latitude laptop -- will this help me resolve suspend and resume issues that might be related to nvidia and nouveau?\n\nA: xdiagnose can be quite a useful tool for some issues concerning graphics cards, although not particularly for suspend/resume issues as they are to do with the ACPI implementation of your laptop. There isn't a manpage for xdiagnose and the --help option relays a pretty terse selection of commands. However, the utility is really used for diagnosing and repairing Xorg issues, even though it could be the case that the Xorg server might be locking up on resume.\nYou can use xdiagnose -v & to track X errors in a general way and let it run in the background, and the 'extra graphics..' option in the pop-up screen (see screenshot) can be ticked to send more graphics debug messages to dmesg. Even though this information doesn't concern suspend/resume directly, the results might indirectly be useful if X is freezing on suspend or resume.  \n\nYou can get information regarding ACPI by using grep to search dmesg, /var/log/kern.log and /var/log/pm-suspend.log for ACPI, suspend, and hibernate errors. \nThere are also a lot of references to Dell Latitude laptops on Ubuntuforums, so there should be some useful information there; but to answer your specific question, xdiagnose isn't really that useful for diagnosing suspend/resume issues. See this Ubuntu wiki page and this one for a very useful and general account of how to debug resume/suspend problems.\n", "Q: Can f.lux work with dual screen (laptop + external) setup?

Why ? Even though I'm currently trying to install an AMD Catalyst driver this is more of an universal problem with Linux that I don't get. It's about how some packages which are totally mainstream and used all the time get tagged as \"no longer required\" by the system. For example as my AMD driver installation begins I get the following message:\n   Generating package: Ubuntu/precise\n   Resolving build dependencies...\n   Unable to resolve  can't parse dependency libobasis36-en_us-writer\n   can't parse dependency libobasis36-en_us\n   can't parse dependency libobasis36-en_us-res\n   can't parse dependency libobasis36-en_us-math\n   can't parse dependency libobasis36-en_us-calc\n   can't parse dependency libobasis36-en_us-base.

It happened to me before while installing other applications such as wine. Please explain. I'm new to Linux unfortunately.\n\nA: It just means that there are library packages (that are usually installed to satisfy dependencies of other packages) that were installed that the manager has picked up that are no longer needed or used by any \"actual\" programs. This generally happens in one of three cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*You uninstalled a package.\n\n*A package updated and no longer needs certain dependencies.\n\n*You've upgraded your version of Ubuntu, rendering some packages obsolete.\n\n\nIt's also going to keep happening until you do something about it, but it shouldn't stop you from installing other things (the only time it would stop you is if one of those packages is somehow interfering with the package being installed).\nGenerally speaking, it's okay to run apt-get autoremove, though without other information, the packages listed seems somewhat odd. Have you uninstalled anything, or done anything else with your system recently (just before you started getting these messages)?\nOn a side note, why are you running 12.04, instead of 12.10?\nEdit Since you're using Bodhi Linux, you're probably safe to run apt-get autoremove. I'm not totally familiar with Bodhi, but if I had to guess, I'd say it still uses the Ubuntu repositories for its base for things. That means when you installed the software pack that had Thunderbird, Firefox, etc., it probably installed the defaults from the Ubuntu repositories (or a similar \"Ubuntu\" based PPA). Since Ubuntu PPAs/repositories assume you're running vanilla, they also assume you're using the Gnome stack and Unity. Since you're not, then you have no use for libraries like libindicator, gir, appindicator, and thunderbird-globalmenu. Apt picks up on the fact that you're not actually using the things that depend on these libraries, and therefore deem them safe to remove.\nThat doesn't entirely explain the presence of things like libreoffice-3.6 and bodhi-vlc, unless you installed a more recent version of LibreOffice or VLC, either on your own or through another package bundle.\nHowever, even when I've seen things that I thought were necessary, it has turned out that removing them actually had no effect (this can happen when versions change, and it's trying to remove the older version). From the looks of it, I doubt anything system-breaking would be removed if you ran apt-get autoremove, so worst case scenario, you might have to reinstall a couple of applications. If that does happen, it might be worth filing a bug with the maintainers of Bodhi, if you can demonstrate that this sort of \"autoremove loop\" is due to something in their install scripts.\n", "Q: GNOME / Unity not meant to be customized? I was originally planning to ask if there was an easy GUI-friendly way of installing new themes on GNOME/Unity, but ...\nI've been reading some blogs recently that seem to indicate that GNOME and Unity are meant to not be customizable: (e.g. this thread on Hacker News and the associated article). \nIs this true? I'm trying to ascertain if its worth time to customize Ubuntu GUIs, whether in GNOME or Unity.\n\nA: The major issue the author has is one that developers and cutting edge users have to face. Don't get me wrong, I don't enjoy the Gnome team breaking the API with every point release. However, that doesn't mean that Gnome and Unity can't be customized, nor does it mean that it's infeasible for the average user to do so. While on Ubuntu, your version of Gnome and Unity are going to remain stable (there is a very, very short list of applications that get major updates in the middle of release cycles). So worst case scenario, your customizations would need tweaked when you do a release upgrade (ie - go from 12.04 to 12.10), and even then, any extensions you use will have updates by that time.\nBoth Gnome and Unity are still very much customizable, and both have GUIs. Ubuntu-Tweak for Unity (and some of the underlying stack) and Gnome-Tweak-Tool for the underlying Gnome stack (the GTK theme, etc). (Fair warning: there is some overlap with the two as of 12.10, due to some things that Ubuntu-Tweak has removed for some reason, so be careful with where you change the overlapping items. IE - GTK themes can be controlled in GTT, while the shell theme needs to be changed in UT.)\nYou can also use CCSM for things like wobbly windows, if you want them. However, Unity does set up a bunch of its own settings, so you may have to deal with conflict resolution to change Compiz stuff dramatically.\nAdditionally, Unity can be extended with lenses, which can add a ton of functionality (I absolutely love the calculator lens).\nIn short, it depends in part on what customizations you're looking to make. For colors, sizes, and certain parts, you can pretty much customize to your heart's content, but for some things, such as the location of the top and side bars, there's not as much available.\n", "Q: Unity problems after changing graphic card drivers The fan of my graphic card is very loud.

I usually run with eth0 config'd statically from info in /etc/network/interfaces, but sometimes need to use a dhcp acquired config.  Running dhclient just tells me it's now an upstart job and suggests running reload, but reload dhclient responds 'Unknown job: dhclient.'\nHow can I make it run?\n\nA: Configuring an interface to use DHCP (client), just put this in your /etc/network/interfaces:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nto avoid NetworkManager managing it.

Processes can be in several states, simplified here:\n\n\n*\n\n*running (currently claiming CPU time)\n\n*ready (ready to claim the CPU for some work)\n\n*wait (waiting for other processes via inter-process communication, or I/O like disk or network)\n\n*sleep (\"I don't need your time now\")\n\n\nThe priority a process has tells the scheduler to pick the process with the highest priority with a ready state to allow to use the CPU. So, in the case where several processes are in the ready state, the one with the highest priority will get most of the time. And because Linux is a preemptive kernel, it can put processes from the running state on hold and let other processes do their work. The time processes get is divided in timeslices and the algorithm for the actual scheduling can also be selected.\nChanging the nicelevel does not change anything for the memory manager as far as I know, but yes, it does influence on resource locking in a way that processes with a higher priority should finish earlier.\nI suggest you to read more on this topic: Wikipedia: Preemptive multitasking and O'Reilly - Understanding the Linux Kernel (2000)\nAnd, by the way, please note that a lower nicelevel means higher priority in Linux.\n", "Q: Why do I get a \"file too big\" error when I transfer files to an external hard drive that has plenty of room?

Additionally, I get a message when booting up saying \ndisk drive for /media/3936-3939 is not ready or not present.  \n\nAbout a week ago I was trying to install a MATLAB ISO file using mount commands etc...\nI tried mount, fuseiso, and UNETbootin.  I have a feeling this may have something to do with message I'm getting from booting up.\nIf anyone can point me in the right direction or help me out.\n\nA: Your laptop shutting down when it's unplugged sounds like a battery issue. I've had the battery in my laptop burn out before as well and this is the symptom. Simply order a new battery from your manufacturer and you should be all set (also, eBay has lots of aftermarket batteries on the cheap).\nThe message you receive at boot could be two things:\n1) You might be using an encrypted swap partition. If you don't know what this is then it's probably not the case (and it usually shows up as /dev/cryptswap1). This is the issue I get upon startup and it is because the swap partition is being wiped.\n2) More likely, there is an invalid entry in your /etc/fstab file. At boot Linux attempts to mount all entries in the /etc/fstab file. Obviously, if it can't mount something it's going to produce an error similar to that. In order to remove the message, edit your /etc/fstab file (as root) and remove the line that contains /media/3936-3939 as it no longer exists due to being removed (it maybe be a flash drive, those 8-character UUID's are usually FAT32 disks), deleting the partition, reformatting the partition, etc.\n\nA: That seems there is something wrong with your laptop battery. Just follow up the troubleshooting steps as below to see the real issue:\n1）To buy a new battery put into the notebook computer.\n2）Disconnect the notebook adapter, use your laptop until it automatically shut down. This is a deep discharge process.\n3）To connect adapter, the battery began to charge.\n4）A charge until the battery is full.\n5）The charge-discharge cycle repeated several times, your battery will reach the highest performance. \nRefer to: http://www.lovebattery.net/batterytips.asp\n", "Q: How can I prevent accidental execution of the rm -r *command? Occasionally I use command to delete some files. For example, the name might start with 'a', so I'll delete with the command rm -r a*, but I don't want to remove some other directory by accident.  How can I lock a directory to prevent deletion by rm -r ? \n\nA: You could alias the rm command to rm -i in your shell, so it will ask your confirmation for each file.\nHowever, some consider this to be harmful. See alias rm=“rm -i” considered harmful? on Superuser.com\nOther thoughts are in How do I prevent accidental rm -rf /?* on StackOverflow.com.\n\nA: The best advice is to grow to fear and respect the 'rm -r' or 'rm -rf' commands enough that, when you type them, you stop yourself and proceed slowly and with caution (reading over the command carefully a few times). The commands are useful and sometimes need to be used - but it's not a good idea to trick the system into saving you from this type of mistake; it's not a good idea to grow accustomed to such workarounds---consider building good habits that can be carried from machine to machine.\n\nA: If you are trying to selectively remove items, you can use find .\nfind . -name \"a*\" \\! -type d -delete\n\nYou can check what you are deleting by running: \nfind . -name \"a*\" \\! -type d -print\n\nFor example, create a some directories and files:\nmkdir -p testDir/a/b \ncd testDir\ntouch apple.txt banana.txt ant.tx a/antelope.txt a/bus.txt a/b/apostrophe.txt a/b/bug.txt\n\nTo see the files and directories:\nfind . -name \"*\" -print\n\nreturns:\n.\n./a\n./a/antelope.txt\n./a/b\n./a/b/apostrophe.txt\n./a/bus.txt\n./ant.tx\n./apple.txt\n./banana.txt\n\nTo verify what is being deleted:\nfind . -name \"a*\" \\! -type d -print\n\nreturns:\n./a/antelope.txt\n./a/b/apostrophe.txt\n./ant.tx\n./apple.txt\n\nTo delete the files:\nfind . -name \"a*\" \\! -type d -delete\n\nTo verify that only a* files have been delete:\nfind . -name \"*\" -print\n\nreturns:\n.\n./a\n./a/b\n./a/bus.txt\n./banana.txt\n\n\nA: In addition to the other answers here, I recommend that you use tab completion more and globbing less. From your question, it appears that you're trying to delete a single file but don't want to type the full name. In that case, instead of * you should hit Tab. Tab completion is much safer.\nIf you actually do intend to delete multiple files whose name matches a glob, the best way, as already pointed out, is to think twice before hitting enter. In addition, you can gain a lot of peace of mind if you use a backup solution that backs up all changes as you make them so you can always restore any mistake without risk of data loss.\n", "Q: What is the difference between vagrant and juju? Are they both solving the same problem? Or are they for two different sets of problems? If so for what i it better to use vagrant, and for what better to use juju?\n\nA: quick version:\nvagrant is a tool for working with virtualbox instances.  This is typically used during development (on a mac) to test-deploy your app into virtual machines that look more like your eventual production (i.e., linux) environment.  It's got a customizable (ruby) stack of handlers to create such a virtual environment any way you'd like.  Vagrant is a powerful tool to programmatically manage virtual environments and provides for all sorts of \"local\" variations of continuous-integration-style development techniques.  It's most often used to run Ubuntu VMs on a Mac, but will run on various platforms and deploy various target operating systems.  Afaik, it only works with virtualbox as an underlying \"provider\".\njuju is a tool to orchestrate services using various different underlying providers: ec2 clouds, openstack clouds, lxc VMs, and MaaS servers.  It shares a \"local development\" story (using lxc containers instead of virtualbox VMs) with vagrant, but that's really the only overlap.  In fact, I'd like to see a vagrant provider written for juju so juju can drive virtualbox containers on a local environment with the same ease that it drives cloud and lxc images.  That'd be a great fit!  Also, juju really derives a lot of its value from the set of charms/services that can be spun up straight out-of-the-box, whereas vagrant's essentially a lower-level local container provider.\nIn fact we provide a Vagrant box with Juju so that users can test the local provider from within a VM:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://jujucharms.com/docs/1.25/config-vagrant\n\n*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLNPn2rQynM\nNote that there have been efforts to \"unify\" deployment scripts around vagrant so that the same scripts can be used to deploy to cloud instances as well as vagrant boxes.  These appear to be mostly one-off asides from vagrant proper, and frankly just highlight the need for a tool like juju.\n\nA: Re \"unifying deployment scripts around vagrant\", Vagrant has excellent integration with Puppet and Chef, which can be used to automation system configuration across environments, from Vagrant boxes to local hardware to clouds. In fact many people use Vagrant to test their Puppet/Chef scripts before using them in production.\nIt would certainly be nice to add Juju to the list of automation tools that work with Vagrant.\n", "Q: Fullscreen Still Has Taskbars at Top and Bottom I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and running the Gnome Classic desktop.

The server I administrate has a dynamic IP address assigned by DHCP, which is inconvenient. When I want to SSH into it, I have to first log in by hand and use ifconfig to find its current IP address. Thankfully, it lives about two feet from where I sit.\nI know how to edit /etc/issue to show different values before the login prompt is delivered to the display, but I'd like to know if it's possible for /etc/issue to display the current IP address of eth0 (re-evaluated at boot time) so that I can see it and then ssh in without having to log in to run ifconfig.\n\nA: As of Debian 8/jessie you can use the \\4 and \\6 escape characters to output the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. So the /etc/issue file:\nDebian GNU/Linux 8 \\n \\l\n\neth0: \\4{eth0}\n\nWould output something like the following at the login console:\nDebian GNU/Linux 8 myserver tty1\n\neth0: 192.168.1.100\nmyserver login:\n\nI imagine Ubuntu would provide similar functionality (at least in newer releases)\n\nA: Building on Alex's answer and Rebs' comment, this is what I have for my /etc/rc.local file (only relevant lines):\nPRE_MSG=\"Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS\" # this is from the original /etc/issue\n\nIP=$(/sbin/ifconfig eth0 | grep 'inet addr:' | cut -d: -f2 | awk '{ print $1}')\n\nIP_MSG=\"Server IP Address:\"\n\nprintf \"%s %s %s\\n\\n%s %s\\n\\n\" \"$PRE_MSG\" '\\n' '\\l' \"$IP_MSG\" \"$IP\" > \"/etc/issue\"\n\nThe printf command does the magic. Unfortunately putting the '\\n' and '\\l' inside the format string ended up replacing the first one with the new line character and the /etc/issue file was messed up.\nSo long story short, these 4 lines keep the original info displayed by /etc/issue file and add the Server IP Address: message.\nAnd as Rebs' said, keep in mind that every time you reboot the server, this script will override the /etc/issue file, so maybe try it inside a different script and on a different file and once it's working, transfer the changes over...\nGood luck and happy BASHing :)\n\nA: /etc/issue is unfortunately a plain text, it has some options you can add to it (see man agetty) but not the IP address of eth0.\nIf you put this in /etc/rc.local:\nIP=$(/sbin/ifconfig eth0 | grep 'inet addr:' | cut -d: -f2 | awk '{ print $1}')\necho \"eth0 IP: $IP\" > /etc/issue\n\nThen you will see something like this:\neth0: 192.168.0.2\nmyServer login:\n\n\nA: With systemd you can do systemctl edit getty@ with something like:\n[Service]\nExecStartPre=-/bin/bash -c '[ ! -f /etc/.issue.orig ] && cp /etc/issue /etc/.issue.orig; int=`ls /sys/class/net|grep enp|head -1`; sed -r \"s/\\\\\\\\\\\\n/[\\\\\\\\\\\\4\\{$$int\\}]/\" < /etc/.issue.orig > /etc/issue'\n\nThen systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart getty@tty1\n\nA: For Ubuntu 19.04, I followed these steps:\nI created the file: /etc/network/if-up.d/update-issue with the following contents:\n#!/bin/sh\nPREFIX=\"Ubuntu 19.04 - dev\"\nIPADDRS=$(hostname -I | tr \" \" \"\\n\" | grep -v \"^$\" | sort -t . -k 1,1n | head -1 | tr \"\\n\" \" \")\necho \"$PREFIX\\n\\nIP: $IPADDRS\\n\" > /etc/issue\n\nI then marked the file as executable: chmod 0755 /etc/network/if-up.d/update-issue\nWorks great!\n\nA: Building on Nurchi, Alex and Steve's answers & the comment from Reb,\nThe following will grep the old IP out and add in any non local (127.) IP addresses. \nMy server is a VM and doesn't have eth0.\nTesting on Ubuntu 18.04\nPlace in /etc/network/if-up.d/update-issue\n#!/bin/sh\nMSG=$(cat /etc/issue | grep -v IP)\nIP=$(/sbin/ifconfig | grep 'inet' | grep -v '127' | cut -d: -f2 | awk '{ print $2 }')\nprintf \"%s\\n%s\\n\\n\" \"$MSG\" \"IP: $IP\" > /etc/issue\n\nThen chmod 0755 /etc/network/if-up.d/update-issue\nThe only difference between my answer and Steve's is the addition of the grep lines to remove the IP line, capture the message and readd it along with the new/updated IP\n\nA: This works for ubuntu 20.04 LTS as well.\nJust make sure you're using the right interface.

I have formatted my hard disks so that /home sits in one separate disk. Now that disk has become faulty. I am wondering whether it is possible to replace only that disk and make a new /home partion on a new disk, so that I can avoid a complete reinstall of the OS? (I know that almost all my user data will be lost)\n\nA: Answer is yes, you don't need to re-install OS. You can create a new partition (block device like /dev/sdb2) and use it for /home. You can also copy the data in old /home over if you have a good backup or the old home is still readable.\nIn your case, it seems that the old /home (disk) became faulty. You want to use a new partition or new disk for /home. It is fine and you don't need to re-install the OS.\nSteps in brief (recommend doing this using a LIVE CD, you don't HAVE TO though):\n\n\n*\n\n*create partition for /home\n\n*create file system (e.g. ext4) => mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb2\n\n*mount it as /home => for example => mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb2 /home\n\n*mount your old home if it is still mountable, e.g. mount -t fs_type /dev/sdaX /mnt/old_home otherwise you'll have to restore data from a good backup\n\n*Use rsync to copy data, e.g. from a backup mounted as /backup/home rsync -axHAX --progress --verbose /backup/home/ /home\n\n*Remember to edit your /etc/fstab and update the block device/FS for new /home\nReboot and you should be good to go;-)\n", "Q: How can I set up on-the-fly/transparent compression? I have huge data sets to deal with, and so my 1TB drive is filling up quickly. However, the data is highly compressible when using LZMA (7zip, bzip2). The only file system with transparent compression I've discovered so far is Btrfs, which is not assumed stable yet. Is there a reliable solution for piping the data through a compression and do a bind-mount to a compressed image file? \nAny idea is welcome! \nI do not want to patch any file system driver though. \nThanks! \n\nA: Fusecompress would have been a ideal, since that lives in virtual filesystem and thus has no requirement on changing the actual filesystem run. However, sadly, the project is dead upstream and I would recommend to stay away from it for this reason.\nBtrFS supports only ZLIB and LZO compression at the time of writing.\nZFS-on-Linux (non-FUSE) offers more options, including LZ4 compression. It's actively maintained and the userbase for ZFS in general is quite large in other than-Linux Unices (Sun, BSD, etc.).\nMigrating to a \"3rd generation\" filesystem could be a good idea for other reasons too, but that's totally up to how flexible you are in implementing just this.\n\nA: You can also try ZFS with Gzip-9 with would give some good results.\nSquashfs may also be considered (I didn't try it though).\n", "Q: Unable to use :NOPASSWD in sudoers I have the following sudoers file:\nmisha@misha-K42Jr:~$ sudo cat /etc/sudoers\n[sudo] password for misha: \n#\n# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.\n#\n# Please consider adding local content in /etc/sudoers.d/ instead of\n# directly modifying this file.\n#\n# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.\n#\nDefaults        env_reset\nDefaults        secure_path=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\"\n\n# Host alias specification\n\n# User alias specification\n\n# Cmnd alias specification\n\n# User privilege specification\nroot    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\nmisha   ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/pm-suspend\n\n# See sudoers(5) for more information on \"#include\" directives:\n\n#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\n\nI want to run /sbin/pm-suspend without entering my password.

You should also always use visudo to edit the file(s). You should NEVER grant NOPASSWD on ALL commands.\nExample:\nsudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/sleepytime\nInsert your line granting permission:\nmisha ALL= NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pm-suspend\nThen save and exit and visudo will warn you if you have any syntax errors.\nYou can run sudo -l to see the permissions that your user has been granted, if any of the user specific NOPASSWD commands appear BEFORE any %groupyouarein ALL=(ALL) ALL command in the output you will be prompted for your password.\nIf you find yourself creating lots of these sudoers.d files then perhaps you will want to create them named per user so they are easier to visualize. Keep in mind that the ordering of the FILE NAMES and of the RULES within the file is very important, the LAST one loaded wins, whether it is MORE or LESS permissive than the previous entries.\n\nYou can control the file name ordering by using a prefix of 00-99 or aa/bb/cc, though also keep in mind that if you have ANY files that don't have numeric prefix, they will load after the numbered files, overriding the settings. This is because depending on your language settings the \"lexical sorting\" the shell uses sorts numbers first and then may interleave upper and lowercase when sorting in \"ascending\" order.\n\nTry running printf '%s\\n' {{0..99},{A-Z},{a-z}} | sort and printf '%s\\n' {{0..99},{A-Z},{a-z}} | LANG=C sort to see whether your current language prints AaBbCc etc or ABC then abc to determine what the best \"last\" letter prefix to use would be.\n", "Q: Any linux version of clipboardfusion with macros I have Clipboardfusion installed on my Windows computer and it has a macro feature that lets me create c# or vb macros that it will execute on the copied text in the clipboard.\nIs there anything like this for Ubuntu?\n\nA: Take a look at ClipIt.\n\nExecute actions with clipboard items\n\n", "Q: Wifi stops working after update ubuntu 12.10 This is the information I get about my wireless card from running lspci -nn\nNetwork controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation BCM4312 802.11b/g LP-PHY [14e4:4315] (rev 01)\n\n\nA: \nsudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source\n\n\nA: Hmm, says here that you need to install some extra Broadcom-specific packages.

I would, however, suggest that you either keep an unstripped copy of the binaries or - in case of using objcopy - simply split off the debug symbols into a separate file that can later be used with a debugger.\nOften the *-devel packages come with symbols of the corresponding * package, by the way. So you may want to consider creating one of those in addition, if this is something you release to the general public.\nFor strip a common use is to only strip the debugging symbols:\nstrip -S -o [stripped-file] [input-file]\n\nThe switch corresponding to strip -S for is objcopy -g or simply use the long form that works for both (but not on all platforms on which I had to use strip): --strip-debug.\nFor the described use of splitting the debug symbols using objcopy, check out the option --only-keep-debug in man objcopy.\n", "Q: Easy way to install CrashPlan Is there a .deb file, repo, PPA, or anything to install CrashPlan other than the non-standard install.sh file?  I have fish as my shell, and I had to mess around a lot and finally use chsh first before the install script would even work.  I don't want to have to jump through all these hoops every time there's an upgrade.\n\nA: According to CrashPlan:\n\nauto-updates to the latest version. You DO NOT need to download it again once it's installed.  \n\nIf you are running 2.6.13 Series Kernel or greater\n1GHZ+ x86-64 CPU, 1GB+ memory, 250MB+ free drive space, Oracle (Sun) Java version 1.6+,\nGlibc 2.4+, GTK, Xorg  then it will work for you.\nCrashPlan automatically starts up after installation and prompts you to create a new account. Enter the information and click Create Account. CrashPlan will send backup reports and notifications to the email address you enter. \nImportant detail: You need to start the install script with this command in order to avoid error messages:\nsudo ./install.sh\n\nThis is pretty straight-forward. Read the 'read me and install information' for the install instructions. \n\nA: Normally bash install.sh or sudo bash install.sh should have worked but with CrashPlan's script indeed some internal commands end up running under fish and failing due to syntax differences.\nA common reason this may happen is the $SHELL environment variable, which still points to /usr/bin/fish - many programs execute subcommands using $SHELL.\nSo I tried env SHELL=/bin/bash sudo bash install.sh => still same fish error!\nfish: Expected a command name, got token of type “Run job in background”. Did you mean “COMMAND; and COMMAND”? See the help section for the “and” builtin command by typing “help and”.\nStandard input: sed -imod \"s|Exec=.*|Exec=/usr/local/crashplan/bin/CrashPlanDesktop|\" /home/anat/Desktop/CrashPlan.desktop && rm -rf /home/anat/Desktop/CrashPlan.desktopmod\n                                                                                                                            ^\n\nHmm.  Let's try harder — let's work from a real root login shell, which does a more thorough reset (environment variables, directory etc.):\n~/CrashPlan-install $ sudo su -\nroot@overgrad:~# echo $SHELL  # that wasn't the problem anyway\n/bin/bash\nroot@overgrad:~# cd /home/anat/CrashPlan-install/\nroot@overgrad:/home/anat/CrashPlan-install# bash install.sh \n\n...\nWould you like to start CrashPlanDesktop?

Thank you for installing CrashPlan for Linux.\n\nroot@overgrad:~# exit\nlogout\n~/CrashPlan-install $ CrashPlanDesktop     \n\nNOTE: when it asks you if you want to start CrashPlanDesktop, say NO.  Instead, exit the root shell and run it as yourself, as the above example shows.  (If you do run it as root, you may later have trouble starting it yourself due to log files being only writable by root — you'll have to sudo rm  them and then it'll launch; also, it will default to only backing up /root/ so make sure you configure the right directorie(s).)\nsu - is enough to get a login shell but su asks for root's password and in ubuntu we're so used to sudo only asking for our password we don't even remember root's password.  But if you're already root, su doesn't ask anything so sudo su - works.\nI felt a bit silly using this redundant sudo su combination just because su - is the syntax I remember, so a quick --help told me sudo --login should be enough.\nSurprisingly sudo --login failed with the same fish error!\nThat got me curious.  Reading through install.sh I found:\nSRC_USER=${SUDO_USER}\nif [ \"x${SRC_USER}\" == \"x\" ] ; then\n        SRC_USER=${USER}\nfi\n\n(later used to create /home/${SRC_USER}/Desktop/${APP_BASENAME}.desktop via a bunch of su ${SRC_USER} -c \"...\" commands).\n=> Aha! So the problem was that sudo snitches on us by exporting $SUDO_USER, even to a login shell.  sudo su - happenned to work because su - discards all environment variables — including SUDO_USER — in a separate step. \n", "Q: Font substitution What happens when you open a .docx document that is written in a font not\navailable on your computer?\nHow can you find the name of original font?\nI guess writer select automatically an other font.

Searching the mailing lists is also a good way of finding possible compatibility issues with your particular model.\nAfter reading the official manual for your camera, there does seem to be some other settings on the camera itself, which will allow you to specify how it connects to your computer. The screenshot below shows these settings: in automatic mode it will be recognised in Ubuntu as a PTP device (by libgphoto) and in computer mode as a USB mass storage device. In this latter mode your camera is recognised just like a flash drive, and the gphoto libraries are not used when it is mounted this way. It is worth experimenting with these modes, and there is more information on them in the useful gphoto FAQ.\n\nHowever, if you are still having problems, it may be possible to mount the camera using gvfs-mount. I go through that whole process in detail in another answer. It is about a different model of camera, but the instructions will be the same:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can't transfer photos from Kodak Easy Share C195 Camera\nIn that answer I also mention software such as gthumb and shotwell, which can be used to import your photos.\n", "Q: Connection made via sakis3g not recognised by software center I have used sakis3g to connect to internet as network manager is not able to make a connection although it recognizes the modem.But the problem is many software including pidgin and software center doesn't know that computer is already connected to internet and I am having problems installing software especially the debs I downloaded.

I started out with Mythbuntu ( an older version ), and recently updated to 12.04.1 LTS without any issues.\nI've been thinking about trying out XBMC for a while, and I decided to give it a go. Unfortunately, I seem to be running into quite a few issues.\nI got XBMC installed from the repos without any issues, but when I try to run it from a console, a box pops up with the following:\n\nXBMC needs hardware accelerated OpenGL rendering.\nInstall an appropriate graphics driver.\nPlease consule XBMC Wiki for supported hardware http://wiki.xbmc.org/?title=Supported_hardware\n\nIn the console, it prints out the following:\nX Error of failed request: BadRequest (invalid request code or no such operation)\n  Major opcode of failed request:  136 (GLX)\n  Minor opcode of failed request:  19 (X_GLXQueryServerString)\n  Serial number of failed request:  12\n  Current serial number in output stream:  12\n\nWhen I run vainfo, I get this:\nlibva: VA-API version 0.32.0\nlibva: va_getDriverName() returns 0\nlibva: Trying to open /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/i965_drv_video.so\nlibva: va_openDriver() returns 0\nvainfo: VA-API version: 0.32 (libva 1.0.15)\nvainfo: Driver version: Intel i965 driver - 1.0.15\nvainfo: Supported profile and entrypoints\n      VAProfileMPEG2Simple            : VAEntrypointVLD\n      VAProfileMPEG2Main              : VAEntrypointVLD\n\nThe file /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/i964_drv_video.so exists:\n# ls -l /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/i965_drv_video.so \n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 628728 Mar 29  2012 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/i965_drv_video.so\n\nAnd in /var/log/Xorg.0.log the following error pops up:\nGLX error: Can not get required symbols.\n\nI'm not really sure where to go from here.

In your case when installing the -i386-version this would be 32-bit (for 64-bit use the -amd64-images).\nSee also the following question: amd64 virtual machine in virtualbox\n\nA: On my [new] HP Envy Phoenix (h9-1420t) I was surprised to find this BIOS setting in:\nSecurity -> System Security -> Virtualization Technology (VTx/VTd)  > disabled\n\nA: The Virtualbox error reported is related to VTx functionality in the host machine BIOS - check that VTx is enabled there (not in the guest machine virtual bios)\nImportant note: - in some buggy BIOSes, it may help to try setting it both on or off (it should really be enabled) if this does not work as expected - my HP workstation BIOS is buggy like this - the host BIOS displays it wrongly.\nOnce VTx is correctly enabled, it should be possible to use more than one virtual processor when running in a VTx enabled multicore host. It should also be possible to run 64bit guest machines on a 32 host, but again, only if VTx is enabled on the host.\n\nA: You have to be an administrator to run Virtualbox. Right click and choose \"Run as administrator\" \n\nA: Maybe you are using more than one CPU or processor in your virtual machine. Open it again and retry.

Yesterday, while using an accounting software-\"Manager\", same message was appeared as it also uses browser integration. \nIt worked for me when I copied the URL \"http://.......\" and pasted in Firefox’s address bar, hence further process will happen in Firefox's window. But I am not sure if it works with Ubuntu Payment service. You can try with any application with 'zero' price, if it works, then I suggest to proceed for transaction.\nProblem occurred in Ubuntu 12.04\n", "Q: No sound in my HP 2000-2116tu laptop I am using HP 2000-2116TU laptop and I have installed Ubuntu 10.04 in it (I'm dual booting it along with windows 7). The problem is that there is no audio(no audio in speakers as well as headphone). The sound card in my lap is Realtek HD audio. I guess Ubuntu is not recognising my sound card. Maybe  it is the lack of proper drivers. So please help me to fix this problem. The sound card is fine since it works perfectly in windows 7.\n\nA: ubuntu provides its own sound driver,to listen sound you have to install proper plug-ins from ubuntu side.So you simply open any media file and then search for plug-ins in net via that media player.\n", "Q: Find all files on the filesystem that I have edited or created In Ubuntu, is it possible to obtain a list of all files on the filesystem that I have edited? I need some way to find all the files that I have modified or written (because these files tend to be the most important to me, and I need a way to identify them so that I won't accidentally delete them.)\n\nA: Using find command you can list the files created/edited by a user.\nfind / -mtime -10 -type f -user userid -print\n\nThis will search all the files created/edited in last 10 days.\nuse sudo if you are searching the files under / file system and if it's only your home directory($HOME) ignore sudo command.\n", "Q: Are $ reboot and $ shutdown -r now different? I was receiving the following notification at the end of my message of the day\n*** /dev/xvda1 will be checked for errors at next reboot ***\nI did the following\n$ touch /forcefsck\n$ shutdown -r now\n\nBut when I rebooted /forcefsck still existed and I was receiving the same warning at the end of the message of the day.  I then ran \n$ reboot\n\nAnd now I longer receive the error at the end of the message of the day (I assume running fsck correctly this problem)\n\nA: The manpage for reboot says:\n\nWhen called with --force or when in runlevel 0 or 6, this tool \n  invokes the reboot(2) system call itself and directly reboots the\n  system.  Otherwise this simply invokes the shutdown(8) tool  with \n  the  appropriate arguments.\n\nSo in most cases reboot just calls shutdown -r.\n", "Q: Get rid of unity without login-screen and root Before close as duplicate please read my constraints:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have no root\n\n*My box is a 12.04. virtual machine in some rack\n\n*I login from windows using Nomachine NX, it directly sends me to the desktop, no login on the ubuntu box, when I logout, the nx-connection is disconnected.\n\n\nI assume that the classic desktop is installed by default. How can I check?\nHow can I configure my account to use the classic desktop? e.g. using settings-panel or gnome-config?\n\nA: With the NX client you can set which desktop (application) to run after the ssh connection has been established.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the main NX Client and click the Configure button, you will find a dialog for setting up the connection.  \n\n*In the Desktop section choose \"Unix\" and \"Custom\". Then click the Settings button.\n\n*In the top section of the Custom - Settings dialog you can now select to run any arbitrary command.  That command could be any X application. I run xfce so I just enter the \"startxfce4\" command into the box.\n\n\nNaturally you will be limited to what is installed, but if the Classic Desktop is installed you can put in the command to start it. If I remember correctly it is something like \ngnome-session --session=gnome-classic\n\nYou could also just set up connections for each application you want. For example, you could put \"emacs\" as the command and have Emacs running as a separate window on your Windows desktop.\nHope this helps and is not too late.\n", "Q: Is dh-make the standard way to build debian packages? I've started creating a .deb package for my software a while back and the method I've stumbled upon then (I knew nothing about the domain) basically is like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*create a directory structure like this\n\n\n\n-- pkg-dir\n   -- DEBIAN\n      -- controlfile\n      -- postinst\n      -- postrm\n      -- conffiles\n   -- usr\n      -- share\n         -- myapp\n   -- etc\n      -- myapp\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*fakeroot dpkg-deb --build pkg-dir\n\n*lintian pkg.deb\n\n\nHowever these days the info I'm finding all point to dh-make. Is dh-make the new or preferred way? Where does my method come from? I'd like to use the standard way in future but for now I'd like to finish what I've started using this as I'm pressured for time. Where do I get more info on my method?\n\nA: You can create Debian packages in several ways. dh- tools are helperscripts to aid you in creating the correct directory structure and files. dh-make is the most basic one, yet has a lot of heuristic and works well with software using the GNU autotools (the ./configure, make, make install ones). It will do a lot of work for you.\nThen you can use debuild to create a source and binary package.\n\"Your way\" is just building from binary files. This is unwanted, as you can't build for other distributions (releases) or architectures. Also, Debian/Ubuntu requires to have a source package in order to be included in the repositories (along a lot of other requirements and guidelines). See for more information the links @saji89 povided. I also suggest you to download packages and inspect how they're put together, using apt-get source packagename.\nUpdate\nYou mentioned later in a comment you're packaging a Java application. The Debian wiki on Java packaging mentions this:\n\nUse of javahelper is not actually required, however implementing the\n  required policy elements without javahelper is quite difficult, so it\n  is assumed that you will be using javahelper.\n\nSo, I suggest to start reading about how to package using javahelper and DH, or the alternative to DH: CDBS.\n\nA: This is the official Ubuntu packaging guide:\nhttp://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/index.html\nThe information you want will be at:\nhttp://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/packaging-new-software.html\n", "Q: Fresh install of 64 bit 12.04 over 32 bit 11.10 alongside Windows 7 I currently have Ubuntu 11.10 32 bit and Windows 7 dual boot in separate partitions.  I am trying to do a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit (mistakenly installed the 32 bit 11.10 a little while ago.. I need a 64 bit version to support AOSP build) OVER my the exisiting 11.10 partition.  I have referenced How to Install fresh 12.04 install to a PC with dual booting Windows 7 & Ubuntu11.10?, as well as other posts on using the Live CD to do a fresh install.  However, the problem I am experiencing is when I bring up the install screen, it says the following:\nThis computer has multiple operating systems on it.  What would you like to do.\n\n(3 options)\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu 12.04 alongside them\n\n*Replace all with Ubuntu 12.04 (Warning, this will delete files across ALL operating systems)\n\n*Something else (you can create or resize partitions yourself)\n\n\nThis is different from what is in other posts, as mine states that there are \"multiple O.Ses\" and doesnt individually allow me to replace the Ubuntu 11.10.  I don't want to replace ALL O.S.es: I need to preserve Windows 7 and am only trying to replace the old Ubuntu 11.10 partition with the new 12.04 64 bit.  I did have Ubuntu installed via Wubi (I believe it was 10.04) prior to putting 11.10 in a separate partition, but I have removed it via Add/Remove programs in Windows.\nI was wondering how to go about doing this... Should I use the \"Something else\" option to bring up the partition manager, and just assign my existing 11.10 partition with root mount point + swap space.  Will this do the same thing by overwriting with fresh 12.04 install??\nI appreciate all your help.   \n\nA: You are on the right track. Choose \"Something Else\" and assign the existing 11.10 partition. Make sure to check the format (ext4) box so that none of the remnants of the 32 bit system remains. The mount point should be / from the drop down menu.\nThe installation system should find the swap space and use it.\nWarning:\nIf you choose the wrong partition you may lose Windows and all the data in the NTFS partitions. Make backups of your data before hand. Make sure the NTFS partitions are not formatted during this process.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: How to create an Ubuntu 12.10 live CD? I downloaded the Ubuntu 12.10 installer from Ubuntu website. However, I find that it is not an iso image and I am unable to create a live CD (or DVD) from it. I could not find any help from Ubuntu website as well as internet. Please help.\nPS - My OS is Windows XP. The Ubuntu installer I downloaded from Ubuntu website is a zip file. I unzipped the file and it has a wubi file.\nPS - Thanks. I could create a Live CD. 1) First I tried to do it in my laptop which has Win 7. It was showing the Ubuntu installer as a zip file and could not able to burn it in to a DVD. At that time I raised the question. 2) Later I copied the installer in my desktop which has Win XP. There the installer is shown as an ISO file and I burnt it in to a DVD and created the Live CD. This is working nicely in the the desktop. 3) I tried to run the Live Cd in my Laptop which is an AMD machine, the system does not boot up. 4) In my office desktop which has Win 7 the Ubuntu installer is showing as an ISO file. My questions are as follows: A) Why the Ubuntu installer file is showing differently in different machines? B) Why the Live CD is not working in my Laptop?\n\nA: It has to be a ISO file if it's not a wubi installer or something I don't know what system you are using now but if you are using Windows download and install this if you are using Linux download and install UNetbootin sudo apt-get install unetbootin (if you want to make a live USB).\nOr just download normal ISO from here again and burn it with Brasero Disc Burner for Linux or any program on windows it's already in default in there I think.\nI don't really know what the problem is you cant download anything different from Ubuntu site than a ISO disc image...\nEdit: Or you could have downloaded a .torrent file if you did install any torrent program so you can download the ISO file even quicker.\n\nEdit:\nOk I will answer your questions... AMD is a 64x bit processor so you have to download this file and just make a live CD it's not a zip or something it's normal ISO. You downloaded a 32x bit version of Ubuntu that’s why.\nI don't know maybe a broken ISO or something or broken download who knows.\n\nA: I think the 32 bit version conflict mentioned by Da1T is probably right. As for the zip file problem, you may have had your file extension settings messed up (i.e. your default program for ISOs was windows explorer or 7zip or something) When you view the file properties, what does it say for the extension? If you rename it to .iso instead of .zip, does it work?\n", "Q: how to connect android phone with ubuntu 12.04 laptop for accessing laptop's internet connection over wifi i have an android ics phone and i want to use my wired internet connection on my laptop through wifi.\nit can be done easily on windows 7 using softwares like virtual router or connectify.\nis there any similar software for ubuntu. i am new to linux. i have\n1.android 4.0.4\n2.ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: Some mobile devices doesn't able to detect the hotspot created on ubuntu by default method.Solution for this problem is to install ap-hotspot software on Ubuntu.\nFor Ubuntu 12.10,13.04,13.10\nRun these commands to install ap-hotspot.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ap-hotspot\n\nRun these commands to start and stop ap-hotspot.\nsudo ap-hotspot start\nsudo ap-hotspot stop\n\nRun this command to configure  ap-hotspot\nsudo ap-hotspot configure\n\n\nIf it asks for WPA passphrase give a key with the minimum of 8 characters.\n\nOR \nFor Ubuntu 12.04\nyou can download the script from here.This script requires Hostapd 1.0 which was available by default in Ubuntu 12.10,13.04,13.10.\nFor Ubuntu 12.04,add these two lines to /etc/apt/sources.list\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/network-manager/ppa/ubuntu precise main\ndeb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/network-manager/ppa/ubuntu precise main \nand save the file and run the below commands in terminal.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install hostapd\n\n\nA: Software Data Cable does it\nWith it I could connect to my phone with filezilla and write files on the sd card.\n", "Q: Speed up apt-get update by removing known ignored Translation-en I've mirrored some ubuntu repositories to a an internal repository using apt-mirror however due to https://serverfault.com/questions/93437/apt-mirror-does-not-mirror-the-i18n-directory i get the following:\nIgn https://internalrepo precise-updates/main Translation-en\nIgn https://internalrepo precise-updates/multiverse Translation-en\nIgn https://internalrepo precise-updates/restricted Translation-en\nIgn https://internalrepo precise-updates/universe Translation-en\n\nNow i'm trying to speed up as there are quite a few of these that slow down the apt-get update on our machines.\nIs there any way I can tell the sources.list.d files or apt-get to don't even attempt to get these (I guess this would speed it up more than hitting an ignore)?\nUsing Ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: I fixed this problem by adding the fallowing line:\nAcquire::Languages \"none\";\n\nat the end of /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/00aptitude (use sudo -H gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/00aptitude in a terminal to edit this file).\nAfter I did this, sudo apt-get update is running faster.\n", "Q: How to publish your key used to sign deb packages so you will be able to use your repository from any machine?
