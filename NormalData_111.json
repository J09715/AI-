["Q: How do I set the default terminal in GNOME? I want to change the default terminal in the GNOME desktop environment to lilyterm. Here are the instructions that I've found on the internet:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.default-applications.terminal exec lilyterm\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.default-applications.terminal exec-arg \"\"\n\nBut when I'm pressing the shortcut that should run the default terminal, I'm getting:\n\nWindows manager warning: Error on terminal command\"(null)\". Terminal\ncommand is not defined.\n\nWhere have I made a mistake?\n\nA: Have you tried changing it via the Terminal command:\nsudo update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator\n\nI guess this does not help if the GNOME shortcut is set specifically to gnome-terminal instead of x-terminal-emulator.\n\nA: Most of the answers here are outdated for today's Gnome software. For Gnome 3.36 there's no easy workaround. The problem lies in the fact that most Gnome software is based on Gio which it decides what terminal emulator to use eventually. Quoting a Gnome developer from gitlab.gnome.org:\n\nThe decision which terminal is going to be used by gnome-shell when starting apps that specify that they run in a terminal is made by glib and not gnome-shell and currently in glib there is a hardcoded list of terminals that is being tried: glib#338.\n\nHence, looking e.g at Gio's (version 2.64) code responsible for this behavior, we can see that Gio has hard coded the tests for several specific terminal emulators' executables search in $PATH. gnome-terminal is tested there first and other terminal emulators are tested further. If gnome-terminal is found in your $PATH, it will be used and there's nothing one can do, besides altering the programs in your $PATH:\n# mv /usr/bin/gnome-terminal /usr/bin/.gnome-terminal.unused\n# ln -s /usr/bin/lilyterm /usr/bin/gnome-terminal\n\nThis also means that the most widely solution to this problem, using gsettings, doesn't work (also proposed here: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n\nA: There are a few options:\n\n*\n\n*Try with:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.default-applications.terminal exec 'lilyterm'\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.default-applications.terminal exec-arg '-x'\n\nNote: You need to log out and log in again (tested succesfully on GNOME on Ubuntu 13.04).\n\n\n*Another possibility is to go to Shortcuts in GNOME Settings and add a new one with lilyterm as command, and set it to Ctrl+Alt+T or anything else you prefer.\n\n\n*Another way is to replace gnome-terminal with a symlink that points to lilyterm - but you don't want to do that.\n\nA: I just accidentally bumped into this question and this what worked for me:\n\n*\n\n*Check which terminal is left in your system. I had already removed all \"terminal apps\" such as xterm etc and chose rxvt-unicode as default terminal.\n\n\n*Then go to Settings → Keyboard Shortcuts and create a custom shortcut. It will do the trick for you.\n\nA: Perhaps you should open the add/edit users dialogue and see if you can change the default terminal there.\nUpdated: Users & Groups (as admin) > Select User > Advanced Settings > Advanced > Shell\nThere is a drop down menu, but you can also type out /path/to/your/shell.\n", "Q: Why Isn't Tor Working? I installed Tor & Polipo via the Software Center. I followed instructions found at this question (but since the config file was 404, I used a config from Tor + Polipo 5 Minute Install Guide Ubuntu 11.10).\nTor & Polipo are working properly. I set my network to manual proxy & added the 127.0.0.1:8118 for all but socks (which is 9050). Those are the ports set in the Polipo config file. Still, neither Google Chrome nor Firefox are using Tor when I browse. \nI expected to have this working in 5 minutes but it's been over an hour.

Is there a way to add that back in, or is this default for 12.04?\n\nA: Jorge: there are several ways to hibernate a Linux computer. If Ubuntu's defaults fail, you can always try the other hibernation systems.\nIn a console:\nsudo apt-get install hibernate\n\nAfter that, reboot. That will install the uswsusp system, a reliable system with compression, that wasn't even installed with Precise.\nThe second system is TuxOnIce, but setting it up requires more technical skills.\nAfter that, follow the Precise howto for enabling hibernation, posted before. It's sad to see that the packages needed to hibernate aren't even installed in a Precise default install. If you don't install \"hibernate\", if you try to run \"sudo pm-hibernate\", that command won't do anything (althogh on some systems it would perform a shutdown).\n\nA: It's not because of 12.04 but because you don't have a swap partition, or it is not marked as use for hibernate. I had a similar problem when I upgraded to 11.10.  \nGo to this webpage for help either adding a swap partition or making it ready to use swap. \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq#How_do_I_add_more_swap.3F\nRemember your swap must be bigger than your amount of physical memory if you want to hibernate!\n\nA: Hibernate will only work if you dont have a crypted swap partition, which is the default if you choose to crypt your login directory during ubuntu 12.04 install.\n\nA: Try adding a script like\n\n#!/bin/sh\n\nPATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin\n\ncase \"${1}\" in\n        hibernate)\n                if [ -e /dev/zram0 ]; then\n                swapoff /dev/zram0\n                fi\n                ;;\n        thaw)\n                if [ -e /dev/zram0 ]; then\n                swapon -p 100 /dev/zram0\n                fi\n                ;;\nesac\n\nto the /etc/pm/sleep.d diectory. This was need to get it working for me as guess what ? You can't hibernate to a ramdisk !!!\nD.\n\nA: Unfortunately, hibernation has been disabled by default in Ubuntu 12.04, because it wasn't working correctly on many systems.\nIf you are not sure if hibernation works with your hardware, you can test it by sending the hibernate command from your Terminal\nsudo pm-hibernate\n\nHere's how to enable it anyway: (warning: only for advanced users — might not work)\nIn the Terminal, type:\n\nsudo gedit /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/10-vendor.d/com.ubuntu.desktop.pkla\n\nEnter your password when requested.\nSearch for the section\n\n[Disable hibernate by default]\n  Identity=unix-user:*\n  Action=org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate\n  ResultActive=no\n\nand replace it with\n\n[Re-enable hibernate]\n  Identity=unix-user:*\n  Action=org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate\n  ResultActive=yes\n\nAfter the next restart, the option \"Hibernate\" will be back in the 'power menu' at the top right of your screen. If your hardware supports hibernation, it'll work now.\nNote: In case you want to disable hibernation again, just revert the changes made above.\n\nA: Hibernation is disabled by default in Ubuntu 12.04.

Didn't know what to do at the time and had to leave so I shut off the computer. When I booted it back up later that night I found I had 3 hard drives. C: is 50GB, System F: 100MB and Temp_Part01 D: 524.90GB. My laptop has 6GB of Ram I believe. I did a system recovery that came with the laptop hoping it'll boot into partition program made by Samsung on the first boot like it did the first time. \nCould use some help. Been banging my head trying to figure this out. \n\nA: Since you list some drives by letters, it's clear you have Windows installed, too.  Since you're evidently setting up a dual-boot configuration, have you decided how much space you want to give to each operating system?  The first thing you ought to do is boot into Windows and look at each of your drives and see what, if anything, is in them.  The C: drive should have Windows, of course, but you need to be sure that there isn't anything on the other drives that you don't want to lose.   (Since you just got your laptop, that's unlikely.)\nOnce you've made that decision, the best way to handle the partitions is to boot from the Ubuntu \"Live\" CD, and choose \"Try It\" instead of \"Install\".  Once you get to the Ubuntu desktop, open The Dash (the round Ubuntu logo at the top of the Launcer) and type \"gp\": that will bring up the GParted icon; choose it and let it open.  GParted is used for creating/resizing/deleting partitions.  It's a very good program that can handle lots of different filesystems, including Windows NTFS partitions.\nIn GParted, the partitions won't be known as C: or F: or any other letters, but will have names like sda1, sda2, sda3, etc.  (If you have additional physical drives, they might be known as sdb, sdc, etc.; the a, b, c, etc. refer to physical drives, the numbers 1, 2, 3, etc., refer to partitions on those drives.)\nThis picture is of GParted's look at my computer, which doesn't have Windows installed but which has other partitions for other uses, including another version of Ubuntu and some unallocated space I use for testing.\nAnyway, if you right click on a partition, you will be shown a menu that gives you the option of resizing or moving or deleting a partition.  Since it's a new laptop, you probably don't have anything installed onto other drives, except Windows in the C: drive; if that's the case, you should probably delete those empty partitions.  This should leave you with one partition (I'm guessing it'll be sda1, the C: drive containing Windows), and a lot of unallocated space.\nOnce you're at this point, you might want to enlarge the Windows partition.  You can right-click on that partition and choose to resize, but be very careful.  You can expand it as much as you'd like into the unallocated space to the right, but be careful not to \"move\" the partition to the left; Windows often doesn't like that and it might cause you problems when you try to boot again into Windows.  Also note that when you decide and tell GParted that you want to resize the partition, it won't actually do it until you push the \"arrow\" button (I think it's the right-most button above the partition window); until then, it's a pending operation.  Resizing the partition might take some time, but that's all right, just let it run until it's done.\nOnce you have resized Windows to make it as you'd like, you'll still have unallocated space remaining, and that's fine.  If you're happy with the sizes, go ahead and close GParted, and then click on the icon (on the desktop or launcher) to install Ubuntu.  (If you want to create multiple partitions for later use, you can easily go back and make those later; for now, just let Ubuntu use all the remaining space.)  As it proceeds, you'll get to a window in which you'll be given some choices: choose to install Ubuntu alongside Windows; it will automatically put it into the unallocated space (I think it'll let you choose the format of the filesystem to use: I'd recommend using \"ext4,\" which is a Linux filesystem.  (If you're asked for a mountpoint, which I don't think will happen with this type of installation, choose \"/\"; as I said, though, it probably won't ask.)\nAt that point, you just need to answer a few questions, such as computer name and such, and let the install proceed.  It will install the Linux bootloader, known as Grub, and eventually finish and tell you it needs to restart.  As it shuts down, it'll kick out the CD (and ask you to press \"Enter\").  Then it'll reboot, and the Grub window will appear, allowing you to boot into Windows or into Ubuntu.\n(If, on the other hand, you're going to wipe Windows from the drive and just install Ubuntu, you should still boot from the \"live\" CD but choose to install Ubuntu, and when you get to the screen asking where to install it, choose to use the entire drive; it will then wipe off Windows and install Ubuntu.)\n", "Q: How to rip DVD's in high quality I am currently backing up (ripping) my dvd collection onto my server harddrive, to allow streaming throughout my house. I am using Acidrip to do the ripping. My problem is that the quality video of the rip is not as good as I would like, and the file size is a little too big. I downloaded an .avi rip of the blu-ray movie \"black hawk down\" the other day, and the quality was very good. I believe it was a 720p rip. But the file size was only 700mb. When I rip regular dvd's I choose a high bitrate (around.22) but my file sizes are anywhere from 1000mb to 1200mb, and the quality is nowhere near as good. How can i use acid rip to rip a high quality video at a 700mb file size? Is there better software, or is there something I'm missing in Acidrip?\n\nA: I used acidrip. I find it much simpler then dvd::rip or handbrake.\n\nA: I've found handbrake to be a lot easier to use, and it has more/better presets that you can use.  You can try using its \"target size\" setting to control the output size but potentially lose some quality.  It's very likely that the existing rip you found had done this, and your version should be higher quality.\nhttps://trac.handbrake.fr/wiki/AvgBitrateAndTargetSize \n\nA: DVD::RIP is great - you can select a DVD image directory, and it copies into your harddisk before ripping. I think it's useful when you get DVD and want to rip it.\n\nA: Check out this page.  It's a poll of various different Linux DVD rippers - the most popular being Handbrake, followed by dvd::rip, and then some others.\n", "Q: How to resolve Unmet dependencies error?

But it needs to be enabled at every startup, rather than just being automatically enabled from the beginning of the session. I'm running a Lenovo X121e, and have installed Xubuntu 11.10 onto it.\nAny ideas on how to make it so it starts as enabled automatically?\n\nA: For me it is a bug. I filled a report here https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/951810\nFurther update:\nThe problem is the bios as this bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/812866 updating the bios, then reset to default the bios solve this issue\n\nA: This is probably you did a hardware switch. This can be undone by pressing your wifi activator key. It differs on different computers. But to check, open your terminal crlt+alt+t. Then press rfkill list (Description of rfkill: rfkill - tool for enabling and disabling wireless devices). It will show weather or not your wifi and LAN is either hard blocked or soft blocked. Hard blocked is when the wifi (for example) is blocked by a physical button/switch. Soft block is when it was blocked virtualy though the OS. Before you try and reboot and press the wireless button to activate it, try using the following command: rfkill unblock wifi then check if it is blocked. Use rfkill list to check if its block on unblocked afterwards. If it is hard blocked, just reboot and press the wireless botton.\n", "Q: Wine prevents my system from booting I installed wine windows program loader in my system having Ubuntu 11.04.

I would like to uninstall wine. It is also that I installed wine from Ubuntu software center.\nCan anyone suggest me a way out of this?\n\nA: I seriously doubt Wine has anything to do with your booting issue, the only possibility Wine has of loading anything is after a user logs in.\nAnyways, if you want to remove Wine follow the instructions below.\n\nBoot up until the login screen, instead of entering your user credentials press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to switch to a TTY (press Ctrl+Alt+F7 to switch back to your running X session).\nLogin in the TTY and use these commands to remove Wine from your system:\nRemove Wine\nsudo apt-get remove --purge wine\n\nMove Wine's cache somewhere else\nmove ~/.wine ~/wine.old\n\nReboot\nsudo reboot\n\nThat should be enough to remove any Wine traces from your system.\n", "Q: How to allow write access (create/write files) to a directory but prevent delete (to all, including owner) I want to allow any write access to directory but prevent ANYONE (aside from root?) from deleting the files once they are written.

Outside of that you may need to explore other options, such as making the app/person run the create command as : sudo -u USER vi/touch /dir/file\nAlso check out the chmod manpage\n\nA: chattr +a seems to work as it only allows append to the directory (creating files)\nRoot won't be able to remove it directly but is able to chattr -a when it comes time to delete.\n", "Q: Compatibility of Toshiba Satellite L855/L875 with Intel/AMD hybrid graphics? Has anyone tested the Linux compatibility for the new Toshiba Satellite L855/L875 laptops with Intel/AMD hybrid graphics? Are the proprietary ATI drivers working? Is Bumblebee working for them?\n\nA: ONLY install 64-bit version of Ubuntu on this computer, the 32-bit version doesn't work:\nA friend of mine just bought a \"Toshiba Satellite L875D-103\" (in Norway). He wanted me to install Ubuntu 12.04 on it. I have installed Ubuntu on several computers and been using Ubuntu for several years. But this laptop gave me some headache. Wireless does not work, sound does not work -and worst of all it tends to \"hang\" occasionally. In addition the touchpad and/or keyboard tends to \"stop working\" (the external mouse still function).\nBecause of the keyboard problem there was real pain just installing Ubuntu, using it is impossible as for now. When it freezes the mouse pointer still lives -but nothing else.\nTried with and without the ATI Catalyst driver -no change whatsoever.\nAs for testing anything it's impossible as it hangs too often. (As I said, even the installation was a pain as it hung and/or keyboard stopped working.)\nThis laptop is working fine with Windows 7. But who wants to use THAT!?\nThe 64-bit version is working (also with the AMD Catalyst driver which let you choose(manually) between hybrid graphics.) Read below to get the wireless working.\n\nA: I'm writing this answer on a Toshiba Satellite L855 which I bought new 2 weeks ago. Ubuntu 12.04 installed very nicely from a DVD, alongside Windows7 (dual boot). I'm running it with an additional (external) display (this works flawlessly over HDMI).\nSo far I've seen no problems whatsoever, except: Only the wireless networks card works out of the box, not the wired network. At the moment I'm trying to figure out why.\n\nA: I can confirm that Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit works well except the wireless on toshiba satellite L875-S7208.   Wireless connects briefly (30 secs or so) then quits.  \n\nA: I have Toshiba Satellite L855-14J.\nHybrid graphic is not working. It's not about Ubuntu - Toshiba didn't make graphic switchable.\nSo, you can't use Intel graphics built in processor, but AMD graphic card and drivers are working fine.\nI think only hope is new BIOS update, but I'm not big optimist because I find Toshiba support and general quality quite messed up.\n", "Q: Ubuntu-Server Upgraded to Ubuntu desktop, How do I change it back? I decided to upgrade my home server to Ubuntu 11.10 from 10.04. Instead of upgrading to the server version, it upgraded to the desktop version, or something similar to it. I assume this is because I had GNOME installed to manage certain features through VNC (Linux noob here). So how do I get it to stop booting to the desktop and get rid of all the additional GUI stuff it installed with the upgrade?\n\nA: not sure about the newest version, but \"apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop --purge\" was how I did it the last time I messed up.\n\nA: remove all desktop environments you may have installed, by using \"apt-get remove\" command. However, thats not the only thing you will have to consider.\nA server system has a different set of configuration or way of doing things. For instance, a server almost always requires a higher usage of swap-memory as overall performance is more important. On the other hand, relatively less swap memory is needed by a desktop system where quick response-time is more appreciated by the user.

I also have OpenShot and Pitivi installed. OpenShot crashes more than Pitivi, and has more features, but Pitivi has a far better interface. But the lack of features means that I have to deal with OpenShot's unreliability.\nIf I capture my desktop with RecordMyDesktop, then the resulting video plays fine in the video player. However, once imported into OpenShot, the video is pixelated (even when rendered as an exported video). Ironically, when importing the same captured video into Pitivi, everything works well and as it should.\nIf I capture my desktop with XVidCap (which isn't as friendly as RecordMyDesktop), then everything works fine in OpenShot (and Pitivi).\nWhat I do know is that RecordMyDesktop saves files as OGG while XVidCap saves files as MPEG. But should that make a difference when using OpenShot and Pitivi? (I have all the restricted extras and Gstreamer stuff installed, for example.)\nRecordMyDesktop (and OGG files) are preferable to XVidCap. Any idea what's going on here?\nEDIT: Correction. RecordMyDesktop seems to create OGV files.\n\nA: Same here.\nPitivi and Totem uses gstream and work fine with RecordMyDesktop OGV files.\nOpenShot, mplayer, mplayer2, smplayer, mencoder and ffmpeg show the video \"pixelated\"\nmplayer says:\n==========================================================================\nOpening video decoder: [ffmpeg] FFmpeg's libavcodec codec family\nSelected video codec: [fftheora] vfm: ffmpeg (FFmpeg Theora)\n==========================================================================\n\nI fixed it using VLC to convert RecordMyDesktop OGV files to WEBM, then opening in OpenShot.\n", "Q: How do I setup ethernet-only SSH? On my pair of Ubuntu systems, a 3 MB file transfer via Nautilus 2.32 over SSH takes about 15 seconds between two computers with identical wireless cards 2 meters apart. \nLarger files take significantly longer, so the 15 seconds is not dominated by handshaking.  This data rate seems unsatisfactory and obviously it would get worse if I were concurrently using the wireless cards for internet access.\nI have a 20 meter (About 65 feet) Ethernet cable, coiled down to 2 meters, between the two computers but that physical medium is probably not being used for SSH because when I disable wireless, each Nautilus cannot see the other machine. \nHow do I setup SSH for the Ethernet cable exclusively?   \n\nA: Create your own small network\nMake up a nice small subnet in the private IP space, e.g. 10.1.2.0/24. This is for 254 hosts, and overkill, but it's easy in calculation and entering details.\nI'm assuming you have either a switch connected between the two or using a network cable that is suitable for your two PCs to be connected to each other directly. Most modern network cards feature Auto MDI/MDIX, so no need for a crossover cable.\nBelow is a list of steps to have PC1: 10.1.2.1 and PC2: 10.1.2.2.\nOn PC1\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Edit connections.\n\n\n*Add a new connection.\n\n\n*Fill in a name, e.g. Cross-cable connection\n\n*Select the right interface from the \"Device MAC address field\":\n\n\n*Then on the IPv4 Settings tab, add the following details and take the steps as shown in the image.\n\n\n*\n\n*Method: Manual\n\n*Address: 10.1.2.1\n\n*Netmask: 24\n\n*Gateway: 0.0.0.0 (this means 'none' in IPv4)\n\n\n\n\n*Establish the connection using the network menu:\n\nOn PC2\nFollow the same steps, on one exception: enter 10.1.2.2 as IP address.\nNow, you should be able to 'ping' PC1 from PC2:\nping -c3 10.1.2.1\nPING 10.1.2.1 (10.1.2.1) 56(84) bytes of data.\n64 bytes from 10.1.2.1: icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=0.661 ms\n\nAnd establish a connection with Nautlius using the IP addresses we just assigned.\n", "Q: Can Unity and GNOME Shell apps run on LXDE? I am currently using GNOME Shell, Unity and GNOME Classic on Ubuntu 11.10. I would like to know if I download LXDE, would the GTK applications that I have on GNOME 3.2 (which is being used by Unity and GNOME Shell) be able to be used in LXDE, or do I have to install separate software that can only be used by LXDE?\nBecause the apps I install on Unity Shell can also be accessed and used on GNOME Shell (I suppose this is because they are both running on GNOME 3.2 which uses GTK+3 libraries) can I find the same apps I install on GNOME Shell and Unity on LXDE? \nHere's what I mean: I install GNOME Shell on Ubuntu 11.10. I am able to access the apps I installed on Unity on GNOME Shell from the search bar. Even the bookmarks I save on Firefox in Unity will also be saved in Firefox in GNOME Shell. What I am asking is will it be the same situation where I do not have to install apps specifically for LXDE?\n\nA: There is no special reason why gnome-shell or unity applications should not run under LXDE or any other desktop environments.\nThe only exceptions are applications that make specific use of capabilities and functionality that is very specific to a particular desktop environment.\nLXDE/Lubuntu applications you will find are often GTK+ based - thus the vast majority of GTK+ apps you see in blogs running in Unity/Gnome-shell should work for LXDE.\nIf you are a purist, you should look out for the dependencies that a particular application brings with it.  Some applications will have a dependency that would involve installing the majority of one desktop environment/stack.  \nTo test what dependencies an application requires try a simulated install i.e.\nsudo apt-get -s install [package-name]\n\nLook at the sections:\nThe following extra packages will be installed:\nand\nThe following NEW packages will be installed\nIf the list is particularly lengthy then perhaps you should consider an alternative - less bulky/dependent application.\nOccasionally after installing an application, it does not appear in the menu.  For these applications have a look at the applications .desktop file in /usr/share/applications.  Some applications desktop file has an entry similar to OnlyShowIn=Unity.  I would remove this entry and it should (after logging out/logging in) appear in the menu again.\n", "Q: Are there keyboard shortcuts for opening/using the filter on the unity dash?

Like all panels - you can just remove this panel and then add whatever dock you which to use.\n\nRight click the second panel and choose Panel Preferences - you can then delete the Panel as shown.\n\nA: The dock you want is probably Docky. Start the software centre and search for Docky, or start a terminal and type sudo apt-get install docky.\nYou can install Avant Window Navigator, but I suggest you don't.

I hope that somebody is able to help me - thank you\n\nA: The problem is more likely that you need to install a different driver. My system defaults to using r8169 and I can never get stable connections with it (except on newer kernel versions than Ubuntu is using).\nIf your Ethernet chip set is  RTL8111/8168B, I recommend that you download and install driver r8168. The version you need to find is 8.028 or greater.\nAfter you expand the driver into its own directory, cd into that directory and run \"sudo ./autorun.sh\". After that script completes, your ethernet connection should start, and it should also be stable.\nYou will have to reinstall the driver every time you upgrade to a newer Linux kernel. At least until Linux gets to the level where r8169 starts working.\n\nA: I've just upgraded my machine & the new motherboard has this chipset network on board. I've had exactly this issue & have discovered that everything works ok as long as the machine is cold booted into Ubuntu.

To be honest, I don't know if it ever worked on this hardware (relatively new computer, had it for a few months), seeing as the Wine app I use the most hardly uses sound, but now that I tried another app, it's giving me problems. When I do an audio test in Wine Config, I get a short static sound. The selected driver appears to be winealsa.drv, do I need to change that and if so, how would I do that? I have all the input and output devices set to default, I don't think I have to change that. I also shouldn't have to restart ALSA with sudo /sbin/alsa force-reload because it seems to work fine with my other applications (unless that's all on PulseAudio?), but even when I do run that command to restart ALSA, the test sound in Wine Config is still the same short static. I thought  In the one application I just tried that uses sound a lot, sound plays but insanely fast, making it practically as useless as if sound didn't work at all. Sound works perfectly from anything outside of Wine.\nI think I've found the problem, though. When I go in Regedit to HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Wine/, there's no Drivers key, nor Audio key. I created a Drivers key and added an Audio string with alsa as a value, didn't change anything. Edit: if I set the value to anything else, Wine Config tells me the audio driver is unavailable.\nI've tried searching for a solution, went through forums (and I'll keep searching), I briefly looked at the Wine AppsDB but I don't think the problem is application-specific\nPlease help!\nEdit: getting the debs from this place (from the Launchpad bug) tells me it has unmet dependencies, and if I try to install that dependency, Synaptic tells me it has to remove a whole lot of packages! Not willing to do that.\n\nA: Ok I believe to have found the solution. I did delete my .wine folder and regenerated it by launching wine config but I think what solved it was rebooting my computer. I tried running the command wineboot but that didn't suffice for some reason, maybe that command would require a parameter to work.\nWhat I know won't work is trying to install OSS from Synaptic. Having OSS packages installed will disable sound in Ubuntu.\n\nA: I have the same problem and it has been for ages. I am now running 12.04 Beta 1. This problem can be resolved if you choose the esd sound driver for Wine in the registry (if you have the sound backend installed on  your machine). Whatever I did when I had 11.10 on my machine the only solution that worked was esd as sound backend for Wine. ALSA to PulseAudio for all other applications seems to work. Note that I have multichannel sound cards in my computer. Maybe plain stereo cards will work. When I change the channel configuration the sound works for about 10 minutes again.\nWine 1.4 can automatically select the proper sound backend thought.\nIn short, Wine, ALSA and PulseAudio together is a mess! I will wait for a proper PulseAudio sound backend.\nBest regards,\nAndreas Eriksson\n\nA: I can confirm- same problem on Ubuntu 13.04, solved by running \"wineboot\" and then restarting (both were necessary btw). \n", "Q: How to configure motherboard to allow suspension My computer is unable to suspend/hibernate on Ubuntu 11.10.

Just hit Ctrl+Alt+F1 to switch to a command line and enter the commands.\nIt has happened to me before, but removing the drivers and returning to the open source ones fixed it. However, generally the proprietary drivers are faster and support better 3d performance.\nThe GUI installer found on ATI site never worked for me so I do not recommend it.

First I googled some how-to's, then I downloaded Ubuntu onto a memory stick and made a second partition (I originally only had one partition that I shrunk and used the unallocated space to install onto during the Ubuntu install). During the install I set format type to xt4 (or something, it was the default option), chose the \"in the beginning\" option and set the last option as \"\\\". \nThe install was successful. Although, when I restarted my computer I weren't able to choose which operating system to start; it went right into Windows. After showing the Windows logo for half a second before rebooting, I get a blue screen (see bottom of the page). Trying to fix it, I deleted the newly made partition I had just installed Ubuntu onto (seeing it wasn't working either). This made no difference. I proceeded with installing Ubuntu again, so I would at least have a functioning computer, and now Ubuntu works fine (I'm on it now). The only difference on start-up is that I get a GRUB window asking me to between several options including Linux and Windows 7 (loader). \nNow, if I choose Windows 7, I get the message: Windows was unable to start. A recent software or hardware change might be the cause.. It recommends me to choose the first option of the two it provides; to start start-up repair tool. The second option being starting Windows normally. If I start Windows normally, the same thing happens as earlier. \nMy computer does not have a Windows installation CD. Although, it has (at least it used to, if I haven't screwed that too up) a 17gb recovery partition. In addition I made an image of the computer onto a external hard drive when I first got it, though, I have no idea how to use either. \nIf anyone has any idea how I can make Windows work again or reinstall it (I already backed up my files) it would be greatly appreciated. I still prefer to dual boot between the two functioning operating systems, but I will settle for a functioning Windows 7. \nBlue screen:\nA problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.\n\nIf this is the first time you've seen this Stop error screen, restart your computer. \nIf this screen appears again, follow these steps:\n\nCheck for viruses on your computer.

However this messes up the CLI. For example, when browsing history with the ↑ it crops and overlaps the display. When i type a long command the cursor moves to the beginning of the screen overlapping with the prompt display itself. What have I done wrong?\n\nA: That's because bash thinks the prompt is longer than it is. The escape sequence \\e[0;31m for instance, gets sucked up by the terminal, which in turn turns the following text red, but bash doesn't know that. So, you have to tell bash that that sequence of characters should not be counted in the prompt's length, and you do that by enclosing it in \\[ \\]. I also recommend using tput instead of hardcoding terminal escape sequences.\nred=$(tput setaf 1)\nreset=$(tput sgr0)\nPS1='\\[$red\\][\\W]\\$\\[$reset\\] '\n\nSee BashFAQ 53 and Terminal codes (ANSI/VT100) introduction for more.\n", "Q: Lineage 2 Freya, doesnt run from wine I start the game and I get to the login screen.

The problem is in section of \"select and install software.\" \nFirst it was struck at retrieving 636 of 636 and then when there was no progress I restarted the computer then it gave me the following message:\nPlease insert the disc labelled: 'lubuntu 11.10 _Oneric Ocelet_ - release i386(20111011)' in the drive '/media/cdrom' and press enter.\n\nI had downloaded an iso image of the Lubuntu 11.10-alternate (592mb) and burned the iso image to the cd.\n\nA: First of all, if at all possible you should download the latest version of Lubuntu (13.04) and install that instead. That will have fewer bugs and will work better on hardware old and new.\nLubuntu (yes, the regular Desktop version) should run fine on your PC with that hardware. It will be slow, but it will run. I would wait at least a half an hour before shutting down your PC if you encounter a hang during installation. If you want to check the disk for defects, you can do so by selecting \"Check Disk for Defects\" at the boot screen.\nLubuntu will certainly run, but the question is whether enough RAM will be available to run the installer. If you keep trying the installation and the PC continually hangs, as in: the mouse is difficult or impossible to move and you can't even get to a tty terminal with Ctrl+Alt+F1, then you may wish to try the alternate iso as you were attempting. Also, there are several ways to install without a CD that do not require a high level of computer resources.\nAs a last resort, you can try another distro such as SliTaz if you find that the hardware setup just can't handle the software.\nI hope this information helps!\n\nA: I have had this problem before. Here are some troubleshooting steps to hopefully fix it:\nQuestion 1  - Did the ISO image work on a virtual machine?\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes: Have you looked for scratches on the CD?\n\n*\n\n*There are scratches: Try burning it to a different CD or a LiveUSB\n\n*There are no scratches: Check questions 2 and 4.\n\n\n*No: This is most likely a bad download, try downloading it from a torrent this time.\n\n\nQuestion 2 - Are you on UEFI?\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes: Is your BIOS up-to-date?\n\n*\n\n*Yes it is: Try using wubi for install.\n\n*No it's not: Go to your motherboard manufacturer's website and check for BIOS update utilities.\n\n\n*No: Refer to below question.\n\n\nQuestion 3 - Are you just dragging and dropping the files from the ISO into the CD?\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes: Use the Windows Disk Burner tool.\n\n*No: Good job.\n\n\nQuestion 4 - If you are using a VM for testing, what VM software do you use?\n\n\n*\n\n*Other than VirtualBox: Get VirtualBox and see if that works.\n\n\nIf you have any problems, just tell me.  Good luck!\n\nA: Did you download the disk image with BitTorrent or directly from the website? \nIf latter, did you check the MD5 hash of the disk image before you burned the disk? \nInstructions on how to do this are at here - the MD5 sums are:\n\n\n*\n\n*a3d9689f0f63827d8f72a38b5a80767e for lubuntu-11.10-alternate-amd64.iso \n\n\nand \n\n\n*\n\n*6b2ef531916da95982eb9b9de9dcb19e for lubuntu-11.10-alternate-i386.iso. \n\n\nIt's important you do this before you start burn the image on the disk, but you can check the integrity of the disk after burning by booting it up and selecting to check the integrity of it right after the boot up.\nIt is also important that you try to burn the image as slow as your patience allows you to burn it.\nYou can follow up the installation process during installing with alternate disk by cycling to other terminals, with Ctrl-Alt-f1 through f8. Some parts of the system can take a long time to install and it might look like the system has become unresponsive.\nWhen rebooting, did you still have the installation media in the drive? The error points to the direction that you didn't.\n\nA: Why not a newer release of Lubuntu?  I'm sure you have your reasons.  But in case you do want to go with a newer release, as stated in the answer the screens are pretty much the same, they may just look a little different\nYou can use ImageBurn under Windows, to burn a bootable CD/DVD,  and Unetbootin for a bootable USB under Windows, and Linux.  I would recommend that you create a bootable USB.  For burning a CD/DVD under Ubunut see How to burn a DVD on Ubuntu\n\nIf the CD writing fails, try writing at a slower speed. For better\n  results, try the slowest burn speed reasonably possible. This is the\n  single most likely cause of problems but is much more widely known\n  than Md5sum/SHA error-checking. Slower speeds ensure greater accuracy.\nOnce you burn the CD/DVD, check it and make sure that it was burned\n  perfectly, by doing a CDIntegrityCheck\n\nFirst of all why use an alternate CD?  Just download the regular CD.  For Lubuntu 11.10, 12.04/12.10, and 13.04.  Once downloaded you can either create a CD/DVD, or a bootable USB.  I would recommend that you do an MD5SUM on the ISO downloaded, and try burning on a slow speed, just to be on the safe side.\nWhen done, just change the boot order in your system's BIOS to boot from the desired location.  Once the installation starts, just follow the screens as shown in the images below.  These steps are for all the release mentioned in this answer.  The screens are the same in a way, but look cosmetically different from one release to the next. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource:Ubuntu Help\n\nA: Do you really need the Lubuntu Alternate version? It intended for those computers with less than 160Mb of RAM and / or with less than 4.3GB Hard Disk.\nIf your computer has more RAM and disk space than the above I would recommend giving a try to the 11.10 Desktop version for 32bit or 64bit.\nIf you have a USB Disk Drive you can also burn the ISO to the USB and boot from it to save a CD.\n\nA: It could easily be a bad sector on the CD you burned. \nIf you can access the internet from a different computer, It may be worth burning a new CD and starting the process all over again.\nIt's a strange situation to find yourself in and I hope this helps.\n", "Q: How can I disable the minimize button?

To save bandwidth and data on my Internet plan, I have installed squid-deb-proxy on a desktop, and the client on it and a few other machines I've got. However, based on the post that put me onto this , it sounds like if I take my laptop* to a different network and update it there, the downloaded updates will NOT be automatically copied back to the squid-deb-proxy server when I get back on my network.\nAssuming that this is correct (I will be testing later), is there a way I can stick these packages into the cache so I don't have to download them one more time for other machines in the network?\n\n* As noted in the comments, I could simply make the laptop the proxy server, but in my specific case, the laptop is actually 1) a VM that is not running all the time, 2) in a laptop that is not open all the time. As such, that solution, while a good one, does not work in my case.\n\nA: You could use apt-move (from the package of the same name) to create a local apt repository from the files in your laptop's apt cache. Then use rsync to keep a synced copy of this repository on your LAN. Finally, point other LAN machines to your LAN copy of the local repository at the top of sources.list, so that apt prefers the local repository over remote ones.\n\nA: This still is an incomplete answer, but it might be the best possible answer, so read on if curious about possible partial/ugly/complicated solutions.\nIntriguing question, I've encountered the same problem but I never fixed it, instead I just try to limit my apt-getting outside my local lan. It really wasn't worth the hassle, at most I wasted like 20MB over the last year. My iso torrent seeding makes up for that. But!\n\n\n*\n\n*you could set up a tunnel/proxy between your laptop and home to utilize your home cache (this is a good idea anyway for privacy reasons), but, then you would be dependant on your upload speed. Not only would that be slow, but you would use 2x the bandwidth to download the same thing. 1x going into your lan from the Ubuntu mirrors and 1x out to the coffee shop.\n\n*I propose that it may be possible to run the cache server on your laptop and then use rsync to keep it in sync with your home server. This presents a problem however in that when you are home that server on your laptop will still be running. To deal with that I could see two possibilities. 1. stop the cache server on your laptop while at home 2. keep all the cached copies that exist on your home server on your laptop too (extra space requirements) and accomplish this by not only pushing cached data to your server with when you get home with rsync, but also regularly pulling the cached data down to your laptop server. In suggesting this I have made the assumption that the squid-deb-proxy cache on one server is compatible with another and that you can swap files in and out like that. These options will also certainly require some scripting. The cache for me is located at /var/cache/squid-deb-proxy/ and below that is not immediately human understandable.\n\nA: We use a simple and stupid aproach: the squid-deb-proxy can use itself as a proxy. Therefore I just do:\n\n\n*\n\n*I install the client software on the squid-deb-proxy Server:\napt-get install squid-deb-proxy-client\n\n*I created a simple script which lists all installed packages - and redownload each package:\n#!/bin/bash  \n# Create temp dir & change into it\ntmpdir=$(mktemp -d) \npushd $tmpdir   \n# Get all installed packages and re-download them\nfor package in $(dpkg --get-selections | cut -f 1); do apt-get download $package; done;\npopd\n# Delete tmp dir\n\nThis way we already have a not-so-bad basic cache.\nIf we would like to add all packages of an existing server to the cache, then we just execute the same procedure 1) and 2)\n", "Q: How can I annotate PDFs so notes are compatible with Adobe Reader for Win/OSX? I am looking for a tool which allows me to annotate PDFs in Ubuntu and share the PDFs with annotations with people who use OSX or Windows. I cannot assume that the others can or will install special software to read the annotations.\nI am therefore looking for software which allows me to make annotations in PDfs which are compatible with Adobe Reader.\nWhat good alternatives for Ubuntu exist for this?\n\nA: Look for the package \"xournal\" in the software center or user apt-get to install it. With it you can annotate PDFs and export them as PDF again.\n\nA: Besides Xournal (see m4lvin's reply), you could use PDF XChange Viewer. The free version allows for annoting PDFs, too; it runs without problems using wine.\n\nA: Newer versions of Okular can save annotations directly to the PDF file.\nBy default, the annotations are saved in the local directory for each user. However, if you choose \"File\" -> \"Save as...\" you will be able to save your annotations in a new PDF file, so that they are visible by any other PDF viewer. \n(See http://okular.kde.org/faq.php#annotateandsendtofriend )\n\nA: I was searching for exactly the same. For me, qpdfview works like a charm. Annotations and text highlighting is recognised in Adobe Reader (Linux version 9, Windows. iOS). Editing done on the aforementioned platforms are recognised by qpdfview as well. It allows you to delete annotations and highlighting too, and stores annotations in the PDF.\nIt is free, the source code can be found on launchpad. You find it in the Ubuntu Software Center and there is a ppa for a more recent version: ppa:b-eltzner/qpdfview\n\nA: Pretty old post, but still valid \nHere is a non-open (but free) solution :\nYou can download Foxit Reader, there is now a specific version for Linux and it works fine for Ubuntu\n\n\n*\n\n*Untar the downloaded file\n\n*make the extracted file executable chmod 777 ./FoxitReader.enu.setup.2.4.XXX.x64.run\n\n*just run it and install where you want  ./FoxitReader.enu.setup.2.4.XXX.x64.run\n\n*The software is now installed in \"Office\" Menu\n\n\nA: Assuming you want to stick to free software, I would support the suggestion to use PDF XChange Viewer, and also add that Inkscape works ok for quick annotations to single page PDFs.\nIt would be great to see a native version of the free PDF Xchange Viewer on Linux, but it does run fairly well on wine. If you're willing to pay for a native linux app, there's PDF Studio but it isn't cheap.

Is it because of the upgrade. And how it has been restored programs???\n\nA: Upgrade will keep your (and others) home directory but the installed programs will be purged. You will have to reinstall missing programs but the bright side is that the configuration/preferences for each should be there. Those are being kept in your home folder which is still there.\n\nA: First, I write this for everyone else who reads this: 12.04 is in beta testing and is not ready for production use!  It should be installed with the understanding that it contains bugs and some of those might cause very serious problems, including the loss of important files, including programs and data.  It's a very good beta and the bugs are being worked-out quickly, but I'd recommend that if anyone wants to test it, don't upgrade 11.10 but instead put 12.04 onto its own partition.  If your testing involves upgrading 11.10, you should make a full backup first.  (Lest it sound like I represent anyone else, I don't work for Canonical nor am I involved in any way with the development of Ubuntu; I'm just another beta tester.)\nSecond, however, Yossile is right: your data and the settings for your programs should still be there, so when you reinstall them they should work as you are accustomed.  Unfortunately, it'll take you some time to reinstall them, hopefully not too long.  I hope the process won't be too painful.  I'm sorry this happened.\n\nA: if you did an upgrade from ubuntu 11.10 to ubuntu 12.04 it is possible that some applications are not more suported by canonical or been remove from repositories\ni did also and upgrade from ubuntu 11.10 2 ubuntu 12.04 beta and the programs where stiil there ..but it could be a change from version for exemple firefox i think it change version is now 11.00 i think in ubuntu 11.10 was 10\nbut if all your applications has been remove i dont know how it happen unless you made a fresh instalation using a cd or usb\n", "Q: Can I change the filter options in the video lens?

I assume this is still possible, where is the setting available?\nEDIT:\nIf this isn't possible from the OS, is there a way to script these sorts of changes to BIOS or is this something that requires physical access to the machine on boot to manually edit the settings?.\n\nA: In the BIOS, look for something like \"always restart on power failure\"\nIn Ubuntu, edit /etc/default/grub.\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nand add\nGRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT=5\n\nThen run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis will make your machine display the boot options for 5 seconds before it boot the default option (instead of waiting forever for you to choose one).\n\nA: That's not something you can control in your operating system. That's what the BIOS is for.\nIn most BIOS setups there'll be an option like After power loss with possible values like Power off and Reboot.\n\nA: You would need a Uninterruptible Power Supply - Soft shutdown with an auto boot.\nYou might want to look here : http://www.apcupsd.com/ for a recommendation.\n", "Q: Can I use a USB drive to extend the hard drive space? I need more space on my hard drive and I have an unused 8gb USB stick.\nHow can I use that as an extra hard drive?\n\nA: Short answer: You can't do what I think you're thinking, but it may be that what I think you think you're thinking isn't what you're thinking and so this will be helpful.\nLong answer: You can't extend the partition from your hard drive onto the flash drive, but if you know that your flash drive always mounts to the same location (it will if you don't change it's name), you can put particular folders onto that space using symbolic links. Move the folder you want on the flash drive to the flash drive, then rename (or delete, but that should wait until after a successful test) the copy on your hard drive. Open a terminal and create a symbolic link from the place it was on your hard disk to the place it is on your flash drive. Note that it does not have to be in the same place on your flash drive as it was (for instance, on my Mac I do this with my Steam folder; I put it onto a flash drive so I can use it on multiple computers easily, so long as I keep the flash drive I don't have to re-download)\nFor instance, say you have a lot of content in your Movies folder:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move (or copy and rename the original, preferably) ~/Movies onto your flash drive (name it whatever you want, and it can be in whatever folder you want, I'm saying it's now called \"desktop-movies\" in your flash drive Sparky, which is mounted at /media/Sparky/)\n\n*Open a terminal, run ln -s /media/Sparky/desktop-movies/ ~/Movies to make ~/Movies a link to desktop-movies on /media/Sparky/\n\n*Remember that if you have spaces or other special characters (not including dashes and underscores) in either folder name, precede them with backslashes, and if you have a backslash then convert it into a double backslash.\n\nA: Maybe with a raid 0 ?\nPut your USB and your hdd in a raid 0 \nBut if you ever remove the USB your data is unreadable \n", "Q: What does this kernel panic means?

Any solution?\n\nA: This is more a long comment than an answer.\nYou have an scheduling while atomic bug, this always means that there is a bug in some driver that you are using. It means that some code that was supposed to be atomic (it shouldn't be interrupted) has called the scheduler.\nI can't see from the screenshot what driver is causing the problem.\nAs some kind of workaround you can try the new 12.04 beta, maybe the bug is resolved in it. You can find the Wubi installer inside the ISO. But be careful, it is a beta and there is no guaranty that it will solve your bug.\n\nA: Ok so basically the problem was that when you are using ASUS Zenbook ethernet driver and then you are installing virtualbox, since virtualbox tries to map that driver to its configuration, it leads to a kernel panic for kernel 3.0 ubuntu. I did not upgrade the kernel however I reinstalled Ubuntu and did not install ethernet driver and it is working just fine.

I've seen some suggestions by using gconf-editor but it doesn't seem to work anymore.

I also tried downloading a driver from the Ralink website, but after installing, the card won't scan at all.\nHere are some links to forum threads that I thought were headed in the right direction:\nHow do I get a Ralink RT3060 wireless card working?\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1908542\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1609086\nDiagnostics:\nmorgan@mohi:~/Downloads$ iwconfig\n\nlo        no wireless extensions.\n\neth0      no wireless extensions.\n\nwlan0     IEEE 802.11bgn  ESSID:off/any  \n          Mode:Managed  Access Point: Not-Associated   Tx-Power=20 dBm   \n          Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n          Power Management:off\n\n\nmorgan@mohi:~/Downloads$ iwlist scanning\nlo        Interface doesn't support scanning.\n\neth0      Interface doesn't support scanning.\n\nwlan0     No scan results\n\n\nmorgan@mohi:~/Downloads$ sudo lsmod\nModule                  Size  Used by\nnls_utf8               12493  1 \nisofs                  39549  1 \nbnep                   17923  2 \nrfcomm                 38408  0 \nbluetooth             148839  10 bnep,rfcomm\nbinfmt_misc            17292  1 \nsnd_intel8x0           33318  2 \nsnd_ac97_codec        106082  1 snd_intel8x0\nac97_bus               12642  1 snd_ac97_codec\nsnd_pcm                80435  2 snd_intel8x0,snd_ac97_codec\narc4                   12473  2 \nsnd_seq_midi           13132  0 \nsnd_rawmidi            25241  1 snd_seq_midi\nsnd_seq_midi_event     14475  1 snd_seq_midi\nrt2800pci              18340  0 \nrt2800lib              48909  1 rt2800pci\ncrc_ccitt              12595  1 rt2800lib\nrt2x00pci              14202  1 rt2800pci\nrt2x00lib              48146  3 rt2800pci,rt2800lib,rt2x00pci\njoydev                 17393  0 \nsnd_seq                51567  2 snd_seq_midi,snd_seq_midi_event\nmac80211              393421  3 rt2800lib,rt2x00pci,rt2x00lib\nsnd_timer              28932  2 snd_pcm,snd_seq\nsnd_seq_device         14172  3 snd_seq_midi,snd_rawmidi,snd_seq\nhid_microsoft          12728  0 \ncfg80211              172427  2 rt2x00lib,mac80211\nusbhid                 41905  0 \nhid                    77367  2 hid_microsoft,usbhid\ni915                  509519  3 \nsnd                    55902  11      snd_intel8x0,snd_ac97_codec,snd_pcm,snd_rawmidi,snd_seq,snd_timer,snd_seq_device\nsoundcore              12600  1 snd\neeprom_93cx6           12653  1 rt2800pci\ndrm_kms_helper         32889  1 i915\ndrm                   192194  4 i915,drm_kms_helper\nsnd_page_alloc         14115  2 snd_intel8x0,snd_pcm\ni2c_algo_bit           13199  1 i915\nvideo                  18908  1 i915\nppdev                  12849  0 \npsmouse                73673  0 \nserio_raw              12990  0 \nparport_pc             32114  1 \nlp                     17455  0 \nparport                40930  3 ppdev,parport_pc,lp\ntg3                   132972  0 \nfloppy                 60310  0 \n\nIf I try to compile the driver from CD:\nmorgan@mohi:~/Downloads/2009_0521_RT2860_Linux_STA_V2.1.2.0$ sudo make\nmake -C tools\n...\n\n/home/morgan/Downloads/2009_0521_RT2860_Linux_STA_V2.1.2.0/os/linux/../../os/linux/rt_linux.c:1570:10: error: ‘struct net_device’ has no member named ‘open’\n/home/morgan/Downloads/2009_0521_RT2860_Linux_STA_V2.1.2.0/os/linux/../../os/linux/rt_linux.c:1571:10: error: ‘struct net_device’ has no member named ‘stop’\n/home/morgan/Downloads/2009_0521_RT2860_Linux_STA_V2.1.2.0/os/linux/../../os/linux/rt_linux.c:1572:10: error: ‘struct net_device’ has no member named ‘hard_start_xmit’\n/home/morgan/Downloads/2009_0521_RT2860_Linux_STA_V2.1.2.0/os/linux/../../os/linux/rt_linux.c:1573:10: error: ‘struct net_device’ has no member named ‘do_ioctl’\n/home/morgan/Downloads/2009_0521_RT2860_Linux_STA_V2.1.2.0/os/linux/../../os/linux/rt_linux.c:1579:11: error: ‘struct net_device’ has no member named ‘get_stats’\n/home/morgan/Downloads/2009_0521_RT2860_Linux_STA_V2.1.2.0/os/linux/../../os/linux/rt_linux.c:1613:9: error: ‘struct net_device’ has no member named ‘validate_addr’\nmake[2]: ***      [/home/morgan/Downloads/2009_0521_RT2860_Linux_STA_V2.1.2.0/os/linux/../../os/linux/rt_linux.o] Error 1\nmake[1]: ***     [_module_/home/morgan/Downloads/2009_0521_RT2860_Linux_STA_V2.1.2.0/os/linux] Error 2\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-headers-3.0.0-16-generic'\nmake: *** [LINUX] Error 2\n\nAfter installing driver from website\nmorgan@mohi:~$ iwconfig\nlo        no wireless extensions.\n\neth0      no wireless extensions.\n\nra0       Ralink STA  \n          Link Quality:0  Signal level:0  Noise level:0\n          Rx invalid nwid:0  invalid crypt:0  invalid misc:0\n\n\n\nmorgan@mohi:~$ iwlist scanning\nlo        Interface doesn't support scanning.\n\neth0      Interface doesn't support scanning.\n\nra0       Interface doesn't support scanning.\n\nMany thanks!\n\nA: Ok, yes, you do need to install the driver from Ralink to get that card working. But a much newer version is available. I am using version 4.1.1. I recommend that you find and download that version. It should be available from Ralinktech website.\nOnce you get the driver, expand it into its own directory. From that directory, run \"sudo make\", then \"sudo make install\". Then run \"sudo modprobe rt3562sta\". Your wireless should come up in a few seconds.\nIt is also a good idea to blacklist the default module, rt2800pci.\nAlso, you will have to reinstall this driver after each time the Linux kernel is upgraded to a higher version.\n", "Q: \"Unexporting directories for NFS kernel daemon...\" error prevents reboot / shut down while logged in I am not able to shutdown or reboot;  I get the following error.\n * Unexporting directories for NFS kernel daemon...\nspeech-dispatcher disabled; edit /etc/default/speech-dispatcher\n * Stopping ADC hub uhub\nChecking for running unattended upgrades:\nStopping Webmin server in usr/share/webmin\n * Stopping the Winbind daemon winbind\n * Stopping bluetooth<br>\n... waiting  * Stopping web server apache2\n * Will now halt\n[29856.516087] iwlagn 0000:03:00.0: Queue 9 stuck for 2000 ms.\n[29856.516191] iwlagn 0000:03:00.0: On demand firmware reload\n[29861.533613] iwlagn 0000:03:00.0: Could not load the INST uCode section\n[29861.533718] iwlagn 0000:03:00.0: Failed to start RT ucode: -110\n[29861.533867] iwlagn 0000:03:00.0: Unable to initialize device.\n\n\nIt happens if any user tries it after logging in.\nIf I don't login at the lightdm screen on power on and execute shutdown or reboot I can.\nHowever, if I login even from a remote terminal I can't reboot.\n\nA: 这个问题我之前也遇到过，可以选择Ubuntu启动盘启动，选择修复模式可以更正系统出现的一些硬件不能驱动的问题。\nGoogle Translate: \n\nI had also encountered this problem, you can choose\n  the Ubuntu boot disk, select repair mode can correct some of the\n  hardware system can not be driven.\n\n", "Q: Getting weird split screen on startup with msi radeon hd6450? I had this problem with same card last month on my dads dual boot setup to where the card worked in windows but not in ubuntu.Tonight I got a new system running with this card I installed ubuntu as only os and the install went fine,but upon reboot and first entering ubuntu my screen is split in half where my unity bar is in the middle.Can anyone tell me how to step by step install what I need to do to get everything in working order with this card?I really cant access much because ubuntu wont let me and i am pretty much a newbie still.I did read from one of my questions about my dads about compatible ati cards and it is listed but how can I install the drivers I need if my screen is split?\n\nA: I'm not sure how your screen is split, but I think there is a keyboard way to get there.\nHit the Super Key (aka Windows Key).  That should open the dash.\nType Additional Drivers and hit Enter.  That should open the Additional Drivers window.\nNow this is where I don't know how to go on just with the keyboard.  This is what the Additional Drivers window looks like on my system, but yours will have some differences.\n\nYou can see where the buttons are so you might, through a bit of experimentation, find where to click to do what you need.  The \"Remove\" button on the lower-right was, before the drivers were activated, an \"Activate\" button; it's possible that it's the only button you'll need to press, but be careful you don't delete the drivers from something else (such as a wireless adapter).  I don't know, but you might also have to choose to download the drivers, although they're probably already there.\n", "Q: What is a \"bad quality\" package? What does it mean to have a Bad Quality Package (What qualities would it have to be a Bad quality package) and what happens if I install a package that has bad quality but still installs.\n\n\nA: The package is of bad quality\n\"The installation of a package which violates the quality standards isn't allowed. This could cause serious problems on your computer. Please contact the person or organisation who provided this package file and include the details beneath.\"\nSometimes, the packages are really of bad quality but most of the time, it is just a false positive. There is not much we can do to check the quality of those packages but if you trust the source, you can try these alternatives for package installation.\nBad quality also suggests corruption when downloading such as dropped packets or intermittent Internet access.\n\n*\n\n*Fix the problem\n\nInstallation using GDebi Package Manager\nsudo apt-get install gdebi gdebi-core\n\nA: this answer was written for developers, as I answered it in another question which moderators seems to have merged...\nSo if I'm understanding you correctly, you're packaging up a piece of software, but installers like Software Centre are complaining about the package quality.\nTry using Lintian when packaging, as that's the tool checking at installation time as well. In short, it's a\n\nDebian package checker. It can be used to check binary and source packages for compliance with the Debian policy and for other common packaging errors.\n\nExample:\n$ lintian -i packagename.deb\nW: packagename: package-name-doesnt-match-sonames packagename\nN: \nN:    The package name of a library package should usually reflect the soname\nN:    of the included library. The package name can determined from the\nN:    library file name with the following code snippet:\nN:    \nN:     $ objdump -p /path/to/libfoo-bar.so.1.2.3 | sed -n -e's/^[[:space:]]*SONAME[[:space:]]*//p' | sed -e's/\\([0-9]\\)\\.so\\./\\1-/; s/\\.so\\.//'\nN:    \nN:    Severity: normal, Certainty: possible\nN:    \nN:    Check: binaries, Type: binary, udeb\nN:\n\nWhen you're building the package using debuild (as you should), you can't even build a package with errors in the first place, so my best guess is that you're building it the wrong way. debuild runs Lintian over the source package and during the build process you'll see the output too:\n$ debuild -S\n[...]\nNow running lintian...\nW: packagename source: debian-rules-missing-recommended-target build-arch\nW: packagename source: debian-rules-missing-recommended-target build-indep\nFinished running lintian.\n[...]\n\nIf you have lines starting with E:, you have serious errors in it, which will prevent you from distributing packages the regular way. They simply need have a certain degree of quality.\n\nA: You can see why a particular package is considered a bad quality by looking at the details provided in that dialog box. It usually has to deal with how a package is packaged and not the package itself. \nIf the package doesn't meet the Debian policy, then it is considered to be of a poor quality.\nSome common issues that trigger this warning are:\n\n\n*\n\n*The package has some file ownership errors\n\n*There is no valid \"Installed-size\" field in the control file, etc.\n\n\nA: This page at WebUpd8 has information that might be useful for you.  If the package is a \".deb\" file there is a fix listed there.  The general explanation, from that page, is this:\n\nsometimes, those packages are indeed of bad quality, but most of the\n  times are just simple errors in the package description and such,\n  which do not affect you. Either way, install them at your own risk!\n\n\nA: The meaning can vary from deb to deb, it basically means something is missing / not packaged 100% right. \nYou can install it either using dpkg:\nAssuming you've downloaded the .deb in your ~/Downloads folder, run the following commands in a terminal to install all the .deb files:\ncd ~/Downloads\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nOr use Gdebi. Install Gdebi first:\nsudo apt-get install gdebi gdebi-core\n\nYou can then right click a .deb file and select \"Open with Gdebi Package Installer\".\nI've actually posted about this a few hours ago: How To Install .Deb Files When Getting \"The package is of bad quality\" Error In Ubuntu Software Center\n\nA: To make sure that packages we install using the Software Center are free of errors and Debian policy violations they are checked using Lintian. Only then the installation of a package will be granted. \nIn case there is no option to override this we may install packages via other more traditional paths.\n\nThe \"bad quality\" error of USC helps to pick non-standard packages and to warn us about them not entirely meeting the Debian policy. It is a good idea to check the package before installing it with lintian. That exactly is what the Software Center does too:\nlintian name_of_package.deb\n\nYou will then see errors (E) or warnings (W) that indiciate what exactly are the weaknesses of your package the Software Center complains about. In the example case above it is the file permissions set to a wrong user or group ID. In case the package does not replace system files this should not affect your overall system stability and thus is unlikely to be a risk to your installation. However wrong permission may be a cause of a newly installed application not running as expected.\nA \"bad quality package\" most probably does not affect your overall system stability or break your system. This is even less so when you trust your source. There even is a list maintained by Debian that shows occurences of Lintian tags in packages from the Debian archives.\nNevertheless it is a good idea to find out what exactly is wrong before we install such a package. This will also help you filing a bug report to give packaging people a chance to fix it.\n\nA: Your System might break. After installing the package the system may not start properly or some components in the system might not function as expected\n", "Q: OpenCV will not install due to libgtk2.0-dev dependencies I am trying to install OpenCV on Ubuntu 10.10 to use it with python.\nThe problem that I am facing is related to installing gtk2.0-dev.\nI always get the following error\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\nlibgtk2.0-dev : Depends: libglib2.0-dev (>= 2.25.8) but it is not going to be installed\n         Depends: libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev (>= 2.21.0) but it is not going to be installed\n         Depends: libpango1.0-dev (>= 1.20) but it is not going to be installed\n         Depends: libatk1.0-dev (>= 1.29.2) but it is not going to be installed\n         Depends: libcairo2-dev (>= 1.6.4-6.1) but it is not going to be installed\n\nI tried to do everything what I found on the web to overcome the problem.

But I already installed a lot of softwares from software center and also updated my Ubuntu.\nIs there any way I could install this softwares offline?  I don't wanna download them again with my low speed internet :-( \n\nA: If you just need a swap partition, you could resize your existing partition, create a new swap partition and add that to your installation's /etc/fstab. There is only a limited chance that things might go wrong (so back up!!) but it's fairly quick and painless.\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up anything you can't easily replace.\n\n*Boot into a LiveCD or LiveUSB. This can be downloaded from Ubuntu.com - You've already installed once so you should be familiar with the process. Select \"Try Ubuntu\" when asked.\n\n*Load up GParted Partition Editor\n\n*Select your partition, right click it and click Resize. Resize it down to give you enough space for the new swap partition. How much of that largely depends on how much RAM you have. You need at least as much swap as you have RAM but most people say 1.5x is safer so if you have 4GB of RAM, you probably want 6GB of swap.\n\n*In the space at the end of the disk, right click and create a new partition. Set its format to linux-swap and click add.\n\n*Click the big green Tick and it will shrink your disk and create the new partition. When you're done there, reboot to your normal system.\n\n*Now you need the UUID of the new swap partition. You can see all the UUIDs by running ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid in a terminal and you're looking for something like a2d579b4-6ecd-1111-a612-2d11adbd11aa. If you have a lot of disks you might need to run Disk Utility to work out which is which.\n\n*In a terminal run sudoedit /etc/fstab and add something like the following line:\nUUID=a2d579b4-6ecd-1111-a612-2d11adbd11aa none    swap    sw     0       0\n\nThough you want to replace the UUID with your swap partition's UUID from Step 7.\n\n*You can either reboot or run sudo mount -a && sudo swapon -a and you should have mounted swap space. Hurray!\n\nA: *\n\n*First make full backup of your home directory into other drive or safe media.\n\n*Then clean install your new Ubuntu distribution.\n\n*Restore your home directory.\n\n*Don't worry about software - just install it again later - so you will have fresh copy of software for your new Ubuntu distribution.\nTo read: Ubuntu Community Documentation > Installing Software \n\n*I do not recommend you to install software \"offline\".

Recently did a reinstall with a new profile and I've just copied back over my Wine install. Everything works but I don't have menus for any of it.\nDoes anybody know how to selectively copy back menu items from an old installation?\n\nA: The short answer is a combination of ~/.config/menus and ~/.local/share/applications. The first stores the menu configuration while the second stores the .desktop shortcut files that the menu displays.\n\n\n*\n\n*Start with the desktop files. Wine (thankfully) creates its own subdirectory at ~/.local/share/applications/wine so you can copy that straight over. For other applications, you might have to be a bit more selective about things.\n\n\nThis unfortunately doesn't make the launchers trusted. The quickest way I've found to do that is by running this little hack:\nfind ~/.local/share/applications -name '*.desktop' | sed 's, ,\\\\&,g' | xargs sudo chmod ugo+rx\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Then copy over the relevant menu configs and reload the menus. Unity probably needs unity --replace and if you're using panels as I am, killall gnome-panel does the trick.\n\n*Oh and you need to merge in the icons too. They're sitting in ~/.local/share/icons.\n\nA: The applications shown in your Dash are located in /usr/share/applications. The files located there are \"desktop configuration files\". To add an application from wine or any other location, just copy one of the existing applications and paste it in the /usr/share/applications folder. Now you can right click and choose properties. \nMake sure the application you want to add to the Dash has it's property window open for easy copy and pasting into the copied app's properties window (you're replacing the file location to reflect the application's path to be added to Dash). Change the description if you want and click on the icon in the properties window to replace it with one for the application your adding. When you're finished tap enter and close the properties window. You should now have it in the Dash.\nNote:\nYou can open a terminal window and type sudo nautilus press and press enter to open a file manager window with root privileges so you can make the copy and changes to the properties. Be sure to close out of the window when you're finished.\n", "Q: Update Gedit to 2.32 being able to use SyncTeX on 11.04?

I really need date created for folders/files. As far as I can see, this is not possible at present. Just an option in preferences of given file manager will suffice. Anybody? \n\nA: There is no creation time for a file. It isn't stored anywhere. Files have a last-modified time and last-accessed time that can be presented in the files manager.\nThere is though an inode change time that is often referred to as the \"creation time\" but that's not accurate as some activities (like backup) will modify this date.\n", "Q: How do I preseed Postfix's mailname? I don't want postfix to ask for its mailname i just want it to use its fqdn name.\nThis is my preseed file\n\nA: Setting the mailname to a fixed value is easy, by adding this to your preseed file:\npostfix postfix/mailname string your-preferred-mailname\n\nHowever, that isn't quite what you asked: you asked for it just to use your FQDN (which is the default value for the question).  That's a bit trickier.  Whether a debconf question is asked is controlled by a combination of the question's priority and the \"seen\" flag.  However, just setting the \"seen\" flag will suppress the normal behaviour of picking up the default value from your FQDN, which isn't what you want.\nI think you therefore have two reasonable answers.  Firstly, you could set the debconf priority to critical during installation, by using the 'priority=critical' boot parameter.  That ensures that you will only get asked questions whose answers the installer can't do without.  For most people, this is a good option when preseeding.\nHowever, if for some reason you can't do this, you could use a computed preseed entry.  This is trickier; you have to make sure to fetch the FQDN after network configuration happens.  A safe, if hacky, way to do this is to abuse a hook provided at the start of partitioning:\nd-i partman/early_command string \\\n  echo \"postfix postfix/mailname string $(hostname --fqdn)\" >/tmp/computed-preseed.cfg; \\\n  debconf-set-selections /tmp/computed-preseed.cfg\n\n(I think this should work, but I haven't tested it.  Please confirm!)\n\nA: \nWhen your mail server connects to another mail server to transfer\n  messages it performs a HELO which sends it's hostname to the other\n  server. This is one of the reasons your hostname is so important. In\n  fact, many servers in order to verify the integrity of mail exchanges\n  will do a DNS lookup to verify the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)\n  matches what if provided in the HELO. If they do not match some\n  servers will not allow the transfer of mail. Therefore, make sure your\n  FQDN is what is present in the HELO.\n\nPostfix requires a fully qualified domain name or FQDN. A FQDN includes the hostname of the server as well as the domain name like this:\nmail.example.com\n\nPostfix provides a utility that enables you to change the hostname into a FQDN. Use the command postconf with the -e option for editing Here is an example:\npostconf -e myhostname=mail.hello.org\n\nas a side note:\ncan you add the main.cf?\n", "Q: How to setup a PPTP VPN connection? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I set up a PPTP VPN on my own Ubuntu Server? \n\nI need to connect my Ubuntu Server 11.04 to a PPTP VPN.

Usually in Ubuntu you don't directly deal with /usr/bin directory when installing a new program. If you come from the Windows world then usually you don't extract program to Program Files and start using it. You execute the installation wizard to do the installation for you.\nSame here. You can install a program by searching it in the Software Center and clicking the install button.\nIn cases, like yours, where the software was downloaded from a website you usually download a .deb file that you can install by opening a terminal and executing sudo dpkg -i <filename>.deb.\nMake sure you've downloaded the Ubuntu package and for the right architecture (32-bit / 64-bit).\n", "Q: Nothing shows up in the terminal when I type my password When I'm about to install a program in the terminal it wants the password:\n[sudo] password for xxx:\n\nBut when I start to type my password nothing happens. What should I do?\n\nA: Password is not shown when you write it in the terminal after the sudo command but it is still read. Is this the case here? i.e. have you tried to give your password and press Enter?\n\nA: Nothing is supposed to happen, just type the password and hit Enter.\n\nA: When using the terminal, for security reasons (Like if someone is standing just behind you and has nothing else to do but stare at your screen while you type a password) you will never see your typed password. You are effectively typing it even if you don't see it.\nSo just type your password and press ENTER\n\nHere I am checking one of my drives. As you can see, it would look like I did not type my password but I indeed have. \n\nA: Even though no characters appear when you type your password, you are actually typing your password.\nSo type password, then hit Enter and see the magic.\n\nA: For security reasons, characters typed in at the password request prompt are not echoed back to the terminal.\nType your password and hit enter.  The characters are there, you just can't see them, that's all.\n\nA: Don't worry, it is a common and positive behavior.\nBecause the output of any software can be logged to a permanent storage (like the hard disk) in a format readable by humans, the Linux libraries used by most terminal softwares (in your case the login utility with the PAM system) have a security feature that hides the passwords from the screen: the password is memorized and - if the software is well made - encrypted in memory when you press RETURN but even while typing the output does not arrive to the standard output.\nThis both prevents passive screen logging and people near you from catching the password. Have a nice day and remember to type quickly, because anyone can still see your physical keyboard! :-)\n\nImportant: when you see a password field, insert the root password only if the application is trusted; never publish or save your root password, even if the password field seems secure and does not show any letter.\n\nA: For security reasons there is no feedback of passwords given in the terminal. Read the following discussion on reasoning behind this and why this will not be implemented:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bug #194472: Entering password in Terminal gives no visual feedback\nIn this discussion, and also given in the answer to a corresponding question at superuser\n\n\n*\n\n*Feedback when typing password at a sudo prompt\nThere is an option to enable password feedback for sudo and only for sudo by editing options in the sudoers file.\n\nWarning: The instructions below are for advanced users only. If something goes wrong when editing the sudoers file, and this file is inaccessible or malformed you will have effectively locked out yourself and any other administrator users of performing any administrative tasks in your system. It is not a good idea to do this on a productive system.\n\nTo enable password feedback by asterisks * when running the sudo command we have to edit the sudoers file with\nsudo visudo\n\nWe then will have to add pwfeedback to the default options as shown below:\nDefaults        env_reset,pwfeedback\n\n\nA: Passwords are hidden so no-one can see over your shoulder when you enter it.

I'm thinking repartitioning and installing Ubuntu,.. then from there start something like Zen to 'boot' into windows to run my windows app.. while being able to do things like search thru the windows file system from Ubuntu.. \nCan you please help with details/links on how to do this satisfying the constraints above? Thanks for your help.\n\nA: If I understand correctly, you need to run Ubuntu and Windows at the same time?\nIf that's the case, then I would recommend that you install VirtualBox. It is a free software virtualization solution that's available for Windows, Linux, OS X and Solaris. It's quite user friendly and efficient. \nSince Virtualbox can run on all those platforms, you can choose which to have as a main operating system. In your case, I think I'd recommend running Ubuntu in the virtual machine, because it's far easier to convert to a \"real\" install later. It's also usually much faster as a virtualized guest than Windows is. I'd then try to use Ubuntu as much as possible, converting tools as you're able to, and then – when you feel ready – move the Ubuntu system onto the host itself as a normal install. That's very easy, and you'll find many documents describing how. \nAn advantage of running Ubuntu as the host is that you can run the Windows desktop as a seemless workspace, which means it'll be more comfortable if you need to switch between them frequently. If you decide to convert the Windows install, check your licenses first. \nIf you use Windows XP, then converting is extremely difficult. Windows 7 is said to be easier, but I haven't tried it myself. After spending three days converting a simple XP system, I've tried very hard to avoid ever having to do it again. \n\nA: Depending on your system specifiations, you can:\nDual boot\nYour best bet in terms of performance etc on both OSes is to set up a dual boot system ( \"No root filesystem is defined\" while installing Ubuntu ). This will allow you to use both Ubuntu and Windows, but you'll have to reboot each time you want to use the other OS.\nVirtualization\nYou mentioned that you are using MatLab on Windows, so maybe this isn't for you, but you can install one OS inside a virtual machine (VM) using virtualization software (e.g., Virtualbox). This is great if you need to use both OSes simultaneously but you won't get the best performance if you are running intensive tasks, and you will want to have good hardware and lots of RAM in your computer so can can allocate as many resources as you need to to the virtual machine.\nWubi\nAs you mentioned, Wubi is another option too. See What's the difference between Wubi and a regular \"alongside Windows\" installation?\n\nA: Virtual Box. Simple and easy. Install Vbox on Windows and use it to install Ubuntu. You can even use the seamless mode of Vbox and it looks pretty cool\n", "Q: Install wizard flickering dialog: \"Wired Network - Disconnected - You are now offline\" I'm installing a fresh copy of Ubuntu Linux version 11.10.  When going through the install wizard, there is a black popup in the top right hand corner of the screen that keeps flickering randomly and says \"Wired Network Disconnected - you are now offline\".

I have tried writing iso images at higher speeds but the iso file gets corrupted (knew because checked the integrity of it right after the boot up) and I have gone through this process for four times.\n\nA: You will only be able to burn a cd at a speed as low as 4x if the media supports it; if not, programs will not be able to give you the option, but they will present to you the lowest speed that the disk is rated for (usually 10x or 16x today).\nPeople have tried to force command-line programs such as cdrecord and wodim (a fork of cdrecord) to record at a lower speed, but have not succeeded as these discussions and these at the Ubuntu forums show.\nIt is also unnecessary to burn an iso at such a low speed as 4x; the websites that tell you to do this contain outdated information. It is likely your problem lies in the software you are using rather than the speed of the burn. You mention active iso burner and free iso burner and yet those are both Windows programs; are you trying to do it in Wine or Windows? If you are actually using Ubuntu (and I'll continue my answer for the benefit of the Ubuntu users), I should use the command-line to burn the iso correctly. Install wodim with\nsudo apt-get install wodim\n\nThen place your media in the drive and find out about the speeds supported with \nwodim -prcap dev=/dev/sr1\n\nWhich will give something like this:\nNumber of supported write speeds: 5\n  Write speed # 0:  8467 kB/s CLV/PCAV (CD  48x, DVD  6x)\n  Write speed # 1:  7056 kB/s CLV/PCAV (CD  40x, DVD  5x)\n  Write speed # 2:  5645 kB/s CLV/PCAV (CD  32x, DVD  4x)\n  Write speed # 3:  4234 kB/s CLV/PCAV (CD  24x, DVD  3x)\n  Write speed # 4:  2822 kB/s CLV/PCAV (CD  16x, DVD  2x)\n\nThe lowest here is 16x, which is write speed 4, so with this knowledge you can enter the following and burn an iso (subsituting your drive device name): \nwodim -eject -tao speed=4 dev=/dev/sr1 -v -data /my/iso/location.iso\n\nOccasionally the speed setting is not honoured on some drives by wodim, so if not, just choose the lowest speed in a gui burner program such as k3b or Xfburn.\n\nA: Try using Brasero. When the dialog box for burning images comes change then speed to the lowest as you wish. 4x speed is possible in Brasero!\n", "Q: I want to remove a broken windows 7 boot option from grub but grub customizer generates an error at startup I have two options for Windows 7 in GRUB but one is broken and just says \"CTRL-ALT-DEL to restart.\" the other Windows 7 option works just fine.\nHere is the error message that grub customizer is giving me\ngrub-mkconfig couldn't be executed successfully. error message:\n Generating grub.cfg ...\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.0.0-16-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.0.0-16-generic\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.0.0-12-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.0.0-12-generic\nAdding Windows\nAdding Windows\n/etc/grub.d/11_Windows.save: 9: ^K: not found\n\nA: As root, edit the file /etc/default/grub,  remove the bad entry, something like:\nmenuentry 'Windows 7'\n\nThen sudo update-grub.\n", "Q: Why is the LibreOffice icon just an X with a circle around it? The LibreOffice icon looks OK from within the menu or launchers, but in the window decoration and in the dock it turns into a big X with a circle around it. \nI'm using Kubuntu 11.10, by the way, with the 4.8 backports PPA. \n\nA: \nbcooksley is telling on the KDE Forum: http://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=11834\n\nThat is because the application itself needs to set it's icon. If the\n  application does not set one ( an XImage I believe ) then KDE provides\n  it's default X logo.

How do you maximize sound volume in Gnome Shell under Ubuntu 11.10?\nI have a Macbook, and my sound and volume keys generally work, but even if I use the volume keys to set volume to 100%, the sound is very low. However, if I open the Sound dialog, the \"Output Volume\" slider goes up to 150%, which allows me to comfortably hear sound. Unfortunately, if I use the volume keys thereafter, it practically mutes the sound again, and doesn't let me increase the volume to 150% without first opening the Sound Settings dialog. I know how to use System Settings to increase volume beyond 100%. What I want is for 100% to actually be the true 100% so when I use the volume key to increase volume, it doesn't decrease volume. e.g. If I set it to 150%, and then press the \"increase volume\" key, the volume goes down to 100%.\nI've found plenty of solutions for getting sound working in general, but nothing for this specific case where 100% volume does not actually represent full volume. I'm not sure how else to describe this, or what specifically I should be searching for to resolve it on my own.\n\nA: I think the problem the OP is having is that even though he sets the audio to max, every time he uses the hardware volume keys it lowers the volume again.\nOne possible thing to check is whether it's the PCM or Master volume being altered. Install gnome-alsa-mixer to check.\nScreenshot: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1140666/screenshots-do-not-remove/Gnome-alsa-mixer-Screenshot%20at%202012-03-12%2004%3A23%3A40.png\n\nA: I believe maximising your volume could be achieved in the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Settings through the User Indicator on Top Far Right.\n\n*Select Sound in System Settings\n\n*At the top of the Sound Diaglog toggle your volume past the 100% mark to a setting that meets your needs.\nI have attached the following screenshot to assist you:\n!http://i.imgur.com/Yoweg.png\n", "Q: Installed Plasma widgets and login screens don't show up I downloaded some login screens and Plasma widgets from System Settings in Kubuntu, but they don't show up as selectable options.

Can someone point me in the direction of an API resource for notes please?\n\nA: Ubuntu One implements Tomboy's REST synchronisation API, which is documented here:\nhttps://live.gnome.org/Tomboy/Synchronization/REST/1.0\nUses https://one.ubuntu.com/notes/ as the base URL for your API requests (i.e. so the initial request would go to https://one.ubuntu.com/notes/api/1.0/).\nAs described in the Tomboy spec, you will need to authenticate using OAuth using the entry points returned by the API.  I don't think we've got a system set up to allow you to register consumer keys yet, but you should be able to use Tomboy's default consumer key and secret of anyone and anyone in the interim.\nWe are in the process of building our developer web site, so this information should be available there in the future.\n", "Q: is there an IDE and compiler for c# in ubuntu? \nPossible Duplicate:\nVisual Studio style tool? \n\nI'm looking for an IDE and compiler for C# in linux like visual studio or... to design forms an run programs.\nI'm moved to linux newly.\n\nA: If you already have experience with Visual Studio, your best bet is to use Mono. Mono is a Visual Studio equivalent for Linux, compatible with Visual Basic and C# code, a great thing for a beginner Ubuntu user that was a .Net programmer on Windows. Eclipse IDE is also a great and very powerful programming tool also compatible with C#. Both are available through the Ubuntu Software Center. If you are wanting a way to develop programs through a graphical interface quickly, your best bet is Quickly, also available through the software center. It uses python however, not C#. But it is very beginner-friendly and is the quickest way to start making apps for Ubuntu. Beyond that, do some searching in the software center and see if there's an alternative that you like better. Try Em all out, if you want. Hope that helps!\nSome screenshots:\nMono:\n\nEclipse:\n\nQuickly:\n\nMore information on developing for Ubuntu can be found at developer.ubuntu.com.\n\nA: You can run the Eclipse IDE on Ubuntu (look for it in the Ubuntu Software Centre)and there are plugins for C# development - see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/145484/looking-for-up-to-date-eclipse-plugin-for-c-sharp\n", "Q: Prioritize PPA/repos with the same host I'm using GIMP every day (on 11.10). Because of this, I need the Single-Window mode feature.\nSo, I've added the matthaeus123/mrw-gimp-svn PPA, but as you see the description:\n\nGIMP 2.7.5 Will not work with the current glib and gtk in Oneiric. To\n  fix the problem install these repos\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/gnome3-team/gnome3/ubuntu oneiric main\n\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ricotz/testing/ubuntu oneiric main\n\n\nI had to install them. The Gnome3 repo is quite OK, but the Ricotz Testing is full of new unity and other not needed update.\nAs the result of the previous, I'm experiencing some UI inconveniences. (Eg. the backgrounds and the text colors of the indicators' menus are nearly the same - so hard to read them.)\n(As it is shown there:)\n\nYou are getting bleeding edge snapshots! You should have a stable\n  experience most of the time, but there will be problems!\n\nI've googled around about repo prioritizing, and I've found the repo host pin option:\n Package: *\n Pin: origin \"ftp.debian.org\"\n Pin-Priority: 400\n\nIt is too much! I've other PPAs, whose are OK. I wanna just the bad one: ricotz/testing.\nI've heard about PPA-Purge. So the downgrade won't be a problem. I just wonder the prioritizing of the repos, OR other sources of GIMP Single-Window mode+Gnome Shell(3).\nPlease help me! Thank you!\n\nA: I think the best answer to this problem is going to be \"Upgrade to 12.04.\" If you want to install and use gnome-shell, and other newer applications, it's best to upgrade to the newer version of Ubuntu, which already has most everything you want. While the PPA is installable on Oneiric, it will break other default applications on the system, which are not designed to work with the newer versions, as they weren't part of Ubuntu at the time. If it's just the newer versions of glib and gtk+ which are necessary, then it's probably best if the PPA owner copied those packages to his PPA, rather than telling you to add other PPAs. How did he even get the package built in his PPA, if it requires newer versions which aren't in it? Sounds like the PPA and that gimp package is broken, as it apparently isn't depending on the newer versions.\nAs an alternative, you could create your own PPA on Launchpad, copy the glib/gtk+ packages in from the gnome3 PPA, then copy the gimp in from this PPA and have it rebuild against the new glib/gtk+ once they are in your PPA and published. Then simply add your own PPA and upgrade from there. You could also set up daily builds of the new GIMP trunk code, but that is a bit more involved.\n\nA: According to this site, there's a new ppa for gimp. Seems to be working fine, installation instructions are the following:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:otto-kesselgulasch/gimp\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gimp\n\n\nA: Maybe the simplest way around this is to apt-get update.  Not do an apt-get upgrade.  \nThen apt-get install the gimp version you want, so it only pulls in the direct dependencies.  \nThen remove the ppas from the source list.  \nIt should get you by another few weeks until 12.04 gets here.\n", "Q: USB HD enclosure \"sleeps\", file system errors ensue, can't remount, device disappears.

Unfortunately there is no integration with Nautilus 3.2. This means, I can't right click on files and select an option to open them in Meld for comparison.\nI have seen in the tools comment that the tool need the diff-ext package to be installed. This package has been removed from Ubuntu universe, I am guessing because gtk 3.0. Even if I manually downloaded from source forge the diff-ext package, when I try to configure it the check fails with the message:\nchecking for DIFF_EXT... configure: error: Package requirements (libnautilus-extension >= 2.14.0 gconf-2.0 >= 2.14.0 gnome-vfs-module-2.0 >= 2.14) were not met:\n\nNo package 'libnautilus-extension' found\nNo package 'gconf-2.0' found\nNo package 'gnome-vfs-module-2.0' found\n\nOk, so from this output I gather that indeed gtk 2 is being required to install the diff extension to nautilus.\nNow, my question is: Is there a possibility to integrate Meld into Nautilus? Or, are there any other diff based tool which integrate with current Nautilus?

The clipboard text could have been copied from another file on your system though--making this an eligible answer.\nFile differences are highlighted using bash's native diff command and then displayed using gedit.

Type man diff in the terminal for the manual pages or info diff for more even more command usage details.\n\nA: You can also install the nautilus-compare package, available (starting with Ubuntu 12.04) from the standard Ubuntu package repositories -- run the following from a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-compare\n\nThis provides nautilus menu options for 2-way and 3-way comparisons.  Meld is used by default, but any user-defined diff application can be used.\nA significant advantage of this solution is that one can compare files or folders located in different directories (e.g. /home/user/a/b/c/file.txt and /home/user/d/e/f/otherfile.txt can be opened in different Nautilus windows, and compared against each other).\n", "Q: How do I tunnel and browse the server webpage on my laptop? I run a web app in one of my lab servers, and I have already setup X11 Forwarding on those machines. Other lab members can tunnel through SSH, and browse that web app on their local browser at home.\nI can't. Last time I checked with them, there is almost nothing I need to do.\nWhen I type 192.168.1.113/webapp I get nothing. \nAny tips?\nTHanks.\n\nI ended up using the second method :)\nssh -L 8080:<server-ip-address>:80 <username>@<remote-addr> -N\n\n\nA: There are two ways you can do this with SSH.\nTunnel Everything with a SOCKS proxy\nLog in to the remote machine using the following command:\nssh -D 8080 remote-host\n\nNow go to your browser's proxy settings, and configure it to use a SOCKS proxy with host name 127.0.0.1 and port 8080 (or whatever port you passed to the -D option).  Now all pages you load in your web browser will be tunnelled through the SSH connection.  You should now be able to access the private web page in the same way you would from the remote host.\nOnce you are done, set your browser's proxy settings back to normal.\nOne down side of this method is that all other traffic in the web browser will also be going through the SSH connection.  On the upside, you can access the remote servers with their real host names, and can easily access multiple private sites.\nTunnel a single port.\nThe alternative method is to use SSH to forward a single port:\nssh -L 8080:server-hostname:80 remote-host\n\nNow if you point your web browser at http://localhost:8080/, you should see the contents of http://server-hostname/ as it would appear from the remote host.\nThe benefit of this method is that it leaves the rest of the browser traffic alone.  The downside is that some links might not work if the remote site uses absolute URL references.  If the site mostly uses relative URL references, then this method should be sufficient.\nFor both of these solutions, there is nothing special about the port 8080.  You can use any free local port number you want, as long as you remember to use the same one in the ssh invocation and in the web browser.\n", "Q: Need advice on samba shares and permissions I'm trying to achieve the following, in order to access samba shares from a Windows XP box:\nLive users get a home directory which can be accessed with full permissions through samba if they are authenticated as the owner. I have this working with the following samba config settings:\n####### Authentication #######\n\n   security = user\n   encrypt passwords = yes\n   passdb backend = tdbsam\n   obey pam restrictions = yes\n   unix password sync = yes\n   passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u\n   passwd chat = *Enter\\snew\\s*\\spassword:* %n\\n *Retype\\snew\\s*\\spassword:* %n\\n *password\\supdate$\n   pam password change = yes\n   map to guest = bad user\n\n####### Shares #######\n\n[homes]\n   comment = %S\n   path = /home/%S\n   allow hosts = 127. 192.168.1.\n   valid users = %S\n   browseable = yes\n   writable = yes\n   create mask = 0700\n   directory mask = 0700\n\nThis is pretty much working a expected, apart from the right permissions being set when I create files and directories. But I read some other answers that talk about tinkering with different mask variants. So I'll probably get that fixed, so: so far so good.\nWhat I'd like to have additionally, is another folder (music) that can be accessed with full permissions by me (let's say myusername), and only read permissions by guests (that don't need to authenticate to access these folders).\nI created a group called music and a user called music with a home directory /home/music, and also added myusername to the group music. Then I tried the following samba config:\n[music]\n   comment = %S\n   path = /home/music\n   allow hosts = 127. 192.168.1.\n   browsable = yes\n   writable = yes\n   read list = @music\n   write list = myusername\n   create mask = 0700\n   directory mask = 0700\n\nHowever, logging in on this samba directory as myusername from Windows XP didn't let me create files and/or directories. Could this be because of conflicts with the [homes] setting (since it is already referring to directories in /home as well)? Or am I misunderstanding the principles of user/group permissions?\nApart from that, I also started thinking: do I even need to create the group and user music to begin with? It appears to be a bit redundant when they wouldn't have write access to begin with anyway. Couldn't I simply create the directory /home/music with sudo (or another suggestion perhaps?), and use the above samba settings.\nWhichever way, I do like to have this folder on the /home partition (it's on a separate HDD being the only partition on that HDD). I consider this kind of as my 'data' partition, not merely 'user data'. Or is that frowned upon, in general?\nAs you can see, I'm having a bit of difficulty with thinking of a good permissions strategy and coming up with the right samba config setting.\nCould you shed some light on how I could best achieve what I am trying to accomplish?\n\nA: OK, so thus far I've managed to, kind of, get what I wanted by creating a directory in myusername called music. I deleted the group and user music (and its home directory) altogether.\nSo now my home structure is:\n- /home\n   - /myusername\n     - /music\n   - /otherusername\n   - /andanotherusername\n\nAnd I managed to get fully accessible user home directories with (as I already had):\n[homes]\n   comment = %S\n   path = /home/%S\n   allow hosts = 127. 192.168.1.\n   valid users = %S\n   browseable = no\n   writable = yes\n   create mask = 0700\n   directory mask = 0700\n\nAnd a directory music being read only for guests and fully accessible for myusername with:\n[music]\n   comment = %S\n   path = /home/myusername/music\n   allow hosts = 127. 192.168.1.\n   browsable = yes\n   guest ok = yes\n   guest account = nobody\n   read list = nobody\n   write list = myusername\n   create mask = 0755\n   directory mask = 0700\n\nIt still feels a bit weird to have to have a subdirectory in the myusername home directory though. Preferably I'd like to have the music directory not being tied to myself.\nI wanted to answer my own question as a suggestion for others who might want to achieve similar things.\nI'd still welcome better suggestions though.\n", "Q: How do you create a custom application launcher in Gnome Shell?   How do you create a custom application launcher in Gnome Shell?\nI have a local Eclipse installation that I'd like to be to quickly launch. So I created a symlink to the eclipse binary and placed it on my desktop. If I open a terminal, cd to ~/Desktop and run ./eclipse it starts Eclipse perfectly. However, if I click the Eclipse icon on my desktop, and choose run, nothing happens.\nAlternatively, I wouldn't mind being able to search for Eclipse on the \"Activities\" screen, but I can't find any documentation on adding or registering custom applications.\n\nA: The easiest way I have found to create launchers using a full-featured GUI is vie MenuLibre, which is in the Ubuntu repositories. It will hold your hand through the process and allow you to create a custom launcher in a fast and straightforward manner, as long as you know where your resources reside (binary location, icon location, working directories, etc). Alacarte does not work reliably for me.\n\nA: In newer Gnome versions Comment and Terminal sections become mandatory so minimal .desktop file is now:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=Sample Application Name\nComment=A sample application\nExec=application\nIcon=application.png\nTerminal=false\n\n\nA: If you want a list of custom launchers you can access from the panel you could use the MyLauncher extension. \nMyLauncher Gnome Shell Extension\n\nA: Although creating your own launcher by hand is a valid solution, my preferred one is to go through alacarte and create a new entry on the menus, then it will appear as a launcher.\n\nA: Try to create a eclipse.desktop file under /usr/share/applications (or ~/.local/share/applications or directly in ~/Desktop) with the following content:\n[Desktop Entry]\nEncoding=UTF-8\nName=Eclipse IDE\nExec=/path/to/eclipse/executable\nIcon=/path/to/eclipse/icon\nType=Application\nCategories=Development;\n\nYou can choose another category, too. For additional information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gnome's documentation about desktop files;\n\n*Categories available.\n\n\nA: If you want proper shortcut, then do following:\n\n*\n\n*go to /usr/share/applications\n\n*coppy one of the *.desktop files to this location with the name you intend to use as application name;\n\n*adjust the executable path\n\n*adjust the icon path\n5! check carefully for all the places in this file where old references are, and edit them to your needs.\n\n", "Q: Why does my PC restart when trying to use a live CD and flash drive? Recently I was recommended Ubuntu 11.10 64-Bit. I burned the .ISO to a disc and verified it and went to boot it on my PC. When I selected it to boot on the disc, it would get to the menu. As I wanted to try it first, I selected that. My PC then got to the purple screen, went black, and then my PC will restart. So i have burned another CD to the same problem. I decided to try with a USB and i get the very same problem. my PC specs are:\nWindows 7 64-Bit, 16 GB DDR3 RAM, Sapphire Radeon HD 7970 (21197-00-40G) 3072MB PCIe x16 Gen 3.0 Eyefinity 6 Edition.Is something wrong with compatibility? \n\nA: It would help knowing whether this a laptop or desktop If it's a laptop, it would be helpful to know what the laptop model is. If you've gotten to the purple screen that means you've gone past the BIOS meaning you're able to boot from CD/USB...I recommend selecting install Ubuntu instead of trying it in a live session and see what happens (selecting install Ubuntu will not format your HDD right away, you have to accept partitioning first, just wondering if it would let you install). Other work-arounds include installing to your hard drive in another computer, then putting it back into your machine.\n", "Q: Getting the \"Created\" timestamp of a PDF file in the CLI I'd like to know if there's a CLI command to get the \"Created\" timestamp from the \"Document\" tab (from file properties of a PDF) in the CLI?\nI know that I can use stat to get Access/Modified/Changed info from the filesystem, but with the meta-data in the \"Document\" tab being embedded in the file itself, I'm not sure how to go about extracting it via the CLI.\nThe reason I need to do this is to create a list of filenames along with \"Created\" timestamps for about 22,000 PDF files. Obviously, this is something far better suited to the CLI than the GUI.\n\nA: If you install the poppler-utils package, you can do this using the pdfinfo command.  For example:\n$ pdfinfo OBEX-1.3.pdf \nTitle:          Microsoft Word - OBEX13.doc\nAuthor:         Daphne\nCreator:        PScript5.dll Version 5.2\nProducer:       Acrobat Distiller 5.0.5 (Windows)\nCreationDate:   Wed Feb  5 11:12:32 2003\nModDate:        Wed Feb  5 11:12:32 2003\nTagged:         no\nPages:          95\nEncrypted:      no\nPage size:      612 x 792 pts (letter)\nFile size:      545666 bytes\nOptimized:      yes\nPDF version:    1.3\n\nYou should be able to extract the creation date from this output using standard tools like sed or awk.\nIf you want something a bit more programatic, you could use the poppler library directly.  There are bindings for many popular languages including Python (through the python-poppler package).\n", "Q: Kubuntu 12.04 Firefox and Rekong don't know how to open downloaded files I just installed Kubuntu 12.04 beta 1. \nBoth Rekong and Firefox don't know how to \"Open Containing Folder\" for downloaded items. They also don't know how open the item itself. (I'll give the specific error below.)\nFurthermore, if I manually tell Firefox (in the dialog) to remember the file associations, that creates a new problem. Every file opens in Dolphin first, then Dolphin opens the correct application. (It could almost be a feature instead of a bug, but it gets annoying at times.)\nMy installation is missing the file /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache. \nI'm also missing /usr/share/applications/defaults.list and ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list. If anyone has default copies of those files for this build, I would appreciate copies. I think they may help me resolve this. (Anyone else see those files missing?)\nDetails:\nRekong is installed by default and the problem is present in a standard configuration.\nTo reproduce, download a file with Rekong. Then go to Downloads > Open directory (of the downloaded file). The result is:\nError: rekonq does not know how to handle this protocol: \n\nThe same situation exists in Firefox. I used the included Kubuntu menu item to install Firefox. No problems with the installation, everything standard.\nBut when I download an item (e.g., a JPG image) with Firefox and then choose to either open it or open the containing folder, I get a dialog titled \"launch application\" and I have to \"choose an application\". Once I choose an application, telling Firefox to remember it leads to the problem above: Every file opens in Dolphin.\nIt seems that Firefox doesn't know the mime types. However, Dolphin does know the mime types.\nMore info:\nIn Firefox preferences > Applications, the only content types shown are irc, ircs, mailto, podcast, tar file, webca and webfeed. Normally, there would be many more. \nI tried deleting mimeTypes.rdf (as mentioned in a Mozilla Knowledge Base article) in my Firefox profile and it did not resolve the issue.\nI also tried copying a known good complete Firefox profile from my other computer (Linux Mint 12). Once I began using that profile, it also had the problem under Kubuntu 12.04. \nHere's some more info:\n$ cat ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list  \ncat: /home/user/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list: No such file or directory\n\n$ cat /usr/share/applications/defaults.list  \ncat: /usr/share/applications/defaults.list: No such file or directory\n\nUnfortunately, copying those files from a working Ubuntu installation did not resolve the issue. It had seemingly no impact.\nThe default applications for handling files in Dolphin works correctly.\nI have been continuing to research this. I was reading this knowledge base article: http://kb.mozillazine.org/File_types_and_download_actions#Resetting_download_actions\nIt says, \"All versions of Firefox and SeaMonkey will use an installed and enabled plugin to open a downloaded file by default, based on its MIME type.\"\nI checked and the only plugin installed in Firefox is Skype Buttons for Kopete. Nothing else. On my Linux Mint install, there are a number of plugins, including Gnome Shell Integration. Could missing plugins be the issue?\nThere's a similar question here with no solution.\nHere's a question where the problem sounds almost identical, but the solution is unrelated. I'm working with a new, fresh installation of Kubuntu and I don't have any other DE installed.\n\nA: Here is a workaround for the Firefox problem from Canonical support:\n1) stop firefox\n2) rm ~/.mozilla/firefox//mimeTypes.rdf\n3) start firefox\n4) download a file\n5) open it from the downloads menu and choose the application. Browse to /usr/bin  /xdg-open. then check to remember your choice\nNow both open and open containing folder should work. You can then change the preferred programs through kde's file associations settings.\nNOTE: I have confirmed that this solution works. It's a workaround, but in some ways it is an improvement over the original Firefox approach (for KDE users).\nRegarding Rekonq, I was in the kubuntu-devel IRC channel recently speaking to a developer. He said he was putting through a fix for the Rekonq issue. I believe it is in place now. I'm told that that after 'apt-get upgrade rekonq' has been run on Kubuntu 12.04 beta1 that this Rekonq bug is gone. EDIT: yes, I have confirmed this fix too.\n\nA: I may have found a solution by shadowsnipes. It is a bit old, but based on what I've seen the last couple days, it appears relevant and up to date. (The same files are still used.) I can't test it tonight, but I will test it tomorrow. In the mean time, in case anyone is interested, here is what I found:\n\nOriginally Posted by drauk\n  Hey i was trying to do this too.\n  After read the posts and check in \"about:config\", i copy /etc/mailcap from other distro and if work now i have a list of programs to open with (i tried mime.types before mailcap and didn't work to me).  \n\nAhh, thanks for the tip. I think I have found one solution for getting this all to work in Firefox in Slackware. You can copy /etc/mailcap from a distro that has this working, yes, but you can also just write the entries you need.\nInstead of modifying my /etc/mailcap I chose to modify ~/.mailcap. The default path for mailcap is (as found under the man page)\nCode:\n$HOME/.mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/usr/etc/mailcap:/usr/local/etc/mailcap\n\nHere is an example of some lines you can add for getting files to associate with ark.\nCode:\napplication/x-tar;ark %s\napplication/x-tgz;ark %s\napplication/x-bzip2;ark %s\n\nNow start up firefox and try opening a tar, tar.gz, or bz2 file. It doesn't work ...yet.\nYou have to modify mimeTypes.rdf under your firefox profile first. I found the easiest way to do this is to use the MIME Edit firefox extension. Simply add one entry for each corresponding entry of interest in the mailcap (you don't have to do them all).\nNow once this is done you should see the default option (ark in this case) come up whenever you try to download or open one of these three archive file types. In addition, if you use the MIME edit extension to specify an alternate program to use for these files, it will now be included as an option. Be sure to check the 'always ask what to do' unless you want the files to be handled automatically. The option selected by default will be the last one selected under the MIME edit extension.\nOnce you are all setup with this you can simply copy the mimeTypes.rdf file to another profile if you desire.\nBTW, an earlier post by unSpawn in the same thread is really helpful in terms of background:\n\nAbout MIME types and .desktop files\n  For any entity your browser can not render internally it will look for an accompanying MIME type. FF recognises MIME types searching through two databases\" (type \"about:config\" and search for \"mime\"). Customised handling can then be configured in ~/.mozilla/firefox/$PROFILENAME/mimeTypes.rdf. Recognising applications linked to MIME types is done by your Desktop Environment which should honour the Desktop Entry Specification. It dictates each shared MIME type (also see: XDG) is mapped to a .desktop file in the mimeinfo.cache (and defaults.list) and each relevant application has a .desktop file with a \"MimeType\" entry in it. So if for instance you're looking for \"tar\" (\"application/x-tar\") you could check if 'grep -i 'tar=' mimeinfo.cache' and 'grep -i 'tar=' defaults.list' both point to the same .desktop file and if that file exists if it emits the right MIME types 'grep -i mime'.\n  Somebody else may know of a more \"correct\", easier or even GUI way for handling this kind of thing.\n\n", "Q: Unable to connect to regular sites using IE7 in Wine I have the latest version of Ubuntu installed one week back.

Is there a way to let it recognized Prolog files as non Perl files?\n\nA: Perl highlighting can be removed in Geany by choosing Tools -> Configuration Files -> filetype_extensions.conf from the menu bar. In the file that is opened, remove *.pl; from the Perl line, then choose Tools -> Reload Configuration to apply. This will also remove Perl highlighting from actual Perl files with that extension.\nGeany doesn't have any highlighting for Prolog, though it is on the plugin wishlist.\n\nA: It is not possible to do this because file types are identified by their file extension, and .pl is the extension for Perl, so changing what they mean would mess with your system.\n", "Q: Instance resets to default after stop/start I installed nova + glance on my laptop. I ran an instance type m1.tiny with Ubuntu 10.04 image. Then I installed apache2 and run a wordpress site on this instance. Everything fine!\nBut when I reset my laptop (host machine) or stop the instance, then when I start it again, every package I installed is gone. The instance is \"blank\" like the brand new after I created by \"euca-run-instance\". \nIs it the default config of Openstack or and error on my laptop?\nWhat should I do if I want to reuse the instance?\nThank you!\n\nA: I asked this question a long time ago when I tried to run Openstack on my laptop hardware. There was many annoyances, after each time turn off and turn on my laptop to test Openstack, the instance I created last time was not run or it broke. I reinstall OP and fixed these problem. Each time run OP, I must reboot the instance and nova service... several times then it works.\n", "Q: How can I find files quicker than find or locate? I have been using find command to find files on my 1 tb hard disk. it takes very long. then I used locate which proved to be faster with regular update using updatedb. But the limitation of locate is that I cannot find files with certain size or modified/created time. can you suggest me any ideas on how to find files at more speed or in that case how to pipe output of locate command in a way that all other information like size, time, etc. can be displayed or redirected to a file.\n\nA: I haven't seen an answer that comes near the wishes of Chaitanya. If you want to search on filename, a combination of locate, find, ls and grep could be sufficient. But I think Chaitanya want to search for example for 'all files created before 2011'. This can perfectly done with find, but I can imagine it will take a long time searching through 1TB (depends more on the amount of files, not necessarily the total size). To speed this up I think indexing is inevitable. The problem of locate (indexing with updatedb) is that it doesn't index creation time. \nSo what Chaitanya need is something that indexes the needed attributes of files (file name, file size, creation date, more?). And later something that can search on these attributes.  As far as I know there is no out-of-the-box solution for this on Ubuntu.\nAn important comment of Chaitanya: \"Now the thing is that I am designing a php based web gui...\". Because your problem sounds quite specific, maybe you want to build somehting yourself. Some suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Index the files in a database (with cronjob) and use SQL to search.\n\n*Use Lucene to index and search (Zend Lucene for PHP)\n\nA: Use \"find option Parameter\". See \"man find\" more detail.\nUse locate to find a document quickly and easily, eg. \"locate *.jpg\"\n\nA: You can try Tracker. It has a daemon that waits for file changes and updates a database with all the metadata as possible, and a client that you can use to search for files. Note that it only indexes the user dir, not all the hard disk.\nThe main dawback is that it needs CPU time to index, so use it only if your computer has power to spare.\nYou will need to install both the server and client, they are named tracker and tracker-gui. If you search for tracker in the Software Center they are the two first matches. If you prefer to install them from the command line:\nsudo apt-get install tracker tracker-gui\n\n\nA: Response to comment:  \nls -la \"$(locate -d external.db \"Duel of Fates (Darth \")\"\nproduces:  \n-rw-rw-r-- 1 user group 4075134 2012-03-30 22:37 /home/user/Music/Star Wars: Episode 1 - Duel of Fates (Darth Maul's Theme).mp3\nThx @Oli in AskUbuntu chat for tipping me off to \"something\" to get around shell escapes\n\nA: The issue with locate is that it only collects file information occasionally on a regular cron schedule. You if you need mlocate to update its information, just run this\n$ sudo /etc/cron.daily/mlocate\n\nIf you need a solution that is more \"real-time\" and updates constantly, I would suggest going with something that is specifically designed to monitor your filesystem, like tracker-gui as Javier Rivera stated.\nTo redirect the output of locate to a file, just use an arrow > instead of the pipe | character. (One arrow will over write an output file if it already exists. Two arrows will append to an output file if it already exists.)\n$ locate filename > output.txt  # Overwrite\n$ locate filename >> output.txt # Append\n\n\nA: Use gnome-search-tool\nIt provides\n\n\n*\n\n*File content\n\n*Modification date\n\n*Size\n\n*File emptiness\n\n*Owner/Group\n\n*Name pattern exclusion\n\n*Name regular expression match\n\n*Hidden and backup files\n\n\nA: \nhow to pipe output of locate command in a way that all other\n  information like size, time, etc. can be displayed or redirected to a\n  file.\n\nMuch time and effort was devoted to solving this problem in this answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I count files with a particular extension, and the directories they are in?\nThis code can be scaled down to your locate needs:\n$ time locate -0 *.mp4 | xargs -0 ls -s\n\n     4 /home/rick/askubuntu/subdir-A/1.mp4\n     4 /home/rick/askubuntu/subdir-A/2.mp4\n         ( ...

Whatever is printed by locate command doesn't go to the screen but is redirected to the next command.\n\n*xargs -0 - The xargs command takes entry by entry output from previous command (locate) and passes it to the next command. -0 signifies entries are separated by null byte, rather than newline (\\n) separator.\n\n*ls -s The ls command is called by xargs and passed the file name to list. The -s flag tells ls to include the file size.\n\n\nAs you can see the process takes less than 1 second for over a million files in three Ubuntus and two Windows partitions.\n", "Q: Why is Rosetta Stone the wikipedia page on Ubuntu install?

I'm sure you can understand the significance of a monolithic kernel like Linux and why that makes it impossible to simply replace.\nThe closest you can get is a live-patching process using Ksplice. It converts Kernel updates into magical shims that can plug holes in a running Kernel, allowing you to keep the computer on indefinitely without needing a reboot. For your purposes, it also lets you roll back changes.\nIt is free for Ubuntu Desktop editions so you can play around with it but you have to pay a subscription for servers (where this sort of thing is most needed).\n\nJust seen your edit. Ksplice probably isn't going to help if you're manually hacking and building your own Kernels for debugging as \"the service\" is that they provide the special updates and they're not something you can generate on your own.\nIf you're just building things against an official kernel, it might still work.\n\nOne more idea: Virtualisation. You could build your new kernel and swap things around in your VM and reboot. It's still going to take the time it needs to reboot but you could make the VM much more light than your development machine (base it on Ubuntu Server, drop the X server if you don't need it, etc).\n\nA: As Oli mentioned, your best shot is probably virtualisation.\nThat said, if you're tinkering with hardware, virtualisation might not cut it for you, in which case, you could use kexec to swap the running kernel without a full reboot.\nTaken from the ArchWiki kexec page:\n\nkexec -l /boot/new-kernel --initrd=/boot/new-initrd --reuse-cmdline\nsystemctl kexec\n\n\nNote that the above will still restart all services, including your init system, the display server, networking, etc. However, if you use a fast enough init system, like systemd, your can boot into your new kernel in 2-3 seconds, since you're bypassing the BIOS/UEFI and the bootloader.\n\nA similar description can be found on the RapidReboot Ubuntu Wiki page.\n\nA: I think these answers need to be updated.\nThere is kpatch now, which is more native than ksplice et al.\nIt can’t change in-kernel data structures though, for obvious reasons, so it’s mostly useful for security hotpatches.\nThe general problem always is: Running processes still keep kernel data structures around, expecting kernel functions to expect them and give them back.  And without those processes being made for it, it is not really possible to know, if that is the case. So you can’t change those, until all processes that use them, are restarted. It would require live-patching all those programs too.\nAnd I didn’t even mention driver changes, when the hardware is in a special state. (Same problem as with kexec.)\n", "Q: Making ubuntu try-able by other systems on the network using Network Boot? I'm wondering if a ubuntu pc can act as a server to provide the ability to network boot ubuntu's live cd to other system(s) in the network.\nTo make my question more clear:\nFrom Wikipedia's article on Network Booting:\n\nThe initial software to be loaded is loaded from a server on the network; for TCP/IP networks this is usually done using the Trivial File Transfer Protocol. The server from which to load the initial software is usually found by broadcasting or multicasting a Bootstrap Protocol or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol request. Typically, this initial software is not a full image of the operating system to be loaded, but just part of it - enough for the operating system to start and then take control of the booting process, and continue booting over the network.\n\nI want to make one ubuntu pc as the \"server\" and enable the other pc's to be able to boot from a ubuntu image I host on the server\n\nA: PXE (Preboot Execution Environment) is what you're probably looking for. With it you can boot many computers up to either an install process (so you could install Ubuntu on a dozen machines at once) or a desktop setting. There are a billion and five separate guides rotting in the Wiki but here are two of the best I've seen:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Desktop/PXE\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DisklessUbuntuHowto\n\n*Some of the LTSP pages are handy too.\n\n\nStraight PXE booting like this creates a \"fat client\". All the computing happens on the client end and (by default). This is good if all the clients have enough computational power but less good if you'd rather have a powerful server and lots of underpowered \"thin clients\". There's also no effort (by default) to sync users or their files.\nIf you want to continue the idea to booting full desktops with sync files, you should have a look at LTSP. It supports both thin and fat clients and is good for proper deployments with multiple users.\n\nI've thought about this before but my main problem with PXE is you need to set up a separate network with its own DHCP server. It can all be done from within an Ubuntu desktop but it can get pretty complicated when it comes down to joining the two networks. If you want the Live CD clients to have an Internet gateway, for example, it gets pretty hairy. Extremely possible but it can give you a headache.\n\nA: It's documented on the ubuntu wiki here.\nMulti-boot is detailed here.  \nA combination of the two should get you exactly where you want to be...  \nThe first one gets you booting across the network and pretending there's no disk.

At anyrate, last night and again this morning I am seeing messages withing my dmesg output to the effect of:\nEXT4-fs (sda1): re-mounted.

The message \"...,commit=600\" is printed when the notebook is unplugged from a power supply. When reconnecting again, it'll print \"...,commit=0\". This is a power saving feature, to avoid wasting battery power (but at the expense of data loss on power failure), the filesystem does not immediately write away data.\nI don't know what the \"composite sync not supported\" error is referring to.\n\nA: see http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1473045.html\n", "Q: GUI app for Bandwidth Shaping (Internet Speed Limiter) This is a similar question to this one: How do I limit internet bandwidth? but in this case I am looking for a GUI app. \nThe other question was 2+ years ago so a GUI might be available that I could use to not only monitor but also change the maximum speed at which clients can download.

But, its a standalone box with 2 NIC's and it is my router. I did the Zentyal installer that just paves your machine and makes it a Zentyal box. \nI am not sure exactly what you are looking for as your above question is not completely clear, but the mention of NetLimiter leads me to believe you'd like to install this on a workstation as a service that limits traffic just on that box. If that is the case, paving isn't what you are looking for probably. \nNow, I did run Zentyal as a virtual machine in VMWare Player before implementing my production router box. I wanted to make sure I was familiar enough not to hose my internet connection for an extended period of time so I used the VM to practice. It took some finagling to push my workstation's internet connection across two virtual NIC's in a virtual machine on the same box, but once I got it working it did do what you are asking. It was fast, stable, and ran for a couple of weeks in the background and I hardly noticed it. I only gave it one processor and 1GB of ram and it was plenty fast, etc.\nAgain, probably a pretty complex and overwrought solution to what you are really looking for.\nI have seen reports of Zentyal modules getting installed piecemeal on an existing box and running in the background and doing what you need. I am not familiar with that method so you'd need to google a bit to get details.\nBut can I persuade you to upgrade your intent? Would you consider popping a couple of good gigabit nic's in an old pc laying around and firing up Zentyal, pfSense, Untangle, or any other of the many open source, free, full featured firewall's/UTM's floating around? It will give you QoS/Traffic shaping for your entire network and it's a good learning experience. Doing it this way I can watch the usage of my entire network by protocol, watch for unusual activity, drop the ping in most of my games way down, and make sure that when my wife downloads a movie on demand that my xBox doesn't lag so bad I get shot 3 times before a new frame loads.\n", "Q: How can I see my files in 2nd partition of hdd?

You say you cant see your 2nd partition but if it is mounted to /home then everything in this folder will be on your 2nd partition. \nIf you open the 'System Monitor' and click the 'File Systems' tab you will be able to see each partition and where it is mounted.\nIf you would like to alter a partition then you will have to do so from a live USB or CD as this it the only way you will be able to change the HD without mounting it first.\n\nA: Linux differs from Windows in that it incorporates the various partitions \"invisibly\" into your directory structure, whereas Windows lists them as various drives. So what this means for you, is that /home is your other partition, whereas the rest of your file system is mounted on your first partition. \nTry running \"df -h\" , it will give the output to you in a form that will be easier to read.\n", "Q: disk check error at boot and then GNU GRUB. How do I fix it? When I have booted my machine and choose Ubuntu.  It did a hard drive check and got an error.

If not sure, do an fdisk -l, see what partition is your ubuntu and do a fsck /dev/partition\n", "Q: How do I disable the \"Nouveau Kernel Driver\"? I'm trying to install proprietary nvidia graphics driver I downloaded from nvidia website. It will not install because it says that the \"Nouveau kernel driver\" needs to be disabled first.\nI opened synaptic and uninstalled everything that had nvidia, nouveau, or jockey in its name. It still won't work.\nWhat exactly do I need to do to disable the \"Nouveau kernel driver\"?\n\nA: I was stuck with this issue for a long time. After installing a fresh copy of Ubuntu 16.04, I installed cuda 8.0 using the deb(local):\nsudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1604-8-0-local-ga2_8.0.61-1_amd64.deb\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install cuda\n\nNvidia driver is working well on my computer now. Prior to that, I was trying to install Nvidia driver using the *.run file without any luck. Give it a shot it will save your valuable time.\n\nA: I am just a little penguin and have found disabling/blacklisting nouveau breaks many features within ubuntu especially window management items(i.e. missing menus etc which is fine if you know keyboard shortcuts for navigation/operation.)  NVidia themselves in the readme highlight the possible need to create another file if modeprobe.d/blacklist allready contains anythingelse.  It is possible to change from mesa to vesa drivers by disabling nouveau in ubuntu. Using mesa or vesa will give different listings in jockey(additional drivers) as will using jockey-common(handy for adding older drivers to jockey list)\nThere has been much hard work going on in this department by many and have found personally that the recommended driver has been hugely improved in recent months as well as the NVidia 310 driver being available either in ubuntu software centre or additional drivers after activating proposed updates in Software Sources (and then updating).\nWhat i have found after installation is that there is never a proprietary driver installed which means little things like launcher icon size can not be adjusted (system settings>appearance) which is indicative of a 2d session and not 3d session (newer flavours). So bearing in mind the ubuntu philosophy and the fact different people use their machines for different things; it might be worth asking,\"Is it a bug?  and/or What happens when nouveau is disabled?  \n\nA: Put the file nvidia-graphics-drivers.conf under the /etc/modprobe.d/ directory and then reboot the system.\nGet into console and execute NVIDIA-Linux-x86-319.32.run again, thus it won't get the incompatibility error.\n\nA: All links above are correct, however you must run sudo update-initramfs -u so the initramfs can be purged of nouveau\n\nA: Just a quick question: Why are you downloading the drivers from Nvidia directly? The packages available through jockey (the Additional Drivers application) should be fine for most people and if you don't fit into \"most people\", using the X-SWAT PPA should give you the latest version of the nvidia driver.\nAnyway, what you want is simple. Firstly you have to get out of X before you can install. You can do that by switching to a virtual terminal (tty) by pressing ctrl+alt+ F1 logging on and then running sudo stop lightdm. Now run the installer. If it's still moaning about nouveau continue:\nRun sudoedit /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-graphics-drivers.conf and fill it with this:\n# This file was installed by nvidia-current-updates\n# Do not edit this file manually\n\nblacklist nouveau\nblacklist lbm-nouveau\nblacklist nvidia-173\nblacklist nvidia-96\nblacklist nvidia-current\nblacklist nvidia-173-updates\nblacklist nvidia-96-updates\nalias nvidia nvidia_current_updates\nalias nouveau off\nalias lbm-nouveau off\n\nThe driver will create that file when it's installed, but you just want to speed things along. You'll need to reboot and kill X again now.\nThen run the installer and all should be fine.\n\nA: Can you add your graphics card model and Ubuntu version to the question?\nEven though you can download 96 series drivers from nVidia's website, it will be incompatible with the latest version of Xorg and will not install.You can make an attempt to downgrade your X server, but you may find that other features of Ubuntu will be broken and you may even be unable to get to any sort of graphical desktop. I would provide instructions on how to do this, but I don't know which version of Ubuntu you're using. Maybe you can find out with a Google search. See post #7, here, or this launchpad project, which may be, well, fun to try ;)\n\nA: Add string nomodeset to your /etc/default/grub file at line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=line, or your nvidia driver won't work.\nAfter the modifications, run:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nA: Pass a kernel argument (nouveau.blacklist=1) at boot to blacklist the driver by editing your /etc/default/grub file:\nsudo sed -i 's/GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"/GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"nouveau.blacklist=1 /g' /etc/default/grub\nsudo update-grub\n\nreboot    \n\nA: Gentoo Users (others, ymmv): After configuring nouveau as a [M]odule in your kernel (genkernel gets this for free), and installing the nvidia kernel module (emerge nvidia-drivers), I'm running a fully interchangeable nouveau/nvidia build with only the following:\n\n/etc/default/grub\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"nouveau.modeset=0\"\n\n\nI find the elegance of the solution charming, myself.\n", "Q: New Sound Devices Show up in Hardware But not Input or Output If I insert a new audio device it shows up under the Hardware Tab of Sound Settings:\n\nHowever, I don't see it as an option in Input or Output Tab:\n\n\nA: Discovered a workaround.

If it is a hybrid card you may have some success using Bumblebee. Installation instructions here.\n\nA: No.  You use the 32 bit binary driver for the best performance.  Generally, jockey-gtk in the terminal is the way to install binary drivers on ubuntu.  You could install x64 and the 64-bit driver...but you don't get 64 bit driver on 32 bit machines.\n\nA: Nope.

Right now, there is a single WD20EARS 2 TB hard drive formatted as NTFS that's about to run out of space.\nI'd like to purchase a few extra drives (the case can hold an additional two). I have a few questions before I actually purchase anything though:\n\n\n*\n\n*The original reason I was running Windows Server was because of the way 4k sector drives are handled on Linux.

Is there any way that I can do this without needing an external to back up the data? It's my understanding that RAID 5 requires three disks, so it seems that if I wanted to purchase two extra drives, I'd need to back up the data on the existing NTFS drive before building the RAID.\n\n*Am I going about this the wrong way?

I have the set the memory usage to 1.5 GB for this instance. My Mac has total memory of 4GB.\nI would like to know, what is the recommended memory for Ubuntu 11.10 running on Virtual Box.\n\nA: Answer from Apple forum\nYes. In other words not more than, say, 1 GB to Ubuntu and 1 GB to Windows if you have both running at the same time. If you only run one at a time then a maximum of 2 GBs can be allocated to each. Hope that's a bit clearer.\nIn reality you may need to cut back the allocation just a tad to account for the total amount of RAM the running VM uses because it will include overhead for the emulator itself.

This can increase performance if bandwidth is scarce.\nfor example something like this\nssh -CX -c blowfish yourname@yourhost\n\n\nA: You may want to check the amount of data transmitted through the network and the  bitrate.

Pair base_color and text_color are used for the document or text entry portions of windows where bg_color and fg_color are are used for the windows area where icons and labels are displayed. Selected pair is for selected text and the tooltip pair is used for the tips that pop up when you hover over a button or link. These colors may be applied by applications with varying opacity or shadings. The color of text in buttons comes from the fg_color. These sets of labels appear in all three files so I've been changing all three to be the same for any label I change. Here's an example of what I changed in the gtk.css file in the Ambiance theme.\n/* default color scheme */\n@define-color bg_color #cdc3b8;\n@define-color fg_color #262626;\n@define-color base_color #accdff;\n@define-color text_color #262626;\n@define-color selected_bg_color #01b9fc;\n@define-color selected_fg_color #ffffff;\n@define-color tooltip_bg_color #A3D0FF;\n@define-color tooltip_fg_color #023C79;\n\n\nA: You can find a lot of themes like that in gnome-look.org, and the theme you're looking is here i believe: http://abhizweblog.blogspot.com/2011/05/gnome-3-themes-how-to-install-gnome-3.html\n\nA: The above screen-shot is the default theme of  gnome 3.4 \n\nThe current version of GNOME shipping in Ubuntu 11.10 is 3.2 (except\n  Movie Player, which is currently running at version 3.0).

For things like dealing with skype and pulseaudio problems, I'm routinely advised by various internet sources to delete my foldername folders in my user's home directory (such as .pulse .skype).  It does generally seem to work.  What is this actually doing, and why am I advised to do it?  \nAlso, if this does fix programs, why aren't they set to delete their own folders there?  What are these for when they work?\n\nA: Well, typically, those folders contain program's user-specific settings. I.e. those settings that are set on a user-by-user basis. For example, in Skype that would be your personal account, notification, audio/video settings etc. Unfortunately, this is often the case that some of the settings get messed up and it is quite hard to figure out what exactly is wrong. In that case it may be advised to just delete the whole folder to bring it back to the initial state.\nThere are also other typical folders containing you program P settings, such as ~/.P, ~/.config/P, ~/.gnome2/P, ~/.gconf/apps/P etc. It all depends on where a particular program stores its settings. When you remove a corresponding folder all the settings for the program are gone.\nNow, I believe, this also answers the question why the programs do not do that by themselves.\n\nA: There directories contain any personal configurations that you have done to these applications.\nDeleting them also deletes any miss-configurations. When an application finds its configuration folder missing, it will typically regenerate a standard configuration that works.\nDeleting these configurations every time is not desirable, because they you will always loose any custom configurations that you may have done.\n", "Q: How to effectively move Ubuntu server from a VirtualBox to a dedicated server?

You can try unplugging it from the network and booting to ensure things are working.\n\n*Once you know it's booting, boot the new server with the LiveCD again, and mount partitions to temporary location again.\n\n*DOWNTIME HERE. Stop the services in your virtualbox (sorry, can't get around this, but I'll keep it as brief as possible).

I'd like to be able to run PHP scripts without needing to use sudo in every command.  My user is not root obviously.  How can I accomplish this feat?  I'm new to Linux, and I have a little knowledge of permissions, but assume I don't.\nI thought PHP scripts would be sent to the background and run under a different user that does have root permissions, and the user kicking those scripts off wouldn't need to have the same access.  In any case, the PHP scripts will need database read/write access, will need to be able to read/write files, will need access to start/stop the apache web server, and any other task that a typical PHP script does.\nIf I'm scheduling these scripts with anacron, do I need to do anything differently?\n\nA: Your script, php, python, bash, perl, or otherwise has to run as a user with privileges to access the files and services you are managing.\nSince some of the tasks you mention require root access (start/stop apache), you will have to run it as root (with sudo). Schedule your scripts to be run as root (from root's anacron)\nA more common user case is to run php in a web server (LAMP). In that event, normally one would have /var/www owned by the apache user (www-data), or at least any files php needs to modify. php scripts are then called by apache, and run as www-data and have access to files in /var/www.

A friend was complaining that her 3 year old Windows Vista install was taking \"up to an hour\" to become usable after booting, so I offered to take a look at it.  There was a whole mess of stuff starting up on boot, but I broke the Windows habit before Vista was invented so don't know what's essential and what isn't.  I ended up installing Ubuntu 11.10 on her empty D: drive and leaving her with a dual boot.\nI installed the \"xfce4\" package because it was defaulting to a weird looking desktop with square icons down the left hand edge.  Now it looks more like the Windows interface she's used to.\nAll seemed well until the next day when I received this from her:\nHi, Chris!  Everything is really working well so far, thank you so much again!!!!\n\nThe only thing that is happening today is that the laptop is randomly shutting itself\noff while I'm typing.  I haven't hit the button, the battery is fully charged, etc.\nI'm just going along, typing away, and all of a sudden it turns itself off.  Any\nideas why that would be happening?\n\nOther than that, I'm really happy with the changes.  :-D\n\nAny idea what the problem might be?  Windows on the same computer never just powers off.  It's a 2 GHz Celeron machine from 2008 or so, and she's doing nothing very intensive on it.  Email in Google Chrome and documents in Libre Office is the extent of it.\nI set up a 3GB swap partition, so I doubt it's running out of swap, and am stuck for ideas.  It's an Acer Aspire 5315 ICL50.\n\nA: I answered a similar question to this some time ago as follows:\n\"I had the same problem with an Acer Aspire 5315 which was given to me to mend. The answer is to download the latest BIOS from Acer and flash it. The issue arises as several (maybe all) Acer models use the Acer installed software to manage the fan. If that software is removed either because the user doesn't want it, to update Windows, or as I did, to install Ubuntu, then the fan will not work correctly. It may start when the laptop is booted up but if the machine hibernates, sleeps etc then the fan will not restart causing overheating and cut-off. It seems that Acer acknowledged this some time ago and used a BIOS upgrade to correct the problem. I did this with my machine and now have had no problem for 3 weeks (as opposed to cutting-out every few minutes before).\"\nMonths down the line the laptop is working fine so the upgraded BIOS did the trick.\n\nA: In my experience, when a computer shut down like that, it is hardware related. I would double check to make sure that there is no loose hard drive connection or memory stick not fully inserted. I would also run http://www.memtest86.com/ to make sure that the memory is not failing. Just realized the link I gave you requires you to pay for a boot cd with memtest86. There are several free boot CDs which include memtest. A quick search turned up http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/. This is what happened to me in the past when I had a computer rebooting randomly - bad memory.\nSince the computer never restarted under windows, it probably means that the hardware is alright. Thus I would look into drivers problems. Maybe there is one specific driver that is giving problem? Maybe remove any external connection (printer, usb thumb drives, scanner, other), and see if it stills does the same thing?\n\nA: Some Acer Notebooks/Laptops are known for problems with HD-Controller and some other are known for CPU high temperature. For a Laptop or whatever PC, the switch off like that mainly the problem is CPU over temperature. Ram and HDD gives some signs if they're about to fail.\nIn Cases of DUAL BOOT OS with an HDD split in two partitions of equal size, this doesn't mean that even Data Processed on each OS should be equal. So, when using Low performance need OS (like XP) you may not encounter CPU Over Temperature, but when using Linux you try to charge a little more so CPU is going more hotter because as we know, CPU Temperature is in relationship with data processed and especially in cases of over-clock CPU.\nAnyway, I guess your Laptop doesn't submitted any Hardware problem, and doesn't necessary need BIOS flash but:\n\n\n*\n\n*Carefully BIOS Configuration\n\n*CPU Thermal Grace replacement\n\n*HDD total checkup and repair (in cases that OS Freezes or slow down).\n\n\nTo be sure First Step is to bakcup your data and reinstall Windows OS and Linux OS From the beginning because some errors show up during an installation and this way may identify if all its OK or not. In case of failures you'll need Professional Utilities for a total check up of your Hardware \n", "Q: Network GUI Tools in 11.10+ (Whois, DNS Checker, Trace Route, etc...)

Is there a way to disable a telnet session from my desktop to a server from timing out, ever. This should be done from the client if at all possible.\n\nA: Does it have to be telnet? Using plain telnet is highly discouraged due to it not being very secure.\nIf you can use SSH, it has two features that will help you: TCPKeepAlive (which is enabled by default, so no need to use it) and ServerAliveInterval (which is disabled by default, so enabling this may help you).\nFrom the man page (man ssh_config):\n ServerAliveInterval\n         Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has\n         been received from the server, ssh(1) will send a message through\n         the encrypted channel to request a response from the server.

I have read both Lubuntu and Xubuntu (The homepages, wikipedia, phoronix and other sites comparing both). But from experience, which one uses less memory and is less CPU intensive. I need to install them in very old hardware and want to persuade the owner of the hardware of the benefits of Ubuntu.\nin this case I want to install 11.10 or 12.04 when it comes out. How are each behaving in those versions?\nThe 2 PCs I will be installing either Xubuntu or Lubuntu are:\nGranpa PC:\nCPU - Pentium 2 450Mhz\nRAM - 64MB DIMM\nVideo - 16MB\nUsed for - Documents and Internet. No listening to music, no looking at videos. Just using it for document writing.\nThe other old meat:\nCPU - Pentium 3 550Mhz\nRAM - 128MB DIMM\nVideo - 16MB\nUsed for - Documents and Internet also but they want.. or maybe they are wishing for it to use it to see movies and listen to music. This one has internet. The other one does not.\nUPDATE\nWanted to update this question with the test results for over 8 months worth of using Lubuntu and Xubuntu. When it comes to very old hardware, am talking about 64 MB, 128 MB or even 256 MB of RAM computers, Lubuntu is better than Xubuntu when comparing Memory usage. When it comes to CPU usage, both are the same.\nThis will not improve I/O Disk performance which will be the bottleneck for old computers. Also the difference in performance between Xubuntu and Lubuntu is about 10% to 20% percent in memory usage. Again, CPU usage is the same.\nNow, when it comes to how responsive the Desktop is, LXDE (Lubuntu) has a much better response time than XFCE (Xubuntu). I would say about 50% or just simply noticeable to the eye. Lubuntu is similar to how Windows XP looks while Xubuntu is more like how Gnome 2 looked.\nThe computers (The old ones mentioned here) and 2 more are still working in excellent conditions thanks to the Ubuntu family. I also want to add I am using 13.10 for both distros.\n\nA: In my experience there are a few things to consider.\nFirst, and most important, do you (or your users) like the interface ? It makes no sense to \"force\" xfce or lxde on them. So, ask for their input on this.\nSecond, for the most part, the window managers all use about the same in terms for RAM and CPU. The caveat here is you need to compare apples to apples, if you enable 3d / special effects you will take a performance hit.\nMost of your resources are taken by services or applications running in the background. To save on resources, disable as many as possible (do you use Seahore, VNC, etc). run gnome-session-properties and disable as much as possible.\nData: On my netbook ...\nGentoo + Openbox - When I first log into openbox (not LXDE), it uses 70 Mb RAM.\nUbuntu 12.04 - Unity 2d - Uses 300 mb RAM\nWith that said, firefox runs at about the same speed on both window managers.\nSo are all the bells and whistles of Ubuntu Desktop worth 200 Mb ram ? \nAnswer to that = personal choice.\nTest it for yourself in Virtualbox or KVM, give your guest 512 Mb RAM, boot the live CD.\n\nA: I would install bare console Debian, then with apt-get will install incrementally some window manager like OpenBox (it will install X as dependency)\nThen will check how it is, if i need taskbar icons etc...\n\nA: Upon the comparison made on vs. wiki Lubuntu is lighter and more efficient on old and low hardware systems. So on a Lubuntu vs. Xubuntu struggle, apparently Lubuntu is the winner.\n\nA: Your case studies are indeed challenging.\n\nTake your Grandpa PC\nPentium 2 and 64Mb RAM.\nLubuntu minimum requirements are 128Mb if using the alternate installer - 256Mb for the Graphical installer.\nThe recommended RAM is 384Mb just to run the LiveCD.\nTherefore - I'm afraid, you will not be able to install a graphical environment on Grandpa PC.  At best you might get a text only \"server\" type install via a minimal ISO - i.e. you need a minimum of 64Mb to run the minimal CD.\n\nThe \"old meat\":\nThat is more promising:\nPentium 3 with 128Mb RAM - you should be able to squeeze on Lubuntu via its alternate CD.\nHowever the minimum requirement for Xubuntu is 256Mb with 512Mb as a recommended RAM size.\nI've experimented with various \"low\" RAM installs.  I've never tried 128Mb - but in general, I install from a minimal ISO CD and install various components manually - for example, SLIM, LXDE with apt-get install --no-install-recommends to ensure no excess packages are installed.\nTypical packages you should look out for if you go this route are described in the linked question below.\nStick with a lightweight browser such as midori - abiword should be ok for wordprocessing.\nFlash and general movies will struggle with your video card.  However playing music should be fine (see below)\n\nLinks:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD\n\n*How do I install LXDE / Lubuntu?\n\n*Lightweight music player\n\nA: For the 64MB machine, I suspect that only Puppy Linux would be usable, not any of the *buntus.  Puppy Linux worked well for me on a thirteen year old Toshiba laptop.\n\nA: Luis - you mentioned the first machine would be used for document editing. How will they save their files? To USB? This is something to consider because such an old machine could die at any moment. Would it be better to let them edit documents online somewhere like Google Docs or Microsft Skydrive? In both of those cases, a \"modern\" browser is necessary. \n\nA: Lubntu is better and faster. If your PC is too old, you will still have problems, Lubuntu is twice as fast and good as Xubuntu by my testing.\n", "Q: How can I change the Kubuntu 12.04 default arguments for package unclutter?

However, I am not sure how that document is delivered to Canonical.\nI added this information to Oli's answer as this really just expands his answer.\n\nA: this answer has now been merged into the community accepted answer\nNone of the wider community stuff requires you to use your real name. Launchpad and Membership both allow aliases and handles (for example, I'm Oli here, Oli on IRC, Oli on Launchpad and Oli as an Ubuntu member).\nThe only instance where I've seen a real name policy is a reference to the Launchpad Beta Testers team requiring real names, in a discussion on the Ubuntu Women mailing list in 2007.\nIn reality though, this policy seems to have changed because the current members list shows plenty of people who are either using contracted forms of their names or handles. Edit: I've found that they officially retracted this policy in 2008:\n\nFor a while now, we've required that Launchpad beta team members use\n  their real names. As of today, you can join the beta team whether or\n  not you use your real name as your Launchpad display name.\nInstead, we'd like to encourage you to use your real name but it's up to you.\nAlthough most people joining the beta team have been happy to use\n  their real name, you'll probably have seen discussions on this list\n  where people have given good reasons for not wanting to use their real\n  names. The last thing we want to do is discourage you from helping us\n  beta test new features!\nI'd like to explain, though, why we prefer people to use real names.\n  We really value the feedback you give us when you beta test a new\n  feature. One reason for preferring real names is that we feel a real\n  name shows a greater readiness to take the beta team seriously.\n  However, we know that this doesn't hold for everyone: for example,\n  many people have a strong reputation built around a pseudonym.\nSo, if you've held off joining the beta team because you didn't want\n  to use your real name, please go ahead and join!\n\nHowever for legal documents (like the Canonical Contributor License Agreement) a real name is probably demanded. Contracts are usually still binding regardless of the given name (if you can link it to a person with enough proof) but it makes the whole thing a lot more floppy for both sides.\nBut if you're just talking about the CCLA and you're afraid that giving your real name is an issue, talk to Canonical and they'll let you know what they require and what they do with that information. As far as I know there is no public list of people who have agreed to the CCLA (and there's no clause for this in Canonical's privacy policy) so if your name is leaked online from signing the document, Canonical have done something bad.\nBut I'm not a lawyer so if this really matters talk to Canonical and if that doesn't help, talk to a lawyer.\n--- information about GPG ---\n\n\n*\n\n*Adding an OpenPGP key to Launchpad.\n\n*Signing the Ubuntu Code of Conduct.\n\n*Becoming an Ubuntu member.\n\n\nThe above items require the use of a GPG Key currently, but there is no requirement that your GPG Key be signed.

I really like Ubuntu and I think it is the best system for this older model computer. It just has some bugs with it that I think are caused because I need new drivers.\nThank you for any help.\n\nA: In general there are no \"drivers\" for Ubuntu in the same sense as for Windows. So going to SONY's web site would not help.\nIn Ubuntu most of the \"drivers\" are embedded in the Linux kernel itself. The rest are either left out as optional loadable \"modules\" or are proprietary drivers that cannot be embedded into the Linux kernel. One such example is the NVIDIA graphics driver. It is provided by NVIDIA in binary form only and therefore it cannot be embedded in the Linux kernel.\nThat said most of these proprietary drivers can be installed using the \"Additional Drivers\" a.k.a. \"jockey\" utility found in your default installation. It will scan your system for potential candidate devices for which there is a proprietary driver available and offer you to activate them.\nTo use the utility:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the dash by hitting the Super key or clicking on the \"Ubuntu\" button usually located in the top slot of the launcher.\n\n*Search for \"Additional\".\n\n*Launch the \"Additional Drivers\" application.\n\n\nOnce in the utility, wait for it to scan your system and install any drivers that you like if it found any.\nIf the utility does not find anything and/or installing any proprietary driver does not help your issues, you will have to ask for a solution of a specific issue you are having with Ubuntu on your laptop in a separate question.\n", "Q: How do I open more than one Nautilus explorer when there is one already opened?

For the past 2 days I have researched issues online and found a ton of workarounds for Twinview to work display properly(assuming this is causing the flash video issues.)

Thanks!\n\nA: For the record, and since I just found this out: on Ubuntu 14.04 with a recent kernel (3.13), you can also add the following line to a file /etc/modprobe.d/magicmouse.conf:\noptions hid-magicmouse emulate_3button=0 \n\n\nA: This mouse has the following buttons in this order: Button Left, Button Middle, Button Right, Button Wheel Up, Button Wheel Down, Button Horiz Wheel Left, Button Horiz Wheel Right. They can be manipulated with xmodmap. See \"man xmodmap\" for details.\nTo disable the middle click, create a ~/.Xmodmap file with this line:\npointer = 1 0 3 4 5 6 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nlog out / log in to enable it.\nIf you want to reverse the scrolling direction (up with down and left with right), then change it to:\npointer = 1 0 3 5 4 7 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nA: rmmod hid_magicmouse\nmodprobe hid_magicmouse emulate_3button=0\n\n\nA: To disable the middle button you need to map button 2 (the middle button) to something like 1 (the left button) using xinput.\nFirst get the ID of the magic mouse using xinput list.\nThen run this in the terminal (at the command prompt) to reverse the scrolling (set natural scrolling without affecting the scrolling on your tracpad) as well as map the middle button to the left button (disable the middle button): xinput set-button-map ID 1 1 3 5 4 (replace ID with your magic mouses' ID - from the first step).\nxinput set-button-map 10 1 1 3 5 4 7 6 will also allow you to scroll naturally from side to side (horizontally). Note ID=10 in this example.\nSee this page for details.\nThis works for me on Ubuntu 14.04 running on a Sony Vaio with a Magic Mouse (Mac mouse).\n\nA: The above answers, like most of StackExchange, have not aged well, particularly since Ubuntu has made major changes.\nThe recommended process is now to use the Gnome Tweaks applet, Keyboard & Mouse, disable Middle Click paste.\nhttps://linuxconfig.org/how-to-disable-middle-mouse-button-click-paste-on-ubuntu-20-04-focal-fossa-linux\n", "Q: Megaraid SAS Raid Controller I have about half a dozen servers all running the Intel RS2BL080 raid controller on Oneiric server AMD64.

This can be done by holding down Cmd-Option-O-F as you power on.  Once OpenFirmware has started (a white screen with a short message and a simpole prompt) enter the command: boot cd\nI hope this helps.  I'm going from memory.\nEdit for Addition: \nAlso, just a warning: Years ago when I used Linux on a MacBook there was no Linux driver available for the Broadcom wifi chipset that Apple used in their laptops. At the time, the only option was to use a usb attached wifi device.

Free Ubuntu-ers.  I have a strange problem which I've spent a while trying to debug, and later I searched fairly thoroughly for data on it, without any luck.\nI have a fairly new server running Lucid Lynx and I'm attempting to switch the default Python version to 2.7.  I've tested all the apps that I'm running and they seem to run well on 2.7 - and it's not a mission-critical server, so I can fail and back out if I like.\nI did my homework, installed 2.7, changed the soft links in /usr/bin, and edited my /usr/share/python/debian_defaults to make the default-version python2.7.  Then I tried \"python\" from the command line for \"root\" and for \"some random user account\" and got python 2.7 and dusted my hands off.\nThis was a couple of months ago, and all has worked fine until today...\nI tried to run a Python daemon - but it kept failing mysteriously.  I tracked it down to a package that wasn't installed - but it was... \nAfter some debugging, I discovered that in fact when I run a Python script as a daemon, it's running Python 2.6.5 - but if I run the same script from the command line, it's running Python 2.7.2 - and I of course haven't installed the new library for Python 2.6.  (I'm using the Python daemon library to launch the script as a daemon...)\nBut my scripts all start with #!/usr/local/bin/python, the version I recently installed, and /usr/local/bin/python --version returns 2.7.2.  In fact, I changed the #! line to explicitly point to python 2.7 and it still fails in exactly the same way.\nLater, I discovered if I ran the program in pdb, the python debugger, I also get 2.6 as the version.\nI think the key is that neither pdb nor the daemon runner pay any attention to the #! line - but I can't get any further than that.\nYour kind help is gratefully solicited.\nEDIT:  Some good suggestions below - if my Stackoverflow karma reached here, I'd upvote them - but no good results (see comments below).  Resolution: dump Python 2.6.\n\nA: Try sudo update-alternatives --config python\nUbuntu/Debian has an alternatives system that it uses in the case that there are multiple programs that do the same thing. See man 8 update-alternatives for more information.\n\nA: I don't have a silver bullet, but I do have a couple suggestions. When I run the following command:\n$ ls -al /usr/bin/pdb*\n\nI get this (I'm on Ubuntu 11.10):\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  6 2012-02-16 20:53 /usr/bin/pdb -> pdb2.7\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 23 2012-02-01 09:17 /usr/bin/pdb2.5 -> ../lib/python2.5/pdb.py\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 23 2011-08-11 06:04 /usr/bin/pdb2.6 -> ../lib/python2.6/pdb.py\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 23 2012-02-16 20:53 /usr/bin/pdb2.7 -> ../lib/python2.7/pdb.py\n\nSo for pdb, you may need to change the symlink.\nYou might also try this command (update-alternatives is in the repository if not already installed on your machine):\nsudo update-alternatives --config python\n\nThis should clarify what your default version of python is and allow you to reset it.\nFinally there are virtualenv and python-brew for explicitly controlling the python version you run on a system with multiple versions. I don't have any experience with python-brew, but I do like the way virtualenv packages neatly packages up python environments. If you're not familiar with it, this article may be of interest:\nhttp://mirnazim.org/writings/python-ecosystem-introduction/\n\nA: I'm assuming you're trying to get upstart to play nicely with your python upgrade.  Have you tried /usr/bin/python /opt/myservice.py?  As others already mentioned update-alternatives is the way you're supposed to do it.  They might not have applied it to upstart though.\n\nA: Eep. You are going well out of world of things you can change without serious breakage :)\nYes, you can compile and install any pythons you want in /usr/local, without any trouble. If you want one of them to be the python command, you can do that too, by putting such a symlink in /usr/local/bin/.\nYou really don't want to be touching /usr/share/python/debian_defaults, or messing with any of the symlinks in /usr/bin.\nAre you running the daemon from upstart? Is /usr/local/bin maybe not in your PATH there?\n", "Q: Random freezes in Ubuntu 11.10 I have read every single post about system freezes, but cannot find my exact problem. \nBasically, Ubuntu 11.10 is randomly freezing. When it happens, I cannot do anything, not even move the mouse. Everything is locked up, even the keyboard is not responding (num lock does nothing). I noticed that the CPU fan starts to spin faster when the system freezes, but I verified that the CPU temp is OK just a moment before the freeze, so it's not that. \nMy system was working OK one week ago, after using it for more than two months.

Seems to me that it was just after installing some ubuntu updates, that included the 3.0.0-16-generic-pae kernel, flash plugin, and some other packages. \nWhat I did to try to troubleshoot: \n\n\n*\n\n*Looked in the different logs, none reflect anything at the time of the freeze. \n\n*Used the previous kernel version selecting it from Grub; the freezes still happen. \n\n*Uninstalled firefox as I initially thought it was related (it was acting weird). Still happening. \n\n*I ran the memTest86, it passes (executed only one pass). \n\n*Used Windows 7 for several hours just to see if there's any problem there. No freezes or crashes at all.  \n\n*I tested during one entire session without opening any web browser, just to not use Flash or anything. Still freezing. \n\n\nI say it's random because I don't seem to find any sequence of steps that lead to a freeze. It can be on battery or plugged, while doing something or while doing nothing. Got the freeze while watching a flash video. Got the freeze while using Eclipse or while using gedit (to look at the logs!). Anything basically, does not seem to matter. \nHow can I further troubleshoot? The logs don't seem to help, I guess nothing is getting logged. \nThis problem is really frustrating. While everything else (including drivers, programs, Unity) works flawlessly, this is making the system almost unusable, I know I can lose my work at any point. \nThanks for any help! \n\nA: It sounds like you might be experiencing an X freeze.

A bug maybe?\nWhile, before upgrading to 12.04, under 11.10 the same command did output GT525m.\n\nA: lspci is using a table of pci codes coming from http://pciids.sourceforge.net/v2.2/pci.ids\nAccording to that list the device 10de:0df5 is NVIDIA Corporation GF108 [GeForce GT 540M]\nMaybe this is wrong and should be reported there, that eventually the next release of pciutils includes the corrected information? http://pci-ids.ucw.cz/read/PC/10de/0df5\n(I do not have such device myself, so I cannot confirm)\n", "Q: Back up virtualbox for a fresh install - while migrating to 64 bit I usually take the upgrade path in ubuntu, rather than fresh install, but I'd like to try the latter route for 12.04.\nHowever, one of the most thoroughly configured and critical tools on my system is the virtualbox windows virtual machine that I run for some key tasks I have not yet been able to move entirely to Linux.\nHow can I ensure that I completely back this up when I wipe and install for 12.04?  Will it be in exactly the current state?  Which files will I need to back up to guarantee all settings and content transfer correctly?\nAlso, a major part of my motivation in doing a fresh install is that I intend to go from a 32-bit 11.10 to a 64-bit 12.04 setup.  Will this affect/break my virtual machine?\n\nA: You can use the \"Appliance Export Wizard\" in VirtualBox to export your VM and then import it again on your reinstalled system. I'm using VirtualBox 4.1.8, but this feature has been around for at least a couple of versions.\nExporting a VM\n\n\n*\n\n*Open VirtualBox\n\n*Go to the File menu and select Export Appliance\n\n*Select the virtual machine (VM) you want to export and click Next\n\n*Choose where you will save the exported VM and click Next\n\n*Review settings and click Export\nCopy the exported VM to an external hardrive (or put it on a partition that will survive the reinstall). Once you've reinstalled, you can import the VM.\nImporting a VM\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Virtualbox\n\n*Go to the File menu and select Import Appliance\n\n*Choose the file to import and follow the rest of the prompts.\n\nA: Before wiping your drive it is always a good idea to backup your personal data in your home directory. \nTherefore I am sure you already have plans to do so. In case your virtual disk images are stored there (usually in the hidden ~/.VirtualBox directory) your virtual disks will also be included in your backup of your HOME directory and they will be restored fully functional and untouched with your backup later.\nHowever performing an upgrade from 32-bit Ubuntu to 64-bit Ubuntu can be done without deleting your data in your HOME. In case you keep your HOME you will just reinstall the virtual box application in your fresh Ubuntu installation to keep all your virtual machines (including snapshots) untouched.\nHaving said so, there may of course be cases where a backup of a virtual machine may be necessary (e.g. in case you want to build up a new home directory, you need to change your user name, or the virtual machines are not stored in HOME).\nYou then have the choice to export and import your machines in the Open Virtualization Format (OVF) either from the virtual box manager GUI or from the command line\nVBoxManage export <nameofvm> -o <nameofmachine>.ovf\nVBoxManage import <nameofvm>.ovf  # use --dry-run first to check configurations\n\nDue to limitations from the OVF format this will not save the current state or snapshots of a given machine. You may clone a virtual machine and register it in a new installation but this may be more work than performing a conventional backup of ~/.Virtualbox and possible other locations you may have defined for storing the virtual hard disks.\nI recommend reading the Virtual Box online manual to get an idea on options, procedures and limitations.\n", "Q: Hard-Drives are not detected by Ubuntu LiveCd or Installation I'm reposting my question 'cause it seems the previous is alreadt forgotten.\nI can boot to windows 7 normally.\nHowever in Ubuntu - I cannot boot. When using a Ubuntu Live CD, I cannot see my drives in gparted or disk utility.\nLaunching Nautilus - no drives are seen\nAny ideas?\n\nA: This could be a problem with your fstab, or your partition table. You said you can boot into windows, can Ubuntu not see Windows? If so that is most likely a problem with your fstab file.\nIf gparted can't see any partitions that is most likely a problem with your partition table as I think gparted bypasses fstab and all that.\nTry downloading testdisk from the repos in your live CD and do a scan and see if that is able to see your partitions.\n", "Q: Compiz not drawing window controls I have recently installed driver for my ATI graphic card in my Dell Studio laptop. I have also read this somewhere on the web that Ubuntu enables compiz window manager by default if your hardware can run it. Is it true ?\nIn my case before Installing graphic card driver the window manager was Metacity, but now I have compiz as my Window manager. I found this out uisng Displex Indicator applet also confirmed by wmctrl -m.\nFrom the time I have installed graphic card drivers, the window manager(Compiz) is not drawing window control buttons for some of the windows. For example if I open a terminal I have to close it using key board shortcuts or use the File -> Quit option in app-menu. Also I am not able to move the window because of this. From then when-ever I find a window without window control buttons I am restarting the window manager using Displex Indicator applet. But this is very annoying and also consumes a lot of time(when I am doing my work).\nCan any one suggest any solution for this.\nWhat are up's and down's of using Compiz Vs Metacity.\n\nA: I think some of your CCSM's*(Compiz config settings manager)* plug ins are working bad or something, go to CCSM and click on the Radio button of the Windows Decoration to turn it off and click again to turn it on,it will help.(if it does not work try to do the same thing to other plugins too, rarely those plugins fail to load correctly and give some extra SLOW to the pc) You can move windows without the need of the title bar, just grab alt and click on the window and move :-)\n\nA: I had a similar problem recently. My ktorrent, Amarok and few other applications just wouldn't draw any controls.. kind of like default(and irreversible) full-screen. I played around with CCSM and on disabling Utility->Workaroound and restarting the failing applications solved the problem. I'll still go ahead and check which feature in the plugin in particular causes the problem.\n", "Q: How do I install a minimal Ubuntu - no desktop needed? I keep having to re-install Ubuntu after trying advice.  This is very frustrating.  All I want is to boot to a Linux command prompt.  Please help!\n\nA: Use the Ubuntu minimal CD to install a base system.\nIt will contain the Linux kernel, basic Linux tools and the Debian APT system to install any other packages you might need manually.\nThe downloaded ISO for 11.10 is 23MB and after install (on my system) occupied around 600MB (rest of packages to install the system are downloaded via a network connection).\nYou will be able to choose the packages you want during the installation or after your reboot your system you can install anything individually with apt-get or by choosing packages by typing sudo tasksel.\n\nA: You're probably best off with the Ubuntu Server install. By default it installs only the basic system, resulting in a fast machine with a small memory and disk footprint. http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server/download\n\nA: It might be easiest to do all your command line stuff from a LiveCD such as the one you used to install Ubuntu? If you have access to Windows and a flash drive you can always try UNetBootin to make a LiveUSB.\nhttp://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/\n", "Q: Checking battery state errors First of all, I'm going to need VERY specific answers for I switched to Linux from Windows a week ago and don't know much.

Of course, if I use  suspend the process and use `bg JobID wakeup it, the process is divided with the terminal and run in background. So what the relationship between the current terminal and the process that is triggered by the terminal. Are they father-son or brothers? What's more, how could I use the command line to trigger a process which needn't attach to the terminal. \n\nA: You are right about the father-son behavior. Processes that you are starting from the command line are getting their signals from the terminal instance. Once you close the terminal it will send a HUP (hangup) signal to the depending processes.\nThis is very useful when you have only one terminal so that once you logout it will notify all processes that the user logged out and they should terminate their activity. However, in your case you want to process(es) to ignore this signal and continue their work even after the terminal has been closed. For that we have a special command called nohup that you should prefix with your regular command (e.g. nohup gedit).\nYou may also ask where does the output that went to console goes after a terminal is closed. Well, a file in your home directory called nohup.out is being created and all output from processes will be redirected to it.\nPlease notice, the nohup does not open the process in background so you will still need to add & postfix if you want it (e.g. nohup gedit &).\n\nA: You can use the nohup command to prevent a child process to be exited when you close the terminal. For instance nohup gcalctool. Nohup is for \"No hang-up\". \n", "Q: Ubuntu refuses to output audio via HDMI I have my PC hooked up to speakers and a monitor.

This program is not running as expected on laterer releases of Ubuntu (such as 12.04)\nMy question is, how can I compile a C program using the kernel of 9.10 on Ubuntu 12.04 (the newest release)\nI've installed an Ubuntu 9.10 partition on my computer so I can use the libraries from there. but, nevertheless, I would like to work from my 12.04 partition. \nMaybe this manual could help?\n\nA: You'd be best off creating a \"chroot\" for Ubuntu 9.10, and compiling within that chroot.\nThere's some detail about this in my answer to Building multiple packages for deployment on different Ubuntu versions, but the basic procedure is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use mk-sbuild --name=my-karmic-chroot karmic to create a new chroot for Ubuntu 9.10 (the codename for 9.10 is \"karmic\")\n\n*Use schroot -c my-karmic-chroot to enter the new chroot, and do your compiling\n\n\nIf you're compiling Ubuntu packages, the sbuild tool can be used to automate this.\nNote that this does not use the kernel of 9.10, only the userspace components (including libc and C runtime libraries). You'll still be running the 12.04 kernel. However, do you specifically need the 9.10 kernel?\nIf you really do need the 9.10 kernel, you can use virt-manager to setup a 9.10 virtual machine on your 12.04 install. You can then log into this like it's a real 9.10 machine.\n", "Q: Why does ubuntu get slow after a period of time?

After deleting all partitions you can install Ubuntu and it will create the necessary partitions for you.\n\nA: There exists a liveCD called Darik's Boot and Nuke that will help you with that: http://www.dban.org/\nBasically, you download the iso, burn it on a CD, then boot on said CD. All partitions (INCLUDING connected external hard drives of USB thumb drives or anything, so be careful) will be erased. The process will take a few hours and your hard drive will be blank.\n", "Q: How do I allow a non-default user to use serial device ttyUSB0? I have an Ubuntu 11.10 system with 2 users:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first was created during the installation\n\n*The second instead was created after. It belongs to the sudoers group.\n\n\nNow the problem is that when the second tries to use a device ttyUSB0 the following error is returned:\n\"Could not open serial port /dev/ttyUSB0\"\n\nI was able to fix it by using:\nsudo chown :second_user /dev/ttyUSB0\n\nHowever when I disconnect the device and reconnect it the problem comes back.\nIs there a way to allow different users to access the devices?\nI suppose I have to add the user to a specific group. Currently the owner is root and the group is dialout. However I'm not sure about the group and I don't know how to add the user.\nThanks!\n\nA: As you've noticed, the /dev/ttyUSB0 device has the group of dialout. All you need to do is add the second user to the dialout group:\nsudo adduser second_user dialout\n\nsecond_user will need to log out & log back in again for this to take effect.\n\nA: You could use UDEV. It's a system that triggers every time plug or unplug a device (amongst other stuff). With it, you script various things to happen, including setting permissions.\nRun sudoedit /etc/udev/rules.d/50-ttyusb.rules and stick this in there:\nKERNEL==\"ttyUSB[0-9]*\",NAME=\"tts/USB%n\",SYMLINK+=\"%k\",GROUP=\"uucp\",MODE=\"0666\"\n\nSave, exit and replug and you should be up and running. Setting the permission to 666 allows anybody to write to the device.\nI'm basing this off this page which is from a few years ago but something like this should work if Jeremy's solution doesn't.\n\nA: Fantastic -- the UDEV solution given here was the ticket for me. \nI installed Icom's CS-F3020_F5010_F5020 program via Wine, created the link for the Com port as follows:  \nln -s /dev/ttyUSB0 ~/.wine/dosdevices/com1 but nothing. \n\nThen I realised I needed to change permissions on /dev/ttyUSB0 to allow me to access it. That works great until you unplug/replug the USB in, then you need to re-change the permissions. \nI tried adding my user to dialout group but this didn't solve the problem for some reason.\nUsing UDEV solves the final piece of the puzzle. Now I can program my Icom radio using Linux, plug and unplug the USB/Serial device without any more fuss. Woohoo. Thanks.\n\nA: The udev rules work but as written they have the very nasty side effect of making all ttyUSB* devices accessible to everyone.  This is not good because that may be a security risk depending on what else is on the system.\nInstead use a more selective udev rule.  For example I have a USB device that operates a set of switches.  From dmesg when it is plugged in I can see the ID of the manufacturer and the product code (plus, even, in this case, a serial number for the device).  I can add:\nATTRS{idVendor}==\"0403\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"6001\"\n\nto the kernel lines above and the rule will only apply to that device.  Even better rather than assigning to the MODE variable alone set the group too:\nGROUP=\"whatever\", MODE=\"0660\"\n\nthen only people in group 'whatever' will get write access.\nJohn Bowler\n\nA: The easy way:\nsudoedit /etc/udev/rules.d/50-myusb.rules\n\nSave this text:\nKERNEL==\"ttyUSB[0-9]*\",MODE=\"0666\"\nKERNEL==\"ttyACM[0-9]*\",MODE=\"0666\"\n\nUnplug the device and replug it, and it should be read/write from any user!\n\nA: You can also use chmod (I did it on Raspberry linux).\nIn my case, sudo adduser pi dialout didn't work (\"The user 'pi' is already a member of 'dialout'\", but non root app still didn't have access to serial).\nSee its linkage (/dev/serial0 -> /dev/ttyS0):\npi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls -al /dev/serial*\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 5 Dec 30 18:03 /dev/serial0 -> ttyS0\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 Dec 30 18:03 /dev/serial1 -> ttyAMA0\npi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls -al /dev/ttyS*\ncrw--w---- 1 root tty 4, 64 Jan  7 16:07 /dev/ttyS0\n\nAnd update read/write permission for all users:\npi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo chmod ugo+rw /dev/ttyS0\n\nNow user code (e.g. 'pi' user dotnet core application) can access /dev/serial0.\n\nA: sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER\n\nThen have that user log out and log back in. The command groups will now show dialout as one of the options.\nNow you can use serial terminals such as picocom (my favorite), without sudo:\npicocom --baud 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0\n\nExit picocom with Ctrl + A, then Ctrl + X.\nReferences:\nModified from my personal notes here: https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/eRCaGuy_dotfiles/blob/master/useful_apps/serial_terminals_README.md#installation\n", "Q: How to give restricted access to user I have a home PC and I created a reverse port forwarding to a server. Now I would like to go access to some people to the Home PC through this server. I would like to control the access of the user on this server so I added the following lines to the /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nMatch User restricteduser\n   ChrootDirectory /home/restricteduser\n   AllowAgentForwarding no\n   PermitOpen localhost:3333\n\nbut when I'm trying to connect to the server\nssh restricteduser@serverIP\nrestricteduser@serverIP's password:\n\nI'm getting the following error:\nWrite failed: Connection reset by peer\n\n\nA: The logfiles for the ssh daemon should give you specific information on what's happening here. Check /var/log/auth.log.\nHowever, I suspect that the ChrootDirectory is what is causing problems.\nWhen remoteuser logs in, the ssh daemon tries to chroot to /home/restricteduser and start restricteduser's shell (probably /bin/bash). Because it's chrooted, the ssh daemon will be looking for /home/restricteduser/bin/bash.\nAdditionally, any libraries needed by the shell need to be present in the chroot (check with ldd /bin/bash), and the same applies to any files that the shell expects to be available when started. If the ssh daemon itself needs access to files, they will need to be present too.\nIf restricteduser is to run any programs once logged-in, they'll need to be in the chroot too, as well as their dependent libraries/files.\nThis can get quite complex. If you're simply looking to provide port-forwarding, check out the answer to How to create a restricted SSH user for port forwarding?\n", "Q: GPU Very limited vertex buffers (I think that's the problem...) I run Ubuntu 11.10 on a Dell Latitude D505 with the supposedly dreaded intel 855 graphics card/processor.  I am having problems with several 3D modeling programs, including Blender and K-3D.  Whenever I try to create an object with more than around twenty vertices in either program, the program immediately quits.  I suspect this to be a hardware or driver problem as two programs both suffer from this problem.  I can play some 3D games, but those modeling programs do not work well.  Could it be something to do with not being able to allocate a large enough dynamic vertex buffer? How might I get those modeling programs to work?\n\nA: Try running Blender with software rendering. It might be slower than using hardware acceleration, but it avoids many driver bugs. The official Blender.org releases contain a script to run with software rendering: blender-softwaregl.\n\nA: I fixed a similar problem by installing driconf (its in the repos) and selecting the option to 'force vertex shader support'.\nIts caused by the open source Intel driver been so primitive that it cant handle features yet that windows driver has been doing since 1999.\n", "Q: How to debug a server that crashes once in a few days?

Following you steps this was installed without problems, but it doesn't print. The test page is sent to the printer and I can see it in the spool, but it never prints. \nWhat can be wrong? I run Ubuntu x64.\n\nA: I found the solution here: \nhttp://www.hrupin.com/2010/12/linux-ubuntu-10-04-driver-for-canon-ip3600-ij-printer\nAll is OK there, only that the installation of the deb drivers must be done with the command: sudo dpkg -i --force-all *.deb\nThe procedures I used forced the printer (Canon PIXMA iP3600) to work, but I met problems to install other soft because of the unmet dependencies. Finally I run the command the system recommended:\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nwithout any packages and accept everything. This corrected the problem of dependencies but deleted the printer drivers I installed before (off course!).\nFinally, the solution was to let the system install the printer when  a connect it to the computer and then going in to \"System Settings\" > Printing rigth click in the printer, select Propierties adn then, in the line of Make and Model click on Change. The system will offer a lot of drivers (in my case I selected Canon list), so I tried all the PIXMA ip drivers up than 3000 (The system recommends PIXMA ip3000 but it doesnt work for the ip3600).

How would I do this if it is even possible?\n\nA: The Mailbox Alert let's you display different notifications and play sounds on different folders. Even on search folders. \nDownload\nSet up\n\nA: Starting with Oneiric, the Thunderbird version shipped with Ubuntu has an add-on bundled that handles integration into the message menu. That add-on called \"Message menu and Unitiy Launcher integration\" provides some additional options on the General tab in your Thunderbird settings (not sure about the wording, as I'm re-translating from German here ;) ). Near the options to play a sound file when a new mail arrives and such, you can decide whether the message notification should be lit for new mails and whether to do that for every folder or just for the inbox. I don't know a solution for choosing a custom set of folders, but maybe there's an add-on out there to do that.\nTL;DR\nEdit > Preferences > When new messages arrive > checkbox \"Show in the messaging menu\" > change radio from \"For messages in all folders\" to \"Only for messages in my Inbox folder\"\n\n\nA: There is a bug in the add-on launchpad asking for that kind of feature.

How are app(lication)s published through this service protected against piracy? I mean, if they are managed through the package system then it is easy to find out what files are included and repackage them for distribution through a different channel. is there any kind of digital protection system available to developers? Thank you.\n\nA: There is support for license keys using https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/\nThe developer can then manage these keys, but they have to build license key verification in to the application themselves.\nhttp://developer.ubuntu.com/publish/licence-key-infrastructure/\n\nA: There's nothing built into the package system so yes, you could just dpkg -L <package> to find the files and move them over. Hell, it'd probably just be easier to intercept the actual package (it'll be cached) and move that around.\nThere are various protection mechanisms in certain applications, but there's nothing sitting in Ubuntu watching over everything.\nThat's the way it should be if you ask me but I don't distribute software and I've been on the receiving end of some absolutely terrible DRM, so I'm probably a little biased.\n\nA: As has been explained by others (and shown over and over again if you follow IT news a bit), there is no way to make any digital data that you distribute 100% copy-proof.  One way around that is by running the software on a server and only \"run\" the UI bits on the user's system (basically, how web sites work).\nBut I suggest you also try a more \"social\" protection system: make sure your users want to pay for your application (because it's easy to use, virtually bug-free, and frequently updated with new features), build a community around it, … and they will also be less likely to pass packages and/or keys around.\n", "Q: scp / ssh log on ssh-server \nI work in college network.

Make a separate account per user and place them in the same group (GID) that way you can easily share files and the like, without them being able to sniff around too much.\n\n\nA: By default, the OpenSSH server logs to the AUTH facility of syslog, at the INFO level. If you want to record more information - such as failed login attempts - you should increase the logging level to VERBOSE.\nIt's recommended to log more information if you're curious about malicious SSH traffic.\nTo increase the level, find the following line in your sshd_config:\nLogLevel INFO\nand change it to this:\nLogLevel VERBOSE\nNow all the details of ssh login attempts will be saved in your /var/log/auth.log file.\nMore info at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Configuring\n", "Q: how to turn ubuntu-11.10-alternate-i386 version to the regular ubuntu-11.10-desktop-i386 I just download ubuntu-11.10-alternate-i386.iso. That was a mistake :D but i would like to find out how to make it normal (like ubuntu-11.10-desktop-i386). It is possible? what packages should i install?\nThanx in advance\n:D \n\nA: There is no Ubuntu alternate distribution. What you have downloaded is the Ubuntu alternate installer. The difference between the alternate installer and the standard one is in the way they work (the first is text-based, the latter is graphical), but the result is always the same.\nYou can read more in the download page:\n\nThe text-based alternate installer can be downloaded from a location\n  near you. This installation CD is suited for computers unable to run\n  the graphical desktop based installation, either because their\n  computer does not meet the minimum requirements for the live cd or\n  because their computer requires configuration after the installation\n  is complete in order to use the desktop.\n\nSo the answer to your question is: you don't have do do anything because you already have the \"normal\" Ubuntu.\n\nA: The alternate CD install will get you to the same place, just select the meta package ubuntu-desktop during the installation.\nAfter all is done you will reboot to the same desktop and if you had installed it with the LiveCD.\nThe alternate installation is not so pretty but it is not difficult at all to follow, give it a go and if you are stuck just let us know.\n\nA: The difference between alternate and desktop CDs is the installers. The alternate has a text-based installer for the Ubuntu and therefore requires less computer resources. There is no difference once you have the system installed.\nIf you don't feel comfortable with text based installation I recommend that you go ahead and download the desktop version to have both Live CD and graphical user interface.\n", "Q: How to identify an application executable from ps If I execute \nps -ef | grep java\n\nI get the following \nnoaccess 12144   908   0   Apr 28 ?         697:47 /usr/java/bin/java -server -Xmx128m -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:ParallelGCThreads=4\n\nThough, in this server we have many Java applications running.

I have full backup in .tar.gz file as described here. Now I need to partition hard drive, install grub and unpack archive. How to do that? When I tried to use Live CD it started installing system immediately after partitioning and I need clean partition to unpack my archive to.\n\nA: You can do this, for instance, with the GParted Live CD. \n\nGParted Live is a small bootable GNU/Linux distribution for x86 based computers.\n  It enables you to use all the features of the latest versions of the GParted application.\nGParted Live can be installed on CD, USB, PXE server, and Hard Disk then run on an x86 machine.\nInstallation Instructions\nTo install GParted Live on CD, download the .iso file and burn it as an image to a CD.\nAccounts in GParted live\nGParted live is based on Debian live, and the default account is \"user\", with password \"live\". There is no root password, so if you need root privileges, login as \"user\", then run \"sudo\" to get root priviliges.\n\nBut  if you already have a Ubuntu Live CD you can run GParted or Disc Utility and from there GParted after choosing the option Try Ubuntu instead of Install Ubuntu.\n\nA: Don't run the installer then.

How do I force Rhythmbox to automatically organise my music files into folders (corresponding to the artist and album) in Ubuntu 12.04 beta-1.  Is this functionality currently missing from the new version?\n\nA: This feature is not built into Rhythmbox by default and not among the default set of plug-ins.

It is considered more lightweight than the others I listed, and also keeps to a more \"traditional\" desktop layout.\nAs to the applications that \"use\" it, I'm not sure how to answer that.

Otherwise, whatever desktop environment you're using is providing equivalent functions through other packages.  I don't see why you would need to remove XFCE for Chrome, though, I use XFCE with Chrome (Chromium) just fine.\n\nA: XFCE is a lightweight Desktop environment based on GTK+.

If the session isn't interactive I'm usually getting the command not found error on different programs/functions in the RVM/Ruby toolchain (i.e. gem, rvm, ruby etc.). There are three solutions to the issue I'm aware of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add/remove some lines from .bashrc for each user.

As far as I could trace the problem down this is based on the fact that shell scripts in /etc/profile.d are only run if the user logs into a interactive shell session. Which seems not to be the case if a daemonized process runs or if I or an application logs in trough ssh.\nWhat I'm basically searching for is a way to unify all different kinds of shell sessions to execute scripts in /etc/profile.d.

It would also be good if it could be easily be set up using automated scripts or Chef recipes.\nAs a note: I don't know if not-running scripts in /etc/profile.d is the sole problem I'm facing, I know tough that doing a bash --login usually fixes my issues.\n\nA: Your issue is gnome-terminal not using --login for bash by default:\nhttps://rvm.io/integration/gnome-terminal/\nFor scripting with RVM choose one of the methods described here: https://rvm.io/integration/cron/\nThere is more information on user rc files here:\nhttps://rvm.io/support/faq/#shell_login\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu add a .5\" margin to the top when printing to my HP PSC-750? It's that time of year again when I'm trying to print off all my tax forms.  When I print to my printer, an HP PSC-750, from Ubuntu, I consistently get a 1/2\" margin at the top of the document.  According to this page however, the top margin required by the printer is only .07\".  \nIn previous releases of Ubuntu (such as the 10.04 prerelease I was running this time last year), it appears that something in the print pipeline would automatically scale the output to fit these margins.  This year, 12.04 Beta is trying to use the whole page (unless I manually tell it to scale and manually tell it to use a 1/2\" margin), resulting in part of the text being cut off.\nDoes anyone know why, when using the default print driver provided by Ubuntu, the printer would behave this way?  I see the same behavior whether I have the printer connected directly to my laptop, or if I use my Debian stable server as a print server.  Is this a problem with the printer itself?  The strange 1/2\" top margin has always been a problem since it was first purchased, but I've only ever used it with Linux, never with Windows, so I can't say whether this is a Linux-specific problem.\n\nA: It sounds like it's not printing with the correct page size. Please check the default setting in System Settings / Printing / [your printer] / Properties / Printer Options.\nIf you are sure the page size is correct, please file a bug on launchpad and attach the CUPS error log right after you printed something with wrong margins [1].

My printouts are cut.\nSystem is Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with HP Photosmart 6510 printer.\nHere what I found (talking about A4 and cm, however, should be the same with Letter and inches, I just cannot try it with my setup)\n\n\n*\n\n*Printer (at least mine) has a \"scale-to-fit\" options which allows pdf to be rendered properly.  The printout is scaled down, so it is smaller, but the margins are looking good.\nPrinters ->  -> Job Options -> scale-to-fit\nThis is of course not acceptable for predefined paper positions or if I want data to be as large as possible (for me Music Sheets and Labels for CDs)\nso there is\n\n*the option to use the full paper size\nDuring print:\nPage Setup -> Paper Size -> ... Borderless ...\nThis allows to print pages without borders.\nHope this helps to solve you problem as well ;-)\nKlaus\n\nA: Historically, many printers have not been able to print to the edges of the paper.  It quickly became standard practice to leave a 1/2\" margin all the way around.  In some cases it is even enforced by printer drivers.  It looks better, is convenient for holding papers in your hands, for binding them on the left or top, and for writing notes in the margins so today most programs default to having 1/2\" margins.\nIf your printer driver will permit it, most programs that can print will also allow you to adjust the margins.  You may even be able to set the default margins in whatever program(s) you use.\n\nA: I solved this issue - HP Officejet 6500 Wireless and 12.04 LTS - by changing the driver.\nFirst go the the printer window and remove the printer.\nThen add a new printer and choose the proper driver (the one including hpcups was the wrong one and the one including hpijs was ok).\nMargins are now back to normal.\n\nA: Again a problem with Printer Margins caused by MusicSheets on PDF using Ubuntu 12.04 (same on 13.10).\nProblem: Header is not printed correctly, header text is simply cut in the first lines.\nWhat I did (Evince GNOME Document Viewer 3.4.0 on Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS):\nPrint with following options set during printing:\n.. to allow maximum output\n\nPage setup -> Paper size = A4 Borderless 210x297mm\n\n... to show headers properly\n\nPage Handling -> Page Scaling = Fit to Printable Area\nPage Handling -> Select page size using document page size = tick option to select\n\n... and everything is fine and pretty!\n\nA: Since latest versions (in mind 13.10, 14.04) have fall down this option you may take the command line way, to list printer options use lptoptions -p <printer name> to define options use lpoptions -p <printer name> -o option=value\nFor this precise issue, you should use lpoptions -p <printer name> -o fitplot\nAnd after this command you will get the option fitplot=true listed.\nHave a nice day!\n\nA: I can confirm SUCCESS.\nProblem: Printing a PDF on XUbuntu 14.04 cut of the margins at the top and bottom.\nSolution in my case: Updated the HPlip package.\n\n*\n\n*Downlaod the package from http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/hplip/hplip-3.14.10.run\n\n*Open terminal and change directory to download folder.\n\n*Make Executable by entering chmod +x hplip-3.14.10.run\n\n*run bash hplip-3.14.10.run\n\n*in my case I chose to override existing older version but it would be smart to delete it first\n\n*Restarted PC\n\n*Open HPlip utility\n\n*Added new printer and chose to install it with the CUPS WebInterface\n\n*Printed PDF successfully with all the margins correctly printed!\n\n\nA: I tried printing from Qpdfview for the first time instead of Evince and was able to adjust the top and other margins in the Properties. The other printing options are similar to evince. As the person who asked the question, I too print a great number of tax forms and for the first time it printed it as it should be.\nAnother advantage is to be able to shrink the window far smaller than Evince.\n", "Q: Log SSH activity All, I have an Ubuntu host that accepts SSH connections.

So, if you have one file named \"foo.rb\", the command that gets executed is find . -name foo.rb. (\"find a file named foo.rb\")\nIt gets even worse if you've multiple files in the current directory (say, \"foo.rb\" and \"bar.rb\"). Then the command becomes find . -name foo.rb bar.rb, which will cause an argument error for find.\nTo prevent the shell from expaning the glob pattern *.rb, you must either quote it (either single or double quotes will do) or escape the asterisk. The below commands have equivalent behavior:\nfind . -name \"*.rb\"\nfind . -name '*.rb'\nfind . -name \\*.rb\n\n", "Q: How to disable Synaptics pinch-to-zoom support in evince (PDF viewer)?

In this file I set GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"\" , removing it's quiet splash value to display the boot messages when booting (splash enables the splash screen with condensed text output and quiet splash results in just the splash screen image being shown), put a # in front of GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT to display the grub menu and set  GRUB_TIMEOUT=10 to give the user 10 seconds to make a selection.

Want to make sure grub resume the right OS after hibernate I installed windows7 and ubuntu 11.10 on my asus laptop.  I have a large data partition (NTFS) shared by both OS, so I want the laptop wake up to the original OS after hibernate.  However, GRUB doesn't seem to have a notion of which OS started hibernate.  Is there some way to inform GRUB the OS started hibernate.\nHere is my idea (hopefully, someone has better ideas way ahead of me), but don't know where to start:\non ubuntu, before going into hibernation, set GRUB_TIMEOUT=0 and run grub-set-default to ubuntu.  This way, next time GRUB has to boot/resume into ubuntu.  Upon resume from hibernate or at shutdown, set GRUB_TIMEOUT=10 (or some other non-zero value).\nBut this only solves half of the problem (if the idea is doable).  I still don't know how to set GRUB default before W7 hibernate.\nReally love to head suggestions.\n\nA: If you change /etc/default/grub to have the two lines:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=saved\nGRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true\n\nIt will always pick the last OS booted, thus bringing up the hibernated OS without your intervention; however, it will also do this even if you didn't hibernate.\n\n(Thanks to @drs305 who wrote the GRUB 2 Basics guide on the Ubuntu Forums.)\n\nA: I've run Ubuntu 11.10 and Windows 7 alongside each-other, with a separate NTFS data partition as you describe, for some time now, and my solution has been to just ignore this, and get to the GRUB menu regardless if I shut down or hibernated the last time I left my computer.\nThe effects of this are the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hibernate from OS (a). The computer will save state to disk and shut down.\n\n*Start the computer. It will go to the GRUB menu as usual. Choose which OS to start.\n\n*If you start in OS (a), you will resume from hibernation just as expected.\n\n*If you start in OS (b), you will start that OS from whatever state you left it last (hibernated/shut down).\n\n*If you started in OS (b), then restart the computer and shut down OS (a), it will resume from hibernation just the way it did without starting OS (b) in between.\nIn short, my machine seems to handle hibernation and shut down of the two operation systems independently, and the only feature I don't have that you talk about, is the lack of choice in which OS to start after hibernation. This makes it possible to, for instance, work on something in Windows, realize you need to do something in Ubuntu so you hibernate, restart in Ubuntu, shut down and resume Windows - something that would not be possible with your desired setup.\nI leave no warranties that this is indeed trouble-free, or works on any machine - but so far it's been trouble-free for me, and worked very well on my machine.\n\nUpdate in response to comment:\nIf chkdsk starts when you boot into W7 after hibernating and using Ubuntu in between, it might be because Ubuntu mounted the W7 partition automatically. Probably Ubuntu changed something on the disk, which got W7 confused.\nTry disabling automatic mount of the W7 partition - either by commenting out the correct line in /etc/fstab or by setting some options in a GUI somewhere (for some reason I can't find the correct settings program...)\n", "Q: Where I can find a summary of Ubuntu's current functionality on touch screen devices?

But where do I turn to for support? \nThe game company says it does not support its game ported to Linux as they seemingly where not involved in that. Ubuntu does not seem to provide support unless I pay for it (again) and it seems totally unfair to bug the user community with this issue.

I also want some other applications to only start in GNOME-shell (like Shutter). \nIs there, say, something I can add before the command in \"Startup Applications\" that does this for me? Or do I need to install some sort of extension?\n\nA: This can be a starting point for your question. You can place a conditional statement withing the command to execute field in the Startup Application. This command will check what is the current desktop session and will act based on that. E.g.  \n\nif [ \"$DESKTOP_SESSION\" == \"ubuntu\" ]; then (echo \"Unity\"); else (echo \"Gnome\") ; fi\n\nThe condition checks if it is Unity session and prints Unity if true. Otherwise, it will print Gnome.\nYou can replace the echo commands with any command you wish to execute or omit the else part.\nAnother example:  \n\nif [ \"$DESKTOP_SESSION\" == \"ubuntu\" ]; then (shutter); fi\n\nThis will run Shutter application only in Unity.\n", "Q: Rails application directory has different $PATH value than other directories on the system I recently installed Rails 3.2.1 (Gem version 1.8.7) running on Ruby 1.9.3 on Ubuntu 11.10.  I installed ruby, rails, and gem using rvm.  I currently only have the one version installed.  When I type \"ruby -v\" in a normal directory I see 1.9.3 as expected and when I type rails -v I see 3.2.1 as expected.  \nThis allows me to type \"rails new sample\" to create a rails application called sample.  If I cd into the \"sample\" directory though and type \"rails server\" it tells me rails is not installed.  So I checked the $PATH variable and it is not what I expect to see.  Here is the output as I currently see it.\n\nIf in the \"sample\" directory I type \"rvm --default use 1.9.3\", rails is once again recognized.  Does anyone have any idea how this occurs or an idea of what to start searching for?  Thanks in advance.\n\nA: First, this isn't really an answer as to why it has that, but rather a solution/workaround.\nFirst, lets make a rails application:\n\njrg@discovery:~/code$ rails new sample\n\nThen, we need to make a .rvmrc file for our application. More on why thats important over here, but the basic idea is that its isolated. Save this inside the rails application sample (so if its in ~/code, we need to save the .rvmrc in ~/code/sample/.rvmrc)\nAll the .rvmrc file needs to contain is something like this:\n\nrvm --create 1.9.3@$project\n\nChange $project to whatever you want, it doesn't matter.\nThen, cd into ~/code/sample, and you'll be greeted with a scary warning:\n\nBecause you know whats in this one, you can safely type y for yes, although I highly recommend that you type v (for view) with any strange .rvmrc's - they can be a security risk, although I haven't seen any.\nNow, run bundle install to install all your gems.

I just checked my processes over last 3 hours and python was running over 90 percent,sometimes 110.whats causing this ?it says something about a checkbox running when i hover over it.I uninstalled two apps-onboard keyboard and system testing and it seems that python is eased off and not even listed in processes.Is this a bug or can anyone tell me what python does exactly?whats a checkbox?I think the last thing I tried to do before this happened was run system testing and testing halted.When I closed it out then reopened it had a box open saying another checkbox was running\n\nA: Python is an \"interpreter\", similar to Java for instance. It runs applications. Any application that's written in the Python programming language will be run by a python process. This means that saying \"python is running 90%\" doesn't really tell us much. It simply means \"some application is running\". \nIn this case, however, you provided a hint. Checkbox is the actual Python program that is running. It is a system to test different types of software. It is used for System Testing, which is used to test hardware support, among other things. \nUninstalling an application doesn't exit the application (otherwise, upgrading the system while it is running would be impossible), so even if you have uninstalled system testing, it will still be running. It is difficult to know exactly why it doesn't quit. There's too many unknowns. However, if you log out and back in, the problem will go away. Or if you had to enter your password when running the test (running it as the 'root' user), a reboot will exit that application if it doesn't stop.  \nOtherwise, you can open System Monitor and find the Python process running the \"checkbox\" instance. Then you can right-click and kill it.\n", "Q: Do I have to set up mail for Ubuntu to be able to mail users? I remember Debian automatically sending mail to users (to report a failed sudo authentication attempt, for example). On Ubuntu is mail of some kind automatically set up? I created a cron job, and nothing is appearing in /var/spool/mail. If there's a standard/obvious way to set up mail in Ubuntu, what is it?\n\nA: If you haven't done it yet you will need to install postfix (sudo apt-get install postfix) or sSMTP (sudo apt-get install ssmtp) to replicate the sendmail commands.\n\nA: Ubuntu has a policy of not listening on any network ports (not running any network services) by default. That means no mailserver. So, yes, you need to install one if you want one.\n\nA: You can set up postfix to do local mail delivery only.\nFirst,\nsudo apt-get install postfix\nAfter a moment, you'll be prompted to make some choices about how you want postfix installed. (If you make a mistake, you can get back here with sudo dpkg-reconfigure postfix).\nWhen prompted, choose \"Local only\" as your general configuration. When prompted for a system mail name, you can enter your machine's hostname (e.g. gribble), its fully qualified domain name (e.g. gribble.strickland.us), or localhost. I suggest choosing the former or the latter.\nWith that done, do sudo postconf -e \"home_mailbox = Maildir/\" to tell postfix where to place users' mail. This appends home_mailbox = Maildir/ to the end of /etc/postfix/main.cf. sudo service postfix reload to tell postfix to reload the configuration file.\nNow you can install a mail client that understands how to read mail out of your maildir, such as mutt: sudo apt-get install mutt\nTo configure mutt, create a file ~/.muttrc with something like the following in it:\nset mbox_type=Maildir\nset folder=\"~/Maildir\"\nset mask=\"!^\\\\.[^.]\"\nset mbox=\"~/Maildir\"\nset spoolfile=\"~/Maildir\"\n\nRun mutt and it will probably complain about your maildir not being there. This is fine -- postfix will create it as soon as we get some email.\nIn mutt, press m to compose an email. At the bottom of the screen, you'll be prompted for a recipient (you should be able to type user@hostname or just a user name) and subject, then your editor will pop up so you can type an email. Write something, save, exit, and press y to send. The user you sent to should have a Maildir appear in their home directory -- they can then use mutt (after creating a similar .muttrc) to read it!\n", "Q: Cannot receive updates or finish upgrading after interrupted 12.04 install The problem started when I was trying to download the 12.04 Beta 1 but didn't have sufficient time to complete the install.

How do I restore these settings back to their default values?\n\nA: In Ubuntu 12.10 per-user mouse settings (and others too) are managed by settings daemon, and their configuration is stored in dconf database. To restore the default settings you want to set the values new users have on those fields = -1 (or resetting them).\nSteps to set default per-user settings, using dconf-editor (low-level graphical tool):\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch dconf-editor.

I found that the sliders to the left most position did not feel like the defaults at all after messing with them.  After some research I found out the following information to fine tune how the mouse works which may be helpful to some other visiting this page.\n\nIt looks like there is a rather complex set of tuning functions available for setting the mouse behavior.  You can see all the settings here.  The most important ones are the Acceleration Profile and Constant Deceleration. Here's what I found works for me, and how I set the values.\nFirst we want to see what the properties are:\nxinput list             # Displays connected devices (Find ID of your mouse)\nxinput list-props <ID>  # Displays properties of device\n\nNext, I put my desired settings inside a script called fixmouse.sh.

Your mileage may vary. Play with the different profiles and values for deceleration. The higher the Deceleration, the slower the mouse moves.  It might also be a good idea to drop the initial values from xinput list-props to another script called unfixmouse.sh while you are tinkering.\n\nA: What I've found is that deleting the gconf mouse folder resets everything to defaults.

On projects.gnome.org I read that evince/Document Viewer supports xps-files. But when I try to open an xps-file I get the error message\n\nUnable to open documentFile type Zip archive (application/zip) is not supported\n\nReading \"the full list of supported document formats\" on live.gnome.org I can't find xps there.\nNow I ask myself (and you): Isn't Document Viewer able to open xps-files, or is there something wrong with that xps-file I try to open? \nI specifically want to do this with Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric.\n\nI'd like to see a solution for Evince or Gnome in general, not get a recommendation for a KDE application like here.\n\nA: There is nothing wrong with what you are doing, the problem is that for Ubuntu 11.10 the necessary library to open .xps files was not included and at the moment there is no package for it.\nThis has apparently and possibly will be included by default in Ubuntu 12.04.\nYou can add support to convert .xps files in to another format tough. On the packager's PPA you can read\n\nNote: The evince version in ubuntu 11.10 oneiric ocelot doesn't work with xps (segmentation fault when opening the file) and there are several packages to be backported. I've decided not to backport it. It works in ubuntu 12.04 precise pangolin.\n  If you need to read an xps file, package libgxps-utils provides enough conversion tools, e.g. command: xpstopdf myfile.xps.\n\nThat means that you can add the PPA to your system and at least convert your .xps to another format that can be opened in your system.\n\nTo do that add the PPA to your system\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:medigeek/evince-xps\n\nUpdate and install the necessary tools to convert your files\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libgxps-utils\n\nYou will then be able to convert your .xps files in to another format as described in the PPA description\nxpstopdf foo_file.xps\n\nwill convert a file called foo_file.xps in to a .pdf file.\n\nFor more information on PPAs and how to use them please have a look at any of these 2 posts\n\n\n*\n\n*What are PPAs and how do I use them?\n\n*Are PPA's safe to add to my system and what are some \"red flags\" to watch out for?\n", "Q: Is there a way to get an access token via Ubuntuone oauth? I'm working on a web app that includes a file export to Dropbox and Skydrive and i wanted to add UbuntuOne, too. That means i need access to files and if i understand the U1 API docs correctly the only oauth token with access to files is full access token:\nhttps://one.ubuntu.com/developer/account_admin/issue_tokens/cloud\nBut requesting a full access token requires the user to type in his username and password into my app, is that correct? Or is there another way to get a request a token with access to the user's files the same way a limited access token is requested, i.e. the user doesn't have to provide his username and password to my app?\n\nA: There is. As a web app, you may use the standard OAuth dance against Ubuntu One to obtain an OAuth token. \nUse URLs https://one.ubuntu.com/oauth/request to get a token, redirect the user to https://one.ubuntu.com/oauth/authorize/?description=yourappname to have it authorized, and https://one.ubuntu.com/oauth/access/ to convert it to a real token which you can save and use to authenticate requests on the user's behalf.\n\nA: This should work: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/883106/\nThere's some example code in a library I wrote that goes through these steps:\nhttps://code.launchpad.net/restful-u1\n", "Q: rsync not working between NTFS/FAT and EXT I have music that I play in my car, from an FAT32 USB stick.  The folder which I use to put songs on is stored on my EXT4 hard drive.  I add/remove/retag songs regularly and occasionally want to rsync the changes to the USB stick.  But for some unknown reason (maybe permissions?), rsync copies all the files every time rather than just changed ones.  I am calling rsync like:\nrsync -vrlptgD source dest\n\nHow can I make it work like I want it to (i. e. know when a file hasn't been changed and don't copy it)?\n\nA: I was having a similar issue under OSX, and Glutanamate's answer didn't help.  Some of the files differ by an hour; this might be because I tend to cross timezones relatively often.  Other files are off by a day or even a month.  I'm not sure why this is.  Checksumming on some of the files with widely differing timestamps shows that they are, indeed, identical.\nIn any case, it looks like the --size-only option, which tells rsync to ignore timestamps, will work for my purposes.  -c / --checksum (as mentioned by Javier) also works, but takes a bit longer.  I timed it and it took about a minute to compare checksums for the GB or so in the subdirectory I'm working with.  Of course the speed at which this happens will be dependent on the slowest drive in the system; in my case, that's the SD card in my phone.  However, that was after I'd already been doing some file manipulation (including checksumming), so many of the files may have already been copied into RAM cache.\n\nA: Javier Rivera's answer works, but it takes quite long for rsync to check and compare all file checksums. I found that using the following option worked better for me:\nrsync -rtv --modify-window=1 /source /dest\n\nThe --modify-window=1 switch allows for a variance of ±1s on the timestamps. With this option enabled, timestamp comparison will be more lenient and look over the minuscule time differences between NTFS/FAT and Unix file systems.\nSource (ger): http://www.kai-hildebrandt.de/tutorials/rsync.html\nP.S.: Please be aware that DST will cause full file transfers twice a year. See here for further details and possible solutions.\n\nA: You should also avoid using the popular -a option. My recommendation on FAT32 is\n rsync -vrc --delete --progress --no-p source  destination\n\n--no-p       : no permission\n--delete     : delete unmatched files and folder in destination(if you really want this)\n--progress   : show progress during transfer. It is good for large files.\n\nA: Timestamps in FAT32 are too different from unix ones to rely on them to check for file changes, you should use also the -c switch, it will force rsync to compare all the files to detect changes instead of relying in timestamps. It will work, but it's slower.\nFinally, there are a couple of options in your command that can't work with FAT32 file systems.\n\n\n*\n\n*-l will preserve links, FAT32 has no concept of links\n\n*-p will try to preserve permission, again no permissions on FAT32\n\n*-t will try to preserve modification timestamps, there is only one timestamp on FAT32\n\n*-g will try to preserve group ownership, again not supported by FAT32\n\n*-D will try to preserver special files and devices, you now what comes here.\n\n\nAs htorque comments, the invalid options will no hurt you, they just will do nothing. But you must add -c switch.\nThis:\nrsync -vrc source dest\n\nshould work (at least it works on my computer).\n\nA: That's too many flags (-vrlptgD) you're using. Remember, rsync is a Linux utility and doesn't work with Fat32 and NTFS effectively. \nYou'd have to hunt for tricks to be able to use it. \nTry:\nrsync -rvh --size-only --progress --delete /path/to/ext4/ /path/to/fat32/\n\nMore info here\n", "Q: How do I revert all packages to their official versions? I've installed a number of packages from PPAs, and I would like to revert to official versions now. Many of the PPAs no longer exist in /etc/apt/sources.list.d, so ppa-purge will not work on them.\nWhat is the most straight-forward way for that?\n\nA: Well you can remove and reinstall the packages\nppa-purge is probably still your best bet for a clean escape. Just re-adding the PPA the package came from and then using ppa-purge to kill it. I'm not sure how many PPAs you have installed but if it's fewer than 10, I'd be looking at doing this. \nIf you think that method is too soft I've just written some bash-porn to help identify package versions whose installation source now only exists locally in /var/lib/dpkg/status.

Change the routers and DNS settings in your DHCP.conf to this -->\noption routers 192.168.10.1;\n#8.8.8.8 is google's public DNS server (this is optional)\n#Include the DNS IP addresses in your /etc/resolv.conf file\noption domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8, (IP addresses in your /etc/resolv.conf)\n\nNote:\nIf you want to save your iptables rules, than after you set them, run this command to save it to a file --> iptables-save > /etc/iptables_rules\nYou can see the placement to load the rules in the /etc/network/interfaces settings I provided. This will happen when the network manager is loaded/reloaded.\nLet me know if this helps.\n", "Q: How can i block updates for specific application? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to prevent updating of a specific package? \n\nI want keep my system updated but i don't want that a specific application is updated!

In the last week it's started freezing randomly (every few hours or minutes). I can still move the mouse and switch to other terminals with ctrl+alt.\nI thought this was purely a gui issue as I could continue entering commands (mouse clicks and keys) which seem to be processed once the system resumes (generally 30 seconds to a few minutes). I'm using gnome and metacity.\nI can't identify anything in particular that triggers the freezes. Saving a file in LibreOffice causes the system to hang. I tried disabling most of the services I've installed (dropbox, autokey, etc.) but doesn't help.\nSwitching to another terminal and running top, the CPU column is shared equally among all of my processes (i.e. non-root). I have no idea what that signifies.

my desktop computer. My laptop doesn't suffer from this.\nBoth have the last version of ubuntu. \nThe problem you described just happened to me today, googling on the subject pointed me here, so i tried to strace to see what was happening ...\nMy desktop PC have a ssd drive with async,discard and noatime options in the fstab.\nResult of the strace\nI think there is an issue with the clock on gnome-shell and maybe a cache issue.\nWith the gnome-shell pid :\n# sudo strace -e open -p 16725\nProcess 16725 attached - interrupt to quit\nopen(\"/etc/localtime\", O_RDONLY)        = 32\nopen(\"/etc/localtime\", O_RDONLY)        = 32\nopen(\"/etc/localtime\", O_RDONLY)        = 32\nopen(\"/etc/localtime\", O_RDONLY)        = 32\nopen(\"/etc/localtime\", O_RDONLY)        = 32\nopen(\"/etc/localtime\", O_RDONLY)        = 32\nopen(\"/etc/localtime\", O_RDONLY)        = 32\n\nYes, one read every second !\nThe clock ?\nI was showing the seconds in my gnome-shell title bar, i thought it was that. Obviously not.  Then i completly removed the clock from the title bar, because i was still having gnome-shell reading /etc/localtime every second.\nHow to remove clock from panel in gnome-shell?\nOnce the clock was visually removed, same problem.  Turned off all tweaks in gnome-tweak-tool, same problem.\nSince the file is still read every second, it may cause a sort of buffer issue with the hard drive which may cause the freeze. (I think).\nEDIT: Hint ? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4554271/how-to-avoid-excessive-stat-etc-localtime-calls-in-strftime-on-linux\nSwitched back to unity\nIn addition to the freezes, this bug is a real hard drive killer if you are not using the noatime option in your fstab. (see ref1 and ref2)\nThis is why i just switched back to the default ubuntu desktop, unity.  I can't afford to loose my SSD drive while a fix is found.\nNo more freezes for now\nBut to answer, I do not have the issue anymore, pointing the guilt on gnome-shell for now.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Can I boot from external usb hdd?

I would also like to increase the space in the ubuntu partition. Please explain this in easy to understand steps, as I am new to ubuntu.\n\nA: This can be done (as the various available duplicates will point out) but unless there's been a major development that I haven't yet seen, it's definitely not something for a beginner.\nI would suggest a new install from CD/USB alongside your existing Windows installation (proper dual-boot, not Wubi) and after you've copied out all the files you want to keep, you can minimise the space Windows takes up or get rid of it altogether.\nI say this for two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing Ubuntu from scratch takes very little time and has less chance to mess everything up.\n\n*Converting the Wubi soft-partition to a real one and installing a bootloader (which you'll have to if you migrate your Wubi install) is very technical and takes a long time in itself.\n\n\nA: Unfortunatly, you can not do this because you have a WUBI installation of ubuntu. \nWhat this means is that:\n\n\n*\n\n*WUBI installation depends on Windows OS existence\n\n*WUBI installation of Ubuntu is just like a software installation in windows\n\n*WUBI installation of Ubuntu is made in a big file inside windows\n\n\nFor a single Ubuntu boot you will need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your files (in external hard disk)\n\n*Download Ubuntu 11.10\n\n*Burn it on a CD or USB\n\n*Boot from CD or USB\n\n*Select in installation mode \"Remove Windows and install only Ubuntu\"\nThe link here is self explanatory : http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download \nJust follow the 4 steps\n\n", "Q: Alternative terminal for Ubuntu that supports predefined sessions I am looking for a better (GUI) terminal for Ubuntu that supports:\n\n\n*\n\n*tabs, preferably colored ones\n\n*change notification - output is changed on an inactive terminal\n\n*define a list of servers to connect to\n\n\nThe default terminal app does supports tabs but not the things above.\n\nA: After looking around for a bit, the closest application to meet all your requirements would be terminator \n\n\n*\n\n*It doesn't have tabs but you can split the windows any way you want to.\n\n*It does have options to customize colors and other things the way you want.\n\n*It also has a notification plugin that you can setup to use to watch for inactivity or activity, depending on your need. There's a question here, What do the ActivityWatch and InactivityWatch plugins do?, that you can use to understand this plugin.\n\n\nA: You should give Guake a try. It's full of features.\nAvailable from the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\nA: I prefer byobu with tmux and gnome-terminal.\nYou can set your profiles in gnome-terminal to start any command you like as a shell. So you could even create different profiles and set the custom command as byobu or tmux with different config files.\n", "Q: Awesome-WM inside gnome-shell -> Get rid of top panels I am using awesome-wm now, and was trying to get it working with gnome-shell.

Now it's only displaying the time.\nscreen: \nThanks ;) \n\nA: Quote from the same wiki page you linked:\n\"You will likely want to choose either gnome-panel or awesome's main wibox as your panel. If you choose to disable your wibox, configure your rc.lua to not start it up. If you choose to disable gnome-panel, it is easiest to stop using gnome-session and run your session in the traditional way.\"\n", "Q: Where can I find ASROCK E350M1 Integrated AMD Radeon HD 6310 graphics driver? I just built a desktop computer using an ASRock E350M1 board, powered by an AMD Fusion E-350 APU (AMD Radeon HD 6310 GPU Model). I installed Ubuntu 10.04. Did all the updates.

An fsck log is written to a RAM-backed filesystem (tmpfs) that is available for writing at this time, and it continues to be available after boot at /run/initramfs/fsck.log.

While installing, I would create the user \"chris\". Afterwards I would configure the desktop and install lots of stuff for the user \"chris\". Some of this stuff would be i.e. RVM (ruby version manager) which will create lots of files in my /home/chris folder. So at the end there would be lots of stuff in my /home/chris folder, incl. files refering to \"/home/chris/some_stuff/...\", etc.\nWhen all is set and done, I would make an image of the installation using fsarchiver and restore the image to 2 other identical laptops. So far everything works perfect!\nThe problem is:\nThe 2 other laptops need to have 2 different users: \"marco\" and \"flo\". Those 2 users need exactly the installed stuff I have in /home/chris.

My initial user account /home/chris won't make any sense on Marco's laptop, right?\nAnd here comes the most important question:\nHow will I manage to find out all files which contain the string \"/home/chris\" \n and change it to \"/home/marco\"?\nMaybe there is a better way of making a default install on a default user, backup the installation and then redistribute it to any other user.

After running sudo oem-config-prepare, the oem user is nuked and on the next boot the user is asked to set up their user account.\nNow you have two options for spreading this to more than one computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*You could go through the (frankly) tedious process of remastering the disk so you create a custom installation disk for the users. I'm not even sure how to remaster the Alternative disk but I'm sure it's possible... \n\n*Or you could install in OEM mode and get to the point where you've got the system prepped and have run oem-config-prepare, then take an image of the disk with Clonezilla (or other) and zap that image into the rest of your machines. On boot they'll each be asked to set up a user and that's what you're after. It'll probably take up more space but if you have a fast wired network, it shouldn't take too long and it's almost zero-effort for each machine.\nIf you want to have specific things in the home directory of the new user, you should copy them into /etc/skel during the oem preparation (ie before you run oem-config-prepare). These files will be copied out when the first real user is generated.\nThis allows you to store settings, special directory setup and things like that. You don't have to copy over the entire contents of /home/oem/ - you can pick and choose.\n", "Q: Add New Printer disabled - grayed out using Gnome Shell  I'm running Gnome Shell in Ubuntu 11.10.\nWhen I go to Gnome Control Center and click on printers, the Add New Printer button is grayed out (disabled).\nWhen I logged into Unity, I added the network printer with no problem, and the printer remained when I logged back into Gnome Classic (Gnome Shell).

Is it filesystem related?\n\nA: *\n\n*I'm guessing you have about 125 folders? That would explain the differing number of files. \n\n*The difference in size can be caused by a number of factors, I guess Windows reported GiB's => 15GB*1024*1024*1024 = 16,106,127,360  and Linux is reporting in GB's => 16,2GB * 1000,000,000 = 16,200,000,000.

If there is an application, does it work like \"Time Machine\" where it save backups of your computer and if wanted, go back to an earlier time on the computer for example where an virus was not there?\nHere is an definition of Time Machine that Apple wrote:\n\nTime Machine is the built-in backup that works with your Mac and an external drive (sold separately) or Time Capsule. Connect the drive, assign it to Time Machine, and start enjoying some peace of mind. Time Machine automatically backs up your entire Mac, including system files, applications, accounts, preferences, music, photos, movies, and documents. But what makes Time Machine different from other backup applications is that it not only keeps a spare copy of every file, it remembers how your system looked on any given day—so you can revisit your Mac as it appeared in the past.\n\n\nA: You could do a full backup of the root folder \"/\" with Déjà dup, the default backup client of ubuntu. When restoring you can use a live cd to avoid your system entering in a weird state. \n\nA: You could give a try to Back in Time. It is in repository.\nIn documentation he explains why he do it.\n\nWhy did I write the application ? When I read about Apple’s TimeMachine I thought it’s nice tool to have. I searched for equivalent applications for Linux and I find TimeValut and FlyBack.\n\nSince February I'm making backups with it, but never had tried a full or partial restore.\nIt uses rsync and not the mechanism like inotify used by Time Machine. So it is running every x time and not each time the file is wrote.\n\nA: You might also consider TimeShift. The project page is on Launchpad.\nTimeshift's main use is to create a system restore point before making (potentially risky) system changes, as stated on the web site:\n\nTimeShift is similar to applications like rsnapshot, BackInTime and TimeVault but with different goals.\nTimeShift is designed to protect only system files and settings. User files such as documents, pictures and music are excluded. This ensures that your files remains unchanged when you restore your system to an earlier date. If you need a tool to backup your documents and files please take a look at the excellent BackInTime application which is more configurable and provides options for saving user files.\n\n\nA: You might have a look at Zaloha.sh and the add-on script Zaloha_Snapshot.sh.\nThe former synchronizes your data to a backup directory, and the latter creates a hardlink-based snapshot of the backup directory, capturing the state of the backup directory at that time.\nBoth solutions contain documentation and demo cases in their repositories.\nIt is clear that this is not a complete Time Machine solution. The automatic scheduling and ageing (removal) of obsolete snapshots is not there.

It'd be nice if I could somehow exempt these setups.\nI'm using 11.10 Oneiric, which uses NetworkManager.\n\nA: The following script, put in /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-disable-wireless-when-wired, mostly works—it disables wireless even when I want to share wired with wireless or vice-versa.\nTo do this, run the following command in terminal:\nsudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-disable-wireless-when-wired\n\nAnd paste the following code into the text editor.\n#!/bin/sh\nmyname=${0##*/}\nlog() { logger -p user.info -t \"${myname}[$$]\" \"$*\"; }\nIFACE=$1\nACTION=$2\n\nrelease=$(lsb_release -s -c)\ncase ${release} in\n    trusty|utopic) nmobj=nm;;\n    *) nmobj=radio;;\nesac\n\ncase ${IFACE} in\n    eth*|usb*|en*)\n        case ${ACTION} in\n            up)\n                log \"disabling wifi radio\"\n                nmcli \"${nmobj}\" wifi off\n                ;;\n            down)\n                log \"enabling wifi radio\"\n                nmcli \"${nmobj}\" wifi on\n                ;;\n        esac\n        ;;\nesac\n\nThen save and exit.\nNote the following conditions on the script, as documented in the NetworkManager manual page:\n\nEach script should be:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*a regular file,\n  \n*owned by root,\n  \n*not writable by group or other,\n  \n*not set-uid,\n  \n*and executable by the owner.\n  \n\nInstead of nmcli radio wifi off (or nmcli nm wifi off for older\nversions of NetworkManager), there is also rfkill block wifi.\nHowever, if rfkill is used instead of nmcli, newer versions of\nNetworkManager will turn wifi back on during boot.\n\nA: Based on the other answer, I came up with this (tested on Kubuntu 20.04).\nIt auto-disconnects wifi on wired connection, except for connection names ending with -hotspot (like the default names Kubuntu uses for created access point connections). It allows sharing wireless hotspot from cable. So, instead of disabling radio for all WiFi, it just disconnects the network you're using. When the cable is unplugged, it reconnects the wireless device wlo1, which makes it reconnect the last used WiFi network.\nNote that if you turn off the computer without cable and plug it before turning it on, it may start with both wifi and wired connections.

Obviously I did something wrong because although I had a system menu on booting (is it normal to appear DOS-like?) which gave me an option of booting into windows 7, I was unable to do so.  Also, when I booted into Ubuntu, my Windows 7 drive was not available.  The Windows 7 drive was an internal 1TB drive partitioned into a 200GB (OS) and a second partition making up the remainder.\nI was still unable to access this Windows 7 drive even after deleting Ubuntu as I kept getting an 'requires an NTFS drive' error, or something similar.  I could not even re-install Windows 7 as the disk was not recognised.  I did eventually get the drive back by but I cannot for the life of me remember how.  I did try to recover my lost W7 data using Ontrack Easy Recovery (which has always been succesfull in the past for post format recovery) but it would not recognise the 1TB although it was now formatted as NTFS.  From other posts on this site, I gather that this is considered a 'Windows 7 Site' problem by Linux users.  However, I would dearly love to recover some of my lost Windows 7 files.\nI had resigned myself to a lot of lost personal data but I happened to notice that a 2TB drive I had connected through a USB docking station had been repartitioned.

It sounds like all you needed to do was to recover the Windows 7 MBR which could have been done with one command from the recovery console(command line) from the Windows 7 CD.\n\nA: Sounds like at some point you corrupted your Windows partition which forced you to do a low level format... which is basically deleting the file table and writing a bunch of zeros, or ones over the data, then formatting it to NTFS or whatever. If that truly is the case, the data is gone and you will not be able to recover it... \nAdvice for future experiments: ALWAYS BACK UP YOUR DATA WHEN YOU WILL BE PARTITIONING OR MESSING WITH PARTITIONS ON A HARD DRIVE, SECONDLY REMOVE ANY BACKUP DEVICES OR PORTABLE HARD DRIVES.\nGood luck.\n\nA: I disagree with the above answers.

In most cases\n   this security system works, but it can get confused.  To correct this\n   problem it is recommended that you disable this security feature.\n   Different Linux distributions have different files to control this;\n   please consult with your distributor for the correct method of\n   disabling this security feature.  As an example, if your system has\n   the file\n        /etc/security/console.perms\n   then you should edit the file and remove the line that starts with\n   \"\" (we have also received reports that additional references to\n    in console.perms must be removed, but this has not been verified\n   by NVIDIA).  If instead your system has the file\n        /etc/logindevperms\n   then you should edit the file and remove the line that lists\n   /dev/nvidiactl.  The above steps will prevent the PAM security system\n   from modifying the permissions on the NVIDIA device files.  Next,\n   you will need to reset the permissions on the device files back\n   to their original permissions and owner.  You can do that with the\n   following commands:\n        chmod 0666 /dev/nvidia* chown root /dev/nvidia*\n\n\nI understand that's not exactly your issue, but it might be worth looking in to a bit.  \n\nA: Downloading the Nvidia Drivers from Nvidia's website and reinstalling them seems to have fixed the problem.\nUPDATE:\nA few days later the graphics card failed completely.

So there is work to be done  on the router first. You basically have to turn it into a dumb AP. Once you do that, you can enable DHCP and routing on the ETH0 adapter so that those that connect to the AP can receive an IP and route out the ppp0 interface.

I heared that Rhythmbox will replace Banshee as the default music player in Precise. However, I was still surprised not to find the Ubuntu One Music Store plugin for Banshee in Precise. It has been available from Lucid, where Rhythmbox was also the default music player, so I would not have expected it to be discontinued as a result of that switch.\nSo will the U1 Music Store be available in the final version of Precise, or is it dropped completely?\n\nA: Because Banshee is still using GTK+ 2.x, and because Rhythmbox and Ubuntu, are pushing forward to GTK+ 3.x, we can no longer support both with the same code and build. Therefore, Banshee will not have the U1 Music Store in 12.04.\nThere is some work to move Banshee over to GTK+ 3.x upstream, but it is not landed in the master repository, and is blocking on some issues with a gtk-sharp 3.x release.

If the Live CD/DVD doesn't boot, it is not the hard drive that is failing. \nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Install of Ubuntu 10.4 LTS on Dell Laptop I got Ubuntu 10.4 LTS to install and run OK on an old Dell Inspiron, after overcoming an initial command line prompt and then foolishly upgraded to 12.x beta and that didn't see my home wireless network. So, I reinstalled back to 10.4 LTS, but now don't boot to GUI (as in first case) but get a \"grub>\" prompt in a command window. I have no idea of how to get the GUI to boot up. Help please. The initial installation booted to GUI OK, after an initial boot to command window. I overcame that with test install and then reinstall, though I got some out of disk space errors.\n\nA: When the grub command prompt is shown, the grub config seems to be incorrect. You now could either try to boot manually by using the grub shell or you could boot into a rescue system and repair the grub config.\nPlease view this page for more information:\nhttp://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4622?page=0,1\nThis sounds a little bit like a /dev/sda vs. /dev/hda problem..\n", "Q: How do I change screen contrast?

Old printer removed as not supported, replaced with HP Desktop 1000.  This has worked for several weeks.\nYesterday all attempts to print a document went to a queue, nothing prints out. Paper in place, power light on, front gate open, cables in place.\n\nA: I'm also having a similar problem with HP DeskJet 1xxx printer (don't remember the exact model). My understanding of the problem is that the printer requires a proprietary driver downloaded from HP website - which is supposed to happen automatically when the printer is detected, but the configuration script often fails - in particular, this is happening every time a new HPLIP version in installed by Update Manager.\nTo fix this, I run the configuration utility manually:\nsudo hp-setup\n\nThis will ask you some questions (turn the printer off, turn the printer on etc.) and download the driver.\nOn some ocassions I had problems with running it in graphical mode - there's a command-line switch to make it use text mode, something like sudo hp-setup -t\n\nA: It may be paused(disabled). If you go to your printing console, and right click on ENABLED if it's not checked.\nIf that does not work you may need to install the HPLIP driver, update and reinstall the printer. Which is reall easy, just unplug the usb cable, delete it in the printing console,  and plug it back in and let the computer discover it again.\n", "Q: Internal mic not working on Aspire One D255 I can't get my internal mic to work with any app other than Sound Recorder.

This is the repository for get the lastest NVIDIA propietary. Im not happy with the repos one because Im having problems with unity, sometimes it lags and freezes.

It only happens in Ubuntu versions like Ubuntu,Xubuntu,Kubuntu and so on. Tried on arch and my internet was fine the whole day. What should I provide?\n\nA: Wireless is influenced by many weird things, like the weather, your neighbor using his network, making a phonecall or using the microwave. You should exclude these factors and try different times without downloading on short distance. Maybe even change wireless channels.\nWhich drivers do you use for your wireless card on ubuntu? And on arch? \nAre you using a desktop pc or a laptop? In the latter make sure you test from exactly the same location.\n", "Q: How can I lock and unlock a screen during certain times of the day? I'm using a low power PC as a updating status screen, using firefox at fullscreen mode and a plugin called \"Reload Every\".\nM-F from 8 AM to 6 PM, I need the app set to no-screensaver and no-screenlock\nEvery other time I want the screen locked.\nThe purpose is basic security when no one else is around. I don't have to use gnome-screensaver to accomplish these goals. I just want to disable and enable the keyboard, mouse and screen without entering in a password, automatically.\nI was thinking of using cron and a shell script or python to swap a config file, but the gnome-screensaver man page is a bit lacking, and I have no idea what it uses for configuration.\n\nA: For those who want to use a GUI, this can quite easily be done with Cuttlefish, a \"reaction based tool\" that changes Ubuntu settings/appearance based on the environment (time of day, plugged in/out, connected to the internet, etc).\nTwo things need to be done. First, choose the environment when the action should take place. In this case the date & time.\n\nThen choose which settings should change. In this case unlocking the screen and turning off the screensaver.\n\nCuttlefish is probably not the most resource-efficient option for this particular task but it's the easiest way I know of.\n\nA: user886694's solution above is not complete. You need to include 'export DISPLAY=:0.0' before your unlock and lock commands like this:\nTo lock the screen add this to crontab...\nexport DISPLAY=:0.0 && gnome-screensaver-command -l\n\nAnd to unlock...\nexport DISPLAY=:0.0 && gnome-screensaver-command -d\n\nThe best GUI tool I've found for adding crons through an interface is gnome-schedule which can be installed using:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-schedule\n\nOnce installed, the program will be called \"Scheduled Tasks\" in your 'Dash Home'. To use it, simply add a new task and enter a brief description, the command and time you want the lock or unlock to run.\n", "Q: Back up from windows to ubuntu I've recently installed Ubuntu along side of win7 on a netbook. I want to back up all my information from Windows, so I can switch to Ubuntu only.\nAny advice?\n\nA: You may want to look into this answer if your Windows partition doesn't automatically mount itself in Ubuntu. \nHow to mount NTFS drive at startup\nOnce it is mounted, drag and drop your files to Ubuntu and then erase Windows. Very simple.\n\nA: Well, it's basically as easy as clicking on the windows file system on your file manager(it should automatically mount itself), locating your files, and draggin them over to your corresponding directories in linux.\n\nA: Did you back-up your Windows data anywhere before installing Ubuntu (on a flash drive or on another machine, maybe)?  If so, you can just copy it from there to your Ubuntu partition.  Otherwise, your Windows partition should be visible from within your file manager.\nAnd by the way, it's a good idea to back-up your data anytime you're messing with your disk partitions or installing another OS (or both).\n\nA: Well although it isn't an usual backup method, if you have a fairly recent computer that supports hardware virtualization,you might want to consider making what is called a P2V copy of your windows installation.\nWhat this does is create a virtualized copy of your entire physical windows installation that you can then replay for inside a VM player/manager software.\nAnd yes both the P2V converter and the VM player software are free,although not opensource.\nSo first thing you need to do is go into windows and install the converter from this address http://www.vmware.com/products/converter/\n(Click on download and log into your account or create one just for that)\n When you're done downloading and installing run the standalone converter and choose powered-on Machine and this local machine as the source,then click next.\nAt the next screen select vmware workstation as the machine type and select also vmware workstation 8.x as the product.. Then give it the location of an external hard drive to which send the copy to when doing the conversion.\nThen click next twice and go do something else for a while.. It can take a few hours to copy all your data to an external hard drive.\nWhen this step is done you can shutdown and reboot into ubuntu.\nIn ubuntu you now have to install the vmware player from this page http://www.vmware.com/products/player/overview.html\nYes virtualbox is great but i don't know if a vmware machine can be used from it.\nThere are ways most probably,but it is beyond the scope of my answer.\nNow you can run the vmware player and open the VM you have on your external drive.\nYou can then proceed to copy files from your VM to your ubuntu desktop and see how to delete your old windows partition.\n", "Q: Will VirtualBox recognise a USB device if Ubuntu doesn't recognise I am running Windows XP as a virtual machine through VirtualBox on Ubuntu 11.10. I have some USB devices (namely a video grabber & Android phone) that aren't recognised by Ubuntu. Will they be recognised by Windows XP if it is running virtually?\n\nA: Yes, but.. You have to add your user account to the VBOXUSERS group.\nHere is a quick rundown. \nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/howto/31726/mount-usb-devices-in-virtualbox-with-ubuntu/\nOnce you do that (and reboot) your USB devices should appear when you click on the USB icon on the bottom status bar of your virtualbox window.\n\nA: Probably, yes. The USB-passthrough gives native-like access to USB devices to VMs.\nIn the past I've used VirtualBox to update the firmware on my old phone, the firmware on my mouse (it's a very shiny mouse) and update our Logitech Harmony remote. All things that aren't really possible through Ubuntu directly.\nWhat I should point out is that the performance is not great all the time. It isn't a real passthrough (that's practically impossible as the hubs are all managed by Ubuntu) so there's a software layer in there that does slow things up. Pointedly for you, a video grabber may not work very well.\n\nNote: I thought this didn't need saying but, just reading Frank's answer, it probably does... All this does require you to set up USB support correctly!\n\nA: My experience with VMWare on Windows is that VMWare installs a USB driver that essentially passes the USB device's communications directly through to the VM. So if I plugged in a USB wireless card, the Wireless card would disappear from the host's device list and be replaced with a \"VMWare USB Device\" and then it would appear in the guest's device manager.\nYMMV with different VM software.\n", "Q: ubuntu one login problem from android My ubuntu one account get login correctly by firefox and nautilus.\nMy account has a 16 char password, with alphanumeric AND special chars.\nIt happens that downloading the ubuntu app in my   MTK6573 HD7 aHD7300 Android phone, I cannot login with the usual password.\nIs there a problem in the Android app, not allowing special chars ?\n\nA: Found a similar case in Askubuntu.\nThe problem seems solved removing ubuntuone app application data in the phone and restarting the app.\nfollow the link to:\nCan't log into Ubuntu One for Android\nThis solution solved my case.\n", "Q: Skype on 11.10 x64 Why Skype crashes on 11.10 x64 architecture?

I'm trying to get grub2 to boot by xen image off of a USB thumb drive.\nHowever, it's not working for some reason.  \nMy original grub entry was the following, and this works off of an LVM partitions HDD:\nmenuentry 'Xen 4 (Linux 2.6.32.50-xen)' --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os --class xen {\n        recordfail\n        insmod ext2\n        set root='(hd0,1)'\n        search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set 6542fe50-82e2-467a-b832-7cf92f71bc98\n        multiboot /xen.gz placeholder noreboot\n        module  /vmlinuz-2.6.32.50-xen placeholder root=/dev/mapper/xenserver-root ro\n        module  /initrd.img-2.6.32.50-xen\n}\n\nBut, not off the thumb drive which is partitioned as ext2 with no LVM.\nCurrently it looks like this:\nmenuentry 'Xen 4 (Linux 2.6.32.50-xen)' --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os --class xen {\n        recordfail\n        insmod ext2\n        set root='(hd0,1)'\n        search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set 55425e50-82e2-4c74-b860-7cf92f91b423\n        multiboot /xen.gz placeholder noreboot\n        module  /vmlinuz-2.6.32.50-xen placeholder root=/dev/sda1 ro\n        module  /initrd.img-2.6.32.50-xen\n}\n\nThe way I understand this is that set root='(hd0,1)' sets the root environment variable to be the first hard disk, first partition. \nNow, what does the search line do?\nAccording to the grub2 documentation for the search command and if I'm understanding it correctly, if a disk with that uuid is found it will set root to that uuid... or is that the first partition on that disk??  so if it doesn't find it does that mean it defaults to (hd0,1)?  \nThis is currently not working for me it says I need to load a multiboot kernel first.  So it's obviusly not finding xen.gz.  Could it be that I need to remove the --no-floppy?  I know some BIOS' treat USB thumb drives as floppy disks.  Although on my system it's coming up as /dev/hda.  If it insert a hard disk it's /dev/hdb.  Is this still going to work?  What should I set the root= line to given that LVM is not installed and /dev/mapper/xenserver-root doesn't exist.  I've seen some people set this to /dev/hdb1 but I'd like it to figure this out automatically or be generated by update-grub.\nHow would I get this working?  I've tried lots of options, but obviously not the right one.\n\nA: After a lot of experimenting, I did actually get it to work.  And in the process I have found out what search does and learned a lot about grub and the grub command line in the process.  It's not as difficult as it seems.\nThe problem with my entries is that i needed to prefix /boot/ to the filename for both multiboot & module entries.\nI also found out that search does what I think it does.  It looks for the file or filesystem uuid (depending on option) and sets root to be the disk location & partition number.\nSo the initial set root='(hd0,1)' line is a bit redundant.  It seems as though it'll default to that if the search fails.\n", "Q: Unhandled Lockdown error (-4) ipod 4G Running Ubuntu 10.10 getting this error as soon as I connect my iPod 4G running IOS 5.0.1.\nWhen I open Nautilus, I can see the iPod icon, but same error appears when I try and open the ipod.\n\nA: This is a bug that has already been solved.

Is it possible to start a program normally, and then later give it root or some other level of permission without restarting it?\n\nA: No.  In general, a program can only reduce its privileges (although there are ways for root owned programs to temporarily drop privileges and regain them).\nThe current best practice for such programs is to separate the privileged and non-privileged portions into separate processes, and have the non-privileged process invoke the privileged one as needed (e.g. this is how the clock indicator's preferences panel lets you change the system time, or how the terminal updates the list of logged in users).\nThis needs to be part of the program's design though: if a program is not designed to act this way, then you'll need to run it under sudo or similar if it needs administrator privileges.\n\nA: Yes.  The software has to request it specifically though.

How do I best extend the size of the partition?\n\nA: Boot from live media so no partitions are mounted.  The ability to live extend partitions is the big bonus of using LVM.  \nIf you use something like resize2fs you should be able to do it without live media.  \nAs long as your tool is doing an appropriate resize you should keep all your files.  This is why I prefer CLI for important operations over gui tools.  You never know exactly what they're doing.\n\nA: Boot a live CD, Ubuntu or the gparted live CD will do.\nStart gpared.\nYou have to do this in two steps.\nFirst expand (enlarge) your extended partition (sda1) -> apply changes\nSecond expand your home partition (sda6) -> apply changes. \nWhen resizing partitions there is always a small risk that something may go wrong, you should have backups.\n\nA: Download the ISO here:http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/download.html and create a UBCD or you can also create this on a bootable USB stick. Boot your PC from the CD or USB and run Partition Magic.  \n", "Q: How to share wireless Internet with Ubuntu? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to share a wired internet connection via Wifi? \n\nI have a PC which connects to the Internet via wifi. However, my ISP only allows one PC to connect to the Internet at the same time.\nAlso, I have a wireless router, so I want to connect this router to my laptop and share my Internet connection via this router.\nIs there any way I can do that?\n\nA: It is very easy. You connect to the wireless network as normal. Then select the wired network connection, and in the IPv4 settings, select \"Method: Shared with other computers\". \nNow your wireless connection will be shared on the wired one. Connect your router, and it will share it with other computers in your network. \n", "Q: Backup keeps asking for Encryption Password while restoring I'm attempting to restore from a previous backup but the restore keeps asking me for an Encrypted Password. I enter what I want it to be but it shows up some thirty seconds later to ask again. Why is this?\n\nA: Sounds like a bug?  File one at https://launchpad.net/deja-dup/+filebug, provide the logs it asks for, and I might be able to help.\nOne thing though is that you mention entering what you want the password to be?  When restoring, you should be entering the same password you used when originally backing up.\n\nA: I had the exact same symptoms. My solution was to dig through my records to find an old password I'd used on a previous backup (with Ubuntu One, not deja-dup directly), install ubuntu one on the destination (restore) machine, and then enter that old password during the restoration of that recent backup file. Filed a bug report https://bugs.launchpad.net/deja-dup/+bug/1035924 as suggested by @MichaelTerry\n\nA: I'm in a big - holy $#^^@# i just lost a ton of files mess. I'm currently restoring some from ubuntu one and got this Encryption Password prompt. It really had me worried and I tried some of my old passwords and they didn't work. I just reset my ubuntu one password, i know that password was not in use when I created these backups. My brand new, just reset, password worked here - so it may not be some old password you set your backups with, try your current ubuntu one password.\n(i'm sure you're over this issue, but google led me to this thread, so i hope it helps the next person)\n", "Q: How do I type in IPA? I am using Ubuntu 11.10 as my only OS. I have to enter some text in IPA, but it is turning out to be a headache. I tried using  Autohotkey but it failed to yield the desired results. Please let me know if there are any software with which I can type in IPA, or a way to configure the keyboard to do so.\n\nA: You can get access to the SIL repository following these instructions, then get the latest versions of kmfl-ibus and the IPA Keyboard package from the Ubuntu Software Center (searching for \"kmfl\" it should be one of the top results). Don't forget to log out and in.\nFor future reference, this page shows IPA keyboards for Windows, Linux, and Mac.\nFrom the keyboard logo in your upper toolbar, which is hopefully there now, choose preferences, input method, select an input method, other, and IPA Unicode KMN, then click Add. You can choose how you switch from and to IPA from the \"general\" tab.\nGood luck!\nGood luck!\n\nA: You can also use a virtual keyboard such as Onboard. It shows a small clickable keyboard on your screen. I wrote an IPA layout for Onboard which is still in beta but already functional:\n\nDisclaimer : I am the author of the IPA layout.\n\nA: Try this Debian package from this site. You might need to get ibus-kmfl installed first. This page has a repository. \n\nA: There is an input method based on X-SAMPA, which is available for the IMEs IBus and Fcitx (as well as UIM and RIME).\nAn IME (input method editor) is commonly used for inputing ordinary language scripts with large numbers of characters (like Chinese and Japanese), and is a natural solution for IPA as well. X-SAMPA is an ASCII based encoding of IPA and hence easily typed on an ordinary QWERTY keyboard. The IME will convert the ASCII character sequences to the appropriate Unicode character as you type.\nYou can get it in Ubuntu 16.04 by installing the package \"ibus-table-ipa-x-sampa\" (if you use IBus) or \"fcitx-table-ipa-x-sampa\" (if you use Fcitx). You will have to set up one of the IMEs if you aren't using one already, and will probably have to add \"IPA-X-SAMPA\" to your input method list (which should include your default keyboard as well as input methods or keyboards for any other languages you use).\nI've tried the Fcitx version, and it seems to work as intended.\nThis could be a good alternative to to the \"IPA Unicode KMN\" keyboard described in xanxerus's answer, which works with IBus and SCIM, but not Fcitx. This is particularly relevant to Kubuntu, since recent versions (like 16.04) use Fcitx by default. Additionally, it requires no additional repositories to be added.\n", "Q: Error 12 - creating hibernation image - not enough free memory Ubuntu 11.10\nThinkpad T61p with 120 GB free disk space and 2 GB memory.\nI got this error message while trying to activate hibernation mode.\nNot enough free memory\nError 12 - creating hibernation image\nIs this a bug or what may I do to have hibernation and sleep mode working properly?  \nEdit:\n\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          1996       1450        545          0        139        359\n -/+ buffers/cache:       951       1044\nSwap:         2027          0       2027\n\nA: Did you install without a swap partition?

No subject no body no person name, nothing just a size i have that only 0.1k. And sometime when i try to drag and drop mails from IMAP to local, this happen without any notification. i move these mails from IMAP to local folder that means i never find these mail in IMAP account. So i just lost my mail.\nMy Question is that why this happened, i dont want this will happen with again and how can i recover those blank mail in thunderbird.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I do lot of googled and found something, but its not my answer that was i looking for it.\nSome of expert say that happened following things.\n\n\n*\n\n*Bad network connectivity during download mails. \n\n*Something messed up in .msf file (thunderbird folder file)\n\n*Something happened bad in applied filtered. \n\n*Bad compacting of local folder. \n\n\nSo i try all these things, i close my TB (ThunderBird), then remove .msf file and reopen TB.

Ubuntu Software Center is very slow here.Seriously, Windows virtual machines run faster that that here!\nI dislike Software Center so I installed Synaptic ages ago, and that loads in 2 seconds! Perfect. Well almost - I can't seem to open downloaded .debs with it. Can I change things so that Synaptic opens .debs by default? \nIs it possible to remove Software Center completely and replace it with Synaptic?\n\nA: You open downloaded debs with gdebi\nIt is not installed by default, so use this command to do so\nsudo apt-get install gdebi\nTo make it default for deb handling, follow these steps\nRight click on any .deb file and click properties\n\nGo to the Open With Tab\n\nSelect Gdebi Package Installer and click Set as default\n\nAs for software center, you can safely remove it by the following command:\nsudo apt-get remove software-center\n\nand you can use synaptic for the GUI installation of packages from the repos\n\nA: As for your first question - for installing a .deb file I personally prefer the command line by executing sudo dpkg -i file.deb. It's much faster than both Software Center and Synaptic and you can install multiple packages at once (e.g.  sudo dpkg -i *.deb).\nYou can remove Software Center but why would you? Leave it there and don't use it. Sometimes I find it very useful for searching for an application I need and see its ratings.\n\nA: If you want to install packages by synaptic that already downloaded, You can use this method, You can copy the downloaded packages to the /var/cache/apt/archive directory. Then open synaptic and search for your package and install it. However you can't copy anything to that directory unless you are the owner of the directory (You may be the administrator but not the root) then you have to make permissions (I usually log into the root account and copy those packages) you can copy packages through the terminal.

If I am not able to install via the package manager, I'd prefer not to install at all, and instead run as a standalone application. Looking at the soapUI download page I can't figure out which download (if any) fulfills this criterion?\n\n\n*\n\n*soapui-4.5.0-Beta1-linux-bin.zip\n\n*soapUI-x32-4_5_0-Beta1.sh\n\n\nI'm guessing \"bin\" but I don't know for sure. Any clues?\n\nA: Supposing that you don't have a GUI in your installation you can try from the command line simply using wget to download Linux tarball:\n$ wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.eviware/soapuios/5.4.0/SoapUI-5.4.0-linux-bin.tar.gz\n\nThen ungzip and untar the download archive:\n$ gunzip SoapUI-5.4.0-linux-bin.tar.gz\n$ tar xvf SoapUI-5.4.0-linux-bin.tar\n\nNow instead of start the UI of SOAPUI using SOAPUI_HOME/bin/soapui.sh you can use SOAPUI/bin/testrunner.sh to run your projects without the UI.\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no repository to be added to the sources, so SOAPUI cannot be installed through apt-get or Ubuntu package management. Some description is on https://www.soapui.org/getting-started/installing-soapui/installing-on-linux-or-unix.html . Resolution given by Trent is only option, but in reality, currently, you should download just .sh file (Linux installer) from https://www.soapui.org/downloads/latest-release.html which has approx. 130+MB and try following commands for 64bit:\n$ sudo chmod +x SoapUI-x64-5.4.0.sh\n$ ./SoapUI-x64-5.4.0.sh\n\nor 32 bit:\n$ sudo chmod +x SoapUI-x32-5.4.0.sh\n$ ./SoapUI-x32-5.4.0.sh\n\n(* scripts updated to version 5.4.0\nReplace the name of the file according to the downloaded version of the SOAP UI.\nEnjoy your testing!\n\nA: On a 64 bit operating system, use the zip file installer.

The correct answer here will be either \"Internet site\" if you want the machine to deliver mail directly, or \"Satellite system\" if you want it to relay all mail through a single smarthost instead.\nBeyond that, you'll have to be more specific about what you want - should the machine listen for INCOMING smtp traffic, or will it only be relaying mail out from localhost?  Should it accept unauthenticated SMTP, and if so, from whom?  Should it accept authenticated SMTP traffic - only, or from all but a certain trusted range?\nAll these things are possible, but we need to know more about what you want to do.\n\nA: Please consult the postfix documentation for details: man 5 postconf\nFor the sending of mails via smtp it is necessary that you configure at least:\n\n*\n\n*mynetworks\n\nThe list of \"trusted\" remote SMTP clients that have more privileges than \"strangers\".\n  \n  Note: For the local delivery of virtual domains you have some more things to do.\n\n", "Q: Is there a graphical (GUI) front end for hdparm?

You can temporarily get a fixed Do from the daily builds PPA.\n\nA: According to TechRepublic:\n\nUnder standard GNOME, the key combination to call forth GNOME Do is\n  Super-Space, but the Super key is reserved for two very important\n  functions in Unity. If Super is tapped once, it will call up the\n  search dialog, and if it is pressed and held, the launcher icons will\n  display numbers (see Figure A). The user can then press the number\n  associated with the launcher to launch the application.\nSo, after you launch GNOME Do, instead of using it to search for an\n  application or file, the very first thing that must be done is to\n  re-configure it to use a different hot key combination so that it\n  doesn’t use the Super key.\n\nAre you using Unity? This may be the fundamental cause. Super shouldn't work with it.\n\nA: Ctrl + Alt + Space works in Gnome 3 (on Ubu 12.04).  The key binding for Super-Space does not.

Originally developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991, the UNIX-like Linux operating system now benefits from the contributions of millions of users and developers around the world. Slackware Linux provides new and experienced users alike with a fully-featured system, equipped to serve in any capacity from desktop workstation to machine-room server.

After some researching I found that BT is a part of the dreaded Broadcom hybrid BCM4313 hardware that supposedly supplies both. Here's what I've tried so far:\nIn all tests the hardware key (f12) has been enabled and the top toolbar shows a bluetooth icon as well as wireless icon (single key press toggles both BT and wifi on/off).\nI am currently using linux-3.0.0-13-lowlatency kernel but this should have any bearing on the problem as I also tried downloading latest Broadcom driver (hybrid-portsrc_x86_64-v5_100_82_112.tar.gz) from the Broadcom site and successfully built it according to their instructions.\nI tried both the brcmsmac driver and the wl driver. Wl driver solves the poor range problem as well as f12 LED light color change (which does not occur when using the brcmsmac driver) to reflect the enabled state. Other than that they both have exact same behavior in respect to this problem.\nIn all tests at first rfkill list did not show any bluetooth devices, until I manually modprobed btusb. Now it lists the following devices:\n1: hp-wifi: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n2: hp-bluetooth: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n6: brcmwl-0: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n\nEnabling/disabling devices is properly reflected in the aforesaid list (Hard blocked value changes to yes/no).\nhcitool dev shows no available devices.\nhcitool -i hp-bluetooth yields:\nInvalid device: No such device\n\nCuriously, lsusb shows no bluetooth devices:\nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 004 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 006 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 064e:d217 Suyin Corp. \nBus 006 Device 002: ID 0a5c:21e3 Broadcom Corp. \nBus 002 Device 002: ID 152d:2339 JMicron Technology Corp. / JMicron USA Technology Corp.\n\nTop toolbar shows bluetooth being enabled. Right-clicking on it and selecting properties (that opens BT system settings) shows Bluetooth being disabled and trying to enable it simply reverts back to disabled within a second or two.\nThe only lead I found so far is that some were able to enable BT in Windows (on dual-booting computers) and then rebooted into Linux at which point BT worked ok. I however do not have a dual-boot on this machine. Besides, having to boot into Windows every time before Linux just to \"fix\" bluetooth seems hardly like a fix. I did find another thread with a user in identical situation (no dual boot) and no solution to the said problem. Based on this, however, it seems to me there might be some kind of a firmware missing?\nAlso, has anyone tried ndiswrapper for this setup in hope that might fix the BT issue?

These are the\ndifferent units:\n\n*\n\n*Hardware block size, \"sector size\"\n\n*Filesystem block size, \"block size\"\n\n*Kernel buffer cache block size, \"block size\"\n\n*Partition table block size, \"cylinder size\"\n\nTo differentiate between the filesystem block size and the buffer cache block size, I\nwill follow FAT terminology and use \"cluster size\" for the filesystem block size.\nThe sector size is the units that the hardware deals with. This ranges between different\nhardware types, but most PC-style hardware (floppies, IDE disks, etc.) use 512 byte\nsectors.\nThe cluster size is the allocation unit that the filesystem uses, and is what causes\nfragmentation - I'm sure you know about that. On a moderately sized ext3 filesystem,\nthis is usually 4096 bytes, but you can check that with dumpe2fs. Remember that these\nare also usually called \"blocks\", only that I refer to them as clusters here.\nThe cluster size is what gets returned in st_blksize in the stat buffer, in order for\nprograms to be able to calculate the actual disk usage of a file.\nThe block size is the size of the buffers that the kernel uses internally when it caches\nsectors that have been read from storage devices (hence the name \"block device\"). Since\nthis is the most primitive form of storage in the kernel, all filesystem cluster sizes\nmust be multiples of this. This block size is also what is almost always referred to by\nuserspace programs. For example, when you run \"du\" without the -h or -H options, it will\nreturn how many of these blocks a file takes up. df will also report sizes in these\nblocks, the \"Blocks\" column in the fdisk -l output is of this type, and so on. It is\nwhat is most commonly referred to as a \"block\". Two disk sectors fit into each block.\nThe cylinder size is only used in the partition table and by the BIOS (and the BIOS\nisn't used by Linux).\n\"df\" only operates on filesystems, so, no, it can't be used without a filesystem -\nwithout a filesystem, the data that it would return doesn't exist. \"du\" operates on\nindividual files.\n\nfrom here.\n\nA: stat command executed with a mount point as a parameter, shows filesystem's cluster size under IO Block property\nstat /dev/shm/minifs-mounted\n\nwill show\n  File: /dev/shm/minifs-mounted\n  Size: 1024            Blocks: 2          IO Block: 1024   directory\nDevice: 709h/1801d      Inode: 2           Links: 3\nAccess: (0755/drwxr-xr-x)  Uid: (    0/    root)   Gid: (    0/    root)\nAccess: 2022-12-27 14:03:15.000000000 -0300\nModify: 2022-12-27 14:01:50.000000000 -0300\nChange: 2022-12-27 14:01:50.000000000 -0300\n Birth: -\n\nabove info belongs to a filesystem created with\ncd /dev/shm\ndd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=100 of=minifs.img\nmkfs.ext4 -b 1024 ./minifs.img\nmount -o loop minifs.img minifs-mounted\n\nforcing 1024 bytes long cluster\n", "Q: su: Authentication failure (Ignored) Keeping in mind this was working before:\nWhen I try to login as :\nsu jira1\n\nI get error:\nsu: Authentication failure\n(Ignored)\n\nmore /etc/passwd returns:\njira1:x:1003:1003:,,,:/home/jira1:/bin/bash\n\nand if I monitor su jira1, by tailing /var/log/auth.log, I get:\nMar 15 10:43:51 jira su[4590]: Successful su for jira1 by root\nMar 15 10:43:51 jira su[4590]: + /dev/pts/1 root:jira1\nMar 15 10:43:51 jira su[4590]: pam_unix(su:session): session opened for user jira1 by kahmed(uid=0)\n\n\nA: This will happen when the user's entry is missing from /etc/shadow (which is normally updated automatically, unless you have been editing /etc/passwd directly).\nThe pwconv utility will fix any inconsistencies.

I have a computer with windows 7 installed. I'm sharing it with other people that don't accept a boot screen where you choose between windows and Ubuntu, but I want to be able to run Ubuntu from an internal drive. \nIs there a way for me to install Ubuntu on a HDD partition without tampering with the existing boot procedure at all, and having a bootable USB thumb-drive that lets me boot up Ubuntu?\nPlease take into consideration that it's not an option to first install Ubuntu and then restoring the MBR from some sort of backup, since the other users of the computer in question are quite paranoid.\n\nA: You could install Ubuntu without overwriting the MBR, and then boot it using SuperGrub2 USB. That said, taking in consideration the other users, that route might prove an Indiana Jones kind of adventure for you. Dealing with partitions and installing OSs is never bulletproof, things can go wrong in many ways.\nI'd recommend a VirtualBox route instead, you don't have to modify partitions, deal with bootloaders or burn CDs/USBs. If something goes wrong, just delete the VM.\n\nA: Great explanation of grub2 options on ubuntu forums here.  \nThe options you're interested in contain the words HIDDEN, WAIT, and DEFAULT.\nYou want to install grub, but change some settings:  \n\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\n#Change the previous 0 to the ID of the windows install\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=1\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\n#GRUB_TIMEOUT=10\n\nTo make windows the default and make sure they don't notice grub unless they're leaning on the shift key.  \n", "Q: About partition sizes I am going to install Ubuntu on a new computer, but I'm not quite sure how big each partition should be.\nIf I create only root, home and swap partitions, on what partition will programs be installed?\nWill they go to /home or to root?\nBasically does it make sense for instance to have following partitions:\n    /     - 6GB\n    /home - 80GB\n    /swap - 4GB\n\nIs 6GB large enough for my root partition?\nAlso are these 3 partitions a good choice, or is there a better configuration?\nI have at the moment 3 operating systems installed, and I do make changes quite often.\n\nA: Unless you have special needs, I'd recommend you to use just two partitions: one for the root filesystem and one for the swap.\nIf your aim is to share your /home with the other three operating systems you have installed, then you need to be warned: different versions of the same application may mess up your configuration. You can work around this problem, of course, but having a separate /home for each operating system is without doubts the faster and safest solution.\n\nA: Installed software will typically go on root.  You can put some stuff in home for local to a user install, but most ubuntu packages conform to the standard.  I wouldn't make a 6GB root partition, but that's me.  according to this a pretty standard home install is:\n\nThe standard partitions scheme for most home Linux installs is as follows:\n\n    A 12-20 GB partition for the OS, which gets mounted as / (called “root”)\n    A smaller partition used to augment your RAM, mounted and referred to as swap\n    A larger partition for personal use, mounted as /home\n\nBest practice on swap is double size of ram, although that's getting less and less common.\nCredit to Jo-Erlend: You definitely want to do the double ram guideline if you plan on using hibernation options.\n\nA: How big is your disk?  \nI would make root ('/') at least 8 GB, maybe 10 (which is what I typically use as a minimum partition size for the root partition).\nYou probably don't need 4GB of swap, unless you are doing things that are really going to be hammering swap.  There used to be an old rule of thumb with Linux that swap should be twice the size of RAM, but that was back when your average PC only had 256MB or 512MB.\nMost people will be fine with only 1GB maybe 2GB of swap.\nAs for your other question, programs you install will almost all be installed in the root partition.  There may be a couple exceptions out there that install into /home/$USER, but that's doubtful, really.\nThat's why I usually make / at least 10GB.  And if you have disk space to space, maybe even 20GB to be safe.\n\nA: Well, having separate /home for each OS is definitely safer, but it is also a lot less convenient.  It is going to be hard to transfer data from one OS to another.\nI share my /home between Windows 7 and ubuntu.  It gave me some trouble at the beginning because the computer woke up to the wrong OS after hibernate.  After fixing grub, that never happened again.  I actually share firefox profile between the two OSes.  Very neat.\n\nA: IMHO, it would be better to have a 'Data' partition (NTFS formatted) that can be accessed by windows and linux, both. This is given that you want to have multiple OSs (I am assuming that you want to be able to access, say, your media files from all the OSs).\nA separate home partition should be a good idea if you need to reinstall linux!\n\nA: When you install applications, their application files go in root. That means libraries, the program executable and global data, such as documentation, images, etc. User data, such as configuration and file data, goes into your home. \nI would recommend a slightly larger root partition. \nIt isn't necessary to add a separate /home partition. If you choose to use BtrFS instead of Ext4, then it's not even recommendable. It's better to have a single root partition, since BtrFS can have subvolumes. This means you'll get both two separate filesystems, but do not have to have predetermined size limits for each. If you use BtrFS, then Ubuntu will automatically create a root and a home subvolume for you, so you don't have to worry about that at all. \nBtrFS is fantastic stuff. For instance, it let's you jump back in time if something goes wrong. So, for instance, you can upgrade to the next version of Ubuntu, and if it doesn't work, you can undo the upgrade in a moment. \nBe advised, that as BtrFS is very new, there is less documentation for it. But from an install perspective, it's easier. There's no doubt this is the future of Ubuntu. \n\nA: How you set up your partitions depend on a lot of different things.

I am not clear on this. Does Zeitgeist index the contents of my document so searches are more relevant? Or is Zeitgeist only searching the name/extension of my documents?\n\nA: In a nutshell Zeitgeist is an event log. It does not deal with files. It deals with events. It does NOT store the contents of the file. That is not the work of zeitgeist\nWhat Zeitgeist does\nExamples of events are\n\n\n*\n\n*File opened/closed/deleted/saved\n\n*New voice call received/dialed\n\n*Committing a git/bzr repo\n\n*Opening a firefox page\n\n*Downloading a file\n\n*Starting an IM Chat\n\n*Music Play, Pause, Stop\n\n\nJust imagine any event and zeitgeist can log it.\nNow just because zeitgeist can log something does not mean it will log it. It is a daemon which exposes a D-Bus API. This API provides methods, to log, retrieve, filter or delete events.\nZeitgeist Datahub\nNow you need external applications to log events to zeitgeist. A second daemon named zeitgeist-datahub keeps running on your system which monitors\n\n\n*\n\n*All file activity logged to GtkRecentManager and pushes it to zeitgeist daemon\n\n*All application launches and logs it\n\n*All files downloaded in Downloads directory\n\n\nFor applications which doesn't use GtkRecentManager, there are extensions/plugins/addins/addons provided which push the relevant events to Zeitgeist. These components are called dataproviders because they supply zeitgeist daemon with data.\nUsage of logged events\nNow you have applications which can use this data for their usage. There are a few good things which can be done with the data. e.g.\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the most recent files opened (because every event stored contains a timestamp)\n\n*Find all the recent files opened by a specific application (because every event stored also contains the name of the application which trigered the event). This can be used to populate the recently used files for every application File Menu\n\n*Application launchers like Synapse, Do and Unity Dash can use this to sort the list of applications when the user types the name\n\n*The application can populate the most often used files. e.g. gedit-dashboard uses zeitgeist to populate this list. You need to install package gedit-plugins to enable this gedit plugin. Click on New file to use it\n\n\nFull Text Search\nZeitgeist comes with a Full Text Search API too, which only searches the contents of the event and not the file itself. If you played a track of Beethovan, then the event logged would contain\n\n\n*\n\n*TimeStamp\n\n*Did the user explicitly click on Run or was the event scheduled (Playlist)\n\n*What was the event about - Track started\n\n*Which application did this\n\n*How is the resource (media file) stored as. In this case as a File\n\n*A freeform string as the Title which can contain the track name, genre, artist, year etc.\n\n*The mimetype of the media file\n\n\nThen the Full Text Search API provided with zeitgeist only looks at the fields of the event for search and does not look into the file. \nRemember Zeitgeist is not a file search of a file tracker\n", "Q: How can I retain my pidgin installation when upgrading to the newer versions of ubuntu? Every time I have upgraded to the newest version of Ubuntu, it removes pidgin during the upgrade and gives me empathy, I don't want empathy, hence why I downloaded pidgin.

You may have...\n\n\n*\n\n*...installed it from the official software sources in Ubuntu. If you found pidgin  in the Software Center or ran sudo apt-get install pidgin, that is the case.\nThis is also the case if Pidgin was already installed when you installed Ubuntu (which is the case for some versions of Ubuntu and some Ubuntu derivatives).\nIf this is the case, just install the pidgin package again.\n\n*...installed the version of Pidgin provided by the PPA that the upstream developers officially recommend.\nIf that's how you installed Pidgin, it makes sense that it was uninstalled when you upgraded, as third-party software sources (like PPA's) are disabled when you upgrade from one Ubuntu release to another, and sometimes the software they provide is uninstalled to make way for official software. (Official software can be uninstalled too, so that you've had this problem does not mean you installed Pidgin from the PPA.)\nOne good way to install Pidgin back from the PPA is to enable the PPA and install the package from there (this avoids having to download the right .deb package first):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:pidgin-developers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install pidgin \n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 10.04 - Do I need to install Audio Drivers for ASROCK E350M1?

This is what I'm seeing. Any help?\n\nA: This means you don't have the necessary permissions to write to the files on the Windows drive. Ubuntu has a wiki on file permissions. However, there is a great program called pysdm that makes changing the file permissions for drives quick and easy. It is avalible through the Ubuntu repositories, and therefore can be installed through sudo apt-get installed pysdm. A screenshot:\n\nMore information can be found on the project's homepage here. Hope that helps!\n", "Q: How to remove all i386 packages from Ubuntu 64bit? Over the time I installed many i386 packages, which I no longer need. How can I clean up the system and stay only with the amd64 packages?\n\nA: There is another way of lower risk:\nsudo apt-get remove \"^.*:i386$\"\n\nThis will specifically match only packages ending with \":i386\", which is the standard naming convention for all i386 architecture Debian packages.\n\nA: The other automated solutions are dangerous and not always working (1), so here another way\nsudo aptitude purge `dpkg --get-selections | grep \":i386\" | awk '{print $1}'`\n\nor\nsudo apt-get purge `dpkg --get-selections | grep \":i386\" | awk '{print $1}'`\n\n(Try to use always and only one of the tools. Since aptitude is better when having dependency trouble, I prefer that.)\nGood idea to also\ndpkg --remove-architecture i386\n\nand maybe\ndpkg --print-foreign-architectures\n\n(1) The other commands also lists packages having only i386 in their name (although they are for 64bit architecture), the regular expression didn't work and dpkg shows packages which are already removed, but still have configuration files left (dpkg -l  shows \"rc\" instead of \"ii\" as status).\n\nA: I blitzed all my 32bit packages like this:\nsudo apt-get remove `dpkg --get-selections | grep i386 | awk '{print $1}'`\n\n\nA: If they are not in your way, I would leave them where they are.\nIf you insist on deletion, use dpkg -l | grep i386 to create a list of i386-packages. You can delete these after careful checking with something like sudo apt-get purge <package-name>.\n\nA: The debian's multiarch guide mentions this command: apt-get purge \".*:<arch>\", which would look like this for i386:\nsudo apt-get purge \".*:i386\"\n\nYou can then remove the architecture from dpkg:\nsudo dpkg --remove-architecture i386\n\n\nA: In case anyone is wondering, there's a much more sane and graceful way to do this. The last previous answer hopes to do the same thing, but that search fails since architectures are not actually part of package names, except in special cases.\nas root (or with sudo) run:\naptitude remove ~i~ri386\n\nIf you don't use aptitude over apt-get already, do. It's really excellent. You can find a list of aptitude's search terms here.\n", "Q: Can't search for terminal in Unity dash I used to be able to search for terminal in 'Dash Home' and brings up terminal. However, this way doesn't work any more. 'Dash Home' does not even let me search for 'terminal'.\nOne thing, I have my home directory on a NTFS partition and shared with a Windows 7 dual boot. I don't know if Windows 7 caused the trouble.\nIs there anyway I can get back 'terminal'? Without terminal, life is miserable.\n\nA: This worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press CtrlAltT to bring up the terminal\n\n*Enter command:\nunity --reset-icons\n\ninto the terminal and press enter. Your screen will flash for a second, but it will come back and work.\n\nA: *\n\n*Try pressing Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to bring up the terminal.\n\n*Right-click the Terminal icon in the Unity bar and select Keep in launcher.\n\n\nA: The issue you have is not related to Terminal. The issue is your Unity interface. To fix the issue try the following:\n1) Launch Ubuntu Software Center.\n2) Do a search for Unity.\n3) Click where it says Interface designed for efficiency of space and interaction.\n4) Then click More Info.\n5) Then make sure that all the options are checked except CompizConfigSettings Manager.\n6) Then scroll back up and apply the changes.\n7) Restart your computer and try searching Terminal again.\n\nA: Hold the Super key (Windows logo key) and it will bring \"search\" dash home. Typing terminal there will bring the terminal icon.\nAlt+F2 brings the special run command. If you type a folder name, it will find it in nautilus, for example.\n\nA: if any of the above things not helped you means , you lost your terminal completely  . so you have to reinstall it .Open your software-center and in the search box type terminal and install it from there.\n\nA: It has been my experience that the more comfortable with the Command Line Interface (CLI) that I grow I find myself using keyboard short cuts to work smarter, not harder.  Without a doubt I would use the 'CTRL+ALT' plus 'T' to call up the terminal.\nAlso something that I found to be interesting is that when you call up the terminal you can simply type 'firefox' to bring up your Internet or you can type 'firefox google' to bring up Google specifically.  \n\nA: Maybe a unity --reset would solve the problem… But you will loose some of your costumization… I did it once and it solved some problems…\nEdit:\nAs of 13.04, unity reset is deprecated.  See here for resetting Unity: How do I reset my Unity configuration?\n\nA: Had this problem myself and I fixed it by:\n\n*\n\n*From the DASH / Unity program, move the mouse down to the grey bar of icons at the bottom of the screen:\n\n\n\n*Click on the second from the left, (the capital A with a ruler across it)\n\n\n*Scroll completely to the end of the list to \"Applications\". It has the same symbol of the A crossed with a ruler.\n\n\n*Then click \"Enable\", then click the mouse in an empty area of the screen to return to the main DASH menu.\nYou should now be able to access the Terminal from DASH again!\n\nA: I had this problem ... here's what fixed it for me:\nI went to Dash and then clicked the Filter Applications link in the top right. \nI found that, for some reason, the Applications filter had become unselected.  I selected it and was able to use Dash to search for Terminal again.\n", "Q: How to find source for a line in $PATH? I've got a line in my $PATH that is invalid and want to delete it, but I'm not sure where it's coming from.  It's not being set in .bashrc, .profile, or /etc/environment. \nIs there any way to figure out its source? Thanks!\n\nA: Environment variables should be set in either /etc/environment or /etc/profile, or their equivalent per-user files ~/.pam_environment or ~/.profile. Since you've checked /etc/environment and ~/.profile, check /etc/profile (and note that it sources files in /etc/profile.d/). There's no ~/.pam_environment by default.\nIf the bad PATH gets set by bash, you can start bash as an interactive login shell, with xtrace enabled, bash -xil, to help pinpoint the place where it happens.\nEDIT: With more useful output and pipe to less:\nPS4='+ $BASH_SOURCE:$LINENO: ' bash -xilc '' 2>&1 | less\n\n\nA: /etc/environment should set the PATH variable defaults. I recommend to have a look, maybe this file was modified on your system.\nA workaround could be to unset the PATH variable and to \"re-set\" it each time you login.\n\nA: I got frustrated with the bloated ~/.bashrc that is installed! i deleted it and made a minimal version that sets the PATH and aliases ls, all that other stuff i dont need. perhaps you want to start from scratch?\n", "Q: GDM2 not respecting my conf setting, default blank theme. Lucid OpenBox no gnome-settings-daemon I'm running Lucid and OpenBox, also I dont use gnome-settings-daemon.  I really want to set a background and gtk theme + icons for GDM2.  I have been through the gonf settings, for example,\nsudo -u gdm gconftool-2 --set --type string --set /desktop/gnome/background/picture_filename /usr/share/backgrounds/ebrit.png\n\nIf it is relevant my arch is armel.\nIf my gconf command should have changed my GDM background, please let me know it was correct.\n\nA: No answer... \nI removed GDM2 and installed SLIM.  I would use LightDM for anything newer than lucid.  Although SLIM works great for lucid, and is in repository.  No PPA Builds availble for armel LightDM, and It's frustrating to build on a smartphone like netbook.\n", "Q: How do I prevent Ubuntu gradually slowing down to a stop? I really do not know what is causing the problem of my desktop environment (D.E.) gradually slowing down.  It seems to happen in Gnome 3.2, LXDE, XFCE, and KDE.  I am running Ubuntu 11.10 and this problem started happening from a fresh install.\nI have noticed that if I restart Gnome or otherwise re-log-in with any of the D.E.s the speed resets to normal.  I don't seem to have and memory leaks that account for it and there are not any processes that are using excessive CPU cycles.  Due to the symptoms I am guessing that there is an underlying package that interacts with all D.E.s that is the source of the problem.\nJust to clarify, in extreme situations, if I let the slowdown continue without a restart of the D.E. my system will finally get to a point where everything, even my clock, freezes. The time over which Gnome slows down (noticeably after 17 hrs) is much less than LXDE, or XFCE but eventually they freeze as well.  I didn't mention Unity since I haven't used it enough to verify the problem, but I don't see why it should be different.  \nJust in case this is relevant, I Suspend my computer rather than turn it off.  I do this because of the greatly reduced load time and the 17 hrs I stated above is actual up-time, not time where the D.E. is actually active.  However, the slow down does not seem to be affected by how long the computer has been in suspend mode.\nI know that it is possible that this problem is due to an interaction between two or more of the applications that I use and as such it may not be able to be duplicated by others.  In the end I am just wondering (a) are other people experiencing this issue and (b) does anyone have some advice on where to start looking for a solution if one is not already known.  I am even open to the idea of switching to the beta release of 12.04 if anyone thinks it will solve the problem.\nEdit:\nI took a video of my latest freeze that you can watch at http://youtu.be/flKUqUzCmdE, sorry about the audio.\nEdit:\nSince that video I checked my memory for errors and tried installing the proprietary video drivers.  No memory errors were found and the proprietary video drivers made the display unusable so I had to uninstall them.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: To diagnose this, I suggest you run top on a terminal. You can run two instances, one sorted by CPU usage (the default) and the other by memory usage. Keep an eye on memory used by applications, load average (if it increases constantly, the system will become very sluggish with values around 5), swap usage and the \"wa\" value in the CPU line that would indicate the amount of time a CPU is waiting for I/O.\nthe symptoms you describe suggest either a memory leak (which you say you don't have, could you detail how you determined this?), a CPU hog somewhere (this would lead to your fan spinning very noisily, you should notice this!), or possibly slowdown caused by the CPU overheating and going to a lower speed (if you don't notice your fan spinning up, it may be malfunctioning).\nDisk problems like Uri Herrera mentions may also influence this, but if your disks are damaged to the point of causing a slowdown you'd see a lot of messages in /var/log/syslog about a failing sda. You can also look for this.\n", "Q: Firefox status bar not showing I'm using Firefox 10.0.2 and the Status-4-Evar add-on.

In the past it was not possible to install Ubuntu on a pure Btrfs file system (/ btrfs + swap), will it be possible for 12.04?\n\nA: You have been able to install Ubuntu into btrfs since 10.10\nSee the following guides\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/btrfs\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1389279\nWith that said, see the stability section on the wiki\nYou can boot a btrfs root (/boot) partition with grub2 (1.99), but the initrd has to be compressed with zlib (not lzo)\nLooking as /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf, gzip appears to be the default, you should be good to go.\nAnd from the ubuntu wiki page I gave you :\n\nAs of 11.04-beta1, it is possible to use only btrfs file systems with the caveat that grub _MUST_NOT_ be installed to the boot sector of the btrfs volume containing /boot.\n\nSo install Ubuntu 11.04 or higher, be sure to install grub to the MBR (this is the default behavior of the installer).\n", "Q: Install Japanese in Kubuntu I study Japanese so it's helpful to be able to type it on my computer. \nI have iBus installed and under Local in Settings, I installed Japanese, though it only gave me the option for translations.

Particularly the sections on source based policy routing (although you would be doing it based on source and/or destination) and split access.  Also, if you did uploads/downloads on a particular port number, that would make it easy to match on.  \n", "Q: Change Ubuntu one and one-conf sync account I've made a mistake and created a second account in Ubuntu SSO with my new email account and now I want to change it from the one-conf and from my Ubuntu one account.

If everything explodes, just select an older version from Grub and remove the package once you're booted up.\nIf you do want to follow the dark path of compiling your own kernel, I've written a few answers over the years that might help point you in the right direction.\n\n\n*\n\n*Building own kernel on ubuntu\n\n*Error when I try to compile the kernel 2.6.37\n\n*Correct way to apply patches to your kernel?\n\n*2.6.37 (or 2.6.36) Ubuntu Kernel in Maverick. Is this possible and where can I get it?\nThey're old posts but everything in them should still apply today.\n\nA: Maybe you just try to install a new kernel with apt-get?\nTry\napt-cache search linux-image\nin order to find a new kernel package. Install it with\napt-get install <package name>\nafterwards and reboot.\nIf you are not logged in as root, you should place a \"sudo\" in front of every command listed here.\nIs this information useful for you?\n\nA: It will be easier for you to install a mainline kernel from here: \nHow can I install a newer kernel?\nYour best option may be to install 12.04. Be warned it is in beta at the moment, you might want to wait for the release.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10, replacing unity with gnome Today I've decided to replace unity with gnome. I used the \"gnome-session-fallback\".\nMy question is: is a fallback safe/effective in the long run? I was told that I can actually use some commands and get rid of unity totally and replace it with gnome. Is it true that replacing means more available things (compared to a gnome fallback)?\nI was wondering what the real difference is between a fallback and a new installation of gnome. \n\nA: Ubuntu already comes with Gnome 3, don't get all confused. Unity is compiz plug in, the underlaying environment is Gnome 3. The Gnome Shell is the new implementation of the Gnome 3 GUI, it's made of the regular Gnome  session and the Fallback session.\nPut simply Gnome Classic or Gnome Fallback Session, is the Gnome Shell without the \"3D\" greatness.\nIt is as effective as you get to work with it. Now, yes you can Uninstall Unity and just keep Gnome Shell or the use the Fallback session.\nNow, I get lost when you ask if you get \"more things available\" more of what?.\n\nA: There's a good howto here:\nUbuntu 11.10 Oneiric: Remove Unity and use Gnome Classic by Default\nI'm not sure if it gives you more available things...\n\nA: Maybe you can look at it like this:\nWhat you had before is now gone.  Completely gone.  Gnome 3 is different (that's the one where you got all your apps and stuff at the top left corner, and you got to go there to get to anything, or hit the windows key).\nFallback session is different, too!  Its similar but instead of having an 'Administration' tab at top along with 'Places' and 'Applications', now there are just the two and most of the admin stuff you need, all of it really, are under applications.\nSo the fallback and new install are very different and also both are different from earlier versions.\nSorry to break it to you.  I myself am pretty pissed about it. But my fallback session is almost as good, if only I could have buttons in my file browser so I could switch from icons to list, then I would be happy.\nAnyway, I am going back to 10.04 because 11.10 is too unstable for me. I don't know what the future will bring. I heard Mint will provide a 'classic' desktop, that might be where I go finally.\nFrankly I am surprised that Shuttlesworth would finally treat users just like Gates used to.  And my reaction is pretty much the same, F you buddy.

You can easily do this with the rtcwake command, included by default with most Linux systems.\nThis can be useful if you want your computer to do something at a specific time, but don’t want it running 24/7. For example, you could put your computer to sleep at night and have it wake up before you do to perform some downloads.\nUsing rtcwake\nThe rtcwake command requires root permissions, so it must be run with sudo on Ubuntu and other Ubuntu-derived distributions. On Linux distributions that don’t use sudo, you’ll have to log in as root with the su command first.\nHere’s the basic syntax of the command:\nsudo rtcwake -m [type of suspend] -s [number of seconds]\n\nFor example, the following command suspends your system to disk (hibernates it) and wakes it up 60 seconds later:\nsudo rtcwake -m disk -s 60\n\nTypes of Suspend\nThe -m switch accepts the following types of suspend:\nstandby – Standby offers little power savings, but restoring to a running system is very quick. This is the default mode if you omit the -m switch.\nmem – Suspend to RAM. This offers significant power savings – everything is put into a low-power state, except your RAM. The contents of your memory are preserved.\ndisk – Suspend to disk. The contents of your memory are written to disk and your computer is powered off. The computer will turn on and its state will be restored when the timer completes.\noff – Turn the computer off completely. rtcwake’s man page notes that restoring from “off” isn’t officially supported by the ACPI specification, but this works with many computers anyway.\nno – Don’t suspend the computer immediately, just set the wakeup time. For example, you could tell your computer to wake up at 6am. After that, can put it to sleep manually at 11pm or 1am – either way, it will wake up at 6am.\nSeconds vs. Specific Time\nThe -s option takes a number of seconds in the future. For example, -s 60 wakes your computer up in 60 seconds, while -s 3600 wakes your computer up in an hour.\nThe -t option allows you to wake your computer up at a specific time. This switch wants a number of seconds since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970). To easily provide the correct number of seconds, combine the date command with the rtcwake command.\nThe -l switch tells rtcwake that the hardware clock is set to local time, while the -u switch tells rtcwake that the hardware clock (in your computer’s BIOS) is set to UTC time. Linux distributions often set your hardware clock to UTC time and translate that to your local time.\nFor example, to have your computer wake up at 6:30am tomorrow but not suspend immediately (assuming your hardware clock is set to local time), run the following command:\nsudo rtcwake -m no -l -t $(date +%s -d ‘tomorrow 06:30’)\n\nHelp\n\nA: You can try setting up BIOS for a wake up event, Almost every motherboard have that feature, use your mb manual and figure out it, in some AMI bios, it is called Wake up by RTC alarm, I think that is the easy way to wake up the PC at a specific time\n\nA: So if anyone is interested this is what I found that works, without having to install anything and as non-root.\nUse this command\nCode:\ndbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=org.freedesktop.UPower /org/freedesktop/UPower org.freedesktop.UPower.Suspend\n\nand to delay it use the sleep command with a number with either s m h or d (sec, min, day, hour) and with a ;\nexample\nCode:\nsleep 60s; dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=org.freedesktop.UPower /org/freedesktop/UPower org.freedesktop.UPower.Suspend\n\nThat suspends the computer after 60 seconds\n", "Q: How can I get my webcam to work in ICANHAZCHAT?

I'm confused, \nI think I can even remove my hard disk when ubuntu is running (If swap disk not included in the same disk) but in the windows, it is a dream!!!, how is this possible?\n\nA: A Wubi install makes use of loopback mounts.  Essentially it mounts your Windows file system, and then treats a file within that file system (your root file) as a block device.  This basically means that rather than reading the blocks of the file system from a partition directly, it looks at the layout of the file in the other file system to locate each individual block.  It isn't running the system out of RAM.\nIt then performs some gymnastics to make the loopback mounted file system appear as the root, and your Windows file system appear somewhere below the root.\nAs a general rule, you should not modify the backing file for a loopback mount, since it can confuse the file system driver that is referring to that file.  It would seem the actions you took were not enough to cause these problems though.\nOn UNIX systems, once you open a file for access it is still possible to read it without causing problems.  Consider the following short Python example:\nimport os\n\nwith open('oldname', 'w') as fp:\n    fp.write('content')\nwith open('oldname', 'r') as fp:\n    os.rename('oldname', 'newname')\n    print(fp.read())\n\nAs with your loopback mounted file system, we can still read the content after moving the file.  We can see a similar effect when removing a file:\nwith open('newname', 'r') as fp:\n    os.remove('newname')\n    print(fp.read())\n\nWhile the file name is removed, the actual content sticks around until the last open file descriptor is closed.  The loopback mount can be thought of as a file descriptor for these purposes.\nCopying the file is also unlikely to confuse the loopback mount (since it is just reading the original), but is not necessarily a good way to perform a backup.  It takes a while to read through a large file, so by the time you've got to the end of the file the start might have been modified.  So if you try to use the copied file as a disk image, it may appear to be corrupted (although that corruption may be fixable with a file system check).\nIf you want to back up your system, I would suggest either using the backup tool included with Ubuntu, or booting to Windows and copying the disk image there (since Ubuntu is not running, there is no chance of the disk image changing while you're copying it).\n", "Q: Are there any advantage using Wine over VM to run Windows programs? (or Vice Versa) I was wondering how Wine compares to VM when running Windows applications and what the pros and cons are for each?\n\nA: It really depends of what you want to do, or what kind of Win apps you want to run into Ubuntu... There's no \"better\" solution. \nWine is really defined to \"emulation\" of a software into a linux environnement. \nVM's is defined to run a full OS into another one (a kind of OS \"Inception\").\nGames are great with Wine (just think to add Winetricks package too for DLL, DirectX and Microsoft SQL stuff). But don't even think running a DirectX 3D game into a virtual machine (or you have a hardcore computer with huge resources). \nMicrosoft Office suites (especially 2007 & 2010 versions) doesn't run great with Wine (app crashes) but in this case, running them into a VM can be a good option. \n...and so on... \n\nA: VMs doing fine but I think you may find it slower than wine. And you may need more RAM to run a whole OS in VM, but you can do almost everthing in Wine more faster than VMs do. I personally use Wine because my 1GB RAM cries when VM runs out of memory and crashes whatever I was doing in the VM (almost every time). Wine does not support Adobe Software (even installation fails).\n\nA: If you want to run a game or Windows application, you can use PlayOnLinux or WINE (emulation).\nNot all Windows apps can be found on WINE or PlayOnLinux, in this case and if you really need to run a Windows app, or if you want to test something on a virtual machine; virtualization is helpful using VMware workstation or Virtual Box (freeware).\n\nA: If you are running a small windows game or app (like minesweeper ) use wine.\nIf you are running a more complex program, run a VM.\nWine is a windows compatibility layer.  It makes windows programs think that it is running in windows.  But since Windows is a closed platform, Wine cannot 100% emulate windows.  Some complex program need a VM to run it.\n\nA: In short: For performance, and closer integration to your current Linux desktop, use wine.\nFor getting things working and less trouble with odd incompatibilities - use the VM. Wine is pretty good - but for productivity apps it can be frustrating when it refuses to work for something.\nQualifier:\nI regularly use Evernote in wine - I am determined to get it to work beautifully - but this has not been easy.\n", "Q: Is there a way to search an MPD library with the music lens? I use MPD, along with the GUI client Sonata to play all my music. It works quite well, but none of my music shows up in the music lens (since I don't use Banshee or Rhythmbox, it's just empty).

On my older system i ran the 32 bit version of Ubuntu with 4  GB  of ram and noticed it rarely come near 1 gig of usage.I have my new system running with the 64 bit version.The new system is a quad core with 8 GB  of ram and Ubuntu is using 1 gig now.Is this normal?I have run top and noticed certain processes such as compiz,xorg and lightdm seeming to be using a lot.I also upgraded in my new system with an msi radeon hd6450 graphics card that s supposed to have 2 gigs on it.\n\nA: First, 64 bit executables tend to be larger than 32 bit executables, which could mean more RAM usage. Though I doubt this would be really noticeable.\nSecond, you want for Ubuntu to use your computer's RAM. The fact that you have 4GB more RAM installed means that Ubuntu will use RAM more eagerly. And that is a good thing.\nTo put your experience in relation: On this very machine, I have 4GB of RAM of which 3GB are currently in use. Even though some programs eat memory as if it was candy (e.g. Java), not using the available RAM would be bad for performance. You always want for working data to be in the RAM and not on your slow HDD.\nSo having 1GB in use means your system is pretty much lazy and working normal. Which isn't to say that it wasn't normal for your system to eat up 7GB. Normal depends on the software you run.\nOn the requirement page for Ubuntu 12.04, it says 512MB are needed if you want a desktop environment. 384MB are needed for installation without it.\nThose requirement limit what a PC needs to run Ubuntu. Any more RAM is bonus and should be used for performance's sake.\n\nA: One thing that I have noticed contribute massively to RAM usage is resolution size, and colour depth. Using 16-bit colours over 32-bit, and using 1024x768 over 1200x900 [or whatever massive] resolution can save 50MB and upwards, depending on your current settings.\nHowever, this should only be done if you want to minimize the RAM and amount of processing done.\n", "Q: How to install software's by default in new volume Virtual Box Running on Mac Initially I had installed Ubuntu 11.10 on VirtualBox running on Mac OS, with hard-disk storage of 8GB. As I was left with only 50MB space, I increased the diskspace on the VirtualBox by another 8 GB (Total 16GB) using Mac terminal.\nWhen I logged into Ubuntu I was seeing 2 volumes 8GB (Original) and 8GN (Newly created).

How do i make new software to install on new volume by default.\n\nA: That is not how to increase the size of the disk your virtual machine is using as root.\nSo while you could use the second disk as storage, you will still not have sufficient space on your root partition.\nWhat you need to do is make a new, larger disk, how much space do you need 4 Gb ?\nSo make a new 12 Gb (or larger) disk. \nAdd this new disk to your virtual machine.\nBoot the virtual machine with a live CD, ubuntu or gparted.\nUse gparted to first copy the ubuntu partition from the old 8 Gb disk to the 12 gb disk. Then enlarge the 8 gb partition to 12 Gb.\nShut down the VM, remove the 8 Gb disk, boot from the 12 Gb disk.\nSee also\nhttps://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?t=10348\nhttp://www.gparted.org/display-doc.php?name=help-manual&lang=C\n", "Q: no internet with a Realtec RTL 8111/8168B chip set I am new to Ubuntu 11.10 in fact have only used Windows.\nI am having difficulty getting internet working under Ubuntu.\nHardware - ASUS 24\" all in one computer with a Realtec RTL 8111/8168B PCI Express rev 6 chip set.\nI have tried to force the IP address through the network manager.

Until I executed apt install ufw, the log entries were directed to /var/log/syslog.\nI also installed rsyslog as one of the answers here in this thread recommend, but it didn't help me that much until I restarted rsyslog AFTER installing ufw properly. Why? In /etc/rsyslog.d/ you might see a ufw conf file (mine was named 20-ufw.conf) that splits out the UFW messages into their own file. Since that file wasn't put there in the minimal install, all entries end up in syslog. After doing the ufw install, restarting rsyslog causes it to read the configuration and start putting entries into /var/log/ufw.log\nOnce I did that, all the things discussed about ufw out on the internet and in this thread started working. Pretty frustrating, but I did install minimal!\nHere are some links to the 20.04 ufw man pages. Your favorite search providers might not list them in your results.

If this is not the place to ask this, please forgive this Ubuntu cub, I want to ask, what do people do with Ubuntu?\nAs an Ask Ubuntu user I can see that most of the users (including myself) are asking questions about entertainment related problems. Is that all? No commercial use with it? Do people make fun of Ubuntu or just pretending to be Ubuntu users and use Windows secretly? \nPlease don't hate me or make fun of me, I know lots of people trying to make Ubuntu even better, and I know it's better than Windows (if Adobe software just work on Ubuntu, I won't see Windows logo on my monitor anymore).\nWhat hinders Ubuntu from getting traction in the professional field?\n\nA: You have somewhat answered your question, most professional work depends on professional software that is not available for Ubuntu. Using workarounds like wine or a VM that will give you worse performance or lot's of problems don't make sense for a pure business view (they are more expensive/less productive than windows)\nThat said, I use Ubuntu for work, but I'm mainly a software developer (add a little bit of system administrator and business management to it to get the full picture), so, in my profession the best tools are made for linux.\nIn our company we use plenty of Ubuntu, for servers, and for the computers on our shops (they only do basic things like email, internet and use our own linux-compatible software: POS, stock management). But most of the computers in the office are windows machines, they usually need to use some program that is not available for linux.\nWe also use lots of windows (and even DOS) machines for computers that are attached to different specialized machines (industrial printers or paint coloring machines) as this is the OS that they support.\nTo summarize, in most professional uses, Windows (or Macs for design, film-making, etc...) just makes more sense.\n\nA: There are a couple of factors at-play here.\nFirst of all, CIO's, Directors and other business decision makers (especially at big companies) suffer from what I call the \"Wal-Mart syndrome.\"  Their perception is that free (as-in beer) software doesn't cost anything, so it can't possibly be as good as something that costs thousands of dollars.  We had a hard enough time convincing our management to let us use JBoss and Cassandra.  I couldn't imagine trying to convince them to go with Ubuntu as a corporate desktop (although it would be really cool).\nNow you might think \"that's crazy, who wouldn't want something for free?\"  The answer is that when these CIO's and Directors have to go explain their decisions to their non-techie bosses/partners, it's easier to just say \"we went with Microsoft and this is what it costs\", rather than trying to explain what open source is and why it doesn't cost anything.  That and to a really big company, throwing-down $10k for a software site license is nothing when they make $10 billion in sales each year.\nThe other big issue is licensing and support.  Let's say that you have a special 3rd party desktop application that your business can't live without.  You work with it and find a way to make it run on Ubuntu (with Wine, Mono, etc...).  When it comes time for your company needing help with it, that vendor is going to throw the support contract in your face and tell you that you violated it by not running it on Windows.\nDon't get me wrong, I don't like it either.  While things are changing, all signs point to Windows remaining the standard enterprise desktop for a while.\n\nA: Just my opinion:  \nMost Askubuntu users are using for home/new.  You can use Ubuntu for a LOT of things.  If you want an idea of what people use Ubuntu for you could check the list of appliances that are Ubuntu derived.  They're not as tunable and general purpose as a full Ubuntu install, but it gives you an idea of what it can be used for if configured properly.  You could also check a list of Ubuntu based appliances on VMWare Market.  \nEverything from a Windows PDC drop-in replacement, to a development workstation, to multimedia entertainment systems.  The only thing that limits the usability is knowing about configuration for any number of open source or linux compatible products.  Ubuntu's hardware compatability/automatic install getting you to a desktop is what makes it stand apart.   \nI thought I should add that I hear in India they are thinking about switching the entire educational system to Ubuntu.  \nThis could run on forever, but it seems to me that a lot of the corporate linux server use tends to lean towards RHEL.  I'm not sure why, but it does.\n\nA: As a freelance writer, photographer and website designer/developer I only use Ubuntu and have for about 6 years. I've learned how to get around IE quirks and limitations on my websites. There is no compelling technical reason for me to use anything other than Ubuntu. I wish Photoshop was available on Ubuntu but find I can still accomplish everything I need to with GIMP. If a client wants a Microsoft Word format file I use Microsoft font and now Libreoffice which can save in MS formats. As to the web I have chosen to only use open standards which allow for the widest variety of devices and platforms to correctly render sites I develop.\n\nA: I guess it really matters what profession you're in. The company I work for, which is in the software consultancy business, mostly use ubuntu with a sprinkle of debian, gentoo and mac. \n", "Q: removing unity and gnome panel in xubuntu After running the update manager for the first time and rebooting, I am greeted with a few ubuntu applications and when I logout I can see the unity and gnome shell option in the login screen.\nHow can I remove unity and gnome panel without breaking xubuntu-desktop?  \nI want to completely remove the non-XFCE options from the login manager e.g. lightdm/gdm.\n\nA: My opinion, the best way to do that is install from xubuntu media instead of ubuntu mainline media and installing the xubuntu-desktop package.  In my experience, removing the packages you're talking about leads to broken dependency chains or weird bugs when you try and get some other app/widget to work.  You can certainly do it, but I'm not a fan of doing so.\n\nA: Have a look here for information on getting a 'pure' xfce.\n", "Q: Wine + Microsoft Access + Windows Share I have a VB6 application running on Wine. That application uses a mdb database, but the mdb file is on a Windows share (Iomega StorCenter). I mount the share via fstab, and assign the letter \"d:\" via Wine. When I run the application fires a exception because it can't lock the mdb file (create a lock file).\nThe fstab line I use is:\n//IomegaStorCenter/public/Server /home/jmm/Iomega cifs,uid=wine,gid=users,fmask=7777,dmask=0777,iocharset=utf8,codepage=unicode, unicode 0 0\n\nAnybody knows how can I mount the share to avoid the exception?\n\nA: As with umask, fmask and dmask are subtracted from 777 to get you the effective permitions. So you are actually mounting your share as 000, meaning \"no one can read, write or execute\"\nAlso, do you really need that many custom configuration options? If this is your home computer, I suggest this:\n//IomegaStorCenter/public/Server /home/jmm/Iomega cifs defaults,uid=jmm,gid=plugdev,umask=022\n\njmm, I presume, is your username. If not, change accordingly. Also, I strongly suggest you not to mount drives in your home directory. As root, create /mnt/iomega directory and then mount there. If you want, create a symlink in your home folder pointing there. The command in terminal would be:\nsudo mkdir -p /mnt/iomega\n\nAnd the fstab entry would then be:\n//IomegaStorCenter/public/Server /mnt/iomega cifs defaults,rw\n\nTroubleshoot\nIf this didn't work, let's try from the very beggining, just to check if there are any loose ends:\n1 - Delete all lines from fstab concerning the IomegaStorCenter. Reboot\n2 - Use Nautilus > Network > Windows Network > Workgroup (or whatever your workgroup is called), and see if the drive shows. Double-click it.\n3 - Does it ask for username/password? Do you know them? Do they work and nautilis show the shared folders? (note: this is not your Ubuntu username/password.It's the share login/password, which you might have previously configuted in IomegaStorCenter\n4 - Stil using nautilus, can you drag and drop and create files there? Edit them, rename, delete, etc?\nIf yes, then fstab is your only issue. If not, then you must configure IomegaStorCenter before going on, until you can properly access it via Nautilus.\n5 - Unmount the drive in Nautilus (use the \"Eject\" button)\nNow in terminal (it can be done via GUI/Nautilus, but copy-and-paste command in terminal is faster and less error-prone):\n6 - delete the old mountpoint. MAKE SURE IT IS EMPTY BEFORE YOU DO THAT\nrmdir /home/jmm/Iomega \n\n7 - create the new mountpoint and a symlink from old location to the new one\nsudo mkdir -p /mnt/iomega\nln -s /mnt/iomega /home/jmm/Iomega\n\n8 - Add one (but not both) of these lines to fstab, depending on whether your share needs password or not:\n//IomegaStorCenter/public/Server /mnt/iomega cifs defaults,rw,username=YOURSHAREUSER,password=YOURPASSWORD 0 0\n//IomegaStorCenter/public/Server /mnt/iomega cifs defaults,rw 0 0\n\n9 - Mount it, to test if enty is ok:\nsudo mount /mnt/iomega\n\n10 - Open nautilus, got to /mnt/iomega and try to copy some files. Edit, delete, etc.\nIf it works, great. If not, try to copy files using terminal and paste here the error message. also type ls -la /mnt/iomega, sudo mount and paste results.\n11 - Now go to Wine config and make sure D: points to the new, correct location, /mnt/iomega. Also use nautilus to browse to /home/jmm/.wine/dosdevices/d: and see if it the correct location.\n12 - Test you VB app and be happy :)\n\nA: Use this line in your fstab\n//server/share /mnt/mountname cifs username=server_user,password=user_password,iocharset=utf8,mode=0777,dir_mode=07‌​77 0 0\n\nWhere\nserver = your server that you are trying to access\nshare = mapped share on that server\n/mnt/mountname = any folder that you created with sudo /mnt/<folder_name> (or any folder in your home that you can access\nusername = the name of the user on that server that can access the mount\npassword = the password for that user\n\nAfter that you can test with sudo mount -a, if you don't get any faults you can safely reboot to find your shares mounted in /mnt/<folder_name>.\n\nTo use a credentials file instead of the username and password parameters on the fstab you can create a file with those 2 lines so that your username and password are not explicitly shown in the fstab\nsudo nano /etc/cifspwd\nAdd these lines to the file\nusername=<username on server>\npassword=<password for that username>\n\nPress ctrl+x keys and when asked press y to save the file.\nSecure it with\nsudo chmod 600 /etc/cifspwd\n\nUse this line instead of the previous\n//server/share /mnt/mountname cifs credentials=/etc/cifspwd,iocharset=utf8,mode=0777,dir_mode=07‌​77 0 0\n\nAfter this it will be safe to reboot and you mount should be mounted and your details secured.\n", "Q: Can I change architecture from 32 to 64bits without using a CD? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs it possible to “upgrade” from a 32bit to a 64bit installation? \n\nI accidentally installed the wrong architecture and would like to \"upgrade\" to amd64.\nIs there anyway, without downloading the am64 ISO and burning it.\n\nA: No, there is not.

The native resolution is 1024x600 and I want to increase it to 1440x810 or 135%. I've tried two methods that both use xrandr...creating a new resolution mode and applying it to my display, and scaling the display.\nThis picture shows the commands I entered into the terminal to create a new resolution mode:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter \"xrandr -q\" to show that the current resolution is 1024x600.\n\n*Enter \"cvt 1440 810 60\" to find the modeline for a resolution of 1440x810 at 60Hz.\n\n*Enter \"xrandr --newmode...\" to create the custom mode.\n\n*Enter \"xrandr --addmode LVDS1...\" to apply the mode to my netbook display.

Gnome-power-statistics is run when you click on the battery icon in the top panel of a laptop. It shows battery history such as charge and rate, as well as statistics such as discharge profile and discharge accuracy.\n\nThe more you use your laptop, the more data it shows, and the more accurate the battery time-to-empty predictions are.\nSo, where does gnome-power-statistics get the raw historical data from?\nAnd, if it also saves any data, where does it save it to?\n\nA: Ubuntu uses upower (version 10.4+). Older versions used DeviceKit-power (9.10) or HAL (<9.10).\nRegarding upower:\n\nUPower is an abstraction for enumerating power devices, listening to device events and querying history and statistics. Any application or service on the system can access the org.freedesktop.UPower service via the system message bus. Some operations (such as suspending the system) are restricted using PolicyKit.\nUPower was once called DeviceKit-power. UPower aims to make a large chunk of HAL redundant, as HAL is officially deprecated.\n\n\n*\n\n*UPower Reference Manual\n\n*UPower Reference Manual: devices\nFrom the last link: The org.freedesktop.UPower API has a org.freedesktop.UPower.Device and that one has a ...\nGetStatistics ()\n\nGetStatistics (in  's'     type,               out 'a(dd)' data)\n\nGets statistics for the power device that may be interesting to show \non a graph in the session.\n\ntype: The mode for the statistics. Valid types are charging or discharging.\ndata: The statistics data for the power device. \n\nEach element contains the following members:\nvalue: The value of the percentage point, usually in seconds\naccuracy: The accuracy of the prediction in percent.\n\nto provide data that is used in the graph. I think that the data is cleared when you reboot/shutdown so it is probably real-time and has no history.\n\nA: I've just answered a simular question here, but here is the summary:\nUPower's historical information is stored in four files in /var/lib/upower/, yours will be different but mine are named:\n./var/lib/upower/history-time-empty-DELL_KP4377-57-22096.dat\n./var/lib/upower/history-time-full-DELL_KP4377-57-22096.dat\n./var/lib/upower/history-charge-DELL_KP4377-57-22096.dat\n./var/lib/upower/history-rate-DELL_KP4377-57-22096.dat\n\nIt appears to compile this data from the information in /sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/device:00/PNP0C0A:00/power_supply/BAT0 which I'm guessing is in turn directly taken from acpi's information on the current battery state at /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/info.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Why am I not asked for password at startup? I have Xubuntu 11.10. \nWhen I log out and in (without restarting the computer) I am always required to chose a session and provide a password for entering that session. \nBut when I restart the computer I am logged directly into my last session (or asked to chose between my saved sessions  - as an already logged user - , if I check to be prompted on login) without any password being asked. \nIn all the other normal circumstances I am asked for my password (installing in terminal, accessing Synaptic, using root access etc)  - except when opening my computer, which is odd.\nIn Setting Manager, Sessions and Startup, I see (and have checked) the options regarding the login, logout and saving sessions but there seems to be no option for the startup as such, just for sessions. Is there such an option? There must be, I have the impression that after the first OS installation (some 4 months ago) I was beeing asked for password when starting my PC.\nHow could I turn that back?\n-- Considering some answers I got, I add the following:\nI cannot find where to set the login window to appear (the one that in Ubuntu is System>Administration>Login Window). If I set to be prompted upon login, as I said (in Setting Manager, Sessions and Startup), that is a different matter: I am in fact already logged in as user when asked to chose between user-saved sessions. I don't seem to find the settings for System--> Login Window so as to check the option to be prompted to chose sessions (even Ubuntu or Lubuntu sessions if installed) AT STARTUP. --\n\nA: In the file /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf, comment out the line starting with autologin-user=.\nFor the record, in 'Applications Menu > System > Users and Groups' you can toggle the option 'Don't ask for password on login'. However, lightdm.conf apparently overrides this on startup. As far as I can tell, there is no way to change this through a GUI.\n\nA: If you can't access the directory or the file, you can also try to go to the top left where it says Activities, click it, and type in Users. Then click on Users and you will probably have auto-login on. To unlock it you will have to click unlock at the top left and enter your password.

Once we do this, we can recover the passphrase via bash from another account, but have hoping to avoid the \"manual\" log in step.\nWe should mention, this is an Internet facing server, that we are doing our best to \"lock it down\", that we are trying to prevent users from changing their passwords \"willy nilly\", and so will require them to make password change requests, and that the point of the encryption is to keep users out of each others accounts (there are other, perhaps better ways to address this need - including just \"hiding\" their /home though the encryption also forces a log in, in addition to ssh).  \nSo, is there a way to script a login (we've seen posts on google that this isn't possible) that replaces the manual one so that the passphrase gets created and they we can capture and record it using ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase.\n\nA: I can't say for sure if the current implementation of the encrypted home set up scripts allow you to do what you're trying. Someone else will have to help you with that.\nHowever, I do want to point out that your use of eCryptfs is a bit misguided. eCryptfs isn't really designed to provide a form of enhanced access control and relying on it to do that has some problems.\nIf a malicious user is trying to access another user's data and that user's encrypted home directory is mounted (implying that the encryption key is in the kernel key ring), then eCryptfs doesn't really provide anything more than regular DAC permissions. If the attacker can bypass DAC, he likely has some type of a kernel exploit and eCryptfs provides no protection if the encryption keys are already loaded into the kernel key ring at that point. \nNote that there is some useful protection for the users who do not have their home directory mounted at the time of the attack, but you'll have to determine if it is more or less likely for your users to have their home directory mounted at any given time.\nAlso note that if you're planning on making backups of the encrypted data, you'll get benefits from the backups being encrypted on a per-user basis. Admins won't have an easy time accessing the data and you'll lose less sleep over misplaced tape drives.\nI don't mean to discourage you against using eCryptfs, but I do want you to understand what you're getting in return for the added complexity and slight decrease in performance when using file encryption.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 11.10 on HP Envy 15 - Partition Problems I am trying to install Ubuntu 11.10 on my HP ENVY 15, however I am getting some problems. When I come to the partitioning section of the installation I am given my 4 partitions that I have. \nI change the partition of my 450 gb to 420 gb, so that I can use that 30gb space that I free up to install Ubuntu on it. After I do this step, instead of seeing the keyword to the 30gb I see unusable. \nI have read that there can not be more than 4 partitions somewhere for a UBUNTU installation, but that is not true, because I just installed Ubuntu 11.10 on my Lenovo which has the same amount of partitions as my ENVY ( I do get problems on my lenovo with installing ATI drivers but that is a completely different story). \nDoes anybody have an idea of why I am getting an unusable notification next to my freed up space? \n\nA: I have an HP DV6tSE which is a very similar laptop to your Envy15.

TL;DR: Can I remove completely unity and gnome3 but keep compiz?\nLong Version:\nI really gave a go both to unity and to gnome3. I really did. I just can't bear them.\nI need something that I can rely on for a long while.\nI decided to do away with desktop managers; I want to build my own desktop environment with independent parts.\nMy requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*My workflow is very dependent on compiz; I don't care about the effects, but I use a lot of it's key bindings to move/resize/manage windows, as well as workspaces, and I could not find another window manager that has everything I need. So the window manager has to be compiz, unless you know another WM with the same flexibility. Alternatively, I can use xMonad, but I like it less.\n\n*I need something that can replace applets, in order to be able to connect to network,  control sound, hold pidgin indicator, etc. Some sort of light-weight dock maybe? If it can use my icons and my theme by default, it would be great (instead of trying to replicate the theme).\n\n*Desktop management would be nice as I often drag-drop stuff from and on it temporarily. But it's not mandatory(Is there an independent app for that?).\n\n\nMy questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How would I go about completely remove unity and gnome and keep compiz? Can I safely just apt-get remove them?\n\n*Is there anything I should know? The purpose is to build a rock-solid desktop; it should not end up being even less stable than the defaults (I am thinking in particular of nm-applet, which always worked perfectly for me, contrary to other network managers).\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*I could use fallback session, or install gnome2, XFCE or LMDE or similar, but I really just want to do away with the whole monolithic window manager + shell paradigm. I want flexible, loosely coupled parts.\n\n*I know about cinnamon and mate, and I really admire the work that Mint is doing (some sanity, finally), but I really would rather have a light-weight dock that only launches stuff (as opposed to taking care of a lot of other things).\n\n\nA: You can create a standalone compiz session with gnome3-gnome-panel+metacity, unity 2d launcher, awn wing-panel(with all applets), docky, synypse, cairo-dock,slingshot or combination of these.Have a look on following screenshots:\n\n\nEdgebuntu Desktop\n\nMilky-Moorhen (DE) \n\nCairo-Dock Session\n\nUnity Gnome-shell fusion\nIn above screenshots you can replace unity-launcher with docky or awn or cairo-dock.\nTo setup custom sssion with compiz check out this article:\n\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2012/02/how-to-create-standalone-compiz-session.html\nFor Awn-Wingpanel checkout this video:\n\nhttp://vimeo.com/18598545\nFor Ciaro-dock 2.4 with custom gnome-session follow this article:\n\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2011/09/cairo-dock-240-released-with-custom.html\nYou can get additional help from these articles:\n\n[HOWTO] Configure Unity 2D to Simulate Unity 3D\nHow to enable compiz in gnome-classic mode\nFix gnome-panel in gnome fallback session\nRun AWN / Dock in Natty Narwhal(generally for gnome2)\n\nNotes: There are many bugs in 11.10, which makes using custom session a painful experience(such as this bug: #bug 826771).I will update the post with important GDM & compiz fix.\n\nUpdates: Bug 826771 has been fixed in nautilus - 1:3.2.1-0ubuntu4.2 (ubuntu 12.04) for gnome-session.But there are other bugs (specially gdm bugs) still present in Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: For the first question:\napt-get purge gnome\napt-get autoremove\n\nMore info at here: Remove Gnome Shell completely after installing it?\nFor Unity:\napt-get remove unity unity-2d-places unity-2d unity-2d-panel unity-2d-spread unity-asset-pool unity-services unity-lens-files unity-lens-music unity-lens-applications gir1.2-unity-4.0 unity-common indicator-sound indicator-power indicator-appmenu libindicator6 indicator-application evolution-indicator indicator-datetime indicator-messages libnux-1.0-0 nuxtools\n\nMore info here: Remove Gnome Shell completely after installing it?\nThere's a lot of info already if people took the time to do a fast search in here\n\n\nA: Install Xubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\nits the best alternative for people who hates unity and Gnome . and one more thing you can run compiz in xubuntu also . \n\nA: I'm not sure if this qualifies as an answer, but I hope it's OK to put it here, as it may be too big for a comment.  I haven't actually tried getting rid of the shell - I use gnome3 \"Classic\", with AWN and Compiz.  I actually like having the Gnome panel at the top with some of its apps and indicators, but then I have dual monitors, so I have room for an extra panel.  I have AWN on the bottom, and use it a bit like the Unity panel.\nYour idea sounded interesting, so I looked around a little and found this article in the arch wiki that might be interesting to you:  \nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Compiz\nAbout half-way down is the section \"As a Standalone Window Manager\" that you might want to look at.  \n", "Q: What classifies an application as 'installed' in Ubuntu?

Single 4TB partition.\nSeeing that it's only reporting around 1.6TB, that much missing\nstorage suggests a meta-data problem to me.\nI would suggest tearing down the entire array and ensure the metadata is wiped\nby using dmraid -rE. Then, once those disks don't show up anymore, try making\na simple RAID1 from the 2 2T disks, your container capacity should be closer\nto 1.8-1.9 then 1.6. Once that is verified, then create your stripe, which\nought to just add the two together. If this doesn't work you might have a bug\nin either the firmware or the dmraid system itself.\ndmraid is ummm... interesting, given the choice I would prefer not to use it. You're\nbasically taking all the complexity of md-raid, without any increase in performance, and then mixing in a slew of different metadata formats from different vendors, and then sharing that metadata with multiple operating systems, trusting that the OS you shared it with doesn't ruin the metadata.\nYou might want to test actually replacing failed members after you get this configuration stable, a RAID is just a big single point of failure if you can't service it. Good luck.\nIn response to your dmraid -rE issue\nAt this point you're only option is dd if=/dev/zero ... and wipe the disks out.\n\nA: I have the very same problem and I believe I finally (after several days of googling without a satisfactory answer) found the problem.\nI believe this is a BUG - a 32bit unsigned int is used for the number of sectors somewhere (dmraid ?).\nNote, the number of sectors on (my) 2TB disk: 3906898048, which multiplied by 512B/sector gives 2.0TB or 1.8TiB\nWhen striped, it should double, but instead it gives: 3518828800 sectors, multiplied by 512 B/sector results to 1.8TB or 1.6TiB.\nConsidering that Windows 10 reads the correct 4TB size on that RAID10 partition, the error is likely on Linux side.\nConverted to binary: \n   3906898048 -> 0000 1110 1000 1101 1110 1000 1000 1000 0000\n2x 3906898048 -> 0001 1101 0001 1011 1101 0001 0001 0000 0000\n   3518828800 -> 0000 1101 0001 1011 1101 0001 0001 0000 0000\nCan please somebody look into it and create a patch?\nThank you.\n", "Q: How do I remove the driver installed from nvidia.com?

If anyone has a solution to this I would like to hear it, for the same reason that I use an unstable version of ubuntu: I appreciate the bells and whistles it has to offer.\n\nA: Have you tried Pam Face Recognition?\nIt's supost to detect your face through camera automatically.\nFirst of all open terminal (press Alt+F2 and type: gnome-terminal) and copy the following commands in the the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential cmake qt4-qmake libx11-dev libcv-dev libcvaux-dev libhighgui2.1 libhighgui-dev libqt4-dev libpam0g-dev checkinstall\n\ncd /tmp && wget http://pam-face-authentication.googlecode.com /files/pam-face-authentication-0.3.tar.gz\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:antonio.chiurazzi\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install pam-face-authentication\n\nafter the installation, Configure the software copy the following command in terminal:\ncat << EOF | sudo tee /usr/share/pam-configs/face_authentication /dev/null\n\nafter entering this command copy the following lines in the terminal and press enter:\nName: face_authentication profile\nDefault: yes\nPriority: 900\nAuth-Type: Primary\nAuth: \n[success=end default=ignore] pam_face_authentication.so enableX\nEOF\n\nNow Press Enter.\nBy this action, the file /usr/share/pam-configs/face_authentication is created and contains the plugin information.\nNow With the next command you can enable or disable the plugin:\nsudo pam-auth-update --package face_authentication\n\nSource\nAlso this has been answered in this forum here\n", "Q: Services not started during boot Ubuntu 10.04.4\nserver/no gui\nThe computer is hanging somewhere during the boot.

I wish to run VirtualBox with my Ubuntu laptop on the home network (so the desktop PC can access it through the router) and also be able to ssh into the VirtualBox from host on the go (different network or with no internet).\nPreviously, the only network adapter on the VB instance was a 'bridged connection' adapter. This allowed me to access the internet on the guest VB and for the other computers on the LAN + host to access it. However, whenever I took my laptop off the network, I could no longer access the guest from host.\nI read that I needed to enable a host-only adapter to access it off the network and a NAT adapter is used to access the internet from guest. \nMy question is can I run a host-only adapter + a NAT adapter alongside a bridged network adapter in VirtualBox? I am confused what I would put inside /etc/hosts? Would I put both IP's (host-only and bridged) with the same servername in /etc/hosts?\n\nA: Figured it out. I was following this tutorial and I was putting in eth1 instead of eth2. I had to use eth2 because host-only was 'adapter 3' in the VB settings-network (using VB's GUI). Now I am able to run both bridged and host-only!\nFor /etc/hosts: On the host machine I put: 'host-only-IP' 'servername' On the guest VB I put both the host-only and the bridged IP's with the same servername. Doesn't seem to cause an issue.\nSo to summarize; I have 3 adapters on the VB instance\n\n\n*\n\n*Bridged\n\n*Nat\n\n*Host-only.\n\n\nI have the host file on my host machine configured to use the host-only IP and my desktop host file is configured to use the bridged IP address. This way I can take out my laptop off the network and still be able to ssh into my VirtualBox server without changing any settings. Then I can turn the NAT network adapter on and the VirtualBox can use my hosts network for the internet away from my home network.\n", "Q: How do I restore an accidentally deleted initrd image?

Any help is greatly appreciated.\nEDIT\nHere is what happened:\nI bought a certificate from GeoTrust, installed it, activated the new virtualhost using that certificate, and restarted apache2. At no point in the lifetime of this server has any other certificate ever been used to secure web traffic, let alone the snakeoil certificate. Windows Vista and up, as well as OSX and all Linux distributions that I've tested use the correct certificate. Windows XP uses the snakeoil certificate (in IE. No other browsers on that VM). Here are some screenshots: \n\n\n\nA: Given the extra information you've provided, it is probably easier for me to start another answer.\nIt doesn't appear that the dummy \"snakeoil\" certificate is being presented to the Windows client.  The \"snakeoil\" certificate is generated with a subject of CN=Ubuntu, while the certificate being presented to the Windows box has a subject of CN=Production.  So we're looking at a third certificate here.\nI can see the same certificate if I connect to your server with OpenSSL's s_client:\n$ openssl s_client -connect portal.avendimedia.com:443\n...\nCertificate chain\n 0 s:/CN=Production\n   i:/CN=Production\n...\n\nWhat I believe is happening is that you've configured your web server to use the Server Name Indication extension.  This extension is designed to let a server present different certificates depending on which host name the client wants to connect to.\nThis works fine in most modern browsers, but does not work in Internet Explorer on Windows versions prior to Vista.  At this point, it seems highly unlikely that Microsoft will update the SSL libraries on Windows XP to support the SNI extension.\nIf you need your site to work with Internet Explorer on XP, see if you can remove the references to this other SSL host running on the same IP address from your Apache configuration.\n\nA: The \"snakeoil\" certificate is automatically generated when the ssl-cert package is installed.\nIt is a self signed certificate, so revoking it doesn't make much sense.  You can easily generate a new one though:\nsudo make-ssl-cert generate-default-snakeoil --force-overwrite\n\nYou will probably have to restart any service that was making use of that certificate for the change to take effect.\nWhen you say that Windows XP keeps on using the certificate, what do you mean exactly though?  If you had told your web browser on that computer to trust the particular snakeoil certificate generated by your Ubuntu system, it should be a simple matter to revoke that trust in the browser's certificate management interface.\n", "Q: Can't register for addons or plugins I have Gimp 2.6\nI would like to add plugins to my program.\nI went to Gimp Plugin Registry.\nI entered all the information requested.\nI spent at least half an hour of frustration trying to persuade the website to accept my email address.

Have a folder shared with samba on the internal drive that can be accessed, however, when sharing the entire external or just a folder on it I get the \"You do not have permission to access\" error on the Windows clients. \nWhen sharing on Ubuntu I go to properties, share and then tick share, allow others to write as well as guest access. Clicking create share then says it will have to set the permissions and I let it. It's not accessible. When trying to set permissions manually in the Permissions tab it doesn't let me choose anything, when choosing Read and Write for \"other\" users it reverts back to nothing as soon as it's chosen.\nI've tried creating a symlink from the mount point to within the home directory and sharing that, even getting chmod to change the permissions so they're viewable in ls -la, but it still isn't accessible. Is there something really simple I'm missing here like externals not being easily shared? Thinking I might have to crack it open and stuff it inside the server. Oh and the external is NTFS, if that would make a difference.\n\nA: Try sudo chmod -R 755 <path of external drive> and see if that fixes the permissions error. (Warning, this will give everyone read-write-execute access to everything on the drive). \nIf that doesn't work...\nMake sure the external has a real mountpoint like /external or /shared-stuff.  \nIf it is mounted to the temporary location (which is default behavior), samba might be looking at an old temporary location, get a read error, which is passes on as a permissions error to the windows client. \nIf that doesn't work, it is probably because the drive is ntfs. NTFS permissions are stored in a way that don't make sense to linux, and probably not to samba either. It would be good to use a native linux format, but that requires moving the data off and reformatting the drive, and copying the data back. \n\nA: I agree with Owen on the NTFS guess.  Here's how I got samba sharing to play nicely with anonymous shares completely from the gui(I've done it cli too with workarounds that were a pain).  This way is easy I promise:\nIn Dash: Type Software Center\nIn the search box type \"Samba\" then install \"Samba\".\nIn Dash: Type Samba\nEnter your password.\nIn the GUI that opens up choose \"Preferences\" menu -> \"Server Settings\" then the \"Security\" tab change the authentication mode to share and the guest account to your user name account.\nChoose the \"Add a Samba Share\"; the green plus icon; browse to the directory you wish to share.\nPlace a check mark in \"Writable\" and \"Visible\".\nThen on the \"Access\" tab choose \"Allow access to everyone\".\nPress OK\nVerified sharing an NTFS partition, anonymous, all access for me on 11.10 using only the gui.  It also works with mountpoints in media.\nHope it helps.\nI bolded the part that I think is goofing up on you.\nMostly from here.\n\nA: I had the same issue with NTFS permissions and a network share.\nForcing my Ubuntu admin account as the user under the share settings through Webmin I was able to connect with no problem.\n\nA: I suggest you to manage your shares through webmin interface. its's simple and easy to use.\nhttp://www.webmin.com\n", "Q: How to open and run terminal and install driver for Broadcom 802.g wireleiss I'm new to Ubuntu and can't find a way to just open and execute the driver.

The PAM rules always kicked in, even when using   sudo passwd\nChanges on the /etc/pam.d/common-password resulted in passwd failing alltogether due to 'manipulation error'.\nMy solution to it was to set the password on another machine on which I also have root access, then copy/paste the hashed value from the /etc/shadow from that machine to the other simply using    sudo vi /etc/shadow  . The strict PAM did not block that, and it works.

I found that if I have Aptana Studio running on one virutal desktop, switch to another one and back to the first, sometimes Aptana doesn't get the (keyboard) focus back properly. I haven't experienced the problem in Eclipse so far, but I assume that it could happen there as well.

However, any new data may end up overwriting the old, so the first thing you should do is unmount the drive to make sure nothing can be written to it.\nIf the data is important to you, your best bet is to contact a professional. You may be able to recover it by yourself, but doing so is risky at best.\nIf you do try it yourself, there are numerous tools available. One way is to boot into a live CD and use GParted to attempt to recover the deleted partition table. First choose the drive you wish to perform the data recovery on, then go to 'Device > Attempt Data Rescue'.\n\nA: *\n\n*ubuntu rescue remix\nit is livecd for recoveringdata\n\n\n*testdisk\n\nTestDisk is powerful free data recovery software! It was primarily\n  designed to help recover lost partitions and/or make non-booting disks\n  bootable again when these symptoms are caused by faulty software,\n  certain types of viruses or human error (such as accidentally deleting\n  a Partition Table).

I've used it in the past and have had great success with it.  You may have to install it from apt-get or synaptic though.\nFortunately, you're given the option of what types of files you wish to recover and for the most part, it really does a good job. The only negative complaint I have about it is that it takes again as much space as the files you're trying to recover and stores the recovered files in several smaller folders -without- their original names. So, let's say for instance, you're recovering all your .gif files, you'll have to look at each file separately, to identify it. Then of course, you can cut 'n' paste to where ever you wish to keep 'em.\nAnother 'negative' as I can see it, is that it also uses as much space for recovery as the original files sizes, so if you're hurting for available HD space, it's gonna be a bit dicey at best. But with that said, I've successfully recovered my .avi files, .gif, .jpg, .png, text documents, etc. However, if you've reformatted your HD, you may still be out of luck.\nAnother option is in using Parted Magic and is bootable from a CD rom or USB stick. It too, has a data recovery mode but I've not used it so far. However, if that works like everything else included on the disk, it can be a life saver for recovering files from a trashed OS. I'm currently in a situation where I had a Linux upgrade fail and thanks to some spare HD space on other HD's, I've been able to recover and transfer all my critical files to them, so I'm left with a completely clean HD to work with.  When he new OS is set up and operating correctly, I'll just transfer my stuff back to it.\nPartMagic will work for several different OS's and I think everyone who owns a computer should have a copy of it, since it's a free program. Just take the time to explore it fully once you have a copy so that you'll know what it's capable of doing for you. It really is, in my opinion, an outstanding compilation of software.   \nGood luck with your recovery.\n\nA: I had the same problem. But Testdisk was able to restore a partition I've formatted after choosing a clean install in Ubuntu 13.10 installation wizard. I've forgotten that Ubuntu wouldn't use the partition that I used to have Ubuntu 13.04 installed to make a clean install... it uses the whole HD (I had a second data partition that I didn't want to format). \nThe most up voted answer here helped me: How to recover Deleted Files and Folders?\nThis answer recommends this tutorial: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EncqYP1ijFg&feature=player_embedded\nBut, differently from the links above, I needed to use Testdisk's Deeper Search (it takes a long time) and the option P (list files) to be able to write partition structure to disk. I've tried firstly without this P option and it hasn't worked out.\nAfter writing the partition structure to disk, quitting Testdisk and rebooting, I've got my partition exactly as it used to be before.\nIt's good to say that my HD was plugged in another PC using a SATA to USB adapter, but I could have booted using a Ubuntu USB stick to be able to do the same. (You'd better not to use your mistakenly installed Ubuntu to run Testdisk.)\nAnd you'd better not to add any new files to your disk before recovering the lost partition, or you may lose your files forever.\nSo, Testdisk has worked out even if I had mistakenly installed a new Ubuntu and swap partition.\n", "Q: Ugly boot ubuntu 11.10 with NVidia Graphics card Is there a way to fix the ugly boot when using NVidia and Ubuntu 11.10?\nI fixed the issues when I was using 10.10 but 11.10 the same fix just trashes the system.\nThanks\n\nA: NVidia drivers PPA, and upgrade:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nvidia-current nvidia-settings\nConfiguring The Right Driver\nThe next thing to do is to make sure that your machine uses the correct driver.

Ubuntu recognizes the device, but does not automatically use it. In order to get PulseAudio to use it for output, I have to manually choose it in the 'Output' tab in 'Sound settings'.\nI would like PulseAudio to always prefer an external device over the internal, if one is available. Is there a way to accomplish this?\n\nA: In theory, this should be handled by 'PulseAudio Volume Control'. There is a button to select a device as the default device, though imho poorly titled as 'Set as fallback'. More info about this feature here: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Oneiric_Hardware\nUnfortunately the feature doesn't work. As soon as a USB audio device is unplugged the setting as default device is annoyingly forgotten, despite the fact that all the other settings such as volume, balance, etc. are retained next time the device is plugged in. In your case, if the device is not being removed this feature may actually work for you. If you are missing the app, just install the package 'pavucontrol'\nI use a USB headset for calling and had to make a script using 'pacmd' to enable or disable it as needed to avoid going through the GUI, This allowed me to to just add a few launcher items to switch back and forth as needed. In my case, my script to enable the headset is:\n#!/bin/bash\npacmd \"set-default-sink alsa_output.usb-Logitech_Logitech_USB_Headset-00-Headset.analog-stereo\"\npacmd \"set-default-source alsa_input.usb-Logitech_Logitech_USB_Headset-00-Headset.analog-mono\"\n\nAnd to revert to my internal audio:\n#!/bin/bash\npacmd \"set-default-sink alsa_output.usb-Logitech_Logitech_USB_Headset-00-Headset.analog-stereo\"\npacmd \"set-default-source alsa_input.usb-Logitech_Logitech_USB_Headset-00-Headset.analog-mono\"\n\n'pacmd' is fairly easy to use, just run it from terminal and enter 'help' for more info.\n\nA: Also of use, is loading the module module-switch-on-connect.

I'm using GIMP 2.6.12.\nWhen I'm done editing an image and want to close Gimp, I have to do the process twice.\nThe first closure will close the open image file. After that, GIMP remains open but in a state of \"not open any file\". Then I must press the \"close\" or use the pull down menu to completely exit from GIMP.\nIs this normal or can I change this?\n\nA: It's normal. From the GIMP documentation:\n\n2.14. Close\nThe Close command closes the active image. If the image is not in the\n  main window, then the window is closed also. If the image is in the\n  main window, the image is closed but the window remains, empty.\n\nEmphasis mine.\n\nA: The behavior you want is now available in Gimp 2.8 by using single-window mode.\nFrom the menu: Windows > Single-window mode\n\nA: It's abnormal, but it is indeed how the GIMP functions. It's not like the same window remains open, BTW, more like it opens a new empty window. In a way it's the equally absurd reverse from Windows, where clicking the Start button was needed to close it; here clicking the close gadget opens a window.\nThe developers consider this bug a feature, so it's unlikely to ever get fixed.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                    Mysha\n", "Q: How to setup an alias for local facing interface I'm trying to set an alias for an interface facing local network, but when i try to bring it up I receive this error:\nRTNETLINK answers: File exists\nFailed to bring up eth1:0.\n\nHere is my /etc/network/interfaces\n    # Loopback device:\n    auto lo\n    iface lo inet loopback\n# device: eth0\nauto  eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n  address   X.X.X.X\n  broadcast X.X.X.X\n  netmask   255.255.255.0\n  gateway   X.X.X.1\n\n# device: eth1\nauto  eth1\niface eth1 inet static\n  address   10.0.0.1\n  netmask   255.255.252.0\n\n# device: eth1:0\nauto  eth1:0\niface eth1:0 inet static\n  address   10.0.0.2\n  netmask   255.255.252.0\n\n# default route to access subnet\nup route add -net X.X.X.X netmask 255.255.255.0 gw X.X.X.1 eth0\n\n\nA: The \"file\" that \"already exists\" is the default route (gateway).\nifup will fail because it will try to add a default route that already exists for the base adapter.

I'd be careful about when to use it though. Killing apt-get during a package installation could mess things up, so I suggest only running the download part with timeout.

The ~ on my new system has full home encryption from ecryptfs. I want to decrypt the Private on the old home and copy its now-decrypted contents to the new home.\nI actually have the ~/.Private and ~/.ecryptfs from the old system on my new system as well. I tried mounting it from there before, but it's not possible. I've confirmed with Dustin Kirkland (ecryptfs developer) that you can't have an encrypted home AND an encrypted private in use at the same time.\nI tried mounting the backup drive over /home and running and ecryptfs-mount-private and entering my login password (same on old system and new), but ~/Private wasn't decrypted.\n\nA: The best way to recover is by using the ecryptfs-recover-private utility from a LiveISO.\nI say that because this will ensure that your recovery happens in a safe, repeatable, read-only environment.\nThat said, you certainly can run ecryptfs-recover-private on a running system.  But I'd strongly recommend that you log out all instances of the user you're trying to recover, and then login as root or some other user.\n\nA: I haven't tested it, but I don't see why doing something like:  \nLog out.  Come back in as another user and become root.  As root switch out the Private and ecryptfs folders(backing the new ones up).  \nSwitch back to the one that now has your old directory and get it mounted.  \n(only mention switching back and forth since in a lot of cases you may have the same username/password...you could do this as user number 2)  \nCopy everything to intermediate storage that is not encrypted with ecryptfs, but could be with dm-crypt or whatever other solution, probably in /opt/dump or something similar.  \nBack to user 2.  Now you switch the two folders back.  \nCopy your temporary location data back to your home.  \nUse srm or whatever to remove your intermediate storage location.  \n", "Q: Does the guided encrypted LVM option encrypt swap on 11.10? After a bit of googling I still haven't managed to find a clear answer to this. If you use the guided encrypted LVM install option from the Ubuntu 11.10 Alternate cd (I think it's option 3), does it encrypt the swap partition automatically, as well as home? Leaving only the boot loader unencrypted? Or do I have to follow the various guides for older versions of Ubuntu for manually creating and encrypting swap and home partitions?\nThanks a lot!\n\nA: If you use the guided option , everything but /boot will be encrypted.\nHow it works is that you have a series of containers. First is a physical partition. Within the partition is a crypt (LUKS) container. Within the LUKS you use LVM to divide the crypt into / and swap.\nIf you manually partition , make sure /home is also within the LUKS crypt / LVM.\nSo if you manually partition, you first make a LUKS crypt. Then within the crypt you use LVM to make / , swap, and if you so desire /home, but, with LUKS it makes less sense to have a separate /home as you can not as easily preserve an encrypted /home if you re-install. It is not impossible to do, just a few steps more difficult. \n", "Q: How do I copy a specific number of directories with rsync?

I understand that the answer may already be out there.  If so, could someone please point me in the right direction.  And if not, could someone please resolve (if possible) my situation!\n\nA: For those who are still looking for an answer:\nIf your HDD is \"bricked\" and cannot be mounted properly, there are some things to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*make an image, if you have the space.\nOperating on an image file won't damage the data on your harddisk, in case you make mistakes and destroy your data.\n\n*if you still can mount your partitions, mount it read-only. \nAlter the mount command like so: mount -o ro /dev/sdb1 /mnt/targetfolder\n\n*If you cannot mount your harddisk's partitions, try extundelete or testdisk: \nsudo apt-get install testdisk extundelete. Then, run cd <recovery-dir>; sudo extundelete /dev/sdb1 or sudo testdisk /dev/sdb1 and follow the instructions to recover your data.\nI successfully recovered data from a overridden raid 1 drive, so I can really recommend these tools.\n\nA: It is likely the filesystem is hfs which is Mac OSX only and Ubuntu has issues reading and writing to, I would try and resolve the issue from within Mac OSX rather than Ubuntu.\nI add the following as information only  having just read an article listing the steps to recover from a bad superblock on an ext4 drive.\nTry the folowing:\n\nSo, how can you recover a bad superblock? Fortunately for us, backup\n  copies of the superblock are kept at certain offsets on the disk. To\n  find out where the superblock backups are, open a terminal window and\n  type:\nsudo mke2fs -n /dev/????\nWhere ???? is the partition you want to check, which in my case was\n  sdb3. This produces output, like the following:\nSuperblock backups stored on blocks: 32768, 98304, 163840, 229376,\n  294912, 819200, 884736, 1605632, 2654208, 4096000, 7962624, 11239424,\n  20480000, 23887872\nThese are block numbers, signifying the location of the superblock\n  backups.\nTo replace the superblock with one from a backup, type the following:\nsudo e2fsck -y -b block_location /dev/????\nReplace block_location with one of the above numbers and, again, ????\n  is the partition, so in my case it was sdb3.\nThere was significant corruption on my hard drive, but supplying the\n  -y switch stopped fsck asking for confirmation every time it encountered a bad block.\nAfter running this, I was able to mount the partition and recover my\n  data.\n\nReference\n\nA: I had a problem where my mybook live 2tb drive suddenly stopped working. To be honest, I was using it as a portable drive and was storing it away. When I took it out and plugged it back in to do a backup, the light when from blue to white to red and I tried everything in order to get it working. Everything the support site said and about 4 hours of messing around on the Internet reading all these forums and trying everything suggested. Here is what I learned:\nSolution: (I'm previously computer literate but less so now as I'm older and have wasted enough of my life with this crap)\nWhatever file system this is it is not Linux native ext2 or 3 or whatever, it is mac. It WILL NOT mount under Ubuntu, which is what I'm running and will continually give all these errors. when you access it eventually you will see all kind of .apple files. \nEasy fix. Open up your piece of junk WD mybook drive, pull it out, undo the nic card, buy the SATA to usb adapter cord or the docking port from best buy, take it to a friends house that has a windows system, use the Linux file system reader from http://www.diskinternals.com/linux-reader/\ninstall that, plug in the drive, when windows wants to format it hit CANCEL and run that program and voila there your files are. \n", "Q: How are files created? I want to know what the major differences are between Windows and Linux file creation.\nLet's say I'm in a terminal session and I type: touch file. What happens behind the scenes in Linux? What is the process in the operating system?\n\nA: In Linux when you make a file:\n\n\n*\n\n*An inode is generated. This is a descriptor that points to data blocks on the disk that also stores information like ownership, permissions, etc.\n\n*A hardlink to that inode is created. This is essentially the \"filename\" and where it sits in the rest of the filesystem.\n\n\nIt can be a confusing concept at first to get your brain around but it's quite simple. Inodes are there as sign posts to the actual data but in order to use any of that you need the hardlinks to show the structure of the filesystem.\nThis allows you to have multiple hardlinks to one inode, for example, as long as they're both on the same partition.\n\nIn Windows (and this may become untrue as Microsoft evolve their filesystems) the inode and hardlink are not separate, they are one and the same. This means when you create the file it just creates this block.\nObvious side effects are that multiple-hardlinks don't exist but it's more than that - you often can't delete a file (which would be just removing the hardlink in Linux) that is locked for opening (which would be handled by inode data in Linux).\nBut other than that (fairly major) difference, they're quite similar.\nTurns out that Since Vista, NTFS works very much like common Linux filesystems. It supports both hard and soft links suggesting they have an inode-like object between data and path.\nIn short: There isn't much difference these days. On older versions of Windows than Vista, my scrubbed answer above carries.\n", "Q: Why x64 bit version is way more faster than x32? Lately I noticed that my old laptop (Toshiba Satellite L500-1DT) works better with x64 based Ubuntu version, than x32. Well with faster I meant - Adobe Flash videos and apps works much better. Software Center and APT apps works much smoothly. Everything works flawless on x64. Cooling fan works a lot less (not cooling the system all the time, like on x32). On x32 bit version I had a feeling, that my computer will overheat. 2 weeks ago my battery died when I ran x32 version. I don't know, is it was because of overheating or coincidence. It got REALLY hot, and very very slow. I'm running on Celeron(R) Dual-Core CPU T3000 @ 1.80GHz × 2 and Intel GMA45 video chip-set (with 256mb shared memory). RAM - 4 GB. Ubuntu 11.10.\nThis is not the only case and only machine i discovered that x64 works FAR more better, than so-called \"Recommended 32-bit version\". I'm really curious about this, and would like to know answer once for all. \nPlease, explain this to me or guide me with a link. \nThank you !\n\nA: Uh, \"twice as fast if not more depending on the hardware it runs on\"?? Ah, if only the world worked this way.\nFor example, take a look at this article: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS: 32-bit vs. 64-bit Performance. \nWhile some of the synthetic benchmarks show drastic performance gains, there are also many which show either just minor (10% to 30%) gains, no gains, or even a performance decrease. And those are just synthetic benchmarks which usually does not give useful insight into what the system performance will be when doing something other than running benchmarks.\nSystem performance is very much influenced by \"system\" bottlenecks and you can't make sweeping generalizations such as twice the bits implies twice the performance.\nHaving said that, I still try to use the 64-bit flavors of operating systems because I expect the performance to be at least somewhat better.  While the size of the CPU registers is doubled, possible of more importance is that the number of registers increases from eight in x86 to sixteen in x86_64 64-bit mode. This allows a compiler to potentially produce faster code. There are a number of these instruction tweaks which, while probably insignificant in any one instance can add up when used system wide to a useful performance gain.\nThere is also little if any performance loss for programs compiled for 32-bit x86 since they can be run in \"compatibility mode\".\nPeople often make the generalization that if you only have 4GB or less of memory then there is no difference between 32-bit and 64-bit and thus no reason to use the 64-bit version. This is simply not true. The instruction architecture of the CPU is different enough (IMO) in 64-bit mode to prefer using the 64-bit OS if your hardware supports it.\nAfter all, you wouldn't want to run your 32-bit CPU in 16-bit mode, would you? :-)\n\nA: In short: more operational registers are available in x86_64 mode comparing to x86. Also, there's confusingly named x32 ABI which isn't x86(_32) but rather mix of x86_64 and pure x86. And, BTW, the article I gave you link to has good explanation why x86_64 is tend to have higher performance.\n\nA: Such an extreme difference is not typical and not really related to any general advantages of 64-bit mode. \nI suspect you're seeing either some kind of bug related to your hardware, or a bug in your device's firmware that's triggered by Ubuntu's 32-bit kernel.\n\nA: 64-bit OS operate twice as fast if not more depending on the hardware it runs on. Going from 32-bit to 64-bit increases the OS's ability to process larger chunks of data. Therefore it operates much faster. Also, 64-bit OS will use more memory than a 32-bit OS. A 64-bit register can store 264 = 18446744073709551616 different values, a number in excess of 18 quintillion. At the moment x86-64 processors use 48 physical address lines; therefore a processor with 64-bit memory addresses can directly access 264 terabytes of byte-addressable memory.\n", "Q: \"Packages have unmet dependencies\" while installing Gimp 2.7.5 on Ubuntu 11.10 I have been trying to install Gimp 2.7.5 for a few days now, but keep getting this message:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n\ngimp: Depends: python-gtk2 (>= 2.8.0) but 2.24.0-2 is to be installed\n      Depends: libc6 (>= 2.11) but 2.13-20ubuntu5.1 is to be installed\n      Depends: libfontconfig1 (>= 2.8.0) but 2.8.0-3ubuntu2 is to be installed\n      Depends: libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 (>= 2.22.0) but 2.24.0-1ubuntu1 is to be installed\n      Depends: libglib2.0-0 (>= 2.31.2) but 2.30.0-0ubuntu4 is to be installed\n      Depends: libgs9 (>= 8.61.dfsg.1) but 9.04~dfsg-0ubuntu11.5 is to be installed\n      Depends: libgtk2.0-0 (>= 2.24.0) but 2.24.6-0ubuntu5 is to be installed\n      Depends: libgudev-1.0-0 (>= 147) but 1:173-0ubuntu4.1 is to be installed\n      Depends: libjpeg62 (>= 6b1) but 6b1-1ubuntu2 is to be installed\n      Depends: librsvg2-2 (>= 2.14.4) but 2.34.1-2 is to be installed\n      Depends: zlib1g (>= 1:1.1.4) but 1:1.2.3.4.dfsg-3ubuntu3 is to be installed\n\nWhere would I get the things the program wants, and how?\n\nA: In the meantime(I assume Gimp 2.6 is now uninstallable, I've also had this problem), you can try and use GIMP 2.74.

Here it goes,\nI have a laptop with an Nvidia GT520M card and I am running ubuntu 11.10. When I first installed ubuntu on my pc, I was able to use gnome3 and all was well (I suppose my laptop was using the intel card instead of the Nvidia one). \nBecause I wanted to develop some things in CUDA from my own machine, I started to look around on what I could do, so that I could use the discrete card just for CUDA and leave the other one to handle gnome. By installing nvidia's current drivers and bumblebee, I am now able to run programs in CUDA using optirun but my machine uses the simple version of gnome, without any effects whatsoever. Of course, when I removed nvidia's drivers, optirun couldn't run CUDA programs and stopped with : \n[ERROR]Cannot access secondary GPU - error: [XORG] (EE) Failed to load module \"nouveau\" (module does not exist, 0)\n\nIs there something I can do so that I can have both worlds? \n\nA: Getting both cards to work is highly  problematic as stated in this question with 4000 views.

So, just to make it plain for everyone who might be interested. My system is an optimus laptop with an NVidia 520M card. What I wanted to do was to have both a moderate hardware acceleration for gnome and to be able to run CUDA. \nHere's what I did.\n\n\n*\n\n*After a fresh install of ubuntu 12.04, I downloaded from here the 32bit version of the toolkit and the SDK but not the drivers (last time that I tried to do something with them, I got either a corrupted X or a not so functional desktop). \n\n*Then I installed bumblebee, so that I could run my programs on the discrete card.\n\n*Installed the toolkit.\n\n*Included the two lines to .bashrc \nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda/bin\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/lib\n\n\n*Run sudo ldconfig\n\n*And last but not least, logout and login. \nNow you should be able to compile your programs with nvcc and run them via optirun. \nHope that helps. As you can see, it's actually pretty straightforward. I don't know why I didn't do it this way when I had an 11.10 system though. \n\nA: By default it will probably be using both the CPU and Nvidia, in 13.10 and older.\nHowever, as you can see here, better support for second video card (Optimus) is coming in 14.04.\nRather than tweak the current setup it may be better to try the beta/RC in a month or two.\n", "Q: Release upgrade crashes with \"W:Failed to fetch http://host/debian/dists/oneiric/Release.gpg\" My update manager told me that it has not checked for updates in the past 18 days, so I clicked the \"check\" button.

Now I know that if I go to the terminal and use the command \"sensors\" it will show me the temperature. During basic browsing (like now), the temperature is about 50-60 C, but that's after I updated my Dell's BIOS, downloaded Jupiter, Powertop, laptop_mode_tools, lm-sensors, all the dell kernel modules, and enabled Intel i916 RC6. Before all that, the temperature was around 70-84 C. Yes, I know that's pretty impressive but when I ever open a vid/file it goes up to 70 something C and when I turn on Runescape (I don't play it, I just make scripts for it) it soars sky-high to 80-100. So I was wondering (I know theirs nothing else I can do to improve the temperature except to buy a cooling pad) if the temperature goes up to 80-90 C, could that possibly damage the internal systems (CPU,Motherboard,Hard Drive,Fan,Etc.)  permanently or so badly that they need to be replaced?

My printer ran out of black ink, but the color cartridge still has a lot of ink. I want to print using only ink from the color cartridge. I used to be able to do this using advanced printer settings of the printer driver in Windows 7. I was wondering if and how it can be done using Ubuntu.

Normally I would copy and paste and try to edit the image so that I could easily change the font color and boom it would automatically print in that color HOWEVER because this was a copied image, every time I clicked on it, it just allowed me to move the image etc but not change the preset black color. HOW FRUSTRATING. So using the LibreOffice app for Mac I pasted the image and did the following so that it would change the color.\nThere is a little paint drop looking icon on the top far right of the toolbar. I simply clicked that and a window popped up and it allows you to change the color of everything in the image. You can adjust the brightness and shading as well as the individual colors of red, green and blue. \nViola, within seconds I had my image color changed so it used my color cartridge only. \nNot sure if this is useful to anyone else but thought I would throw it out there.\n", "Q: Running 32-bit sun-jdk in 64-bit Ubuntu I need to run 32bit sun-jdk on my 64bit ubuntu.

We want to rule them out one at a time.\nOn the Server\nTo increase the logging on the server set the following line in your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file;\n\nLogLevel DEBUG\n\nThere's also a DEBUG2 and DEBUG3 to get even more information sent to the logs.\nTo monitor the logs, use the command tail -f /var/log/auth.log\nOn the Client\nYou can add verbosity to your client connection with a -v option.\n\nssh -v me@myserver.com\n\nThere is also a -vv and -vvv to increase the verbosity of the output\nSpotting the Error\nSet your log monitoring going on the server with the above command and then try connecting to it from the client using a verbosity level also above.  Now, carefully check the outputs from each and look for could not's, Permission denied's, no such identity:'s or Incorrect RSA1 identifier's etc. These are most likely the problem if your in a similar position to me.\nCommon Pitfalls\nPermissions - Client Side\nThe certificates and known_hosts (usually found within ~.ssh) all need to be readable by the user. In the simplest instant, id_rsa, id_rsa.pub and knwon_hosts should be owned by and in your user group and should be readable by the user, below is the 'default' setup.\n\n-rw------- username username id_rsa\n-rw-r--r-- username username id_rsa.pub\n-rw-r--r-- username username known_hosts\n\nPermissions - Server Side\nAgain, the certificates and this time the authorized_keys files must be readable by the user being logged in.  Defaults as shown below:\n\n-rw------- username username authorized_keys\n-rw-r--r-- username username id_rsa\n\nEncrypted Drives/Directories\nSSH on the server needs to be able to see/read the authorized_keys file and associated server certificates; therefore if they are on an encrypted device then a session must be live for the device to be readable by the daemon.  This is often seen when you can login via password and whilst that session is live, you can then login via authorised keys and no password.\n", "Q: Where I can download the Wubi installer for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS?

Let me know if more in needed.\nCurrently when I run\njockey-text --list | grep nvidia\n\nit returns the following\nkmod:nvidia_current - nvidia_current (Proprietary, Enabled, Not in use)\nkmod:nvidia_current_updates - NVIDIA binary Xorg driver, kernel module and VDPAU library (Proprietary, Disabled, Not in use)\n\nAlso I can run \nmodinfo nvidia_current\n\nand I see the following\nfilename:       /lib/modules/3.0.0-16-generic/updates/dkms/nvidia_current.ko\nalias:          char-major-195-*\nversion:        295.20\nsupported:      external\nlicense:        NVIDIA\nalias:          pci:v000010DEd00000E00sv*sd*bc04sc80i00*\nalias:          pci:v000010DEd00000AA3sv*sd*bc0Bsc40i00*\nalias:          pci:v000010DEd*sv*sd*bc03sc02i00*\nalias:          pci:v000010DEd*sv*sd*bc03sc00i00*\ndepends:\nvermagic:       3.0.0-16-generic SMP mod_unload modversions 686\nparm:           NVreg_EnableVia4x:int\nparm:           NVreg_EnableALiAGP:int\nparm:           NVreg_ReqAGPRate:int\nparm:           NVreg_EnableAGPSBA:int\nparm:           NVreg_EnableAGPFW:int\nparm:           NVreg_Mobile:int\nparm:           NVreg_ResmanDebugLevel:int\nparm:           NVreg_RmLogonRC:int\nparm:           NVreg_ModifyDeviceFiles:int\nparm:           NVreg_DeviceFileUID:int\nparm:           NVreg_DeviceFileGID:int\nparm:           NVreg_DeviceFileMode:int\nparm:           NVreg_RemapLimit:int\nparm:           NVreg_UpdateMemoryTypes:int\nparm:           NVreg_InitializeSystemMemoryAllocations:int\nparm:           NVreg_UseVBios:int\nparm:           NVreg_RMEdgeIntrCheck:int\nparm:           NVreg_UsePageAttributeTable:int\nparm:           NVreg_EnableMSI:int\nparm:           NVreg_MapRegistersEarly:int\nparm:           NVreg_RegisterForACPIEvents:int\nparm:           NVreg_RegistryDwords:charp\nparm:           NVreg_RmMsg:charp\nparm:           NVreg_NvAGP:int\n\nMy xorg.conf looks like \nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"X.org Configured\"\n    Screen      0  \"Screen1\" 0 0\n    InputDevice    \"Mouse0\" \"CorePointer\"\n    InputDevice    \"Keyboard0\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Files\"\n    ModulePath   \"/usr/lib/xorg/modules\"\n    FontPath     \"/usr/share/fonts/X11/misc\"\n    FontPath     \"/usr/share/fonts/X11/cyrillic\"\n    FontPath     \"/usr/share/fonts/X11/100dpi/:unscaled\"\n    FontPath     \"/usr/share/fonts/X11/75dpi/:unscaled\"\n    FontPath     \"/usr/share/fonts/X11/Type1\"\n    FontPath     \"/usr/share/fonts/X11/100dpi\"\n    FontPath     \"/usr/share/fonts/X11/75dpi\"\n    FontPath     \"/var/lib/defoma/x-ttcidfont-conf.d/dirs/TrueType\"\n    FontPath     \"built-ins\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Module\"\n    Load  \"record\"\n    Load  \"dri\"\n    Load  \"glx\"\n    Load  \"extmod\"\n    Load  \"dbe\"\n    Load  \"dri2\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    Identifier  \"Keyboard0\"\n    Driver      \"kbd\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    Identifier  \"Mouse0\"\n    Driver      \"mouse\"\n    Option      \"Protocol\" \"auto\"\n    Option      \"Device\" \"/dev/input/mice\"\n    Option      \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5 6 7\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier   \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName   \"Monitor Vendor\"\n    ModelName    \"Monitor Model\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier   \"Monitor1\"\n    VendorName   \"Monitor Vendor\"\n    ModelName    \"Monitor Model\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n        ### Available Driver options are:-\n        ### Values: <i>: integer, <f>: float, <bool>: \"True\"/\"False\",\n        ### <string>: \"String\", <freq>: \"<f> Hz/kHz/MHz\",\n        ### <percent>: \"<f>%\"\n        ### [arg]: arg optional\n        #Option     \"DRI\"                   #

The problem involves the fact that Ubuntu mounts the device as owned by root, but the nut daemon drops to an unprivileged account that doesn't have the necessary access.  The simple fix is to use udev to adjust the device permissions. \nConnect the device and (as root) run lsusb and locate it.  Note the Bus and Device IDs as well as the Vendor:Product ID pair....\"\nusing output as in above answer:\n$ lsusb\nBus 002 Device 004: ID 051d:0002 American Power Conversion Uninterruptible Power Supply   \n\nagain from the link \"... You can create a udev rule that controls the mount behavior at boot: ...\" (edited to match this scenario better)\"\n\n\n*\n\n*use your favourite text editor to make (most likely) a new udev rules.d file. The number must be higher than any other udev.d rules file for the same action:\n\n\nfor example\nsudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/90-nut-ups.rules\n\n# /etc/udev/rules.d/90-nut-ups.rules\nACTION==\"add\", \\\nSUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", \\\nATTR{idVendor}==\"051d\", ATTR{idProduct}==\"0002\", \\\nMODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"nut\"\n\nThe rule watches for USB device additions with a vendor and product that match the UPS.  It then sets the mode to 0660 and the group to nut instead of the default root.  \nNote that this answer uses 660 permission rather than 666 since that should be sufficient and more secure.\nReload udev (reboot, or perhaps unplugging then re plugging the usb cable from the UPS at the pc port), then disconnect and reconnect the device and test that the new permissions are correct. I an unclear on this part. In any case, once the nut user group has read and write on the device, it should be able to start successfully.\nThe udev rules.d edit did work on my 12.04.2 system even when I moved the USB cable to a different port, resulting in different Bus Device numbers on the lsusb output. Udev handled all without intervention. In fact, I may not have had to reboot when I moved it but can't remember for sure and will leave that testing to someone else. \n\nA: As ndemou said, the NUT FAQ is aware of the problem, and a patch as been released, correcting the bug. But old stable distros could be affected. Hopefully, the solution is very simple...\nFrom the NUT FAQ : \"My USB UPS is supported but doesn’t work!\" :\n\nOn Linux, udev rules are provided to set the correct permissions on\n  device file. This allows the NUT driver to communicate with the UPS,\n  through this device file.\nHowever, the driver may still fail to start and support the device,\n  with a message like:\nfailed to claim USB device: could not claim interface 0: Operation not\n  permitted\nOperation not permitted is a message pointing to a privilege issue.\n  The most frequent issue is that udev has not actually applied the\n  rule:\nif NUT has been freshly installed,\nand if the device USB cord was already plugged when installing NUT. \n\nIn this case, just unplug and plug back the USB cord, then restart\n  NUT.\nThere was a mistake in the naming of the NUT udev rules file which\n  resulted in the rules being overridden by another udev configuration\n  file. While this has been fixed in the Git master branch, your\n  distribution may still be affected. Details are available in the\n  following Github issue:\n  https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/140\n\nLooking further to the Github issue give me the solution :\n\nudev rules are applied too late (priority 52), resulting in nut\n  privileges being overwritten. The final result is that the driver\n  doesn't start, and connection failure to the driver / UPS are reported\n  by upsd and upsmon.\nThe fix is simply to set priority to 62 by renaming the rules file: \n$ mv /lib/udev/rules.d/{5,6}2-nut-usbups.rules\nThis bug affects:\nDebian: http://bugs.debian.org/721600\nFedora / Redhat: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=488368\nUbuntu: https://bugs.launchpad.net/debian/+source/nut/+bug/1099947 and probably all Linux distribution\n\n\n\nA: If you are away from the USB cord of your UPS (plugging the fresh new UPS and doing the config months later because you lack time), and restarting your machine is not an option, you can retrigger the udev rules: \nudevadm control --reload\nudevadm trigger\nsystemctl restart nut-server\n\nDoes the job.\n", "Q: How to update ClamAV definitions database?

If you click the user image there you'll be offered the opportunity to select a new image.\n\nA: It looks like the login manager (GDM) profile image but since you do not explain what version of Ubuntu or GNOME one can only assume.\nThe ~/.face file is an image file used by GNOME by some functions in the system as, for example, the display picture for GDM, the users profile in the System Settings, etc.\n", "Q: Open mbox File? How to open a mbox file? Mutt displays no mails when calling mutt -f sent.mbox.\nThe mbox format is \"From\" without colon.\nIs there any mbox viewer for Linux?\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: In thunderbird you can open the file by placing it in thunderbirds local profile folder, under $HOME/.thunderbird/<profilename>.default/Mail/Local Folders/ An .mbox file there will be picked up by Thunderbird and displayed. See also the detailed instructions linked by prashanth in a different comment.\n\nA: Any text editor is capable of opening .mbox. Besides text editors Mozilla Thunderbird can open them too.\n\nA: The first line of the mail is the “envelope From line”. It begins with the 5 characters From␣ where ␣ is a space character. This is normal.\nFrom Christian xxx <cg@xxx> Mon May  15 20:22:35 2010\n\nWhat is unusual is that the email address is between <…>. This is unusual. I don't know if it's against the RFCs or not, but I can see Mutt chokes on it.\nYou should get a valid mailbox (as in, one that Mutt can parse) by processing the mailbox file through the formail command from procmail .\nformail -ds sed '1 s/^From .* <\\(.*\\)>/From \\1/' <sent.mbox >sent-reformatted.mbox\nmutt -f sent-reformatted.mbox\n\n\nA: After a bit of nightmare on Windows with Firefox, where the .mbox gets open but only the first message is available, I found that Evolution works well: I created a new folder and then from File\\Import... (I'm from Italy, the menu it's actually Importa...) I was able to read that old messages...\n\nA: In order to view an mbox file in Thunderbird, I needed the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*add the Import/Export extension, otherwise the \"import\" option in the Tools menu did not give me the option to import a file (only data, etc., from another account/app); and\n\n*to use an account which was configured for POP, not IMAP (since the import into IMAP is not possible -- at least with the mbox file I was importing).\n\n\nWith those two conditions in place, everything worked well, and the file was available \"as mail\" in Thunderbird after import (with attachments intact).\n", "Q: How do I access my music and documents from Windows7 on Ubuntu? How do I access my Windows7 music library on Ubuntu 11.10?\nI have just installed Ubuntu and I wish to copy my music library from iTunes to the banshee media player, I'll gladly give more details if necessary. I'm really new to Linux as a whole so if you can please use layman's terms.\n\nA: You can mount the windows 7 partition in ubuntu, copy over the music, then unmount windows 7 partition.\nOr you can keep windows 7 partition mounted on ubuntu (dangerous).  Then you can access your windows file from ubuntu all the time.  Just make sure you don't wakeup to the wrong OS after hibernate, or otherwise you face the danger of a corrupted partition.\nOr if you don't mind redo the partition, you can create a shared data partition.  Put all your data, music, ... on the shared partition.  Both windows 7 and ubuntu can access it.  Just to make sure wake up to the correct OS when you hibernate.\n\nA: This page takes you through how to do it.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountingWindowsPartitions\n", "Q: no wlan0, Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG I have a hp nx7400 installed with Xubuntu 11.10.\nSomehow the wireless does not work, I have read a lot of articles about this but I think I broke more then fixed thinks.\nWhen I do sudo lshw -C network, it returns:\n*-network UNCLAIMED     \n       description: Network controller\n       product: PRO/Wireless 3945ABG [Golan] Network Connection\n       vendor: Intel Corporation\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:10:00.0\n       version: 02\n       width: 32 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm cap_list\n       configuration: latency=0\n       resources: memory:84000000-84000fff memory:84001000-8400100f\n\nSo I am lost and need help, any help is appreciated.\n\nA: With \"PRO/Wireless 3945ABG\" not working, it's probably just off.

I booted the installer from a usb drive, and began installation.\nWhen I detect disks, it asks me if I want to enable the detected RAID array. I choose yes, because I have a RAID0 set up in my motherboard's bios raid driver (which currently holds my windows7 installation and my (now broken) mbr). When I choose partition disks, it can see all partitions including those of Win7. I choose the free space and create a new partition automatically, everything in one partition.\nWhen I move on to install the system, normal or live, it tells me \"Installation step failed\" without so much as a description or error. When I choose to install GRUB, it asks me to first complete \"install base system\" or \"install system\". When I choose base system, it seems to copy or download files and then it fails while installing grub again. On that particular step, I get asked where I want to install the bootloader. /dev/mapper is the default input, but neither that or /dev/sda or sdb etc works.\nAny help is much appreciated, I'm clueless\nEDIT: I finished installation without bootloader, rebooted and got into grub rescue. Then I used https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Command_Line_and_Rescue_Mode instructions, and upon running \"boot\" it send me to a prompt mentioning \"BusyBox\". Prompt is (initramfs)\n\nA: I remember /boot can not use raid0 , but can use raid1.\nYou use raid0 from bios.

It is difficult to translate without context. If I could see how my work will appear while I am doing it, translating is much easier.\nEdit by Oli:\nI understand this question to be from somebody who is translating an application. Translators often only have a list of phrases to translate without being able to see where those phrases are used in the app.\nThis person wants a way to quickly locate a string inside an application so they can understand the phrase better and provide the best possible translation.\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no way to see the result of your work live.\nHowever, during the development cycle, we upload language packs containing the translations done in Launchpad and in upstream projects twice a week. This way translators can see the result of their work quickly, but nevertheless there is a delay of a couple of days - i.e. it's quick, but not instantaneous.\nIn terms of context, it is up to the developer to add context notes to make the work of translators easier. Here's an example of such a developer comment. How well commented translations are varies between applications: some have no comments at all, some are very well commented (Orca is a good example of the latter).\nIn addition to that, in Launchpad you can also see where in the code the translatable message comes from. At the bottom of each message, the file and line location where it comes from are mentioned. While you'll have to have the source code for the application (or look at it on Launchpad), this is also a way to get exact context on where exactly the message is used.\n", "Q: What's the name of an application similiar to gnome-tweak tool?

Can I use newest Ubuntu on that notebook without any problems? Maybe my notebook is too weak for that newest release of Ubuntu? Can you help me?\nPeter.\n\nA: Dual core processors of any type should play well with Ubuntu 11.10 and beyond. However, if your Atom is a single-core, (which I don't thinks so because you said $400), it should still be able to run Unity 2D if Unity 3D is too heavy or laggy. Try a live CD, or live USB, watch performance and if you are confortable, go Ubuntu.\nIf not, faster experiences may be found on Xubuntu or Lubuntu, as said by @Uri Herrera.\nIf you let us know the exact model of your ASUS, (or maybe somethings wrong since google gives me a Celeron laptop), we could be able to tell you how much performance could you get. Good luck! ;)\n", "Q: Is there a way to disable sound in one program? Is there a way for me to be able to enable sound in one program (say, VLC) and at the same time disable sound in another program (say, chrome).\nI am not using these programs in particular. The question is in general. \n\nA: If you click on the sound icon in the top bar (at least in 12.04) and go to Sound Settings > Applications, then you can adjust the sound for each application individually. You can see in the screenshot that I have two programs open at the same time. The top one is Firefox playing a YouTube video and I was able to mute it separately.\n\nA downside of this method is that not all applications appear there. As far as I know, it's only for those which use ALSA. Just give it a try, it works fine for me with some programs.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 20.10 you can do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Click the top right hand corner of the screen, where the battery, sound and wifi icons are located.\n\n\n*Click on Settings\n\n\n\n*When the Popup menu comes up, navigate down to the Sound tab on the left hand side of the the Settings menu.\n\n\n\n*Looking under Volume Levels You can see a list of open windows and the main system sound.

How do I install a driver...3D games under Wine run really slow.\n\nA: You already have the Intel graphics drivers; they're included and enabled by default.  Unlike nVidia and AMD, Intel does not provide a proprietary driver for their GPUs on Linux, so you get the possible performance in the default install.\nAs mentioned in the comments, Intel GPUs (particularly pre-Sandybridge) are not very powerful; your performance expectations may be higher than the hardware is able to deliver.\n\nA: Your Intel graphics driver is not the issue. Running programs in a Windows Emulator will cause your depreciation in quality and framerate. To confirm this, try running a native Linux game from the Ubuntu Software Center, or running glxgears to check FPS speed, and see if you get the same quality. There are a lot of games to choose from, so try choosing something with similar 3D graphics.\n", "Q: How to overwrite Ubuntu with Windows 7? So I have a Windows DVD and it works. But when it gets to the part when it says \"Upgrade\" or \"Custom\" I click on custom and at the bottom it says cannot install over it because Windows 7 can only be installed on an NTFS drive? I know that Ubuntu formatted my partitions into one big on that's an ext4. What can I do?\nI know that I can maybe create a 30-50 GB partition that's an ntfs then when I go into windows I can format the Ubuntu one and combine them but I don't know how to make a partition much less make a big partition in the \"GParted\" program? So any ideas would be very helpful. I know how to do anything with a hard drive using the default program that comes with Windows 7 but I feel like a mouse in a maze when I open GParted.\n\nA: Boot from the Windows install media and at the Drive Setup screen click Drive options (advanced). On that resulting screen, select each partition individually and click Delete. Once done you will see one entry for \"Unallocated Space\". Select that, and click next.

Typically I just --exclude=.gvfs in my rsync command and call it a day.\nRecently I decided to read the rsync man page top to bottom left to right. After all, what better way to learn? Man pages are quicker than Googling, if you ask me. I had noticed the -x flag, which was cited to not cross other file systems.

The discussion talks about a tigon3 (broadcom) driver problem in the kernel.  The 3.0.24 and below tree had this error but as Ubuntu now has support for a 3.0.25-40 kernel the bug has been fixed.  Item #20 talks the details of how this problem was discovered by working back from the development kernels 3.4, 3.3, and 3.2 and how it was discovered what the tg3_stop_block_error means.  It is a problem with TSO. TSO stands for TCP Segmentation offload.  \nUbuntu 12.04 (Non LTS) came with a kernel older than 3.0.25.\nWhat happened in the pre 3.0.25 kernel is explained by Matt Carlson here\n\nOn the earliest TSO capable devices, TSO was accomplished through \n  firmware.  The TSO cannot coexist with ASF management firmware though. \n  The tg3 driver determines whether or not ASF is enabled by calling \n  tg3_get_eeprom_hw_cfg(), which checks a particular bit of NIC memory. \n  Commit dabc5c670d3f86d15ee4f42ab38ec5bd2682487d, entitled \"tg3: Move \n  TSO_CAPABLE assignment\", accidentally moved the code that determines \n  TSO capabilities earlier than the call to tg3_get_eeprom_hw_cfg().  As a \n  consequence, the driver was attempting to determine TSO capabilities \n  before it had all the data it needed to make the decision. This patch fixes the problem by revisiting and reevaluating the decision \n  after tg3_get_eeprom_hw_cfg() is called. \n\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade should do the trick because it will install a newer kernel including the drivers required to solve this problem.  \n", "Q: Why is /dev/rfcomm0 giving PySerial problems? I am connecting my Ubuntu box to a wireless readout setup over Bluetooth. I wrote a Python script to send the serial information through /dev/rfcomm0.

Even when the BluetoothError arises, the \"connected\" light on the receiver stays illuminated, and it is not until I power-cycle to receiver that I can reconnect. \nI'm not sure how to approach this problem. It's odd that the connection would work fine for a few minutes (seemingly a random amount of time) and then seize up.\nIn case it helps, the Bluetooth receiver is a BlueSmirf Silver from Sparkfun. Do I need to be trying to maintain the connection from the receiver end or something?\n\nA: It turns out the Bluetooth buffer on the PC was overflowing because I was never calling recv() in the Python script. \nThe Bluetooth accessory was sending characters to the PC, which the script ignored and which inevitably led to a buffer overflow.

This is an installation step for the driver that I have initially missed.\n\nA: From a week of mindnumbing research on this matter (as it does affect me as well), webGL implementation under the Catalyst 12.2 drivers are either: A) Blacklisted somewhere else rather than the normal locations (i.e. about:flags) or B) Blacklisted for ATI x86_64 devices across the board.  This would mean that Chrome devs need to change some code in default configuration outside of what is editable by users.  I CAN seem to get webGL working in Firefox 11, but framerate is less than half of what I was getting in Chrome.  I will say that after trying xorg-edgers latest gpu drivers (665 fps) vs. ati catalyst 12.2 fglrx(760 fps), I have seen quite an increase in framerate, and I really don't want to go back until I see evidence that xorg-edgers is comparable, but the functionality is definitely lacking ATM for certain applications.  I just wanted to throw commiserating information out there in hopes that more people might be able to spark interest in a fix.\nI tried aticonfig --initial  but the line didn't help the problem, even after reboot.  I used the code to ignore the blacklist for hardware also, but with no success.

Hi I'm an Ubuntu newbie here. I've installed ubuntu 11.10 to dual boot on a single HDD. I did a manual partition and basically forgot all the on what sda my /boot partition is. My installation worked out just fine and I tried to install updates with it. After a while I when I wanted to boot to windows it showed that I was missing a \"hal.dll\" file. I've fixed this problem using the windows resource CD but then after booting up my PC it went straight to Windows XP. I've tried to manually reinstall Grub2 using a Live CD/USB and it worked but I think I have installed in on a different \"sda#\" (sda5 to be exact) because even though Grub2 loads when I boot my PC, only windows XP shows up as my OS and Ubuntu 11.10 is missing. \nNow, I've tried installing boot-repair to solve my problems using Live CD/USB. Boot-repair tells me that boot configuration was successful but then a basic grub interface shows up (the black one with a command line grub> showing up. Now I can't even boot to Windows XP. Any help would be really appreciated. BTW here's the notes from boot repair that I was asked to save: http://paste.ubuntu.com/890228/ As you can see there are boot files on sda5 and sda7. I think that's the core problem that I have right now. \nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I solved a similar missing hal.dll problem for a dual-boot of XP and Ubuntu 12.04 (which I installed after Windows) and Grub2.  I couldn't boot up Ubuntu so I used Boot-Repair which fixed Grub2 and let me boot Ubuntu, but broke my Windows XP boot, ironically (I believe) because I had selected \"Repair Windows boot files\" option.\nThe solution I found was to boot into Ubuntu and edit Windows' C:/boot.ini file.  When I compared this file to the boot.ini.bak file, I saw that the partition number had been inappropriately changed from the original:\ndefault=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(2)\\WINDOWS\n\nto\ndefault=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(3)\\WINDOWS\n\nOnce I restored boot.ini to the original (by pasting the contents of boot.ini.bak into boot.ini) such that XP booted from partition(2) and not partition(3), Windows XP booted up just fine!\nI am really new to this stuff, but I believe this problem occurs because Boot-Repair recognized my Ubuntu swap drive (which is a logical/extended and not a primary partition) as an extra partition, whereas Windows XP did not.  Thus, Boot-Repair will potentially break your Windows boot.ini file if there are logical partitions preceding your Windows installation.\n\nA: Please run Boot-Repair, click \"Advanced options\", then:\n\n\n*\n\n*in the \"GRUB location\" tab, select the \"Use separate /boot : sda5\" option\n\n*and in the \"GRUB options\" tab, tick the \"FlexNet\" option\n\n*then apply, and indicate the new URL that will appear.

I have been using Picasa for years, first in XP then in Ubuntu from 8.04 onwards & now in Lubuntu 11.10.\nFor 11.10, I  downloaded Picasa3.9.0 from FileHippo & installed it in Wine.\nEverything works well, except it doesn't play videos from my camera - it just shows a thumbnail - whereas earlier versions played videos OK.\nThe videos appear as **.MOV (QuickTime video) in file manager, & can be played by, for instance, GNOME MPlayer or Movie Player (but not properly by Banshee...).\nIs there some simple way of getting Picasa 3.9 to play them?\n\nA: Recent Picasa version (maybe also thew older ones, not 100% sure) are using the Quicktime codecs to handle .mov files. That means that if you do not have the plugin installed in your system Picasa wont be able to do anything to those.\nBecause Ubuntu comes with support for .mov files via GStreamer but that does not mean Wine will take advantage of what Ubuntu can do. They are separate systems.\nThat means you need to install some sort of codec support to be able to play .mov files inside your Wine system that includes Picasa. For that I recommend to try either any Windows plugin pack that has .mov files or a lite Quicktime alternative (the standard player wont install).\nFor a plugin pack with .mov support I can recommend the K-Lite Codec Pack since it is know to install and work under Wine and for a Quicktime alternative I recommend QT Lite which is a lite QuickTime implementation.\nAfter you installed any of these 2 inside the same bottle that contains your Picasa install the .mov files will then be supported by Picasa.\n\nA: Take a look at this tutorial. Basically it involves installing Quick Time Alternative. It worked for me.\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 and wine 6.\nwent on line and downloaded picasa setup version 3.9.141 for xp\nand quicktime from old version archive version 7.7.2\nAs normal user ran wine picasa.exe and wine quicktime.exe\nNo problems.\nRan picasa3 and was able to set file type .mov\nrestarted picasa.\nHad a few hiccups with picasa crashing and the file type .mov appearing unset.\nFinally worked.\nIf you set the only movies filter on you can quickly see if all is OK.\nKeep trying.\nPeter\n", "Q: Is there any need to install nvidia graphics drivers if I am running Ubuntu Server? I have googled this question and arrived at no answer, so here I am.\nIf I am going to be running Ubuntu Server, (as before I was running 10.04 Desktop) is there any need to install the Nvidia drivers using, say, 'wget'? I ask this because I am unaware if the drivers only impact the GUI or do they allow for power saving features that the computer could benefit from?\n\nThanks and regards :)\n\nA: You would have no need for nvidia drivers on a server, and the server version of the OS (so long as you are not using a graphical mode) will handle power well enough.\nFor your information as well, you do not install the drivers with wget, but rather with apt-get install.\n\nA: The only reason for nvidia-drivers is in my opinion the GPU-Accelerated computation of BOINC-Units like setiathome or einsteinathome etc. \nI have them running for this reason ONLY.\n", "Q: LibreOffice can not save documents on shared SSH drive - all other applications can I'm having a problem with Libre Office (all the applications).

I was after a word processor that can manage left and right pages separately so I can have my text on the right pages and my illustrations on the left pages.\nI know LibeOffice can set \"left page\" and \"right page\" formats, but there is no simple way to make the text jump from right page to right page when writing.\nI don't know what would be the best way to do that, but I guess I need an app that is designed for writing books and do that kind of thing, or an app that can associate a page format with an object format (so the \"illustration\" format can be exclusively associated with \"left page\" format, and \"text body\" exclusively associated with \"right page\", for example).\nOr is there an extension for LO or OOo out there that I didn't hear about?\nCheers!\n\nA: I don't know any current extension for LO or OO with such implementation, though you can try Scribus, which is desktop publishing software and should meet your requirements. But then again, I'm not sure whether you'll find it easy to manage or not :P\n\nA: Here is the best workaround I found on LO:\n1 - Create two page styles:\n\"Left illustration page\"\n\n\"Right text page\"\n\nAssign next style for left illustration page: right text page\nAssign next style right text page: left illustration page\n2 - Insert a borderless frame in the header of any of the pages with the \"left illustration page\" style. This frame has to fill the entire page, so that the text written on the right pages jumps directly to the next right page, leaving the left page blank. As this frame is included in the header, it will be part of the page style.\n3 - To add illustrations on the left pages: Insert an image in the frame, which is then visible on all left pages -> right click on it and anchor it to the page so that it appears only on the desired page. Another way to do it without inserting it in all pages in the first place is to insert it in a right page, anchor it to the page, cut it and paste it in the left page frame.\nI hope this can help people in the same case!\n", "Q: What are the significant differences between tracepath and traceroute? I recently read a bit of an article on HowToGeek that has me scratching my head a little.  I've got fairly little experience with Linux though, so forgive me if this is entry-level:\n\n\"The tracepath command is similar to traceroute, but it doesn’t require root privileges.\"\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/108511/how-to-work-with-the-network-from-the-linux-terminal-11-commands-you-need-to-know/\n\nHow do traceroute and tracepath perform a similar function, differently?\nWhat does traceroute do, which requires root privileges, that tracepath doesn't?\nAre there scenarios where one should prefer tracepath over traceroute, or vice-versa?\n\nA: How do traceroute and tracepath perform a similar function, differently?\nBoth programs essentially do one thing: send and receive certain IP packets.\nA program can use the normal sockets API to do this, or it can manipulate the raw packets from the interface. The sockets API does not require root privileges, because it is fairly secure. There are mechanisms builtin to prevent one program from accessing IP packets that another program made.\nTracepath uses the sockets API for all it's functionality. Traceroute manipulates raw packets for some of its functionality.\nWhat does traceroute do, which requires root privileges, that tracepath doesn't?\nIt manipulates raw packets.\nTo manipulate raw packets, you need root privileges because by doing this, you bypass the security mechanisms of the sockets API. You gain access to communications of all other processes and users using that interface. Just think about what a virus could do if it could manipulate raw packets.\nAre there scenarios where one should prefer tracepath over traceroute, or vice-versa?\n\nOne advanced command available in Traceroute is the ability to run a\nnetwork trace using IPv4 or IPv6 protocol. It is also possible to\nchoose between ICMP, TCP or UDP data formats for a probe. Traceroute\ncan choose specific source routings for the probe and choose what port\nto send from. It can set limits on the minimum and maximum TTL to\naccept from an outbound probe. IN addition, Traceroute can show the\nwait time for response pings as well as set how many packets are send\nin each probe and how many probes to send. Some of these commands may\nnot be supported by networking hardware along the path, which could\nterminate the probe before it reaches its target destination.\n\nsources:\n1\n2\n3\n\nA: i think you have to read this\nhttp://www.ehow.com/list_7526520_differences-between-traceroute-tracepath.html\nFrom the above link:\n\nTracePath\nTracepath traces a path to a designated network address, reporting on the \"time to live\" or TTL lag and maximum transmission units (MTU) along the way. This command can be run by any user other with access to the command line prompt.\n\n\n\nTraceroute Basics\nTraceroute is essentially the same as Tracepath except that by default, it will only give the TTL value. If you want additional data, you must request those variables on the command line. Also, traceroute requires superuser access to run the command on a Linux box, and some advanced data requests may not be supported by all of the routers along the path. In a Windows environment, any user with access to the command line can run Traceroute.\n\n\nA: ping and traceroute use the ICMP protocol. Like UDP and TCP this is accessible through the normal sockets API. Only UDP and TCP port numbers less than 1024 are protected from use, other than by root. ICMP is freely available to all users.\nIf you really want to see how ping and traceroute work you can download an example C code implementation for them from CodeProject.\nIn short, they simple open an ICMP socket, and traceroute alters the increments the TTL using setsockopt until the target is reached.\nSource : Link\n\nA: You can use traceroute for advanced network tracing , you can choose between IPv4 and Ipv6 protocols , you can also choose between ICMP, TCP or UDP data formats for a probe.\nSo traceroute has more advanced options than tracepath which uses UDP packets for tracing.\nNow about superuser privileges  :\nyou can use traceroute with both a normal user and a superuser that depends on the option you want to use , here is an example :\n\nHere we are using UDP packets which doesn't need superuser privileges \n\nHere we are using ICMP echo packets which need privileges .\nBy ICMP packets you can make DDOS attack. \nTo learn about ICMP options Traceroute Man Page\nTo view traceroute options type in terminal man traceroute \nICMP need super user privileges , to ensure just administrators can use some of its options , because it can be used to make ping of death and collecting information about a specific network , the privilege here will give the super user the ability to change options using ICMP packets.\nThat you can see it , when you try to ping so websites like www.microsoft.com , your ping will fail even its online, and that because Microsoft routers block ICMP_requests .\nSo linux protect the system from unprivileged user , so they can not use this commands for attacking .\n", "Q: Wrong memory info for ATI Radeon video card with `lspci -v`  command?

I don't mind using the Terminal or any library lying around - if I can achieve the desired results.\n\nA: I'd recommend using wkhtmltopdf, which you can get by installing the Ubuntu package of the same name (wkhtmltopdf ).\n\nA: ReText 4.0, recently released, now supports styles (and they are correctly exported to PDF too).\nFor example, if file you are editing is somefile.mkd, create a stylesheet named somefile.css in the same folder, and that style will be automatically loaded.\n\nA: You can use python markdown (from the python-markdown package) and xhtml2pdf (from the python-pisa package).\nYou could have a script like:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nCSS_FILE=~/path/to/style.css\n\nMARKDOWN_FILE=$1.mkd\nHTML_FILE=$1.html\nPDF_FILE=$1.pdf\n\nmarkdown_py $MARKDOWN_FILE > $HTML_FILE\nxhtml2pdf --quiet --css $CSS_FILE $HTML_FILE $PDF_FILE\nrm $HTML_FILE\n\nPut the above code in mkd2pdf, make the file executable (chmod +x mkd2pdf). \nSay your markdown file is called file.mkd then you could run\n./mkd2pdf file\n\nand you would have file.pdf generated in the same directory.

I want to set up a cross platform mail client (Thunderbird), and so far I want to use NAS as a profile store.\nThe NAS is CIFS based, and can be mounted on both Windows and Ubuntu. Also the locking works fine for mutex, and setup seems to work as a proof of concept.\nThe problem is the Linux mount.\nSince I'm using a laptop, I'm not always connected to network, hence, I can't use the /etc/fstab to set up CIFS share with a modified group id. And the share has to be mounted using mount -t cifs ..., which causes it to be owned by root, and owned so badly, that it can't be chowned to the regular user account.\nThis causes read only issues for Thunderbird, which seem to be solved if Thunderbird is launched via sudo.\nBut I would like to avoid that and use a script to mount the share on-demand to a profile location, with profile based privileges and access rights.\nIs there a way to achieve that?\n\nA: I resorted to fstab mount as per http://wiki.centos.org/TipsAndTricks/WindowsShares\nTurns out there are no negative consequences if the share is not available during the bootup, and if network appears later, the share is mounted automatically.\nAlso, I had to update to Thunderbird 11.0 via PPA to get it to understand the newer profile from Windows PC.\n", "Q: ubuntu doesn't boot without flash drive I just installed Ubuntu 11.04 on my Netbook. I had to use a flash key and during the installation i tried putting Ubuntu on a separate partition, but it kept showing a no root file system is defined error. \nI didn't really know what i could do to fix it, so i decided to install it alongside Windows. I have a windows7 installation, which works perfectly fine. So the installation goes through perfectly and i give both OS's 40 Gigs of space. The comp restarts and NOTHING!\nThe computer boots directly into Windows.\nDuring the install it said i am supposed to be prompted at boot, and nothing happened. Ubuntu partitioned the C: drive, but this partition doesn't show up in Windows. If i boot using the flash drive, it shows the partition with the Ubuntu installation. I tried reinstalling, but now i don't get the prompt to asking me to install Ubuntu.\nReally confused ..  \n\nA: It sounds like you have two disk drives and the boot loader was installed to the wrong drive.  Either tell your BIOS to boot from the other drive, or reinstall, and make sure you direct grub to the correct drive.\n", "Q: Installing multiple ubuntu partitions on same machine without corrupting GRUB I had only ubuntu installed on my pc, but I felt like adding another ubuntu (same version) partition so I could have one just for work/study and another one just for personal generic use. \nI installed it and it worked out okay, but I found I needed more space on the new created Ubuntu partition, so I booted up from the Live CD, and used GParted to move/shrink/grow the partitions as the Ubuntu's tutorials suggested it was pretty straightforward. But in doing all this I messed up with Grub, so when I start my system it shows:\nerror: unknow filesystem\ngrub rescue>\nWhat would be the easiest way to recover it so I could have both partitions working? Btw, it wouldn't be a problem for me to lose the partitions if it's the shortest/easiest way.\nThanks in advance.\n\nOk, so I tried all the grub rescue's commands which were listed here (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2) , none of them worked. Also, when I entered 'ls' , it would list several (hd0, msdosX) instead of several (hd0, X) . All the Ubuntu's partitions are inside an extended one. If I delete this partition and overwrite it with a new ext4 partition, using the LiveCD, and then use it to install Ubuntu, would it fix grub?\n\nA: You may want to learn grub's prompt: in grub menu type e to 'edit', then Ctrl+c to enter grub's command line.\nNow, you can enter root (hd<Tab> and grub will display possible devices; having typed (for example) root (hg0,<Tab> you can see possible partiions.\nThe key point is that you can alter grub's configuration before booting the entry: I believe you need to change root to correct its value before boot. You can not \"pollute\" your original menu.lst (or grub.cfg) in this way.\nNote that root is that place where grub directory is located --- the directory where grub's configuration and stage* and filesystem related etc-etc files are --- typically it is /boot/ (grub/ is under it). In my case I can type in grub command line root (hd0,1)/boot/grub<Tab> and see all files needed by grub.\nAfter booting you wil be able to change/correct grub's configuration.\n", "Q: I've had Tomboy twice delete a single important note.

I want to stream these to another device I.e. another pc with VLC across my network. How?\n\nA: On the server side:\nvlc -I http --http-src /path/to/your/vobs\n\nBy this will serve videos using HTTP over port 8080, which might not be terribly efficient. If this becomes an issue, take a look at this superuser question for RTSP solution: Using VLC as RTSP server.\nVLC can also act as a client for your vobs:\nvlc http://localhost:8080/filename.vob\n\nassuming /path/to/your/vobs/filename.vob exists and is playable by VLC.\nNote!

I did that before, but it comes back (dependencies, I suppose).\nTIA\n\nA: The simplest solution would be to change the UID of the non-user accounts to something below 1000. (Just tested, works)\n... actually, the UID needs to be < 500 - and therefore nominally considered to be a 'system' UID - before the greeter will exclude it from the list.

Even if it does you need to think of it as a child directory tree that isn't attached to your '/'.  Then chroot to it and everything will be where you expect.  \nIIRC(if i remember correctly) - recovery mode tells you where the running system's root is mounted.  With that information you can go to /where-rescue-mode-told-me-it-was-mounted/home/user/.profile  \nokay, so I just checked.  Been a while since I had to use recovery console.  Use the remount all as RW option before dropping to a root shell.  It drops you in /root/ as you would expect.  \nSo to get to user .profiles:  \ncd /home\nls\ncd listed_username\nnano .profile\nchange your:\nPATH=\"Path/To/Folder\"\nto \nPATH=$PATH:/path/to/folder\nYou said you're using vi.

I'll assume you can click or double-click just fine, so try a different mouse if this settings change doesn't help.\n", "Q: Symbolic link all files in directory to show in another directory?

At my desk, however, I plug into the ethernet cable.  While I'm working the computer is constantly trying to join the wireless network and usually failing this results in two annoying behaviors.\n1: In gnome shell the network connect and disconnect notices keep popping up at the bottom of the screen and I have to click them to make them disappear (I assume it's been fixed in the next version of gnome).\n2: (the worst!) Occasionally the wifi password dialog will pop up and ask for the password to this network (which is already saved).  An additionally annoyance is that in gnome shell I'll get two copies of the dialog that I have to cancel, one is gnome shell themed (no window border etc...) and the other is just normal gnome themed.  (Sometimes if I've been away from the computer for a while I will have multiple copies of this dialog up as its been trying to connect for a while resulting in at times 20 dialogs to cancel).\nNote, all the while I've been happily connected to the ethernet and have full network access.\nThis is incredibly annoying and distracting, why doesn't ubuntu stop trying to connect to wifi if I'm on the ethernet (unless I want to broadcast my own network, but that's different)?\n\nA: Well, it obviously should check for ethernet connection first, so it's a bug, and you should file a bug report against the network-manager package.\nubuntu-bug network-manager\n\nFor more info, see the bug filing howto: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs\nMeanwhile, disable auto-connecting to that network:\n\n\n*\n\n*right click the network applet in the panel\n\n*select \"Edit Connections...\"\n\n*select the Wireless tab and double click the network\n\n*uncheck the \"Connect Automatically\" box\n\n", "Q: Estimating compressed file size using a list parameter I am currently compressing a list of files from a directory in the following format:\ntar -cvjf test_1.tar.gz -T test_1.lst --no-recursion\n\nThe above command will compress only those files mentioned in the list. I am doing this because this list is generated such that it fits a DVD. However, during compression the compression rate decreases the estimated file size and there is abundant space left in the DVD. This is something like a Knapsack algorithm. \nI would like to estimate the compressed file size and add some more files to the list. I found that it is possible to estimate file size using the following command:\ntar  -cjf - Folder/ | wc -c\n\nThis command does not take a list parameter. Is there a way to estimate compressed file size? I am also looking into options like perl scripts etc.\n\nA: Compression will depend greatly on the repetition of the text it's compressing.  If your files are plain text and all very similar, then you'll get great compression, if they are different compression will start to suffer.  And if they are already compressed (i.e. JPG, MP3, etc) then compression will be even less.\nAs you implied with the \"knapsack\" algorithm, with sufficient time and CPU resources, it should be possible to try all combinations of files in a single compressed tar file.  Unfortunately that could take way too long.\nAssuming your files are similar (i.e all are mostly text, or all are similar files), then you might be able to get a close estimate by compressing each file individually and then adding the sizes together for an estimate at a total compress tar archive.\nThe only downfall is the estimate will fail and produce a smaller final tar.bz2 file if the files are similar and the compression algorithm can use the similarities to it's advantage.\n", "Q: When I create an account without password, Ubuntu still asks for it!

Instead of trying to use the previous password, just leave the password field empty - this should work, because as it is impossible to get rid of all these dialogs that ask you for a pass-phrase, disabling the password is usually achieved by setting it to a blank value.\n\nA: OK, I have to do a little guesswork as the situation of your system is not absolutely clear to me.\n1.) An account in Ubuntu has always a password. It is used to validate your authorization to change important configurations of your system. You can only deactivate that the password is asked when booting into your account (autologin).\n2.) To make changes to the configuration of your system your account must have admin privileges.\n3.) As far as understood you have a root account, which you still can access.

If you are using just a wired connection this will resolve your issue.\n\nA: click on the ipv4 tab and try changing the address type from automatic to manual. then you can enter the ip address, net mask and dns servers, manually.\nyour network provider will be knowing ur ip address and netmask. hope this helps\n\nA: I've had that problem sometimes.

I'm not sure if this a bug as I didn't found anything conclusive, most Themes are broken in  Gnome 3.3.91 and had been broken ever since Gnome 3.3, However I see that the Ambiance and Radiance themes are not?.\nWhat changes were made that only those Themes are looking fine but the rest aren't?\nNote: This isn't exclusive to 12.04 I must add, this happens in 11.10 if one adds the Gnome 3 PPA.\n\n\nA: changes in the Gtk.CssProvider and various other changes are at fault:  See the answer to this question:  No Items show in dash of gnome-shell when using \"Axiom\" Theme?  Gtk3 is currently in a state of flux so Gtk3 styles written for gnome-shell 3.2 (which is what most people were using a few months ago) are not current for 3.3 and 3.4  Unfortunately that means a lot of styles are unavailable or requires fixing in order to work.  My recommendation is to compare a working 3.4 style like malys unisex with any styles from 3.2 you wish to use and see where changes need to be made.  \n", "Q: How to fix a terminal not responding to input? Terminal won't input password when I/it asks for it. \nI am trying to install wine through terminal. \n Enter still works and it goes to next line to run a command as administrator (user \"root\"), by using the sudo command.\nSee \"man sudo_root\" for details.\nd@d-Dimension-8400:~$ `sudo apt-get install wine`  \n\n[sudo] password for d: Sorry, try again.   \n[sudo] password for d: Sorry, try again.   \n[sudo] password for d: Sorry, try again.      \n\nsudo: 3 incorrect password attempts  \n\nThanks\n\nA: Unix and Linux do not show your password in/within terminal while typing it for security reasons!! Basically you would see an asterisk * for each character, but not in this case! \nTry to install sudo apt-get install wine again and when you are prompted for your password, simple type it in, then hit enter.\nIf that doesn't work out for you, then either your password is wrong, the spelling (capital letter etc..) does not match correctly or you use different passwords for login and terminal?! \n", "Q: How to install Chromium .zip file? I have the zip file but I don't know to install it from a .zip file. Here are the contents of the extracted chrome-linux.zip file:\n\n\nA: A .zip file is an archive, so you can't install it, but can unzip or extract it - right click, select 'Extract here'. Call it installation if you like, but that's pretty much it.\nIf you prefer the terminal way, then:\nunzip chrome-linux.zip -d /destination_dir\n\nTo run it cd to the installation directory, and then run ./chrome\nNeedless to say, I'd strongly discourage using any unofficial version of Chrome. It could be unsafe, and your best bet is to get the real thing instead.\n\nA: I could not find a zipped version of chrome to test this, but my guess is that you need to put the chrome-linux directory somewhere like /opt, and then set up a lanucher to point at /opt/chrome-linux/chrome. If you want to be able to execute chrome at any time from the command line, you might also put the chrome-linux directory in your path. Just put\nexport PATH=$PATH:/opt/chrome-linux\nat the end of your .bashrc file in your home directory.\nThat said, if all you're wanting to do is install the stable version of chrome, then you probably want to go to http://www.google.com/chrome and download the .deb file instead.\n\nA: You seem to have downloaded the build of chromium, in order to run that as mikewhatever suggested, all you have to do is to extract it and run the chrome binary, no installing is needed.  \nYou can also add a launcher to ubuntu which runs the binary for you, which means you can just double click to launch. To do this right click on desktop -> add laucher -> In command, enter the full path to the chrome binary.  \n", "Q: Cat a command to file My bash script does many things, among which creating another script.

In Dconf, schema com.canonical.Unity2d has a key named 'use-opengl'. Under description it says 'Whether to render the graphics into an OpenGl viewport'. But does it make any changes on how the desktop looks, or is it just a performance matter?\n\nA: For cards that support accelerated opengl such as NVidia, this setting will significantly improve performance when switching between viewports and other effects.\nSome older cards do not support OpenGl - and as such this setting should be off.  With the setting off, the Raster engine is used - this is a software implementation of the viewport effects you see.\nIt didn't work in Oneiric - but a fix was released for 12.04.\n", "Q: Graphics system failure I just upgraded two versions of Ubuntu to Oneiric after a recent set of updates broke Audacious 2.4.something in Maverick for me.  When it was all finished my Asus Eee 1215N with the 1366x768 screen and the notoriously unsupported Nvidia Ion2 with Optimus chipset was working on minimum compatibility fallbacks at 1024x768 resolution (probably on only the Intel part).

I recall an Edit Image button in 11.04 that would bring up a second window with a Crop button easily visible.\nBut now, in 11.10, I see no such button.  In fact, I can't find a way to crop at all from the default image viewer.\nHow can I crop an image from the default image viewer?\n\nA: Once the image is opened you can right click on it and choose to open with Shotwell Image Viewer. It will open up a new window where you can crop/edit the image and save it.\nOnce saved you can close the 2nd window and see the changes in the default image viewer.\nAlternatively you can set Shotwell Image Viewer to be your default image viewer.\n\nA: The default viewer is very limited, no editing and it doesn't support animated GIFs. What I recommend is installing gthumb which is in the Ubuntu repositories. Gthumb is fast loading and provides all the basic editing functions without the complication of GIMP. It also serves as a image manager which doesn't impose a date based folder structure for images. I for one prefer filing by event or subject -- makes images much easier to locate.\n", "Q: Is there a GUI for /etc/hosts that I can use? I want to be able to easily and frequently edit my hosts file from a quick GUI.

Since it exists in /etc and you cannot edit as general user you need to use sudo. The graphical frontend to sudo is gksu. So basically doing gksu YOUR_GRAPHICAL_EDITOR /etc/hosts will do it OR you can use terminal with nano and vim. I recommend nano as it is quite easy.\nsudo nano /etc/hosts\nIn order to ease the command you can use alias.\nSo edit your .bashrc file in your $HOME. i.e.\nIn your terminal do:\nnano .bashrc \n\nAdd\nalias edithosts='gksu YOUR_GRAPHICAL_EDITOR /etc/hosts' OR 'sudo nano/vim/vi /etc/hosts'\n\nand save it with Ctrl+x. And do source ~/.bashrc.

I've been reading: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuCloudInfrastructure\nIt's fascinating stuff, but documentation seems a bit sparse. Where I work, we have this aging, clunky VMWare ESXi setup for all our internal servers. I'd really like to read up on possible migration or just information on Orchestra, integration with Juju, etc that isn't a bunch of loosely connected blog posts. :p\nThis is concerning 11.10 and, presumably, 12.04.\nTo make this less vague, specifically documentation on:\n\n\n*\n\n*Orchestra - features, comparisons, videos, etc\n\n*Integrating Juju with Orchestra - I'm familiar with using Juju for deploying on AWS, but that wiki page glances over connecting it to orchestra\n\n*Building a private cloud - Advantages, using/deploying Openstack, etc\n\n*Working with internal networks - Configuring DMZs, setting rules, etc\n\n\nAny recommended books would be appreciated too. I didn't intend for this to be a 'do all my homework for me!

However, then I get:\nCould not connect:  (16, 'Device or resource busy')\n\nAm I doing something wrong with the connection? Do I need to occasionally reopen the socket? I'm not sure how to recover from this type of error.\nI understand that sometimes the port will be busy and a write operation is deferred to avoid blocking other processes, but I wouldn't expect the connection to fail so regularly.

I am not sure if it's a Xubuntu problem because it does this while I am using Windows 7 too. Any help would be nice, thanks!\n\nA: It sounds like your hands get too close to the touchpad when you type, accidentally triggering mouse clicks. In the settings for the mouse and touchpad, there's a setting for deactivating the touchpad while typing; make sure that one is checked.\n\nA: You may wish to try the program called GPointingDeviceSettings. It allows you to deactivate clicking by tapping the touchpad. It's in the repositories, so you can just follow http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/gpointing-device-settings to install it. \n", "Q: Do you really think our office computer will be screen touchable in years? I can't work without my keyboard, 'cuz m a programer.

It's ridiculous！ Touch screen is just used for fun! OK? We don't want bring up a mouse when we want watching TBBT on bus seat way home.\n\nA: Tablets and other portable touchscreen computers are pretty popular nowadays and only becoming more so; companies like Canonical or Microsoft recognize that most people (i.e., ordinary users) want this form factor, and so it is only natural that they develop their OS interfaces to stay with the current trends. I doubt many people would want a tablet with a traditional desktop UI on it. It seems that these people are also trying to maintain a consistent UI across devices, which also makes sense if you look at cloud computing. The idea is that people want a familiar interface on whatever devices they own and to be able to interact with their data in the same way across each of them rather than have to learn a new interface for each device they use.\nThat all being said, rest assured that I don't think traditional keyboards will be going anywhere anytime soon. Touchscreen computers with dockable keyboards like the ASUS Transformer, for example, show that it is possible to get the best of both worlds. Work on making Unity keyboard-accessible has also been ongoing; see recent additions that will be present in 12.04 like the keyboard shortcut overlay, for example. Not everyone needs to have a keyboard to use their computer, but if you do choose to continue to use one for whatever type of tasks you have, you can bet that it will still be well-supported, at least by Canonical.\n", "Q: Error when using \"ubuntu-vm-builder\" command to create Ubuntu11.10 guest on Ubuntu11.10 host I want to create guest os(Ubuntu11.10) on host(Ubuntu11.10)\nwith \"ubuntu-vm-builder\" command.\nsome error is occured\ndo you know how to diagnose to this case ?\nplease Give me a piece of advice.\nMy log is following\nhttps://gist.github.com/1670826\nI worked with following article: \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/CreateGuests\n\nA: I was building a 10.04 image on a 11.04 server and had to do the following to get it to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit VMBuilder's dapper.py (even if you're not building dapper).

I have used it a few times on Skype when it seemed okay, but have been trying to use it with Google+ Hangouts. There I found that it would be okay at first, but then the picture would freeze. Sound through the built-in microphone is fine.\nI wondered if it was the Google plug-in, but just doing some experiments with Cheese and that freezes too.

Any suggestions on things to look at?\n\nA: Many applications, like webcams, doesn't seem to work well (or at all) with V4L2.

Cheers\n\nA: If you really did change the permissions on your root partition, there are limited options for you other than a complete reinstall.  There are too many files owned by too many different users to be practical to restore the permissions by hand.  Anything that you could do without a working backup would be a hack, and I'm hesitant to give you my thoughts on that.  You could, for example, change the permissions to read-write for all on the root partition, which may get you back into a \"working\" system, but would be incredibly bad security.  Something like that could only be a temporary fix.\nReally, you should reinstall.  You should do things like save/recover the list of packages installed so that when you reinstall the system goes back to having all the packages you had before.  See http://www.arsgeek.com/2006/09/19/ubuntu-tricks-how-to-generate-a-list-of-installed-packages-and-use-it-to-reinstall-packages/  for example.  This can be done from the recovery console, assuming you can get into it.  You can also backup/restore your /home directory so you don't lose any files.  This exercise will probably move you beyond the rank of \"newbie\".

Almost no gnome-shell extension are not supporting. I find few in the internet which support new gnome-shell.\nWhat do can I do to make my 3.2 extensions work in 3.4 gnome-shell?\n\nA: I think that this is an issue with the metadata.json files, which stores the extension compatibility.\nAs 3.3 version of Gnome is actually an unstable version, I think that the extensions will be update to support it after the extension mantainers will test them.\nThat will happen probably after it will be officially released as a stable version and included in distro's repos (Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, ecc) with number 3.4.\nUntil then, only the extension maintainers which are active developer of Gnome can test and update them.\nActually, if you are testing Gnome 3.3, the best thing you can do is to send a message to the developer of the extensions you are interested in and says them that their extension does or does not work.\n\nA: You can download the extension as zip file and edit metadata.json with a text editor. \nAdd your gnome-shell --version to this file and copy the extension to /home/username/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/.

Nautilus's thumbnail cache in ~/.thumbnails has grown to several hundred megabytes.\nDo I need to be concerned about unrestricted growth of this in the long term, or is its size automatically managed somehow?\n\nA: It's size is automatically managed, because it has a built in limit of 512MB by default, and deletes thumbnails older than 180days.

I have question #190306 for more than 10 days without an answer. Usually, I get answers from the Ubuntu experts within a couple of days. The problem that I have is persistent and annoying. Where should I go?\n\nA: Ask the same question here on AskUbuntu. I don't mean to denigrate the efforts or expertise of the Launchpad Answers folks—and for extremely technical, project code-related questions they may be the best to ask—but the community here is more vibrant and less fractured, and the software more attuned to preventing good questions from falling down the cracks.\nFollow the FAQ, and you're nearly certain to get some sort of resolution here.\n\nA: I have always found Ubuntu Forums to provide the best answers for questions like the one you posted at launchpad. Ask Ubuntu is good for very specific questions but the forums are more suited to solving open problems.\n", "Q: What is swap and how large a swap partition should I create? I have a system with 4gb of RAM and Intel i5 processor. I want to know how much memory I should allocate to SWAP. Will allocating more memory help increase the system performance.\nIn the past i have always allocated 4gb for SWAP.\n\nA: Swap is what is used when you run out of RAM.\nRAM is fast. SWAP is SLOWWWWWW (being as its mechanical (hard disk) as opposed to ram (purely electronic)).\nIn the old days, you allocated double the amount of RAM you had to swap. These days its not such a hard and fast rule. 2-4gb is the usual.\n\nRelated question: I have 16GB RAM.

The quick help of Unity (long press on the Super button) shows that Switch windows of current application can be triggered by Alt+Grave keyboard shortcut. What is Grave?\nHere it is:\n\n\nA: This is usually the button immediately above the TAB on most keyboards.\nFor my keyboard - grave is actually correctly known as the ` key - grave is also known as the back-tick.\nIn my travels I have seen the Ubuntu \"key above the tab\" to actually be the § or  º.  I'm sure there are many other similar characters on peoples keyboards.\nDepending on your locality if you press and hold the SUPER to display the overlay, you should see the equivalent Grave key for your locality\nfor example:\n\n(thanks Javier Rivera)\nFor my keyboard combination - ALT+` - gives you this switching capability (cycle through the windows group):\n\nTo use this key combination - let go of the grave without letting go of Alt and then repress grave to cycle through the windows group.\n\nA: Additional information:\nList of most common Accents and Diacritical marks\n\nacute       ´  \nbreve       ˘  \ncaron       ˇ  \ncedilla     ¸  \ncircumflex  ^  \ndieresis    ¨  \ngrave       `  \nmacron      ¯  \nogonek      ˛  \ntilde       ˜  \n\n\n\nEDIT: \ntilde | ˈtildə | noun\nan accent ˜ placed over Spanish n when pronounced ny (as in señor) or Portuguese a or o when nasalized (as in São Paulo), or over a vowel in phonetic transcription, indicating nasalization.   \n\n\n*\n\n*the same symbol as a part of a URL.\n\n*a similar symbol used in mathematics to indicate similarity, and in logic to indicate negation.\n\n\nORIGIN mid 19th cent.: from Spanish, based on Latin titulus.\nV.S\nmacron | ˈmāˌkrän; **ˈmak-; ˈmākrən | noun\na written or printed mark ¯ used to indicate a long vowel in some languages and phonetic transcription systems, or a stressed vowel in verse.\nORIGIN mid 19th cent.: from Greek makron, neuter of makros ‘long.’\nSource: \n\nGood question yossile (+1)up.\nFirst of all, both differentiate in visual appearance ¯ vs. ˜.

This have happened to me 4 times. When I use alt-tab Unity resets. It doesn't close any apps, but when I click an app that was already open - but minimized - I only can see the minimize/maximize/close buttons and a thin border around the window, it but nothing in it, as on the following picture: \n\nThis doesn't just happen to one app, but to all my opened minimized apps.\nI also want to ask if I should file a bug report? \n\nA: As fossfreedom says, if you login as a guest user, you'll have a completely fresh user account. If you can get the results there, then that means there is a bug somewhere in the software, most likely Compiz, and then you should report it. Otherwise, it's possible that there is a misconfiguration that causes it. \nIn order to file a good bug report, press Alt+F2 and enter ubuntu-bug unity. You'll be asked if the bug you are reporting is a graphical one. Answer yes to that question so that information about your graphics card, driver, etc can also be appended. \nPlease make sure you've installed all upgrades and that you can still reproduce the problem before filing bugs. \nFrom your screenshot, I'd say it's more than likely that the issue has to do with Compiz. But it is not impossible that it is a misconfiguration, so check with a guest account first. \n", "Q: Why Ubuntu One pretends to sychronize files, but it doesn't? I have my Ubuntu One account configured in both Ubuntu 11.10 and iOS (ipod-touch). The photos from the iOS were successfully uploaded, but in Ubuntu One, although it shows the \"syncing\" and \"synchronized\" marks over the icons, the files are not showing in the website (one.ubuntu.com).\nIn short: My files are not showing in the Ubuntu One website, although the icons have the \"uploaded\" mark.\nAny idea what can be wrong here?\nobs1: Also, not sure if it's related, the icon-marks will show only when I open the Ubuntu One Control Panel. It shows the message \"file was uploaded\", but there's nothing online.\nobs2: The folder I'm trying to synchronize is 30mb size. And my connection is 8mbps.\n\nA: While the +50 bounty would be nice, askUbuntu is probably the wrong place for this. You should instead open a support request on https://one.ubuntu.com/help/contact/ or a bug report on Launchpad by running ubuntu-bug ubuntuone-client, so that the issue can be more appropriately looked at.\n\nA: Sometimes it happens that if you had the same folder create before it wouldn't sync it. Also, if you have a folder full of files and try to sync the parent folder, it will only synchronize the parent folder and leave the rest of the files unsynced. You should try to sync a new empty folder and then add the rest of the files.\nI totally agree with dobey. The +50 bounty would be very nice but this must be certainly a bug to report.\n", "Q: How can I repair error when trying to access my home folder after installing Compiz in Xubuntu I found that Compiz is usable with Xfce and after installing it, adding it to start with session and restarting session, I couldn't access my home folder (I have access to folders that are within 'home/user'). I get this error message: Error stating file 'Home/user/.gvfs'. Transport endpoint is not connected.  \nI unistalled Compiz and still get the same error.\nHow could I repair this?\n\nA: There is a rather old bug-report with your error message.\n\nAfter logout and following login every attempt to access $HOME/.gvfs\n  (i.e. with ls or df) results in 'Transport endpoint is not connected'\n  error message. At the same time $HOME/.gvfs is present in /etc/mtab.\n  Also GVFS-mounts are accessible through FUSE when\n  /usr/lib/gvfs/gvfs-fuse-daemon is called with some other directory as\n  argument.\n\nA workaround suggested was in post#6\nmanually unmount the ~/.gvfs using:\nfusermount -u ~/.gvfs\n\nThen close/unmount all opened remote locations in Thunar/Nautilus and log out and back in, again. \nThis should restore the .gvfs-functionality\nsource\n", "Q: Switching to console mode in VirtualBox distorts graphics \nPossible Duplicate:\nHelp fixing Virtual Console (tty1-6) under VirtualBox \n\nI'm using Virtualbox 4.1.2 on a Windows host, and have ubuntu 11.10 oneiric installed. I can use the graphic mode normally, but when I try to use console model (Ctrl+alt+f1,ctrl+alt+f2) a distorced screen is showed (see the screenshot).\n\nThanks in advance\n\nA: I think you would be best served by installing 'openssh-server' and establish an SSH session into that VM using PuTTY or the Cygwin terminal - you can then run byobu or just straight Tmux or Screen to allow for multiple console applications at one time. It would give you much more flexibility, and be (I think) a good bit faster, and smoother than using VT's in the VirtualBox display. \n\nA: The virtualbox guest additions only work in X11.  It's by design.  If you want term access use a)remote connection via ssh and Putty or b)accept that without the GUI running you have a set resolution.\n", "Q: Game \"Zen Bound 2\" from Humble Bundle doesn't run I bought the latest humble indie bundle and installed the 64-bit deb of Zen Bound 2 on my Ubuntu 12.04 Intel-based desktop system using Ubuntu Software Centre by clicking the deb.

I tried it and immediately had a big problem (here). Also, could not use more than one workspace.  It is said that they are compatible, that is: I can install Compiz with Xfce if I want to. But I enter a world of bugs, am I not? \nI would like more opinions, please.\n\nA: Yes, Compiz is compatible with XFCE. The thing is, for common people, choosing XFCE over the \"common\" ones like KDE, Unity and Gnome is because of limited resources (CPU and Memory most of the time).\nBut sources like the following confirm that Compiz is compatible with XFCE but needs a little more loving to get it working:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Compiz#XFCE \n\n*http://www.ghacks.net/2010/07/11/run-compiz-with-xfce4/\n\n*How do I enable Compiz in xubuntu?\n\nA: XFCE is for users that want a minimalist desktop.

I tried going to content>certificates but it will not accept the .p12 file I created. \nIs there any way to get SSL browsing working using IE7?\nError Log....\nerr:comboex:COMBOEX_WindowProc unknown msg 200b wp=00000000 lp=0033d598\nerr:toolbar:ToolbarWindowProc unknown msg 200b wp=00000000 lp=0033d390\nerr:rebar:REBAR_WindowProc unknown msg 200b wp=00000000 lp=7e2e2b88\nfixme:shell:DllGetClassObject failed for CLSID={871c5380-42a0-1069-a2ea-08002b30309d} (Internet)\nfixme:shell:DllGetClassObject failed for CLSID={871c5380-42a0-1069-a2ea-08002b30309d} (Internet)\nfixme:shell:DllGetClassObject failed for CLSID={871c5380-42a0-1069-a2ea-08002b30309d} (Internet)\nfixme:shell:DllGetClassObject failed for CLSID={871c5380-42a0-1069-a2ea-08002b30309d} (Internet)\nfixme:shell:DllGetClassObject failed for CLSID={871c5380-42a0-1069-a2ea-08002b30309d} (Internet)\nfixme:shell:DllGetClassObject failed for CLSID={871c5380-42a0-1069-a2ea-08002b30309d} (Internet)\nfixme:shell:DllGetClassObject failed for CLSID={871c5380-42a0-1069-a2ea-08002b30309d} (Internet)\nfixme:shell:DllGetClassObject failed for CLSID={871c5380-42a0-1069-a2ea-08002b30309d} (Internet)\nfixme:shell:DllGetClassObject failed for CLSID={871c5380-42a0-1069-a2ea-08002b30309d} (Internet)\nfixme:shell:DllGetClassObject failed for CLSID={871c5380-42a0-1069-a2ea-08002b30309d} (Internet)\nfixme:shell:DllGetClassObject failed for CLSID={871c5380-42a0-1069-a2ea-08002b30309d} (Internet)\nfixme:wininet:InternetConfirmZoneCrossingW (0x100de, L\"http://localhost:8000/accelerator\", L\"https://localhost:8000/accelerator\", 0) stub\nfixme:shell:DllGetClassObject failed for CLSID={871c5380-42a0-1069-a2ea-08002b30309d} (Internet)\nfixme:shell:DllGetClassObject failed for CLSID={871c5380-42a0-1069-a2ea-08002b30309d} (Internet)\nfixme:shell:DllGetClassObject failed for CLSID={871c5380-42a0-1069-a2ea-08002b30309d} (Internet)\nfixme:ole:NdrCorrelationInitialize (0x101bf78, 0x101bb78, 1024, 0x0): stub\nfixme:rpc:NdrStubCall2 new correlation description not implemented\nfixme:ole:NdrCorrelationFree (0x101bf78): stub\nfixme:ole:NdrCorrelationInitialize (0x101bf9c, 0x101bb9c, 1024, 0x0): stub\nfixme:shell:DllGetClassObject failed for CLSID={871c5380-42a0-1069-a2ea-08002b30309d} (Internet)\nfixme:rpc:NdrStubCall2 new correlation description not implemented\nfixme:ole:NdrCorrelationFree (0x101bf9c): stub\nfixme:shell:DllGetClassObject failed for CLSID={871c5380-42a0-1069-a2ea-08002b30309d} (Internet)\nfixme:shell:DllGetClassObject failed for CLSID={871c5380-42a0-1069-a2ea-08002b30309d} (Internet)\nfixme:wininet:InternetSetOptionW INTERNET_OPTION_IDN; STUB\nfixme:wininet:InternetSetOptionW INTERNET_OPTION_SEND_UTF8_SERVERNAME_TO_PROXY; STUB\nfixme:wininet:InternetSetOptionW Option INTERNET_OPTION_CODEPAGE (65001): STUB\nfixme:wininet:InternetSetOptionW INTERNET_OPTION_CODEPAGE_PATH; STUB\nfixme:wininet:InternetSetOptionW INTERNET_OPTION_CODEPAGE_EXTRA; STUB\nfixme:wininet:InternetSetOptionW INTERNET_OPTION_COOKIES_3RD_PARTY; STUB\nfixme:wininet:InternetSetOptionW Option INTERNET_OPTION_REQUEST_PRIORITY (0): STUB\nfixme:shell:DllGetClassObject failed for CLSID={871c5380-42a0-1069-a2ea-08002b30309d} (Internet)\nfixme:shell:DllGetClassObject failed for CLSID={871c5380-42a0-1069-a2ea-08002b30309d} (Internet)\nerr:wininet:NETCON_secure_connect SSL_connect failed: 12045\nfixme:wininet:query_global_option Stub for 98\nfixme:shell:DllGetClassObject failed for CLSID={871c5380-42a0-1069-a2ea-08002b30309d} (Internet)\nfixme:ole:NdrCorrelationInitialize (0x101cd0c, 0x101c90c, 1024, 0x0): stub\nfixme:rpc:NdrStubCall2 new correlation description not implemented\nfixme:ole:NdrCorrelationFree (0x101cd0c): stub\nfixme:ole:NdrCorrelationInitialize (0x101cd30, 0x101c930, 1024, 0x0): stub\nfixme:rpc:NdrStubCall2 new correlation description not implemented\nfixme:ole:NdrCorrelationFree (0x101cd30): stub\nfixme:shell:DllGetClassObject failed for CLSID={871c5380-42a0-1069-a2ea-08002b30309d} (Internet)\nfixme:wininet:CommitUrlCacheEntryInternal entry already in cache -

You can do this by adding uid and gid options to your mount command.  \n\nA: Mounting this way in Ubuntu 18.10 is deprecated, but still works. With a spot of luck your external drive will be mounted as the current user.

I am using VirtualBox to set up a copy of Ubuntu for experimenting.

It lists the VirtualBox for boot and lists one option for the actual OS.\nIs that one option the virtual box too?\n\nA: Your question is difficult to understand. Yes, you can install Ubuntu in virtualbox. That runs as a program in your main operating system. That is not the same as dual-boot, where you have two operating system side by side but only run one at a time. That's also perfectly possible with Ubuntu, but that's something entirely different and you don't need VirtualBox for that.\nI hope it answered your question. If you edit your question to be easier to understand, I can probably provide a better answer.\n\nA: Yes you may use VirtualBox for Ubuntu under Ubuntu. I prefer vmware-player too.\n", "Q: CPU spikes cause audio stuttering in Audacious when browsing? (Lubuntu) My default audio player is Audacious, browser Google Chrome. I tried Firefox, and while I love it, the CPU load spikes when doing something as simple and small and switching a tab, which causes the audio playing to stutter (as sound is onboard and handled thru the CPU). Chrome doesn't do this as much, but there is the occasional stuttering when browsing, which is ridiculous, as not even Windows Vista does this. So I thought maybe it's something to do with how Lubuntu handles sound, I checked and only ALSA was installed. I tried installing PulseAudio, but, while the music \"plays\", nothing comes through the speakers. Immediately after switching back to ALSA the music pours out of them.\nSo I was wondering if you had any idea what was going on here. I asked on Ubuntu Forums but apparently my problem is too complex, as it's been over a week since the last reply.\nSpecs are:\n\n\n*\n\n*AMD Athlon 64 3200+ @ 2GHz\n\n*2GB Corsair 667MHz DDR2 RAM\n\n*ATi HD Radeon 3650 (AGP) 512MB\n\n*500W Cooler Master PSU\n\n*80GB SATA II HDD (Vista is installed on 500GB drive)\n\n*Biostar K8M800 Motherboard\n\n\nA: Here are two things that you could try:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have visualization plugins running, turn them off (this was enough for me to fix stutter)\n\n*Adjust the buffer size (in Preferences > Audio > Buffer size), for example this old redhat bug discussion suggests values around 500, while I think I had better luck with higher values.\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to learn which files in the installed system are changed/updated during a kernel update? Is there a way to find out which files in the installed system are changed/updated during a kernel update/upgrade?\n\nA: The kernel is made up of two main packages the linux-image-* and linux-headers-* packages.  A kernel is made up of the pair at the same version.  You can see all of your installed kernel with the command below, the latest kernel has the largest version number:\ndpkg -l 'linux-image-*' 'linux-headers-*' | grep '^ii'\n\nTo see the pair associated with the current running kernel use the command below:\ndpkg -l '*'`uname -r`\n\nThe files which make up a kernel package (or indeed any package) are listed using the dpkg -L command, something similar to the following:\ndpkg -L linux-image-3.2.0-23-generic\n\nOf course there are a few other files which get updated which are not contained within these packages, for example the initramfs for each kernel is generated after installation and the bootloader (typically grub) configuration is rebuilt to contain the new kernel.\n", "Q: Windows7 in VirtualBox, does this mean I can use Windows software? Now, my problem is that there are loads of things that I cannot use with wine.\nCan I just install Windows7 in VirtualBox and use those few basic software (trade manager, Nokia 5800 PC Suite) that I really need?\n\nA: Yes, a VirtuaBox Windows system will allow you to run all the software that you would run inside a normal install (except for a lot of Direct3D software, ie, 3D games) and allow you to connect any USB accessory to the guest Windows system.\nOf course that will cost you some performance but nothing too noticeable.\nAny USB devices attached to the host can be seen in the guest via a USB 1.1 emulated controller included and if you install the closed source version (download directly from the VirtualBox site) you will emulate a USB 2.0 one.\n\nTo install VirtualBox you can do so via the software center or if you prefer you can install the closed source version from the Oracle's repos via these instructions\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install VirtualBox 4.1?\nMounting a USB device is simple and the instructions should be similar to the post bellow\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I mount a Motorola Droid Bionic?\n", "Q: How do I remove rounded borders in GNOME Shell?

Refer to the original forum in the sources below if you would like to view the entire thread.\nSource: ArchLinux Forum - https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=138403\n\n\nA: For the people who use a custom theme: A better way is to modify the gnome-shell css file of the theme. If you use a gnome-shell.css file with your custom theme, edit the file with a text editor and just add these lines: \n.panel-corner { \n -panel-corner-radius: 0px;\n -panel-corner-background-color: transparent;\n -panel-corner-border-width: 0px;\n -panel-corner-border-color: transparent;\n}\n\n\"Remove Rounded Corners extension\" is a good extension but sometimes it bugs with the \"User Theme\" extension...\n\nA: Any easier way to remove rounded corners and have it persist even after theme updates is to use the Remove Rounded Corners extension. \nRemove Rounded Corners Extension\n\nA: There is a package called GNOME Tweak Tool sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool that allows you to make changes to the interface, and install new themes. You can find additional GNOME-Shell themes here, and perhaps other sites as well.\n", "Q: Hide launcher when switching workspaces When I switch to another workspace, the launch bar on the left will automatically appear, this really annoys me.\nHow do I disable the automatic display of the launch bar after switching workspaces?\n\nA: I'm assuming you have a Window maximized on the first workspace which causes the \"dodge\" hide of the Launcher be active. When you switch to the new workspace, there is no window causing the dodge behavior of the Launcher to kick in, so the Launcher shows itself.\nThere is no default way (in Ubuntu 11.04 -> 11.10) to change this. There are methods involving installing CCSM, yet these are unsupported and can break your Unity environment. I won't get into those, as I haven't tried them, perhaps others will.\nWhat is good for you to know is, that in the upcoming 12.04 release you can choose to have the Launcher either always visible, or always hidden (on all workspaces), and you can adjust the size of the icons to reduce screen space used. Perhaps this will give you a working solution without resorting to hacks in the near future.\n\nA: MyUnity is a config utility that will let You do just that. \nMyUnity > Launcher > Behavior > Hidden instead of Avoid window.\n\nA: Do not use CCSM unless you know exactly what you are doing. I did not, and ended up having to reinstall Ubuntu 11.\nThe side bar alone made me switch to Xubuntu\n", "Q: Dash Home Not Working Forgive my stupid question, but I just can't seem to get this working.

I tried to use the KDE GUI and could not seem to make the function I wanted work. \nThe functions I am trying to get to work are \n\n\n*\n\n*fn+F12 = skip song\n\n*fn+F11 = previous song\n\n*fn+F10 = stop\n\n*fn+ F9 = play/pause. \n\n\nI know this is possible because it worked in Ubuntu and in Mint, but it does not work in Kubuntu. I have submitted a bug report on this issue. \nDisclaimer: I am using Kubuntu 12.04\nI have looked at this post, but Is there a way to enable Ubuntu Keyboard shortcuts in Kubuntu? do not know what to call the keys in that program. \n\nA: KDE assigns keyboard shortcuts on a per app basis. If you are using Amarok, for example, click on the Settings menu item and then the third item under that Configure shortcuts. This will open a dialogue with all the Amarok actions and 3 separate shortcut options for each action.\n", "Q: An increase to 3 Gig of RAM slows down Ubuntu 10.04 LTS I have Ubuntu 10.04 running from an external hard drive (installed on an enclosure) connected via USB port. Like a month or so ago, I increased RAM on my pc from 2 Gigs to 3 Gigs. This resulted on extremely long boot times and slow application loads. While I was understanding the nature of my problem, I posted various threads on this forum ( Questions # 188417, 188801), where I was advised to gather speed tests, and other info on my machine. I was also suggested that I might have problems with the RAM installed. Initially, I did not consider that possibility because:\n1) I did a memory test with a diagnostic program from DELL (My pc is from Dell)\n2) My pc works fine with Windows XP (the default OS), no problems with memory\n3) My pc works fine when booting with Ubuntu 10.10 memory stick, no speed problems\n4) My pc works fine when booting with Ubuntu 11.10 memory stick, no speed problems\nAnyway, I performed the memory tests suggested. But before doing it, and to check out any possibility of hardware issues on the hard drive, I did the following: (1) purchased a new hard drive enclosure and moved my hard drive to it, (2) purchased a new USB cable and used it to connect my hard drive/enclosure setup to a different USB port on my pc.\nThen, I performed speed tests with 1 Gig, 2 Gigs and 3 Gigs of RAM with my Ubuntu 10.04 OS. Ubuntu 10.04 worked well when booted with 1 Gig or 2 Gigs of RAM. When I increased to 3 Gigs, it slowed down to a crawl. I can't understand the relationship between an increase of 1 Gig and the effect it has in Ubuntu 10.04. This doesn't happen with Ubuntu 10.10 and 11.10. Unfortunately for me, Ubuntu 10.04 is my principal work operating system.

Tablet is up to date but no file there.\nHow can I get the latest version of my file that got lost from UbuntuOne folder? \nThank you\nYuriy\n\nA: Sorry for the problems. Ubuntu One should only delete files if it is told to do so through the webUI or a computer connected to your account. On Ubuntu 11.04 and higher, and on Windows, Ubuntu One moves files to the trash. So I would check the Trash on your computers first. Another option is to contact Ubuntu One support and tell them the name of the cloud folder that contained the file. They can attempt a recovery script to recover any files that may still be on the server.\nIf you have the time you might try and recreate the scenario with a test document. If you are able to reproduce this behavior please file a bug so the developers can look into this. You can file a bug against the ubuntuone-client package here. Please include your Ubuntu One logs. These logs may contain filenames. If this is an issue for you please mark the bug as private and only the Ubuntu One developers will see the bug. Here are the steps for including the logs.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your home folder\n\n*Click the View->Show Hidden Files menu option\n\n*Open the .cache/ubuntuone folder\n\n*Right click on the log folder and select \"Compress\"\n\n*Click OK and you should have a file named \"log.tar.gz\" in the .cache/ubuntuone folder, move this file to your Desktop since it's in a hidden folder which can be hard to find in the next step\n\n*Attach the log.tar.gz to your bug report.\n\nA: Try looking in the Trash first. The file I lost was in there, and no, I didn't delete it myself.\nI have files synchronized between two laptops and a desktop. A very large document that I had been working on for months went missing from a folder synchronized through Ubuntu One. It wasn't found on either of the secondary systems. However, on the system that the original synchronization was set up on, I found the file in my Trash. Thankfully I hadn't emptied the trash before noticing the file was gone.\nI can guarantee that I didn't delete the file myself. I also found that an older version of the file was on the two secondary systems with the '.conflict' extension. Since these were both older, they did me no good. \nIt seems to me that the Ubuntu One synchronization messes up every so often and deletes a file when the file is marked as a 'conflict' on another system. I'm guessing this is because the original is no longer on that system since it was renamed by Ubuntu One. This is a major flaw since it would be very easy to lose files without realizing it until it's too late.\n", "Q: PrintScreen doesn't work when I'm in a context menu I usually take screenshots printscreen which calls into gnome-screenshots.

No problem so far. But if i'm not logged in in a gnome-session (for example in the login screen), or just change to a tty, then the power-button won't work. But i remember that i worked in 11.04. So what's changed and how to restore?\nBackground: I use my machine as a print server. If im not home and my wife wants to print sth., she used to switch on my machine, print via her laptop, and then just shut it down by power-button. Beginning of march i was on a business tour, and she called me that she could not shutdown my machine anymore. I shut it down by ssh, but this seems not the favorable way to me.\nI already had a look in /etc/acpi/powerbtn.sh and think that the line if pidof x $PMS > /dev/null; then exit is the cause for this since it aborts the script when no gui-power-manager is found. Is that right? But that does not explain with the power-button does not work when switching from the x11-session to a tty, although this would not be critical to me.\n\nA: \n... aborts the script when no gui-power-manager is found ...\n\nThe opposite is true. When any user with any gui-power-manager is running, the script is aborted.\nIt seems that when you switch to another console and log in as the same user that runs the X11 session, the script assumes that you are on the X11 session and that the g-p-m will handle the key press; probably the gui-power-managers nowadays are smart enough to understand that they are not the active console and ignore the key.\n(edit) Just tried it:\n\n\n*\n\n*The script only shut down on a console, when no x11 session is present, regardless of the users logged in\n\n*It will even fail to shut down when only lightdm is presenting its login prompt.\n\n\nYou should file a bug or add a 'me too' to an existing one.\n", "Q: Notification for additional drivers Today I installed Ubuntu 11.10 in my HP laptop well everything goes well installation and updates.\nI then got a notification on the taskbar for additional drivers: No propritery drivers are in use on this system.\nWhat I read on the tool that opens after clicking the message is:\n\nProprietry driver do not have public source code that ubuntu developer\n  are free to modify security updates and correction depend solely on\n  the respnsiveness of the manufacture ubuntu cannot fix or improve\n  these drivers.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*ATI/AMD proprietry FGLRX graphic driver( post release update)\n  2.ATI/AMD proprietry FGLRX graphic driver\n  \n  \n  ATI/AMD propreitry FGLRX graphics driver(post release update)\ntested by ubuntu developers\nLicense propreitry\n3D accelerated propreitry graphic drivers for ATI cards.\nThis driver is required to fully utilise the 3D potential of some ATI\n  graphic and as well as provide 2D accelerate newer card.\n\nDo I need to active this driver in order to accomplish the complete installation?\n\nA: Ubuntu, by default, installs the open-source driver for your video card; the dialog you saw suggests you to install the proprietary closed-source driver provided by Ati. So, it is not necessary for you to do this operation, until you are not experiencing graphic problems with the open-source driver or if you don't have particular needs (the open-source driver often doesn't offer 3D acceleration for most video cards, then if you need it, you can try installing the proprietary driver).

System Settings comes with the installed OS, see screenshot.\nEdit 02: You also could install sudo apt-get install gnome-shell, which allows you, to boot into Ubuntu Unity, as you do right now, but also Unity 2d, Gnome-Shell, Gnome-Shell-Classic etc.., to see if the problem is solved there, or at least if the system settings are working properly. (Referring to your other comment, that \"System Settings -> Screen\" is missing the brightness-slider). \nI am glad, that it worked out for you in the end, even if it is not clear to both of us why!

(Please help me improve this, my interpretation of Tuminoid's answer does not work.)\nNote: Everyone must have a reason for doing this.  To give meaning to the following two Step-by-Step Solutions, I'll describe my purpose for wanting to have upstart scripts decided at boot.\nI am creating a Live DVD for surfing the Internet called Surfer.  For security, I want to disable the admin account and leave a non-privileged account for surfing the web.  I also want to give myself and users the ability to remaster Surfer so they can add more online apps and customise their Surfer account, then burn their own live custom Surfer iso.  So I will need two boot profiles:  Surfer and Remaster.  One for secure online surfing, the other for remastering and development.\nLumbric's Solution\nCreate a Custom grub File\n1.  To add custom entries to grub, open this file with gedit for editing:\n\ngksudo gedit /etc/grub.d/40_custom\n\nYou will have the right file if you see this text in it:\n#!/bin/sh\nexec tail -n +3 $0\n# This file provides an easy way to add custom menu entries.  Simply type the\n# menu entries you want to add after this comment.  Be careful not to change\n# the 'exec tail' line above.\n\n2.  In another gedit tab, open:\n\n/boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\n3.  In grub.cfg, look for sections that begin with:\n\nmenuentry\n\nChoose the default entry you use for booting.  If you do not know the default entry by looking at this file, then reboot and take a note of the one you pick at boot.  Do not save any changes if you have to reboot to find your default entry.  When you are positive of your default entry, keep note that this is the entry to use for your custom profiles.\nEach menuentry section will have some corresponding set of brackets:\n\nmenuentry ...text left out... {\n  ...text left out...\n\n}\n\n\nthat encapsulate a few lines of text.  Copy the your default entry section.  Copy from the word menuentry to the closing bracket.  I will need two entries, so I will paste my default entry twice.\nIt should look something like the following for two custom boot profile entries. (Keep in mind I took out text to make this easier to read):\n#!/bin/sh\nexec tail -n +3 $0\n# This file provides an easy way to add custom menu entries.  Simply type the\n# menu entries you want to add after this comment.  Be careful not to change\n# the 'exec tail' line above.\n\nmenuentry ...text left out... {\n    ...text left out...\n\n}\n\nmenuentry ...text left out... {\n    ...text left out...\n\n}\n\n4. Find your boot line by pressing ctrl + f.  Type in the search field:\n\nlinux /boot\n\nEach boot line will should be highlighted.\n5.  Cut and paste this text at the end of the highlighted boot line, but change the number for each entry.\n\nboot-profile=1\n\nAfter pasting, the menu entry should look similar to this:\nmenuentry ...text left out... {\n    ...text left out...\n    linux /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.35-22-generic root=UUID=66cdrfwec91-0070-32f-b666-c9f2232j23232j ro quiet splash boot-profile=1\n}\n\nmenuentry ...text left out... {\n    ...text left out...\n    linux /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.35-22-generic root=UUID=66cdrfwec91-0070-32f-b666-c9f2232j23232j ro quiet splash boot-profile=2\n}\n\n6.  Now, we will edit the line we see at boot.  For the menu entry identified above, edit the text that is between the word menuentry and the first bracket.  Replace with the text Surfer:\nmenuentry \"Surfer\" {\n    ...text left out...\n    linux /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.35-22-generic root=UUID=66cdrfwec91-0070-32f-b666-c9f2232j23232j ro quiet splash boot-profile=1\n}\n\nDo the same for Remaster entry:\nmenuentry \"Remaster\" {\n    ...text left out...\n    linux /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.35-22-generic root=UUID=66cdrfwec91-0070-32f-b666-c9f2232j23232j ro quiet splash boot-profile=2\n}\n\n7. Save the file 40_custom.\n8. Now, update grub with this command:\nsudo update-grub\n\nNote:  If you do any upgrading or installation of programs that modify your kernel, be aware of lumbric's point made in his link.  How can we know if our kernel is going to be upgraded?  Help me clarify how we can prevent upgrading our kernel without knowing it.\n9.  Reboot.  When at the boot menu, look for your new entries.  If you see them, things are going great so far.  Choose one of your custom entries and hit enter.\n10.  When logged in, open up Terminal.  Enter this command.\n\ncat /proc/cmdline\n\nGrub writes the boot line to this file.  The boot line is where you added boot-profile=1 at the end.  So, if you chose surfer, then it should read boot-profile=1 at the end or boot-profile=2 if you chose Remaster.  If not, reread from step one and correct any logical errors.\n11.  Now, the script must be written that will handle the boot entry chosen from grub menu.  I'm choosing to use an upstart script, because I know how to do that.  The upstart will start as soon as possible, check the contents of /proc/cmdline and use that to determine our choice at the boot menu.  Here is the upstart start script:\n\n/etc/bootChoice.conf\n\n12.  Past the following text in:\ntask\nstart on startup or bootChoice\n\nscript\n\nprofile=$(cat /proc/cmdline |sed 's/.*boot-profile=\\([0-9]\\).*/\\1/g')\n\ncase $profile in\n   1)\n      # Run script for Surfer Profile\n      initctl emit surferboot\n      ;;\n   2)\n      # Run script for Remaster Profile\n      initctl emit remasterboot\n      ;;\n\n   *)\n      echo Error\n      echo \"Error\" > /error\n      ;;\nesac\n\nend script\n\n13.  Now, a signal will be emitted based on our choice.  In order to handle each signal, two files must be created.  One called: surfer.conf and another called remaster.conf.  Place them in /etc/init/.  Their contents will be similar to this:\n# surfer user boot\n\ntask\nstart on surferboot\n\nscript\n    echo \"surfer test-data\" > /home/surfer/surfer\nend script\n\nWe can see that when the surferboot signal is emitted, that the script above is started determined by this line: start on surferboot Place all custom boot script code between script and end script.  Same thing will be done for Remaster.\nI tried this, it works.  Thanks Lumbric.\nTuminoid's Solution\nFirst, we must let grub know we want to call a script.  We will place the path of the script inside /etc/default/grub.\n1.  Open the file: /etc/default/grub.\n\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\n2.  Add this line at the end of the file:\n\ninit=/sbin/preinit\n\n3.  Save and exit.  Then, run this command:\n\nupdate-grub\n\nNow we will create the file that we made grub aware of.\n4. Create the file with gedit:\n\ngksudo gedit /sbin/preinit\n\n5. Paste the following text inside:\n\n#!/bin/sh \nEVENT=\"startup\" \nwhile [ /bin/true ]; do   \n  echo \"Select boot:\"   \n  echo \" 1) Surfer\"   \n  echo \" 2) Remaster\"   \n  echo \"\"   \n  read selection   \n  case \"$selection\" in \n1)   \n  EVENT=\"surfer\"   \n  ;; \n2)   \n  EVENT=\"remaster\"   \n  ;;\n*)   \n  ;;   \n  esac \ndone\n\nexec /sbin/init --startup-event=$EVENT\n\n\n6. Make the script executable:\n\nchmod +x /sbin/preinit\n\nWIP NOTE: I've tried this up to this point and it does not work.  Please help improve this interpretation of the answer by pointing out where I am going wrong.\nLast Section: This section unfinished.  Waiting for clarity on first steps to finish.\nThe events above are upstart signals.  If you haven't used upstart signals, they will call a script in the directory: /etc/init.  So, I will make two files in /etc/init called:\n/etc/init/surfer.conf\n\n/etc/init/remaster.conf\n\nIn these files I will use bash scripts to configure each boot.\nI will create at upstart /etc/gdm/custom.conf to force an auto-login if Surfer is chosen.  I will also open /etc/shadow and disable remasters password.\nAlternatively, I will create /etc/gdm/custom.conf for a forced auto-login to the user remaster for remastering and development.\n\nA: To catch a Shift key down event during boot seems to be an interesting task, but I have to no idea how to achieve this. But I described in a recent Q&A how to use the GRUB menu in order to run different start up scripts after login.\nThe script from Step 3 is meant to run after login, but it can be placed also in /etc/rcXY.\n\nA: You cannot do that for an Upstart script. They are non-interactive by nature.\nWhat you could do is make a Grub menu entry that points to a a shell script as an init, prompt you for a type of boot you want (or interact with you in anyway you like) and then at the end do exec /sbin/init --startup-event=<type of boot>. This causes Upstart's startup event be something else than startup and you can build your boot-up to whatever you like.\nFor example, put something like this into /sbin/preinit:\n#!/bin/sh \nEVENT=\"startup\" \nwhile [ /bin/true ]; do   \n  echo \"Select boot:\"   \n  echo \" 1) Normal\"   \n  echo \" 2) Minimal\"  \n  echo \" 3) Foobar\"  \n  echo \"\"   \n  read selection   \n  case \"$selection\" in \n2)   \n  EVENT=\"minimal-startup\"   \n  ;; \n3)   \n  EVENT=\"foobar-startup\"   \n  ;;\n*)   \n  ;;   \n  esac \ndone\n\nexec /sbin/init --startup-event=$EVENT\n\nUsing this solution, you don't need to copy /etc/init around, but can have nice static set of jobs, that just execute based on different start signal.\n", "Q: Can't remove   libreoffice3.5-dict-de   package I just installed the wrong version of LibreOffice (x86 instead of 64bit).

It seems odd that you can highlight the icons but pressing them has no effect. Is this behaviour normal, a bug, or a slight design flaw? I only noticed because I wanted to shut down when previewing the open windows and couldn't click on the panel power icon.\n\nA: What you have noticed is by design and has not changed in recent ubuntu versions.\nThe preview is infact a Compiz overlay on the desktop - the purpose of which is simply to allow you to select the window that you want to bring to the foreground.\nThe icon highlighting is due to the underlying icons responding to a mouse-over event.  The overlay itself is taking control of mouse-click events - specifically for the windows in the expo mode.\nIf you want to discuss this further, I would suggest an IRC chat on the #ubuntu-devel channel or a brainstorm suggestion.\n", "Q: apt-get doesnt download files from NFS location I have switched to unix from last 3 months and trying to understand install process and in particular apt-get. \nI am able to successfully install and download the packages when I configure my repository on http location in /etc/apt/sources.list file. e.g.\ndeb http://web.myspqce.com/u/eng/rose/debian-mirror-squeeze-amd64/mirror/ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ squeeze main contrib non-free\n\nThis command will download(/var/cache/apt/archive) and install the package when i use apt-get install \nWhen I change the source location to file instead of http(nfs mount point), the package is getting installed but NOT getting downloaded in /var/cache/apt/archive. \ndeb file:/deb_repository/debian-mirror-squeeze-amd64/mirror/ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ squeeze main contrib non-free\n\nPlease let me know if there is any configuration or settings that i have to make to let apt-get to both download and install package when i use (nfs)file:/ instead of http:/ in sources.list. \nTo achieve this, I can use apt-get --downlaod-only and then use apt-get install for both download and install in two separate calls, but I want to know why package is not getting downloaded with apt-get install but only getting installed when used with file:/ in sources.list\n\nA: deb-file is mainly used for CDROMs, so downloading them into a cache makes no sense.\nUse deb-copy instead. \nSource: $ man sources.list\n", "Q: Is it possible to use 'dch -r' but NOT end up in an interactive editor?

Occasionally, I receive unwanted emails, particularly low-volume spam, or email messages falsely addressed to me (possibly due to typos). I don't want to spend the energy to write a personal message, but I do want to let the sender know that the message never arrived at its destination, and that resending it will be useless.

It's a script that runs every time you launch the terminal, and when you log in with ssh a similar file may be executed on the remote machine.\nThere should be an unmodified default system version of .bashrc in /etc/skel/.bashrc that you can compare with the one in your home directory (~/.bashrc) to see what changes have been made, if any, to the local file.\n\nA: I had set Python 3.6 as the default with\nsudo update-alternatives --config python3.\n\nI changed it back to 3.5 and just use the 3.6 Interpreter in PyCharm.

Mind you, I am working from a Linux Mint AMD64 OS using Cinnamon. This should work with most Linux 64-bit distributions and GUI types.\nOften times in the answers online for terminal failure questions are listed terminal commands, however, it's hard to use terminal commands with no terminal, right? You will need a shell/terminal-emu/CLI to run said commands so use your package manager (Synaptic, etc.) to download xterm/uxterm terminal emulators. You can also use your file manager (Nemo, Nautilus, etc. to do some of these fixes) and finally you can run some commands using Alt+F2.\nAnyways. Do:\n\n\n*\n\n*The widely used approach available immediately on most Google searches is this: to remove ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal. Here's how:  \ncd ~/.gconf/apps\nsudo rm -r ./gnome-terminal\nreboot\n\n(or possibly, Alt+Ctrl+F1 and then log back in and do sudo apt-get update if you don't want to reboot)\n\n*Another approach is to reinstall gnome-terminal and it's dependent gnome-terminal-data. Please read the commands being as you can't simply apt-get remove it most of the time.\nsudo apt-get remove --purge gnome-terminal gnome-terminal-data\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome-terminal \n\nUsing the often left out --purge command was the only thing that worked for me when I got the point of needing to do this. --purge additionally removes the configuration files together with the package. If you've tried to change those files and failed this will work.\n\nNote:  Several package managers do not list gnome-terminal or will not work installing it after it's marked.  I personally haven't had any luck in doing so.\n\n\n*You can find the website of your distribution, find the gnome-terminal package listed there and manually download and install using your package-installer or by hand.  (e.g. GDebi Package Installer and Aptitude Install).  This method didn't work for me but after doing some research it can, depending on the reason your terminal is toasted. I find this method the most ineffective for most of the common reasons gnome-terminal auto-closes or simply never opens for because that package will often ask for dependencies you already have or don't exist (I don't know why).\n\n*If you've recently changed your terminal preferences, attempted to change the background color or attempted to log history/script your terminal there is sometimes a final option. Inside your Terminal>Profile Preferences>Command un-check all the boxes and be sure the drop-down menu reads \"Hold the terminal open\".  This worked for me, actually. My terminal was set to a profile that had a no-user-input-required command running, followed by an auto-exit terminal on the drop down preferences. (ex. ls, script, history, cd /, anything that doesn't require you to put something else in after it's run)\nI hope this helps some of you guys who are having this problem!

I am supposed to send some artwork to the printers tomorrow and their guidelines requires it to be CMYK.\nI have installed the plugin Separate+ from the 'gimp-plugin-registy' package. I have also installed some ICC colour profiles from the 'icc-profiles' package.\nWhen I try to use the Separate+ plugin all I can get it to output is an image that looks like the original but with the colours inverted.\nHow can I convert my image to CMYK?\n\nA: Have you tried this:\n\nSeparating an image:\nTo convert an RGB image to CMYK format, bring up the right-button\nmenu, and go to \"Image->\"  If the plugin in installed correctly, there\nwill be a new menu, \"Separate\".  From this new menu, select \"Separate\n(normal)\"; you will be prompted to select an RGB source profile, and a\nCMYK destination profile.   If you have installed the Adobe and sRGB\nprofiles as per the instructions in the archive, you can just accept\nthe defaults for testing, otherwise you'll have to locate the profiles\nmanually.\nA new image will be created with four greyscale layers, named \"C\",\n\"M\", \"Y\", and \"K\".\nIf you have loads of memory to spare, you can use the \"Separate\n(colour)\" option; this will perform the same operation, but the new\nimage will contain five layers: The first, \"Background\" will be white,\nand the other four will be solid Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black, with\nthe separated image data in layer masks.  In addition, the layer modes\nfor the four colours will be set to \"Darken Only\". This gives a rough\nreconstruction of the colours, and is the next best thing to a true\nCMYK painting mode, since you can paint on the layer masks, and see\nthe results in realtime.\nNEW for 0.3 - the \"primary\" colours chosen for the \"Separate (colour)\" mode are now much more akin to the primaries used in\nprinting, which are nowhere near as bright, saturated and downright\nlurid as pure screen Cyan and Magenta!  This gives a far more\nrealistic preview of the colours.\n\nsource : here\n\nA: I realize this is an old question, but I just stumbled upon it and found the answer. After you separate the image into the CMYK channels, you get a .tif image with 4 layers (one for each color). This image looks inverted because each area where this is white/grey represents a certain amount of cyan, magenta, yellow, or black.\nOnce you have this, just go to Image -> Separate -> Export and export your image as a .tif. This will repackage your image with the CMYK profile you choose, and when you view it, it will be the right print colors.\nYou can also use Image -> Separate -> Proof, and select the color profile of your monitor and it will generate a .tif preview with all the right colors. It's a pretty nice plugin!\n\nA: The Separate+ plugin for GIMP:\nLoad your file into GIMP.\nMake sure to save the file separately as flattened.\nMake sure you have registered any color profile you want to use (icc).  If you have an ICC file you want to use; before you startup GIMP, right-click on it and the Windows XP menu will say \"Install Profile\" ... click that.\nBack to GIMP...\nClick on Image > Separate\nClick on Separate in the menu...\nIn the first dropdown click on your source (sRGB) more than likely.\nIn the second dropdown click on the ICC that you want to use or provide the path.\nClick on Rendering Intent to select \"relative colorimetric\"\nThen just Click OK.\nYou will get four layers, C, M, Y and K\nYou can see it all put back together by Clicking Image > Separate > Separate then Proof\nIf satisfied, you are ready to go.\nClick on Image > Separate > Separate and then Export.\nThis you can use to combine all to CMYK format and save as a .tif.\nThat is it in a nutshell with some variances...\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I gave up on Gimp as far as converting to cmyk - just install Krita its also open source and free. I no longer require photoshop. I use Affinity Publisher and will probably purchase Affinity Photo as well but for what I require now Krita works just fine. I simply added the cmyk profile I need, which is so simple to do in Krita. \n\nA: Super easy with ImageMagick (preinstalled in every Ubuntu):\nconvert input.jpg -colorspace cmyk -compress LZW output.tif\n\nNote: the exported file would be quite large (no matter the tool), so it's better to include compression - for TIFF the most widely used is LZW.\nMore info e.g. here.\n", "Q: Change icons in Unity 2D I have tried getting icons in Ubuntu 12.04 2d, by putting them in the /.icons folder and using \"Ubuntu Tweak Tool\". \nIt doesn't work (This didn't work in 11.10 either so I think it isn't a bug). \nThey don't show up in the icons drop down menu.

What can i do?\n\nA: Echoing stuff directly to the printer's USB port device sounds troublesome. You may not have permission to write to it  (can you post output of ls -la /dev/usblp0?). Or it may be locked by the printing daemon. Any of these things may have changed from 11.04 to 11.10; stable interfaces are provided farther up the stack, like the lpr command which has been present for decades and shields you from iffy low-level printing stuff like ports and formatting languages and even location of the printers.\nAny reason why you're not using echo \"it's working\" |lpr instead?

This can be undone by pressing your wifi activator key. It differs on different computers. But to check, open your terminal crlt+alt+t. Then press rfkill list (Description of rfkill: rfkill - tool for enabling and disabling wireless devices). It will show weather or not your wifi and LAN is either hard blocked or soft blocked. Hard blocked is when the wifi (for example) is blocked by a physical button/switch. Soft block is when it was blocked virtualy though the OS. Before you try and reboot and press the wireless button to activate it, try using the following command: rfkill unblock wifi then check if it is blocked. Use rfkill list to check if its block on unblocked afterwards. This is what my rfkill list look like when everything in unblocked: \nIf it is hard blocked, just reboot and press the wireless botton.\n\nA: So, the problem is that the X121e BIOS is unbelievably buggy.

These are just a few examples that new users are interested in, but when they start their Ubuntu, there's nothing telling them \"Hey, did you know you can do this and that?\"\nIf it's not possible to get these tips, do you know anything else that new users could use to \"discover\" their new OS?\nThank you in advance for the tips!\n\nA: Better yet, they can take the Ubuntu online tour and see the OS and the programs tips and graphical usability of Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How do I disable pop-up windows? Ubuntu displays a variety of pop-up windows (including keyring manager, update manager, upgrading windows, etc.).  I would like to not have any pop-ups on my screen. Is there a general way to disable all of them?\n\nA: Well I think this should disable the annoying update pop-up:\ngsettings set com.ubuntu.update-notifier auto-launch 'false'\n\nRegarding the previous answer (and in particular the \"Updates are important.\" comment), there are many MANY reasons for wanting to disable intrusive applications.  I hardly think it is necessary to lecture the Op.  As an example: I for one find this update pop-up very annoying on my mythtv set-up as it not only blocks the screen but is modal.\n\nA: \"popups\" is not a general class of application, so no, there is no general way to prohibit applications from displaying windows when necessary. \nUpdates are important. That is why they are being shown. There is no configuration option to neglect security. However, you can configure it to automatically install updates if you want to. You do that in Software Center. You'll find it in Edit > Software Sources > Updates. \nSimilarly, the keyring must be unlocked for you to use passwords stored in the keyring. The primary keyring should be unlocked automatically on login, and won't be displayed. If you have other keyrings, then you'll need to unlock them before you can use them. \nI don't know what you mean by \"upgrading windows\". \n", "Q: How can a gamepad control THE mouse?

This would avoid the cursor to move a bit when you don't use the gamepad but it is still enabled.\n\nA: I've tried the xboxdrv and it kind of worked but it was never perfect for me and I had to manually configure the config file.

In the ~/.config/ubuntuone/syncdaemon.conf file you can add the following:\n[__main__]\nignore = \\A.*\\.metadata\\Z\n\nThis should keep the .metadata folder from being synchronized.

How can I reclaim them?\nHelp is greatly appreciated.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Something there suggests to me that you created the partitions and picked one of the automatic options in the installer, which went on to further subdivide the space of a new partition. It's just a theory and I've no idea why there are three swaps.\nThis is the second post like this I've seen recently. There's rarely a good reason to set your own partitions; let the installer handle all that, that's what it's there for.\nPersonally if I'd just done this I'd boot back to the LiveCD, delete all the Linux partitions and ask the installer to just automatically install into the free space. I'd do this because installing Ubuntu takes about three seconds. Moving partitions around takes a lot longer and is much riskier.\n", "Q: How do I demand a password on single user mode? I have learned that I can boot into single user mode (or whatever it's called) by hitting Ctrl+e in the Grub2 menu and adding single to the correct line in the boot script. This is all good - it's saved me a bunch of times when I screwed something up :P\nHowever, I've noticed that when I do this, I get root access basically for free - I never have to enter a password or otherwise prove my identity. This feels unsafe - the keyboard command to edit the boot script is common knowledge, so anyone with access to my computer can just turn it off (forcibly, if needed, via the power button) and on again, edit the boot script and have root access to my computer.\nI don't want that.\nWhat do I need to configure in order to force a password for single user sessions?\n(I'ts probably not relevant, but I've set my startup options so that I boot straight into the desktop, skipping the login screen. This is OK, since I still need to type a password to sudo, but I don't like the idea of giving anyone root access that easily...)\n\nA: If you set a password for the root user, that password will be required also to login in single-user-mode.\n\nA: There is a fairly thorough guide on adding a password to grub on UbuntuForums.\nThere are probably other options tailored toward the single user prompt but however you handle things there, it's not really security. Somebody could just stick a Live stick or CD in and they suddenly have root access and all your data. Or the could pull the disk (takes seconds) and plug it into another computer.\nLet's be paranoid for a minute. Consider how long it would take to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take the side off your computer,\n\n*Remove the cables from the drive,\n\n*Plug in a SATA->USB adapter to bridge the drive to a laptop,\n\n*Mount the drive\n\n*Change whatever you want\n\n*Unmount and replace original cables and PC case.\n\n\nWith physical access, I reckon I could access your data and disappear within two minutes. Perhaps a little longer if it's a laptop with 200 screws between me and the disk. If you're carrying valuable, sensitive data around (or leaving it on an unattended desktop), that should be a scary thought.\nThe best deterrent is full disk encryption via something like LUKS:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to truly secure a hard-drive?\nEven if somebody tries something, it's a nightmare to decode (remember that if you don't do backups - standard data-recovery techniques will not work). They won't have time to do anything on site, a disk clone takes hours for most disks and even if they just lift the disk, that gives you the opportunity to run around changing passwords, accounts, etc that may be made insecure by the data on that disk.\n\nA: Full disk encryption with a key-file on a thumbdrive would do it as long as you don't leave it plugged in.  \nLocking grub is covered here.  I don't believe in locking grub since all it takes is a live DVD/CD/Thumbdrive.  \n", "Q: Ralink rt3090 driver installed and wireless doesn't work on Ubuntu 10.04 I have a LG A-410 lap-top (64 bits) with rt 3090 wireless card.

If you want persistent changes, you can add lines to /etc/fstab to mount persistent hard drive partitions. For example, if you wanted everything under /home to be persistent, you would make a partition of the hard drive (say /dev/sda1) and add this to /etc/fstab:\n/dev/sda1 /home ext3 defaults 0 0\n\nYou'll likely want to check up on the usage of /home now and again, but if it fills up it will not prevent the system from booting.\n\nA: I could suggest all sorts of weird solutions (one that came to mind: create a 250MB file on boot, delete it on shutdown - so there's always 250MB free) but the simple fact is you don't have enough storage space for your installation.\nEither remove some data (and mount it over the network or an external drive) or buy a bigger root disk. 8GB, 16GB USB drives are not expensive and that'll save you faffing around with this every time it topples over the 4GB mark.\n\nA: I re-tagged your question with initramfs to get the attention of anyone following that tag. Booting the OS to RAM (all the time) would certainly solve your problem, if your hardware can support this. Based on your choice of storage I'd venture to say this is an embedded system which might not have enough RAM to do a RAM drive, but I'll leave that to them to decide.\n\nA: May be there are certain areas in your system that you won't need after restart. If you mount them as tmpfs then at every restart that tmpfs will be free. You will have to study both \"Mounting tmpfs\" and \"Areas which might not affect if not saved at reboots\"\n", "Q: Is there any faster way to remove a directory than \"rm -rf\"? I have a folder that has many files and \"rm -rf\" takes a lot of time to complete. Is there any faster way to remove a directory and it's contents (subdirs, etc)?\n\nA: You could try unlinking the inode for the directory but that would leave you with a whole load of orphan files that fsck will  flip out about.\nrm is as good as it gets.\n\nA few people are mentioning edge cases where some things are faster than others. But let's make sure we're comparing the best versions of the same things.\nIf you want to delete a directory and everything in it, I'm suggesting you:\nrm -rf path/to/directory\n\nrm will internally list the files and directories it's going to delete. And that's all in compiled C. It's those two reasons it's fastest.\nThis is very pointedly not the same thing as rm -rf path/to/directory/* which will expand at shell level and pass a load of arguments into rm. Then rm has to parse those and then recurse from each. That's much slower.\nJust as a \"benchmark\" that compares find path/to/directory -exec {} \\; is nonsense. That runs rm once per file it finds. So slow. Find can xargs-style build commands arguments with -exec rm {} + but that's just as slow as expansion. You can call -delete which uses an internal unlink call to the kernel (like rm does) but that'll only work for files at first.\nSo to repeat, unless you throw the disk into liquid hot magma, rm is king.\n\nOn a related note, different filesystems delete things at different rates because of how they're structured. If you're doing this on a regular basis you might want to store these files in a partition formatted in XFS which tends to handle deletions pretty fast.\nOr use a faster disk. If you have tons of RAM, using /dev/shm (a RAM disk) could be an idea.\n\nA: I think the issue is that there is no perfect way to remove a very large directory and its entire set of contents with out a true indexed filing system that understands unlinking and doesn't mean it thinks it has missing files ala FSCK.  There has to be a trust.\nFor instance I have zoneminder running for a golf range.  I constructed a linux raid of 1.5 TB to handle the immense amount of data she captures a day ( 12 camera feeds ) how she ran on 120 GB drive is beyond me.  Long story short the folder for all the captured data is about 1.4 TB of her storage.  Lots to purge\nHaving to reinstall ZM and purge the 1.4 TB old library is no fun because it can take 1 - 2 days to delete the old images.\nA true indexed FS allows the drop of directory and knows that data under it is dead and the zero'ing out the data is a waste of our time and PC resources.  It should be an option to zero out deleted data.  RM just takes to long in the real world on ext4.  \nAnswer:\nRecursively unlinking all files would be faster marginally but you would still have to set aside a time to run FSCK.\nCreate a script running a recursive \"FOR\" command that can \"unlink\" all files under your folders then just rm or rmdir all folders to clean it up.  Manually run FSCK to zero out the rest of the data when its convenient.  Kinda lazy didnt write it out sorry :).\n\nA: If you don't need the free space the quickest way is delay the deletion and do that in the background:\n\n\n*\n\n*mkdir .delete_me\n\n*mv big-directory-that-i-want-gone .delete_me\n\n\nThen have a crontab that does it in the background, at a quiet time, with a low I/O proiority:\n3 3 * * * root ionice -c 3 nice find /path/to/.delete_me -maxdepth 1 ! -name \\. -exec echo rm -rf \"{}\" +\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*check your output before removing the echo in the crontab!\n\n*the .delete_me directory has to be in the same filesystem - in case it's not obvious to everyone.\n\n\nUpdate:\nI found a neat trick to run multiple rm in parallel - this will help if you have a large disk array:\nionice -c 3 nice find target_directory -depth -maxdepth 3 | xargs -d \\n -P 5 -n 5 rm -rf\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-depth to do a depth-first traversal. \n\n*-maxdepth to limit the depth of the directory traversal so we don't end up   listening individual files.\n\n*-d \\n to handle spaces in filenames.\n\n*-P and -n handles the degree of parallelism (check manpage).\nref: http://blog.liw.fi/posts/rm-is-too-slow/#comment-3e028c69183a348ee748d904a7474019\nUpdate 2 (2018):\nWith ZFS shipped with Ubuntu 18.04 I use it for everything and I will create a new dataset for any big project. If you plan ahead and do this beforehand you can simply \"zfs destroy\" a filesystem when you are done. ;-)\nI used the instructions from the zfsonlinux wiki to install Ubuntu to ZFS natively:\nhttps://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/wiki/Ubuntu-18.04-Root-on-ZFS\n\nA: Sometimes, find $DIR_TO_DELETE -type f -delete is faster than rm -rf.\nYou may also want to try out mkdir /tmp/empty && rsync -r --delete /tmp/empty/ $DIR_TO_DELETE.\nFinally, if you need to delete the content of a whole partition, the fastest will probably be umount, mkfs and re- mount.\n\nA: Albeit not useful if you want to purge an existing directory, I'll mention that a possible strategy if you know you will have a directory with a lof of files which you will need to purge regularly is to put the directory on its own filesystem (e.g., partition). Then when you need to purge it, unmount it, run a mkfs, and remount it. For example OpenBSD advises to do this for /usr/obj, where many files are created during a build of the system, and must be deleted before the next build.\n\nA: The fastest way to delete all files and folders recursively that I was able to come up with is (it's faster than everything posted here, so definitely faster than rm -rf):\nperl -le 'use File::Find; find(sub{unlink if -f}, \".\")' && rm -rf *\n\nA: I've created a multi-threaded replacement for rm with the sole purpose of being the fastest way to delete files, period. In my benchmarking, the worst it performs is 20% faster than anything else and tends to be 2-3 times faster than rm.\nThe tool: https://github.com/SUPERCILEX/fuc/tree/master/rmz \nBenchmarks: https://github.com/SUPERCILEX/fuc/tree/master/comparisons#remove\n", "Q: IPV6 auto configuration not working In Windows 7, my computer can automatically get a IPV6 global address and use IPV6 network, but in Ubuntu Natty, I can't find out how to let stateless configuration work. \nMy network is a university campus network,so I don't need tunnels.

I'm curious if there's a way to enable the more fun UI features in Ubuntu 11.04 that were available in previous versions.  The effects I'm most curious about is the wobbly windows and the alt tab program switcher that looked like a rolodex.  Those things were delightful.  I've been reading about the compiz tool and since I'm a pretty noob user, I don't think I want to risk destroying my desktop for a chance to get these effects back.\nAny help would be appreciated.\nThanks\n\nA: You apparently can enable this feature by installing Ubuntu Tweak and going under Desktop > Compiz Settings > Enable wobbly windows, no CCSM required. You can download an appropriate .deb for Ubuntu Tweak from this Launchpad page (I'd recommend getting the latest Natty .deb, which currently looks like ubuntu-tweak_0.5.14-1~natty1_all.deb).\nNote: I have not tried this solution myself; it may or may not mess Unity up, though I'd assume that if the option is available in 11.04's version of Ubuntu Tweak then it was at least lightly tested to work. I discovered this solution from a screenshot on this blog post.\n\nA: The way I see it, you have three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find another WM that provides the desired effects. AFAIK, Compiz is the only one, but perhaps you'll discover something no one knows about.\n\n*Learn coding and write a WM that supports those effects.\n\n*Magic, many people believe it works.\n", "Q: Difference between Ubuntu and Xubuntu when deploy to Server?

I do a lot of live system building, which eventually involves imaging a USB drive with the built binary image:\ndd if=binary.img of=/dev/sdX\nsync\n\nWhere /dev/sdX is a USB drive. As part of my workflow, I like to have Ubuntu's Disk Utility open so I can verify the drive letter and unmount anything that gets mounted automatically. I also use it to create extra partitions for persistence.\nThe trouble is, after writing the image to the device — and even after the sync operation — Disk Utility doesn't show the new partition. It just shows free space. GParted sees it and fdisk sees it. Even after closing and opening Disk Utility, it still shows only free space.\nIf I click \"Safe Removal\" and physically unplug and replug the USB drive, Disk Utility will then see the partition.\nWhy do I need to remove and re-insert the drive for Disk Utility to see the partitions on it? Can I force Disk Utility to update its information without needing to do this?\n(using Disk Utility 3.0.2 under Ubuntu 11.10.)\n\nA: The kernel probably doesn't know about the change. A good tool which helps in this case is partprobe. Just call it with sudo partprobe. The software will test all drives and if it finds new partitions it informs the kernel. After a successful run you'll see your image instead of free space.\n\nA: I have noticed that in some cases disk information is not changed without restarting system.

It's taking me for ever to do things without trace-backs that used to take just a second.  I'm having to place several file write calls  to track down errors.  What took second to find before with a traceback is turning in to several minutes minutes.   This is miserable.  This has been going on for a few weeks now and I'm sick of it.  would some speak up on this please.  I feel like I'm using assembly without a debugger again.\n\nA: If you use Upstart 1.4 or newer, put console log into your Upstart job and all the output to stdout/stderr will end up to /var/log/upstart/<job>.log. Then you can do tail -f /var/log/upstart/<job>.log & to have the output appear in terminal.\n\nA: There's a whole section on debugging techniques in the Upstart Cookbook. The easiest thing you could do is add --debug to your kernel arguments, which will increase upstart's verbosity and dump everything to syslog.  Yes, debugging is complex, it's a reflection of the net complexity required to create a parallelized init system. I'm sure there's room for improvement.\n\nA: When I write a python daemon I catch all the exceptions and throw then to the log file. I not only use for debug, but in production too. I have a a small script that I run every morning that looks for something upsetting in the logs.\nIt also helps in keeping the daemon running, of course.\nSome sample code (I remove the not interesting parts):\nimport logging\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO,\n                    format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s',\n                    filename=LOG_FILE,\n                    filemode='w')\n    logging.info(\"Sincrod inicializado\")\n    if not DEBUG:\n        daemonize()\n    while True:\n        try:\n            actua()\n        except:\n            logging.error(sys.exc_info())\n        if (datetime.datetime.now().hour > NOITE_EMPEZA\\\n         and datetime.datetime.now().hour < NOITE_REMATA):\n            time.sleep(INTERVALO_NOITE)\n        else:\n            time.sleep(INTERVALO_DIA)\n\nWhere actua() is the real daemon (it writes to log too). Note that I also have a DEBUG variable in a settings file, when it's True, I don't fork the daemon so it's executes on the console.\nDaemons\nDaemons are the unix equivalent to windows services. They are processes that run in the background independent from other processes. That means that their father is usually init, and that they are detached from any tty. As they are independent, there is no predefined place to put their output.\nThere are lots of python libraries and snippets to make a daemon, in the above example I use my own function, that combines some ideas from Steinar Knutsens and Jeff Kunces versions.

Today I tryed my Ubuntu 10.04 with the projector.

On windows all goes well, but I need Ubuntu for personal reasons.\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Your problem sounds very similar to mine.\nMy summary answer is \"trial and error\" (unfortunately).\nMy detailed answer below...\nI've found hit-and-miss detection of projectors after running 12.04 with Nvidia configured with Twinview.\nI run an app called \"disper indicator\" - see this link for more details:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~nmellegard/+archive/disper-indicator-ppa\n(It's not available in the standard repositories).\nThis helps but is not a silver bullet due (I believe) to the underlying nvidia drivers.\nThis app allows me to switch easily between monitors, or to a \"clone\" setup.  \"Clone\" is particularly useful for me as I'm a project manager and I often need to share my screen.\nI also use a web conferencing service who's linux client only works when sharing a single screen.\nAnyway... enough of my use case...\nMy steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect projector\n\n*Select Disper->Monitor Setup\n\n*\n\n*2a. I then select one of the dual screen options.  I don't go straight to clone.  This very often ends up locking up the screen; forcing me to reboot.\n\n\n*If this doesn't work (sometimes my laptop shows it's screen, but not the projector), I then open up \"nvidia-settings\" and just try setting different screen resolutions on the projector screen until it works.  For some reason the auto-detect capability doesn't seem to work too well\n\n*Once I have a working dual screen config, I select \"clone\"\n\n*If this doesn't work - there are two failure modes:\n\n*\n\n*Black screen - hang - requires reboot\n\n*main screen remains the same, projector doesn't display anything.\n\n\n*Regardless of the failure mode, the solution is to get to dual screen again, go to nvidia settings again and manually set the resolution to be the same.\n\n*Sometimes the setting of resoution doesn't work, and I just select a different resolution, hit apply, then select the one I wanted again and hit apply.

I've a Ubuntu Server 11.10 amd64 installation that needed a graphical desktop to execute some visual apps.\nWhile searching for the correct way to achieve this, I noticed that there are a lot of people saying that invoking the gnome desktop installation (apt-get install ubuntu-desktop) would switch from server to desktop kernel. Is this true!? I've checked and the kernel seems to remain unchanged after the install.\nI need to be sure of this because the desktop flavoured kernel doesn't seem to support the ServeRaid 8K controller sitting on my IBM server and I have no idea on how to enable support for it. (I'll be grateful if someone could point me a good guide on how to install ubuntu when the storage controller is not detected)\nAny comment on this matter will be greatly appreciated!\nGood linuxing!\n\nA: We would not expect the kernel to be changed by installing ubuntu-desktop.  The default kernel is typically selected based on the installation media, so if you used an ubuntu-server CD image you would expect to have the server kernel installed.\n", "Q: bad md5sum error when trying to customize ubuntu-keyring-udeb I have been trying to customize Ubuntu 8.04 (hardy heron) alternate install cd.

Stable releases notify me on occasion until I dismiss them and then come back, but I can't figure out when.\nHow does the update manager determine when to prompt users?\n\nA: Update manager is configured not to notify on updates on pre-release versions of ubuntu. This prevents update notifications from occurring all day long due to frequent updates during the pre-alpha through beta phases of a release cycle.\nIt's important to manually update frequently or you won't be able to report issues due to out of date packages.\n", "Q: How do I update banshee to 2.4?

One of my problems is that the mouse cursor only works within the box. How can I make it work both with the actual OS too and the virtual box at the same time?\n\nA: To get your mouse cursor to work, you simply need to press the Ctrl key on the right side of the keyboard. If you don't want to keep pressing Ctrl to release the mouse cursor every time, simply install the VirtualBox Guest Additions by clicking on Devices > Install Guest Additions. When you do this, you may need to mount the virtual cd-rom drive by using the following command:\n$ sudo mount /dev/scd0 /mnt/cdrom\nThen run the shell script to install the Guest Additions.\n\nA: Right CTRL key to release the mouse and keyboard.\nDocumentation on the host key is here. <-- Credit to Takkat on the link  \nInstall guest additions for transitions without manually releasing the keyboard/mouse.  \n\nA: Firstly, do right+ctrl.

By mistake i set CCSM's opacity to 0 so when I run it it looks as if it wasn't open. How to reset it to 100% opaque without resetting compiz???\n\nA: Run gedit ~/.gconf/apps/compiz-1/plugins/obs/screen0/options/%gconf.xml and you should see something like this:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<gconf>\n        <entry name=\"opacity_values\" mtime=\"1332424921\" type=\"list\" ltype=\"int\">\n                <li type=\"int\" value=\"0\"/>\n                <li type=\"int\" value=\"0\"/>\n        </entry>\n        <entry name=\"opacity_matches\" mtime=\"1332424762\" type=\"list\" ltype=\"string\">\n                <li type=\"string\">\n                        <stringvalue>class=Ccsm</stringvalue>\n                </li>\n        </entry>\n</gconf>\n\nNote the first <li> in <entry name=\"opacity_values\" ..> so that it reads <li type=\"int\" value=\"100\"/>.  Save, log out and back in and it should be fixed.\n\nOr you can disable the opacity plugin with one (long) command:\ngconftool-2 --set --type=list --list-type=string /apps/compiz-1/general/screen0/options/active_plugins \"$(gconftool-2 --get  /apps/compiz-1/general/screen0/options/active_plugins | sed 's/obs,?//')\"\n\nThat will need you to log out and in again still.\n\nEdit (this won't work for fixed-opacity windows): The default binding for increasing opacity is Alt-MousewheelUp so you could guess where the window is and try that.\n\nA: Configuration parameters for the CCSM are stored within the ~/.config/compiz/compizconfig.

It's a simple little tool for monitoring resources on a server. It creates graphs (not as pretty System Monitor) and logs things over a long time. It generates static HTML files on a periodic basis (every 5 minutes, IIRC) which you can either browse locally or you can serve via Apache (et al) so you can view the stats over the network.\nYou can see more about munin in another answer of mine.\n\nA: The program sar or atsar also might be helpful. You can start them in a terminal or shell. The option -u shows information about CPU.

It is quite similar to atsar, but is quite more powerful. If you want to get CPU information, enter:\ndstat -c \n\n----total-cpu-usage----\nusr sys idl wai hiq siq\n 17   3  78   2   0   1\n  7   2  88   3   0   0\n  6   2  89   2   0   0\n  5   2  91   2   0   0\n 15   3  79   3   0   0\n 17   3  75   5   0   0\n 21   3  73   3   0   0\n\ndstat has colored output.

It is how it is supposed to be. \nUbuntu protects you from doing things that may be not such a good idea by allowing possibly dangerous actions only to the super user (su...do)  \"root\" who has administrative permission. Creating files or folders outside of our home directory is one of those tasks. Installing software would be another example of what only a super user can do (this effectively keeps malware out).\nAs previous answers already showed it can very easily be done. Nevertheless I suggest you wait a bit, get familiar with the Ubuntu way of doing things, and you will find out that indeed creating files and folders outside our home directories is almost never needed.\nBy doing so Ubuntu will reward you with the joy of having a stable and easy to maintain system where everything stays at the place its supposed to be.\n\nA: As you don't have permission to write to /usr/src the option to create folder within it is disabled.\nYou can do it in command line by executing the mkdir command as root sudo mkdir /usr/src/new_dir or run the file manager as root gksudo nautilus.\n\nA: You are trying to create a folder where you do not have permission to do so. Try creating a folder inside your Home directory, that should work.\nTo create a folder in the directory in the screenshot, you will need to open a terminal.

Both attempts (yep, I've gone thru this twice).  The First time I was able to print just fine, but the scanner didn't work, xsane was complaining about hpaio, etc.\nAfter I installed the ://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/index.html  AllInONE software I was able to print and scan, then something went wrong  (THIS IS THE QUESTION ???)\nALL Print jobs immediately get put in \"HELD\" status, if I \"RELEASE\" them, they immediately go back to HELD.\nCurrently,  I am able to scan (perfectly might I add) without any problems, I installed the HPLIP from ://help.ubuntu.com/community/HpAllInOne  website after following some thread, it appeared that would solve my issues.   \nWorking from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HpAllInOne, I am able to get a clean installed but when I get to the Synaptic steps, I appears to me that HPLIP is installed multiple times as the HP LIP Device manager report software version:3.12.2 Device Mgr: 15.0 (Qt4) while synaptic is reporting:3.11.7-1, which in the synaptic window appear NOT to be installed.

It was installed so I assumed the latter and removed it.  hp-check output didn't change.  \nAfter some run-around (and edits here) I went back to the hp-check output.  In it is a line referring to a permissions error.  I re-ran scanimage -L only t his time, traced it. i.e. # strace -o strace-hp-check hp-check.  Doing this as root and as a user demonstrated differences that got me to re-check group permissions.  \nThe fix is adding the user account name to to /etc/groups, in the line for the lp group.  This is done either with an Ubuntu application specific for editing /etc/group (and /etc/gshadow) and adding the user account name to the line for the lp group.  (Using a comma as delimiter).\nNOTE: The HP installation script may edit the file to add the user account to the lpadmin group.

I'd like to set it as my default font in other linux systems as well.\n\nA: There is no Monospace font. The Monospace that is listed in Terminal is in reality Ubuntu Monospace.

One of the accounts that I have in Gwibber is my Twitter account. It nicely shows every now and then notifications with the new twits.\nWhenever a twit has a link (URL) within it I feel an urge to click on the link withing the notification to directly open it within a browser. However, it seems like notifications are not clickable and when hovering over them they just become opaque.\nIs there a way to make those links clickable?\n\nA: Actually, notify-osd does support this. However, gwibber does not send notifications with the necessary hints to require interaction. And the way notify-osd handles it, may not be what you want. The way this is handled in Unity, is that gwibber adds itself to the Messages indicator, and you click on there to open the gwibber UI, when you get a notification, if you wish to do that.\nTo make gwibber do it, even if you switch to notification-daemon instead of notify-osd, you will need to patch the code in gwibber to add the necessary hints of interactivity, to the notifications themselves.\n\nA: notify-osd doesn't support this (by design). The old notification system (notification-deamon) did support this if the application said it was possible.\nYou can remove nofify-osd and install notification-deamon and (if I'm reading thinsg right) it should just work. Notification Daemon is set to take precedence over NotifyOSD.\nThere is an old thread about needing to play around with /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.Notifications.service but the script now suggest this is all accounted for. I only mention this as a reference if things don't go to plan :)\n\nBut even if you do get it to work, there's no indication that Gwibber's notifications  will be clickable - They may have pulled legacy support for the old notification framework.\n\nA: You should create a new version of notify-osd (the package that shows notifications)\n", "Q: Differences between Gnome Classic Session and Gnome 2? I know Gnome 2 is history but the Gnome Classic session looks (to me) exactly like Gnome 2 i.e. as per \nHow to revert to GNOME Classic Desktop?\nAre there any differences between the two desktop environments?\n\nA: Well there is the obvious answer, that the libraries are very different and often incompatible with each other, but since GNOME 3 uses the newer libraries that is preferable. At this point considering the work that has gone into Gnome Classic for 12.04, I would say no, that there isn't really much of a difference at this point. Maybe a few taskbar applets that haven't been ported yet, but aside from that there isn't really much point in using Gnome 2 anymore.\nArticle here from OMGUbuntu showing the Gnome Classic mode in 12.04\n\nA: There are significantly less panel applets which work with the panel in the GNOME 3.x fallback mode. Some things have been hidden away or removed as well, to try and keep the fallback GNOME session more similar to the new GNOME Shell.\n\nA: As a long term *Nix user that was quite happy with the Gnome 2 desktop (but not it's bugs), I'm pleasantly surprised at the current status of Gnome 3 'Classic'. The difference to me between the two is that the newer version is much less customizable but more stable (my Applets no longer disappear, for instance) and consider that if enough resources are given to the 'new - Classic' (I know), it has the potential to be as good or better than Gnome 2 (or MATE)\n", "Q: What is controlling the desktop display? I have two Ubuntu systems and in the course of changing configurations something has become muddled.\nI have disabled Unity in favor of gnome shell, the older style display of the desktop. Then I installed xfce 4. Seemed everything would be working okay, and for the most part it does.\nExcept I noticed that on one system there's something else controlling settings.\nOn one, if I right click the desktop, I get the menu with the options:\nopen in new window \ncreate launcher... \ncreate url link... \ncreate folder... \ncreate from template ->  \nopen terminal here \npaste \ndesktop settings... \nproperties... \napplications ->\n\nOn system two, right clicking brings up the menu:\nCreate new folder\nCreate new document ->\norganize desktop by name\nkeep aligned\npaste\nChange Desktop Background\n\nAdditionally, even though I set the background with the xfce settings manager, on system two that background will appear for a few seconds before it's replaced by something that looks like a background from Ubuntu's original desktop. And it's being controlled by what comes up with the \"change desktop background\" when right clicking, which isn't the xfce settings manager.\nOn the first system, that right click does bring up the xfce settings tool. \nIn short, something is controlling/overriding the xfce settings on machine two, but I can't find what file or configuration tool is doing it. How can I get system two to behave as system one, giving control of settings and configuration of X to XFCE's tools?\n\nA: XFCE uses more Gnome settings than we'd like to believe. Delete the following directories in your /home/bart directory:\n.config\n.gnome2\n.cache\n\nLog out and log back in.

If I just click on the icon on the dash, it will run without the proper parameter being passed. Is there a way I could customize the Blender launcher on the dash so it would always launch it with the optirun parameter? \nThanks.\n\nA: You can copy the blender.desktop out of /usr/share/applications, and into your ~/.local/share/applications directory, and edit it there to have a different command line. Don't edit the one in /usr/share/applications, as package updates will revert your changes.\n\nA: You could edit its launcher. The launcher configurations sit in /usr/share/applications so you can run sudoedit /usr/share/applications/blender.desktop and change its Exec statement so you end up with something like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Blender\nGenericName=3D modeller\nGenericName[es]=modelador 3D\nGenericName[de]=3D Modellierer\nGenericName[fr]=modeleur 3D\nGenericName[ru]=Редактор 3D-моделей\nComment=3D modeling, animation, rendering and post-production\nComment[es]=modelado 3D, animación, renderizado y post-producción\nExec=optirun blender\nIcon=blender\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=Graphics;3DGraphics;\nMimeType=application/x-blender;\n\nAs dobey suggests, you can also make changes in the user ~/.local/share/applications directory.  This will make the change for only this user, instead of globally (if you have a multi-user system).  Keeping a copy of your changes locally is a good idea if you'd like to make them more upgrade-proof.  Be aware that changes in the local directory won't automatically reflect changes made by upgrades to the main configuration file (for example, arguments to Exec).  \n\nA: You can use Alacarte\nsudo apt-get install alacarte\n\nRun it by typing in terminal\nalacarte\n\nFind your application in appropriate category or add new one and specify command for launching and custom icon.\nNow you can type your application name in dash and launch in with desired parameters.\n", "Q: How to set up passwordless SSH access for root user I need to configure a machine so software installation can be automated remotely via SSH. Following the wiki, I was able to setup SSH keys so my user can access the machine without a password, but I still need to manually enter my password when I use sudo, which obviously an automated process shouldn't have to do.\nAlthough my /etc/ssh/sshd_config has PermitRootLogin yes, I can't seem to be able to log in as root, presumably because it's not a \"real\" account with a separate password.\nHow do I configure SSH keys, so a process can remotely log in as root on Ubuntu?\n\nA: Part 1 : SSH key without a password\nTo set up a passwordless SSH connection for the root user you need to have root access on the server. Easiest method is to temporarily allow root to log in over ssh via password. One way or another you need root access on the server to do this. If you do not have root access on the server, contact the server administrator for help.\nOn the client (where you ssh FROM)\nFirst make a ssh key with no password. I highly suggest you give it a name rather then using the default \nssh-keygen -f foo\n\nThe -f option specifies a file name, foo is an example, use whatever name you wish.\nWhen you are prompted for a password, just hit the enter key and you will generate a key with no password.\nNext you need to transfer the key to the server. Easiest method is to use ssh-copy-id . To do this you must temporarily allow root to ssh into the server.\nOn the server (where you ssh TO)\nedit /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\nMake sure you allow root to log in with the following syntax\nPasswordAuthentication yes\nPermitRootLogin yes\n\nRestart the server\nsudo service ssh restart\n\nSet a root password, use a strong one\nsudo passwd\n\nOn the client :\nFrom the client, Transfer the key to the server\nssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/foo root@server\n\nchange \"foo\" the the name of your key and enter your server root password when asked.\nTest the key\nssh -i ~/.ssh/foo root@server\n\nAssuming it works, unset a root password and disable password login.\nOn the server :\nsudo passwd -l root\n\nEdit /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nsudo nano `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`\n\nChange the following :\nPasswordAuthentication no\nPermitRootLogin without-password\n\nRestart the server\nsudo service ssh restart\n\nOn the client (Test):\nYou should now be able to ssh in with your key without a password and you should not be able to ssh in as any user without a key.\nssh -i ~/.ssh/foo root@server\n\nPart 2 : Running commands via sudo without entering a password\nYou configure sudo to allow you to run commands without a password.\nThis is answered here in two places:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I run specific sudo commands without a password?\n\n*How to run sudo command with no password?\nOf the two, I suggest allowing as few commands as possible (first answer) rather then all commands (second answer).\n\nA: You are confusing two different things:\npasswordless log is used to make sure that people can't log into your system remotely by guessing your password.  If you can ssh username@machine and connect without a password, this is set up correctly, and has nothing else to do with this.\nsudo is used to permit a normal user account to do something with super user permissions.  This does require the user to type their password.  This happens whether you are connected remotely (via passwordless or password-protected SSH) or are local on the machine.  You are trying to set sudo to not ask for your password, which is not recommended, but you can learn how to do that via an answer like https://askubuntu.com/a/74083/6161\nNote to future readers of this answer:\nMy above answer does not answer the original poster's actual question, it describes what you should do instead.  If you really want to allow remote connections directly to the root account, you need to enable the root account (see my comment below).  Again, let me say DO NOT allow remote remote log-ins to your root account.  \n\nA: Q. Login to remote host as root user using passwordless SSH (for example ssh root@remotehost_ip)\nA. In order to login to remote host as root user using passwordless SSH follow below steps.\n1st Step:\nFirst you have to share local user's public key with remote host root user's authorized_keys file. There are many ways to do so, here is one example.\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2\nOr you can simply copy paste your public key content to remote host root user's authorized_keys file.\n2nd step:\nConfigure ssh to permit passwordless login in remote host. Login to remote host and edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config file then restart ssh service. Do not forget to comment out \"PermitRootLogin yes\".\n#vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nPermitRootLogin without-password\nStrictModes no\n\n#service ssh restart\n\nComment out #PermitRootLogin yes\n3rd step:\nTest you connection from your local machine using user whose public key is shared earlier.\n$ssh root@remotehost_ip\n\n\nA: PermitRootLogin controls whether the user named \"root\" (to be precise: any user with UID 0) is allowed to login. If you're logging as root, you do not need sudo to perform privileged tasks.\nOn the other hand, if you to login on a user account and use sudo without a password, you must configure the sudoers file without having to fiddle with /etc/ssh/sshd_config.

I know when I first came to linux this feature existed on most window managers but it seems that it's been slowly disappearing.\nIs there a way to bring this back?\nP.S.

The solution was to boot in recovery mode and select low graphics from the menu to boot in graphic mode or use a console.

I am have a Thinkpad X220T with the multitouch screen. This model comes with two options for the screen, only one has the multitouch capabilities. My question is strictly about touchscreen NOT the multi touch touchpad.\nI found it very hard to find confirmation if multi touch on this model works or not, and if so, how well? So in this question I will focus primarily on how to improve multi touch interaction on this device. I am using Ubuntu 12.04.\n\n\n*\n\n*What are my top options for on-screen keyboard and how can I enable them?\n\n*Can I use multitouch gestures to switch between apps, desktops and zoom in an out of applications while in tablet mode?\n\n*How many touch points are registered by the system at most? How can I test this?\n\n*Is multi touch stack stable enough for daily use?\n\n*How do I get the screen rotation button to work and how do I make pen reference rotate with it, so the pen works correctly in any rotation.\n\n*How can I use multitouch games that are available from the the software repository? On first try, it seems that touch points are not registered correctly by these applications.\n\n\nI will update this question if you require any more information, or tests performed on this laptop.\n\nA: I'm going to try and answer the rotation / touch interface part.\nSo basically you can imagine those like having a second desktop upon your desktop. When you rotate your Desktop, you'll then have to do the same with the Touch Interface Desktop.\nIn general you can manage this rotation via\n$ xsetwacom\n\nIn my case - I have no knowledge of other tablet devices - the touch desktop consists of three devices: Stylus, Eraser and Touch:\n$ xsetwacom --list devices\nWacom Serial Penabled 2FG Touchscreen stylus    id: 14  type: STYLUS    \nWacom Serial Penabled 2FG Touchscreen eraser    id: 15  type: ERASER    \nWacom Serial Penabled 2FG Touchscreen touch     id: 16  type: TOUCH \n\nSo whereever you rotate you screen you will also have to call xsetwacom for every one of the three devices to reflect the change:\n$ xsetwacom set <device_id> rotate <none|ccw|cw|half>\n\nAppropriate places for touch rotation are everywhere, where there is a rotation made by xrandr. However you cannot directly hook into xrandr, but must find the places where xrandr rotations are called.\nI for example am using the Monitor Status Indicator Extension for the GNOME-Shell, with this modification for touch rotation:\nhttps://gist.github.com/2331837\nGood luck with the rest! ;)\n\nA: Alright, here's my share then :)\nI bought a convertible laptop/tablet half a year ago with a stylus and touch option. Not the same model or even brand as you, but hopefully this answer is still useful to you.\nFor on-screen keyboard I prefer Onboard, which I think comes by default. Otherwise it is available through the repositories. It is quite well customisable (if you put some effort into it you can design your own keyboard layout and themes, or just use the built-in ones) and does pretty much what you need it to do. It lacks advanced stuff such as macro actions. Also, I haven't been able to get it to work in the Dash.\nInteresting multitouch features are available through Ginn, which in my humble opinion is a pretty decent piece of software. It's not the easiest thing to alter but gives you a lot of options by linking gestures with key presses. Two-finger scrolling works by default 9), the things you mention (zooming in and out, swiping through applications) is as far as I know not yet supported. I see you already got your laptop, take a look at /etc/ginn/wishes.xml.\nHmm, come to think of it, if you play around a bit with Ginn and Compiz, perhaps you can bind a two finger pinch to the Enhanced Desktop Zoom plugin?\nmweinelt post on rotation is spot on. Works very well for me. I rotate the screen, get the stylus out and read and annotate PDFs on my laptop.\nAll in all I'd say the touchscreen is usable, even useful, but leaves a few things to be desired. It is most certainly not a slick, neat process as it is with for example Android.\n\nA: To those who still want to use all touch features of their convertibles, here is a script which works well on x220t.\nThe script with which I started is given in the thread above. I just extended it to take values for the stylus in addition to the finger touch. Same approach copy-paste as for the finger, which solves the first issue of Yossi Gil.\nI also bumped into the issue of the onscreen keyboard onboard not working with the finger touch. I followed this thread and implemented the solution which worked there.\nAll in all, finger and stylus touch working, rotation working and onscreen keyboard now working, I would say the tablet mode now works pretty well.\n\nA: I have an x220t myself, but I run Ubuntu 11.10 on it. I solved the rotate problem using this tutorial. This tutorial teaches you how to create a script which also rotates the axes of the screen, not only the image. (rotation of the image itself is quite easy, you can do it from the monitors menu). But in order for the trackpad, eraser tip, mouse and stylus to work on a rotated screen, you need to also rotate the axes (see the tutorial mentioned).\nHowever, one problem with that tutorial was that each time I was plugging a new usb device (wireless mouse base, camera, etc) the usb port physical address got changed after restart.\nSo, I asked for a solution and I had this problem solved here\nwith a small addition to the script.\nI'm interested to find how can I activate the \"rotate\" button on the bottom edge of the screen and assign the \"rotate\" command described above to it. I tried using the typical \"create button shortcut\" function, but it doesn't seem to work.\nAlso - I am interested in how we can add multitouch functionalities to the screen (pinch, rotate for pictures, right click on long tap, etc).\nStylus works quite well, I did not get any errors in using it.\n\nA: In my experience: NO.\nJust bought X220 tablet, installing 12.04 on it left a lot to be desired.\n\n\n*\n\n*Stylus does not work correct in tablet mode (does not understand rotation)\n\n*No multi-touchg.\n\n*No on-screen keyboard\n\n*Using the stylus may confuse X, in that X thinks you move your mouse while Alt modifier is down, when in fact it is not.\n\n\nI tried using this new toy with Windows 7, which provides much better support for tablet and stylus, but it is still far from (say) ipad.\nOne nice thing though is that I am no longer cautious before touching my screen. I know it was designed to be touched.\n", "Q: Dynamic Bind9 + DHCP i have been working on setup a server for my internal network, so far i have a working isc-dhcp-server that can upgrade a chrooted BIND9 (on the same machine), i need to add some static entries on the DNS, so users can resolve the websites that resides in our DMZ.\nWhat i had tryed all ready was to modify the /etc/bind/named.conf.local with this info:\n//\n// Do any local configuration here\n//\n\n// Consider adding the 1918 zones here, if they are not used in your\n// organization\n//include \"/etc/bind/zones.rfc1918\";\n\nkey DHCP_UPDATER {\n        algorithm HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT;\n        secret \"MySuperSecretHash\"; (this is not the real value BTW)\n};\n\nzone \"quality.internal\" IN {\n        type master;\n        file \"/var/lib/bind/quality.internal.db\";\n        allow-update { key DHCP_UPDATER; };\n};\n\nzone \"0.10.10.in-addr.arpa\" {\n        type master;\n        file \"/var/lib/bind/rev.10.10.0.in-addr.arpa\";\n        allow-update { key DHCP_UPDATER; };\n};\n\nlogging {\n        channel query.log {\n                file \"/var/log/named/query.log\";\n                severity debug 3;\n        };\n\n        category queries { query.log; };\n};\n\nthen i added this 2 entries:\nzone \"ourserver.internal\" IN {\n        type master;\n        file \"/var/lib/bind/ourserver.internal.db\";\n};\n\nzone \"0.16.172.in-addr.arpa\" {\n        type master;\n        file \"/var/lib/bind/rev.172.16.0.in-addr.arpa\";\n};\n\nSo.. i created the files ourserver.internal.db and rev.172.16.0.in-addr.arpa placed them BOTH in /var/lib/bind/ and changed the permisions so the bind user can access them, restated the service... when i do a NSLOOKUP www.ourserver.internal i get:\nServer:     127.0.0.1\nAddress:    127.0.0.1#53\n\n** server can't find www.ourserver.internal: NXDOMAIN\n\nBUT when i do a reverse lookup....\n\nServer:     127.0.0.1\nAddress:    127.0.0.1#53\n\n5.0.16.172.in-addr.arpa name = www.ourserver.internal\n\nI do not understand what's wrong.

New to Linux and have just installed Ubuntu 11.10 secured.  Am running Gnome Classic menu but notice that my applications are CLOSING when I minimize them.  Can anyone tell me how to correct this?\n\nA: Well, if you're clicking on the wrong button, then you can correct it by clicking the right one. Literally. In Windows, the close-button is to the right and the minimize button is to the left. Since Ubuntu has those controls on the left side of the window, the close button is to the left and the minimize-button is to the right. \nIs it possible you're just clicking the wrong button? It's the only immediate explanation I can think of. \n", "Q: HP Probook touchpad I wrote about this problem some weeks ago, but now the question is: \"Why is touchpad works not so good as in windows\". I tried some \"experiments\":\nWhen I use windows and if I accidentally touched touchpad - cursor isn't moving, also no clicks occurring. So in windows working with touchpad is quite normal, but in Ubuntu аf I accidentally touch the touchpad even with my wrist - cursor is moving etc. In Windows, the cursor moves only when I touch it with finger. And... If, for example, I hold one finger on touchpad and simultaneously move the second finger on the touchpad - the cursor doesn't move, however in ubuntu he does. He's \"super sensetive\" in ubuntu or what?\nAlso I tried to apply the option in \"Mouse and touchpad\", which called \"Disable touchpad when typing\", but nevertheless he isn't disabling when i'm typing...\nNote: this option is circled in red frame, i dont know is it a good \"sign\" )\nWhat can I do to fix the problem? \n\nA: I have got my solution by installing driver provided by hp. plz have this link for the deb file I have installed.--\n http://ubuntuone.com/07AeUny10786C5SoQjp6wB\n", "Q: I want to record a screencast of a processing sketch I have a created a music visualisation using Processing. I now want to convert that to a video, and the least obtrusive way I could think of is to record a screencast. \nI figured exporting Processing to video including audio, from within Processing itself, on ubuntu seemed an unsolved issue. Very hard and also could cause timing sync issues (since the music keeps running while images are captured). So move on to the screencast method.\nDead-easy, I figured. But I was wrong. First hurdle was to find a way to record the sound from the audio (and not the mic).\nI did find a tutorial for that here.\nIn short: use gtk-recordmydesktop and pulse audio. \nExactly:\n\n\n*\n\n*start PulseAudio\n\n*start gtk-recordmydesktop, and set input from DEFAULT to pulse\n\n*start recording\n\n*see the Recording tab in PulseAudio, and selected Internal Audio (or Monitor)\n\n\nThis works if I record from e.g. my webbrowser playing a youtube movie. I see that appear in the PlayBack tab, and can then easily record it. But not for Processing. Processing is written in java. Processing does not use ALSA but uses the hardware devices directly to create the sounds. When the sound is playing, it does not appear in the Pulse Audio mixer.\nHow can I record the audio now?\n\nA: The solution in the link seems to be working perfectly (if I understood what you asked correctly). Did not even had to change any config in gtk-recordmydesktop to make it work.\nYou don't need to change anything in pavucontrol about Processing since it will not show in the recording tab, you need to change the gtk-recordmydesktop setting to capture your system sounds.\nHere is a quick video on how I did it.\nDon't complain about the music please, my neighbors love it! ;)\n(at least they keep banging of joy on the walls every time I play it loud)\n\nA: I have found that java does not use ALSA but addresses the audio devices directly. Effectively rendering Pulse Audio useless, and thus disabling me to loop the audio back to input for recording. This seemed very hard to circumvent. Further reading learned that this could be related to the JDK in use. So how to circumvent this?\nProcessing is using java. But when java is run in the browser, it does use ALSA. Somehow, the browser-container handles that correctly for you.\nSo the easy solution: export your processing sketch to an applet, play the applet in your browser, and record! :)\nI hope this can help someone else as well.\n\nA: Alsaloop has never ... EVER ... failed me.  It did, last time I checked, require a custom package though\n", "Q: Facebook Scrabble and flash I'm running Ubuntu 11.10 64 bit. I can't get Scrabble Facebook to run in Firefox.

The only way to get more people involved is to spread the word. Get involved in forums, find out if there is a Linux Users Group in your area. Talk to anyone and everyone who will listen. I work at a public university and I have gotten the Computer Science department involved. Another thing you may try is going to a public library or community center. Many of them offer free computer classes. Maybe you could be a guest speaker and just spend a few minutes introducing people to boinc or other open source projects. Write letters. Do whatever it is that you are good at to share the positive uses of this technology. :) \n\nA: I am working at the moment in a Juju Charm for Boinc that automates it's deployment and configuration on the cloud.\nIts still almost nothing but will make things easier for users interested in using Boinc. Have a look here.\nBesides that I know that Boinc has been receiving a lot of heat from Jorge Castro on his page, that is a very good thing.\nUbuntu is the perfect platform for deploying Boinc and the sheer amount of tools and the introduction of it as a charm ready to be deployed will make it much attractive.\nIf you would like to give a hand, or know someone that can give a hand (I have been lazy lazy lazy with it for personal reasons) please feel free to contact me using my email address on the users page.\n", "Q: Is there a congrats ubuntu page? Say for example I use a particular package and want to say \"Way to go maintainers\" is there a way for me to do this?\n\nA: You could host an Ubuntu release party or jump on to IRC and into some of the ubuntu prefixed irc channels and thank people. Thank the devs by talking to them on twitter, etc.\nMany ways.\n\nA: I think your question is a bit open ended and probably more a discussion topic than something we can handle here on AU but I will try to answer the question in the spirit in which you asked with my personal experience.\nA wise man I respect once told me \"Open Source isn't a spectator sport, it's a participatory sport.\" Or something along those lines, I don't remember the exact lines.  Like this site, it's pretty much about paying it forward. \n\n\n*\n\n*Help someone out here.\n\n*or locally. Or anywhere else for that matter.\n\n*or contribute to Ubuntu directly.\n\n\nI can't speak for every Ubuntu developer, but in my experience the best way to say thanks is to help the next person; at the most fundamental level projects that depend on community participation get better with more participation from more people. \n", "Q: can shell themes be used with gnome fallback mode? I was wondering what truly \"gnome fallback\" means in ubuntu? I am using gnome classic, which is lovely, but I wanna install some new themes. Do these themes only work with gnome 3? Do I have to get gnome 3 and then get themes activated in the advanced settings?\nThanks\n\nA: A desktop theme is broken into several components: window decorations, cursor theme, icon theme, GTK theme and the shell theme.\nA shell theme doesn't do anything in a \"Classic\" environment as Gnome Shell isn't running, but you can still use the same window decoration and GTK theme settings. \nI suggest you install gnome-tweak-tool and have a play around with the theme settings.\n", "Q: Updating Banshee to 2.4 I have banshee 2.2.1 with Ubuntu 11.10 \nI have been trying to update banshee to 2.4 (released yesterday) but it just isnt working, I have been using \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:banshee-team/ppa\n\nin terminal, from the Banshee.fm website. but after running through terminal it says this:\n     sudo add-apt-repository ppa:banshee-team/ppa\nYou are about to add the following PPA to your system:\n PPA for Banshee Team\n This PPA contains the latest stable debs of Banshee for Ubuntu.

It worked - but I am not clear what are things that get installed as part of the language pack.\nIn general , the language pack contains only fonts for the new language ? Or, what are the other contents?\n\nA: The language-pack-* packages contain translations for the user interfaces of the various applications found in Ubuntu, mostly in the form of gettext message catalogues.\nIf you configure your user account to use a locale covered by the language pack, the user interface should then be displayed in that language when you next log in (few applications support changing their UI language while they are running).\nIn most cases, you wouldn't install the language-pack-* packages directly, but instead install the corresponding language-support-* package, which will give you other resources used by the language (e.g. spell checking dictionaries).\nIf you want to change the language settings of your Ubuntu system, the easiest method is with the Language Support control panel found under System Settings.\n", "Q: Wireless card unseen by lspci I installed both Ubuntu 8.04 and 10.04.

Should I have to add any metadata to its .desktop file? How do I solve the same more generically - Search not just by application name but by application type and application usage as well?\n\nA: I figured out that when you search in the lens, your term will be used to search for an application or an application with the keyword in the comment.

As long as you DON'T mkfs.ext4 you should be fine.\nYour partition start point needs to be the same as it was or the OS won't know how to interpret what's behind it.  The end point can then be further along to make a larger partition.\nI think the error in the comment is related to moving the start point.  You need to start it at the exact same point as it was started.  The end point can move around.\nCredit to psusi for suggesting fdisk instead of cfdisk and confirming the start point issue.\n\nA: If you try to delete & recreate a partition, when your partition started below 2048 you might be in for some trouble like I was with resize2fs.\nCouldn't find valid filesystem superblock.\n\nFrom fdisk version 2.17.2, fdisk IIUC forces you to begin from 2048 in order to ensure your hard drive is \"aligned correctly\". So if your original partition started before 2048, you are in for a bumpy ride trying to recreate the partition.\nBest approach is to rsync when cloning a disk.\n", "Q: Ubuntu on Samsung NP700Z5B - no Grub I just bought a Samsung NP700Z5B laptop.

(like in windows)\n\nA: Yes, log out and select a different desktop. Unity 2D doesn't have compiz running so is faster in some circumstances.\nOr install Gnome Shell (you only need the gnome-panels package in 12.04) and you can select the Classic desktop which is probably even more efficient.\nOr don't use Gnome at all.

I have installed dnsmasq and added nameserver 127.0.0.1 to the resolv.conf file so I can use wildcards in my apache configuration. But every time I restart the computer or change Wi-Fi connection I have to add it again to get it working.\nWhy is this happening and how can I make it work ?\n\nA: If you are running an Ubuntu system prior to 12.04 that hasn't yet been upgraded to 12.04 or later, or if you have removed the resolvconf package then install the resolvconf package.\nsudo apt-get install resolvconf\n\nIf resolvconf was already installed, ensure that /etc/resolv.conf is a symbolic link to ../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf.\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf\n\nOnce you have installed the dnsmasq package (not to be confused with the dnsmasq-base package) you do not need to edit /etc/resolv.conf. The dnsmasq initscript causes (via resolvconf) '127.0.0.1' to be added to resolv.conf when dnsmasq starts, provided the value of IGNORE_RESOLVCONF is not set to yes in /etc/default/dnsmasq.\nDoubters, please read /etc/init.d/dnsmasq.\nP.S. In Ubuntu 12.04 there is a complicating factor. NetworkManager by default starts a dnsmasq process which listens exclusively on 127.0.0.1. This conflicts with the \"standalone\" dnsmasq process; only one of the two can start. This is a known bug, #959037, which was fixed in Ubuntu 12.10 (by moving NM-dnsmasq's listen address to 127.0.1.1). If you are still running Ubuntu 12.04 and you want to run standalone dnsmasq then you should either disable the NetworkManager-controlled dnsmasq (by commenting out \"dns=dnsmasq\" in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf) or configure the standalone dnsmasq not to listen on 127.0.0.1.\n\nA: You need to specify your preferred dns server in Network Manager. Otherwise, it will continue to overwrite the config-file. See What is the proper way to change the DNS IP?\n\nA: Buidling on Egil's answer.

As this has occurred in previous Ubuntu distros Im guess it is somekind of hardware issue. \n\nA: This problem was driving me bonkers too. Finally I went to the Ubuntu Software Center, entered \"touchpad\" in the search box, found \"Synaptiks\" touchpad manager and installed it. Set it to start up at boot. Set it to lock touchpad when typing and set the delay time to 2 seconds. My problem is gone. It was so bad that I was looking for a non Ubuntu based distribution to replace the Ubuntu OS I have been using. Now I am very happy again. The old touchpad manager was supposedly sat to lock the touchpad when typing but it really was not. Good luck. \n\nA: Try this, it worked for me Lenovo thinkpad L460\nsyndaemon -i 3 -d -t -k\n\nsyndaemon monitors keyboard activity and disables the touchpad when the keyboard is being used. \n\n\n*\n\n*-i 3 will wait 3 seconds  after  the  last  key  press  before enabling the touchpad (default is 2.0s).\n\n*-d starts syndaemon at the background.\n\n*-t disables tapping and  scrolling,  not  mouse  movements,  in response to keyboard activity.\n\n*-k ignores modifier keys when monitoring keyboard activity.\n\nA: Changing the cursor theme back to the default Adwaita (theme) in My Unity resolved this along with lowering the pointer speed and sensitivity in system settings >> mouse and touch-pad\n\nA: My cursor does the same thing, though only when I use the LibreOffice Writer.  I found this was due to two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*I do not have the proper keyboard drivers installed (and am having a hell of a time finding them for my Inspiron N5040).\n\n*Turn off the auto-save option in which ever program you are using. I found that solved the problem for me.\n\n\nI also tried turning down the sensitivity on my touch pad but the problem is that the touch pad sensor runs the full length of the keyboard on my laptop, and it might on yours too.\n\nA: I went into activities, entered mouse as the search.  waited like 30 sec. for the search to parse.  settings / mouse & touchpad \nTurned OFF touch to click.  That solved my problem as just brushing the touchpad was being interpreted as a mouse click, causing focus to jump around, selecting text that then gets deleted by the next character, etc.\ncommand line for the gui is:\n$ gnome-control-center mouse\n\nA: On November 2021  I tried the method in the post below, Using Touchpad Indicator utility;\nand it solved the  'cursor jumping randomly' problem :\nhttps://ostechnix.com/how-to-automatically-disable-touchpad-when-typing-in-ubuntu/\nBelow is from the above webpage :\n- Using Touchpad Indicator utility - \n\n\n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:atareao/atareao\n$ sudo apt update\n$ sudo apt install touchpad-indicator\n\nAfter Touchpad Indicator is installed, launch it from Menu or application launcher;   find it ( a little applet icon) on the panel (task bar).\nClick Touchpad Indicator icon >> Choose Preferences  >> Select Actions tab  >> check box \"Disable touchpad on typing\"  >>  Click OK\n** Other info **\n\n*\n\n*Default is 800 ms ( 0.8 seconds); can increase to e.g. 2 or 3 seconds and see how it goes.\n\n\n*For Auto Start, go to Preferences >> \"General Options\" tab >> Enable \"Autostart\".\n\n\n*Linux on my laptop is: Ubuntu 20.04\n", "Q: How can I find installed web applications? I've installed LAMP Server using tasksel. I've installed phpMyAdmin, which I know from experience gets in /phpmyadmin. That works. Then I installed drupal6. I assumed that it would get in /drupal, but that's not the case. \nHow can I find that kind of information? Of course, in this case, I'm looking for my Drupal install, but I would like to avoid having to spend so much time every time I install a web application, so I'm looking for a generic way. \n\nA: I don't think there is a common way for all web applications. It depends on how they were packaged. I agree this is not ideal.\nIn the case of drupal6 though, the example apache2 configuration file is created as /etc/drupal/6/apache.conf.\nTo get drupal6 working as expected in your question, you need to \n\n\n*\n\n*copy /etc/drupal/6/apache.conf to /etc/apache2/sites-available/drupal6\nsudo cp /etc/drupal/6/apache.conf to /etc/apache2/sites-available/drupal6\n\n*link /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/drupal6 to /etc/apache2/sites-available/drupal6\ncd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled\nsudo ln -sf /etc/apache2/sites-available/drupal6 .\n\n*Restart apache2 for the changes to take effect.\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\n*You can then install drupal6 by visiting http://localhost/drupal6/install.php in a web browser.\n\nA: in the gnome 3 environment you can drag the icon to the sidebar in the menu, or if you are using unity you can right click on the icon once opened in the sidebar and check pin to sidebar. but my only advice if you cant find it go to the source where you got drupal and see if it can be run from a terminal i forgot also you can possibly use the sort option which is available in both unity and gnome 3\n", "Q: changed /etc permission in oneiric (ubuntu11.10) by using \"sudo chmod 665 /etc\" cant use sudo now I screwed up big time.

An Ubuntu system with a GUI (as opposed to an Ubuntu Server system with no GUI installed) has two mechanisms for running commands as root. One is sudo. The other is PolicyKit. You can use pkexec, the command-line frontend to PolicyKit, to fix the permissions:\npkexec chmod 755 /etc\n\nIf all you did to create the problem was to run sudo chmod 665 /etc, then that completely fixes the problem and you don't need to try to repair any permissions inside /etc. (Nothing inside /etc is changed with a chmod command on /etc that doesn't use the -R flag.)\n\nA: Try inserting the the ubuntu live cd, open up the terminal and enter\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo su - \n\n*mount /dev/sda5 (or whichever is the root partition of your Ubuntu installation) /mnt\n\n*chroot /mnt\n\n*chmod 755 /etc\n\n*exit\nThis should make things as they were.\n\nA: You need to chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.

I have installed Ubuntu 11.10 server.. so command line only.\nI need to be able to play audio (.mp3 & .wav) files via the command line!\nI've installed the MPD & Audacious packages... and copied some files to a location specified in the .conf file.\nBut what do I do to acutally play the .mp3 files??\nAlso, how can I confirm the AUDIO is working correctly?\n\nA: You can test the sound quite simply: speaker-test -c6 (where -c6 indicates I want to test 6 channels for a 5.1 setup)\nBut for playing music, mpd is just a server.\nIt needs a frontend to tell it to do things. Check out mpc for a fairly basic command line player. There are of course many, many clients (including graphical ones you can connect over the network) so you can play around with those.\n\nA: For wav you can use aplay.  For mp3 you can use mpg123.\n\nA: If you already have ffmpeg installed (you should have ffmpeg installed default with ubuntu), try:\nffplay example.mp3\n\n\nA: ffplay has -loglevel quiet, so no need to redirect output to the platform-specific /dev/null.

I have a brand new SSD and I'd like to install 12.04 onto it with nilfs as the filesystem for the root partition.\nI can't find any easy way of doing that. If I boot from the 12.04 LiveCD, I can install nilfs-tools (I had to download it via wget -- I couldn't seem to apt-get it) and I was able to format a partition as nilfs via mkfs.nilfs.\nHowever, when I click \"install Ubuntu\" and start the installer and tell it I want to choose the partition, it wants to reformat it and only gives me options for other filesystems (reiser, ext, etc.) but no nilfs, even though nilfs support has been installed (I was able to create a nilfs filesystem on my partition).\nAny tips or suggestions?\n\nA: As Roland Taylor pointed out, you can first install to an ext4 partition using the installer, then transfer it to a nilfs partition.\nPrepare a free partition for the system. It will be mounted as /, let's call it NILFS.\nAnd you need another partition for installing Ubuntu, it can be a usb-disk or another partition on the disk, let's call it EXT.\nYou don't need a separated /boot partition, as grub 1.99 shipped with Ubuntu 12.04 already supports boot from nilfs2 file system.\nPrepare the system\nYou do a normal Ubuntu install to EXT.\nInstall nilfs-tools, and format the free partition to nilfs2.\nBy default, Ubuntu's initramfs doesn't have the nilfs kernel module in it.\nYou need to regenerating it:\nsudo echo nilfs2 >> /etc/initramfs-tools/modules\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nTransfer the system\nBoot into Ubuntu 12.04 livecd. Install nilfs-tools. (You need to change sources in Software Center before apt-get install nilfs-tools.)\nMount EXT and NILFS, then copy your system:\nsudo cp -ax /media/EXT/* /media/NILFS/*\n\n(You can use rsync instead.)\nThen edit your /media/NILFS/etc/fstab, change the line /. (Change the uuid, ext4->nilfs2. I recommend adding noatime,async,discard mount options for SSD.)\nThen edit your grub configuration and reinstall grub. See Ubuntu Wiki for how to tweak with grub. Note that you need to change your grub config file before reinstalling. I suggest to chroot into NILFS, and just use dpkg-reconfigure to change config and reinstall at once.\nNow you can reboot into your nilfs2 based Ubuntu 12.04! :-)\n\nThough I've not tested it, but the above instructions should work. In fact, I've used the same method to transfer my Ubuntu 10.04 from ext3 to nilfs2. Since the grub of Ubuntu 10.04 doesn't support booting from nilfs2, I've used ext2 as /boot.  But recently I've downloaded Ubuntu 12.04 live cd to test if 12.04 works on my netbook. So just now I've copied /boot/ back into / partition, changed my grub config file and used 12.04's grub-install to re-install grub. And it worked! (So maybe I can turn the useless separated boot partition into a small swap partition?)\nP.S. If you don't like this method, you may try installing via debootstrap. I think it will work too.\n\nA: Essentially you cannot do this as yet because the installer does not support it.\nIt may technically be possible to transfer an installation from say, EXT4, to NILFS (installing to a partition then transferring to the NILFS partition), but you would also need a separate boot partition (and as you can see this becomes increasingly complicated).\nIn essence, the answer is \"you can't\", for now. Also, remember NILFS is rather new, so support for a move like this is unlikely.\n", "Q: How do I report a bug in Ubuntu translation?

Then map it to space:\nxmodmap -e 'keycode 108 = KP_space'\n\nReplace 108 with the keycode you found in xev.  On my keyboard, the right alt is keycode 108.  At this point when you press the right alt, it will result in a space but it is still pressing alt as well.  You need to remove the old map.  In my case, since I modified the Alt_R, when I type xmodmap I see:\nshift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)\nlock        Caps_Lock (0x42)\ncontrol     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x69)\nmod1        KP_Space (0x6c),  Meta_L (0xcd)\nmod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)\nmod3\nmod4        Super_L (0x85),  Super_R (0x86),  Super_L (0xce),  Hyper_L (0xcf)\nmod5        ISO_Level3_Shift (0x5c),  Mode_switch (0xcb)\n\nWhich shows that KP_Space results in \"mod1\", which is alt.  To remove KP_Space from mod1 (which will stop your alt button from functioning as an alt button), type\nxmodmap -e 'remove mod1 = KP_Space'\n\nYou'll have to run the xmodmap commands at login, so you should look into the ways of doing that (e.g. ~/.Xmodmap)\n", "Q: Why doesn't LibreOffice work with the HUD? So I have tried out a couple daily builds and beta 1, and love HUD. However, currently LibreOffice does not play nice with HUD and I was wondering if there was a way to make it work with HUD. Kinda like the lo-menubar that applies the menu bar to the global menu, if there was means to get LibreOffice to work with HUD. Or might this question be too soon for an answer?\n\nA: If you install lo-menubar , then the HUD  works with LibreOffice. It's the same mechanism. \nIt hasn't been used by default because it hasn't been stable enough. But whether or not it will be default by the time 12.04 is released, I don't know. \n\n\n*\n\n*Why isn't lo-menubar installed by default in LibreOffice?\n", "Q: Is it possible to open multiple instances of Software Center? I was wondering why I can't open more than one instance of Ubuntu Software Center?\nIs there any specific reason for this behaviour?\n\nA: It would be minimum useless since when you are installing software using the Ubuntu Software Center the system locks apt so that there are no 2 applications trying to alter files at the same time.\nie: You cant do sudo apt-get update (or use it for something similar) when you are installing software in the USC, the other way around is also true.\n", "Q: Loading latest firmware iwlwifi-6000 I just installed 11.10 on Dell XPS 15z.\nSomebody know why kernel does not load the latest firmware for wifi Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6230. \n$ modinfo iwlagn |grep iwlwifi-6000\n\nfirmware:       iwlwifi-6000g2b-5.ucode\nfirmware:       iwlwifi-6000g2a-5.ucode\nfirmware:       iwlwifi-6000-4.ucode\n\nIn package linux-firmware there is latest version (iwlwifi-6000g2b-6.ucode)\n$ dpkg -L linux-firmware | grep iwlwifi-6000\n\n/lib/firmware/iwlwifi-6000-4.ucode\n/lib/firmware/iwlwifi-6000g2a-5.ucode\n/lib/firmware/iwlwifi-6000g2b-5.ucode\n**/lib/firmware/iwlwifi-6000g2b-6.ucode**\n\n\nA: I did a test with this issue and found following:\n\n\n*\n\n*rename firmware usal loaded:\nmv /lib/firmware/iwlwifi-6000-4.ucode /lib/firmware/iwlwifi-6000-4.ucode_orig\nmv /lib/firmware/iwlwifi-6000g2b-6.ucode /lib/lib/firmware/iwlwifi-6000-4.ucode\n\n\n*unload/load module\nsudo modprobe -r iwlwifi\nsudo modprobe -v  iwlwifi\n\n\n*Look what firmware loaded was found:\ndmesg | grep iwl | grep firm\n\n\n[ 4171.852769] iwlwifi 0000:03:00.0: Driver unable to support your firmware API.

What is Gnome3 and Gnome2 in relation to GTK3 or GTK2? Are they related at all? Is Gnome3 another version of Unity? What is Unity? What is compiz?\nTo make this all VERY basic, the core question is:\nHow is the Ubuntu GUI built? What are the elements from the bottom-up that make up the desktop environment? \nTrying to understand this better so I know what I need/want in order to have my desktop the way I would like it. If this question is better suited for a forum of some sort, please let me know and I will understand completely. \nThanks in advance!\n\nA: The GUI on Ubuntu is made up of a large number of pieces, working together. At the base level is Gnome 3 (Not to be confused with Gnome Shell). Gnome 3 uses GTK \"widgets\" to display all the parts of applications on the screen. On top of Gnome 3, Ubuntu uses Compiz and Unity to give the shell, which consists of the launcher, the menu bar, and the other Ubuntu pieces. Unity is the actual shell, while Compiz is what's known as a compositor - it deals with all of the graphics, transparencies, and animations you see.\nSo, any Gnome 3 theme will theme your Ubuntu box. \nHope this helps!\n\nA: I'm guessing you're at the same point I was a little while ago so I think I can help you understand this all better.\nGTK is the graphical toolkit that kinda holds everything together. If you download  a GTK theme that's going to change the most stuff.  It'll change the way scroll bars, checkboxes, window backgrounds, etc.\nIcon Themes are self-explanatory, they change icons... ALL THE ICONS.\nWindow Themes or Meta-city themes change the window decorations.  The topbar of the windows, the close, minimize, maximize buttons, etc.\nCompiz is cool.  It gives you effects and added functionality but it can be dangerous to mess around with because it allows you to change settings that shouldn't be changed sometimes.\nBest thing to do.  Download Ubuntu Tweak and play with it.  Run the below command in a terminal to do so.\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\nKeep in mind though that Ubuntu Tweak is for using Unity.  If you want to use Gnome Shell there's other tweak tools built for that.  A Google search on \"Customize Unity\" or \"Customize Gnome Shell\" will tell you pretty much everything you need to know.\nHope that helped!\n\nA: Gnome 2.x utilized GTK 2.0. Gnome 3 is as obvious by the number a next generation Gnome. Gnome 3 uses GTK 3.0 but still supports applications using GTK 2.0 that have yet to be updated for GTK 3.0. If you examine the configuration files for the themes in Ubuntu 11.10 you see that contain configurations for both GTK 2.0 and 3.0.\n", "Q: Change boot entry names and grub background? How do i change the names of the boot entries and the background of the boot menu?\n\nA: Grub customizer is a untested buggy and dangerous program. It simply duplicates entries and does not seem to work. Maintainers were wise enough to keep it out of the os, so beware. Just copy image to boot/grub and update-grub.\n\nA: To put a picture to the GRUB background, \n1- Make sure you know your screen resolution.\n2- Edit your picture (GIMP is very good for this) to the same resolution as the screen.\n3- With root privilege, copy the picture to /usr/share/images/desktop-base/ which, on my system, is empty.\n4- In terminal, update grub by execution of a command \"sudo update-grub\".\nThe new background will show on next startup.\n\nA: For edit the name.... open terminal and execute this command\ngksu gedit /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nAnd edit the names there.... At my config, it starts at line 93 with:\nmenuentry 'Ubuntu, with Linux 3.0.0-16-generic' --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {\n\nExample of name change:\nmenuentry 'Ubuntu' --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {\n\nTo change grub background, I don't know how exactly, but I now that is on this file too!\n\nA: I'm new to linux but I used this site to change the background in grub. The website is really easy to understand and doesn't require you to install programs to edit grub. Its just step by step using the terminal \nhttps://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/beautifygrub\nOne thing I would say though is I struggled to get the background to change when I was saving the image as a .jpg. It was the right resolution and appeared to be in the right folder but it just didn't appear when I booted my laptop. In the end when I used the image editor I saved the file as a .pgn file and works. \nAlso the site fails to mention that you need to save your image in the Downloads folder once you rescale it. \nHope this helps.\n\nA: Install Grub Customizer.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nRun it.\nThis program allows you to edit just about every aspect of Grub.\nHave fun with it, but be careful! :)\n\nA: To change the GRUB2 background image, you should first get the splash image package:\nsudo apt-get install grub2-splashimages\n\nFor 10.04, edit the 05_debian_theme file in /etc/grub.d:\ngksu -b gedit /etc/grub.d/05_debian_theme\n\nLook for the lines that identify the WALLPAPER and COLORS:\nWALLPAPER=\"/usr/share/images/grub/Lake_mapourika_NZ.tga\"\nCOLOR_NORMAL=\"white/black\"\nCOLOR_HIGHLIGHT=\"black/cyan\"\n\nFor 10.10 and up, edit the grub file in /etc/default:\ngksu -b gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nLook for the lines that identify the GRUB_BACKGROUND:\nGRUB_BACKGROUND=/path_to_image/filename\n\nAs for modifying the menu colors on 10.10 and up; from what I can tell (GRUB2 wiki) it seems to be the same as I have listed above (/etc/grub.d/05_debian_theme).  You might have to experiment with it.  If someone knows for sure, please add a comment.\nThere are 16 colors available: Black, Blue, Brown, Cyan, Dark-Gray, Green, Light-Cyan, Light-Blue, Light-Green, Light-Gray, Light-Magenta, Light-Red, Magenta, Red, White, and Yellow.  Just be careful with the combinations, because it's really easy to make your GRUB menu difficult/impossible to read.\nOnce you're done, be sure to update grub:\nsudo update-grub\n\nAlso, I should add that I gleaned most of this information out of the GRUB2 wiki.  Check that out if you have any questions.\n\nA: Instead of me typing out the answer on how to change boot entry and background I will let Chris Hoffman from Howtogeek explain it.\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/196655/how-to-configure-the-grub2-boot-loaders-settings/\n\nA: open the terminal from the root directory using the command :\ngksu nautilus\n\nJust operate the terminal from your root directory and copy the any image in the boot/grub and update the grub using the command :\nupdate-grub\n\nnow restart the ubuntu to see the changes made.\n", "Q: What and where to search logs for discover the reason of a spontaneous logout?

You may even install and run a virtualized 64-bit guest operation system on a 32-bit host (see here for prerequisites and details).\n", "Q: lubuntu installation - I need gparted 1st I was wondering if the lubuntu live CD contains gparted too? I'd like to instal lubuntu on my friend's laptop, but I need to create partitions 1st.\nBy the way, what format should I give to the future partitions? Ext4, just like in Ubuntu?\n\nA: The installer uses ext4 by default too. The installer can also do partitioning.\n\nA: In the Lubuntu Installer, as well as all Ubuntu installers, you will find that you can easily resize your hard drive partitions. When it does this you will chose to keep windows and Lubuntu by selecting \"install them side by side\" and then easily choose how much room each operating system will have.\n", "Q: cannot change runlevel from 5 to 3 i'm trying to change from runlevel 5 to runlevel 3 by running sudo init 3 command.\nfor some reason it doesn't do anything anymore.\nthe weird thing is that if i run the command runlevel it shows me that i'm at level 3.\ntried to run init 5 and then init 3 and still nothing.  \ndoes anybody knows how to fix it?\n\nA: From the manpages:\n   Runlevels are a concept from UNIX(R)  System  V  used  by  the  init(8)\n   daemon  or other system initialisation system to define modes of system\n   operation.\n   The Upstart init(8) daemon has no  native  concepts  of  runlevel,  and\n   unlike  the  System  V  daemon,  makes  no attempt to keep track of the\n   current runlevel.\n\nUbuntu and other modern Linux distributions have replaced System V init with Upstart:\n\nUpstart is an event-based replacement for the /sbin/init daemon which handles starting of tasks and services during boot, stopping them during shutdown and supervising them while the system is running.\n\nIf you must switch to what is now closest to runlevel 3 do it by stopping your gdm or lightdm service.\n\nA: Hold shift at boot, select recovery nmode then select root, you can now switch between runlevels from there easily.\n", "Q: Installing software center in Lubuntu running via Virtual Box?

Thanks\nStill waiting for additional help to resolve this. Did what was suggested below, but then, I got stuck.\n\nA: Problem solved. Removed the driver again and did a re-install using the hardware Drivers sub-menu, chose the recommended Nvidia driver from the list, and clicked activate. That did it. Thanks for the help received.\n\nA: Have you tried to install them from here? I've had that before where the drivers in the repo don't work but those did. (Link is for 32bit just go here if that's not the case)\n\nA: There is a rather radical way I used to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Save all open files and close all programs\n\n*Press Ctrl-Alt-F2\n\n*Login as root on the console screen\n\n*type \"killall -9 kdm\" (KDE) or \"killall -9 gdm\" (Gnome)\n\n*type \"killall -9 Xorg\"\n\n*\"cd\" to the location of the nvidia driver and execute it\n\n*type \"reboot\"\n\n\n(**)\nIf everthing goes well, the driver should be installed and everything is working.\nIf not, you have to boot in recovery mode and manually replace the X config file with the backup created by the nvidia driver installer and reboot again. That is the \"tricky\" part. After reboot there may appear some questions about configuration. From my experience it's guessing ;) , because not all changes are always applied (wrong permissions?) and others seem to be ignored/not working. But maybe that's been fixed by now or I have been doing something wrong.\nAnother (more approved) way would be to boot directly to command line and excecute the driver installer. After that, goto (**)\n", "Q: How do I assign different CPU cores to different processes? I'm using Ubuntu Server Edition 11.10 and I have two extremely CPU intensive programs running on the same core. Neither of these processes were programmed for multi-core processing. Is there a way I can tell process A to run on Core 1 and process B to run on Core 2?\n\nA: The accepted answer may be good advice, but it certainly isn't an answer to your question. Your question doesn't indicate to me that you aren't qualified to hear the answer either, in fact it sounds like a good example of a situation in which you'd want to specifically indicate which processors should do what.\nGetting to the point, what you want are CPU Sets. They are supported in 11.10 of Ubuntu, since it uses a recent enough Linux Kernel. I believe Linux 2.6 is required.\nYou can read the man page for cpuset here: http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man7/cpuset.7.html\nHere is another page for general reading: http://www.bullopensource.org/cpuset/\nLinux may be \"great\" at deciding how to allocate CPU time, but it isn't perfect.\n\nA: I hope this doesn't come across as rude, but if you ask this question, you shouldn't even consider it. This is one of those things that Linux is seriously good at figuring out all by itself. If you did this, it'd likely have a very negative impact on performance. Even if the program isn't designed for make use of more processors, Linux will move them to different cores as needed. The program won't notice. \nYou might want to give them both low nice values with the nice command to give them higher priorities. \n", "Q: All kind of errors while running apt-get update, GPG, BADSIG and more Okay, I dont know what is going on and thats why I am writing here.

If yes how do I do it? mySQL is installed on server I have ssh access.\nPlease help me on this\nAK\n\nA: 2 things i can think of, 1 beeing that the port is not open for your home, another would be that the user on the server was created for your office computer (user@office)\nyou can test the first with nc -vz host port (default 3306)\nsecond would be to query the mysql.user table and se how your user is defined\nmysql> select user,host from mysql.user;\n\n", "Q: When I use a transparent theme a panel becomes visible.

I've been using the the Backup facility in the 11.10 System Settings and am hoping that the same facility in 12.04 will be compatible with the backup made with 11.10. I normally use the upgrade vs new install approach for new Ubuntu releases. Up to now I've stuck with 32 bit versions of Ubuntu but would like to benefit from the advantages that may be offered by going to 64 bit. Restoring from backup would be much more convenient than separating all my application created data from the various configuration files created by the applications which I've no doubt would work.\n\nA: You should be fine in most regards. The configuration files stored in your ~/ directory are mostly bit-width independent. They generally store settings related to programs that don't deal with that level of detail.\nIf you have compiled any programs of your own under ~/ then you'd have to recompile them for 64-bit (if you wanted to use larger bit-width, that is)\n", "Q: Encrypted Home directory not auto mounting I somehow managed to break auto-mounting for my encrypted home directory.\nEvery time I login via SSH, I see this:\nvalorin@joshua:~$ ls -la\ntotal 44\ndr-x------ 3 valorin valorin  4096 2012-03-17 17:10 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 7 root    root     4096 2012-03-17 11:45 ..\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 valorin valorin    56 2012-03-08 20:37 Access-Your-Private-Data.desktop -> /usr/share/ecryptfs-utils/ecryptfs-mount-private.desktop\n-rw------- 1 valorin valorin   917 2012-03-17 19:24 .bash_history\ndrwx------ 3 valorin valorin  4096 2012-03-16 17:58 .cache\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 valorin valorin    33 2012-03-08 20:37 .ecryptfs -> /home/.ecryptfs/valorin/.ecryptfs\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root    root    21954 2012-03-08 20:35 .face\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 valorin valorin    32 2012-03-08 20:37 .Private -> /home/.ecryptfs/valorin/.Private\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 valorin valorin    52 2012-03-08 20:37 README.txt -> /usr/share/ecryptfs-utils/ecryptfs-mount-private.txt\n-rw------- 1 root    root      703 2012-03-17 17:10 .viminfo\n\nAny ideas what I've done, and how I can fix it?\nUPDATE:\nI have set up the SSH key authentication using the method here, which in hindsight is the reason for the non-working encrypted home directory.\nSo, my new question, how do I get it to automatically prompt for the password after I have logged in with the SSH auth key?\n\nA: Try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that /etc/pam.d/common-session contains this line:\n # Encrypt home\n session    optional    pam_ecryptfs.so unwrap\n\n\n*Make sure that /etc/pam.d/common-auth contains this line:\n auth   optional    pam_ecryptfs.so unwrap\n\n\n*Make sure that /etc/pam.d/sshd contains these lines:\n # Standard Un*x authorization.\n @include common-account\n\n # Standard Un*x session setup and teardown.\n @include common-session\n\n\n*If you have changed your user's password recently, check /etc/pam.d/common-password\nIf it doesn't contain this line:\n password   optional    pam_ecryptfs.so\n\nThen you need your old password to reconfigure ecryptfs.\nMy suggestion is to change your account to your previous password using passwd and then adding the above line to /etc/pam.d/common-password and then changing the password back to the new password.\nAlternatively you can try this:\necryptfs-setup-private\nMake sure you enter the same password as your users password when prompted.\n\n*If none of the above works, try running ecryptfs-setup-private perhaps it will fix something.\n\n*If it is still not working then I am out of ideas, sorry.\n\nA: Okay, so while it's possible to use SSH Public Key authentication to log into your system without entering a password (even if your home directory is encrypted), it's not possible to automatically mount your encrypted home directory.\nTo solve this, you'll need to add a line to the end of your unmounted $HOME/.profile:\necryptfs-mount-private\n\nThis will ensure that after you've logged in using SSH Public Key authentication, you'll be prompted for your password and will mount your encrypted data.  If it's already mounted, then this command should just silently succeed.\nEnjoy!\nFull disclosure: I'm one of the authors and maintainers of eCryptfs.\n\nA: By following these instructions you mentioned in your post, you specifically made it so you could SSH into your account without your home folder being mounted. If you undo what you did there and put it back to how it was before, then when you SSH in you will be forced to enter your password if your home directory isn't decrypted already. (If your home directory is already decrypted because of another session, then your SSH key will work perfectly for a passwordless connection!)\nOtherwise, the alternative is to run ecryptfs-mount-private after you log in with your key to manually decrypt your home folder.\n", "Q: How to achieve 'Activities' in Unity? I like the concept of an activities centric desktop and I wonder if this can be achieved in Unity. For me, an activity is a couple of applications that belong to the same subject, like 'photo manipulation', 'software development', 'office work', 'social activities', 'music and video'. I would like to utilize the virtual desktops to arrange applications that belong to the same activity group.\nExample:\nDesktop 1 contains all applications that belong to 'office work'\nDesktop 2 contains all applications that I need for 'software development'\nDesktop 3 contains all applications that I usually need for 'photo works'\nTherefore I would like to give names to the virtual desktops that reflect their purpose. And I would like Unity to auto-start the required applications when I start my computer or when I switch to one of the virtual desktops.\nIs this possible with Unity (or any other desktop)?\n\nA: This is a nice idea.\nIf you are planning to have a desktop per activity I think it will be natural to also have a different launcher for each desktop and place/lock on the launcher the applications that belong to the specific activity/desktop.\nIf you like this idea then assigning a unique launcher for each desktop is discussed in this question.\n\nA: You can do this with GNOME Shell.\nThere's a extension called Auto Move Windows that allows you to assign specific desktops to any application (sadly it is not automatically, you have to set the configuration up to every app you want to apply the extension).\nIf you are using Oneiric Ocelot (11.10) you will be using GNOME 3.2, the configuration is really easy.\nFirst open the extension folder (if you install it from the link above it should be /home/user/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ and open extension.js with any text editor (e.g. gedit) and modify APPLICATIONS (line 16) and insert a list of application, workspace pairs, like this:\nconst APPLICATIONS = ['epiphany.desktop:1','evolution.desktop:1','gnome-terminal.desktop:2','empathy.desktop:3','xchat.desktop:3']\nFor more information about the configuration of the extension you can visit this link.\n", "Q: How to find location of installed library Background: I'm trying to build my program but first I need to set up libraries in NetBeans.

I currently have two 2TB HDDs connected via SATA and an older 500GB HDD connected via PATA. My plan is to wait until 12.04 is released and do a fresh install on the SSD. At that point I have a couple of questions as far as the best practices to set up my existing drives.\n1) One of the 2TB HDDs is partitioned with 40GB for / and the remainder as /home. My plan was to partition the SSD with 40GB for / and the remainder for /home. Then I would like to erase the / partition on the HDD (and probably the MBR right?) and recoup that space for storage. I would also like to erase everything except my Video and Music folders on the drive and basically use it only for media storage. Is this possible without losing the data already on the hard drive?\n2) Is it possible to have my /home/Music and /home/Videos folders mounted on the HDD rather than the SSD? I would prefer to use the SSD only for the OS and programs, not for media.\n\nA: Clean and simple. Yes, a lot of people run their /home on separate partitions and even separate HDDs. I know, I do. \nAs far as best practice. SSDs tend to 'wear out' because of read/write or better yet write/erase/write. Any way since the SSD would be used mainly as being read rather than write/erase I would think this is a good move. \nLinux OS file systems are not as intrusive as others therefore once the SSD has been written, booting from and running is mostly ALL read files. Saving your /pictures , /documents, /vids and such should be done on the HDD as it can receive a lot of read/write activity and remain operable.     \nThis is a ref for you Installing Ubuntu on a SSD\n\nA: I'd suggest that you keep /var on the HDD partition as well because /var also goes through a lot of write/read/erase which could theoretically shorten your SSD life. Everything else seems perfect.\n", "Q: Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 3000 v2.0 doesnt recognize \"Flip Key\" The Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 3000 v2.0 has a new key called a \"flip key\" where the right windows button should be (to the right of the right alt key).\nThis is a picture, the key in question is called \"Windows Flip\":\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/digital-media-keyboard-3000#details\nI am using Ubuntu 11.10 and this key is not recognized at all by the system: I have run \"sudo showkey\"\nwith no results.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, I would like to map this to be a Right-Super key as it should be.\n\nA: I have exactly the same keyboard, and i noticed that the events for these special keys are sent to /dev/usb/hiddev0.\nSo i started making a tool for reading them.

They are differently when it comes to GUI and applications. \nSwap space is the area on a hard disk which is part of the Virtual Memory of your machine, which is a combination of accessible physical memory (RAM) and the swap space. Swap space temporarily holds memory pages that are inactive. Swap space is used when your system decides that it needs physical memory for active processes and there is insufficient unused physical memory available.\nYou should use a Swap partition.\nHere is a ref for you https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq\n\nA: simply NOT true.\nEspecially Lubuntu is made for staying lean. If your machine doesn't load everything at boot time and you've got the typival 2GBs of ram, a swap is necessary like a fifth wheel on a car.\nEven Win XP Pro doesn't need a swap.\nI've got abaout 200 mb ram used on lubuntu saucy salamander and about the same for xp AFTER\nmanaging to disable all unwanted start-at-boottime-files, overdone Browser-cache, etc.\nIt also keeps SSDs Lifetime longer, as there's (almost) no unnecessesary write procedures.\nOnly thing, which makes my laptops freeze is unwanted js-code from some websites.(sometimes, when I forget to turn js off in Browser-Options). But thats got nothing to do with swap or ram.\n", "Q: ATI Catalyst doesn't retain changes after reboot when setting extended display I have Ubuntu 11.10 and I'm trying to set up extended display for my two displays.\nI have an AMD 6870.\nfglrx and fglrx-updates are installed.\nWhen I launch amdcccle trough the terminal (using sudo), I select in tab \"Multi-Display\" the option \"Multi-display Desktop with Display(s)\".\nThen it says for changes to be done I have to reboot my computer.\nBeing a good an obedient lad I do just that, but after rebooting the displays are still in the same \"clone\" option as before in the Catalyst Control Center and no changes are made.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: After using amdcccle to set the monitors as required, apply and exit, then from System -> Preferences -> Screen Resolution [or Monitors in Debian], verify it is showing the resolution you configured in amdcccle and click apply.\nThe next time you restart or login the settings will be preserved.\n", "Q: Can't connect to wireless networks Intel Wireless I'm a new Linux user and I cannot add or edit any network connections, nor is the system detecting any wireless networks.\nWhen I try to access additional hardware from system, it doesn't even open, So I'm stuck.\nlspci | grep -i wireless \n06:0a.0 Network controller:\nIntel Corporation PRO/Wireless 2200BG [Calexico2]\n Network connection (rev 05)\n\nlspci -n -s 06:0a.0\n8086:4220.\n\nI dont know if that info was relevant but any help on this would be appreciated.\n\nA: Maybe your wireless card is just disabled.

I have some related questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*In general, are the alpha or beta releases more/less stable than the daily builds?\n\n*If the answer to 1 is yes, then if I install the alpha/beta and apt-get upgrade, will I remain at the \"stability level\" of the alpha/beta, or of the daily builds?\n\n*At this point, is there any advantage to installing the alpha/beta over installing a daily image?\n\n\n(Background : I am debating whether to install 11.10 or 12.04 alpha/beta/daily on a new machine)\n\nA: If you really don't know the difference between those two, I think you really shouldn't be using Ubuntu+1 after all. (quoting aking1012)\nDaily builds are updated pretty live with changes in the main packages that are installed by default. \nAlpha / Beta are snapshots of Ubuntu+1 in development. They are generally tested for issues in ISOs (but doesn't guarantee you anything, really). So you are better of using Alpha to install if you are hoping not to run into issues when installing.\nUnless if you are really low in bandwidth and cannot afford to update after installing Alpha, you should just install Alpha. Then again, if you are low on bandwidth, updating Alpha would cost you more on bandwidth as well.\n\nJust a closing pointer: If you run into issues with alpha / beta releases (which happens quite often), we can't help you much with the issues.\n\nA: Beta releases and daily builds are all effectively just points along the road to release. I've not had a beta that I couldn't boot with nor a daily build - others have had issues with them. \nIf you install the beta and then apt-get upgrade you could be at the same point as the daily build - if nothing has changed since - you could be beyond the daily build point. It is more likely to be beyond the daily build point. \nAs it stands here with a completely updated 12.04 - everything is working - for me.\nIf you are at all worried about the stability of installing 12.04 then the answer has to be install 11.10. \n\nA: \nJust to have said it: None is stable. These are development releases that are likely to break your system. Only download them for testing or contributing.\n\nIf you want to use Alpha after reading the above, might as well save yourself the updating time/bandwidth and download the daily build instead.\n", "Q: How to backup/restore full-disk encryption?

Using your example, cat f1 f3 f2 will con*cat*enate the files together so that it will read like f1, f3, then f2.

This is a plastic sliding thing on the side of the card. Sometimes it is loose enough that pushing the card into the slot engages it. To allow writing, the tab should be pushed into the forward position, nearest the contacts.\nNow make sure you have write permissions for the device. The memory card device is /dev/mmcblk0 (other devices will be different), so try this:\n$ ls -l /dev/mmcblk0\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk 179, 0 2010-08-04 10:35 /dev/mmcblk0\n\nThis shows it's readable and writable (rw) by the root user, and the disk group.

You can set your user's group membership in Applications->settings->sytem settings->advanced->user management (KDE) or in System->Admin->Users and Groups (Gnome). Or you can do it with the command:\nsudo usermod -a -G disk $USER\n\nWhere $USER is your user name.\nNow check it worked - \"disk\" should be listed in your group membership, like this:\n$ groups\nnick adm disk dialout cdrom plugdev lpadmin admin sambashare\n\nTypically group membership won't get updated until you open a new log-in shell or start a new session. So you may need to log off and on again, or open a login shell like this:\n$ su - $USER -c bash\n\nNow, as a member of the \"disk\" group, you should have write access to the memory card.\nSource\n", "Q: DBus nested dictionary in python I have dictionary like this\n{key: {\n    key1: '',\n    key2: [{\n        key3: ''\n    }]\n}}\n\nI have tried a{sv}, but I got error:\n**to message with signature a{sv}: <type 'exceptions.TypeError'>: Expected a string or unicode object**\n\ndbus.Dictionary(self._manager.get_feeds(), signature='sv')\n.ERROR:dbus.service:Unable to append (dbus.Dictionary({u'1d63adf6-77ad-11e1-99a0-001c259909fc': {u'refresh_rate': 15, u'title': u'Omg!

During the installation process the CPU fan was switched off. Some minutes later the notebook switched itself off.\nHow could I switch the fan manually on?\nAre there other options? \n\nA: boot the installer with the switch \nacpi=off\n\nor \nnoapic\n\nYou should find that the boot cd has other options and some of these relate to power (usually accessed by Functon keys). \nDisabling acpi will remove ubuntus ability to interact with the systems power management.\nAlso check the bios. Some systems have accelerators for graphics and cpu (like cruise control or load sensing overclocking). \nMany of these were designed to work with Windows and do not conform to normal standards. Try disabling these by elimination. \n", "Q: Do all the apps that work in Gnome shell also work in Unity? Do all the apps that work in Gnome shell also work in Unity? \nOr if there is a limitation is there some way to know that without actually trying the app?\n\nA: Yeah,it will work if it is specific not specific to the de(Eg. Extensions,indicators etc) because both unity and gnome-shell using gtk3 and gnome3 (in ubuntu 11.10 and higher)\n\nA: All the apps that work in GNOME Shell work in Unity, you might even get added features like a Quicklist (right-click menu on the Launchbar). Unity is like GNOME Shell based on gnome3 technologies, so I expect no problems.\n\nA: They work mostly.  You could check the package in questions bug tracker to see if anyone has had issues yet.  If not, try it.  If it doesn't work report the bug to the package.  \nIn my opinion Ubuntu is free.  Part of what you morally pay for it is trying packages and trying to sort out bugs/report bugs.\n", "Q: Copying subdirectories with -r option not working I just want to copy the contents of a directory and the subdirectories within it over to another directory in a Bash shell. I assumed cp -r would do this.\nHowever, this isn't working:\ncp -r $BASEDIR/Upload/Temp $BASEDIR/backup\n\nThe directory Temp has a bunch of files and directories in it. But after I run this command, I only get the files in backup. No directories are copied.\nI'm also having the same problem with the -r option with a zip command. In the same Bash shell, I've got these commands:\ncd $BASEDIR/Upload/Temp\nzip -r $BASEDIR/Backup2/backup2.zip .\n\nWhen I look at the contents of backup2.zip, all it has are the files, no subdirs. (I cd into the directory because it's the only way I know to store files in a zip without getting the absolute path stored as well, which I don't need.)\nWhat am I not getting about the -r option?\n\nA: Try:\n\n\n*\n\n*cp -R maybe that will work, or \n\n*cp -rf, you can also try \n\n*cp -av origin_folder destiny_folder –\n\n*But cp -r /home/hope/files/* /home/hope/backup, should have worked.\n\n", "Q: Using usbdrive as ram in ubuntu In windows it is possible to use usb flash drive as a virtual ram. I wonder if it is possible to do so in ubuntu? If it is, how could one do it?\n[Edit]: I mean  Ready boost equivallent for ubuntu. I know that it is not a perfect replacement for ram and it is not advisable for longterm use. \nIs creating swap file in a usb flash drive similar to it? Will it demonstrate performance gains over a swap file in a Hard Disk Drive?\n\nA: I found out about this when I did it from http://www.tuxgarage.com/2011/07/add-virtual-ram-to-ubuntu-using-spare.html\nPlug-in your USB drive and make sure there are no important files on the drive. Delete all the files on the drive or re-format it and go to a Terminal.\nFirst, we need to unmount the drive if Ubuntu auto-mounted it when you plugged it in:\nsudo umount /media/drive-label\n\nWhere 'drive-label' is the name you see for the USB drive when it is mounted.\nOr you can also do it this way:\nsudo umount /dev/sdx1\n\nWhere 'sdx1' is your drive/partition letter. You can find it by running this command:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nNow, we'll create the Swap file on your USB drive:\nsudo mkswap /dev/sdx1\n\nWhere 'sdx1' is your drive letter we figured out from the output of 'fdisk -l' command above.\nNow, turn on your new Swap:\nsudo swapon -p 32767 /dev/sdx1\n\nDone!\nIn order to make sure your new Swap is working, you can take a look at the output of this command:\ncat /proc/swaps\n\nMy output is:\n/dev/sda2 partition 2047992 60692 -1\n/dev/sdb1 partition 7912708 17764 32767\n\nTo take the stick out first turn off the Swap:\nsudo swapoff /dev/sdx1\n\n\nA: If you truly need to add RAM to your system, there is nothing short of installing more memory sticks or increasing the physical memory of the machine. \nUsing a USB cannot increase the RAM in such a manner as to ONLY increase the swap file, plus the read/write times are decreased by the USB 480mb transfer limitations.\nIf you want to experience an increase in performance use \"zRam\". This adds a special file to your existing system and increases the system's virtual memory. It decreases the I/O write times as it uses a compressed block technology stored on the current RAM  \nMore information here\n\nA: I already tried this ago. But usb stick so slow when writing something.\nI experienced very short hang continuously when system using usb swap. It was may my stick was so cheaper one.\n\nA: The answer Sean suggests is one way of accomplishing this, another would be to just create a swapfile on the stick, that way you can also use your stick for other files. Like so:\n\n\n*\n\n*find out where the stick is mounted. Look in nautilus or issue mount in the terminal\n\n*create an empty file of dd if=/dev/zero of=/media/YOURSTICK/swap bs=4096 count=131072. This creates a 512 MB file (512 * 1024^2 / 4096 = 131072)\n\n*create the swap and enable it sudo mkswap /media/YOURSTICK/swap && swapon -p 1000 /media/YOURSTICK/swap \nThe swap on your USB stick won't be faster than one residing on your HDD. Also it will kill the stick on the long term, writing does that to USB sticks.\nTo increase the usable amount of ram check out zram.\n", "Q: Xubuntu 11.10 x 64 Sandy bridge (i5 2500k) graphics glitches I have Xubuntu 11.10 x 64 and i5 2500k CPU (sandy bridge).

Please Advise.\nAlso some games like tuxkart (Designed for Linux) is hanging after a while.\n\nA: I can vouch for both, Minecraft and the Intel video from the CPU.

In my case I am the Graphics 2000, in your case you are the Graphics 3000 but if I am sure, the many updates received in the 12.04 for Sandy Bridge technology will help us with this problems.\nI need to add that I have not yet tried the PPAs mentioned by Glauber Cardoso.\n\nA: You can use the xorg-edgers repository of experimental drivers to update the drivers for your video card. Because the drivers are not guaranteed the experimental operation, can solve problems but also create new problems, but you sure are using the latest release of the same.\nI own a laptop with this graphics card and recently updated the drivers for this repository, where there was no problem. If you want to perform the update run the command sudo apt-add-repository ppa: xorg-edgers/ppa && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade-y and restart your computer (sudo shutdown -r now). After the restart the driver will be updated.\nYour video card also has the technology SNA - Sandy Bridge New Acceleration Architecture that improves some acceleration features.

Later on, when I use my browser(Chrome), I'm asked for a password to unlock the keychain so that the browser can access my saved credentials for various websites (it's the same password).  Also, whenever I use SSH to connect to other computers using my private key, I am prompted for the same password to unlock my private key.\nHow can I make it so that I am asked for my password exactly once per login (given that my login password is the same as the one I use for all my private keys)?  One important requirement: all of my private keys should have a password. This means that I will have to type in one password on login, which will unlock some key which in turn decrypts the passwords for all other keys (which are also unlocked).  It also means that if someone else gets access to my private keys, they will not be able to use them without at least one password.\nProbably someone will try to label this question as a duplicate of this question, this question, or this question. While these questions are similar, none of them explicitly say that there still needs to be a password entered on login, as I am demanding here.  As a result, the accepted solutions just say \"set your passwords to blank\"--I don't want that, it's dangerous!  So I am aware of the similar questions, but none of them has received the correct answer yet, because they are slightly different.\n\nA: \n1) After Creating the Public Key By Following,\n\nThe first step involves creating a set of RSA keys for use in authentication.\nThis should be done on the client.\nTo create your public and private SSH keys on the command-line:\nmkdir ~/.ssh\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh\nssh-keygen -t rsa\n\nYou will be prompted for a location to save the keys, and a passphrase for the keys. This passphrase will protect your private key while it's stored on the hard drive and be required to use the keys every time you need to login to a key-based system:\nGenerating public/private rsa key pair.\nEnter file in which to save the key (/home/b/.ssh/id_rsa):\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):\nEnter same passphrase again:\nYour identification has been saved in /home/b/.ssh/id_rsa.\nYour public key has been saved in /home/b/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.\n\n\n2) You must add your private key (might be not secure) but still you\n  can do this,\n\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\nSource From Ubuntu Wiki.\n\nA: Go to System / Preferences / Passwords and Encryption Keys to see your keyrings. \nAll the keys / passwords you want to unlock when you login must be in the login keyring. \nIf they are in other keyrings, delete them, and next time you are asked for the password there should be an option in the pop-up window to store it in the login keyring. (I think you cannot just copy from one to another, you need to delete.)\nDepending on your case things may be slightly more different. If the above doesn't work then please attach a screenshot of the pop-up window you get with all advanced options expanded.\n\nA: Set your keyring password to be the same as your log-in password, not blank. This will achieve your goal of unlocking the keyring on log-in, and will keep the keyring itself protected with a password as well. This is in fact, the default behavior for a new setup, so likely you changed your password at some point, or specifically set a different password on your keyring. Change one or the other so they both match, and everything will unlock when you log in.\n\nA: even if you have the keyring password and your login password the same i have the same issue on ubuntu 12.04\non initial login it prompts me for the keyring pwd which i enter and all is good\nhowever when i close chrome and re-open i get sync issues all over again\nthis is a known bug in windows/mac and linux:\nhttp://groups.google.com/a/googleproductforums.com/forum/#!category-topic/chrome/report-a-problem-and-get-troubleshooting-help/SFTQBjxJX-4\nwhen i look at my local state in /home/.config/google-chrome it says i dont exit cleanly:\n\"exited_cleanly\": false,\n\nA: Set a blank keyring password and you won't be bothered again.\n", "Q: \"unable to find a medium containing a live filesystem\" while trying to install Yes, I have read questions and answers with similar titles for this issue, which prevented me from installing Ubuntu for several MONTHS now, trying to figure it out.\nI have a MacBookPro with triple partition (one for Mac Snow Leopard, one for Windows 7, one for Linux) created with reFIT firmware (not BootCamp).\nI set up the system according to these instructions for reFIT:\nhttp://lifehacker.com/5531037/how-to-triple+boot-your-mac-with-windows-and-linux-no-boot-camp-required\nNow. There is a free partition ready to accept Linux into its arms, but Linux does not want to participate.\nMost answers to the issue \"unable to find a medium containing a live filesystem\" point to changing the BIOS booting system (which I don't know how to do, especially using this reFIT booting system), and to changing the socket of the USB (which does not concern me, since I am using a CD, actually I tried with a CD, then with a DVD, since a blank CD is only 700MB while the iso image file of Ubuntu is about 731MB).\nAnyway. This is what happens:\n\n*\n\n*I am in the Mac system (using the Mac partition)\n\n*I insert the DVD with the burned image of Ubuntu (yes I have tried burning it again and agin on both CD and DVD blank discs).\n\n*I restart the computer.\n\n*When reFIT loads, I hold down the ALT key until the CD image appears. \n\n*I select it, and hit Enter.\n\n*A small Ubuntu icon appears at the bottom of the screen.\n\n*Then a Ubuntu sign appears in the middle of the screen with small dots underneath, lighting up progressively over and over to indicate it's loading.\nThen everything turns black and the following message appears, at the end of a few lines of text:\n\n\"unable to find medium with live file system\".\n  \n  Please start by saying how do I access the BIOS setup from reFIT bootup, and exactly what and why I need to try and change. (Will this mess up my reFIT bootup?)\n\nAnd anything else I need to do to finally be able to install Ubuntu.\n\nA: I understand what you're saying because I've recently been working with a Dell that had the same issue (which is what led me to this post in the first place.) The only things I would recommend are:\n\n\n*\n\n*try to reburn (which you mentioned you did),\n\n*check the MD5 sums, or\n\n*rebuild the filesystem image.\n\n\nI did finally get a 64-bit DVD working right this way, so with a bit of luck I'd imagine this would help you. \n", "Q: Setting to protect gnome-terminal from key logging Looks like it is easy to log keystrokes of all processes of the same user. A basic keylogger is 'xinput'.\nxinput test-xi2\n\nThe command generates log of all key-presses. Unfortunately, this includes passwords in gnome-terminal. Googling suggested that grabbing keyboard may prevent other windows from capturing key strokes.\nIs there a way to prevent XI2 logging in gnome-terminal? Or is there an X terminal that has this feature?\n\nA: It's not possible as any keystrokes passed on to the X server, will be available for xinput/any arbitrary program. (In fact, it's part of the design). New display servers like Wayland and Mir are fixing such security problems in X. The only real solution would be to use Wayland or Mir instead of X. This blog post details this issue.\n\nA: As others said here, it's not possible to protect only a program like gnome-terminal or other terminal from key logging, only if you restrict standard users to execute any key logger or if you stop/pause any key logger process.\nNext I will show you how you can do these in case of xinput command, but the same methods can be used for any other key logger. If a key logger uses xinput command, it is not necessary to apply the method upon it as long as you apply it upon xinput.\n1. Restrict standard users to use xinput command\nYou can restrict standard users to use xinput command using the following command:\nsudo chmod go-x /usr/bin/xinput\n\n2. Restrict standard users to use xinput command with test-xi2 argument\nYou can restrict standard users to use xinput command with test-xi2 argument by writing a wrapper for this command. To do this, go in terminal and follow the instructions below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get root privileges:\nsudo -i\n\n\n*Move xinput file in another directory which is not in any user's PATH (for example /opt):\nmv /usr/bin/xinput /new/path/to/xinput\n\n\n*Create your wrapper for xinput command in /usr/bin:\ngedit /usr/bin/xinput\n\nAdd the following script inside:\n#!/bin/bash\nif [ \"$@\" != \"${@/test-xi2/}\" -a \"$(whoami)\" != \"root\" ]; then\n    echo \"`basename $0` $@: Permission denied\"\nelse\n    /new/path/to/xinput $@\nfi\n\nSave the file and close it.\n\n*Make the new wrapper executable:\nchmod +x /usr/bin/xinput\n\nWhile first method is safety, using second method, the user may still circumvent it by calling the original xinput directly if he know its new location.\n3. Stop/pause any xinput process\nYou can stop or pause any xinput process before to enter a password or anything else that you don't want to be logged. To do this, add the following bash function at the end of your ~/.bashrc file:\nprocessof () {\n    xinput_pids=\" $(pidof $1) \"\n    if [ \"$xinput_pids\" = \"  \" ]; then\n        echo \"Nothing to stop/pause/continue. $1: no such process!\"\n        return\n    fi\n    for pid in $xinput_pids; do\n        case $2 in\n        \"stop\") \n            kill $pid\n            echo \"$1: stopped\"\n            ;;\n        \"pause\")\n            kill -stop $pid\n            echo \"$1: paused\"   \n            ;;\n        \"continue\")\n            kill -cont $pid\n            echo \"$1: continue\"\n            ;;\n        *)\n            echo \"$1 is runnig\"\n            ;;\n        esac\n    done\n}\n\nNow, after you reopen your terminal, anytime you want, using this function you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*stop/kill all xinput processes:\nprocessof xinput stop\n\n\n*pause all xinput processes:\nprocessof xinput pause\n\n\n*resume all xinput processes:\nprocessof xinput continue\n\nIn fact, with this function you can stop/pause any process do you wish before to do something (such as entering the password):\nprocessof [process_name] [stop|pause|continue]\nIf you don't know how to detect how to detect an active keylogger on your system, see:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I detect a keylogger on my system?\nThese methods maybe are not the best solutions, but I hope to give you an idea about what you can do...\n\nA: Not really. Even if you somehow manage to grab the keyboard within X (I don't know whether this is even possible, I doubt that), a keylogger utility running as root will always have access to the keyboard. \n", "Q: Why can't the Unity panel be hidden? What intrinsic purpose does the static unity panel hold for the OS?\nThere has to be a great reason for this thing to HAVE to be here.  It ONLY goes away in fullscreen apps and I can't use everything fullscreen\nWhy can the unity panel not be hidden?  \n\nA: The Unity panel cannot be hidden because the code doesn't currently allow it. Why it doesn't allow it is because nobody has added the code to allow it. Is it written in stone that it has to be that way? I don't know. I doubt it. If you can come up with good solutions to the problems that arise when the panel is hidden, I'm very confident they will be considered. But it is important to not think about these things too subjectively. We can't consider one part of the puzzle at a time. We have to consider all of it simultaneously. For instance, we don't want the desktop to feel completely different if a window is maximized or not. That would be inconsistent and confusing. \nThe top panel is used for indications, and these are important. Because unlike other operating systems and desktops, notifications doesn't stay open. So you need a way to see that something has happened if you haven't been looking at the screen. This could be done differently, but then other issues tend to pop up. \nThe panel itself doesn't actually consume much extra space. Because it also saves space that was previously used by the window menu bars. So the screen real estate is just used somewhere else. If you have more than one window open, then it will often consume much less space than was previously used. In any case, on a large screen, the panel doesn't consume much space. \nThe smaller a screen becomes, the more likely it is that you'll maximize your windows and use one at a time. In that case, the panel doesn't consume any space at all. The window decorator will be merged into it, so even if it is still visible, it doesn't consume any extra space! Neat trick, that one. \nIn multiple screen scenarios, however, the discussion about whether it should be visible on all screens is valid and interesting. I don't know if any conclusions have been drawn in that regard. It might be that it should be configurable. But that's not an easy discussion either. There are so many possibilities, but we probably wouldn't want to have all those options in code and in config GUIs. Perhaps one good option would be to use the same choice as for the launcher? But some might not like that. My guess is that this will become configurable in some way in the future, but that it won't happen in 12.04. But that's just a guess. \nI hope this at least helps explain why it isn't obvious that it should be possible to hide the panel. Or at least not obvious enough that it should take precedence over other tasks. And like everything else, you know, development resources are limited. \n\nA: 12.04 official release allows auto-hide of the unity panel.\nOpen System Settings and click on Appearance and select the Behavior tab to adjust the settings.\n\n\nA: I think they have written the code to hide it but they don't just show it to general setting because it is not the best practice for designing. It is easily to understand that.\nFor example, if you want to see wifi turn on or off, you can see at the top. Another example, applications that don't need to see the top panel such as the terminal. You can choose full-screen mode without seeing the top panel.\nIt the best concept of UX and UI. However, if you want to make the top panel hidden, you can use Gnome instead of Unity.\n", "Q: Error when trying to activate FGLRX graphic propietary control ATI/AMD I'm new to Ubuntu.

It could be that my system was not properly configured. Anyway, in my case, I added\nxhost + SI:localuser:root > /dev/null\n\nat the bottom of my ~/.bashrc file and it worked.  I don't know if this is a security risk.

Is it possible to create a FAT32 Parition in Ubuntu Persistent USB that is Windows-readable? If so how?\nI created a FAT32 partition in the past and labelled it as '/windows', though this was unable to be read by Windows 7 and only accessible through the root user on Ubuntu - I eventually was able to read it through editing fstab, but just as before, on Windows 7 it said 'The drive 'x' must be formatted before it can be used.' or something along those lines.\nI have since formatted and am now in the process of deciding partitions and sizes, but I believe I created the '/windows' partition as Primary, 2GB, and as FAT32. Should it be logical, or within the '/home' partition?\nOn a separate note, which subdirectories of '/' should I create as a separate partition, and how large - especially for '/home' - is it necessary?\n\nA: By design, Windows can only read the first partition of a flash drive.\nFor your 'windows' partition to be visible from Windows, it should thus be the first partition on your flash drive. You should format it as FAT32 for maximum compatibility with Windows and Mac machines. Primary is fine.\nThis way, Windows won't see your Linux partitions, but it'll happily read and write data on the 'windows' partition. \nAfter, you can create your Ubuntu root partition (\"/\"), your swap partition, and (if desired) your '/home' partition. These are the standard partitions for a well-behaved Linux install.*\n\n*Some would say that a separate \"/boot\", \"/var\", or \"/other\" partition is desirable. I personally never saw the advantage of this, but in the end I guess it all comes down to personal preference.\n", "Q: Display a column showing the tags set by Dolphin In Dolphin 2 you can add tags to files, but you can't add a column in the detailed view to display them.\nIs there a way to select files based on their tags ?\n\nA: I'm using Dolphin 2.1 and I can show tags in the detailed view.

My right hand is temporarily immobilized and I would like to do some minor general work on my computer. Mostly web browsing, mailing and file and directory browsing and editing. For this I currently use Firefox, Thunderbird, Nautilus and the GNOME terminal (I have already asked a specific question about Emacs).

Each account has a set of Docky Items that represents a tool set.

How can I make DBus available so Docky can fire up this way?\nNote: This same thing happens for Tomboy, it's won't run and complains of a dbus problem.\nNote:  I'm not looking for a solution that suggests I don't launch Docky as another user.  There is more than one reason that I must launch Docky as another user.  But I kept those reasons out in order to keep the question clearer.*\n\nA: DBUS is an IPC system, that means that is a way for different programs to communicate with each other.\nIn a normal Ubuntu system there is one system dbus instance, and one instance running for each logged user. The process that belong to one user that want to communicate with other processes from the same user don't need to use the system-wide one.\nSeems like Docky and Tomboy are trying to use the user dbus. So, at least, you should start a dbus daemon for that user before Docky. You can do it with:\nsu - user -c 'dbus-launch'\n\nBut it's quite likely that you will find another problem. The computer does a lot of things at log-in time, and complex programs like Docky are probably expecting that some of them are done.\nYou can check /etc/X/Xsession.d for most of the scripts that are run at log-in time. This are the X related scripts, that means that they are executed for all Desktop Enviroments. Anything fancy that Docky needs should be started here, as Docky is DE independent.\n", "Q: Can't play dvd - vob files Works fine in Windows 7 I just put in the dvd and it plays.

It is still available for Natty and you may get some results by installing the Natty Universe repository and installing it from there. I went and did that and I found that one of the dependencies depends on something from natty main as well, so you'll need to add the following four items to /etc/apt/sources.list\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty universe\ndeb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty universe\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty-updates universe\ndeb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty-updates universe\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty main restricted\ndeb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty main restricted\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty-updates main restricted\ndeb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ natty-updates main restricted\n\nThen you'll download the deb for ubuntudico2 from the link you provided and run the following:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo dpkg -i ubuntudico2.deb\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nAnd then it will install. I would recommend removing the extra natty repos after that to prevent issues with packages later on.\n\nA: It is along the same lines as your last question. Last time, you needed to enable a repository in order for apt to find the package needed. Think of a repository as a large phone book for programs (which are placed in bundles called packages). What apt is telling you is that it cannot find the package in any of the repositories it is aware of.\nThere are two ways to fix this. Either install a repository that has that package (if you are aware of one) or find the package on your own and install it. \nDoing as search at http://packages.ubuntu.com indicates that the needed package is in the universe repository for several versions of Ubuntu (here). You can either download it from there or enable the universe repository in the same way you enabled the repository from the other question. \nUsing a repository is preferred, because you get automatic updates.\n\nA: Dependency is not satisfiable see : http://forum.ubuntu-fr.org/viewtopic.php?pid=6850971#p6850971\nThanks\nSalamandre\n", "Q: why jamendo is off stores of music player banshee and rhythmbox and how can i add jamendo to the stores? jamendo is open music platform for artists and listers, i know that debian was on jamendo on the stores on rhythmbox by default, and also ubuntu use to have\nso why is not been there anymore on ubuntu ?\nis it because of ubuntu one ?\nand how can i add jamendo to the music players like rhythmbox and banshee ?\nmagnatune store is on rhytmbox plugins bu t not on banshee ?\ncan we expect jamendo to be include on next release , that i am using beta version, of ubuntu 12.04?     \n\nA: Jamendo was removed from the upstream code, for Rhythmbox. Banshee does not ship a Magnatune store, as far as I know. To get Jamendo in Banshee, it looks like you can install the banshee-extension-jamendo package. I have not tried it though.\nhttp://git.gnome.org/browse/rhythmbox/commit/?id=5db81f7c22d7d558663e2f6db3bdcb871d3d482f is the commit where Jamendo was removed from Rhythmbox. It looks like it wasn't technically feasible to keep around for now. I suspect because of the way Jamendo works as a store, it had to be implemented in a certain way, and that it isn't good from a technical/performance perspective, as it required downloading the entire catalog all the time. Its removal from Rhythmbox has nothing to do with Ubuntu One though. It was a purely upstream decision.\n", "Q: 'dd' access to a drive I've been working with making custom bootloader and kernel code (not necessarily Linux kernel). I'm putting the images on USB, and was using dd to place them on the sector they needed to be on, and I'm getting tired of burning the image to /dev/sda instead of /dev/sdb (effectively destroying my hard drive). \nSo I was wondering if I could somehow give user access to the 'dd' command, but only to the /dev/sdb drive, so that if I accidentally type /dev/sda it won't let me, because I wouldn't have run the command as sudo or root.\n\nA: you can make a dd wrapper script that uses sudo, which will only take your bootloader file. that way, you're not likely to make errors if you just keep using your script.\ni'm not sure it's worth it to do it using real permissions.\nsample script:\n#!/bin/sh\nsudo dd bs=4K count=1 if=$1 of=/dev/sdb\n\n", "Q: How do I force folder view sort order to not ignore special characters?

Thanks.\n\nA: Nautilus follows your locale's collation rules when sorting files by name.  The rules for the English locales specify that punctuation, case and accents are less important than what letters occur in the string.\nIf you want collation to be equivalent to strcmp() sort order (i.e. do a simple comparison of the code point values for the characters in the string), you can switch to the legacy C locale for collation.\nThis can be done by editing ~/.profile and adding (or modifying) a line like the following:\nexport LC_COLLATE=C\n\nWhen you next log in, the change should take effect in all programs that were using the locale collation order.\n", "Q: How to restore corrupted installation?

I'm traveling so any \"complicated\" solution might be bit hard to implement. I do have an access to the Internet.\n\nA: yes you can, i have done this and lost nothing, the ntfs drive was #0, and created ext3 (3 was the latest available) as second, swap as #3, lost nothing, the boot sector of first drive has been always empty for me ( i mean none of my documents been there) so nothing wiped \nbut really, even if there is the smallest chance of loosing data (0.0001%) do you really want to take it? if no, wait till you find another 160GB to backup, if yes, i wish you luck\n\nA: I agree with loologyyy that it is very possible to do this and do so without loosing data but it must be done carefully. The first thing you need to do is identify how much free space you actually have to work with and where it is located.\nrunning sudo fisk -l will list the partition tables of each drive on your computer (have the external plugged in and mounted when you do this. Next you need to determine the filesystem of your external drive (this is likely NTFS if windows can read it, or ext3/4 if you made it via Ubuntu).\nOpen GParted from your live USB and shrink the partition of your external HDD by selecting the external HDD from the device list in the upper right; then right click the partition in the list and click 'grow/shrink/move'. How much free space you leave is up to you.\nIf you manage to free up 4 GB (20 or so is recommended) then you can create a new partition in that space by right clicking and selecting 'new'. Make it ext3 or fat32 so it stands out from the rest of your partitions.\nRun the Ubuntu installer and when it asks where to install Ubuntu, select 'Something Else'. When the partitioner appears. Select your newly created partition and use it as '/'. You'll also want to format it.

This expanded solution works as of Ubuntu 14.04.1 with GNOME Terminal 3.6.2.\nFor all versions\n\n*\n\n*Add the following code to ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css:\n VteTerminal,\n TerminalScreen,\n vte-terminal {\n     padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;\n     -VteTerminal-inner-border: 10px 10px 10px 10px;\n }\n\nYou will need to create the file if it does not already exist.\n\n\n*Kill all instances of gnome-terminal:\nkillall gnome-terminal\n\n\n\n*Restart gnome-terminal.\nAs of Ubuntu 18.04, you need to add one more element selector for this to work.\n\nA: To move the terminal output away from the window borders create the stylesheet ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css with the following setting:\nTerminalScreen {\n -VteTerminal-inner-border: 10px 10px 10px 10px;\n}\n\nhttps://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=163964\n\nA: You can do it with some terminals, for example old xterm\nxterm -b 10 -title \"-b 10\" -e nano &\nxterm -title \"no border spec\" -e nano & \n\nIn the manual\nman xterm you find how to set fonts, foreground and background colours. Maybe a little tricky to configure, but very flexible.\n\nA: Please go through this issue - Unity Terminal 16.04\nThe Comment on the Wishlist describes is very proper solutions for Ubuntu 16.04 Terminals, where we need to change file ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css:\nVteTerminal,\nTerminalScreen {\n    padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;\n    -VteTerminal-inner-border: 10px 10px 10px 10px;\n}\n\nTO\nVteTerminal {\n    padding: 10px;\n}\n\npadding works the same as normal CSS padding.\n\nA: Back in the old days there used to be X Resources. Creating a .Xdefaults or .Xresources file in your home directory you could change all sorts of settings for graphical applications. \nSystem wide defaults on my box are found in /etc/X11/Xresources and /etc/X11/app-defaults but i don't know if gnome-terminal cares for any of those.\nEdit: also, this seems \"theme department\", so editing theme files or starting gnome-terminal with a custom .gtkrc file could do the trick, something like \n$ GTK2_RC_FILES=~/custom-gtkrc gnome-terminal\n\nin the terminal, or editing the gnome-terminal.destktop above to look like \nExec=env GTK2_RC_FILES=/home/you/custom-gtkrc gnome-terminal\n\ncould work. \n\nA: I tried all answers here on Ubuntu 16.10 with gnome-terminal 3.20.2 and they didn't work. I found the up-to-date solution in this launchpad thread. In the file ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css (which you may need to create), add this:\nvte-terminal {\n    padding: 10px;\n}\n\n\nA: I couldn't find a padding parameter in the gconf or dconf editor. I did a search on \"terminal\" with the Software Center and found a number of terminal applications. Gnome used to make it easy to specify different terminal applications but things have changed a bit. /usr/share/applications/gnome-terminal.desktop is where the terminal application to execute is specified. Open that file and you'll find:\n[New Shortcut Group]\nName=New Terminal\nExec=gnome-terminal\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\nThe Exec=gnome-terminal can be changed to select a different terminal application. Editing this file is a little involved because their mime type isn't recognized by naultilus as editable. You'll need to initiate the edit from the command line as follows:\nsudo gedit /usr/share/applications/gnome-terminal.desktop\n\nHaving made that change the terminal application can be initiated the same as before but your alternative terminal application will be run.\n\nA: Alternatively, I've used the workaround where you change the theme's (metacity 2) left_width parameter to 15 or 20 pixels.  \nThis makes the window border thick on the left side and moves the effective left margin inside the window.  This works okay for me as the window border color and background color for the terminal are close.  \nI researched this thoroughly and the only other way to do it is to switch to the xterm terminal as mentioned above. However, configuring xterm is a pain and has to be done through the .Xresources config file, there is no menu with xterm.\n\nA: Updated for Ubuntu 22.10 - missing gtk.css file\nWhen I went to ~/.config/gtk-3.0, I couldn't find a gtk.css file. If this is what you're struggling with, here's what you should do:\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal window. On Ubuntu, you can use the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+T.\n\n*Type cd ~/.config/gtk-3.0. This will bring you to the folder where we'll make gtk.css. The ~ tilde represents the root directory, or /home in Ubuntu.\n\n*Type > gtk.css into the terminal. This will create a file called gtk.css, where you'll be able to make changes.\n\n*Open the gtk.css file in your preferred text editor.\n\n*Make whatever changes you want to the css. To increase the padding, add this:\n\n VteTerminal,\n TerminalScreen,\n vte-terminal {\n     padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;\n     -VteTerminal-inner-border: 10px 10px 10px 10px;\n }\n\n\n\n*Save, exit, and reload the terminal.\n\nThe changes should now appear when you open a new terminal window.\n", "Q: How to have a program open with Compiz \"put right\"? When I open my text editor, I always use a keyboard shortcut to \"put right\" through the compiz window-snapping feature.  \nIs there a way I can make this single program always automatically open that way, and put itself there?\n\nA: Yes you can do this using \"Place Window\" plugin in ccsm. By adding your program in windows in fixed position you can control the position of your program. You need to give the x,y co-ordinate. (x,y)=(0,0) in left-upper corner of the screen.

I finally convinced my sister to drop Windows at her small business and go Ubuntu. She complained, though, that she does not want to use Libre Office and is willing to use Microsoft Office instead. I was like, ok, but then...\nThen, she asked:\n- Libre office is the default, right?\n- Right.\n- So, if someone gives me a document, by default it will open on Libre Office. Can you make it open on Microsoft Office by default instead?  \nSo, even if I get it working via Wine, can I do what she requested or is it an impossible task? \n\nA: This should be possible. In the WINE FAQ they address passing argument lists to windows programs via the command-line. Essentially you use the same command-line syntax as Windows but you prefix it with wine\n# In Windows\nC:\\>winword filename\n\n# In Ubuntu\n$ wine winword filename\n\nIn Ubuntu, there are two files that control the default programs. (source)\n\n*\n\n*~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list\n\n*/usr/share/applications/defaults.list\n\neach of those has the format mime-type=shortcut.desktop so you can just plug in the mime type of a word document and then create a launcher that opens office. The mime types of all the office documents are here\n\nA: If you install Microsoft Office in wine (and get it working), you can most definately set .doc/.docx files (Office files) in Office. When you have Office installed, you will want to right click on any .doc/.docx file, go to Properties->Open With->Show Other Applications. Select Office, click Set as Default, and you should be good to go. :)\n\nA: Yes, it is possible. What you have to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate any word file.\n\n*Right-click on the word file.\n\n*Click on properties.\n\n*Choose the Open With tab.\n\n*Locate Microsoft Word 2010 (depends on the application, if it is .pptx or .ppt open with PowerPoint, if .docx or .doc open with Word so on and so forth)\n\n*After locating, click on Set as Default.\n\n\nNow MS Word will be the Default Application instead of LibreOffice Writer.\n\nA: The wine emulator does not always work.

It involves generating a list of urls and then feeding that list to wget.\n1) As an example lets say you want to download all 63 pdf magazines of Full Circle Magazine (an Ubuntu magazine), but your download manager cannot download them all at once. So find the link of the first pdf file and quickly check that the other magazine links are in the same url format.   \n2) With the knowledge gained in part 1, we can now turn to our script to generate the urls. The script below runs an until loop, which I have modified (credit to its originator). You modify this script by placing the number of magazines in the until [ $i = 63 ] part and place the correct url after echo and make sure the \"$i\" is in the correct part of the url to be echoed so that it changes with every run of the loop. The urls are generated and then appended to a text file- this happens in a split second when the script is run and is not as complicated to set up as it sounds!\nSave the script in a text editor, make it executable and run it; modify it as described above when you want to download from a different site than my example.\n#!/bin/bash\n   i=0\n   until [ $i = 63 ] ; do\n    i=$(($i+1))\n    echo \"http://dl.fullcirclemagazine.org/issue\"$i\"_en.pdf\" >> url.txt\ndone \n\n3) Finally, assuming that url.txt is in the current working directory, run:\nwget -i url.txt  \n\nIf you want to save the downloads elsewhere add -P ~/MyDirectory after url.txt \nIt does work- if you try it, enter ctrl c to abort if you don't want to download them all!\n", "Q: Sorry, could not find a PTY I was hoping someone could help me understand what happened with my Ubuntu server.\nI had an issue with it acting odd, I won't go into detail but I restarted the server with this command:\nshutdown -r now\nWhen it came back up, I attempted to use screen and was given this error:\nNo more PTYs.\nSorry, could not find a PTY.\n[screen is terminating]\nI found this website which told me this:\nhttp://en.positon.org/post/%5BScreen%5D-No-more-PTYs-Sorry-could-not-find-a-PTY\nYou have to change /dev/ptmx file permissions:\n# ls -l /dev/ptmx \ncrw-r--r-- 1 root root 5, 2 nov 18 23:28 /dev/ptmx\n# chmod a+w /dev/ptmx\n# ls -l /dev/ptmx \ncrw-rw-rw- 1 root root 5, 2 nov 18 23:34 /dev/ptmx\n\nThis didn't resolve my issue since I was already at:\ncrw-rw-rw- 1 root root 5, 2 nov 18 23:34 /dev/ptmx\n\nSame problem.\nSo I found this post:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/302235/no-more-ptys-when-trying-to-start-screen\nSo, I did what the answer suggested, which was:\n# mount devpts /dev/pts -t devpts -o mode=620\n\nAnd it worked fine.\nAnyone know what happened, why, and what the devpts did to fix it?

Do I need this, when creating the partitions and setting up encryption, or is upgrading afterwards enough?\n\nA: Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric does not ship with cryptsetup 1.4, although Precise does. I don't know whether cryptsetup can be upgraded on Oneiric or not. Since Precise will be released in a month, you can also wait for that release before considering TRIM with encrypted partitions. The kernel can always be upgraded afterwards.\nFrom http://code.google.com/p/cryptsetup/wiki/Cryptsetup140:\n\nSupport --allow-discards option to allow discards/TRIM requests. \nSince kernel 3.1, dm-crypt devices optionally (not by default) support block discards (TRIM) commands. \nIf you want to enable this operation, you have to enable it manually on every activation using --allow-discards \ncryptsetup luksOpen --allow-discards /dev/sdb test_disk\n\nWARNING: There are several security consequences, please read at least\n  http://asalor.blogspot.com/2011/08/trim-dm-crypt-problems.html\n  before you enable it.\n\nAs you can see, this feature is not enabled by default because of the degraded security as mentioned in the linked blog. So, if you use cryptsetup on kernel 3.0 (the one shipped with Precise), you won't have TRIM support on your encrypted partitions. After\nupgrading to 3.1+, you still don't have unless you enable it.\nTo do so, you have to edit /etc/crypttab after installation (not sure if it's possible during installation) and add the discard option. See also crypttab(5).\n\nA: I have posted a step by step guide to enabling TRIM with LUKS encrypted partitions in Ubuntu 12.04 or any Debian with cryptsetup 1.4+ and Kernel 3.1+. (Feel free to copy it here if some askubuntu guidelines deem it necessary.)\nFind the Howto here:\nhttp://worldsmostsecret.blogspot.com/2012/04/how-to-activate-trim-on-luks-encrypted.html\n", "Q: Compiling Programs :: What to do with previous? I am trying to venture into the world of Open Source development and had a question: \nEverytime I want to compile the latest version, I usually download the tar ball and compile it. However, then I end up with 2 versions of the same software. One through sudo apt and one through compiling. How do I handle this problem?\nShould I delete the sudo apt'ed one and keep the development version or let them both stay?\nAlso, I know its a dumb question but how do I make sure that my codes are up-to-date? Do I have to download the nightly builds everyday (or checkout) and compile everyday?\n\nA: How you handle different versions is up to you. It will depend on what kind of software it is. \nYes, if you choose to compile and software yourself, you'll have to manually keep it up to date. That means downloading and applying new source. If the program is written in a compiled language, you'll need to recompile that program after making changes to its source. \nHowever, you should never have to choose between an apt-get version and a self-compiled one. You should package and install the software before you install it anyway. You'll certainly want to get and learn checkinstall. It's very easy to use. Instead of sudo make install, you'll do sudo checkinstall. It will then ask you to fill in a form about the package, then it'll install that package. \nThis can sound like it requires some effort. And it does. However, there are ways to radically improve this. \n\n\n*\n\n*Keep your own local branch of the code. \n\n*Only download changes that's occurred since your alst pull from the upstream. \n\n*Add deb packaging information to your branch if it doesn't already have it. That way, you can easily keep it up to date. \n\n*Take a break to really let it sink in just exactly what a radical step a fork is. The bigger the changes between your branch and the upstreams trunk, the more work you'll have to manually perform. \n\n*Write scripts to automate the above tasks. \n\n*Keep a PPA to make it easier for yourself and others to install and use the compiled software.\n\n\nLaunchpad can perform the above tasks for you so you get your own daily repo with minimal effort. It's called a build recipe You'll still need to branch from the upstreams trunk, merge with your own, then push your new trunk to Launchpad. This is good, because you'll want to review the upstreams code changes in any case. \nSo, this requires more learning, but once it's setup correctly, you'll save yourself of loads of work every day. It really is worth spending some time to learn properly. Even if it should take weeks to really get comfortable with it, you should. \n", "Q: Which version of ubuntu is compatible with ACER Aspire 5732Z?

If you want to upgrade from 10.10 to 12.04, then you'll need to follow the upgrade path; 10.10 > 11.04 > 11.10 > 12.04. However, with LTS versions, you can upgrade directly, so that you can upgrade from 10.04LTS to 12.04LTS directly. \nBut now, LTS versions are supported for five years while there's still a new LTS every two years. That means you can choose to skip an LTS. So the question is; will I be able to upgrade from 12.04LTS to 16.04LTS directly, or will I then have to follow the LTS upgrade path; 12.04 > 14.04 > 16.04? \n\nA: Server LTS releases have always had five year support windows, and it has not previously been supported to skip an LTS on the server.\nSimilarly, standard releases are supported for 18 months. This means that when a new version comes out, two versions back is still supported. But skipping a release is not supported.\nTherefore it seems very unlikely that it will be possible to skip an LTS upgrade. However, Canonical have surprised us before (e.g. extending Desktop LTS support to five years), so they might again!\n\nA: I decided to drop Mark Shuttleworth a comment on his blog.\nMy Question:\n\nMark – its not clear what the LTS upgrade strategy is beyond 12.04.\ni.e. – could a 12.04 business jump to 16.04 directly – i.e. plan to\n  upgrade in 4 years time?\n\nand Mark's response:\n\nWe support LTS-to-LTS upgrades, so yes, you could stay on 12.04 LTS,\n  then move to 16.04 LTS (in our current testing plan we would test the\n  migration from 12.04 to 14.04 and then to 16.04, not directly).\n\nThus, any business on 12.04 LTS staying for 4 to 5 years, their upgrade plan would be first 14.04 LTS and staying with that for the 3-4 years that LTS gives, or to plan a double upgrade - 14.04 and then 16.04.\n\nA: Well, you can never skip a release that has never been possible. Because the LTS are special releases so you don't skip the releases in between since there aren't any. The normal releases (10.10, 11.04) are like test cases where they test stuff like Unity or other changes. \nto answer your question, NO you can't skip a release LTS or not.\n", "Q: \"Guided - use entire disk and set up encrypted LVM\" LUKS or plain dm-crypt? Does the alternate installer's \"Guided - use entire disk and set up encrypted LVM\" use LUKS or plain dm-crypt?\n\nA: The encryption uses LUKS with dm-crypt (not plain dm-crypt).\nQuoting http://code.google.com/p/cryptsetup/wiki/DMCrypt:\n\ncryptsetup utility support several modes. Plain mode is just equivalent of direct configuration of dmcrypt target with passphrase hashing but without on-disk metadata.\nLUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) is now the preferred way to set up disk encryption with dm-crypt using the cryptsetup utility\n\nIt's more likely that Ubuntu uses the recommended and more secure way of disk encryption. Now, to verify so, read the contents of the disk (assuming that /dev/sda2\ncontains your encrypted partition):\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda2 bs=512 count=1 | xxd\n\nYou'll see several options, such as the cipher being used and the ID of the encrypted partition.\nSide note: if you only have one partition to encrypt, I suggest you to avoid LVM at all and use LUKS only (which can be done with the manual partitioning method). This avoid the overhead of LVM which you don't need for just a single partition. On the other hand, if you have multiple partitions to encrypt (/, /home, swap), LVM on the top of LUKS is more convenient as you have to enter your passphrase only once. (physical - LUKS - LVM - /home, /, swap, etc)\n\nA: Yes, it setups dm-crypt using LUKS.\n", "Q: Attempting to install ubuntu 11.10 I installed version 9 sometime ago and since have forgotten the process for partitioning, or the layout is different.\nI have 5 partitions but only have windows xp installed on the pc in question with that being the one of those 5 partitions which is ntfs 34444 mb its - a 40gig hard-drive. \nMy first question is... is there a way to get a screen shot of the partitioner when I am running the demo session straight from disc... these 5 partitions are fragmenting the other 4ish gig needed to install.. I get an error message which says go back and make sure 1 partition has at least 2.5 gig or so. But I have no idea what I am supposed to set these remaining 4 partitions to in order to proceed.. I have read up on install guides and understand that one must be \"/\" root and another as swap... but to no avail thus far have the correct combo.\nA few screen shots will no doubt help you guys answer as I'm baffled as to what specific details to give as each one has various settings on inspection, and I don't really feel like writing it all down manually then posting specs for each one\n\nEdit: Thanks for the reply, very helpful  \nthat is the screenshot from gpart http://i1098.photobucket.com/albums/g369/Ryan_Onessence/Screenshotat2012-03-25220041.png\nand this is from the installer http://i1098.photobucket.com/albums/g369/Ryan_Onessence/Screenshotat2012-03-25220539.png\n\nA: There is a screenshot tool in the livecd. Click the button in the top left to open the dash - start typing screenshot - it should appear. If you can't find it then the PrtSc button will take a whole desktop shot.\nTo get a shot of the partitions there is no need to start the install procedure - search for gparted in dash and take a shot of that instead. \n\nA: If you have nothing on the linux partitions now then I would be inclined to start again.\nThe gparted screenshot shows some sort of error on the ntfs partition - boot windows and run the chkdsk tools on it.\nOnce you've done that reboot the livecd, run gparted again.\nDelete the linux and linux-swap partitions, shrink the ntfs one to give enough space for ubuntu.\nThen run the installer again - I believe there is a use free space option.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/GraphicalInstall\n", "Q: How can I change the folder icon in Nautilus with a command? I know how to change an icon this way. Also that doesn't work for folders inside Nautilus, but for application launchers.\n\nWhat I'm looking for is an equivalent to changing the icon for an application in the launcher, i. e. the Home folder, via\ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/nautilus-home.desktop\n\n\nThat way you can set an icon type, which is helpful when you later want to change the icon set resp. theme or when you want the best resolution for each size of the icon.\nSo, I know how I can do this for applications in the launcher - but how can I realize this for icon folders in Nautilus? (In which file these settings are stored and editable with i. e. Gedit?)\n\nFor example, I try to change the folder icon for ~/.wine/drive_c. I want to use this Faenza icon (I use Faenza-theme, the icon is called folder-wine.png):\n\nI want it to appear in best resolution: smaller as bookmark in Nautilus' sidebar, bigger as folder icon when I search Unity's dash. Using the scalable svg is not a solution, because it looks slightly different from the equivalent png.\n\nA: If you want to change the special folder icons (xdg user directories), you'll have to change them by making a custom theme. They are set to a specific name which is provided by the theme, and based on which folders are set as your Music, Documents, Videos, etc… folders.\nTo set a custom icon name to use from the theme, for the ~/.wine/drive_c folder for example, you can run the following in a terminal:\n\ngvfs-set-attribute ~/.wine/drive_c metadata::custom-icon-name folder-wine\n\nThis should make Nautilus use the folder-wine icon. However, this icon will not be used in GTK+ file selectors or other applications. To unset the custom icon name, you can run the following in a terminal:\n\ngvfs-set-attribute -t unset ~/.wine/drive_c metadata::custom-icon-name folder-wine\n\nNote, that if you've previously set a custom icon on the file, within Nautilus directly, you'll have to unset that icon. You can do this by opening the properties dialog for that file in Nautilus, clicking on the button with the icon on it, and choosing \"Revert\" in the file chooser dialog which opens up.\n", "Q: I cannot log in after theme change After changing the gtk-theme in the GNOME Tweak Tool, I was taken out of the session to the login screen and now I cannot log in.

As I have found out this is a bug in the installer of Ubuntu 10.04.\n\nTo verify, the error message you are shown will look like this upon boot without the external hard drive:\n\nThe Background\nIf I recall correctly GRUB and GRUB2 consist of two stages:\n\n\n*\n\n*The initial code of the bootloader in Master Boot Record (MBR)\n\n*The bootloader in the Volume Boot Record\n\n\nIn this case we have the first stage of GRUB in the MBR of the internal drive, but the second stage on the partition where Ubuntu is installed. If we remove the Ubuntu drive, we get the above error message.\n1. Fixing the Ubuntu bootloader\n\n\nBoot Ubuntu, open the System Monitor and look for the entry of the root directory ( / ) under File Systems, note down the Device. The device ID follows this naming scheme: \n/dev/sd[a_letter_from_a_to_z][partitionnumber]\nWe don't need the partitionnumber, so your device ID should look like this: /dev/sdb. Great, now we know on which hard drive in Linux terms Ubuntu is installed and we can install it's bootloader there. Now, open a terminal and type the following commands:\nsudo grub-install [your_device]\nsudo update-grub\n\nNeedless to say [your_device] has to be replaced with your device, in this example /dev/sdb.\n2.

Is it at least four months old? Had you updated its firmware recently?\nIFF the answers to these questions are y/y/n, you have most likely been affected by an infamous bug in the Sandforce controller's firmware, which has been known to cause exactly the issue you describe. If so, fixing it should be as simple as cutting power to the drive completely for a few minutes.

I am interestd to know the standard way for lubuntu (and not kubuntu or gnome) in detail.)\n\nThere is also an explanation of the lxdm config file here, but it does not really explain what \"lxde numlock suport\" means (how could a gui not support numlock?) and what the settings 0 and 1 mean:\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man1/lxdm.1.html\n\nIf there is no other LXDE or lubuntu standard way to do it, I am planning to use numlockx and add this line:\n/usr/bin/numlockx on\n\nat the beginning of either\n/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc\n\nor\n~/.xinitrc\n\nfollowing the instructions found here:\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-linux-turn-on-num-lock-on-gnome-startup/\n\nA: bootup numlock for Lubuntu 14.04.1 steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*dl numlockx via synaptic\n\n*then edit the file /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-greeter-wrapper.conf.\n\n\nUse e.g. this command in a terminal:\nsudo gedit /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-greeter-wrapper.conf\n\nadd this line:\ngreeter-setup-script=/usr/bin/numlockx on \n\n\n\n*\n\n*save file and reboot your system\n\n\nA: This works for me:\nsudo su -\napt-get install numlockx\necho \"/usr/bin/numlockx on\" >> /etc/xdg/lxsession/Lubuntu/autostart\n\nBest regards!\n\nA: That works for me:\nsudo apt-get install numlockx\n\nthen restart the PC.\nThat's all!\n\nA: Have you tried editing /etc/xdg/lubuntu/lxdm/lxdm.conf instead?\nUncomment # numlock=0 and make it numlock=1\nWorked for me :)\nMore Info:\nYou need to have \"admin\" permission (a.k.a. root, or sudo) to make the change, so use...\nWorks for Lubuntu 16.04: \nGo to your \"Start button\" > System Tools > LXTerminal\nIn terminal, type: sudo pcmanfm\nAfter entering your password a new folder window will open, it gives you admin/root permission. Click \"Up\" arrow twice to find /etc folder. \nThen navigate to /etc/xdg/lubuntu/lxdm/lxdm.conf\nRight-click on lxdm.conf and choose Leafpad to edit and make changes.\nTo make changes, replace # numlock=0 with numlock=1\nNow click Save, and close Leafpad. Done. \nYou no longer have admin/root permission after window is closed.\nTo \"Uncomment\" simply means removing # symbol, which will \"activate\" the command.\n\nA: Lubuntu 18.04.02\nsudo apt-get install numlockx\n\nOpen the greater file (with your favorite editor - for me vi):\nsudo vi /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/60-lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf\n\nNew line just to the end of the file:\ngreeter-setup-script=/usr/bin/numlockx on\n\nReboot (virtual) machine and at logon you should see green LED for NUM turned on now.\n", "Q: I can't hear anything in Ubuntu 11.10, except for \"Front Left\" and \"Front Right\" inside settings I'm building an HTPC.

In displays, it shows the laptop and the TV is shown as 72\" Sony.\nI've tried all the resolutions for the TV display but everything gives me what I've described above. The resolution on the laptop in Windows is 1024x768 60 htz -- this would be a great option in 11.10 but is not available.\nAny ideas on how I can change the Displays to show a 40\" Sony? Or at least create a resolution that will show each desktop, without the schism?  \n\nA: Sharing a screen with TV's on Ubuntu has always proven to be a bit problematic with me. Most LCD/LED TVs tend to have a auto-detect or auto-adapt setting built into the Menu GUI or remote, this is where I recommend you start. If you do not have any luck with this; I would suggest that you attempt to increase the resolution. For a 40\" screen television, the native resolution is certainly going to be something closer to 1920 x 1080 pixels; most HD televisions are like this. If you change your television to the primary monitor you will find you have many more resolution options in the 16:9 display ratio.\nIf you go and run the program Displays, you will see a screen very familiar to Windows; here you can enable and disable you native screen, screen sharing, desktop resolution, and set mirror displays. Good luck!\n\nA: Eventually, I found I could click and re-order the displays. so I could put the Sony on the left and laptop to the right. Then, I turned off the laptop and got a decent output to the Sony. Using wireless k/m, I achieved what I believe was a 1920 x 1280 << very awesome!!!\nThen came the flash update that screwed up my browser: after fixing that, I tried the big screen again.\nNow if I connect the VGA cable, I get no laptop display and Sony is all garbled and unviewable!\nDoes anyone know where my display preference file is located? If I could get rid of that, I think I could start from scratch and get back to what I was trying to do in the first place!\n", "Q: How do I migrate to UTC hardware clock? I have been using local time hardware clock because of sharing the machine with a Windows system. Now I don't use Windows any actively and would like to set the hardware clock to UTC. How to reconfigure this in Ubuntu?\nPS: I use XUbuntu actually, so I'd like a command-line-based desktop-agnostic solution.\n\nA: Edit the file /etc/default/rcS with your favorite text editor, ie:\nsudo nano /etc/default/rcS\n\n\nLook for the UTC=foo (yes/no) line and change it to UTC=yes.\nFrom the rcS(5) man page:\n\nUTC\n  This is used to govern how  the  hardware  real  time  clock  is interpreted when it is read (e.g., at boot time, for the purpose of setting the system clock) and when it is  written  (e.g.,  at shutdown).  If this option is set to no then the system clock is\n                assumed to be set to local time.  If the option is  set  to  yes then the system clock is assumed to be set to something approximating Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  (POSIX systems keep  a variant of UTC, without leap seconds.)\n\n", "Q: How to replace GRUB with Windows NT Bootloader? I'm not really a big fan of GRUB (I had a bad experience), nor very knowledgeable about Linux, so how do I remove GRUB, and replace it with Windows NT Bootloader, yet keep the same list/number/entries of OS, but swap bootloader? I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 Alpha 2 after Windows.  \n\nA: You can use EasyBCD as shown in: Is it possible to boot Ubuntu using the Windows bootloader? But installing GRUB to a partition instead of the MBR is strongly discouraged as GRUB will tell you.\nIf you're using 2 or more hard drives and can set up the boot device order in the BIOS and/or choose the boot device at boot via F8 oer F12, I recommend installing every OS on a separate hard drive and the corresponding bootloader only to the corresponding MBR.\nAs I can imagine from your answer, it's not only GRUBs fault. Please use Linux tools like parted or GParted for partition management. Same thing applies to other tasks as well. I'm not saying it is bad software, but most Windows-centric solutions in a mixed Windows-Linux environment are not aware of other OS, which in return causes more problems. On the other side when you install via Live CD, you mostly have the tools at hand, that you need to fix the issues if something goes wrong.\nReplacing a Ubuntu GRUB installation by a Debian GRUB installation, after resizing a Windows partition with a third party tool, trying various other workarounds, fixing the MBR with the Windows Rescue tools, doing other stuff that breaks Windows and putting the blame on \"GRUB\" can just be described as FUD and is the wrong way to go.\n\nA: You probably shouldn't. At this point, I will indemnify myself by saying that you use the following information at your own risk and I have not tested it. Also, it may be out of date and not work with Grub 2.\nI imagine you could do it with a combination of http://bkpavan.wordpress.com/2008/04/02/how-to-boot-linux-using-windows-bootloader-xp/ and http://kb.acronis.com/content/1507 - but we are talking super-advanced stuff. You run the risk of making your machine unbootable or worse.\nThe real question is: What did Grub do that you didn't want it to?

Using a QWERTY keyboard with the buttons popped off and in the Dvorak order, this is annoying, because it is assumes I am using a QWERTY keyboard, and so I have to guess at where all the QWERTY keys are to spell my city's name. It seems like it would make more sense to switch the order of these two questions.\n(I'll be the first person to admit that this is a very minor problem that has probably wasted less than 2 minutes of my life in total -- but it's the principle of the thing :p)\nSo my question is: is this order there for a particular reason, and if it isn't, is it appropriate to file it as a bug, and under which package name?\n\nA: Yes, that's a reasonable bug to file.\nTo find the right place to file it, you can Google for something like site:launchpad.net ubuntu installer.  I think Ubiquity would be a reasonable place to start - people can always move it if it's not exactly right.\nIt's also worth searching the web for some keywords around the symptoms you're experiencing eg ubuntu installer keyboard layout, to see if it's already known.\nYou might read http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html\nHowever, I also use Dvorak, and I've never noticed a problem there.  Maybe I just always use the mouse or cursor keys to choose my location?  I tend to install from the Alternate disk and I know there you can choose the keymap using the cursor keys from the boot loader screen.\nThere's a bit of a chicken and egg thing here, in that the installer wants to use your location to suggest the most likely keyboard layout.  Asking you for the layout first won't help much in guessing a location.\n", "Q: How to add Ubuntu to the Windows XP boot.ini file? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs it possible to boot Ubuntu using the Windows bootloader? \n\nI have installed Ubuntu 12.04 Alpha 2 on a partition separate partition from Windows and was wanting to know how to add the OS to the boot.ini so I can boot into Ubuntu.\n\nA: Windows XP?

I dont know how to reinstall Ubuntu, set up my partitions, or save my data (pictures, videos and documents). What should I do first? My system was set up by someone I no longer speak with.\n\nA: If you are using a dual boot and wan to re-partition, you will want to back up all the files you want to save on a type of storage medium (e.g. USB or CD) After you have backed up your files, to edit your partitions, download GParted partition editor in Ubuntu software center and use it to edit your partitions. Just to be safe, make sure you have the disks for reinstalling the other OS on the computer. If you want to begin anew and make your computer entirely Ubuntu, just boot from the USB or CD with Ubuntu on it and install, this time not next to the other OS(s). Remember to back up all wanted files before taking any action.\n", "Q: Video lens missing after upgrade to 12.04 \nPossible Duplicate:\nThe video lens in unity is not showing up \n\nI did an upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04 and after this process I saw that the dash was missing my lens for movies and online TV shows. I have the latest version of Unity (5.8). Even after entering unity --reset I did not get anything.\nOne solution is to do a fresh install of 12.04, but I have many settings that will take a long time to reset.

I don't remember if there was an update, but both Python 2.7.3rc2 and Python 3.2 are failing just the same.\nI googled it and found out that this happens when people are behind a proxy, but I'm not (and nothing have changed in my network since the last time it worked).

Any help is appreciated.\nPS.: Older python versions don't work either, not in my system and not in a live session from USB, but DO work in a Ubuntu 11.10 live session.\n\nA: You can avoid modifying the httplib.py file by modifying your HTTPSConnection object:\nimport httplib, ssl, socket\n\nconn = httplib.HTTPSConnection(URL.hostname)\nsock = socket.create_connection((conn.host, conn.port), conn.timeout, conn.source_address)\nconn.sock = ssl.wrap_socket(sock, conn.key_file, conn.cert_file, ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1)\nconn.request('POST', URL.path + URL.query)\n\nThe request method creates a new socket only if connection.sock is not defined. Creating your own one adding the ssl_version parameter will make the request method use it. Then everything else works as usual.\nI was having the same issue and this works for me.\nRegards\n\nA: The problem is in ssl, it has nothing to do with HTTP, so why patching httplib if you can patch ssl. The following code should fix all SSL sockets including, but not limited to HTTPS, for Python 2.6+ (built in ssl, did not try with pyopenssl).\nimport functools\nimport ssl\n\nold_init = ssl.SSLSocket.__init__\n\n@functools.wraps(old_init)\ndef ubuntu_openssl_bug_965371(self, *args, **kwargs):\n  kwargs['ssl_version'] = ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1\n  old_init(self, *args, **kwargs)\n\nssl.SSLSocket.__init__ = ubuntu_openssl_bug_965371\n\n\nA: EDIT httplib.py (/usr/lib/pythonX.X/httplib.py on Linux)\nFIND HTTPSConnection class declaration\n  class HTTPSConnection(HTTPConnection):\n....\n\nInside class code CHANGE line\nself.sock = ssl.wrap_socket(sock, self.key_file, self.cert_file)\n\nTO\nself.sock = ssl.wrap_socket(sock, self.key_file, self.cert_file, ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1)\n\nThen httplib HTTPS request should work\nimport httplib\nfrom urlparse import urlparse\nurl = XXX\nURL = urlparse(url)\nconnection = httplib.HTTPSConnection(URL.hostname)\nconnection.request('POST', URL.path + URL.query)\nresponse = connection.getresponse()\n\n\nA: This issue is likely due to SSLv2 being disabled on the web server, but Python 2.x tries to establish a connection with PROTOCOL_SSLv23 by default.\nHere's the link to my answer for a similar issue on Stack Overflow - https://stackoverflow.com/a/24166498/41957\nUpdate: this is functionally the same as @temoto's answer above.\n\nA: This appears to be related to the addition of TLS 1.1 and 1.2 support to the version of OpenSSL found in 12.04.  The connection failure can be reproduced with the OpenSSL command line tool:\n$ openssl s_client -connect www.mediafire.com:443\nCONNECTED(00000003)\n140491065808544:error:140790E5:SSL routines:SSL23_WRITE:ssl handshake failure:s23_lib.c:177:\n---\nno peer certificate available\n---\nNo client certificate CA names sent\n---\nSSL handshake has read 0 bytes and written 320 bytes\n---\nNew, (NONE), Cipher is (NONE)\nSecure Renegotiation IS NOT supported\nCompression: NONE\nExpansion: NONE\n---\n\nThe connection succeeds if I force the connection to use TLS 1.0 with the -tls1 command line argument.\nI would suggest you file a bug report about this problem here:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+filebug\n\nA: For python novices like me, here is the way to override httplib the easiest way. At the top of your python script, include these lines:\n\nimport httplib\nfrom httplib import HTTPConnection, HTTPS_PORT\nimport ssl\n\nclass HTTPSConnection(HTTPConnection):\n    \"This class allows communication via SSL.\"\n    default_port = HTTPS_PORT\n\n    def __init__(self, host, port=None, key_file=None, cert_file=None,\n            strict=None, timeout=socket._GLOBAL_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT,\n            source_address=None):\n        HTTPConnection.__init__(self, host, port, strict, timeout,\n                source_address)\n        self.key_file = key_file\n        self.cert_file = cert_file\n\n    def connect(self):\n        \"Connect to a host on a given (SSL) port.\"\n        sock = socket.create_connection((self.host, self.port),\n                self.timeout, self.source_address)\n        if self._tunnel_host:\n            self.sock = sock\n            self._tunnel()\n        # this is the only line we modified from the httplib.py file\n        # we added the ssl_version variable\n        self.sock = ssl.wrap_socket(sock, self.key_file, self.cert_file, ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1)\n\n#now we override the one in httplib\nhttplib.HTTPSConnection = HTTPSConnection\n# ssl_version corrections are done\n\nFrom here on, you can use urllib or whatever you use just like you normally would.\nNote: This is for python 2.7. For a python 3.x solution, you need to override the HTTPSConnection class found in http.client. I leave that as an exercise for the reader. :-)\n\nA: A simple fix that worked for me was to override SSL's default protocol:\nimport ssl\nssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23 = ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1\n\n", "Q: iptables mac address filtering not work I block every port default by ufw\nand add iptables rules like this:\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 1723 -m mac --mac-source 00:11:22:33:44:55 -j ACCEPT\n\nthen I list iptables INPUT rules:\nsudo iptables -L INPUT --line-numbers\n\nChain INPUT (policy DROP)\nnum  target                    prot opt source               destination\n1    ACCEPT                    udp  --  anywhere             anywhere            udp dpt:domain\n2    ACCEPT                    tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere            tcp dpt:domain\n3    ACCEPT                    udp  --  anywhere             anywhere            udp dpt:bootps\n4    ACCEPT                    tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere            tcp dpt:bootps\n5    ufw-before-logging-input  all  --  anywhere             anywhere\n6    ufw-before-input          all  --  anywhere             anywhere\n7    ufw-after-input           all  --  anywhere             anywhere\n8    ufw-after-logging-input   all  --  anywhere             anywhere\n9    ufw-reject-input          all  --  anywhere             anywhere\n10   ufw-track-input           all  --  anywhere             anywhere\n11   ACCEPT                    tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere            tcp dpt:1723 MAC 00:11:22:33:44:55\n\nbut I can't visit my server:1723\nIs there sth wrong?\nI use Ubuntu 11.10\nEdit01:\nI add followed things:\n*filter\n:ufw-before-input - [0:0]\n:ufw-before-output - [0:0]\n:ufw-before-forward - [0:0]\n:ufw-not-local - [0:0]\n# End required lines\n\n-A ufw-before-input -p tcp --dport 1723 -m mac --mac-source 00:11:22:33:44:55 -j ACCEPT\n\nand then I list the rules\nsudo iptables -L  ufw-before-input  --line-numbers\nChain ufw-before-input (1 references)\nnum  target           prot opt source               destination\n1    ACCEPT           tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere            tcp dpt:1723 MAC 00:11:22:33:44:55\n2    ACCEPT           all  --  anywhere             anywhere\n3    ACCEPT           all  --  anywhere             anywhere            state RELATED,ESTABLISHED\n4    ufw-logging-deny all  --  anywhere             anywhere            state INVALID\n5    DROP             all  --  anywhere             anywhere            state INVALID\n6    ACCEPT           icmp --  anywhere             anywhere            icmp destination-unreachable\n7    ACCEPT           icmp --  anywhere             anywhere            icmp source-quench\n8    ACCEPT           icmp --  anywhere             anywhere            icmp time-exceeded\n9    ACCEPT           icmp --  anywhere             anywhere            icmp parameter-problem\n10   ACCEPT           icmp --  anywhere             anywhere            icmp echo-request\n11   ACCEPT           udp  --  anywhere             anywhere            udp spt:bootps dpt:bootpc\n12   ufw-not-local    all  --  anywhere             anywhere\n13   ACCEPT           udp  --  anywhere             224.0.0.251         udp dpt:mdns\n14   ACCEPT           udp  --  anywhere             239.255.255.250     udp dpt:1900\n15   ufw-user-input   all  --  anywhere             anywhere\n\nand still not work... of course, after sudo service ufw restart I still connect the server on 1723\n\nA: Rule 9 in your INPUT chain jumps to ufw-reject-input, which in turn rejects the packet.\nIf you want your additions to function with ufw, I suggest reading the documentation shown by man ufw-framework.\nYou can probably achieve what you want by creating a /etc/ufw/before.rules file with content like:\n*filter\n-A ufw-before-input -p tcp --dport 1723 -m mac --mac-source 00:11:22:33:44:55 -j ACCEPT\n\n\nA: Are both machines on the same ethernet subnet? mac addresses are only local to a subnet.

downloaded Virtual CloneDrive (google it - its freeware) When I installed Virtual CloneDrive, I associated the .iso files with it and no others. I then ran the .iso file that I originally downloaded to make my disc, directly from my Program Files folder by double-clicking. It should be mounted and launch as a virtual drive and run like the disc but without using the disc. I think the access denied error has something to do with the disc drive but I was unable to fix it.\" \nHowever, note that the disc was bad that I burned.  The procedure above will work, BUT only in Windows.  Once you reboot and Ubuntu finishes installing, you'll get green errors (similar to the beginning of the movie The Matrix.\nI had started burning the image with ImgBurn, and then stopped the burning process.  Then I used the same disc and re-burned the same image.  It said it completed successfully.  When I burned a brand new disc, and verified the disc, and used that one to install Ubuntu, it worked perfectly.\n", "Q: How do I make sound automatically mute after returning from hibernation or suspend? I want to make my speakers and headphone jack automatically mute when I return from hibernation/suspend, or maybe mute right before I hibernate/suspend. Now I could write a script to do that, but I know there are many ways I could go about doing that, however is there a right way to write this script and where would be the right place to put it compared to a basic work around that does not get the the deep system level where this script should reside.\n\nA: The directory /etc/pm/sleep.d/ contains scripts that are run when the system is suspended, hibernated, resumed (ie, comes back from suspend) or thawed (comes back from hibernation).\nSo, your script should be placed in this directory, to be called on these events. The first argument to the script (ie, in $1) will be the action that is being performed (ie, one of suspend, hibernate, resume or thaw). Your script can be run on the resume and thaw actions to mute the volumes accordingly. Take a look at some of the existing scripts there for examples. The documentation for these hook scripts is in the pm-action manpage.\nAs for the muting itself: I'd suggest using alsactl to save the 'state' of the muted configuration to a file (eg. /var/lib/alsa/asound-muted.state). When the script is run, it can invoke alsactl to restore from this saved state:\nalsactl -f /var/lib/alsa/asound-muted.state restore <card-id>\n\nAlternatively, you can use amixer to set the value of a specific volume control to zero:\namixer -c 0 sset PCM,0 0\n\n— however, the arguments to amixer will depend on your specific sound hardware configuration.\n", "Q: Can't find files from my Windows partition I recently started using Ubuntu for the first time, and I cannot find any of the existing files from my hard drive. I'm running it so I can choose from Windows and Ubuntu on startup.\nHow do I find all of my files?\n\nA: Your files can be found at the \"XX GB Filesystem\" disk on the left panel of Nautilus (the folders browser). Click it, wait for folders to appear and then look for the \"Users\" folder and, inside it, your user account's name on Windows. If you were on XP, look for \"Documents and Settings\" instead.\n\nA: I think first of all you should checkout which partition was having that data, for that you will have to mount that partition.Tell me if That partition exist or not where you are keeping files?\n", "Q: Cannot type '^' (caret) in native KDE apps I cannot type the caret character '^' in native KDE apps, such as plasmoids, editors (Kate, KWrite), etc.\nIt worked in previous (older) versions of KDE (3.5, I think). I believe it may be related to the fact that I'm using a keyboard with a german layout, however, it would seem farfetched - I can type the caret character just fine in non-KDE apps (such as chrome, firefox, etc).\nI tried switching keyboard layouts, but no cigar. What's going on? What do I have to change to get the caret character back?\n\nA: Same happened for me, only way to get it back was to switch to a keyboard layout without deadkeys.\n", "Q: Can't get my graphics driver (GMA 3150) to work I've been searching like crazy trying to find a fix for this, it's the only thing that's not completely working on my setup. I see posts where people say it should be working but it just isn't.  I have a Gateway LT2802u netbook and I installed 11.10 on this 2 days ago. Everything works except for accelerated graphics. At first I couldn't watch a simple flash video at all, but somehow I got it to work. Now the last problem I have is I can't watch HD videos, my screen resolution won't go higher than 1024x600, and my under my graphics driver it says \"Unknown\".\nAfter doing as much research as possible, I've come to the conclusion that it's the GMA 3150 graphics driver. There is a bunch of talk on it all over the interwebs but nothing lately. I've tried the fixes that some people have used but most when I try to get the package it's no longer there or available if that makes sense. I'm loving everything Ubuntu has to offer but it'll really bite if I can't use it any more because of this problem. Does anybody have any ideas? You'd really be helping a lot.\n\nA: It seems you GMA 3150 is working correctly.\nPlaying HD content ( even 720p ) is usually not possible with such hardware as the video decoding cannot be handled by the GMA 3150 hardware on any OS including windows .\nJust confirm that you can view 480p youtube video in HTML5 mode http://www.youtube.com/html5\n\nA: Your GMA 3150 can handle HD videos up to 720p. But not through flash. Adobe flash is using CPU to accelerate video playing - and forcing GPU encoding doesn't work for me with this GPU. But if you download the reguested video first and then play it in Gnome Mplayer (With enabled gpu acceleration) it will work without problems. Or try Minitube.\n\nA: install intel graphic drive:\nOpen terminal and type\nsudo service lightdm stop\nsudo apt-get install mesa-utils\nsudo service lightdm start\n\nGo to setting --> display and uncheck mirror and click detect display\n\n\n*\n\n*select laptop and turn off \n\n*select your monitor and change screen resolution you want\n\n*click apply and keep this configuration, then you are done.  \n\n", "Q: How to right-align widgets in panel in Kubuntu 11.10? First, please take a look at this screenshot:\n\nThe problem is...\n\n\n*\n\n*It all happened before I realized what I did. So, I don't know how I messed it up. :(\n\n*Do you see the panel at the bottom? The 'Time', 'System Tray', and 'Show the Desktop' widgets which are supposed to be aligned right in the panel, are aligned left. Selecting \"Panel Tool Box > More Settings >  Panel Alignment > Right\" changes nothing.\n\n*Also, the application switcher in the panel (that allows me to switch between various open apps in a workspace - - like in Windows) is missing.\n\n\nThere should probably be a way to reset it all. I would like to know that, and... I would also like to know how I can manually rearrange things back to default, so that I know how it actually works.\n\nA: KDE Plasma desktop\nThe KDE panel and the widgets are plasmoids or plasma widgets. More of the KDE plasma: http://userbase.kde.org/Plasma .\nHow to manage the KDE plasma panel: http://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Panels .\nProbably\nProbably you have removed the \"Task Manager\". More : http://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Tasks\n\nYou could add it back (KDE userbase): \n\nTo place a widget in the panel first open the Panel Toolbox and from\n  there open the Widget Explorer (click Add Widgets), locate the widget\n  you wish to add and drag it to the desired position in the Panel.\n\nYou could move plasmoids: Open the Panel Toolbox and move mouse cursor over the widget. The cursor should change to the \"compas rose\". Move the widget to the right place.\nSame from the KDE userbase:\n\nThe panel can then be configured by clicking on the toolbox located on\n  the right for horizontal or bottom for vertical panel. At that point,\n  the panel will be in configuration mode. Panel configuration may also\n  be accessed via the context (right click) menu in the panel.\nWidgets in the panel can be sorted by dragging them when in\n  configuration mode.\n\nNew default panel (KDE userbase): \n\nTo add a new panel either click on the desktop toolbox button and\n  select Add Panel or open the context (right click) menu on the desktop\n  and select Add Panel from the menu. \nIf more than one kind of Panel is installed, you will be able to\n  select between them to choose what sort of Panel you would prefer. By\n  default, two Panel types are available: Default Panel, which creates a\n  Panel containing all of the default widgets (launcher, pager, tasks,\n  system tray, clock, etc.), and Blank Panel, which adds an empty Panel\n  without any pre-configured widgets in it.\n\n\n", "Q: Help with installing Gnome Shell Google Calendar Extension I am having trouble running the script to install the gnome-shell-google-calendar extension into Gnome Shell.

I was stupid, I kept ignoring the warnings that my harddrive space was running low and left a download running in the background. When I logged out, I wasn't taken back to the login screen (LightDM), and when I rebooted I didn't get the login screen either. Instead I got a terminal-like screen that listed drivers/daemons being loaded, but didn't have a prompt. I could still access the terminal with Ctrl-Alt-F1 (and F2 etc).\nAfter barking up many wrong trees I solved it by deleting a file or two. My question is, why did this happen?\n\nA: If the root partition has filled (or the partition that holds /var to be more precise), there will not be any space to write to /var/log/auth.log, which usually prevents login attempts from anyone besides the superuser.\nThe same goes for /home. There are files in your home directory that have to be updated and if there is no space left on the device will prevent you from logging in. \n\nA: Either /tmp filled up so it couldn't create .X11-unix or /home filled up so it couldn't create .Xauthority. Either way, graphical login would be nonfunctional.\nModern Ubuntu defaults to a RAM-backed /tmp; however I recall in 2012 this was not the case.\n", "Q: disabling access to weaker WiFi signals I installed a WiFi repeater.

You can search for simple search strings (e.g. man -K \"example text\"), or use the --regex option to use regular expressions in your search.\nIt will give you the first matching manual page; press q to close it and you will be presented with the option of reading the next match (Enter), skipping the next match (Ctrl-D), or quitting altogether (Ctrl-C).\n", "Q: Can find any /.ecryptfs dir to retrieve my encrypted home dir I've read some questions similar, but not the exactly the same problem...\nI've moved my home directory to a separated partitión (Ubuntu 11.10) following this tutorial.\nAfter confirming all my files and folders, I've installed Fedora 16, but forgot that one of those directories was encrypted by ecryptfs.\nSo I was surprised when all I found in my home folder was a file, Readme.txt, advising me that my folder was unmounted for security reasons and suggesting that I type on the command line ecryptfs-mount-Private (which didn't work), or click on labeled icon \"access your private data\" (which didn't work either).\nAfter three days reading all I could find on the internet, I followed Dustin Kirkland's tutorial, but it couldn't find any .ecryptfs.\nI'm sure that the data is somewere (the size of the moved dir is identical to the original one).  Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot.\n\nA: For me all the above didn't work because my situation was slightly different.

When I changed the name of the disk from \"Ubuntu Home\" into \"home\" it finally worked!\nApparently the script ecryptfs-recover-private does not just look for the ./Private dir, but first for the /home/ dir. I hope this information helps some other people out! Now I just have to figure out how to hook up my encrypted disk again to a fresh new installation...

I hope you can improve ecryptfs-recover-private even further. :)\n\nA: thank you so much for asking this question here!  (Previously, it was a private email thread between Roberto and I).\nYou said you've tried following my tutorial describing how to recover your encrypted home directory.  If you're sure you have all of your data under /home, I'm quite confident that it will work properly for you.\nPlease ensure that:\n\n\n*\n\n*You boot from an Ubuntu 11.10 Desktop Live CD.  I know you're running Fedora, and it should very well be possible to recover using Fedora's eCryptfs utilities, but I've never done it before.\n\n*You mount your existing hard drive.  The Ubuntu Desktop Live CD should detect and mount your drives/partitions.\n\n*Find your /home partition.  Browse that directory structure.  Make absolutely sure that you have all of these directories:\n\n*\n\n*/home/.ecryptfs/$USER/.ecryptfs\n\n*/home/.ecryptfs/$USER/.Private\n\n*/home/$USER/.ecryptfs/\n\n*/home/$USER/.Private/\n\n\n*Once you've found all of these, just run ecryptfs-recover-private as described in that post.  It will create a read-only mount of your cleartext data, which I strongly recommend backing up somewhere, and then restoring it (in cleartext) in your new Fedora installation.\n\n\nIf this doesn't work for you, then you're missing one of the fundamental pieces mentioned above.

But when I check my apache server running as a root user or not by executing following php-script: \n< ?php echo `whoami`;  ?>\n\nIt gives me output: nobody. So any suggestions to execute/login as a root user in apache?? \n\nA: What you are asking is very dangerous because any new vulnerabilities found in Apache can be exploited as root.  One of the first things web masters do when securing their web server is to not run the server application as root.  That said, I offer the following alternative that should meet the need as you have stated it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a shell script that does what you want.  This is not a PHP script as PHP is run within the web server, you need a script that is run by Ubuntu.  Here is a sample:\n#!/bin/sh\n# script that runs as root\nwhoami\n\nI called this file /localstore/root.sh and you should place it somewhere that makes sense on your systems (e. g. /home/www_data/bin).\n\n*In a terminal window, execute the command sudo vi /etc/sudoers and insert the following line at the end of the file (important to be at end so the other commands do not override):\nALL ALL=NOPASSWD: /localstore/root.sh\n\nThat will allow anyone to run the script as root, once you test and confirm it work, I strongly recommend (again for security purposes) that you change the line to \nnobody ALL=NOPASSWD: /localstore/root.sh\n\nbut as Bodhi observed, Apache should run as www-data in which case you should change nobody to www-data.  NOTE: I have never tried sudo with nobody as the user and am not sure that will work.\n\n*In your Web server script, have the shell script run in PHP as follows:\n< ?php\nexec (\"sudo /localstore/root.sh\");\n?>\n\nYou can add parameters to the script inside the quotes.\nThat should get it so the root.sh script executes as root when invoked from your web server.  If you have other scripts, they can be a comma separated list on that same entry in the sudoers file.  Make sure the permissions on the script allow execution by the web server.\n\nA: I wonder whether the requirement is because of running in a virtual environment with the Virtual Web Server using the shared directory in which case the directory ownership will be root so that it can be accessed by both the host and guest file systems. \nThe solution may be to add the www-data group to the vboxfs group or whatever is the case in your environment. This is discussed in more detail in This Article\nIn my situation I was also confounded by the requirement to include an option in my virtual host configuration - specifically adding the \nRequire all granted\n\nwithin my directory configuration as described in this article\n", "Q: Limit Unity's Scope to Virtual Workspace?

It also doesn't remove non-current workspace from the hover list or give you a picture of the window though.

Right now i have notebook with Nvidia 8400M GS (I know, it's not good card) and it's impossible to work normally when i'll plugin external monitor (1920x1080). Windows 7 can deal with it without problems (1440x900 on notebook + 1920x1080 external). On Ubuntu i have to choose one screen and turn off the second one. Even with only one screen Ubuntu (Unity or even Gnome3) sometimes hangs for a while, I've not found solution for this yet, but nevermind, it's probably because of my card or/and nvidia's drivers. \nI'm going to buy new PC, but for now only with integrated Intel 3000HD, and my question is: Should i expect similar problems with this card? Here i've found link to Intel's webpage about drivers - \"only community develop them\", and i'm a bit concerned. I'll use then only one monitor (the bigger one), but how well does those driver work? Are there any performance tests?\n\nA: I also have an Intel HD 3000 with a Sandy Bridge motherboard (Intel DZ68DB). Not only does it run smooth in 12.04, but I can even play Wine games like L4D2 and WoW. Videos in VLC run smooth at 1080p. Best of all (Compared to the Nvidia card I also have) is that if I connect a video beam or another monitor it is detected automatically and autoconfigured on the spot. Pretty neat.\n\nA: I have an Intel 3000 HD on my nettop.  It's perfectly adequate for most tasks, even with a full HD monitor; however, I have trouble playing 1080p video without stuttering.  I think this is because I do not have VAAPI configured correctly, but it's been very difficult to set up.  This is a problem with most video cards under Linux, though, regardless of the quality of the card.\nI have tried it with multiple monitors, one out of DVI and one out of HDMI, and it works fine.\nOne caveat: I am running 10.10 on my netttop, which is a bit dated now.  I don't think the quality of the graphics driver has deteriorated since then, but the demands of compiz etc. may have increased.\n\nA: I have an Intel HD Graphics 3000 card from the Sandy Bridge series. I can play games without any problem on external monitors.\nThe quality of the driver for Ubuntu 12.04 is really awesome, but I did not test with 11.10 or below. I also tried to play 1080p videos on a Full HD TV via HDMI and it worked like a charm with VLC.\nThe only problem I found with this graphic card is that Wine doesn't seem to like it, as I can't play loads of games with Wine, but since most of the commercial games I play have a native Linux version, it doesn't bother me much ;)\n\nA: Works like a dream here on my ASUS K53E which comes with icore5 Sandy Bridge.

(your mom) My mother will be traveling for a while and I need to provide her with a secure laptop so she can work. A windows laptop is out of the question because:\n\n\n*\n\n*she'll be logging into dodgy hotel wireless networks and conference networks\n\n*price of the windows license to install on a netbook\nI've installed libreoffice, media players and skype on it. Also enabled SSH so I can intervene but I am worried that I might not be in a position to do so.\nPossible threats:\n\n\n*\n\n*web browsing\n\n*USB sticks\n\n*insecure networks prone to intrusions\n\n*malware\n\n*SSH/VNC vulnerabilites\n\n*Skype vulnerabilities\nAll the \"securing Ubuntu\" guides out there assume the user has a certain level of technical knowledge but this is not the case with moms in general. If a malware can gain even user level access it might compromise her files.\n\nA: The most important security-risk for road warriors is an unsecure network connection (public WiFi) that allows unencrypted traffic to be read by third parties or man-in-the-middle attacks on encrypted traffic.\nThe only way around this is to use a VPN. If you own a server just set up a VPN on it. PPTP or OpenVPN are easily set up and at least the former is supported out-of-the-box by pretty much everything (Linux, Mac, Win, iPhone, Android, you name it).\nFor remote support I'd recommend Teamviewer. Works from everywhere and behind every firewall.\n\nA: What about UMTS/LTE access? It would protect from sniffing and allow SSH. It's gotten really easy to configure. You would have to teach your mom how to get her IP or get a dyndns-like solution. It's a matter of pricing and coverage of course.\n\nA: The number one thing you can do to keep that computer secure is to ensure that the packages are updated regularly.  I would enable fully automatic updates (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticSecurityUpdates), as long as the potential for a burst of network use while connected to dodgy hotel WiFi isn't a severe problem.\nAfter that, I think the only big problem is VNC.  If VNC server is running constantly, it is probably the biggest potential security issue on the system (SSH is similar in scope but is considered to be more secure by default).  If you need VNC installed and need it to be running all of the time, then there's probably nothing you can do about it -- it's either running or it's not, and there's not much you can do to secure a process that has control over input/output like VNC does.  But if you don't need it to be on all the time, then just disable it.  You can start it up manually via SSH if you need to.\nAs long as your packages are up to date, I wouldn't worry about web browsing, USB sticks, malware or SSH vulnerabilities.  Linux desktops/notebooks are not a common target for them and Ubuntu is fairly well hardened by design.  Even if you don't do anything special to secure against those vulnerabilities, an Ubuntu system will be less likely to be compromised than a Windows machine running even fairly good security software.\nSkype is not necessarily secure, but it doesn't run with elevated privileges and there's not very much you can do to secure it given the state of the Skype linux version.  Just be aware that Skype for Linux is not very stable or featureful and hasn't been worked on for a long time.  That having been said, I use it for business purposes all the time and after I got used to its quirks it was adequate.\n\nA: Keep it updated (automatic).\nIf you need to use ssh (I think you need to fix things... :)) install openVPN server on your machine and client on her (and automatic/permanent connection). If your IP is dynamic, you'll need a dynamic DNS (like dnsexit.com for example). This way you'll be able to reach her machine everywhere using the tunnel (even if in a LAN in an hotel where you won't be able to use SSH another way usually because you don't control the router she is connected, only VNC or team viewer and this means VNC server always online...). Allow SSH and VNC (or similars) connection only on the openvpn subnet (and only you will be able to connect to them).\nDon't forget to configure iptables to block everything from outside including all local networks subnets (for insecure hotel LANs) except the openvpn subnet (and do not use the default one :)).\nUse VNC or any remote desktop you want over the tunnel too and you should be safe.\nUPDATE after I saw your comment about setting a VPN each time:\nYou can start the VPN at boot and let it that way. When your machine is not online or your mother not connected to internet, the connection will not succeed and retry every x minutes (you set it). When both machines are ok the connection will succeed so she will have a permanent connection without doing anything (like 2 branch offices for example). Another way could be to make a small script starting openvpn and place an icon on her desktop but she will need to be in sudoers to execute the script I believe and she will need to remember to click on the icon. For this reason I would prefer the 1st way with permanent connection. You only need to pay attention to not redirect all her traffic though the VPN in the config.\n\nA: You should run firewall (ufw) and allow only ports which are needed to be open (22 SSH).\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW\nIf you need a GUI with ufw, there is GUFW.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Gufw\nYou should also use something like sshguard to make sure that automatic bots etc. will not be able to login.\nhttp://www.sshguard.net/\nSSHGuard will ban from one failed login attempt to 5 or 15 (I don't remember which) minutes at first and it will raise exponentially after more failed login attempts.\nI have aliases to help in this case.\nalias ssh-add='\\ssh-add -D && \\ssh-add '\n\n(So ssh-agent will not contain too many keys and fail, because of it)\nalias sshguard-show-bans='sudo iptables -L sshguard --line-numbers'\n\n(To see bans which sshguard has added)\nalias sshguard-unban='sudo iptables -D sshguard '\n\n(To easily unban IP address. Usage sshguard-unban number_from_sshguard_show_bans)\nYou should also tell SSHd to not allow login with password (optional, but recommended. If you don't do this, use at least sshguard or alternative to it)\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/11.10/serverguide/C/openssh-server.html\nVNC could be tunneled with SSH.

After that you can press your desired keyboard shortcut and it will be reflected appropriately. \n\n", "Q: gbrainy trains the brain true or false i sometimes use gbrainy en was wondering does it really train the brain or not\ncause there are a lot of brain training software but after some reading. \ni found out that they don't actually\n\nmy question is does Gbrainy really train your brain or not?\n\nA: That is kind of an odd and yet interesting question to ask: \nThe commonality of human brain-structure is more or less equal in its basic setup and follows certain patterns in an infinite number of variations, for different tasks and executions (to make a long story short), therefore i would say, it depends on \"your\" perceptional, epistemological sensation during and \"after\" playing gBrainy. \nIf you see change (only over longer periods of time) in your ability of logical thinking, memory increase (the ability of remembering) and an increased mathematical understanding, then you could use these as an indicator for success. \nHowever so, i strongly doubt, that gBrainy (alone) is a source of success, since the human brain demands so much more to satisfy its need for improvement, at the same time it definitely does no harm either in that respect, apart from consuming your precious time, which could be used more efficiently on other tasks. (:\nI suggest two things: \n\n\n*\n\n*Try a few other programs (trial versions) as well, and see, if you like them:\nCriterion: GUI | Variety of user choices | level of difficulty etc..\n\n*The combination of different input sources mostly do the trick.\nFor instance, your visual cortex highly differentiates between visual and audio-visual sources. The audio-visual effect causes your brain, not only to change the pattern, it also attempts the effort to combine different areas of the brain and increases neuro-electric stimulus, since the perceptual demand is higher to cope with the experienced information, but as said before, if you only keep your brain going with digital input, you'll neglect other important parts and pathways of it.\nIt is a good idea, to grab a good book once in a while, especially to train the memory and give the eyes a good rest from all the moving imagery. Remember, that in the past thousand years, humanity archived incredible cognitive ideas, art, solutions etc.. without computers.\nPsychoactive Plants are also interesting in this regard (so i heard as a good citizen!)\nI don't know about your interests, but good and interesting books like these \"The Art of Seeing\", by Aldous Huxley, or \"The Hermetic Tradition\" by Giordano Bruno are quite recommendable, and so is history, psychology, philosophy etc..\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10, Wireless Connection but no internet Right after installing Ubuntu 11.10 using the wubi.exe file, I tried to surf the web in Ubuntu.

Would it break my system?  Are the structures of Ubuntu Precise and Debian Sid repositories fundamentally different somehow?\n\nA: If you do that, it may seem to work initially.  What it means is you're getting the packages before Ubuntu customizes/changes things.  \nUsing part of one and part of the other takes away a LOT of ability to troubleshoot issues from both sides.  Debian users won't be able to help you as much because much of your distro is Ubuntu.  Ubuntu users won't be able to help you as much because some of your distro is Debian.  \nIt's a great thing to do if you're trying to get a package into a ppa/repo.  Distribution wide, it's probably not a great idea in my opinion.\n\nA: You're mixing two different distributions' packages together. For various reasons, this is a bad idea:\n\n\n*\n\n*Security. \n\n*Stability.\n\n*Conflicting updates, which you have right now.\n\n*If you let above updates go through, you encounter the first two problems, and then you're in deep trouble if say, as an example a kernel update comes through! \nAlso, this makes getting an accurate bug report or stacktrace almost impossible, if not entirely impossible.\nIn short, if you need Debian sid, run sid. Otherwise, run Ubuntu, and just add newer software you want to via a PPA or backports.\nMore explanations here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How is Ubuntu different from Debian?\n\n*How is Ubuntu more updated than Debian?\n\nA: If you want to take third party deb packages, I suggest you download them one by one, and then install them one by one using gdebi (of course, you have to install gdebi first).\nGdebi is a great tool to install deb package manually. Gdebi will tell you the dependency chain of the applicatio you want and you could install them with safe. If in the end you don't get all dependencies satisfied, it is better and more safe to install it from source.\n\nA: You don't need a Debian sid repository to install the latest release of a package (octave 3.6)..\nThere is a PPA in Launchpad for this.\n\n\n*\n\n*What are PPAs and how do I use them?\n\nA: This might be necessary if you need a package currently not available in your ubuntu release.\nMy suggestion is to use apt-pin.\nI created /etc/apt/preferences.d/unstable with following content\nPackage: *\nPin: release v=12.04, l=Ubuntu\nPin-Priority: 1000\n\nPackage: *\nPin: release a=unstable\nPin-Priority: 600\n\nThis ensures that the basic distribution always takes precedence.

At the beggining of my Ubuntu usage it was all right, but from about 2-4 weeks I've got this problem: Whenever I try to reach my HDD, i have to open it first by files explorer.\nExample: I use text editor. Last file fails to load, so I got to open it manually. It's in bookmarked file.  I want to reach my bookmark, which is on HDD(partition for both Ubuntu and Windows , NTFS). If i want to reach my bookmark, i have to go there manually(or at least to HDD, then bookmarks pops up).\nIt also doesn't appear at my side bar until i use it.\nIt kinda looks like it wasn't mounted till then, I don't know.\nIt would be nice if I could deal with it, let's say, automatically.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: When you have the system set to automatically mount drives when opened, as you do, then when you access it with the file manager, it gets mounted at /media/name, where name is either the label or number.  You can see the path in Nautilus by pressing Ctrl-L, which will expose the full path in the Location bar above the file listing (you can type in this bar, which is handy).\nIf you want a partition to be available all the time, you can manually mount it or have it mounted automatically by making an entry in a configuration file /etc/fstab.  It seems complicated at first, but after you've done it a few times, it starts becoming easy.  Being NTFS makes it slightly harder due to the way permissions are handled, but the way I do it is thusly:\nIn a terminal, enter the following command (informational, makes no changes):\nsudo blkid -c /dev/null\nThis will list all the partitions, along with the labels, UUIDs, and type.  This is all the information you need to mount the partition.\nYou will need to find the partition(s) you wish to mount from the list.  The windows partition will be listed with TYPE=\"ntfs\".\nTo make it automatically mount on startup, you will want to first decide on where to mount it. This depends on whether your system is only used by you, or shared.  If it's only used by you, the easiest way is to create an empty folder in your home directory, using whatever name you want, such as \"windows\".  Then, edit the file /etc/fstab, using sudo.  If you use gedit, enter sudo gedit /etc/fstab in the terminal.\nSkip to the bottom and add a single line like this (assuming your username = username, and the UUID is 012345678987654321 for the example):\nUUID=012345678987654321  /home/username/windows  ntfs auto,users,uid=username,gid=username,utf8,dmask=002,fmask=113  0  0\nTo test it out, you can manually enter a command to mount everything in fstab:\nsudo mount -a\nWhat this does is try to mount all lines listed in fstab; if there is a problem, it will tell you right away, and you can either figure it out on your own, or ask back here.\nIf it works, you will see your windows partition in your home directory.\nIf you want to mount it in the /media folder, you'll need to do a bit more work, as you will need to set the permissions for the folder which belongs normally to root.\n", "Q: Swap Mouse Buttons on startup This one bugs me. \nI fashioned this handy script to swap the left and right mouse buttons over: [My mouse is a Razer]\n/usr/bin/xinput set-button-map `xinput list | grep 'Razer' | grep -o \\=[0-9]* | grep -o [0-9]*$` 3 2 1 4 5 6 7 8 1 10 11 12 13\n\nWhen I run this in a Terminal it works. \nWhen I go to Startup Application Preferences -> Add and then literally paste the above into the command field as an 'Additional startup program' It does not run on startup. \nWhy not?\nI'm using Ubuntu 11-10 but this also applied to the 10-10\n\nA: I've had various things like that fail before. I'm honestly not sure if it's just a problem with the way the commands are stored or an issue with whatever limited environment these commands are run with.\nEither way there are two options that have both worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Write a little bash script. It can pretty much be your command with a #!/bin/bash stanza at the top (I've broken it up to read better):\n#!/bin/bash\n\nDEV=$(xinput list | grep 'Razer' | grep -o \\=[0-9]* | grep -o [0-9]*$)\n/usr/bin/xinput set-button-map $DEV 3 2 1 4 5 6 7 8 1 10 11 12 13\n\nThen just save that somewhere like ~/.mousescript and call bash ~/.mousescript as your start-up command.\n\n*Or just wrap your command in bash:\nbash -c \"/usr/bin/xinput set-button-map `xinput list | grep 'Razer' | grep -o \\=[0-9]* | grep -o [0-9]*$` 3 2 1 4 5 6 7 8 1 10 11 12 13\"\n\n", "Q: How to set the desktop to $HOME/Desktop?

Often times I run a program that requires a lot of memory and as a result I can see some of the data is copied from the physical memory into swap. However, once the program is terminated, and the physical memory is freed I can still see a considerable amount of data on swap which significantly slows down the system and is annoying!\nWhat is the reason behind this and how does the OS decide which part of data should go to swap? How long is this data supposed to be there and how is it \"freed\"?\n\nA: I'm simplifying things but there are only two instances where paged memory in swap is copied back out to physical RAM:\n\n\n*\n\n*There's a page fault (app tries to call memory mapped to swap).\n\n*You use sudo swapoff -a (et al) to turn swapping off.\n\n\nAnything else tends to be a waste of time. Memory in swap tends to be relatively unused, low trafficked stuff. The algorithm Linux uses things going into swap is LRU (Least Recently Used). If you find yourself in a situation where you're getting disk trashing and applications are stalling on page faults, the problem is simple to fix: you need more RAM.\nMemory just sitting in swap will not slow the computer. It only has that effect when something has to be stuck in swap and used.\nNote: As I said, I'm simplifying things here. Memory management is a absolutely huge topic and my few paragraphs don't do the algorithms, their designers or their implementers any justice. I've had my own share of battles with Linux memory and cache management over the years but something I've learnt so far: the Kernel devs know more than me. They set things up the way they are for a reason.\n\nA: If you frequently experience slowdown due to page swapping you likely need more memory.  Shutting down unused or low priority services and making other memory reducing adjustments may be used as a temporary stopgap. \n\nWhat is the reason behind this and how does the OS decide which part of data should go to swap? \n\nWhile your memory heavy process was running the memory management swapped out pages to make room for your process.  This is usually done on a Least Recently Used basis.  (Programs often have pages of memory which were required at one point, but no longer are.) \nIf you have multiple devices, you can break the page mapping by removing that swap partition.  This will force the pages into memory (although they may be swapped out fairly quickly).\n\nHow long is this data supposed to be there and how is it \"freed\"?\n\nOnce mapped to swap, pages may remain mapped to swap until the process is terminated at which point the pages are \"freed\".  Pages mapped to the swap space may be located in memory.  The page manager may maintain the mapping to prevent the need to remap the page if it needs to be swapped out again.\nSome slowdown while the pages are swapped into memory is to be expected.  Depending on memory demand and program scheduling, use of swap in known to significantly decrease performance.\nUsing sar or munin to monitor page in/out activity should enable you do see how long it takes to map active pages into memory.  Once they have been swapped back into memory they should stay there as long as memory is available. \nSome things which may increase swap performance. \n\n\n*\n\n*A dedicated swap partition located next to actively accessed partitions.  This reduces head latency when swapping is required.\n\n*Using a swap file located on the most heavily used partition.  This may reduce head latency. \n\n*A dedicated drive for the swap partition.  A number of I/O performance improvements apply.\n\n*Use of an SSD for swap space.  I/O is much faster than disk.  (A fast USB drive may also perform better than your disk, but measure I/O rates first.)\n\n\nSwap files and partitions can be added and removed from a running system.  Swap devices can be given different priorities to control which device is used first.  \n", "Q: How do I remove CompizConfig Settings Manager via the terminal? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I uninstall software? \n\nI've recently installed CCSM, and it was giving me a hard time. So all I'm asking is a terminal command line to remove it.\n\nA: You could sudo apt-get remove compizconfig-settings-manager\nOr if you want to remove the program and the downloaded package you could\nsudo apt-get purge compizconfig-settings-manager\nIf you are using aptitude (apt-get's big brother ^^) then do \nsudo aptitude remove compizconfig-settings-manager to remove it or  \nsudo aptitude purge compizconfig-settings-manager to eliminate the program and the downloaded package.\n", "Q: Effects still causing issues after uninstalling CCSM \nPossible Duplicate:\nThere's an issue with an Alpha/Beta Release of Ubuntu, what should I do? \n\nI've recently installed and uninstalled CCSM (CompizConfig Settings Manager), and after the uninstall, the effects were still there, and are very buggy. Any tips?\n\nA: Run unity --reset in a terminal to reset your Compiz settings.\n\nA: CCSM only configures Compiz. As you've seen, removing CCSM doesn't change the setting. CCSM is so buggy that it may not be included in the next Ubuntu release 12.04. There are a couple of applications out there that provide some setting of Compiz. The one that works for me consistently without bus is Ubuntu Tweak. Roland's suggestion of \"unity --reset\" is a good one to get back to a reasonable starting point. Ubuntu Tweak doesn't provide all the configuration opportunities of CCSM but what it has works. My suggestion is before updating to 12.04 which is still in beta consider trying Ubuntu Tweak as it with 11.10 will give you a stable system. You can get Ubuntu Tweak by following the instructions at http://ubuntu-tweak.com.\n\nA: Just to mention about installing/removing ccsm. When you install ccsm nothing changes at all other then 2 additional plugin packages are installed. All of the newly installed plugins are disabled by default, so your install is the same \nWhen you remove it nothing changes either, all that's gone is the easiest way to set compiz plugins, whether to improve or sometimes not, & if need be fix.\nSo if your going to adjust compiz plugins & aren't sure of or remember your changes then probably better to create a new usr. You can fool around all you want to see what's what. \nWhen done or if things get stuffed just delete the user.\n\nA: as you mentioned in above command , to update your system .\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\ndo this in your terminal . \n", "Q: Microscope Support I work in a medical place where they want to move to Linux (And guess which Distro I will recommend ^^ ). But before I do this I need to find if there is such support for Microscopes in Ubuntu. In this specific case this model: http://www.leica-microsystems.com/products/light-microscopes/clinical/upright-microscopes/details/product/leica-dm1000-led/\n\nWhich is the one they are using in the lab. It includes a PCI Card that manages the Microscope.\n\nA: As far as we can see from the comments connecting the microscope to a computer needs an additional PCI-card. This is likely to be a Firewire port for an optional camera for image acquisition.\nIn that case we depend on proprietary drivers and software that are most likely not available for a Linux system unless the manufacturer decides to develop such a solution (contact them if you feel this is needed). A Firewire solution may also make the integration of proprietary Windows software via a virtual machine difficult.\nAn alternative would therefore be to mount a microscope camera attached to a standard USB port. It would then be much easier to get the data in either by a Linux driver or by running custom software through a virtual machine.\nWe have good experience with a Jenoptic ProgRes camera that can be attached to USB and gives a decent image qualitity. Unfortunately the default software that comes with this camera runs on Windows or MacOS only. There also is a Java plugin for the public domain ImageJ image processing software that may be worth a look (we have not tested this software here yet). There is also a Linux SDK and limited Linux drivers available for the Firewire camera models.\n", "Q: Change user's primary group - have new files made in that group I am setting up an environment where I am giving several users SSH access on my server. They are all trusted, but I want to corral them into a segment of the filesystem.  I created the users like so:\nadduser username -ingroup groupname\n\nwhich works well enough. When I log in as one of them I can do this and get all the right answers:\n$id -r -u -n\nusername\n$id -r -g -n\ngroupname\n\nI switched my own user account's primary group to groupname by doing this:\n$usermod myuser groupname\n\nI then logged out and back in.

Since the IE 6.0 was added to allow Picasa 3.9 login, I'm concerned about entering my Google account credentials, should I be?\nThanks.\n\nA: Adding Wine of Winetricks does not make your system vulnerable.\nHowever, applications which run in Wine are vulnerable as if they were on Windows, in the sense that if you for example run IE6, it is suceptable to vulnerabilities just as if it were running on Windows. To make it more secure, you can use a Firewall, and only use it to login the one time that is needed.

I use this extension called Website Blocker to discourage me from checking Gmail/Reddit. However, it is easy and tempting to open a New Incognito Window; since extensions are disabled in Incognito Mode, I'm still able to browse Gmail/Reddit while in Incognito.\nIs there any way to disable Chrome's Incognito Mode in Ubuntu? Ideally, this would encourage me to use my smartphone as a dedicated Gmail/Reddit checker.\n\nA: This doesn't directly answer your question, but rather than disabling incognito mode, you can instead enable the extension in incognito mode windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the spanner icon and then pick Tools -> Extensions from the menu.\n\n*Next to the extension you're interested in, click the expander arrow.\n\n*Check the \"Allow in incognito\" check box that is revealed.\n\n\nNow the extension will be active in future incognito mode windows you open.\nThe caveat is that if the extension stores any information about your browsing history, your incognito browsing habits may not be as private as before.  If the extension simply blocks certain URLs from loading though, this might not be a concern.\n\nA: To disable incognito on chrome/chromium you need to edit the policies. Doing this will prevent you from opening an incognito window via Ctrl+Shift+n, and will also grey out the incognito window option in the options tab in the corner. \nIf you're using chrome, create the folder /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed. \nOr if you're using chromium, create the folder /etc/chromium/policies/managed.\nThen create a file in that directory named test_policy.json.

When I play a video (H264 MPEG4 AVC 320x180) online (in Firefox or Chrome) it uses to consume up to 100% CPU, but if I download it (exactly the file played) and use VLC - it takes just 5% (6% at maximum). Why does this happen and what can I do to make on-line players more efficient?\nPS: The video card is Intel GMA X4500HD.\n\nA: The probable reason is that the Flash plugin cannot take advantage of any kind of hardware acceleration supported by your graphics card driver. Everything is then decoded using the CPU.\nThe Intel drivers present in your system allow VLC to use your GPU instead of your CPU to render the movie with video acceleration which is much better for obvious reasons.\nAlso, Flash hardware acceleration API (Stage Video) requires developers to actually add support for it into their video player SWFs.\nIf the video player does not have built in support for it even if the version of Flash you have does have VA enabled and your drivers support it (seems they do since VLC is apparently using it) your video will be decoded via the CPU.\n", "Q: How do I find out what webcam driver is in use?

I have just turned on my PC and have two applications running; Thunderbird and Firefox. Whatever else is running is part of Ubuntu's feature set (as well as a few indicators).\nThis has been ongoing for weeks, so I'm not sure if it's normal behaviour or not.\nRight now, my memory usage indicator says that Ubuntu is using 41% of my 6GB of RAM. I haven't even opened Gimp or my other day-to-day things. I'll be buying another 6GB of RAM, this week, so that I don't run out when using Gimp or Openshot, for example.\nAn overview of my running applications shows that Nautilus is using the most, yet it isn't even open. This seems a little excessive, or am I missing something?\n\n\nA: Try running the command free -m in a terminal, and look at the second line. It shows memory usage minus memory used for caching. For instance, my basement server has the following memory usage:\n                   total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\n Mem:               2003       1663       340          0        601        462\n -/+ buffers/cache:            599       1404\n Swap:             9536         21       9515\n\nMy server uses 1663Mb memory, but only 599Mb is allocated by processes. The rest of the memory is used by the kernel as cache, so 1404Mb is free to use. Remember that totally unused memory is wasted memory. If memory is not used by processes, it should be used to cache disc etc. For instance, if you close Firefox, the program could be kept in memory so it starts faster the next time you need it. If the memory is needed by an application, it will be allocated without the need to swap it to disk.\nAnother thing that your screenshot doesn't tell you is how much memory is used by shared libraries, code shared between different processes of the same program etc. For instance, the different gwibber-service processes probably share much of the memory. If you want the whole picture, you need to look at virtual memory, resident memory, shared memory etc (available in the preferences). \nAs long as you don't feel the sluggishness of the machine swapping out memory to disk, you don't need to worry at all. \n\nA: The most likely reason that nautilus is open is that it is used to draw the Desktop- any icons you have on the desktop, as well as the wallpaper (I think) are being handled by nautilus. However, its memory usage does seem pretty excessive. All the other services seem to be more or less within a normal range, although I'm not sure why there would be so many gwibber processes.\nHave you set your desktop to do anything out of the ordinary, like displaying the contents of your home folder, or using some kind of animated background? What happens to the nautilus process if you run killall nautilus in a terminal? Does it consume the same amount of memory when it starts back up?\n", "Q: No Audio Output on an Asus G74S In 11.10 on an Asus G74S I have no audio output.

I have read something like\n\nBoot from the CD and use gparts\n\nThat doesn't mean anything to me, so if that's what I need to do, please explain how to do that specifically.\n\nA: From your filesystem structure it seems like you've installed Ubuntu as a guest OS on your Windows using Wubi. When you installed it you specified 17G as the size of the virtual disk that Ubuntu can use - This is your /dev/loop0.\nThe /dev/sda2 is the disk of your Windows partition and therefore can not be resized to move space from it to the Ubuntu partition.\nHowever, there is still a way to resize the virtual disk size of Wubi and is described in the WubiGuide which references to a simple script the you can download and execute.

[GPU temperature] I have an old laptop with a GeForce G 105M running ubuntu server without gui and the fan is always blowing because the GPU never goes under 60ºC with the computer completely idle!\nIs this normal or some kind of hardware malfunction? \n\nA: Normally I would suggest ripping out the graphics card but that's usually not an option in laptops. It might be worth exploring though.\nWhen you run a graphical environment, most users use the nvidia kernel module. This manages the power consumption of the graphics card by helping scale back the clock speed when it's under lower loads and upps the fan speed when required.\nWhen you're in the server mode the only graphics are the text-mode TTY displays. These won't use any real power but the graphics are active. You card is still going to be turned on and without the right driver it might be pulling more power than it actually needs.\nI'm honestly not sure what's happening in Ubuntu server. I would assume nouveau (the open source driver) is being loaded but I'm not certain. That might also depend on the kernel you're using. Because I'm uncertain it might be worth experimenting.\nHere are two separate options for you. Try them separately and see what happens with fan speed and temperature:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is nouveau running? Find out by running lsmod | grep nouv. If it is, try blacklisting it. That's as simple as sticking blacklist nouveau at the end of /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf.\n\n*If that doesn't help try installing the real nvidia driver.

In the spell checker menu I find about 30 localized dictionaries (all Spanish-speaking countries, and for English: US, England, Canada).\nIt's quite annoying that every time I need to look for the single proper dictionary, I see all this heap of other dictionaries (useless for me).\nIs there any way to remove the unused dictionaries from the menu and leave 2 or 3 that I really use?\n\nA: The solution I found is delete unused dictionaries from /usr/share/myspell/dicts. \n*.dic and *.aff files, and leave only the three languages I use: en-US.dic, en-US.aff, es.dic, es-ES.dic, es-ES.aff. \nBackup the whole directory before delete anything.\n\nA: What I did:\n\n*\n\n*Deleting the dictionaries symbolic link in /usr/lib/thunderbird/\n\n*Installing the dictionaries manually (Tools > Options or Edit > Preferences, then Composition, and click on Download More Dictionaries).\n\n*Adding a dpkg-divert rule to prevent the link to be restored each time Thunderbird is updated.\n\nFrom a command line, type:\nsudo rm /usr/lib/thunderbird/dictionaries\nsudo dpkg-divert --no-rename --add /usr/lib/thunderbird/dictionaries\n\nAnd then install the dictionaries you want in Thunderbird as explained above.\n\nA: According to https://askubuntu.com/a/301951, there are two locations:\n\n\n*\n\n*/usr/share/hunspell/\n\n*/home/me/.thunderbird/o5sgu7z7.default/extensions (o5sgu7z7 will be different in your case)\n\n\nA: On my system I had a whole bunch of hunspell-en-* packages installed.\nThe following command got rid of them and these dictionaries disappeared from the menu:\nsudo apt purge hunspell-en-ca hunspell-en-gb hunspell-en-za\n\n\nA: A first, likely simpler solution can be achieved by GUI on some systems. Check for a menu like \"language settings\" and a point \"supported languages\". There you can remove whole languages in one go.\nFor more fine grained control (e.g. removing language dialects) see below.\nA full solution can be found by combining the existing answers:\nThere are multiple locations for the languages (dictionaries):\n\n\n*\n\n*/usr/share/myspell/dicts\n\n*/usr/share/hunspell\n\n*/usr/lib/thunderbird/dictionaries (which is just a symlink to /usr/share/hunspell)\n\n\n(from Ringtail, Chris and Calimos answer)\nThese are system installed dictionaries. So to cleanly remove them you have to sudo apt remove the packages that installed the files. To find out which packages those reside in you can use apt-file search <path/to/file>. \nRelevant packages are:\n\n\n*\n\n*mythes-*\n\n*hyphen-*\n\n*hunspell-*\n\n\nYou can put all 3 into a sudo apt remove, check the matches before confirming (WARNING: confirming it would remove ALL dictionaries which is usually not what you want) and abort. Then copy&past the relevant packages into a fresh command.\nAlternatively start with e.g. sudo apt remove hunspell-<TAB> and let autocompletion list the installed packages.\nExample:\nsudo apt remove hunspell-ru hyphen-ru mythes-ru\n\nThis would remove all russian language stuff.\n\nA: As an alternative to removing the dictionaries, you can change the spellchecking dictionary quickly without removing your hands from the keyboard.

Install tor  which will install polipo as a recommended package.\nWhat you need to configure is polipo/privoxy for tor as your are using http proxy. Tor doesnot use 8118 as its port it uses 9050 and it is a socks proxy. You can use this configuration for polipo to use with tor. Just do:\nsudo wget https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbrowser.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/build-scripts/config/polipo.conf -O /etc/polipo/config\nsudo service tor stop && sudo service polipo stop \nsudo service tor start && sudo service polipo start\ntor needs to start before polipo, or else polipo will occupy the 9050 port and tor will start with errors\nI am giving much focus here on polipo because tor itself recommends polipo and is installed by default on tor installation. You can use privoxy in place of polipo as well. Most of the tor users recommend using the default socks proxy if the application handles it.\nIf you want to connect everything through tor you need to set system proxy with System Settings > Network > Network Proxy\nAnd then setup proxy to 127.0.0.1 and port to 8118. Use socks proxy where supported just change port to 9050 and type to socks5.\nOptionally, install any browser proxy switch addons, I use chromium with proxyswitchy. Similary choose one for firefox if you use firefox. AFAIK pidgin, xchat, thunderbird support socks5 proxy. I think firefox also supports socks5. \nTor check failed though Vidalia shows green onion \n\nA: If you are having trouble setting up Tor, a better option is often to use the Tor Browser Bundle, available at the tor website. The browser bundle does not need to be installed, you just run the start-tor-browser executable in the folder, once you've extracted it with Archive Manager.\n\nA: Assuming that \"Vidalia\" is the process you want to stop, run the following from a terminal:\nps -ef | grep Vidalia\n\nFind the process in the result set, and look for the PID (Process ID).  Assuming a PID of 31559, you can terminate the process with the following:\nsudo kill -9 31559\n\n\nA: I had the very same problem and here's the solution which was helpful to me:\nCause(observed):\nThe message you are getting when you switch on vidalia and consequently when vidalia tries to connect you to the tor network is because tor is set run on startup, meaning when you start vidalia there is already an instance of tor running on your OS and therefore it can't start another(maybe tor is programmed to one instance per session).\nSolution(1):\nSince tor is already running, use sudo ps -ax |grep tor to confirm, all you need is to configure your browser to route traffic through tor which i suppose you haven't. See \"Browser config\" below.\nSolution(2):\nIf you want to operate, customize and/or switch on/off tor easily without the cryptic CLI then you might want to use vidalia. And for that:\nsudo killall tor so that vidalia can launch tor as its child\nthen ask vidalia to connect you to the tor network and hopefully it will work.\nBrowser config:\nSet your browser to use SOCKS proxy (v5 works, haven't tested it for v4) , ip address:127.0.0.1 and port:9050 when you want to use tor otherwise do not disturb this.\nNote that tor will automatically run on each startup, so you'll have to kill it on each and every startup if you want to connect to tor using vidalia. The automatic cure to that which i choose was to use upstart because i didn't want to dig in the tor configs. Squashing is relatively easier.\nIf your ISP requires you to connect to the internet through proxy server then you'll have to set vidalia to use that proxy setting in order to connect to tor.\nNote to readers i aint an expert hacker and many a things i've stated here are based on my observation which seemed quite plausible and might be wrong so please make corrections where ever needed.\n", "Q: Can I install LAMP server on Ubuntu One private cloud? Is this possible to install apache server, MySQL database, and PHP on the Ubuntu One private cloud?\nCan I use a Ubuntu One private cloud as my personal web server?\nIf yes, then how?\n\nA: No. UbuntuOne is a could personal files storage system, it will not run the services for you.\nHaving said that you can have a service running in your computer and have those files be stored in the cloud, that would mean that your computer is responsible for the reply to any request done in a running server (HTTP server, SQL server or anything else) and would use your stored files in the UbuntuOne.\nThat would have serious degradation in the performance making it hard to justify since any change done in your local files would be then synchronized to the UbuntuOne servers, 1 request once in a while is fine, turn that to a few dozen and it would just burst.\nA better option for that type of features is really use something like Amazon EC2 instance and have your services running there.

Unfortunatelly Quickly builds package with source python files (.py) and I want not to include source files. The same problem is with Bazaar plugin for building packages.\nHow can I make deb package without sources which compiles .py files during installation, so there will be no source files in the system?\n\nA: Python is an interpreted scripting language. You don't just distribute the intermediate .pyc files because they're compiled for your system and won't make sense elsewhere. You distribute the source and that's compiled on the fly.\nThat's not to say you can't just distribute .pyc files. PEP 3147 allows this and sets out a structure but it does come at a cost and I'm not even sure it would stop you regenerating the source (via various introspection methods) - but this is not what Quickly is designed for; it's not going to help you build a package like this.\nIf you're trying to distribute a closed source application there are things like py2exe (Windows only) and bbfreeze (all) but none of them are perfect or completely irreversible. You can look at obfuscation methods if you want to further protect your source.\n\nA: There's really no way of hiding Python source code and prevent the users from being able to know what you do to their systems. However, that does not mean that the program has to be Open Source. That depends on the license and you can use which license you want. Being able to read the source code does not mean that the user is allowed to edit it, or redistribute it. That's up to you. This is true for all high-level languages. Web applications, for instance, always have their source code visible to the user. That doesn't mean you are allowed to use it in other projects without the developers permission.\nYou might want to have a look at the Geanie language. It is a new language that has features similar to Java/C#, but with a syntax that resembles Python. Genie compiles to C, which means it's platform independent, but also that it is extremely fast. And C, of course, compiles to native code. \nUnfortunately, Quickly doesn't have templates for Genie yet. \n", "Q: Debugging the execution order of Upstart jobs I'd like to be able to debug the execution order of the jobs started by Upstart (ideally without injecting dumping code into every job file).  How can I do this?\n\nA: Boot your system adding '--debug' to the grub command line, and once the system has booted, look at your system log file (for example '/var/log/syslog' on modern versions of Ubuntu).

I just want the two programs to launch silently and only show up as tray icons, without opening their windows every time at startup.\nI can't seem to find any such option in either of them.\n\nA: Skype has an option to start minimized, which can be reached by clicking on your options menu and activate the appropriate checkbox as shown here:\n\nPidgin is working in a different behaviour and no \"start minimized\" checkbox somewhere, insted you can define the opening behavior by closing pidgin in the desired way, it means: close pidgin while minimized to tray and it will open the same way it was when closed.

Let’s write a shell script:\n\n#!/bin/bash\nperl -pi -e \"s/pref name='(list_visible|list_maximized)' type='bool' value='[1-9]'/pref name='\\$1' type='bool' value='0'/gi\" ~/.purple/prefs.xml\n/usr/bin/pidgin &\n\n\nThe first perl command searches\n  the list_visible and list_maximized properties and replaces their\n  values with 0 before Pidgin starts.

I am quite tempted by a Western Digital my book live because of autobackup from Windows and the ability to access the files on the network and also through a personal cloud. At home I have a mixture of Win 7, Xp and Ubuntu 11.04, 11.10 (though shortly both will be 12.04)\nI am looking for a personal cloud like solution that I can use to both back up and access from windows and Linux. I want autoback preferably from Linux and Windows.As I have a mix of OS I wondered how well these drives play with both OS.\n\nA: If you have a ton of files, be them music files, videos, raw data or if you are just looking to expand your hard drive space for the heck of it… you simply can not go wrong with the MyBook line of products. \nI now have over 3 terabytes worth of storage at my beckoning call and I could not be happier. Invest in a MyBook and you will be happy you did.\nLook at the USB 3 model it will also work with USB 2 with the pigtail adapter. The 7200 RPM drive is also very fast. Comes plug n play for Windows. \n\nA: At a high level, the actual equipment you use doesn't matter, it's all\ncompatible. What really needs addressing is the configuration of that\nequipment and the software to drive it. It's a pretty tall order and there\nis risk here sharing files between two operating systems. You've got two\nmain concepts here: backup and file sharing.\nA hardware free solution would be to give up on the local harddrive and\ngo with a solution like Ubuntu One, that gets the multi-OS sharing\nrequirement down, but not back up (yet anyways), it will sync all your files\nthough.\nDepending on how you execute your backup will directly impact how those \nfiles are shared. For example, using something like duplicity on Linux,\nall the files are compiled into archives and then expanded incrementally,\nyou can't browse the backups. You can restore from any point in time but\nthe trade off is you don't have immediate access to them. You need to settle\non what \"backup\" means to you and stick with that notion, if that means just\nthe latest copy of everything that matters to you mirrored somewhere else, then\nthings get a lot easier. However if you're considering backup in the traditional\nsense, which is incremental, what you're asking for, to my knowledge, doesn't exist,\nand would need to custom written.\nLet's keep it simple for the sake of argument and suppose you want to do a straight\nmirror of the files, like a snapshot, no incrementals. Now you still have the problem\nof sharing files between to different operating systems. You have to compromise on\nthe filesystem here, like FAT32, so both Linux and Windows can have an easy time sharing volume. There are trade offs however, as FAT32 doesn't support UNIX symlinks.\nDon't get fooled into using something like NTFS between the two, the Linux support has issues supporting WRITE and can corrupt the filesystem.\nOnce you've settled on the filesystem, you then need to really think about how the\nautomatic backups will function and what demands they'll make of the filesystem you\ndid choose. It may come to be that the software the WD comes with just doesn't work well with FAT32, in which case you'll need to search for a new solution. I would suggest searching for cross platform backup solutions first and then build out your configuration from there.\nFinally, backup means backup, if you have a single disk, and it's not part of a redundant array, that disk goes bad and you've lost everything. Backup systems should really be atleast RAID1 with a hotspare on hand.\nI give up on maintaining piles of HW after doing this for a better part of a decade and created a hybrid solution, using duplicity, an external disk and rsync.net, my backups are replicated to both. So if I have a problem, I can restore from the local external disk, which is fast, no network. If that drive fails too, I either replace it, or restore the computer directly. No local RAID array humming at home, no additional HW for care and feeding, I maintain only what I need, as I have better things to do.\nNow what I just illustrated isn't a cross platform solution, which is even harder to pull off. There's a reason why these online cloud sharing solutions like U1 and dropbox are so popular, they just work. If you've got the time and inclination, you could probably create a custom solution too, but you also would need to understand how it works well enough to troubleshoot it. After all, what good is a backup if the system you deployed malfunctions, breaks down, and you lack the time/inclination/expertise to bring it online again?\n", "Q: Screen dims on opening certain applications on Macbook I have ubuntu 11.10 installed on an old 2008 macbook. There is an issue of screen dimming that I didnt find anywhere else on the forums. \nThe issue is that the screen is dimmed when I open certain applications (Firefox, Software Center) and this cannot be readjusted by the physical brightness buttons on the keyboard.

Firefox and Ubuntu software center at times take time to start on my machine, and the screen is dimmed when i open them, but i recover in few seconds.\n Can you confirm that it happens only during opening certain applications? waiting for a while is all that is needed. But still, you will be able to open dash, open terminal with <ctrl>+<alt>+t and switch workspaces using <ctrl>+<alt>+<arrow keys>.\nIf absolutely nothing works, Then its a different thing.

And I have just installed Ubuntu 11.10 in my Dell laptop. When I plugged my WD external hard drive in, it read the first time, but since I have a unlock.exe file (password for the hard drive). So I installed Wine to read it. But it gives me an error. I restart the machine, and plugged the hard drive in again. And it is not recognized anymore. Can anybody help me, please?\nThank you!\n\nA: According to http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1672368&page=2\nWD Passport needs to be unlocked using Windows or Mac before they can be used. Take the drive to a Mac or PC and run the Unlock application or the WD Smartware Utilities to enable access to the writable partition, then format it. If the drive is missing the unlocking apps, you can download the software kit for Mac and PC from WD's support pages.\nIn an extreme situation you can use http://www.hdd-tools.com/products/rrs/howto/ I don't know if they can be trusted. As you can see HDDs could be simply unlocked using these tools, so to be safe encrypt your data yourself before storing it on your drive.\n======\nI just asked people at WD, they said there is no way you can unlock from any Linux distribution, including Ubuntu, not even wine can do that.\n\nA: First you have to disable the unlock.exe while you're in windows.  Use the WD smartware program (you can dl it from their website), go to settings, enter your passoword, choose \"remove security,\" and then update settings.  Now it doesn't have a password anymore, so you should at least be able to mount and access it in linux.\n\nA: As far as it concerns a pure ubuntu solution, there is an interesting how to for removing the security functionality of WD MyPassport hard drive on ubuntu using hdparm and the master password 'WDCWDCWDCWDCWDCWDCWDCWDCWDCWDCW', which could differ for various models.\nHowever, it is recommended to use up-to-date SmartWare on Windows, since it is intended this way.\nFollowing the instructions of this nice article, i got my external WD HDD mounted and running on ubuntu like every other USB-Storage.\nIn essence you do the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the drive on Windows\n\n*Update WD Smartware and Disk Firmware\n\n*Disable the virtual CD and remove password under settings in WD SmartWare\n\n*Using palimpsest on ubuntu \n\n*\n\n*Delete all partition and create a new Master Boot Record\n\n*Create an empty partition\n\n*format it using an linux/bsd file system.\n\n\n\nIs is possible to reformat it to any FS you want, afterwards.\n", "Q: How do I host my own Bazaar shared repositories?
