["Q: Do the current Apple USB Keyboards support charging the iPad? As the new owner of an iPad, it was disappointing, but not surprising, to see a \"not charging\" in the upper right hand corner of my iPad when I connected it via USB to my Apple Keyboard from 2007. However, connecting it directly to my MacBook Pro from 2010 does charge the iPad, so it seems it's just a simple matter of my USB keyboard not drawing enough power. \nIs this something that Apple has updated/changed about their USB keyboard since I bought mine in 2007? The products are otherwise identical. If not Apple, are there any third parties that have keyboards that will supply the necessary power to charge an iPad?\n\nA: This is standard.  The keyboard USB port gives you enough power for a mouse, but not enough for most other devices.\n\nA: Looking at this the other way, iPads want far more than the \"standard\" charge when in operation and show \"not charging\" to let you know that although power is present, the battery will not take any significant charging while not sleeping.\nThe article Apple Computers and Displays: Powering peripherals through USB is the canonical list of situations where Apple detects and sends more power downstream to operate things like the MacBook Air superdrive, the iPad and even iPhone and iPod now can take far more current to charge when connected directly to an Apple display or computer.\n\nA: Yes, but only with the iPad in sleep mode.\nThe iPad requires at least 500mA from a USB port:\n\nApple peripheral devices may request more than 500 mA (Milliamps) at 5 V (Volts) from a port to function or to allow for faster charging. Such Apple peripheral devices include:\n\n*\n\n*iPad\n\n*iPhone\n\n*Alluminum Wired Keyboard*\n\n\nAbout wired keyboard we get the information:\n\n*When connected to a computer that supports a connection of 1100 mA at 5 V, the first port on the keyboard to have a device or peripheral connected to it that requests standard 500mA power will receive that power. At that point, 100 mA at 5 V is available through the remaining port on this keyboard. This keyboard does not support extra power out of its two ports simultaneously; it requests extra power from the host computer to provide power out of either one of its two ports, then the second keyboard port receives the standard 500mA.\nNote: Apple computers and displays that were introduced before 2007 support only 500 mA at 5 V from their ports and do not offer additional power.\n\n[source 1 from support.apple.com]\nAs the wired keyboards can provide the minimum 500mA required by the iPad (just like older Macs can), it should be possible for it to power the iPad. However, it can not provide an additional current which would allow for faster charging.\nBut, the new iPad can only charge in sleep mode when connected to a low powered USB hub:\n\nThe fastest way to charge your iPad is with the included 10W USB Power Adapter. iPad will also charge, although more slowly, when attached to a computer with a high-power USB port (many recent Mac computers) or with an iPhone Power Adapter. When attached to a computer via a standard USB port (most PCs or older Mac computers) iPad will charge, but only when it's in sleep mode. Make sure your computer is on while charging iPad via USB. If iPad is connected to a computer that’s turned off or is in sleep or standby mode, the iPad battery will continue to drain.\n\n[source 2 from support.apple.com]\n\nA: The keyboard has a non-powered hub inside, and can only supply 100mA of power to any connected USB device.\nRecent Macs will support 1,000mA (1A), and some very recent might support 2,000mA (2A), but since the keyboard hub doesn't, then attached devices will still only receive 100mA, too little to charge an iPad.\nNewer hubs could support supplying more power when they are connected to 1A or 2A USB ports on the computer, but that's a very new standard (and it is now standard) so you're unlikely to find any, even apple products, that do so yet.\nYou can put a powered USB hub inbetween and get the standard 500mA, but if you want the fast charging you'll need to connect it directly to the USB port on the computer.\n\nA: Best solution for extra USB ports on a mac is to purchase a usb extension lead to plug directly into your mac - this will then give you four full powered extra sockets\n", "Q: VMware fast for first user, sluggish for second After launching VMware and opening the virtual machine prepared by another user, Windows 7 runs very slowly. File read/write is 10-30x slower than it should be and Windows has started to animate window move/resize, which brings the OS (or VMware?) to its knees.\nHow do I go about debugging the problem?\nClarification\nThe two users are two accounts on the very same MacBook. The two users share the same OSX, and so it seems reasonable for them to also share the same Windows VM.\nUpdate\nAfter yet another fresh installation of VMware + Windows 7, this time installed and used exclusively by one user, the same sluggishness is starting. There are a few suspicions.\nMds is going berzerk, for instance. Could it be that it is indexing (and interfering somehow) with the separate partition on which the windows VM is installed?\nThe sluggishness starts after a little use: the unzipping of my code and a few debugging cycles under windows. Could my going along with VMware's default of making the disk usage grow as needed be contributing to some fragmentation so early on? VMware, as I now see, suggest using the non-default (allocate disk storage from the first moment of install) for production use. (What other use is there? And how could the non-production use be the default?)\n\nA: \nHow do I go about debugging the problem?\n\nPassing VM images around is tricky business. The image is often created with hypervisor extensions that take advantage of specific hardware features on the machine where the VM was created. If you're not using precisely the same hardware (especially the same CPU) the VM can run slowly or even crash your host OS or lock up your CPU.\nI'd start with getting the VM back to an initial state:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete all the snapshots in the VM\n\n*Power down the guest OS so it's \"off\", not just suspended\n\n*Bring up the Virtual Machine Library window (Shift+Cmd+L) and select the VM\n\n*Click the Wrench icon in the toolbar to bring up the settings window for this VM\n\n*Select 'Advanced' and make sure the preferred virtualization engine is set to 'Automatic' and that hard disk buffering is also set to 'Automatic'\n\n*Click 'Show All' to return to the main settings\n\n*Click 'Compatibility' and make sure the VM's compatibility is set to be with the version of VMWare you're running or higher (in my case that's Fusion 4 or higher) so you don't need legacy VM capabilities maintained\n\n*Click 'Show All' and return to the main settings\n\n*Click 'Display' and make sure 3D graphic acceleration is on. If it cannot be turned on this is a pretty good hint that the VM was created with another chipset and really isn't compatible with your machine.\n\n*Click 'Show All' and return to the main settings\n\n*Click 'General' and then press the 'Clean Up Virtual Machine' button. This will get rid of all the extra cruft from snapshots and get you back to a nice clean VM image state.\n\n*Click 'Show All' and return to the main settings\n\n*Click 'Processors & RAM' and set these to suit your needs. You need at least 1 processor, but if you have a multi-core machine you could set this higher. Ideally you wouldn't ever set the number of processors in the VM to any more than Physical Cores in the Machine - 1. That way your physical machine always has one core to itself. RAM should be set to at least the recommended value. If you have a lot of RAM in the machine you can increase this but don't go too crazy with it.\n\n*Now power up the VM and do a re-install of the VMWare Tool (Virtual Machine -> Reinstall VMWare Tools...).\n\n\nOther things to consider:\n\n\n*\n\n*The VM should be on fast disk. This usually means your primary drive in your machine. If it's on a USB-attached disk or a network attached drive performance will suffer.\n\n*You can't both use the VM image at the same time. I say this in case you have it on a shared drive and you're both trying to run it at the same time. You have to make your own, unique copies of the image.\n\n*Check the Task Manager in the VM to see what's running. Maybe you have a process or two that's going off the rails and eating up all the VM CPU. If that's the case  you're in to a straight why-is-this-process-misbehaving-in-Windows type question and you'd need to take it to http://superuser.com I suspect.\n\n\nIf this doesn't get the VM in to a useable state it's likely that your hardware and the hardware the VM was created on are too far apart in compatibility for you to pass the VM around.\n\nA: Read VMware support article 1015676 to learn about the things that could be causing slowdowns and what you can do about them.\nAs standard practice, I change some memory management settings as I explain in this answer to another VMware performance question.  \nThings to check in particular, given \"mds going berzerk\": \n\n\n*\n\n*Exclude your VMs from Time Machine Backups\n\n*Disable Spotlight indexing on your FAT32 drive (if it's not already disabled), or at least for the folder you have your VMs in (by adding the folder to the System Preferences -> Spotlight -> Privacy tab). \n\n\nWith regard to pre-allocating disk space, whether or not that is a performance penalty or not or how big an impact it has on you completely depends on your disk usage pattern.  It is a performance hit to expand the size of the drive.  If you rarely delete stuff from the disk but often add stuff (especially if you are running programs that are generating files, e.g. log files or transcoded media files) then you will suffer the most.  If you download big files, use them, and then delete them, you'll probably end up with enough allocated free space to not notice the difference.\nYou can also experiment with: \n\n\n*\n\n*Enable hard drive buffering.  This was critical for me when my VM was on a RAID 5 array, but otherwise didn't matter.  VM settings -> Advanced, set \"Hard drive buffering\" to \"Enabled\"\n\n*Enable/Disable Windows Pagefile.  For a real computer the best advice is to leave the pagefile active and system managed under Windows 7 (as opposed to XP, where it is probably better to remove it if you have enough RAM).  For a VM using a virtual disk it is not as clear cut, but easy enough to test.  Follow these directions to get to the page file settings but instead of choosing a size, select \"No paging file\".  \n\n", "Q: At what point do iPads stop displaying \"not charging\" when connected to power? I am curious if anyone has measured directly or found an authoritative reference that documents at which point the various iPad will display charging and not \"not charging\" in the menu bar while operating. Apple publishes great information on how it's Computers and Displays will over supply power to select Apple devices well past the normal USB standard, but I can't find iPad specific information.\nI presumes this notification is based purely on a set amount of current being detected and not simply a net power surplus (since the load of an iPad can vary based on CPU/GPU, brightness and radio power consumption) calculation.\n\nA: The iPad manual (page 136) and other Apple documentation (see bottom) are not very specific in this regard meaning...\n\n\n*\n\n*...they do not state specific minimum currents required for charging.\n\n*...they only distinguish between:\n\n\n*\n\n*charging while the iPad is awake (USB hubs with 1100 mA; newer Macs/displays)\n\n*charging while the iPad is in sleep mode (USB hubs with 500 mA; standard USB/old Macs)\n\n\n\n\nLow-battery image or “Not Charging” message appears\n or \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*When charging, make sure you’re using the 10W USB power adapter that came with iPad or the USB port on a recent Mac. The fastest way to charge is to use the power adapter. \n  \n*For faster charging, turn iPad off.\n  \n*iPad may not charge when connected to the USB port on an older Mac, a PC, a keyboard, or to a USB hub.\n  \n*If your Mac or PC doesn’t provide enough power to charge iPad, a Not Charging message appears in the status bar. To charge iPad, disconnect it from your computer and connect it to a power outlet using the included Dock Connector to USB Cable and 10W USB power adapter.\n  \n\nAlso see the following documents:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPad: Charging the battery\n\n*Batteries: iPad\n", "Q: Is it possible to enable TRIM for an external SSD? I have an iMac from 2011, Mac OS X 10.6.8, and an SDD in a FW800/USB3 case.\nWhich interface can let me enable TRIM: USB2, USB3, FW800 or Thunderbolt ?\n\nA: According to OS X Daily, TRIM is enabled for all Apple SSDs, but not for third party drives. The article claims that a third party utility, Trim Enabler, turns on TRIM for third party drives as well. More details can be found on the developer's page. Note that this utility isn't officially supported by Apple, so you should back up before installing the utility.\nThe interface of the external drive shouldn't matter for TRIM support (USB 2, FW800, or Thunderbolt). However, please note that Macs did not begin to natively support USB 3  until June 2012- with your 2011 iMac you'd be using USB 2 with one of those drives.\n\nA: Yes, you can enable TRIM on an external SSD. I own a Lacie Rugged USB/Thunderbolt 128 GB drive and I enabled it with TRIM Enabler. I am using it as a boot drive.\nI do not know if it is smart to enable TRIM but I could not find any posts where it would stand that TRIM can harm your external SSD. \nBut for any case, I have multiple backups of my SSD drive.\n\nA: I realize this question is over 4 years old, but I'm adding a comment because this page was the first hit for a Google search on the subject and some of the comments are outdated whereas others were plain wrong.\nApple added native TRIM support in OS X 10.6.8 but only for Apple OEM SSDs. To get around that restriction, software such as Cindori's TRIM Enabler allowed TRIM to be used on 3rd party SSDs. Later, OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) introduced a security requirement called kext signing which prevented TRIM Enabler from working without completely turning off kext signing. Then in OS X 10.10.4, Apple introduced a “trimforce” command which enabled TRIM on 3rd party SSDs without turning off kext signing. (I have sources but Stack Exchange won't let me post more than 2 links)\nContrary to many of the comments here, the interface DOES matter. The vast majority of USB enclosures do not support TRIM, but allegedly there are some that support it such as the JMS 578 USB bridge controller (source: http://bbs.pceva.com.cn/thread-125643-1-1.html). All five of the USB 3 enclosures / docks I have support it. Firewire supposedly supports TRIM, but I haven't tested it. Most Thunderbolt enclosures should support TRIM, and I currently have TRIM enabled on a SanDisk Extreme SSD in an Akitio Thunderbolt 2 enclosure. I used the trimforce command in terminal to enable it.\nIn order to check if your enclosure supports TRIM, you’ll want to go to Apple > About This Mac > System Report > Hardware > SATA/SATA Express > and look for “TRIM Support” under the enclosure specs. If TRIM Support is not listed, your enclosure most likely does not support TRIM. If it is listed but says “No”, you can try turning TRIM on by using the trimforce command in terminal. Just open Terminal and type “sudo trimforce enable”. Once your computer restarts, check System Report again to see if TRIM Support changed to Yes.\nFinally, TRIM does matter, even for modern SSDs with sophisticated garbage collection. I experienced this firsthand when my SanDisk SSD started slowing down as it got older before enabling TRIM on it. There’s a good, but somewhat outdated article about it here: http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/04/ask-ars-my-ssd-does-garbage-collection-so-i-dont-need-trim-right/\n\nA: I have a Crucial 960gb m500 ssd that I put into a G drive thunderbolt/usb chassis a couple of years ago for time machine and random manual file backup.\nIt seems to have started slowing down recently with \"preparing backup\" msg that last for a couple of hours before doing the backup. I ran trim force with the drive attached via thunderbolt, My osx system report now says that trim is enabled\nfor this device. I'm waiting and seeing if it makes a difference! \n", "Q: OSX Mail how to mark message as not junk I have some mail messages that OSX Mail puts in my junk folder but does not show the header saying  \"Mail thinks this message is Junk Mail\" and so does not show the button allowing me to mark the mail as not junk.\nHow do I get Mail to allow me to mark the mail as not junk.\nThese emails are put in the junk folder by me.com/iCloud so I would hope Apple would allow control via their apps.\n\nA: It seems iCloud is marking the message as junk using its algorithm. I don't believe you can adjust this from within the Mail.app. You will need to log into iCloud.com, enter Mail, find the particular message in your Junk Mail folder and then with the message selected, select the gear menu and you should be able to Mark as Not Junk.\nTo recap, as iCloud is flagging message as junk you must unflag message within iCloud.\n\nA: There isn't a tie between the server filtering of junk mail and the Mail client on the mac.\nIf this is troublesome, most people pick to disable the server side filtering and train the Mail client on their mac so that it can do all the marking and filing so you don't have this cognitive dissonance between a message that your local mail client \"thinks is junk\" and mail that sits in a folder that coincidentally is named junk.\n\nA: I found this question while search for the same problem. My email provider was Gmail, but the iCloud idea tipped me off. \nIf there is no brown banner on the email, Apple Mail did not mark it as junk/spam, your email provider did. \nIn my case, it was a company email managed by Google Apps. So I logged into Gmail, went to the junk folder, and clicked the 'Not Spam' button on the emails. I did it for a few to train Gmail. \n\nA: all you need to do in Mail toolbar is click on the thumbs up icon to the right of the trash bin.\n", "Q: What should I look for when buying a used Macbook Pro? I had been a Windows guy for a decade and I am planning to buy a used Macbook Pro (2009 model).  What should I look for and check when buying a used Macbook Pro?\n\nA: Beyond visual inspection, you should be able to run Apple Hardware Test in order to check the system hardware's working condition.\n\nA: Besides the hardware test, it's very important to know the health of the battery! Although the results aren't 100% accurate, coconutBattery gives you a fairly good result about how many cycles the battery has had.\nIf the number is over 300, you can almost be sure the battery capacity is lower than 80%.\nBut you should ask the guy you're buying from how long the battery lasts and if you don't trust him, try it yourself.\nA more obvious question is if the Mac is still under warranty. Since it's a 2009 notebook it's very unlikely, but maybe it has Apple Care... You never know.\nAnd the last thing I would check, besides the things already mentioned by AJ., is the optical drive. Does it read/write CD/DVD's at an acceptable speed.\n\nA: Look for future OS X support\nApple is well known for dropping support for older hardware as time goes on. The pending Mountain Lion Release is a perfect case in point.\nHere is an extract from the linked page:\nMacs that will support OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion\nAs usual, the newer the Mac the better:\nMacBook Pro – 13″ from mid 2009 or later, 15″ from late 2007 and newer, 17″ from late 2007 and newer\nMacBook Air – late 2008 and newer\niMac – models from mid 2007 and newer\nMacBook – 13″ aluminum from 2008, 13″ from 2009 and newer\nMac Mini – early 2009 and newer\nMac Pro – early 2008 models and newer\nXServe – early 2009 models and newer\n\nMacs that are NOT expected to support OS X Mountain Lion\nOlder Macs and those with weaker GPU’s will likely be left behind:\nAnything with an Intel GMA 950 or x3100 integrated graphics card\nAnything with an ATI Radeon X1600\nMacBook models released prior to 2008\nMac Mini released prior to 2007\niMac models released prior to 2007\nOriginal MacBook Air\n\n\nEDIT\nBTW, Superduper fast Thunderbolt is Apple's I/O future. Support for this started with the Early 2011 MacBook Pro.  As of this writing there are very, very few devices for it out there.\n", "Q: Anyone know of a Finder replacement? I am starting to dislike the Finder. Does anybody know of a good Finder replacement, something Unixy or Nexty which will still work with all Mac OS X applications?\n\nA: Terminal might sound like a cop-out, but it's as Unix-y as it gets, loaded with Command Line Goodness. To better integrate into the Mac experience, be sure to check out the open command, which can launch applications, or open files using their designated application.\n\n\nA: I'm a big fan of ForkLift (free trial, $30). It isn't cheap, but it's well worth it.\nIt's basically a souped-up version of Finder for power users.\nI recommend that you try out the beta of version 2.5; it's stable and has some features that the stable version is missing.\nA few of my favorite features\n\n\n*\n\n*Dual-paned windows\n\n*Tabs\n\n*Store commonly used 'workspaces'\n\n*Save and mount remote connections\n\n*Work with archives without unpacking them\n\n\nOne especially Unix-y feature is the ability to create 'tools', which are shell scripts to run on selected files.\n\n\nA: As @DanielL said, Terminal can be a great solution, however I wouldn't use the default Apple terminal for this, I would run TermKit since it has a nice graphical interface despite its terminal-ness. Using terminal commands and typing in the name of each file loses the 'finding' aspect of the Finder, where emphasis is placed less on exactly where the file is, especially on Mac OS Lion. While tab-completion partially fixes this, it still has a lot to catch up on.\n\n\nA: I use both TotalFinder and PathFinder.\nFor general Finder-type things, I find TotalFinder very similar to the Finder with the major benefit of Tabs (yeah!) and Dual Mode, where you get two Finder windows side-by-side. This is great for moving files between folders.\nPathFinder has many more advanced features:\nYou have 4 panes (2 on each side of the PathFinder window) that you can customize. I have mine to show:\n1) Processes - showing all open apps\n2) Selection Path - showing the full path to the selected file/folder\n3) Recent Documents\n4) Recent Folders\nBelow your PathFinder window you can set up various options, too. I have mine to show:\n1) Info - similar to Get Info for the selected item\n2) Preview - which is, well, a preview of the selected item\nI have barely touched the full features of PathFinder. Check out:\nhttp://www.cocoatech.com/docs/pf/start\nfor more details about AppleScript and developing for PathFinder.\nBottom line: If you want a simple enhancement to the Finder, I would suggest TotalFinder. If you are a scripter or programmer, I would go with PathFinder.\n\nA: You may find this post interesting:\n5 Alternatives to the OS X Finder (It includes descriptions with some pictures)\nSumarizing the post:\n\n1-Xfolders\n  2-mucommander 3-Disk\n  Order\n  4-FileBrowse 5-Path\n  Finder\n\n\nA: Perhaps not what you had in mind, but for something \"terminal like,\" I use Alfred, which is (IMHO) the best-of-class in application launchers. The basic version is free, but I liked it so well I sent them $45 or so for their deluxe enhanced version family site license plus lifetime free updates. There are other price-points, as well.\nIn practice, you hit a hot key and start typing the name of an application, document, script, website, email, whatever, and it presents you with a list of ten things it thinks are close matches. You then pick one using mouse or hot keys. It then \"learns\" your abbreviation, and moves your choice to the top of the list next time.\nIt does lots of other stuff, as well, such as keystroke folder navigation.\nI loathe crawling around the Finder for stuff, and don't even like using the Dock. With Alfred, I drive about 50% by keyboard.\n\nA: When it comes to alternatives of Finder, there are two major alternatives.  \nFirst, you have TotalFinder. It looks a lot like the normal Finder, but it can do so much more. You can copy/paste across windows, you can work with tabs or dual screen,... It's my personal favorite. I've been using it for many months now.\nThe second alternative is PathFinder. I don't have any personal experience with this software, but when I take a look at their website, it has some cool features too.\nSo, my advice is to check those two options and I can suggest you TotalFinder!\n\nA: For NeXTy try RBrowswer It is really a ftp client but the file browsing works like NeXT's file manager including shelves\n\nA: That the question! We use the Finder to organize and retrieve our files. What means \"Finder replacement\", something like TotalFinder, PathFinder, …, or a really new way to manage our files? I mean, a new concept able to replace the Finder main function : managing our information.\nIf that is the question, if you AskDifferent, the following may interest you. I must be honest, I am also the developer of this new concept. But if you know any app that looks like mine, let me know.\nThe Finder use the Space to organize our files. The Space is divided into subspaces, or folders. As an alternative, or in addition to the Space organization, this new concept use the Time to organize our information, as we do with our brains. All day I record with my 5 senses lots of information. Will I have archive them in folders? No, I simply move the TimeCursor of may consciousness to remember. Like us, this new concept uses a temporal navigation rather than the spatial navigation (like the Finder) to retrieve information.\nHere is a presentation of the new concept.\n", "Q: Menu bar icons get hidden by long menu bar items Sometimes on my Macbook Pro when I have a lot of icons in the menu bar, if I start an application which has a lot of menu items, some of these icons get automatically obscured by the menu items.\nFor example, when running iTunes, the Twitter icon gets obscured...\n\n...but if I switch to Finder (which has a fewer menu items) the icon then re-appears\n\nIs there any way I can show or get to these obscured icons without having to switch to an application with a shorter menu bar?\n\nA: I have been using this for a while and it seems to be configurable to do what you need.\nhttp://www.macbartender.com\n\n\nA: When holding the command-key you can drag the menu bar items around and change their order. That just helped me when I switched to an app where I could see the required menu bar item and then I moved it far to the right so that I could then see it also in the other app.\n\nA: BetterTouchTool has an action that hides all menu items.\nYou can assign arbitrary keyboard shortcuts or mouse / touchpad gestures.\n\nBetterTouchTool is commercial software (pay what you want – $3.99 minimum). During the 45 day trial phase you can use all features of BTT.\n\nA: An app called AccessMenuBarApps allows you to do that by basically providing a keyboard shortcut to an application with no application menu items. It's free, so it wouldn't hurt to give it a try.\n\nA: NoMenuBar is a free app whose only purpose is to have no menus other than it's name so that you can switch to it and see more menu bar icons.  \nThis isn't a direct solution to the question (not have to switch to another app), but it did help me see more icons that even Finder's menus were obscuring.\n", "Q: What software is available to customize the functionality of the Apple Remote? I am looking to change the functionality of the buttons on the Apple Remote. What software is available to do this? \n\nA: The free BetterTouchTool can do this:\n\nYou can set up complex actions to be triggered by any of the buttons being either pressed or held.\n\nA: Mira can customize the Apple Remote buttons on a per-app basis, and costs $16.\nRemote Buddy allows you to customize the Apple Remote and many other devices, however it does cost more than Mira.\nBetter Touch Tool also allows you to customize the actions of an Apple Remote, as well as trackpad/mouse, but there seems to be issues with the default action still firing with BetterTouchTool (see this question). It is free though.\n", "Q: Is this possible? Prevent Live-Linux from booting and grabbing your files without encrypting your disc? I am a medium-experienced Power User with knowledge about most of the stuff (studying this since two years) and I know something about how Linux and Windows work; I have screwed up countless installations and stuff like that (dont want to bore you, just want to tell, that I know what I am talking about).\nTo the point:\nA friend of mine has a MacBook, running OS X Lion and a hard drive with about 320 GB (not encrypted, at least not the part that is important) and he tells me that forcing a change of his password would automatically activate a self-destruction (complete wipe of the drive). This could be true and would be no prevention, since I don't want to change the password, I just want to get the files from his drive. So I can simply boot Linux from CD/USB and mount his drive, copy everything unencrypted, and done.\nThat's what I told him, his answer: \"Well, that could work, but my Mac will automatically detect this and wipe the drive before anything gets copied.\" The main question: Is this bullshit?\nFrom what i would expect, this would work like:\nBIOS --> Linux --> Mount Disc --> Copy --> Start OS X --> Detect and wipe\nSo files should be there without the wipe, but he said it won't work, and OS X would be booted before Linux? I was really surprised, so I want to ask you guys.\nHe told me that he will give me his MacBook and I can try to get his files, but I don't want his disc to be wiped, so I ask here: is it safe to try it out?\n\nA: Your friend has no idea what he's talking about. You don't even need to use a Linux disc - you can use single user mode or a Mac OS X install disc to copy things or make changes to the filesystem.\nTo prevent someone from booting into single user mode or from an unauthorized disc or external drive, your friend can set a firmware password. However, this, too, is easily bypassed if you can open the computer and remove the drive, or alter the memory configuration. Simply put, if someone has physical access to a computer, encryption is the only way to protect your data.\n", "Q: Has coreaudiod been fixed in Lion yet? I tried Lion a few months ago, but had to revert to 10.6 because of the \"coreaudiod bug\" – where audio via QuickTime would stop working every few minutes, requiring a killall coreaudiod each time. Since I'm a video editor, this would interfere with Final Cut and After Effects, making Lion unusable.\nDoes anyone know if this issue has been fixed yet in Lion?\n\nA: Nope it hasn't. I'm still having problems in Logic because of it. I plug in a headphone cable, unplug it, and suddenly the computer doesn't have sound. Try killall /usr/sbin/coreaudiod then relaunch it, I get this:\n[...] Error: FIXME: IOUnserialize has detected a string that is not valid UTF-8, \"?-8?????-8????PDa????@Da????0??????Ԕ?????<????????c\".\nAug 14 01:56:48 Benjamins-MacBook-Pro.local coreaudiod[7392] Error: FIXME: IOUnserialize has detected a string that is not valid UTF-8, \"?-8?????-8????PDa????@Da????0??????Ԕ?????????????c\".\nAug 14 01:56:48 Benjamins-MacBook-Pro.local coreaudiod[7392] Error: FIXME: IOUnserialize has detected a string that is not valid UTF-8, \"??c\".\nAug 14 01:56:48 Benjamins-MacBook-Pro.local coreaudiod[7392] Error: FIXME: IOUnserialize has detected a string that is not valid UTF-8, \"??c\".\n2012-08-14 01:56:48.994 coreaudiod[7392:707] Exiting due to uncaught exception in main\n\nApparently I've got some low level bug in my operating system or coreaudiod just wasn't compiled right.\n\nA: Does the headphone connect via USB or line-out jack? If USB, it may be that the USB I/O driver for your headphone is causing the problem. Many I/O drivers for core audio (and all hardware devices) run within the kernel.  A bug in the driver can cause problems with the driver manager code (coreaudiod, in this case) or even potentially the entire kernel.\nIs it only with one specific headphone and/or one specific USB type output device?  If its USB (and not line-out), try a different USB connector type (different brand) to see if the same problem arises.  If its line-out, I have no idea what the problem might be.\n\nA: Nope.  Actually I have consistently had problems with coreaudiod spawning ports and generally causing the system to hang since 10.6.0\n", "Q: Which model of Macintosh has the longest battery life? I was exclusively a PC man (specifically Dell, Gateway, and HP), but I am now planning to buy a Mac, because my sister has a Mac, with a battery life (much) longer than mine, and I would like to benefit from that. Could anyone suggest the best Mac to buy if I want the longest battery life possible. I mean really the longest, even if it sacrifices other things to achieve it.\n\nA: According to Apple's website, the 13\" MacBook Air and all of the MacBook Pros have 7 hours of battery life. This means that there are seven laptops for you to choose from: Four 13\" computers, two 15\", and one 17\". The possibility of getting more than 7 hours exists, because this number is determined in this manner:\n\nThe wireless web test measures battery life by wirelessly browsing 25 popular websites with display brightness set to 50%.\n\n—Apple (at the very bottom of the page, point number 2).\n\nA: My experience is the entry level 13\" MacBook Air is quite miserly, but no where near the battery runtime of the enormous 17 inch MacBook Pro. Even with a high end GPU and CPU - it has so much power it's the winner for all day performance according to people I know that have them.\nThe current 15 inch MacBook Pro are a bit more power hungry than the ones of the mid 2009 vintage - so if you can wait, many are speculating whatever new Ivy Bridge based MacBook Pro eventually gets released will likely be less hot (and get better battery life) than the current CPU/GPU lineup. If you can't wait and need, need, need all day battery life - I'd pick up a used Mid 2009 or early 2010 model and just watch the CPU to make sure you quit programs that will reduce it from 10 hour life down to 5 to 7 life at a more active CPU load. The nice thing about the older mac is you can pin the GPU to the integrated one and know it will be miserly with the power.\n\nNow if I don't take your question literally, but wholistically - you should get a $399 iPad and the $999 MacBook Air. Together, they are a potent combination for Netflix and productivity - I could see you getting 10 hours of netflix and 5 hours of laptop life in \"one charge\"  \n\nA: It depends on what you mean by \"battery life\".  Charge capacity will decrease over the usable life of the battery, so if you mean \"max charge capacity\", @Mahnax gives you this information above.\nIf you mean longest usable life, this is largely dependent on usage patterns.  Different factors play into usable life, as this article points out:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3008527?start=0&tstart=0\nThe key point of this article is that you should use (read: disconnect from AC power) your battery a little bit every day to get the most usable life out of it.\n", "Q: Quicktime Screen Recording doesn't work in Lion When starting a new Screen Recording in Quicktime Player in Lion 10.7.3, as soon as I click record I get this following error message:\n\nHere's a video demonstrating the issue: http://db.tt/CROyXgIt\nHere are the settings under the triangle on the right:\n\n\nA: Finally figured it out - apparently the Movies folder in my home directory had a weird permission set on it and things couldn't be written to it, which caused QuickTime to give a very descriptive message \"The operation could not be completed\" and saving to a different folder (or after fixing the permissions on Movies), worked.\n\nA: Simply restarting my mac worked for me.\n\nA: FWIW, I ran into this issue today and the problem was with the external monitor.

Else, what alternative? I'm a little impatient.  When I watch recorded technology conference sessions, I like to speed a video up during parts I can grok quickly, and slow it down to normal when knowledge isn't sinking in fast.\nUntil recently, I've been using the excellent VLC media player to do this on Windows.  VLC on Windows has commands to speed up and slow down in fine increments.  Witness:\n\nThe Faster (fine) permits speed-stepping from 1.00x to 1.10x, 1.20x, 1.30x, etc.  Contrast that to \"Faster\", which jumps directly to 1.50x.  Whoah, too fast!  (Well, I'll grant that 1.50x is sometimes useful: for keynote sessions where there's more fluff :-)\nAnyway, I thought in moving to OS X that replacing VLC would be easy: Just get VLC for OS X. But, I discovered recently that VLC for OS X is missing the \"(fine)\" versions of the speed-stepping. There's only the too-fast one that jumps to 1.50x.  Witness:\n\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to restore the \"(fine)\" versions of the commands to the Playback menu on VLC for OS X, or otherwise access them through some secret key-binding magick?  i.e. Are they hidden and I just can't access them? Or, does the OS X version of VLC completely lack these fine-grained controls?\n\n*Failing #1, what alternative & free video player for OS X offers such fine-grained speed-stepping controls?\nThank you.\n\nA: I just downloaded VLC 2.0.1, and in the Playback menu, it has a slider that allows for finer control (note when pressing command + =, popup text says playback speed 1.5x, but in that slider it shows 10x, which means that 2x, 3x, etc. in that slider would allow for finer control)\n\n\nA: One of my favorite media players for Mac is Movist – I think it's much better, smoother, and faster than VLC.\nUsing the ShiftApple← and ShiftApple→ keys you can adjust playback speeds in 0.1x increments: 1x, 1.1x, 1.2x, etc.\nAnd ShiftApple\\ to instantly go back to 1x.\n\nNote: the link above is for the open-source version, 0.6.8, which works great. There is a newer version 1.1.4 for $5 on the App Store as well.\n\nA: Yes, VLC for OS X provides this level of control.\nIf you go into VLC » Preferences [aka. ⌘+,] » Hotkeys you'll find that you can associate hotkeys for both actions – Faster (Fine) and Slower (Fine) – and more: \n\nYou can find plenty of options here: \n\n\n*\n\n*set them up the way you were used to using them on Windows, \n\n*set a hotkey for resetting playback speed back to normal etc.\n\n\nNote: If your newly assigned hotkeys don't seem to be taken into account, you might need to quit VLC and start it again.\n\nA: You can manually set the playback speed by going to VLC preferences, clicking \"Show All\" at the bottom left, then under input and codecs, change the value until you have the desirable playback speed.\n\n\nA: I'm not sure if it's the same with Apple, but you can customize your toolbar easily if you access Tools.\nTools >>> Customize Interface >>> (move the buttons you want onto the toolbar and arrange the playback functions and stop buttons to your preference)\nhttp://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=99560\n", "Q: Is it possible to configure OS X  to use the domain-name supplied by DHCP option 15?

One of my favorite parts of Windows is the ability to selectively turn features on or off. For instance, on a tablet you can turn on Tablet PC components; on a desktop you can disable these and potentially enable other features as well.\nIt provides you with a list of checkboxes that lets you choose which programs and features  you want to disable or enable.\nSo: Is there any Mac equivalent of Windows' Turn Windows Features On or Off?\nEDIT:\nI'm looking for a central place to see a list of checkboxes that display a large amount of features that I can turn on or off.\n\nA: The Mac OS doesn't directly have a feature like this, mainly due to how the OS and supporting Applications are separated differently than Windows. \nLooking a while back, Microsoft was having some issues with anti-trust lawsuits, and the inability to really separate IE from Windows. From how I understood it, part of this feature (at least the user facing side, not the server side) was enabled to help users 'Turn off IE'. \nThis grew on Windows two ways - one to let users 'remove' features that they didn't want to use, and two - to enable and disable server or other components. \nFollowing the first of the above - this is much easier on the Mac - just drag the Application to the trash. Don't want to have iPhoto on your machine, just delete it. You can always reinstall it later from the media or Mac App Store. While certain API's do tie into different Applications (think media browsers in Pages, etc), the OS doesn't have to always have these applications to run. And to my understanding (although I have never tried it), you could theoretically remove iTunes or Safari if you wanted (although, WebKit is still being used, and may require Safari). \nAs for the second item above - server or other features - this is also much different on the Mac. For the actual server functions (outside of the Unix tools), you now just buy an app from the Mac App Store (you used to buy a different version of the Mac OS that was much more expensive). On Mac OS client, there is no direct way to fully remove a feature, say apache, without deleting the binaries, etc. from the actual UNIX paths. So, in this case, there really is not a direct correlation on the Mac OS. \nWhen it does come to certain 'server-like' features in the Mac OS (for example setting up file shares, ssh, etc), these are under System Preferences -> Sharing. \n\nFinally, the Mac OS tries to be a bit smarter about this too. Take for example your 'tablet features' for Windows. If the Mac actually supported a tablet in that case, they would show you an item in System Preferences. A great example like this is mice/trackpads. Depending on what is actually connected to your machine, you see (if you have a Mac without a trackpad, you don't see the trackpad option - or at least it used to - my air is showing the options for a mouse right now).\nTo turn off specific features (say Time Machine, etc), you still have to go to each items 'control panel' if you will under System Preferences, versus one place to turn them all off. There may be tools like Onyx that let you have a bit more control over things (a review here), but this isn't really built into the OS in one place. \n\nA: System Preferences. This can be accessed via the \"Apple menu\" in the top left corner of the screen.\n\nOnce opened, the \"preference panes,\" as they are called, are arranged by type of category. If you're looking for a specific preference, you can also use the search box in the top right corner of the window.\n\n", "Q: Where can I download the versions of Safari that are newer than what Apple ships? I'm a web developer that makes webapps that work in all modern browsers. Amazingly enough, I use 100% valid HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Occasionally, I have to release interesting fixes, to say the least, because my webapps don't work in the latest versions for some reason.\nThus, I have the latest versions of all browsers as well as the betas. Firefox Aurora, Chrome Canary, IE10, and Opera Next 12.\nI have but one missing: Safari. Of course I have the normal version of Safari, but can I get ahead of the curve before the launch of the next Safari update by Apple?\nI'm looking for either the Mac or the Windows versions - both if possible.\n\nA: Safari is Apple’s build of WebKit. Nightly WebKit builds are available at nightly.webkit.org.\n\nA: If you are registered as a Safari Developer (which is free for anyone), you sometimes get access to beta builds of Safari. For example, developers currently get access to a beta of Safari 5.2, the version shipping with Mountain Lion. Think of this as the beta channel of Chrome - where its much more stable and almost OK for daily use. I am not sure if the beta is available for Windows right now, but they usually do offer a beta build closer to release time (this is also usually too when its no longer a private beta, but a public use beta). The difference in these beta builds are usually more user-oriented new features, etc. \nSafari (and Chrome, and a few other browsers) are built on WebKit, and you can download nightly development builds on their site. Think of this as the Chrome Dev channel, or moreso Canary with nightly new features (and bugs). The focus of this version is nightly bug fixes or new features.\n", "Q: Cannot repair permissions on systemsetup (open error 1) I've been noticing some issues with my Mac lately and decided to repair permissions (with Disk Utility).

I'm trying to swipe a couple photostream pictures onto a borrowed windows laptop, but I can't find any way to do that via the web.\nCan I access my photostream in any way other than iTunes? I'd rather not install it on someone else's PC.\n\nA: On a Windows system you can access Photo Stream by installing iCloud Control Panel for Windows.\nBased on the description it allows you to access all the features within iCloud. Though this is only supported in Vista and Windows 7.\n\nThe iCloud Control Panel is required to use Photo Stream, Mail,\n  Contacts and Calendars (Microsoft Outlook 2007 or later required) and\n  Bookmarks (Safari 5.1.1 or Internet Explorer 8 or later required).\n\n\nA: The most native way to access your Photostream is indeed installing the iCloud Control Panel, just like Justwes told you to do.\nIf you are looking for some web-based solution, you should try the freshly updated Dropbox app. It has a feature called Photo Upload, which will enable you to automatically upload (all) your photos from your iPhone to Dropbox.

How do I find out how much disk space a program such as Skype occupies?\nMy SSD is getting full, and I want to see what can be deleted.\n\nA: Daisy Disk\nIt's a killer app for analyzing disk use on a Mac. It'll scan all your drives and shows you disk use broken down by customizable buckets: file types, programs, tags, etc. It can show you all the disk space used by a program like Skype if you like and more.\n\nEdit: it's also on sale right now for $10.\n\nA: If you want to find out how much space an Application and it's associated files are taking up (not just the .app bundle), AppCleaner works great for that. As you can see in this screenshot for Chrome, it shows the application itself, as well as preferences, caches, etc. all nicely totaled up.\n\n\nA: Disk Inventory maps out your disk usage graphically.  Easiest way.\n\n\nA: Grand Perspective is an open-source application that is free. Similarly to Disk Inventory, it uses a tree map for visualization of the file system. The bigger a block, the bigger the file.\n\nA: Alternatively, if you want to use the command line and (looking at the 2nd part of your question) you're just interested in which files are taking up the most space, I often use the find command. \nfind ~ -size +50M\nwill find all files within your home directory (~) greater than 50MB.\nYou can modify the size descriptor after the number like so (see man find)\nk       kilobytes (1024 bytes)\nM       megabytes (1024 kilobytes)\nG       gigabytes (1024 megabytes)\nT       terabytes (1024 gigabytes)\nP       petabytes (1024 terabytes)\n\n\nA: I am using OmniDiskSweeper. It shows you a nice overview of your used diskspaced and which directory is taking how much space.\nIt can also erases the data.\n\n\nA: I hate to spoil the party, but I understand the idea is that the disk is getting too full?  so why installing an extra application when a simple 'get info' would do the trick?\nFor Skype:\n\nfollowed by:\n\nwill tell you how big an App is without need for extra space taking software.\nIn addition, a second alternative is to use the Terminal typing:\ndu -sh /Applications/Skype.app/\n  53M   /Applications/Skype.app/\n\nThe differences in size between what the Finder gives and what du gives are due to the fact they calculate size in base 10 (the Finder) and in base 2 (du).  See also this link on the matter:\ndu -sh vs Finder file size\n\nA: Late answer but I have never regretted buying an app called \"What Size\" for my IMAC... its great for finding out whats taking up so much space... and you view everything all at once, not piece by piece. Very user friendly, no reading required, best $10 bucks I spent. Maybe I would have tried the free ones first though if I had known about them, but I'm still very happy with \"What Size\"\n\nA: If you're looking to clear up space, Skype logs and the occasional text file will no effect.\nIf you want to make a substantial cut on space without making your mac bulimic, I suggest Monolingual (free and open source), which deletes unused language support (which is usually around 500 MB to 2 GB) and redundant app binaries.\nMost Mac apps are \"universal,\" meaning they support both Intel and (the older) PowerPC processor architectures, by having every application contain a binary compiled for each. If you're running an Intel Mac, monolingual can be used to delete the unused app binaries, saving 1-2 GB\n", "Q: Have battery status only show in menu bar when running on battery power I use my MacBook Pro plugged in to power and an external monitor 90% of the time, and thus the little charged battery indicator in the menubar is useless. However when I'm not on wall power, is there a way to have it show up? When I have that menu item disabled, my MacBook doesn't give me any low battery warnings, and just shuts down (it's happened several times).\n\nA: I use SlimBatteryMonitor (free, donations accepted, not nagware) instead of the default menu item for the battery status. \nSBM can be configured to almost disappear from the menu bar when fully charged.\nIf that isn't enough for you, you could run a launchd script every few minutes to check the status of the battery, to see whether or not it is fully charged, and act accordingly:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the battery is fully charged, quit SlimBatteryMonitor (if it is running)\n\n*If the battery is NOT fully charged, run SlimBatteryMonitor (if it isn't already running) \nI am actually doing something like this already.

This information is critical if you need to reconstruct the 3D path accurately.

The above procedure will work for all applications supplied by Apple as part of the OS.\n", "Q: How to switch to a tab in mobile Safari without it reloading? Many times when I'm on Safari on my iPhone and I choose to switch to a new tab, instead of just displaying its contents, it reloads the entire tab. Is there any way to switch to the tab and prevent it from reloading the tab?\nI tried turning off all network connections, but it still attempts to load the tab, fails, and shows a blank page.\n\nA: The bottleneck is the available free memory (RAM) on the iPhone.\nIf Safari starts running out of memory it will flush the contents of older tabs meaning they have to reload when you switch back to them.\nIf you have too many tabs open, or you simply have multiple tabs that each have a large web page in them, Safari will reload when you switch back to another tab. There’s no fixed limit; it depends on the combined size of the HTML + all assets each web page you have open and on the total number of tabs you have open.\nAs the available RAM in new iPhone models increases, this will become less and less of a problem.\n", "Q: How do I truly flush Safari's cache? There have been countless times where I run into a problem after I edit HTML on a Mac. The issue derives from me uploading the updated file to my server through FTP, and I'll navigate to the website in Safari. The one thing that didn't  act properly was that Safari had already cached the webpage (the old version), so it would display the old version. I thought to myself and decided to clear the cache in Safari hoping it would solve my issue. Clearing the cache merely let the website appear to reload. It still came up with the old version of the file. To prove that the file on the server was actually updated, I got on another Mac on the same network, and it displayed the new version of the file. No matter how many times I refreshed or cleared the cache or reopened Safari, it would always deliver the old file. The only other solution I could come up with was to reboot. After a reboot, Safari reloaded the entire website and displayed the new version of the file.\nI'm really just wondering how to flush Safari's cache and have it behave properly. Is this something the operating system does (I've had similar problems with files on my harddrive, too)? I don't want to have to reboot all the time just to see a new version of a file, so is there any way I can ensure I'm viewing the newest one? Is there a temporary storage folder that I can manually clear out? This happens to me quite often (not terribly frequent, but enough for me to notice), and my only current solution is to reboot.\nI have strange feeling (it's not really a thought, but an ever so slight possiblilty that doesn't make much sense) that it's originating from a lower level.\n\nA: When Safari doesn't clear cache:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure that you have logged out of all webpages, and have closed all the Safari tabs.\n\n*Open Finder and select Go → Go To Folder... in Menu bar. (Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut, Command + Shift + g.)\n\n*Copy and paste the following into dropdown: \n~/Library/Safari/Databases\n\n*Delete all the contents that appear in that folder by highlighting all folders and right clicking and selecting Move to Trash.\n\n*Open Safari again and check that all item are now deleted.\n\n*If nothing appears when you search for the above criteria, please search \n~/Library/Safari/Local Storage\nand follow steps 4 & 5 above to delete all the contents.\n\nA: In Safari, hold down down the ⇧ (Shift) key while clicking the refresh button. This will perform a “hard” refresh, which bypasses the local cache.\n(To quickly clear the cache in Safari, hit ⌥+⌘+E, go to Privacy, and click “Remove All Website Data”.)\n\nA: I had the exact same problem except I noticed that it was happening with other browsers too. As it turns out it was not Safari or OSX it was a cache created by the service provider.\nTo solve the problem I put code in my page to prevent it from being cached.\ncontent=\"no-cache\"\n\"Some people know about the browser caching, but still get taken aback by ISP caching. ISP caching works in much the same way as browser caching. Once you have visited a website your ISP may cache those pages so that they appear to load faster the next time you visit them. The main problem with this is that unlike your browser cache you can not delete these temporary files, instead you have to wait until your ISPs cache expires and it requests fresh copies of the files. This can be very frustrating if you are trying to develop or make changes to your website -- or even to look at new information.\"\n", "Q: Locking an iPhone if button is broken?

This works, I tested it myself.\n\nA: If you go to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings\n\n*General\n\n*Accessibility \n\n*Assistive Touch\n\n\nIt provides a transparent circle icon in which you can do many things, such as locking the screen, snapshots, home button, and much more! It worked great for me (my lock button broke as well). \n\nA: if your phone is jailbroken, you can download and install activator which allows you to change any other buttons to the lock button. You can also set pressing the home button twice to lock or other finger gestures to lock too. Mine got jammed and I used the volume up button to lock because the assistive button is really painful to use I have to click 3-4 times before locking my phone. \n\nA: It appears that if you go into Settings > General > Accessibility and enable Assistive Touch, a new transparent button appears on your iPhone. This button can be accessed all the time. It is overlayed over anything appearing on your phone. If you tap it, and then tap Device, one of the options is Lock Screen.\nInstead of having the icon always be visible, you can go to the Triple-click Home setting under the Accessibility page and choose AssistiveTouch. This way you can easily show or hide the button with a triple-click of the home button!\n", "Q: old iPod touch 1.1.4 youtube app hasn't worked since Sept 2011 or so I've been happy with my jailbroken iPod touch and didn't want to upgrade beyond 1.1.4. However, since late last year, perhaps September, the YouTube application hasn't worked, giving the uninformative error \"Cannot connect to YouTube\". Likewise I cannot reach Google using SSL, only straight HTTP. The error with https://google.com/ first successfully redirects to https://www.google.com/m, but then gives this error:\n\n\"Error 502 (Server Error)!!1\" \n\n(sic) with the colored Google logo and \n\n\"502. That's an error. The server encountered a temporary error and could not complete your request. Please try again in 30 seconds. That's all we know\".\n\nBut it is not temporary, and I believe the two problems are related. I've edited the Cookies.plist file and cut out the google.com and youtube.com cookies, no help. I'm wondering if it has something to do with root certs, but don't know the plist for those. Any ideas?\n\nA: Actually I suspect your problem started when the YouTube API 1.0 was dropped by google.\nGoogle notified developers that the YouTube API was deprecated in 2008. Since they keep deprecated APIs running for 3 years, 2011 would be the time they turned the switch on it. It would make sense if all apps and webpages relying on the YouTube API v1.0 failed when they shut it down. They had a lot of problems with YouTube in september 2011 (example with 502 errors). So it's reasonable to say that your iPod will never be able to connect to YouTube if you keep using the early 2008 iPhone OS 1.1.4.\nGoogle released the YouTube Data API (v2.0) around march 2008, after the iOS 1.1.4 was released.\nI fear the only solution to get your 1.1.4 device to play YouTube properly would be to get Google to turn the old API back on... Or simply update your iPod :(\n", "Q: Can all Mac executables be copied between machines? Many programs for OS X simply ask to drop the executable into the Applications directory. This obviously means that copying the executable onto another machine is possible without problems.\nWhat about applications that go through an installer (for example iWork) - do these do something extra? Can I simply copy the Pages executable onto another machine and have it run?\n\nA: No\nIf the application requires an installer, it needs to be installed on each machine. This includes pre-MAS (Mac App Store) iWorks and Microsoft Office 2011 for example. \nOnly applications that were not downloaded from the MAS and explicitly specify installation by copying the executable can be copied between machines.\nApplications purchased through MAS can be copied between machines as long as the user logging into MAS on the target machine is the same user that originally purchased the application.\n", "Q: Mac mini and VNC remote performance I'm looking to get a Mac for iOS development, and with about $700 to work with, a Mac mini with upgraded RAM seems like the way to go. My problem is I never work strictly in one place (i.e. the office). I'm always at different locations, be it at home, with clients, or simply sitting outside at a coffee house. I always bring my laptop along and have looked into using VNC to access the mini remotely. However, I've read snippets of other users experiencing less-than-stellar speeds/performance when using VNC.\niOS programming (i.e. Xcode) is the only tool I'd be using during remote connections - no surfing, downloading, game-playing, nothing graphics-intensive. The image of me typing a line of code and having Xcode lag two to three characters behind doesn't sit well as I really despise any type of lag. (I know. I'm picky.)\nSo, I'm wondering:\nWould VNC allow me to feel as though I'm interacting with the mini itself and offer (at least almost) instantaneous feedback? Is there a better option out there with my budget?\nAny help is greatly appreciated, and apologies for the length; just wanted to be thorough. \nP.S. - If there's a way to simply plug the mini into my laptop and use its monitor, that would be better, though I haven't found that that's possible.\n\nA: Our development team all use Macs. I have personally tried to use VNC both with Apples built in and premium Apple Remote Desktop ($79.99), as well as Jolly's Fast VNC. I had a Mac Pro tower at work and really needed the remote capability, and was able to work reasonably well with Apple Remote Desktop, but when my tower came off lease I went with a Laptop, because the lag and poor display quality were just too annoying. I found that I needed to degrade the display quality in order to keep the performance reasonable, which meant a blurry display.   Overall I found it frustrating and avoid remote access, but it does work, although I would strongly recommend buying Apple Remote Desktop to get the full screen capability. Jolly's was fast but at the time had some bugs that resulted in a corrupt screen sometimes. That was over a year ago, the new version may be better.\nThere are other developers I work with who think that the VNC solution works just fine for them, so I think it depends a lot on how fussy you are about responsiveness (I am fussy). \nIf your previous experience with remote access involves Microsoft's Remote Display Protocol (RDP) then you will be very disappointed with VNC. The RDP technology is superior in both display quality and performance. One of the few things I really miss from the Microsoft world. \nIn short, I'd recommend moving to an Apple laptop and then running your Windows virtually. I started with a mini originally, and just ended up moving to a laptop eventually. \n\nA: Just made the same: got cheapest Mac mini, attached it to my Linux laptop and tasting iOS development.\nTwo important things to know: \n\n\n*\n\n*Use ethernet, not wi-fi. Ethernet faster and more stable.\n\n*Give a chance to NoMachine. In my case it just rocks. Not so smooth as LCD attached but very-very-very usefull. Moreover looks sexy on both Linux and MacOS. And what is more significant allow to resize mac's screen to your's.\n\n\nA: VNC performance depends a lot on characteristics of the network that you use (channel between your MacMini and notebook) like latency and ping but, if your mac mini will be near you all the time (and there also will be an AC power socket somewhere:) then  VNC performance would be ideal. You can connect your computers with crossover cable, or wifi.\nIf you want to use it as notebook then why wouldn't you just buy that refurbished  MacBook? What would you do if you will need to work somewhere there is no power socket  (like a park)?\n\nA: I've spent a lot of time looking at solutions to this, buying a MacBook Pro etc. \nIf you're planning on using VNC from a Windows machine to a Mac running Lion, forget it. The VNC support is worse now than with Snow Leopard. I tend to use LogMeIn, which is a bit slow at times, but the internet connection where I have my Mac mini isn't great.\nMy problem is that I prefer to have dual screen setup, which I have with my Mac mini.\nWhen I'm on the same LAN, I use splashtop streamer and splashtop remote, which is by far the best. However it only caters for one of my screens. I tend to try and put everything on that screen when I'm working in this way. I use an XP laptop with an external monitor for this.\nIf you got for the two-Mac approach, then there's problems with sharing source code with two machines, you can use dropbox and git. Unless you par for a github account etc.\n\nA: One word of warning, when I use VNC it doesn't seem to pickup the fact that I'm holding down Control when trying to connect things in XCode Storyboard mode.\nI'd consider that a pretty important part of something you'd need to be able to do to use XCode.\nI'd stretch the budget to a MacBook if you can. Don't forget you can sell your Windows laptop and install Windows on the MacBook very easily if that will help with funding.\n\nA: You might also want to consider TeamViewer which seems to have slightly better responsiveness and stability over the various VNC clients for Windows - it's the default remote control solution for my company.  Cross-platform, highly configurable, even iOS apps available.\n(I still think Timbuktu was the fastest I've ever used, though... sigh)\n", "Q: Does the real-world MacBook Pro battery life scale linearly with it's capacity? I have a well-worn battery on my 2010 MacBook Pro. After 467 charge cycles, I get about 3 hours of the normal 6-7 hour range.\nUsing coconutBattery shows me that the charge capacity is 5783 mAh, compared to the original 6900 mAh. Extrapolating the math there would indicate that a replacement battery would only last for an additional half an hour!\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this number a reliable indicator of present and future battery life?\n\n*What kind of realistic usage am I likely to get from a new battery under Lion?\n\n\n(For what it's worth, I've already calibrated the battery with a full drain, checked for rogue background processes, and force-disabled the NVIDIA graphics with gfxCardStatus.)\n\nA: First of all a note, coconutBattery is a tool which helps you indicating a battery problem. It's measurements are not 100% accurate...\nIf you really want to know the health of your battery, I suggest you take a look at System Profiler (Applications < Utilities < Sytem Profiler) and open the 'Power' bar. Here you see information comming directly from Mac OS. It could be the same as coconutBattery, depending on what version you use, but this is the most reliable information about your battery...\nYou have Charge Information and Health Information \n \nAnd to answer your question, I don't think their is a strict correlation between the lifetime of a battery and the number of mAh left (at least none that I found of). There's been a lot of writing about batteries, their lifespan and their health. But it depends on so much external factors, you can't make a decent prediction of it.\nAs your Mac ages, you battery's health will go down. Learn to live with it :) \n\nA: \nDoes the real-world battery life scale linearly with it's capacity?\n\nNo, because it also depends on current draw.  If you have a 10 watt hour battery, and you pull 10 watts from it, you will likely get less than 1 hour of time due to losses inside the battery.  \nIf you instead pull 1 watt from it, you'll get closer to 10 hours of usage, because the losses are not as good at lower current draws.\nAs batteries age the losses become worse.  The internal damage that occurs over time due to the charge/discharge cycle causes additional internal cell resistance.  So a new battery will give you more of its rated capacity (and use less internally during use) than an old battery.  The old battery will give you less of its rated capacity (and consume more internally than the new battery) than a new battery would.\n\nIs this number a reliable indicator of present and future battery life?\n\nIt's an estimate, and now that the battery has higher internal losses it will depend much more greatly on how much power you're drawing.  If you're using the processor and graphics chipset at capacity, then add wireless, bright screen, etc on top of that you probably won't be able to use the entire measured capacity.\nTherefore it's not reliable, as it depends on your actual usage scenario.\nIf, instead, you've got it playing itunes with the lid closed, it will use a larger percentage of that capacity before it indicates depletion.\n\nWhat kind of realistic usage am I likely to get from a new battery under Lion?\n\nUnfortunately you're trying to compare Lion's consumption with your previous OS consumption.  I can't answer that question, and even if I had the same model and recently changed the battery I have a different use case, so my experience wouldn't necessarily apply to use.\nI can tell you that often one battery will degenerate more than the others in multi cell pack, and if discharged under controlled conditions you can get the full capacity of each individual cell, but under heavy discharge the bad cell is a weak link, and the whole battery pack will shut down prior to depleting the other good cells.\nThis means that there are several good reasons to replace your battery, and the most likely outcome is significantly increased battery life.\nHowever there's no way to guarantee that due to your individual circumstances and usage.  The tools you're using are ok, but without removing and testing each cell individually under a few different discharge conditions you can't know fully how the battery will compare to new batteries.  So the tools can't be counted on to give you more than a rough estimate.\nIf I were in your situation, though, I'd expect to get approximately the same life out of a new battery under Lion as I got out of the new battery under the previous OS.  The difference might be slightly greater, but still minimal.  \n\nA: You can determine the battery runtime using Peukert's Law which was originally used for lead-acid batteries, but is also used for other types of batteries. However, this law is mostly accurate for lead-acid batteries.\n\nk is called the Peukert's constant and dimensionless . It's values depend on the type of battery.\nAs you can see in the latter equation, the left over battery runtime is directly proportional to the capacity. Therefore, for twice the battery capacity you get twice the battery life  - if the discharge current is constant. \n", "Q: How does the iPad auto-correct work exactly? When I type in something incorrectly, or if I'm in the middle of typing, the iPad sometimes shows up an auto-correct suggestion. If I click on the suggestion to choose it, it disappears. And then, when I type the word again, the auto-correct  doesn't appear.\nHow do I get the iPad to actually respond to my auto-correct choice? I tried Googling, but it didn't turn up any results.\n\nA: AutoCorrect will automatically replace the word unless you cancel it manually by tapping it. (Note the small × sign in the suggestion bubble indicating that tapping it will cancel the suggestion.)\nSo, as soon as an AutoCorrect suggestion appears that you want to use, just hit Space (or insert a punctuation mark) and continue typing.\n\nA: If you are typing and your iPad suggest you something, you should just continue typing or hit the spacebar and your iPad will correct it automatically. \nIf you take a close look at the suggestions, you'll see a small cross at the right side. Clicking on the suggesting, will make the suggestion disappear since you closed the pop-up. \nAnd once you've closed the popup, it won't be shown in the same word again if you retype the same word.\n\nA: Thanks. I was having trouble figuring that out. I have to agree, the space bar is a bit counterintuitive, especially when you're used to Android. I do wish iOS would give multiple options like Android does.

But if the internal one is on it’s shown in spaces.\nIt is possible to use the MacBook with the internal screen switched off by putting it to sleep and wake it with an external input device while the Book is close. But this way always needs a short sleep and interrupt working. So I wonder if it’s is possible to switch off only the internal screen by software (an app, via Terminal, AppleScript, a keyboard short cut etc.) without switch off the external screen?\nI know that there’s a shortcut for “sleep screen“ but this affects all screens including the external one.\n\nA: To disable the internal screen for OS X Lion based laptops, launch the Terminal and enter the following command:\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"iog=0x0\"\n\nYou’ll need to reboot for changes to take effect, and the internal display will then be completely disabled regardless of whether the Mac is open or closed.\nTo undo this, you can go back to the Terminal and enter:\nsudo nvram -d boot-args\n\nThen reboot again, or you can just zap PRAM by holding down Command+Option+P+R during reboot, which clears out the boot-args as well. If you were to disconnect the MacBook Pro from an external video source, zapping the PRAM would be how you’d want to reenable the internal display.\nThis is the opposite of “clamshell mode” – where the Mac laptop is closed and the screen is still turned on. Clamshell can look nice, but without adequate air flow the Mac may overheat, thus running the computer with the display open is recommended. If you’re going to do this, be sure to set the primary display so that the menubar, Dock, and alert windows go to the proper screen.\nSource: OSXDaily\n\nA: If I understand it correctly, you want to only be using your external display and have the internal display to be shut off. To achieve this, you want to put your macbook in clamshell mode. \nTo do this you must have your macbook attached to\n        a) an external power source\n        b) an external display\n        c)  external keyboard + mouse.\nThen all you do is close the lid (see pic below).\nWhen you want to put your mac to sleep you press opt+cmd+eject, and when you want to turn it on again you press any key on your wireless keyboard, having your macbook closed at all times.\nMore info can be found here.\n\n\nA: A solution for clamshell mode that works using Monterey without Third Party tools:\n\n*\n\n*run sudo nvram boot-args=\"niog=1\" in Terminal\n\n*reboot with the External Display connected\n\n*close the lid\n\n*use a plastic card (or similar which can't cause harm to your screen) to hit any key with the lid very slightly opened so that the internal display is not triggered\n\n*continue to open the lid\n\nThis behaviour gets reset as soon as your Mac goes to sleep, so use a tool like Amphetamine (or native pmset in Terminal) to keep your computer awake.\nIf your Mac went to sleep with the lip opened, it may be that closing it and waiting of a couple of seconds will turn the external  display on. After opening then, clamshell mode persists.\nUpdate\nIt seems to be the case that MacOS has a detailed protocol of determining when allowing lid-open clamshell mode. If you have an external input device available, follow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo nvram boot-args=\"niog=1\"\n\n*Run sudo pmset -a lidwake 0\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Unplug the external monitor\n\n*Close the lid\n\n*Plug in the monitor\n\n*Trigger your external input device (or plastic card)\n\n*Reopen the lid\n\nLid-open clamshell mode should now have been invoked.\n\nA: You know, you could just put the laptop into display mirror mode instead....  Just turn the brightness all the way off on the laptop display.\n\nA: If it wasn't clear from the comments, the behavior of clamshell mode changed in 10.7:\n\n\n*\n\n*If a laptop is connected to an external display, closing the lid doesn't put the laptop to sleep.\n\n*If you open the lid after that, the internal display is turned back on.\n\n\nsudo nvram boot-args=iog=0x0 restores the behavior in 10.6 and earlier.\nIf others were looking for a way to trigger normal display sleep (like when pressing ⌃⇧⏏), you can use SleepDisplay.\n\nA: While I haven't been able to find a command that will sleep the display natively, there is an app you download that will do it. There are two options from here.\n\n*\n\n*Install the app to the Applications folder and from Terminal or SSH run open /Applications/Sleep\\ Display.app\n\n\n*Right click on the app from the Downloads folder and click \"Show Package Contents\". Navigate to Contents/MacOS and copy the sleepdisplay file.\nNavigate to /usr/bin (you can use the ⇧+⌘+G shortcut and type the directory in) and paste the binary file.  You will now be able to type the command sleepdisplay into Terminal or through SSH and the display will immediately go to sleep.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: I wanted to do similar thing and this is what I found.

Upside down is probably the wrong phrase here, but whenever I start an app that uses landscape (e.g. a game) or watch a video, the first orientation is starts at is with the phone rotated left. In other words, with the volume controls on the bottom.\nHowever, it seems more logical to me that landscape mode is better the other way up. One reason is that the +/- volume is on the right/left respectively (volume increases to the right in the display) and is easier to access with a finger than thumb on the bottom. Furthermore, since the volume button is used to operate the shutter on the camera, it should be that way up when taking photos.\nIs there a reason that apps (Apple-provided and third party) have the default orientation the other way?\n\nA: I was going to chalk it up to the developer just being lazy and selecting the default value and tab-completing when creating their app. However, I tried it out for myself (create a new iOS app project, edit the $AppName-Info.plist file and add the following new row):\n\nYou can see that the first auto complete option for Landscape mode is (left home button), meaning the developer had to consciously choose the second option for it to be right sided as in your app. This supports stuffe's conjecture that this is done because most users are right handed.\nThe screenshot above are the options for iPad. The iPhone has the same set, except for the second one, which is absent.\n\nAFAIK, Apple doesn't advocate the use of a specific orientation as a default. Their iOS Human Interface Guidelines only say the following re: orientation\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch your app in your supported orientation, regardless of the current device orientation. For example, if your game or media-viewing application runs in landscape only, it’s appropriate to launch your app in landscape, even if the device is currently in portrait. This way, if people start your application in portrait, they know to rotate the device to landscape to view the content.\n\n\n*Support both variants of an orientation. For example, if your application runs only in landscape, people should be able to use it whether they’re holding the device with the Home button on the right or on the left. And, if people rotate the device 180 degrees while using your application, it’s best if you can respond by rotating your content 180 degrees.\nOn iPad, strive to satisfy users’ expectations by being able to run in all orientations. The large iPad screen mitigates people’s desire to rotate the device to landscape to “see more.” And, because people don’t pay much attention to the minimal frame of the device or the location of the Home button, they don’t view the device as having a default orientation. This lack of awareness of an app’s default orientation leads people to expect apps to run well in the device orientation they’re currently using. As much as possible, your application should encourage people to interact with iPad from any side by providing a great experience in all orientations.\n\nSo as you can see, they don't advocate for any particular orientation and encourage the developer to support all orientations. Also see this.\nHowever, this technical documentation uses an example with code for right-oriented apps (i.e., home button on the right). So another explanation – apart from the developer's own UX inclinations – is a copy-paste effect :)\n\nA: This can only be answered with conjecture really, but I would say that as most people are right handed, and therefore hold their phone in their right hand, then it is simply far easier to rotate 90 degrees the the left into Landscape (and indeed back again) that to do it the other way around without resorting to using both hands, which may be difficult if you were one handed, watching porn, or hanging off a cliff.\nThis is because the effective pivot point (bottom left as you hold it in portrait) is already near to the pivot clamp (your thumb) and does not require you to either take your hand off the phone, or slide the entire device through your hand and substantially alter your grip.\nTry it.\nAlso, the home button remains accessible to your right thumb in this orientation.\nI have created this instructional and educational video explaining the process, which you should really watch just to see my favourite Ape of Liberty T-Shirt.\n\nAlso, I could make up some crap about Feng Shuei, and the transperambulation of pseudo cosmic antimatter, but that would be taking it far too seriously.\n", "Q: Disk diagnostic and repair utility for Mac that works with all kinds of storage devices?

How can I transfer my imap mail from my older imac with 10.5.8?\n\nA: In the IMAP protocol, all E-Mails are stored and managed on the server. This allows multiple clients on different computers to manage the same mailbox.\nBy default, the Mail.app in OSX Lion also stores Drafts, Notes and Sent Messages on the server.\nJust setup your mail account in System Preferences → Mail, Contacts & Calendars and you should be fine. Your E-Mails will be downloaded from the server.\n\nA: You can use the Migration Assistant to import data from another Mac. It can transfer important information, such as user accounts, applications, network and computer settings, and files, from one Mac computer to another via a FireWire cable, ThunderBolt cable, or via an Ethernet or wireless network.\nSee “OS X Lion: How to use Migration Assistant to transfer files from another Mac”.\nP.S. As @gentmatt points out, for IMAP-based accounts you don’t need to transfer anything. Just set up your account and it will start downloading your messages. If you’d rather not re-download your entire mail archive, I’d recommend using the Migration Assistant though.\n", "Q: Why don't my aliases in .bashrc work? I have Lion on my Mac Air.

Guess I'm getting old and set in my ways using Spaces and Expose on my Macbook Pro.  I like my hotspots as they are and flip through the four screens with ease (option-arrow).  My work recently bought me an external monitor which I'd like to try and incorporate into my daily activities.  So, in my ideal world, I'd love to do the following:  \nDetach the displays in System Preferences -> Displays -> Arrangement so that the only way to move between monitors is by clicking/dragging via Spaces (where all eight screens show). I'd also want the monitor that I'm not working in to be unaffected by my movement through Spaces in the other.\nIs this, or something similar, possible?  Thanks so much for any help!\nMel\n\nA: I have not seen this.  Two things I have tried that help me, however, are:\nPin windows that you want on the side monitor to all spaces\nI've often treated my second monitor as more a static workspace that doesn't change no matter what space I'm in.  You can do this by\nSystem Preferences --> Expose and Spaces --> Spaces -->\nClick \"+\" under Application Assignments, and add the applications you want to stay on the second monitor to \"Every Space\".\nRun a virtual machine in the second window\nUsing VMWare I sometimes run Windows or Lion on the second monitor in full screen.

I may have switched view settings, updated Quicktime, etc. Do you know of a way that I can do this again?\n\nA: In order to show the play button, the icon needs to be at least 64x64 pixels. It works fine now that I've enlarged my icons from 60x60.\n\nA: I suspect you must have installed a very light weight media player at one time and associated your music files with it.\nYou should try VLC.

I am looking for iOS apps for the Stack Exchange network that support the iPad. This is very similar to this question, but the difference is that I'm looking for apps that run on the iPad (not in 2x mode). What different apps exist for browsing the Stack Exchange network on the iPad?\n\nA: I have used 2 for iPhone, and have eventually gone back to the Mobile View as it was considerably better than either:\nSix-to-Eight: Free. Worked OK, but you can't actually log in, you can merely track yourself as a user without being able to actually do anything\nStackMate: $.99. Looked great, but soon worked out that by Stack Exchange it actually meant just SO, and not the SE network - wasted dollar.\nAs for iPad, there are only 2 available that work on iPad:\n\n\n*\n\n*Answers for Stack Exchange\n\n*FullStack\nAnd they both suck (imho).\nFor a start, FullStack only supports the Trilogy sites and Ask Ubuntu, so not the whole network.  And while \"Answers for\" covers all sites, it shares a further letdown with Fullstack in that neither of them allow you to actually log in and do anything other than browse.  This (as per the comments) may be because the API calls do not allow posting, but there is no reason why an App developer cannot use the APIs where they are available, and also put in a normal HTML webview of the actual site to finish of the missing parts - using the API does not limit you to only using the API if you are writing an app.\nThe mobile web view is far superior in every respect unless you are looking for non interactive bedtime reading.  One noted problem with the mobile view is that Chat does not seem to recognise the fact that you are logged in, meaning that while transcripts are available, you cannot enter a room and participate.\nIn addition to the above, a quick hunt about StackApps yeilds the following results, which are either deprecated, or were never fully released and may be interesting to read up on.:\n\n\n*\n\n*StackUp\n\n*Stack Reader\n\n*iStack\nIf you are wanting a native iOS app for reasons such as getting push notifications, you can easily bodge up a system for allowing push notifications for your inbox to be sent to you iOS device.

Note, that the IFTTT feed checks currently run every 15 minutes.\n\nA: You can use George Edison's StackMobile to access the SE network on your iPad. Of course, you could argue that it is not an \"app\" in the true sense, but rather a web-app, but it serves the purpose.\n\"FullStack\" is an app (proper this time!) that lets you browse SO/SU/SF and AskUbuntu sites only.

It's available on the App Store here. \nSome tempting screenshots:\n\n\nIt's for-pay, but I might be able to get you a promo code if you ping me here. Maybe.\n\nA: Note: This requires ruby 1.9.x, Mac OS X ships with 1.8.7. So unless you're really big into it, this won't work.\nThis one is a little hackish, and I'm going to (eventually, someday) make it a little not so hackish. I promise.\nEver wanted to get notified of SE notifications? Going away from the computer for the weekend, but really want to make sure you don't miss anything \"important\"? Well, this is for you!\nFirst, install and sign up for Boxcar, if you haven't already. (and if you haven't, I highly recommend it! Works very nicely for notifications of all sorts - Twitter, email, Facebook, etc.)\nNext, you'll need to head over here and do two things:\n\n*\n\n*Change your user ID to whatever yours is. To find out what it is, take a look at the number in your profile URL:\nMine is http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/1739/jrg, so my user ID is 1739.\n\n\n*Get an access token. Head over to here and request one like below:\n\nAnd then after you've gotten an access token, you can copy it and then paste it into the part where it says \"FILL_ME_IN\".\nNow, you need to install two libraries - serel, and boxcar_api.\nRun sudo gem install serel boxcar_api and then wait until they are installed.\nNext, copy and paste this file into notify_me.rb (or whatever you want to call it). I'm going to assume its in ~/bin. Before you save, change the \"your_email@domain.com\" part to whatever you used to sign up for boxcar.\nNow, lets go and hop into cron.\nRun crontab -e in a terminal, which will edit your crontab.\nIt should ask you which editor you want to use, I suggest using nano unless you know vim or emacs really well.\nI'm going to assume you aren't that busy on the site, so we'll have it run every two hours.\nPaste the following into the bottom of your crontab:\n0 */2 * * *  ~/bin/notify_me.rb\nAnd then you should be good to go.\nEnjoy, and if you find bugs, feel free to send me an email:\njames@jamesrgifford.com\nEventually, someday, somehow, I'll move this into its own proper project, rather than a crazy hax\nKnown bugs/issues:\n\n*\n\n*Only checks every 2 hours. If possible, I'll change it in the future to check every 20 minutes or so.\n\n\n*Notifies you regardless of if you have a new inbox message or not.

Just check \"Encrypt Backup Disk\" in the Time Machine disk selection settings.\n\nIf you're backing up to another Mac, you can use Disk Utility on that Mac to erase non-boot drives and put an encrypted partition on them:\n\n", "Q: How to make Pages default to the folder of the opened file when exporting a PDF version? I regularly create documents in Pages, then convert them to a PDF using File → Export. I always save the PDF versions in the same folder as the original document.\nThis save dialog that opens always seems to remember the latest location that I saved to. However, for me it would be much more useful if it just assumed I want to save to the same directory as the original file.\nHow can I make Pages do this?\n\nA: There is a fantastic app called Default Folder X – but it's not cheap – around US$35. It enables a plethora of features that you can use in the Open/Save dialog of any app.\nOn the free side, you could try this trick: when you are in the dialog window for Exporting, you can actually drag a file from the Finder into the Export window, and it will automatically change to that same folder. This at least saves you from having to navigate around in the dialog window, since you are likely to have the window for the folder of the original document already open in Finder.\nFinally, just in case you didn't already know, the little pop-up at the top of most Open/Save/Export dialog windows lists your 5 most \"Recent Places\" at the bottom. So if you used \"Open...\" to open a file, that folder will likely appear in this list.\nE.g.:\n\n\nA: Believe or not, this flaw is the #1 time waster for me in my day to day work. To get the default export folder to be the same folder as the source file, I ended up making AppleScripts and embedding them in services using Automator. I did this for pdf and Word exports in Pages, pdf and Excel in Numbers, and pdf, PowerPoint, and png in Keynote.\nAttaching the code below--for each, you need to create a new \"Quick Action\" (service) in Automator, add a \"Run AppleScript\" step, set it to receive no input, and set it to work in the specific app for the script. You need to save each service under a different name (e.g. \"Pages Export to pdf\", \"Keynote Export to PowerPoint\", etc.) since even when made specific to an app services are global. As an optional last step I assigned keyboard shortcuts to them in each app (System Preferences → Keyboard → ...). Note if you do this you probably need to assign the shortcuts at the app level, not at the service level, since service shortcuts apparently cannot be duplicated.\nDisclaimer I'm not exactly amazing at Applescript so these might not be perfect--but they seem to work well enough for me.\nDefault Folder X seems like nice software but it does much more than just fix this one flaw, so it's a bit overkill. And if you don't want the rest of what it does, you can't disable that but still have it solve this problem.\nApple should fix this properly.\ntell application \"Pages\"\n    set exportFile to file of front document as text\n    set exportFile to text 1 thru -6 of exportFile\n    set exportFile to exportFile & \"pdf\"\n    export front document to file exportFile as PDF with properties {image quality:Best}\nend tell\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    reveal exportFile\nend tell\n\n\ntell application \"Pages\"\n    set exportFile to file of front document as text\n    set exportFile to text 1 thru -6 of exportFile\n    set exportFile to exportFile & \"docx\"\n    export front document to file exportFile as Microsoft Word\nend tell\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    reveal exportFile\nend tell\n\n\ntell application \"Numbers\"\n    set exportFile to file of front document as text\n    set exportFile to text 1 thru -8 of exportFile\n    set exportFile to exportFile & \"pdf\"\n    export front document to file exportFile as PDF with properties {image quality:Best}\nend tell\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    reveal exportFile\nend tell\n\n\ntell application \"Numbers\"\n    set exportFile to file of front document as text\n    set exportFile to text 1 thru -8 of exportFile\n    set exportFile to exportFile & \"xlsx\"\n    export front document to file exportFile as Microsoft Excel\nend tell\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    reveal exportFile\nend tell\n\n\ntell application \"Keynote\"\n    set exportFile to file of front document as text\n    set exportFile to text 1 thru -4 of exportFile\n    set exportFile to exportFile & \"pdf\"\n    export front document to file exportFile as PDF with properties {PDF image quality:Best}\nend tell\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    reveal exportFile\nend tell\n\n\ntell application \"Keynote\"\n    set exportFile to file of front document as text\n    set exportFile to text 1 thru -4 of exportFile\n    set exportFile to exportFile & \"pptx\"\n    export front document to file exportFile as Microsoft PowerPoint\nend tell\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    reveal exportFile\nend tell\n\n\ntell application \"Keynote\"\n    set exportFile to file of front document as text\n    set exportFile to text 1 thru -5 of exportFile\n    export front document to file exportFile as slide images with properties {image format:PNG}\nend tell\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    reveal exportFile\nend tell\n\n\nA: I use two workarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*Before each project, I use Finder to create a shortcut in the sidebar for the folder I'm working on.

I recently received a iPod Nano 6G for my birthday.  I very quickly found out that headphones/earbuds are required for radio reception.  My dad proposed the idea that the iPod uses the headphones/earbuds as the antenna.  Is his hypothesis correct?\n\n\n*\n\n*Does the iPod Nano 6G use the headphones as an antenna?\n\n\nA: Yes it does. From this Apple KB doc:\n\n[The] iPod nano uses the earphone or headphone cord as an antenna, so you must connect the earphone or headphone cord to the iPod to receive a radio signal.\n\n\nA: Most tiny radios use the headset as an antenna, and as Apple points out explicitly, so do they.\nRegular speakers and other earphones would work similarly, though perhaps not as well as the pair that came with the nano, as it likely has a specific length to best pick up FM transmissions.\nAll wires receive radio signals, and depending on the configuration and length they are better or worse than other wires.  In the case of the nano and similar FM radios that use the headphones as antennas, they use filters to couple the captured RF from the headphones into the FM receiver.  The filters usually consist of inductors and capacitors and permit only the RF energy to enter the FM receiver, while blocking the speaker output from the audio driver.  \nThe audio driver may have similar filters that block out the FM energy from the audio driver.  The speakers are natural filters - they won't react to signals much above 20kHz, and the radio RF is too small to make a difference even if they did perform at 95MHz.\nThe cable company does the same thing when they send digital TV, analog TV, phone service, and internet to the user, and the user sends back pay per view requests, and internet and voice data.  They all use different bands of the total cable bandwidth and they are separated by filters on each end so the right data gets to the right spot, even though they all share one wire.  If you have DSL internet service and take the filters off your phones, you'll notice additional noise on the line - because you are now letting the phone receive the DSL signal that was blocked by the filter.\n\nA: Yes.\nFrom the iPod nano manual (page 29):\n\n[The] iPod nano uses the earphone or headphone cord as an antenna, so you must connect earphones\nor headphones to iPod nano in order to receive a radio signal.\n\nWhere is the Antenna?\n\nWhere is the antenna? How can I get the best possible radio reception?\nThe iPod Radio Remote uses your earbuds as an antenna. For best\nresults, connect your earbuds to the headphones port on the iPod Radio\nRemote and extend/unwrap the earbuds cable completely. If you connect\nyour earbuds to the headphones port on your iPod, the iPod Radio\nRemote will not be able to recognize it as an antenna.\n\n[source: iPod Radio Remote - Frequently Asked Questions]\n\nA: I plug my 5th gen directly into a set of msr 400's, no probs. better sound through a mixer! \n", "Q: How best to share a Mac-connected printer with Windows 7 PCs on a workgroup network? I've currently got an old but decent non-network-capable laser printer connected to one of my Windows 7 PC's, and shared over the network (a plain Windows workgroup.) \nOther PCs in the house, my Mac mini, and my MacBook Air can access the printer, which has both Mac and PC drivers available (it's an HP LaserJet), and the printing setup is working perfectly right now.  I know, I know, ain't broke? don't fix!\nHowever, I need to keep that Windows 7 PC on in order to use the printer, and that PC is an energy-vampire.  My Mac mini is much better with respect to power consumption, and I'm therefore considering promoting it to always-on instead of the Windows box.\nI've seen questions about accessing PC-shared printers from a Mac, but not going the other way.  My questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I wanted to connect a printer to my Mac mini instead, what do I need to do in order to share this printer on the network so both my other Mac and my Windows PCs can continue to print?  Is a good reference for this procedure available online?\n\n*Can OS X share a printer on a network using the exact same protocol that Windows uses to share a printer, or is it necessarily different?  If there are protocol choices, how to choose?\n\n*If the sharing protocol is necessarily different, are Windows clients still able to mount Mac-shared printers?  Are there specific gotchas or caveats, say, about credentials or otherwise?  Job management?\nThank you.\n\nA: \nIf I wanted to connect a printer to my Mac mini instead, what do I need to do in order to share this printer on the network so both my other Mac and my Windows PCs can continue to print? Is a good reference for this procedure available online?\n\nShare the printer, and install Bonjour on your Windows 7 PCs.  It's likely already installed if they run iTunes.\n\nCan OS X share a printer on a network using the exact same protocol that Windows uses to share a printer, or is it necessarily different? If there are protocol choices, how to choose?\n\nNo, it will use it's own protocols, and they are basically Bonjour, or nothing\n\nIf the sharing protocol is necessarily different, are Windows clients still able to mount Mac-shared printers? Are there specific gotchas or caveats, say, about credentials or otherwise? Job management?\n\nOperationally a shared Mac printer should present no gotchas that a Windows one won't, for example it may struggle to report Ink Levels as a shared printer rather than over USB etc, you may only be able to print to a multifunction printer, and not scan etc.\n", "Q: How to Add Gmail Contact via iPhone I have my Gmail account configured via Exchange on my iPhone 4S.  When I add a new contact, it only adds it to my phone.  I have to add separately to Gmail and then merge duplicates, which seems like too many steps.\nI want this to work so that any contact I add through iOS is added to my Gmail contacts, not the local phone's contacts.  How can I accomplish this?\n\nA: In the settings, set your default Contacts account to Gmail.\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Settings\n\n*Navigate to Mail, Contacts, Calendars\n\n*Scroll down to Contacts\n\n*Under default account, select the email address you use with Gmail.\n\n\nNow whenever you create a contact on iOS, it will be added to Gmail. The only time a contact will not be added to Gmail is if you go into the Contacts application, select Groups on the top, and choose an account other than All Contacts or your Gmail account (e.g. iCloud).\n", "Q: Download manager for the iPad What's a good (paid or free) download manager app for the iPad?

I have some applications purchased through the Mac App Store, and I have two Macs.\nPresently, if I buy an application on my Mac mini, I just go and launch the App Store on my MacBook Air, and then download the application again from \"Purchases\".  And vice-versa if I bought on the Air first.  Similarly, I apply updates for each computer separately. I expect this is how most people do it.\nHowever, this practice consumes bandwidth. For small applications, it isn't a problem.  But what about big ones?  Say, the new Xcode, or a large game?\nWhat I'm getting at:\nIs it legal and is there a way to copy an application, myself, from one of my licensed computers to another of my licensed computers?  By \"licensed\", I mean both of my Macs access the Mac App Store with the same iTunes account, and therefore have access to the same apps, anyway.  I'm looking at reducing Internet bandwidth consumed, not circumvent license restrictions.\nMight a simple file copy of the application folder work?  Or, is something like this not supported and I just need to accept that buying apps this way will necessarily consume N * download size worth of bandwidth for each purchase and update?\nConsider, with iOS devices this isn't an issue, as long as you update one device, sync to iTunes, and then sync the other devices to iTunes– they'll get the updates without re-downloading.  How to do something like this for Macs?\n\nA: Yes\nYou can simply copy the application to your Applications folder, and then login to the Mac Application Store with the same username and password. This will validate the application and allow you to run it without needing to download it again. \nThe only time this will become a legal issue is if you are copying it to someone else's computer, however, they will not get updates for the application unless they log in as you, or otherwise, unless they also have a purchased copy of the application.\nYou can also read my answer here for a more detailed explanation of Application installs on the Mac and the Mac App Store.\n\nA: Yes, according to Apple: \n\nApps you purchase and install from Mac App Store can also be copied to an external hard drive, USB Flash Drive, CD/DVD, or backed up via Time Machine.\n\nand to restore, you just paste it back into the applications folder:\n\nIf you save a copy of an app to removable media (such as an external hard drive) or file share, simply drag the app back from its storage location to your Applications folder. When you open the restored app for the first time, you may be required to sign in with the Apple ID account that was used to purchase the app.\n\n", "Q: How to only route office traffic over the VPN while having default route for other traffic?

It seems that the best advice for battery longevity on my MacBook Air is to keep the battery cool. It doesn't have powerful fans like the MacBook Pro, so I would think that overheating is even more of a problem on an Air than a Pro. What are the best ways to keep the MacBook Air cool?\nNote: this isn't a duplicate of this question since that question (and the answers) deals with how to prevent the fan noise.\n\nA: Apple only provides a few recommendations.\nUse the computer on a hard surface:\n\nUsing the computer on a soft surface like a couch, pillow, bed, or your lap can trap heat requiring higher fan activity. Using the computer on a hard flat surface like a table or desk allows for optimal radiation of heat.\n\nDon't block the fans:\n\nMake sure the vents remain unblocked to allow your computer to perform at its best.\n\nOn the MacBook Air, the fans are located in back.\n\nA: Speaking from experience, I would say that you should be cautious of running Anti-Virus apps which actively scan your computer. They are often resource intensive, and I've noticed that these apps can conflict with Spotlight and cause the CPU usage to skyrocket for a long period of time, which heats up the battery.\n\nA: I got an iLap for my wife, and it works great.\n", "Q: Increase the size of bootcamp of Windows 7 on virtual machine Someone just helped me install VMWare Fusion and Windows 7 as virtual machine.\nAnd I realize that the disk BOOTCAMP (C:) for Windows 7 is just 39.90 Go, which will be too small... The disk Z is the shared folder with Mac OS.\nIs there any way to increse the size of the disk BOOTCAMP (C:) for Windows 7?\n \n\nA: You might be able to use the application GParted to do this. It's not an extremely simple process, since, \"The problem is that if you resize your boot/system partition, you will be completely unable to boot without repairing windows,\" according to this guide from How-To Geek. However, that same guide will guide you through the entire process of doing so.\nMac Rumors has a list of several alternate methods to accomplish your goal.\n", "Q: Change the official language of Windows 7 as virtual machine Someone just helped me install VMware Fusion on my Mac with Windows 7 as a virtual machine.\nAnd I just realized that the official language is French, instead of English. Although I can read French, but I definitely prefer the whole system to be in English.\nI don't think the “Region and Language” control panel is the right place to fix this, because I have already done as follows with English, which does not work:\n\nCould anyone tell me if this setting is 100% dependent on what I settings I picked when I first installed Windows, or it this changeable?\n\n\nA: No, you cannot change this. Microsoft Windows exists in versions specific to languages and regions. If you have the French version of Windows 7 Professional, you cannot change its user interface language. You have to purchase a copy of the English version of Windows 7 Professional, delete your French copy, and make a new installation with the English version.\nThe alternative is to upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate, which costs more money, and which can provide the user interface in different languages. The Microsoft Windows 7 Version Comparison Chart says that only Windows 7 Ultimate lets you \"Work in the language of your choice and switch between any of 35 languages.\"\nIt goes without saying that Microsoft will only sell you Windows 7 Ultimate at the upgrade price if your copy of Windows 7 Professional is legally purchased and registered.\n", "Q: How do I move a third-party application's menulet from one location to another in the menu bar? I bought QuickCal 3 from the Mac App Store recently.  Now, when I boot my Mac, the QuickCal menu icon shows on the menu bar, and where it wants to by default, I suppose.\nSince QuickCal has the ability to show the current day of the month within its icon, I thought it would work best if positioned next to my clock.\nI'm trying to save space in my menu bar (I have a lot of crap there already, you'll see), so I have \"Show date\" turned off for the built-in clock.  But, since I want to have the QuickCal icon, I figure it can do double-duty and add back in the day of the month .. my aging brain can still remember the month, anyway.\nSo, how can I accomplish this:\n\nThat is, how can I reposition a menu icon in the OS X menu bar?\nI tried dragging, but that didn't work.  Is there a way to do this in OS X (e.g. is there a keystroke I need to use while dragging?), or some preferences I'm not aware of?\nI realize my specific request may be a challenge because I want to move a 3rd party menu item in between two OS X built-in ones (The clock, & battery status.)\nFailing that, is there a third party tool I need to add to the multitude I installed already?  In the olden days on Windows XP, I used to have a tool called Taskbar Shuffle that permitted rearrangement of icons in the taskbar and system tray .. anything similar for OS X (but for the menu bar)?\nThanks!\n\nA: You can't move it into the same area as the OS icons.  The only way to rearrange the third-party apps is to close programs and re-open them, because they appear in the order the programs were opened.\n\nA: I recently came across this free tool:  Broomstick.  One of its features is \"Customize Order of Menubar Icons.\"  I was able to use it to reorder some third party menu bar icons, but as @AndrewLatham has noted in his answer, this also wouldn't permit moving a third-party app's menu icon into the area used by the OS X icons.\n\nA: You can do this in macOS Sierra without using any third-party apps. All you need to do is hold the Command key down while you click and drag the application icon to another spot in the menu bar.\n\nA: The only way I've found to be able to do this is by using Bartender. It's all I use Bartender for (which makes the $15 price tag seem a little steep); I hide the Bartender icon and disable the other features. But it does a beautiful job of allowing me to command-drag menu bar icons. \n\nA: Two possible items found at cnet.com ...

This question is related to both iMac and Windows, but since it is happening on an iMac 27 inch model, so I hope posting in the Apple forum is more relevant.\nBasically, when an iMac is connected to an HDTV, part of the screen is missing near the margin (about 3% to 5%).  If running Mac OS X, the issue can be solved by using \"underscan\" in the System Preferences.  But what if the iMac is running Windows 7, can a similar solution be used?  (I don't see such options for the graphics card...).\n(The solution of the iMac if running OS X is: How to solve Mini DisplayPort to HDMI Overscan problem? (Part of the screen is missing) ) \n\nA: Are you sure you need to have a software solution within Windows?  Many HDTVs let you adjust current display settings to disable the overscan.  See PCWorld - Tech Trend: For HDTV, Don't Overlook Overscan.  Quote:\n\nIf you don't see every pixel you should see, you're not viewing a true\n  1920 by 1080 progressive-scan picture. The name of the viewing mode\n  differs from brand to brand, but it's commonly called Dot-by-Dot,\n  Point-to-Point, Just, or simply Overscan Off.\n\nTo add to that, on my own HDTV, choosing \"Studio\" under the Aspect setting has the effect of eliminating the overscan.  I've also seen it called simply \"PC\" on another TV, and \"Just Scan\" on another.\nCheck your HDTV's settings ... chances are it has something like this and you aren't aware of it.  Though, admittedly there are some HDTVs without such a capability (sadly) and for these you'll need to find a solution that lets you reduce the resolution output to the HDTV.\nUpdate: I found the following article explains well both the issue and troubleshooting steps: Windows Experts Community - Configure Your Display and Display Adapter.\nPlus: some folks have successfully replaced the Apple video drivers in their Bootcamp Windows with ATI drivers, in order to access settings to compensate for the HDTV overscan.  See this blog post: Apple Macbook Pro (Early 2011) running Bootcamp Windows 7 with ATI / AMD Catalyst Control Center.  Got ATI video in your Mac?  Worth a shot perhaps, if you do.  Take a backup before messing with drivers, of course.\n", "Q: Does the Mac support multitouch screens in any way? I love using touch with Windows 7 and 8. Especially on Windows 8, the touchscreen finally feels like it's respected just as much as the keyboard and mouse.\nSo, naturally, I'd want to carry this experience over to the Mac. I've used a Macbook/MBP trackpad, but those aren't the same. They are not nearly as large and usable as a full touchscreen.\nSo: Does the Mac support touch screens in any way?\n\nA: One way to get something close, is to use your iPad as a secondary display to your Mac.  In this way you are able to extend your normal desktop onto the iPad and input using touch.\nSee this answer on a different question for more details\n\nA: Update (2017-03-05): Since Yosemite (10.10), T232HL seems to be far less buggy. However, it's still not very multi-touch.\n\n23\" Acer T232HL works without issues with Windows 8.x and Ubuntu 14.04 -- but not with the latest-and-greatest stable release, OS X Mavericks.\nOS X Mavericks recognizes it, but first few touches always go to upper-left corner (coordinates 0,0) and are interpreted as a click. Only third or fourth touch goes to the proper place -- but at that time it's already in the \"click\" phase, so the touch gets interpreted as a drag. It also gets recognized as a graphics tablet (Ink icon appears in System Preferences), but other than that, touchscreen is fairly useless with OS X. \nWhich is a shame, as its usefulness would be a middle ground between usability under Windows and Linux.\nAll this happens with a monitor that, to the best of my knowledge, represents itself as a standard USB HID device.\nHence, despite what other answers claim, I'd say multitouch screen support on OS X is incomplete and broken. Drawing conclusions based on multitouch touchpads or singletouch screens or singletouch graphics tablets is silly and incorrect.\nThere are some third-party commercial drivers that perform some magic to get multitouch screens into a usable state. Since the question was presumably about the stock OS, discussing them is out of scope for this answer.\n\nA: Touch-Base\nTouch-Base offers drivers for multi-touch support with their software UPDD Touch. According to their website, version 6 supports macOS 10.8 and above:\n\nOur drivers can be used to add touch support where none exist or for enhanced functionality not offered by the native driver support or to support touch hardware not supported in certain operating system releases. UPDD supports multi-touch at an operating system level (if supported) but also at a native UPDD API and TUIO Server level allowing for the development and support of multi-touch and multi-user UPDD API and TUIO client applications.\n...\nUPDD V6 driver is available for MacOS 10.8 and above. It supports legacy serial and non-HID USB devices as well as modern HID USB devices. When using a multi-touch touch screen it supports full multi-touch gestures, mimicking the functionality of a multi-touch trackpad or magic mouse. UPDD V5 is still available for Mac OS X 10.6 and 10.7.\n\nUPDD Touch Software is not cheap though: a single MacOS and Windows commercial / business license is USD 150, EUR 120, GBP 95.\nCheck the documentation for more information.\n\nA: As far as I know, there is currently no native support for touch screens on OS X. I strongly believe this is because Apple wants you to do that on iOS instead, so I don't see touch adoption on OS X in the near future.\n", "Q: What's the OS X equivalent of a BSOD? As a Windows user, I've seen my share of BSODs. I've also seen some errors from Macs, but as I haven't used them as long, I don't really know what the Mac OS X error screens are like.\nI've seen some kernel panics and some other error screens, but what I want to know is which one is the basic equivalent of a BSOD. Is it a kernel panic? Is it something else?\nWhat's the OS X equivalent of a BSOD?\n\nA: A BSOD is the equivalent of kernel panic in unix and unix-like OSes. From the wiki article:\n\nIn Unix-based operating systems, a similar term is kernel panic.\n\nThat said, I've seen the following image two times over the past 3-4 years. This is a kernel panic screen, as described in this support article.\n\n\nA: There is no equivalent to a Blue Screen of Death on a Mac. Mine has been running 12 Hours a Day for 7 years with no issues whatsoever. \n\nA: Probably gonna be the ISPL. This is much more severe in looks, but it is about equivelant.\n", "Q: Animated GIF images are slow on iOS Animated GIF images seem incredibly slow since iOS 4.3ish. Prior to that, animated GIFs worked just fine and had the same speed as on a computer. I don't mean loading the GIF, but the speed of the animation. They are the same on the iPhone 3GS and iPad 2, so it's probably not hardware based. However, they work fine in the Simulator. I suspect the libraries were changed at some point. Can anyone confirm this, and/or provide a remedy. Animated GIFs hosted at senorgif.com are the main culprits.\nEDIT: iOS 6 seems to have fixed the issue; probably a memory allocation related, since each frame used to get slower and slower :P\n\nA: I visited the link provided, and I was unable to recreate this issue. The speed of the animations seems perfectly fine on iPhone 4S. If you have had this problem on numerous devices, I kindly suggested reporting it to Apple as a potential bug. More than likely, if it hasn't already been reported, an engineer will get back to you with a request and instructions on how to submit more information regarding the matter to them.\nTo submit a bug report to apple, visit http://bugreport.apple.com.\nI would also like to suggest downloading Google Chrome for iOS or Opera Browser for iOS and visiting the same website(s). See if the animations are just as slow there. This will give you a bit more detail to submit to Apple with your bug report. If the issue is only in Mobile Safari, that will help them track the problem down much faster. If it exists in all browsers on the device, they will know that they need to look a bit deeper into iOS itself. Either way, I'm afraid I can't offer a quick fix for the issue as it seems to be a rather rare occurrence.\nGood luck and happy LOLing!\n", "Q: Does the MacBook show FaceTime missed calls? I use my MacBook Air for FaceTime calls, while a friend calls me using an iPad 2.\nSince I don't always keep my Air turned on all the time, my friend's calls often end up unanswered. However, it's very rare that I see these on my Mac. It was only once that I actually saw a missed call in my FaceTime.\nDoes FaceTime actually store missed call information on Apple's servers? Should they appear in my MacBook once I turn it on?\n\nA: It will show up in your missed calls list in FaceTime.app (even if your computer is turned off at the time):\n\nSo yeah, FaceTime stores missed call information on Apple’s servers. It will show up in FaceTime.app, but you need to open FaceTime.app for it to show.\n\nA: I'm running iOS 9 and I too don't get missed call notifications. Also, there is no tab as missed now. The 2 tabs are video, Audio for video and audio calls respectively on both iOS and OS X. When any device is not connected to the Internet and someone did FaceTime you, there won't be a 'notification' anywhere. I've submitted several bug reports but it hasn't been taken care of. \n", "Q: Which is the best alternative for Dreamweaver in Mac? I'm looking for a few freeware alternatives to Dreamweaver that I can use in my Mac that runs on OS X Lion. Shoot the best free, website development applications you know?\n\nA: Adobe Dreamweaver (for Mac) — $399\nAs Andrew Larsson said, there is Mac version for latest Adobe Dreamweaver (url is the same as for Windows version).\nIf it's a tool that you like and already own, but it's not supported by Mac, then you may try to make it work under OSX using Parallels or wine. Some people made different Dreamweaver versions to work on wine (on linux), so you may try to install wine on Mac and then install Dreamweaver in this case.\n\nFraise\nEasiest and most user friendly editor I've found so far is Fraise. It is small and nice, there's no 'workspaces' like in Eclipse and key-combinations like in Eclipse and Vim. It just stays out of your way and allows to edit HTML (there is preview window for it), CSS, and a lot of other file formats. I haven't seen yet any possibility of code-completion, but is it a big deal?\n\nIronically you may need to build it from source (but it's very and fast if you know how to use git and Xcode)\n\nQuanta Plus\nThey say that it supports both code editing and WYSIWYG and it definitely works on OSX so you may like it. I've never tried it though. \n\n\nThere are also at least 2 tools based on Eclipse that you can use for web development:\nEclipse IDE for JavaScript Web Developers\nIt incluses tools for JavaScript developers creating Web applications, including a JavaScript IDE, tools for JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and XML.\nAs alternative you can install any other eclipse but make sure that it contains Web Tools or install them in eclipse of your choice:\n\n\nAptana Studio\nIt's also based on Eclipse. Besides HTML, CSS and JavaScript it supports server-site scripting languages (Ruby, Python, PHP). You can preview web pages you edit in built-in browser, but I don't know if it is possible to edit webpages visually in Elipse based IDEs. \n\n\nA: vim or MacVim\nVi is already installed on your machine, and you can get to it by using the Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) and typing vim. \nMacVim gives you a few extra features:\nMacVim supports multiple windows with tabbed editing and a host of other features such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*bindings to standard OS X keyboard shortcuts (⌘Z, ⌘V, ⌘A, ⌘G, etc.)\n\n*transparent backgrounds\n\n*full-screen mode \n\n*multibyte editing with OS X input methods and automatic font substitution\n\n*ODB editor support\n\n\n\n\nA: As already noted, this question is a bit vague. So I don't know if you want a WYSIWYG editor or not. So, I'll mention Panic's Coda.\nIt's a great code editor that supports syntax highlighting and (and my personal favorite) auto fill. It will automatically fill in as you type:\n\n\nThe other thing is that it has an FTP client built-right into it. This is a great application and well worth $100 you spend for it. \n\nA: This question is a bit vague — it depends on how you use Dreamweaver. Which Dreamweaver features are important to you? Which ones do you not need?\nIf you don’t use the WYSIWYG editor (you shouldn’t!) and you’re just looking for a great IDE / code editor, then Sublime Text 3 might be of interest. It’s currently in beta and free (although you can pay to register if you want). It’s highly customizable, too.\n\n\nA: You should look at 'Aptana Studio', currently at Version 3, which is the best free Web-Development Plattform. It's based on the Eclipse Framework, so it's probably not everybodys taste. I think it's a bit sluggish, which is why i bought 'Coda'.\n\n\nA: Best WYSIWYG alternative to Dreamweaver for OS X is Kompozer.\nNow that Adobe is going cloud only for their software I don't want to spend $200 a year for Dreamweaver. I've found Kompozer to open, change, save my current websites without a problem. Sometimes it is faster for me to make changes via WYSIWYG than by code, sometimes by code. \n\nA: If what you want is the bells and whistles (graphcal user interface, buttons for everything, project templates with finished page layouts etc) there are alternatives to DW. Personally I can't stand DW because I feel like I loose control over many aspects of the development process, so I usually stick to the mentioned editor \"Sublime Text\" as it has a large community and plugins for doing all sorts of development, both web based and other. \nIt takes a couple of hours to get comfortable with, and all the configuration happens in text files using JSON, but it is really worth the money as you can use the same license (even synchronize preferences) between Windows, Linux and Mac machines you may have. \nIf you want pre-made templates and stuff you can take a look at\nRapid Weaver\nIt has some really cool features that makes web design a piece of pie. \n\nA: There's also CodeKit. It's new and I'm not overly familiar with its capabilities, but thought I should include it for completeness.\n", "Q: Is an iTunes card country-specific? If I buy a iTunes card in Europe, Holland, could I (or anyone who has the key) use it in Australia?\n\nA: iTunes Gift Cards will only work in the same country they were bought in.\n\niTunes Gift Cards are not available in Luxembourg, Portugal, or Greece. Gift recipient must have or open an iTunes Store account in the same country as purchaser to redeem gift. The iTunes Store is available only to persons age 13 or older in the U.S. and many other countries; see http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/ww for a list of countries. Requires iTunes 6.0 or later (7.0 or later for video), compatible hardware and software, and Internet access (fees may apply). Terms apply. See http://www.apple.com/itunes/store for more information.\n\nOf course, if you buy a card for yourself, you’re both the purchaser and the recipient. So only buy iTunes Gift Cards in countries where you have an iTunes Store account.\n\nA: I once had the same thing. My girlfriend bought me a iTunes Gift Card in The Netherlands, but since we live in Belgium, I couldn't use it. So I contacted Apple and the responded:\n\nMichiel, unfortunately, gift cards and gift certificates are\n  redeemable only on the iTunes Store for the country for which they\n  were purchased. International gift exchanges are not allowed.\nI know that is disappointing, and I do apologize for the\n  inconvenience, but perhaps your friend would like to give the card to\n  someone who lives in The Netherlands, or use it herself.\nPlease do not hesitate to let me know if you have any further\n  questions, Michiel, and I will gladly assist you further.

So you can find out a way around. If you've jailbroken your iPad, you can use Cydia to install YourTube HD which will allow you do download movies directly onto your iPad.\nIf you don't which to jailbreak your iPad, you can install TagDisk HD.\n", "Q: Lion OS install for new SSD. Do I need to install Leopard first? I was going to replace my HDD with a SSD - but I need to install Lion for my SSD.\nDo I need to install Leopard on the SSD first, then go to the Mac App Store to update?\n\nA: No, you can install Lion directly if you want. This will save you a lot of time, as you would otherwise have to upgrade from Leopard to Snow Leopard first, only to upgrade to Lion afterwards.\nBuy a bootable OS X Lion USB stick\nYou can buy a bootable OS X Lion USB Thumb Drive from the Apple Store: http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD256Z/A\n\nCreate a bootable OS X Lion USB stick or DVD based on the Mac App Store download\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy and download Lion from the Mac App Store.

Navigate to Contents/SharedSupport and look for a file called InstallESD.dmg.\n\n*Open up Disk Utility and drag the DMG file into the left-hand sidebar. If you’re burning it to a DVD, insert your DVD, select the disk image in the sidebar, and hit the “Burn” button. Skip down to the last step to use it.\n\n*If you want to burn Lion to a USB flash drive, plug it in and click on it in the left-hand sidebar in Disk Utility. Go to the Partition tab and select “1 Partition” from the dropdown menu. Choose “Mac OS Extended (Journaled)” on the left.\n\n*Hit the “Options” button under the partition table and choose “GUID Partition Table”. You’ll need this to make the drive bootable on a Mac.

I just got my new iPad and installed the apps I wanted without first syncing it with my computer. When I connect it to my computer and choose to sync apps, iTunes wants to add all my 400+ purchased iPad apps to the iPad, and I don't want that. \nIs there an easy way to deselect these 400 apps that I don't want from within iTunes? They are arranged on the last screens after the apps that I actually want.\n\nA: Unfortunately iTunes doesn't support selecting multiple applications, apart from manually selecting each one. The best option would be to disable syncing of Applications on iTunes.\nFor iTunes sync to work correctly you either need to use it to manage your applications, or only use the iPad and download all the applications you want directly to the iPad using the App Store on the iPad. \n\nA: I had the same issue and dug for an answer. What you need to do is instead of using iTunes go into your documents and search 'app' all the files for the apps listed in your iTunes will come up, simply select them all and click delete. This is an easy was to remove a large amount of apps at once. If you want some back simply go into the app store and re download them. \n\nA: I found an easier way to do it. On the screen that lists your apps from iTunes, doubleclick on the iPhone-preview and click on the X for each app icon.\n", "Q: Is there a Mac equivalent for UDEV folder on linux?

But it seems like I can't find the folder where to put the rule.\nSo does anyone know where I could find a udev or rules folder?\n\nA: udev doesn't exist on OS X. As an alternative, you can use the diskutil activity command to continuously monitor disks being mounted or ejected. The diskutil man page says\n\nContinuously display system-wide disk manipulation activity as reported by the Disk Arbitration framework until interrupted with a signal (e.g. by typing Control-C).

Invariably, it will fail with the message that the iPhone is no longer connected to the internet.\nThe wifi over which my iPhone is connected is also being used by four other computers that have no problems maintaining their connection with the internet.\nCurrently, the estimated time remaining for the restore is 11 hours. It has come down from 52 hours. This over a broadband connection of 120Mb/sec down and 9 Mb/sec up.\nThe size of the  backup on iCloud from which I am trying to restore my iPhone is 8GB.\nPlease advise.\nEdit - to clarify: the problem is that iCloud restore fails.\nAlso, I tried turning off my Airport Extreme router for about five minutes earlier today. No luck: restore from iCloud failed after an hour and a half with the message that the iPhone was not connected to the internet. I also tried to connect the ADSL modem directly to my MacBook Air, sharing its internet connection over wifi my my iPhone 4S with the exact same result.\nEdit 2 - I can start the restore, but it finishes after an hour or so with the dialog box that the iPhone is not connected to the internet.\n\nA: I had the same problem. Tried for days to get it to work. On my 17th try, the restore completed. On that try, I was keeping the display active by tapping it every 40 seconds for around 2 hours and I had also turned off all encryption on my router. Not sure what caused it to work this time.\nThe weird thing is, the restore finished when the status bar said there were \"about 3 hours\" left in the restore. Seems like it miscalculated the size of my backup or something like that.\nApple really needs to figure this out.\n\nA: I found that it fails unless the screen is on when it gets to 100%. Which is hard to ensure since the screen turns off after one minute when restoring from a backup :P\n\nA: It seems if you only leave it for a few minutes it either keeps downloading, or pauses but is able to resume. If you leave it for longer it seems like power saving kicks in and the WiFi gets turned off...\nI've spoken to several people on the phone at Apple, they are helpful but their only suggestion is tapping the screen to keep it awake. One guy got my hopes up saying if you turn 'Back to your Mac' on it will download the iCloud backups and let you restore, but when I pushed him on that, turns out it actually doesn't.

As her text editor of choice, she'd like to use pages, but there, the bullet points aren't shown on her braille display.\nShe has also tried openOffice, but there, VoiceOver doesn't read anything, probably because of the use of a non standard UI kit.\nHow can we either solve the pages problem, or what's an editor that will read everything correctly?  \n\nA: It's tough to tell where the problem lies. I don't have a perfect software recommendation, since Apple's tools generally support accessibility on par with the best third party apps around.\nHow much research have you and your friend done on making sure your display is configured correctly in VoiceOver?\nI'd start with this support article to see if the display you have chosen is even supported but do know from past experience, that you will face many many little issues like this where voiceover is skipping some little element of formatting and can't convey all of the nuance of a document that is kerned, font tweaked with ligatures, variable line spacing, etc...\nUsually this is something you can adjust the documents or the VoiceOver software to accommodate better, so the next step might be to flatten the document to a plain text file and compare how Text Edit works as opposed to Pages. \nYou may need to reach out to Apple directly (their discussion forums like here are not official support channels) and ask if the accessibility team needs you to file radar (Apple's name for bug reports) if you find a fairly common item that is not being supported correctly by the software (Pages / Text Edit / VoiceOver in your case). By sticking to Apple software, they might have a better chance of fixing some little omissions that could help you with your choice of braille display.

It's a mid-2010 MBP (bought it off craigslist). At first, I absolutely loved the simplicity of the OS. When I decided to upgrade to Lion, I began to loathe the system. More times than not, the machine won't wake up from sleep. The keyboard lights up, the HDD spins up, but the screen is dark.\nI've Googled for weeks. It seems that many people are experiencing the same issue, and no one seems to have a fix. It also appears that Apple is completely ignoring this issue (I can say confidently that this will be my last Mac).\nAny idea(s) what I can do to solve this issue?\nNote: Reverting to Snow Leopard is not an option - I did not receive the OS disks when I purchased the machine.\n\nA: If you can get your MacBook back on make sure it's completely up to date, so that there are no more updates in Software Update.\nSpecifically make sure your Firmware is up to date, Software Update should catch this. If Software Update doesn't show a Firmware Update, then you can try downloading this Firmware Update directly from the Apple website: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1098 If it's already installed or doesn't apply to your system it will tell you this and prevent you from installing it.\n\nIf that fails you can try reinstalling Lion. This is not as big of a job as it sounds. Turn off the Macbook and turn it back on, as it starts hold (before you get to the white screen) the alt key, and choose to boot into the Recovery Partition.\nWhen you reinstall Lion it will download the latest copy of Lion (this can take a while depending on your Internet Connection*), and install it without deleting your files (the equivelant of Repairing Windows), though to be on the safest side you might want to backup at least your most important files, however I have reinstalled Lion in this way quite a few times without any loss of data. The actual instalation will take about 1/2 hour.\n*If your connection is too slow, then go to an Apple shop, connect to their WiFi and do the reinstall there. They have local copies of the latest Lion OSX, so the download should be very fast.\n\nOtherwise, the best thing you can do is to take it to an Apple shop, you can just go there with the MacBook and tell them and show them whats wrong (don't worry if it suddenly starts working as you walk in the shop, they will still believe you). They will do their best to help you.\nYou will receive the best service if you don't go in accusing them and hassling. Also try to avoid the busiest times of day if you can.\nEven if you're out of warranty, they will help you, although you may have to pay for repairs if it's extensive and not a problem with the model, but sometimes you can get them to do it for free.\n\nA: I've experienced this problem when I had bad RAM.  You should run a hardware diagnostic to test all the hardware and make sure it runs.\n\nA: In addition to Jonathan's excellent suggestions, another option you'd want to try is installing Lion on a clean, formatted disk. This usually solves problems with other OSes, so I wouldn't be surprised if it works for OS X too.\nAlso, consider this issue to be an exception. I had been an Apple hater too, but over the years I've come to appreciate the engineering excellence built into their products.\n\nA: I am having the same problem, apparently Time Machine is trying to do something behind the scene. The problem is gone after I disable Time Machine.\nI believe there's a lot of causes to the not-waking-up problem, mine might not be the same as yours, but it's worth a try.\n", "Q: Why does someone else's notifications come up on my Twitter account for iPhone? I let my friend sign into Twitter on my iPhone and we deleted her account afterwards. After that, all her notifications, such as mentions and messages still come up on my iPhone. It’s really annoying. How can I get it to stop doing that?\n\nA: In a nutshell - your phone asked to be notified and never cleaned up that request (or the clean up request didn't get processed correctly.)\nIf you simply uninstall the application and wait (perhaps using a different iOS twitter app in the meantime), the system will remove your device from that notification queue once it misses enough deliveries of a notification. This takes a variable amount of time, so you might want to force the issue by logging back in as your friend and removing the request to send notifications to your iPhone.\nAccording to this thread on the Apple support forums, here’s that fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in with the previous account in Twitter settings.\n\n*Go to the Twitter apps’s “accounts” page.\n\n*Click “Settings” (bottom left).\n\n*Edit the notifications of the previous account by switching to “off” for “mentions and replies” and “message”.\n\n*Finally, delete the account again.\n\n\nA: Sign into Twitter on your computer using the other person's account, or send them these instructions.\nGo to Settings, then Apps (left hand side), then click on 'Learn how to revoke an iOS app', read 'How to revoke access to the iOS 5 integration from the web' and follow the instructions. \nGo back to the Twitter web page. Click 'Revoke access' next to iOS 5 Twitter integration, and then you're done.\n\nA: *\n\n*Remove the account in Settings.\n\n*Remove the Twitter app.\n\n*Rurn your phone off for a couple minutes.\n\n*Turn it back on reinstall the Twitter app.\n\n\nThe problem should be gone!\nI tried everything and this finally fixed it.\n", "Q: View your rated music, apps and etc. on the iTunes? I would like to ask, where could I find all my rated music, apps and etc. on the iTunes?

I'm trying to avoid having to sync my iOS devices with a computer for any reason, but so far haven't been able to come up with a way to find a youtube video and cache it locally so when I leave an internet connected area I can still view it.\nThe methods to do it that are most common all involve a computer:\nSaving online videos (e.g. YouTube) and moving them to iPad for later offline viewing?\nIs there an app, or a process I can follow, that will cache youtube videos on the iOS device for viewing in a slow internet situation, or away from internet access?\n\nA: Video Downloader Pro Lite is the app you're looking for.\n\nTo begin a download:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Browse on the web.\n  \n*Select any video on any website,\n  \n*Click download.\n  \n\nIt works pretty well for me!\n\nA: I'm using FoxTube for caching many youtube videos for offline viewing, and I just love the app.\niPhone version\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/foxtube-youtube-cache/id486365960?mt=8\niPad version\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/foxtube-hd-youtube-cache/id491640360?mt=8\n", "Q: current leakage of MacBook Pro? I can feel current leakage on my MacBook Pro when it is being charged. And it seems a lot of people in my country report the same problem. \nIs this because of the voltage(220V) we use?\nWhat's the solution? \nUPDATE I went to Apple Store(Shanghai, China) several hours ago and they refused to do anything. weird company. I bought my MacBook Pro 3 months ago.\n\nA: The solution for me was to use the adapter with a three pin extension cord.\nThen your notebook is earthed and no more charges stay on the cover that shock you :-). Some Macbooks suffer from insulation failure of the casing. A third contact provides for a connection to earth ground so that net charge can escape the cover. This requires a wall socket with proper earthing.\n\n\nA: This is most likely due to an earthing problem. I used to have the same problem on my MacBook Air. To fix it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure that you're using the three pin socket converter.\n\n*Ensure that the connections are secure enough.\n\n*Ensure that there is proper earthing in your building.\n\n\nFor me, the problem was #2. I had to replace the (non-Apple) adapter that converts between US and Indian sockets.\n220 volts is not the issue. The MacBook adapters are built to support it and the transformer within steps down the voltage appropriately.\n\nA: If you are in an EU region or a country that uses Schuko-type plugs, refer to this.\nI found a product with Grounded Plug (duckhead) as shown in the picture below that is a Schuko type for EU.\nThe grounding function is activated when the Apple Power Adapter ground pin and the plug ground pin are combined.\n\nIt says that you can buy it on Amazon now.\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08JYWKTZ3?ref=myi_title_dp&th=1\nDoodle Plug is available for Apple MacBook, iPad chargers in EU countries (Germany, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Austria, Greece, etc.).\n\n*\n\n*Available for all Apple Chargers (Magsafe, USB Power adapters) with\nground pins\n\n*Anti-static and device protection while charging Apple products\n\n*Compatible with both Schuko type outlets, including the EU and Korea\n\n*Significantly reduce iPad and iPhone touch errors (including Apple\nPencil) while charging\n\n*Reduces the noise of earphones or speakers when charging\n\n", "Q: Under what cases will I get iWork or iLife? After looking at various models of Macs and looking at Apple's iLife and iWork pages, I'm more confused than where I started.\nOriginally, I thought that nothing - just Lion - came with a new Mac. But then I saw something here that says that iLife is a part of every new Mac.\nSo I thought. But then I saw this that said that iLife is not a part of Lion. Huh? Then, to add to my confusion, I saw this, that said that iWork does not come with a new Mac. Hmm. So after doing some research, I've arrived at these conclusions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple really needs a central place to see what comes with a new Mac and what doesn't.\n\n*iWork is seperate from iLife, but both can be bought from the Mac App Store.\n\n*iLife comes with Lion.\n\n*Nothing comes with iOS.\n\n*I'm really confused.\n\n\nSo: Under what cases would I get iWork or iLife?\n[example answer] You get iWork if you buy XYZ and iLife if you buy ABC. Both come on the Mac Pro, and none are on the iPad by default; however you can get iOS versions through the App Store for $41.34 each. You can buy them for $700 each on the MAS. The MacBook Air comes with iLife but not iWork; so does the MacBook Pro.\n\nA: Every new Mac (MBP, iMac, Mac Mini, MacBook Air, Mac Pro) purchased from Apple comes preinstalled with \n\n\n*\n\n*the latest version of Mac OS X\n\n*the latest version of iLife\n\n*no iWork\nEvery new iDevice has:\n\n\n*\n\n*the latest version of iOS\n\n*no iWork\n\n*no iLife\nEvery new copy of Lion has:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lion\n\n*no iWork\n\n*no iLife\n\nA: I think perhaps OP is confused about what & why, and the answers above were lacking in detail although accurate.\nMaybe this will help?\nWhen you buy a new Mac, it will come with the current OS, and a free copy of iLife.\nIf you upgrade your OS at a later date, you're only buying the OS, so when iLife is updated you would need to buy that separately.\nMac apps and iOS apps are different, but they do have counterparts, such as the iWork apps. These are individual purchases on iOS, and not included with anything for free.\niWork isn't free with anything, and since the Mac app store, it's just the individual apps rather than the full suite, as is the case on the iOS app store.\n", "Q: Writing EOF (End of File) on Windows 7 with bootcamp I'm looking for a way to input the EOF char into the command line on my MacBook Pro with Windows 7 running in Boot Camp.\nI've tried several suggested shortcuts and the on-screen keyboard but none of it works.\n\nA: In Windows, use Ctrl+Z to enter an EOF. If you're not on an empty line, you'll need to press that shortcut twice, once to flush the buffer of the current line, and the second to send the actual EOF.\n", "Q: Backup online iMessage repository Is there a way to download/export iMessage history somewhere? If I deleted messages on a local device, is it also removed online on iCloud?\n\nA: You can use PhoneView or a similar application to download your iMessage database to your Mac.\niMessage data is not stored in iCloud, not even as a backup.\n\nA: If you want to access your iMessage history, use Baskup, an OS X application that backs up all your iMessages from your Macbook \nhttps://peterkaminski09.github.io/baskup\n", "Q: Adding my email address -MacBook When i purchased a new Mac book and turned it on for the first time, there was a pop up where i had to enter my name, address, email etc.\nI skipped the email field, and now in xCode, my name and my company name gets displayed as comments and not my email address. So how can i get my email to get displayed in xCode in the comment section ? \nnote: I only want my email ID to be displayed in xCode and not in other applications.\n\nA: By default, Xcode does not include your email in the automatically generated headers, regardless of whether you gave it to your Mac or not.\nHowever, if you want to change how the automatically generated headers look, navigate to Xcode.app, right-click it, click on Show Package Contents, then go to Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/File Templates. There you will find the templates Xcode uses; feel free to edit them to include your email address.\nNote: the above assumes you have the latest version of Xcode, which is installed as an app, with the Developer directory inside the app bundle. If you have an older version, you'll probably find the templates in /Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/File Templates instead.\n", "Q: restart hot corners On Snow Leopard (latest version, but it's been happening for a while), I have the top right corner set to show Spaces, and the bottom right to show the Desktop. Occasionally, often enough to be annoying, and without any reason I can discern, these hot corners stop working. I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*changing the action of the hot corners, mouse in (nothing happens), then change back\n\n*turning off Spaces and turning it back on\n\n*toggling the Spaces icon in the menu bar (worth a shot, right?)\n\n*killall Finder\n\n*killall Dock\n\n*killall SystemUIServer\nNone of these work. If I close the MacBook to suspend it, then bring it back up, that fixes the problem, but is less than ideal if I have, e.g. a big download going.\nIs there a way to quickly (i.e. not log out/log in, not restart) fix the hot corners? Is there some special program I don't recognize in the System Monitor that will restart the hot corners if killed? Is there something that suspend recycles that I can recycle without suspending?\n\nA: Have you tried restarting SystemUIServer? (killall SystemUIServer) When something like his is happening and restarting the Dock doesn't help, SystemUIServer is the next one to try.\n\nA: It happened again, and I tried simply closing the MacBook, waiting a couple of seconds, and reopening. Maybe it was a fluke, but it worked. I'll wait and see if it fixes the problem a second time to make sure that it really did something.\nThis answer is less than ideal, e.g., if I'm in the middle of a big download, so I'd like to wait and see if this answer can help towards a better solution. What does suspend trigger that I could do without suspending?\n\nA: Can you check in Mission Control if Hot corners are undefined? My Keynote crashed, and a consequence of this was, that the Hot corners have all been undefined in Mission Control.\n", "Q: Alternatives to Geektool that make desktop content clickable? Does anybody know of any alternatives to GeekTool that allow you to put content on your desktop sourced from shell scripts, files, etc but that makes the content interactive? \nA few use cases I would really like:\n\n\n*\n\n*A list of recent tweets where any links in the tweets are clickable\n\n*A calendar widget that allows me to navigate forward and back in months\n\n*A search box for google or wikipedia\n\n*An app launcher\n\n\nI know you could use Dashboard widgets for this but I prefer to have these right on the desktop itself. Also Dashboard widgets seem more limited in what they're able to do, but I'm less educated about these so I could be wrong.\nRainmeter does all this by the way, but is Windows only.\n\nA: You could use Ubersicht. It shows contents as widgets on desktop. Widgets are configured through coffee or js scripts. You could also other scripting languages like python, shell etc.  These widgets are interactive through optional keys.\nThere are already a handful of widgets are available. More details regarding the project can be found at their github.\n\nA: Yahoo! Widgets has a mac version available, and a quick search shows an application launcher, twitter client, a month calendar, and a wikipedia and google search box.\nIf you want to use dashboard widgets, this software claims to make your dashboard widgets stay on the desktop. It does cost money, but they have a free trial available.\n", "Q: How can I restore the smooth surface of my iPhone? The iPhone has a touchscreen with a slippery surface which is important as the user can slide his/her fingers easily.\nThe touchscreen's surface of my one year old iPhone has become rough.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I restore the smooth surface of my iPhone?\n\n*Can you recommend lubricants that restore the slippery surface of the touchscreen?\n\n\nA: Any surface preparation you apply will not stay on there long, and may well be just as annoying as it rubs off on your clothing etc.  Most of the lubricants I have seen used (often for ski/snowboard prep etc) are nasty horrible things that are designed to impregnate the surface to allow for low friction.  There is no way you can ever impregnate the glass, so this techniques are doomed to failure.  Also, I would be careful with what you apply too, as you may damage the oleophobic coating that is on the glass as standard.\nI would recommend simply washing the glass with a very mild detergent, and then wiping clean with a lint free cloth.  If your glass remains rough to the touch after this, then it is likely a permanent feature caused by excessive wear, and cannot be rectified.\n\nA: If you have oily skin or acne or any kind of oil, just the teeniest bit of oil and rub it on your skin. I have an oily forehead, so I just wipe my thumb across and rub that there. Sounds kind of odd but it works for me.\n\nA: For my iPhone 3G, I used a Power Support Anti-Glare Film Set. One of my favorite things about it was how it let your finger slide across the screen with way less friction than the original screen does. \nEven when my iPhone 4 was brand new, it never had the same glide to it that my iPhone 3G had with the Power Support film. I almost never had to wipe the film on my 3G to retain that frictionless feeling (it was just always there), but with my iPhone 4 (with no film) there are many times where I would need to wipe the screen to eliminate some of the friction, only to have it return after a few minutes of use.\nSo if you are looking for a way to make your finger glide across the screen, I would definitely recommend using a screen protector. Although, I haven't tried any for the iPhone 4/4S, so I can't recommend any specifically.\n", "Q: AppleCare package and MacBook It has been a week since I purchased my MacBook, and I don't have any money at the moment to purchase the AppleCare package. \nIs there any possibility for me to purchase it in 8 months? Will I then get the 3 year warranty from the original date I purchased the MacBook, or from the date I purchased the AppleCare package?\n\nA: Apple provides a standard warranty of one year on all the products they sell. You may purchase AppleCare any time within that one year period to extend your coverage, which for Macs is two additional years, for a total of three. The total coverage period begins from the date of purchase of your MacBook.\nWaiting to buy it means you have money in your pocket, but go without phone support once your 90 day complimentary support expires. Your coverage is pinned to the date of purchase of the Mac - not of the plan. Also, Apple offers a pro-rated refund if you wish to cancel the plan before it's term is due. This is handy when you sell and the buyer doesn't want that protection or something like a loss or uncovered accident means you don't want to repair the out of warranty issues to benefit from the plan going forward.\nThis is the route I tend to do, as I never need phone support, and the cost of AppleCare is usually around $200 more. Of course, you run the risk of forgetting and not getting it, as I have done on more than one occasion.\n", "Q: Best way of sharing files over network with linux I have an iMac running Mac OS 10.7.3 which is connected to wifi network, there is also a linux laptop connected to the same network. I want to share a folder with this laptop, I cannot use ftp since it was removed from system preferences. I don't want to share everything, so remote login is not option, unless there are settings to restrict it, so what is the best way of sharing this folder?\n\nA: Simply use the File Sharing option in the System Preferences.\nIt will give you the option to share using AFP or SMB, both of which are supported in Linux.\nYou didn't specify which Linux distribution you are using specifically, but most graphical distributions such as Ubuntu have SMB support out of the box (just go to Places->Network and find your share). AFP support can be obtained by installing afpfs-ng.\n\nA: In addition to AFP, and SMB, both of which are reasonably non-unixy, you can also use NFS.\nAFP also has issues in Lion with other OSs using netatalk libraries.\nNFS is very well supported on Linux.\nSee this for a comparison: NFS, AFP, SMB... Advantages and drawbacks on a Mac OS system\n", "Q: Where can I purchase repair parts for Apple products? I have an old iMac G4 that's well beyond being supported in any capacity by Apple. Two years ago, when taking it apart to upgrade the hard drive and CD drive, I accidentally severed the connector on the logic board for the display. At the time, I looked around to see if I could find somewhere I could purchase a replacement logic board, but pretty much the only place I found were some people selling them on eBay from unknown origins for wildly varying prices. I ended up dropping the matter, as I didn't have a need for the machine anymore, but it got me thinking:\nWhere can I purchase repair parts for Apple products? Presumably the Apple Certified Repair shops have a supplier - do their parts come directly from Apple? Can a \"regular person\" like me obtain parts directly from Apple as well? If not, are there any certified repair places that are willing to resell the parts they have access to? Or is eBay, with parts from who-knows-where, the only option?\n\nA: iFixit has manuals online as well as the parts needed. I've bought and replaced a number of parts from them and their instructions are top notch.\neBay sometimes, but, as you know, that's your own risk.\n\nA: The Times They Are a-Changin'\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/self-service-repair\n\n*https://selfservicerepair.com/home\nApple now publishes detailed repair manuals for iOS devices and soon Apple Silicon Macs will have these documents widely available. Apple will sell parts and rent tools as well for DIY repairs.\nYou can still use authorized repair partners, first party AppleCare repair staff or choose anyone else you trust to do the work.\n\n*\n\n*https://locate.apple.com\nSome will revel in the right to repair, learn and perhaps start a career. Others will discover the right to despair, when they get in over their head or break some part that even trained technicians will break (but the good ones learn fast and make up for extra part costs early in their career by doing many profitable repairs over their span of being a professional fix it person).\nApple resellers are allowed to both perform repairs where the broken part goes back to Apple and just sell you a part. It’s not clear yet how the DIY parts pricing will encourage or discourage others from reselling parts.  I believe their costs are way higher for the costs of an \"one way part\" so in practice, this does not happen much on major components that are not commodity parts.\nIn your particular instance, I would look to see when that specific model goes vintage. Presumably, Apple would then sell their stock of parts to the repair centers and for a limited time, there might be a nice supply (prices low) and no risk to the people carrying the part that their costs to carry inventory will raise the price of that part.\nEven from reputable sellers, many parts that exist on the open market are scavenged from machines that are damaged (sometimes by liquid) and disassembled for parts and carry only a short warranty if any from the seller.\nThis is a good thing in almost all cases - reusing perfectly fine parts when they are properly tested is inexpensive and proper. The flip side, is what machines get damaged and don't get fixed? The worst kind of damage.\nAn iMac is very much not at risk from liquid but other things like power surge, can affect parts in an invisible way.  Again, the question is of self-selecting. Which macs don't get cheap parts to fix the issues they have? The ones with major problems to either the display or the logic board.\nFor these reasons, I prefer to buy parts from a company I trust to know why a used mac isn't getting fixed so I can get good parts from them. Similarly, I'll gladly buy the damaged mac from the person that wants to sell it for parts so I can evaluate the damage myself. They are usually forthcoming why and how it got damaged  ( and also pricing my offer knowing it may be a total waste.)\nAs always, finding a good mechanic - someone who knows the business and has experience with hundreds of repairs on your specific model and thousands of repairs under the belt is more important to knowing when parts can be used.\nFor the last two decades, specialized and highly reliable parts outside of Apple's supply chain are too expensive to be widely available. It used to be hard for consumers to know if a good price is a lucky break or the seller has more information of the part's heritage and passing on hidden risk to the buyer. Hopefully these new DIY options help everyone make good choices and repair their gear for as long as it can be serviceable.\n\nA: Rang several Apple stores to buy a screen for iPhone 4. None would sell parts, but all offered repair services. One quote was $179. Eventually I found a private repairer who did the job for $80.\n", "Q: What sets the language of iCal invitations?

Is there a way to hover over content in a web page when viewing it in Safari in the iPad? Specifically, I was trying to hover over the individual avatars at Ask Different iPad Contest home page. On a Mac or PC, it shows when the individual completed their level on hovering, but I couldn't get to see that in the iPad.\n\nA: A (very) brief tap on an image that has a link with a:hover property activates that a:hover experience. A longer tap follows the <a> link. \nUnfortunately, this behaviour is not seen with the <acronym> tag, which in desktop browsers act similar to :hover.\nHere is a less-than-perfect example, tested on iPhone.\n\nA: No, there’s no way of doing that on a touch device. There’s no way for your iPad to detect your finger is hovering over the its screen :) (Although technically this is perfectly possible, and it could in theory be added to a future iPad model.)\nYou could use JavaScript to show the title attribute values of the image links on http://thenewipadishere.com/ though:\n[].forEach.call(document.images, function(element) {\n  var span = document.createElement('span');\n  span.innerText = element.title;\n  element.parentNode.insertBefore(span, element);\n});\n\nIn bookmarklet form: \njavascript:[].forEach.call(document.images,function(b){var a=document.createElement(\"span\");a.innerText=b.title;b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)});\n\nCopy and paste that and add it as a bookmark on your iOS device of choice.

Just think hard before assuming there's a simple way to design for touch than depends on simulated mouseover events.\n\nA: Try Puffin web browser for the iPad.

I'm getting used to working on a MacBook Air this week and find myself wondering if I can systematically change the default system shortcuts to use the power button as a direct substitution for the shortcuts that employed the eject key on previous keyboards.\nI figure there is a really good reason why Apple didn't just enable this by default, but it would be nice to use the one such combination that I am most familiar with:\ncontrol + shift + eject which shuts off the main display immediately\nAn answer that addresses this one issue narrowly would be great if there is a longer wait for a more general, comprehensive answer.\n\nA: The most comprehensive package for remapping the keyboard is KeyRemap4MacBook.\nIt's a bit complex, but will allow you to do almost anything.\n\nA: It has been possible to substitute the power key for eject since 10.8. It also works with MacBook Pros and other shortcuts like ⌥⌘⏏.\n", "Q: How do I fix Terminal.app when my shell has been set to an illegal value? Today I was mucking about trying to uninstall macports when I noticed an error being thrown up whenever I used sudo. I killed Terminal and tried to restart it which failed with the error message \"You're are not authorized to run this application\" and \"The administrator has set your shell to an illegal value.\" How can I fix this?\n\nA: \n…I'd already resolved the issue using Disk Utility to repair permissions…\n\nIf repairing permissions clears up the problem, the cause is (almost certainly) that the permissions of /etc/shells were incorrect, preventing Terminal from reading it.\n/etc/shells contains a list of valid shell programs, and Terminal checks to see whether the shell for your user account is listed. If not, it produces the “illegal shell” message. If it can’t read the /etc/shells file due to permission issues, it also produces this message.\nMore rarely, some people have encountered this problem when the /etc/shells file was somehow altered so that it is empty, in which case you’ll need to restore its contents by copying it from a good system, or with a Time Machine restore, etc.\nTo answer your original question:\nIf Terminal complains about an “illegal shell” it means that the shell for your user account was not found in /etc/shells.\nYou can see which shells are considered valid with cat /etc/shells.\nYou can check which shell your user account is set to use with echo $SHELL, or by reading the user information with dscl . -read \"/Users/$LOGNAME\" UserShell. Or you can use System Preferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences and go to Users & Groups.\n\n*Click on the lock and enter your password to be able to read/set user settings.\n\n*Control-Click (or Right-Click) on your user to get a contextual menu and choose Advanced Options….\n\n\nThe Advanced Options sheet displays detailed user account information including the shell pathname. You can also use this to edit the shell pathname to re-enable logins if it has been set to a value not listed in /etc/shells.\n\nA: If you are getting some strange error messages in your Terminal windows when they first open, that likely indicates a problem with your Terminal preferences. Try removing (or just renaming) the Terminal preferences file (~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist) and then restarting the Terminal application. (Source)\nIf you still have a problem, then look at what you have in your shell dot files: ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bashrc, and the like. If you can’t figure out what the problem is, try removing (or just renaming) those dotfiles.\nAnother place to look for problems is the default.term file under ~/Library/Application Support/Terminal. This is the file that stores the default settings for Terminal windows.\nIf all that fails, use Disk Utility to repair the permissions for Terminal. (Source)\n\nA: I use zsh, while in the settings don't know why $SHELL is set to /usr/local/bin/zsh, then I changed it to /bin/zsh, problem resolved.  In my case, repair permissions or other approaches above didn't help.  But, thanks anyway.\n\nA: I got the same error after I ran chsh and made a typo in the path for the login shell.\nI wasn't able to open Terminal, and nothing happened when I tried to show the advanced options sheet in the Users & Groups preference pane. I was able to run chsh -s /bin/bash in iTerm 2 though.\nYou can also change the default login shell with dscl or edit /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/$USER.plist directly.\n\nA: For me, I received this error because of a chsh typo as well. I use homebrew and (very stupidly) set my shell to the binary in /usr/local/Cellar rather than the dynamic link in /usr/local/bin. As a result Terminal gagged but surprisingly, iTerm did not. This thread was quite helpful for fixing my problem.\nTo prevent my problem: if you use homebrew, ALWAYS reference the dynamically linked binaries in /usr/local/bin, for these will always be kept up to date. \n", "Q: Why can't Siri add the relationship for an account? I'm using Siri in German, and one of the examples mentions the command:\n\nMeine Mutter ist Diana Pelzl\n\nThat is, My mother is Diana Pelzl. So, I say something similar to the above German sentence, and Siri comes up with:\n\nOkay, should I remember that Diana Pelzl is your Mother?\n\nOf course, I tap Yes. Now, Siri replies:\n\nSorry, I can't add the relationship for this account.\n\nWhy would it say so? \n\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS 5.1\n\n*Contacts are currently synced with Google through an Exchange account, following the procedure here: Setting up Google Sync with your iOS device - Google Mobile Help\n\nA: I had the same problem, hopefully your problem is occurring for the same reason, and the following solution will help you.\nStep 1: Make sure you have set up iCloud for your iPhone, which I am sure you have.\nStep 2: Go to Settings>iCloud and turn off Contacts. If you are experiencing the same problem I had (i.e. no iCloud contacts set up) it will not matter if you delete or save when prompted, that is up to you.\nStep 3: Delete the current contact that is assigned to your iPhone/Siri (this will also remove it under \"My Info\" in the Siri settings).\nStep 4: Go to iCloud.com on a computer, log in, and select Contacts. Now press the + button on the bottom right of the first \"page,\" and create a contact with your name/information.\nStep 5: Once created, select your contact, press the Settings button on the bottom left, and choose Make this my card.\nStep 6: On your iPhone again, return to Settings>iCloud and turn Contacts back on, selecting merge when prompted.\nStep 7: Go to Settings>Mail, Contacts, Calenders; scroll down to the section under the Contacts heading, select Default Account and choose iCloud.\nStep 8: Return to your contacts.\na) if your name is already there (matching the one you created at iCloud.com). Select it and look under the Linked Cards heading, to make sure that there is a link to your iCloud contact. Also, check under Settings>General>Siri to make sure that it has the the contact in the My info box.\nb) if it is not there, create a new contact, and enter your first and last name exactly as it is entered in iCloud (it is not necessary to provide information beyond your first and last name). Now press done, and you should see your iCloud account appear below the Linked Cards heading. Select the iCloud account and you can make changes to the contact from your phone, including adding relationships that will work with Siri (e.g. Mother, Father, Brother, etc.). You should also be able to use Siri as you have tried in the past, but only got the \"I can't add that relationship to this account\" response.\nOptional Step 9: If it still does not work, you may want to try using this process to add your important \"relations\" contacts to your Contacts List via iCloud.com, and adding the relationships to you contact on iCloud.com as well.\nI hope this helps! Good luck!\n\nA: I solved this problem by activating the synchronisation of the contacts with iCloud in addition to Exchange.\n\nA: Siri does not work well with Exchange, maybe even not at all. But I know that for example Siri Reminders also do not work if you have synced them with Exchange, because Exchange does only know Tasks, not Reminders on top.\nFor the address book I remember that Exchange cards only support 3 addresses, while iCloud addresses support more which you might need for Siri to define other addresses at which Siri should remind you of something (a.k.a. geo-fences).\nSo I am almost sure that it has something to do with your Exchange account, possibly their cards don't support relationships? Or Siri has just not been trained to change the content of Exchange cards? \n\nA: Syncing Google Contacts via CardDAV will allow you to store the relationship information in your address book entry.  See iOS: Syncing with Google Contacts for instructions.\n\nA: You can add a contact containing only the first and last name of your mother to the iCloud account. This contact will automatically be linked to the 'real' contact and Siri can store its/her additional information in the iCloud which makes things like \"Call my mother\", \"mail my girlfriend\" possible even with Exchange / Google / ... acounts.\n\nA: These instructions for Syncing google with your device are quite outdated, you should look at syncing itunes with your google account, in which case you no longer have to run an exchange account. This can be done in the info tab once you plug your phone in to iTunes.\n", "Q: Does the AppleTV had a place where I can see what's been downloaded to the device? I've been looking through the user interface of the 2012 AppleTV and I can't find a place to see what has been downloaded to the device (e.g. movies or TV shows)--or the progress in-process downloads. I just purchased a season of a TV show and I want to see how many of the episodes have downloaded and to make sure they're downloading, without actually going to watch a show and see what the scrubber bar says.\n\nA: Nope, the latest versions of the AppleTV have 8GB of storage however the device doesn't allow the user to view or modify anything about the status storage (at least in a stock state).\nDuring the introduction of the first all black AppleTV Steve Jobs said,\n\nPeople don't want to think about managing storage, they just want to watch movies and TV shows.\n\n", "Q: Keyboard Not Working in Bootcamp I just installed Bootcamp and Windows 7 on my MacBook Pro (13 inch, 2010), and booted into the OS. The keyboard and mouse worked fine, but because there were no drivers, things like multitouch and the two-finger mouse click didn't work - this is as expected.\nI went back into OS X Lion and downloaded the Windows Support package to my thumb drive, rebooted, and installed the driver package and the Boot Camp Control Panel. After I had restarted, my keyboard wasn't working. \nThe weird thing is, the F-keys do work and function correctly (brightness, volume, etc). If I change those keys to perform the F-key functions in the control panel (ie. require holding Fn+F1 to change brightness), the F-keys work correctly.\nAny of the keys below the F-key row do not work at all. They don't type anything, no matter what program I am in. The Caps Lock key does light up when I toggle it on and off.\nI've tried going into the Device Manager and uninstalling the Keyboard driver and then scanning for hardware changes (which reinstalls the Apple Keyboard driver), I've uninstalled and deleted the driver (and then reinstalled it from the package in the WindowsSupport folder), and nothing is working.

I just captured a video with my new iPad, then used the iPad's built-in tools to upload it to youtube.  I selected \"high quality\" but it appears to be only a 720p video on youtube (caution: kids and baby chicks herein).\nIs there a way to upload a 1080p video from the iPad to Youtube?\n\nA: Did you try the YouTube iOS app? You may need to change a few settings first, but I believe the YouTube app supports full quality videos - including 4K. Apple's built-in uploader from the share menu doesn't work that well.\nIn the YouTube iOS app, click your user image, then on the window that slides up, select Settings. Scroll down to uploads and confirm that full quality is selected for upload quality. Press the X on the top left to return to the main part of the app.\nYou may now press the camera button (next to the search button) on the top bar. It will ask for appropriate permissions. Try uploading from there and see if it works for you.\n\n(I just tested this method and can confirm HD+ resolutions - also, I just noticed that this was a really necro'd post.)\n\nA: Youtube Capture used to do just that perfectly. Joins videos with minimal re-encoding. Though:\n\n\n*\n\n*It crashes a lot on iOS 10.\n\n*It won't run on iOS 11.\n\n\nWould love to find a free alternative. So far, I tried free editors that pop up in a search, but each one I tried was horrible.\nupdate: YouTube itself can now do it, so @drivec's answer should do it.

I've gotten so used to the Lion natural scrolling that using (for lack of a better term) unnatural scrolling in Snow Leopard and earlier is very annoying. Is there any way I can reverse it for OSes before Lion?\n\nA: Yes you can, with Scroll Reverser. It's a free app that sits in your menu bar (you can hide it if you want). It works all the way back to OS X Tiger.\n\n", "Q: Where does Mac OS X or Safari remember which application to use for Gopher sites? When I try to access a Gopher site in Safari it opens OmniWeb to open the site. Where does Mac OS X or Safari store which application to use for Gopher sites? (I assume Safari doesn't support Gopher itself?)\n\nA: I'm guessing Safari uses Launch Services, which means it uses the system's default handler for that URL. These settings are stored in the file $HOME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist. You can edit this using the defaults command in Terminal, or using a plain text editor if it is in the XML format.\n", "Q: How do I insert a picture into the Notes app? I use the Notes app for keeping track and sharing the extended notes with fellow physicians in cardiology studies. There are a lot of pros to this app and I would find it very much useful if I could insert pictures into specific areas within Notes. (a video would make it even better). How is it possible to customize this for a such purpose and is there an alternative to this solution?\n\nA: The iOS Notes app is not able to insert pictures. At best it will paste a url to an image. \nI suggest you use another note app such as Evernote or Notability.\n\nA: You could just wait for the next iPhone update. While it's not guaranteed to have the ability to add photos, I believe it's likely that it will have the ability to do so. That's because one of the new features in Mountain Lion is a Notes app which synchronizes with iCloud, and one of it's features is adding pictures to notes:\n\nNotes in OS X Mountain Lion is designed for whatever’s on your mind. Think it up. Jot it down. Make it even more noteworthy with photos, images, and attachments.\n\n\n\nA: That was one of the things I also noticed and found a bit strange - therefore, I developed the app My Photo Note.\nYou can let the app set a link of your photo note into the iPhone calendar - tapping the link will open up the photo note in My Photo Note.\nMy Photo Note is also not free ($1.99 for the full version), but you can try the lite version for free: My Photo Note\n\nA: You cannot add pictures to the Notes app at present. NoteMaster is a paid app that lets you add images and make pretty notes easily. Some of the other features include:\n\n\n*\n\n*rich text\n\n*sync with Google docs\n\n*create and manage lists & to-dos\n\n\nIt isn't free though, and costs $3.99. \n\nThere are a bazillion note-taking apps out there that are better than the default — it's almost like the \"Hello world\" of apps, and this article reviews 100 of them!\n\nA: iLA is a brilliant tool designed for notes, project planning, deep learning, collaborating , brainstorming and the like. Of course you can insert pictures in card, make notes to card, create stack from cards (categorizing), and make a desktop of one topic.

I was deleting Skype from my login items and noticed that iTunesHelper showed a warning under a unmarked column. What does it mean and how do I fix it?\n\n\nA: The yellow warning sign means that the login item can no longer be found, most likely because the application was deleted or moved after it was added to the login items. If you hover your cursor over the triangle, it will tell you:\n\nTo re-add iTunesHelper:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find iTunes in /Applications\n\n*Right-click on it, and select \"Show Package Contents\".\n\n*Navigate into Contents, and then MacOS\n\n*Drag iTunesHelper into your Login Items in System Preferences\n\n*Check \"Hide\" to hide it on launch (this may not be necessary, but it's how iTunes sets it up)\n\n\nA: In High Sierra, it's often a permissions problem (e.g., Fastscripts tries to add itself, which is somehow not allowed). If you know where to find the application, delete the one with the warning and drag in a new one manually.\n", "Q: Mac Pro 2008 OS X 10.6.8 random restarts, grinding HDD So I've had my Mac Pro since 2008. I currently have OS 10.6.8 on it. In the last week, it has restarted itself twice while I was in the other room. Since I wasn't there, I don't know if there were any messages. This has never happened before.\nWhen this happens, it takes quite a few hours before it will operate normally without grinding the hard disk for a minute or more at a time. Most applications freeze or become very unresponsive while it does this.\nThe disk is a 320 GB drive, and there are 42 GB free still. I've done a DiskUtility Verify Disk on it, and it says everything looks normal.\nIs this some issue that has a common cause, or do I need to take it in to the shop?\n\nA: Grinding is a hard drive's way to remind you to be really protective of your drive containing the most up to date backup of your data.\nHere is a fabulous app that educates you on what each failure mode might sound like.\n\n\n*\n\n*Drive Saver app for iOS.\n\n\nA: The restarts were only when waking from sleep; must have been from network access waking or something.

It always adds it to my work (Exchange) address book.\nHow do I select which address book I to create a new contact in? Alternatively (and less preferably) how can I move the contact after-the-fact from one address book to the other.\nI'm not interested in solutions that involve having to sync with my mac every time, using iCloud, Google Mail or anything that I have to pay for.\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no built-in way to do this. However, there are some third-party apps that fill this gap. A free one that I've tested and works is OrbiContacts. The interface isn't especially pretty, but it does work.\n", "Q: Do the three iPad personal hotspot tethering options differ in terms of speed? I am delighted with LTE tethering on the new iPad with personal hotspot.\nWhat are the speed ramifications of selecting Wi-Fi over Bluetooth or connecting via USB and the dock connector?\n\nA: USB is probably the fastest, with a theoretical peak transfer rate of 480 Mbit/s, and will also charge the device (or, at least, prevent it from discharging as quickly). The downside is that only one device can be connected via this method.\nBluetooth is probably the slowest (Bluetooth v3.0 + HS is rated for 24 Mbit/s), but I'd expect it to use less power than WiFi tethering. Bluetooth is also limited to connecting to one device at a time.\nWiFi tethering will support more than one device (usually three or five or more) and can be faster than Bluetooth, but uses more power. 802.11g is rated for 54 Mbit/s and 802.11n is supposed to reach 150 Mbit/s, but this is usually shared between all connected devices. \nDespite the single-device limit, USB and Bluetooth connections can, if made with a PC or Mac, \"forward\" the connection over WiFi (as an ad-hoc hotspot), FireWire, Ethernet, or any other connection protocol the machine supports, allowing a theoretically infinite number of devices to use the cellular connection. Of course, you can also use the USB cable to charge the device while using wireless tethering, and you can use multiple (or all three) tethering modes at the same time. \nIn any case, the limiting factor for speed is likely to be your cellular connection, particularly if you are limited to 3G. Remember, the cell connection is a single pipe that all your connected devices go through, including the iPad itself.\n", "Q: Can't stream iTunes purchased movie from Mac to Apple TV I'm currently running into the infamous \"Authorization is required. To play this content on your Apple TV, choose Authorize This Computer from the Store menu in iTunes on your computer, then enter the Apple ID and password used for the purchase.\" error.\nThis is a well known error, and has caused problems for people in the past.

I haven't tried playing the movie in a week, and I decided to give it one more go. This time, it worked perfectly. There must have been an issue with their authentication servers. Gotta love DRM!\n\nA: All iTunes purchases are authorized to the account holder via your Apple ID. Your Apple ID is important identification and verification that you have been authorized by way of legal purchase to access content available through the iTunes store. \nIn order to play back movies on different devices and computers, they must be \"Authorized\" to play content associated with that Apple ID. Depending on the device and/or how you are accessing the content (computers, devices, iCloud) there are different ways to ensure that your device is associated with the correct Apple ID. \nBe sure to read all of the following article on Apple's website to fully understand how your Apple ID works:\niTunes Store: About authorization and deauthorization\nOn occasion, there are system issues or outages with Apple services.

My MBP mid-2009 is starting to slowly fall apart, so I figured I need a new one. I got an SSD for my current macbook, which has OS and apps installed, etc. \nCan I just insert this system disk into a new macbook and boot from it? What are possible issues (with Windows I'd worry about drivers)? \nOr do I need a migration process of some sort?\nI am on latest Lion and I use Time Machine, if it matters.\n\nA: This might help:\nDoes restoring from Time Machine also restore installed applications?\nWhen you boot up on a fresh install you can run the OS X migration process to restore from Time Machine.\nUnlike Windows you should be fine just restarting from the system disk though. All the necessary drivers are built in.\nIf your new disk has stuff on it, you can boot from it and run Migration Assistant from Utilities to copy your user directory from Time Machine.\nAlso, you should clarify, are you adding an SSD (e.g. into the optical slot) or are you replacing the existing drive? If you're replacing it you'll need a way to copy the data, i.e. from Time Machine.\n", "Q: AppleTV Remote Shortcut to Sleep I have a 2nd gen AppleTV unit.

There you will see an option to view Gmail in \"Desktop\" version.\n", "Q: Why can I no longer open the Security & Privacy pane of System Preferences? Problem\nSince April 2012, one user of my MacBook Pro can no longer load the Security & Privacy pane.\nWhen I click the icon, a sheet drops down:\n\nTranslated from Chinese to English:\n\nError\nCannot load System Preferences pane \"Security & Privacy\".\n\nThis is chaotic for me. Please: what has happened, and how can I fix it?\nI also posted to Apple Support Communities:\n\n*\n\n*Security & Privacy System Preferences pane cannot open!\nEnvironment\nLion, Mac OS X 10.7 -> 10.7.1 -> 10.7.2 -> 10.7.3 (Build 11D50b).\nI setup two users:\n\n*\n\n*zoomq — my own account\n\n*wan — my wife's  account, not often used by her\n\n*zh-CN (PRC Chinese) (Mainland China, simplified characters) preferred for both users\n\n*both are administrators\n\n*install/uninstall software is all standard steps.\n\nTroubleshooting\nUser zoomq can not load the pane.\nSwitch users, wan can open the pane without problem.\nAll other preference panes open and work fine.\nWhen the problem occurs, nothing is logged. I have tried tail -f and all kinds of /var/log .log files.\nI have not touched many system files.\nI try remove\n/Users/zoomq/Library/Preferences/com.apple.se*\ncom.apple.security.plist\ncom.apple.security.revocation.plist\ncom.apple.security.revocation.plist.lockfile\n\nand rebooted, nothing changed.\n$ ls /Library/Preferences/com.apple.se*\ncom.apple.security.appsandbox.plist\ncom.apple.security.plist\ncom.apple.security.systemidentities.plist\ncom.apple.servermgrd.plist\n\nFor wan, ~/Library/Preferences/\ncom.apple.security.* files are not present.\n\nA: Try applying a combo update\nYou might try: \n\n\n*\n\n*download the most recent MacOSXUpdCombo10.7.3.dmg\n\n*log in as zoomq \n\n*prefer British English or British\n\n*install the combination update\n\n*restart the computer, you should find 11D50d or greater \n\n*run Software Update until all other updates are installed\n\n*prefer Chinese (simplified)\n\n*quit System Preferences\n\n*reopen System Preferences, retry the preference pane.\n\n\nBackground\nAt OS X Lion Update 10.7.3 (Client Combo) there is no hint that Apple published different downloads with identical names. Differences between 11D50b, 11D50c and 11D50d are not published by Apple. This situation surrounding 10.7.3 is most unusual.\nGenerally, without focus on 10.7.3: in some problem situations, people find that installation or re-installation using a combo has a positive effect. \nIn this case: the b in your current installation, 11D50b, probably indicates that a combo (combination) update has been applied once already — maybe through the Software Update routines that are integral to OS X. Reapplying the same update, or a more recent build of the same update, should do no harm. \nThere may be more technical ways of investigating causes of your problem. However: because the symptoms are unusual, I am inclined to suggest a combo update before anything else. \n", "Q: App for analyzing installers Is there an app which shows contents of a .pkg file and shows which files an installer copies to my mac, what scripts it runs and so on?\n\nA: You can extract package files and sort through their contents without actually installing them. To do this, you can often just right-click on a .pkg file and select “Show Package Contents” – but that isn’t always displayed.\nIf that option is unavailable, you can extract .pkg files using a command line tool called pkgutil that is bundled with OS X. Launch Terminal.app and enter the following:\npkgutil --expand /path/to/package.pkg /output/destination/\n\nHint: you can drag & drop items into the Terminal to print their full path, making this tip easier by typing: pkgutil –expand [drop file here] /destination/path/.\nAfter that, you can go to the output path in the Finder and check out the extracted files.\nSource\n\nA: Yes, there's a shareware app called Pacifist ($20).  I've used it for years, and it works wonderfully well (even on old Macs). \n\n\nAlternatively, you can download a free QuickLook extension for blazing fast previews of packages.  It's called SuspiciousPackage.\n\n", "Q: Mac not going to sleep after iTunes stops playing Hardware/Software\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro 17\" 2009\n\n*Lion 10.7.3\n\n*iTunes 10.6\n\n\nIssue\nUnlike a lot of posts on the internet, my Mac actually goes to sleep just fine, usually.\nHowever, if iTunes was playing something, and then I either explicitly stop it playing, or the movie/track/playlist comes to an end, it runs down the battery to zero!\nI understand that iTunes doesn't let the Mac go to sleep if it's playing something, but if I explicitly press the stop/pause button, or the media stops playing, shouldn't the Mac go to sleep as per usual?\nAnyway I can diagnose/fix this? is it a known issue?\ncheers!\n\nA: Check if really iTunes is causing this by opening a terminal and entering:\n pmset -g\n\nIf sleep is prevented by a process its ID is listed, like here:\n ...\n sleep      0 (imposed by 129)\n ...\n\nThen check which process blocks going to sleep, in this example:\n ps -A | grep 129\n\n   129 ??        37:39.06 /usr/sbin/coreaudiod\n\nThen try killing (quitting) the process and check if you can send your computer to sleep, and if iTunes is still working. In this example it would be:\n sudo kill -3 129\n\n\nOtherwise you could try re-installing iTunes, and/or repairing your file-premissions in Disk-Utility.\n", "Q: How do I create a menu shortcut which involves the delete key? In Addressbook I want to create a keyboard shortcut for the Menu entry Delete Group using the key combination option-command-delete.\nSo I went to System Preferences --> Keyboard --> Keyboard Shortcuts and added an app-specific shortcut entry for \"Delete Group\". But when I tried to assign the key combination option-command-delete, my input wouldn't get accepted. (Combinations with letter like option-command-D work, though.)\nHow can I enter a shortcut combination involving the delete key?\n\nA: You can edit the property list that stores the shortcuts directly. For example open ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.AddressBook.plist with TextMate or TextWrangler, and add:\n<key>NSUserKeyEquivalents</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>Delete Card</key>\n    <string>~@&#x0008;</string>\n</dict>\n\nThe shortcut strings are documented in http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/Site/Cocoa%20Text%20System.html.\n\nA: Note to self: The answer by Lri works, but the shortcut strings mentioned on the linked Harvard page do not work if you just enter the text in NSUserKeyEquivalents yourself. To get them to work, they have to be entered in the same format that Lri used (&#x0008;), which is apparently \"hexadecimal numeric character reference\" (or \"hex NCR\"), as referenced in the conversion table on this page:\nhttp://www.endmemo.com/unicode/ascii.php\n", "Q: iPhone 4 restore to a replacement phone I recently got a replacement iPhone 4 (under warranty to replace my old iPhone 4), and just before returning the old iPhone 4, I did a backup. When I connect the new phone to my iTunes, it only gives me the option to register the phone and does not offer me an option to restore. My new phone's iOS is 5.0.1; I can't recall if my old phone was on 5.1 or 5.0.1. I'm worried to update the iOS of the new phone to 5.1, in case my old backup wasn't on 5.1. Can a backup done on an older version restore to a new phone on a newer version?\n\nA: You have to register/activate the phone first before you can restore it from backup. Even in case you won't get asked during/after activation, you can always connect your phone to iTunes later and click on Restore.\n", "Q: How can I stop recieving calls? I'm heading out internationally and do not want to drum up a large phone bill by taking calls while I'm away, yet I would like to have the phone to use over WiFi - FaceTime, iMessage etc.\nIs there a way to turn off the phone function while keeping the ability to receive SMS messages?\n\nA: Set call forwarding to forward calls directly to your voice mail or your home number (assuming you have an answering machine). As long as you do this before leaving the country it should not result in huge roaming bills. You will still get SMS though, and data roaming may cost a lot as well.\n", "Q: Run x11 app from dock I have an app in /usr/local/bin directory and can not drag it onto the dock and have to open Terminal everytime I want to run this program.\nIs it possible to run a macported/homebrewed application from the Dock?\n\nA: You should be able to do this using AppleScript, saving the script you create as an application, then dragging it to the dock.\nFor example, if you start the Apple Script Editor (/Applications/Utilities/Apple Script Editor.app). Then type something like the following, replacing my trivial example of /bin/date with the command you want to run\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    do script \"/bin/date\"\n end tell\n\nor\ndo shell script \"/bin/date\"\n\nEither script should work, but the first explicitly opens the Terminal - it just depends on the application you want to run and whether it sticks around. \nThen save this script as an application (use the dropdown in the save dialog to change the \"File Format\" to \"Application\"). \n\nYou should then be able to drag the .app file you created to the Dock and run it.\n", "Q: How to search by image from the iPad? Google only allows image search from the camera directly (and not the gallery), but doesn't allow iPad users to search by uploading an existing image or typing a specific URL. \nHow can I search by image from an iPad?\n\nA: When you're on the Google Images page scroll all the way to the bottom. There is a choice there to use either Google Tablet or Classic (defaults to tablet on the iPad). Click on classic and you should get the same options as on your mac/pc.\n\n\nA: If you don't mind installing and using Google Chrome browser, you can tap-hold on any image and the \"search google for this image\" link is right there.

You'll have the camera icon like on your desktop browser.\n\nA: I would recommend http://searchbyimages.com is a reverse image search engine. Search by image: Give it an image and it will tell you where the image appears on the web.\n\nA: You could use \"Image Web Search\" from the App Store. Here's a link to it.\n\nA: Download the app Puffin Free and go to Google.ca, then go to images. The camera should be beside the microphone.\n", "Q: Why does the desktop Hard drive icon keep moving? Every time I log in to one specific account on my mac the hard drive icon, usually in the top right, has moved to the top left and is partly off of the screen. Even when I drag it back to the right it has moved on the next start up.

I have made a bootable backup of my mac on an external drive using superduper. Is it possible to make this backup secure? Either by encrypting the backup or adding a password to it? \n\nA: What you can do is make an encrypted disk images on your external hard drive. You can see this image as a extra external drive upon your external drive. \nIf you make it large enough (like 500GB or more depending on the size of your external drive).\nYou can give the disk image a password (Choose 128-bit AES (and/or 256-bit AES)) and whenever you want to access the disk image, you'll be asked for the password.\nIn this way, there is a save way to protect your backups with a strong password.\n", "Q: Are TimeMachine backups password protected? If someone was to steal my external hard drive would they need to input my password to be able to read the TimeMachine backup data on there?\n\nA: Not by default.\nBy default Time Machine Backups are not encrypted. They are stored in a sparse bundle disk image with the name of the computer which the backup is from. You can open this image and browse it without a password.\nYou can easily enable encryption for Time Machine backups if they are connected via USB/Firewire. It's more complicated if you access your backup disk using ethernet/Wi-Fi. How can I enable encryption for my Time Machine backup?\n", "Q: Intel EFI shell on Mac I would like to try Intel's EFI shell.\nHow can I (build and) install EFI Shell on Mac? I've seen prebuilt binary, but I'd like do build it myself and I don't trust stuff from file-sharing sites. \nThere is EDK but isn't it for Windows only or maybe I can built it on OSX somehow?\n\nA: If you are still looking for an answer I found one on Stack Overflow:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/777437/sopen-s-firmware-console-on-mac-osx-intel\nIt does not seem possible to do this.  \nThe only thing you can install to get some kind of EFI boot menu options menu is rEFIt, which can be found here: \nhttp://refit.sourceforge.net\nI know it isn't the answer you were probably looking for but I hope that this answer at least helps you out.\n", "Q: What are the advantages of formatting an external disk as journaled HFS+? The application Disk Utility /Library/Utilites/Disk Utility.app which is part of the applications that ship with the Mac OS allows to reformat an external disk.\nOptions include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS Extended (Journaled) (journaled HFS+)\n\n*Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled)\n\n*MS-DOS (FAT)\n\n*ExFAT\n\n\nI'm aware that using the MS-DOS (FAT) format offers the good compatibility when sharing the flash drive with Windows users. But for this question I want to rule out compatibility preferences of the different options.\nWhat are the advantages of formatting an external disk as journaled HFS+?\n\nA: When choosing file system format, one needs to consider expected usage. SD cards are much more sensitive to write operations than traditional hard drives. A journaled file system adds additional layer of writes on top of the data itself, which reduces the life span of the drive.\nTherefore, for mostly static storage (music, apps, books) where writes are few and reads from the device are the major activity, ExFAT is the right choice. If you use the card for DB or other constantly updating critical storage, be prepared to take the hit of shorter life span and format the card using HFS+ called Mac OS Extended (Journaled) in Disk Utility.\n\nA: Taking aside the part that says which OS a particular filesystem is associated with, the main point is the word \"journaled\".\nI include the following Wikipedia quote as there is no point re-inventing the wheel:\n\nA journaling file system is a file system that keeps track of the\n  changes that will be made in a journal (usually a circular log in a\n  dedicated area of the file system) before committing them to the main\n  file system. In the event of a system crash or power failure, such\n  file systems are quicker to bring back online and less likely to\n  become corrupted.\n\nTaking that to one logical end, an external drive is by definition more likely to be removed from the system than an internal drive.  It's not possible to remove your laptop drive and keep the OS running, but perfectly possible with something USB or Firewire attached for example.  As such you run a greater risk of changes that need to be written to the drive failing to complete should you remove the drive too quickly, or without following the correct eject procedures.\nParticularly if you use any form of caching, the data may be waiting to be written to the disk at the point of removal, thus losing your data.\nA journaled filesystem helps to prevent too much damage in these scenarios by keeping a log of all changes it needs to apply, and noting when they are successfully completed.  In this way it can examine the log on a restart and work out of there are outstanding changes that were never completed.  This is far faster than simply running a chkdsk or similar command to check the entire filesystem for problems which you would need to perform on a FAT32 file system.\nIn addition to the protective side of things discussed above, is the fact that a HFS filesystem has all the Mac OS X hooks built in for automated indexing, backup, version control and so on that would not be possible on a FAT32 enabled filesystem.\n\nA: I format my external disks as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) if I plan to use it with OS X as journaling reduces change of drive filesystem corruption if something unexpected happens when I'm writing data to that external disk, for e.g.\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X hibernates\n\n*A/C power cuts off to a Mac desktop\n\n*a Mac laptop battery drops to 0 power\n\n*laptop HDD went to sleep in response to it being dropped\n\n*accidentally disconnect the external drives\n\n\nIf I plan to use the external disks with Windows, then I'll format as ExFAT.\n", "Q: Complete iPad backup software without using iTunes, for Windows?

Perhaps the e-mail configuration, too.\nI have to update an iPad from 4.3.3 to 5.1, without losing any data.\n\nA: You can use iPad to Computer Transfer (ATTENTION: Direct download link). It's an easy tool which allow you to do exactly what you've asked for. Here is an excellent how-to guide.\nAnd if you're looking for a more solid (and more expensive) solution, you can always try iPad Max.\n\nA: If you are searching a tool to fully backup your iPad, iTunes is the best tool.\nBut if you are not going to use iTunes, maybe this iPhone Data Recovery can help which enables you back up all iPhone data on PC. \n", "Q: Removed Facetime - how to recover? So I got this weird situation probably because of my own stupidity. But here goes: I am on Lion (10.7.3) and decided to install FaceTime from the App Store. When trying to install the App Store app says that I need to move current FaceTime.app to trash. When trying to do so the OS says that I cannot remove FaceTime app since it's required by OS. Being confused I open the terminal and go all sudo rm -fr on FaceTime.app. Getting back to App Store I try to install the FaceTime again, but this time I get message saying that MAS version of FaceTime is too old for my OS.\nSo basically my question boils down to - how do I get my FaceTime app back?\n\nA: Getting the FaceTime.app file from your backup or another machine with the same OS version should work.\n\nA: FaceTime is part of the Mac OS since Lion. You should not have had to install this in the first place.\n\n\n*\n\n*The version of FaceTime in the Mac App Store is 1.0.2 and for Snow Leopard (since 10.6.6).\n\n*The version of FaceTime in Lion is 1.1.1.\n(as of march 2012)\nThis explains the warning \"FaceTime is too old for my OS\".\nTry to copy the FaceTime.app package from another Mac.\n\nA: Presume your Trash doesn't have a copy?  There's not a lot you can do without having access to the Lion media.  \nYou should be able to download the whole installer again (Go into the Mac App store, and Option-Click on Purchases tab to get the option back), extract the DMG from the installer package (Right click and Show Package Contents), and then hunt down the bits for Facetime.\nI'm curious why you did what you did, but it's interesting that it let you get that far.\n", "Q: How do I redeem an App Gift from a different App Store? \"This code is only valid for customers of the ___ Store.\" My friend has sent me a gift app from the Singapore App Store whilst I'm on the Australian App store. \nI encounter the following:\n\"This code is only valid for customers of the Singapore Store.\"\nHow do I redeem this? \n\nA: Related to this question.  \nAnd the answer is, gift cards and gift certificates are redeemable only on the iTunes Store for the country for which they were purchased. \n\nA: You can register an iTunes account that uses Singapore App Store, and download from there. \n", "Q: What is a good web browser for OS X 10.4 Tiger? I have an old MacBook that can't run anything higher than 10.4, due to hardware limitations.\nIs there any decent modern browser I can run?  Opera, Safari and Firefox all need at least 10.6.\nI just want websites to work correctly. I am aware that there are security issues and that I should not be running such old software in the first place.\n\nA: TenFourFox gives you the current version of Firefox in builds optimized for G3, G4 and G5 PowerPC processors that runs on Mac OS 10.4 and 10.5.\n\n\nA: You can try camino, which requires Mac OS X 10.4 or later. Just nice for you.\nTheir webpage says they are no longer supporting it though:\n\nAfter a decade-long run, Camino is no longer being developed, and we encourage all users to upgrade to a more modern browser. Camino is increasingly lagging behind the fast pace of changes on the web, and more importantly it is not receiving security updates, making it increasingly unsafe to use.\n\n\nA: I was always a big fan of OmniWeb back in the day. I even paid for it before charging money for a browser was a completely archaic concept. It runs on 10.4.8 or later.\n", "Q: What to do after you lost restriction code on the iPad? I guess the title says it all. I've the restriction code long time ago, and when I wanted to do actuall in-app purchase it turned out I cannot recall the password. Worse, now after 10 tries I have to wait 60 minutes before each consecutive tries.\nThe threads on forums are somehow misleading. Some of them claim the only way is to do fresh install and recover all the stuph manually. Some other people post some not entirely clear solutions involving restore from backup. Closest I got was the iPhoneBackupExtractor tool, which is suppose to read the plain text key code from the iPad backup. It worked to the point of getting hands on com.apple.springboard.plist. Unfortunately the password is not in this file.\nPlease keep in mind, this is about the \"restriction code\", not the main lock code. iPad if fully functional and the one feature blocked is in-app purchase.\n\nA: What amaksoud said is true. I have the original iPad on 4.3.1 and after trying other advice decided to \"read\" the com.apple.springboard.plist. \nHere's how to do it and no need to jailbreak. \nDownload iFunBox; it's free and works for OS X and Windows. Choose Raw File System and navigate to var/mobile/Library/Preferences. Select the file named com.apple.springboard.plist and choose copy to Mac (in my case). Copy the file to your preferred location. \nThen in Finder you select the com.apple.springboard.plist (that you just copied to your Mac) and look for <key>SBParentalControlsPIN</key>. The 4 numbers located between the tag <string> </string> are your Restriction passcode.\nFor example <string>1234</string> means your passcode is 1234.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I'm afraid I have some bad news for you... As you would have guessed (otherwise there would be no point in using restriction codes), there is no easy fix for this issue.\nI found this in the support documents of Apple (on page 196):\n\nIf you forget your passcode, you must restore the iPhone software from\n  iTunes. See “Updating and Restoring iPhone Software” on page 252.\n\nAnd if you restore your iPhone, make sure you don't restore them from a back-up since the restriction code is stored in this backup...\nSo basically, you have quite a dilemma here and you have to choose between maintaining your data and learn to live with the restrictions on one hand, or get rid of the restrictions but start from scratch with your iPhone on the other hand. \n\nA: The following is for iOS pre version 5\nI've read this somewhere and people say it worked for them.\nYou will need a program called iPhone Backup Extractor and you will also need some old backup for your iDevice.\nInstall the program on your machine ( works for mac and windows ) then run it.\nThe program will show you a list of your recent backups, chose the last one and then click on the \"expert mode\" button, it will list files on the back as in windows explorer.\nNavigate to the following path Library/Preferences and then look for the following file\ncom.apple.springboard.plist\nClick on check box to the left of the file then click on extract.\nOpen the extracted file using the iPhone backup extractor-File-view Plsit menu, search for SBParentalControlsPIN parameter and you'll find your PIN next to it.\nRightnow I'm looking for some other work around for iOS 5.x as starting from version 5 this PIN was encrypted and saved to another file named Keychain-backup.plist.\n", "Q: Is it possible to \"window\" fullscreen games?

Any suggestions to what OS X is actually is doing with the drive? I've checked; it's not always Time Machine.\n\nA: This is somehow one of the most frustrating things around for me as well.\nI want to allow my mac to spin down the hard drives when they are idle, but this makes for long delays (on the order of 3-5 seconds normally and on occasion even longer).\nQuite simply, allowing those connected devices to block the fseventsd and other system level daemons means putting up with long delays when you don't really want them.\nYou can and should turn off the sleeping drive to prevent intermittent slowness.\n\n", "Q: Where is the backspace button on a MacBook keyboard?

I need to find a way to output, or possibly make an internal recording of, a screencast of everything on the iPad screen, so that I can record demonstrations of an app my company is developing.\nOf course I could position the iPad on a table with a video camera over my shoulder, but there must be methods available now for providing video output that can be captured by another device, or making an internal screencast.\nI'm not talking about streaming video from within an iPad app for display on an Apple TV or another device. I need to output or record everything on the iPad, and at a sufficiently high frame rate.\nI know there are means of making a screencast from the iPhone Simulator on XCode in Mac OS X, but that does not meet my needs either.\n\nA: Reflector App\nI have purchased and evaluated a newly released program called Reflector App (which runs on your Mac) that does everything I need it to do. It costs US $15 and works using Apple Airplay on your iOS device, so it supports iPad 2, iPad 3, and iPhone 4S. It makes its own QuickTime recordings with audio and video. If you have a good connection with a WiFi N router (such as my Apple Time Capsule) and an Ethernet connection to your Mac, you get a frame rate good enough to record yourself playing Angry Birds, at full iPad screen size. It records audio and video from your iPad.\nThis app is quite new and small updates are being released frequently. The documentation is sketchy but the tech support via email is responsive.\nYou can download a trial version that will only work for 10 minutes total; after that you must pay for the app. It's not available in the Mac App Store and I suspect it won't be. You can purchase it directly from the web site.\n\nA: Based on what you've described, this currently is not possible unless you JailBreak your device. If you're willing to do that, there are a couple options available through Cydia. First, there's ScreenSplitr, which pairs your device with your computer through a program called iDemo and allows you to have real-time iOS demonstrations. If you just want to record a screencast on the actual device, you should use Display Recorder. It does precisely what you're looking for. It records anything that happens on the screen and can save the video to different formats. If you don't want to use the iOS simulator, then I'd suggest you JailBreak which can be reversed.\n\nA: One way to do this is potentially to use AirPlay mirroring.\nAssuming that the App that is being developed supports (or for the purposes of creating the demo can be made to support) Airplay, you can then run a piece of software on a Mac called Airplay Receiver which will allow you to direct the airplay output to your Mac rather than to an Apple TV.  Once this is working, any number of Mac based screen capture programs can be used to record the stream.\nThere may well be a way to use a Mac to record output from the iPad simulator also, but without proper access to those tools I am unsure how to detail this further, although a future answer may be able to comment further so I include the thought anyway.\n\nA: With the new mirroring available since iPad 2, you can use an HDMI recorder to capture screen output of recent iOS devices.  There are many available and can be found via google search for \"hdmi recorder mac\".  There are more (and lower cost) options for Windows computers if you have access to windows machines for this recording session.\nThe HDMI output is generally displayed with black bars at 1080p output over HDMI, so you'll need to use a video editing program to crop to just the 1024x768 portion you'll need.  You won't be able to get the full resolution of the new iPad via any means right now, though eventually jailbreaking and screen capture will become available for the new iPad.\nYou can get just the 1024x768 video data out using the VGA output adaptor, but VGA recording devices appear to be more expensive and less available than HDMI recording devices.\n", "Q: Pages 08 doesn't draw border around paragraphs correctly? If I'm using Pages '08 and trying to draw a border around a paragraph that is inside a text box, I go to the More tab of the Text Inspector and select a solid line and full rectangle under Border and Rules.\n\nThe border that results, however is a top-and-bottom border, and not a full rectangle:\n\nAm I doing something wrong, or is this a known bug? If the latter, is there a workaround so I can enclose a paragraph of text in a text box with a surrounding border?\n\nA: OK, this is a bit kludgy, but it seems to be working (but I'd love to see a better answer!):\nInstead of applying a border to a paragraph, make each paragraph its own text box and apply a border to the entire text box using the Graphic Inspector and setting Stroke to Line.\n\n\nA: Disclaimer: I'm using Pages '09, but I'm guessing the answer will be the same for '08.\nYou're seeing this because the left and right edges of the paragraph are not visible inside the text box. To work around this, you can add a small Inset Margin from the Text tab of the Text Inspector:\n\n\nA: If you open a text box and click inside it as if you are writing in it, then choose style, border, line - you get a border all the way round.\n", "Q: Removing, or minimizing, scratches on the top of a Magic Mouse Though I'm comfortable using either a trackpad or mouse for most tasks, there are some things that I prefer to have the precision of a mouse for. On one such occasion I was traveling with my MacBook, so I decided to toss my Magic Mouse into the bottom of a bag with other loose things. When I took it out, I noticed that the surface got all scuffed up and felt different.\nThe mouse still works, but the scratches annoy me. Is there any way to remove or minimize them? My biggest annoyance is the lack of consistent friction on the surface of the mouse - it makes performing some gestures harder. I'd like to have the entire surface have a consistent level of friction, and, if possible, have it feel like a new Magic Mouse. Is this possible?\n\nA: Ok, so this is based on my experience as a hobbyist woodworker and from fixing up scratches and orange peels on my car. You will need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fine sand paper with grits 600, 800 and a 1000. If your scratches are deeper, you might have to go down to 400, but it would be better if you didn't (don't go below that — will be too hard to recover on plastic). If you'd like a much smoother finish, go up to 2000, but it isn't necessary.\n\n*Buffing compound.\n\n*Buffing cloth with microfibers.\n\n*A can of clear coat spray.\n\n*A steady hand.\n\n\nYou can easily get the first 4 from an auto parts store (e.g., AutoZone in the US). \n\nCaution: This will generate fine dust and the fumes from the spray can cause irritation, so use a dust/vapour mask.\n\nStart with the lowest grit sandpaper and gently sand the roughed up area. Be steady in your strokes and use long strokes instead of short, rapid and jerky motions. Of course, \"long strokes\" is kind of ambiguous in a mouse that's only 4\" long and with a scratch length much smaller than that, but the important thing is to be steady.\nDon't take too much material and don't apply pressure. Let the grit work on the scratch; not your strength. Once it starts getting smoother and you don't see any visible improvement, move higher up in grit. Repeat the same till you finish the highest grit. Remember that the plastic layer isn't very thick and possibly contains sensitive piezos underneath, so do not dwell on each grit for too long.\nWhen you're done, you should see a smooth, matty finish on the surface. If all you want is smoothness and don't care about gloss, I'd say stop here and move to the next paragraph. Else, spray about 2 light coats of clear spray. Sand gently with the highest grit in between coats (allow each coat to dry completely) and wipe with a microfiber cloth before the next coat. If you're worried that an additional film layer might affect the touch sensitiveness, by all means, skip this step.\nFinally, apply the buffing compound and work into the area with a buffing cloth. The compound serves to fill in the ultra fine scratches that the grits won't get and brings out a nice finish to the piece. Use an orbital buffer if you have one, but hand should be sufficient.\nGood luck, and hope that works for you. \n\nDisclaimer: I haven't done this to my Magic Mouse, but I have experience finishing stuff in wood, plastic and metal.\n\n\nA: One thing you might try for a surface like this is one of those CD repair kits where you lightly buff the scratch and then fill it with the special epoxy type solution. I've found many uses for that stuff on other smooth clear surfaces. \n", "Q: Is there a way to interact with Siri Answers? By default, Siri often \"answers\" questions by producing a result from (amongst others) Wolfram Alpha. Often these results leave me wanting to drill down further to expand on parts of the answer provided, but I can find no way to use the answer to allow me to link from it to more complete information elsewhere on the web.\n\nIs there a way to jump from such answers to additional sources of information such as Wikipedia or Google? Is there a way to link from the \"Alpha\" results page that I'm just not seeing?  I'm aware that I can just search Wikipedia or Google from the start; my question is whether the \"Alpha\" results are a dead end.\n\nA: I'm afraid so, since they are just a result of your command. The outcome isn't like a webpage where you can click on and on to obtain more information.\nBut you can still Google or Wikipedia as library in combination with Siri. Whenever you start your command with 'Wikipedia', Siri will search your local Wikipedia for the command you've just said. \nFor example, if you give Siri the command Wikipedia Stack Exchange Siri will search Wikipedia with the Stack Exchange search term:  \n\nSame goes for Google.

I'm a long-time OS X / VIM user and I am wondering if anybody uses Dragon with MacVIM. Googling doesn't seem to turn up any results.\n\nA: The setup in the video is quite impressive.  I imagine that there was a lot of customization necessary to have the software work that way. Dragon Dictate works with vim for inserting text (I just tested this myself), but it doesn't do as well at navigation or editing the text, and it certainly can't do all the fancy code insertion straight out of the box. I imagine that if you have a disability that prevented the use of your hands that you would be motivated to make such an environment work, but I imagine that for normally-abled people it would take more work than it's worth.\n", "Q: Tab not working on Microsoft Word 2011 I'm not sure what's going on here, but whenever I go to a new line, tab doesn't work.  It doesn't work in other lines of the same paragraph either, but if I go back to a previous paragraph, hit tab, delete the tab in that paragraph, and then go down to where I want the tab, it lets me do it.  But then the problem will pop up again in the next paragraph.\nHow can I fix this problem and what is causing it?\nAfter further experimentation, I've found that just clicking into another paragraph and clicking back does the trick, most of the time anyway.\nAfter even more experimentation, I've discovered that by inserting a blank line at the end of the document, I can solve the problem for the most part.  It usually only occurs when I'm trying to put a tab on the last line of a document.  However, this isn't a perfect solution and I'm still having the issue sometimes.\n\nA: I experience the problem of tabs not working when making math tests. The problem is very repeatable, and can be replicated in the following simple experiment:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a new document and set one tab (say a left tab at 3.0 inches). \n\n*Type \"Solve \" and insert a formula, say \"2x=6\". \n\n*Use the right arrow to exit from the formula. \n\n\nYou may now type any non-tab characters that you wish, but hitting the \"tab\" key does not insert a (tab) character.\nTo fix the problem, do any of the following after leaving the formula:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type (spacebar) (left arrow) (tab), OR\n\n*Paste a previously copied (tab), OR \n\n*Click to place the cursor at any point not within the formula, and click to place the cursor at the end of the line. Now type (tab).\n\n\nMy theory is that a flag is set to keep the (tab) character from being used within formulas, and that exiting the formula using the right arrow key does not reset the flag, but clicking outside the formula or backspacing does.\n\nA: It's hard to tell exactly what's going on without seeing the document and Word itself, or maybe screenshots showing the Word window including UI when the problem is occurring, and when the problem is not occurring.  But let me make an informed guess.\nFix the problem by going to the paragraph where the problem occurs. Move the pointer to the blank vertical space just to the left of the text; the pointer will switch to an arrow pointing \"northeast\" (up and to the right). Click in the blank space; the entire paragraph will be selected. Select Edit... Clear... Clear Formatting. Then select Format... Style...*; the Style dialog box appears. In the list **Styles, select Normal. Then click Apply. The content of the misbehaving paragraph should change, and the tabs should work as expected now. \nWhat I suspect is happening is that the final paragraph of the document is set to some style with unexpected tab stops. Your workarounds have the effect of changing the formatting or the style of the final paragraph, getting expected behaviour. But I expect that the style also specifies that the \"next paragraph\" will have the same oddly-behaving style. This is why the problem recurs every time you add a paragraph.\nThe more comprehensive fix is to understand the styles your document uses, and to improve them. Microsoft has a tutorial Format text with styles which might be helpful place to start.\n\nA: In Word, go to Preferences > View > Nonprinting Characters.\nCheck all the boxes. You might have some special characters that are modifying the behavior of Tab.\nAdditionally, if you have field codes you might be trying to edit those. Turn on the highlight field code preferences in the same preference pane.\n\nA: Go to Format>>Tabs\n  The default stop has been reset to zero. Insert your preference (0.5\"). The problem goes away.\n\nA: This problem showed up for me after my bird trotted across the keyboard, so I had to experiment to see what she had stepped on (not the first time!).\nWhat fixed this problem was making sure that function keys that affect repeat times were not turned on.  In Windows 10, search for \"keyboard shortcuts\" and it will bring up the option \"press one key at a time for keyboard shortcuts\".  Make sure the Filter Keys option is off.  This removes the function that delays repeated entries (such as double-letters) and will allow you to tab freely again.  It's actually a keyboard setting.\n", "Q: How can I switch off \"hold home button\" voice control? My Brother in law has an IPhone 4 (not 4s) with a special kind of durable cover.  however this means that the home button gets pressed a lot in his pocket and switches on voice control which does all sorts of weird things.\nCan you switch off the long press home button voice control?\nIs there any other solution other than get a new iphone cover?\n\nA: In Settings > General > Passcode Lock (Yeah, a weird place, but hey ho) you can limit the voice control to music options only, and turn off voice dialling.  This doesn't disable the long press option, but it does mean that at worst it can annoy you rather than embarrass you...\n\n\nNote that for Jailbroken devices, there seem to be a number of tweaks and hacks that will disable the function entirely.

And the text of the right column continues in the right column of the next one.\nWhat I'm trying to do is to have some text and its translation, side by side.\n\nA: You could accomplish this by creating a Page Layout document. On the first page, create two side-by-side Text Boxes. Before typing, duplicate the page (control-click on the page thumbnail to the left of the editing area). Then, link each text box to its corresponding text box on the next page.\n\nTo add additional pages, go to the last page and duplicate it, to avoid having to recreate the text boxes from scratch each time.\n\nA: A simple way of achieving this is to have a simple table, with 2 columns and 1 row.  Set the borders to be empty/invisible/unset so that they do not show, and then put each language into their respective \"side\".  This isn't a true column view, but the net effect should be the same and it should carry across page breaks fine.\n", "Q: How can I activate the 'say' command from the keyboard?

Yesterday I connected it to my laptop to copy over photos. iPhoto said only 1 photo of 500 was imported. So I went to iTunes to import, selected \"import all\" hoping it would pick up everything. I chose the option \"Keep Photos on iPhone\" since I wanted to share a few recent photos yet with friends. No luck with the transfer of photos. So then I asked it to sync. Still nothing transfered to the laptop. After I unplugged my phone I noticed the photo library on the iPhone had changed. All the pictures I had taken were simply gone, and photos from prior to 2 months ago were in their place. It had restored a previous backup rather than transfer the new photos. I hadn't clicked \"delete\" photos but I think it just did it as part of restore sync. Is there any possible way to recover the pictures now — after a restore, without any previous backup?\n\nA: Before a sync or restore, I believe that iTunes will create a backup of your phone's contents (unless you manually cancel this backup). The backup will contain the photos and videos that were on the phone.\nYou can check if a backup was created by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch iTunes\n\n*iTunes > Preferences > Devices\n\n*See if there is an entry with the date of the restore.\n\n\nIf a backup exists, you can recover your data with one of two methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restore your phone using that backup; or\n\n*Use an application such as iPhone Backup Extractor to extract the images out of the backup file.\n\n\nA: First, check if their physical footprint still exists. Go to Settings > General > Usage and check the amount of storage available, do you notice that there is a lot of used storage ? You can also check it through iTunes, which might show used memory labeled as Other.\nI lost all my pictures and videos after jailbreaking my phone, yet iTunes showed that they are still taking physical memory (labeled as Other - iTunes did not recognise my pics or vids anymore). This means they cannot be viewed via Camera Roll but they are still stored in the phone.\nTo fix that, download iFunBox ( http://www.i-funbox.com ) and use it to locate and extract the images from the phone (no need for iTunes to access the phone). I managed to extract all my photos from the phone to an external USB, which accumulated to over 20GB of photos and videos.\nUse this method and you should recover your photos and videos with no previous backup. If your phone shows that there is a lot of empty storage, then your photos might have actually been completely removed.\n", "Q: How do I use iMessages without a sim card? I recently received an iPhone 3G from a friend. She took out her SIM card, so I don't have a SIM on my iPhone. I heard that you can now text on iMessage using your email instead of a phone number. I went to Settings > Messages, and I put in my email address, but my friend's number is on top. I'm tying to delete it, but I can't. I also have no SIM.\n\nA: This is the same set of steps you would use if you had a sim card, it's more about clearing the account that device has registered with the iMessage service.\nTry to turn off iMessage completely, totally log out of the system in Settings > Messages.  When you re-enable it, ensure you log in with your own Apple ID.  At this point, you should be able to message to your registered email address.\nIf that doesn't work, you may need to back everything up and restore the device. This is somewhat problematic without a SIM card, since you may get stuck at activation if you don't at least have an inactive SIM from the proper carrier.\n", "Q: Unsupported URL Error on iPod I have an iPod touch 4th generation Jailbroken 5.0.1, and today I started getting this \"unsupported URL\" error within apps, and on the home screen safari shortcuts.

I'm syncing my iPhone's Notes to iCloud. If I delete one of these notes, is it permanently deleted, or is there a way for me to recover it?\n\nA: From my own testing, it seems to depend on how you delete the note...\nIf you delete the note on iCloud.com:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can easily recover the note by going to the Trash folder.\n\n\nIf you delete the note on an iOS device:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can recover the note by restoring the device (if it's been backed up).\n\n*You can recover the note from a device that hasn't recieved the latest sync changes.\n\n\nA: Yes, there is a way to recover it.\nThe way I did it was to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to my iPad (or any iDevice): Settings: General: Reset: Erase All Content and Settings.  This will wipe clean the iDevice, prompting you to set up as a new device or restore from an iTunes or iCloud backup.\n\n*Restore from iCloud backup.  I had just deleted the note, so I chose an iCloud backup from the day before. You will need to be connected to your wifi network at this point.  Let it go through the motions of restoring the information.  It will give you an \"estimated time remaining\" status bar.  You need to be by your router at this point.  Once it finishes restoring, your iDevice will reboot. During the reboot, your iDevice will be loading all of the information that it just downloaded from the iCloud backup.  At this point, your old note will be in there, but as soon as it loads, if you're connected to the internet, it will re-sync with iCloud and you'll will right back where you were before you did the restore. I know because I did it once already.  To stop this from happening:\n\n*As soon as your iDevice starts to reboot, turn off your wifi router or otherwise make it to where the iDevice has no internet connection. Your iDevice will finish loading the iCloud backup, and your notes will be as they were the day before or at the time of the last back up.\nI only had one note that I needed to retrieve, so I copied it and opened an email and emailed it to myself. I was a little concerned that this may not work, seeing as I was not connected to the internet, but, once I reconnected, the email sent. Naturally, at that point my notes were all synced back to current, but I had the note in the email and, thus, was able to recreate the note.\nNote: If you have a cellular device, pull out the sim before you start this process. If not it will still sync the new notes even with the WiFi off.\n\nA: Depends if you have any other devices that also sync.  If so, then if you can stop them from syncing, you can at least copy the contents before it is removed.  Other than that, once it's gone, it's gone.  Their may be more potential for getting it back in Mountain Lion which has a dedicated Notes client and also the standard HFS filesystem which may allow you to \"undelete\", but this is conjecture at this point.\n\nA: Check your email program.The iCloud notes are in there too.\nYour locally stored content from Mail.app is backed up by Time Machine as well; if you have it enabled you can go back in time and see your old notes.\n", "Q: What happens when 2 clients modify the same iCloud synced Note?

Or does it store data from both modifications?\n\nA: An iCloud-synced document is implemented with the NSDocument class. The full guide to this class including details on conflict resolution is the Document-Based App Programming Guide for Mac. Briefly, conflict resolution is attempted automatically. If the most recent document is not clear (the most recent, based on modification date is favoured) then the Versions user interface is involved and the user must select the correct document to resolve the conflict.\n\n", "Q: Where does OS X remember previously connected bluetooth devices? I completely erased my hard drive (DOE compliant 3 pass secure erase) that had OS X Lion on it and reinstalled it from the recovery drive earlier today. To my astonishment, I saw that the Bluetooth preferences remembered all my 4 previously paired devices, albeit, with only their MAC addresses and not device names.\n\nWhere is this information stored? I did not reset my PRAM, but this page does not indicate that it keeps a history of Bluetooth devices connected. \nWhat other similar information is stored persistently? My networks preferences didn't show any of my previously connected wireless networks, but I'm curious now — is it possible to retrieve it after such a wipe and reinstall?\n\nA: There's a question from SuperUser that might be useful for you.\nIn Lion, Bluetooth information is stored in different .plist file with Bluetooth prefix. For my case, I have~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent.plist and ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.BluetoothFileExchange.plist\n\nA: Since Bluetooth devices need to work early in the boot process, they get stored in the /Library and only user specific items get stored in your user ~/Library file. Also keep in mind, that the recovery HD may also keep pairing information stored redundantly so you can use the keyboard and pointing device when booted into recovery mode. \nSo - the pairing is a little bit here, a little bit there, some pairings might even end up in the keychain on a system or user level. \n\nA: I think it is not stored on the hard disk, as I once replaced the HDD in my MacBook and my Bluetooth mouse was already working in the boot selection screen (when you press alt on boot-up).\nAnd if I remember correctly, on another Mac the Bluetooth mouse was working in Windows setup process (without Windows drivers loaded) - but having been paired in OS X on that computer. \nThis leaves the PRAM (or if there is any EFI storage besides the boot-partition on the HDD).\nI think either a PRAM reset or SMC reset should erase the list of paired devices.\n\nA: It might be that the Bluetooth devices still think they're paired with the Mac (by the Bluetooth MAC address), so, when they see it but it doesn't respond, they go into a mini-discoverable mode and your new Lion install saw them as \"devices that said they're paired with me even though I've no idea who they are\".\n\nA: It sounds to me like you might have Bluetooth turned on on those devices, and on the laptop. The fact they aren't connected and only show the MAC Address says to me that they're unpaired devices that it can see, but hasn't connected to.\nIf you turn Bluetooth off on one of the devices then does it disappear?\n\nA: i think the apple list is incomplete. \nand i'm inclined to think the pairings are stored in pram (or similar) because we have a situation where all of our hosts are imaged using the same image, but some (newer) require a different netboot, and only some are haunted by a mouse that was likely paired to a pre-image machine contributing to the netboots.\nwe think one netboot contains the mouse in it's /Library, and that causes the pairing to be remembered within pram, because the workflow that netboot deploys causes recovery and hd partitions to be overwritten, then when the machine reboots fresh, only some already know about that mouse.\nwe'll do a little testing to see if that theory stacks up. if i get conclusive results i'll report back, but it's hardly scientific without a view into pram.\nconsider this; how does your mac reach the boot loader chooser via the option key, if it's knowledge of your keyboard is dependant on a setting in /Library ..?\n\nA: Inspired by your exploration, I set up this question to find out how you can view the PRAM (which is nowadays called NVRAM!). Turns out it’s pretty easy. Please see if inspecting the NVRAM does help you.\n", "Q: How can I export PDFs from a PC to a new iPad? I want to load some of the PDFs I bought from the internet to my iPad from my PC (Windows 7). How can I do this?\nI've never bothered about tablets before, but somehow I got an iPad. I did some research in Stack Exchange, but all I could find was information regarding the sending of PDFs from an iPad to a PC; not the other way.\n\nA: To copy pdfs to your device you should use iTunes like in this video  (just use iTunes for Windows).\nYou can use iBooks to read pdfs on your device.\nHere is related question here.\n", "Q: How can I make Finder start not in \"All my files\" I don't like that Finder shows me \"All My Files\":\n\nIt also delays Finder start a little.\nHow can I make Finder start in some different place (not in \"All My Flies\")?\nCan finder start in my home directory ~ or anywhere here:\n\n\nA: You can change this in Finder > Preferences > General > New Finder windows show.

I bought a Griffin guitar cable when I picked up my iPad 3. It plugs into the headphone socket which I assume is supposed to act as an audio-in jack.  \nIt didn't seem to work and after testing and much checking online, including the tech specs at apple.com, I was left with the impression that the iPad doesn't have a combined input & headphone output on the headphone jack (like say the 13\" MBP). I took the cable back to the Apple store and the Genius guy patronised me at length and insisted that either the cable was faulty or my iPad was. I will be taking it to see them in a few days so see if there is something wrong with my iPad, but deep down, I am convinced I am right. I would appreciate someone settling this for me one way or the other. Do I need an audio interface that works via the dock or should this simple cable work with my headphone jack doubling up as a line in?\nThanks for reading.\n\nA: The new iPad, like all iPads, have a combined audio input/output jack, like the iPhone and newer MacBooks. The Genius was correct: Griffin cable should have worked. If it didn't, either the cable or the iPad was faulty.\nOne other possibility is that it was the software. This isn't very likely, but it's possible that the software you were using had some sort of compatibility issue with the new iPad.\n", "Q: Time Machine: How can you confirm a backup? Can you just delete the backup and it will automatically redo it? I use Time Machine to backup to an external hard drive. That external drive also has a lot of other photos and unique info on that drive, too. \nI'm not sure my Time Machine backed up my whole computer because of the computer turned off in the middle of the first time I used it (recently).\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to confirm that the backup on the Time Machine is complete?\n\n*Lets say I just want to redo the backup from scratch. I can't format the external drive since it has a lot of other unique info. How can I delete the Time Machine information and have Time Machine automatically redo the backup?\n\n\nA: The first question, how can you be sure a backup has completed, is answered by checking the menubar Time Machine item. It will tell you the date of the last completed backup.\nSecondly if you want to perform another complete Time Machine backup you can stop Time Machine, eject the Time Machine drive, plug in a fresh drive and re-enable Time Machine using that drive as the backup destination. A complete new backup will be performed.\nYou could also just delete everything on the original Time Machine drive but it is slightly more risky. If something bad happened before the new backup completed you would be without the backup you are not sure about and the new backup.\n\nA: When TimeMachine runs if the previous backup was interrupted it will do a check to work out what it needs to do to run a complete backup.\nLet it run and it will automatically give you a complete backup.\nAlso, in System Prefs - Time Machine, check the options to see if anything has been excluded. You can optionally exclude disks and folders - clearly you don't want that, so best to confirm it.\n", "Q: What's the maximum amount of users I can have on OS X and how many of these can be logged in at the same time? One of my friends controls hundreds of Macs for a school. They have Lion.\nThe 6th grade Macs have the 6th grade accounts (~100), the 7th grade Macs have the 7th grade accounts (~120) and the 8th grade Macs have the 8th grade accounts (~90). There are also some staff accounts.\nHe doesn't have all the users on all the Macs; I believe that he has them set up to grab the profiles from a server - thus, a user's desktop on one computer is synced with that user's desktop on another computer.\nI'm wondering whether or not it's possible to put all ~400 users on each computer so that the grades can use each others' Macs interchangeably. Is it possible to put this many users on a Mac? And how many of these can be logged in at the same time?\n\nA: \nI'm wondering whether or not it's possible to put all ~400 users on each computer so that the grades can use each others' Macs interchangeably\n\nMost certainly. I'm at a university where they do this on a much larger scale (think about 10–20k), so 400 should be possible — but, it also depends on the school's IT infrastructure. The user directories and settings are all on a central server (or perhaps server farm, I don't know) and each machine pulls the info when you login. You can login from any machine anywhere in the campus.\nTypically, the maximum number of accounts the server can have is limited by the storage space, and the number of simultaneous logins are typically limited by the amount of memory, processing power available and network bandwidth (the clients need to communicate with the server and a single server can only process a certain number of requests at a time). So a definite answer is hard to provide. \nThe general approach is to spread the load (when demand spikes) over a cluster of servers or a server farm such that the end-user performance remains the same. Of course, no one expects the entire campus to be connecting all at once (there probably aren't enough machines for that). You can read more load balancing here.\nThis discussion mentions a software enforced default limit of 1024 simultaneous connections, extendable up to 2048. If you find yourself running at the far end of this limit, then you're either not balancing your load properly or you're under equipped.\n\nA: I would imagine they're using something like Open Directory - so really, it's not all the users on all the Macs, but all the users on a central server that controls access to all the Macs. Also, central control of home directories and such, so each Mac is really just a node for people to log onto and use their shared infrastructure.\nIt's very hard to control such infrastructure with hundreds of users without centralization.\nThe limit is in the thousands - 200,000 database items I believe, although that's not users, but includes servers, Mac, etc.\nWith a centralized Open Directory system running from an OS X Server you can handle all 400 users from one central server. Best to have a couple for resiliency, etc.\nAdd to this that there are considerations of usage, network design, etc. that also come into play. In some scenarios you might want 1 server (or server pair) per grade if you're split into individual computer labs or similar. Then take a look at the network topology and work out how much data is expected to flow over individual links, etc.\nhttp://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/considerations-for-implementation-of-lion-servers-.html\nThat link quotes 1000 simultaneous clients connected. Remember that's running from a  central server, not on any given Mac. You expect only one user at a time on any given Mac.\n", "Q: Can I create two different Docks that I can switch back and forth between? I have two different accounts right now - one for work, one for play. It helps me stay focused, and it's quite useful.\nHowever, sometimes I don't really love switching back and forth between user accounts sometimes. Thus, I've thought up an idea: What if I had 2 different Docks that I could switch between with a keyboard shortcut?\nThus, my question: Can I create 2 different Docks with 2 different sets of apps on each of them that I can switch between with a keyboard shortcut?\nExample: Dock 1 has Finder, Mail, Safari, iTunes, Chrome, Trash on it; Dock 2 has Finder, Firefox, Trash, Opera, and Dictionary on it. I press Command-Option-0 and it switches to Dock 2. I press it again and it switches to Dock 1.\n\nA: You could use an Automator service or one of the global-keybaord-trigger apps to run a script that switches between two different Dock preference plist files and then relaunches the Dock.\n#!/bin/sh\n#you'd have a dock-work.plist and dock-home.plist file \n\ncd ~/Library/Preferences/\n\nif [ -e dock-is-work.state ] ; then \n    rm dock-is-work.state\n    touch dock-is-home.state\n\n    #save changes to existing Dock setup\n    cp com.apple.dock.plist com.apple.dock-work.plist\n\n    #copy home setup to main preference location\n    cp com.apple.dock-home.plist com.apple.dock.plist\nelse\n    rm dock-is-home.state\n    touch dock-is-work.state\n\n    #save changes to existing Dock setup\n    cp com.apple.dock.plist com.apple.dock-home.plist\n\n    #copy work setup to main preference location\n    cp com.apple.dock-work.plist com.apple.dock.plist\nfi\n\nosascript -e \"tell application \\\"Dock\\\" to quit\"\n\n(I haven't done bash if-then-else in awhile, so this might not execute as is.)\n\nA: You can use DockSpaces. (They just switched to a paid app, but you can download a free older version on Softpedia).\nDockspaces allows you to have up to 10 different docks that you can switch back and forth with hotkeys (Command + 1, Command + 2, etc.). I found it to be a really great app and really easy to use.\n\n\n", "Q: Copying the current directory's path to the clipboard What's a quick way of copying the path to the directory that's currently open in Finder? \nCopying that path is very easy in Linux and Windows file managers - you just need to copy it from the address bar. I don't see a corresponding option in Finder.\n\nA: If you use Alfred, you can select the items, press ⌥⌘\\, and select Copy path to Clipboard.\nYou could also assign a shortcut to a script like this:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set the clipboard to POSIX path of (insertion location as alias)\nend\n\nThis would copy the paths of all selected items:\nset l to {}\ntell application \"Finder\" to repeat with f in (get selection)\n    set end of l to POSIX path of (f as alias)\nend repeat\nset text item delimiters to linefeed\nset the clipboard to (l as text)\n\nThere's a bug on 10.7 and 10.8 where the selection, insertion location, and target properties refer to the second frontmost window after opening a new window. It affects both scripts and Alfred, but not Automator services. As a workaround, you could move focus to another application and back before getting the selection:\nactivate application \"SystemUIServer\"\nactivate application \"Finder\"\n\n\nA: The MacYourself tip Copy file or folder path to the clipboard in Mac OS X Lion works for me on 10.7.4. Basically it leads you through the steps of creating an Automator service that can be used to copy the full path of files and folders from the Finder. You then use it by assigning a custom hotkey or use the right-click menu to copy the path to the clipboard when a file or folder is selected.\n\nIf it helps, you can also type the following command into the Terminal to get the Finder to display the full path to the current folder in its titlebar:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder _FXShowPosixPathInTitle -bool YES\n\nUse the following to turn it off again:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder _FXShowPosixPathInTitle -bool NO\n\n\nA: Option+Command+C\nWill copy the path for selected folder or file to the clipboard. Tried on El Capitan.\n\nA: Although this doesn't answer your question directly, I have a more efficient method of obtaining the file's path (presumably for it to be pasted into terminal or a text file, for example). Simply drag-and-dropping the file into a text field will automatically insert the file's path.\n\nA: Back a few years ago, I would always have the pos utility written by Gary Kerbaugh to improve finder / terminal interaction.\n\n\n*\n\n*cdf would cd to the path of the frontmost Finder window\n\n*fdc would open a Finder window at the current shell path\n\n*posd would just dump the path\n\n\nThis coupled with pbcopy and pbpaste should fit the bill for getting arbitrary paths to text format and then into your clipboard.\nI believe homebrew has adopted part but not all of this package so I'm not sure if you can find a workable version of all the above, but it was magic when I first started using it. Now I just use Launchbar to push files around without caring so much about recording a specific folder.\n\nA: Dunno why or what i do, but this exists on my PC (High Sierra 10.13.4)\n\n\nA: Next to the name of the folder in the Finder is an icon depicting that folder. This icon can be dragged to anywhere you need to accept a path - dragging to the Terminal or TextEdit in plain text mode will drop the path as text in the window or document. However, this does not work with all destinations - copying to a rich-text TextEdit document, for example, copies a link to the folder and not the path.\nThere are some third-party apps, some free, some paid, that add this functionality. You can also create a service with Automator (or AppleScript) to do it, but a simple and free method that I like, especially if you like to use the terminal anyway, is to invoke DTerm on the Finder window and run:\npwd | pbcopy\n\nThat will copy the current path to the Mac OS X clipboard.\n\nA: You can use Automator to do this with a single keyboard shortcut that you can use from any app, and without installing 3rd party software.\nThis Automator Service will copy the path of the Finder's front window, rather than the path of a selected file or folder, so it won't affect what windows are open or what items are selected. The path that is copied is simply text, so it can be pasted anywhere that you can paste text.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator and create a new Service.\n\n*Change \"Service receives selected\" to no input (or \"files or folders\" to have it appear from a right click) and leave it set to any application (unless you only want it to work from a specific app, like the Finder).\n\n*Add a \"Run AppleScript\" action to the workflow.\n\n*Replace (* Your script goes here *) with:\ntry\n    tell application \"Finder\" to set the clipboard to POSIX path of (target of window 1 as alias)\non error\n    beep\nend try\n\n\n*Save the Automator Service with whatever name you'd like it to have in the Services menu.\nThis Automator Service will now be in your Services menu.\nNote: This doesn't escape spaces, so if your path has spaces, you may need to quote it. For example, in Terminal, the path would need to be quoted, but in Finder's \"Go to Folder\" command, it would not. If you want it to copy as quoted, you can change POSIX path to quoted form of POSIX path.\n\nYou can add a keyboard shortcut for the service by going to System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts, then click on \"Services\" in the left pane, then scroll down to the \"General\" section in the right pane until you find your service. \n\n\nA: Command + I, then copy information under Where: \n\n\nA: The easiest way I know to get the path to a file or folder is to Get Info on the folder or file (select it, right-click and pick Get Info), and then in the middle \"General\" section, you can select and copy (command + C) the path.\n\nAs for your other question, clicking on column headers in list view in the Finder does allow you to sort ascending or descending.\nI do not understand the last question you ask -- again, I'd say go to the file itself, right-click and do as I described above to get the path. \n\nA: If you need the path in Terminal/iTerm, you can just select the file/folder in Finder, copy it (Command+C), switch to the Terminal and paste it (Command+V).\nYou can also drag and drop the file/folder to the Terminal/iTerm.\n\nA: On OS X, many things can be accomplished by dragging & dropping. Apple thinks you don't need to be able to access the file path conveniently because everything can be accomplished by drag & drop. I'm not completely of the same mind, but usually I can do what I want.\nThis is how common actions are performed on OS X where you would need a path in Windows or Linux.\n\n\n*\n\n*To just find out where you are in Finder, right-click (or Command ⌘-click) the folder name in the title area.\n\n*In a file selection dialog, to navigate to an opened Finder location, drag the folder or any file from that folder onto the selection dialog. This will not move the file or folder like it does in Windows, but set the path of the File dialog instead. (You can also drag a the document proxy icon (from the title bar of most apps) or ⌘-drag items out of the Dock to do this.)\n\n*To get the path of a file in Terminal or another text-only Application, drag the file on the Terminal window.\nWhat is not (easily) possible:\n\n\n*\n\n*Inserting the file path of a file that is supported differently in an Application. For example, dragging an image into TextEdit (in RichText mode) will insert the image itself instead of the file path.\n\n\nA: Since Yosemite now has Windows-like dropdowns in Info window and this is the top Google result, here's what I came up with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Command + I to bring up Info window, the Comments and Preview sections will be expanded by default\n\n*Drag Preview's folder icon into Comment's textbox\n\n*Command + A, Command+X to cut the path to clipboard and undo the Comment change, Command + W to close\n\n\nA: As of macOS Catalina:\nLike @Kokizzu said, to get the \"Copy  as Pathname\", open your context menu (right-click or two-finger click). Once it is open, hold down the alt/option key to get that option to appear.\n\nA: To copy the active path in Finder, simply control-click the folder or file to bring up the contextual menu. Next, select copy the_folder/file_you_want. Following that, you can paste the path to a terminal window. \n\nA: I just made a quick Automator Action.\nThe Get first Finder Window Path action will to get the front most Finder windows Posix Path. \nIt a beta, but is working ok. 10.8 only\nIt will return the Posix path of the front most open Finder window.\n1, Open the zip and install it by double clicking on the action.\nIt will go into the Utilities Actions name 'Get first Finder Window Path'\n2, drag it as normal to workflow area and add for example the 'Copy to Clipboard' action below it\n\nThe Service selected can be file or folder if you save it as a'Service' this will enable you to then also use the contextual menu when clicking on any file or folder. doing so will run the actions and only return the Same window result. Not the selected file or folder. Alternatively set it to 'none.\nYou can save it as a service or like me save it as an Application and then drag the app into the finder windows Toolbar.\nWhere you just have to click it.\n\n\nA: Copy Path Finder Button is by far the easiest method I've found to accomplish this. It's so simple – download it, put in your Apps folder, then drag to your finder's toolbar, done.\n\n\n*\n\n*the download \n\n*a writeup + short video\n", "Q: Flashback malware on Snow Leopard My Mac OSX Snow Leopard got exploited by the Flashback malware.

Occasionally there shows a picture that I'd like to see in iPhoto. Is there a way to get the picture info while it shows as the desktop?\n\nA: I'm afraid you can't. Your desktop just uses your iPhoto library to generate the background randomly.\nSo, the shown background is just a one-way link to the picture in your iPhoto library.\n", "Q: My MacBook Pro loses its connection to my WiFi router I've set up a brand-new internet connection with a Wireless Router.\nThe thing is that :\n\n\n*\n\n*It works all the time for my iMac\n\n*It stops working at times on my MacBook Pro (either when connected\nvia wifi, or using an ethernet cable), so I have to \"Turn Wifi Off\",\nthen \"Turn Wifi On\" and reconnect, or simply re-plug in my ethernet\ncable.\n\n\n\nUPDATE\n\nMy iMac specs\n\n\n*\n\n*Model : iMac11,2 - Intel Core i3 (3.06GHz)\n\n*OS    : 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard)\n\n\nMy MacBook Pro specs\n\n\n*\n\n*Model : MacBookPro8,1 - Intel Core i5 (2.3GHz) [early 2011]\n\n*OS    : 10.7.3 (Lion)\n\n\nMy Router specs\n\n\n*\n\n*Brand : ZTE\n\n*Model : ZXV10 W300 v5.2\n\n\n\nI'm sure it may have something to do with my connection settings, but I'm not sure what it is...\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Mac Wireless & Airport Connection Problem Troubleshooting: The Basics\n* Turn Airport on & off – You can do this via the Airport menu bar or from the Network Preferences. This is the first thing you should try when troubleshooting Mac wireless problems.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset your router – This is the second thing you should try doing. You can fix a surprising amount of wireless problems just by resetting the airport/router. All you need to do is turn the thing off for a few seconds and turn it back on.\n\n*Reset your Cable/DSL modem – You’ll usually want to reset this in combination with your wireless router. Reset this first so the DHCP information will be pulled to the wireless router properly.\n\n*Change Wireless Channels – sometimes your router’s wireless broadcast channel will interfere with a neighbors, be sure you have your router set to a unique channel. Even if it’s a weak signal there can still be interference.\n\n*Make sure Wireless/Airport card software & firmware is up to date – This is usually done just by going to the Software Update menu, if there are any updates available for your Mac or Airport, install them.\nMac Wireless Troubleshooting: Intermediate\n* Change wireless security protocol – You shouldn’t be using WEP anyway for security reasons, but sometimes changing from WEP to WPA/WPA2 or WPA to WPA2 can resolve wireless connection difficulties.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure router firmware is up to date – Check your router manufacturers website for firmware updates, if there are any available, install them.\n\n*Delete and recreate connection – Try deleting and recreating/reestablishing the wireless connection, sometimes a setting can be corrupted and this may fix it.\n\n*Create a new Network Location – Similar to the above suggestion, try creating a new and different wireless network location to see if it resolves the connection problems.\n\n*Change DHCP auto settings to manual – sometimes there is a problem with the DHCP server, and if you manually set an IP address on the network you can be fine. Remember to set the IP to a high number so it wouldn’t interfere with other DHCP machines. As long as you have the subnet mask, router, and DNS settings configured manually as well, this shouldn’t be a problem.\n\n*Disable “Wireless G/N/B only” mode – Sometimes a setting is selected that only broadcasts your wireless signal in Wireless B, G, or N mode (depending on the routers abilities). If this is set, try disabling it.\n\n*Flush the DNS cache – Launch the Terminal and enter the following command onto one full line within the Terminal:\ndscacheutil -flushcache\n\nMac Wireless Connection Problem Troubleshooting: Advanced\n* Zap the PRAM – Reboot your Mac and hold Command+Option+P+R during restart until you hear another chime, let the Mac boot as usual.\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete Wireless Config files – Delete com.apple.internetconfigpriv.plist and com.apple.internetconfig.plist files from ~/Library/Preferences and reboot\n\n*Trash your home directories SystemConfiguration – Remove all files within ~/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/ and then reboot your Mac.\n\n*Reset your Mac’s System Management Controller (SMC) – For MacBook and MacBook Pro’s: Shutdown the MacBook/Pro, remove the battery, disconnect the power, hold the Power Key for 15 seconds. Replace the battery, reconnect power, and zap the PRAM and wait for 2 chimes before letting the keys go. Let boot as usual.\nsource: osxdaily.com\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2009/12/22/mac-wireless-problems-guide-to-troubleshooting-airport-wireless-problems-on-your-mac/\n\nA: Have you tried switching from DHCP to manual setup? Sometimes when i've put my MBP to sleep and wake it up the connection is lost and the only way to get back up is turn the WiFi off (i do this through terminal for speed):\n$ sudo ifconfig en1 down\n$ sudo ifconfig en1 up\n\nUsing manual setup doesn't work in my case since it is the University network of Delft (NL). But at your home network it won't hurt to use a static ip and other static settings.\n\nA: Official Apple Support doc on wifi networks:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4199\nOne thing I noticed recently on my own network was that I was using a 40MHz band but Apple don't actually support that band, just 20MHz bands. I switched my wifi at home but haven't been using it long enough yet to say if it has made much difference.\nAlso make sure that your wifi is turned off if you are using the ethernet cable. This will help you determine if it is a problem with just the wifi or with the wifi and the ethernet.\nYou could also get a utility from the Mac App Store to investigate your wifi network. As the first google result I got(wifi explorer):\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wifi-explorer/id494803304?mt=12\nbut I haven't tested it or any similar programs myself so I can't say for sure how helpful they would be.\n\nA: Make sure the name of your WiFi network (the SSID) is unique in your area and that you have WPA2 turned on.  Otherwise your laptop could get confused trying to connect to another router with the same name.  And of course verify that you have adequate signal strength for communication between the router and the laptop.  \nMake sure the router's DHCP server is turned on.  If you have an option for setting the lease time for DHCP, set it to at least 24 hours. \nIf you really think it's a configuration error and the above steps don't resolve it, then delete and recreate both your Wi-Fi and Ethernet interfaces in the Network System Preferences and just leave them at the default settings.  \n\nA: I had this problem, and my understanding is that the disconnection issues had to do with the plethora of wifi routers in my building.  Changing the channel on my router solved the problem.\nThe process for doing this will depend on your router.  Generally you will log in to your router through a browser and change one setting.  Check the router manufacturer's instructions.\nThe first Google result I get for \"change router channel\" provides some generic directions for figuring out what channel to use:\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/howto/21132/change-your-wi-fi-router-channel-to-optimize-your-wireless-signal/\nTo be honest, I was lazy and just picked an alternate channel.  5 through 11 are often good options.\n", "Q: Folder tree in Finder sidebar (or stuck to Finder) Is there a Finder plugin (maybe SIMBL plugin) which allows one to see the directory structure in the Finder's sidebar (instead of Favorites, Shared, Devices) or in an attached window?\nSomething like this:\n\nThere is Cover Flow, but it's not what I need.\nAlso I don't need any Finder replacement; I just want to fix this missing feature in Finder.\n\nA: I doubt there's a SIMBL plugin to do that. What you're asking for would be a fairly extensive rewrite even if you had the source code for the Finder.\nYour best bets are what @jtbandes and @Richard's comments on your question state: get a Finder replacement that does that or use list view in the Finder.\n", "Q: What methods are available to (re)install Lion on a Mac? With genuine Lion install media being a rarety (and only included on certain newer Macs), there are a lot of queries by users on how they are best able to re-install (or even simply install) Lion on their computers.\nI think it would be very useful to have a single canonical answer that is able to present every sensible install option on a single page, from which machines include the USB install media to how to use Internet Recovery, and all the homebrew options of self burning an image to DVD etc inbetween.\nSo, what methods are you aware of, or have you used, to re-install Lion on your Mac?\nPlease try to include 1 answer per answer, and detail it as fully as possible in order to prevent duplicate answers, or answers that contain bits of the method etc.  Feel free to edit others answers to increase the detail level. Try not to link to existing guides or external webpages without summarising or paraphasing, it is far better to include the information directly on this site.\n\nA: Create a bootable OS X Lion USB stick or DVD based on the Mac App Store download\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy and download Lion from the Mac App Store. The installer should show up in your Applications folder.\n\n*Right-click on the installer and hit “Show Package Contents”. Navigate to Contents/SharedSupport and look for a file called InstallESD.dmg.\n\n*Open up Disk Utility and drag the DMG file into the left-hand sidebar. If you’re burning it to a DVD, insert your DVD, select the disk image in the sidebar, and hit the “Burn” button. Skip down to the last step to use it.\n\n*If you want to burn Lion to a USB flash drive, plug it in and click on it in the left-hand sidebar in Disk Utility. Go to the Partition tab and select “1 Partition” from the dropdown menu. Choose “Mac OS Extended (Journaled)” on the left.\n\n*Hit the “Options” button under the partition table and choose “GUID Partition Table”. You’ll need this to make the drive bootable on a Mac. Hit the “Apply” button when you’re done to format your drive (note: it will erase everything on the drive).\n\n*Click on the “Restore” tab, choose the InstallESD.dmg file as the source and your flash drive as the destination. Hit the “Apply” button and it will create your bootable USB drive.\n\n\n*Reboot into OS X and hold the option key when you hear the startup chime. You can boot into your DVD or flash drive from there.\n\nA: Lion Recovery (requires internet connection)\n\nReinstalling OS X Lion via Lion Recovery requires broadband access to\nthe Internet via Wi-Fi or an Ethernet connection. OS X Lion is\ndownloaded over the Internet from Apple when Lion Recovery is used for\nreinstallation.\nThe OS X Lion download is about 4 GB large. [source]\n\n\n*\n\n*Upon boot you can hold\n⌘+R\nin order to directly boot into the recovery partition. The recovery partition exists on every Mac that came shipped with Lion or had Lion installed as a clean install.\n\n*Upon boot you can hold ⌥. This will display all options of where your Mac can boot from. Choose Recovery HD.\n\n*Apples offers the Lion Recovery Disk Assistant to create your own Lion install USB. Using this method, an install of Lion requires an internet connection. Upon boot you hold ⌥ and choose the recovery disk.\n\nOnce your Mac has booted from the recovery partition/usb you may have to pass a setup for your language preferences first. After that choose to install Lion from the menubar.\n\nA: Buy a bootable OS X Lion USB stick\nYou can buy a bootable OS X Lion USB Thumb Drive from the Apple Store: http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD256Z/A\n\n\nA: Upgrade install (from Snow Leopard)\nYou can download the Lion from the Mac App store. This will install Lion after a reboot. Your applications and personal data will not be removed. But you should perform a backup before the upgrade.\n\nA: Use Lion Recovery Disk Assistant\nA third way is to download the Lion Recovery Disk Assistant which is 1MB in size and will preform the upgrade to Lion. For this option, an existing Recovery HD and an external hard drive is needed and what is does is the following: reinstall Lion, repair the disk using Disk Utility, restore from a Time Machine backup.\n\nA: Make a bootable Lion install disc or drive\nAs you may have noticed, Lion is the first OS which doesn't ship on a bootable disk. So in order to get one, you need to create this disk.\nBasically, it comes down to donwloading Lion in the Mac App Store and burn it on a disk, put it on a flash drive.\nYou can find and extensive tutorial over here.\n\nA: Using TimeMachine backup\nI only realised recently, but if you have used Time Machine on a mac with Lion, the restoring partition is also copied on the drive. So you can simply choose to boot from the TM backup drive, and install lion from there. The restoring partition is moved on the internal drive, and then installing is the same with other procedures .\n\nA: Upgrade install (from Leopard)\nSince you need the Mac App Store, Snow Leopard is required to install Lion. But when you have a copy of Lion (being a bootable disk mentioned above or a Thumb Drive), you don't need Snow Leopard to install Lion.\nIt's more of a brute-force method, but it will work.\nThere are three main steps in this process. Backup your data, clean your hard drive and install Lion on the clean drive.\nThere is a more in-depth tutorial on how to install Lion over Leopard.\n", "Q: Apache virtualhost - Mac OSX 10.7.3 After upgrading to Lion, all my virtualhosts stopped working. They redirect to \"It works\" main apache page on my device for some weird reason.\nExample:\n/etc/hosts:\n127.0.0.1  myhost.com\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    DocumentRoot \"/Library/WebServer/Documents/testproj/\"\n    ServerName myhost.com\n\n    <Directory \"/Library/WebServer/Documents/testproj/\">\n        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n        AllowOverride All\n        Order allow,deny\n        Allow from all\n    </Directory>\n\n    ErrorLog \"/private/var/log/apache2/testproj-error_log\"\n    CustomLog \"/private/var/log/apache2/testproj-access_log\" common\n</VirtualHost>\n\nDid anyone else face the same issue? How can I fix this?\n\nA: There could be multiple causes to this issue.\nFirst, have you tried restarting Apache?\nYou can do so by typing sudo apachectl graceful in the Terminal.\nIf that doesn't work out, try to create a folder in the predestined folder (Sites), and see if it works. Alsoo, make sure you've enabled the proper settings: \n\nAnd just for the record, my httpd-vhosts.conf file (on a Windows though) looks like this:\nNameVirtualHost *:80\n\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    ServerName dev.test.be\n    ErrorLog \"logs/test.log\"\n    CustomLog \"logs/test.log\" common\n    DocumentRoot \"C:\\Users\\me\\workspace\\test\\drupal\"\n</VirtualHost>\n\n\nA: Where is that snippet of VirtualHost config? Are you sure it's being read in?\nI notice that by default, the /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf file is not read in by the main httpd.conf so you'd have to uncomment the line to read it in.\nYou can check what Apache thinks of the current vhost config with\nsudo httpd -S\n\nand verify that your myhost.com is there.\nPlease update your question with the results of this if it's not the problem so we can start narrowing it down.\n", "Q: Can I safely uninstall iTunes from my Mac? The only use I ever had for iTunes was updating and syncing my iDevices, but since the introduction of over-the-air updates and iCloud, I no longer have that need.\nMy question therefore is if I can safely remove iTunes from my Mac? Or are there other applications that depend on iTunes being available?\nThanks!\n\nA: If you don't use it, you are welcome to remove it.  However consider that the ability to backup/install/upgrade etc over USB is going to be considerably faster than doing everything via iCloud.  Particularly for a restore, using an iTunes backup will be much faster and get your device back in a single step, whereas using iCloud backups will perform a staged recovery, pulling back your options and settings etc, then pulling each app directly from the App Store, which will likely not only be very slow (certainly in comparison) but may also leave you with a large bandwidth hit if you are on a limited connection.\nThe idea of the over-the-air capabilities are to support people who do not have or wish to use a computer in order to be able to use their iOS device.  It's just another option, but it shouldn't necessarily be seen as the only or the preferable option.\nFrankly, for the space it takes up, I would consider leaving it installed, but you won't harm anything by removing it, and a re-install is simple enough should you change your mind.\n\nA: In order to uninstall iTunes, you need to delete (drag to the Trash) a lot of items:\n\n\n*\n\n*The application's icon. \n\n*/Home/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes....plist (a lot of files) and drag them to the Trash. \n\n*Look in /Library/ folder for an iTunes folder and if you find one drag it to the Trash. \n\n*Look in /Home/Library/ folder for an iTunes folder and drag it to the Trash. \n\n*Last, in /Home/Library/Preferences/ByHost/ folder look for two files with names com.apple.nnnnnnn.plist and drag them to the Trash.\n\n\nOpen Activity Monitor (Utilities folder) and in the process list look for iTunesHelper. Select it, then click on Quit Process icon. Quit or Force Quit the process. Now open the Accounts preference pane, click on Login Items tab, look for the iTunesHelper entry and select it, then click the \"-\" button and remove it from the list.\nEmpty the Trash. This should fully remove iTunes and its associated files/folders.\nYou can find all the information on this page.\nBut, there is no harm in deleting iTunes, except other iLife apps (iMovie, iPhoto,...) won't be able to get music out of the iTunes library for compiling their things (movies, slideshows,...)\nSo I'm seriously wondering why you want to delete iTunes at all. My advice is to leave it as it is and just ignore it.\nYou won't do any harm by it if you just leave iTunes there.\n\nA: Nope. Cannot be removed. It says it is 'required by mac iOS'. It requires space and loading time. I am stalled by iTunes which i don't want. mac is overrated. \n\nA: The complete process of doing this explained here. I just tried and everything works fine so far.\nBut I just discovered that if you'll try this on OSX Lion it will try to download it and reinstall it if you run it from spotlight (however it will not be present in Applications):\n\n\nA: $ cd ..\n$ cd ..\n$ cd Applications\n$ sudo su\n>>> enter password at prompt\n$ rm -rf iTunes.app \n\n", "Q: Can I download newsstand in-app purchases via my computer? I downloaded a newsstand app, and purchased a 1 year subscription in-app. Now I need to download the magazine. However, I currently have no access to WiFi and the magazine itself is 300MB. Is there any way to download the magazine on a computer and transfer it to my iPad?\n\nA: I don't think that it is possible to download the magazine onto your computer. I have little experience with newsstand. \nHowever, it may be possible to take your (presumably ethernet) internet connection, and share it to a wifi card in a mac (if you or someone else you know who will let you tweak setting on their computer have one) \nOn a mac, go to system preferences, and click on the sharing pane.\nClick on the internet sharing option in the sidebar. From the drop down menu, select share connection from ethernet, then check the checkbox for wifi. \nThis should theoretically enable you to download the magazine directly to your iPad, via the computers wifi.\n", "Q: Which 'system' apps can be safely removed I safely removed Front Row, Chess and Face Time which else system apps are safe to remove and which I should never touch?\nI think it's a bad idea to remove \"Dashboard.app\" and \"Launchpad.app\".\n\nA: I’m not sure why you would want to remove any of the apps that you mentioned — it’s not like they take up a lot of space or introduce security vulnerabilities or anything.\nOn the other hand, it would make sense to remove e.g. Java, for the reasons I mentioned before. If you don’t need Java, you can remove it by following these steps.\nFirst of all you need to check which JVM (Java Virtual Machine) you have in your system. To do so, open Terminal.app, and enter:\nsudo /usr/libexec/java_home –xml\n\nIf you you have JVM installed, you’ll get the JVMHomePath returned:\n/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home\n\nThen, remove JVM from your system:\n# Wipe out the JVM installation location\nsudo rm -rfv /System/Library/Java\n\nAfter this, restart your Mac, and confirm JVM was successfully removed by running the first command again:\nsudo /usr/libexec/java_home –xml\n\nIt should say something like:\nUnable to find any JVMs matching version \"(null)\".\nNo Java runtime present, try –request to install.\n\nThis means that it worked, and that your OS X Lion is Java-free again.\n(This is an improved version of the instructions on http://stikine.wordpress.com/2012/03/02/howto-remove-java/.)\n", "Q: How to reinstall system apps How can I reinstall some system apps?\nThere could be different reasons for that:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've removed some of my system apps and now I regret (actually not).\n\n*Before I brought my computer to service center to replace corrupted memory it caused erratical disc writes which not only damaged some documents that I worked on but also corrupted some system apps (the part about documents is true).\n\n\nA: I've found how to reinstall some of them.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount or your installation media.\n\n*You may have hidden BaseSystem.dmg in your installation media (for me it's in root).\n\n*Copy that BaseSystem.dmg somewhere and mount it to. It may contain Safari and Utilities:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Now you can just drag them in /Applications if you need them\n\n", "Q: Icons for Facetime and the App Store keep re-appearing in my dock after a restart. How can I get rid of them? I’m running Mac OS X 10.6.8. I like my dock to contain only running apps, so I’ve removed all other icons from there (by clicking and dragging them out of the dock).\nHowever, every time I restart my computer, the icons for Facetime and the App Store re-appear in the dock, even though the apps aren’t running.\nHow can I remove them from the dock permanently?\n\nA: Do other apps remain in the dock after being removed and restarted?\nDoes this behavior also occur when you log out and back in?\nI'll assume yes on both until more information is supplied:\nBarring some extraneous application modifying the dock .plist (which is unlikely that you're unaware of) it might be locked or otherwise unwritable for you.  Check the permissions on your ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist file, making sure you have Read/Write.\nIf you want, you can modify the file directly to see if you have the rights to do so, but theres a whole lot that can go wrong with that.  Instead, modify your dock and see if the file's date modified changes.  If it doesn't, your dock isn't writing the plist correctly.\nIf it's not a big issue, you can simply back-up and delete the com.apple.plist file and reconfigure the dock to your liking.\n\nA: Go to /Library/Preferences (root library, not ~) and locate the file com.apple.dockfixup.plist. Open the file with an application like Dashcode or Textwrangler. Locate the following part under the 10.6.6 section:\n    <array>\n            <dict>\n                    <key>path</key>\n                    <string>/Applications/App Store.app</string>\n                    <key>after</key>\n                    <string>begin</string>\n            </dict>\n            <dict>\n                    <key>after</key>\n                    <string>/Applications/Safari.app</string>\n                    <key>path</key>\n                    <string>/Applications/FaceTime.app</string>\n            </dict>\n    </array>\n\nDelete that section and then save the file (make sure you keep a backup of the original), then either log out and back in, or try killall Dock.\n\nA: Just extending on \"zwerdlds\" answer.  If some extra icons keep appearing on your Dock after restart. Run the following commands\nsudo chown <your_username> ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist\n\nAnd then restart the Dock\nkillall Dock\n\nThat should fix the problem!\n", "Q: How can I remove or disable Bonjour on OSX Lion, is it safe? I have the only one computer with OSX (wife hates OSX) so I have no other computer to bonjour with. I never needed neither network zero-configuration nor printer sharing or whatever it does. Windows it causes MDNSResponder problems.\nHow can I remove or disable Bonjour service?\nIs it safe?\n\nA: No you cannot remove Bonjour from MacOS X. There is no real good reason to do so anyway.\nAlso the \"problem\" you link to describes an issue with Bonjour installed on Windows 7, so it does not apply to you.\n\nA: As Gerry said it's a bad idea.\nJust removing mDNSResponder will also break DNS resolver.\nHowever it's possible to disable Bonjour service advertisements. It can be achieved by adding value '-NoMulticastAdvertisements' to the array in the \"ProgramArguments\" section.\nThat's well described in Apple knowledge base article and on Charles Edge's site.\n", "Q: How to sync Notes over iCloud? I am having trouble getting my iPhone to see the notes that are stored on my iCloud account.\nSo, my computer is running OS X Lion, on System Preferences > iCloud the \"Mail and Notes\" option is checked, and using the Mail app I can see my notes under the \"iCloud\" folder. However, these notes do not appear when I open the Notes app on the iPhone.\nNow on my phone (3GS running iOS 5.1) I have on Settings > iCloud all options activated (including Mail and Notes). If I go to \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\" I also see there my iCloud account registered, and Notes is as well selected. In Settings > Notes I only get an option to select the Font.\nWhat am I missing? What should I do so that the Notes app on the iPhone is able to show my iCloud notes?\nUpdate: Probably related to this issue, I've noticed that even if the phone is set to sync with iCloud mail as well, it only \"sees\" my gmail and work accounts/inboxes, and not the iCloud inbox. What could be the problem?\n\nA: Nevermind, I managed to get it working following the advise of another discussion thread on the Apple forums; namely:\n\nSame thing happend to me on my 3gs, i went to Settings...iCloud...Delete Account\n  then signed in again to add it. The iCloud inbox was displayed afterwards.\n\nThis also fixed the problem of notes, which now show up properly on the notes application.\n\nA: On your iPhone, when you are showing the list of notes: It says \"Accounts\" on the top left. Tap an see what you have in the iCloud account and what you have in local accounts.\nIf you want to avoid deleting the iCloud account, you can copy the contents one by one from the local (on my iPhone) to the iCloud one.\nOn the other hand, if you are willing to delete an reactivate the iCloud account, make sure to merge the local and the iCloud contents.\nFor me, it was just one file that really mattered, so I did the copy paste described above.d\n\nA: You can reset your iCloud documents (without deleting them nor losing data, I just did it).\nTo do so, log in into http://www.icloud.com using your Apple ID\nGo to the upper left button (the one with your name) and choose Account Settings\nClick on Reset documents data... button\nRestart your devices.\nRe-configure your iCloud preferences if they were not OK\nThat should do the trick\nSee also: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5824\n", "Q: Where can I cancel my newsstand subscriptions? I recently subscribed to a newsstand magazine. The confirmation e-mail stated that my subscription will be renewed automatically. I don't want this, but I can't find the option to turn this off. It's not under 'Purchases'...\nSo where can I manage my subscriptions? Is there a generic way to do this in the iTunes store?\n\nA: Go to Settings then choose Store.  There you will find a list of your current subscriptions, which you can turn to \"off\" if you no longer wish to subscribe to a given product.\nSome users have indicated that there are still issues, such as unsubscribing, then going back into settings --> store and finding they are still subscribed, but this seems to be rare, and I expect it will be resolved.\nThere are also usually contact options to reach the developer of the product in the newstand store, just like contact options in the app store.  You can contact the developer directly for support if their app doesn't seem to be successfully unsubscribing.\nMost newstand subscriptions should have an interface to unsubscribe in the app itself, or under the app in Settings.  \nDue to the way subscriptions work in the App Store, though, a developer would have to add a non-recurring subscription option to their app.  I imagine most won't - they will only offer their subscriptions under the app store's auto-renewal process.\nYou should contact the developers directly if you wish them to add a non-recurring purchase option.\n\nA: You can also use a service called BillNina.com to cancel iTunes and other subscriptions.\n", "Q: What fingers do I need to use for hitting Control, Option and Command buttons on Apple keyboard?

My left index finger hits V.\n⌘+Shift+V: Same as above, except my left pinky presses the left Shift key instead of the left ⌥ key.\n⌥-Shift-←: My left thumb rests on the left ⌘ key. I use my left pinky to hit the left Shift. I use my right index finger to press ←.\n⌘+Space: I use this shortcut a lot, to open apps using Spotlight. My left middle finger hits ⌘ and my left index finger presses Space.\n⌥+Space: Left ring finger hits ⌥, left index finger hits Space.\n\nA: There is no default way or the right way and whatever you're comfortable with at present should be fine. However, using crazy combinations can give you an injury worse than an emacs pinky, so it might be worthwhile to check what others use. Here's what I do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Left thumb for the left ⌘\n\n*Left middle finger for the left ⌥\n\n*Left ring finger for ⌃\n\n*Pinky for the left Shift\n\n*Pinky for fn\nFor simple modifier + one key combinations, I use the modifier key in the appropriate half of the keyboard. While it's still thumbs for the ⌘ keys, I find it easier to pivot about the ring finger for ⌥. \n\nA: I think using Cmd-X for cutting/pasting is better for a number of reasons.\n\n\n*\n\n*It's easier to keep your hand in default position on the left side and available for other functions like Cmd-Tab.\n\n*The Cmd-Opt-V command is more cumbersome for your hand to use for cut/paste because you have to crunch your hand over (poor ergonomics) and move your left fingers out of default position (inconvenient).\n\n*The Cmd-Opt-V is not consistent with text editing applications. So everything else is Cmd-X (word, text edit, mail, ical), but then when you switch to finder it changes?!\n\n", "Q: Kill ITunes Splash Screen After selecting \"music\" and listennig to an album, every time I wake my IPad3, there is a giant album-cover splash screen which remains until I unlock the IPad.  I really don't like that.  How do I convince the IPad to cease and desist with album-cover art when I'm waking it?\nI don't mind looking at album-cover art, but only when I'm explicitly running the built-in music app.   Perhaps I just need to shut down the music app?  Is there a way to do this (to shut down an app)?\n\nA: You can fully close an app double tapping HOME to get the recent apps list (note that unless you are at the home screen, the currently running app won't be listed) and then tap and holding on any App icon until you get the wiggles - at this point hit the minus sign against any app in your recent list.  This will either stop the app, if it is currently performing any background task, or remove the 'fast resume' saved state so that upon the next start it will not resume where it left off.\n", "Q: Will I receive texts after turning send as SMS off?

In particular, it very often freezes when plugging it into the stereo (USB mode) to charge, or when unplugging it. I simply reboot it (or reset, as Apple like to say) by holding down the play and menu buttons, and then all is well.\nRecently (in the last couple of weeks) the iPod started to reset certain settings whenever it froze and had to be rebooted. After every reboot it would ask for the language to be set - something it never used to do - and it also sometimes reset other settings; such as enabling the clicking sound when scrolling.\nThe Problem\nYesterday, I plugged the iPod into my MacBook Pro (Late 2008, OS X Lion 10.7.2, iTunes 10.5.3), to transfer (I manage the iPod manually rather than with auto sync) some new music from my iTunes library.\nWhen I finished, I ejected the iPod from within iTunes, as usual, and then unplugged the iPod when it told me it was ok to do so.\nRather than going straight to the music screen, as usual, the iPod rebooted (reset) itself. As I mentioned above, the iPod is sometimes a little strange about rebooting so I didn't think anything was strange. But...\nWhen the iPod came on again, it had no music on it! Nothing. It appeared to be empty. Looking in the Settings->About screen, I could see that in fact the amount of space corresponding to my files was still being used - the hard drive hadn't been wiped, but rather the data, or the iPod's database, had presumably become corrupted in some way.\nFortunately I have all of my music on my Mac in my iTunes libraray, so this wasn't a total disaster. I thought I'd simply have to restore the iPod to factory settings and then put all my music back on. How naïve of me. I should know better.\nWhen I plugged the iPod back into the computer, it didn't appear in iTunes. After some time, it appeared in the Finder, and iTunes froze. Ejecting the iPod took ages, and looking at it with Disk Utility caused Disk Utility to freeze. Odd.\nI also tried opening exPod, just to see if it would work - but no; it also froze.\nNo combination of rebooting the iPod and computer, relaunching iTunes, etc, would make the iPod show up in iTunes.\nTrying To Fix It\nThe first thing I tried was the iPod's built-in diagnostics, started by pressing menu+left whilst booting. But it couldn't find anything wrong.\nI also tried starting the iPod in disk mode - it didn't help.\nAfter everything else I could think of - including everything in Apple's awful support site, and failing to find anything relevant via Google - I eventually resorted to this technique (reformatting the iPod with Disk Utility), supposedly \"The Super Fix for Most iPod Problems\".\nActually I wasn't able to reformat the disk from Disk Utility, due to POSIX permissions errors, but I did eventually manage to format it from the Terminal using diskutil. And before you ask, I used the Extended Journaled format, with Apple Partition Map - as the iPod was previously.\nAnd this fixed the not showing up in iTunes problem - I was able to restore the iPod from iTunes, and then add some music to it.\nBut guess what? Right. When I ejected it, it did exactly the same thing as before: the music all \"disappeared\", and the iPod wouldn't show up in iTunes.\nMore Attempts At Fixing It\nWell, as you can guess, I was getting pretty fed up by now... But what could I do but keep on trying?\nMy next step was to format the hard drive as FAT32, from Disk Utility, and then initialise the iPod from iTunes as if it were a new iPod. This resulted in iTunes identifying the iPod as a Windows iPod, though in fact I had never connected it to Windows.\nNow I tried adding content again, and this time, it actually worked! When I disconnected my iPod after adding one album to it, the album stayed on it!\nPhew. Problem solved, I thought. Me being naïve again...\nSo, I proceeded to copy a few tens of gigabytes of music to the iPod, then I disconnected it - and we were back with the same old problem. F*ck. :'(\nSo, my final brainwave (well, maybe not...) was to actually format the iPod from Windows, via Parallels.\nUnfortunately, I was unable to make iTunes on Windows download and install the firmware, but I did the next best thing. Just like above, I formatted the iPod as FAT32 from Disk Utility and then initialised the iPod from iTunes on OS X, resulting in an apparently \"Windows-format\" iPod, and then instead of adding music from my Mac, I connected it to Windows and added music from there.\nSo far (touch wood) I haven't had the problem when disconnecting from Windows.\nSo, I'm assuming this is a problem on my Mac (ie, in OS X) rather than on my iPod. UPDATE: I have now had the same problem on Windows, so I guess this is an iPod problem.\nSummary\nSo, to summarise the problem and the step sI've taken to solve it:\n\n*\n\n*When disconnecting the iPod from my Mac (after ejecting from iTunes) the iPod thinks there is no music on it.\n\n*When connecting the iPod to the computer again after this, it doesn't usually show up in iTunes. Occasionally it does show up, and iTunes says it is corrupted and needs to be reset.\n\n*Formatting the iPod from Disk Utility and then restoring, or simply initialising, the iPod from iTunes doesn't solve the problem - it makes the iPod show up in iTunes again, but the problem occurs again as soon as I disconnect the iPod again.\n\n*It doesn't make any difference if I format the iPod as HFS+ Extended Journaled or as FAT32.\n\n*Managing the iPod from Windows, however, seems (tentatively; ie thus far) not to cause the problem.\nUPDATE: I have now reproduced the same problem via Windows.\n\nSo, what is the problem?\nSo, based on all the above, it looks like probably a problem in OS X. But I haven't been able to find out where the problem would be, or even for sure if it is an OS X problem.\nI'd tentatively guess that it might be a problem with /System/Library/Extensions/iPodDriver.kext, but I don't know how I can check that (removing iPodDriver.kext stops the iPod from showing up in iTunes at all, and I don't know where I can get a \"clean\" iPodDriver.kext to replace it with).\nUPDATE: I have now had the same problem on Windows, so I guess this is an iPod problem.\nIf anyone has any ideas, or can point me in the right direction, I'd be really grateful. I've reached the end of my troubleshooting abilities, and am at a lost end as to what else I can try.\nOh, and thanks for getting to the end of my monumentally long post! :-D\nSystem Info\nMac:\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro, Late 2008\n\n*OS X Lion 10.7.2\n\n*iTunes 10.5.3 (yes, I know there is a newer version. I'm trying to download it, but havent had good enough internet yet)\n\niPod:\n\n*\n\n*Firmware 2.0.4 (latest version)\n\n*Model MC293\n\n\nA: I have an alternative take on this problem:\nI have just bought a Classic 160 Gb at Amazon few weeks ago and I have been facing the same issues as you.\nI do not use Mac OS X, nor iTunes to sync. I run Linux and I use Media Monkey on a Windows VirtualBox Machine.\nDuring the past two weeks I have tried everything that I could find. iTunes have not even been able to read my entire collection (strange, right?)\nMy findings\nI have just restored the iPod firmware a few minutes ago. Started MediaMonkey and sync'd 10 songs from an ordinary random artist. Disconnected and the songs were there, nice. So the iPod is actually working. So far, so good, I have figured that out before.\nHowever, in the meantime, while I was checking my library, I recalled that I have some songs from Japanese bands with Japanese characters in their names. Historically, this would be very error prone. So I did gave it a try, and sync'd 64 songs from that band. Disconnected the iPod and the songs were all gone.\nSo apparently the 2.0.4 firmware does not handle these characters very well. Check your library, make smaller tests. I am about to restore the iPod again and will try to sync some more files with normal ASCII characters. Will update you.\nMy old, now dead (waiting for a new disk), iPod, running 1.0.2 was able to hold those files nicely.\n\nA: Given your problems, I think it's extremely unlikely that this is a problem with Mac OS X, even though you haven't yet reproduced the same error with Windows. While not beyond the realm of possibility, it seems extremely unlikely that a failure in Mac OS X would only affect one device, and in such a specific way.\nYou mention you bought this just under a year ago. If so then it's still under warranty. I suggest returning it to Apple and getting it replaced, it sounds like you've having serious problems with this device. Describe the problems you're having, or, if you can, demonstrate it to them, and they'll most likely replace it.\nThe only reason I can think why they would not is that you mentioned you use this device on a boat - if it got splashed, that would be considered \"liquid damage\" and is not covered by the warranty.\n\nA: For what it's worth; this eventually turned out to be a hard disk issue.\nI had the hard disk replaced and it has performed fine since.\nI must say, I am still surprised that a hard drive issue could have these particular symptoms. I, and various people I showed it to, thought it must be a logic board problem.\n\nA: So i was having the same problem over and over again after using the Erase thing. So I read your whole thing in frustration and tried things til it worked for me. And my solution might be something you've essentially tried, but I might as well tell you cuz I had thought I'd done this too.\nPut your iPod in DISK MODE and connect to disk utility, then erase it.\nUnplug it.\nPlug it back into iTunes, restore it. Eject it after it's all restored and updated.\nPlug it again and add something small.\nThe key for me was I had \"Formatt[ed] the iPod from Disk Utility and then restor[ed], or simply initialize[ed]\" like you did, but it wasn't in Disk Mode when i did it. So i added a whole library, and it I thought it had worked (the whole reason I had \"erased\" it was cuz it would freeze every time it synced) - but then I saw nada. \nHope this works for you!\nHere are the instructions again so you don't miss anything. \n\nA: I've had similar problems to the OP with my iPod Classic 7th gen which I upgraded to a 128GB Kingspec SSD (beware, the 6th/7th gen Classic is a bitch to open!).  On connecting to Windows it went into a 'restore' loop or iTunes just wouldn't recognise the iPod at all.\nThe way I got around this was to format first on a mac then did the restore on Windows (message 'this is a Mac-formatted iPod, please restore' or something similar).  Restore and sync then went through fine and the machine worked perfectly \nBUT a couple of days later, following an iTunes sync I then got exactly the same problem as the OP.  The iPod turned on fine but although it showed the right memory allocated there was no content.\nRecovery mode and restore didn't work (as before) so I went back to restore on the mac then on to PC where I was eventually successful after a couple of false starts.\nSo I'm wondering if this is something to do with compatibility with the SSD HDD.  I also have an iPod Video 5.5th generation which I've fitted with a 128GB half-size SSD (super light, fast and very easy to fit).  It restored and synced first time - I'll report back if I get any issues.\n\nA: I have a 5yo ipod 160GB. It has >11,000 songs & 291 movies. It had your same problem when I didnt eject my ipod prior to disconnecting from itunes. I reconnected to itunes that night , ejected then it the songs, playlist & movies came back. I listened to music the next 2 days. I bought music from the itune store from my iphone then i tried to put them in the ipod via itunes who sync'ed the new album from icloud. While i was dragging the album to my ipod, it registered that it was disconnected then the ipod displayed Connected, eject before disconnecting. Upon soft reset, the ipod said no music nor movies. I tried to hook back to itunes, all songs & movies are there & can even play in the itunes. But it wont eject right and will just spontaneously disconnect, ipod hanged with the dont disconnect display , soft reset will just display no music everytime. \nSaw all your stories & tricks that didnt work. Our local mac expert recommended to restore the ipod. I did not coz it will remove all my hard work. I just reconnected the ipod to the itunes and patiently waited for the eject icon to appear. Mind you that it was a 3 minute wait like a dial-up internet. This time, it showed ipod updating even if the IOS is up to date. The ipod icon disappeared in the desktop but the ipod display is still eject prior to disconnecting. I did a soft reset again & this time, the apple icon on the ipod displayed longer than usual. And viola, the songs, playlist & movies are back in the ipod display!\nI dont know which worked.  I just tried to be patient and hoped for the best. \nIt worked! I would never connect the ipod to the itunes again!\n\nA: i have purchased a new ipod classic 160gb as i thought my old one had a malfunction. My new one has the same problem i have also tried two different laptops so its obviously not an ipod problem or laptop problem\n", "Q: What does each cellular connectivity indicator mean? I'm used to \"3G\" and \"E\" on my AT&T iPhone 3GS, and I understand I may see \"4G\" on my new iPad when I enter a 4G area.\nHowever, I recently saw \"o\" on the new Verizon iPad, and had no idea what it meant.\nWhat network connectivity indicators can I expect to see on my iOS devices, and what do they generally mean?\nAre the connectivity indicators the same for all iOS devices (with expected carrier differences) or should I assume \"3G\" on the 1st gen iPad means something different than \"3G\" on the new iPad?\n\nA: The \"o\" means that you're on a 2G network. In Verizon's case, that would be 1xRTT. If you see it on an AT&T device, that means you're on GPRS.\nHere's a screenshot from the iPad User Guide detailing what the various signal indicators mean:\n\n\"3G\" means exactly the same thing on the 1st generation iPad as it does on the 3rd generation iPad. However, if you have AT&T, the 3rd generation iPad reports HSDPA+ as \"4G\". Since the 1st generation iPad is incapable of using HSDPA+, you will only ever see 3G or below on that device.\n\nA: On CDMA networks, the ° symbol means that you're connected to a 1xRTT network. You might not be able to receive calls while transferring data over the network. On GSM networks, it means that you're connected to a GPRS network. \nThis Apple support article goes into further detail on possible connectivity indicators for different cellular networks. For your case:\n\n", "Q: Is there an app that allows users to create a map from an image? I come from Android and one of the little apps I used to use that was very handy was Custom Maps.\nIt allows you to create a map from any image by selecting a few points on the image and defining their location.\nIs there an app in the App store that allows this?\n\nA: TomTom calls this feature Map Overlays, but their iPhone app doesn't support it.\nGarmin calls this feature Custom Maps, but their iPhone app doesn't support it either.\nThe only app I found that supports this feature is MakkaMappa ($1, or free lite version). Basically you upload an image to their website, then you use this application to view the map with your location shown on it.\nFrom the app description:\n\nOnce you've uploaded your map to the website, use this app to view the map on your iPhone. Even better, go to the location the map represents, and view it there. You'll be amazed when you see your position correctly shown on the map, no matter how much the map is stretched or squashed compared to the geographic space it represents. You won't need a data connection to view maps – great if you're going abroad.\n\n\n", "Q: Overheating problem and reduced charge A few days ago I noticed my iPhone is overheating and after a few minutes its charge was reduced to 18% from 80% while I only read some texts during that period. What's the problem?\nI did find over a thousand responses to this question from Google results but I don't know which one is correct. \n\nA: When this has happened on my 3GS I would reboot it just in case.\nI've never determined the cause, but it does appear to heavily use the cellular radio and the CPU to maximum power, both of which generate significant heat and reduce the battery charge significantly.\nSince it happened so rarely - perhaps a few times a year - I assumed it was some weird iOS glitch and I chose not to pursue it any further.\nIf it's happening to you more than a few times a year, though, I'd take it in and have it replaced.\n\nA: Sounds like faulty hardware (battery or device itself).  There never a reason for that to happen.\n\nA: Restore the software a set up as new, ie. blank and retest. \n", "Q: Monitoring the Mac App Store for free applications? I use freeappalert to find iOS apps that were made free each day.  I'm not interested in apps that are already free, just those that recently became free.\nI haven't found anything similar for the Mac App store yet.  Is there a similar service or way to find Mac apps on sale for free that normally cost something?\n\nA: You could use AppShopper to be notified of discounts of specific apps you are looking for. AppShopper works with iOS apps as well as Mac App Store apps. You can have it email you when a price changes, or you can install one of their iOS clients and have a push notification sent to you.\nThe nice thing about it is that you don't have to have the app running (or remember to run the app once a day) in order to be notified of price changes; it just sends you alerts whenever something happens.\nIf you are specifically looking for free apps, you can setup the email feature and then add a rule which deletes emails from AppShopper which don't contain \"free\" in their subject.\n\nA: I've been using Store News to get this very same information.\nThe filtering and categories make it easy to setup saved searches that cut the results down to just applications and application types you're interested in monitoring. The UI is nicely aligned with the Mac App Store as well, which is what drew me to it in the first place.\n\n", "Q: Generating and collaborating on network map diagrams? I have to turn out some network topology maps for very large networks. I'd like the format for the maps to be something other people can also edit and contribute to regardless of what software I'm using on my Mac to build them. I don't mind spending money on my end for software, but I can't require that my clients spend any money. I also can't promise my clients are also using OS X -- they could be running Linux or Windows.\nIs there best software application on OS X for producing maps that I can share with other, non-OS X, users?\nIs there a best format for sharing topology maps that I should use when exporting the maps to disk?\n\nA: Graphviz should do the trick. It uses a text file in a markup language called dot.  I believe there are a number of apps on the Mac that can create and export/import that format, but otherwise it's a plain text format and can be edited with any text editor. \n\nA: Google Drawing lets you easily upload and import other graphics and is cross-platform and free.\n", "Q: How can I make OS X recognize new file extensions? In Finder.app, you can hit Enter to edit the name of the currently selected file or folder.\nOS X will automatically select only the file name part, not the extension:\n\nThis is very useful, because that way you can just start typing the new name, without worrying about accidentally changing the file extension.\nHowever, this only seems to work for “known” file types. If you try it with an unknown extension, the whole file name (including the extension) gets selected:\n\nI tried mapping an application that can open all .bar files via ⌘+I → “Change All”, but I still get the behavior described above.\nWhere is the list of “known” file types stored? Is there a way to make OS X recognize new file types?\n\nA: This SuperUser post worked for me:\n\nYou need to browse to the application that you’d like to use to open these files, and edit its bundle. Right-click the application to handle these file extensions and select Show Package Contents. Navigate to Contents, and edit Info.plist. You might need Property List Editor, which is part of Apple’s developer tools. If you’re lucky, it’s in XML format. Edit this file’s CFBundleDocumentTypes and add an entry for the extension that you want.\n\nI used TextEdit as the default application to open .bar files. The only thing I did differently was change the XML that went in TextEdit’s Info.plist to:\n    <dict>\n        <key>CFBundleTypeExtensions</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>bar</string>\n        </array>\n        <key>CFBundleTypeIconFile</key>\n        <string>BarDocument</string>\n        <key>CFBundleTypeName</key>\n        <string>Bar Document</string>\n        <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>\n        <string>Document</string>\n    </dict>\n\n…and then I used LSRefresh.app to refresh TextEdit in the launch services database. Then it worked as you suggested, although it will probably break the code signature of Textedit (and any other signed application) on Lion.\n\nA: UTIs and Launch Services\n\nWhere is the list of “known” file types stored?\n\nThe official term for \"file types\" is\nUniform Type Identifiers\n(UTIs), and the database of UTIs is maintained by\nLaunch Services.\nUsing the Terminal,\nyou can view the contents of the Launch Services database using the lsregister tool, which is stored at:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister\n\nInstead of specifying that long path every time you want to run lsregister, you can temporarily add its directory to your PATH:\nPATH=/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support:\"$PATH\"\n\nand then you can run lsregister by simply entering:\nlsregister\n\nTo view the contents of the Launch Services database:\nlsregister -dump\n\n\nDeclaring New UTIs\n\nIs there a way to make OS X recognize new file types?\n\nThis Apple article,\n\"Declaring New Uniform Type Identifiers\",\nprovides useful information on how to do this. Here's the complete process:\n1. Create a dummy application\nCreate a dummy application to register with Launch Services:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open AppleScript Editor (located in OS X's Utilities folder).\n\n*Save a new empty script somewhere (eg: on your Desktop), setting its File Format to Application.\n\n\n2. Open its Info.plist file\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate your new dummy application in the Finder.\n\n*Right-click on it, and select Show Package Contents from the popup menu.\n\n*Open its Contents folder.\n\n*Open the Info.plist file in a text editor (eg: TextEdit).\n\n\n3. Add your new UTI\nThere's a choice of two keys:\n\n\n*\n\n*UTExportedTypeDeclarations – for your own custom filename extensions.\n\n*UTImportedTypeDeclarations – for filename extensions which already exist but aren't recognised by OS X.\n\n\nChoose the key which is most appropriate for your needs.\nThen in the Info.plist file, before the final two lines (</dict></plist>), add this code:\n<key>KEY</key>\n<array>\n    <dict>\n        <key>UTTypeIdentifier</key>\n        <string>IDENTIFIER</string>\n        <key>UTTypeTagSpecification</key>\n        <dict>\n            <key>public.filename-extension</key>\n            <array>\n                <string>EXTENSION</string>\n            </array>\n        </dict>\n    </dict>\n</array>\n\nmaking the following changes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace KEY with your chosen key (either UTExportedTypeDeclarations or UTImportedTypeDeclarations).\n\n*Replace IDENTIFIER with a suitable reverse-DNS identifier:\n\n*\n\n*Exported – Something like com.mycompany.mytype\n\n*Imported – For id Software's\nDoom WAD format, a suitable identifier would be com.idsoftware.wad\n\n\n*Replace EXTENSION with the filename extension (without the leading dot), eg: wad.\n\n\nThis is the minimum code necessary for Launch Services to accept your new UTI.\nYou can also add the following optional properties:\n\n\n*\n\n*UTTypeConformsTo – See the Appendix below.\n\n*UTTypeDescription – A user-visible description, which will be displayed in the Finder.\n\n*UTTypeIconFile – If you add an Apple Icon Image\nfile to the Contents/Resources folder in your dummy application, and add its filename in this property,\nthen files which have your new filename extension will use this icon.\n\n*UTTypeReferenceURL – The URL of a reference document describing this type.\n\n\nHere's a complete example showing all the optional properties:\n<key>UTImportedTypeDeclarations</key>\n<array>\n    <dict>\n        <key>UTTypeIdentifier</key>\n        <string>com.idsoftware.wad</string>\n        <key>UTTypeTagSpecification</key>\n        <dict>\n            <key>public.filename-extension</key>\n            <array>\n                <string>wad</string>\n            </array>\n        </dict>\n        <key>UTTypeConformsTo</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>public.data</string>\n        </array>\n        <key>UTTypeDescription</key>\n        <string>Doom WAD file</string>\n        <key>UTTypeIconFile</key>\n        <string>DoomWAD.icns</string>\n        <key>UTTypeReferenceURL</key>\n        <string>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_WAD</string>\n    </dict>\n</array>\n\n4. Register your new UTI with Launch Services\nRun this command in the Terminal:\nlsregister <PATH_TO_APP>\n\nreplacing <PATH_TO_APP> with the path to your dummy application, eg:\nlsregister ~/Desktop/MyDummyApp.app\n\nIf you now create a file with your new filename extension, and then select it in the Finder\nand hit Enter, the Finder should automatically select only the filename part, not the extension.\nIf you view the contents of the Launch Services database:\nlsregister -dump\n\nyou should find your new UTI listed:\ntype    id:            50364\n        bindableKey:   12608\n        generation:    1\n        uti:           com.idsoftware.wad\n        description:   Doom WAD file\n        flags:         imported  active  apple-internal  untrusted\n        icon:          DoomWAD.icns\n        conforms to:   public.data\n        tags:          .wad\n\nIf you later want to unregister your new UTI, pass the -u option to lsregister:\nlsregister -u ~/Desktop/MyDummyApp.app\n\n\nAppendix: UTI hierarchy and conformance\nOS X declares a hierarchy of UTIs which are listed here:\nSystem-Declared Uniform Type Identifiers.\nHere are a few UTIs in the hierarchy:\n\n\n*\n\n*public.content\n\n*\n\n*public.text\n\n*\n\n*public.rtf\n\n*public.html\n\n*public.xml\n\n*public.plain-text\n\n*public.source-code\n\n*\n\n*public.c-source\n\n*public.c-header\n\n*com.sun.java-source\n\n\n\n*public.image\n\n*\n\n*public.jpeg\n\n*public.tiff\n\n*public.png\n\n\n*public.audiovisual-content\n\n*\n\n*public.movie\n\n*public.audio\nEach UTI \"conforms to\" its parent UTI:\n\nFor example, the UTI public.html, which defines HTML text, conforms to the\n  base text identifier, public.text. In this case, conformance lets applications\n  that can open general text files identify HTML files as ones it can open as well.\n  (ref)\n\nWhen creating a new UTI, it's a good idea to set the UTTypeConformsTo property to one\nof the existing UTIs.\nFor example, if your new UTI is a type of source code,\nthen you should set the UTTypeConformsTo property to public.source-code,\nso that it can be opened by any applications which can open\npublic.source-code or public.plain-text or public.text files.\n\nA: Follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the file with unrecognized extension (say, .txt).\n\n*Right click and select Get Info or use the keyboard shortcut Commandi to display the information window.\n\n*Click on the disclosure indicator besides Open with: to open detailed view. Select the desired app from the drop down. This will associate the document with the chosen application (For e.g. TextEdit).\n\n*Click on the Change All... button. It will first show a dialogue box asking to confirm your intent and will link all .txt documents to open with TextEdit, and leave the extension un-selected when you hit return on the document's name.\n", "Q: Why does the wireless disconnect when cooking? I use a unibody Mac laptop to read recipes or listen to music while in the kitchen. The wireless disconnects sometimes. How can I prevent this?\n\nA: When you are running the microwave oven, your wireless network may sometimes be disrupted enough to disconnect until the microwave finishes cooking.\nIf it happens at other times, another electrical appliance may be creating enough interference to cause a disconnect.  For instance, if your laptop is too close to an induction cooktop, or to a particularly old high power blender, such as an old vita-mix.  Older generation applicances aften do not follow the latest EMC and FCC standards for electromagnetic noise and radiation, and older devices with electrical motors often produce a significant amount of noise due to old brushes.\nNarrow down which appliance is the problem by trying them out one at a time and seeing which one causes the disconnection.\nIf it's the microwave, you can try relocating the laptop or wireless router, but a new microwave will probably have the same issue.\nI resolved the issue in my home by installing a wireless router capable of the 802.11a or 802.11n band, which run at 5GHz, which the microwave does not conflict with.  Make sure your Mac supports 802.11a or n before trying this.\nIf it's another appliance, you should be able to resolve the problem by replacing the appliance.\nYou may also find good results by moving your laptop to another area in the kitchen away from the problem appliance, and letting it run on battery power, since some of these emissions can be carried over the AC wiring.  A higher power or more recent router may also resolve the problem, as well as relocating the router closer to the kitchen.\n\nA: This really has nothing to do with unibody or Macs, but is rather due to physics. I'm guessing that you're cooking using a microwave oven or have it running nearby when you're using your laptop.\nThe 802.11b WLANs operate in the 2.4 GHz band. Unfortunately, microwave signals also fall in the same frequency band, and hence can cause interference with your wireless signal. If the interference is too high (depending on how your home is setup, how close the microwave oven is, etc.), your receiver can drop the connection.\nAn alternative to this would be to use a routing device that uses 802.11a. This operates at 5 GHz, which is outside the interference band and you won't notice this problem. However, the drawback is that since it's higher it frequency, it attenuates faster. This means that it will not travel as far as the 802.11b and will not penetrate through walls, etc. So if you have a big house, this might not be feasible unless if you want to set up multiple hotspots. From the linked wiki article:\n\nSince the 2.4 GHz band is heavily used to the point of being crowded, using the relatively unused 5 GHz band gives 802.11a a significant advantage. However, this high carrier frequency also brings a disadvantage: the effective overall range of 802.11a is less than that of 802.11b/g.In theory, 802.11a signals are absorbed more readily by walls and other solid objects in their path due to their smaller wavelength and, as a result, cannot penetrate as far as those of 802.11b.\n\n\nYou can also programmatically test this. You can get your wireless details from the command line with \n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I\n\nThe entries corresponding to agrCtlRSSI and agrCtlNoise will give you the strength of the signal and interference respectively. Here's what a quick experiment in my house shows (explanation follows):\n\nIn the figure, you can see the change in wireless signal strength and interference as I walk from near the router (at time 0) into the room farthest away. The point to note here is that signal decreases, but noise background remains at the same level. \nThen I return to the dining (next to the kitchen) and turn the microwave on for a minute (highlighted time periods). You can see how the interference increases and is higher in the next trial, when I move it to the kitchen (but not near the microwave). Note that these levels are in decibels, which means that a 3dB increase implies a doubling of interference.\nThe third time, I put it right next to the microwave and my laptop dropped the signal because the interference was just way too high. You can get a glimpse of how high it was, when you see it drop down to normal levels after turning the microwave off. All this while, the signal strength remained the same. \nSummary: Your kitchen appliances are interfering with your signal and if you happened to be far enough from the router that your signal levels are also low, you can experience difficulties even without being that close to the appliance.\n\nObligatory XKCD:\n\n\n'Cheater!' 'Hey, gaming on wifi? You have only yourself to blame.'\n\n\nA: Simple Version of the other answers:\nYou're kitchen appliances' microwaves are jamming the Wi-Fi from your router and preventing it from getting to your mac.\n\nA: I got mad today and started to test my microwave. I just placed 2 baking plate on the top of microwave like one covering backside and another covering right side gap because my microwave is placed in the corner of kitchen. So I just covered the gap on the top 2 sides only. I started to heat my coffee for 1 min and I do see this worked and did not disconnect my wireless connection.\nI again did the test one more time to make sure it works and worked. So my conclusion is that you need to shield your microwave is the simple solution.\n\nA: Yep, the Microwave is interfering with the WiFi. If you have an Apple Time Capsule, you can use the 5GHz Network, or Broadcast either 2.4GHZ or 5GHz on another Channel. Please note that Cordless Phones and Other Devices can also interfere with your WiFi. It's also important to note the Hardware on the Network--what Wireless Signal Standard they have (a/b/g/n/ac), and what the Neighbors have that could also be a factor.\n", "Q: Installing Xcode with iOS 4.3 device simulator? I installed Xcode 4.3.1 two days ago. I need to access the iOS 4.3 device simulator, but it is not available in the new Xcode. So I went to Xcode > Preferences > Download (tab) and downloaded the Xcode 4.3.1 developer library and the iOS 5.1 library, hoping I could add the 4.3 simulator. \nBut, this hasn't worked. So far I haven't got the 4.3 simulator installed on my Xcode. What is the solution for this?\n\nA: The option to download iOS 4.3 simulator is available from within Xcode. You can find it under Preferences > Downloads. Just click on \"Install\" and you might have to enter your Apple ID credentials.\n\nIf you don't see this option, you could try removing your older versions of Xcode and installing the latest one from the Appstore. My version is 4.3.2.\n\nA: The iOS Simulator app can be found here if it’s installed correctly:\n/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Applications/iPhone Simulator.app\n\nOr here:\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Applications/iPhone Simulator.app\n\nTry a Spotlight search for “Simulator” to make sure the installation actually failed, before you try anything else.\n\nA: In the iPhone Simulator, select required iOS version (4.3.2) from Hardware > Version menu.\n", "Q: Invisible App Store updates Nearly every time I see updates available on my iPhone (4,  iOS 5.1) whilst browsing the app store, the list of updates is empty even when the badge says there are some.\nSelecting update all will successfully do the updates, but I have no idea what was updated without hunting them down as they download.\nIs this a common issue? Is there a known fix or workaround?\nIn the first screenshot is the \"loading screen\" for want of a better description.  It consists of the the central information nugget, and the spinner in the top bar.  When this completes, the available updates should then show.\n\nHowever, more often than not, I get the following:\n\nCurious variation in background shading also I just noticed, but the darker screenshot is older, and might be from iOS 5.0.1\n\nA: It shouldn't display a blank screen.  It should either display \"Loading...\" or \"All apps are up to date.\" or a list of apps that have an update available.\nI've only seen this happen when I had a good internet connection when I opened the app store and started \"Loading...\" but lost the connection before it was done loading. I don't recall if it happens when switching from wifi to cellular or back during the loading stage, but I suspect it might.\nI have hundreds of apps on my 3GS, though, and it can take quite awhile to go from \"Loading...\" to a list, or to the \"up to date\" notice.\nIt can also happen if you experience a temporary internet glitch during loading, such as if you are close to a microwave, using an 802.11b/g network, while the microwave is running.\nIt shouldn't happen when you know you've got a good internet connection and the connection state doesn't change during loading.  I suppose it could happen on a particularly busy network if significant numbers of packets are being dropped.\nIf it happens consistently, I'd try rebooting, then a system refresh, then taking it to apple in that order.\nThe app store is one thing that doesn't seem particularly robust in the face of network disruptions, so that's what I'd suspect first.  If you're experiencing frequent network disruptions in other apps as well, you might have an iOS or hardware problem, and it might be worth a visit the apple store anyway.\n\nA: I've had these symptoms occasionally.  I usually see this when my internet connection is slow or congested. I also have apps from multiple App Store Apple ID's, which may account for some of these issues.\nWhenever I've seen this, I usually close the app, and then manually kill the running App Store application in the multitasking bar.\nSo, while this behavior is not common, it is not unheard of nor is it a hardware problem.  The most likely scenario is that the app is waiting for a response from Apple's servers, and the connection may be stuck in a queue or have timed out.\n", "Q: Is there an app to quickly download and install a list of non-App Store apps? Now that the Mac App Store exists, if an app is available there I prefer to buy it there instead of on the developer's site. This has several advantages, but the one that I've been enjoying recently is the ability to sign into the store on a new or freshly wiped Mac, go through my list of purchases, and click \"Install\" next to each app I want to reinstall. Leave the computer for a bit, come back, and they're all installed and waiting for me in /Applications.\nHowever, there are a number of non-App Store apps that I like to reinstall as well. Some, like Transmission, would not be allowed in the App Store for rule violations, and others, like VLC, are kept out because of license issues. Is there an app that I can use that acts similarly to the Mac App Store app, but allows me to quickly and easily download and install third-party apps?\nThere's a service for Windows and Linux called Ninite that seems to do this, but they don't appear to have a Mac version. Another possibility is AppBodega, but it doesn't seem to have the concept of an \"account\" so I'd have to still remember and hunt through the list of apps in the app.\n\nA: One solution could be to use Dropbox. Instead of installing your applications to the Applications folder, you can install them to the Dropbox folder instead. The only drawback is that some of the applications data may not be copied over unless you mess around with the settings and folders the data is stored in. However, this may not be an issue with applications that don't have many settings, such as VLC.\n\nA: MacUpdate may have the feature you are looking for. It has a list of over 30,000 Mac apps, VLC and Transmission are included. It helps you keep all your apps updated, and one of its features is download history. This may be an easy way to know which apps to reinstall on a new system.\nThe app is called MacUpdate Desktop, and it's $20/year.\n\nA: You can use:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://macapps.link/\n\n*http://0install.net/\n\n*getmacapps\n\n*dawt\n\n*calm\n\n\nI've used all 3 and they are in order from smaller/simpler to larger/more intensive with 0install being dependent on a Homebrew Installation.\nCheck them all out to find the best fit for your situation. Also I'd like to mention that although it isn't available on these sites (or even their own 3rd party build section for that matter), Pale Moon IS available for macs! It's tucked away in its own little forum on the main Pale Moon site. So, if you use Firefox or Waterfox, IMHO PMoon completely blows them away, and they have NO future plans to drop XUL Extensions.\n\nA: Take a look at HackStore.\n\nHackStore it is an amazing free alternative of App Store for side developers and apps for Mac OS which Apple doesnt accept.\n\nIf you're wondering about the name, read their FAQ.\n\nWhat the main purpose of HackStore?\nWe created HackStore at April 2012 and main purpose of HackStore is to be alternative home for developers and their apps, provide a best service app platform for our users, even better than AppStore.\nIn HackStore you can find thousands of unique apps and most of them are completely free.\nFurthermore we are against piracy. We are not related to piracy apps from Mac AppStore or any kind of “hacks” in the bad meaning of this word. As you may know, truth definition of world “hack” is “modification” so it is describing us perfectly! We believe that we can make this world better by creating useful app for smart developers and users.\n\n", "Q: Maximum memory for 2011 iMac I just bought an iMac and want to max out the memory on the machine. I have received two conflicting answers to my question so I'm bringing it to the community.\nCan I install 4 8GB memory chips for a total of 32GB? The technical specs say it supports up to 16GB (4x4GB) but it hasn't been updated since May 2011 and was wonder if a firmware update allows it to support my proposed configuration.\nThe iMac has an i7 processor.\n\nA: The technical specs sometimes quote an amount less than the actual maximum. Empirical observations (with the newer iMacs and MBPs), tells me that the true maximum is twice what Apple says. \nThe 27\" iMac can be extended to 32 GB, as mentioned in this article\n\nRAM: 4 GB, expandable to 16 GB (32 GB for 27\" model) using four 1333 MHz DDR3 SDRAM\n\nThis site also lets you up the RAM upto 32GB in a 27\" iMac, so if it wasn't possible, they wouldn't be in business. Note that these values can change with the model of your iMac, which you haven't mentioned. \n\nA: All 2011 iMacs will support 32GB unofficially except for the late 2011 iMac \"Core i3\" 3.1 21.5-Inch (MC978LL/A - iMac12,1 - A1311 - 2496) which appears to be capped by EFI at 8GB.\nYou can check out your specific iMac by finding it on this list, then checking out the RAM section:\nhttp://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/index-imac.html\nAlso, here's a list of the unofficial max ram support for every Apple computer since the G3:\nhttp://www.everymac.com/systems/by_capability/actual-maximum-ram-capacity-of-macs.html\nNote that Apple may update the EFI at any time and enforce it's stated maximum RAM, and of course Apple won't support going above the maximum RAM.\nAlso keep in mind that you have to match Apple's memory timing specifications for new memory very carefully.  I found with my Macbook Pro that getting \"close enough\" still resulted in an occasionally flaky system, and I had to not only get the correct memory speed, but the same timing for it to work.  That said, it does support twice as much memory as Apple states, and many people do find success adding more memory than apple recommends.\n\nA: If you have the 27\" iMac MacTracker says it supports up to 32GB, even though Apple only says it supports 16GB. The 21.5\" iMac can only support 8GB either way. OWC, a reputable memory retailer, started selling 32GB upgrade kits for the 2011 iMac last year.\n\n", "Q: Installing Barrel caused an issue which doesn't go away I installed and ran Barrel 2 on my iPhone and set the new effect. I also needed to move a group of apps and made my icons toggle. Then all my apps stopped working. I uninstalled it but the issue still remains. \nWhat should I do?\n\nA: If rebooting the phone didn't work, a system refresh using iTunes will certainly fix the problem.\nYou can try installing and then uninstalling Barrel again, in case the uninstall or original install failed at some point.  This should clean it back up.  But if it doesn't, then a clean reinstall of iOS will do it.\n", "Q: Emailing photos in iOS 5.0.1 I have been trying to send an email with a picture attached from the Photo app on my iPhone 3GS, but every time I hit the option button for the photo the app crashes. Its been frustrating. Does anyone know what is the problem?\n\nA: The problem can be in 1 of 2 areas.  Either there is a problem with the photograph, or it is a problem with your Mail setup.\nYou can test both areas, try sending a different photo, see if it works.  Or, try sharing the same photo via another mechanism, e.g. messages, or Twitter, see if that works.\nIf one of them fails, then that is your likely cuprit.  If they both work, then it's likely to be a little more nuanced and harder to track down!\n", "Q: Does autocorrect take into account an alternate keyboard layout? I notice that the autocorrect in Lion uses the character positions in order to suggest which correction to be made:\nFor example, if I type thst really fast, it will correct it to that but if I type thet, it corrects it to they.\nThis makes sense on a Qwerty keyboard, since the s is by the a, and the t is next to the y. However, it wouldn't make much sense on a different layout such as Dvorak.\nDoes Mac OS X Lion take into account which keyboard layout you are using and offer suggestions based on keys that are nearby the typo?\nWhat if I created an entirely new keyboard layout, and use that instead of a keyboard layout which comes with Lion?\n\nA: Apple has a patent on the autocorrect feature for mobile phones (and possibly for desktops as well). There was a lawsuit over iPhone vs Samsung autocorrect: http://gizmodo.com/5884179/apple-is-now-suing-samsung-over-autocorrect\n. Moving right along, apple's autocorrect does use keyboard layout to predict a replacement word: http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2010/07/yes_ill_matty_you.html . Lion will only try this feature if it can recognize the keyboard layout you are using based on a keyboard standard.\n", "Q: Only Getting Monochrome Output on TV I'm connecting a late-2006 MacBook Pro with the Apple DVI to Video adapter and an S-video cable (4 pins) to a high-end but outdated TV. Unfortunately, the output via the S-video cable seems to be only black and white, whether I'm using PAL or NTSC (the TV can switch). Via the composite video output and a S-video adaptor I can get color on the TV, but I'd like to get the pure S-video output, as the quality should be better. \nI've tried changing settings and of course restarting but haven't had any luck with this.\nIs there a setting I can change to get this to work, or is there some hardware restriction here?\nUPDATE: I can get color by changing some settings (NTSC/52 Hertz on Mac and TV, 1027 x 768 Resolution) but the picture is pulsating.\n\nA: You either have a bad adapter, cable, or TV. The S-Video standard separates the luma (dark to light) signal from the color signal. If only the luma signal is getting through, it will result in the picture being black and white. I suggest trying a different cable, and, if you have one available, a separate S-Video device. If both those work properly, your adapter has gone bad.\n\nA: It's likely that your adapter has failed, if you can get some distorted color, but not a steady, stable image.  Use the video output for now, and replace or the Apple DVI to Video adapter when you can.  \nThe pulsating output when you change some settings suggests that the filters the adapter uses to generate the color signal are failing or have failed and no longer correctly separate the signal.  If you never received color with any settings, then the s-video cable going to the TV could be suspect, but in this case you can probably lay the blame on the adapter.\nI would test with another cable, just in case it's a cable problem (intermittent connection, for instance) before replacing the adapter.\nBut at $20, the DVI to video adapter isn't a huge expense either.\n", "Q: Someone else's phone automatically shows up in my iTunes Someone else had updated their iPhone on my computer in the past, and now every time I open iTunes, it automatically shows their phone in the Device column and not my own (when neither their phone nor my phone is plugged into the computer). How can I stop this from happening? How can I make my friend's phone disappear from my iTunes completely? I have already wiped iTunes off my computer, and reinstalled it, but this problem still occurs. \n\nA: Eject the device.\n\n\nA: It sounds like your friend selected the 'sync this iPhone via Wi-Fi'-option.\nDoes your friend's iPhone always appear in your iTunes or does it only appear when your friend's iPhone is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer? If the latter is true your problem will be solved easily.\nClick on your friend's iPhone in the left column in iTunes > If not already selected, select the general tab > Scroll down. Among the options listed you should see a option called something like \"sync this iPhone via Wi-Fi\". (My iTunes is set in a different language.) Uncheck the checkbox next to this option. > In the lower right corner of iTunes click on \"Apply\" and then on \"synchronize\". > When your friends iPhone is done syncing, you can eject your friend's iPhone in the left column in iTunes.\nWarning: Depending on the syncing settings and options some of the data on his iPhone (music, apps,...) might get replaced with your music, apps, etc. in the process. So be careful there.\n\nA: I would try going to iTunes > Preferences > Devices, and deleting any backups of the other phone from there.\n", "Q: Lion Recovery with a Disk Wipe I would like to wipe my entire hard drive and reinstall Lion from scratch. I try to use the Lion Recovery tool but it does not wipe the disk so I still have all my installed programs that I don't want. I do not want to delete them by hand just want to do a clean install of the OS.\n\nA: I just did this yesterday, so it's still fresh in my mind. Make sure that when you restart your computer, you hold Cmd-R to enter recovery mode. Inside that, choose \"Disk Utility\" and there you can erase your Mac OSX partition. \n\nIf you do not do that and simply select \"Reinstall Mac OS X\", then it will not erase your drive, but just overwrite the parts that need to be overwritten.\nNote that you will not be able to erase the Lion recovery partition this way. All options to modify this partition are disabled in Disk Utility. There is really no need to wipe this, and erasing and formatting the main partition should be sufficient. \n\nA: Download and run the Lion Recovery Disk Assistant. This will let you put a bootable Lion installer on a USB stick. Then reboot, holding option, and select the USB drive you just created. You will then be able to completely wipe and repartition your internal drive and reinstall Lion.\n\nA: What methods are available to (re)install Lion on a Mac?\nCheck out this other Q:A, which details many ways of installing Lion, including creating media so that you can perform a clean install from a DVD, without needing to use the restore partition.\n", "Q: Can I use an iPhone with no service for iOS development? Will an iPhone with no service plan be usable as a development device?\nI don't need any functionality except a working device running iOS that is a GPS receiver. Since GPS is passive, I would think it would still work without a service plan.\nUnless iPhones get locked down or something, which is why I ask.\n\nA: You should be able to use an iPhone with no service for development purposes.\nThere seemed to be a problem with this in the past due to the activation screen showing up, but there was a workaround even back then. I don't think Apple wants to force you into a $70 contract just for development purposes. One of the workarounds mentioned was to develop on an iPod Touch (if you don't need GPS functionality), but the others specifically mention how to bypass the activation screen on an iPhone.\n", "Q: Invisible pictures in system applications While just browsing through apps like the CoreServices in both Mac and iOS, I found that most (all?) of the pictures have sizes and memory, but don't show anything when I quick look or open them. What is going on?\n\nA: The images stored in CoreServices, such as those in /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources, should be easily viewable in Finder — though, the majority of these are in the icns format. I'm also able to view the png images inside Dock.app. (Which particular images can't you view?)\n\nBut most png images on iOS are optimized for display on iOS (which involves switching some color channels and otherwise reducing the file size), so you can't view them in OS X without some preprocessing. See this blog post for more information.\n", "Q: Why won't iTunes let me manually sync PDFs to iBooks? I have my iPad set to manually manage content (i.e. drag and drop, not sync). I'm trying to add some PDFs to iBooks, but it refuses to let me copy them to my iPad. I can do this with epub books just fine. Is this a known limitation in iTunes, or a bug?\nIs there any workaround (to clarify: still using iTunes) that doesn't involve having to use the sync option (which forces me to sync videos as well, which is not workable)?\n\nA: You can get the PDF's on your iPad via some other method (e.g. Email, DropBox, etc.) and then choose to open the PDF inside iBooks.\n\n\nA: Try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sync your iPad\n\n*Drag your PDF (from Finder) into the LIBRARY section, left panel uppermost section in iTunes\n\n*It should then show up in your Books category in your LIBRARY\n\n*With your iPad connected drag the desired PDF from the Books category in your LIBRARY onto DEVICES/Your iPad\n\n*iTunes should display something like Updating Files on ... and Copying 1 of ...\n\n*Your PDF should show up in iBooks in the PDFs bookshelf section\n\n\nNote: For me this only worked using a USB cable - NOT by WiFi (for whatever reason...)\n\nA: In your iTunes client, click on your iPad in the Devices area. Do you have the proper settings in the Books tab as displayed by the screenshot? If not, this might be the reason iTunes is only transferring epubs and not PDFs.\n\n", "Q: Downgrade iPhone 4 baseband from 4.12.01 Need help with downgrading an iPhone 4 (GSM) from baseband 4.12.01 to be able to unlock it for use with other operator than AT&T. \nHave tried this guide (Downgrade iPhone 4 Baseband 4.12.01 to 4.11.08 / 4.10.01 / 01.59.00) but I only end up with an lower iOS version but no baseband downgrade\nDo you know how to downgrade the baseband?\n\nA: There is no way to downgrade the baseband on an iPhone (or any Apple device, the iPad being an acception but also rife with disaster).\nThe only way to downgrade the baseband is to install a previous version that is still being signed by Apple. For example, if they release 5.2 today, they would be signing 5.1 and 5.2. If 5.2 came with a newer baseband, it would be upgraded once you've installed that version. If you decided to revert immediately to 5.1, it would downgrade both, the OS and the baseband. \nApple typically leaves the signing window open for only a few days. Once it's closed, you cannot alter the baseband (even if you successfully downgrade the OS).\n", "Q: How to use WiFi and Ethernet at the same time Brief Description:\nI need my Ethernet card (en0) to see all traffic under 192.168.2.xxx.\nHowever I also need to use WiFi card (en1) for all other traffic.\nOS: OS X Lion\n\nI am using a separate network location to deal with this specific use (since this is a for a robotics project that communicates via Ethernet). Ethernet (en0) had to be set up as a static IP (192.168.2.10) per the requirements for the device I am connecting to. All connections on the Ethernet card (en0) should be 192.168.2.xxx as specified above. WiFi (en1) is set up as DHCP to a router since their is no point in assigning it as a static for general purpose traffic. Ethernet (en0) is set up as priority over WiFi (en1).\nI would also like to keep this under the network location preferences if at all possible since I do not require this feature to be on all the time.\nI would really appreciate your help on this. No one I have talked to knows how to solve this. \n\nA: \nMac OS X gives the default route to the highest-ranked, active interface. It doesn't have anything to do with bandwidth. To change interface rankings, go to System Preferences > Network, click the cog drop-down menu under the list of devices and select Set Service Order. Then drag to rearrange your interface rankings. \n\n(source)\nFor your case, set the limited network above the internet connection.  OS X will attempt to route packets to the first interface.  For packets meant for that network, it will work fine.  For packets not meant for that network it will see that it doesn't have a gateway or route to the internet, and will route those to the next interface, which is internet connected.\nIf your smaller network does have routers or a gateway that you need to access, you'll have to edit your routing tables to tell OS X which IP addresses can be found on which networks.\nBut I believe in your case the simple solution of putting the smaller network at a higher priority will work.\n\nA: The solution was extremely simple.\n\n\n*\n\n*Prioritize ethernet to be first.\n\n*Under System Preferences->Network Settings: where EN0 is Manually configured, leave the router field blank.\n\n\nI thought the router field was required, so I filled it in. My Ethernet connection has a \"router\" per say, but it is not used to access general connections. By filling in that field, the Mac OS would automatically try to create a default route through the Ethernet NIC. This would redirect all miscellaneous traffic through the wrong router.\nI also tried to delete this route in the routing tables before I found the solution to my problem. This would delete the route appropriately and allow the my software system to run correctly. However after around a minute or so, the route was re-added (as I later discovered) by the operating system. After the route was re-added the connections would fail, so I had to restart the process all over again. This fix proved to be unproductive.\nI hope this helps someone with their networking issues.\n", "Q: Is there a way to not have Lion not launch apps from previous startup? \nPossible Duplicate:\nReopen windows when logging back in - NOT\nHow can I keep restore for apps in Lion without having session restore when I log in? \n\nI've heard conflicting info on this - seems like a good place for an option on startup.

Look for the \"Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps\" check box and uncheck it.\n\n", "Q: There is no link in the verification email for a new Apple ID I created I got my new iPhone today and ofcrouse made an Apple ID right away. Everything goes ok, I get sent a verification email, but there is no link in it. It has the instructions and they mention a link, but there is none. I tried sending the verification email from my iPhone and from the apple site (https://appleid.apple.com/), but still nothing.\nHere is a screenshot of the email I received:\n\n\nA: It seems that your email client is not displaying images. (Many email programs disable images by default for security purposes.) However, the verification link will probably be an image button, so you must enable images in order to see it.\n(Alternatively, if you configure your email account in Mail on your iPhone, you should also be able to see the button there, since Mail displays images in emails.)\n\nA: Set up your e mail account on your new I phone. Then open apples verification e Mail on your phones e mail app. The rest is easy.The email on my home computer (windows) HP didn't have the link, hours wasted and several beers consumed.\n", "Q: How is the battery level calculated in the magic mouse? I wonder how the battery level in the magic mouse is calculated.\nThis question about battery problems raised another one, I would like to know how the electronics in the magic mouse work and evaluate the remaining energy left as it seems quite inaccurate with some of my batteries.\nIf you don't know how the magic mouse does its calculation maybe you know how other electronic devices calculate the level?\nI am no electrician and I have no skills in e- engineering. But maybe this image from iFixit might give a clue to a someone with the right knowledge (click the image for the original high-res version):\n\nHigh res pictures available here if you need more details.\n\nA: Generally the amount of energy left in a cell is related to its voltage at a given current draw, and the chemistry.  For instance, AA Alkaline cells are about 1.62V new, and drop to 0.9V near the end of their life as they are depleted.  Rechargeable cells often output 1.29V fully charged and will discharge to 0.9V.\nFurther, the voltage drops more with larger current draws, and this drop increases for cells that are near the end of their life.  So if you turn off the mouse and test the voltage, then turn the mouse on and test for voltage, the second test will have a lower voltage.  If that difference is small, the cell is near the beginning of its life.  If the difference is large, the cell is near the end of its life.\nThere are ways to determine the battery chemistry with some level of confidence by performing a few tests, but generally there's no reason to.  The majority of users merely need to have a little advance notice that their favorite iDevice is about to cease functioning so they can prepare.\nSo most such devices simply wait for the battery to drop below a specified voltage, before alerting the user.  Since most batteries can be considered dead at 0.9 volts, and few batteries go lower than 1.2 volts when new, the simplest solution is to alert the user to a low battery condition at 1.0 or 1.1 volts.\nWhen a user expects a battery bar that gives a relative measurement (3 boxes for full, 0 boxes for nearly dead) then it will generally show full until it gets below 1.2 volts.\nSo an alkaline battery will often show full until very close to the end of its life, then appear to die quickly.  A rechargeable battery will show 3/4 full for most of its life, then die rapidly (due to the discharge curve being more flat than an alkaline, and being closer to the 1.0v cutoff).\nThe batteries you will have the most problem with are \"heavy duty\" which is code for \"cheap, non-alkaline\" batteries.  They have their uses, but not in electronic devices.  If you use the cheapest of the cheap AA batteries from the drugstore, or the \"40 batteries for $6.99\" pack from woot, amazon, or [insert favorite membership club here] then you're very likely getting non-alkaline, \"heavy duty\" batteries.  These cells have a very different, and much faster, discharge curve when used in most electronics, and you will see flakiness long before the battery is actually dead, and perhaps even before the mouse itself recognizes it's dead.  The issue is that they can't supply the sudden bursts of power the radio in the mouse requires, so some transmissions are lost.  When it's not transmitting, the voltage appears to be fine, but the difference between no load and an RF load causes the battery voltage to drop significantly simply because it wasn't designed to support those power draws.\nThis is why almost all electronic devices insist on \"name brand alkaline\" batteries.  Rechargeable batteries work well for this type of use as well.\nThis article, \"Does the battery fuel gauge lie?\" is relevant to this discussion, though it mostly focuses on larger rechargeable batteries used in the iPad and similar devices.  It discuses how smart battery electronics monitor and manage the charge and discharge of batteries in advanced electronic devices.\n", "Q: How can I change the Google search locale with OS X Lion Safari 5 Whenever I perform a search in Safari it takes me to google.com. I am in the UK, so results for eShops etc the results are not relevant - I need google.co.uk.\nHow do I change the search engine? I don't want to use the Glims plugin because it interferes with the toolbar in a subtle way that I don't like (I can explain if necessary).\n\nA: From a few articles I found, it sounds like this isn't directly supported in Safari.\nHowever, there is a Safari extension that will redirect google.com to google.co.uk and should take care of your problem. (This is a simple extension, using the built-in mechanism, and not a plugin.)\n\nA: You should be able to create/use a Google ID, and log into Google to choose a base site, and from that point on any searches that head over to .com should automatically redirect to .co.uk - so the answer is by configuring Google, not by configuring Safari.\n\nA: Neither solutions are any good for me.\nI need to be able to search a choice of international googles - english uk, spanish spain, german etc.\nWhat I do is change the google suffix to select engine after the initial search e.g. from google.es to google.co.uk. But it's fiddly - I'd much prefer a system like IE's where you can add in any search engine you like.\nI'm surprised Apple haven't come up with something or is it the usual case of 'We know what's best for you'?\n\nA: I use Safari Omnibar which allows configuration of the search engine you want to use (and also integrates the address and the search box into one).\nFrom the web site:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unified location bar with search bar\n\n*Search directly using location bar\n\n*Quickly switch engines using search engine keywords\n\n*Define new search engines\n\n", "Q: Change Snow Leopard Login Wallpaper w/ Terminal I know this is possible as I did it once before.\nHow do you set the login background wallpaper to something else using terminal?\n\nA: The login screen background image is located at /System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.jpg — you can simply sudo cp another jpeg image to replace it (though I'd recommend backing it up first!).\n\nA: You can do it using AppleScript:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n     set desktop picture to POSIX file \"/path/to/file.jpg\"\nend tell\n\nIt should be fairly easy to package this in an Automator script.\nAlternatively, you can use defaults: \ndefaults write com.apple.desktop Background '{default = {ImageFilePath = \"/Library/Desktop Pictures/Black & White/Lightning.jpg\"; };}'\n\nI haven't tested this myself, so you may have to run killall Dock before this takes effect.\nEdit: more information on this and launchd\n", "Q: Change Image Format of a Screenshot Lets say I want to save my screenshots as a .jpg instead of .png.

I have a 13\" white unibody MacBook from 2010 which I'd like to use with the Apple remote, to control keynote presentations. According to this question, I need an external IR reciever for the remote to work with my MacBook. Would an IR receiver actually work, and if so, what are my options?\n\nA: If you're looking to control Keynote presentations and your Mac doesn't have a built-in IR port, you could buy an external receiver, but I suggest you use either:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Keynote Remote app for iPhone. This works over wi-fi and requires only a $0.99 purchase and no additional hardware to buy or set up.\n\nor\n\n\n*\n\n*A specialized slide advancer, like this Logitech one. This is designed to be comfortable to hold (the Apple Remote wasn't) and doesn't require line-of-sight to the receiver (which is a small USB dongle) to work. Some of the better ones have a slide counter and laser pointers built in.\n\n", "Q: Making a GIF from a Video I have a video clip that I want to convert to an animated GIF. I used GIFBrewery.\nBut I couldn't figure out how to make a GIF that's the proper speed. The default preview they showed had way too many frames missing, so I increased the frame count. But once I did that, the GIF played way too slowly. How do I make the GIF speed simply the same speed as the original video?\nI also used MPEG Streamclip to export to PNGs so I can use GIMP to create the GIF. Same problem, couldn't create a proper speed GIF.\n\nA: In the \"gif settings\" box there's a value for \"frame delay\" which defaults at 100. This is the time in milliseconds between each frame.  The small it is, the faster the gif will animate.  \nFrame delay of 100 is 10 frames per second.  If you have 30 frames per second, use 33 as the frame delay.  If you have 15 frames per second, use 67 as the frame delay.\nOr just change the \"frame delay\" value until it looks right - smaller for faster speed, bigger for slower speed.\nThere's a pretty good overview of how to use the app in this article:\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/1164864/how_to_create_an_animated_gif_from_a_video_clip.html\nAlso note that the preview inside the app is limited to 10 frames per second or slower - if it looks slow inside the app, test it out in a real browser.\n\nA: GifRocket creates a gif in the proper speed.\nThe problem is that it doesn't have any configuration to change speed, but you could use Adapter and convert a video with the configuration you want and then convert it to .gif using GifRocket.\nBest thing is that both apps are free.\n", "Q: Erasing a bunch of contacts at once? My friend got an iPhone from her uncle and started using it without wiping out all the data. Now she wants to delete all the existing contacts on the phone (over 500) but doesn't want to reset the entire phone. Is there any easy way to delete multiple contacts at once?\nRight now she has to go into each one, press edit, and then press delete. The contacts are not synced to any service, they are only located on the phone itself.\n\nA: You can use the Cleanup: remove all contacts app from the appstore to do this. The app costs $0.99\n\nIf you want a Mac only solution, you can backup the contacts in your mac's Address Book, connect your phone to your mac and set it to sync only your address book in iTunes. Once it's done syncing (it should now be a clean slate), you can change the sync settings to whatever you wish and then restore your existing contacts from the backup.\n", "Q: Duplicate Tracks in \"Music\" App I used ITunes to download to my new IPad3 a variety of songs and albums I had already purchased.  However, in some cases, I have two copies of every song.  When I play an album with the \"Music\" app, I can see two copies of each song - and yes it plays both copies as it moves forward.\nI've seen instructions online of how to get rid of ITunes duplicates on a PC.  But I'm dealing with my IPad3, not a PC.\n\nA: You should have duplicate tracks on iTunes as well. If not, then try this out\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in you iPad and open iTunes. \n\n*On the \"File\" Menu Click on \"Transfer Purchases from Brent's iPad\" (I\nAssumed the name of your iPad but you get the point).\n\n*Wait for sometime for all of your purchased tracks to transfer into\nyou computer (PC right?).\n\n*After that you can try out the steps mentioned in the link you\nposted. This will erase all the duplicates from your iTunes Library.\n\n*After all is done, Sync you iPad and your duplicates should have been erased.\n\n\n\nHope it works!\n\nA: I went to the Genius bar at the Apple store.  They simply had me delete the songs from my IPad, and re-download them.  The duplicate tracks problem was solved.  Thus both creating this problem and solving this problem required no connection to a PC or any other device.  \nIn short, the problem was entirely within the IPad / ITunes synchronization.  It is VERY GOOD to know this remedy for this problem!!!\n", "Q: transfering contacts from my old phone to iPhone via Bluetooth Is it possible to transfer all my contacts from my old phone to iPhone via Bluetooth? \n\nA: No, unfortunately this isn't possible as the iPhone lacks the necessary Bluetooth services for address book transfer. If both your iPhone and previous phone are GSM phones, you can transfer the contacts to the SIM and transfer them off with the iPhone.\n\n\nA: According to Apple, the closest supported Bluetooth profile is Phone Book Access Profile (PBAP), but this is mainly used with car kits to:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Allow the car kit to display the name of the incoming caller\n  \n*Allow the car kit to download the phone book so the user can initiate a call from the car display\n  \n\nThere is no mention of sending contacts to the iPhone. You might be able to find something on Cydia with a Jailbroken phone, though. For example, the iBluetooth app adds file syncing capabilities. However, it doesn't mention anything about contact syncing.\n", "Q: How to Force iPad / OneNote re-sync Does anyone know of a solution, from the iPad side of the equation, for this OneNote syncing problem?\n\nA: Under the iPad's \"Settings,\" there is a OneNote tab which offers a \"Reset Application\".

Now that I know how to lock the iPhone if the lock button is broken, I was wondering how I can restart the phone or turn it off.\nThe lock button is completely unresponsive and holding it down does nothing. Are there any workarounds besides replacing the button?\n\nA: You have a couple options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Simply let the phone discharge until it turns off. Then, you can charge it again and it should turn on when it reaches a high enough battery level.\n\n*If you dare, you can reset the device's network settings which will restart it (but obviously, also clear your network settings).\n\n*You can use Assistive Touch (Settings > Accessibility) to lock and turn off the phone.\nBut really, you should take it into an Apple store, so they can deal with the underlying problem of your broken button!\n\nA: I have the same problem with my iPod touch. In settings, go to \"General\">\"Accessibility\" and turn AssistiveTouch on. You will have a little square with a circle appear on your screen. tap that to open it up, and there will be a lock screen button. Press and hold this, and just like with the lock button, the \"slide to power off\" will appear. Good Luck!\nOf course now you cannot power it back on as you have no power button... I had the same problem... Just connect the iPhone to your charger and it will power the phone back on.\n", "Q: Partition MacBook Pro with Mac OS X Lion using Disk Utility I've just bought a new MacBook Pro with Mac OS X Lion.\nThe problem started when I tried to divide the hard disk into more than 3 partitions, so I erased the existing partition and tried to divide the hard disk using Disk Utility. So, I opened the \"Partition\" tab and chose \"3 partitions\" and when I hit \"Apply\" it says that \"Couldn't unmount partition\".\nCan anyone please tell me how to fix that or how can I partition my hard disk?\n\nA: ALERT: THIS WILL ERASE YOUR DATA WHEN YOU PARTITION.

I'm getting tired of fighting with Apple's iTunes to get it to play my non-iTunes media. I've tried the 32-bit trick, and MOV files I remove from the library and add back no longer show up in the Movies or TV Shows categories, so that trick fails, as well.\nEvery time there's an update, Apple breaks support for AVI, MP4 and — most recently — MOV files not purchased from Apple's iTunes store. So what alternatives to iTunes exist that manage to support a mix of media that Apple now seems to go out of its way to break?\n\nA: There's Usher, by ManyTricks, for $35. I haven't used it myself, but it looks great and follows iTunes/iPhoto's design principles. I trust ManyTricks to make a good app: they're behind my favorite window manager, Moom.\n\nA: When it comes to iTunes alternatives, I can think of three or four worthy alternatives.\nAudirvana:\nA free, open-source tool which supports many formats and will allow you to upsampling for no cost at all.\nClementine:\nFree source as well, a multi-platform player which is more of a music organizer and is pretty snappy. \nSongbird:\nIt's like the anti-iTunes and will provide everything you expect from a music player. \nEcote:\nIt will cost you $8 in the MacApp Store, but it's worth it! It's very iOS-like and it integrates perfect with Mac OS X. \nAlthough it will cost you some money, I strongly recommend Ecote! \n", "Q: Reason for the need to reboot my iPad this is my first question here so go easy on me. Truth to be told it's not really a question, more like a curiosity.\nI noticed that after prolonged use of my 1st generation iPad without rebooting it (shutting down & turning on) some games started acting wonky. The first problem was with iBomber Defence Pacific which started crashing in the transition menus (thankfully not in the game). After a while I couldn't enter the game at all as it was crashing constantly. I got quite frustrated but I left it as it was...\nThen I purchased Angry Birds Space and I noticed I couldn't pause the game. So I googled my problem and someone suggested to reboot the iPad.\nAnd bam, that solved it. But the question is why? I mean, I periodically manually close the running apps and as much as I know this clears them out of the memory. Is there a bug which leaves stuff sticking around which slowly but surely clog the device's RAM?\nJust wondering... :)\n\nA: Most probably it was that rebooting your iPad reinitiated  the memory. The thing is some apps have poor memory management schemes. So due to those bad \"memory dumps\" you device's memory becomes used for nothing. So When you reboot the device, the problem is solved\n", "Q: Mac book pro is very slow I have a mac book pro late 2011.\nIt has a very powerful hardware. But it is very slow.

In my case I caught five similar violations. :)\n\nA: Apple recommends this for many problems and its useful to know how to do:\nTry making a new user: System Preferences/ Users and Groups / hit + for new user.\nLog out of your current user account and log into the new (clean) user.\nRestart computer in new user.\nIf that helped at all there may be things loading when your computer starts up in your user account that you can selectively turn off to attempt to speed things up.\n\nA: I had the very same problem. 4GB MBP 13\" late 2011 running very slowly at start up, even text appearing after typing was lagging drastically.\nThe solution. Clear your desktop of folders and files. Create a folder in documents and dump your desktop item in to it. It helps finder with the indexing at start up.\nGo into SysPref's, Users and find your login items and bin everything thats set to run at start up.\nIf you have any AV products, switch them off.

The problem is that whenever I read one of the messages first, it is marked as read on the server and he often misses it. I would like to keep it unmarked on the server and mark it as read only at my Mail app. \nIs there any way how to setup Mail app so that this behaves like this?\nI am accessing his email because he often gets information that is important for me as well and this saves time because he isn't always online and he would have to forward most of it to me anyway. \n\nA: This mechanism is a feature of the mail protocol that you are using, and isn't a local feature that you can choose to set within Mail.  You are likely useing either IMAP or Exchange, the the replication of mail states for things like location, unread/read etc is a part of the normal operation.\nI am not at a Mac, so I cannot test for features, but the best you can hope for is a configuration in Mail that will allow you to either change what action marks the mail as read or not (Might be mere selection, might be opening the time specifically, might be viewing the message for more than X seconds etc) or extend the time that it takes for the action to complete (viewd for 5 seconds, or 10, etc).\nYou can of course simply right click on a read mail and then mark it as unread again.\n\nA: There is a free program called True Preview that you can install to prevent Mail from automatically marking messages as \"read\".  We use this all the time because we want messages to remain unread until such time as we actually mark them as \"read\".  True preview has options to have different settings for different accounts, which is useful.\nhttp://christianserving.org/project/truepreview\n\nA: The mail client in Opera has this feature. I have \"Mark as Read\" set to \"Manually\" and email that I have not viewed are shown in blue text and after I viewed them they are shown in black text. And they stay unread.\n\nA: The workaround is to change the number of seconds required for the mail to be marked as read. The default value is 2.\nPlease type the below command in terminal and it should do the trick. Tested on Big Sur (11.2.3)\ndefaults write com.apple.Mail MarkAsReadDelay 0\n\n\nA: This is how IMAP works.\nAnother solution to your problem is to set up Gmail to send you a copy of every message from your co-worker's account.\nOtherwise you will have to set each message you read on his account to Mark As Unread.\n\nA: As other answerers have described, this is a feature of IMAP. IMAP maintains client-server synchronization so you will see the same thing regardless of whether you are using the browser, your desktop or your phone.\nAn alternative is to use POP, which is a one-way download of messages. You will not benefit from any server-side filtering/labeling you have implemented in the Gmail UI, but your messages will have a unique read state on each device and will remain unread in the Gmail UI or in your colleague's email client. Please make sure that you properly configure POP inside of Gmail to keep downloaded messages in the inbox -- note that Gmail is unusual in that this setting is controlled inside of Gmail on the Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab of Settings, rather than in your email client.\n\nA: I had same issue, the culprit was the iPhone's email client with its default preview feature. A preview fools the IMAP to believe it's read. Solution: to switch it off (go to settings -> email -> set preview to none.\n", "Q: Trash files in the safe mode? I would like to ask you, do the trash files gets deleted from the safe mode if I put them in the trash in the safe mode (but do not empty the trash) and empty the trash in the normal mode?\nRegards,\nArthur\n\nA: Normally yes.\nThe safe-mode is only blocking certain features of Mac at the boot time.\nSee http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1564?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\n\nIt loads only required kernel extensions (some of the items in\n  /System/Library/Extensions).\nIt disables all fonts other than those in /System/Library/Fonts (Mac\n  OS X v10.4 or later).\nIt moves to the Trash all font caches normally\n  stored in /Library/Caches/com.apple.ATS/(uid)/ , where (uid) is a user\n  ID number such as 501 (Mac OS X v10.4 or later).

Is messages version 6.1 (11D1069) stable for someone that doesn't mind iChat and FaceTime currently?\nI am happy with iChat and FaceTime on my mac and don't really need the iMessage integration presently. I back up with Time Machine regularly and know the general risks that beta software can have glitches or worse, lose data. I've researched all the features, so I'm not looking for why or why not the program is better - just the stability aspect of it in use.\nDoes anyone have specific recommendation for someone who prefers to run more stable software on their macs? I'm normally glad to help test beta software, but in this case the general buzz I'm hearing from the people that the program is still a little rough and new features are not compelling enough to run full time given the current bugs.\nWould you share some specifics about why or why not the program is stable enough for use based on your actual experience with the App.\n\n\nA: I am running Messages via Mountain Lion, but I believe that the application is functionaly identical to the Beta for Lion.\nI have the following regular issues with it in day to day usage:\n\n\n*\n\n*Badge counts are inconsistent, and it often says \"1\" regardless of reality\n\n*Icon Bounce - it bounces in the dock a lot as if something has happened, when nothing (that I can see) has\n\n*Slow syncing - when I have used iMessages on my phone, and then move to the desktop, it drip feeds the messages it needs to see to catch up really slowly, and you get a notification every 10 seconds or so for what can be a very long time if there is a lot to catch up on\n\n\nAlso, at least once (though this could have been a ML bug) it started using the wrong icon, showing a picture of a friend in place of my own avatar against my own messages.  Investigation showed the \"me\" card had been ammended in Contacts...\n\nA: From a security standpoint, one major flaw that holds me back from using it day to day is that there is no option to turn off chat logging. The only way around it is to remove permissions from the iChats folder. I don't really care to log my chats, and really don't want to, and was very surprised to see that you could not turn this off.\nThe only other major flaw I have had is the unread counts - as in, not syncing with iMessage as much as I would like and clearing the count. I also have seen some times where it literally replays a conversation in front of me throughout the day. I would prefer it to just reload the state from the iMessage server, and present that to me at a synced state. \n\nA: A number of my local contacts use iMessages heavily and I've alway kept iChat running on my computer, so running the beta was a no brainer for me. I haven't observed any problems on my primary machine or on the MacBook Air I maintain for Mom–at least none that caused me to look to Messages.\nI haven't had difficulties staying logged in, as reported in another answer here, or found the program to be what I would term unstable, but will keep a closer eye on it moving forward. I feel safe in saying that running Messages hasn't had a negative effect on my system overall. I hadn't even thought about it until I came upon this thread, it's just there.\nI am curious about @stuffe's report of an altered Address Book Card and would love to hear if there are more reports of this behavior. As Stuffe points out, there are a lot of spoons in the core data soup, so Messages may not be the culprit. \n\nA: My recommendation is to avoid it for now. I ran it for a while and enjoyed some of its new features but it couldn't stay logged in and had other small but annoying problems. I uninstalled it and went back to iChatAV and things were fine. I decided to see if installing it a month later would give me a newer more stable version so I did another install of it recently and it seemed like the same version: unstable and lots of errors, especially on waking from sleep.\nSo, I killed it again.\nBottom line: you can get rid of it easily enough so that there's no harm in trying it, the process of moving back to iChatAV is painless and no harm is done. It's a heck of a lot of fun to chat/message with people on mobile devices although buggy at times, it's a look at the future.\nThe only thing you might want to be careful of is if you have an AIM account and do not have AIM saving chats (accounts/chat settings) it seems that Messages turns that on automatically so you'll want to turn it off if you don't want it. \n\nA: The points already made are good — I think it should also be mentioned that some features from iChat are missing or unusable in the current Messages beta!\n\n\n*\n\n*You can't search within a conversation — there is one search box, and it seems to search all conversations. More importantly, it consumes a lot of memory and causes Messages to hang for several minutes (at least, it did the two or three times I tried it). I've simply gotten in the habit of not searching.\n\n*Conversation tabs are not grayed out when a user is offline. This means it's hard to see at a glance who is online. Also, if you have multiple accounts through which you can communicate with someone (e.g. AIM and Google Talk), the  icon only reflects the account you currently have selected. Again, this makes it hard to tell if someone is online without opening the dropdown to switch accounts or looking through your buddy list.\n\n*I've been having more connection problems that require me to disable and re-enable one of my Jabber accounts every so often. But this might just be my internet connection rather than a Messages problem, I'm not sure.\n(As for the Address Book issues: When I first tried the beta, I had an issue where it seemed to have deleted a buddy's address card. But after restoring that card from a backup, I haven't had any more Address Book issues.)\n", "Q: Applescripting ODBC Is it possible to interact with an ODBC connection within AppleScript?  Or must one break out into another process (e.g. Python, Perl, etc)?\n\nA: AppleScript has very few built-in capabilities, and in particular, no built-in functions to talk to databases, either via ODBC or any other protocol.\nWhat is does provide you is a way to control applications that have that ability, or cut out to system scripts that also have the ability as you suggested in your question.\n", "Q: Unexpected interfaces in ifconfig In the middle of installing a tool called mrtg, I bailed out from a perl script to set various configuration parameters for use of snmp because it became clear that I had no idea what I was doing.  I also explored some snmp commands myself, but didn't keep a record, unfortunately.\nI come back to ifconfig and notice it shows three new interfaces (not there just before the previous adventure):\ngif0: flags=8010<POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST> mtu 1280\nstf0: flags=0<> mtu 1280\nfw0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 4078\n    lladdr 60:fb:42:ff:fe:f4:cd:9e \n    media: autoselect <full-duplex>\n    status: inactive\n\nMy laptop on the same LAN has a different new interface called p2p0 that I hadn't noticed before, as well as gif0 and stf0 but not fw0.\nAfter I reset my Airport Extreme to factory default, and reinstalled OS X Lion on my machine, with a wiped disk, they are still there.  This:\nsudo ifconfig gif0 destroy\n\nmakes gif0 go away, but on reboot it comes back.  There is a previous answer with some info but what I'd like to know is why are they still there despite a clean install, could they be a security risk, and should I or can I make them go away.  Should I be looking at the Airport or something in my StartupItems?\nUPDATE:  Does my machine set these up at boot or does the Airport remember them?  And in either case, why didn't a clean install (or factory reset) restore them to the previous configuration?\n\nA: p2p0 is AirDrop, according to https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4784003\n\nA: The gif0 is a generic virtual interface, stf0 is an ipv6 interface and fw0 is your firewire interface. You shouldn't worry about these.\n\nA: fw0 is the FireWire network interface. It's benign.\nstf0 is an IPv6 to IPv4 tunnel interface. It's a bridge connection that exists to help us transition from IPv4 to the IPv6 standard. It's benign. You can read more about it here if you like: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6to4\ngif0 is a generic tunnel interface. It's used to tunnel IPv4 traffic to an IPv6 network and back. It's benign.

I wonder what kind of connector is used in the latest MacBook Air for the SATA drive.\nSATA Express?\nWhen I first saw the gumstick SSD drive I thought it was using a SATA Express connector.\nBut when answering a question yesterday I decided to get a bit more documentation about it and appeared SATA Express along with µSSD is not a released standard yet.\nWhat then?\nAfter looking closely at pictures of the different drives I decided to find out. But my MBA is sealed with those pentalobe screws and none of my screwdrivers can get them to move.\nI searched more on the net.\nmSATA?\nThen I saw on multiple websites references to mSATA in the MBA and decided to follow this lead when I found a source I trusted. Until I saw a side by side image of a standard mSATA SSD next to a MBA one :\n\nClearly, it's not a duck... They don't look similar. And if some pins were optional the fact that the other side of the SSD has no connectors clearly excludes any compatibility between the 2 connectors:\n\nmini-PCIe?\nNow if wee look at the motherboard of the Macbook Air we can clearly see the SSD slot next to PCIe slot and how similar they are, if not suspiciously identical:\n\n(SSD on the left, the would be mini-PCIe on the right).\nBut as mini-PCIe is supposed to support mSATA and these are clearly not compatible, what is it?\nDraft revision or unreleased port?\nNow would it be possible Apple is already using an early SATA Express implementation? Knowing their habits of adding draft implementation of standards (Thunderbolt, 802.11n, OpenAL...) it wouldn't be surprising.\nBut maybe I'm looking too far, is it a custom connector? Ot are they simply using a native functionality of PCIe?\nDoes anyone knows what connector is used on the MacBook Air?\n\nA: It is a variant of Mini PCI Express & mSATA:\n\nSome notebooks (notably the Asus Eee PC, the MacBook Air, and the Dell mini9 and mini10) use a variant of the PCI Express Mini Card as an SSD. This variant uses the reserved and several non-reserved pins to implement SATA and IDE interface passthrough, keeping only USB, ground lines, and sometimes the core PCIe 1x bus intact.[11] This makes the 'miniPCIe' flash and solid state drives sold for netbooks largely incompatible with true PCI Express Mini implementations.\n\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express#Mini_PCI_Express_.26_mSATA\n", "Q: Why does iCal often say \"The server responded: 403 to operation CalDAVSetPropertyQueueableOperation.\" This happens on both my MacBooks running 10.7.3 and has done at least since 10.7 and with iCloud.

Per the rfc2445 standard, Section 3.5 - Security Considerations, non event owners are NOT allowed to modified the event... hence the reason for getting the CalDAVWriteEntityQueueableOperation error.\nRemoving the entire ORGANIZER line from the ics file before importing fixes the issue.\nPer the standard, if the event is not on a group scheduled calendaring system,e.g. a single users calendar system, the organizer's line MUST NOT be specified (section 4.8.4.3 - Conformance).\nAmazing how many webinar companies get this wrong.... \n\nA: I previously had a similar issue when migrating multiple accounts from MobileMe to iCloud. I resolved the issue by disabling and then enabling iCal sync through iCloud on my iMac in System Preferences -- actually I believe I disabled everything in my case.\nAlways backup your calendar before troubleshooting (File > Export > iCal Archive).\nThe following steps are roughly from a Apple Support Community discussion. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open iCloud in System Preferences.\n\n*Switch off (uncheck) iCal sync in iCloud System Preferences pane.\nBackup iCal before doing this. You will need to remove calendar data.\n\n*Open iCal and verify the iCloud account is removed in the iCal preferences under accounts.\n\n*Close iCal, reopen System Preference and switch on (check) iCal sync in iCloud System Preferences pane.\n\n*Reopen iCal and verify the iCloud account is enabled in the iCal preferences under accounts.\nAt this point if the problem persist I might try completely signing out of iCloud and then signing back in. But remember to backup all related data before turning off iCloud sync - iCal, Contacts, Mail, Photostream, etc...\n\nA: Perhaps this might get solved if you add you iCloud credentials to your keychain? I had a problem where Mail kept prompting me for the password even though I had the 'Remember Password' setting enabled in Mail. It got resolved when I explicitly added the login details into Keychain.\n\nA: This problem was solved using Dale Fosters library trick. I disabled the calendars, backed up and then moved ~/Library:\n  /Calendars\n  /Library/Preferences/com.apple.CalendarAgent\n  /Library/Preferences/com.apple.iCal.plist\n\n…to the desktop.

Changed the entry to that Calendar and then deleted the calendar. Issue fixed.\n\nA: I realized that all error messages were linked to my Google account. So I went to mail preferences and in accounts, and I checked the details/info in my Google email. All the error messages I had seen before were linked to this email account, so if I unchecked this account on iCal, all its notes would disappear and therefore all the error messages.\nBut, I wanted to remain with notes. I could just put the notes under the other email account, but I did enter the password again and since then I don't have problems anymore.\n\nA: I copy and pasted the event and changed the calendar to the same calendar (this time a little icon of a person appeared next to it). After clicking send and ignore a few times, all is ok.\n\nA: Because the item was in iCloud's calendar server, I simply logged into the icloud.com (or mac.com) website and deleted the calendar event there.  No complaining from the server and the item immediately disappeared from my Apple Calendar app.\n\nA: I personally, just kept pressing on the OK (or Close, or Cancel, or Try again) button (don't remember exactly the label of the only button in that dialog box) for like 20 times, until it fixed itself.\n", "Q: How can I open the 2011 MacBook Air without damaging the screws? I would like to open the MBA, I don't have the screwdriver that fits: \n\nIs there a way to remove the screws without the 5 points pentalobe required?\nThe ideal solution would be to do this without damaging the screws.\n\nA: You cannot safely remove it without the proper tool and the correct touch. You want to place the driver on the tangent to the case (the screws enter at an angle - not vertical compared to the keyboard plane.\niFixit.com and other places sell the pentalobe tool for less than $15 and it's money well spent to avoid needing to get Apple to replace the screws should you strip them.\n\nA: I managed to do this with a 1.2mm flathead, it obviously doesn't have as much torque as a pentalobe driver, but it doesn't strip the heads if you're careful.\nAlso, this trick works, but you need the right pen (hard clear bic):\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONd7quApjGM\n", "Q: 9 Monitors connected to a Mac Pro I'm researching the best way to make a 9 monitor video wall (3x3 grid).\nAnyone have any experience doing this with a Mac Pro?\nAnyone know the maximum amount of monitors I can hook up to a Mac Pro? \n\nA: I've seen this in the past and presume the latest can support 9 (8 used to be the easy limit with normal two up GPU cards in all 4 PCI slots.\nThe current graphics cards look to support three monitors at a time, so you might get away with only three GPU cards.\nYou'll need a mix of mini display port and HDMI connections so you might want to just ask for a quote from Apple to be 100% sure you have everything you need to make it work.\nI could see some monitor choices being problematic, but as long as you don't mind adding some converters if you need all displays to be the same input or are pushing displays that have dual link DVI size bandwidths.\n\nA: Do you need the highest resolution and/or video speed from each monitor?  If you can make a tradeoff for video speed you can look at USB video adaptors.  If you can use a lower resolution on each monitor you can use a hardware video wall that will convert one video output into a 9 display video wall.  \nIf you really need high resolution and video speed, then you're going to have a hard time getting the right cards to make more than 6 monitors happen.\nThe limitation isn't in OS X - it can support many displays.  The limitation is is how many video cards you can fit into the machine and whether OS X has good drivers for them.\n\nA: When setting up nine displays some kind of monitor stand/s that can manage that many displays will be handy, unless you want a sprawl of monitors. Something such as a 9 monitor stand/mount  will be helpful to keep the displays in a usable area of space that fits on one desk. VESA display mounts and stands will be your friend to make this process flow nicely.  Regardless of which stand or wall mount option you get just make sure your displays support VESA mounting before ordering them.\nAlso pay attention to size and weight requirements for the mounts and stands making sure it will support the size and weight of the displays you want to use. For example a typical 9 monitor stand may only supports up to 19\" displays. So be sure to coordinate what you purchasing so that it will all work together, fit, and remain safely standing. \nFor max monitors it depends on your Mac pro. According to the EveryMac specs the maximum number of displays for 2010 Mac pros is 6 displays. 2006 - 2009 Mac Pros are noted as 8.\nAccording to Apple's specs for the Macs that have 2 PCI Express X16 slots the other 2 are X4 but can accept an X16 card, which means that you can install 2 other X16 cards but they will run at  X4 speeds and hence be a little slower than the other cards, same is true for Mac Pros with only one X16 slot hence why Apple/EveryMac has 2009 and prior Macs listed as eight displays max by using 4 cards.\nFor some reason Apple will only sell you 2 graphics cards for a 2010 Mac Pro as a BTO option, hence why the 6 display limit is noted on the Mac Pro technical specifications and on EveryMac. \nAfter further observation it appears that the reason why only two cards is that the Apple ATI Radeon HD 5770 is a double height card., more than two will simply not fit in the case (see picture below).\n \nSince all of the current Mac PCI express graphics cards that support 3 displays are double height, you really can only use one of them in a Mac Pro to achieve the goal of 9 displays. \n\nIf you use two 3 port video cards such as the Apple ATI Radeon HD 5770, then you you can add one additional single height card (if the 1 single height card does fit) for a setup of 3+3+2 setup, keeping power demands in mind too.\nOne way to achieve 9 displays is with one three-display card and three single height dual-display capable graphics cards such as the Apple Nvidia Geforce GT 120.  So a 3+2+2+2 should be possible with the current 2010 (Mac Pro 5,1). It looks like the 2008 and 2009  Mac Pros also allow for double height graphics with out the card blocking the other slots, if the double height card is installed in the bottom PCI express slot. Using a ATI Radeon HD 5770 in the bottom slot, and then adding three single height dual-display capable cards in the above PCI express slots, specifically the Apple Nvidia Geforce GT 120 (as pictured below) it all should work and also be within the maximum power limitations for the Mac Pro's PCI express slots, at about 225W which is less than 300Watts.\n\nSo when you choose your array of graphics cards keep in mind the power limitations of the Mac Pro. As noted in the Mac Pro 2010 User Guide, the combined draw for all the installed PCI express cards must not exceed 300W.** \nFor reference the Watts per card for the mentioned /available cards (Note that for the AMD cards the Watts may very since the specs may not be for the Apple OEM cards):\n1 x Apple Nvidia Geforce GT 120 - 50 Watts \n1 x AMD ATI Radeon HD 5770 ~ 75Watts\n1 x AMD ATI Radeon HD 5870 ~ 150W \n", "Q: Automatically move old music tracks on iTunes to external HDD My media are taking most of my internal hard disk drive. I wanted to know if there is a way to automatically transfer music that I do not listen to regularly on my iTunes folder to an external hard disk.\n\nA: Steps to perform this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to the location you want to copy the files to and leave the\nwindow open in the Finder.\n\n*Create a smart playlist in iTunes by Option-Clicking the new\nplaylist button in the bottom left of the main window.\n\n*Configure the playlist with the appropriate criteria, such as:\n{Last Played} {is before} {1/1/2008} or whatever you consider\n\"Old.\"  Click Ok \n\n*Select Edit, Select All and drag the items to the folder you opened in step 1.  Wait for the copy to finish and you'll have all your old music in that folder.\n\n*To automate the process, use Automator and configure a new workflow similar to the following image:\n\n*Rig up the workflow you just created to run.  Put it in the dock, use Crontab or run it at login.\n", "Q: How to control Bluetooth wireless radio from the command line? This question is almost the same as my previous question, but with one major difference; I want to turn on/off Bluetooth from the command line (bash or similar), NOT from AppleScript - the answers for this I saw on superuser all used AppleScript.\nI would guess that networksetup might be useful but have no idea what interface(s) to interact with - I would like an answer including a complete command I can run (and understand) - if device model matters, it's Snow Leopard on MacBook2,1 to MacBook7,1, except MacBook5,1, and if you can only do for 6,1 and 7,1 that's fine.\n\nA: Blueutil is a neat little command line tool to do this. It's free and comes with the source code.  If you have homebrew installed, you can install it via brew install blueutil.\n\nUsage:\nPrint bluetooth status\nblueutil\nSwitch bluetooth on\nblueutil --power 1 or blueutil -p 1\nSwitch bluetooth off\nblueutil --power 0 or blueutil -p 0\n\nWorks just fine on a Macbook Pro running Lion (10.7.3) and Mac mini running Snow Leopard (10.6.8). You will get some errors if you switch off the bluetooth whilst a magic mouse is connected, it still works though :)\n\nA: The following worked for me (OSX 10.7.5) to turn bluetooth ON from the command line (using commands found here):\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth ControllerPowerState -int 1\n\nsudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.blued.plist\nsudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.blued.plist\n\n(I ran into the problem that I disabled bluetooth and then on the next system start I could not use the wireless keyboard anymore... so no logging in from the screen but I could log in via ssh. And it was not clear to me how to install software such as blueutil from the command line as suggested by @binarybob )\n\nA: This opensource mac command line tool supposedly does that, and a whole lot more:\nhttps://github.com/guarinogabriel/Mac-CLI\n\nThe ultimate tool to manage your Mac. It provides a huge set of command line commands that automatize the usage of your OS X system.\n\n", "Q: Google Chat somehow causes my wifi connection to drop I work at home, and for the past week or so, the wifi connection on my MacBook has been extremely flaky. Over the course of the day, the wifi will repeatedly disconnect and then reconnect about 10 seconds later. This occurs as infrequently as once every few hours, or as frequently as every 10 minutes.\nIf I look at my router (or run Network Diagnostics) when this happens, I can confirm that the actual Internet connection isn't dropping; it's just the wifi. Furthermore, the wifi network remains listed as a nearby network when the connection drops, so to me this suggests that the network itself is okay, and it's just my computer disconnecting and reconnecting for some reason.\nNow for the twist: this appears to only happen when I'm signed onto Google Chat through iChat. I have never seen it happen otherwise (I guess it could just be coincidence, but that seems pretty unlikely since I've been observing it for about a week now).\nWhat can I do about this? Is Google Chat really the culprit, or something else?\n\nA: I never exactly figured out what the issue is, and this might just be coincidence, but I recently upgraded to Lion (and installed Messages Beta over iChat) and have not seen this issue since. I'm going to tentatively say this is resolved...\n", "Q: Keeping photos between Lion and iOS synchronised I own iPhoto on both platforms. Is it possible to keep the photos synchronised between the phone and mac? \nI don't mean simply transferring them from phone to mac when WIFI is available. I want when I delete a photo from the computer to have it deleted on the phone automatically. Or alternatively when photos are synched from phone to mac, they should get deleted on phone.\nIs either of the above possible with iPhoto? I can't find an option for it at any obvious place.\n\nA: Simply, no. Pretty much the only thing the two apps share is a name right now. They're quite independent of each other.\n\nA: Can you not use iCloud for this?\n", "Q: How to remove the default application for opening a file? How do you remove the default open with application for a file extension? Not change it but remove it so when I try to open it a popup says \"There is no application set to open the document “file.blabla”.\n\nA: Use RCDefaultApp. With it, you can set the file association to <disabled>\nAnother option is to use the command line and lsregister. lsregister is located in /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/ To see all the available commands, run /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister. See this article for more information.\n\nA: @Manav proposes in a comment a straightforward and non intrusive way which worked perfectly for me, and I think should be an answer. In a terminal window, run:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -u /Applications/Foo.app && killall Finder\n\nA: All you need to do is right click on the file that you want to open, click \"get info\" (in the dropdown list) then click \"Open with\" \n\nAfter that, select the application you want to open it up with, and select \"Change all\"\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Amazon Instant on Xbox 360 via OS X Is there a way to view Amazon Instant Video content on the XBox 360 via OS X?

My friends do have this. How to it get these buttons to show up?\n\nA: You may be looking at a subscribed contacts list, rather than one of your own that you have read/write access to.  Go 'back' all the way to list you contacts accounts, and ensure you are actually looking at your own contacts.\n\nA: This happened to a friend's new iPhone. It appears to be a bug in iOS 5. The solution is to enable iCloud synching for your contacts. Then the '+' button should appear. The edit button should be there also. You can then turn off iCloud synching if you'd like. But it looks like to have to do iCloud synching at least once. \n", "Q: Enable URL rewriting (mod_rewrite) using .htaccess files in ~/Sites on Lion I cannot get mod_rewrite to work on Lion. I am developing a number of websites locally, in ~/Sites, using .htaccess files. I am on 10.7.3 and I have not touched any configuration files except for enabling PHP in httpd.conf (which works).\nI know there are at least 2 questions about this here, but the solutions detailed there don't work. Nor do the other solutions that I have found on the web. I must be doing something stupid or overlooking something, or else I am probably going crazy, but it's not working.\nI've tried all the usual stuff:\n\n\n*\n\n*In /private/etc/apache2/users/<myusername>.conf, change AllowOverride None to AllowOverride All and restart the web server\n\n*Additionally, in /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf, change any/all occurrence(s) of AllowOverride None to AllowOverride All -- I've tried it in all the various places where these directives are found\n\n*Try basically all possible combinations of values for the Options line above/below the AllowOverride line, including the values: Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks All\nAlways restarting the web server after such a change, of course. None of this works. All my clean urls simply do not work; I get a 404 - not found. Apache's error log just gives me \"File does not exist:\" errors. So it seems that the mod_rewrite module is not even working at all.\nI made sure that mod_rewrite is loaded in the httpd.conf, which it is; it is so by default on a Lion install.\nThe crazy thing is that everything had been working perfectly -- until I migrated to a new machine running Lion. That is, I am ruling out an error in my .htaccess files because I know it worked before. Also, if it was an error in the .htaccess, I would get some kind of error message from the mod_rewrite module in Apache's error_log, at least telling me that the module itself is being called. But this is not happening.\nAm I overlooking something? Do I have to change config settings someplace else? Do I have to change PHP's config? Why are the instructions (like How to activate mod_rewrite on MacOSX Lion and getting mod_rewrite to work on Mac OS X) working for other people but not for me? :)\nI've wasted hours on this already. Any help would be VERY appreciated.\n\nA: You should make sure that in your /etc/apache2/users/username.conf you have the following:\n<Directory \"/Users/username/Sites/\">\n    Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymlinks\n    AllowOverride All\n    Order allow,deny\n    Allow from all\n</Directory>\n\nThe FollowSymlinks and AllowOverride are essential here. While you are hinting at both in your question, maybe you did not configure these correctly in tandem.\nMake sure in httpd.conf /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf is included as well. It is by default.\nAfter any modifications, restart the web server for the changes to take effect.\nIf you are still having problems, maybe there is a problem with your actual rewrite rules. Were you using them in a .htaccess context before as well? Note that in a .htaccess, the rewrite rule regex is matched against a request URI without the leading slash and always relative to the directory where the .htaccess resides, whereas in a global httpd.conf the URI must match with a leading slash and is relative to the web root. Because assumedly you have your .htaccess in a subdirectory of ~/Sites, your rewrite rules might behave different from when the .htaccess resides in the web root of a (virtual) host.\nTo debug mod_rewrite you can enable rewrite logging. You should enable that in /etc/apache2/httpd.conf:\nRewriteLogLevel 3\nRewriteLog /path/to/rewrite.log\n\n\nA: Adding Options +FollowSymLinks worked fine for me \nOptions +FollowSymLinks\n\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteBase /\nRewriteRule\n\n\nA: I was experiencing a similar problem where my .htaccess file was being completely ignored while in a subfolder inside my ~/Sites directory under a VirtualHost that was setup correctly.\nHaving spent the last hour playing around with different configuration files and setting AllowOverride All in various places, I finally found out that the .htaccess file, while it looked like a .htaccess file in Finder, was actually a .htaccess.txt file with the extension hidden.\nTo check and change your .htaccess file, right click on it and choose Get Info and then make sure to remove any leading extension from the end, such as the one I had:\n\nAnd now it works!\n\nA: Below .htaccess entries fix for me \nOptions Indexes FollowSymLinks\n\n\n<ifModule mod_rewrite.c>\n\nRewriteEngine On\n#RewriteBase /~charles/Sites/Timesheet/\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [NC,QSA,L]\n\n\n</ifModule>\n\n\nA: Placing .htaccess into /Library/WebServer/Documents and open \"localhost/\"; to test it, works as expected. It just doesn't work in \"~/Sites\". Thanks Niels Heidenreich for this!\n\nA: When you type:\n/Users/username/app_name\nThe / refers to the root of the webserver:\n\"localhost/\"\nIf you use /~username/app_name in your rewrite it should work.\n", "Q: Uninstall MySQL I'm trying to get a working copy of MAMP. But I once installed the MySQL server seperately, and I can't find a way to uninstall.\n \nHow can I uninstall this version of MySQL?\n\nA: The answer to this superuser question and this stackoverflow question both say approximately the same thing, that you need to perform the following actions:\n\nIf you haven't yet rebooted your computer, the process could still be\n  running. First, reboot.\nThen if MySQL is still showing up after a reboot, from the Terminal,\n  issue the following commands one at a time:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*sudo rm /usr/local/mysql \n  \n*sudo rm -rf /usr/local/mysql* \n  \n*sudo rm -rf /Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM \n  \n*sudo rm -rf /Library/PreferencePanes/My*\n  \n*rm -rf ~/Library/PreferencePanes/My* \n  \n*sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/mysql* \n  \n*sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/MySQL*\nAnd using your text editor of choice:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Edit /etc/hostconfig and remove the line MYSQLCOM=-YES-\nIf you still cannot install or run a different version of MySQL, you might have to\n  issue one last command in the Terminal:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*sudo rm -rf /var/db/receipts/com.mysql.mysql*\n\n\nA: You should check the following folders:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Applications\n\n*/Developer\n\n*/Library\n\n*/System/Library\n\n*/Users/your_user/Applications\n\n\nIt's bound to be in one of them!\nOnce you find the app, I suggest using AppZapper to completely remove it.\nUpdated: If you still can't find it open the terminal and run:\nsudo find / -name \"mysql\n\nIf there's any mysql executable in your computer it will find it\n", "Q: iTunes Home Sharing on Apple TV drops after a few minutes on Belkin N750 Just bought an Apple TV and connected to my TV and all looks good. I'm having an issue with Home Sharing, however. The library is found, I play something from the library, it plays for about three minutes, then drops. I then cannot find the library in the \"Computers\" section of Apple TV. If I then quit iTunes and start it again, it shows up again on the Apple TV and I can start again only to be dropped three minutes later. I have seen some posts blaming the router not supporting Bonjour. I am on the phone now with Belkin.\nUsing: Apple TV connected via HDMI to a Panasonic LED TV, streaming from a MacBook Air 2010\nI really think this is a Home Sharing issue.\n\nA: Working with Belkin we found an update to the Belkin router that fixed the issue. You may want to update if you are not up to date, version: 1.00.49. The standard update check in the router settings did NOT find this update. \nen-us-support.belkin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5359\n", "Q: Is there a Safari shortcut that always works to reopen last-closed tab? Note: this is not a duplicate of How can I get Safari to reopen my last closed tab?\nI am familiar with the shortcut ⌘+Z working when the tab was just closed. However, I often do something else that I don't want to undo.\nFor instance, I sometimes close a tab, write half and answer on Stack Exchange, realize I didn't want to close it, and am then stuck with accessing the history manually.\nSo, is there any Safari shortcut or menu item specifically for reopening my last closed tab?\nUpdate: This isn't a fix, but if your only problem is not wanting to undo anything besides closed tabs (and you don't care about having something that'll always work), setting a shortcut for \"Undo Close Tab\" in Keyboard preferences will filter the shortcut to closed tabs only!\n\nA: The answer is no, Safari does not provide any built-in functionality or shortcut (to the non-existing functionality) to restore the last closed tab.\nThe only functionality that Safari currently offers is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reopen last closed window\n\n*Undo Close Tab (as part of the Undo event chain) \n\n\nThe first does just that, re-opens the last closed window, including all the tabs that were open when it closed.\nThe second works as you already know, it only works if it's the last thing you did, or you have to undo other things which is the caveat you noted above.\nLooking at Safari Extensions, there are a few Tab managers around, however none of them specifically note their support for Tab Undo's except SafariTabs and this functionality was removed from the product for Safari 5; as the developer notes that Safari 5 now provides this as part of the Undo chain\nDeveloping a solution for this while it's not trivial, isn't something that is going to be impossible as Apple have done most of the hard work. :D\nSafari provides event propagation to Safari Extensions, and the particular one you would be interested in is CloseEvent (SafariEvent).  Of course determining a method of distinguishing between the CloseEvent's for Windows (with each Tab receiving its own CloseEvent) and singular Tab CloseEvents... well there's the hard work.\n\nA: With the new macOS Sierra, it is possible to use the keyboard shortcut ⌘⇧T to reopen the last closed tab – à la Chrome and other browsers.\nThe previous shortcut, ⌘Z, allowed you to reopen closed tabs, but was more of a \"general purpose\" button which allowed you to reopen closed tabs, but also to undo other actions. The new shortcut is specifically meant to reopen closed tabs.\n\nA: If you are using Keyboard Maestro you could emulate this behaviour with a HotKey trigger. Even multiple restore tabs / windows. I did an initial run at it. Thats the gist of it. Note: this doesn't restore the history of the tabs. So you'll get the URL back, but won't be able to go back.\n\nA: It's ⌘-z.\nIt will only open the last closed tab. If you close more tabs, those tabs will not be opened.\n", "Q: How do I tag books in CloudReaders? I have the CloudReaders app on my iPad.

However, when I attempt to manually forward a meeting invite I've received, I notice that an ical attachment is present.  I can then manually add it to my calendar.  Not so bad!\nHowever, it would be even cooler if the IPad \"auto-added\" the ical notice to my calendar as the emails (with icals attached) arrive.  Is there a way to configure an auto-accept (particularly an auto-accept from a specific e-mail address)?\np.s. And while we're discussing this, does anyone know why Outlook would fail to execute the rule I defined?\n\nA: You can configure Exchange on your iPad by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings\n\n*Go to Mail, Contacts, Calendars\n\n*Tap on Add Account\n\n*Tap on Microsoft Exchange\n\n*Fill in the information for your company's Exchange account.

I've got a late 2010 MacBook Air that came with OS X 10.6.6 installed; I have never upgraded it to 10.6.8 Snow Leopard or to 10.7 Lion. \nI dual boot with Windows 7 installed using boot camp. I use rEFIt as my boot loader.\nDisk Utility in OS X shows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Macintosh HD is partition 2 \n\n*partition 3 is an empty FAT partition\n\n*Windows HD is partition 4\n\n\nI don't know why partition 1 doesn't show up there.

OS X upgrades are aware of other partitions so it shouldn't break anything.\nBy the way, I know this is not question, but I used to use Boot Camp, but find Parallels a much better experience overall. Disclaimer, I'm a .net developer.\n\nA: You won't break Bootcamp by upgrading Mac OS X, but it may complain on attempting the upgrade that it cannot do it.  Some configurations of Bootcamp from older macs put the partition for Bootcamp as the 3rd partition on a disk.  In these cases, Lion is unable to create a recovery partition at the start of the disk, as the Bootcamp partition won't boot from position 4.\nBut you can check for this, look in Disk Utility, and if you only have 2 partitions, then you're likely looking peachy :)\n", "Q: What is the purpose of \"Apply Rules\" in mail?

I use my MacBook Pro to run the projector at my school assemblies and I'd like to be able to switch away from the slideshow without it disappearing.\n\nA: This, unfortunately, does not appear to be possible. See the question comments for more details.\n\nA: The only solution I have found that's remotely workable is to augment your hardware list and use iOS to present the keynote so your computer is free to assist your teaching without interrupting the display of the keynote.\nThis has several disadvantages - one of which is not obvious and continually irks me (the undocumented translation bugs).\n\n\n*\n\n*You now need two devices - a pair of iPod touches or a combination of iPad / iPhone / iPod so that you can have one driving the display and the other as a remote to control the presentation.\n\n*Added time to sync the presentation to iOS.\n\n*Potentially problems driving the projector - Macs can drive more legacy video formats than iOS can with adapters. Yes, there is a $200 adapter for just about anything - but this cost is not trivial for most in education.\n\n*iOS Keynote is not as capable as Mac Keynote and many transitions are dumbed down or not at all possible. (Worse - not all the limitations/bugs in translation are documented at the prior link)\n\n\nHowever, if you have an iPhone, can present from another iOS device and don't mind the translation limitations - this is a fabulous and very robust presentation solution. One benefit is that you can use bluetooth or wireless and walk anywhere in the classroom while controlling the presentation. \n\nA: A possible solution is to abandon keynote.\nSolution 1:\nMS Office includes Power Point.  Have no idea how this works on Mac.\nSolution 2:\nKeynote has the possibility to save to html.  HTML has the possibility to load another page after a X second pause. \nNote that you could also add links to next/previous pages for manual forward/back. \nThis would require that you edit the page to add the header line to automatically load the next page.\nI don't know how keynote handles any build-ins and actions.  You may be reduced to static pages.\n\nA: It was possible in the original Keynote 6 release, but isn't now. You could simply press the \"h\" key and the window with the presenter controls would disappear, making it possible to work while you tested your presentation (fixing issues without restarting the presentation, for example). Apple has since \"fixed\" it, so it always takes up every inch of space on every monitor. I like to have Netflix running on a monitor while I work, but now Keynote hides it and disables the audio, so I guess the days of multitasking on the Mac are numbered.\nMaybe Apple is trying to force their workspace layout on us, just like they did with iOS 7? If so, they should have released Keynote 6 with the new iOS 7 medical warning: \"May cause dizziness, nausea and disorientation. Consult your doctor before use if you have a history of epilepsy or seizures.\" (from the iOS 7 update notes, only visible on iOS 6)\n", "Q: Sharing iTunes purchases My daughter shares a mac with me and we often want the same songs but have separate iTunes accounts. How do we share our music so we don't pay twice for the song on the same computer?\n\nA: Copy the protected music file as you would normally.  When you play for the first time any protected files from a specific iTunes account, it will prompt you to authorize the machine.  I believe the current limit is 5 machines, and you'll have to be connected to the internet when you enter your credentials, but after that it will be able to play any song from that account.\nYou can also look into iTunes Match, though honestly I've encountered so many issues, I can't recommend it outright.\n", "Q: Return vs. Enter? I noticed that my MacBook's keyboard has the word enter above the return key. I also noticed that on Mac OS X, there's a special symbol for return ↩, and another for enter ⌤. How would I send the enter key if my MacBook has no numpad?\nIs there any difference between these two keys?\n\nA: On a MacBook with no number pad, the key combination fnreturn produces the Enter key. Individual programs can decide whether to treat the two keys as separate or the same. Many programs treat them the same.\nThe only example I have been able to come up with that still treats the two keys separately is iTunes: when browsing tracks, return starts playing the track, while enter (or fnreturn) enters track rename mode.\n\nA: Enter and Return are often interchangeable, particularly on Windows systems where the distinction is even less obvious that with some other OS.\nThe key is in the codes the the keys actually send when you press them - we all know what we intend, when we use those keys, but what does the computer see?  The answer is that is either sees a command for New Line, or a Carriage Return.\nThese are 2 separate commands and they do different things - think of a typewriter; a new line is like advancing the barrel moving the paper up one line, carriage return returns the whole sheet of paper back to the left margin as well as advancing the paper up.  The symbols almost reflect this; ↩ (new line and return) or ⌤ (doesn't really indicate new line, but does indicate a stationary cursor; see example later)\nNow, sometimes (Yep, Windows) no matter what you input, you get a carriage return, as the OS doesn't distinguish between the 2. But on other OS it does give you 2 different meanings.  As such, an Enter is often used to move onto the next item, with Return signifying an end to the input and a return to the beginning.  The difference between the 2 in many programs might be something like the following:\nDear Sirs,⌤\n          What's the difference between Enter and Return?⌤\n                                                         Many Thanks,⌤\n                                                                     Stuffe⌤\n\nOr\nDear Sirs,↩\nWhat's the difference between Enter and Return?↩\nMany Thanks,↩\nStuffe↩\n\nThere isn't quite such a clean analogy on modern systems, but that's the historical starter for 10.  This then get's muddled by the fact that, actually these days we often use TAB in place of Enter, think of filling a web form in.\n\nA: Maybe a bit of history is in order:\nThe first time a larger group of people required keyboards, these were data entry clerks, who had undergone the specialist training required to type fast.\nFor a typist to work without looking at the keyboard, their arms should not have to move, so you'd keep your fingers either on the home row (for alphanumeric input) or on the numeric pad. If the form requires both text and numbers, there would typically be two sections (which is why several forms ask for the city first, then the zip code, and only numbers afterwards, the origin of \"1-Male/2-Female\").\nAs a compromise between form entry and typing longer texts, the default mapping for the large key on the right of the alphanumerics area became Return, which inserts a line break; in order to advance to the next form field, Shift-Return provides another Enter key (which is why the word \"Enter\" is printed on the key).\nThis distinction has largely fallen out of use today as typing is no longer a specialist job, but computers in the home need to be intuitively understandable (rather than easy to use), and people have grown accustomed to using the Tab key to move between fields (which is actually quite cumbersome when your hand is placed so the index finger is on the f and the Ctrl key is still reachable).\n\nA: I was using Word for Mac and was looking for the shortcut to insert a page break. When searching the internet, it was the first time I encountered the difference between Return and Enter on the Mac keyboard. There is a shortcut to insert a page break (Shift-Enter) and one to insert a line break (Shift-Return). \nBefore reading this thread, I wasn't able to understand the difference, but after trying with (fn+Return) to produce the (Enter) key, it actually worked. So to insert the page break, I need to hold down the fn and shift keys and press Return.\n\nA: Microsoft Word makes a difference between Return en Enter. By using the Return key a new paragraph  is made. By using the Shift-Return key you'll get, what is called in an old fashioned way, a Carriage Return en Line Feed. The difference can only been seen by going \"under water\", which is using the special P character in the top bar.\nThe use of this distinction is becoming clear when using illustrations or figures in a document. In WORD an illustration is connected to a paragraph. By using the paragraphs as they are supposed to be used the illustration remains near or in the text of the paragraph.\n\nA: Enter on Mac OS was sometimes used as an Action key, where Return was used to purely for text editing.  So, in a text area on a form, you could input text with line breaks and press Enter to accept the form.  These days the distinction has mostly been lost.\nBBEdit uses Enter in the shell worksheet to execute the current line or selection in a shell.\nThe old Apple development environment MPW Shell also had this functionality.\nScript Editor uses Enter to compile the current script.\n\nA: Fn+Return (Enter on MacBook Pro) reformats AppleScript code in Keyboard Maestro.\n", "Q: If I download OSX Lion from the app-store, is that version linked to my account? I have downloaded Lion and created a bootable USB flash drive, a colleague wishes to use this. If I give this to my colleague will it be linked to my account or is it account independent?\nUpdate: My colleague has a legal licensee to Lion but does not have a Lion install DVD. This is due to replacing a failed HDD in a Mac Pro. Instead of my colleague needing to download a 4GB file which they can't afford to I have a USB drive which I can lend to them.\nAs I remember Lion asks your apple ID when you first start up, is this the step that assigns your instance against your account or is my ID somehow embedded in the Lion copy I have.\n\nA: I don't believe that your Apple ID is embedded in the installer, it may be but if it is, it doesn't matter. I downloaded Lion onto my iMac and installed it, and copied the installer to my Mac Mini (offline only computer) and installed it as well no problem. This was right when Lion came out too, and I has worked perfectly on both computers since.\n", "Q: Has anybody had problems with Application Loader 2.5.1 update?

Short version: Does anyone know if X.509 client certificates are supposed to work on the iPad for IMAP mail? Am I wasting my time trying to get a feature that doesn't work to work? If the built-in mail app doesn't support IMAP with X.509 client certs (ie: they only work with Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync accounts), are there any 3rd party apps that do?\nOnly iOS 5.1 or newer is of interest; 5.1 is the version I've been testing with.\n\nI'm the admin of a network that's required by policy to use X.509 client certificates to protect all external communication, including our IMAP mail server (Cyrus IMAPd) and SMTP server (postfix). Neither will accept a connection without the client presenting a valid X.509 client certificate. Disabling the client certificate requirement is not an option for me, and we aren't permitted to tunnel traffic in via VPN for similar reasons.\nWe now have iPad users who want to connect to our network, and are finding the iPad to be a bit of a problem.\nFor users on desktop machines we usually install Thunderbird, as it has rock solid IMAP with excellent client certificate support; it \"just works\" and is the same to support on every platform. This isn't an option for iPad.\nUnfortunately the iPad's built-in Mail app doesn't seem to cope with client certificates for IMAP. I can install our org's root cert and the user's client cert using the iPhone Configuration Utility. Both are shown as \"verified\" in Settings->General->Profiles.  The iPad then accepts our server as trusted and omits any warnings about the server's identity not being verified.\nMail still fails to send a client certificate when one is demanded so the server terminates the handshake. It doesn't prompt the user to select one, nor does it automatically send the client certificate it has installed for the user that matches the CA certificate presented by the server.\nExamination of the traffic flow between client and server shows that the TLS negotiation fails when the iPad responds with an empty set of client certificates when client certificates are demanded by the server. See below.\nWhen connected to the internal network over encrypted WiFi, where no client cert is required to get mail, the device connects and downloads mail just fine. External access (public WiFi or over 3G) fails, whether I use the IMAPs port 993 with \"Use SSL\" checked or the IMAP+TLS port 143 with or without \"Use SSL\" checked. Other than the apparent lack of client certificate negotiation support for IMAP, it's perfect.\nReferences to client certificate support in the documentation for Apple's \"Enterprise support\" only appear where Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync is discussed, and where Cisco VPN support is discussed.\nThere are a few questions on Apple's discussion forums, but no recent ones and no useful answers. I'd link to them, but Apple's forums are \"down for maintenance\" at the moment.\nAs a workaround I can probably set up a locked down VPN using the iPad's automatic VPN connection support to talk to a client-cert authed IPSec VPN that can only talk to the IMAP and SMTP servers on the appropriate ports plus DNS, nothing else. It'd be a pretty gruesome hack to have to perpetrate though.\n\nBTW, the client<->server conversation is:\n\n\n*\n\n*C -> S      TLSv1    Client Hello\n\n*S -> C      TLSv1    Server Hello \n\n*S -> C      TLSv1    Certificate, Certificate Request, Server Hello Done\n                    (Sends server cert, signing root cert, \n                     DN of accepted client cert signer which happens to be the same as the root that signed the server cert)\n\n*C -> S      TLSv1    Certificate\n                    (empty set of certificates, zero certs included)\n\n*S -> C      TLSv1    Handshake failure\n\n\nIn other words, the server says \"this is me, I expect you to provide a certificate signed by  authority to prove who you are\" and the client replies with \"Um, my papers are in this empty envelope here. Look, a cassowary!\"\nThe client has the root cert installed, and has a client cert installed that has the signer DN demanded by the server.\n\nA: See the comments above where the asker reports that they never got this to work. \nSo on iOS 5.1, X.509 certificates will not easily be of use to secure email on iOS without some engineering effort and perhaps not at all.\n\nA: The question appears to be specific to using X.509 for authentication to an IMAP service, which isn't supported by iOS.  S/MIME email encryption and signatures can be performed on iOS, but the authentication to mail services will still use username/password over SSL or TLS.\n", "Q: What version of Bluetooth does Magic Mouse need? Just wondering what minimum Bluetooth version does the Magic Mouse need?\n\nA: According to this article, Magic Mouse uses Bluetooth 2.1.\n\nA: On the Magic Mouse Apple page they don't mention a specific Bluetooth version, they just say you need a Mac with a Bluetooth connection:  \n\n\nA: The Magic Mouse was introduced in 2009 and has been part of the standard iMac package since that time. While Apple's Magic Mouse page doesn't explicitly list the Bluetooth versions that it works with, Apple Support shows that the early 2009 iMac featured Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR (Enhanced Data Rate). The current 2011 iMac does as well. The 2009 and 2011 versions of the 15\" MacBook Pro also use the same version of Bluetooth.\nWith the consistency of the Bluetooth versions for both the 15\" MBP and iMac since 2009, I believe that it's fairly safe to conclude that Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR is required for the Magic Mouse.\n", "Q: What is this button on my MacBook? I have a 2011 MacBook. Along the left edge (looking at it from the normal typing position), near the front, there is a small silver button which is flush with the rest of the case. When pressed, a small series of tiny lights beside it flash green before going dark again. Nothing else happens.\nCan anyone explain what this button does?\n\nA: This allows to check the charge of your battery. When the battery is full all the green lights should flash.\n\nA: This is your battery capacity indicator. The number of lit dots indicates how much battery you have left.\n\n\nA: It's a battery capacity indicator, as noted in this Apple Support KB:\n\nThe battery indicator lights are located along the left side of the\n  computer. This allows for quick and easy verification of the battery's\n  charge status while the computer remains solidly in-place.\nWhen you press the battery indicator light button, the corresponding\n  flashes (or pattern of flashes) presents either the current charge\n  status or a diagnostic status.\n\nThe KB also has a chart of the behavior shown when the indicator is pressed.\n", "Q: iTunes reporting phantom songs on iPhone 4 I've been trying to work out whats going wrong on my iTune library\nWhen I was syncing my iPhone tonight I noticed that under iPhone>Music there were approx. 150 songs that were grey with a \"sync\" symbol against them as well as a check mark.\nI was using iTunes Match with no problem up to now.\nI switched off Match and synced.  nada.\nI deleted all the music on the iPhone using General>Usage>Music.

If the issue persists, then in all likelihood there is a hardware issue present.\nI did find this link to a discussion for other iPhone 4S users with the same/similar issue (or with the Volume Up), at least one of which was resolved by the Genius taking the iPhone apart to find a piece of material in the switch assembly causing the issue.\n\nA: Sounds like your down button is stuck, or sticking, or has a bad contact.

Bunch up your duvet, and fling your phone into it at high speed\n\n\nBasically, you're just trying to either loosen off the mechanism, remove any crap trapped underneath, and prevent any sticking or unwanted contact etc.\nI can't see it as being a software issues at all, personally.\n\nA: I used to have an iphone 3G and now I own an iphone 4. It has happened both times to me and still happens. But now I am pretty sure that it is a software issue. I am saying this, because, even though I have this problem in the last two months on my iphone 4, two days ago, after I ended a conversation through Viber app, momentarily the volume returned to its normal levels as I tried to type something, but it decreased again in moments. And that happened again about an hour ago, same situation.\n\nA: Heyy guys this actually just happened to me, and i tried cleaning it, wobbling the volume side buttons and eerything. But then I turned it off, and waited for a couple minutes, and then turned it back on. And it solved the problem!\n\nA: I have a 5.

I can use them with their full functionally within seconds. But the login items take up to another half minute to start. I should probably mention that the boot process takes only sixteen seconds (power button → desktop).\nOn a 'clean' start the login items will load right after the desktop appears.\nQuestion\nWhy does it take so long to load menu-extras with \"reopen when logging back in\" enabled?\n\n[Update: march 2013] This behavior is still persistent as of Mountain Lion 10.8.3.\n\nA: It appears to me that the login items get started after all the applications from the last session have started up. For example, an older version of Adium used to hang (due to no internet connection being available) for a few seconds after starting up, and as soon as Adium was responsive, the login items got started.\n\nA: I think the culprit is iTunes syncing with iPhones etc. through the network, and the system waits for that to finish before it loads startup items.\n", "Q: Lion : Assigning a fullscreen app to a space With SnowLeopard, I was using spaces, with two spaces.

First let me say this is my first Mac so i know nothing of anything as far as Macs go.\nI notice that the Macbook Pro, unlike any Windows laptop I've ever had, from what I see, doesn't have any air vents. Is this possible or am I missing something?\nI'm a bit tense because when I travel I put it in a tight sleeve case and I'm paranoid that it'll suffocate and burn out if it can't breathe when its on.\nDoes it have vents somewhere to dissipate heat? If no, can it be put in a tight pleather case and it be ok or should I still turn it completely off when in a case?\n\nA: *\n\n*Four vents exist on the retina Macbook Pro 15\".\n\n*Two vents exist on the non-retina Macbook Pro 15\", 17\" models.\n\n*One vent only on the Macbook Air 11\" & 13\" and non-retina Macbook Pro 13\".\n\n\nThe outflow vents are located right 'between' the display and keyboard on the vertical rear face of the unibody frame. Shine a light on the display hinge from above and below and you can see the little holes best when looking down along the display from a very steep angle.\nWhile the non-retina MBP take all of the inflowing air from the remaining space next to the outflow vents of the display hinge - the retina Macbook Pro has an additional two vents for air intake on the side where external ports are located.\nApple has done an amazing job at the dB noise they make when idle (~2000rpm).\nWhen the fans kick in because of heavy CPU/GPU usage you'll definitely hear them. They will go up to ~6000rpm. Tracking fan RPM with software will be your best method to know if the case you have is insulating the frame. Increased idle fan speed will compensate for a case that insulates the frame and traps heat from below. The unibody frame in in close thermal contact with the CPU/GPU so a good proportion of the idle heat actually escapes through the keyboard and topcase.\nYou might also be interested in Apple's advice for Mac care.\n\n[picture from ifixit]\n\nA: With no video connections activating clamshell mode, your Pro will sleep when you close the screen.

I know Synology and QNAP offers compatibility with Mac World (using AFP), but i'm sure they use EXT filesystem as main partition. \nIs this correct to use Ext partition either for 'existing' Mac datas ? \nThank you!\n\nA: I recently needed to replace an old NAS at home, and the cheapest option for my requirement was actually to build one and install FreeNAS on it.\nYou can add as many drives as your chassis will take, configure them to be RAID, mirrored, or independent, use UFS/ZFS on the partitions, and configure your shares as Windows, CIFS, or AFP with individual user accounts, groups, or getting permissions from an LDAP server.\nOnce you're set-up (which takes about 10 minutes from the CD) you're ready to go with a web interface which controls everything else.\nWhile it's not HFS+, it is AFP capable out of the box so to speak, and works perfectly on my network with 2 Apple computers, and a Windows computer. It contains all of the resource fork information (meta data), and of course you can copy any existing data to it from anywhere else on the network.\nPerformance on a box like this is also going to be a lot better than most low to mid range NAS boxes too, which may be important with multiple users accessing large files. I backed up 580gb in just over an hour on a gigabit LAN connection.\n\nA: You don't say how the server mac is sharing the HFS+ formatted drive. I would suspect it is AFP in which case the NAS drive format is largely irrelevant.\nThe NAS will store files on it's storage in whatever format is best for the OS of the NAS, and expose those files through network shares in a single or a variety of formats. The client machines mount the shares and should be unaware of the underlying storage (just as they will be unaware that it will likely be a RAID configuration of some sort)\nSynology, QNAP, Netgear, Drobo and many many others all adopt this approach. \nThe major factor is getting a NAS supplier who fully supports AFP and does not just see it as an afterthought to be tagged on with a bog standard install of the AFP packages which may be out of date or have not been tested or tuned. The introduction of Lion saw a number of NAS devices with difficulties sharing AFP until they could be patched. Of course during this period the users could have switched to using CIFS shares and keep going.\n\nA: Since the Mac OS family is the only one (that I'm aware of at least) that uses HFS, you'll probably have to run the NAS on a Mac.  Properly configured, a Mac Mini isn't a bad option, but your costs may be approximately double of a comparable Linux-based NAS which uses EXT.\nIf your goal is to use the existing drive or clone it to a new drive for longevity, you may find that many linux-based options support this use-case.  diskutil indeed has an hfsplus module in some flavors, but YMMV.\nIf, on the other hand you are attempting to clone it to the boot disk, your only option is to use a Mac.\n", "Q: Can no longer email myself a .epub file and open in iBooks? (used to be able to) I used to email myself some .epub files (using Gmail), and then on the iPad, in the email program, click on the .epub file and then choose to open in iBooks, and read, highlight, and add notes to the ebook.  What is amazing is that all the highlighting and added notes will sync across my iPad and iPhone whenever I have the same .epub file on that device.\nHowever, recently, I tried doing the same for the new iPad (3rd Gen), but it can download the .epub file alright, showing it as 5.5MB, but when I click on that file after the download, it won't ask me to open in iBooks any more (and won't open anything or ask what application to open it).\nIs there a way to solve this (or is this a bug).  Can Dropbox or Box.net solve this? Although, it is best if email can be used, because then not additional app is needed besides email which is always there.  (I label the email as \"ebooks\" using Gmail's label function, so that all the files can be easily listed out of thousands of emails).\n\nA: This feature hasn't been changed in iOS, so either the mail transport or client isn't faithfully preserving the file or you iOS device has issues and needs to go through troubleshooting.\nIf you have a second device, you could test setting up your mail account and see if it's a temporary (or permanent) mail issue.\nOtherwise, you'll need to work on narrowing down why your device isn't working as expected.\n", "Q: Simple File Transfer Logs This may be a general  Unix question rather than a OS X question.\nI want to log general file transfers on OS X, whether it be from and to the same system or to another system, but to keep it simple assume that this is all internal to one computer and file system.\nI simply want to be able to execute the mv command several times, then go back through a log file and see what was moved and where it was moved at a later time. The caveat is that I want to also log file transfers initiated the GUI when dragging folders and files into the same log file. \n(If it was a directory, it would also show the contents of what was moved in that directory.)\nAn Example might be these files created and moved in the terminal and in the GUI\n     1pm: $ vi testfile1.txt\n     2pm: $ mv testfile1.txt MyMovedFile.txt\n     2:30pm – GUI file moved  ~/myTestFile.txt ~/Documents/myTestFile.txt\n     3pm: $ mv MyMovedFile.txt MyNewFile.txt\n\nThe log would then show the history for me:\n     2pm: testfile1.txt MyMovedFile.txt\n     2:30pm ~/myTestFile.txt ~/Documents/myTestFile.txt\n     3pm: MyMovedFile.txt MyNewFile.txt\n\nIf it was really fancy, it may show me the return code of the file transfer also.\n\nA: Have a look at iosnoop or possibly fs_usage. Although what you want isn't easy to accomplish without major filtering, because \"file transfers\" can be a lot of different things at syscall level:\n\n\n*\n\n*mv on the same mount point will move a file\n\n*mv across mount points will create a new file at the destination and unlink the original\n\n*Other tools will do even more complex things, for example if you're downloading a file with a browser it will create an empty file and then append to it over time.\n\n\nBoth above tools rely on DTrace, which is a very powerful tracing framework and can probably be scripted to filter down to most of what you want, but it'll take some work. There are example scripts in /usr/bin/*.d (e.g. /usr/bin/iofile.d) and documentation can be found at Oracle (OS X DTrace is a port of the original Solaris version).\n", "Q: iTunes sync does not delete songs My wife's iPhone 4 has some albums synced on her iPhone that are not selected to be synced in iTunes.\nShe has \"Selected playlists, artists, albums and genres\" selected.\nShe is using a wired sync and Wireless Sync is disabled.\n/edit\nAll her content in iTunes, and that synced to the iPhone, is ripped from the original CD.\n/endedit\n\n\n*\n\n*No playlist contains this album\n\n*the artist is not selected\n\n*the album is not selected\n\n*no genres are ticked at all\n\n\nHow is the album still there after sync?\nPlease note, I told her about the ability to remove the album from within Music on the iPhone, this question is purely about why the album is still there after a sync with iTunes.\n/edit\nAll her content in iTunes, and that synced to the iPhone, is ripped from the original CD.  She is not using iTunes Match.\n/endedit\n\nA: \"Sync only checked songs and videos\" was un-ticked.\nWhen an iOS device is connected to iTunes, under the device's Summary tab, the Options section has a checkbox Named \"Sync only checked songs and videos\"; this option enforces the removal of music that is not set to sync if it has been synced to the device in the past.\nTicking the box and then syncing removed the offending album.\n\n\nA: You can use DiskAid to safely access the iOS file system and delete Music/Data. The app costs $24.99, but you can get it for free on an educational license (have a .edu email ID).\nFailing that, a restore might be the best option.\nMy bad, I didn't read the question properly.\nThis Apple forum post seems to suggest that songs downloaded by iTunes Match are not 'synced' in with iTunes, but via the iCloud. Maybe, these albums are from iTunes Match?\nThat post also details a way to delete all music from your iPhone (as opposed to deleting individual songs or albums):\n\nYou can do this on your iPhone by going to Settings > General > Usage. Wait a few seconds for the usage statistics to appear, then choose Music. Tap Edit and then the delete symbol next to “All Music”.\nThis will delete all the music from the phone. After this songs will still be visible (with clouds next to them). You can still play them from iTunes Match and they will be downloaded again; this will not remove them from iTunes Match.\n\n: source\nDoes this answer your question?\n", "Q: Can the iPad have multiple users? I'm thinking of getting a \"household\" iPad (the new iPad) to be shared.  Can the iPad have multiple users?  Or is there another way to keep email accounts, Safari bookmarks, and Angry Birds scores separated between users?\n\nA: Apple really designed the iPad as a 1-to-1 device (one device to one person) so I don't think there is an EASY way.\nI know they have deployment products out there that might make it so you can remove and restore profiles, but it's not on the fly and I think it's very clunky.\nI also did a quick Google and noticed this software that is out in beta and is exactly what you want, but it looks quite experimental and your iPad needs to be jailbroken to install it: http://nowsci.com/userprofiles/\n\nA: When you first setup your iOS device, you are asked to enter an Apple ID (Apple says that you \"associate\" the device to your Apple ID).\nOn the iPad you need the ID in two cases:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*In Settings → iCloud you enter the Apple ID you’d like to use with iCloud.\n  \n*In Settings → Store you enter the Apple ID you want to use for store purchases.\n  \n\nAs Apple does not offer to enter multiple Apple IDs in iCloud for example, you cannot sync iCloud services of multiple users at the same time with one device. The only option is to share the Apple ID which is associated with the device.\n[source: Apple IDs and iCloud]\nHow many devices can be associated with an Apple ID? How fast can I change it?\n\nYour Apple ID can have up to 10 devices and computers (combined)\n  associated with it. Each computer must also be authorized using the\n  same Apple ID. Once a device or computer is associated with your Apple\n  ID, you cannot associate that device or computer with another Apple ID\n  for 90 days.\n\n[source:  Associating a device or computer to your Apple ID]\n\nA: Check out Apple Configurator (by Apple, it's free) Here it can be used for families and not just businesses, edu, institutions.\n\nA: \"Once a device or computer is associated with your Apple ID, you cannot associate that device or computer with another Apple ID for 90 days.\" \nThis is called a \"HOOK\" or \"GAFT\" or \"SHAFT\".  A feature that cripples the functionality of a device, \"   This is nothing more than corporate greed which Apple is famous for.  So Apple wants our working family of two teenagers, one child and two adults to each purchase a $600 iPad?  Another reason to pick Android which does \"all that\" allows multiple profiles, and thousands more free apps for $79 to $199.  \n", "Q: is it possible to use iCloud to share Pages files on a Mac amongst users I find the iCloud product to be confusing. Ideally, I'd like to be able to have a read only copy of a document pushed from one user to another user both on a mac. This would seem to be really straightforward to set up on a mac but it doesn't seem to be. Also thinking of using Dropbox but want to see if it can be done in iCloud. Any ideas on getting this to work? Or is iCloud really only for syncing amongst devices from the same user?\nthx \n\nA: The only way to share documents with other people via iCloud (at this time) would be to give them your iCloud password—not a great idea, particularly if it's also your iTunes Store ID.\nUsing the shared folder option of DropBox is sounder practice.\n\nA: You can share via iWork.com which is currently still in beta.\nHowever,\n\nAs of July 31, 2012, you will no longer be able to access your documents on the iWork.com site or view them on the web. [source]\n\nAnother option is to share via E-Mail.\n\n[picture taken from Keynote iOS]\nAlso see:\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud: About using iWork for iOS and iCloud\n\nA: you could share documents, like you do with Box and we use to do with ME with a little soft called CloudApp.\nFor me works fine and help me to break this iCloud limitations. You really could make a link to share with other people (no need to give your iCloud password, as jaberg says.\nFor me it works fine.\nAnother option is to share your iWork docs. I mean a specific doc, without giving access to the others like we use to do @ iWork.com.\nSee how in this tutorial video (not mine) http://reviews.cnet.co.uk/mobile-phones/how-to-sync-iwork-with-icloud-50004968/\n", "Q: How do I make Safari, Chrome, Mail, and other applications all use different SOCKS proxies How do I make different applications like Safari, Chrome, and Mail all use different SOCKS proxies.\nFireFox has it's own proxy settings, but Safari, Chrome, and presumably Mail all use the system proxy  settings.  I need them to all use different SOCKS proxies, all running simultaneously under the same user and login.\nI have all the SOCKS proxies set up on different ports already, each is proxies into a different company in a different country using ssh -D.\n\nA: You need a program like Proxycap. You can configure it like this.\n", "Q: 2 instances of Xcode installed? I originally installed Xcode via Apple's developer website (not through the App Store). Later on, I installed Xcode via the App Store.\nNow in Launchpad, I have two icons for each of these apps: Xcode, Instruments, Dashcode, and Quartz Composer. None of the icons have an \"X\" button to remove them from Launchpad.\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does this mean that I have 2 versions of Xcode installed?\n\n*If not, how can I verify that I only have one version installed?\n\n*How can I know which file each Launchpad icon is referencing?\n\n*If it's purely a cosmetic thing, how would I get rid of the second set of icons? (And does it matter which set I get rid of?)\n\n\nUpdate:\nI see that the /Developer folder contains an Applications folder, but it also contains SDKs, Documentation, Platforms, etc.\nMy /Applications folder contains the folder Developer. Inside of /Applications/Developer, there are 4 aliases which link to the /Developer folder. For example, the Xcode alias (/Applications/Developer/Xcode) links to /Developer/Applications/Xcode.app.\n\nA: If you have the latest Xcode (4.3.2 at time of writing) it should be in /Applications/Xcode. You may have an older Xcode in /Developer. /Developer is now no longer used by Xcode. You should remove it using the provided script if you don't need the old version any more. Execute \nsudo /Xcode4/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all\n\nand authenticate. When that script completes you can remove the /Developer folder entirely but you should allow Xcode's script to take care of its somewhat \"fragile\" installation first.\nNew Xcode lives in /Applications and is much more like a conventional Mac OS X app these days. Lots more information about putting it in the dock, finding other developer apps, command line tools etc. in this other answer of mine.\n\nA: 2 Xcode versions can co-exist on a mac, we use it in our company for checking backward compatibility. Till date, we have never faced any issues because of this.\n\nA: The old version of Xcode used to reside in /Developer whereas the current version has been moved to the standard /Applications.  Consider checking both locations for the program.  It is safe to delete the /Developer folder if you have the current version installed.\n", "Q: Why can't I make the partition use the full 500 GB availiable? I can't seem to make my Mac partition utilize the full 500 GB that I have available.\nIt only uses 243.47 GB.\nIt looks like my hard drive is somehow split into 2 sections:\n\nAny ideas on how I can get it to utilize the full 500GB?\n\nA: Disk utility can't grow partition boundaries upwards.  If the free space and partition were reversed, with the free space below the partition, then you could expand the partition into it.\nOne workaround is to boot with the OS X DVD, use Disk Utility to create a partition image on a USB drive, then write that image back to the free space.  Once you've verified that it works and runs, delete the bottom partition, and then expand the new top partition into the free space below.\n", "Q: How can I tell when the iPhone is actively using GPS versus only using region monitoring? I run Google Latitude on an iPhone 4 with background updates turned on.  How can I distinguish between when it's actively grabbing the location vs when it's using region monitoring to wait for the phone to move?  As far as I can tell, both icons look the same in the status bar.\n\nA: In Settings --> Location Services each application that uses location services is listed.  In that list any apps that are currently using locations services or have used location services in the last 24 hours includes a little arrow icon.\nThe icons differ based on whether they are currently or recently used location services, and if currently then whether it's a geofence or regular updates.\nThe icons and description for each icon are included in that settings panel.\n\n\n", "Q: How to fix Disk Utility, About This Mac, and Finder that disagree on hard drive space usage? Has anyone seen this issue and know how to fix it?\nLook at the free space reported by running \"Get Info\" on my hard drive (Macintosh HD) in the Finder, \"About This Mac\" from the Apple Menu, and Disk Utility.\nRunning on an early 2011 MacBook Pro OS X 10.7.3.\n\nDisk Utility shows: \n\n\n*\n\n*108.31 GB (108,311,060,480 Bytes) available\n\n*390.94 GB (390,937,042,944 Bytes) used.\n\n\nFinder shows: \n\n\n*\n\n*206.43 GB available\n\n*292,816,503,508 bytes used (292.82 GB on disk).\n\n\nSystem Information shows: \n\n\n*\n\n*108.44 of 499.25 GB free.\n\n\nA: It looks like Lion changed a few things about disk space management, and you're not the only person with this issue and likely related issues.  Some are reporting that doing a shutdown and restart resolves the discrepancy.  Others indicate their disk space discrepancy had to do with Time Machine's local backup feature on laptops.\nDo a full reboot and see if that resolves the problem.  If not, disable local backups, then do a full reboot.\n\nA: Most of the difference you're seeing is due to Time Machine's \"Local Snapshots\" feature.  When Time Machine is turned on but the backup device isn't available, it backs up to the local volume.  The space used for these local snapshots is counted as \"in use\" by Disk Utility and System Information, but not the Finder (see the Disk Space considerations section of this article).  While the space for backup actually is in use, it'll be freed automatically when needed (i.e. when the volume gets above 80% full), so the Finder counts it as being available.\nIn your particular case, the space System Information lists as being used for \"Backups\", 98.36GB, is very close to the difference in free space listed by the Finder vs. the other two.  The Finder's 206.43GB free - 98.36GB of backups = 108.07GB actually free; compare to System Info's listing of 108.44GB free and Disk Util's 108.31GB.  I'm not sure what the rest of the difference is (maybe they looked at the disk at slightly different times?  Or they may be counting volume structures a bit differently?), but it's very small.\n\nFinder shows: \n\n\n*\n\n*easily, the truth for JHFS+ volume Macintosh HD\n\n*optionally, the truth for mtmfs volume MobileBackups\nHint: with local snapshots enabled in Time Machine, in Finder you can go to /Volumes/MobileBackups then get info. \nResults of a one-line command show that for some purposes, MobileBackups is treated as a distant file system: \nqlmanage -m disks | grep MobileBackups && mount | grep MobileBackups\n\nAs Disk Utility is oriented to local file systems, we'll probably never see MobileBackups as a separate volume in that context. There are degrees of simplification in Disk Utility, even when debug options are chosen. \n", "Q: Delete (Group) Meeting From Calendar I received an ical invite through gmail, which my IPad3 added to the calendar.  But now I'm trying to delete the event, and there is no option to do so.  \nI found a thread of discussion which says the event can't be deleted if other attendees are included in the ical info.  The only solution I've seen, also from the same thread of discussion, is to make edits on your PC and then use ITunes to synchronize the calendar.\nI'm dealing with employer equipment, where installing ITunes is not an option.  In fact, attaching my IPad to the PC is also not an option.  I need to find a way to delete the meeting request from the calendar without using a PC as a life support system.\nActually my REAL problem is that the original meeting invite started at 9:30am.  Then the organizer changed the time to 9:00am.  But because the IPad can't seem to modify or delete a meeting (with other attendees) once it is created, the ical updates to my IPad are being ignored.\nHow do I fix this?\nNow, pardon me, it is time for a rant.\nThis is such a ridiculous problem.  This is the year 2012, yes?  Apple is the cutting edge of tech, yes?  And neither I nor others can delete or modify a calendar event that has other attendees in it?!?!?!  My frustration is multiplied because, on an unrelated note, I'm also dealing with the common problem of apple equipment creating duplicates of music downloaded from ITunes.  The recommended solution for this latter problem, is ALSO to rely on a PC and ITunes for life-support.  Really?!\n\nA: In Settings -> Accounts -> iCloud, you can turn Calendar on, and then off. It will ask if you would like to delete all synced events. I said \"yes\" and they disappeared from my calendar!  In other words all of the group events with no delete option were deleted. \nNOTE: this deleted all group events.\n\nA: You can delete these events but you have to do it in iCal on a Mac. After fixing the problem in iCal it will now be removed from the iPad if you are using iCloud to manage your calendar. If you are using iCloud you might check on deleting the event from iCloud.com.\nUnfortunately, as you've discovered, there are limitations to deleting an invited event in iOS.\n", "Q: Custom Themes for Mac OS X Lion For older Mac OS Versions like 10.4 or sometimes 10.5 you can find lots of themes, which change the whole UI.\nNow my problem is that I'm using Mac OS Lion (10.7.3) and I want to change the UI, because I don't like the current one very much. I looked around in the web, but I couldn't find anything.\nSo is it really like that, that there isn't any other, alternative UI for Mac OS Lion?\n\nA: I found Crystal Black, which seems to be the only theme for OS X Lion that's available.\n\nIt is not free, and costs $8.\n", "Q: Has the retina screen effectively made dead pixels moot? Now the new iPad has a retina screen, does that mean we can't see dead pixels anymore?\n\nA: You will still be able to see the defect.\nWhat retina means is that once two items with similar contrast get close enough together, you can't tell them apart - it appears to be one item.\nAlong a line, for instance, you can't tell where each pixel that makes the line is, but you can clearly see the edge created by the line on the contrasting background.\nA dead pixel creates a contrast you'll be able to see.  If you have two dead pixels next to each other, you might think you only have one.  But you will be able to see them if the pixels surrounding them contrast.\n\nA: No, you can still see dead pixels perfectly well - if you go close enough.\nActually, I received two new iPads - both with a few dead pixels (always black).\nIt was in both cases a patch of dead pixels, for one device I estimate around 4-6 and for the other 2-3; the patches were in different locations.\nAs the pixels are now so small, dead pixels are far less disturbing - nevertheless, I sent back both iPads because of that.\n\nA: You can still see dead pixels on the new iPad screen, but they are less obvious than on previous models.\n", "Q: What is Apple's policy for supporting security updates on older versions of OS X? Does Apple have a policy regarding how long they will continue to release and support security fixes for each OS X release?  I've looked around the Internet, and found some forum posts that claim \"only for the current, and most recent previous, versions\" but none appear to have an official reference.  Further confounding the issue are some relatively recent posts claiming they still receive security updates for versions as old as 10.2.\nMy concern here is primarily from a security standpoint. The National Institute of Standards and Technology of the Department of Commerce of the United States of America states in this document: NIST SP 800-53, control SI-02 (Flaw Remediation) that there are requirements that (among other things) \"The organization ... identifies, reports, and corrects information system flaws\". For systems running OS's that are beyond their support lifecycle, we cannot be reliably expected to correct discovered vulnerabilities because the vendor will no longer supply patches.  So, knowing a product's expected support lifecycle (and, especially, if it has already expired) is critical to continuing to maintain compliance with this control.\nDoes Apple provide this information anywhere online for the general public?  What versions are currently supported (current version being Lion), and how long (presuming no change to the policy) will they continue to be supported?\n\nA: I'm sure Apple has a policy, but it's clearly not released to the public and probably gets re-evaluated constantly based on many factors.\nWhenever I need to know what's supported now, I go to the index of what Apple Care covers (since AppleCare is the support wing that maintains knowledge base articles, answers questions, etc...)\n\n\n*\n\n*The Apple Support Sitemap - This answers your question about the definitive list of actively supported OS. As of May 2012, this includes three major versions. 10.5, 10.6, 10.7 As of September 2012 (after Mountain Lion has been out for more than a month), the support for 10.5 isn't yet removed from the Support Sitemap so we are in a window where four major versions of the OS are still supported.\n\n\nYou can of course see the latest updates for all OSX OS at their respective support pages, even past the time when they are \"actively in support\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Lion Support\n\n*Snow Leopard Support\n\n*Leopard Support\n\n*Tiger Support\n\n*Panther Support\n\n*Jaguar and Earlier Support which presumably covers Puma and Cheetah but not Kodiak.\n\n\nI don't think Apple publishes a hard and fast policy. My experience is that the current and past two versions have always been supported. There are times when more than three versions are supported, so you may get to see this when 10.8 gets released. It also might be more tied to hardware that was sold. Apple generally bases support on US sales dates with a 5 year window for hardware support after a model is discontinued for sale. I would also expect that large institutional orders (education, government) will tend to keep older hardware and software in support due to contractual agreements or the local law.(Examples for that are anything sold in California or Turkey, government contracts in Virginia and still different regulations in France.) \nIf you have a business relationship with Apple due to being certified as a technician or have help desk level support in place, then you will get pre-announcements of which products and software are announced to go into non-support before the time arrives.\nBasically, if you need to know this sort of non-public information ahead of time, you can become certified (cheaper, takes more time and knowledge) or pay for this level of support and have access to information that looks forward so you can plan for change and know you are supported by Apple. As you can see, there are several factors that seem to play into the length a support window stays open and there are several free options to help you guess the timing if you don't need to pay for this information.\n\nA: Remember that Apple views itself as a hardware company.  They don't sell operating systems, they sell Macs. They don't worry about security updates for any specific OS; rather, they focus on security updates for all currently-supported Macs.\nFirst, let's define currently-supported. Apple supports all Macs that aren't yet vintage or obsolete. In practical terms, that covers every current Mac (of course), as well as all Macs discontinued less than seven years ago.\nConsider the iMac models released in October of 2009. They were discontinued in July of 2010, so (by Apple's definition) they aren't yet obsolete. They shipped with Mac OS X 10.6.1 Snow Leopard.  And while it's true that Apple no longer offers updates for Snow Leopard, it's also true that those late 2009 iMacs can be upgraded to Sierra.\nSo (from Apple's perspective), those they do offer current security updates. If you have a late 2009 iMac, update to macOS 10.12 Sierra, and you'll be secure.\nAll this is inference on my part; I don't think Apple has ever stated an official policy regarding security updates.  But my inferences are (so far as I can tell) consistent with the facts.\n\nA: I haven't seen any official Apple policy for OS X, but there is a KB entry for hardware: Vintage and obsolete products (most of these are PPC, but Intel ones are starting to appear). As for what actually happens -- as you've already found it is the current and previous versions only. You could check that by going to Mac OS and Software downloads section of the Apple Support site (alternatively Downloads, then choosing Mac OS and Software and then Mac OS), choosing Leopard (or searching for an older version) and comparing the date of last Security update with the release of the the that version +0.2 (Lion in that example). Of course, due to the lack of stated policy, there isn't any guarantee that this would continue.\n\nA: support lasts approximately 40 months.\nOSX 10.9 is no longer receiving security updates:\nsupport.apple.com/en-us/HT201222\n\nhttp://www.computerworld.com/article/2950580/operating-systems/the-end-is-near-for-os-x-mountain-lion-support.html \n\nA: Just yesterday I saw this:  \"Apple Protects OS X 10.5 Leopard From Flashback Malware\" \nThey have not (yet) done Tiger, I guess.\nIt seems the stackexchange software does not consider eweek to be a \"reliable source\", so I add this Apple Link\n", "Q: Does a MacBook Pro need a power adapter to work in the Bahamas? A classmate asked me if the US MacBook Pro adapters are usable in the Bahamas. It boils down to the type of electricity and outlets there, but being that I have no clue, I'm asking here.\nDoes a USA compatible MacBook Pro adapter require an adapter for the Bahamas?\n\nA: According to these guys, anything that works in the US should work in the Bahamas.\n\nVoltage: 110-120 Volts (Same as U.S./Canada, most other areas are\n  220-240 Volts)\nPrimary Socket Types: North American Non-Grounded , North American\n  Grounded\n\n\nA: No you do not need a power adapter. All you might need is round pin socket plug or a universal plug because US uses flat pins and many countries have a round pin.\nI have used my MacBook in places like Mexico, India, and China without any power adapter where the AC voltage was 220V.\n", "Q: Can I switch away from full-screen DVD Player on a second monitor without having it exit full screen mode? I am a part-time projectionist, and we use DVD Player to show the movies on the projector. Sometimes, though, I need to do something while the movie is playing. Unfortunately, if I try to switch applications, DVD Player exits full screen mode. Is there any way to retain full screen mode?\nThe computer in question is a Snow Leopard-running iMac connected via VGA to a generic projector.\n\nA: With my MacBook Pro, I can use multitouch gestures like swipe to the Desktop or to another screen using four fingers with my trackpad, and it does keep the movie in fullscreen, but this does depend on which DVD player you are using.\nIn my case, I use VLC Media Player.\n", "Q: Network Windows 7 and Mac This is my first Mac computer (a MacBook Pro) and loving it! What I'm not loving though is the inconsistency of networking files between my main system and the Mac.\nSo long story short, I've Googled around and the fastest solution I found was on Windows 7, typing in \"RUN\" then \"\\ip address\", then the login appears, log in and I'm in my Mac's files. The problem with this is that it's VERY inconsistent. More often than not, it won't let me connect to the Mac. I know it's not my main PC because other machines throughout the house connect just fine to each other while at the very same time I'm held back on the Mac.\nMy question is: is there a better way, a more consistent way to network between Windows 7 and Mac that doesn't involve me running back and forth with a thumb drive?\n\nA: I am assuming that you just want to copy paste files/folders from your main (Windows) machine to the Mac or vice versa.\nYou can do this other way around (using Mac) pretty easily. In your Mac go to the Finder and in the Go menu in the menu bar you see \"Connect to Server…\". Use this option and enter the IP address of your Windows machine. Then login with your Windows ID and password.\nNow unless you unmount this connection you will see your Windows machine as an external drive in your left side of your Finder windows and you will always be connected. If you want to close the connection, you can simply click on the eject button on the Windows drive which should be on your left pane in the Finder window (which shows Macintosh hard drive, Applications etc.). Note that this requires your Windows machine to have file sharing on. \nYou could also install an ssh/scp program on Windows (such as that included in Cygwin) and use that to transfer files (turn on Remote Login in the Mac's Sharing preference pane).\n", "Q: How to find a good replacement iPhone e-reader app? Now that Amazon has sunk the usability flagship among e-readers, Stanza, I am looking for a replacement.  I am not asking for an app recommendation, but I am asking how to find a good replacement?\nIt seems every app praises itself beyond reason. Every forum peddles whatever app has their fancy. How can I find a good e-reader app without installing and testing them all? Many aren't free and it would be silly to pay for many of them, only to find them all lacking. \nGiven that there's no recommendation stack exchange (however useful that might be?), how can I provide my requirements and get a sorted list of choices?\n\nA: This is the problem Apple is grappling with right now.  I'm hoping that they'll have some answer for us this year that helps us deal with the number of competing apps in the app store.\nIn the meantime, I have a few strategies for finding an app that meets my needs:\nUse the app store search.\nIf you need your ebook reader to support epub, bookmarks, notes, and dropbox, simply type, \"epub bookmarks notes dropbox\" in the search field of the app store.  I like to sort first by rating and check out the highest rated apps, then by popularity and check out the most downloaded apps. Note that sorting by rating and popularity are only available on the iPad.\nI read the reviews, both at the high rate end and low rate end to get an idea of the types of features people are excited about, and the types of problems people are experiencing.\nI look at the most recent update notes, and see how long ago it was last updated to get an idea of whether the developer is taking an active role in maintaining the app and is responsive to complaints, or if it's an old app that works, but probably doesn't have new features.\nAt that point the only thing to do is to try out the ones that look most promising.  Many apps offer a trial or ad supported version, so the trial can be free in many cases.  For others, you'll have to pay a little to try them out, and if they don't fit your needs you've lost a little money and time, but remember that you're picking an app that should fit your needs for a long time - when you find it it will be worth the effort and money you've spent on other apps looking for the perfect one.\nUse internet reviews/forums\nDo a google search for \"best ebook reader ipad\" or similar, and you'll often get dozens of \"top ten\" style lists from people who have spent some time not just reviewing a few apps, but comparing and contrasting them.  You have to do a bit of wading, and you are going to have a hard time finding less popular subjects, \"best lawn care app\" isn't going to give you such collections because few people will have taken the time to check them out, even though many exist onthe app store.\nAsk in appropriate forums\nThis site, Ask Different, does permit apple and iOS specific product recommendations, for instance, and there are many other forums that are fine with such questions.\nYou can check out the tag software-recommendation to get examples of the style of questions allowed here.  The tag has this note which might also give you tips on asking for a recommendation:\n\nRecommendations can easily be subjective and local to one person or time. Please be specific about function and broad about timeframe so that your question, once answered objectively, is of use to the community.\n\n\nA: I realize your question is specific to e-readers, but my answer is much more general.  You have been warned.\nMy method for general information gathering is to use my Google Reader to subscribe to just about every interesting source of information I come across on the web.  In-between projects at work, or when I just want a break, I hit up Feedly and see what's on.  At this point I have just about 700 blogs subscribed.  Not all are active, but the ones that are present plenty of information.  Because of the way Feedly and Google Reader are set up, it's easy to ignore items simply by reading the headline.  The j key is your friend!\n", "Q: Is it possible to use a third-party remote with an Apple TV? I was thinking about this earlier and thought I'd ask. Can third-party remotes be used with the Apple TV (any and all versions)?\n\nA: Yep. You can have your Apple TV learn the remote codes of any IR remote by going to Settings > General > Remotes. It will then ask you to hit buttons on your new remote corresponding to what it shows on screen.\nFull instructions can be found at Apple's site: Controlling Apple TV with a third-party remote control\n\nA: I have a Logitech Harmony remote that I use with the ATV and my other equipment like receiver, tv and HDTV-box. Works fine.\n", "Q: What's causing iTunes to randomly display a 4002 error? Once every day or two, iTunes seemingly randomly displays a 4002 error:\n\nThis is particularly puzzling to me, as the majority of the time (if not always) iTunes is in the background, and has been for a while. What exactly does the error signify, and how can I fix it?\n\nA: I got rid of this pesky error by\n\n\n*\n\n*turning iTunes Match off\n\n*quit iTunes\n\n*launch iTunes\n\n*turn iTunes Match on\n\n\nThe first time iTunes complained with error 5002 during Match startup, but then it worked.\n\nA: Google seems to think it's an iTunes Genius error.  Try turning off Genius from Store -> Turn off Genius.\nIf that doesn't resolve your issue, if Genius is not on, or if it's too important to turn off, post more info about your system and we'll try to help.\n\nA: I have been importing quite a few songs into iTunes v 10.7 (21) on OS X 10.8.2 and this error is popping up when the upload process has a hiccup. Even if you are not currently in a state when you would expect uploading to the iTunes Match cloud, the software can run a sync and throw this error.\nThere's nothing you can normally do on your end other than disconnect from the internet and wait for the servers to clear up. In my case, no action was needed to resume uploads. The iTunes process was patient and resumed once a short timeout passed.\n", "Q: Why does Finder tell me Pixie is zero bytes in size, but takes up 406 KB? Pixie, the additional Xcode app for magnifying pixels of the screen and finding their values, takes up 406 KB of space. Finder, however, says that it's zero bytes in size. In the below screenshot, you see that under Size it says \"zero bytes\", followed by \"406 KB on disk\". What does this discrepancy mean?\n\nI have relaunched Finder, but the problem persists. Pixie is fully functional.\n\nA: I think that this could be the resource fork taking up the space.\nSee here for more details.\n", "Q: Double tap to drag no longer works I used to have the double-tap-to-drag working, where I would tap the trackpad, let go, then tap-and-hold and it would begin dragging.\nI temporarily disabled the Tap to click setting in System Preferences, and now after I reenabled it, I no longer have double-tap-to-drag. Tap to click does work, it's just the dragging that no longer works. I don't see any setting to enable double-tap-to-drag. Is it automatically supposed to work when Tap to click is enabled?\nI've tried it with Three finger drag both enabled and disabled, but nothing works.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Accessibility > Mouse & Trackpad > Trackpad Options… and check “Enable dragging”.\n\n", "Q: Are Apple keyboards multi-key rollover? For people who type with many fingers, are Macintosh keyboards are multi-key rollover?\nBonus points for explaining how to test this on any Mac or listing which models are 3 key rollover or higher.\n\nA: My Apple Wireless Keyboard and the keyboard on my MacBook Air seem to allow pressing all combinations of two keys at the same time, but not some combinations of three keys. So I guess they are 2-key rollover.\nAnother way to test it is to open the keyboard viewer from the input menu or with open -a KeyboardViewer.\n\nA: Apple Macbook Pro's are 6 Key Rollover, looks like limitation of USB\nHold keys 1 2 3 4 5 6 and then 7, 7 does not register\n\nA: I just wanted to add on some information as to why certain combinations of keys don't register on Apple keyboards. I don't remember in which technical paper I read it in, it would have been at least 10 years ago now, but when Apple unveiled their keyboard (I think the one in 2003?) they said it contained certain protections in case a pet walked over it.\nThis is what's happening. There is a special rule built-in that ignores input in the name of pet-detection. If you press at least two keys in the same column, additional keypresses in the whole row of those keys are ignored. And if you press keys that would activate this blocking mechanism while you have keys already pressed, they are ignored too. This means you can press \"1QAZ\" and not be able to input anything else while holding those keys down.\nIn conclusion Apple keyboards have a 4-key rollover on columns (not counting spacebar and function keys), and 6-key on rows,\nif a row is not locked by another key, which technically makes it 2-key rollover. Thank the Apple engineers. Oh and since the keyboards use a PS/2 interface this limitation is completely arbitrary and the modifier keys do not affect this keyboard locking at all, so you can press 10 keys at once just fine (shift, ctrl, alt, cmd, and any six keys on the same row).\nHope this helps someone in the future.\n\nA: Current Apple keyboards (this answer is from 2012, but I've re-tested in 2020) are not N-Key rollover and as far as I know no recent keyboard they have ever made is. I think some of the really old ones were N-key rollover, but can't confirm it.\nYou can use this website to test your keyboard.\nBeware that every keyboard has a different electronic layout and will fail in different key combinations. On my Apple Aluminium keyboard if I hold down the W and E keys, then press the D key, the third key press does not register. But there are other key combinations where as many as six keys will register at once.\nIt is commonly said that true N-Key rollover can only be achieved using a PS/2 keyboard, and that USB keyboards can only achieve 6-key rollover. As far as I know, this limitation only applies to Microsoft Windows.\nMy mechanical keyboard's spec sheet claims \"6-key rollover with USB, N-key rollover with USB to PS/2 adapter\". When using it with USB on my Mac, I've confirmed that is in fact 20-key rollover.\n\nA: As someone who has built a Hackintosh (a computer that is made of standard, off the shelf PC components, but runs Mac OS), I can confirm that Apple's laptops use a PS2 interface. Among the many .kext files that the custom boot loader can install are PS2 drivers. These allow the use of PS2 keyboards and mice with Mac OS, but are derived from .kexts that are used by Apple's laptops.\n\nA: I was surprised to see that the keyboard on the Macbook Pro can pass my quick keyboard test. However, Apple's external USB keyboards miss keypresses doing my simple test below.\nI typed out \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\" while holding down both SHIFT keys. Perhaps the internal keyboard has a fancy hook up that isn't USB.\n\nA: Sometimes it is not enough to simply ask yes-or-no about a complex feature like NKRO. Often the answer is, \"It depends...\" Several above commenters suggested holding down w, then e, then d, to see if the d key registers. On the built-in keyboard of my MacBookPro 2015, that \"fails.\" But what succeeds is a more common 3-key sequence: shift + D + E (arguably a more commonly-typed sequence, e.g. in the word DEBUG :) ) BUT, my \"cheapo\" (MacAlly) external USB keyboard fails to register the E if I already have shift + D held down. My \"expensive/gaming\" (CoolerMaster) can register all characters in \"DEBUG\" held down simultaneously.\n", "Q: How can I recover files in an app bundle that were lost after an OS update? I saved a file in an app's application content (right clicked the application file, and then clicked Show Package Contents) for security issues. However, during the upgrade to OS X Lion, I completely forgot it was there and subsequently the app was updated and the file is gone! It was the application Stickies, in case that's helpful. Does anyone know if there's any way I can recover it?\nEDIT: No longer looking for a solution, files have been found using diskdrill.\n\nA: I managed to recover my file by downloading the free version of Disk Drill.  I used the deep search options locate removed files on my Mac; you can view results by type of file, however names as far as I can see are not conserved, so you will have to preview each file one by one.  To actually recover the file you must upgrade to the Pro version of the software.\n", "Q: Visibility Issues with Mail and iCal in OS X Lion I recently installed Lion (Mac OS X 10.7.3) on my early 2008 MacBook. I know many of the color changing options in Mail and iCal have been taken away (probably due to app syncing or Cocoa issues). I can live with this as long as the result is legible.  \nIn Mail, the list of Mailboxes is listed in a light blue color, with black letters which turn a transparent white or silver when selected - difficult to read. My work-around has been to list my more frequently used Mailboxes in the toolbar, but I have too many Mailboxes to put them all up there. Any suggestions?\nIn iCal, I can live with all of the ugly artificial leather stuff, but my main issue is the definition between dates and days in each view (Day, Week, or Month) is so light it is almost invisible. Only when an entry is made is the data legible but the times and dates above and below are not. Again, any suggestions? Do I need to upgrade my laptop to get a higher resolution?\n\nA: It seems like the contrast on your display is too low for you. If you can adjust the contrast on your monitor, try increasing it. If you cannot change the contrast (such as the internal laptop displays), fuss around in the color calibration utility (go to System Preferences > Displays > choose the window on the monitor you want to change > Color tab > Calibrate… and follow the instructions). Make sure Mail and iCal are visible behind the calibration window so you can see if your changes are sufficient. I'd suggest using Expert Mode and paying especial attention to the vertical sliders on the left.\nTo answer your final question regarding resolution, upgrading to a higher-res machine would not help. Apple's machines are usually fairly standardly calibrated from the factory, so a higher resolution would simply make the pixels smaller, not easier to distinguish, and might even make things worse.\n", "Q: Moving files in Finder with drag and drop opens a new window I'm trying to move files around in Finder by using my trackpad to drag and drop files. The problem is that I'm using tap to click with dragging enabled. So, when I decide to drop the files onto a folder, there is a brief delay between when I release the trackpad and when the files actually get dropped. (This delay is in place in case the user wants to temporarily lift their finger and tap-and-hold again to move the dragged items again.) During this brief delay, what often happens is that the folder I am hovering over is automatically opened up into a new window, and the file is not necessarily dropped where I originally wanted it to be dropped.\nThis automatic window opening can easily be seen by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Finder\n\n*Drag a file onto a folder and don't let go until a new window pops up.\n\n\nI never need to use this auto window popup feature, so the simplest solution seems to be disabling this feature. Is there any way to do that? If not, do you have any recommendations as to the best way to resolve this issue?\n\nA: You can disable this in Finder's preferences by unchecking \"Spring-loaded folders and windows\":\n\n\nA: In Sierra, the \"Spring-load\" option is no longer in this location. It is found in System Preferences -> Accessibility -> Mouse & Trackpad . Uncheck it. Otherwise, folders open and you have to manually close them. \n\n", "Q: Restored from Time Machine, no boot I restored from a Time Machine backup onto a new HDD, this was using a disc with OS X Lion\nUpon boot, in verbose mode, the text hangs after initpool: offset = 0x08000000 size = 0x0800000.\nI would be inclined to point to it being a RAM problem, but when another drive is hooked up, it goes on to list the partitions and then hangs. So it's most likely whatever sequence that happens right after the initpool function which is hanging\nWhy can't I get it to boot up? Also, I see something about the program Little Snitch starting, in case a third party program might be known to cause trouble.\n\nA: A restore of Time Machine back to the drive will not restore it to a bootable state. You must install the OS onto the drive from the install download (Lion) or install disk (pre-Lion).\nTo do what you expected you need to make a clone of your boot drive. Use a tool like Carbon Copy Cloner. It makes an exact copy of your drive. If that drive happens to be your boot drive, then the clone is bootable.\nTime Machine is great for recovering lost or earlier versions of your documents/data; Carbon Copy Cloner is great for keeping a current snapshot of your entire hard drive that is bootable. Use Both; I do. \n", "Q: Tips on avoiding \"Could not activate cellular data network\" with New iPad So I bought a new iPad, 64GB + 4G. And since then it seems like every time I pick it up and go to use a network feature (Hero Academy, Tweetbot, Safari etc.) I get this message \"Could not activate cellular data network\".\nIf I reset it then everything will work OK until after I put it away for a while. There's no definite time period for the network failing but it always seems to happen after I have been home or at work (inside a WiFi coverage area) and then I go to use 3G again. The fact that it does work fine after a reset says to me that this is not a signal strength issue, this happens repeatedly at the train station and will always work right after reset. Before reset the network indicator shows full bars and 3G indicator.\nHas anyone else experienced this and improved this by changing anything in Settings, by talking to their carrier or anything else? I am thinking this has to be an iOS bug. I should not have to do a white apple reset to use network services!\nIf it matters I am using a prepaid Optus 3G sim in Melbourne, Australia.

Please don't let this devolve into a \"use the command-line or GTFO\" flamewar. Yes, I know about scp and friends.\nI have a VPS running Ubuntu and I'd like to mount one of its filesystems on my Mac so I can use all my local tools and copy files via finder, etc.\nI'm using Fuse/MacFusion now, and it's particularly slow.\nAny better way?\n\nA: First, set up a VPN connection between the VPS and your Mac. Something like OpenVPN is fine (the TunnelBlick Mac client works well, at least up through Snow Leopard).\nSecond, set up the VPS as an AFP server using the \"netatalk\" package.  Something like sudo apt-get install netatalk.  AFP is the native Mac network filesystem.  Configure it to your situation.\nAt this point, you can establish the VPN connection between the VPS and the Mac, and then find and mount the AFP volumes from the VPS in your Finder.\nAn alternative would be to use something like MacFUSE and SSHFS, but using AFP is more \"native\" and will show up better in Finder.\n\nA: You could setup WebDAV on the VPS (there are various tutorials depending on the Ubuntu version available on the internet), and then use Finder, which has native support for it to access it. Just make sure that you use WebDAV over SSL. \n\nA: Expandrive or Transmit or Interarchy. \nThose are the easiest and most Mac friendly ways. \n", "Q: Why I can't get out of EFI firmware update 2.7 on my MacBook Pro?

Each iPad is shared by several students in different classes throughout the day. A clever student in one class decided to lock one of them. We have already unlocked it by restoring it, etc., but I'd like to prevent this from happening in the future. I was noodling around with the new Apple Configurator this morning to force no passcode, but I couldn't find such a setting. The best I could come up with is to set my own passcode, device lock to never, and grace period the longest available (4 hours). That would mean, though, unlocking every single iPad for the students with my secret code at least once a day. Ugh.\nDoes anyone know of a way, official or unofficial, to prevent a user from setting a passcode on an iOS device?\n\nA: The apple configurator doesn't currently have this option.  \nThe only workaround I've discovered so far is to register an exchange account with the iOS device using SSL.  This forces the user to use a passcode, and disables the option to remove it.  Now go into your exchange account settings on the iOS device, deselect \"Use SSL\" then go and disable the passlock.  Now go back to exchange settings and re-enable \"Use SSL\".  You should now find that 1) the passlock is no longer enabled and 2) the setting to turn on the passlock is gone.  You should be able to disable all the sync settings so students don't start using that account for anything. (source)\nIf you don't have an exchange account you can use for this, set up a free google mail, and register it as the exchange account.\nIt may depend on the exchange server settings/policy, though, so some experimentation may be required.\nLastly, if you are using Supervised devices then the passcode will be reset when reconnected to the apple configurator.  Still more work than desired, but quicker and more painless than a full refresh.\n\nA: Try adjusting the Passcode settings in the Apple Configurator Profile: Set the requirements to be as complex and inconvenient for the user as possible. It will be harder for the user to set a Passcode and, if the device does get locked, the student/teacher will have to contact the IT department for a reset (which will be necessary anyway if an iPad is locked and no one knows the Passcode).\n\nA: FYI, with OS X Server/Profile Manager and iOS 9.3, you CAN disable the passcode.\nFirst, you need the iPad to be in Supervised mode. You can do this either by having the device in Apple's DEP, or by using Apple Configurator 2 to 'Prepare' the device and put it in Supervised mode.\nUse your OS X Server Profile Manager as the MDM for the iPad.\nOnce enrolled, you can setup a Restriction on the iPad to disallow the user to change the passcode settings.\nI've tested this on OS X 10.11.5, OS X Server 5.1.5 on an iPad with iOS 9.3.2\n", "Q: Stanza replacement recommendation?

One idea is to put all my music (~100GB) on a big thumb drive (y, and back it up). I pretty much always have my keychain so this is only a slight inconvencience. I would symlink that directory to a folder on the thumb drive. Has anyone done this? I know some people won't like the idea due to thumb drive irreliability but I have had good luck.\nthx\n\nA: You can actually change the location that iTunes stores its library under Preferences -> Advanced -> iTunes Media folder Location. \nIn that case, you could migrate your iTunes library to that external drive. You would just need to make sure you have the drive connected when wanting to use iTunes.\nYou may want to be careful with carrying this much on a thumb drive (if they even make them that large).

I currently have an AppleScript app that opens Terminal windows and completes commands. I would like an app icon badge to appear on the Terminal icon in the Dock when a command completes. I need this because I often have to restart the commands when they stop. Is this possible? Essentially my AppleScript application takes a user-provided variable and plugs it into a Terminal command. Every time I use the application it opens a new Terminal window (intended). I would like to have a badge appear when a Terminal command completes.\n\nA: If you're willing to accept an answer to the more general question \"is there a way to have me alerted when something completes in a Terminal window\" then the answer is: yes.\nIf you're running Growl you can make a command line call from a script that will post a notification to Growl. For example:\ndo shell script \"sleep 1h\"\ndo shell script \"growlnotify --sticky --message \\\"I'm all done sleeping for an hour! Did you forget about me?\\\" --wait\"\n\nThe script won't exit until you clear the notification from the screen.\nYou could even use the --name option to give your script a unique name, and then from within Growl customize how events generated by that named application are displayed and dealt with. They can produce different types of pop ups on the screen, they can email you, they can send a message to you via iChat, they forward the event to Growl on another machine, if you're running Prowl on your iDevice they can even forward the notification on to your iDevice via push notifications.\nNot quite the answer you were looking for, but hopefully it meets your needs.\n\n\n\nA: As of Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, Terminal has exactly this feature.\nIf you emit a bell (BEL, Control-G) in a background tab or window, the Terminal application Dock icon will show a badge with the number of “unread” bells\n\nand a bell icon is displayed in the tab of the terminal\n\n(If there is only one tab in the window, choose View > Show Tab Bar to see the tab, which also displays other status information.)\nThis also applies to minimized windows.\nWhen you bring the window to the front or select the background tab, the bell indicator is removed from the tab and the badge count goes down.\n", "Q: What is the lightning bolt icon in iCal?

My 2011 MacBook Pro has been having a problem occasionally where I put it to sleep, but it continues to run.  Later when I go use it again, I realize that it was on the whole time (usually inside my bag), and by this point it is blazing hot and the fan is running at full power.  It is unresponsive at this point, and I have to hold the power button to restart it. This happens I'd guess every few weeks on average, sometimes more often, sometimes less.  \nI often bounce between an office and home where at both locations, I use an external monitor, keyboard and mouse.  This freezing seems to happen only when I'm leaving one of these two locations, in which case I follow the following procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move mouse to HotCorner to put monitor to sleep (I do this instead of closing the lid since Lion has lid closing assume the external is taking over as primary display.)\n\n*Close lid to put computer to sleep\n\n*Disconnect cables (power, display port, usb; maybe ethernet and audio depending on location).\n\n\nLately, I've been suspecting that the above actions somehow conflict, so I've been trying to wait a few seconds between each step.  I think this was helping, but today I forgot about this plan (i.e. less than 1/2 second between actions), and the crash returned.  \nI first contacted Apple in February, and they had me boot into safe-mode to reset something, then reset the PRAM.  This didn't help, as the freezes returned.  After today's crash, I called Apple again, and they recommended I try reinstalling Lion (running 10.7.3), and if that doesn't help, then go to Apple store for hardware tests.  \nI will give this a try, but before I do, I wanted to see if anyone has a better idea on how to prevent this from happening.\nFor now, I've also removed my HotCorner, and will simply use the menu or keyboard to trigger system sleep before closing my lid (i.e. to make sure that the monitor-sleep and system-sleep commands are not conflicting).  \nUpdate: I reworded some of above to try to entice solutions.  Additionally, I should note that at my office, the USB is used for keyboard and mouse vs. at home, USB Is used for keyboard, mouse and external drive.  The display port in both cases is connected to a DVI adapter.\n\nA: I would try adjusting your procedure. Since as noted the quoted steps provided below in practice are causing you to unintentionally wake the Mac from sleep in step 3, which may also problematically be waking it from sleep before it finishes going to sleep in the first place. So in a sense you were telling your MacBook Air to go to sleep and while your at it wake up from sleep, remove a display and all this other stuff at the same time. That may be the cause of the freezing, the shock of all the external devices getting removed while in sleep or while the mac is going to sleep.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Move mouse to HotCorner to put monitor to sleep (I do this instead of closing the lid since Lion has lid closing assume the external is\n  taking over as primary display)\n  \n*Close lid to put computer to sleep\n  \n*Disconnect cables (power, display port, usb; maybe ethernet and audio depending on location).\n  \n\nUSB activity as noted in Mac OS X: Why your Mac might not sleep or stay in sleep mode is a perfect way to wake your mac from sleep.\nI would recommend doing the following instead:\n\n\n*\n\n*Save your important files and data in open applications in case things go wrong.\n\n*Disconnect cables (power, display port, usb; maybe ethernet and audio depending on location).\n\n*Wait for you mac to recognize that the external display is disconnected, usually screen fades to blue for a few seconds, before going back to normal view of your Mac. etc.\n\n*Close lid to put computer to sleep or choose Apple > Sleep, etc...\n\n*Verify the sleep indicator light is slowly pulsing, before placing the MacBook into any case.\nSo ya try this out and see if it stops the random freezing. If it does not then there may be other hardware / software problems at hand, check your system logs, etc.\n\nA: I've also found that OS X is prone to not properly suspend with external devices attached; in my case the usual trigger seems to be USB hard drives, but the external monitor might also trigger it.  The external drive version predates Lion; my old MacBook Pro running Snow Leopard also had it happen regularly.  I've also noticed it seems to require a certain minimum uptime to happen, which makes me think some program (Spotlight/md?) is failing to let go of the hard drive in a timely fashion and aborting the suspend.\n\nA: The problem may be due to SafeSleep, which is enabled by default on Macbooks and causes the laptop to write out the RAM to disk when put to sleep. Try turning off SafeSleep and see if that helps. My 2011 Macbook Pro started hanging occasionally when closing the lid after I upgraded to 8GB RAM, and turning off SafeSleep seems to have stopped it.\nhttp://www.markc.me.uk/blog/files/OSXSafeSleep.html\n", "Q: How to change size of ALL icons/folders in Finder?

When people walk in the room, the desk tends to shake, and so does the iMac. \nI worry that the joint between the iMac and its integrated stand might be damaged due to the vibration. Could this be a problem?\n\nA: If your wall is more stable you could always get a wall mount for it. They cost around $30-$40 on Apple's site. For the money it would be worth a try, or move the iMac somewhere sturdier in your house possibly. If the integrated mount were to somehow fail, the shag carpet might help minimize any resulting damage.\n\nA: No. That stand is, in typical Apple fashion, over-engineered. If you are tired of getting sea-sickness watching a wobbly screen, mount it to the wall using a third party wall mounting kit (VESA adapter for the Mac, a VESA mount for the wall), or secure the desk to the wall with some screws and drywall anchors.\n", "Q: Web fonts look worse after deleting MS Office I recently deleted my MS Office 2011 and decided to use only iWork or Libre Office or LaTeX.

My iPod touch was stolen. If the person type the wrong password 10 times, it will erase all my data. And, if that happens, will I receive the notification (\"find my iPod\") I requested in iCloud when it goes online?\n\nA: No (for iOS 6 and earlier) - erasing an iOS device means you will never hear from it again. No messages, no tracking, no find my device since at that point. Even if \"your device\" checks back in with Apple, it is no longer associated with your account.\nThis is covered by Apple here in this article:\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud: Erase the information on your device\n\nAfter you erase all the information on an iOS device, you won’t be\n  able to use Find My iPhone to locate it or send it a message.\n\nSomeone can enter a new (or your account) back into that device and only then will it resume checking in with the new account/password combination to be tracked.\nThe only way you might get a notification is if you first send the locate message and then the erase message and both remain queued in the proper order. Since the device was offline when you sent the two commands (otherwise you would have located the device if it were online), the device could later check in and it is conceivable you will get the locate notification delivered with enough time to respond before the erase command gets sent and acted upon.\nApple changed this in iOS 7 where activation lock and an enhanced lost mode can erase the device except for the tracking and registration. This brings the erase benefits without losing control of the device. \n\nA: Devices do not push notifications back to iCloud in the manner you suggest. It's actually the reverse, you can push a notification (including sound) and receive location information from the device, but when you restart, begin reformatting, or get the 10 failure lockout on a device, the device does not \"phone home\" before beginning it's lockdown procedures. It just locks down right off the bat.\nThe ability for you to interact with your device after being stolen is limited to the options available via the \"Find My iPhone\" iOS app on another device, or via iCloud.com.\n", "Q: MacBook connects to network over Ethernet but not WiFi I'm visiting my relatives and trying to get my MacBook on their network. If I connect over Ethernet, everything works fine and I can get online without a hitch. But if I connect over WiFi, I can't actually get on the Internet. \nIn System Preferences > Network, under AirPort, it says that it's using a \"self-assigned IP address\" and \"will not be able to connect to the Internet.\" Furthermore, under Advanced > TCP/IP, the settings don't look correct when I compare them to the other computers in the house - the format of the IP address is different, the subnet mask is different, and the IP address of the router is blank.\nI've tried copying the settings when connected over Ethernet (IP address, etc.) to use as manual settings for the WiFi, and it still doesn't work.\nOther than this MacBook, there are two Windows laptops and two iPhones in the house (one theirs, one mine), and all of those other devices can get on the Internet over wifi with no issues. I'm stumped!\n\nUPDATE: I never solved this, but the situation recently came up again – this time with a totally different computer – and I had the same exact issue: connects to the local network without a problem, but no Internet connection. So that tells me it's something wrong with the network/router, not the computer, but I still don't have any idea what it could be.\n\nA: Under System Preferences > Network, choose AirPort, click on Advanced, select the name of your wireless network and click the - button to remove it.  Turn AirPort off, wait a few, turn it back on, and try reconnecting to it.\nYou might also want to open the Terminal up and run the command:\ndscacheutil -flushcache\n\nFailing that, create a brand-new user account on the MacBook, log into that account, and see if it can connect.\n\nA: Go to Preferences → Network → Wi-Fi → Advanced → DNS and remove any previous DNS servers that were listed. Apple then automatically sets default ones or uses the ones provided by your network.\nI think the flush dscacheutil does not flush any old DNS name servers and inhibits Internet access.\n\nA: Maybe there is more than one WiFi access point, and the one you are connecting to is a dead end. For example, maybe your relatives put in a \"range extender\" and you're connecting to the extender... but the extender is not connecting back to the main router. In that case, I would skip the extender by bringing my Mac closer to the main router, turning WiFi off, and then on again in hopes of joining the network using the main router. (Or unplug the extender and then join the network.)\nIf you hold the Option key down while clicking the WiFi menu you will see a lot of extra information, including the BSSID. That number is the ID of the base station you are connected to. You can find the number of a base station on the bottom if it's an Apple Airport. So, if there are two Airports, for example, and one of them is supposed to get its connection through the air from the other one, and you are wondering which one you are connected to, the Option-click on the WiFi menu will tell you.\nIf there is an extender (or an Airport trying to reach to the main Airport) and it's a dead-end unplug it until you can reconnect it to the network.\n", "Q: In the event of a Jailbreak, Which I'm considering, What website/s should I trust? And do the risks out weigh the benefits? Some of my friends have jailbroken their Apple devices, but I'm not sure myself. Here, I'll give you some background info: I got my Ipod 4th Gen. as a Christmas present last year from my parents, and I am extremely reluctant about messing up my device. I have recently updated my Ipod to Version 5.1/ iOS 5, and I have done some reading on multiple sites, stating that they have just jailbroken that software. I've seen the benefits of jailbroken Ipods, but I terrified about messing up my device. Please notify me of trusted websites and useful information. Thanks! \n\nA: You shouldn't be too worried about it. I've jailbroken lots of iPhones and iPods and nothing has gone horribly wrong. Most if not everything is reversible so don't worry. As for places to go, redmondpie.com has a good guide, lifehacker.com also has one. Most of the things that you find on the Internet are good as long as they aren't asking you to pay for it. blog.iphone-dev.org is the official dev-team site so that's always a good starting place.\n", "Q: Is there a scale indicator bar for the Maps app on iPad? I'm using Google Maps in the Maps app on my iPad but I cannot find a scale bar.\nWhere is the scale bar for Google Maps in the native Maps app on an iPad?\n\nA: There is no scale bar in Maps for iPad. I think it is not official (yet) because even on Android it can only be enabled from the \"Labs\" settings. So, it is not part of the official Google Maps images.\n\nA: There is no scale bar in the Maps app, but you can use the app Mapscale, which gives you exactly what you desire.\n", "Q: Did the Java 1.6.0_31 update fix the Flashback trojan problem? Is the recent Java update of OSX (Java for OS X Lion 2012-002) to 1.6.0_31 also a bug fix for the Flashback malware?\nThe update is described here as:\n\nMultiple vulnerabilities exist in Java 1.6.0_29, the most serious of\n  which may allow an untrusted Java applet to execute arbitrary code\n  outside the Java sandbox.

In my right ear I hear a very low white noise sound.\nI've tried rebooting, fixing disk permissions (very long shot, I know), same problem if I play sound in a virtual windows machine. And off course I've verified that the sound balance is set to both left and right.\nI've \"looked\" into the mini-jack output but can't see anything wrong with it...\n\nA: Check your settings in System Preferences > Sound > Output.\nI had the same problem and for some mysterious reason my left-right balance was completely screwed up.\nNo idea how it happened but once I adjusted it to center it now plays back perfectly (:\n\nA: It is probably some dirt in- or another problem with your sound-output jack. \nIf twisting your headphone-cable or repeatedly plugging it in and out of your MacBook does not work, you might fix it by doing something like (gently!) poking into it with the backside of a matchstick or trying to clean it with some cotton buds. In that case make sure you have one that does not fall apart easily or you'll end up with a cotton-filled connector.\nIf that does not work, I'm not sure if you are able to fix it yourself since your MB might need to be taken apart to get into the jack and clean it…\n\nA: This is also a long shot, but check under System Preferences -> Universal Access -> Hearing and see if \"Play stereo audio as mono\" is checked.\n\nOne other possibility: plug your headphones in and run Audio MIDI Setup (it's in Applications/Utilities). See if one of the output channels is turned down or muted. Be sure your headphones are plugged in because OS X has separate settings for headphones and built-in speakers and switches between them automatically.\n\n\nA: If you find that the headphone channel is blown, a workaround I have used is something like this: Sound Blaster X-Fi Go! Pro\nThese types of devices use USB rather than your headphone port. They also produce great sound.. Several companies make these kinds of products and they are fairly cheap.\nHope this helps\n\nA: Thought I would answer here as I had the same thing on my old macbook and now on my new one. \nAnd it happened all of a sudden.\nLooks like my sennheiser headphones somehow sets the balance to left after pulling the headphones out.\nGo to sound settings and set the balance to the middle, assuming its on the left.\nOtherwise hardware issue, which I doubt.\n", "Q: Kindle on IPad Not Syncing Notes I've loaded the kindle app onto my IPad3.  I've made notes and highlights within that app, and I've given plenty opportunity for those to sync with Amazon...so that I can download those notes onto my kindle app on my PC.  \nBut the only thing about this kindle-app-on-IPad that syncs successfully is the \"furthest page read.\"  All my notes and highlights are not syncing.  How do I resolve this?\nNow for a segue from my question...\nI'm noticing a pattern here.  The IPad...\n\n\n*\n\n*Can't sync OneNote correctly\n\n*Can't sync ITunes correctly \n\n*Can't sync its own Calendar correctly\n\n*and now it can't sync the Kindle correctly\n\n\nIn short, I don't think the IPad is a proper \"connected\" device.  I'm at a point where I would recommend a Galaxy or Windows tablet to others...\nUpdate\nI went to the Genius bar at the Apple store.  These various problems are mostly resoled.  See separate links above for the answers.\n\nA: Deleting and re-loading a Kindle book from a device, such as a reader on my PC or the book from my Kindle, somehow causes the notes to finally come down to the desired device.  Evidently the IPad had sent the notes up to whisper net, but Amazon didn't push those notes to other devices.\nIn short, this is more an Amazon problem than an IPad issue. \n", "Q: AppleCare on the prizes from the new iPad contest? This question could technically go on meta, but I think it makes more sense here on AskDifferent proper. So the new iPad contest was awesome. I even won something. \nHere's the question: When I go to an Apple Store for a Genius Bar appointment, they often will look up the device's serial number and match it to my Apple account. Since the prizes were purchased by a StackExchange employee, ware the devices attached to his or her Apple ID? Can I go to an Apple store and add AppleCare, or do I need to transfer ownership, or are the devices registered to the winners individually by virtue of the fact that it was shipped as a gift, with a gift message?  \n\nA: Apple will register a device to anyone who presents it for service. It doesn't mean some database doesn't still remember to whom it was sold or registered in the past, but in practice it doesn't matter since possession is all that matters.\nAs to paying for AppleCare, you should get it in the country where you live if at all possible. That ensures you don't have to ship the device elsewhere if asked to do so. The plans are customized for the laws of each country - and in some cases, customized for states or provinces as needed within a country.\nAssuming the device was purchased from the US - you should also be fine buying AppleCare from the US store. Again, the warranty and service are valid worldwide, but in some cases, you will be responsible for shipping it to the country of purchase / AppleCare in cases where local service is not readily available.\n", "Q: Is there a way to overline text in Pages for the iPad? I use my iPad for note taking in my statistics class and I need to create an overline for the sample mean (which has a line over an  x  called x-bar) and I can't find a way to get it to work in Pages.\nI was able to get the Greek keyboard for all the other math symbols I needed, but this one I can't figure out.\n\nA: If you search for \"math symbols\" in the app store, you will find a number of apps designed to create such things for pasting into other apps.  Otherwise copy/paste from an existing note is solution I think.\n", "Q: Network printer hangs at \"sending print data...\" I can print a test page, but that's it. Anything else I try to print just hangs at \"sending print data...\".\nI'm running OS X 10.7.2 (Lion). My printer is a Canon PIXMA MP210. I'm using the driver from Canon's website. It works when connected via USB. My connection URI is:\nsmb://printme:pleas3@192.168.0.3/GoFlex_Home\n\nAnyone seen this before, and know how to fix?\n\nA: I installed Gutenprint for OS X. The newest version supports my printer. It now prints perfectly using that driver. Weird because it didn't seem like a driver issue. Thanks anyway guys! Hope this helps somebody in the future.\n\nA: On my Canon Pixma MP970 I have it plugged into the network and Canon's drivers installed.\nWhen I go to System Prefs -> Printers and Scanners, then Add a Printer it finds it under Default. I don't have to put in a printer address at all.\nthe SMB URI suggests you're accessing it via samba (Windows sharing). Is this a stand-alone networked printer, or being shared from another computer?\n", "Q: Blocking Internet access for a particular user On a MacBook that connects to the Internet via wi-fi, how can I prevent one user account from accessing the Internet (with no effect on other accounts)? \nNote: i want to block ALL access, not just Safari. \n\nA: Have you tried using the Parental Controls preference pane? A lot of options there, none specifically to block all internet access, but you can get to the same place by only allowing access to applications without it.\n\n\n*\n\n*From the Apple menu, choose System Preferences.\n\n*From the View menu, choose Parental Controls.\n\n\nMore info on the Apple web site: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2900?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\n\nA: A hardware-based solution to limit all access would be to use only a USB ethernet or WiFi adapter to connect to your Internet service.  Disable all built-in adapters, and only give physical access to the USB adapter to authorized users.\n", "Q: How can I set the time before the screen dims? I've got an iPad 3 on iOS 5.1. When reading occasionally my screen will dim before I interact with the screen; it doesn't turn off and lock but it dims.\nHow can I lengthen the timer for this? Is it the same option as the \"Auto Lock\" timeout in the Settings app?\n\nA: It is determined by the Auto Lock time and cannot be set independently of it. The Auto Lock can be changed in Settings > General > Auto-Lock. The longer you set it to not auto-lock, the longer the display will maintain it's normal brightness. \n\nA: Add this line to your piece of code in App Delegate after didFinishLaunching.\n[[UIApplication sharedApplication] setIdleTimerDisabled:YES];\n\n\nA: http://bgr.com/2014/10/23/ios-8-1-features-tips-tricks-dimming/\nRead this page and you can set it to dim manually with three home button pushes. This is a work around but you may actually like it since I did.\n", "Q: Copying Xcode.app from App Store to another computer (under different Apple ID) I don't want to re-download the 1.4GB of file, and the app itself is free. We're both Apple developers. Is there any way I can copy mine to his machine?\nThis is the current version of Xcode that doesn't download the \"Install Xcode\" file.\n(I have not tried, but perhaps trying to click \"Buy\", and then stopping the download, replacing it with my copy will work? Just a shot in the dark, seems very complicated.)\n\nA: You can simply copy Xcode to the other machine. There is a chance it will just work. Otherwise, when you try to launch the app it should ask you to sign in again, and if you sign in with an Apple ID that has already downloaded Xcode, you'll be good to go. (So your idea is right — you can start downloading it, then cancel and replace it with your own copy.)\nMore details: apps have the option to validate their receipt on launch. If the app is running on the wrong machine, it quits with an exit code of 173.\n\nThis exit status notifies the system that your application has determined that its receipt is invalid. At this point, the system attempts to obtain a valid receipt and may prompt for the user’s iTunes credentials.\nIf the system successfully obtains a valid receipt, it relaunches the application. Otherwise, it displays an error message to the user, explaining the problem.\n\nHowever, plenty of apps don't bother, and will launch without issue when moved to a different computer.\n", "Q: Renaming \"A's MacBook\" to \"C's MacBook\" I see that my Mac is called \"A's MacBook\" on the network.\nHow do I rename it (i.e., change the hostname) to \"C's MacBook\"?\nThat's the question. Here are the details:\nHaving read various suggestions to create a superfluous admin account before migrating using Time Machine, I went ahead and used \"A Admin\". The trouble is that that resulted in the hard disk getting named \"A's MacBook\", which does not match the directory under /Backups.backupdb on the Time Machine disk.\n\nA: One can rename one's \"Computer Name\" under Sharing in System Preferences.\n\nA: Click on the hard drive on the Desktop and then click again on the name of the drive or hit enter, the same way you'd rename any folder or file in the Finder.\n", "Q: Is there a way in Xcode to create a file not associated with a project? I know that I can do this if I open a text file and use Xcode but often when working on a project, I want to have a temporary place to write something (usually stuff that I'll be copying into the Terminal). Any way to do this in Xcode 4.3?\n\nA: There is no a way to do this in Xcode. It must be related to the project or workspace. It even does this if you deselect the target. \nIt sounds like what you need is a text editor and not an IDE like XCode since XCode is built for OS X and iOS development primarily. You may want to try TextWrangle for free, or it's purchasable counter part BBEdit.\nIf your doing C/C++, Python or PHP work, you may want to try some of the other JetBrains products like AppCode, PyCharm or PHPStorm. There is also Eclipse, with it's many plugins, the heavy favorite amongst many developers. \n\nA: Specific to RoR, rvm 1.9.3 works with Xcode 4.3.2. Issue was fixed 16 days ago. See https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/issues/846\nFor other tools, install the \"Command Line Tools\" option under Components in Xcode, and you're ready to compile native binaries.\nOne suggestion, file a rdar at bugreport.apple.com to request php, ruby, python templates be re-included in Xcode. And please remember to file a copy of the rdar at http://openradar.appspot.com/page/1 so rest of us can also file our own rdar referencing your rdar. This helps escalate it to the attention of Apple Engineers.\nLastly, post the details of your openradar filing here so future readers can also do the same.

Are there any gotcha's or will it work just as if it was residing locally but with the benefit of accessing one file from multiple machines ?\n\nA: Dropbox works for me using multiple computers with a single iBank file.  It's good to set iBank to automatically backup its files onto Dropbox also.  The only caveat is if you open your iBank on a second machine before the Dropbox has updated with the file from the previous machine.  In that case you'll have two competing iBank files trying to update on Dropbox. \nThe fix is to disable backup/sync temporarily, delete the iBank.ibank file from Dropbox, and restore the iBank.ibank file from the backup.  Then enable the normal backup/sync procedure.\nI rarely have to go through that procedure, though.  Just keep an eye on your Dropbox folder when using a new machine, and wait til it's updated before using iBank.\n", "Q: How can my company get our custom Java software to run on the iPad? I have small company and we have custom software that is written in Java.\nI am planning to buy a tablet.  Originally I intended to get an Android tablet, but I am really impressed by the resolution of the new iPad screen.\nThe 1M dollar question is: Is there any way to make Java programs run on the iPad? Can I compile them or get an unofficial Java Virtual Machine that will run them on Apple's tablet?\n\nA: You won't be able to take your existing Java binaries and run them on the iPad, since there is no Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on the iPad, nor can you install one.  Apple doesn't permit third-party language runtimes or plugins to be installed on iOS.\nJailbreaking your device may provide you with more freedom in that regard, but I'll assume you're not interested in that.  (If you are, see questions here tagged jailbreak.)\nThe only remaining potential solution not involving jailbreak is to adapt and compile your software into a native iOS application.  This will take some work.\nSince you mentioned your software is custom software, you should have the source code.  With original source code and some not-so-trivial effort & expertise, it is possible to port your custom software to a native iOS application. A natively-compiled, self-contained iOS application doesn't require a runtime to be present on the device.\nThere are a couple of ways to go about doing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*The orthodox way to develop iOS applications is to use Apple's own Xcode & Objective-C.  Your Java code can be translated, by a competent developer, into an Objective-C implementation for iOS.  This is a considerable amount of work, yet is likely to yield the best end product.\n\n*There also exists third-party development tools to enable apps to be created with other languages/frameworks, such as Java, C#, ActionScript, JavaScript – to name a few. One such framework for Java in particular is Particle Code.  I have no experience with this – I suggest more research if you want to follow this path.\nWhile the second approach allows more code re-use, there is still likely a considerable amount of development involved to adapt the application to a mobile form-factor.\nFor follow-up questions about developing for iOS, please refer to Stack Overflow.\n\nA: You can't run Java on iPad right now.\nYou can however connect to remote host that can run java apps through VNC/RDC type apps like these.\n\nA: LiveCirrus works for that!  It uses a cloud platform to deliver the desktop software onto mobile devices.  There's a demo in the app store.  \n\nA: Run a VNC app on your iPad (such as Connect My Mac, but there are many). Set it up by turning on screen sharing (and port forwarding on your router if required). On a local network it should be very fast, less so over the internet, but you will still be able to use your Java app on your iPad as it runs on your Mac. You simply share and control the Macs screen and keyboard.\n\nA: Use webswing on a Linux box then turn your browser on your iPad to the IP address. Works great. Will act like two computers instead of taking controls of one.\n", "Q: Add additional filetype to a specific \"Kind\" In Finder one is able to group the files by kind. For example \"Movie\" kind groups .avi, .mov together. I would like to add additional file extension .mkv to the list of \"Movie\" kind. Is it possible? \nAs a bonus, it would also be interesting to know if, similarly, it is possible to add additional \"kinds\" of files.\n\nA: The reason this is happening is answered here, https://superuser.com/questions/371892/osx-assign-extension-to-content-kind\nUnfortunately, there isn't a really fix for the problem.\n", "Q: Should I buy Ram memory DDR3 1066MHz for Mac mini (Mid 2011)? I got a Mac mini last year and now I want to update the ram memory. I was looking for it and I just found this (spanish). The guy is selling  what you see on the picture and I'm worried if I get those memories my Mac won't run ok. The guy says it works without problem on Mac Mini (Mid 2011) but I'm not sure because the image says \"Laptop memory\".\nThis info is about my mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*2.3 GHz Intel Core i5\n\n*2 GB 1333 MHz DDR3 \n\n*And running OS X Lion.\n\n\nWould you suggest to buy that memory? Or the should be X GB 1333 MHz DDR3?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: To be sure you are getting something that will work I suggest shopping with a specialist Mac dealer like OWC, where you will be asked what machine you have and then you can choose from the memory they offer that fits it. They ship to Australia so Spain should be no trouble. Sure you can work it out and get something cheaper but I don't have time for that generally, don't mind supporting a dealer who supports my machine better and if it goes wrong I can say \"but you said it would work!\" (haven't needed to yet)\nBesides I like having as much memory as possible and they offer a 16GB kit. With Xcode, Safari and Pixelmator open I often see more than 8GB in use.\nI have only once kept the memory in a Mac when upgrading and in a mini with two memory slots you almost certainly won't. You will want to have two identical memory modules. The nice thing about the mini is that upgrading is so easy, you can get to the memory as soon as you take the bottom cover off.\nFor your Mac they offer 1333Mhz memory. Looks like it is what it came with also. I would personally not buy 1066MHz because even if it works perfectly it is possibly going to cause the memory bus to run a little slower than it could. RAM is so cheap right now and the wrong RAM can be a really big frustration, why take a chance?\n\nA: This memory will work (Mac Minis use SO-DIMMs, also called laptop memory), but it will not use the full potential of your motherboard. This pair of Corsair is great for a 2010 MacBooks with 320m Nvidia.\nIf you are able, you should seek and buy DDR3-1333Mhz SO-DIMM (also called PC3-10600).\nps. I have checked the prices and 200PEN (google tells me that this is around 75USD) is way higher than the price you should pay (40-50 USD).\n", "Q: iPad/iPhone AnyConnect VPN wrong MTU size I try to connect with a iPad (iOS 5.1) and the AnyConnect app to connect to a OpenVPN server on a Debian server. But this warning always appears in the OpenVPN log:\n\nWARNING: Bad encapsulated packet length from peer (5635), which must\n  be > 0 and <= 1560 -- please ensure that --tun-mtu or --link-mtu is\n  equal on both peers\n\nOn the server side the tun interface mtu size is 1500 bytes.\nI can connect with other clients (pcs, macs, ...) to the server. But with a iPad or iPhone client this warning appears and no connection is established.\nHow can I fix this?\nBr\n\nA: Unfortunately, it isn't possible to set the MTU on iOS. There is no GUI for it, and without jailbreaking you can't access the ifconfig command line tool that would be used to configure this on OS X (I think ifconfig might not exist anyway even if you do jailbreak).\nI have the same problem with a VPN I use occasionally. To use it with OS X I have to run sudo ifconfig ppp0 mtu 1270. From iOS there is no solution, however I've noticed VLC clients seem to work fine even with a broken MTU and am able to access the office network that way.\nTo fix this, you're going to have to configure your server somehow - that would be a good question for Serve Fault.\n", "Q: What C++ IDEs are available for iPhone? I really love my iPhone, and much as possible, I want to do everything from there.\nI'm a software engineering student and, when I'm away from my PC, I'm planning to use my iPhone as my programming machine (meaning that I want to program directly on my iPhone).\nAre there any available IDEs for iPhone that will let me program in C++?\n\nA: There are no native IDE available for iOS. Apple restricts unsigned code from being run on all iOS devices, thus making an IDE on iOS impossible. (this is possible on android to run code directly on the device that is written on device)\nYour best bet is to get a regular text editor such as nimbus or anything that can checkout documents and edit them from git, svn or dropbox. You will never be able to run this code on iOS, so you will need to push it to your repository and compile and run it via a remote desktop client or via a SSH terminal. \nTo really fully automate this process you would have to edit your code, push it to the repository, compile it on another machine and then have that compiled binary shipped to your device using a distribution mechanism like testflightapp via a series of scripts (test flight has an API for this). It's not impossible, just hard. \nAnother option is to use a remote desktop client and remote to an IDE on a PC to edit and run your code there.\n\nA: Yeah,\nThere is c++ ide in AppStore. But the problem is that it is paid app.there are around 3 or 4 c++ ide. Some of the ide are cppcode,codetogo,c++ ide.\n", "Q: Claim warranty on a MacBook I need to know if I can make a warranty claim on a MacBook if there are oxide deposits on its motherboard. I live in a cabana close to the beach, so I am worried.\nnote: I don't have the Apple Care package with me. But my MacBook is just 8 months old.\n\nA: Yes you can claim apple care service with out the paper work, all you need is the serial number of the MacBook to verify coverage.\nNow if it's cosmetic and not causing any problems with your Mac Book it's  really a judge ment call on Apple if they want to replace it. Contact Apple and non demandingly ask about what they can do about the oxidation.\n", "Q: Which iPhones support the apt-X codec for Bluetooth audio? I'm shopping for a new Bluetooth headset for my iPhone 4 and noticed that some headsets support the apt-X codec for \"CD-quality sound\". Presumably this is better quality than plain old A2DP that I've been using so far.\nWhich iPhones (if any) support apt-X audio over Bluetooth?\n\nA: No iPhone has native support for apt-X, but you can buy a dongle such as the Sennheiser BTD 300i or a similar one from Creative to enable apt-X support.\n\nA: Currently no iPhones support aptX, but it is supported by the Mac OS X. You can use dongles from Creative, Sennheiser or Jaybird with the iPhone to take advantage of aptX audio quality. \n", "Q: Is there a way to keep a copy of our highlighting in iBooks? (email it or print it) In iBooks, we can see a list of our highlighting and added notes to an ebook, but when we email it, so as to keep a copy for ourselves, only the added notes that we wrote is emailed.  The highlighting is not.\nIs there a way to keep a copy of what we highlighted as well?  We can take a snapshot of the iPad screen, but that's a photo instead of text.\nThere is also a \"Print\" option, although I don't have any printer linked up for the iPad to use.  Can that Print option print highlighting, or print it as a PDF doc?  Or any other possible way to keep a copy of our highlighting and notes? \n\nA: \nCan I print my books and PDFs from iBooks?\nYes, you can print PDFs and notes you've entered from iBooks, but the\n  option to print ePub books is not available.2 You can also email PDFs\n  and notes you have written from iBooks.\nCan I highlight text and make notes?\niBooks includes built-in Highlight and Note features. Highlight any\n  word or passage of text within a book. You can also create a Note from\n  your highlighted selection. Review your Highlights and Notes by\n  tapping the Table of Contents button and then tapping Bookmarks.\n  Highlights and Notes appear in their own section under Bookmarks.\n\nsource: apple support page\nDoesn't seem to be a straight yes/no answer for printing of the highlighted area, but you can turn a highlighted area into a note, which will print/email.\n\nA: Using iBooks 3.0 and iOS6 , you can share annotations to Facebook (if that’s a problem, configure access to be private-only). This gives you an archive of all notes… on Facebook.\nNot a good solution but still usable.\n", "Q: How come compiling my .tex file with my alias is lagging? I have written an alias in ~/.bashrc to compile my tex files into pdfs. I am sure that ~/.bashrc is sourced.\nalias p='rm -f *.pdf *.log *.aux;pdflatex *.tex;open *.pdf'\n\nHowever, after I edit my .tex file in XCode, save, and run the command p in my terminal, the pdf that opens is a previous version, not the latest version. The pdf matching the latest version of my tex file surfaces after I run p several times.\nWhat is causing the lag? My Mac Air runs Lion.\n\nA: A few thoughts:\n\n\n*\n\n*This question better asked at the TeX.SE site. \n\n*.tex files need to be compiled multiple times, not just once. Run pdflatex *.tex 3x and then open, and it should work\n\n*There are much much better LaTeX editors than XCode.\n\n*The latexmk script is, in my opinion, the best .tex compiler. It handles compiling the file as many times as necessary. rubber is another LaTeX compiler.\n\n", "Q: Compile VLC on Lion I am trying to compile VLC on my Mac along with guide on wiki.

I just discovered that if I Turn Hiding On and right click on the iTunes app in my dock and press Show Recents, then my dock will no longer appear when I move my mouse to the bottom of the screen until I log out and back in. I have the latest version of Lion and I was wondering if this was only me.\n\nA: This may be only you, which could be an issue with the preference files, etc. \nShow recents (with a Dock that hides) for me shows the transparent dark screen, and whatever icons that should be there for that app, and shows the dock fully available. \nOnce clicking on the desktop though, to get out of this mode, my dock hides again as it should. \nI would recommend removing the Dock preferences, which is located at ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist, and then restarting the dock. \nYou should open the Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app), and then run:\nrm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist\n\nthen run\nkillall Dock\n\nto restart the dock. You may have to set up your dock icons again, but this may help the dock not showing back up after using 'Show Recents'\n\nA: To explain show recents: \nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3258198?start=0&tstart=0\nBasically, if the app is closed you can right click on it in the Dock and have it show recently opened documents.\nAs for it killing the Dock, no, my Dock is in hiding mode, and I can show recents on iTunes and it still reappears afterwards.\n", "Q: Configuring @me.com account on Adium I am trying to set up my iCloud (@me.com) account in Adium.

Sometimes they just don't work and sometimes the action is delayed by minutes.  I'll hit the key out of habit and then nothing will happen, so I'll go into iTunes and pause.  Then maybe 5 minutes later, it will unpause (presumably because the key event finally made it to iTunes.)\nAny idea what in the world is going on?  The only thing that seems to fix it is a reboot (though a log out and log in might do it as well.  Not in a position to try that at the moment.)\nArgh! It just happened again.  Super annoying.\n\nA: I finally just figured it out!  It turns out that I had a Quicktime process that was stopped  (I had done an open on an avi file on the command line.)  A kill -CONT on the pid allowed it to continue so I could close it and now I have my keys back!\n\nA: The problem for me seems to be caused by QuickTime 7 + OS-X 10.10. \nBut QuickTime seems to need to be running a while before there's any noticeable latency. And the longer it's running, the longer the latency in the processing of play/pause/skip by iTunes.\nRunning QuickTime 10.10 seems to completely disable the play/pause/skip processing - at least in some cases.\nIn either case the latency disappears as soon as QT is terminated.\n\nA: I fixed my delay by running this command in terminal:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -seed -r -f -v -domain local -domain user -domain system\n\nThis function resets user domains.

I'm both a (newbie) developer, student and a gamer. Right now I have Ubuntu 11.10 and Windows 7 installed on my box. I usually run Ubuntu for my everyday chores, but when I want to play games or type a damn report, I have to switch over to Windows (Sorry, I'm still trying to get accustomed to OpenOffice :)) Since I am going to reinstall my OSes, I want to look at all my options. Seeing that some games I play - StarCraft II, LOL, Diablo III - already supports Mac OS, so I am thinking of giving it a try as well.\nI'd like to know if developing the same technologies using Mac OS is anything different from using Ubuntu. The technologies I currently have my hands dirty with and are especially concerned about are: GNU C/C++, Boost, Cassandra (Thrift, LibEvent, Flex, Bison), MySQL, Java, Android, Python (Django) and PHP. (Especially Cassandra, because I need to compile it from source for a project.)\n\nA: Most or all of the software that you've mentioned is available for OS X (except LoL, which you can run through Bootcamp under your Win7). OS X is a nice operating system with a lot of very well designed software, but the best way to see how it works is to actually use it for a while. I have used Linux and I believe that OS X is much more polished but some people might not care about this and would love to have the ability to tweak every single aspect of their OSs. \nAll Blizzard games run perfectly on a Mac. I do Android (and iOS through Xcode) development using Eclipse and I have no problem using OS X for all my needs. \n\nA: OS X will be able to run most of what you want for what you have listed. If you want to run ubuntu, running it in VMWare Fusion is the best option since you won't have to reboot each time. Anything that cant be run on OS X you can just stand up a simple Windows VM on VMWare Fusion todo that dirty work for you. \nFor Development, you'll be able to run mostly everything that doesn't require .NET  or Visual Studio. There is also the mono project for running .NET cross-platform. \nWindows is still the dominate platform for games, although their are OS X versions of most of the games you listed, windows is still more likely to be the platform for new games. You could run a copy of windows in VMware Fusion, but I wouldn't count on it doing a ton of heavy graphics processing.  Fortunately, it seems like more and more games that are made for iOS are coming to iOS and vise versa. \nYou may want to ditch OpenOffice and switch to the non-Oracle fork of OpenOffice LibreOffice.\n\nA: I believe the simplest answer to your main question is 'No.'\nEven though OS X can be used for gaming and developing, the former is never the user's goal.\nYou're better off sticking to your current environment of Windows and Ubuntu, unless you're considering developing iOS or OS X applications using Xcode, which can (mostly) only be done in Mac OS X.\nIf you're looking for a change, why not upgrade to Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04 (or 13.10)? Windows 8 offers better performance on the same hardware as Windows 7. You can get rid of the useless Windows Start Screen by installing Classic Shell. A more recent version of Ubuntu will give you updated tools for development and newer Unity 3D WM.\nI use an iMac, but I also have a notebook with Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 13.10.\n", "Q: Can I cmd-F and click a highlighted link in Safari (or something similar) without a mouse? I'm trying to make my Mac as mouseless and possible. My three last big hurdles: \n\n\n*\n\n*Moving the current window to a different space in Spaces. (I'm still on OS 10.6, until 10.8 comes out.)\n\n*A more efficient way to move through toolbars and menu bar than Tab. \nAnd\n\n\n*\n\n*When using Safari, being able to Cmd-F (\"find\") linked text and then click it.

But you can OptTab / OptShiftTabthrough the page's links until you've highlighted the one you want, then Enter to activate it.  \nIn Preferences | Advanced, you can reverse the Tab behavior so the Tab selects links and OptTab selects window elements.\n\nA: According to https://superuser.com/questions/233246/move-windows-between-spaces-in-mac-os-x-using-only-the-keyboard there is no keyboard shortcut for moving a window to a different space.\n", "Q: Are there any 1D laser barcode scanners that work well with iOS? I'm looking for a scanner that works similarly to the Microvision ROV which has worked very well for me in the past when connected to a Mac and Delicious Library.\n\nIs there anything comparable on the market for iOS bluetooth scanning?\nRequirements are to be dedicated external hardware. I prefer battery powered, bluetooth and fast/rugged aspect of a 1D laser powered barcode scanner. Small is nice, but the KoamTac appear to be too fragile so I'd rather something built more like the micro vision or symbol line of USB scanners that are built more like tanks.\nI don't need 2D scanning and am really looking for a laser to pick the exact line needed to read multiple barcodes and rapidly scan in low light situations. I'm hoping someone has actually used this hardware and can speak to the usability of any devices for industrial and/or high volume scanning (think 100 iMac that need inventory from Apple's barcodes sitting on a shipping dock).\nWhat hardware can assist with this?\n\nA: What do you think of the Socket CX2870-1409 Barcode Scanner?\nhttps://www.barcodesinc.com/socket/part-cx2870-1409.htm#overview\nThe reviews are very decent across the board.\n", "Q: Not all TV shows available to redownload on iTunes show up on Apple TV Some TV Shows that are available to re-download on iTunes is not showing up on my Apple TV. Now I understand that not every show I purchased is available for re-download (2, exactly) - but those that are available on iTunes should theoretically be available on the Apple TV as well, right? Here are some screenshots to show what I mean:\nApple TV:\n\niTunes:\n\nI tried resetting my Apple TV a couple of times because I read online this might help, but it's not helping me. It still only shows 12 available items on my Apple TV whilst iTunes on my Mac shows 15.\n\nA: They are all available, it's just a numbering and naming inconsistency between the devices. \nOn the Apple TV, the \"All TV Shows 12\" is referring to the total number of distinct TV shows (example: Seinfeld, 30 Rock, The Office, etc). \nIn the iTunes Store > Purchased section on your Mac, the \"Total: 15 items\" is referring to the total number of seasons of all the combined different TV shows. \nYou have 3 seasons of \"Peanuts Specials\" (which iTunes treats as one distinct show) and 2 seasons of \"Peanuts' Charlie Brown\" (another distinct show). So the total number of distinct TV shows is 12.\n", "Q: On iPad, is there a way to go to \"end of list\" or \"end of page\" -- besides going to \"top of page\"? There is a way on iPad to go to top of the page or list, in email's list of emails, or in iBooks's highlighting and notes, for example, by tapping on the top status bar of the iPad screen.\nBut is there a way to go to the end of page or list?  For example, on iBooks, when the highlightings and notes are shown, sometimes a user may want to see the last highlighting or notes, but in some cases, the list is 12 pages long.  In this case, is there a quick way to go to the end, or will a user just need to scroll the 12 pages to reach the end?\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no easy way to scroll to the end of a document other than by swiping repeatedly. It would be nice if Apple could add a specific gesture for this common action. If enough people request this feature at http://www.apple.com/feedback/ipad.html maybe they will add it into a future version of iOS.\n\nA: HOW TO GO TO THE END OF YOUR DOCUMENT FAST WITHOUT SCROLLING THE SCREEN ON YOUR iPAD WITH YOUR FINGERS TEDIOUSLY\nWhen you want to stop typing press two spacing to put in the period or full-stop sign (.), automatically。Then press two or more spacing again and type in another period or full-stop sign (.).

Is there any way to enable spam filtering on iPad mail?  \n\nA: Unfortunately, no. The filtering happens on your mail server, if the one that you are using supports spam filter (like Gmail).\n", "Q: Is there a remote desktop or vnc app for the IPad that properly handles Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts? I've tried 4 or 5 remote desktop apps, the most notable being Jump Desktop and Splashtop Streamer. Most of these remote desktop apps have some sort of on-screen keyboard for typing with the IPad, including special keys like shift, control, alt. The special keys act like  \"sticky keys\" meaning they stay depressed until another key is pressed, to make it easier to do key combinations. Even non-standard keyboard combinations like shift+enter work, in this sticky sense.\nWhen using a Bluetooth keyboard with the remote desktop apps, both Jump and Splashtop Streamer recognize the shift + letter combination for doing capital letters. However, generically pressing shift, cntrl, or alt does not depress the sticky on screen shift buttons or do anything at all. Only a few combinations are recognized (again like shift+letter, cntrl+C). Most combinations do not work (shift+enter, alt+tab). Even having the keyboard shortcuts work like sticky keys (press shift then enter, not both at once) would be much better than the limited functionality they have now. \nIs there an app, jailbreak app, or workaround that lets me use bluetooth keyboard properly with remote desktop on the ipad?\n\nA: I'm one of the developers on Jump Desktop.\n\n\n*\n\n*The current version of Jump on the App Store (4.0.6) lets you use many shortcut combinations (including Ctrl+C) using macros: http://support.jumpdesktop.com/entries/188429 . \n\n*We're beta testing the next version of Jump that has 100% bluetooth keyboard support (i.e. you won't need to use macros and all keys work like on a regular keyboard).

I very rarely synchronise my iPhone with iTunes. Because every time I do it all apps are re-arranged on the phone to like they were at the time of my last synching. \nApps that I deleted on the iPhone are transferred to it and folders and location of the icons are out of my preferred order. \nHow can I avoid this?\n\nA: You could disable App syncing completely on the apps tab. Then iTunes will not sync the apps anymore and so it won't re-arrange them.\nThe drawback is that new apps won't be downloaded to your Mac/PC anymore. So in case you have to restore your iPhone using iTunes you will have to re-download all the apps. But as your purchases are connected to your Apple ID you will not loose the apps. They're just not stored on your Mac/PC.\n\nA: When you connect your iPhone to your computer and run iTunes, click on your iPhone under Devices on the left. Then click on Apps in the tabs across the top. This will show you the various screens of apps on your iPhone and also show you a list of all apps installed as a scrolling list.\nYou can check and uncheck the apps you want to sync over to the iPhone in the scrolling list, you can move the apps into the arrangement you want on the virtual screens.\nWhen everything is as you want it, click Sync in the lower right of iTunes.\nYou shouldn't have to do this ever time (I don't) and things should stay about the same now. As you add new apps on the iPhone, however, they'll go to the last screen by default. You will still need to drag them where you want them after they download.\n", "Q: How do I check an iOS device's battery health? I am looking for a way to check the current health of a battery for iOS devices, similar to how coconutBattery works for OS X. \nHow can I check the battery health for an iOS device?\n\nA: Apple has an official tool as part of iOS 11.3 for iPhones in the settings app:\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208387\niPadOS shows a graph of recent usage but doesn’t offer a health analysis.\nwatchOS devices show health of the battery and also offer optimized charging.\n\nMany people had strong opinions on power throttling in iOS and excellent technical details are in this link.\nTap the settings app and then scroll up the list so you can see and select the Battery item (above Privacy and below Emergency SOS) and then select Battery Health:\n\n\n\n\nSince the feature was Beta, it has been quite accurate on several devices I have tested with various aged batteries and overall performance that I subjectively / objectively measure.\nHere is a device that’s almost three years old\n\n\nA: There are apps that you can use to assess battery health, but I recommend a Mac/PC app called iBackupBot. Tether your device (non-jailbroken works) to your computer, navigate to the lower left window pane, select the device, and click the link for ‘More Informations’.

Any suggestion for a non-Apple monitor to connect to MBA (mid-2011)? The display has to reach the same resolution without flickering. Does a non-Apple Thunderbolt display exist?\n\nA: It's not advertised all that well, but Apple still sells the non-Thunderbolt 27\" LED Display (Apple Store US Link).\nAs CajunLuke points out, there are other good 27\" displays out there, notably by Dell and HP, just be careful that you're getting one that isn't low resolution (1920x1080 on a 27\" won't look great - the good ones are 2560x1440), and has a native Displayport input - as you may be aware, the miniDisplayport to dual-link DVI adapters have some issues.\n\nA: Most any 27\" display has the same resolution as the Apple Thunderbolt Display. However, the Apple Thunderbolt display is the only Thunderbolt display currently on sale.\nIf you simply want at 27\" display that's not made by Apple, check out Dell and HP.\n\nA: Asus allegedly demoed a 27\" thunderbolt display at computex, but the disappointing thing is that the review says it's only 1920 x 1080.

He has a ton of useful scripts, including Super Remove Dead Tracks, which you might be able to modify to just list them if you want.\nOr, if all you want to do is create a playlist of songs which have no native file, there is a very simple way to do that (which I found repeated by so many people that I don't know who to attribute it to):\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a regular playlist, not a smart playlist. For this example, call the playlist \"Alive\".\n\n*Select all tracks in your main library and drag them into \"Alive\". Note that \"dead\" tracks with no native file will not appear in this playlist.\n\n*Create a smart playlist defined as: Playlist -- Is Not -- Alive. Call this playlist \"Dead\".\nYou now have a list of \"!\" songs which are missing their native files.  You could then go ahead and delete the dead ones if you wish.\nDeleting is not allowed from a smart playlist. So, select all songs from the new \"Dead\" playlist by clicking Ctrl A. Right-Click and select Dislike. Now they can be seen and deleted in the main library; sort using Love/Dislike column. Tested in current Windows version.\n", "Q: How can I get messages beta to start in \"hidden mode\" I have installed the beta of messages.

One feature of iTerm 2 is that windows can appear from the top of the screen, so if I press Contol-Command-T while I'm using any other application, I can have a transparent command line appear from the top, which has proven itself to be quite useful. \nHowever, I have often brought up the terminal window from the top of the screen, and later, while editing some code in vim or during an ssh session, wanted to switch to fullscreen or a normal window, while keeping my current window's state.  Is there a built-in way to switch the style from top of the screen to normal window without having to type in all of my previous commands to get to where I was before?\nThanks in advance for any help.\n\nA: If you're serious about terminal work, I would suggest looking at tmux, especially as new builds of iTerm 2 come with it precompiled in (though I use the 'vanilla' version). In your case, if you were using tmux you could detach the current session from the window you're in, and then reattach in a new one (i.e., full screen), or just have multiple windows attached to the same session. There are some other advantages to using tmux, but I'm sure you'll discover them as you're using the program more.\nAlternatively, have iTerm show the tab bar even if you only have one tab (make sure Appearance > Hide tab bar… is unchecked), and then you can 'pull' the tab out into its own window to continue using it.\n", "Q: iPad Remote app with Apple TV 2 not remembering where I was in iTunes pane Whenever I closed my smart cover or otherwise dismiss the Remote app, attempts to reopen the app result in a \"reset\", acting as though it was the first time remote was opened and \"forgetting\" where I was in the virtual iTunes view.

Then, when Lion was released, I upgraded to it. However, yesterday, I had to erase my entire HDD (because of a permanent kernel panic due to the removal of some vital OS stuff). \nThe problem is that now I can't install Snow Leopard again (so that I may upgrade to Lion) or install Lion without downloading it (my connection is VERY slow, it would take over a week possibly). I tried using the Snow Leopard disc, which I confirmed to work on a Windows machine, to install it. However, it just ejects the disc on my Mac, going to the new Lion thing after boot (where you can install it by downloading from Apple's servers). It does the same with a Lion disc that I burned myself. Holding C won't help, and the discs won't appear on the option boot screen. \nWhat should I do? Is there any way to revert the firmware back to pre-Lion, so that I may install Snow Leopard and then upgrade? \nNote: I only have a Windows machine working, not another Mac.\n\nA: Firmware shouldn't have anything to do with it. I was able to install SL while I had Lion on. Maybe there is some problem with your disk drive on Mac? \nI haven't tried it but you might be able to use the disc from a network device but you will have to find more info on it. Also you might be able to revert the system sometime back using Time Machine. Have you looked into that?\n\nA: There is definitely something wrong, what you've described sounds like exactly the right steps to solve your problem, either you're doing something wrong or the disk is damaged or your Mac's optical drive isn't working.\nHold down the option key while booting your Mac, and insert the Snow Leopard install disk. It should show up after a minute (maybe you have to press \"refresh\"? I can't remember), and you can boot from it. Before installing, it's probably a good idea to use Disk Utility to repartition and erase your hard drive, specifically to remove the recovery partition that Lion has created for you (it will be recreated if you install Lion again later).\nFailing that, you can try booting from the Snow Leopard install disk using another Mac to see if it's working, or try using someone else's install disk on your Mac. You might also try duplicating the disk on your Windows pc (using an app that does a low level/raw disk copy, not just a file copy — which will not work).\nIf none of that works for you, perhaps take your Snow Leopard install disk in to an Apple store or Reseller and tell them you can't get it to boot, maybe they will be willing to test the disk for you and perhaps give you a new one (for free if they're really nice).\nYou can also use someone else's Mac to download Lion (open the App Store on their Mac, log out of their account, log into your account, go to Purchases and click download on Lion, then log out of your account. Remember to log out of your account! otherwise they might accidentally buy apps with your credit card). Once you have the Lion install package on their Mac, right-click and Show Package Contents on it and drill through the folders until you find the InstallESD.dmg file. Use Disk Utility to copy that DMG onto a DVD or USB memory stick (use the \"backup/restore\" feature to copy the DMG's content onto the disk). Old Macs can't boot off a USB memory stick, but all recent ones can.\nI've been told most Apple Stores are willing to do the above for you if you explain you've got a slow internet connection at home.\n\nA: I know it's an hold post but I didn't found solution anywhere so I post mine here.\nApperently your Macbook (and my Macbook too ;) ) can't boot with the software in the live CD of Snow Leopard. What I did is that I took an external HDD, an old Macbook (not the pro) and install SL on the HDD. \nThe important step is to boot the HDD FIRST ON THE OLD MAC and do the software update. \nAfter that you can boot your HDD on your Macbook Pro and copy it with Disk utility in your internal HDD.\nTought you could also do this procedure via Target mode ... but I didn't tested :)\nHope this post will be usefull for someone in the future.\n", "Q: Is there a way for the iPad mail show calendar links, as the iPhone's? If I receive a mail in the iPhone with the text \"tomorrow morning\", this text turns into a link for \"tomorrow morning\" in the calendar app. The same doesn't happens on the iPad. Is there a way to enable it?\n\nA: How odd. On my iPad I do get links to the Calendar app, for the text 'Tomorrow morning', just as on iPhone.\nI just looked in the Settings app, under 'Mail, Contacts, Calendars', for an option to turn this facility off and on. There isn't one.\nSo I don't think the issue is the iPad itself.

Any proven guide/tutorial?\n\n\nA: You can check out OWC. On the page itself, they have information on the RAM that's suitable for various Mac. They also have a bunch of video tutorial on the installation of RAM for different Mac model.\n\nA: 1067 Mhz DDR3 is what you care about. You can do it on your own. Apple provides instructions on their website and you can find it on many places too.\nFor installing the RAM you just need a screwdriver small enough for the screws on the bottom of the computer. After that ground your self or use plastic gloves and take out the old memory put in the new and you are done.\nManufacturers don't matter as long as the memory is 1067 Mhz DDR3 for laptop. Its better to go for well known brands I guess such as kingston,crucial corsair etc. \nI bought a Crucial Memory Kit 8GB from amazon for about £35 same type of memory with the one you need and it worked perfect.\n\nA: I have MacBook Pro 6,2, but it uses the same 1067-DDR3 memory. I've replaced my own with Samsung memory; originally Micron memory was installed.\n", "Q: Set an alert for an event in a subscribed calendar in iCal My meetup.com account allows me to subscribe to an iCal calendar that displays all meetups that I have RSVP'd \"yes\" to.\nAll of the events appear as expected, but none of them have an alert setting (e.g., display message 2 hours before).\nIs there a way to set an alert for events in a read-only subscribed calendar?\n\nA: As of iOS 13, Calendar's Default Alert Time setting will be used for alerts in the external calendar subscription.\n\n*\n\n*Before subscribing to the external calendar, go to Settings > Calendar, tap Default Alert Times and select the desired alert (in user5118's case, \"2 hours before\")\n\n*Subscribe to the external calendar as usual\n\nTo change the alerts for a subscribed calendar (e.g. from \"None\" to \"2 hours before\"), unsubscribe from the calendar, change Calendar's Default Alert Time as described above and then re-subscribe.

I've tried to make it work here using a calendar I'm subscribed to and my only option is to view the event.\nEven if I try to delete an individual event within the subscribed .ics calendar I'm presented with a dialog saying You can't change items in calendars you subscribe to.\nIf you are sent an invite by someone then you can set an alert for that event.\nIf Meetup.com allows you to set an alert in the subscribed calendar that may be your only option.\n\nA: @ M.W. There is a another way.\nIn the Calendar app on our Mac go to Preferences.\nSelect \"Alerts\"\nSelect the \"Account\" you want to modify alerts for.\nChoose an  a selection for \"Events\", \"All Day Events\", \"Birthdays\"\nYou will see that \"Use these default alerts on this computer only\" is greyed out. That is because these are per-device/local setting.\nNow every event in your calendar will be updated with those alert settings.\nAnother option is to download the Google Calendar app and allow it notify you for only those events.\n\nA: You can Control click on the calendar in iCal and go to Get Info and enable 'Ignore Alerts'. I'm not sure if this preference syncs with the iPhone too, but it certainly works on the Mac.\n", "Q: How to test if samba server is working without a PC? I set up smb file sharing on my MacBook so that an iPad app could browse my computer, but the iPad app is not showing a directory listing. I am not sure if this is just not working/configured properly, like if my computer has a port that is closed somehow.\nI am using OplayerHD on the iPad and cannot get my MacBook's files to be seen. I used to test that samba is working with another PC on the same network but such resources aren't available to me right now.\nHow can I verify that samba is working without a PC? \n\nA: I think your best bet is to install a different samba app on your iPad, and try that.\nIs there any particular reason you want to use SMB? It's a bit of a security risk to enable SMB file sharing, since it has very weak authentication compared to other file sharing protocols. Perhaps you can find a better iPad app that doesn't use SMB? SFTP (\"Remote Login\" in System Preferences -> Sharing) is the most secure, especially if you have a decent password.\nIt looks like Oplayer HD also supports FTP, which you can enable on your mac using:\nsudo -s launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ftp.plist\n\nBeware, in some ways FTP is even less secure than SMB.\n", "Q: Can I un-jailbreak an Apple TV? I'm considering switching out my Windows-based HTPC for an Apple TV unit that will stream media off a Mac in my house.

I may just opt to transcode my existing media library but I'd like to explore both options before I decide on a best solution for me.\nIf I jailbreak and don't like the Plex setup, can I un-jailbreak it and get it back to factory specs? How does one do this?\n\nA: Yes, doing a restore, similar to how one does this on an iOS device, will reset it to the factory default settings and install. \nYou do this by going to Settings -> General -> Reset, and selecting restore. \nIf that doesnt work, you can also plug it into a computer with Micro USB, and use iTunes to restore. \nMore information is available in this Apple KB.\n", "Q: What application can I use to increase fan speed of MacBook Pro under Windows 7?

It also syncs to 3 1st gen Apple TVs. On my Apple TVs, the shows are sorted properly by series name, with the episodes listed when I select a series. However on my iPad (1st Gen, running IOS 5.1), when looking at my shared Library, I see an image for each episode, which when I click it, shows a list of the episodes for that season of the series. I can select and watch an episode from there.\nThe problem is, I have way too many episodes to make this efficient, even to get to the Ds takes a lot of scrolling, and my list is cut off at the Ds.\nI have seen other questions that sort of address this issue, but not quite directly, and none of the answers solve my problem, although they do point me at the meta data for the shows. I have removed artwork from each episode of several series and added the same image to each episode of a series and I still get multiple images for a given season of a series.\nAny suggestions so I can group each series season under one (and only one) image when viewing the shared library on my iPad?\nedit 4/9 07:40 I checked on a 2nd Gen Apple TV, accessing the the same home sharing library, all TV shows were grouped appropriately.\nMost of my TV shows are ripped from DVDs. The ones purchased from iTunes do group correctly, There are a couple of ripped shows that seem to be grouped properly, but I have not yet figured out what is different about them.\n\nA: It's all about the metadata ‚ the track information stored in each media file.\nA while back I had this problem with TV Shows ripped from DVD not displaying correctly, or not in the proper sort order, on my iPad. When I compared the metadata for my home-brewed files with those from files of episodes purchased from the the iTunes store, I discovered some differences. The solution that worked for me was to correct the metadata using the info pane for the media files in iTunes.\nTo get started, open iTunes, select one of the TV episode files that's giving you problems, and press ⌘ + i (or choose Get Info from the file menu).\nStart with the Info tab. Ideally your metadata will look something like this, with obvious differences (unless your file happens to be the same episode of The Big Bang Theory):\n\nNote that the track number corresponds to the episode number\nNot all devices use the Info metadata for sorting though, your next stop is the Video tab:\n\nEpisode ID could also be expressed as S2E8 but I prefer the cleaner, numerical method.\nNext, visit the Options tab to confirm that the Media Type is set to TV Show:\n.\nTo assure consistency, you can select multiple files and edit common fields, such as Album (in the Info tab) or Show (in the Video tab) all at once.\nFinally, it's sometimes useful to make change the criteria that iTunes uses to sort your media. You have guessed by now that the Sorting tab is the key to this operation:\n\nIn the example above, alphabetical sorts by episode will place this episode with the L episodes, not in the T's. This is useful for Movies, shows or bands beginning with The.\nThe laborious process of manually entering  metadata for TV Episodes is the main reason for my using iVI to import DVDs.\n\nA: After a lot of experimenting, I finally found a repeatable procedure that causes the shared library to group correctly on an iPad. Please note, there may be unnecessary steps in this procedure, but it does work. Note also, that this procedure works for iTunes 10.6.1 (7) runiing on Mac OS X Lion (10.7.3) and iPad Videos App in ios 5.1 (9B176) running on a first gen iPad.\nAll steps are done in iTunes on the Mac\n[Credit to Will of Apple Support who walked me through this procedure]\n\n\n*\n\n*Select all the episodes for a given season of a given show.\n\n*Right click or Control Click and choose Get Info. You are now editing metadata for all the selected shows. There are four tabs: Info, Video, Sorting, and Options. \n\n*Fill out the each tab as illustrated, substituting the correct series name and season number as appropriate. Note the checks next to most boxes, even blank ones and those that are pre-populated, these ensure the identical data gets written to each episode.\n\nNote - I populated the artwork by copying an image to the clipboard and pasting in the box. I recommend using an image with the series name clearly visible as the image with Season X underneath it are the only thing displayed when browsing the shared library from an iPad (Series Name is not displayed).\n\n\n\n\n*Click OK\n\n\nA: The key problem I found was entering different info in the Artist or Album Artist info. I had put the director's name of the episodes in there.  While everything else was set up right (Album was the show name, episode ID, # and track # were all correct), I was still getting weird breaks on my iOS device.  I removed the director's names and just entered them in Comments. I left Artist and Album Artist blank. Now I have one list for the show instead of three (from the three different directors).  Kinda sucks to have to use comments, but it seems to work.  \nHope this helps others for such a frustrating problem.\n\nA: After reading these posts and playing trial and error and error I found the solution. It's so simple: fill only one sorting field (I choose the Sort Name (Menu Sorting) and give every movie a unique number (for example starting with 100, 101, etc).\nAnd that numbers are the sorting order at the iPad :-)\n\nA: In order to sort my episodes in order, I had to change the \"sort name\" in every single episode to the corresponding season and episode, ie: 101, 102, 201... \n\nA: All you have to do is in iTunes; select entire TV show (multi-highlight), bring up 'Info' menu on files. Then at the bottom it should say 'Add Field' then add 'Director' field and fill it in with anything. It could be the actual director or whatever you want. Once this has been done, your shows will sort properly in the video app once you reset the app and rejoin your home network.\n", "Q: How can I know whether an app supports the iPad Retina display? In the app store is there any easy, ideally universal way to tell whether an app supports Retina graphics? A great deal of apps have a What's New entry that says \"Added Retina Support\" or \"Support for New iPad\" but as time passes that won't be a good measure.\nI've noticed some apps have lower-res thumbnails (I can only tell by looking) on my Homescreen but the App Store icons tend to look perfectly clear. Of course running the app I can usually immediately see if it's the old resolution, but I'd like to be able to tell before I download (or purchase!) the app.\nHow can I tell if an app is Retina enabled from the app store?\n\nA: Unfortunately there is no way uniformed way to verify iPad Retina Display support. But I wouldn't expect there to be one since Retina and Non Retina iPad applications, from a hardware support standpoint, are identical. Retina Display capable apps will run perfectly fine on the first and second gen iPads. Therefore, there would not be any need for Apple to list this under the requirements section. You're only option is to read the the change log found within the description section of each application. \nI don't think there is any need for you to avoid buying any application simply because it does not support iPad's Retina Display. I would expect any of these apps in question will eventually get the update needed. I would suggesting checking out the last updated date for whichever app you're interested in purchasing. It is always a good sign if the app has been updated recently since it shows active support from the developer. Any app that hasn't been updated in a year is likely one you would want to avoid.\nLastly, a lot of these applications scale wonderfully on the iPad and even if you notice the pixelation from the lacking support of the iPad's Retina Display, that pixelation will be rather minor and hardly ruin the app experience. \n\nA: Many Apps will list if they have support for Retina graphics iPad display.\nIt also show ups in the notes when you update apps. There still are apps designed for iPhone with 2x button which often have sub par user experience.\nA Google Search for \"retina display ipad apps list\" will link to several tech blogs sharing their favorite Retina quality apps.\nUnfortunately search and \"power search\" in Itunes don't work well unless App has retina or \"retina display ready\" listed as keywords in description. \nYou can filter for iPad only  in iTunes power search but there are no options for graphics support filters.\nYou may have better luck using search options on App review websites.\n", "Q: Is there a way to hide a user's home folder from other users seeing that it even exists? I want to hide a user folder from any other users from seeing. The user should still be able to log in through the login window using their username and password.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: You have two options. The first is to use Terminal to set the folder's hidden flag. Open Terminal from /Applications/Utilities and type the following command:\nchflags hidden /Users/SHORTNAME\n\nwhere SHORTNAME is the name of the user's home folder. This will hide the folder from Finder, but other users could still find it, or change Finder's preferences to show hidden folders.\nAlternatively, you could place the home folder for that user in a different location. Open the Users & Groups (or Accounts) pane in System Preferences, click the lock to unlock it, right-click on the user, and choose Advanced Preferences…. Then click the Choose button after Home directory and find a different location (you might want to press Shift+Command+. to show hidden folders for this). Now, the user's home will be in a different place so others will have a harder time finding it.\n", "Q: How to limit my Mac's exposure to malware? With OS X malware increasingly in the news (see the Flashback Trojan issue), is there anything that I should do to increase the security of my Mac and reduce my exposure to malware? \nWhat I'm doing so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*keep up with OS X system patches\n\n*installed an antivirus package and kept up with the associated updates\n\n*separated my regular user login and the admin login\n\n*keep third party software up to date (Firefox, Flash, etc.)\n\n*research, scan, and limit the things I download\n\n*use adblocking and JS block browser extensions\n\n\nIs there more that I could reasonably do to improve my machine's security? Any tips/suggestions for software or security best practices would be appreciated.\n\nA: That is more or less it.  I also like to run potentially unsafe stuff in a VM of some kind (I use Parallels, but for this the free VirtualBox works well enough); Parallels 7 can automatically install a virtual Mac image from the Lion recovery image, which is very convenient for this kind of sandboxing.  (Yes, running Lion in a VM is now legal.)\n\nA: Use common sense. That is the most important thing to do when using any system, any time. I have been using Macs for about ten years. I have never installed any Firewalls or virus scanners, always worked in an admin account full-time, always downloaded and installed all kinds of apps and never have I had ANY problems regarding security.\nMost of the \"malware\" there is out there for Macs aren't even serious viruses, but \"photos\" that suddenly ask for an administrator password, etcetera. You can get as paranoid as you wish with installing all kinds of protecting software, don't dare to download stuff etcetera, but really does that solve anything? I seriously doubt so. Installing security software that annoys you as a user is not the purpose of buying a Mac, that's something that belongs to e.g. Windows Vista.\nThe bottom line of this answer is, again, use your common sense. Think about what you download and install and what you give your admin pass to, but don't get all crazy and overprotect yourself. You can install the best security there is but as long as you keep the door open, this will not help you. Mac OS X has a pretty advanced security system already, installing ten others will not help you. \n\nA: Web browsing\nThe largest potential danger comes from the \"Internet\". My Mac is online most of its operating time and web browsers are among the most used applications on my Mac.\nTherefore, the most important rules are:\n\n*\n\n*surf the web carefully\n\n*don't just download any software you find\n\nBrowser choice\nThe browser choices, configurations and extensions offers various options to configure your security and privacy.\nI like to use Chrome because it's known for having\n\n*\n\n*strict sandboxing\n\n*updates itself, its extensions and flash plug-in automatically\n\n*open extension design\nSafari's extension design is more restricted, causing the JavaScriptBlocker for Safari not to be as functional as similar extensions for Chrome or Firefox: e.g.  Web Bugs are not blocked.\nChrome is considered quite safe.

You won't miss it most of the time:\n\n*\n\n*Safari Preferences → Security → uncheck Enable Java\n\n*Open /Applications/Utilities/Java Preferences.app → uncheck Enable applet plug-in and Web Start applications\nOther options\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences → General →  check Automatically update safe downloads list\n\nOpen Safari downloads manually:\n\n*\n\n*Safari Preferences → General → uncheck Open \"safe\" files after downloading\n\nFlash and PDF viewer\nDownload Adobe flash only from the official website.

Go to /Applications/Utilites/Keychain Access.app →  click the plus at the bottom left → click the key symbol.\n\nAdblock lists\nThe Adblock and Adblock Plus extensions offer lists to improve your privacy and security.\n\n*\n\n*http://adblockplus.org/en/subscriptions\nThe lists are named:\n\n*\n\n*EasyPrivacy: privacy protection\n\n*Malware Domains: malware protection\n\n*Antisocial: blocks social integration.\n\n\nA: The more you change your life to accommodate these \"improvements\" the more it's letting you effect you. Sure you now run a lower risk of contamination by some malware, but your system is crippled by anti virus scans, your passwords are epically long and irritating to type, you don't try as many new applications because ur paranoid, and you cripple your web browsing experience by deactivating java.\nDon't be stupid, have common sense, and just relax a little.\n\nA: Your first point (\"Kept up with OS X system patches\") is probably the most important. If you trace the history of exploits on OS X, most have come from:\n\n\n*\n\n*Java\n\n*Flash\n\n*PDFs\n\n*Safari\n\n*Giving privileges to unknown apps or clicking on unknown links\n\n\nI'm not a security expert, but it seems like limiting your exposure to those things will decrease your exposure significantly.\nJava\nJava shouldn't be installed if you don't need it, and should only be turned on for the time you use it, if you do need it.\nFlash\nThe same is true for Flash. If Safari is your browser of choice, then grab Chrome and Switch to open pages with Flash in Chrome (and only the pages that require Flash). Chrome has a sandbox for Flash and is considered quite safe.\nPDFs\nApplying Apple's patches should (eventually) save you from any PDF exploits. Using OS X's Preview to view PDFs rather than Adobe Acrobat is a good idea, too.\nSafari\nKeeping your browser up to date and limiting the amount of extensions you use is a good idea. Safari has an \"Open safe files after downloading\" option. If you're tuning for security, that's best turned off. Safari also includes malware detection. The latest Chrome and Firefox also make good browser choices.\nGiving privileges to unknown apps or clicking on unknown links\nBeing super careful with links you click on and apps that ask for admin privileges also helps stop trojans and malware from doing bad things. If a service has sent you an email notification about something you need to take action on, you may be better visiting the site using your own bookmarks and not by clicking a link if the email, if you're suspicious of the email's origin.\nMany different and long passwords\nUsing something like 1Password to generate and store your passwords can help, because it means you have a different password for each service, and they can be a huge string of seemingly random letters and numbers. Here's one I just generated as an example: lyLEnrFDnoDoBoS90PJZ. Doing so also means you can ensure your main computer (and 1Password) passwords are never used for websites or web services.\nLong passwords take a long time to hack for brute force attacks. And using different passwords for everything means that one compromised service won't give the attacker your password for other services.\nThere's quite a few alternatives to 1Password, including OS X's in-built keychain (which is free with OS X).\nFollow Mac tech blogs\nIf all else fails, and there's some kind of exploit that you're vulnerable to, you'll want to find out as soon as possible. Chances are it'll be big tech news, so following a few popular Mac tech sites should notify you within a day or so of the issue and you can take the needed action. The recent Flashback trojan has been big news. I found out about it because I follow Daring Fireball and Macworld. (It uses a Java exploit, so disabling or not installing Java would have saved you in that case.)\n\nA: \n… installed an antivirus package …  JS block browser extensions …\n\nHTTP data stream\nIf you find a reputable anti-malware product with a scanning engine that has access to the HTTP data stream, then you might take a less strict approach to blocking JavaScript. \nAvailability\nWhether such a product exists for OS X, I don't know. \nMy current guess is that enterprise-oriented solutions will be easier to find than a platform-specific consumer-oriented solution. \nBackground\nMalware, but only for a second in a day | Naked Security (2009-11-16):\n\n\n\n\n… any scanning engine which has access to the HTTP data stream should be able to cope since it has all the relevant contextual data required at the time of rendering.\nBrute-forcing aside, the only real way to tackle this problem is to use \"Just in time\" detection (otherwise known as on-access) …\n\n\n\n\nIn response to a microblog post, SophosLabs wrote: \n\n\n\n… on access scans only scans files on-disk, not network traffic to the browser. \n\n\n\nDetecting 'web bugs' — without scanning network traffic to the browser?

I am thinking about retiring my portable for an iPad + keyboard. (With Amazon/Linode/etc as server.)\nI tried the iSSH app and ran Emacs in a terminal (not X Windows), using the Apple external keyboard.\nThis is unusable. Some extra chars are generated with control-F and option for Meta (Escape) generates some extra characters. There are probably other problems.\nTerminal programs can't just remove/add/modify stuff as they like! Especially not for Emacs!\nThis problem was discussed already at the iPad launch.\nThe specifics for iSSH was discussed at least last November. (A fix was promised for the next release, which was in March.)\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/issh/browse_thread/thread/b58508bb42a3241e?pli=1\nI saw in other discussions a few months ago that the \"Prompt\" app should work better, but that it had other problems? It was updated a few weeks ago.\nAny advice on how to make this work? Prompt?\n\nEdit, a conclusion:\nI have checked Prompt now. It doesn't have programmable keys and no way to get the Alt X to send real ESC X. I'll see what chars are generated by the keyboard and if I can put that into Emacs.\nSo iSSH has programmable keys (and lots of other features) except for control keys, but no working Control. And Prompt has working Control keys but no possibility to set up keys. The union of them would be perfect. :-(\nAt least both applications are under active development, so this should show up.\n\nA: Prompt is generally considered to be the best (or at least among the best) SSH clients for iOS. I've never used it specifically for emacs (as I don't use emacs) but I've never seen it send strange extra characters, even when sending control characters to, say, nano.\nEdit: Prompt version 1.3.2 now has a feature where you can use the Escape key as a Meta key.\n\nA: I have also started using Emacs via SSH from my iPad with an external Bluetooth keyboard. I'm using Prompt and I've come up with the following code to \"re-enable\" the Option key as Meta. most of the keys work except for B, E, I, N, U and `. Put this in your .emacs file.

I would like my bit torrent client to continue sharing data even after my session times out and goes to the login screen.

The other user will be able to use the Mac, while your program still runs.\n\nA: I don't think it's possible on OSX.\nBetter way is use transmission-daemon on Linux machine.\nAnd then using remote gui clients (osx/win/linux/android/www) to manage your torrents.\n\nA: It isn't possible, but why a logout?

We're in a process right now to register 100+ company-issued iPhones. Right now the process of creating an Apple ID for each iPhone to be used for Find my iPhone is very time consuming, so my manager is assuming we can use just one account to manage it all. He wants to know if this is possible, or how many iPhones can be registered with Find my iPhone using only one account.\n\nA: I don't think there is any enforced limit for using one account on lots of devices if all you care to do is use Find My Phone. You will run into the 10 device limit if you try to install apps using this ID, but just entering it into iCloud and only turning on FMP (FMi / FMiP ??!) should scale past the limits people normally reach when using one ID for multiple devices.\nEven if you get away with this, your users might get confused or wish to use Find My.../iCloud themselves and find you have locked their device\nYou might want to reach out to your Apple account rep to avoid running into several anti-fraud efforts that prevent this sort of mass scale deployment if you try to use one Apple ID for say the App Store on so many devices. In addition to that specifically being against the licensing terms, you will face delays if and when this account gets locked, so plan to test things out with a small group (say 3-8 devices sharing one ID) as a pilot before you decide how to manage all 100 devices.\nThere are quite a few MDM packages available, but without knowing your specific situation, it will be hard for you to determine if automating some of the management will be a good investment or if you can just use the Apple Configurator to set up your deices and depend on the end users to manage their Apple ID/iCloud accounts and not mess with your one set up to track all the devices.\n\nA: 1 Apple ID can only associate up to 10 devices. And according to this thread from Apple support, you should be able to\n\ntrack multiple devices all connected to the same account on the same map\n\n\nA: Take a look at http://www.meraki.com/products/systems-manager/.

I'm considering buying a used MacBook (mid 2007 model) with 2GB of RAM and Mac OS X Lion. I am going to use this as a secondary computer to learn iOS development and to become more familiar with Mac OS X in general. Will this hardware be usable as a secondary machine, or is a 2007 model to slow to run Xcode and Lion?\n\nA: It might be a bit slow. I am using an early 2009 MacBook with 4GB of RAM, and the performance of Lion wasn't as smooth as Snow Leopard. \nFor the record, I am also running Xcode. It runs OK, not exactly smooth. So I think your experience on 2GB RAM might not be too pleasant. \n\nA: I would advise not to buy such machine.\nhere is my reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure that, at least, it has a Intel Core 2 Duo. If it does not have that (or any of the brand new i3, i5 and i7 CPUs) you will never be able to update the OS to anything bigger than 10.7 (Lion).\n\n*2 GB of RAM is really the standard for Xcode, I have 4GB and I wish I could have 8, but, once again, 4GB is the maximum you will probably can have.\n\n*With the price of that laptop, you could buy the new Mac mini and will have everything needed for work with Xcode, plus, in the future, it's a very upgradable machine (you can have 2 Hard drives, up to 8GB of RAM, Thunderbolt, all brand new OS).\n\n\nThe inability to upgrade should be a stopper right on spot, for example, with 10.6 (Snow Leopard) you can only have Xcode 4.2 installed, and Xcode is already at 4.3 (4.4 in beta) and moving up. I strongly expect that you will have the same problem once in Lion.\n\nA: I have a mid-2007 MacBook (2.16 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo) with 2GB RAM (which is the max. supported) running Lion and Xcode. It was getting a little sluggish but I recently replaced the HD with a SSD. I choose a OCZ Vertex 2 120GB (SATA II) drive, which cost around £100, and it's made a huge difference.

I'm having a weird problem and hope somebody can tip me, what way should I dig to.\nI'm using MacBookPro with Lion 10.7.3 both at my working place & at home. \nAt working place, we have a domain-based network with 802.1x authorization (more than 400 computers) and to connect it I'm using Ethernet cable. IP range is 10.10.2.*. All network settings are setup automatically by DHCP. Also, in settings, I have Network Account Server setup in the User&Groups Settings for my work Domain server - and it is available only from corporate network.\nAt home, I have an ADSL router, that shares Internet connection by WiFi in NAT mode. I'm using WiFi to connect it. Router gives out addresses from 192.168.1.* range and all settings are also set up  by router's DHCP.\nSo, my problem is the following. When I come back home from the office, I open my MacBook and AirPort automatically connects my WiFi network. After this, for about 1 minute I'm able to browse sites & ping hosts successfully. But after this minute, network connection is broken down. All pings return time-out. trace route to google.com stops on 192.168.1.1 (which is my router). This lasts for 3-4 minutes. After that network connection is automatically repaired and all pings go smoothly again. At the same time, when my MacBook return timeouts, I can successfully ping any host from my wife's MacBook - so this doesn't look like router issue.

If the DHCP server returns DHCPNAK, the interface becomes unconfigured while it properly negotiates a new address, at which point the interface is brought back up.\nTheoretically (although probably not in practice on a small home network) your computer could have the same address as another computer on the network during that initial speculative phase.\n\nA: Update: It wasn't the VPN client causing this, but after lengthy troubleshooting (see comments) it turned out to be Skype, possibly due to UPnP related bugs.\n\nTry disabling your Cisco AnyConnect(?)

I'm rather confused about the 'proper' way to use Photo Stream and an iPhone and iPhoto.\nHere's how I use iPhoto and my iPhone: (This workflow was as far as I can tell the correct way to operate before iCloud)\n\n\n*\n\n*Getting photos into iPhoto:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take photos on iPhone.\n\n*Every so often connect the phone to my mac and in iPhoto import any photos and videos from the phone's  camera roll into iPhoto (deleting those photos from the camera roll once they are imported.) \n\n*This means that iPhoto is the canonical store for my photos - the camera roll on the phone was just a temporary store until i could get them into iPhoto.\n\n\n*To get photos from iPhoto onto my iOS device:\n\n\n*\n\n*in iTunes, select the device and in the Photos tab of the settings choose 'Sync photos from iPhoto' - only including events from the last two years (for limited phone storage reasons.)\n\n\n\nThis worked well until iCloud came about - now with photo stream every time I import into iPhoto it warns me of duplicates as the photos already exist in monthly photo stream events.  I end up with both monthly photo stream events and 'real' events which are groups of photos taken on the same day.\nSo - what is the correct workflow now that photo stream exists?\nDo I not ever import from my iOS devices into iPhoto and just allow photo stream to do its stuff?\nIf so\n\n\n*\n\n*Do I just let the camera roll on my iPhone get bigger and bigger and never empty it?  This seems wasteful as there would be duplication of photos between the camera roll and the photo stream events.\n\n*How do I import videos from the iOS devices?\nOr is there a more correct workflow?\nWhat strategies do you use?\nThanks\n\nA: Photostream will store the previous 30 days worth of photos automatically. That means, every photo you take on your iOS devices will be sent to Photostream, but only the last 30 days worth of photos will be available there.\nIf you enable 'Automatic Import' of Photostream in iPhoto (Preferences > Photostream > Automatic Import) then when you launch iPhoto, it will automatically download a copy of any photos that are in your Photostream, and automatically create an Event titled: {MMM YYYY} Photo Stream (eg. \"Jul 2012 Photo Stream\")\nThis Event will be automatically kept up to date, as long as iPhoto is open long enough to sync everything required (depends on your connection).\nIn effect, as long as you open iPhoto once every 30 days and leave it open long enough for your Photostream to be imported, you should never have to manually import a photo from your iOS device at all.\nAs for removing items from your Camera Roll on your iOS device, as long as you see that they are present in Photostream (or in iPhoto), then it is safe to delete them from your device. (There is no way around this but to do it manually as far as I know.)\nCurrently, Photostream does not support videos. To import videos, connect your iOS device to iPhoto and import these manually.\nAs a side note, in order to keep some photos on the device, you can create a smart album in iPhoto along the lines of \"Photos taken within the last 30 days\" or \"Photos rated 4 stars or more\", and configure iTunes to sync these to your device. That way, you can be sure that no matter if you clear your Camera Roll on your device, or delete certain photos, you maintain some convenience.\n\nA: It turns out that my copy of iPhoto was not behaving properly - it should ignore photos already imported by photo stream when you connect an iOS device.  \nI managed to get it to work correctly again by resetting photo stream from iCloud.com and turning photo stream off and on again in iPhoto and all my iOS devices.  \n\nA: I know everyone has been finding a culmination of solutions to be helpful...my chosen course which I will hope meet with great success is as follows -\n\n\n*\n\n*Import all existing photos from my iDevices into iPhoto.\n\n*Turn off 'Automatic Import' in iPhoto under (Preferences > Photo Stream).\n\n*Turn off 'Keep Normal Photo' in my iDevices under (Settings > Photos & Camera)\n\n\nUnder this method, my workflow will be to manually import my photo roll into iPhoto (ensuring I will get my videos as well), when I choose to.  It also enables me to use features such as split events native to iPhoto.  I still have access to all my photo stream photos on all my iDevices and thru the Shared > iCloud link in iPhoto.  I should be covered this way if a device is lost so I don't lose those pics in my camera roll.\nNow if Apple would just allow me to take a pic on a failed login attempt.  Between that and an iCloud location, the police might actually be able to recover the device.  That would be if the police in your particular area care about such recover....Hartford, CT police just want to give you a case # and don't care if you can see it online.  Their response was go find it then.\n\nA: As far as I know, the Photo Stream storage is different from the Camera Roll. Photo Stream stores the pictures in the cloud. And I think once it's pushed to the cloud, even if you delete the item in the Camera roll it will not be deleted from the stream. I'm not really sure about this though.\nI kind of follow your original workflow myself, so if you're used to this you can turn off the Photo Stream with no problem.\nI'll wait for a better answer myself, since I want to know some strategies about using the Photo Stream too.\n", "Q: How do I change the output power on the OS X internet sharing wifi network? I'm on 10.7, and I want to alter the broadcast power (so my wifi network doesn't extend beyond 10 ft radius or so). Also, if there's a way to change the security to WPA, which windows 7 can do, I'd like to know.\n\nA: I'm not aware of a good way to modify the radio broadcast power level on the built-in card on a Mac.  However, you may find that setting up a shared internet connection using bluetooth achieves your goal of limiting the range.\nRegarding your second question, there have been previous inquiries about changing the WiFi encryption protocol on Mac Ad-Hoc networks from WEP with no results.\n", "Q: Find my iPhone without full internet access My company is running a fleet 200-ish iOS devices which are assigned to managers and executives.\nWe heavily rely on Find my iPhone/iPad to, well, find lost devices when needed.\nOur network spans more than 150 offices around the country and some of them don't have (or can't have) internet access so that the device can communicate freely with the service.\nIs there any way of routing the service through the company headquarters (all offices are P2P connected to HQ and HQ has unrestricted access to the service) so that we don't have to open offices to the internet?\nThanks in advance!\nEdit:\nI forgot to mention that the network on each of the offices is automatically routed to HQ, so there's no need for VPN in that case.\nWhat I'm asking is how can it be possibly configured so that an internal service exchanges traffic between iCloud and the devices.\n\nA: There are solutions for this.  A good number of our clients use a Junos VPN portal for telecommuting associates.  Meanwhile, Junos provides a free iOS VPN client that integrates very nicely with the on-device OS.  Though I'm not aware of other VPN products (it's not my side of the business) I'm reasonably certain there are other products with similar functionality.\nMy solution would be to set up the VPN, then allow a specific rule to go back out to the iCloud service.  If you're dead-set on using iCloud to monitor location, that's probably your best option.  Apple Configurator does not currently allow for supervising a device's location, but I wouldn't be surprised if they added it for supervised devices in the future.\nAnother alternative would be to check out the available documentation from Apple to see if there's a specific feature for your use-case.\n", "Q: With which carriers can I use an officially-unlocked iPhone? Recently AT&T has begun officially unlocking iPhones which are out of contract.\nBut I know this doesn't mean that all carriers are supported, because some carriers use different frequency bands and simply aren't compatible with iPhones. After this official unlocking process, which carriers can be used with which models of iPhone devices?\n\nA: You will find an up to date list of carriers and frequencies on this list for the United States. For other countries see here.\nYou can use your iPhones as follows (source):\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone Quad band GSM/GPRS/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz)\n\n*iPhone 3G In addition to previous: Tri-band 3.6 Mbit/s UMTS/HSDPA (850, 1900, 2100 MHz)\n\n*iPhone 3GS In addition to previous: 7.2 Mbit/s HSDPA\n\n*iPhone 4 quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE (800 850 900 1800 1900 MHz).

The half-size arrow keys on my MacBook are a little small for me. The keys I'd prefer to use are:\n\n\n*\n\n*fn +  J  to move left\n\n*fn +  K  to move down\n\n*fn +  L  to move right\n\n*fn +  I  to move up\nI badly want to use the \"fn\" key for this, both for ergonomic and practical reasons (ie: avoid conflicts with other apps).\nIs this possible? How?\n\nA: I installed a third party utility to remap these keys on my MacBook Pro running OS X 10.8. Here are the steps I used: \n(1) Download and install KeyRemap4MacBook.app\n(2) Edit (or create) the following file in a text editor:\n~/Library/Application Support/KeyRemap4MacBook/private.xml\n\n...so that its content is:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n<item>\n        <name>JKLI to Arrow Keys</name>\n        <identifier>private.jkli_to_arrow_keys</identifier>\n        <autogen>\n            __KeyToKey__\n            KeyCode::J, ModifierFlag::FN,\n            KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT\n        </autogen>\n        <autogen>\n        __KeyToKey__\n            KeyCode::K, ModifierFlag::FN,\n            KeyCode::CURSOR_DOWN\n        </autogen>\n        <autogen>\n        __KeyToKey__\n            KeyCode::L, ModifierFlag::FN,\n            KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT\n        </autogen>\n        <autogen>\n        __KeyToKey__\n            KeyCode::I, ModifierFlag::FN,\n            KeyCode::CURSOR_UP\n        </autogen>\n</item>\n</root>\n\n(3) Select \"Preferences\" from the little KeyRemap4MacBook icon in the OS X MenuBar at the top of the screen.\n\n(4) In KeyRemap4MacBook's \"Change Key\" tab, tick \"JKLI to Arrow Keys\". (if this option doesn't appear, you may need to click the \"ReloadXML\" button)\n\nYou should now be able to use the Function key with J|K|L|I to control the cursor, in addition to the Arrow keys.\n\nA: You are correct.  Although Mac OS X allows you to remap the control, caps lock, option, and command keys, the fn key is not included.  To do this, you'll need to use 3rd-party software such as DoubleCommand.  That will let you remap the fn key to the control key.  \nFrom there, you should check out additional software to remap the control+J key etc. to emulate the left key etc. So long as you can emulate ctrl, you should be able to create the keybinding in ~/Library/KeyBindings. You might be able to do this last step in DoubleCommand as well.\n\nA: This is possible on macOS Catalina without any extra software by using System preferences -> Keyboard.\nHit the Modifier button, and you can now change the behaviour of your fn key to Caps Lock, Ctrl, Option, Command or Esc.\nInterestingly, you cannot so easily modify any of those keys to act as the fn key.\n", "Q: GCC not found, but Xcode is installed I have Xcode installed, but when I type gcc in terminal I get \"command not found\".

My magic trackpad seems to have gotten dirty in the button.\nI've tried swabbing around the button with alcohol but I still, at times, have to lift the trackpad to release the mouse click.\nDo you have any clever ways of cleaning it? \n\nA: My Magic Trackpad 1 also lost its ability to unclick and I had to lift it up to get it to release. I tried various cleaning fixes but none worked for me. It seemed that there was no spring-back action left in the magicpad. I use the pad a lot in photoshop with lots of clicking and dragging so I guessed the spring had finally just worn out. However I found a solution on this website.\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Magic+Trackpad+Click+Adjustment/6171 \nIt was more than I wanted to try, but I really need my magic pad to work as I had a big project on the go. The fix works well and I added little adjustment to the procedure. In step 3 where the adjustment screw is pointed out in the photo, the bar it is set in is also the spring that provides the un-clicking action of the pad. I gave the whole bar a gentle pull upwards, away from the pad, this put some spring back into the trackpad. The Magic trackpad now works perfectly again.\nI also used 2 rubber self-sticking bumpers to replace the feet. These bumpers are often used on the back of picture frames to protect walls or under trays to to prevent scratching tables. The size I got were 8mil and fit perfectly. The added advantage to putting them on first is than you fine tune the screw adjustments you make to the trackpad before replacing the white back to the trackpad. This video shows put the bumpers on. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmO_G7Ct9k8\nFinal word of advice, gently warm the white back of the trackpad before removing it. A hair dryer works well and I just laid mine in the sun for awhile.\n\nA: Try some Goo-B-Gone or other citrus based cleaning fluid.\n\nA: I used an old, clean toothbrush and it worked perfect. I used a tiny bit of water, but I am sure it would work without that (in reflection i would try it first WITHOUT WATER as to not risk damage of the computer parts). I just flipped over the trackpad, pushed the button in and worked the toothbrush bristles into the seam all around it. I instantly could feel the button not sticking. \n\nA: You need:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 or 2 cotton buds\n\n*Isopropyl alcohol (IPA)\n\n\nWhat you need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put some Isopropyl alcohol on the end of the cotton bud.\n\n*Rub the alcohol onto the offending button, being careful not to allow alcohol to enter into the case.\n\n\nThis worked for me, so I hope it will work for you!\n\nA: If your track pad is sticking means the click isn't released when your finger is lifted. Then all that I had to do is clean the bottom of the trackpad (with rubbing alcohol)!  Those are basically buttons which allow you to put even pressure to click. When the surface is dirty, the pressure is uneven.  Also clean the surface of the trackpad while you're at it. \n", "Q: On how many devices with the same iTunes account can you share an app? I'm aware that you can sync an iPad with up to 3 different computers, but if you have multiple iPad devices with the same iTunes account, how many devices can you sync an app to?\n\nA: As far as I know, there isn't a limit.

There are numerous syncing tools available, but when you have multiple sync services interacting with each other (in this case: iCloud, middle man service & Exchange are each their own sync service) you dramatically increase the chance of serious sync corruptions.\nAs your goal is to see all of your calendars everywhere, I recommend setting up both services on all of your devices. You will want to use the following apps, depending on platform, for an ideal experience and visibility to both calendars:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac: use Apple Calendar (formerly, iCal). See this guide for setting up both account types.\n\n*PC: use Outlook. See this guide for setting up iCloud in Outlook.

Here are the details from the Apple support article:\n\nThis Java security update removes the most common variants of the Flashback malware.\n\nJava for OS X Lion 2012-003\nFrom the Lion update:\n\nThis Java security update removes the most common variants of the Flashback malware.\nThis update also configures the Java web plug-in to disable the automatic execution of Java applets. Users may re-enable automatic execution of Java applets using the Java Preferences application. If the Java web plug-in detects that no applets have been run for an extended period of time it will again disable Java applets.\n\nHere is an Apple support article about the security content of the Java updates.\n\nA: Quick one-liner to paste into Terminal.app:\ndefaults read /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Info LSEnvironment &> /dev/null && echo \"You seem to have Type 1\"; defaults read ~/.MacOSX/environment DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES &> /dev/null && echo \"You seem to have Type 2\"\n\nUnless this outputs anything, you're clean (at least of the known types).

So then I just decided to rent it straight on the Apple TV (3rd gen) and I had 2 free rentals from a previous problem, the rental on the MacBook used the first credit, and bizarrely the rental on the Apple TV used the 2nd, so I guess I would have been charged twice.\nBut now, after all that, it says ready to play in 8 hours 40 minutes. Which is quite unacceptable. When I was renting on my Macbook the total download time was around 8 hours. But I could start playing after about 15 minutes and it would download in the background.\nDoes the Apple TV not allow buffering, and require the whole movie to download before it allows you to start playing?\nI'm really hoping I've missed something, because I'm beginning to wish I'd bought a Media Center PC.\n\nA: Apple TV only does buffering, there's no hard drive to save stuff onto. It does not have to download the entire thing, but if your connection is really slow, it will have to buffer a ton more in order for it to play. It's not perfect, but it is pretty good at guessing how much to download before it starts.\n\nA: Do you have any special DNS settings configured on the AppleTV? Sometimes services such as GoogleDNS and OpenDNS can cause problems interacting with the iTunes store.\n", "Q: Can I log employees' working hours through Bonjour availability? We have a small office network with a Mac server, and all employees have their own Mac laptop they take home at the end of the day.\nI am looking for a way to automatically log the employees' time at the office. Theoretically, it should be possible to periodically check for other auto-discovered Bonjour hosts on the network and deduce their time at the office from there.\nNow my question is, is there an app or other readily available solution for that?\nEDIT:\nI should note that the users don't actually log in to the network nor log out. Their computers are not part of an Open Directory. I also really don't want to install or access anything on their computer directly.\nI want to log their presence purely based on listening for their network presence. I also don't want to manually manage a list of computers, computers should be tracked automatically once they are discovered on the network.\nAt the end of the week/month I want to be able to get a list of all connected computer names during that period, with the time periods they were connected. Some graphical representation similar to day-view in iCal would be perfect, but if I have this information textual I could always implement that part myself.\nEDIT 2:\nI've been doing some research myself and found out about the dns-sd tool. For example:\ndns-sd -B _afpovertcp._tcp local\n\nlists all computers with AFP enabled.\nHowever, two problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*the dns-sd utility from the command-line is not well suited for scripts, the man page recommends against it, the command also doesn't terminate itself\n\n*The above example does not work when AFP file sharing is disabled\n\n\nA: It looks like you want something like NetSpy or ActyMac to monitor employee activity. It will handle what you want and more, although I'm not sure I would suggest the orwelian approach to employee management. \nYou may want to look into a pure network monitoring tool like Paessler.\nThe easiest solution would be for you to just monitor the server log on your OS X server for the time the user logs-in and logs out. A simple script that tracks the time and totals them into a spreadsheet using a nightly cron job. \nYou can also just use the last command as seen in the screenshot aslong as the file has not be cleared.\n\nYou may want to try other basic unix system logging scripts.\n\nA: You may want to look into a network monitoring tool like Motadata\n", "Q: Dual Thunderbolt displays with a Mac running Windows under Boot Camp? Is it possible, on a brand new MacBook Pro, to use two external Thunderbolt displays under Windows booted from Boot Camp?\nI found this KB article, which says no. I also found this thread, where there's a hint that booting first to OS X then to Windows can work, but it's from late 2011. Have the drivers or firmware been updated to allow this more easily?\n\nA: Unfortunately, as of now, you are unable to (I'm assuming that this is what you mean) daisy-chain two or more Thunderbolt displays (natively) into your Mac. I'm unsure if it's Apple to blame, Microsoft, or both. Wait until Windows PCs start receiving Thunderbolt (Microsoft should update the drivers by then) and try again. If that's not it, then it's probably Apple's fault and there is nothing that you can do now until Apple updates the Boot Camp drivers so that it can support this.\n", "Q: Open XML support in Pages It looks like iWork's Pages supports Open XML - however, I can't find any good information on this on either developer.apple.com or on the web. Is there a good resource for this that I'm not aware of? I see http://openxmldeveloper.org but this is clearly MS-specific. Is there a comparable resource for Pages?\nI'd like a trivial example of how this would work such as a \"Hello World\" type document. Does this exist?\n\nA: Office Open XML is a standard invented by Microsoft - their documentation would be the go-to resource. Pages simply uses the built-in OS X ability to read them. TextEdit can read OOXML (i.e. .docx) as well, and is included (with source) with Apple's developer tools as a sample.\n", "Q: How do I use my Airport express to connect an AV receiver that requires ethernet? I set up the airport express(AX) in airport utility and I have it extending my network from my airport extreme. Shows connected and everything but when I plug in my AV receiver it does not get the signal. Furthermore when I connect my macbook to the AX via ethernet cable and assign the network to ethernet it does not connect to the internet? My question is how to I configure the AX so that I can receive the wireless signal from my airport extreme and convert it to ethernet connectivity?  Thanks for your help!!\n\nA: From the Apple Support Airport Express FAQ:\n\nQuestion: Since AirPort Express only has one Ethernet port, does it act as a LAN port, WAN port, or both?\nAnswer: Depending on how you have it set up, the Ethernet port can function as a LAN port (defined as either simple bridging or sharing\n  your Internet connection via network address translation) or a WAN\n  port (connecting to your broadband Internet service provider or\n  upstream router). However, it never acts as both simultaneously.\n  By default the AirPort Express Ethernet port acts as a WAN port.\n  When it is set up as a secondary extended Wi-Fi base station, it can act as a LAN port. Assuming that your Internet service provider only\n  gives you one IP address (the most common scenario for homes), this\n  means that AirPort Express can only accommodate wired clients when\n  acting as an extender or bridge. Therefore, if you need to support\n  wired clients and only want to get one base station (or router, as\n  it's the routing capacity of AirPort Express that is relevant here),\n  you should get the AirPort Extreme Base Station or Time Capsule instead.\n\nAccording to an answer to a question on an Apple Store page:\n\nYes, certainly. Connect Ethernet cable from the Express to your\n  non-wireless computer which meets the above listed \"System\n  Requirements\" and use AirPort Utility to direct the Express to \"join\"\n  your wireless network from the list which will show on the popup\n  presented to you. The Express will then function as a wireless adapter\n  (receiving signals) for your computer, but in that configuration it\n  will not extend the wireless network to other devices.\n\nYou can accomplish this task via the Airport Utility. In one Apple discussion forum discussion, a user (Bob Timmons) notes that:\n\nnew AirPort Express 802.11n can be configured to \"extend a wireless\n  network\". That is a much simpler setup with much higher performance\n  than WDS can offer.\n\nYou'll need to use Apple's Airport Utility to set up your Airport Express. Two approaches that you can take are WDS or Extended wireless network, as noted in this Apple Support KB. \n", "Q: Why does my MacBook Air occasionally become extremely dim after being idle? Sometimes, I leave my MacBook Air on for thirty minutes. When I return, and move my mouse around, I see the cursor on the screen moving around, but the screen is extremely dim. In fact, I could barely recognize that the computer was on. I could still click on icons and interact with windows though.\nWhy did that happen?\n\nA: With the information provided my Initial impression points to your \"Energy Saver\" preferences where the \"Automatically reduce brightness before going to sleep\" option is enabled. The dimming not occurring before 30 mins is likely due to the \"Computer Sleep\" settings your MacBook Air is set to.\n", "Q: How can I play MTS videos from my Sony camera on my Mac? My family has used a Sony Cyber-Shot camera for several years. A few months ago, we replaced it with a newer model Cyber-Shot. To our dismay, however, the videos the camera records are not in the old familiar \".mov\" format, but rather are in some strange \".mts\" format that does not open when we double it.\nIs there a way to enable iMovie, iPhoto, QuickTime, etc., to play said video files (and copy them from the camera automatically, as happened with my previous Cyber-Shot?\n\nA: I use ClipWrap to rewrap the .mts file. then it can play without any problem.\n\nA: Though Quicktime does not (and I couldn't find a codec plugin to support it), VLC apparently plays AVCHD video files (.mts).  There is also a way to use VLC to transcode any video it can play to another format.\n\nA: As of iPhoto 9.3, iPhoto now supports AVCHD. So the officially sanctioned way to add such support for iPhoto now seems to be to install version 9.3.\n\nA: There's a QuickTime plugin from Panasonic:\n\nAVCCAM Importer\nQuickTime Plug-in component\nThe AVCCAM Importer QuickTime plug-in component is to enable direct editing of AVCHD \".mts\" file (*1) without conversion.\nAVCHD clips recorded on a Panasonic AVCCAM lineup product can be handled directly in QuickTime Player and Final Cut Pro.\n\n\nA: The answer to your question is no, there is no way to get iMovie, iPhoto or Quicktime to recognize the .mts format. However, you can import the video files and then convert them into something the iLife apps will recognize. (.mov, mp4 etc.)\nI use Handbrake for this.  It is free, and you can queue up videos if you have a lot letting it convert away in the background. \nThis is a blog post about converting .mts videos using Handbrake:\n\nYou can queue up a bunch of files and choose a format to convert them too. I found converting to the preset Apple TV settings works pretty well for importing into iMovie.\n\n\nA: PlayMemories Home is the free Sony software that let save your clips  as .mts and .mp4 formats. It is easy and friendly to use.\nThat way you can upload the clips directly to Youtube or edit them with Adobe Premiere PRO.\n\nA: Spent the weekend importing years of .mts Sony cam footage into iPhoto/iCloud. Here are my conclusions:\nGood Free: ‎AVCHD to Mov Lite on the Mac App Store\n\n*\n\n*recommended across the internet\n\n*VERY dated interface, hasn't been updated in years\n\n*default rewrap standardizes framerate to 60fps. Couldn't figure out how to change\n\n*Rewrap with passthrough of both video/audio wouldn't run/error. Default rewrap will passthrough video and convert audio to AAC.\n\nBetter Paid: EditReady 2\n\n*\n\n*free trial allows rewrap/conversion of the first minute of video\n\n*custom settings allow you to passthrough both video/audio. Zero conversion, will be the original file in Apple friendly container\n\nBest and Future - HEVC (macOS included software)\n\n*\n\n*Right Click file ⇨ Encode Selected Video Files (macOS 11.x) ⇨ select your settings\n\n*file is 1/2 to 1/3 the size.

I need to manually sleep the system on a regular basis. I want a way to configure Internet Sharing to stop preventing sleep.\n\nI have an iMac at home in my bedroom too far away from my router, and I can't use wireless, also, 3G coverage here is awful, so I've enabled Internet Sharing so I can use my iPhone/iPad connected trough my iMac.\nAt work I am on a corporate network and wireless is somewhat lame and too restrictive, so I've enabled Internet Sharing on my MacBook Pro there too, so my iPhone can reach internal stuff.\nThe problem is: When I hit ⌘+⌥+⏏ (or  > Sleep) neither computer goes to sleep as desired; that is unless I disable Internet Sharing first.\nAt home I want the computer to sleep while I sleep (saves power + more silence) and at work when going home I want it to sleep too, so I don't have to close all connected apps (Adium, Colloquy, etc) and reopen again the next day.\nHow can I configure pmset or Internet Sharing so I can sleep my computer without running into this problem?\nNote: I've already used pmset to check if there were other reasons and the offending pid is always com.apple.InternetSharing.\nEdit: I realize that sleeping the computer will make it impossible to use Internet Sharing. I want it to sleep completely and I want Internet Sharing to be on again only when the computer awakes.\n\nA: I have experimented with using ControlPlane to achieve what you want.  My preliminary result is that it will do what you want.\nControlPlane detects changes to your system called 'evidence sources'.  Changes are evaluated with 'rules' which define a change in 'context'.  Associated with each context are 'actions'.\nOne of the 'evidence sources' is a sleep/wake event.  So I have configured a rule so that on a sleep event (e.g. you have clicked sleep in the Apple menu), the context 'Sleepy Time' is triggered.  And for this context I have used the action 'ToggleInternetSharing' to off.\nAfter clicking on Sleep, I get an alert saying that Internet Sharing is being turned off and after a little while (seems like forever but is probably only 10 or 20 seconds) the Mac goes to sleep.\nAnd I have a second rule so that on a wake event the context 'Waking Up' is triggered and this has the action to set 'ToggleInternetSharing' on.\nMy Rules and Actions:\n\n\nTry it!\nThis is just scratching the surface of what ControlPlane can do.\n\nA: If you are running Lion,\nInternetSharing is explicitely locking the SystemSleep.\nHave a look at:\nstrings /usr/libexec/InternetSharing | grep SystemSleep\n\nThe output of this command:\n    DenySystemSleep\nis the proof that InternetSharing is\npurposefully blocking the kernel possibility to go to sleep.\nThere is a simple explanation to this protection:\nonce InternetSharing is fired, clients of this Mac may be using it\nas a router to access the Internet. A lot of thing may be automatically\nrunning on top of this Internet connexion without any knowledge of the\nperson in front of the screen.\nThis connexion should only be broken by the admin of the system who\nstarted it and not any automatic system behaviour.\nThis is a safe behaviour.\nHence the correct method to ensure InternetSharing is off when the Mac\nsleep is to schedule 4 events in the following order:\nInternetSharing off\n    system sleep\n    system wakeup\nInternetSharing on\n\nThis is the scheduling offered by ControlPlane.\n\nA: It is not practical to have a Mac with Internet Sharing enabled be able to go to sleep.\nThe Internet Sharing feature is the software version of a router: It acts as a gateway to the internet, a DHCP server, a firewall, and a DNS forwarder.  It's functions just like the routers you can buy from your local retailer; and it's free.\nHowever, there’s a massive downside: If the Mac that acts as the gateway is turned off or asleep, then the other machines can’t get online.\nThis is why Internet Sharing prevents your machine from going to sleep.\nBut I can share files/iTunes/Screen When It's Asleep\nYes, you can share all those things, and more.  However, when you go to access those files your Mac wakes up.  This is called Wake On Demand and Bonjour Sleep Proxy.\nWhen your Mac is asleep, it keeps the network connection somewhat \"live;\" it's listening on for the Bonjour \"packets\" to wake up the computer.  This is handled by the Airport device (the network adapter) itself; not the computer.  When it receives the \"wake packet\" the Mac wakes up and you can start of your sharing of resources.\nBonjour1 is a zero config  discovery service that uses multicast Domain Name Services (mDNS) which is a UDP2 protocol (it's broadcast and can't be routed) which is a small, stateless and minimal message-oriented transport.  \nBasically, UDP (what Bonjour is based on) is perfect to send a message to your computer to say \"Wake up!\"\nIn order to browse the Internt (use a computer behind the gateway Mac), you need the full protocol stack which is based on TCP.  It will need DHCP, NAT, firewall, etc. which means it will have to spin up all those services prior to allowing clients to browse the web.  This will introduce a great deal of latency.\nAnd going back to a more pragmatic approach, if your Mac did go to sleep and acted as a gateway, it would either never go to sleep or would be up and down like someone with a bad case of insomnia.\n\n1Bonjour is Apple's implementation of zero-configuration networking (zeroconf), a group of technologies that includes service discovery, address assignment, and hostname resolution. Bonjour locates devices such as printers, other computers, and the services that those devices offer on a local network using multicast Domain Name System (mDNS) service records.\n\n2UDP is a minimal message-oriented transport layer protocol. UDP provides no guarantees to the upper layer protocol for message delivery and the UDP layer retains no state of UDP messages once sent. It is simple, suitable for bootstrapping or other purposes without a full protocol stack, such as the DHCP and Trivial File Transfer Protocol.\n\nA: Re. ControlPlane, this works for me ...\n\n\n\n\nA: When your computer's power management unit makes the device sleep, it enters a low-power mode.  Your average executable code on the computer is not run in the normal manner: the computer maintains enough power to refresh the memory (if necessary) and little else.  You're not going to be able to engage in general-purpose computing while the computer sleeps.\nHowever, there is a good alternative that you should look at.  Instead of sleeping the entire unit, check out display sleep in System Preferences -> Energy Saver.  In my use-case, I have a hot-corner setup (which you can enable in System Preferences -> Desktop & Screen Saver -> Screen Saver) so that when I'm going to lunch and need to lock my screen and/or just put the display to sleep, I move to the bottom-left corner.  Works well for me, the computer doesn't come back up from a sleep-routine and any long-running processes I've forgotten about aren't interrupted.  In your case, this means that your WiFi hotspot won't get dropped.\n\nA: You can use Power Manager to put your Mac to sleep after periods of inactivity. Power Manager can overrule processes and applications that block idle sleep, including Internet Sharing.\nThe user guide walks through how to set this up:\n\nA Better Inactivity Triggered Sleep\nPower Manager offers an alternative. We provide an inactivity\n  triggered sleep. Inactivity is measured differently from idle time;\n  inactivity is a simpler measurement determined solely by user\n  activity.\n\nAlternatively, the following recipe shows how to create a Power Manager event to put your Mac to sleep after a period of inactivity.\n\nDisclaimer: I work for the company who develop Power Manager.\n", "Q: Pop-up windows that disappear mysteriously It's been a while since, every now and then, I see a pop-up window appearing for a few milliseconds, that then disappears. I don't even have the time of reading what it says. \nAny idea on what could that be?\n\nA: Is it when you launch an application?\nI have a similar behavior with jDownloader, and it seems to be the Firewall (Allowing the app to make a connection) popup.  \nI don't have a solution, it's still happening, but since I don't have any trouble using the app, I haven't looked further.\nSince the app is based on Java, maybe OS X Lion notice (after showing the popup) that Java is allowed to connect and cancel the prompt. It's purely based on assumption and I wouldn't be surprise to be proven wrong but I can't find any other reason (since it's only with this, Java-based, app that it's happening)\n\nA: Go to System Preferences>Security & Privacy>Firewall>Firewall Options and add an incoming service: Library/Java/Home/bin/java\nSave settings/close the lock...you are done.\n\nA: Hmm, hard to tell without more detail.  \nThe first thing to try and track down is which application is causing the windows to open.  If you quit Safari (or whatever your browser is) and leave it closed for a while do the windows stop appearing?\nIf it's not your browser, you could try launching 'Activity Monitor' (found in the /Applications/Utilities folder) and try spotting processes that you don't recognise. it could be one of those.\n\nA: My Windows 7 Home Premium had popups appearing and disappearing in a flash after reinstallation. The mysterious popups went away after I turned Windows Firewall on.\nIt did not fix it - just slows down the frequency. I just discovered that running the process monitor stops the pop ups. Each time it happens, I start the process monitor and it will leave me alone until the next time I turn the computer on.\n", "Q: Do I need two partitions on an external drive when backing up using Super Duper! and Crashplan? I have a 1TB external drive which I want to use as a bootable backup of my Mac. I want to use this same disk as a backup destination for Crashplan backups too.\nIs it possible to do this without creating two partitions on the external drive? \nI would also like to encrypt this disk using disk utility, would this affect the backups?   \n\nA: Crashplan does not create bootable backups.  I'm not aware of the internal folder structure of the Crashplan backup, but the safest way to go is indeed to create an additional partition and perform a Mac OS install to it.  That way you're guaranteed that no folders will be overwritten etc.\nIf you use the FileVault encryption method (which Disk Utility uses), the disk will have all the same functionality that you would expect from an unencrypted disk once you have authenticated.  Just be sure to do so before your Crashplan backup starts or it won't see the disk.\n", "Q: Why  does my MacBook Pro's keyboard freeze when it wakes up so I have to hard reboot? Sometimes, but not every time, when I open my MacBook Pro to wake it from sleep, the keyboard doesn't respond, so I have to reboot my Mac using the power button.\nThere's a good chance that it happens when I close the lid without the laptop being plugged into power (the MagSafe plug), then plug in either power or headphones before I wake the computer again.\nIt is a MacBook Pro 15\"(2011), 2.2Ghz Intel Core i7, 500GB 5400 RPM, 8G RAM running\nMac OS X Lion 10.7.3 (11D50d).

I upgraded my Lion one by one (from 10.7 to 10.7.1,... till 10.7.3) and while upgrading, I didn't get any error or alert. So the updates went well.\nI tried to solve it following a work around involving inserting and unplugging my headphones, but that didn't work out.\nIs there any solid solution, or is this a known MacBook Pro issue?\n\nA: I'd suggest taking the laptop into your local Apple Store or an Apple Authorized repair location. This definitely seems like a hardware fault: I would hope they'd replace or repair the laptop. Make sure you make a complete backup before you go to the store.\n", "Q: Shortcut for opening applications stack on dock bar Is there any keyboard shortcut to open applications stack on dock bar? \nThe idea is I want to be able to open any app without using mouse.\n\nA: ctrl+fn+F3\n..selects an item of the dock.

Rather, what I want to be able to do in a rough \"must have\" to \"nice to have\" order is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add user-defined projects/tasks to a list each with its own timer\n\n*Manually start and stop project/task timers as I switch projects\n\n*Idle timer to stop recording activity if I leave the computer for a period of time\n\n*Access the app from the menubar (ability to hide dock icon would be a bonus too)\n\n*Create subtasks from the main project/task\n\n\nSo, apologies in advance for the following, but in my head the interface might look something like the following, but again I'm totally open to suggestions:\nProject          Time\n---------------------\nProject X        0:32   <Start/Stop Button>\nProject Y        4:00   <Start/Stop Button>\nProject Z        1:25    \n    Subtask 1    1:00   <Start/Stop Button>\n    Subtask 2    0:25   <Start/Stop Button>\n\nFor example, Harvest looks perfect for what I need, apart from the fact that there's a $12 per month cost. I'm not against paying for an application, but I'd like to avoid ongoing charges if possible.\n\nA: In the end, I found Timecop that does almost everything I wanted: simple project tracking with a variety of configurable reports spanning days, weeks, or months.\n\nHonourable mentions go to Tictoc which does a very similar job to Timecop, and Timing (which also has a free, Lite version). Timing is different in that its a \"traditional\" application tracker, however, you can create custom projects and drag applications into them, right down to the document level. So you can attribute different documents in a single app to different projects, which is great if you're working on two different projects in Xcode, for example. \n\nA: I'm not entirely sure what you mean, but it looks like On The Job is the application you are looking for. It will cost you money as well, but a one time license will provide you with a full version. \nAnother (paying) app is Office Time. Great in syncing with multiple platforms (PC, Mac, and iOS) and does a job similar to On The Job, mentioned above. \nI can think of a third application which will suit your needs, but I can't remember the name. I'll keep thinking and upate my answer as soon as I know it!\n\nA: I would check out TSheets time tracker. They have a free single user account, it is simple to set up with your job codes and click back and forth between projects, and although they have an extensive list of time tracking features you can customize your account to be as basic as you'd like. I have been very pleased with this company. \n\nA: I use hr - Task Timer which is very similar to Timecop and Tictoc, but free.\n\nA: On the Job is good but lacks reporting.

The login screen uses a separate host. It makes sense to enable some settings (like Trackpad tap to click) for both these hosts.\nFurthermore, OS X seems to have separate settings for Magic Trackpads and built-in MacBook Trackpads.

I prefer to use the Gmail app over the standard Mail app on my iPad for reading my personal Gmail (I delete a lot of mails, newsletters, etc., after reading and this is one tap in Gmail and several in Mail).\nI have them set up so my personal Gmail uses the Gmail app and my work email is set up to use the standard Mail app. This all works fine except for one problem. If I'm in Gmail or Mail and send an email it sends from the relevant email address as expected. My problem is that when I share something via email from Safari or another app it sends from the email address configured in Settings for Mail (the work one) and I would prefer to do such sharing from my personal email address.\nDoes anyone know if there is a way to achieve this? I could switch the addresses to use the other app but as I never delete work email and delete personal mail at least 50% of the time, the behaviour of the apps is perfect the way I have them set up; if only I could solve that one little problem of controlling where shared items are sent from.\nI am using an iPad 2 with iOS 5.1 should that be relevant.\n\nA: I have figured out a way to do this that will work for me.\nI already had my Gmail account added in Mail, calendar & contacts settings but with mail turned off. Once I turned mail on and did a test of sharing a page from Safari, I noticed that I now had access to the From header; the default was my work address but I could change it to my personal one. Checked settings again and found a Default Account setting; changed it to my personal account and now it's using that as the default for sharing via email. I can still use the Gmail app to work with my personal mail, while the Mail app has access to both accounts.\n\nA: In your desktop Gmail you can, in Settings, add other accounts that you can use for \"sending.\". Then, when on my iPad (new), I can tap in the From box and access my other account as \"sender.\" as far as I know you must set this up in the desktop/web version of Gmail.\n", "Q: How can I tell iTunes that a .M4V (movie) is an HD movie?

I think on the iPad's iBooks, if we purchase an ebook, then in another iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch, then that ebook is automatically downloaded into our bookshelf.\nHowever, what if it is a .epub or .pdf purchased, say, from O'Reilly?  Sometimes the ebook is $29.99 on iBooks store but $25.99 on O'Reilly.  It seems that the book won't be automatically downloaded to the bookshelf, but we can use Dropbox or Box.net to transfer to iBooks, and all the highlighting and added notes will be there on each device (sync'ed).\nBut is there a way to automatically download all books to our library?

It lacks the hosting and discovery aspects of the former, but has much more serious editing capabilities and is more like a Photoshop than an iPhoto for iOS.\nI also do use the normal camera regularly in combination with iPhoto and/or Snapseed for certain types of edits and sharing.\n   \n\nA: I myself was looking for a good alternative too and I ended up using Pixlr-o-matic. It's a fast and solid app which will allow you to take some pictures, share it with your friends and apply a lot of effect on the photos. You don't even need a phone with a camera to make this kind of pictures :)\n\n\nA: I'm still using an iPad (1st Generation) so I can't comment on picture-taking apps other than to say that with the consistent improvement to the standard Camera, particularly it's accessibility from the lockscreen, I find it's my goto camera on the iPhone 4S 99% of the time.\nIn terms of photo editing, the vast majority of my post production, including cropping, adjustments, filters and frames is done in one of two apps:\nSnapseed\n\nBy far my first choice for cropping, framing and post-production adjustments.

My setup at office is:\nInternet -> AirportExtreme --(wifi)--> AirportExpress --(eth1)--> MacPro1 --(eth2)--> MacPro2\nMacPro1 has Internet Sharing enabled, allowing MacPro2 to be online.\nBut MacPro2 does NOT see any of the shared Macs on the network.\nI tried changing the IP address manually on MacPro1, so it's the same subnet, but that didn't work.\nI tried changing the DHCP server on AirportExtreme from default 10.0.1.x to 192.168.2.x (to match the IP that MacPro2 was getting from MacPro1), so then MacPro1 got a 192.168.2.x address on eth1; but then MacPro2 became 192.168.3.x !\nHow can I get MacPro2 visible on the local network? It can't \"see\" OR \"be seen\" by any of the Macs on the 192.168.2.x network.\nHowever, if I MANUALLY connect from Finder to a 192.168.2.x address, then I can connect to other machines.\nThanks!\n\nA: Internet sharing on MacPro1 is acting as a router and doing NAT. The protocol used for discovery of other Macs on the 192.168.2.x network probably doesn't cross routers, which is normally what you want on a local network. The best way to fix this is to put an Ethernet switch or hub between MacPro1 and AirportExpress. Then plug both MacPro1 and MacPro2 into the switch.\nIf you don't want to use additional hardware (the original question didn't mention this), you need some way to get bonjour (OSX's discovery protocol) across the NAT/Routing function of Internet Sharing. There a few of Bonjour proxy/forwarder-type applications and IIRC, the \"Sharing\" system preferences has a global mode. Finally you might look into implimenting your own DNS Service Discovery server.\nUnfortunately, I don't have experience with any of these.  I guess this isn't really an answer, but maybe it'll point you in the right direction.\n\nA: This is a broadcast packet issue.\nBonjour (and a number of similar broadcast protocols) operate by sending an informational packet to 'everybody.'  When your router (Airport) - and the Mac - receive packets, they open them, observe the recipient, and forward it to the appropriate location.  This is where things get tricky, because when a broadcast packet is sent, it's actually sent to nobody in particular.  So when your router sees packets of this type, it generally only forwards it to the other computers in the subnet.  By having two DHCP servers (by having the bridging Mac share its connection) on the same network, you are essentially forcing it into two subnets.  If you tried to have the two routers on the same subnet, you would have two DHCP servers issuing IP addresses - generally said to be a bad thing.  The real issue here is that DHCP and Bonjour both operate using broadcast packets.\nSo what's the best way around this?\nYou can modify your subnet mask (generally something like 255.255.255.0) to be more general and include the next smallest group of IP addresses - probably by switching to 255.255.0.0.  You'll have to do this on all devices on the network.  However, this simply reintroduces the issue of dual DHCP servers.\nThe best solution is to have all your devices pointing at the same DHCP server somehow.  You can do this one of two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*By transparently bridging the ethernet ports on MacPro1 using 3rd-party software such as IPNetRouterX.  \n\n*If you're not opposed to obtaining additional hardware, you might consider purchasing a switch to attach to your AirportExpress and then attach both Mac Pros to that switch.\nI would do #2.  #1 requires MacPro1 to be on, and therefore results in more power usage and more potential downtime.\n", "Q: Flash Player Bug?

I've heard that Apple didn't change the touch input part of the new iPad's display when they upgraded to the Retina screen. \nIs the touch response accuracy pixel-per-pixel perfect on the iPad third gen or is it lower?\n\nA: Having just googled, I can't find a definitive answer to your question.\nHowever, intuitively, I'd say that I can't see any way that, with a finger, you could select a point with accuracy anywhere close to 264 pixels per inch (see the Display section of the iPad technical specs).\nAnd none of the Stylus reviews I've seen (such as this recent one from The Verge) suggest that any available styluses/stylii can reach a significantly greater accuracy than a finger - presumably because of the capacitive nature of the display: see e.g. this from Wikipedia\n\nCapacitive touchscreens are more expensive to manufacture and offer a\n  significantly lesser degree of accuracy than resistive touchscreens.\n\n\nA: Internally, meaning Apple apps using APIs not available to third-party developers, I can't say for sure.\nPublic APIs (every non-Apple app on the app store) still receive touch coordinates for new iPad as floating point numbers in a coordinate system bounded by 1024 height and 768 width. This is the same as happened with the iPhone 4: while actual resolution doubled developers continue to process coordinates from and address the display as if it has 320x480 resolution, not its actual 640x960.\nDevelopers can know that the display is double resolution by looking at the view's scale property but simply doubling the coordinates doesn't increase resolution, just the size of the values.\nLike Clare says, the tip of your finger or a stylus just isn't any more accurate than that. So probably even Apple apps which might be able to access retina-resolution coordinates wouldn't bother. Reporting actual coordinates of touches at 264ppi is roughly equivalent to reporting points made by a precise application of a 0.1mm technical pen!\n", "Q: Is there a way to set Instagram as default camera app on iPhone? Is there a way to set Instagram as default camera app on iPhone?\nSo that I can open it from the lock screen?\n\nA: As far as I know, the only way to do this is to jailbreak and use a Cydia app called AnyLockApp. It allows you to configure the behavior of the camera button that appears on the lock screen. You can set any app to be activated by that button. See also the AnyLockApp page.\n\nSettings screen:\n\nThis hack will probably not work in iOS 5.1. However, this is unconfirmed. I will update this answer when I do update and jailbreak iOS 5.1.\nBesides this hack, there is no other way to change the behavior of the camera button on the lock screen.\n\nA: iOS does not let you select the \"default app for file/link type\" for anything. Not the default web browser, default camera, default Twitter client, etc.\nThe system that does power how the OS handles http://, mailto:, and twitter:// links is relatively trivial, with exceptions for cases where there are multiple apps handling the same URI, etc., but there is no way, without jailbreaking your device (see @daviesgeek's answer), to change the default handler for the \"built in\" links.\nBasically it boils down to, an app you install registers on file and link types, and when one of those is referenced from another app, the registered app is opened. There are a few exceptions such as what locations allow duplicates allow you to choose. Like Safari's built in PDF preview, or in iPad Mail, etc.\nTry this:\nHave the official Twitter client? (Some third party ones may as well.) Open Safari, tap on the address bar, type in: twitter:// and tap Go.\nMore simple, and guaranteed to work. Open Safari, tap on the address bar, type mailto: and tap Go.\nThese are just a few examples of inter-app linking and how they actually occur in iOS. File types are a bit harder and much more internal than can be represented easily in a user-facing part of iOS.\n", "Q: How do I make iTunes video play slower or faster? I want to play videos in iTunes faster (1x, 2x, double speed, etc.) or maybe slower. How do I do that?\n\nA: The Cmd+K shortcut no longer works in Lion or Mavericks. \nPlease see a post about increasing the playback speed in Quicktime.\nThe double arrow allows for integer increases in playback speed.\n\nA: *\n\n*Right click on the iTunes playlist and click Show in Finder\n\n*Right click on the content in Finder and click Open with Quicktime player.\n\n*While watching the video/movie press Command and then right arrow or left arrow to increase or decrease playback speed, respectively.\n\n\nA: Quicktime Player allows you to play the audio faster, but not slower.\nThe chosen answer, by @daviesgeek, works for Quicktime Player 7 (Snow Leopard or earlier).\nIf you're on a later version (well, I only tested this on macOS Sierra and Quicktime 10.4), you can play it faster by doing:\n\n\n*\n\n*opt + click-on-fast-forward-button. This will increase playback by 0.1x each time.\n\n*opt + right-arrow. This one increases from 1x to 2x to 5x.\n\n\nYou cannot play at a slower speed though (but you can play backwards at speeds greater than 1x).\n\nA: Right click on the file in iTunes and choose \"Show in Finder.\" Then right click the file and open in Quicktime Player. In Quicktime Player you can choose the playback speed by using the A/V Controls (Command + K or Window>A/V Controls). From there, you can select the playback speed:\n\nAlternatively, you could use VLC or another music player.\n\nA: Folks, you can download Quicktime Player 7, which is for Snow Leopard or later Mac OS, and works with older media files (as well as current ones, it seems). It has the variable speed functionality you're seeking. \nNo guarantees this link will work whenever you read this, but it's working now, Nov 2015:\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/DL923?locale=en_US\n(Why Apple removed this functionality from Quicktime, who knows.)\nOnce installed, then play the audio file by first locating it in Finder, and use CMD-click to \"open with\" Quicktime Player 7. Voila. \n\nA: Works for me on Lion or Mavericks:\n\n\n*\n\n*CMD+OPTION+ (right arrow) for 1,1x\n\n*CMD+(right arrow) for 2x\n\nA: macOs Sierra users can use Opt - RightArrow in Quicktime.\n\nA: You can control the playback speed of an audio / video file in your browser by creating a bookmark with the javascript code found here:\nhttps://webapps.stackexchange.com/a/86817/217003\njavascript: var v = document.querySelector('video'); var t = prompt('Set the playback rate'); v.playbackRate = parseFloat(t)\n\nI have done this with Safari Version 12.1.1 (14607.2.6.1.1).\nI prefer to use Quicktime built into Safari instead of VLC, because slowing down audio / video files in VLC sound harsh.\n", "Q: What is the keyboard combination for the ⌘ symbol? There are many handy shortcuts for exotic characters in Mac such as Option + 7 for ¶ and Option + G for ©. Is there one to yield the command key ('⌘') sign?\n\nA: As the other answers mention, by default there is no easy way to enter this symbol. You could use a text substitution as well (none of the other answers so far mentioned that), but that’s another imperfect solution.\nIf you need this (or any other Unicode glyph) frequently and want to be able to type it on your keyboard, your best bet is to create a custom keyboard layout. That way, you can assign a keyboard shortcut of your choosing to the ⌘ symbol.\nUsing my custom QWERTY layout, for example, I can use ⌥+Shift+C to enter ⌘.\n\nA: You can only do this if you choose \"Unicode Hex Input\" as your keyboard layout in System Preferences > Language & Text. Once you have done so:\nHold down alt and type 2 3 1 8\n\nA: There is not a shortcut key, but the easiest way to use it is to favorite it in Character Viewer. If you don't see the Character Palette in your menu bar: , then go to System Preferences > Language & Text > Input Sources and make sure that the Keyboard & Character Viewer is on:  \n\nThen, in your menubar, click the character palette icon and choose \"Show Character Palette\" Search for \"Place of Interest sign\" or ⌘.

According to the manual for my Prius, the contacts from a paired BT device, including an iPhone or iPad, should appear under the \"Phonebook\" tab in the car's navigation system, with entries containing addresses enabled for selection as destinations. This much works as expected with my (successfully paired) iPhone 4S running iOS 5.1. But none of these entries work as destinations: selecting any of them results in an error stating that the address is \"not navigable\".\n\nIs iOS 5.1 capable of sharing \"navigable\" address information from the address book over Bluetooth? If so, is this a known bug with either iOS 5.1 or the Toyota navigation system pairs with an iPhone?\n\nA: BT Phone/Address systems use different Bluetooth \"Stacks\" or APIs. You have to check compatibility for each one at the mobile vendor's site or through third party enthusiast sites. Sadly, this level of detail is often beyond your average auto parts department because as an extension of sales they will simply say, \"Yah, sure. It's Bluetooth, it'll work.\" For example our 2005 Prius could not speak Apple Address Bluetooth, but our 2012 Chrysler can.\nSadly, you won't get much milage (pardon the pun) out of hacks and jailbreaks because it comes down to the low level Bluetooth (sometimes at the chip level) that the equipment uses.\nAlso, to be an iOS compatible BT device, the device has to go thru the process of MFI certification.\nSo, again. you'll have to call your auto support line and in the case of the Prius; prepare for disappointment.\nIn the case where you have been able to exchange address book entries, you will likely need to make sure that the address book entry is in the right format. (Country, state, label, etc) Again... check with expert forums on that.\nIn the case of a Prius, I stongly recommend: PriusChat\n\nA: No, they do not. The Prius navigation system requires a very specific format for addresses which many users are unlikely to have chosen, and most are likely to have violated in at least some addresses.\nIn order to have a chance at getting the contacts from your iPhone to be \"navigable\", you'll need to check them all and edit each of them to change any entries with terms like \"Drive\", \"Street\", \"Avenue\" or \"East\", \"West\" etc. to the corresponding abbreviations (DR, ST, AVE; E, W, etc.).\n", "Q: How can I hide the privacy tab from Spotlight.prefpane? I am using spotlight search on my MacBook, and am excluding a few folders from spotlight search. My problem with Apple's method of excluding the folders is that excluding them actually calls attention to them. If I let a friend use my computer or something, and they happen to end up in that preference pane, all they have to do to go to the folders is double click on them.\nI tried this tip, however it seems not to work under OSX Lion.\nAlso, please don't tell me to just log out, or lock my computer when I am away. That is something I have made a habit of doing, however I still allow people to use my account (browse iTunes, etc.).\n\nA: First things first.\nThe best way to go about securing data that you want accessible to yourself but not others while still allowing them to access the remainder of the account's data is to opt-in the data to a segregated location.\nThe best option is to set aside a disk image or disk partition for any files that you want segregated.  FileVault does a very good job of this while maintaining integration on a low level (compared to other encryption options like TrueCrypt).  On my machine I have a specific partition called \"Vault\" that contains anything that could get me or my company in trouble if it fell into anyone in particular's hands.  Using these methods, you don't even need to add the folder to the Spotlight exclusion list in order to remove it.  To prevent others from accessing the drive, simply unmount it.  Spotlight will see that the disk is missing and exclude the data from search results.\nYou can also maintain TimeMachine integration by using the partitioning method.  Using TimeMachine with the disk image method will result in a full backup of the disk image every time a backup is initiated and anything on the disk has been changed.\nHere are the tools you'll need to emulate my example above:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can add a new partition to an existing disk using instructions\nfound in this walkthrough. \n\n*You can find a good walkthrough on how to encrypt a partition here.\n\n\nAnd should you choose to go the disk image route:\n\n\n*\n\n*To create an encrypted disk image follow the instruction here.\n\n\nA: Files in system directories like ~/Library/ aren't included in normal Spotlight results, so another workaround could be to just move the folders and remove them from the privacy tab.\n\nA: Instead of including the folders in the Privacy tab, you can append .noindex to their names. This will keep them from appearing in Spotlight results without calling attention to them in the Privacy pane, and without requiring you to reorganize your file system.\nSource\n", "Q: Does TextWrangler 4 break BBAutoComplete 1.5.3? I just installed TextWrangler 4, and now when I try to use BBAutoComplete version 1.5.3, I get the error message seen below.\n\nIs there a workaround to make BBAutoComplete work with TextWrangler 4?\n\nA: Yes, it breaks version 1.5.3, and yes, there's a workaround. But now it's unnecessary, because version 1.5.4 has been released and it solves the problem.\nIf for some reason you want to still use 1.5.3, you can do the following:\nIn the script ~/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Scripts/BBAutoComplete, there is a function canCompleteInWindow(w). This function needs to be modified to work with TextWrangler 4.\nOpen the script in AppleScript Editor.\nAs it ships, there is a function in the script that reads\non canCompleteInWindow(w)\n    tell application \"TextWrangler\"\n        return class of w is in {text window, disk browser window}\n    end tell\nend canCompleteInWindow\n\nChange it so it reads \non canCompleteInWindow(w)\n    tell application \"TextWrangler\"\n        return class of w is in {text window, disk browser window, project window}\n    end tell\nend canCompleteInWindow\n\nSave the script.

It's strange that pretty much all other application and website passwords are stored there, but not for iTunes.\nNote: I'm not asking about iPhone/iPad etc.\n\nA: Apparently not. Its is meant to ask for your password for your own safety, so no one except you can buy Apps. \nIt will remember your password for 15 minutes, though.\n\nA: You can work around this using the 3rd party macro/scripting app called \"Keyboard Maestro\", from http://www.keyboardmaestro.com\nHere's a screen shot of the simple script I use. Currently it only works when the App Store is in the background, and gets automatically activated by clicking a web link in Firefox or something, but you get the idea, this could be modified and improved in various ways. \nNeedless to say, security is compromised by storing your password in plain-text within Keyboard Maestro script, so be sure it's a unique, random password that you don't use anywhere else.\n\n", "Q: Does \"Group Message\" mean that all recipients would \"see\" each other?

As far as I can tell, that switch doesn't do anything on an iPhone and isn't there to even help on an iPad / iPod touch.\n\nA: No, according to this topic on the discussionboard of Apple, if you send the message to multiple people, but they will receive it as single message.\nIf you want to achieve a group message, I suggest you use group-sms (iMessages only!). Which will allow you to have conversations with multiple persons. \n", "Q: How to share internet with WPA/WPA2 security? I'm using a macmini with Mac OS X Snow Leopard to share a cable internet connection. Sharing works fine except that security is limited to 40/128 bit WEP that is insecure (can be hacked in minutes). Is it possible to share the connection via wifi with stronger WPA/WPA2 security? Maybe using some third-party internet sharing app?\n\nA: Mac OS X Mountain Lion supports Internet Sharing using WPA/WPA2.  You will need to upgrade to get this functionality.  This article has a little more info.  And here is a screenshot of the new option for WPA2 in Mountain Lion (10.8):\n\n\nA: This is not supported in Mac OS X 10.7 and lower. See:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I secure a Mac's ad hoc network better than just the default WEP?\n\n*http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.6/en/8339.html\nPerhaps in the next version of the OS, but currently Lion does not accommodate changing the encryption/authentication protocol of an ad-hoc network based from the device.\nThough I have looked, there is no software to my knowledge that supports this feature aside from using a separate OS.  You can dual boot: Some versions of Windows do support this feature.\n\nA: It seems that a work-around is to boot into an older version of the OS, configure WPA2, and then boot back.\nI set up Internet Sharing a few OS versions ago, and the “Airport Setup” screen had a “Security” dropdown to choose between WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA2 Enterprise. Now, running 10.6.8, the “Security” dropdown is gone, and WEP seems to be the only choice. Yet, when I enable sharing on the machine, it still uses the previously-configured WPA2.\n", "Q: Fastest way to get to camera in iOS? There are a few different states an iOS device might be in when one wants to capture a memory really fast:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power off, with a PIN or password screen\n\n*Power off, no PIN or password, but need to \"slide to unlock\"\n\n*Power on - on springboard (no app running, looking at app icons)\n\n*Power on - in an app\n\n\nIn earlier versions of iOS one could double click the home button twice from nearly any situation and open the camera.  It appears that there is no quick hardware way built in to the latest versions of iOS, though there is a jailbreak way to enable faster hardware access to the camera.  I'm not interested in jailbreaking, though, so I'm hoping to catalog the various methods one can get into the camera app quickly.\nAny tips for making this faster in non-jailbroken devices (such as specific apps that are faster, or placing the camera app of choice in the bottom app bar on springboard) would also be welcome.\nHow quickly can we get the camera to snap a picture?\n\nA: If you are using iOS 6 (which I am, I can't get iOS 7 on an iPod 4) and the power is on, no matter what you're doing, the easiest way I found was to press the sleep button to put it on standby, press it again to turn it on, find the little camera icon that's next to the \"slide to unlock\" bar, drag it up to open the camera, and capture your moment. \nOf course, this answer is very conditional: it only works if you have iOS 6, the device is either on or on standby, and you do not have a passcode (if you have a passcode, it makes you type it in before you can use the camera). But it works for me all the time, and I think this would work pretty well for others, too.\n\nA: You described the fastest way without jail breaking. \nUsing the Lock Screen/Swipe mechanism. I had Camera+ instead of the regular Camera in my springboard. \n", "Q: web sharing doesn't make my website live on internet? I have enabled web sharing in System Preference. Still when I try to access my machine from outside the LAN using safari url: http://my-laptop-ip-address/ I get this - \"Can open the webpage\" \nWhy?\n\nA: It's likely that your router is engaging in Network Address Translation.  In order to see the web page inside your LAN from outside of it...\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll have to turn on port forwarding on the HTTP port that you're serving (80 is the default) to direct any traffic to the internal address.  This process varies from router to router, so you'll have to look at the manual that came with that device.\n\n*It's best to also set up a static IP address for the computer serving the website so that if it reboots, the port forwarding still works.  This is unnecessary if you can port forward using the hostname (not typically supported).  This also varies from router to router.\n\n*Direct your clients to your externally-facing IP address.  If you don't have a reserved IP through your ISP, this might change from time-to-time, especially if you restart your modem, so I recommend...\n\n*(optional) Get an account at a dynamic dns host such as DynDNS to allow external users to see a persistent address.  You'll have to install some software on the server to periodically make sure that the IP address is correct.\n", "Q: Restoring original baseband to iPhone 3G 4.2.1 with iPad baseband A friend of mine bought an iPhone 3G from some T-Mobile cell phone vendor. The vendor had installed a custom 4.2.1 ipsw with the iPad baseband because iPhone 3G's wasn't unlockable at the time. That was great at first, but then my friend tried to restore the iPhone through iTunes. Because of the baseband, in the middle of the restore (the bar on the iPhone was partially filled) iTunes would vomit an error and axe the whole process, essentially bricking the device. He usually takes his computer issues to me, so I managed to fix the issue by reading forums and by finding an ipsw online with iPad's baseband. \nThat iPhone's been working for a while now, but if this happens again, is there a way I can revert from the iPad baseband so he can restore through iTunes without my intervention?\n\nA: You cannot restore the baseband. Upgrading to iPad baseband 6.15.00 is permanent (unless for some magical reason Apple wanted to come out with new firmware for the iPhone 3G/3GS that miraculously contained a baseband higher than 6.15.00). What you have to do is use redsn0w to remove the baseband from an .ipsw file (the iOS firmware from Apple) if you want to upgrade/restore. There's an excellent tutorial on how to do that here. Note that you it will always need to be JailBroken, too (which that tutorial has you do), because iTunes will not verify your .ipsw under these circumstances (even if you try to load on the modified firmware without JailBreaking and then taking it into iTunes to complete the verification/activation (believe me, I've tried)).\n\nA: i had the same exact issue yesterday and thank god for Everythingapplepro on Youtube. The answer to fix your bricked iphone 3G is here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0I1dNq5g3Kk\nAfter getting your iphone 3g up and running again, you have the option to downgrade your baseband if you meet the following requirements that are outlined in his other video:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UJfyVcDEWg\nHis videos are AMAZING!\n\nA: By now it is possible to down-grade your baseband from the iPad's 06.15 to 05.13.04 (un-lockable) thanks to the great work of the iPhone Dev Team:\n\nThe iPhone Dev Team is happy to announce a baseband downgrade option in redsn0w for those who are using the iPad’s 06.15 baseband on the iPhone3G or iPhone3GS.\nTypically you’d have the 06.15 baseband if you unlock with ultrasn0w but updated your iPhone baseband past 05.13.04.  With this new capability, you can now downgrade specifically from 06.15 to 05.13.04 (even if you never had 05.13.04 on that device before).  This gives you the best of both worlds: ultrasn0w compatibility and a normal iPhone baseband with full GPS and the ability to use stock IPSWs again.\n\nSee this post on their blog.\n", "Q: Select outgoing mail folder in Mail.app On my iPhone, I can go to Settings > Mail > Any Account > Account > Advanced > Sent Mailbox and select which folder I'd prefer to have my Sent mail stored in. How can I do this in Mail on a Mac? I am trying to change which folder the sent messages are stored in when saving them to the server.\n\nA: In Mail select the mailbox you want to use from the list on the left and navigate to the menu Mailbox > Use this Mailbox For, then choose the appropriate purpose from the menu:\n\n\nA: I've faced this issue in the past.\nYou want to be sure to be using a single folder for Sent Mail across all devices and email clients. If you use webmail at all, there is a standard arrangement for inboxes and sent items. Christian explains the issue well:\n\nI use Mail to connect to a traditional IMAP server (non-Gmail). I've noticed that all the messages I send are placed in Mail's \"Sent\" folder and that Mail is translating this folder to a server folder called \"Sent Messages\". The problem is that on the IMAP server, the real folder meant to store sent messages is called \"Sent Mail\".\nI occasionally send messages using the server's web interface. Because of this, over time I will have my sent messages spread out over \"Sent Messages\" and \"Sent Mail\" in the server. If I want to find a sent message, and because these messages are not consolidated, I now have two places I need to search thru.\n\nI would recommend you map Apple Mail's Sent to \"Sent Mail\" as used by your IMAP webmail client and do the same with your iPhone.\n\nThe same system applies to Drafts, Trash and Junk. Bonus tip: don't use IMAP for drafts as they drafts will multiply across all your computers, becoming unmanageable (up to 25 copies). Instead use a local folder on each of your computers. It's possible that the drafts multiplying like rabbits bug was fixed some time after Apple Mail 4.6 (OS X 10.6.8) but I have no confirmation of a fix.\n", "Q: Why does my Macbook Pro try to shut down when I leave it unattended? When I close the lid of my Macbook Pro (Lion), it goes to sleep, which is good: it powers down without closing my applications.\nBut if I just leave the computer unattended for a while without closing the lid, it attempts to shut down instead. It usually fails at this, because there's often a program such as Photoshop (which doesn't use Lion's autosave feature) blocking shutdown with a \"Save as\" dialog. But it does always succeed, annoyingly, in closing my browser etc. It does this even when the computer is plugged in and fully charged.\nWhen I leave my computer unattended for 15 minutes, I want it to behave exactly as if I had closed the lid: it should go to sleep, not shut down. \nHow can I do this?\n\nA: Try going to System Preferences and choosing Security & Privacy.  When that application window opens, choose \"General\" tab and then look to the lower right corner and click on \"Advanced\".  Uncheck \"Log out after _ _ minutes of inactivity.\nNot sure but this might be the cause.\nGood luck\n\nA: Yes, indeed, the \"Log out after 60 min\" had a check mark. That was the problem. I was just lucky that the OS was unable to Quit certain applications that do not use the built-in Autosave feature, but many times I found myself at the Login screen when coming back to the puter.\n\nA: It could be the SMC, or a bug in the firmware. Try these two steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset the SMC, see: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964\n\n*You may need a firmware update, see: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1474?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\n\nA: I know this might not be very helpful... but my guess is that you have an app or widget that has scheduled a shutdown... either that or the energy preferences but you checked that already...\n\nA: Thanks for everyone's advice on this. When I asked the question I thought this auto-shutdown thing was some feature I must have accidentally enabled somewhere... But after a lot of searching, update-installing, settings-tweaking, etc, I concluded it was just some rare bug in my system.\nIn the end, I just re-installed OS X.

I changed it in iTunes, and that seemed to work fine, but when I look at \"About\" in \"Settings\" it still has the old name.  Any ideas?  It's an iPod 5.5\n\nA: If it is running iOS 5, you should be able to change it in Settings>General>About>Name:\n\nIf it is running anything less than iOS 5 (or is just a click wheel iPod) you'll need to plug it into your computer and change it from iTunes. Click on the name in the sidebar and change it:\n\nIf this still doesn't work (and doesn't show up on the iPod), try restoring (in iTunes) it, or restarting it (hold down the center button and the menu button for 10 seconds)\n", "Q: Lion Mail \"Show Format Bar' button missing In Lion Mail there is supposed to be a \"show format bar\" button at top right of a new mail window. It is not there for me. How can I get it to show?\n\nA: You have to customise the toolbar and add the format button.\nDrag the format button to the bar:\n\nAnd when you compose a new message, you can click on the format icon:\n\nAnd the bar will appear.\n", "Q: Can I find out who is currently using my Airport Express speakers, and kick them? If I want to stream music to an AE when someone else is connected, I get a message \"The speaker XXX is currently used by someone else\". \nRight now, both my flatmates are not connected to the AE but I still get that message - the AE seems to be stuck. It appears all I can do is unplug the unit and plug it in again.\nIs there a way for me to kick the current user, or at least see who was last connected to it?\n\nA: Change the WiFi password. If I am not wrong, you can only access AirPlay speakers via WiFi. So change it and the person in question won't be able to connect. \nIf you want to find out who it is, go on to your router interface something like 192.168.X.X and see who is connected. Most people name their computers, so will probably show up. Sorry if I can't be more specific.\nAlso, maybe there is a bug with your AE (doubt it). Maybe you should reset it.\n\nA: When I can't tell which device has a hold of the speakers, I often just reboot the base station. When it comes back i've always been able to grab it first. \nI suppose you could also add a password for sharing to reduce the chance someone uses the AirPlay speakers. \nOf course if you wanted the satisfaction of doing it surgically you could run tcpdump to sniff the sound packets and the cycle or stop that device, but there is no button to bump one device from the network or the speakers (like there is for the disk sharing on airport extreme and time capsule).\n\nA: A simple solution is to go to the AirPlay tab in the device's settings panel and uncheck \"Enable AirPlay,\" then update. This will kick everyone off. Wait for it to come back, then re-enable. \n\nA: Edit of secound solution\nIf you want to find out who it is, go on to your router interface something like 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1 and see who is connected. If you do not know user/password, you can in many cases use the default user/password(http://routerpasswords.com). Most people name their computers, so will probably show up. Sorry if I can't be more specific.\n", "Q: Signing up to iTunes Match in a country that doesn't have it I am really digging Apple's iTunes Match and would love to get it. However, I am living in Sweden where you can´t subscribe to it at the moment. I have found that there is a workaround for it, by buying a US gift card and singing up with a US iTunes Store account. \nMy question is simply how will this affect how I use my iPhone and Mac? For example, will I end up with a US account with no money on it so I can't buy any music or apps? \nCould I change store location of my current Swedish account, get iTunes Match for a year and then switch back? \nLastly, what would happen if iTunes Match becomes available in Sweden a couple of months after I have signed up using a US account? I wouldn't mind paying for it twice, but I am thinking there might be other complications. Thoughts, anyone?\n\nA: You can switch your store location to US or create a new US iTunes account without providing a credit card number but you have to provide a valid US address. Since the address isn't used for anything you can just use any address. Many people have used the address of the White House, for example. I used my old address from when I lived in the US. I'm not sure if it makes a difference, but some people recommend using an address in a state that has no sales tax (such as Oregon).\nHowever, as you don't have a valid US credit card, the only way to fund your account for buying apps, music, books etc is using iTunes Gift Cards for the US Store, which you'll have to buy on eBay, for slightly more than their face value.\nI did this for a while (created a separate, gift card funded, US iTunes account) so that I could buy/rent movies and TV Shows on my AppleTV as neither of these were available in the Portuguese iTunes store (where I live). I found that the hassle of having to load up my iTunes account with gift cards bought on eBay just wasn't worth it in the end. The other problem was having to constantly switch between my Portuguese and US iTunes accounts both on iTunes and on AppleTV.\nAs a result I haven't used my US account for quite a while now. The Portuguese store now has movies, but still no TV Shows or iTunes Match which I'd really like to have but I've decided just to wait.\nAlso, the automatic downloads feature of iTunes (for apps etc) is limited to one iTunes account per 90 days. \nAs to whether you could change back, when iTunes Match becomes available in Sweden? I don't see any reason why not. However, you almost certainly would have to re-'match' or upload your music again. \n\nA: Yes, you can switch back to the Swedish store after you have synchronized you songs with iTunes match! I was in the same situation, and I wanted to use iTunes Match even though I live in Sweden. I bought a US iTunes Match Gift Card from a Swedish guy living in Miami at http://itunes-giftcards.com/iTunes_Match.html I had the card info after a few minutes, set it up with my US iTunes account, and iTunes Match started synchronizing right away.\n\nA: I don't think so. The option will most likely vanish once you change back.\nAFAIK you can change your store location but you will have to provide a US address .\n", "Q: Has anyone tricked the Apple Configurator to work with non VPP redemption codes? I wonder if anyone has had success or failure in attempting to use the Apple Configurator with normal gifted app redemption codes. The FAQ clearly states that you must be in the Volume Purchase Program (VPP) to import a spreadsheet from the VPP portal - however, I wonder if it would be possible to assemble a DIY spreadsheet with valid gifted apps for use.\nApple Configurator: Using Volume Purchase Program (VPP) Redemption Codes\nMy guess is no, but figured perhaps someone may have already tried this.\n\nA: This was only necessary with version 1.0 of the configurator.\nVersion 1.0.1 (110) allows more codes to be used than just VPP generated ones.\n", "Q: How to scan from my HP-1610 (all in one) networked printer/scanner (Lion) I have an HP-1610 all in one.  It's hooked up to my TimeCapsule as a networked printer.  Networked-printing works.  I'm on Lion (latest; 10.7.3 as of this writing.)  I'd like to scan a sheet from my printer and get it onto my desktop (or wherever.)\nI tried opening Preview.app and Import From Scanner -> Include networked devices, but the scanner never shows up in the popup menu.\nI tried \"Share scanner\" in sharing preferences.\nOddly, in Print & Scan preferences, there is no \"scan\" option.  I think that's the bit I'm missing.\nHints?\nThanks!\nEDIT: In Print & Scan prefs, my instance of the printer for when it's hard-wired has Print/Scan tabs but, for the networked one (the same printer appears in the list 2x), there is no Scan, only Print.  Same thing when I open the print queues.\n\nA: Use Image Capture (Applications>Image Capture). Select the printer from the sidebar:\n\n", "Q: How do you clear Mac install program files? I installed a 30-day \"test drive\" of QuarkXpress, but got pulled in to other projects and didn't have time to test it. I now need to test it, but the 30 days are up. So I want to install the \"test drive\" again, but it won't let me. So far, I uninstalled the old copy, signed up under a different account, and downloaded a new version. I know there has to be application data somewhere, but I am a PC person and don't know where to look in the Mac OS. HELP! Thanks.\nOh, and if necessary, I am using Mac OS X (Snow Leopard) Version 10.6.8 on a Mac Pro.\n\nA: In the old days, changing the date, deleting the preferences, or installing the trial software in a different path did the trick, but, nowadays, it seems rather unlikely that there's such an easy way. \nTrial software may call home to check the database for a combination of your MAC address and your email, your IP, both, create an invisible file with a who-knows-which-name or a million different things. I mean, if there was an easy way to do so, you wont need the full version, right?\nSomeone might find a way, of course. But it will probably be for a specific program, not a generic way for all trial software.\nEDIT: Just noticed that I'm not answering your question. Indeed, installed and used applications will leave other files, such as Preferences, stored either in your user's preferences folder (~/Library/Preferences) or in the System-Wide preferences folder  (/Library/Preferences/), or Application Support Files (which will be, again, in your user's library folder or in the root one). There could be a lot more, of course.\nIf you want to get rid of them, making a search, with Spotlight or Finder, should show them all.\n", "Q: How to see contacts that are suggested when composing emails? When composing emails I get suggestions for who to send to based on previous received and sent emails. Is there any way to see this list? I'd like to add them to my actual contacts list.\n\nA: The easiest way to add a contact from the iOS mail app is to see their address in an e-mail. Received or Sent does not matter.\nSimply tap on their e-mail address, or the name it displays for them and a callout window will appear with the choices 'Create New Contact' or 'Add to Existing Contact'. Tap on one of those and add the details as necessary.\nNote that if you already have them in your address bar, following this process will show all the contact information you have for the individual.\n", "Q: Is it possible to change the gray color scheme of Lion? Seems to be too much gray in Lion.  Status bar, title bar, scroll bars, links bar, tabs, everything blends into itself.\nI am guessing that is part of the design. Any options to changes these?\n\nA: You can make a subtle change away from gray shifting towards blue with theOS preferences. Go to Apple Menu -> System Preferences...\nThen click on General in the upper left\n\nAnd then select Blue under appearance\n\n\nA: There doesn't seem to be an awful lot you can do, but as a start, you could get the colored iTunes icons or Finder sidebar icons back like they used to be in Snow Leopard.\n\nA: It's possible to mod the color scheme but it involves changing resource files and is not for the faint of heart. Refer to my answer to the question \"How do I change the Lion menubar selection color?\". There are some ready made mods (BlackPurple, LionPulse) on Deviant Art.\n", "Q: If I buy an iPad 3 on Verizon, can I use my existing SIM? I already have a Verizon 4G LTE phone with a LTE SIM card (or whatever its called). If I purchase a Verizon iPad 3 from Craigslist, can I put my own SIM card in there and use my current data plan?\n\nA: The answer is YES. I purchased a Verizon iPad 3 from someone on craigslist, I then tried cutting the sim card from my Android 4G LTE phone ... fail. I bought a new sim card and ordered a Noosy from Amazon, cut the new micro-sim and VOILA, it worked!

Is there an easy to use Bible program, preferably with dictionary, concordance as well as text for maybe more than 1 translation.\nMy PC has PC Study Bible and it's great but I've grown to hate Parallels.\nTried Macsword and bombed out, too complicated for me.\n\nA: Logos Bible Software\nFor both Mac and iOS, as well as Windows, Android, and web based. It has several different versions, some are paid, and some free. It allows you to search within a Bible. Other features include Bible words studies, passage guides, highlighting, and reading plans\niOS App Store Link (iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch compatible)\n\nLogos for Mac\n\n\nA: Top Choices for Mac Bible Software\nThere are many Bible programs for the Mac.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Logos Bible software  Fairly easy to use but also somewhat expensive.\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Accordance  I have heard that this is the best and most powerful of them, and there is a free version.\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*OliveTree This is what I use (mostly on my iPad) and I love it.\n\nYou can find other links to software here.\n\nA: This is the ridiculously simple answer, but I don't use a special bible reader program; I use built-in operating system features and a high quality text editor.\nI constructed a text file called Bible.txt that I open in TextWrangler. The editor's search features function well as a concordance, and for multiple translations, I open additional text files in additional windows. Thanks to the wonders of Unicode, it even works for Hebrew and Greek versions.\nI have chapter breaks set up with hard \\n characters, and verses separated simply by verse numbers, so each line is a chapter.\nIt doesn't have a bible dictionary, but three-finger tap on my trackpad brings up the Mac OS X Dictionary, which includes Wikipedia pages that are quite helpful about names of people, places, events, etc.\nOn the iOS side, I use iBooks. Not as full-featured as the Mac side, but I mostly read there, and don't do a whole lot of active sermon writing on my iPod Touch.\n\nA: I like Blue Letter Bible (Mac/OSX).  Different versions for side x side comparison.  Great iPhone and and iPad Apps.  Has great commentaries (written and Audio).  The Apps is where I believe it does the best job. It's free, donations are accepted.\n\nA: If you're looking for synchronization between devices as a key feature, then you could consider using a Kindle bible. Then you've got a web interface, iPad, and iPhone interface that synchronizes your personal notes and highlights. It unfortunately won't have a lot of the other features you're looking for.\n", "Q: How to set Outlook 2011 as the main contact manager? When I installed Microsoft Outlook 2011 Lion asked me if I wanted to use it as my main Mail client. How can I make Outlook be my main contact manager in OSX?\nFor example when I open FaceTime my contacts are empty, but I have all my contacts within Outlook through Exchange (Office 365).\nIs it possible?\n\nA: Applications like FaceTime access information stored by Address Book using Apple's Core Data framework. Microsoft has it's own way of storing contact information, and FaceTime won't read it. In order for FaceTime (and other apps) to access your contacts, you need to get the data into Apple's storage container.\nUntil Microsoft puts Outlook on speaking terms with iCloud, you may use SyncServices to Sync Outlook contacts with the Apple Address Book. From within Outlook:\n\nOn the Tools tab, click Sync Services.\nIn the left pane, select the check box for Contacts.\nUnder Select the accounts to sync, choose the account or accounts that\n  you want to sync for the selected item type.\nNote The On My Computer account includes all Outlook items that are\n  not synchronized with a Microsoft Exchange account.\nOn the Outlook folder to add new items to pop-up menu, choose the\n  location in Outlook where you want new items to be saved. \"New\" items\n  are those that are added first in a different application or device,\n  and then synced to Outlook.\nClose the Sync Services dialog box, and then on the confirmation\n  message, click OK.\n\n\nBe certain Outlook is fully up-to-date because there were reports of problems with syncing using earlier versions under OS 10.7 Lion.\n", "Q: OS X Text to Speech apps This may be a broad question, but I think the lack of widespread interest in text-to-speech warrants it:\nWhat are some apps for OS X that do novel things with text-to-speech; i.e., more than just take some text and speak it?\nOne example might be an app that has a \"rewind 30 seconds\" feature, or highlights the word currently being spoken in an on-screen document, has a hotkey I can press to \"bookmark\" the word currently being spoken, etc.\n\nA: I don't know all of Text-To-Speech programs out there, but I think the current state of this technology is still a little behind.\nOnly the \"standard\" sentences, i.e. the most common ones, will be spoken with a good intonation. But in general, more or less, programs will behave like robots when pronouncing words.\nRegarding the features you asked, anyway, GhostReader does the job and is actually fairly good at pronouncing. Although I'm not sure about the last thing you asked. The program is commercial but has a trial period. You can download single language packages from the site and load them from the program itself.\nI was going to suggest Toau as well, but it doesn't have those features you ask, it's pretty basic. The advantages of this app is that it's free, and the interface is simple. The disadvantage is that it uses the Mac OS X library for language packages. When you want to change a language, it will take you to System Preferences, and you'll choose the language there. This is why it's not my first suggestion, while on the other program, you downloaded specific packages.\n\nA: I am actually starting to do an in-depth review of the major text to speech softwares (I'll be posting on my youtube channel, though I haven't started reviewing yet). Here are a few that you might be interested in looking into (most are free or have free trials and all of them can play, pause, skip and go faster):\n\n\n*\n\n*Speechify: free, uses RSVP and is absolutely awesome, but is a bit glitchy because it's not finished.\n\n*Capti: Highlights sentences, etc.\n\n*Voice Dream reader (I hear it has great voices and a good interface)\n\n", "Q: Detect single-user mode from the command line Is there a way to detect single-user mode in OSX (Lion, specifically) from the command line?\nI've tried who -r, which returns 3 in either standard or single-user mode.\nI've also tried nvram boot-args, which does not work either.\nGoogle isn't helping much with this...\n\nA: $ sysctl -n kern.singleuser\n0\n\nIt's 1 when booted in single-user mode, 0 when not.\n\nA: Hmm. We don't have runlevel in OS X*, which would be the easy way. How about identifying something in the output of launchctl list which is not present in single user mode but is present otherwise - com.apple.Finder might be a candidate.\n*man who includes: -r    Print the current runlevel.

If a second hard drive is mounted in the optical drive bay of a MacBook Pro, will it be affected by the Energy Saver setting for \"Put the hard disk(s) to sleep when possible\"?\nIf it is affected, is there a way I can instruct the OS to sleep one drive, but not the other?\n\nA: Yes it does. The OWC blog talks about this and shows a terminal tip to set spin-down time to a shorter delay, saving a bit more power. \nWhen you think about it the disk is still on the SATA bus - no reason it shouldn't spin down. I don't think you can address each drive individually though.\nA cumbersome solution is to eject the disk when you no longer need it. But then you can't unplug/replug it like you would for an external drive. To remount it, in terminal you would do:\ndiskutil list\n\ndiskutil mountDisk /dev/disk1\n\nI experimented with my Time Machine drive to see if this works. Your optical bay drive may well be /dev/disk1, but that's why you did diskutil list - to see what its identifier is.\n(Rebooting will remount the drive too, if you forget the diskutil command)\n", "Q: Why wont iTunes detect my new iPhone 4S? When I connect my iPhone 4S to my computer (OSX v 10.4.11), iTunes (9.2  61) does not detect the device.

You can delete your audio track now.\n\nYou will probably want to quantize your notes too, which makes notes start on the beat. You can do this by viewing the generated MIDI region in the Editor panel, selecting all of the notes, and choosing a beat size in Time Quantize at the left. Or you could do it earlier in the process, with the Time Quantize section next to the Flex Pitch editor.\n\n\nA: I don't have Logic installed right now, but it should have something like that built in. Just select Audio to Score… from the context menu for an audio clip, see Advanced Functions in Logic Pro 8 : How to Use Factory Audio to Score in Logic Pro 8.\n", "Q: When an iPhone app is updated and the minimum required iOS increases, what happens for customers who still have the lower iOS? For example, I'm a developer, and my app is released with a minimum iOS of 3.0 required.  If I release an update requiring iOS 5.0, what happens?\nCan existing customers running 3.0 attempt to update?  What error message (if any) do they receive when attempting this?\nWill customers running 3.0 get the 'Update' notification in their app store app?\n\nA: When the user tries to install the update, the app store will alert the user saying something like \"you must have iOS5 to install this update.\". The user will still be able to use the current version they they have, though.\n\nA: Nothing. The app doesn't create any problem until it is deleted. To be re-installed, it requires update, after being deleted once.\n\nA: As a user, I've found that iTunes downloads the latest app regardless of what iOS the user is using on their device. \niTunes downloads the latest app and deletes (or asks to delete) older app versions from the user's iTunes library – an unwary user will click Yes to deleting the older version, and will be happy to get the latest version.\nIt is only when the user tries to install this latest version on their device (after removing the older app from their device) that iTunes will then raise the alarm that it is not compatible with their device.\nThe user is then left without the older version or the update.\nIt is Apple's hope that the user has backed up their iTunes library prior to downloading updates to their apps. This is a different procedure than just using iTunes to back up their devices, which only backs up the Data on the users' devices and not their apps purchased (downloaded) through iTunes.\nIf the user doesn't have a backup, Apple does not maintain older versions of apps. So the user has no means of retrieving older versions from the App Store.\n", "Q: On iPad's iBooks, how to make highlighting show up for PDF files? It seems that on iPad, iBooks, Kindle, or Kobo won't show any user highlightings?\nFor example, just go to https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Introduction/introObjectiveC.html and you will see at the top right corner to download the PDF file.  Right click and save it into your Mac or PC, and use Acrobat 10 or Mac's Preview to highlight the word \"Objective-C\" on the frontpage of the file.  We can close and re-open the file to see the highlighting.\nNow use DropBox or Box.net and transfer the file to iPad's iBooks (I am using the New iPad (3rd Gen)).

However, there are many 3rd party apps like iAnnotate PDF, GoodReader, or PDFpen that support PDF highlighting and annotating. I use GoodReader and I can personally verify that PDF highlights that were made on Mac's Preview do show up on the GoodReader iPad app.\n\nI also tested the DropBox iPad app and PDF highlights do not show up. \nHopefully, Apple will add PDF highlighting to a future version of iBooks. If enough people request this feature at the Apple feedback site, maybe they will add it in the near future. \n\nA: PDF reader gives highlighting but \n(1)in iBooks we can get the meaning for the hard words.\n(2)pages are separate \nand gives a pleasant experience.\nI request the apple to provide highlight in iBooks.\n\nA: if you download your reading material as an ebook you and open it in books instead of pdf, you can highlight and underline in ibooks. you can also define words and make notes\n\nA: It's been 10 years and still there's no option to see PDF highlights in Books app on iOS...

Some time ago, I installed Sophos Antivirus on my Macbook Pro running Snow Leopard and came up against the \"computer stops responding after reboot, with Sophos Antivirus installed and FileVault enabled\" issues. This required me to forcibly power-off the computer by holding down the power button on every restart and having to boot into single user mode to manually remove the application files before I could use the computer again.\nHas the situation changed with the latest version of Sophos Antivirus (version 8 at time of writing). Is anyone successfully using it on Lion with (legacy) FileVault enabled? I'd like to try again, but would obviously prefer not to encounter the above problems.\n\nA: You need to increase the number of on-demand scanner threads, to prevent a deadlock when you log in if you have a number of things all trying to start at once.\nRun the following, from Terminal:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.sophos.sav WorkerThreads -int 20\n\n(20 works for me, with the number of applications that I have set to launch at login time)\n", "Q: VNC Viewer with clipboard sync I need to connect to Ubuntu Vinegar VNC and Windows UltraVNC.  I can't find one that sync's the clipboard so I can past from my Macbook to the others OS.  It works fine Windows to Ubuntu and vise versa so the VNC servers are fine.\nA low cost solution would be preferred as my countries currency is a quarter of the value of the US$.\n\nA: Jollys Fast VNC\nIt attempts to keep the clipboards in sync and for the most part it does a very good job of it. Not all objects copied to the clipboard on one machine can be used on another though. For example: copying a file the clipboard just puts a lean file object in the clipboard which has no parallel on the remote machine.\nBut for text and such it works great.\nThere's a free trial (that continually renews itself) and you can buy it in the MAS as well for not a lot of money (there's a \"home\" version for even less).\n\n\nA: TeamViewer supports Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, and has great support for remote actions, file transfers, and native clipboard exchanges.  I've never used TV for clipboards with remote Linux systems but it's definitely been better than any VNC solutions I've used.

Both there are a default English-English dictionary, which is convenient.\nHowever, I'd prefer a French-English dictionary, while I'm learning French on iPhone or Mac. \nIs there a way to change the default dictionary on iPhone or Mac, to a French-English one?\n\nA: In order to change the priority on your Dictionary App, go do Dictionary > Preferences.\nChoose the dictionaries you want to be activated — assuming you have them installed — and drag them to choose the priority, *from top (highest priority) to bottom.\nNote that if you look for a word in a certain language, dictionaries that don't have that word won't appear in the search results.\n\nChange localization on your Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > International > Languages.\n\n*Click on \"Edit list\" to add/remove the dictionaries.\n\n*Drag the dictionaries in the list itself to sort the priority which works from top to bottom.\n\n\nA: And on your iPhone:  \nYou can enable the French language in your Keyboard settings. Then, when tapping the globe next to your spacebar, you can switch languages. The language will shortly appear on your spacebar, and from then on, you'll be using the just selected language with a dictionary. \n\n\nA: The link is broken - please look at some upvoted answers below as well\nAssuming you are talking about the reference dictionary for looking up the meanings of words (NOT spellchecking/autocorrection), you cannot modify that on an iOS device.

I want to find some music videos and rename them, but I can't figure out how to do that?\nI am using iPhone 4S - iOS 5.0.1 - a jailbroken phone and using iFile And iFunBox.\n\nA: I don't believe it is possible to rename the title of the Music video. The workaround would be this (NOTE: This does involve using a paid Cydia package, Bridge ($1.99)):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Cydia and search for \"Bridge\". Buy it, install it, respring.\n\n*Navigate to /var/mobile/Media/iTunes_Control/Music via iFile (or SSH Client of choice)\n\n*\n\n*This is where your music, music videos and movies are stored on iOS.\n\n\n*Tap on the gear icon in the left lower corner, go to File Manager > Search Format and change it to Wildcard if not already selected.\n\n*Go back to File Manager and turn on \"Song Titles\" if not already on. Press Done in the upper right corner.\n\n*Swipe up to reveal the search field, select \"Hierarchy\" and type \"*.m4v\"\n\n*\n\n*NOTE: If your video files are not M4V, then you would type their extension in it's place eg. *.AVI or *.MP4.\n\n*This should search all of the subfolders (F01, F02…) for any video files.\n\n\n*Unfortunately iTunes names them things like \"AAWA.mp3\", that is why we turned on song titles. It should display the title above the file name for the video.\n\n*Once you find the file, note it's location in case you mess up the next step:\n\n*Long press over it and choose \"Select\".\n\n*Tap the clipboard in the lower right corner and select copy.\n\n*Navigate to /var/mobile/Documents/Downloads and paste the video.\n\n*Go to Bridge on the home screen and navigate to /var/mobile/Documents/Downloads\n\n*Choose the video file to import, on the info page select \"Music Video\" and choose a title for it.\n\n*Tap import and you should be all set! :-)\n\n\nIt is quite a long and convoluted way to rename a video file, but it is possible (sort of!).\n\nA: If you have jailbroken your iPhone, I would recommend installing openSSH.\nI don't know how to locate the files using iFile or iFunbox, but you install openSSH you can log onto your device using a SSH/FTP client, and your movie files should be placed at:\n/user/media/dcim/\n\nI use WinSCP (http://winscp.net/eng/download.php) to FTP to my iPhone.\n", "Q: How to compile apps with g77 on OS X Lion?

I don't want to turn the feature off altogether, I just want to prevent auto-update.  I know this may seem like an attempt to defeat the purpose of Top Sites in the first place, but I find that if it auto-updates any of the Top Sites that are forum-based, all of the unread topics are marked as read.  So, an even better solution would be the ability to exclude the auto-update of certain URLs/domains, etc.  Does that functionality exist?\n\nA: I found this somwhere else which may solve your problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Safari\n\n*Open Terminal (Applications/Utilities) & paste:\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari DebugSnapshotsUpdatePolicy -int 2\n\nthen hit return & quit Terminal.\nTo reactivate:\ndefaults delete com.apple.Safari DebugSnapshotsUpdatePolicy\n\n\nA: To disable TopSites, quit Safari, open Terminal and type or paste:\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari DebugSafari4IncludeTopSites false\nPress Return key.

In the interim, I've set up hot corners, but it's also clunky, because my MacBook is 13\" and the remote machine is a 27\" iMac. \n\nA: Screen Sharing.app's support is pretty limited; while its never ideal to rely upon a third-party solution, you might want to check out the excellent TeamViewer.

Ist it possible to see the settings of my known WLANs stored on my iPhone? I only know that I can access the settings of the current network when I am logged into one.\nEdit: The iPhone is not jailbroken and I do not intend to jailbreak it.\n\nA: As mentioned by others, jailbreaking is the easiest way. But if you really don't want to, you can back up the iPhone and use a tool like Backup Extractor to view the .db file that stores the settings.\n\nA: No you can't, unless you jailbreak.\nHowever, jailbreaking is now so easy and painless that there really is little reason not to do it.

In the next few days I'll have to reinstall my Mac OS/ Snow Leopard computer.\nI'm trying to figure out what to backup first. I’m not talking about the user data but rather OS specific things like in windows ini files, applications settings, some of the registry entries etc.  I'm rather a windows guy and all the Mac stuff is a bit new form me.\nThe plan is to use a clean install and not the “Archive and Install” option, I’ve read how it works but am not sure how to use such archive anyway. I also plan to do a full OS backup with the TimeMachine in case something goes terribly wrong :) no plans to use it otherwise.\nSo far I plan to back up the following items (the plan is to restore them all manually, after the install):\n\n\n*\n\n*OS usernames and passwords,\n\n*Network configuration,\n\n*Browsers bookmarks (FF, Safari, Chrome, Opera),\n\n*Users home folders (just in case, have no plans to use them afterwards really, should be deleted a few days after the reinstall as soon as I know everything works smoothly and I’m not missing any private data),\n\n*Xcode developer profiles,\n\n*Passwords, keys and certificates from Keychain Access app,\n\n*Deauthorize the computer in iTunes.\n\n\nAm I missing something?\n\nA: You will find that TimeMachine is generally inclusive as far as selecting data to back up.  If you take a stock TimeMachine configuration and don't omit anything (supposing your disk is large enough) you will be able to\n\n\n*\n\n*Perform the backup\n\n*Remove the backup disk\n\n*Wipe the disk\n\n*Reinstall the OS\n\n*Reattach the backup disk\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nAnd all should go smoothly.  In the initial configuration dialog on rebooting, you will find a page that asks you if you want to migrate your data, of which one of the options will be from a TM backup.  This will result in a very cleanly migrated system with very little changed as far as the individual user goes.\nBut your question was more specific:  Are there data files that you should specifically opt-in for a Mac Backup?  Yes.\n\n\n*\n\n*Applications folder \nPrior to TimeMachine, I would always kick myself for forgetting the /Applications folder in my backups.  Mac apps generally don't modify items in sub-directories of the Applications folder, so if you're trying to get out of a potential corrupted Application, there's little to be concerned of.  TimeMachine by default includes this.\n\n*Application Support/Preferences\nVarying heavily from application to application, but generally, most applications look to the ~/Library/Preferences/ and ~/Library/Application Support/ folders for configuration and \"temporary\" files.  This will accomodate #3 on your list.  TimeMachine by default includes this.\nYou will likely find that TimeMachine is very capable as a method to make a non-bootable shadow copy for archiving purposes.  If you use it, you should have no issues retrieving any old data ex-post (barring external forces like a bad drive etc.)\n", "Q: App Store asking for credentials?

Or could it be because someone tried logging in with my account several times and failed?\n\nA: This appears to be a recent change to how purchasing functions, added for increased security. According to TheNextWeb, via MacRumors:\n\nIn the past 24 hours, Apple appears to have started prompting iOS\n  devices owners and those with Apple IDs within iTunes to make their\n  accounts more secure, requiring them to pick three security questions\n  and enter their answers when they download a new app. \nThe company is also asking users to enter a backup email address, in\n  order to better protect their device but also their account (which is\n  tied to Apple’s Retail website and all of its media services).\n\n", "Q: How to default to \"Not open all the apps again\" on Mac OS X Lion? On Mac OS X Lion, whenever the computer is to be turned off or restarted, the default is that \"Open all apps\" again after the next start up, and the user has to \"uncheck\" the box so that the apps won't run automatically.\nBut every time, I have to uncheck that box.  Is there a way to default to not to run those apps next time?\n\nA: This OSXDaily article Disable “Reopen Windows When Logging Back In” in Mac OS X Lion Completely describes a method of doing this.\n\nYou may have noticed that when you log out or reboot Mac OS X Lion,\n  you get a dialog window with a checkbox next to “Reopen windows when\n  logging back in” that restores all of your currently open applications\n  and windows.\nIf you don’t like it and you’re tired of unchecking the box to no\n  longer reopen the windows, you can use a third party script to render\n  the feature useless. To clarify, what this does is disable the feature\n  completely on a constant basis, regardless of whether that checkbox to\n  preserve windows is checked or not, the windows will not restore.\n\nType the following command to download the script, place it in the appropriate location, make it executable, run it, then remove it:  \ncurl http://goo.gl/Z4EFC -L -s -o ~/fixlogin.sh && md5 -q ~/fixlogin.sh | xargs -I % mv ~/fixlogin.sh ~/%.sh && chmod +x ~/121dca51e66073624da420b6e1be61d9.sh && sudo ~/121dca51e66073624da420b6e1be61d9.sh ; rm ~/121dca51e66073624da420b6e1be61d9.sh\n\nThe content of the script is for those who want to know what's being executed and/or do it manually is:\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"#!/bin/bash\" > /tmp/loginfix.sh\necho \"rm /Users/*/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow.*\" >> /tmp/loginfix.sh\nmv /tmp/loginfix.sh /usr/bin/loginfix.sh\nchmod +x /usr/bin/loginfix.sh\ndefaults write com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook /usr/bin/loginfix.sh\n\nFinally, if you want to go back to normal resume behaviour type:\nsudo defaults delete com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook\n\n", "Q: Smart Cover on/off no longer functioning After only 4 months of use my Smart Cover no longer turns my iPad off/on. Apple in Brasil says they are not the manufactures, so I would need to look for XDA.\nHow can I fix or exchange it?\n\nA: Go to \"Settings\" and then \"General\" and verify that the \"iPad Cover Lock / Unlock\" feature is turned on. If this feature is enabled and the issue still persists I would suggest you test out your iPad with a different smart to verify the issue isn't with the iPad itself.\nIs your smart cover an Apple branded smart cover or third party? I only ask because Apple would not decline you replacement support unless the smart cover is question is not their product. \n", "Q: Weird hotspot password on iPhone after it was replaced by Apple Today I got my iPhone replaced by Apple as it was presenting some weird symptoms.\nI upgraded the iOS and restored from backup but few hours later I discovered that the hotspot password was replaced with something I never wrote soaked4963.\nIs this a bug in their iOS upgrade and/or restore mechanism?\n\nA: iOS auto-generates a hotspot password by default, mine is a word followed by four digits, just like yours. I suspect that the hotspot password just isn't backed up, so the new phone created a new default one.\nIt's not an issue really, just replace it with whatever you want. If you want to keep the old one to avoid re-entering it on your devices, but don't remember it, you should be able to find it by going into Keychain Access (Applications > Utilities) on a Mac that connected previously. Double click on the entry corresponding to the hotspot name, and there should be a checkbox for \"Show password\".\n\nA: If you use encrypted backups, your backup will store your passwords (email etc, including the hot spot password).  If you do not use encrypted backups, you need to reenter all passwords, including the hot spot one, which will be reentered by a random one as explained by CanuckSkier.\n", "Q: Can the iCloud apps backup of an iPhone be restored to a different iPhone? The main or phone backup of my iPhone happened to my PC, but I had iCloud backup enabled for a number of apps (like WhatsApp, and others).\nMy iPhone crashed and burned last week and Apple gave me a new iPhone, and even though I named it the same, and used the same AppleID on the new phone, it obviously has a different serial number and IMEI.\nMy question is if I can in some way restore the applications backup of my previous phone (that are on iCloud) to my new phone? Again, I'm not talking about a full restore of the phone from an iCloud backup, but only retrieve the application data (chats, etc) that my previous iPhone had backed up to iCloud.\n\nA: If you want to restore your data to your new phone, you most certainly can; that is the point for have iTunes/iCloud backups. But you cannot select what data you wish to restore from backup, regardless if its an iCloud or iTunes local backup.\nI suggest you restore your backup to your new phone and then manually remove any applications and data that you do not wish to keep on it. Otherwise, you are forced to start with a brand new phone without any data from your previous phone.\n\nA: Yes. I've done this many times.\nThe iCloud restore process deposits the sandboxed saved application data, but not the application package itself.\nAs a second step, you can sign into the store to re-download the apps (or connect to iTunes to transfer the apps) so that it matches the data, but I see no reason why you can't get at the data using whatever tool can read the filesystem such as a jailbreak or PhoneView.\n", "Q: Any better way to purge the inactive memory? Running purge command in the terminal to free the inactive memory isn't really what I think about Apple.  \nLion isn't doing a great at all when it comes to free the inactive memory.\nFree memory is reaching 16 MB and applications and the OS are becoming unresponsive, yet OS X isn't reclaiming the inactive memory.\nAfter each session, I put the laptop to sleep.

Unixes after all aren't created to be rebooted.\nOS X Snow Leopard was pretty sleek, I don't know but it looks it is a Lion thing (maybe due iOS brought to Lion features).  \nAny better way to reclaim the inactive memory on Lion?\n[EDIT]\nI got 4 GB of RAM\n\nA: Yes, you can, one command only (run in Terminal):\npurge\n\nAnd recheck inactive RAM\n\nA: The real way I've made progress diagnosing this sort of issue is to use sysdiagnose to profile your system immediately after boot, then again before swap starts to get written and again when you note the slowdown.\nIssuing purge is not effective with OS X virtual memory on Lion and muddies the waters to find the real culprit in terms of memory leaks or paging stress.\nI've found that server Macs are generally stable for 6 months or more and don't need reboots before an update will force a reboot. Client Macs running software like Office, Adobe and even some of Apple's consumer products (or Pro apps) do not run perpetually like other UNIX and benefit from a reboot once a month or so to clear memory if you have issues with swap that cannot be isolated and ameliorated by sysdiagnose or other changes in usage.\n\nA: Probably not much better than what you are doing but I use iboostup occasionally when i wan t to free up some memory.  I constantly struggling here with 2gb MBA and i use vmaware fusion for windows machine that just takes the memory from me. It has a couple other nice features too.\nhttp://www.iboostup.com/\n\nA: There are free apps on the Mac App Store that add a free-memory button to the menu bar for quick memory purging.\nSearch for \"memory\" in the MAS and choose what suits your needs.\nHope this is what you are looking for.\n", "Q: How can I use a TP-LINK WiFi USB interface in OS X Lion? I happen to have a TP-LINK TL-WN821N (it's a WiFi USB stick) around. Is there any chance to get that working on a Mac mini running OS X Lion?\nThere are no official drivers but it seems there are some kind of drivers for the ATHEROS AR9170+AR9102 chipset from other vendors like Ralink.\n\nA: Update: The below hack worked when using D-Link's DWA-130 Rev.

I would like to make one of my calendars in 'ical' available to one person for at least reading.  If that is not possible, I would like to publish the calendar.  Apple's website fails to explain these necessary steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I publish a calendar that responds to my newly added schedule items;\n\n*How do I inform the other person(s) how to access the calendar;\n\n*How do I know that that other person has even looked at the calendar even once? (aside from asking them in person)\n\n*Does the Macbookpro calendar even 'play well' with dissimilar devices, say the iPad, or the iPhone that this other person might be using?\n\n*Is it even possible for people using a conventional browser on a non-Mac device to access such a calendar.\n\n\nI'm set up on iCloud to share such things as photos, calendars, etc.\n\nA: *\n\n*Make sure you have Calendar set for sharing in the System Preferences > Mail Contacts & Calendars > iCloud\n\n*Confirm that System Preferences > iCloud similarly sets 'Calerndars' to share\n\n*Login to your iCloud www page (or at least set it up);\n\n*Select 'Calendar' from the WWW page;\n\n*Pick the one Calendar you want to share from the left hand side of the WWW page;\n\n*In the following dialog, click the [email] button and enter the email address with whom you want to share.  The email does not necessarily have to be coupled to an Apple Account/ID.\n\n\nOptional steps:\n7.  Check that you are able to get 'cc:'d on that outgoing email that 'invites' the other to join in sharing;\n8.  Add a calendar entry;\n9.  Ask your friend to check visibility of new entry on iPad\n10.  Ditto for all other Apple devices.\nWhen Apple's 'iCloud' makes the Calendar available for sharing, a Green Icon appears just to the right of the name of the Calendar.  This icon means the calendar has been made available.  It doesn't mean that anybody has actually looked at the calendar.\nOn your friends side, they should perform the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open their email, and if necessary, check the Trash or Spam folders to find your invitation;\n\n*Accept;\n\n*Open their Calendar application, iCal;\n\n*Make sure that the 'visibility' of your calendar is toggled 'ON' with a check in the box appearing at the brown top margin on the left by clicking [Calendars];\n\n*It wouldn't hurt to have them try to add a calendar entry in a reciprocal manner to the same Calendar to see if you can see it.\n\n*If you are having trouble still, check that their Settings-> Mail, Contacts, Calendars -> iCloud is set to swap Calendars with the iCloud\n\n\nIf you have a falling out or otherwise part ways with your friend, you can easily 'unpublish' your calendar (or even just stop updating it) from within the iCloud website.\nFor extra credit, try to see if you can get the receiving device to 'ping' in response to new calendar entries.  This would be similar to push notifications.\nGo to the receiving person's iPad Settings-> Notifications -> Calendar to get Badges and Alerts set to 'on'\nIn \"Settings->Mail, Contacts, Calendars->Fetch New Data\" you can setup what to do.  iCloud-> 'Push' seems to be fastest.\nAs per Q3, above, it seems that you still have to ask the person if they've accepted the invite and looked at a calendar entry.  MacBookPro plays well with iPad. I tested this out.  Not clear how well the published calendar works with PC users.\n\nA: The Apple Knowledge Base has an article on how to use iCal basics, and includes a Publish your calendar section. A few things they don't accurately specify:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on Calendars in the top-left corner, and then secondary-click on the calendar you'd like to share, and select Share\n\n*Choose a name and a sharing method\n\n*If you made the calendar public, you'll need to copy the URL and share that via email, IM etc.\n\n\nYou can't say if they have looked at the calendar or not. But they will be able to see the calendar on any device where they have an application that supports the CalDAV protocol—which means they need to use Google Calendar, iCloud via a browser etc. to subscribe to it. This should generally not be a problem.\n\nA: How do I publish a calendar that responds to my newly added schedule items;\nCovered above.\nHow do I inform the other person(s) how to access the calendar;\nWhen you invite someone it sends them an email with instructions\nHow do I know that that other person has even looked at the calendar even once? (aside from asking them in person)\nWhen you go to the sharing properties it'll show you if they've accepted the share and are subscribing. After that, you'll have to ask.\nDoes the Macbookpro calendar even 'play well' with dissimilar devices, say the iPad, or the iPhone that this other person might be using?\nYes, it syncs with iCloud and is easy to use across iPads, iPhones, etc. I have mine shared with my wife across a couple of Macs, iPhones, etc. It's all very easy to use.\nIs it even possible for people using a conventional browser on a non-Mac device to access such a calendar.\nYes: http://www.icloud.com That does assume they're sharing it into their own iCloud account, but the interface is largely similar to the Mac and iPad/iPhone apps. Even down the color of the calendar, etc. \n", "Q: How do I deal with an automatic reboot following a cydia app install The tethered RedSnOw jailbreak for 5.1 worked like a charm.  I ran into a problem when I installed winterboard however.  Following the automatic reboot, I couldn't get my iPhone into DFU mode to use the \"just reboot\" function.  What am I doing wrong?  \n\nA: Well, good news for you. As from a few weeks ago, you are able to jailbreak your iOS 5.1 untethered, which eliminates the fact you've to \"just-boot\" the iPhone very time.\nIn order to do so, Jailbreak nation has published a very detailed and good tutorial on how to jailbreak your iPhone. I suggest you preform a untetheredjailbreak and try again. If things are still not working, please give some feedback with your errors so we can help you further.\nGood luck!\n\nA: There shouldn't be anything different about getting your device into DFU mode after a Cydia-initiated reboot compared to a normal reboot.\nGenerally if people have trouble getting into DFU mode, the causes can include: not having the latest version of iTunes installed, using a USB hub/a bad USB cable/a bad USB port, holding the buttons for the wrong amount of time (or pressing them too hard sometimes), or having faulty buttons.\n\nA: Restore your iphone/ipod to 5.1 then jailbreak it again.\n", "Q: Does the \"Find my iPad\" service work without WiFi when you aren't paying for cellular service? If I'm not paying for cellular service on my 4G iPad, and it's not in range of a WiFi network it knows about (or is open), then will the Find My iPad service still work through the cellular network? I notice that I can sign up for service without being in a WiFi area when I haven't already purchased service, and it still tracks what type of cellular network I'm attached to and the signal strength when I'm not paying for cellular service.\nIt would be nice if Apple and the carriers threw in Find My iPad for free so that even if I lose it (or it's stolen) in a month I'm not paying for service then I can still find it.\nUnfortunately, I already activated my service recently, so I have to wait another few weeks before I can test it.\n\nA: No, you can get an app like NetStat and see the ports that open when WiFi is connected as well as when data is available, but not connected.\nThe carriers would know where it was since their cell towers would have a fix on the IMEI (or equivalent for non GSM carriers) - but that database isn't integrated into the Find My Phone service in any way we can see.\nYou are correct that the hardware talks with base stations that are near by and it would be nice (kind of like 911 service is permitted even when a line is inactive) for consumers to have this work without respect to billing status.\n", "Q: Thunderbolt to VGA monitor blank in Boot Camp Windows 7 I have a 22\" external monitor connected to my MacBook Pro (late 2011) via Thunderbolt to VGA. When I boot into Windows 7 x64, the screen seems to work and is mirrored during the boot screens, then it goes blank at the login screen. It stays blank after I log in to Windows. The built-in screen on the laptop works fine.\nThe monitor works fine in OS X Lion.\n\nA: Note that it appears the Thunderbolt may work a bit differently on Windows in Bootcamp than it does on the same computer when running OS X. As noted below on Thunderbolt ports and displays: Frequently asked questions (FAQ)\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Why isn't my device recognized when I plug it directly into the Thunderbolt port when running Windows 7 via BootCamp?\n  \n  \n  Windows 7 scans and activates devices connected to the Thunderbolt port only during the startup process. If a device isn't connected when the computer starts up, Windows 7 will not recognize the device. Restart the computer with the device connected to the port. Thunderbolt devices may also need a driver when running on Windows 7.\n\nAdditionally after trying the above, you may need to manually activate and configure the 2nd display in Windows 7, it may not automatically configure and turn on with the first connection attempt.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make Sure you have the Apple Provided BootCamp Drivers installed. \n\n*Right click on the Windows 7 Desktop, click on \"Screen resolution\".\n\n*From there you may need to click on \"Detect\" and further configure the add on displays resolution and so on.\nIf the above does not work it appears that there may be some driver issues with the graphics card drivers in Bootcamp that may be causing issues with the Thunderbolt a.k.a. the Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter. There are quite a few discussion occuring on Apple's Support forms  and on the internet dealing with this issue. One solution found:\n\nFinally solved the external display resolution problem. \nJust purchased a new Core 2 Duo, MacBook Pro, 15.4'' display with the NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT video card. Loaded Windows7 32-bit with BootCamp 3.0 and then upgraded the Windows NVIDIA video driver with the latest NVIDIA driver (version 196.75) from www.laptopvideo2go.com. Side note: Before updating the NVIDIA driver, I also loaded all of the laptop drivers in Windows with the MacBook recovery disk and completed all Windows updates. I then ran into the same resolution disply problem everyone here is having, which is why I ended up here...\nSolution:\n1) Update BootCamp from 3.0 to 3.1 (http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/).\n2) Uninstall NVIDIA 196.75 driver and the accompanying NVIDIA software bundle.\n3) Install NVIDIA 195.81 driver bundle with the modified INF file - downloaded from www.laptopvideo2go.com.\n4) Display works perfectly and tested the solution on 3 difference projectors. \n\nIf all else fails I recommend contacting Apple and letting them know of the issue so that they can develop a fix or workaround for it.\n\nA: I just disabled DisplayPort 1.2 on the screens and it started working on My bootcamp partition.\n3 screens.\nHope it helps.\nTiago\n\nA: FIXED\nI have a MacBook Pro and Windows 8 installed using Bootcamp.\nI could not get my second monitor to work (connected using the Thunderbolt port to DVI connector on the monitor)\nHere is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*identified graphics card by booting into Mac OS, click on the apple icon (top left) >about this mac >more info.

I am not talking about connecting a VGA monitor to a Mac. I'm referring to plugging in a VGA output in to my Mac. I want the VGA to show up as a video device, so that I can run a projector's feed through UStream. \nWhat hardware is needed to digitize a VGA input in real time to send for broadcast?\n\nA: I use a product from http://xlr8.com/ to give me a video input on my mac, then use a VGA-to-TV adapter to stream powerpoint over ustream.  Video is really choppy and crappy looking, but for simple non-moving slides, it's OK for ustream. \n\nA: You need a product like this:\nKVM Console to USB 2.0 Portable Laptop Crash Cart Adapter\nHowever I don't know if that will show up as a streamable device (or if it's even compatible with Mac). There are also people who have had success buying a webcam and a VGA > Analogue adapter, and wiring the analogue adapter into the webcams electronics to get it back into the computer.\nUnfortunately, no real \"easy\" solution exists.\n", "Q: How do iPads detect when a cover closes? Some iPad cases (particularly those that look like book covers) provide a feature that when the cover closes the iPad enters suspended mode and when the cover opens the iPad wakes up. The one provided by the link claims it provides this functionality through a magnetic strip. Does this mean iPads have the ability to sense nearby magnetic fields built in? Why and how does this work?\nPS. It appears Apple's Smart Covers provide this functionality too.\n\nA: The Smart Cover has a magnet that interacts with the sleep sensor of an iPad. So whenever you close the Smart Cover, iPad will know when to sleep. The same theory for waking up.\nInfo from MacRumors\n\nA: Magnetic Auto sleep/wake function is mainly used in electronic device cases, such as Kindles, iPods and so on... To make this easier to understand, let's focus on an iPad.  For this  to work, the device cover needs to be held on to the iPad with magnets. These magnets don't just keep the iPad case on but it also aligns the magnets with the ones inside the iPad.\nThere are 21 magnets in the case and 10 magnets in this device itself. Some of those magnets are used to hold the case on, whilst others are used to activate the \"sleep sensor\" which you can find on the right hand side of the iPad. It was also found out that the device does not need to be woken up by 31 magnets, but can be woken up by a single 'magnetic pickup stick'. This is because to wake the device up, or put it to sleep, all you need to do is activate the sleep sensor.\n", "Q: Why does software update re check after updates are installed when you show updates When updates are available you have the choice of install or show details.  When you click install the updates are installed then you have to close the updater.  When you click show details then install after the update it checks again for updates then shows you the updates you just installed but they are unchecked.\nIs this just a flaw in the UI or is there some reason for this?  How come the updater doesn't alert you after the install then close itself.  This has always really annoyed me for some reason.\n\nA: It appears that some updates have others as prerequisites, and will not show up as available until the others are installed. Thus, Software Update makes a list of all eligible updates, then runs. If a subsequent update was also pending that was not eligible to be downloaded because its prerequisite has not not yet been installed, that update would not make the list. The subsequent check, however, would see if any new updates had been unlocked by the updates installed.\n", "Q: How to force a screen resolution on my MacBook Pro? I have a MacBook Pro, bought 3 years ago, I'm not sure of the model, but the processor is a 2.66 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, with 4 GB of RAM, nVidia 9400M 256M. I am using MacOS 10.6.6.\nNext week I will do a presentation in a conference, and they suggest to use a 1280 x 720 resolution, as the conference will be recorded using the 16:9 format.\nUnfortunately, when I want to change the resolution of my screen on my laptop (System preferences > Displays > Screen resolutions), it does not provide this resolution. I can use 1024 x 768 which is the \"backup\" resolution for the conference, but not the suggested resolution.\nSo my question: is there a way to force such resolution on my MBP?\n\nA: If you connect it to a display that offers 1280 x 720 as a resolution, then it should give you that as an option. You need to test it with the display that you will be using at the conference, which is always a good idea.\n\nA: edit \n/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist\nadd these lines, save & reboot.\n<key>Graphics Mode</key>\n<string>1280x720x32</string>\n\nto edit com.apple.boot.plist you may have to copy it to your desktop first, edit it and then put it back to where it was, overwriting the original file\n", "Q: Is there any iOS offline maps app which also supports searching for an address offline? Is there any iOS map app that works completely without WiFi/3G connection and supports (at a minimum) viewing your current location (on GPS-equipped iOS devices) and searching for an address? My intended use case scenario is mostly navigating around on foot in a foreign city.\nI tried Navfree but it seems to require a data connection to search for an address (and is also mostly meant for car navigation). I didn't try Galileo yet, but the website only mentions “online search” for the free version; it's not clear whether the paid version features offline search.\n\nA: MapsWithMe does that. Available for iPhone/iPad and Android. MapsWithMe Pro for iPhone has offline search. Not an address search though, i.e. you can search for a street, city, restaurant or POI, but not for city+street or street+POI.\n\nA: To answer the first part of your question; yes, there is an app which will provide you with offline maps. \nThere is OpenMaps (my favorite). Here you can download your maps online (when you're at home) and when you're offline, you can make a route to a pinpoint you've created. It will calculate the route by itself. And it's free too.\nAnd, if you've jailbroken your iPhone, you can install Offline Maps. Which will pretty much to the same as OpenMaps.\n\nA: Thanks to the answers to this question and related questions on this site, I found and wound up trying three different offline map apps which also support offline search. All three offer the basic features of downloading maps for a certain region, viewing your current location and searching for nearby street names and points of interest. In addition, OffMaps 2 and City Maps 2Go also feature downloadable Wikipedia articles for the points of interest on each map. Offmaps 2 can also show a public transport network overlay on top of the regular map.\n\n\n*\n\n*MapsWithMe Pro: €3.99 for the app, no extra charges per map.\n\n*OffMaps 2: €0.79 for the app, includes 2 free maps; €0.79 per pack of 3 extra maps or €4.99 for unlimited maps. Each map includes Wikipedia articles (optional download) and a public transport overlay.\n\n*City Maps 2Go: €1.59 for the app, no extra charges per map. Enabling the Wikipedia articles download option is an additional one-time €2.39 charge. (*)\n\n\nBased upon first impressions, the one I would recommend is City Maps 2Go. The public transport overlay of OffMaps 2 is an interesting additional feature, but I prefer City Maps 2Go's cleaner interface. I also already experienced several app crashes with OffMaps 2. MapsWithMe Pro seems comparatively expensive.\n(*) The app appears to be designed to charge a separate fee for enabling this option for each map, but currently has an “Introduction offer: buy ‘Wiki Plus’ now and you will get lifetime, global, unlimited download rights.”\n", "Q: Using dnsmasq when not connected to the Internet I'm routing dns requests through dnsmasq so that domains I'm using for local development point to 127.0.0.1.

It seems that ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa will load your key but will ask for the password each time you reboot.\nI am looking for a solution that would not require me to re-enter the key password between logins.\n\nA: I had a similar problem, in that I was being asked every time for my pub-key passphrase. Per suggestion of user \"trisweb\" above, I turned on these options to ~/.ssh/config:\nHost *\n  UseKeychain yes\n  AddKeysToAgent yes\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\nBut it still prompted every time I wanted to use ssh. Eventually I turned on ssh -v and found this debug line:\ndebug1: key_load_private: incorrect passphrase supplied to decrypt private key\n\nI then opened my keychain in \"Keychain Access.app\", found the key named \"SSH: /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa\" and opened it up. I clicked \"Show password\" to disclose the password and indeed found that the passphrase in the keyring was an old passphrase. I updated the passphrase in Keychain Access, and now password-free works.\nI could have also updated the passphrase with this phrase:\nssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\n\nA: To all where the above did not work, my issue appears to have been because I was duplicating the UseKeychain yes & AddKeysToAgent yes in all ssh key profiles / shortcuts. I updated my ~/.ssh/config file to declare these only once and they now all load on login without prompting for passwords on startup, e.g:\nHost foo\n  HostName foo.com\n  User fooUser\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/foo\n\nHost bar\n  HostName bar.com\n  User barUser\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/bar\n\n########################\n# Keep the default configuration \n#  as the last item in this file\nHost *\n  UseKeychain yes\n  AddKeysToAgent yes\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/foo\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/bar\n\n\nA: Also, in macOS Sierra and High Sierra (don't know about previous versions), running ssh-add -A will get the agent to load all keys whose passphrases are stored on Keychain... So very handy\nNote that these option flags have been renamed and the old ones deprecated in later versions of macOS. From the ssh man page:\n\nAPPLE_SSH_ADD_BEHAVIOR\nEnables or disables the older processing of\nthe -A and -K options used in earlier macOS releases. These options\nhave been renamed --apple-load-keychain and --apple-use-keychain\nrespectively.\nHowever, -A and -K still behave as in earlier releases\nexcept in the following circumstances:\n\n*\n\n*If a security provider was\nspecified with -S or SSH_SK_PROVIDER, or if APPLE_SSH_ADD_BEHAVIOR is\nset to the value “openssh”, then ssh-add uses standard OpenSSH\nbehavior: the -A flag is not recognized and the -K flag behaves as\ndocumented in the DESCRIPTION section above.\n\n*Otherwise, ssh-add -A and -K will behave as in earlier macOS releases.\nA warning will be output to standard error unless\nAPPLE_SSH_ADD_BEHAVIOR is set to the value “macos”.  Note: Future\nreleases of macOS will not support neither -A nor -K without setting\nthis environment variable.\n\n\nA: It is not possible to add private key to Keychain, but you can store passphrase for private key in Keychain.\nOn OSX, the native ssh-add command has a special argument to save the private key's passphrase in the OSX Keychain, which means that your normal login will unlock it for use with ssh. On OSX Sierra and later, you also need to configure SSH to always use the Keychain (see Step 2 below).\nAlternatively you can use a key without a passphrase, but if you prefer the security that's certainly acceptable with this workflow.\nStep 1 - Store passphrase in the Keychain\nIn the latest version of MacOS (12.0 Monterey), just do this once:\nssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/[your-private-key]\n\nOr in versions of MacOS older than 12.0 Monterey, use:\nssh-add -K ~/.ssh/[your-private-key]\n\nEnter your key passphrase, and you won't be asked for it again.\n(If this fails, make sure you are using Apple's version of /usr/bin/ssh-add and not something installed with brew etc.; check with which ssh-add)\nStep 2 - Configure SSH-agent to always use the Keychain\n(Note: In versions of OSX prior to Sierra, this is not necessary)\nIt seems that OSX Sierra removed the convenient behavior of persisting your keys between logins, and the update to ssh no longer uses the keychain by default. Because of this, you need to change one more thing for secure persistent key storage.\nThe solution is outlined in this github thread comment. Here's what you do:\n\n*\n\n*Ensure you've completed Step 1 above to store the passphrase in the keychain.\n\n\n*If you haven't already, create an ~/.ssh/config file. In other words, in the .ssh directory in your home dir, make a file called config.\n\n\n*In that .ssh/config file, add the following lines:\n Host *\n   UseKeychain yes\n   AddKeysToAgent yes\n   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\nChange ~/.ssh/id_rsa to the actual filename of your private key. If you have other private keys in your ~/.ssh directory, also add an IdentityFile line for each of them. For example, I have one additional line that reads IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 for a 2nd private key.\nThe UseKeychain yes is the key part, which tells SSH to look in your OSX keychain for the key passphrase.\n\n\n*That's it! Next time you load any ssh connection, it will try the private keys you've specified, and it will look for their passphrase in the OSX keychain. No passphrase typing required.\n\nA: Answer on OSX 12.0 Monterey\nYou can now use the flag --apple-use-keychain to accomplish exactly this.\nssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_rsa \n\nAdd this to your .zshrc or .bashrc file to have it load from your keychain on new logins / terminal instances.\nThis replaces the -K and -A flags:\nWARNING: The -K and -A flags are deprecated and have been replaced\n         by the --apple-use-keychain and --apple-load-keychain\n         flags, respectively.  To suppress this warning, set the\n         environment variable APPLE_SSH_ADD_BEHAVIOR as described in\n         the ssh-add(1) manual page.\n\n\nA: Add the public key in:\n.ssh/known_hosts\n\nPublic key usually are on:\n/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nHope that helps\n\nA: One of solutions is to delete .ssh from path. Like this - \"ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/id_ed25519\" or \"ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/[YOURS ID OF SSH]\"\nAlso you need to change path in ~/.ssh/config by deleting /.ssh\n", "Q: Pushing offline viewable content to iPads for Enterprise We have rolled out a small deployment of iPads to our Enterprise using iPCU and with a little sweat I'd say we were pretty successful. Our company is pretty large and our demand for iOS solutions is growing. We're currently under a trial license with McAfee EMM (MDM), so we're still getting our feet wet with that.\nThis has naturally generated a lot of questions from our customers, so we'd like to find a solution to push a How-To document to these devices that pertains to our Enterprise. Has anyone found a solution for distributing documents to iOS devices that is viewable offline, without having the user to perform many steps? In a perfect world, we would be able to push a document/app to them w/o any intervention... however this goes against what I know about mobile distribution. The user must manually go into our MDM and download the app. Now I'm looking for the next best solution. Here's how I imagine it working... or other methods I've read:\n1) Pushing a Web Clip to the device using a .mobileconfig on initial provisioning (not tested yet). The web clip points to an outward facing site where they grab a PDF. The PDF can then be saved to iBooks for offline viewing. The bad: They're not notified when we make a change to the doc. Or they forget to save the doc to iBooks. Or they don't download iBooks.\n2) Develop an Enterprise App with all the content self contained. Contact users via email that the App is available in the Enterprise Store. Any updates to the app are presented as a badge... life is good. The bad: Developer is recompiling and redistributing on every change to the document. Or they don't bother to download the app, when they need it ... it's too late.\n3) Drop box - Post the document through drop box for them to grab. The bad: Same as #1\n4) Email everyone the doc or post to a website and fend for yourself. This just wont work in our organization.\nI know I'm not the only one facing this problem. The key here is: the least amount of effort for the user, the better. Right now option #2 seems like the best solution, I'm just curious to see how others have solved this problem.

Flash drives / SSDs have limited read and write capacity, right?\nHow do I know when I am reaching that? I don't want my data to be corrupted. \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: \nFlash drives / SSDs have limited read and write capacity, right?\n\nYes, but it's a calculated value based on a number of factors including, but not limited to:\n\n*\n\n*Duty cycle (how much the drive is being used)\n\n*What it's being used for (i.e. more writes than reads or vice versa)\n\n*The type of SSD SLC  (Single-Level Cells, used in enterprise applications) or MLC (Multi-Level Cells, used in consumer applications).\n\nWhen will an SSD fail?\n\nAccording to this SNIA article, hard drives see a Mean Time Between\nFailure (MTBF) of 1 million hours, while SSDs show 2.1 million hours.\nSanDisk® further rates its Lightning SAS SSDs at 2.5 million hours\nMTBF. Thus, SSDs have more than twice the longevity than HDDs.1\n\nThey go on to further differentiate SSDs from HDDs...\n\nSSDs are different in how they wear in comparison to hard drives. Due\nto the characteristics of NAND flash, SSDs have a finite lifetime\ndictated by the number of write operations known as program/erase\n(P/E) cycles NAND flash can endure. The objective of SSD endurance\nnumbers is to capture this consumable nature of flash storage into a\nquantifiable number to provide end users guidance on the anticipated\nlifespan for the drive in operation.\n\nMeaning:  It's a best guess number.  Your SSD is not going to stop functioning when it reaches that \"theoretical\" limit.  Chances are, you are going to outstrip the capacity of the drive with data long before you reach its wear limit; you'll buy a bigger one before it fails.\nJust for grins and giggles, I used Intel's SSD Endurance Calculator to estimate the life of an SSD being used for Virtualization with a 100% duty cycle (worst case scenario).\nIt gave me a life of just under 6 years having written 62 petabytes (62,800 TB).\n\nTo put that into perspective2, you would need to\n\n*\n\n*record 213 years, 6 months of full HD video\n\n*take 24,000 digital photos per day for the rest of your life\n\nTL;DR\nYes, there's a limit, but you needn't worry about it.

In a wide range of applications I often need to use a straight edge to compare different values on charts, even sometimes charts generated by different applications.  To do this I have made do with clumsy solutions like creating a floating and transparent Sticky or using Shift + Command + 4.  I've also tried a small app called Crosshairs.\nNone of these things do what I really want.  Ideally, I'd like a full screen crosshair centered on the cursor.  Another way to think about this, it would give me a full height vertical and full width horizontal line that would show up over (on top of) any and all applications, just as a cursor does. Nice to haves it would give the coordinates of the display and have toolbar or right click access to turn it on or off.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: While it has many more features than this, something like xScope sounds great for this. \nSome main features:\n\n\n*\n\n*mirroring\n\n*getting on screen dimensions\n\n*rulers\n\n*guides\n\n*frames\n\n*crosshair\n\n\nA: QuickLens has an excellent set of tools: a full screen live crosshair, movable/lockable guides, ruler and a few other measurement, magnification and alignment tools. Available via AppStore or as part of Setapp if you happen to subscribe to that.\nPixelSnap 2 is a well designed app that provides great crosshair & measurement tools. It's a bit costly as a standalone app for just a crosshair, but it's included in Setapp as well.\nRed Lines Tools (App Store, currently free as of 2/2023). It has crosshairs, a magnifier, grid/image overlays, adjustable keybindings, and many other customizations. There are a few bugs but it gets the job done.\nAnother possible solution: Monosnap is a free screen capture app that displays full-screen crosshairs when capturing an area. You can trigger it via a hotkey and then hit ESC to cancel without actually taking a screenshot if all you want to do is use the crosshairs for alignment.\nAs others have mentioned, xScope is another option, although it's costly if all you need is crosshairs.\nThere used to be a small and efficient app called Euclid written by Nicholas Jensen that was specifically for crosshairs. Unfortunately, it's been abandoned.\n\nA: Free solution: Mouse Locator http://www.2point5fish.com/\nYou can make whatever custom cursors you want.\nHotkeys can turn it on/off, and if you want coordinates, you could launch Pixie (or another app) and keep it in the corner.\n\nA: For a different approach, you can try Free Ruler for Mac OS X. This free application displays a horizontal and a vertical ruler, both of which you can extend. It supports different scales (cm, mm, pixels, inches, etc - it's using the screen DPI to display distance measurements correctly).\nI use it quite often when I need pixel-perfect measurements of GUI elements, or other stuff and the application I work with doesn't give me what I need in terms of the measurements. \nPlease note, I'm NOT affiliated with the developer in any way, just a happy user for the occasional time that an application like this serves my needs. \n\nA: I use Skitch (a free screenshot annotation app) for the crosshair functionality.

I'd really like to be able to play sound through both the headphone jack and my internal speakers on my MBP. Is this possible? If so, how?\n\nA: In my experience, the answer is no. As soon as you plug in the headphones into the 3.5mm jack, it replaces the internal speakers as the default output (and vice versa when you unplug them). There are several discussions around as to whether this is actually a limitation in the hardware or the software, but the end result always seems to be the same. \nNow this may not answer specifically what you're asking, but for interest, the only time I've had any success with simultaneous headphone and speaker output is when using a USB device, such as a headset or USB speakers. In order to get this to work, you'll need to plug in the USB device, then do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the Apple \"Audio MIDI Setup\" utility (/Applications/Utilities/Audio MIDI Setup) \n\n*Select the \"+\" in the bottom-left and select \"Create Multi-Output Device\"\n\n\n*Select the Multi-Output Device that has been added and in the right-hand pane, select both the \"Built-in Output\" and your USB device. That should look something like this:\n\n\n*Start \"System Preferences\" → \"Sound\" and click the \"Output\" tab. Select the \"Multi-Output Device\" that's now there.\n\n\n*An unfortunate side-effect of this, as \"The selected device has no output controls\" eludes to, is that you now can't control the volume in the normal manner. To do this, you'll have to go back to Audio MIDI Setup and do it from there for each of the outputs. So be careful with those headset and speaker levels to begin with!!!\n\nAnd that's it :) So, now when you play a song in iTunes, for instance, that should come out of both the headset and the speakers.\nHowever, whilst all this may be largely academic without a USB headset or speakers, I did also come across the Griffin iMic which says:\n\niMic supports both mic and line level inputs via a selectable switch,\n  and provides a line-level output for connecting speakers or\n  headphones.\n\n\nI've not tried it, but if you're willing to spend the money, that may allow you to connect a pair of headphones with a normal 3.5mm jack then, using the method above, get audio out of both the internal speakers and the headphones simultaneously. \n", "Q: How I can prevent Safari popups to increase database size on iPad?

With FileVault 2 you can encrypt the content of your entire drive.\n\nI understand that full disk encryption requires me to enter the login password right upon start and before the boot process.\nBut why then can I boot into the recovery partition without entering a password?\n\nA: This is because you are booting into a separate partition on your hard drive. FileVault identifies volumes via partitions so when you encrypt your \"hard drive\" it is the partition that contains your boot volume and data only. The recovery partition and any other additional partitions are never encrypted.\nThis isn't cause for certain though since booting to the Recovery Partition does not expose your encrypted volume nor does doing so grant you access to it. As a matter of fact, if you need to repair your user folder's ACL's and permissions; which you would do through your recovery partition, you would have run some terminal commands to unlock your encrypted partition before repairs can be done.\nBoot Camp would serve as a good example of this. With Boot Camp, your hard is now partitioned into two volumes; One for Mac OS and another for Windows. This would add up to three partitions on your hard drive. FileVault would only encrypted your Macintosh HD partition and not touch your Windows and Recovery partition; but at no point would you be able to access your Macintosh HD's content via Windows or Recovery Mode.\n", "Q: Safari on ipad, how to tell browser to ignore mobile stylesheet How can I specify through the browser when to use the mobile stylesheet for a website, and when not to.\nThis is a specific issue for me on the ipad running Safari.\nIf this can't be done through the browswer, are any generic User-Agent spoofing tools for ipad that I can employ to accomplish this?\n\nA: UserAgent Faker for jailbroken devices (in Cydia) changes the User Agent to ones of a desktop browser. Probably some third party browsers too, e.g. User Agent Browser (free ad supported or $.99 to remove the ads), but haven't used them.\n\nA: Yes - get the Journey web browser and fake whatever user agent you prefer without needing to jailbreak your device.\nIt's a great second browser in it's own right, but the UA flexibility is worth far more than the cost of the app to me.\n", "Q: I installed latest Xcode (4.3.2) which comes as package, can I delete the older versions? According to apple,\n\nXcode in the Mac App Store has been repackaged, and is now distributed as a stand-alone application.\n\nCan I safely remove old versions of Xcode which are using a lot of space? They didn't get removed when I installed the latest version. If I can, what should I do? Which files should I remove or what program do I need to run to remove them?\nThanks!\n\nA: \nCan I safely remove old versions of Xcode which are using a lot of space?\n\nYes.\n\nIf I can, what should I do?\n\nRun:\nsudo <Xcode>/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all\n\nWhere <Xcode> is usually /Developer but can sometimes be ~/Developer depending on whether you installed it with sudo privileges or not.\nOnce you've run that script you can just move /Developer or ~/Developer to the trash, you don't need it any more.\nYou can can get more details about uninstalling by reading the About Xcode.pdf document in your  directory.\nIf you also have a /Developer-old directory you can just move that to the trash.\n", "Q: iTunes sort tracks in ascending order  \nSee how it tracks are listed out of order? 2, 1, 3, 4? I want iTunes to sort the tracks in ascending order but I don't know how to make iTunes do this.\n\nA: \n\nA: If you click on the \"track number\" column as explained in another answer, it will just change the order in which the tracks are displayed in iTunes; if you have problem with the order in which they are played, you should also check that all tracks have the same \"Album Artists\". \nI found the trick here, and it solved the ordering issue I had on my iPod. \n", "Q: Disable iPhone Cell Antennae I'm planning on travelling out of the country and will bring my iPhone along. There will be WiFi access at my destination and I only intend on planning on using my iPhone for that. Is there anyway to sever all communications (data and voice) with the cell tower and keep WiFi connectivity?\n\nA: Put your iPhone in airplane mode then switch wifi on. \n\nA: Three methods will work:\n\n\n*\n\n*AirPlane mode and then enable Wi-Fi\n\n*Pull the SIM chip\n\n*Disable cellular data in the settings app.\n\n\nThese are listed in the most true to your initial intent of not having the antenna operating. I like the middle one as a good tradeoff between not talking with cell towers but maintaining GPS capabilities to tag pictures and use the map with tiles present from WiFi. The battery drain on the second two are more than the first, but still pretty usable in general on the later iOS versions.\nClearly, you can't pull a SIM if you have a phone without one, but the other options work with all iPhone models.\n\nA: The best way to do so is to turn on Airplane mode.  This will turn off all cellular and data sercices, but you can then turn Wi-Fi back on.\nYou will have Wi-Fi and your phone will not connect to the cellular network until you turn off Airplane mode again\n", "Q: What is the easiest way to have Apple's Mail send an email at a specific time/date? Something in Mail itself?  AppleScript?  Automator?\nI am using OS X 10.7.3.\n\nA: The easiest is to simply set the time in iCal and set the alert to email the details.\nIf that's not exactly what you want, you could have iCal launch an Apple Script to send a specific draft, but there isn't a built-in feature to handle everything from email.\nI suppose you could use the scheduled wake event to wake a sleeping mac and have things ready to go, but this seems more likely to backfire and send it earlier if something else wakes up your mac or you open mail and have an internet connection before the appointed time to send arrives.\n", "Q: Was my AT&T-approved iPhone 4 unlock successful? I called AT&T and asked them to unlock my iPhone 4 for international travel. They agreed. The support agent created a case, gave me the case identifier, and gave me an expected resolution date of April 18, 2012. Today (April 13, 2012), I received an email with a link to the unlock instructions.\nThe instructions I received are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes on your Mac or PC and verify that you have internet connectivity.\n\n*Connect your iPhone using the dock connector to USB cable that came with your iPhone.\n\n*Backup and restore your iPhone using iTunes. For information on backup and restore, please visit http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1414.\n\n*After restoring, your iPhone will be unlocked. Additional information on unlocking can be found at http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3198.\n\n\nI completed these steps, however, according to TS3198, I should've seen this message from iTunes: \"Unlock Complete. Congratulations, your iPhone has been unlocked. To set up and sync this iPhone, click Continue.\" I did not get a separate dialog window (as anticipated) with this message. If the message appeared within the iTunes window, I must have missed it.\nTS3198 lists these troubleshooting steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reseat the SIM card: Remove the SIM card in your iPhone and then reinsert it.\n\n*Restore your iPhone. Note that the computer you are using to restore the iPhone needs to be connected to the Internet. You can verify the connection by loading the first page of the iTunes Store.\n\n*Contact your carrier to verify that the unlock was applied in their system.\n\n\nI've already completed steps 1 and 2, but still have not seen a message from iTunes stating that the phone is unlocked. After I post this question, I will perform step 3.\nI do not have an iPhone 4 sim on another network available to test with my phone, but I need to make sure that this unlocking is complete before I travel to another country.\nIs there some persistent indication in the iTunes or iPhone user interface that will tell me whether or not this phone is unlocked?\nSequence of events\n\n\n*\n\n*April 10, 5pm: I called AT&T and requested unlocking.\n\n*April 13, 10am: AT&T emailed me instructions for unlocking.\n\n*April 13, 2pm: I completed the steps for unlocking but did not see any confirmation message as expected. I completed steps 1 and 2 of the TS3198 troubleshooting steps.\n\n*April 13, 4pm: I called AT&T to request confirmation of unlocking (attempting to complete step 3 of the TS3198 troubleshooting steps). Agent stated I did not complete the necessary steps and would need an unlock code. (below, bmike indicates this advice was incorrect.)\n\n*April 13, 6pm: AT&T emailed me instructions for unlocking, which match the instructions I received earlier in the day.\n\n\nA: No, you do not have to enter any sort of unlock code for any iPhone unlock event.\niTunes contacts the registration database when a phone is restored to determine the lock status and set the appropriate carrier settings file if needed.\nSo, in your case one of two things has happened.\n\n\n*\n\n*The database that Apple / iTunes consult hasn't been updated for your IMEI.\n\n*You missed the unlock message and your phone is actually ready to be unlocked.\n\n\nThe unlock happens when you restore your device - either as an over the air (OTA) activation or tethered to iTunes.\n\nThe carrier should be able to query the live database to see if your IMEI is unlocked or you could try getting another cheap SIM (or borrowing a friend's SIM) and just testing the phone yourself. If you restore the phone twice after it gets unlocks, you will not see this message - but you should get it when it's first unlocked.\n\nA: I went through the unlock process in the same way that @bneely did. I didn't see any messages confirming the unlock either. I live in England with an American iPhone and I can confirm that AT&T did unlock my phone and I can now use any SIM I like. \nFirst, the agent that told you that you would need an unlock code is absolutely wrong. There are no codes. \nSecond, if you got the email from AT&T then you are unlocked. Their system automatically sends that email when they've updated the database on their end. All you need to do at that point is connect to your computer and restore your iPhone. \nLastly, I wouldn't trust what AT&T agents do or do not report to you. If you need your phone to work abroad, test it yourself -- borrow a SIM from someone and see whether it works in your iPhone. My impression from your post is that your phone is indeed unlocked already.\n(ps +1 for a detailed and clear history of what you've tried!)\n\nA: There is one crucial step missing, after you backup your phone you must restore it. This puts it in factory fresh condition briefly and completes the unlock.\nAfter you do this and if AT&T approved unlocking your iPhone, then\nyou will see the message indicating that your iPhone has been unlocked.\nYou can then restore from your backup to bring back all the settings and data.\n\nA: After I received the \"unlock\" message, I did the restore for 3 times and did not get the \"congratulations\" message. On the 4th attempt, I did. In the 4th attempt, the only thing I did different was to remove the SIM card before I started the restore. Then iTunes did the restore, and at the end, it asked me to reinsert the SIM. So I unplugged the phone from the computer, inserted the old, deactivated AT&T SIM, and plugged the phone back in. Lo and behold, I got the \"congratulations, your phone is unlocked\" message. \nNote that the SIM I inserted was bot an active AT&T SIM. It had been deactivated because I had switched to iPhone 5. \nThe exact same story is true for my roommate as well. So that 4th attempt is what seems to work.\n\nThis worked for me as well with the old AT&T SIM card from the original phone, not a new SIM or a SIM from another carrier.  Restored without a SIM card installed, at the end of restore, the phone screen instructed to insert a SIM card.  Then, removed sync cord, inserted card, phone appeared to turn off.  When I reinserted the sync cord, the \"congratulations, your phone is unlocked message\" appeared on iTunes.  Previous attempts to follow instructions from AT&T did not work.\n\nA: *\n\n*Make sure that a non-AT&T sim card is in your phone.\n\n*Plug it into your computer until iTunes recognizes it and unplug it right away.\n\n*Wait 10 seconds and then plug it back in.\n\n*You should get a message saying \"Congratulations your phone has been unlocked\".\n\n\nThat's what I did. I didn't even restore my phone.\n\nA: Here's how to unlock your iPhone with a single SIM (updated for iOS 7):\n\n\n*\n\n*If your locked AT&T iPhone is near its contract expiration go here\n\n*Fill out the form, ignore the AT&T Account Passcode and click \"Submit\"\n\n*In a few minutes you'll receive an email confirmation from AT&T that says \"We have reviewed your request and confirmed that the device may be unlocked.\"\n\n*Wait 24 hours before proceeding to the next steps\n\n*If you have another carrier contact them to unlock your iPhone when your contract has ended\n\n*On your iPhone tap Settings\n\n*Scroll down and tap iCloud\n\n*Disable Find My iPhone\n\n*Remove your iPhone's SIM (you can use a straightened paperclip or push pin)\n\n*Connect your iPhone to your computer's USB cable\n\n*In iTunes under \"Backups\" > \"Automatically Back Up\" click \"This computer\" (not \"iCloud\")\n\n*Click \"Back Up Now\"\n\n*In the menu bar click \"File\" > \"Devices\" > \"Transfer Purchases from 'your iPhone'\"\n\n*Click \"Restore iPhone\" (not \"Restore Backup\") and click \"Restore\"\n\n*iTunes will display the message \"There is no SIM card installed in the iPhone you are attempting to activate. Please disconnect and insert a SIM card in the iPhone.\"\n\n*Disconnect your iPhone from the USB cable\n\n*Insert your iPhone's SIM\n\n*Wait a minute for your iPhone to display the \"Hello\" message\n\n*If it's still stuck on the \"No SIM Card Installed\" message power off and power on your iPhone\n\n*Connect your iPhone to your computer's USB cable\n\n*iTunes will display the message \"Congratulations, your iPhone has been unlocked.\"\n\n*Click \"Continue\"\n\n*Ensure \"Restore from this backup\" is checked and click \"Continue\"\n\n*Wait about an hour for the restore to complete\n\n*On your iPhone tap Settings\n\n*Scroll down and tap iCloud\n\n*Enable Find My iPhone\n\n\nEnjoy your new carrier options :D\n\nA: I believed using non-AT&T sim card is another way to unlock. This same instruction applied to my Samsung S2. \nIn fact there are three ways to unlock. Unlock code is another one.\n\nA: The person that posted about removing the SIM on the 4th try is a Godsend! First of all, AT&T does not specify what type of restore you must do. It leads, me at least, to believe you restore from the backup you just took. No: you must use the restore to original settings option. Once I did a restore to original settings with no SIM card inserted, disconnected from iTunes, re-inserted the SIM (the original deactivated SIM) then reconnected to iTunes. Congratulations, your phone is unlocked.\n", "Q: Airplay mirror iPad to mac but let audio play from iPad Scenario:\nI'm trying to mirror my iPad to my iMac using the Reflection app.  Everything works fine but the reason I'm doing this is to record myself making a real time mix using the app Djay.\nProblem:\nThe audio that is streamed to my computer is off by a second, so that makes it nearly impossible to actually time my transitions right.  I want to let my iPad mirror itself but allow myself to hear the audio straight from the iPad instead to bypass that problem.  Should I use a HDMI capture card instead?  Or is there some kind of audio splitter cable that actually retrieves the audio despite airplay running?\nSide Notes:\nI do have Djay for Mac, the only reason I'm doing this is to have my video stand out from the regular mix videos.\n\nA: I think an HDMI solution would work better in this case because you need as little latency as possible for music. The company I work for is considering trying a Blackmagic Intensity Shuttle or Intensity Extreme HDMI interface and converter, which cost US $300 at retail. I have no experience with them. You will need a Thunderbolt, PCI or USB 3 interface to your Mac to use a Blackmagic Intensity.\n\nPart Two\nI'm also a registered user of the Reflection app, and I've been in touch with their tech support staff. They point out that latency and frame rate depend on the specifications of the WiFi router through which the iPad sends its audio and video to the Mac. When you connect the iPad's video and audio to the Mac using AirPlay, are you using a WiFi G router (slow), or a WiFi N router (five times as fast as WiFi G)? Furthermore, you should probably connect the Mac directly to the router via an Ethernet cable, and not use WiFi on the Mac at all. Test this with a WiFi N (802.11n) router in close proximity to the iPad broadcasting with AirPlay and see if performance improves and latency decreases.\nIf you are using this setup in performance as a DJ, you might want to set up your own router in your DJ rig, whether it's connected to the Internet or not, so you can ensure the fastest connection between the iPad and the Mac.\nIf that doesn't produce acceptable results, then the HDMI hardware might be the next thing to try.\n", "Q: How can I receive FM radio broadcast signals on an iPhone 4? I know I can download apps such as Wunder Radio or iHeartRadio that tune in to the same signal over the internet as is being broadcast over commercial FM stations, but I want to use my iPhone to receive input from a real FM tuner.\nMany times smaller stations do not stream and often other services, such as audio of TV on a Gym, some museums and traffic warning stations as well as conferences where live translations in several languages are broadcast over different FM frequencies. \nIs there a particular app for this or maybe a third-party device I can purchase?\n\nA: The only iOS device that features a built-in FM tuner is the iPod nano, since the fifth generation (the tall \"candy-bar\" style before they shrunk to the square shape). The sixth generation (current, as of this writing) iPod nano still has the FM Tuner.\nIt is impossible to merely download an app on any iOS device (iPod touch / iPhone / iPad ) to accomplish this with any modern/iOS device because you have to have the physical radio that can tune FM/AM radio bands. Now, if they streamed to some network location which an app can easily access...\nI would like to mention also that the Griffin and Belkin products in The Apple Store ARE NOT tuners. They are transmitters. They broadcast (short range) on FM frequencies, so you can tune in using your car stereo, or perhaps some kind of radio tuner alarm clock you may have in your house.\nThe iHome speaker does appear to do FM tuning, but that is likely not practical in the example you're asking about. Go with the iPod nano.\n\nA: I use one mac with a RadioShark connected to capture FM signal.\nOnce your mac has tuned the station of choice, you have several options to get that signal to your iOS device. I use Airfoil for Mac and Airfoil Touch on iOS to receive the signal.\nIt's only a matter of time until someone releases hardware specific for the task (hello kickstarter) unless someone with deeper wallets brings something to market. The new low power bluetooth protocol would be excellent for this sort of dedicated device once the hardware to support it is being manufactured on a wider scale.\n\nA: No way you can do it on iPhone, unless you purchase an FM receiver such as the Griffin iFM Radio Receiver for iPhone and iPod\n", "Q: Can't Copy Text in Safari on iPhone 4 In Safari on an iPhone 4, how do you select/copy text? I've tried holding down on the text but nothing happens.\nFor instance, https://m.facebook.com and click Photos. On the iPhone 4, I'm told that the browser doesn't support \"photo uploads\" and am given an email address I can send the photo to instead. I wasn't able to copy text from this page.\n\nA: \nCut, copy, and paste.\n\nAccording to Apple should work as follows:\n\nFind the text you want to edit in a note, email, web page, or other app. You can select a word by double-tapping it, and select more or less text by dragging the grab points. Then tap to cut, copy, or paste. To undo an edit, shake iPhone, then tap the Undo button.\n\n\nHowever, in this particular case it appears that Facebook is creating a HTML 5 Web App/ page and is using JavaScript or similar functionality to prevent selection of text.  When trying to view the page on a Mac/PC text will also not be selectable \"that is not in the pictured text box\" for copying.\nIn this example pictured below the text \"Photo\" nor \"No file chosen text\" nor even the \"Update Status\" text on the top of the page can't be selected even on a Mac.\nThe select-ability of text on a website does depends on the sites implementation details. If a site chooses to disable text selection the iPhone's browser will obey the sites request, and will not give you the ability to select text.\nFor the Facebook example text is really not select-able  even on the Home wall page.  If you really want to copy text from Facebook pages try opening the desktop version of the site on your iPhone. The same rings true for other sites that may be offering custom mobile web pages that may limit text selection.\n\n", "Q: Two copies of Lion installed on one computer, now the App Store won't install apps I have installed Mac OS X an additional HDD.  So my MacBook now has two copies of OS X, and I can select which one to boot when it starts – great.\nThe only catch is that, if all my hard drives are mounted, the App Store app doesn't work very well on the newer install – it thinks apps are installed when they are not (they are however installed on my old install).  Obviously it is seeing the applications on the second HDD.\nI don't want to unmount the second HDD (which fixes this problem, but forces me to stop what I'm working on).  I've tried adding the second HDD's Application directory to my spotlight exclusions to no avail. What other ways can I solve this?\n\nA: That the App Store application finds the apps installed on your other OS volume is a feature. It may not be exactly what you want in this scenario, but consider the far more common scenario of a user moving some of their apps to an external volume because their system volume is running low on space.\nYou could file a bug with Apple, but the team responsible is unlikely to be convinced add special support for such an uncommon use case.\nI'm afraid you're likely stuck with unmounting the second volume.\n\nA: Try telling the Mac App Store to Force Download the Applictions that it thinks are already installed.\nThe technique demonstrated here in the following article: 10.7: How to download the OS X Lion Installer on Lion \n\nBut actually this hint will work to force download any purchase on the Mac App Store. \nSo here's how to do it:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open the Mac App Store.\n  \n*Navigate to your Purchased page.\n  \n*Hold down the Option key on your keyboard and click on your 'OS X Lion' purchase link (not on the 'installed' button).\n  \n*You see the Lion product page. It should say 'Installed,' but that button is clickable. Hold down the Option key again and click on 'Installed.' If you don't hold the option key it will tell you there's already a newer version installed.\n  \n*Enter your login credentials.\n  \n*Download.\n  \n\nThe Download should go to the /Application directory of the booted and newer install of Lion.\n", "Q: Will new desktops with Thunderbolt capabilities work with existing 27\" Apple Thunderbolt displays? Searched for the answer, apologies because I'm sure this must have been covered.\nIn 2012 we'll see desktop motherboards (and I suppose laptops but let's ignore that) to build Windows boxes that have Thunderbolt connectors.\nIf/when I buy such a motherboard and build a Windows box around it, will there be a way to connect 27\" Apple Thunderbolt monitors that I already own?  I won't care if adaptors will be required, I'm just curious whether it will even be possible AT ALL?\n\nA: The best guess is that it is going to depend on the computer. Carrying a DisplayPort signal through Thunderbolt is a feature but not necessarily a requirement for having a Thunderbolt port. But, yes, assuming that a given Thunderbolt port is carrying the  DisplayPort signal, there should be no reason why the Thunderbolt display will not work on that port as a display, regardless of the kind of computer. \nNow as for other features included, it may depend on drivers for those features and how the host operating system recognizes what other things are included in the Thunderbolt display. For example, how customized the drivers are for each extra included device in the Apple Thunderbolt display is probably yet to be determined. For example the speakers, extra USB/FireWire ports, network card, etc. may not work if the host OS can't find a driver.\nThe specifics of how a motherboard-based Thunderbolt port can talk to any given PCI-Express graphics card installed in that board is also an interesting detail to address, hopefully the next generation Mac Pro will give an example of this since its implementation is questioned as well in the Thunderbolt wiki article as well:\n\nBecause the PCIe bus does not carry video data, it is unclear whether a standalone PCIe card could offer a Thunderbolt port. The Intel Thunderbolt Technology Brief does not give a conclusive answer. Intel disclosed documentation where video stream is sent to a dual-Thunderbolt controller, with the video stream being only sent to one of the Thunderbolt ports, giving the assumption that video stream is not mandatory on Thunderbolt implementation.\n\nIt looks like many of questions will be answered in the future as more hardware is rolled out but here is a bit of speculation on the noted next generation Ivy Bridge Thunderbolt controllers. \n\nAnother aspect that makes the DSL3510 interesting is that it supports multiple internal DisplayPort inputs. What this means is that it could in theory interface with a discrete graphics card as well as the integrated graphics from an Intel CPU. This is likely to be the chip used by Apple in its desktop systems, whereas the more power efficient DSL3310 will end up in notebook products.\n\n", "Q: Aggravating IPhone problem, apps when downloaded on one phone go to all phones When I download an app on my iPhone, it is automatically downloaded to my parents iPhones. It is extremely aggravating when my little sister shows me her iPod with all my games. How do I stop this? Everything with iCloud is off. \n\nA: Try this on your sister's iPod /parent's iPhones.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings -> Stores\n\n*Disable Automatic Downloads\n\n\nA: You probably have automatic downloads on. Go to Settings>Store on your iPhone. Sign in, if you aren't already. Then you should be able to turn on (or off) automatic downloads):\n\nI believe you'll have to do the same for your sister's iPod as well, though I'm not completely sure, as we don't have multiple iOS devices.\n", "Q: How to Attach Picture to Existing Email How do you attach a picture to an email you've already started composing? Instead of going to the picture first and sending it that way. I want to be able to attach it while I'm writing an email.\n\nA: I am assuming you are using iPhone 4 from your tag.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Home button\n\n*Go to the Photos app\n\n*Long hold on the picture that you want to attach to the email. A 'Copy' pop up will appear, copy.\n\n*Go back to Mail. \n\n*Paste your photo into Mail.\n\n\nNote that the photo will be in full size and might make the size of your outgoing mail quite large.\n\nA: While typing your email you can long click on any empty space.

I had my first iPhone synched with my Macbook, then I bought a second iPhone, a 3GS, and I still haven't synchronized it with my Macbook. In fact, I'm not sure I set this 3GS up with any computer at all: I don't remember setting up this new 3GS with any computer (is there any way I can doublecheck this from the iPhone itself?). \nI have been using this 3GS for months, and now it's full of vital data that has not been backed up anywhere. Also, its iOS has never been updated. For these reasons, I'd like to synch it with my iTunes, so that I can back it up, and update iOS.\nWhen I connect the 3GS to my MacBook, iTunes 10 warns me that:\n\"This computer has been previously synced with and iPhone or another iOS device\" \nI then have two options:\n1) \"set up as new iPhone\" \n2) \"restore from the backup of\" (here I see my first iPhone's backups)\nObviously I don't want to overwrite my current 3GS data with backups from another phone. Also, I don't want to erase or loose any data currently present on my 3GS.\nMy question is: how can I backup the data from this 3GS without loosing anything ?\nI strongly fear that choosing \"set up as new iPhone\" will erase everything currently present on my 3GS.\n\nA: Firstly you have to configure iTunes not to auto-sync.\n\nThen, you plug your iPhone, and back it up.\n\n\nA: The real problem here is coming to grips with how iTunes backs up data and what it means when the sandboxed data gets restored onto a device that may or may not have the same apps. Second - you have two distinct problems. First - making a backup and knowing it will be restorable if needed. Second - breaking the sync pairing between the old iTunes library and setting up a new pairing with your current computer (if desired)\nHere are some articles that cover the basics:\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS: How to back up\n\n*iOS: How to back up your data and set up as a new device\n\n*MobileMe: Backing up your Contacts, Calendar, and Bookmarks if they only exist on an iOS device\n\n*iCloud: How to back up iCloud data\n\n*iOS: How to transfer or sync content to your computer\n\n*Using iPhone, iPad, or iPod with multiple computers\nOver time, Apple keeps making this better and better, but it really depends on which version of iOS and which version of iTunes you are using. Also - some data will never be backed up (account passwords when data protection / backup encryption is not enabled).\nThree strategies exist:\n1) Just do the work to sync only the data you need and avoid backing up - go over each app on the phone - delete the ones you don't care to back up data (games, unused apps, trivial ones to start again like Facebook or Twitter where the app only caches data - not stores the only copy of data)\n2) Let iTunes back up the phone and test restoring it on a new device. You might be happy with iTunes and can live with things not needing to set up a new device.\n3) Send the backup to iCloud and see about restoring after you've gotten the device paired with the new computer.\nThe big problem is you don't know if the backup is good until you test restoring it and most people don't want to go to the hassle to test things to make sure the don't \"loose anything\". Also - each person makes different choices on how and what they care to sync (and by which method) so a general list of steps becomes like a \"choose your own adventure\" book with dozens of decision points where the steps diverge.\n\nA: If you have the iOS 8 or 9 later and you hit set up as new iPhone then it will not delete any data that you have on the phone! I just did this today and it didn't delete anything on my iPhone 5s at all. If you hit set up as new iPhone it won't do anything! It's just because your computer and iPhone do not recognize each other!! Thanks hope this helps \n", "Q: What phonetic language an dictionary is supported by Siri on iOS? I want to convince Siri to properly pronounce and recognise some of my contacts.\nI know that I need to tweak the 3 fields: Phonetic First Name, Phonetic Last Name and Nickname for that.\nStill, I am missing some very important information:\n\n\n*\n\n*What phonetic language does it use as it does not seem to be IPA\n\n*Where can I find the list of possible sounds and their letters\n\n\nA: Just like it sounds.\nObama => Oh Ba mu\n", "Q: Can I disable the lighted Apple logo on the back of my MacBook Pro? I want to disable the light on the apple behind my screen. Besides covering it physically, is there a program or setting to disable it?\nReason being - to make my MacBook Pro as uninteresting as possible to hyperactive two-year-olds.\n\nA: I don't think this is possible. The Apple logo (at least on a MacBook Air and the two previous Apple laptops I owned) is lit by the backlight of your screen. (Try changing your screen brightness, and you'll see the brightness of the Apple logo change as well.) I think covering it would be your only option.\n\nA: Nope. \nThe glowing Apple on your MacBook Pro is actually illuminated by the backlight of your screen as well. So you can't turn it off as long as you have your screen lighted on. Your best bet is probably to put a sticker on it.  \n\nA: If you can google around a bit, i recall seeing stickers that can be applied to the inside of the MacBooks white plastic apple logo, to give it different appearances. I'm sure you can cover it up with an opaque material like thick paper to keep it from glowing, but to keep it as clean looking as possible on the outside.\n", "Q: Getting music off an ipad into the computer I just bought a new ipad, and need to move everything from the old one (an ipad 1) to the new one. I made a sync to the computer. Then made a restore to the new ipad. And then I found it did not copy over my music.\nSome of those music files are not in my HD anymore. So if I lose it it might be gone for good. Is there any way in which I can get them out of the iPad in my HD memory.\n\nA: PhoneView (for Mac), PhoneDisk (Windows or Mac), iExplorer (Windows and Mac, free, but you have to find where the music is)\n\nA: SaveTunes allows to extract audio files directly on the iDevice.\n", "Q: Some songs are skipped over/broken on my iPhone; how can I find these? Sometimes when I go to play a song on my iPhone, it skips over it entirely and goes onto a song after it in the list.\nThe same happens when I try and play it in iTunes directly from the device - it gets a exclamation-mark-circle icon to its left when I try and play.\nThe songs have all been copied on by drag/drop from MP3 folders, so I suspect the copy process didn't completely properly.  Is there a way I can find all these songs so I can re-copy them?  (Trying to copy the entire album over again creates duplicate entries.)\n\nA: Finally found an answer to this, thanks to Galley from iLounge!\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a standard playlist called \"Not Missing\".\n\n*Drag your entire library into that playlist. Missing tracks cannot be copied to a playlist.\n\n*Create a smart playlist called \"Missing\" where:\n\n\n*\n\n*Playlist - is not - Not Missing\n\n*(additional to this post)  Media type - is - Music\n\n\n\nYou now have a playlist which contains only your songs with the dreaded exclamation mark, and you can re-add them from your original source.\n\nA: There's a script to create a list of broken links on Doug's Applescripts called List MIA's :\n\"This script checks your entire iTunes library for missing (and presumed \"dead\") tracks–those that iTunes is unable to associate with a file and which are listed in iTunes with a \"!\"– and creates a text file listing these tracks by Artist - Album - Song Name which you can view using TextEdit.\"\nOnce you have a list, you can remove the dead tracks with another script Super Remove Dead Tracks and then use the list to figure out which tracks to re-import.\n\nA: On your iphone, tap on music.\nSwipe left or right on a song, album or artist and a delete button will appear.\nDelete whichever item you don't like.\n", "Q: System font display issues since upgrading from Snow Leopard to Lion Since I upgraded my system from 10.6 Snow Leopard to 10.7 Lion, I have errors in the display of system fonts, and in the spacing of characters in documents.\nAn image of my old system under 10.6 Snow Leopard was restored from a Time Machine backup onto a new system running 10.7. I get unusual results:\n\nLike this in the Spotlight window\n\nAnd this in my battery display\n\nThis in my Safari bookmarks\nnot to mention errors opening documents - this is a .docx doc with Times New Roman, as seen in Pages '09\n\nwhich looks like the following in TextEdit\n\nQuestion\nWhat should I be doing to remedy this, given that Lion comes on no Physical Media?\nShould I re-install something from disc? Online?\nThanks!\n\nA: First, you said you are on 10.7. Have you run the updaters to update your system to 10.7.3, with all of Apple's updates and patches?\nMost likely you are dealing with duplicate fonts that are incompatible--old ones from your old system and newer versions of the fonts with the same names that came with 10.7.\nHere are some things you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the Font Book application, selected all the fonts, and run \"Look for Enabled Duplicates\" and disable the duplicates. Then select all fonts, run \"Validate Fonts\", and remove any that are reported as corrupt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a utility like Cocktail to delete all your font caches, repair your disk permissions, and reboot. (There are several other programs that provide you with a way to delete your font caches, and there is also a method to do this via Terminal and the command line).\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the free TinkerTool and see what it reports about your system font settings. See if you can use TinkerTool to reset the font settings to their system defaults.\n\n\n\nIf none of the above work, or if you learn from Font Book that the basic fonts that you need are corrupt, then you should re-install 10.7.3 on your existing system (this will not hurt your data) and run Software Update and apply all patches. But first you need to delete any duplicate fonts or corrupt fonts.\nI believe you can download the Lion 10.7.3 installer from the Mac App Store onto your existing installation and run the re-installation procedure from there.\n", "Q: cannot delete application on Lion I cannot delete remove applications on Lion. \nWhen I delete some application in launchpad it disappear and reappear.\nSituations are quite the same as in this clip( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbh-jUgCjs0 ) I found.\nI could delete applications and I do not know what is wrong.\n\nA: There are 2 issues:\nFirst, you can't delete applications from Launchpad. You need to delete them from Applications. \nSecond, you can't delete some system applications (that are essential part of OS X) from Applications by dragging them to Trash. You can only delete applications that you've added. (Actually you can delete system applications, but not by dragging to Trash; it requires some command line interface usage).\n\nA: You could use AppDelete This will actually make sure no files are left from the application.\nhttp://www.reggieashworth.com/appdelete\nOr use the Lite version of AppDelete.\nOr you can also try MacKeeper, using the uninstall option - it does the same, removing all left over files from the application.

I am looking to upgrade the RAM on my Early 2009 iMac from 4GB to 8GB. According to the memory specifications it accepts PC3-8500 204-pin SO-DIMMs. However, will the iMac accept faster RAM (e.g. PC3-10600)? Supposing it does, is there any benefit to doing so?\nFor reference, here are the two types of RAM I'm considering:\n\n\n*\n\n*Crucial 8GB (2 x 4GB) 204-Pin DDR3 SO-DIMM DDR3 1066 (PC3 8500)\n\n*Crucial 8GB (2 x 4GB) 204-Pin DDR3 SO-DIMM DDR3 1333 (PC3 10600)\n\nA: There's no benefit in going with faster RAM because the speed is limited by what your motherboard supports (the early 2009 iMac has a 1066 Mhz frontside bus.) In theory the faster RAM should be able to work at the lower speeds and should be safe to install, however macs do tend to be fussy when it comes to RAM so I would recommend sticking to the RAM recommended in the system specs.\nEdit:\nMore often than not your mac will accept higher speed RAM. However it can cause problems; one example from the Apple Support Forums. You can find similar stories all over Apple forums. This is why I advocate sticking as closely to the specs as possible.\nAs to the advantage of possibly installing the RAM in a future computer, in 2 years you'll probably be able to get twice the RAM for the price (and be wanting to install twice the amount too.)\nLastly, if you compare the 2 chips you linked you'll notice that the 1333 memory has a CAS latency of 9, while the 1066 has a lower (better) latency of 7. So you're trading an imaginary upside for a real downside.\n\nA: The Memory you have noted PC3-10600 is backwards compatible with PC3-8500 as noted here by Crucial \"Memory speeds and compatibility\" article.\n\nMemory is designed to be backward-compatible, so generally speaking, you can safely add faster memory to a computer that was designed to run slower memory. However, your system will operate at the speed of the slowest memory module.\n\nThe only benefit is that for newer computers that you may purchase that can accept PC3-10600, you will already have the faster memory to put in it and you will not have to re buy your memory upgrade. This might be a really good option for you if you frequently buy new computers, eg. every year or two.  This could pay off best when buying the largest capacity sticks that you can put into your machine and then carry your memory upgrade with you as you upgrade to newer computer/s. However with buying the largest modules that you can buy /afford you will be paying a premium price, so it is kind of a gamble that may or may not pay off depending on the prices of memory in the future. Just factor in how much your memory upgrade will cost, and if going to PC3-10600 will be cost effective for your needs or not.\n\nA: I am currently using Kingston (2 x 4GB) 204-Pin DDR3 SO-DIMM DDR3 1333 (PC3 10600) in my early 2009 24' iMac. Everything is working properly.\n\nA: I own an early 2009 24\" iMac as well as two Mac minis and since memory is fairly cheap I was going to up one of the minis (model 5,2) to max ram  and bought 8GB (two sticks) from Crucial. While the ram was in transit I read on another site that unofficially the 5,2 models could handle and identify 16GB ram.\nSo when the ram arrived I installed it into the 2009 iMac even though it was 1333mhz instead of 1066mhz raising it up from 4GB to 8GB the iMac booted and identified the ram correctly and has since been running fine. It has also been upgraded to OSX 10.8.2 from 10.6.8 all without any issues.\nSince then I have also installed 16GB into the mini even though Apple lists it as maxin out at 8GB and it likewise has run without any hiccups as well. For the record I got my upgrade information from this site which even though they are vendors seem to be a good source of information on how to upgrade Macs more economically that the Apple store. \n\nA: I installed 2x 2GB DDR3 1333 PC3-10600 into a late 2009 mac mini.  Running 10.10.2, which struggles on the default 2GB.\nIt started up fine, and apps were so snappy, but then the crashes started.  The machine is completely unstable, with kernel panic errors every 30 odd seconds forcing a restart.\nSadly the original 2GB RAM has gone back in.\nI'd recommend sticking to PC3-8500 for this spec mac.\n", "Q: Is there any way to disable the Home button on an iPad? My professor asked me to help him out to find some information about the iPad.\nWe are going to buy like 10 iPads to give it out to our senior of the school board and we want only the PDF file that we are going to sync it to be appear on the screen.\nI know this is almost impossible without jailbreak, but the iPad wouldn't be able to jailbreak and the people who going to get the iPad they don't really know how to use them, and if they sometime press on the home button they will mess it up and don't know how to get back to the screen that have PDF file.\nSo I heard of Kiosk Pro but really I don't know how it works and I don't know if they will spend that much of money to buy the license again to this task.\nSo I want to know some information from you guys if there is any demo app like what Apple does put the iPad 1 beside each of the products to show the specification of the product and have the case cover the home button so no one can go back to home screen?\nThanks.\n\nA: iOS 6 now has a software feature to block variable parts of the screen and hardware buttons. The feature is called \"Guided Access\". A PIN is needed to unlock the device afterwards.\nHow to use Guided Access\n\nA: Not easily via software. There is a cottage industry of caps to place over the home button to make it hard or impossible for toddlers to press that button.\nThe bubcap is one such product but in your case, it might not help if the users are determined to press the button.\nThe simplest solution may be to buy an iPad case that covers the Home button, or modify an existing case that doesn't (e.g. glue a cover over the button hole).\n\nA: The OtterBox Defender case would be my choice to really lock down the home button. You can modify the rubber button so it's not possible to press or insert a strong material if the unmodified case isn't enough to deter casual button presses.\nIt's not as good as the custom software for digital signage that Apple rolls in their retail stores (with demo mode, limited access, etc...) but might work if you want something more secure than a deterrent product like bubcap.\n\nA: As Martin said, using Guided Access which is included in iOS 6,7,8,9 and 10 would be a cheaper, more reliable option than the two hardware button protectors.\nYou can simply go to Settings > General > Accessibility > Guided Access, then turn it on. You will then have to set a passcode that the students won't know by tapping Passcode settings > Set Guided Access Passcode.\nNow go into the app you wish to keep the students in, and triple click the home button. It may come up with a box saying Accessibility Shortcuts. If so, just click Guided Access and you can continue. It will say Guided Access Started. You must now triple click the home button once more, and tap Guided Access again if applicable. Enter the passcode you set before and enable touch if it is not already enabled, then under Hardware Buttons hit Options.\nIf you don't want them turning the device off, turn off Sleep/Wake Button. Now hit resume, and you will not be able to close the app until someone who knows the passcode triple clicks the home button, enters the passcode, then hits end.\n", "Q: Macbook pro won't turn on My 2008 macbook pro won't turn on.\nI replaced the battery less than six months ago, but it seems that it died again.\nThe charger is connected and it shows a green light, but the battery's lights don't turn on. When the battery button is pressed, only the first light blinks.\nI tried resetting the SMC multiple times, but no luck.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Verify that you're using an 85W Apple MagSafe adapter, the 60W will not provide enough power to turn the MacBook Pro on.  Try with a known-good 85W MagSafe adapter, if that doesn't work, you'll need to take it into an Apple Authorised Service Provider (AASP) or the Genius Bar.\nGood Luck!\n\nA: Have you tried removing the Battery and then turning the Mac on? \nIf the Mac starts you can then insert the Battery and it should recharge. \nIf the MacBook does not start (without the Battery inserted) then your Problem is more likely a faulty AC-Poweradapter.\n", "Q: Stream iTunes TV shows to iPad? Is it possible to stream television programs from the iTunes store to an iPad, like you would do with an Apple TV, or is it only possible to watch them by downloading first?  \n\nA: You could start the download of the TV show on the iPad and then start watching it after a few minutes (depending in your connection speed) once its buffered enough.\nTo do this start the download in the iTunes app and the switch to the videos app and you can start watching, as it downloads it will fill in the time slider bar in white. \nThen delete it after you've watched it. This is effectively streaming. \nHopefully the rumoured upcoming iTunes revamp, will include more natural streaming. It's likely though that there is no traditional streaming because of licensing issues.\n", "Q: How to tell if an iPhone is third party unlocked? Is there a safe way to find out if a used iPhone is intended to work on a particular carrier or is factory unlocked VS. having been unlocked by a third party?\nI'm on the Rogers network. I'd want a phone intended to work on the Rogers network, or intended to work on any network, rather than one that might become relocked by a future update. (Also, I had a third party unlocked phone once before, and it liked to spontaneously restart. I don't think that was a coincidence.)\nJailbreaks don't concern me, since I can always revert those. But having a hacked baseband is something I'd want to know about.\n\nA: For a 3GS, you need to avoid the 06.15.00 iPad baseband, which is easy to check.  As far as I know, all other unlock-related baseband hacks consist of preserving old versions of the baseband - which is easily remedied by updating to (or re-installing) the latest firmware.  \nYou can also match the latest iOS version and baseband for that device, as listed here.\niPhones might also be unlocked with a Gevey sim card interposer, which replaces the SIM tray, and so is easy to check for.\n\nA: Check this: international iPhone model numbers listed by country and carrier, it is not very recent, but should work for 3GS. The model number can also be found in Settings -> General -> About. This way you should be able to check if it is AT&T or Rogers\n", "Q: Detecting other bluetooth devices from my iPhone When i turn on Bluetooth in my application it didn't detect other bluetooth devices.

Can someone please tell me how to check if the bluetooth is working in my iPhone ?\nI need step by step instructions :s\nEDIT:\nhow to turn on Bluetooth on a Mac book pro ?\n\nA: You can't connect iPhone and Mac computer by Bluetooth (unless the iPhone is jailbroken). You will need another Bluetooth enabled device (e.g. Bluetooth headset, keyboard etc.) to test Bluetooth on your iPhone.\nAbout your edit: \n\nEDIT:\nhow to turn on Bluetooth on a Mac book pro ?\n\nTo turn Bluetooth on Macbook pro: check if there is a bluetooth icon in the menu bar (next to the clock in the top right corner). If so, look at the color of the Bluetooth icon. If black -- Bluetooth is already on. If gray, click on the icon and choose \"Turn Bluetooth on\"\nIf there is no Bluetooth icon on the menu bar: Go to System Preferences (on the dock or below the Apple icon at the top left corner of the screen), choose Bluetooth. If it is off, it would say \"Bluetooth is off...\" and there would be an \"On\" checkbox below it, click on it to turn on. You may also want to turn \"Discoverable\" on when pairing with other devices, and turn it off when not pairing (already paired devices can still connect thought even if Discoverable is off). You may want to check (if unchecked) \"Show Bluetooth status in the menu bar\". \n", "Q: Install as non-admin user when the installer requires admin permissions I need to run an app that uses Adobe Air, but the installer for Adobe Air requires admin permissions. On general security principles, I limit what gets installed as admin user, and Adobe has a bad history when it comes to security, so it doesn't get exempted from my policy. I found that Mac OS X has a feature similar to Linux's LD_PRELOAD, called DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES, which changes the search path for libraries. So I'm wondering if this can be used to fake out installers that unnecessarily require admin permissions so the installer will install to the current user's directory instead of the system level directory. Or is there a better way to accomplish this?\n\nA: Drag-drop installs can go to an Applications folder at the root of the user's home folder and function without issue, but Adobe has been known for needing hooks in various parts of the OS. For example, a cursory overview of that package shows it wants to install certificates, the flashplayer plugin if not already present, etc.\nConceivably, if you could 'snapshot'(using fsevents/dtrace/packaging tools like packagemaker or Composer, etc.) the installation in a VM and track down all the files it sprays on disk, and relocate those wherever applicable to the user folder on your system, AND the Air runtime and App in question could run without failing due to expecting to see resources in hardcoded directories....\nIn other words, magic 8-ball says 'highly unlikely'.   \n", "Q: My mum spilt water on her laptop and now the shift key does not work A few months back my mum spilt water on her laptop.

I have a couple of old Macs that run old versions of Mac OSX and I want to protect them from the recent Flashback malware. \nHas Apple produced a java update for systems Prior to 10.6 (snow leopard)? \nCan I get such an update anywhere else?\nLink:http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4297?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\nThis link seems to say the latest update is only for OSX 10.6\nI think there is an update for Lion (10.7) as well, what about leopard (10.5) or Tiger (10.4)? \n\nA: The Java updates for OS X come from Apple, not Oracle (that \"owns\" Java and provides downloads for Windows and Linux). In general, Apple doesn't seem to support OS X versions prior to 10.6 (that's something like an unofficial policy, they seem to support the latest 2 versions only), so in general you can't get official Apple updates for anything, including Java, for 10.5 and below. There were ideas about some open source substitutes for Java, but I am not sure what happened to them. Given the recent Java issues, Apple may decide to create and distribute Java update for 10.5, but I won't bet on that.\n", "Q: Is there a way to revert OSX Snowleopard to a clean fresh install? My mums laptop is not very well managed and I would like to clean it up and perform a fresh install on it and teach her the ropes from scratch as she is having a lot of performance problems with it at the moment.\nIs there anyway i can reinstall it?\nIt is a Macbook Pro \n\nA: If you bought your Macbook new then it should have come with a set of recover DVD's that look like this :\n\nYou need to locate this media and use the disk marked \"Mac OS X Install DVD\" to reinstall the OS. Remember to take a backup of all user data beforehand.\n\nA: The OS is preisnatalled, but all new MacBook Pros with original OS version of Snow Leopard or below come with install DVD (pictured in another answer). Note that that's not the case for Lion. \nIf you didn't buy the machine new or if you have lost the install DVD you could try to find someone who has Macbook Pro from the same year and with the same screen size and use that install DVD. Some later years may also work, but it is not guaranteed.\nIf you want to and could use Lion (see requirements) instead of Snow Leopard, you could install Lion on top of SL via the App Store.app (that costs $29), burn install DVD or make install USB in the process and then do a clean install of Lion. Alternatively, you can buy Lion USB drive from Apple (more expensive) and do clean install from there.\nEdit: it appears that you may but Snow Leopard install DVD\nWhatever install/reinstall you do, remember to back up your data prior to that.\n", "Q: Is there an app for iPhone to make pictures after a delay?

Once you push\n  the button, a beeping sound is emitted which becomes faster as the\n  moment of the shot approaches.\n\n\n", "Q: Numbers appear with country code in message app A friend of mine just bought an iPhone. She imported all her SIM contacts using the regular method: Settings > Contacts > Import from SIM All went well.  \nBut when she opens the Messages app, the list is filled with numbers with a country code prefix, so instead of the normal overview of conversations (Tom Dice, David Swimmer, Kim Bauer, etc.), she gets a list with all the numbers of her contacts as name (+324123456, +328945782, etc.).\nSo, has she imported her contacts the wrong way? Or Iis there some corrupt data in her phone? Or what?\nI know it's a pretty vague question without a screenshot, but if you need any more information, please let me know.\n\nA: This happens when there is a mismatch between the number associated with the conversation in Messages and the number associated with the person in Contacts.\nE.g. I can simulate your problem by removing 1 number from the end of the phone number of one of my contacts. Instead of displaying the name in Messages as before it will then display the phone number instead.\nLikely this problem exists because the previous phone automatically prepended \"+32\" to all SMS data instead of using the number as stored on the SIM card. Several solutions are possible :\n\n\n*\n\n*Go through all of the contacts and add the country code (+32, fellow Belgian I see) to their phone number either manually on the phone or desktop or go to the top of the conversation in Messages and tap \"Put in list\", then \"Put in existing contact\" to add the full number to the right contact.\n\n*Delete all conversations, starting over clean the iPhone will associate conversations with the correct number. (I have both numbers with +32 and without in my contacts and SMS are correctly displayed for both.)\n\n*If you are willing to jailbreak you could probably change the numbers directly in the SMS database.\n\n\nI've found a thread with an Applescript to add the country code automatically to all contacts here, but have not tested it so use at your own risk (and backup, backup, backup if you do.)\nproperty myAreaCode : \"+32 \"\ntell application \"Address Book\"\n repeat with aPerson in people\n set thePhones to phones of aPerson\n if thePhones is not {} then\n set errorList to {}\n repeat with aPhoneNumber in thePhones\n set theNumber to value of aPhoneNumber\n if theNumber begins with \"0\" then\n\n try\n set value of aPhoneNumber to myAreaCode & (characters 2 thru (number of characters of theNumber) of theNumber)\n on error\n copy name of aPerson to end of errorList\n end try\n end if\n end repeat\n if errorList is not {} then\n display dialog errorList\n end if\n end if\n end repeat\n save\nend tell \n\n\nA: It might be how the previous phone she had save the data on the sim card and the iPhone couldn't import it properly and misplaces the data in the import processes.\nI suggest you try once again with the same phone with different sim card [or even the same sim card and see]\nThis will make sure that the phone doesn't have a problem.\nBecause to me the importing data from sim card most likely a software issues which easy to solve.\n\nA: Where you said \"language code\" I guess you meant \"country code\".  Is the country code the code for the country the phone's number is in or is it a different country?\nUnder Settings -> Phone, does her own phone number have a country code?  Is it the same or different that the country code being imported?   Does she have \"International Assist\" turned on or off?\nIn any case, try picking one of the messages, scrolling to the top, clicking \"Add Contact\", \"Add to existing contact\", and add the number to the contact and see what happens.  It should restore the names to the Messsage list and you might end up with two numbers for the contact, one with the country code and one without.  Then the question is will both work? \n\nA: I had the same issue. My iPhone was fine, but my iPad all of a sudden showed country codes in messages instead of names. Very frustrating. I noticed that my contacts in my iPhone had the (xxx)xxx-xxxx syntax versus my iPad displayed xxxxxxxxxx in my contacts. I do sync my contacts in the cloud. \nSolution was to turn off contacts on my iPad (via settings in iCloud on iPad), then it asks for option to keep or delete contacts. I deleted them. I waited to validate that my contacts were removed from my iPad. I turned the contacts on via iCloud again in settings menu on my iPad. Once the contacts came back, the (xxx)xxx-xxxx syntax was back on my iPad. Really weird, not sure why it got \"corrupted\" all of a sudden. \n\nA: In you computer, go to \nSystem Preferences > Language & Region \nchange the Region as needed\n\nA: go to settings then sign out of icloud. sign back in and its fixed.\n", "Q: What to do with an old iPhone without SIM I have an iPhone 3GS I no longer use as the battery does not hold and I have a new iPhone 4. I was thinking of using it from time to time at home just to browse or read emails without cellular network (i.e., with no SIM).\nAfter a long time I switched it on initialized it and realized that I need a SIM to activate it (although I already activated it years ago).\nWhat are my options? Can I activate the old 3GS with my current SIM or will I deactivate my new phone? Should I try to get a Phonebook SIM? I would prefer not to jailbreak it if there is a way.\nEdit: the phone was officially unlocked after 2 years of contract.\n\nA: If the phone is unlocked, you can use it with any SIM, even from a different GSM operator or even a SIM that is not in service (obviously in this case it won't work as a phone). If you don't have one or can't find one, you may be able to get prepaid SIM for cheap from an GSM operator.\n", "Q: How to move existing reminders to iCloud in the reminder app?

How to add reminder to ios 5 Reminder app from my windows 7 PC? or it will much better to sync Reminder to google calendar. I like location based reminder of Reminder app.\n\n\nA: As far as I know there would be two ways.\n1. Outlook\nReminders is synced through iCloud, so you should have iCloud installed on your PC. Here is an easy guide provided by Apple. You only really need to follow up to step 2 to sync Reminders; step 3 is to keep your Purchased Music from iTunes in sync too. \nReminders is synced through \"Calendars and Tasks\". You'll need Outlook 2007 or 2010 to sync. \n2. Web App\nThe other option I can think of is adding your reminders directly to iCloud through the Web App. This is done by going to the iCloud Website. Sign in with the Apple ID you use on your iOS device and click on the \"Calendar App\" once signed in.\nYou should see your Reminders on the Right Column. If you don't, go to the Action Menu (the cog icon on the top right corner) and select Show Reminders. You can add new reminders by clicking on the Action Menu > New Reminder, or double-clicking on the bottom of your reminder list. \nSyncing With Google\nAbout syncing with Google, this other thread might be useful.\nBTW: I don't think you can add locations on Outlook or the Web App. I could be wrong, but I don't see the option.\nHope it helps!\n\nA: Personally for the sync, first I use the iPad, I work with the iPad all the time so I used the app Beesy to make the sync Outlook Tasks with Reminders. So now, with the sync, I'm sur do not miss an important even because the sync is with my iPad but my iPhone and laptop too so is very convenient!\n", "Q: How to type fraction symbols on iPad? Many character sets provide single special characters for fractions like 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, etc. Can these be typed on an iPad?\nI have found GlyphBoard that lets you paste them in but it dates back to 2009 and I wondered if native support may have been added in the interim.\n\nA: There are apps which mimic the Mac Character viewer, which I use for once-in-a-while symbols that aren't on the keyboard.\n\nA: The built-in iOS keyboard does not support this, but you can add a shortcut from Settings > General > Keyboard. This way you only have to copy/paste once.\n \n\nA: i put these all into one keyboard shortcut.

I recently started at a new job and now work at home four days a week (I only go in to the office once a week for a company meeting). Because I'm no longer commuting regularly and obviously have wifi in my house, I'm using almost no data on my iPhone 4 anymore. I'm already on the cheaper $15/month data plan with AT&T, but I don't even max that out anymore; as of today, which is halfway through my billing period, I've only used 26 MB out of 200.\nSo what I'm wondering is, is it possible to just get a Tracfone SIM or something and use that for voice, then disable all 3G/data services on my iPhone? I already use almost no voice minutes as it is (I got the iPhone primarily to use data), and I'm now on wifi almost 100% of the time, so I'd lose basically nothing compared to what I have now - it would just be a fraction of the cost.\nI'm assuming there's some catch here that prevents me from doing this, otherwise probably lots of people would be doing the same, but I figured I'd ask!\n\nA: This is most certainly possible. The first few months I had an iPhone, I didn’t have a data plan either.\nIn Belgium (where I live), iPhones are generally sold separately, without a data plan / SIM — they’re officially unlocked iPhones.\nSo, the answer to your question is: yes, it’s possible to use an iPhone without a data plan — but you can only change the SIM card if you own a SIM-unlocked iPhone.\n\nA: Go to settings, celluar, off. And you should still get text and email. I don' think any apps will work though. Trying to do the same plan as you!\n", "Q: Is it true that iPhone 4S has battery issues? I'm considering getting a new iPod and a new mobile phone. iPhone 4S sounds like a really attractive option, but it looks that iPhone 4S has serious battery issues. Some people are charging their iPhone 4S twice a day, according to articles on the web.\nAre those issues are real? I'm a heavy iPod user and if those issues are real, then I don't think that I'm going to get the 4S.\n\nA: I charge my iPhone 4S overnight each night, but I could probably get through multiple days if I was careful. \nCurrently, I'm not careful about battery life. I listen to podcasts on the train to work, make calls, surf the Internet on 3G and WiFi, and listen to streaming radio on WiFi pretty much all day at work. With all that, I get ~16 hours of battery life, which is much better than either my old 4th gen iPod touch or my Palm Prē.\nBatteries can vary by model; the people who wrote the articles you mention probably just got crappy batteries. They should take their iPhones in to an Apple Store and Apple'll probably replace them, as the batteries are clearly defective.\n\nA: I've had my iPhone 4S since launch day and I've had 1 instance where the battery started draining rapidly. The phone became slightly warm and lost its charge in half a day. Turns out it was a process (CommCenter to be exact) that was pegging the CPU at 90% use. This was obviously a bug I ran into, rebooting the phone solved it and it hasn't reoccurred since. This was right after iOS 5 was released so I imagine that bug is fixed by now (we're up to version 5.1) In ordinary use there's no reason you should have to recharge the iPhone twice a day. Personally, I'm very happy with the 4S and would buy it again.\n\nA: I would not hesitate to get an iPhone 4S. I've had one since launch and battery life hasn't been a problem for me. I had an iPhone 4 before it and with both of them I've done a variety of things, many of which are definite battery drains. However, with both the 4 and 4S if I'm on a long trip and will need to use the phone all day long and into the night I'll try to plug it in during the day (while eating lunch possibly) to make sure I have enough charge. This isn't always necessary but it's me being conservative about battery use.\nThe iPhone 4S is a great phone: Siri is fantastic (when it works) and you'll enjoy the excellent camera and high resolution screen.\n\nA: If you use the phone: calls, texts, apps, photos, etc., your battery life will last half a day and you will have to recharge it twice a day. Don't be fooled by the comments above. This will most likely not be the case for you! With that being said, the battery life issue should not be a reason to not purchase the phone! It is incredible and you will be happy with it regardless!\n", "Q: Safari stopped remembering what is usually stored in cookies. What might have happened? For the last few days Safari has simply stopped remembering thing, like my login id for several Web sites (but not all, not StackExchange for example) and form data that is stored in cookies (like my name and address on the pizza delivery site I use).\nPrivate Browsing is not active.\nWhat might have happened and how can I fix it?\nThis is Safari 5.1.2.\n\nA: Saved forms and cookies are not the same thing. Cookies (for example) keep you logged in to a website, instead of having to re-log-in every time you visit. Saved forms are Safari's way of keeping text in a login form, so when you are logged out you don't need to enter your credentials again.\nIt sounds like you're talking about saved forms.

Looking to speed up Growl notifications on a per-application basis (doesn't seem possible within Growl's own GUI), I'm sceptical but still curious if this is possible via GrowlNotify:\nDoes anyone know whether it's possible to set the duration of a GrowlNotify notification?\n\nA: You can kind of do this with Growl GUI, not the best approach, but should work:\nWith the Grown GUI you can set event duration per-style. You can also assign styles per application.\nSo, if you assign different styles to different applications, you can achieve the desired effect. But that would result in different visual styles for different applications, which may not be desired. You may also be able to duplicate styles (don't know how) and assign styles that are the same visually to different applications. Alternatively you may be able to create new styles based on existing ones. \nAgain, not the best solution but should works.\n\nA: You can use the command line tool growlnotify to make a sticky notification, but unfortunately, you can't set a specific time. Here are the commands:\ngrowlnotify -s\n\nIt will prompt you:\nEnter a notification description, followed by newline, followed by Ctrl-D (End of File). To cancel, press Ctrl-C.\n\nMake sure you hit Return, then Ctrl + D.

I have always used Software RAIDs, either Apple-provided, or via SoftRAID, etc.  I am about to re-zhuzh my arrays and decided to do a little research beforehand… and On Apple's site, there is a statement, clear as day…\nRAID 1 (mirroring) for disk redundancy\n\nMirroring improves reliability by writing the same data to two or more disks. If one hard drive mechanism should fail, the second disk still contains all the data. At least two hard drives are required for mirroring. Mirroring does not provide performance improvements. If the hard disks are not the same capacity, the smaller size will be the amount of disk space used on both drives. Disk Utility determines this automatically.\n\nI was always under the impression that, as there are TWO platters for READ operations, that READ performance with a 2-Drive RAID1 mirror would be somewhat improved.  This contrasts with write speed, which remains the SAME, as the drives have to both write the same data at commit-time, so as to sustain  a mirrored copy of the data.  However, when reading I had thought that the array acted similarly to a RAID0, striping the reads accross both drives.\nHow is RAID1 is supposed to work?  If so, is Apple..\n\n*\n\n*just saying there is no improvemnet to cover their asses, or\n\n*are they actually not implementing RAID 1 to its full extenent? (Does SoftRaid 4.3 claim to do this?)\n\nAccording to Wikipedia…\n\nIn RAID 1 (mirroring without parity or striping), data is written identically to two drives, thereby producing a \"mirrored set\"; … The array continues to operate as long as at least one drive is functioning. With appropriate operating system support, there can be increased read performance, and only a minimal write performance reduction;…\n\nSo it is Possible, but Apple says there's does not see any speed benefit…  But in practice, is there any measurable increase in speed for reads with Software Raid 1 (via Disk Utility)?\n\nA: My guess would be that Apple prefers to have one drive handle only write processes as a backup and read/write from whichever one it considers the main drive. As to why this is, I have absolutely no clue. Seems kind of like a big oversight on their part. I've always kind of gotten the feeling that software RAID is pretty low on Apple's priority list.\n\nA: These are what we call implementation details.\nYou can implement RAID 1 in a variety of ways, Apple choose to implement it in a way without any speed gains.\n\nA: For redundancy and performance Apple steers you towards RAID 10. I built a 4 disk array by doing a mirrored pair of striped disks which I then converted to a core storage volume to facilitate easier expansion later and FileVault.\nI can watch data be written to both stripes with iostat but when I read, presumably this is abstracted by cs, as I see zero bytes coming off the same devices on read. Activity Monitor shows the throughput of reads and writes across all volumes, iostat doesn't seem to let me use a cs volume as a device.\nIf you're curious how I set up my RAID set, my final volume name will be 'cornballer' so I named the striped devices 'cb1' and 'cb2'.\nDisk Utility RAID stuff\nAppleRAID sets (3 found)                                                                                                                                                                                                             [16/1799]\n===============================================================================\nName:                 cbs1\nUnique ID:            1E127495-1FDE-4521-A941-5E5DC31245DD\nType:                 Stripe\nStatus:               Online\nSize:                 2.0 TB (1999721791488 Bytes)\nRebuild:              manual\nDevice Node:          -\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#  DevNode   UUID                                  Status     Size\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0  disk5s2   AA501823-4955-473B-A27E-0EEA9E75072A  Online     999860895744\n1  disk6s2   A6486548-3E07-4C0F-8F88-BE909D23DC22  Online     999860895744\n===============================================================================\n===============================================================================\nName:                 Untitled\nUnique ID:            C9E220C8-418B-4BF4-81A2-627CC95AB7B4\nType:                 Mirror\nStatus:               Online\nSize:                 2.0 TB (1999721758720 Bytes)\nRebuild:              automatic\nDevice Node:          disk9\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#  DevNode   UUID                                  Status     Size\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0  -none-    1E127495-1FDE-4521-A941-5E5DC31245DD  Online     1999721758720\n1  -none-    2B52C67D-801E-4481-A76B-F98FF28C13B5  Online     1999721758720\n===============================================================================\n===============================================================================\nName:                 cbs2\nUnique ID:            2B52C67D-801E-4481-A76B-F98FF28C13B5\nType:                 Stripe\nStatus:               Online\nSize:                 2.0 TB (1999721791488 Bytes)\nRebuild:              manual\nDevice Node:          -\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#  DevNode   UUID                                  Status     Size\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0  disk7s2   890A3BB9-94CB-4E02-8580-5F16D94890FF  Online     999860895744\n1  disk8s2   71C4DE7E-6EC2-4660-9CDA-0ED31574925D  Online     999860895744\n===============================================================================\n\nCore Storage Stuff:\nCoreStorage logical volume groups (2 found)\n|\n+-- Logical Volume Group FA60C2D3-1129-46B1-BE53-5BC7882904EB\n|   =========================================================\n|   Name:         lindsayLVG\n|   Status:       Online\n|   Size:         1999721758720 B (2.0 TB)\n|   Free Space:   0 B (0 B)\n|   |\n|   +-< Physical Volume C9E220C8-418B-4BF4-81A2-627CC95AB7B4\n|   |   ----------------------------------------------------\n|   |   Index:    0\n|   |   Disk:     disk9\n|   |   Status:   Online\n|   |   Size:     1999721758720 B (2.0 TB)\n|   |\n|   +-> Logical Volume Family 135BA843-4D11-4DBE-82A4-4155B38FCC9D\n|       ----------------------------------------------------------\n|       Encryption Status:       Unlocked\n|       Encryption Type:         AES-XTS\n|       Conversion Status:       Complete\n|       Conversion Direction:    -none-\n|       Has Encrypted Extents:   Yes\n|       Fully Secure:            Yes\n|       Passphrase Required:     Yes\n|       |\n|       +-> Logical Volume CC7C3863-D3EE-495C-BDD5-06223560E072\n|           ---------------------------------------------------\n|           Disk:               disk16\n|           Status:             Online\n|           Size (Total):       1999402983424 B (2.0 TB)\n|           Size (Converted):   -none-\n|           Revertible:         No\n|           LV Name:            cornballer\n|           Volume Name:        cornballer\n|           Content Hint:       Apple_HFS\n|\n\n\nA: This lack of performance of Read improvement from a 2-disk RAID-1 is most definitely a design decision.  I have, for literally decades, measured nearly double the read throughput on OpenVMS systems with software RAID-1, particularly with separate controllers for each member of the Mirror set (which, FYI, OpenVMS calls a Shadow-set).\nFYI: If your objective is solely improving Read throughput, you can do so with a single controller (or I/O channel) that is more than twice as fast as the individual drives in a Mirror (RAID-1); however, with separate controllers (I/O channels) you also get a bit better fault-tolerance as well ... as long as the operating system supports continued operations when one controller fails.\n\nA: I created a RAID 1 set today using Disk Utility, and see read speeds 2x what I would expect from a single drive. So this may be supported now.\n", "Q: User Made Videos on iPhone 4S When I sync my iPhone 4S to my PC, I'm able to transfer pictures to my PC drive to make more room on my iPhone.\nWhy can't I transfer user made videos to my PC?

Swipe to the right on the song and there will be shown a delete button where you can delete the song from your iPhone and by so, saving space!\n\nIf you don't want all your iCloud music be shown in the overview, check off \"show all music\" in your settings.\nSorry for the Dutch language in the screenshots.

Features I would need:\n\n\n*\n\n*referenced/in-place management (images should remain where they are found on the drive)\n\n*support for eps/pdf/png/gif and some movies maybe\n\n*heavily customizable metadata (for me, the images are software generated, they are visualization of simulation data. It would be nice to embed some information of these simulations into the images.)\n\n*smart folders based on metadata\n\n\nOptionally:\n\n\n*\n\n*version control/non-destructive editing\n\n*quantitative image comparison\n\n\nPicasa is a good start, too bad it doesn't support eps or pdf, which makes it less than ideal for older LaTeX stuff. Just realized it also doesn't support smart folders... Big fail ! I guess I'm spoiled by Apple but I would have thought this would be pretty much standard in any app by now...\nAny other suggestion? Also, this might not be the most appropriate SE site for this question but it's pretty generic and since I'm looking at something on the Mac, I thought I would start here... Thanks in advance !\n\nA: Metadata and smart folders are supported as part of OS X and integrated into Finder. Very basic example:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder, pick any file(s) you want and select Get Info\n\n*In the Spotlight Comments field, enter tags, such as @fluid or @simulation (separate them by spaces).\n\n*From the File menu, select New Smart Folder\n\n*Click the plus icon to the right of Save\n\n*Select type Spotlight Comment (under Other...) and enter the tags you want in this smart folder, for example @fluid\n\n*Save and add the new smart folder to the Finder sidebar\n\n*Select the new smart folder and you will see all files with the @fluid tag\n\n\nPreview.app can view all of the above file types you've mentioned (and Quicktime + Perian can do so for movies). Now you just need an image editor for the rest.\n\nA: ACDSee Pro \nI'm looking for something similar.  We have thousands of images on a network drive that I'd like to manage using my MacBook Air, and the relatively small hard drive makes keeping the large catalogs needed for iPhoto, etc. impossible.  I just found that ACDSee is now available for the Mac and am going to give that a try.\n\nA: Would Adobe Lightroom or Apple Aperture meet your needs? Both are for advanced photo editing, but they also include features for cataloging and managing very large libraries of images, including metadata tools.\n", "Q: Is there a way to view one's iTunes Match content online?

Do they have the song I removed or do they not? If they do, under my account, I'd like to be able to remove it.\n\nA: No. The clients that access the data are iTunes on the Mac and Windows OS as well as the music app on iOS.\nI've seen some desktop iTunes libraries get messed up and not ask to delete a song from the cloud.

The EU has recently forced Apple to abide to the two-year warranty period mandated there. As I understand it, this is not a maker warranty, but a retailer warranty, so to keep things simple, assume for the following that I bought the product directly from Apple.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does it also apply to the online Apple shop, or only the retail stores?\n\n*Does it only apply to Italy (where a complaint was originally filed)?\n\n*Is this equivalent to a one-year extension of the normal one-year Apple Care you get? \n\n*Can I claim warranty (for a product bought in Europe) in Apple Stores outside of Europe (as I can with Apple Care)?\n\nA: It isn't quite correct that \"the EU\" has forced Apple to abide to these regulations. Rather, an Italian judge forced Apple to abide by Italian law. As a result, Apple has seen the light and adjusted its policies to comply with EU directives across the EU (as it was required to). \nEU countries implement EU directives, but generally have some freedom in those implementations. So details in individual countries may differ, although your questions are general enough that the answers below probably apply everywhere.\nThe regulations that Apple now has to comply with don't provide for warranty per-se. They do make retailers responsible for providing a product that is functional for its expected, reasonable lifetime.\nIn general:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, the online shop is a retailer, so it is responsible for providing you with a functional product.\n\n*No, these regulations apply in the entire EU, and AFAIK all EU countries have implemented them. Apple must comply in the entire EU. However, details of the rules that Apple must comply with may differ in specific countries.\n\n*Not really. While Apple serves as a manufacturer and a retailer here, the EU rules specifically apply to retailers, not manufacturers. In addition, AppleCare may provide protections or services that retailers aren't generally expected to provide, or can't (as in your question 4.)\n\n*Maybe. Apple may provide this as a service, but it isn't required to. If you bought an Apple item from an EU Apple Store, you can't then require a US Apple store to service your device; it's a different retailer.\n\n\nA: Apple has a short article explaining how support works - in the section on half way down is this section on how Apple's 1 year policy is in addition to any consumer laws in the place of purchase and not instead of those laws.\nHere is the relevant section pretty much verbatim from the above link separated by horizontal bars (so I can editorialize some more at the end):\n\nConsumer Law\nApple 1 year limited warranty and AppleCare Protection Plan benefits are in addition to rights provided by consumer law. For details click here. \nIf you think you have a valid consumer law claim, please contact us. \n\nSo, basically they have written some web pages detailing many specific policies as well as providing in country phone numbers (which are the main support numbers as far as I can tell) to request coverage as needed. Once you know where to look, Apple seems to be making intentional efforts in adhering to consumer protection laws where it does business.\nIn a nutshell, the EU protection covers defects present at the time of delivery and in the majority of cases, the responsibility of proving the defect existed at delivery falls on the consumer if you don't report the issue within 6 months of purchase. Also, the \"EU Warranty\" is requested by contacting the seller directly. The Apple 1 year warranty covers defects arising anytime during the first year of ownership and you can contact Apple directly for service rather than having to go to the seller.\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes, buying online or offline is the same\n\n*No the whole EU plus others (e.g., Switzerland)\n\n*No Apple-Care offers more (e.g., additional support).\n\n*Not sure but I don't think so. You have to contact the seller and not the producer.\nYou can find more information at:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/ecc/contact_en.htm\n\n*http://www.apple.com/uk/legal/warranty/\n", "Q: Can't downgrade or update jailbroken iPhone I can't update or downgrade my iPhone 3GS, Firmware 4.3.5 tethered with redsn0w. \nWhenever I try to update it, I get a \"device isn't eligible\" error. I researched on how to do that, like changing host files, but none of them worked for me. I use OS X Snow Leopard.\n##\n# Host Database\n#\n# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface\n# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.\n##\n127.0.0.1   localhost\n255.255.255.255 broadcasthost\n::1             localhost \nfe80::1%lo0 localhost\n74.208.10.249 gs.apple.com\n\nThis is my host file – not sure if it's the orginal one or not.\n\nA: The host file is not the original. That \n74.208.10.249 gs.apple.com\n\nresolves gs.apple.com to 74.208.10.249 (nginx.saurik.com) and not the real server by Apple, so that the SHSH trick works. Probably you have added it at some point. If you remove that you should be able to upgrade to iOS 5.1 using Apple's update. However, depending on the bootrom that you phone has, you may or may not be able to do a untethered jailbreak with Redsn0w, so be very careful before deciding whether you want to upgrade (although you say you have tethered jailbreak so probably you can live with tethered).\nAs for downgrading, I am not sure why you can't do this, chances are that you don't have SHSH for lower versions in Cydia.\nEdit: for downgrading you may have to use another IP address in the hosts file. I've seen 74.208.105.171 used recently (check the recent tutorials for saving SHSH blobs, the IP address may have changed)\n\nA: @lupincho is correct that you should remove the gs.apple.com line if you want to be able to upgrade to the latest version of iOS (5.1) using iTunes.\nIf you want to upgrade or downgrade to any iOS version other than the latest version, you'll need to have already saved SHSH blobs for that version. And more specifically, if you want to upgrade to iOS 5.x using SHSH blobs (such as to iOS 5.0.1), you need to stitch the SHSH blobs into custom firmware instead of using the host file trick due to changes in how Apple does the SHSH blob verification process. See here for a detailed guide to using SHSH blobs to restore to iOS 5.x.\n", "Q: Adobe Reader Updater legitimate? I just got the following popup:\n\nIs this a legitimate update from Adobe?\nThe reason I'm concerned:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Flashback virus started off as a fake Adobe Flash update.\n\n*The UI on the application does not look like it is using native components. It seems like it's running Java or something similar.\n\n*I didn't run anything to prompt this. It just popped up on its own.\n\n\nOther notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*This is an actual application (it appears in the dock).\n\n*The application has no about menu.\n\n*I do have Adobe Reader installed, but it wasn't running at the time. (In fact, I haven't launched it in a while.)\n\n*There is nothing related to Adobe Reader (or the updater) in my login items (System Prefs > Users > Login Items).\n\n*The process name shows up as Adobe Reader Updater in Activity Monitor.\n\n*The Details link goes to http://www.adobe.com/go/update_details which redirects to http://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/release-note/release-notes-acrobat-reader.html (However, that doesn't say much. Malware could just as easily link to the official website in order to appear legitimate.)\n\n\nA: It seems like it is legitimate for the following reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I launch Adobe Reader, it automatically updates the UI of the application to tell me that Adobe Reader needs to be closed in order for me to install this update.\n\n*My current version really is one below the one it's asking me to update to (10.1.2).\n\n*Under Adobe Reader's Update preferences, I had it checked to automatically download and prompt me to install updates.\n\n*Adobe's website shows that 10.1.3 really is the latest version.\n\n*When I run Help > Check for Updates, the same Adobe Reader Updater application is launched (or rather focused).\n\n\nA: This does not seem to be a legitimate update- I had gotten the same exact pop up. Even after I went to the official site and downloaded the latest version, that window continued to bug me about updating- it reminded me the same day despite the update. I would not trust it.\n", "Q: How to monitor iphone bandwidth for app testing? I'm testing an iphone app someone has developed for me. It seems that some of the files the app downloads are too large. \nIs there an app that monitors the network to allow me how much data my app consumes?\n\nA: If your developer has given you the source code you could use Instruments.app which can be used to monitor network activity.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the project in Xcode\n\n*Select Product->Profile from the menu\n\n*When Instruments opens select 'Activity Monitor' and then hit record\n\n\nA: Assuming the app uses HTTP(S) to download its file, use mitmproxy.

If all goes well, mitmproxy must be available in your $PATH.\n\n*Start mitmproxy by running mitmproxy.\n\n*Obtain the IP address of your computer by running ifconfig en1 (or whatever is the interface that you are using).\n\n*Set the proxy on your iPhone by going to your wireless settings, setting\nthe proxy to be “Manual”, and set the IP to be your computer’s IP and the port as 8080.\n\n", "Q: How to check if my iPhone's connection is being throttled? AT&T now throttles the connection speeds for those on the unlimited plan. How can I know if my iPhone's connection is being throttled or if I'm just getting poor speed due to other reasons?\n\nA: Whether your internet connection is slow may have several reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*poor, instable connection\n\n*geographic location\n\n*total traffic on the network\n\n*you've reached your cap (see contract)\n\n\nFor the normal users it's difficult to determine what the exact reason is. Especially in dense areas, the promised speed is not reached sometimes because the total traffic of all users is very high. Where I live, the same network is used by different providers, adding additional complications.\nIn order to judge if your network connection slower than usual, you should test and record your network speed for several times throughout a month.\nYou can use Mobile Speed Test to get stats about Download, Upload and Ping. You can use this data to check the speed you've been promised by your provider. Check your contract to see what speed you have been promised. Most contracts throttle the speed after you have reached a cap.\n\n\n", "Q: Stop downloading Lion from the App store So, I bought a new Mac book Air recently, opened up the AppStore and found \"Lion\" in the featured updates.\nI thought that was shown because I was not running lion and clicked on it to upgrade. Later mucked around the system to figure that I was running Lion and my system had been updated to the latest version of Lion.\nBut because I clicked the Install on the Lion in the appstore,\n\n\n*\n\n*I am charged with $30, which I don't really have to pay.\n\n*My launchpad now displays the Lion as downloading.\n\n\nI can't seem to stop the launchpad icon from downloading and can't remove it from there.\nNow my queries:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to \"un-install\" from the appstore. How?\n\n*Once the Lion completes download, will my system be updated again to the same version of the OS? What happens to the installed apps\n\n*Is it possible that somehow I can get back my $30, which is a wrong charge.\n\n*How do I stop the download from happening, prevent re-install and remove that downloading icon from Launchpad?\n\n\nI probably acted a little stupid by clicking to buy that in the first place without even knowing my system runs Lion. But in my defense, I didn't think an app that I don't need to install would download and charge me; not by Apple.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Purchasing is like being pregnant, but a little more black and white. It either went through or it didn’t. In your case, you can pause the download and delete the temporary file (turn off automatic downloads) and then decide if it’s worth it to ask for a refund.\n\nIs it possible that somehow I can get back my $30, which is a wrong charge?\n\nTo apply for a refund, contact Mac App Store Support.\n\nA: I think your use of the phrase \"featured updates\" gives it away I'm afraid.  There is no such thing, there is an updates section which will provide for free updates to any App Store purchase you have already made, and also (on the 'front') page) a \"featured\" section displaying featured apps.  You've had a mixup in what is being offered, and purchased by accident.\nThis Featured section is not personalised to you in any way, everyone sees the same one (App Store location dependant I imagine), and it's quite possible for it to show programs that you already own.\nThe key is that the App store only really knows about stuff you have bought from the App store, as indicated by the fact that the purchases are tied to your Apple ID.  Exceptions to this rule exist (iWork apps etc can show up as \"installed\" even though they were not installed through the App Store, but they cannot be updated, or redownloaded), but it's perfectly possible and indeed normal to own and even have installed a piece of software that originated from outside the App store that it simply does not know about.  These could be versions of apps purchased direct from the developer, or in your case a copy of Lion that is tied to your Macbook rather than your Apple ID.\nThis is an important distinction to make, and one you have not fully realised after purchasing Lion effectively for a second time via the App store.\nA few things to note about your purchase, now that it's been done (I'll leave the other answers to discuss how to attempt refunds etc, as they seem to have it covered)\n\n\n*\n\n*Your App Store purchase, unlike the version that came with your Macbook Air, is licensed to your Apple ID, and you can use it on any other Macs in your household, so if you have other machines a single purchase can be used on them all.  Your pre-installed copy does not allow for this\n\n*You are only downloading an Installer for Lion.  It will not install unless you run it.  Even if you run it, it will not materially affect your install - it would only be a waste of time effectively overwriting your OS files with identical ones\n\n*Since you have downloaded it anyway, note that machines that have Lion pre-installed do not provide you with restore media, and they expect you to use internet recovery anyway if you require to access the install media in future.  As you have a copy downloaded, you can store this on a DVD or Memory stick, which will speed up restore times in the future if it is ever required.  You can create bootable disc or USB media from the download too, to further improve your future recovery options.\n\n\nSo, although you made a mistake in purchasing it, it's not the end of the world, and for $30 if you are unable to get a refund I would not be too upset so long as you take advantage of the situation by making the best of it and bearing the above points in mind.\n", "Q: Safari Auto-Extract ZIP File Upon Download When I download a zip file through Safari it automatically extracts it into a new folder named as the ZIP file is.  Is there a way to disable the auto extract feature and just leave the file as is in ZIP format?\n\nA: In Safari go to Preferences -> General and uncheck Open \"safe\" files after downloading. This disables automatic extracting of archives, including zip files. As noted below the check box this will disable automatic opening of PDFs, text documents, movies and pictures.\n\nA: You can also hold the ALT (OPTION) key when clicking the download link  (tested and working on Safari v6.0.5)\n", "Q: I have a Dual G5 Power Mac I can only start in safe mode Processor: Dual 2 GHz PowerPC G5\nMemory: 1.5 GB DDR SDRAM\nI can only start with a safe boot.\nI've used the Leopard disk to run Disk Utility to repair the disks. There appears to be no problems. Verify disks returns no errors and a repair disks also finished with no errors.\nI'm stuck for ideas...\n\nA: Based on what you have described, it appears that there is an issue occurring with a kernel extension, driver, or something along those lines.  This is what is causing your machine to kernel panic when attempting to boot up normally. Safe mode is disabling the problematic \"thing\" and that is why you machine boots fine in safe mode. For more information on whats is going on when you boot in safe mode see Mac OS X: What is Safe Boot, Safe Mode?, this may be valuable in diagnosing a cause of the kernel panic on start-up.\nSo some next steps for you to take:\nFirst thing is figure out what is causing the kernel panic. Boot into safe mode and then open the Console program. Located at /Applications/Utilities/Console\nWhen in the Console application look for the logs noted as PanicReporter, if we are lucky there should be one for each time you tried to boot the machine with a failed boot up. According to Mac OS X: How to log a kernel panic, kernel panic logs for Leopard are stored in /Library/Logs/PanicReporter, so check for logs at that path in console.\nIf you find logs do a quick read thru of of the first 20 or so lines and see if you recognize the name for a piece of hardware /software or something, feel free to post what you find as well to help in solving the problem.\nOnce you have figured out what driver/s or extension/s is causing the problem the next step is to determine if it is a driver that you installed. If it is then look up how to remove and additionally re-install it or update it if it is something you need. \nIf its a driver for something else built into the computer it could be indicating a hard ware failure for some kind of device, eg network card, etc. Or it could be just a corrupted software driver, and you may need to backup your date and re install the Mac OS.\n", "Q: Is it possible to copy paste between Mac OS and its virtual machine? I am running Mac OS X Lion 10.7.3, and I have installed VMware to run virtual machines: Windows 7 and Ubuntu 11.10.\nI have also installed VM Tools.\nI would like to know if it is possible allow copy paste among the three systems? It seems that, by default (just by mouse) it is not permitted.\nEdit1: I am using VMware Fusion 4.1.2, and the Settings for both Windows and Ubuntu is as follows:\n \nEdit2: I just realize that the copy paste (both two directions) between Mac and Windows work by default. But the copy paste between Mac and Ubuntu or Ubuntu and Windows does not work...\nBy the way, I just want to copy texts...\nEdit3: I just shut down the 2 virtual machines, and rebooted them, and copying and pasting texts among them works fine... It is really odd... So I guess I had done something on my Ubuntu, which disabled copying and pasting, then rebooting Ubuntu reset it...  \n\nA: You can find a lot of documentation about copy/paste, drag and drop,... on the website of VMWare, and they stated: \n\nTo use the copy and paste feature, VMware Tools must be installed on\n  the virtual machine.\n\nBut since you've already installed those tools, I recommend you reinstall them. Just to be sure.\nAlso, make sure you don't stumble upon the limits of this feature:  \n\n  \n*\n  \n*You cannot copy and paste or drag and drop content that exceeds the internal buffer limit of 4MB.\n  \n*Copy and paste or drag and drop of formatted text containing images might not work across different operating systems.\n  \n*Copying and pasting files from the host to an Outlook email message or compressed folder in the guest and vice versa might fail. \n  Workaround: Copy files from host to the guest desktop first and then\n  paste the files from the guest desktop into the Outlook email message\n  or compressed folder.\n  \n\n\nA: Yes Copy and paste is supported, but it depends on what you are doing. If you are trying to copy and paste files using a right click and copy command in the Finder, and then trying to right click and paste in a Windows VM for example that will not work since VMware does not support copying files that way. When moving files between VMs Drag and drop is the feature to use  (where supported with VMWare tools, etc)in order to move files from the host computer to each guest VM and the opposite is true too.\nNow if you want to copy text using the clipboard, that works between the host and each supported virtual machine with the tools installed as noted in Moving and Copying Files and Text Between Virtual Machines and Your Mac\n\nYou can drag files and folders to move and copy them between your virtual machines and your Mac. You can move text by copying and pasting or cutting and pasting.\nYou can also drag images between Windows applications and Mac applications. You can drag Outlook attachments from a Windows virtual machine to your Mac. You can drag files in a virtual machine directly onto Mac applications.\nYou can copy and paste images and formatted text between a Windows or Linux virtual machine and your Mac.\n\nFor example select text in a Mac OS X application and copy it to clipboard (Command-C). Then go into a windows VM and put your cursor in a text area and then perform a control-v you should get what you originally copied on your Mac host.\nAccording to other documentation for VMware Workstation\n\nThe copy and paste feature has the following restrictions:\n• Copying and pasting email attachments is restricted to images or files smaller than 4MB.\n•Copying and pasting plain text and formatted text (including the formatting) is restricted to amounts less than 4MB.\n•Copying and pasting text is restricted to text in languages that can be represented by Unicode characters.\n•Workstation uses the PNG format to encode images that are copied and pasted. Copying and pasting images is restricted to images smaller than 4MB after conversion to PNG format.\n•You cannot copy and paste files between virtual machines.\n•On Windows 95 and Windows 98 guests, copying and pasting is restricted to plain text in amounts less than 64KB.\n\nThe Vmware Fusion for Mac Documentation fails to mention any limitations on copy paste size limits, etc but it is same to assume the limitations are probably transferable to the Mac version of VMware as well.\n\nA: I got here searching for how to enable copy and paste between an OS X VM and an OS X host, but I just had to install VMware Tools by selecting Virtual Machine > Install VMware Tools. It didn't add support for copying files, but I just added a shared folder from Virtual Machine > Settings > Sharing.\nEdit: I got here again when I couldn't get copy and paste to work between a Ubuntu VM and an OS X host. I had to reinstall VMware Tools based on the instructions at http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1022525:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose Virtual Machine > Reinstall VMware Tools\n\n*Extract the tar.gz file on the disk image to the desktop\n\n*Run cd ~/Desktop/vmware-tools-distrib; sudo ./vmware-install.pl -d\n\n*Restart\n\n\nA: when I want to copy a file greater than 4 MB from win7-8-? to OSX VM I just share a directory and use the network (LAN).. or just use a USB flash drive.. same for text..\nthis goes for Linux-Opensuse, etc. also\n", "Q: iTerm2 more contrast to active tab Is there a way using iTerm2 to give the active tab more contrast compared to the rest of the tabs? \n\n\nA: Yes, you can choose a Tab Style in the preferences, under the \"Appearance\" pane.\nThe standard styles \"Metal\" and \"Unified\" appear to offer better contrast for the active tab than the other two. From your screenshot, it appears you have selected \"Adium\" which does indeed have very poor contrast.\n\n\nA: One workaround I found is to set the tab color to a pale and greyish color e.g. 47736b in Profile->Colors->Tab Color and have Light High Contrast theme active. The active tab will have a light bright color.\n\nA: I found that the setting Advanced → Tab → \"How prominent .. outline around selected tab ..\" set to largest (3)  makes the selected tab most obvious.\n\n", "Q: Pipe sound output to file? Is there a way to either pipe the sound output of the computer to a file or record what the computer puts out? I know I could use a headphone to microphone cord, but I was hoping for a more elegant solution. Google doesn't give very good results.\n\nA: You might want to take a look at Audio Hijack Pro which can record any audio you can hear on your computer. Free to try.\nThere's also the cheaper, simpler Piezo from the same company.\n\nA: These days, I prefer the Blackhole virtual audio driver, together with its Multi-Output Device, which can, for example, mix your regular computer audio with Blackhole to record (Blackhole) and listen (to the regular computer audio) simultaneously.\n", "Q: Microsoft Word on MacBook Pro: Tab problems While working on an existing document (a simple three-column Word table), the document has stuck on the \"Table Layout\" tab. When I try to open another tab eg Home, or Document Elements, the toolbar sort of bounces up and down and stays stuck on \"table layout\". I've tried closing down Word and re-opening it. No luck. I tried shutting down my computer and restarting it. No luck. Any other ideas?\n\nA: There is an old trick I learned on a help desk well over 10 years ago which USUALLY still works.\nIn the problematic document, turn on paragraph marks. It's in the ribbon under \"Paragraph.\" or Press COMMAND-* (Mac) or CTRL-* (PC) [EG SHIFT COMMAND/CTRL 8].\nSelect All in the document. Use the edit menu or click in the document and COMMAND-A (Mac) or CTRL-A (PC).\nScroll to the bottom of the document and locate the very LAST paragraph mark at the very end of the document.\nPress the shift key and click just to the LEFT of the last paragraph mark, thus de-selecting it.\nNow everything in the document is selected EXCEPT the last paragraph mark.\nRelease the shift key, and tap COMMAND-C (Mac) or CTRL-C (PC).\nCreate a new empty Word Document.\nClick in the document and paste what you just copied from the old, problematic, document into the new one. Save the new document under a different name and see if your formatting/behavior issues have gone away.\nWhen I learned that trick I was told that MS Word stores document formatting in the last paragraph marker. Regardless of whether that is true or not it will often fix problematic MS Word documents.\n\nA: The answer has been found here:\nRibbon tabs in Office/Word/Excel 2011 stop working\n\nWhile the majority of the tab isn't clickable, the very top edge of the tab is. So just click on its top border.\n\nIt is slightly inconvenient, but better than risking the destruction of your installation. I've posted the remark on the Microsoft community forum. Hopefully they'll fix this issue.\n\nA: Try trashing the Word preferences file at ~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.Word.plist. (You should probably also get rid of the ~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.Word.plist.lockfile at the same time.)\n", "Q: How to delete a folder, even in every backups of Time Machine? I just noticed that a folder containing personal documents was still on my main disk. I copied to my personal disk (password protected), but I want to also delete the copies which are stored in the multiple backups that Time Machine has made over the years.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: This functionality is built into Time Machine.\nLaunch Time Machine. Right click on the folder of choice, and select \"Delete All Backups...\" from the menu. This will comb through all your backups and delete all traces of that folder and its contents.\n\n\nA: There's this pretty good comercial tool called Back-In-Time ($30; but I purchased it as part of a MacUpdate Promo pack). It will let you delete a single item from the TimeMachine backup, or even ALL backups of some item (though it doesn't seem to work reliably if the item has been renamed and thus backed up under different names).\nOf course, there are cheaper options, too. See this question, and this video tutorial.\n", "Q: Hide/Block System Preference Panes? I have just discovered that System Preference panes such as Mouse and Keyboard cannot be locked, this is a problem as one user could log in change the strings and then another user would log in and could become confused as to why they have changed.\nIs there anyway of blocking or locking these preference panes? I need access to them as an administrator but I want all other users not to have access just like any other preference pane.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure the Mouse and Keyboard preference panes are per-user settings: if one user logs in and changes settings, a different user's login shouldn't be affected.\nIf you still want to disable the preference panes, check out Diablotin. You can use that to disable preference panes (among other things) and it can be locked with a password.\n", "Q: Xcode stops running when I don't watch it for a while. What's wrong? I am (trying to be) running Xcode 4.3.2. on Lion 10.7.3\nI noticed that when I stop watching Xcode and walk away from the computer for a while (like half an hour or so), Xcode in the mean time stopped running and has to be started again.\nI read a lot about Xcode on Lion being unstable. Is that what is happening to me? Is it that unstable?\n\nA: This may be the built in \"undocumented\" to non-developers feature of Lion called Automatic Termination that is causing Xcode to quit when you don't want it to.\nAs noted in \"Lion Is a Quitter\"\n\nLion will quit your running applications behind your back if it decides it needs the resources, and if you don’t appear to be using them. The heuristic for determining whether an application is “in use” is very conservative: it must not be the active application, it must have no visible, non-minimized windows — and, of course, it must explicitly support Automatic Termination.\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to disable OS X auto termination of applications? Is there a way to tell OS X Lion to disable auto-termination for a given application that you do not want to auto terminate?\nFYI Lion is a quitter if you did not already know, what if you don't want it to be for a certain Applicaiton.\n\nLion will quit your running applications behind your back if it decides it needs the resources, and if you don’t appear to be using them. The heuristic for determining whether an application is “in use” is very conservative: it must not be the active application, it must have no visible, non-minimized windows — and, of course, it must explicitly support Automatic Termination.\n\nFor example, say I don't want TextEdit to automatically quit when I have no TextEdit windows open and switch to another Application.\nAfter taking a look at Mac App Programming Guide section for Automatic Termination I figured I would try adding the NSSupportsAutomaticTermination key with the value of No to the Info.plist file for TextEdit. (Did not work: TextEdit crashes on open.)\nTo be noted, the file did not include NSSupportsAutomaticTermination key (which means that Apple was using NSProcessInfo to enable auto termination), so adding a key would probably have no effect anyways since NSProcessInfo overrides what is in the plist file. (Verified this does not work, by self-signing TextEdit with a modified Info.plist including the NSSupportsAutomaticTermination key and value of No).\nOne side effect noted is that changing anything in the Info.plist file causes TextEdit to crash when opening. The cause is noted from the crash log as \"code signature invalid\", which means that the TextEdit app and all its contents are code signed. The workaround is to self-sign the app using the codesign command and a self-signed root certificate as noted in Code Signing task. \nAfter what I have tried so far, TextEdit still obeys Automatic Termination.\n\nA: Your wish is my Terminal command ;-)\ndefaults write -g NSDisableAutomaticTermination -bool yes\n\nNote that since Automatic Termination doesn't really quit the applications, but rather hides them, they must have been properly quit for this to take effect.\n\nA: There's a sure-fire way to fix this, if your hardware supports it. You can upgrade from Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) to Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard).\nWhile not all hardware that will run Lion can support this improved operating system (sadly, my mid-2011 MacBook Air does not), it includes such features as non-auto-termination, Rosetta (which enables Intel processors to run software compiled for PPC processors), and compatibility with per-app recording features in the excellent WireTap Studio.\nAs with any upgrade, some features are lost (such as Mission Control, Launch Pad, some gestures) and some operating system quirks take some getting used to (the direction of scrolling is reversed, for instance), but all in all, it's a fine upgrade.\n", "Q: What RFID options exist for iOS devices? If I wanted to use an iOS device (iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad) to gather data from RFID chips on equipment in a motor pool, what would I need? Is it even possible today?\n\nA: What type of RFID tags are you trying to read?  For a motor pool, I would expect you are looking for UHF Gen 2 RFID or even active tags (like Bluetooth LE) as opposed to NFC where you would need to be standing right at the tag on the auto to read it.\nWe are developing a UHF Gen 2 RFID system for iOS/Android.  The device, unfortunately, needs to be larger than a square since the 10' read range of UHF Gen 2 RFID requires a bigger antenna. Our dev site explains this.\n\nA: check out TSL UK - their 1128 docks iPads etc. http://www.tsl.uk.com/products/1128-bluetooth-handheld-uhf-rfid-reader/\n\nA: Take a look at www.touchtechnologies.co.uk for details on our r-touch solution that turns iOS devices into RFID (GenII) &/or barcode reading devices. Really neat, one charger charges both dock &iOS device simultaneously!!\n\nA: You should look in to http://AsReader.com for UHF and UF RFID solutions for iOS devices.  They have compact dock style readers that can move between iPod touch, iPhone, and iPad mini, Air, & Pro.  Their readers range from 250 mW to 1 Watt in power and have a unique magnetic charging system. Thousands of these readers are in use at a major automobile manufacturer in Japan as well, so your use for motor pool might be a great fit.\n\nA: Yes there is a RFID dongle that is compatible for iOS devices. \nPower is about 1/4 watt.\n", "Q: Email setup on iPhone 4S deleted contacts, reminders, and calendar dates When I synced my phone to microsoft exchange account, all of my contacts, reminders, and calendar dates were erased. \nThis is what I did: \n\n\n*\n\n*Settings\n\n*mail, contacts, calendars\n\n*add account\n\n*microsoft exchange\n\n*put in my school email\n\n\nThe settings were found and my email synced. I went to place a call and all of my contacts were deleted. I do not have a mac and nor did i do anything using my iTunes account. \nHow can I get all of my contacts, calendar dates, and reminders back and keep my email set up on my phone?\n\nA: When you created the Exchange account, I think it ask you if you want to keep your contacts or replace them with the ones on the Exchange. And it surely works the same for calendar events and reminders.\nIt appears you asked your phone to replace your already existing contacts list with the empty one from Exchange.\nYour best shot to get your contacts back is to restore a previous backup, and then, when re-setting your phone, be careful to what it's asking you.\n", "Q: How can I get a screenshot of what's on my AppleTV? Preferably Wirelessly. Any apps for that?\nObviously I'm talking about the more recent iOS powered little black box AppleTV, not the original model.\n\nA: After some quick Googling I found these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Jailbreak\n\n*Install aTV Flash (black)\n\n*Install nitoTV\n\n*Install 'screencapture' (through nitoTV)\n\n*SSH in: ssh root@Apple-TV.local (or ssh root@ipaddress, e.g. ssh root@192.168.3.61)\n\n*At this point typing in screencapture SHOULD save Screenshot.png to root. If it does not you may need to change ownership on root via: chown mobile:staff ./\n\n\nObviously less than ideal, but possible.\n\nA: As far as I know AppleTV has no capabilities for this. What I've done is simply to take a photo of the TV screen. \n", "Q: New programs must be launched twice in 10.7.3? I noticed recently that new programs (newly installed or downloaded) are not opening on first try on my MacBook Pro, or on my wife's MacBook. Both are running 10.7.3.\nOn first launch, new programs take a very long time to start. When they do show up in the Dock, they either bounce for a long, long time and then immediately exit, or finally stop bouncing and show up as if closed (I still have the little highlight turned on so I can see what is open or closed). When clicked, the icon disappears from the Dock. When I re-launch the app, it opens instantly with no issues - it is just the initial launch that seems screwy.\nHave not been able to figure out what is happening with this, as my searches elsewhere haven't turned anything up. Any ideas? Related to some kind of sandboxing? It's not a huge issue but it is kind of annoying.\n\nA: This may be another case of Lion being a quiter. And utilizing OS X Lion's Auto Termination and additionally OS X Lions Sudden Termination feature. \n\nLion will quit your running applications behind your back if it decides it needs the resources, and if you don’t appear to be using them. The heuristic for determining whether an application is “in use” is very conservative: it must not be the active application, it must have no visible, non-minimized windows — and, of course, it must explicitly support Automatic Termination.\n\nA program that is \"taking to long to start\" seems like a perfect candidate for the OS to kill.\nAlso it makes perfect sense for when you come back the second time and they start up, since Lion would have saved state on the program.\n\nA: If they're downloaded, you need to confirm that you want to run them before they'll start. (This is the \"This program was downloaded from [website] on [date]. Do you want to run it?\" dialog.)\nAre they timing out at that dialog (while they wait for you to confirm it)?\n\nA: Dr.nixon, you mentioned the application causing the problem in your reply to MrDaniel.  The application causing you problems is The Unarchiver.  I tried running programs in a new user account and them worked there.  I noticed this was because I was opening zip files with the built in mac \"archive utility\".\nI installed the program Archiver instead and opened rar files and zip files and ran then opened the applications that I'd just unarchived.  I no longer experienced the applications bouncing in dock then disappearing after I closed the \"This program was downloaded from..\" dialog.\nSo find a new utility to unarchive and it should fix your problems...which sucks because I The Unarchiver is definitely my favorite utility of it's kind, it both functions and looks like an utility made by apple (plus it's free).  I think I'll send an bug report to the folks who make The Unarchiver.\n", "Q: Unable to update MacPorts: \"symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64\" I'm trying to run sudo port selfupdate to but part of the build process seems to be generating errors.

I've tried some cursory searches on the output around where it runs aground, but with no luck.\nCan anyone help?\n\nA: Apparently it's caused by a non-MacPorts Mono installation, whose sqlite3 is being linked against by MacPorts. To work around the problem I temporarily moved /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework to somewhere else and re-ran port selfupdate.\nDetails: http://trac.macports.org/ticket/25318\n", "Q: VMware Fusion virtual machine from a local partition When you have a Windows partition on your system, VMware can see and boot a virtual machine from partition. \nHowever, with other OS X and Linux partition, there's no such option. Is there a way to make a virtual machine and \"link\" the local partition?\n\nA: This guide appears to show how to do this.  Looks like there's some manual commands on the command line to create a vmdk file with a pointer to the raw device:\nhttp://andrewfarley.com/mac/raw-disks-from-vmware-fusion\n", "Q: How do i turn off email notifications on my laptop? I keep getting email's notifying me of my upcoming meetings. This would be fine, but i never asked it to do this. \nI use Gmail for email and Google Calendar for my scheduling. On my laptop Mail.app and iCal are linked to my Google account although I never use either of them. \nCan someone point me in the right direction for turning email notifications off? \n\nA: *\n\n*sign in to google calendar at http://google.com/calendar\n\n*Click on the 'gear' icon at the top right and choose 'Calendar Settings'\n\n*Click on 'Calendars' \n\n*Click on 'Notifications' for the appropriate calendar\n\n*look for 'Event reminders' and remove the 'By default, remind me via [Email]' entry\n\n\nA: The answer on this page might help, especially the 4th suggestion: http://www.quora.com/OS-X-10-8-Mountain-Lion/Is-there-a-way-to-completely-disable-OS-X-Mail-app-to-fire-up-and-send-Calendar-notifications\n", "Q: iTerm as a slide-out terminal from the top of the screen I have installed iTerm2 and was hoping I'd have something like guake (Yes I just switched from Ubuntu). I mapped the hotkey to a button of my choice and it works fine, but I miss the slide-down-from-top animation like I had in Ubuntu.\n\nA: While iTerm2 suggestion is a good one, it has a few problems of its own.\nThe hotkey activates all iTerm2 windows.  Before OS X 10.11 El Capitan I used TotalTerminal (Visor) and I loved it.  I had Visor sliding from top down and I used iTerm2 too, depending on task etc.  iTerm2 itself seemed not enough for me when I moved to El Capitan.\nBut there's a way to closely replicate my old setup.  A tine app called Apptivate can assign global keyboard shortcut to any application, script, etc.  And they can be switched on and off (hidden) with the same shortcuts.  Thus you can easily use Apple's Terminal in a way you used Visor (except for the animation).  So I'm back with my old combo (Terminal.app + iTerm2) and it's close to ideal.  Maybe it will help you too.\n\nA: Turn on multiple desktops, have 2, one on top one on bottom.  Assign a hotkey to switch to the TOP desktop. Open iTerm2 and put it in the top desktop and open all other apps on the bottom desktop.  Either make the terminal maximized or full screen (lion) and it should give you something similar to what your're looking for.\n\nA: You can use iTerm2's system-wide hotkey with the Hotkey Window profile to do this.\nIn iTerm2 preferences, click on the \"Keys\" tab and choose \"Hotkey\". Click \"Create a Dedicated Hotkey Window…\" and assign the hotkey you'd like to use.\nCheck the \"Hotkey toggles a dedicated window with profile:\" option and choose \"Hotkey Window\" in the popup menu below (should be selected by default).\nWith default settings, the Hotkey Profile window will stretch across the top of the screen, and the hotkey will drop the window down from the top, complete with animation.\n\n\nYou can customize the settings for the \"Hotkey Window\" profile under the \"Profiles\" tab.

Can I clone this to a 256 GB SSD drive? (My goal is to replace the boot spinning drive with an SSD drive.) Then use the 500 GB HD as a second drive in the SuperDrive bay. \nCan I clone to the SSD if it's in a USB enclosure as well?\nAnd what is the best cloning software?\nI'm running OS X Lion, if that's useful.\n\nA: You can do that, however having so little space left on the SSD after cloning might be an issue when you start running the machine.\nYou can use either Disk Utility (in Utilities, or better, you could start from the Snow Leopard DVD and start it from there); SuperDuper! (I've used that), or Carbon Copy Cloner. But be very careful, make sure that you don't switch the source and target (you'll lose everything) and make sure that you can boot from the SSD and that everything works before deleting the old drive. Find some tutorials (SuperDuper and Carbon Copy Cloner have them on their websites) print them and make sure that you understand each step before proceeding with the cloning.\nAlternatively, if you can find or borrow another disk, you can create a Time Machine backup of the internal disk, replace it with the SSD and restore from Time Machine. It would be slower, but you'll have an extra copy (the Time Machine disk) just in case.\n\nA: Clone larger HDD drive to smaller SSD drive on Mac. Or migrate from an HDD to SSD.\nThe fastest and most efficient way can be done completely using standard tools in OS X.\nThis solution does not require any reinstall, all the way setup of user account and Mac settings, or separate programs or much more time consuming operations than direct disk to disk data transfer.\nYou need: 1 SSD drive and USB SATA adapter, it can be any enclosure, or SATA to USB adapter cable, or if you have thunderbolt or any faster connection this is even more preferred.\n\n*\n\n*Always have regular backup. Time Machine is recommended way. Do it to external HDD or Time Capsule device.\n\n*Boot you Mac into Recovery mode. Reboot your Mac and immediately hold Cmd+R during POST stage (black screen).\n\n*Open Disk Utility, locate your existing HDD and select primary partition on the left (mount point /, Type: Logical Partition), this can be named Macintosh HD and in First Aid click Verify Disk, to make sure you are error free before start.\n\n*On the left now select primary disk it self (Type Logical Volume Group), and on the right select Partition tab, click + sign and drag primary partition (e.g. Macintosh HD) to resize to size smaller than new target SSD disk. Click Apply.\n\n*Now you have to prepare new SSD drive. Connect new SSD drive to Mac if not done so yet, and select it on left in Disk Utility. Click Erase tab and chose name for new device, I recommend to name it SSD, so you can clearly see difference in next steps. This name is for temporary use only.\nUnder format choose Mac OS X Extended (journaled) and click Erase.\nNote: if this disk already was initialized or used on other system like Windows, please delete all existing partitions before this step and start like new! This is important to have new system bootable.\n\n*Poweroff and physically swap disks. Do not erase or start using old disk until everything is finished. Do not connect original disk until you are done.\n\n*Perform actual data cloning. Boot you Mac into Recovery mode again (Cmd+R). Select Original Primary partition on the left (Macintosh HD) and on the right select Restore tab. Drag SSD prepared partition to Destination field (you called it SSD). Click Restore and wait so many hours, how many you have to physically copy your data from one drive to another.\n\n*Reboot to Recovery mode again and choose Boot from main partition in new SSD. Click the Apple menu on the bar at the top of screen and select Startup Disk to access the Choose Startup Disk tool. The boot option will be named exactly the same as was in original hard drive, thus just select it and system will reboot into this his.\nNote: this step is necessary to avoid boot wait, because Mac cannot find original disk anymore, and starts into SSD only after about 30 seconds as recovery boot sequence.\n\n*Reboot and system will boot fast into old Mac OS X system. Now you are done :)\n\nNote: if your system waits about half a minute before booting when only a new disk is left on the system, then press Alt/option key during startup and just select Mac OS X system. This will reset the default OS and will clear boot wait for old device.\n2020 macOS Catalina, Big Sur APFS update:\nIf you are on APFS already, this task becomes even more trivial.\n\n*\n\n*Just do all steps except repartitioning and shrinking original drive.\n\n*Also format new SSD drive with APFS.\n\nIf you have amount of data in original APFS Volume which fits your new hard drive, there is nothing to stop you, just recover your new drive APFS Volume with old drive Macintosh HD as a source.\nChecked and confirmed its working when I was migrating old SSD to larger SSD drive, also HDD or SSD drive to NVME drive.\n\nA: I did this just today and wanted to share my experience:\n\n*\n\n*I connected the SSD via a USB connection.\n\n\n*The Disk Utility in my 2012 MacBook Pro was not able to clone to a smaller SSD. Also it was unable to partition the current HDD to a size smaller than the SSD, like Arunas Bartisius said in another answer.\nSo I got the Disk Utility to just erase the SSD and format as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) (aka Journaled HFS+).\n\n\n*Then I installed the Carbon Copy Cloner on the system and cloned the HDD to the SSD (it had no issues since the size of data was smaller than the SSD).\n\n\n*Then I made sure that I could boot from the SSD by restarting my Mac, pressing and holding the Option key and selecting the SSD, as explained here: https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-your-mac-startup-disk-mchlp1034/mac\n\n\n*Then I opened my MacBook Pro, swapped the HDD with the SSD.\n\n\n*Booted into the SSD. Then I also finally updated to Catalina.\n\nA: What is the useable disk space of your 256 GB SSD when it is formatted for Mac, but empty? I'll bet it's quite a bit less than 256 GB.\nIt is a general rule of thumb that hard drives do not work efficiently unless at least 15% of the volume of the drive (as formatted for your OS) is empty space. This is necessary for file defragmentation, a maintenance operation which Mac OS X performs automatically in the background.\nSo you should not put more than about 217 GB of data on a hard drive that has 256 GB of capacity when it is formatted but empty. If you actually have a full 256 GB to use, at least 38 GB should be left empty. If you do fill up more space than 217 GB, your computer will work, but the performance of the computer will become slower over time due to data fragmentation.\n\nA: I'd clean off at least 20GB from the hard drive. Then install a clean OS to the SSD and use migration assistant to move the rest of the drive over to SSD. \nI found that after a few years, the Mac just slowed down. Installing a fresh OS and then migrating apps and files improved performance quite a bit. Why move clutter along with the files you want? \n\nA: You can do a couple of things if you intend to use an SSD in addition to your regular drive.\nFirstly, using Disk Utility is likely to be the easiest way to clone it, so long as you are sure that it will fit.  Open Disk Utility, select your existing disk, and click the \"restore\" button in the top right.  You will have something like the following screenshot, although in my instance I do not have any other disks.\n\nIn your own window, you will see your SSD disk in the left hand column.  Drag it's name into the destination field.  This will create a copy of the source disk, onto the destination disk.  You may need to partition your SSD first - ensure it uses the same GUID partition scheme and options as your existing drive.\nNext, prove you can boot from it.  Hold the Option key down, and select the SSD to boot from.  It should be identical, but way faster.\nNow, you can choose how to take advantage of it, and your other disk.  As you are already nearly full on your boot drive, you need to clear some stuff off it.  A good choice for things that don't necessarily require speed are your iTunes library and iPhoto library, as well as any iMovie files.  These are most people large file collections, and there isn't usually much requirement to have them accessed lightening fast.\nMoving such data and folders around is one way to clear up a chunk of space to leave your SSD room to \"breathe\" without worrying about filling it, but it's a manual process that can be prone to error, as well as confusing for backups etc.\nAnother thing you can try is moving your entire home folder.  Luckily, you don't even have to move it to test this option.  Go into preferences, and locate your user.  Right click on your name on the left column, and click advanced.  You will see an option to store your home folder elsewhere.  Click choose, and point it at your old disk.  It will now boot from your SSD, but use the old drive for your home folder.  This effectively moves all your data, but none of your apps off the SSD, which is a simple and efficient way to get a good balance between speed and capacity requirements.  If you have large apps that don't need speed, you can move them into your home folders app folders to get them off the SSD too.\n\nOnce you have done this, and proved that it all works fine, you have some cleanup to do.  You can either just wipe the old disk, then re-copy and delete (move, effectively) your home folder back into it, of you can manually just remove the hold folder on your SSD, and all the OS folders on the original disk expect your home folder.\nThere are millions of ways to skin this particular cat, this is just one (albeit the simplest one), and its what I intend to do as soon as my optibay arrives :)\n", "Q: OCR software for handwritten notes I am looking for a way to recognize handwriting of scanned notes (in PDF format).\nIt doesn't have to be perfect, and it doesn't have to free, but before paying I would like to try it (even with just a single page).\nIt doesn't necessarily have to be a native Mac OS X application. I would be OK with an online application, or a Unix application to install or compile. In other words, anything that works somewhat decently would be OK.\nI am also not necessarily looking for a perfect result. Even transforming my notes into a searchable PDF with just some of the text recognized would be better than nothing.\n\nA: You could use Evernote for this (Free). Just import all of your PDF's as notes and after some time (you can speed this up by upgrading to a paid account), it will automatically process them and recognize the handwriting. You won't be able to extract the OCR text from the notes, but you can search for it.\n\nA: Evernote does have handwriting recognition, but unfortunately right now it requires JPG format. It cannot handle PDFs.  So your work-around may be to consider converting PDF -> JPG using Preview, etc. and then importing into Evernote for recognition.  FYI, the handwriting recognition in Evernote for JPG is decent, but not nearly OCR-level from my experiences.\nAlso, this post describes a good workflow to use Evernote to recognize handwritten notes.\n\nA: If you're fammiliar with any programming language, take a look @ ocrsdk.com, it's a website that lets you upload images through web API and sends you back OCRed data. Here's the documentation on handwriting recognition: http://ocrsdk.com/documentation/quick-start/text-fields/ and here are some codesamples @ github: https://github.com/abbyysdk/ocrsdk.com There's a nice 50 pages free trial without any upfront charges.\n\nA: I realize that you are looking for a Mac OS application, but for the benefit of readers drawn to this topic by the search for handwriting recognition, I'd like to mention MyScript Memo and Notes Plus on iOS. They share a handwriting recognition engine that seems to work very well in my hands. MyScript memo has a free version that anyone with an iOS device can try.\n(I also see that you are looking to recognize handwritten notes scanned from paper, which these apps will not do. They recognize handwritten notes written directly on the iOS device.)\n\nA: Have you checked out Captricity? It's web-based, and they have a mobile app too. They use a combination of computer algorithms and human intelligence, so they do much better with handwriting than any straight OCR software out there. It's pretty fast (on the order of an hour or two for a few dozen or even hundred pages), and while it's not free, there's just a per-page price.\nWhen I tried it, it was free to set up an account (took me about 15 seconds), and I got my first 25 pages free. It looks like they're still giving away the first 25 pages free. I found it really easy to use. I uploaded scans of some forms that were filled in by hand, marked up a template telling Captricity where the data was that I wanted, then uploaded a whole batch of scans. I hear photographs work well too.\nCaptricity gave me back electronic, machine-readable data. Best thing I've found so far for handwriting, and I've looked a lot.\n\nA: http://www.VelOCRaptor.com/ seems to be an affordable (FREE!) solution for OS X. It has a very simple drag-and-drop user interface. It is based on Google's OCR technology so you can rest assured that it will work properly.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Brainware...

So for hard drives such as the WD Passport or Toshiba 1TB, which are made for the PC (running Windows XP/Vista/7), they can be used on the Mac running Mac OS X Lion as well?\n\nA: 2 things:\n1) They are not \"made for\" PCs, they may simply come pre-formatted.  If they are USB, they will almost certainly work with any OS known to man that supports USB\n2) NTFS support is read only, you cannot write (without 3rd party software) but you can format as Fat 32 or EXFAT etc and have the drive be read/write by almost any OS including Windows/Mac/Linux etc/\n\nA: If you want to share the drive across Windows and OSX (so that both can see the same files) then the suggestions about FAT apply.\nAs well as the FAT problems there is loss of precision of timestamps, DST problems.\nIn addition OSX will write a lot of stuff to the drive which is confusing to Windows.\nIf you do not need to share files you are better to format the drive as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) using Disk Manager\n", "Q: Can I wirelessy copy my videos from iPhone to Mac?

If you find any duplicate voice memos, delete the duplicates and then sync.\nIf those steps do not resolve the issue, then follow these steps:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Select the device name in iTunes under Devices.\n  \n*Click the Music tab and deselect the Sync Music option.\n  \n*Click Apply and then click Sync.\n  \n*After the sync is complete, reselect the Sync Music option.\n  \n*Click Apply and then click Sync.\n  \n  \n*Test in a new user account\nIf the steps above do not resolve the issue, attempt to sync with iTunes while logged in as a new admin user. Follow these steps to create a new administrator user:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*From the Start menu, choose Control Panel.\n  \n*Open User Accounts.\n  \n*Select Create a new account and follow the instructions to complete the account setup 4. process.\n  \n*Once the new account is created, choose Log Off from the Start menu.\n  \n*Log in to the newly created user account.\n  \n  \n*Mac OS X\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*From the Apple menu, choose System Preferences.\n  \n*Choose View > Accounts.\n  \n*Click the \"+\" (you may need to authenticate to be able to click this).\n  \n*Give the new user account a name and short name and enter a password.\n  \n*Select the checkbox for \"Allow user to administer this computer\". This makes the user an admin user.\n  \n*Click Create Account.\n  \n*Log out and then log in to the new account.\n  \n  \n  \n  If the error does not occur in the new user account, other content is causing the error. Proceed to the next section.\nIf the error does occur in the new user account, the issue may be caused by content downloaded or created on the device, such as podcasts and voice memos. Removing content from the device may address the issue.\n  \n*Error occurs while syncing other content\nIf the error occurs while syncing content other than music (applications, podcasts, and so on), perform the same steps as above, but deselect the content that stops the sync. Deselect one type of content, then attempt to sync. Continue until you sync without error. Deselect Apps last, since restoring your Apps would take longer than restoring other content.\n\nSource: http://​support.apple.com/kb/TS2830\n", "Q: How to unstyle incorrect (bold and italic) font display in Safari and Firefox?

I went through several rounds of Apple tech support, mostly iPhone people saying it's an iTunes problem and iTunes people saying it's an iPhone problem.  The best solution they could come up with was to stop downloading episodes directly to my phone.  \nI'm hoping someone out there has a better solution.\nEDIT: In order to find out if this problem is specific to my iPhone or Marketplace:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does anyone NOT have this problem with Marketplace?\n\n*Does anyone NOT have this problem with some other podcast? If so, which podcast?\n\n\nA: You say that sometimes you \"forget\" to sync. Are you utilizing Wi-Fi syncing? The sync activates whenever you're on the same network and your device is plugged in. This might reduce the number of instances that you need to download a copy from your iPhone. \nI realize this is a stop gap. I feel your pain. Like you, I've put a lot of effort into understanding why the leading podcast catcher can't seem to make podcasting on the iOS \"just work\". In the end I needed a bit of self inflicted tough-love and just admitted that this was one are that Apple fell short and that they weren't going to remedy anytime soon. They're putting their resources where the revenue streams are. \nMy situation forced me to change my workflow. I've been waiting for the promise an untethered world, and jumped into iCloud full steam. I use iTunes Match for my music, iCloud for my backups and no longer sync to iTunes on my computer. Of course, this means that there is no way to subscribe to podcasts on my iPhone without using a third party app.\nAfter trying several podcast apps, I've come to like both Downcaster and Instacast. I've imported my feeds from my mac, I can subscribe to new ones on the iPhone, and I can sync to my other devices through iCloud. What I can't do is sync back to the mac. But I'm ok with that now. By using a full featured app on the iPhone, I've come to really like the experience. Given the choice today, I'd continue my new habit of listening to podcasts on my phone even while I'm working on my mac. I don't ever need iTunes open and the overall listening experience is much better.\n\nA: I suspect you have somehow added two slightly different feed sources - one on the mac and one on the phone.  Delete all episodes of the podcast from both places and start over with just a single subscription initiated in iTunes on the Mac.\nHere's how I went about testing my idea about feed sources being the issue:\nI just \"subscribed\" to Marketplace by manually downloading the same episode on both my phone and my Mac without having any pre-existing subscription on either.  \nWhen I synced (WiFi?), I did not end up with a duplicate episode. \nThen, to try to break things, I also tried downloading an episode on the phone and syncing it to the Mac once the download completed.  I am not able to reproduce the problem you describe with artwork/title mismatch.\n", "Q: How would Find my iPod work on a locked iPod Touch? In order for an iPod Touch (which has Find My iPod enabled) to let Apple's servers know where it is located (e.g. via Wi-Fi positioning), I believe it needs to transmit the location over Wi-Fi.\nLet's assume that the iPod is locked and someone stole it. From what I understand, the iPod will never connect to an unknown Wi-Fi network. This means, that since the person that stole the iPod cannot unlock it and initiate a connection to a Wi-Fi network, the iPod will never connect to a Wi-Fi network, and therefore will never transmit its location back to the original iPod owner.\nNote: I realize that the iPod can connect to known networks automatically (i.e. those it has previously connected to), but for the purposes of this question, assume that the only Wi-Fi the iPod has connected to was at the original owner's home. And so, the person that stole it will never bring it back in range of this Wi-Fi hotspot, and thus the iPod will never connect to a Wi-Fi hotspot.\nNote that this is less of an issue on an iPhone (or iPad with 3G) since the iPhone has a 3G connection which it could use to transmit its location.\nAre my assumptions correct which lead to the conclusion that Find My iPod/iPhone/iPad is basically useless on any non-3G device? Am I missing something? Is there any way to increase the chances of locating your iPod touch in case it does get stolen? (Preferably one which doesn't involve connecting to a bunch of random networks (i.e. in order to have them be \"known\" networks) in hopes that one day the thief will travel by one with the same name and have it auto-connect to that.)\n\nA: I'm afraid you're completely right. Apple does even make a statement on its website about it: \n\nHowever, there are some alternatives.\nBut since there is no way to come up with a work around on this problem, 3rd party software, like Undercover allows you to store the latest locations of an iDevice. Where Find my iPod touch will only show you the current location (it doesn't show a history of locations I think), Undercover will save its latest location, as they say on their FAQ page:\n\nWhat happens if Undercover is launched when a phone is not connected\n  to the net? Will it still transmit its location?\nIf Undercover is launched on an offline device (no 3G or Wi-Fi), its\n  location is saved. As soon as the device goes online and Undercover is\n  launched again, saved locations will be transmitted.\n\n\nA: It worked for me in my school, someone stoled a friends iPod touch and with my iPhone we located and make it sound very loud, after a few minutes the iPod appeared in the principals office, that was an awesome thing! Another idea is if you turned on share 3G network with the IPod touch it will connect automatically when you are close to it and it will share the position to you! I know this could look like an useless function for the ipod touch but it worked perfectly for me and my friend got back  his iPod! Very nice thing from apple.\n", "Q: What is Application Loader and why does it want to open EPUB? I just clicked on an EPUB file and instead of Stanza it opened with \"Application Loader\", which asked me to accept some terms of service.\nWhat is \"Application Loader\" and can it really be used to display EPUB documents?\n\nA: Application Loader is a developer tool (part of Xcode) that uploads apps to the Mac/iOS App Stores for sale. \nSee this question for instructions on fixing your file type associations.\n\n\n*\n\n*How to Change File Type Associations?\n\nA: According to Wikipedia Stanza is no longer supported: \"According to an email received by a member of the Facebook \"Revive Stanza\" group, Amazon will no longer be updating or supporting Stanza after version 3.2.\"\nI suggest considering Calibre. \"calibre is free and open source e-book computer software that organizes, saves and manages e-books, supporting a variety of formats\"\n\nA: Application Loader is the app used to publish content you've created on the App Store. In addition to actual Apps, this also includes ebooks in EPUB format. It's part of Xcode and no, it can't display EPUB documents, so you may want to tell OS X to always open your EPUB documents with Stanza again (this association likely got overwritten when Xcode was last updated).\n", "Q: Can I determine how the Flashback trojan infected my machine despite disabling Java? Apple's update on April 17, 2012 detected and deactivated the Flashback trojan.\nYet two weeks ago I had following the instructions here. After concluding that my Mac is not infected, I disabled Java.\nI don't understand how Flashback could have sneaked in, especially after my guard has been up after an Arstechnica article, but that no longer matters.\nHow do I find out what kind of damage might have already been done? Will one of the log files contain a trace of what has happened?\n\nA: I'd be surprised if the logs told you anything useful. \nIf you're concerned, you could install one of the free AV products for the Mac. Do a full system scan to ensure that all traces of the trojan have been removed.\n", "Q: Where to find the Mac OS X Lion security configuration guide? Most Mac OS X releases have very nice security configuration guides, but Lion is not in the list. Is this document available somewhere else on Apple's site, or is there a roughly-equivalent document available somewhere on their site under another name?\n\nA: I have it on good authority that the Apple Security Guides take a long time to compile and produce, and publication trails the release of the operating system by some time. The same people working on that guide are also producing documentation for various security certifications and other purposes. Once the guide is released, it will be available at Mac OS X Security Configuration Guides\nWith Apple's recent decision to move to annual OS updates, I wonder if we'll ever see a current security guide again.\nThough overkill for most computer users, the US National Security Agency also publishes hardening guides for Mac OS X and other operating systems. (They haven't published for Lion either, and their own guidelines are very likely an expansion  of the procedures Apple recommends.)\nWhen considering the NSA advice remember that security is always a balance between safety and usability and that most of us aren't protecting secrets of State. If you don't know why you're doing it, and have a good reason to believe you need to do it, don't!  There are relatively few users who need to lock down this tightly, and the negative effect on usability, and in some cases functionality, can outweigh the benefits.\n\nA: Well, I like jaberg’s answer, but time has passed and no security configuration guide was published. So, 14 months after Lion’s release, and now that a new major version of Mac OS X was released, it seems that they don't publish these security configuration guides any more.\n", "Q: Ejecting USB drive via AppleScript does not make drive power down On startup, I eject my external USB disks with the following AppleScript:\ntry\n    do shell script \"diskutil eject \\\"/Volumes/USB Backup\\\"\"\nend try\n\nThis works as expected: the drive powers down. However, when my MacBook wakes from sleep (through not being used), the drive spins up - no partitions are mounted, but the drive is nonetheless on and humming. If I check the Disk Utility app, I see that the USB drives are all greyed out. If I right click one of the partitions and select \"Eject Partition\" (even though they are gray and thus symbolize that they are ejected) then the drive powers down. \nIt is however a little anoying to constantly have to go into Disk Utility, so I made though I could just re-execute my logon script. But that doesn't work.\nEven if I modify it to work with the DeviceIdentifier\ndo shell script \"diskutil unmountDisk disk1\"\n\nor\ndo shell script \"diskutil eject disk1\"\n\nit doesn't work. Does anyone have a tip for me how I can power down the drive, so that this horrible humming stops?\nLater Addition: I noticed something interesting. It has nothing to do with the laptop's sleep mode itself, but rather when my Cinema Display goes to sleep (after 1 min.). The USB drive is connected to the Cinema Display and every time the display \"wakes up\", the drive motor spins up. I have now tried to connect the USB drive to the MacBook Pro itself  (who's sleep timer is at 30 min.) maybe this will solve the problem half-way. \n\nA: For starters, the greyed-out appearance in Disk Utility means the disk is unmounted, not ejected. An ejected disk does not appear at all. \nThe reason it shows up is that when the Cinema Display wakes, the computer sees the drive show up just as if you'd plugged it in. (Honestly, I'm surprised it doesn't mount all the way and show up on the Desktop.)\nOne thing that can help (particularly in the case of your second script) is to use the internal disk identifier instead of the disk name. You can find the identifier by going into Disk Utility, selecting the disk (or partition) in question, and pressing the Info button (or hit ⌘+I). In that window, look at the label next to \"Disk Identifier:\". A disk (whole hard drive) would look like \"disk0\" or \"disk2\", a partition looks like \"disk0s0\", \"disk0s2\", or \"disk2s1\". Instead of using diskutil eject DriveName, use diskutil eject /dev/disk2s0. \n", "Q: Open Terminal.app with directory from a given URL? With the URL <file:///Library/Fonts> (for example in a note in NV) I can open the finder with the given location. Can I do something similar for the terminal? That is, if I write for example (doesn't work, that is the question!) <terminal://Library/Fonts> the Terminal.app should open a new window and cd to that directory.\n\nA: Opening a New Terminal Interactively\nAs of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal has a “New Terminal at Folder” Service you can enable in:\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Services > Files and Folders\nWith this Service you can open a new terminal by selecting a folder or file path in any application and choosing this Service in the contextual menu (Control-Click or Right-Click) or the Services submenu in the application menu.\nIt doesn’t support “file:” URLs, but you can select the path part of the URL “/Library/Fonts” and use the Service with that.\nThere is also a “New Terminal Tab at Folder” Service.\nOpening a New Terminal Programmatically\nIf you need to open it from a command line or shell script, you can use the open command to tell Terminal to open a directory pathname or “file:” URL:\nopen -a Terminal file:///Library/Fonts\n\n(This is equivalent to dragging a folder, file path or “file:” URL onto the Terminal application, which opens a new Terminal at that location.)\n\nA: This works from the command line:\n/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/MacOS/Terminal /Users/ &\n\nWhere /Users/ is the directory you want to set the working directory to.\n\nA: Try the open command:\n\n\n*\n\n*open . opens Finder window for current directory\n\n*open /Library/Fonts opens Finder window for /Library/Fonts\n\n*open http://www.apple.com/\n\n*open ~/Documents/my-big-novel.pages\nRun man open for additional options.\n", "Q: Google Chrome doesn't import Keychain credidentials after update I had installed the new Google Chrome update and after I restarted the browser, it stopped using my Keychain credentials.

I have never used auto sync because I have more data than space on my iPod and I swap songs, movies, photos, and apps back and forth. My new PC now has all my music and photos on it in the Windows folders as well as all the songs in my iTunes library now. I have backed up the iPod through iTunes. I have done the transfer purchases thing, but only 48 of my apps are on my PC and my iPod right now because my old computer died and, as I said, my iPod is small.\nSome of my apps are for scrapbooking and are over 100 MB and have cost a fair bit of money with all the add-ons and in-app purchases I've made. My songs will be ok. My photos will be ok. But what about my apps? I am terrified I won't have access to all my apps after I upgrade. Or maybe I'll only have the 48. I cannot use sync because obviously I am a control freak; I mean, obviously the new PC is an issue and the amount of storage space on the iPod and need to swap is an issue and WAY too confusing and time-consuming to have to use the checkmark method. I have to do it manually.\nI was hoping to put all the songs and apps in the Cloud once I upgraded and purchase the $25 non-iTunes songs storage thingy so I can swap on the go until I go and get a bigger iPod, lol.

Will I have to buy them all over again?\nMy head is very fuzzy, so if this is not making sense, please tell me. I know someone out there knows the answer to this and likes to help techno-duds like me.\n\nA: iCloud can be used to back up your device, but it's not a repository for Apps not in use. However, once you've purchased an app you can redownload it from the iTunes store, free of charge, as long as the app is still available.\nYou will lose the configuration files and any data files that wasn't saved out to an external source.

Drag and drop one file into another to instantly join them\n  together.\n\nNot quite a batch process if you've got lots of files to join, but dragging and dropping audio files to concatenate into its window is straightforward. Fission does have a free trial but won't allow you to save anything without degrading the audio.\n\nAre these files you want to join part of the same audio stream that have been split up? Be aware that if you're joining compressed audio, the transitions between one track and another at the point of the join may not be seamless, as the compression process removes part of the audio which may be audible when joined back together (if they're lossless, then there should be no problem).\nAlternatively, if you want something free, I beleive Audacity will also do this for you.\n\nA: You can use Garageband too.\n\nA: It's a cheap shot, but Audacity will allow you to simply copy/paste your tracks into one file. So, no batch solution like you were looking for, but easy copy/paste.\nYou'll need to download and install the FFmpeg Import/Export Library though. \n\n\nA: I've found that Join Together from Doug's Scripts works very well if you've already imported the files into itunes. http://dougscripts.com/itunes/itinfo/jointogether.php  I've used this to convert audio books ripped from CD's to chaptered m4b but works with m4a as well\n", "Q: Where does terminal look for its commands?

I've been using an iPhone 4 for a while now and have a bunch of apps, each with its own data. I just got an iPod touch and I wanted to have the same apps/data on it as well. The iPhone 4 is synced and backed up to iCloud.\nWhen I set up the iPod, I chose to use iCloud and I tried \"restoring\" from an iCloud backup. After the set up process though, the only apps on the iPod were the default ones. Furthermore, it seems like none of my settings transfered over either.

My new iPad has a scratch that produces a rainbow effect on the screen. I have read that cerium oxide can be used to reduce the appearance of scratches on Gorilla Glass which is similar to the iPad/iPhone 4 glass, but it is hard to find step-by-step instructions on how to use it or any examples that it works.\nDoes anyone have any experience removing scratches using cerium oxide or something else?\n\nA: You might check out the resurfacing compounds from TDI Smart Technologies.  They seem to have come up with their own compound formula for removing scratches from Glass, Acrylic and even Gorilla Glass touch screen panels.  Here's their link...\nTDI Smart Technologies - Glass, Acrylic, and Gorilla Glass Compounds\nAs far as a screen protector, I have always loved the screen protectors from Screenguardz.  Compared to the ones at Best Buy (forget which brand but they are stickier feeling), they are extremely smooth and the anti-glare is great in sunlight or other bright environments.  Here's their link...\nScreenGuardz\nA little late here but I hope this helps someone that comes across this in the future.\n\nA: I fear that any attempt to polish out scratches could damage the touch-sensitivity of the glass. This might render your iPad useless. Remember, the glass is not just a glass. It's also the input device for the iPad, your mouse and keyboard, as it were. \nUsing an abrasive to try to polish out scratches will certainly damage the iPad glass' oleophobic coating, which repels finger-oil.\nYour iPad user manual states\n\nHandle your iPad with care to\n  maintain its appearance. If you are concerned about scratching or\n  abrasion, you can use one of the many cases sold separately. To clean\n  iPad, unplug all cables and turn off iPad (press and hold the\n  Sleep/Wake button, and then slide the onscreen slider). Then use a\n  soft, slightly damp, lint-free cloth. Avoid getting moisture in\n  openings.

Is there a way to get to this address on an iPad?\n\nA: I went into Settings > General > Search Domains and entered our domain name and now I can go to http://hostname/\nIf this is the solution, I guess I need to figure out how to set this setting in DHCP.\n\nA: add your domain in the wifi or network in settings.\nif you click on the wifi that you are connected, you will be able to see the DHCP setting.\nUnder Search Domains, add your internal fully qualified domain name.\n\nA: Try going to http://intranet./ (with a dot at the end of the hostname to make it absolute).\n\nA: The answer that 'supa' gave was right. I checked my dhcp-server settings and added scope option 15 to push the domainname to clients. If the device was connected in the past you have to clear the 'Searchdomains'-setting. Then back to wifi-settings, when recconnected the setting should be ok. If not, completely erase the wificonnection and reconnect.\nIf the device was never connected before it works instantly. \n", "Q: Restoring Time Machine backup do a different user folder location I have a 27\" iMac.

It's open in Preview. For the life of me, I can't figure out how to get the top half of the image to print on one sheet of letter paper, and the second half to print on the second sheet. \nEvery time I try, it prints only on one sheet of paper. If I select Scale=100%, it prints a zoomed in part of the middle of the image on one sheet of paper, ignoring the top and bottom of the image. I tried Googling for an answer but the results are bad due to the generic-icity of the words \"preview, print, mac, pages\" - most of the results I saw were about printing multiple images on one page.\nHow do I print a PNG across multiple pages?\n\nA: Here is how to use Safari to print an image to span multiple pages:\n1) Open the image to be printed in Safari.  If it is a local file, then choose File -> Open File....  Or if you already have the file open in Preview, you can drag the icon of the file from the title bar of the Preview window onto the Safari window or Safari icon in the dock.  Otherwise, load the image from the Internet however you usually would.\n2) Go to File -> Print... and then change the Scale (%) so that the image is the desired size. If you do not see the place to change the Scale, you may need to press the Show Details button. Safari will show you a preview of how the image will appear on each page, so you can see how big the resulting image will be.  For the example, you can get the entire width on a single page, but the image will span 2 pages in length.  \nYou may want to choose borderless printing if your printer supports it.  For instance, for my Canon inkjet, I set the paper size to US Letter (borderless).  However, I was not successful in achieving borderless printing in my one trial; Safari still left white borders around the image that I later had to trim.\n3) Click print. Collect your prize from the printer.  Trim away white space and then combine the different pages using tape, etc.\n\nA: If you paste the pdf or image into Apple's Numbers app you can print it across many pages.\n\nA: For PDFs:\nAt least on Mac OS X, the Adobe Reader application (version 10+) has this feature in its print dialog. There's an option to print as \"poster\", meaning 100% scale across multiple pages.\n\nA: an update to larsar - you can drag the picture into excel. \nand then in print, choose scaling--> fit to 2 pages wide x 1 page tall.\nyou might have to trim off a little bit margins after you print them out.\n\nA: I've never done this but I'm guessing this will get you closer:\nDon't print from Preview where there is no Page Setup menu option, try printing from another application like Pages if you have it (copy/paste  your image into Pages or another application).\nGo to Page Setup in the File menu and under Paper Size make a custom page size of 8\"x20\".\nOnce you've done this you can scale your image (drag a corner) to fit the new page size.\nNow if you put 8.5\" x 11\" paper in your printer and print \"borderless\" I'm not quite sure what will happen but it might work. It might work even if you can't print borderless.\nMany who do fine art printing routinely print wide landscapes with roll paper but I'm guessing you don't have the tools for this.\n\nA: Building on graup's answer, use Preview to export the image to a PDF, and then use Adobe Reader to print out the image in a poster format.\n\nA: There are several programs that are designed for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*PosteRazor: Free. Functional (though ugly). Will cut raster image formats as you have requested. Will not cut PDF's.\n\n*SplitPrint: $6. Powerful, and can be used from the print menu, but I have found it slightly difficult to understand.\n\n*TilePhotos: $1.\n\n*MindCad Tiler: $5. Highly rated by people I know who have used it.\n\n*ImprintStudio: $12.50. \n\n\nI'm sure there are others if you search, but these were the low fruit.\nSome of these only deal with PDF's, but will nonetheless allow you do drag from preview. At worst, you can always print to PDF and then open in these programs.\n\nA: If you want to stick with preview, a quick and dirty way to do it :\n\n\n*\n\n*Open image in Preview\n\n*CMD+a to select all\n\n*Grab selection handle and drag until exactly in the middle of the picture. Dimensions of the selection will be shown while dragging the handle, dimensions of the whole picture can be found with the \"Inspector\" ( CMD+I)\n\n*CMD+C and then CMD+N to create new image from selection\n\n*SHIFT+CMD+I to invert selection, CMD+C and then CMD+N to create new image\n\n*Print your 2 images.\n\n\nOR drag and drop the image into Safari and print it there. Safari will happily span it over several pages for you.\n\nA: For those who recommend using Safari, let me add that Safari does not care if your printer has margins. It will \"cut\" your image apart into the available paper size, but hands that image over to the printer (which probably will knock off the ⅛\"-¼\" it can't print). When you assemble your image, it will look as if you're viewing it through window panes.\nI use Adobe Illustrator and \"Tile Imageable Areas,\" but since that solution is wicked expensive if you don't already have it, Sam Goody's recommendations should suffice.\n\nA: I had an interesting experience with this problem.  The first image I tried worked perfectly- it was very tall - Portrait Mode- and it printed across 2 pages using Safari.  However, when I tried a very wide image- Landscape mode, specifically 17x11, Safari would not allow me to make it preview the print across two pages.  It wouldn't work until I rotated the image in Photoshop so that it was again taller than it was wide.  Then Safari would let me print it across two US Letter pages.\n\nA: Increase the size of the image to 101% and the printer will give you the option. You will have to do some cutting to paste them together.\n", "Q: Turn off Smart Folders display \".savedSearch\" extension in Finder sidebar I held off upgrading my Mac Pro from Snow Leopard to Lion until I had replaced all the important apps that would no longer run. \nSo far it's OK, but one thing has me baffled is that my Smart Searches in the Finder sidebar all display a \".savedSearch\" extension.\nI've gone to Finder prefs and unchecked \"Show all filename extensions\" and I've done a Get Info… on the search themselves and made sure \"Hide extension\" is clicked.\nNeither made a difference.\nThis doesn't happen on my MacBook, just the Mac Pro.\nAny idea how to stop it?\n\nA: You will have to recreate your searches since the option to hide the extension is not present if \"Show all extensions\" is enabled.\nDisable \"Show all extensions\" in Finder preferences (which you have done)\nCreate a new Search in Finder\nCheck the box \"Hide Extension\" in the resulting dialog\n\nSee the original author's explanation here for more information\n\nA: You need to disable \"Show all Extensions\" in Finder preferences like you have already done.  However, current saved searches will still show the extension.  Instead of recreating all of your saved searches all over again, just rename them and the saved search will be updated with a hidden extension.  Then you can go back and rename it again to its previous name.\n", "Q: Reducing Lion OS Footprint by removing unnecessary files/folders I am trying to downsize my iMac 640Gb disk to make it fit onto a 120Gb (113Gb usable) SSD.  The total size of use files is currently approximately 340Gb, of which my home folder accounts for 265Gb (which I intend to not put on the SSD, or at least not all of it).  Very rough calculations suggest that my OS and application files are taking up roughly 75Gb, which puts me approximately 2/3rds full - not bad.\nBut, I would like to reduce this a little further if possible, to ensure that as and when I continue to use the computer (and I have a number of large apps that do not currently have installed including music production apps with a lot of data) I am not worried about running out of space on the boot drive.\nTo this end I already own XSlimmer which I will use periodically to remove PowerPC and language variants from my apps, but I was wondering if there are any areas of the Base OS that I can safely remove to save further space?  I am thinking about things like OS localisation, the location of the included screensavers and wallpapers, the voice files that are used for text-to-speech etc.\nIs there a significant amount of such data that can be easily removed to save a few extra Gb on the boot disk?\n\nA: /var/vm/sleepimage can take up the same amount of disk space as the amount of RAM your Mac has depending on the safe sleep mode.\n~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Safari/Webpage Previews/ is at most about 1GB. If you don't need Top Sites or the cover flow views, you can tell Safari to not save the thumbnails with defaults write com.apple.Safari DebugSnapshotsUpdatePolicy -int 2.\n/private/var/folders/ might contain cache folders for applications that have already been removed or partially downloaded documentation files. You can sort the folders by size with du -sm /private/var/folders/*/*/*/*/ | sort -rn.\nThe installers for audio plugins often copy VST versions to /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST/ or DPM versions to /Library/Application Support/Digidesign/.\nIf you've installed Xcode just to use Homebrew or some shell utilities, you might remove it and install the Command Line Tools for Xcode package instead. \nThe CJK fonts in /Library/Fonts/ take up about 500 MB of disk space. The System library already contains the most common Japanese and Chinese fonts.\n~/Library/Autosave Information/ can contain old unsaved documents that haven't been deleted properly.\n\nA: If you are going to use a SSD as main disk, you can set the hibernatemode to 0 and remove the sleepimagefile, which has the same size as your Ram. This has two advantages: no disk writing on the SSD, and no space lost on the SSD.\nHibernatemode to 0 means that no image of the ram is being made onto the disk when you go into safe sleep.\nYou do this with terminal commands:\nto see the actual hibernatemode:\nsudo pmset -g | grep hibernatemode\nthis returns the actual hibernatemode you are in.\nto set the hibernate mode to 0:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\nand to remove the sleep image:\nsudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage\nThat does it; when a serious update of the OS is made you check if the hibernatemode still is 0 with the above command.\nNote1: in some forums it is suggested to move the sleepimage file to another volume: DO NOT DO THAT: when the volume is not connected it will create crashes.\nNote2: if you add more Ram while you have hibernate mode not 0 this can create a startup problem because the sleep imagefile has the wrong size. To avoid that remove the sleepimage file before adding ram.\n\nA: We get a lot of questions about this topic here. You can search for earlier similar questions and answers.\nBackup first\nMake a full backup of everything, a complete disk image, before you go on a spree to delete resources from your Mac.\nDeleting More Unused Human Language Resources\nMonolingual, which is free, can delete unwanted language support files in the /System/Library/ and /Library/ folders itself, whereas XSlimmer (which I also use) is only set up to delete language support files in the Applications folder.\niPhoto\nYou can \"thin out\" iPhoto by removing its voluminous printing templates, but if you delete them, you won't be able to print anything from iPhoto at all.\nRight-click on iPhoto in /Applications/iPhoto/ and select \"Show Package Contents\". You'll discover several hundreds of megabytes of files in /iPhoto/Contents/Resources/Themes/. You can actually delete these (authentication required) but it will change the behavior of the iPhoto app.\nSpeech synthesis voices\nRemoving system support files from the /System/Library/ folder is dangerous. The only files I know of that you can safely delete are the speech synthesis voices in /System/Library/Speech/Voices/. You should leave one voice in there should you ever need that feature.\nFonts\nYou can save several dozen megabytes by deleting certain Asian fonts if you don't need them. Don't delete system fonts directly in the Finder. Rather, do it through the Apple Font Book application, which will prevent you from deleting the \"reserved\" system fonts that Mac OS X expects to see when it boots up, but permit you to delete \"non-essential\" fonts.\nScreen savers and desktop pictures\nScreen savers are in /System/Library/Screen Savers/.\n/Library/Desktop Pictures/ has a couple of hundreds of megabytes of files you don't need.\nDictionaries\nMac OS X has a Japanese dictionary and thesaurus, several hundred megabytes in size,  in /Library/Dictionaries/. You can safely delete these if you will never need them.\nGarageBand and iDVD files\nIf you do not use GarageBand or the older iLife program iDVD, you can save many tens of gigabytes by deleting their applications but especially their support files in the /Library/ directory.\nWith regard to GarageBand, depending on your installation, several gigabytes of data can be removed from two places:\n/Library/Application Support/GarageBand/\n\n/Library/Audio/Apple Loops/Apple/Apple Loops for GarageBand/\n\nPrinter drivers\nDepending on your installation, you may have several gigabytes of printer drivers for printers that you have never actually used. If you are willing to take the trouble, you can delete everything in /Library/Printers/. The next time you turn on one of your printers and try to print to it, Mac OS X Lion will prompt you to download and install the driver needed for that printer alone.\nUtilities to help you find files to delete\nThere are several utilities to list all the files on your hard drive and sort them by file size in various types of charts and graphs. These include: OmniDiskSweeper, which is free; WhatSize, a commercial app; and DaisyDisk. All these are useful not only for looking at system files but also for examining your Documents and user data. You'll find old files that you don't need and can archive or delete, saving further disk space.\nJust remember\nJust remember that if you do not know what you are doing, you might damage your system and then the only remedy would be to do a complete re-installation of your OS, which would put you right back where you started.\n\nA: Yes - you can clean things up to a point. I disagree with the characterization that Lion and Apps take upwards of 70 GB. Most of my installs of Lion end up under 15 GB before user data is added and that includes 8GB of /private/var/db/sleepimage to store RAM contents when the mac sleeps.\nThe apps take up 980 MB from Lion alone and even with all updates (10.7.3) and iLife installed from the App Store.\nI really like WhatSize for measuring and slimming down existing drives safely by removing localizations (delocalize), un-necessary architectures (lipo suction) and development frameworks (nib'o suction). You will want the version from the web site to clean things since that is removed from the App Store version where needing admin permissions is verboten.\nIt also helps find duplicates of files and identify where your largest folders and files lie so you don't waste time cleaning up hundreds of small files to only save a few MB of disk space.\nSo - my space budget for a clean Lion install on a mac with 8 GB of RAM is:\n\n\n*\n\n*8 GB - sleep image\n\n*1 GB - apps\n\n*6 GB - all the rest of the system\n\n\nWhat is getting you from 15 to 75 GB?\n", "Q: Is this \"Security Info Required\" prompt legitimate?

The whistle is high-pitched, reminiscent of fast wind past a window with a tiny crack in its casing (or very slightly open), and audible from several feet away.\nWhile I know that the power supply is insufficient to power the computer I've connected to and that this is (overall) a Bad Thing To Do, why is the power adapter whistling? What electrical components whistle? Is it liable to explode (because that might be cool)?\n\nA: The MagSafe power adapter, like nearly all power adapters for modern electronic equipment, is a switching (switched-mode) power supply.\nSwitching power supplies achieve their light weight and small size by using smaller, lighter transformers for voltage conversion, which require high-frequency AC input to operate. This high-frequency input is produced by a separate circuit which rapidly switches the low-frequency input on and off (hence “switching”), and in fact does so controlled by feedback from the DC output side in order to achieve a tightly-regulated DC output. This regulation itself is also something that varies over time as the input and the output load change.\nSo, there's lots of varying electrical currents, and therefore varying electric and magnetic fields, inside a switching power supply. These fields exert mechanical forces on the components within the power supply, which may cause them to vibrate and therefore produce sound!\nIn a well-designed power supply, the basic frequencies are chosen to be above the range of human hearing (and the components most subject to vibration may be held down especially firmly). However, for various reasons (waves hands, I don't actually know the details) you may get effects at fractions of those frequencies which you can actually hear.\nIn your particular case, if the power supply is running overloaded (or at the upper limit of its capability), then that might put some subsystem oscillating at the upper end of audibility, producing the sort of noise you're hearing.\nYou can often hear noise from cheap power supplies (e.g. USB chargers) when they are unloaded (nothing connected to the output), and hear it shift out of audible range when you connect something.\n(Disclaimer: I Am Not An Electrical Engineer; this is just bits and pieces I've picked up. These folks would have the whole story; e.g. this answer which is a bit short on detail. But, I hope I've at least somewhat demystified why apparently solid lumps of electronics can make noise. (If anyone sees a factual error or can explain better, please feel free to edit this answer!))\n", "Q: Is it normal to hear the MacBook fans all the time even if they run at 2000rpm? I have an early 2011 15” MBP (2.3GHz i7 8GB) and I’m annoyed about the sound of the fans. I know how a defective fan sounds, but these do no sound abnormal, but what what is abnormal is that I hear them even when computer is almost not used.\n\n\n*\n\n*The fans are running at ~2000rpm and ~64 C.\n\n*I do have a SeeThrou Satin Case which I bought from Apple, so I suppose it should have a major effect\n\n*No signifiant HDD or CPU activity observed with Activity Monitor\n\n*Yes, usually I do keep it on my lap, eventual on bed and have to use a pillow or something else to isolate me from its heat. \n\n\nThis annoys me because I would like to have a quiet work environment and not having to to start music just to hide the FAN noise.\nWhat can I do to solve the noise problem?\n\nA: What you can do is use the laptop on a solid underground. Especially if you use a pillow (which where you laptop completely sink in), the pillow is covering the laptop's ventilation holes. And it's even stated in the user manual: \n\nDo not push objects into the ventilation openings.\n\nThe exhaust is the screen hinge, but the intake is most likely all the other cracks and holes in the case. And if the laptop can't take enough fresh air (since you're covering most of the cracks and holes with your pillow/blanket/lap), the fans have to work very hard to get all the hot air out.\nTry to lift up your Mac as you're sitting on your bed, does that improve the activity of the fans?\nBut no worries, you're laptop won't suffer from the heating. And if it get's too hot, it will shut itself down (to prevent damage), so then you'll know you've gone too far :)\nAnother thing what makes your Mac blow like a turbine is playing flash-files or converting stuff, but I guess you're not doing that since you haven't got any high CPU or HDD activity.\n\nA: If you really really want to use the laptop in bed, try a breakfast tray (the things that are used to serve breakfast in bed); they are flat, so they won't cover any ventilation holes and will protect you from the heat.\nI agree with Michiel, don't use the laptop on your lap especially with pillow that covers the intake holes and exhaust. Also try without the case, I've seen cases like this that cover the ventilation holes, not sure if this is properly designed though.\nAnd to answer your question -- it is not normal to hear the fan when the laptop is at idle or when used lightly. The reason why you hear it, as Michiel already said, is because you are blocking the ventilation holes.\n\nA: if the fan is loud on an older machine it may need to be cleaned or replaced. just have it checked. i did it on my old macbook. now it doesn't make a peep.\n", "Q: What are the physical dimensions of the SSD used in the MacBook Air? I need the dimensions of the \"gum-stick\" SSD (solid-state drive) used in 2011 MacBook Air models, preferably in cm or mm.\n\n\nA: Techrepublic says as part of their tear-down the part number is Samsung MZ-CPA1280/0A2. This part is available on Amazon JP where its dimensions are specified as \"Size : 24.0 × 3.9 × 108.9mm\"\n", "Q: Where is the Thunderbolt Display's microphone located, and what are its specifications? There is a mesh above the camera on top of the display. Is that it?\nI wonder if it's omni-directional or listening towards the front of the display.\nI can't find any information about the location or specifications on apple.com or elsewhere.\n\nA: According to the iFixit teardown (see step 19) the microphone is indeed located above the camera behind the mesh. No word on the specs.\n\nA: The Microphone inside the Apple Monitor is designed to spy on employees who sit around the Monitor. There is software you can \"get\" that will discreetly listen and record unsuspecting employees talking around the monitor. \nWhen the microphone is above the camera, it picks up noises that are within  a 360 degree angle... as opposed to 1 side (180 degrees) if it was located next to the camera.  \nFor Privacy concerns, I placed a THICK piece of TAPE on both the Camera and Microphone of the Apple Monitor.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Apple App Store Currency I am buying the new iPad in US. I am going to be sending this to India for my mom. Now, what do I have to do to ensure that if and she purchases Apps from the App Store, the currency is in the local currency, i.e., INR and not US $. I understand it really does not make a difference other than the fact that the credit/debit card will be making the payment but it would still be useful for me to see the pricing in the local currency. \nIs this based on the Country/ Region that I specify when creating a new Apple Id?\nIs this based on the Country/Region we pick when we setup the iPad for the first time (I cannot remember exactly if we do specify the Country while setting up the iPad or just the language).\n\nA: I believe it is dependant on the Apple ID that you log in with.  The location of this is what decides which store to serve up.  If you log in with an Australian or Polish Apple ID, then you should get the relevant associated stores.\nTo aid in this, don't do any setup that you have to subsequently alter later down the line, so don't install apps on your own ID, then send it over - updates to those Apps will fail unless the same ID is used.\nYou should be able to set it up as an Indian one from the start, even though you are in the US, if you already have the correct ID set up. Furthermore, Apple now allows you to change your country or region from within iTunes on a computer. It may work for some, but do some research to read if this is a rare event or something you can toggle back and forth at will.\n\n\nA: Your mother's iPad will take you through the process of creating an Apple ID, but you can also create one on her behalf at Apple's website. Whatever you specify as the country of her mailing address there will determine the Apple Store she becomes associated with.\nSo the answer to your first question is yes, it is based on the Country/Region you specify when creating a new Apple ID.\nThe answer to your second question is no, it doesn't matter what you set as the regional localization of your iPad itself. You can change the iPad's localization as often as you like, indeed I do this when moving between the UK and the US. The iPad localization determines things like date and telephone number formatting conventions, spelling dictionaries, and so on.\nAs an addendum, you can have multiple Apple ID's on a single device. This is kind of annoying to do, but sometimes it's the only way to get an app. In my case, my main Apple ID is linked to the American store, but my London bicycling maps are only available on the British store. So I maintain two different Apple IDs, and when I update my apps I have to type in both passwords and juggle them a bit. \nYour mother may not want the hassle of doing that, in which case you are well-advised by @stuffe to keep everything on a single ID.\n", "Q: What is the Mac OS 10.7 (Lion) volume encryption standard? I have found countless blogs and tutorials how to encrypt an external drive using Mac's extended journaled encrypted format, but I couldn't find anybody stating the standard behind it. I know that FireVault 2 uses XTS-AES 128 encryption, but is that the same used for the external format or are the hard/flash drives simply assigned with a mounting password? Any link for clarification or simply a statement would be very appreciated.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Terminal (located in /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) and type:\ndisktutil cs list\n\n\n*Then look for the entry of your standard drive, e.g.\nName:                    Macintosh HD\n\n\n*Look further down to find out the encryption type:\nEncryption Type:         AES-XTS\n\nThe latter is what I see when using this command in OS X 10.8.2, so you can assume that AES-XTS stands for the AES-XTS 128-bit encryption used in Mountain Lion. \nI expect Lion to use the same encryption model, but I can't verify it because I have no Mac that's running Lion.

BEFORE running the install, you need to enter CMD within the install utility to \"flag\" the external hard drive as active and bootable. \nI have created a detailed guide here:\nhttp://kevtg-compuproductive.tumblr.com\nIt will work for any Mac, but especially with retina and air users who are having trouble getting other methods to work. The link above is formatted more nicely, but I have pasted the text below. It will work if you follow each step iteratively. \nGuide: create external Windows 7 boot drive for Macbook\nimage\nPerhaps you want or need to install Windows on your Retina Macbook Pro. This is not hard to do, if you don’t mind the Windows partition taking up space on your disk drive -or- if you are willing to deal with the performance degradation from using the virtual machines: Parallels or VMware.\nInstead of installing Windows on a separate partition within an internal storage disk, you can opt to buy an external Thunderbolt solid-state drive on which to place the Windows OS. You could just as easily use an external hard drive (instead of a solid-state drive) if you prefer a lower cost/GB. It just won’t be as fast. \nWhat these look like: \nimage\nThis frees up your internal drive for all your Macintosh computing needs, while also enabling a large external disk on which to place a robust Windows install.\nThis guide is fairly detailed and only requires that you can follow a series of specific steps. If you can tie your shoes and you can read, you can probably run Windows off an external Thunderbolt drive.\nA SUMMARY OF THE STEPS (so you know what you’re getting into)\nIt should go without saying, but make sure you have backed up your entire system before you proceed.\n1) Resize your internal drive partition to make room for windows boot files WITHOUT using Bootcamp. Bootcamp uses a 20GB minimum and we don’t want to lose that much space.\n2) Install Windows on external Thunderbolt drive. \n3) Install Bootcamp Drivers \nTHE GUIDE\n1) Create a FAT formatted partition within your MBP internal disk. I call this “the sliver” because it is so-so tiny.\nyou can use Disk Utility or Terminal to resize your MBP internal drive\nA. to use Disk Utility\nOpen it from Applications»Utilities\nselect the Drive from the top of the hierarchy\nclick the “Partition” tab\nBeneath the “Partition Layout” pane, select your Macintosh HD (or whatever you have labeled you system disk).\nMentally now, subtract 1.0GB from the current size of your internal drive. For example, your drive may read 250.14. In the “size” box, type 249.0 You can actually shrink it by as little as 400MB, but let’s leave a little buffer. This is going to allow you to create a new FAT partition into which Windows will automatically place boot files\nclick “Apply”\nnow, click the new blank area below the main partition. Format it to MS-DOS (FAT)\nThings should look something like this:\nimage\nB. to use Terminal (faster, but less visual)\nopen terminal: Apps»Utilities\nType:\ndiskutil list \nYou need 2 pieces of information from the resulting table:\n1) the size of your main partition and\n2) your internal partition identifier (e.g. disk0s2) Double-check. But if you’re typing in terminal you already know that you should be precise anyway\nnow, execute the resize volume command:\ndiskutil resizeVolume disk0s2 249G MS-DOS FAT 1.1G\nIn place of “disk0s2,” insert the identifier for your internal system disk partition.\nnow you have an internal FAT32 “sliver.” Confirm this with diskutil list \nNow, there is a SECOND step NOT to be missed: tagging this tiny internal partition as “Active” for the Windows install. Luckily, your Windows install USB/DVD comes with the utility. This is detailed in step 4, below.\n2) Create (if you haven’t already) your USB Windows install disk. Go ahead and use Bootcamp utility for this.\nJust make sure, in the first window, you deselect the last option for “create Bootcamp partition and install Windows.” We already did this.\nSo, select “Create Windows 7 or later … ” and “download the latest Windows support…”\nDeselect the last option.\nthis will take a while.\nSometimes, the utility has trouble getting the support software from Apple (fails). This is fine. By the time it reaches this point, it has already created the boot disk. BUT, this means you have to download the Bootcamp drivers manually. You can download them here. Then copy the Bootcamp_version-whatever folder onto the Windows install USB stick. It has been labeled WININSTALL by Bootcamp.\n3) Boot to Windows install. Restart your computer, holding the Opt key at the perfect moment! It can be tricky to time it right. Select to boot from the USB “windows” drive. It is orange.\n image\n4) Mark internal “sliver” as active. After the computer boots to the USB drive, click to select your language. BUT then we need to enter the “Repair utility” to set the small FAT sliver inside the computer to “active.” Don’t worry: you’re not actually performing any repairs. You’re just using the command-line utility that is built-in\nAfter you hit “Repair,” go ahead and skip all the automatic options, so that you can use command-line.\nIn order now…\ndiskpart \nlist disk \nselect disk #  —in place of “#,” your internal disk listed\nlist partition \nselect partition #  —in place of “#,” the sliver FAT partition we created\nactive \nassign letter=a (or whatever. Get crazy. Call it “Z”) \nexit \n5) Restart computer, hold option at the perfect moment. Select the USB Windows disk again (the orange one). Enter Windows install setup. You know, keep hitting “next, next next,” until…\n6) Select a “Custom install,” when presented with the option, so you can select your external Thunderbolt disk to install. Do not install on your internal Mac drive. Do not install on the internal sliver partition.\nGo ahead and format the whole drive using the Format button, after selecting your external Thunderbolt partition. Don’t format any other partitions\nThe format preserves existing partitions, BUT if you want to create others (perhaps to share with you Mac side) later, you can resize your primary NTFS partition within Windows after you install it.\n7) Finish the Windows install. Each time it reboots, you will need to hold down the option key to choose to boot to the new Windows volume you have created during the install. Don’t boot to your USB stick anymore. The Thunderbolt Windows installation appears on the boot option screen as an internal disk, labeled “Windows.” If you miss the timing to initiate the boot menu, don’t worry. Your computer will boot into OSX. Just restart your computer and try, try again.\nimage\n8) Install bootcamp drivers. After the installation completes and you log on for the first time, open your Bootcamp_version-whatever folder you stored in the WININSTALL USB drive you created in step 2. \nDouble-click the setup or autorun Application. \nHit next-next-next\nIf your install did not work, look over the instructions again. Though this process does not require any special skill, it is easy to mess up a step. Don’t panic. You already have a complete backup of all your data right??!\nBoot into Mac OSX, open Terminal, and type:\ndiskutil list \nIf your table does not look like mine, ask yourself, “Why self?”\nThis will not work with a bootleg version of Windows.

You can manually \"port forward\" a single port (80) to a single machine (your Mac), or you can forward everything to a single machine (this is known as putting your machine into the DMZ or De-Militarised Zone) which reduces complexity if you are doing multiple ports at the expense of security (all internet requests will be passed though to your machine, rather than just dropped if they are not specific replies to requests that originated from your machines)\n\n\n\nA: You probably need to configure port forwarding on your router (assuming your setup includes a router) so that external connections on port 80 (HTTP) will be able to reach your computer. The way to do this depends highly on your router's manufacturer; you can probably find instructions on their website.\n", "Q: How do I send an image via Bluetooth from my Mac to my iPhone? I need to connect my Mac to my iPhone and send a picture via Bluetooth. Can someone give me step by step instructions as in how to do this ?\nnote: if there's any other way i could do this, then please share it with me \n\nA: Bluetooth transfer is only available to jailbreakers. If you want to go that route, AirBlue Sharing claims to be able to send/receive files over Bluetooth.\nNon-jailbreak options include the $1.99 app Photosync, which uses Wifi and requires a free desktop app to receive/transfer files to it:\n\nPhotoSync will transform your photo handling forever. It‘s the first\n  app that makes wireless transfer of your photos/videos from or to your\n  computer and other i-Devices - a breeze.\nSupported transfer\n  directions: Device to Computer (Wi-Fi), Computer to Device (Wi-Fi),\n  Device to Device (Wi-Fi & Bluetooth)\n\nOr you could use Dropbox, drop a picture in the Dropbox folder on your desktop then use the iOS client to access the picture and save it to the device if you want.\n\nA: You can't send picture from iPhone to a computer via bluetooth unless the iPhone is jailbroken. You can however use iCloud (via wifi) or iTunes (wifi or USB).  Or you can email it to yourself.\n\nA: Once you have your devices set up and paired, Bluetooth turned on on both, (I keep Bluetooth off on my phone most of the time) click on the Bluetooth symbol at the top of your Macbook, pull down to \"send file\" and choose the file. You'll need to \"accept\" on your phone.\nFrom a real rookie\n\nA: Just get Dropbox for both your iPhone and your PC. It's free and easy to use.\n", "Q: Why do I lose my USB speakers after reconnecting with VMWare Fusion 3 running? Here's my setup:\nI have a set of Altec Lansing FX5051 speakers that I run through the USB port. I also run VMWare Fusion (sometimes in Unity mode, sometimes single window, I don't think it matters) during the day for my work on a MacBook Pro.\nAt the end of the day, I unplug my speakers (and a few other things) and take the laptop home for the night. I leave VMWare running, since there's no performance hit.\nIn the morning, I go back to the office and plug the speakers back in. However, when I attempt to listen to my music or podcasts, the sound comes out of my internal speakers. If I press the ALT key while clicking on my speaker icon, the Altec Lansing speakers are not listed. I should note that the speakers are listed as a connectable USB device from within VMWare.\nSo far the only solution I've found has been to shut down VMWare, unplug the speakers, and then plug them back in. On a couple of occasions I've been able to use VMWare Fusion to attach the speakers to the virtual machine, then detach them, and then it will show up, but this is not consistent. I've also tried using the USB Probe and the device does show up there, just not as a valid sound output option.\nAny idea why this is occurring and how to fix it?\n\nA: When a USB device is hot-plugged while VMware is running, I often see a dialog from the VM instance asking if the device should be attached to the VM or to the host OS. It's quite easy to miss this dialog if you have other applications running or if the VM is in a separate workspace. And until the dialog gets its answer, the device isn't attached to either OS.\nIf you're not seeing this dialog, it's also possible that VMware has already been configured with a default answer for the device in question. For example, it might automatically be attaching the device to the guest OS running in your VM. Note that this is not normally what you'd want with USB speakers, as VMware already emulates a virtual audio output device for use by guest OS's that funnels audio output through the host OS.\nHave a look at your VM settings under \"Virtual Machine > USB & Bluetooth Settings…\" where you should see a dialog similar to the following:\n\nI expect you should see an entry corresponding to your USB speakers. If so, you should be able to configure how they're handled when hot-plugged from there.\n", "Q: Changing Apple ID on iPad to match Apple ID on iPhone My daughter bought a new iPad and gave me her old iPad.  However, her old iPad has her Apple ID associated with it. \nI want to change that ID to the same Apple ID I use on my iPhone. Is that possible?\n\nA: What part of the iPad do you want to add a new Apple ID to? There are several different places to enter an Apple ID.\nMessages\nSettings > Messages > Receive at:\n\nApp Store\nSettings > Store > Apple ID:\n\nAlternatively, you can go to the App Store, click on \"Top Charts\" at the bottom. Scroll to the bottom and you can sign out and enter a new Apple ID.\n\n\niCloud\nGo to Settings > iCloud > Account:\n\n\nA: You don't say which Apple ID you want to change. The iTunes Store, iCloud and Messages all use Apple ID, and they can all be different. But yes, you can change, one, or all, according to your needs. Most of these changes are made in various Settings on the iPad.\n\nA: Since there are two different Apple ID - you are in a situation where you can use both on one device but you cannot merge the two purchases and have only one account with the contents of both.\nHopefully, one account will be full of free purchases and you can just leave it behind. If not - try to make all future purchases on one account and only use the second account to load those past purchases you need.\nThis invokes signing in under the old account on each device. Downloading the apps and songs (authorizing that device for the \"old\" account). Then signing out and in to the new account for the rest of the songs and apps.\nJust use care when asked to update apps - you'll need to remember both passwords when asked for each one needing an update.\n", "Q: How can I change the iTunes U folder on Mac?

For example, when the Subject is something like: \"FAX:12345679\", the rule should take the fax number from the subject and use it to fax the attachment via the fax-modem printer. \nIs this possible? \n\nA: To answer your question, I don't think that there is a way to use AppleScript with the Mac fax function.  I am able to create a script which grabs attachments, but I can't find a way to hook into the fax function, without using a 3rd party faxing app.  Sorry, I thought there was a way.\n", "Q: Automator workflow or AppleScript to close Safari after a period of time I would like to create an Automator workflow (or some similar function) that will close down Safari after a specified period of time. \nFor instance, I simply want to run Pandora in Safari during the night, but have it close out after 30 minutes to 1 hour, as sort of a sleep timer.

Think \"Italy 2009\", \"Wedding\", \"The Children\" and so on.\nI can get part of the way today but some very important steps remain to solve.\n\n\n*\n\n*I import my photos into Lightroom\n\n*I organize and edit them into published collections\n\n*I publish the collection to disk\n\n*I import it into iPhoto and I have very nice event that I can sync with my iOS devices\n\n\nHere is what I can't do after this step\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit an image and re-publish and have iPhoto replace it's version with the new one (if possible really replace it so that metadata like faces and locations remains)\n\n*Delete an image from the collection and have it removed from iPhoto, including all original/master copies. I have my original i Lightroom so unless it's a part of a currently published collection it shouldn't be in iPhoto. At all.\n\n*Have the (temporary) directory removed. I don't need to store this image in more places, Lightroom and iPhoto is enough.\n\n\nSo I guess the question is: can anyone solve any of my 3 problems or improve on the overall workflow?\n\nA: While it is far from an ideal solution, when I want to put the Lightroom-created JPEGs in iPhoto, I've been using the following to solve #1:\n\n\n*\n\n*Publish to a Hard Drive folder from Lightroom, each folder named according to the events I want them to have in iPhoto\n\n*Uncheck the \"Copy Items to the iPhoto Library\" box in iPhoto's Preferences>Advanced menu\n\n*Import the folders to iPhoto\n\n\nThis will import these pictures by reference only; all the photos stay in their existing folder. (I usually re-check the box afterwards, so later pictures from sources other than Lightroom are actually copied). But you can set all the usually iPhoto metadata, reorganize into different events, browse thumbnails, etc. \nIf you modify anything in Lightroom, and republish the changes, those changes will be visible immediately when you open the picture in iPhoto. Note however, that unfortunately iPhoto does not update the thumbnail. And iPhoto uses the thumbnail for the zooming-in animation. So not only when you view it in the event display, but for a moment in the zoom-in animation, you will see the original version. But on the plus side, any metadata changes that you make will be preserved, because iPhoto stores these in the database. Only the image is external. \nAlso, since I don't like having another folder outside of the iPhoto database, I actually have Lightroom publish to a folder that is within the iPhoto database package. iPhoto doesn't delete anything in there that it didn't originally create, as far as I can tell. I have tried to use the \"repair library\" option to see if it can pull in the files (it claims to be able to recover orphans), but no luck there.\nUnfortunately, iPhoto does not check when the files are removed. So it doesn't solve #2. It sort of solves #3, in that there is no additional copy.\nAnyways, like I said, it's a very imperfect solution, but I've found it to work reasonably well for myself, and it's the best that I've come up with. There is a plugin that purports to be a Lightroom Publish Service for iPhoto, but it doesn't work at all (it's basically an export; it doesn't update photos). \nBest of luck!\n\nA: As a Lightroom user I, too, would love to get something like this working. The only thing I have found so far that might possibly keep the two in sync is to work in the opposite direction, as unattractive as that may sound.\nIf you import and organize using iPhoto, you'll have your Events in order. You can then in iPhoto under Perferences | Advanced | Edit Photos: select In application... and navigate to Lightroom.app. Also check the Use RAW when using external editor box. Editing in Lightroom will bring you to the import window which allows you to add tags and all that stuff.\nPersonally, I don't know if this is the workflow I'd choose because I'm used to the way Lightroom organizes things, but I thought I'd share in case it does work for you. Perhaps going this route for just the photos/events you know you'll want to have in iPhoto and your normal workflow for other images.\nI'll continue looking and report back if I find something better.\n\nA: Forget about it, there is just no way to do what you want. There are no solutions for your three problems. These are two different apps that have no mutual understanding and run quite independently of each other. Neither has any understanding of the other's database.\nThe nearest thing to a \"solution\" is to forget about both Lightroom and iPhoto and just use Aperture, which has all the features that you actually want. Though I imagine that you've chosen Lightroom over Aperture for other reasons.\nCouple of comments: You don't need to import to iPhoto to sync with iOS devices. You can sync folders from the Finder.\nUsing Lightroom as an external editor in iPhoto doesn't work as there is no way to get the processed image back from Lightroom without exporting from Lightroom and then importing it as a new image. Even if you hack and overwrite the original image in the iPhoto Library you still won't update the thumbnail.\niPhoto doesn't hide anything, they're just stored in a package and you can set it to store Masters in the Finder just like Lightroom. I wouldn't do it, but it is perfectly possible.\n", "Q: How do I make find fail if -exec fails? When I run this command in the shell (in a non-empty directory):\nfind . -exec invalid_command_here {} \\;\n\nI get this:\nfind: invalid_command_here: No such file or directory\nfind: invalid_command_here: No such file or directory\nfind: invalid_command_here: No such file or directory\n\n(and so on for each file)\nI need find to fail after the first error. Is there any way to get this to work? I can't use xargs, as I have spaces in my path, but I need the script calling this to return an error code.\n\nA: This is a limitation of find. The POSIX standard specifies that the return status of find is 0 unless an error occurred while traversing the directories; the return status of executed commands doesn't enter into it.\nYou can make commands write their status to a file or to a descriptor:\nfind_status_file=$(mktemp findstatus)\n: >\"$find_status_file\"\nfind … -exec sh -c 'trap \"echo \\$?\" EXIT; invalid_command \"$0\"' {} \\;\nif [ -s \"$find_status_file\" ]; then\n  echo 1>&2 \"An error occurred\"\nfi\nrm -f \"$find_status_file\"\n\nAnother method, as you discovered, is to use xargs. The xargs commands always processes all files, but returns the status 1 if any of the commands returns a nonzero status.\nfind … -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 invalid_command\n\nYet another method is to eschew find and use recursive globbing in the shell instead: **/ means any depth of subdirectories. This requires version 4 or above of bash; macOS is stuck at version 3.x so you'd have to install it from a port collection. Use set -e to halt the script on the first command returning a nonzero status.\nshopt -s globstar\nset -e\nfor x in **/*.xml; do invalid_command \"$x\"; done\n\nBeware that in bash 4.0 through 4.2, this works but traverses symbolic links to directories, which is usually not desirable.\nIf you use zsh instead of bash, recursive globbing works out of the box with no gotchas. Zsh is available by default on OSX/macOS. In zsh, you can just write\nset -e\nfor x in **/*.xml; do invalid_command \"$x\"; done\n\n\nA: I can use this instead:\nfind . -name *.xml -print0 | xargs -n 1 -0 invalid_command\n\n\nA: xargs is one option. However, it's actually trivially easy to do this with find as well by using + instead of \\;\n-exec  utility_name  [argument ...]   {} +\n\nFrom the POSIX documentation:\n\nIf the primary expression is punctuated by a plus sign, the primary shall always evaluate as true, and the pathnames for which the primary is evaluated shall be aggregated into sets. The utility utility_name shall be invoked once for each set of aggregated pathnames. Each invocation shall begin after the last pathname in the set is aggregated, and shall be completed before the find utility exits and before the first pathname in the next set (if any) is aggregated for this primary, but it is otherwise unspecified whether the invocation occurs before, during, or after the evaluations of other primaries. If any invocation returns a non-zero value as exit status, the find utility shall return a non-zero exit status. An argument containing only the two characters “{}” shall be replaced by the set of aggregated pathnames, with each pathname passed as a separate argument to the invoked utility in the same order that it was aggregated. The size of any set of two or more pathnames shall be limited such that execution of the utility does not cause the system’s {ARG_MAX} limit to be exceeded. If more than one argument containing only the two characters “{}” is present, the behavior is unspecified.\n\n", "Q: Where does iTunes Match store songs on my iDevice?

I haven't actually tried, but it should be fairly easy to create a simple custom LaTeX template for Multimarkdown (without the Author & Title information and all that) to produce PDF output in the font of your choice.\n", "Q: How to tune the iTunes and App Store to remember the password for a very long time?

How can I create a single \"unified\" view of these three folders that contains a union of all three? Preferably filtered to only those applications that can run in the current OS X version (as in the one currently running).\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You can access the partition folders from /Volumes (as mentioned below).  To create the folder, you can do so by creating an Automator Folder Action such as this one:\n\nCreate a new Automator Folder Action and set the path to the Applications folder of the Volume.  Then, drag the \"Get Folder Contents\" action in, and check \"Repeat for each subfolder found.\" Then, drag in a \"Copy Finder Items\" action, and modify the path to your choosing.  Check \"Replace existing files\" so that if you have duplicate applications in each of your /Applications folder you won't get an error. NOTE: this will override any application data.\n\nI created this one, but all you  should have to do is to clone it three times (for each of the partition folders) and then modify the paths.  You can also change whether the apps should overwrite other apps.  I hope that this answers the question better than my other answer!  I'll see if I can come up with some better solutions.  Also, I don't think that you will be able to filter the apps based on the OS X version.\n", "Q: Style text in Numbers formula I have a numbers formula used in invoice generation:\n=\"Invoice terms: \"&CONCATENATE(Terms)&\", please pay by ...\"\n\nWhich returns:\n\nInvoice terms: 14 days, please pay by ...\n\nIs there a way to apply a style to only part of the formula? I want the outputted \"Invoice terms\" to be bolded:\n\nInvoice terms: 14 days, please pay by ...\n\nIs this possible?\n\nA: Although one cannot style individual characters in a formula, one feature of Apple Numbers is the canvas.  One can take advantage of this by adding tables and text objects anywhere.\n\nThe above screen shot uses a static (as the OP's \"Invoice terms\" text is hard coded in their formula example, it is assumed static) text field placed next to the table (a single cell table with no border, in this case) containing the cell with the formula.\nThe OP's use of the CONCATENATE function is unneeded as the ampersands do the same job.  To use CONCATENATE in this case:\n=CONCATENATE(Terms,\", please pay by...\")\n\nWhere Terms is the reference to the cell containing the Terms text.\nDetailed screenshot:\n\nBy using a number for the days, this can be used in a calculation against the Invoice date to determine the date payment is due.

If you get a window like this one \n\n\n\nwith the Self-Assigned IP beside a yellow button, then you were not able to get a local address from the Wi-Fi router's DHCP server. This can happen because the base station is using MAC address restrictions rather than real passwords. This can also happen because the base station has exhausted its available set of local IP address leases.  \nWhen you connect to a network using DHCP, a network router (e.g. the Wi-Fi access point) gives you an IP address to use and promises you can use it for some period of time, which is called a \"lease\". (This is so there is no confusion about when someone else can start using the IP address that you are using.  You either renew the lease or know you have to stop using that address and get a new one.)  Once the server leases you the IP address, it cannot give it to anyone else until your lease expires.  A typical home router might be set up with only 250 addresses to give out and a lease period of 24 hours.   That's fine at home, but in a heavily trafficked coffee shop, they might get more than 250 Wi-Fi using customers in a day, at which point they would be out of addresses.  Worse, lease times can be much longer (I've seen 14 days on some routers) and DHCP servers can have arbitrarily small numbers of addresses to hand out.  So this really happens sometimes, and it is probably what is happening to you.  \nIn any case, it's probably a configuration error on the router that the router owner has to fix. \n\nA: In system preferences make sure your Network preferences are set to the Apple default (should be 'Automatic') and for the WiFi device confirm under the 'Advanced...' settings that under 'TCP/IP' your 'Configure IPv4' is 'Using DHCP'\n\nA: I got it fixed today from www.leshdigital.com\nThe thing is: Sometimes your Mac is a self-assigned IP address that is different from your local IP address(Mine is 192.168.1.1 and the self-assigned IP address is different from that) So what we should do is:\nWe go to network preferences and ADVANCED-->TCP/IP-->configure IPv4(manually)\nIPv4 Address: 192.168.1.19(My local IP is 192.168.1.1 so I changed 1 to 19)\nSubnet Mask is a default value: 255.255.0.0 and this is important:ROUTER->your local IP, mine is: 192.168.1.1\nHit Ok and then you're done.\nEnjoy your wifi which is successfully set up.\n\nA: In my case,  the problem is solved by changing the mac address.

In this screen capture, 169.254.169.243 is such an APIPA.\nThis address doesn't permit to access your router, and of course not the Internet which is beyond your router.\nIn such a case, the only thing to do is to open the Advanced… down-right sub-menu, select the TCP/IP options, and there ask to renew your DHCP obtained address:\n\nA few seconds later ( typically 6 s ), you will get either a new DHCP valid IP address ( in this case 10.0.2.29 ) from your router and everything will be OK from there,\nor again an APIPA ( starting with 169.254 ).\nIn this last failure case, you will know for sure that your router failed to attribute you a valid IP address. It is up to the administrator of this router to tune correctly the DHCP parameters.\nYou can't do anything here to improve the situation from your Mac side. No need to change anything or reboot your Mac, this will be a total waste of time.\nThe Apple Wireless Diagnostics… can't diagnose this\ncorrectly since it can't access the router DHCP configuration.\n\nA: I guess it's a corrupt plist.

There are multiple free options available, such as BitBucket.  You should never have put yourself in this situation.\nAs the www content in PhoneGap applications is interpreted at run time, you should be able to recover it from a device by syncing it to iTunes, then dragging the application out of iTunes as an ipa file.  The ipa file is just a zip file following some particular conventions, so rename it to .zip and decompress it to get the files in the application bundle.\nAnd finally, because it's so important: Use version control and push to a remote server at regular intervals.

I knew that the SuperDrive used to use this speed, but accepted that it was because is was simply an optical drive that could not push the speeds to saturate a SATA1 controller, so why bother with anything better.\nHowever I expected the SSD to link at the SATA2 speeds that the bus supports.\n\nI have the latest firmware on the drive itself, and on my Mac, I have reset my PRAM, and I don't know what to do next.  Why does the SSD not connect at SATA2?\nI accept that I cannot get SATA3 like the drive supports, but some initial testing using a disk speed test tool suggests I am only getting just over 100Mb/s write and 145Mb/s read, which is a mere 20-80% more than the regular drive gets.\nI cannot just swap the drives over, as it's not like the MacBook Pros that use 2.5\" drives.  I have done a lot of Googling that suggested a firmware fix for MacBook Pros solved the same issue on those machines, but no luck for my iMac.\nI have just put a normal SATA2 drive into the optical caddy, and it comes up at 3Gb (SATA2) just fine.  So it seems it's something about the SSD that it doesn't like.  Controller?  I wouldn't have thought that it cared what was connected, so long as it was SATA?\n\nA: Looks like a known problem with the SSD. OCZ has a firmware on their forum that will fix the issue. See the post \"Changing SATA speed on your \"3\" series SSD.\" in this thread.\n\nThis portion of the instructions only applies to OCZ \"3\" series SSD's - Vertex3, Agility3, and Solid3 - all sizes.\n  Some SATAII motherboards, when used with one of the above drives will\n  downgrade the drive to SATA1 speeds. We find this mostly on Nvidia\n  chipset motherboards for PC and Nvidia chipset based Mac's. To resolve\n  this, we have a tool that will set the link speed to be locked at\n  SATAII and improve performance. This can be reversed when you update\n  your motherboard/system so you can have the full SATAIII speed again.\n\nInstalling the firmware involves burning a Linux LiveCD so I hope you have a computer with the optical drive still in.\n\nA: Sandforce drives have had many issues with Macs and should be avoided with Apple hardware.

Once I plug it back in and start it up it immediately shows up at 19%. Is this a battery or software issue?\n\nA: Might be a battery calibration aka battery hardware to software communication issue where the iPhone's thinks there is more power than the battery can provide. When was the last time (before the iPhone started to just shut down at 19% battery) that you did a battery calibration as recommended by Apple.\n\nUse iPhone Regularly\nFor proper maintenance of a lithium-based battery, it’s important to keep the electrons in it moving occasionally. Be sure to go through at least one charge cycle per month (charging the battery to 100% and then completely running it down).\n\nIf you don't then what you are describing above may happen where the phone just shuts down with a random non 0% battery percentage left. If the problem still persists after doing a couple of battery calibrations then it may be that the battery or other hardware is failing, and that the iPhone should be taken to a Authorized Services provider / Apple for more attention.\n\nA: That is a typical failure mode for a battery where the voltage level drops faster than expected and the device enters sleep mode or shuts off entirely.\nOf course, it could be a calibration issue, but if this happens even after a few full charge / discharge to the point where the device shuts off, I would seek service for the battery.\nOn macs, there is a pmset -g batt tool to log the charge level periodically so you can leave the device alone and detect / document this to confirm that you have a voltage drop at a specific point in the charge capacity.\nImagine the opposite. Say you have a water tower and there is a hole in the side at the 75% full mark. You won't detect that hole when filling it up between 0 and 74% - but if you graphed the rate at which water is being added and the rise of the level, you could detect holes by seeing a change in the curve. The analogy is a bit strained since the chemistry of electron storage is a bit more complicated than a water tower, but hopefully it helps illuminate the idea that you can have an issue at a specific point in the discharge cycle.\nI don't have a jailbroken phone to test if the pmset command is part of iOS, but you can also look for LowBattery log entries on your iPhone or synced from iTunes to your computer to see if the run times are getting shorter over time. \n", "Q: How do I script Powerpoint to save a directory of PPTX files as PDFs?

"Q: Deleting emails on iPhone creates new folder \"Deleted Messages\" in Mac Mail When I delete an email in Mail on my iPhone, it creates a new folder in Mail on my Mac called \"Deleted Messages\". Why is it doing this and not putting them in the Trash? I am using iCloud mail on both devices.\n\nA: You can tell iOS which folder it should use for your deleted messages. Open up the Settings app and follow this path:\nMail, Contacts, Calendars < YOURACCOUNT (iCloud) < Account < Advanced (Mail) < Advanced\n\nThere you'll see Mailbox Behaviors options to tell iOS which folders to use for Drafts, Sent, and Deleted messages.\nIn your case, tap Deleted Mailbox and navigation your mail account's hierarchy to find your existing Trash folder. Select that and everything should work as you expect.\n\nA: For syncing with iCloud you need to choose folder \"Deleted Messages\" on your iPhone to be default for the Deleted Mailbox. Otherwise it will create a new Folder on the server called TRASH and the emails you delete on your iPhone will in mail on your computer only be seen in this folder and not in the general Trash.\n", "Q: securityd goes nuts every 4 minutes & 30 seconds securityd spams my console with the following : \n19/04/2012 16:23:17.405 com.apple.securityd: Value of bTransmit: 00000001\n\nrepeated 563 times (after disabling the default mps_limit of 500).\n4 minutes and 30 seconds later (give or take a couple of seconds), it does it all over again.  Oddly, the message is split over that boundary : \n04/05/2012 09:32:16.092 com.apple.securityd: Value of bTransmit: 00000001\n04/05/2012 09:32:16.092 com.apple.securityd: Value of bTransmit: 00000001\n04/05/2012 09:32:16.092 com.apple.securityd: Value \n04/05/2012 09:36:19.470 com.apple.securityd: of bTransmit: 00000001\n04/05/2012 09:36:19.470 com.apple.securityd: Value of bTransmit: 00000001\n04/05/2012 09:36:19.470 com.apple.securityd: Value of bTransmit: 00000001\n\nIt's pretty annoying.  Anyone know what causes it, or what bTransmit might be?  There seems to be no mention of it on Google.\n\nA: You are facing a continuous flow of information messages.\nThis flow is truncated by chunck of 500, which is the default value of\nmps_limit in /etc/asl.conf. This means that your flow of security related messages is at a rate > 500 / s. This is huge.\nCould you open:\n/var/log/secure.log\n/var/log/kernel.log\n\nand check which message could be related with this continuous\nflow of information messages?\nCould you type the following command (in an xterm or Terminal window):\ntop -o msgsent\n\nto check if the culprit could be a local process and tracked down through its huge level of messages sent? You will have to enlarge\nyour window to more than 152 characters large to see the film.\n\nA: Are you using a smartcard reader or some other kind of security related hardware?  Seems like this is an error in a kernel extension or driver for some piece of security hardware. \n", "Q: Horizontal line appears in fullscreen mode I have an issue when entering fullscreen mode in any application on my MacBook Pro with OS X 10.7.3, a white horizontal line always appears at the top of the screen (as shown in the picture).\nWhat is causing that?

How can he change to his ID when the iPad gets here? He will want to set up his own since we do not share the same taste in music and movies.\n\nA: Apple doesn't pre-load anything onto an iPad that is ordered, so you can just hand him the box. He will be asked if he wants to register it and also guided through using his existing Apple ID if he has one.\nIf for some reason you opened it to \"make sure everything works\", just go to the settings app. reset -> erase all content and settings and he will get to go through all the setup steps and enter his credentials.\nYou could go one by one and remove the things you added, but this is the easiest way to get that out of the box experience. You could build suspense by having him go to http://appleid.apple.com and make an Apple ID so he is ready to go when the surprise arrives.\nHave fun and let him know we're here with answers to iPad questions, too.\n", "Q: OSX Lion 10.7.3 update has broken Safari This happened right after I have upgraded to 10.7.3 via Software Update utility.

(My reputation is not high enough to post images)\nDoes anybody knows how this can be fixed?\nJust to be clear, nothing is listening on localhost:8000\n\nA: Update to Safari 6.0 has fixed the problem.\n", "Q: How can I archive articles I'm reading on my iPad? (Evernote, Instapaper, etc) I read a number of magazines and newspapers daily on my iPad, using a number of different apps. I generally start out in Flipboard, then read the New York Times using the dedicated app in Newsstand, then often read bits from The Week UK, again using their Newsstand app. I usually end up in Safari, reading something further on a regular website.\nI'd like to archive some of the articles that I read, and ideally I'd like a single mechanism that works in all of these apps. My strategy at the moment is to use the ubiquitous \"Email\" button in almost any iPad app to send article links to Evernote by means of the Evernote email service.\nThat causes a link to the article to be archived into my Evernote database, sometimes together with a little blurb about the article.\nWhat I'd most like, though, is for the full text of the article, ideally even with a nice layout, to be archived into Evernote. As a PDF would be a huge bonus.\nI'm aware that I can go through various mechanisms of opening up the links on my desktop computer, then printing the articles as PDFs and having them added back to Evernote. I'm also aware that this could be a quick process, if I utilize folder actions or a \"PDF to Evernote\" service. But ideally, I'd like this whole process to be a single step from my iPad itself. I don't relish the idea of going back to my desktop for constant administration of this system.\nI should mention that I'm not a regular Instapaper user, though I know it's a well-loved service. Instapaper seems designed for \"time shifting\" reading, which isn't something I do. I'm more interested in archiving and referencing. I use Evernote because I like that it is agnostic to the kind of information I put in (I can combine text snippets, images, and whole PDFs), I like that the database is on my computer and not solely in the cloud, and I like its search functions.\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to email article links to some service which will convert those links into full PDFs, then email them on to Evernote?\n\n*Is there a better way to keep articles and snippets than Evernote, one which I can send things into by email?\n\n*Is there a wholly different way of doing this that may be more efficient and avoid the problems of emailing links instead of PDFs?\n\n\n\nEDIT:\nThanks to the suggestions I've gotten here, I've tried exploring more options. I'm still stuck, and perhaps someone here can help move me forward.\nThe critical piece was discovering a website called \"If This, Then That,\", which acts as a glue between other websites. I've set up an action on IFTTT to monitor my Instapaper RSS feed for a new article, then to automatically add that article to Evernote. Since Instapaper also provides an email address for adding items to the reading list, this should allow me to simply email to Instapaper, and have everything automatically download in Evernote.\nUnfortunately the Instapaper RSS feed doesn't seem to pick up updates to my Instapaper reading list. Furthermore, links sent from the New York Times are not translated into the full articles by Instapaper, they're just kept as links. So close and yet so far!\nI've been experimenting with Pocket and Readability for the same problem. So far nothing works. But I feel I'm on the right track with IFTTT.\n\nA: I find the Send to Instapaper button to be perfect for archiving because it's so ubiquitous. The glue that gets your articles from there to Evernote is IFTTT.\nJust create a rule that says anything you save to Instapaper gets imported to Evernote and you're set. I believe you can automatically have it add a tag at the same time.\n\nA: You might check out pinboard.in.  The have an inexpensive \"pro\" account that gives you a permanent archive.  I've never used it but Jon Gruber was raving about it the other day.\n\nA: If you're on a Mac then you should have a 'Send PDF to Evernote' option in your Print dialog.\nOn the other hand if you're willing to look at Instapaper combined with Evernote as a solution, then the following link should show you how you can have Instapaper on the iPad automatically post an article to Evernote just by you Liking it on the Instapaper app without going to the Instapaper website: http://www.techguzzle.com/living-in-harmony-flipboard-instapaper-and-evernote\nThe New York Times is a problem for almost all solutions because of their paywall unfortunately.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Zite on iPad has an option to send to Evernote. It allows you to to choose the folder to store the item in.\n", "Q: How to clean up partitions after OS X is moved from HD to SSD Yesterday an Apple Certified Macintosh Technician installed an SSD into my iMac medio 2011. The iMac was born with an 1TB HDD but now a Crucial M4 SSD is also installed inside the mac. I've moved my OS X to the SSD using the OS X Recovery, where the OS was installed using an Time Capsule Backup. Afterwards I did an Erase of the old HDD in Disk Utility to remove my old OS and my data has now been transferred to new, clean partition. Afterwards I inserted my Lion DVD and did an reinstall of the OS X to get the OS X Recovery partition created on my SSD. The name of the partition on the SSD is Crucial M4 SSD and the name of partition on my old 1TB HDD is Storage.\nPlease see this output from diskutil list:\niMac:~ dennis$ diskutil list/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *256.1 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Crucial M4 SSD          255.2 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk1\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         999.9 GB   disk1s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk1s3\n/dev/disk3\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS Storage                *999.7 GB   disk3\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Why do I have an Apple_Boot on disk1 after the entire disk was erased?\n\n*What is the EFI and Apple_Boot?\n\n*Is it normal that the type of the Recovery HD is Apple_Boot?\n\n\nA: \nWhy do I have an Apple_Boot on disk1 after the entire disk was erased?\n\nI am not sure on this one. Seeing the size (134 MB) I don' this this is the actual boot partition itself.\n-\n\nWhat is the EFI and Apple_Boot?\n\nEFI is the Extensible Firmware Interface system partition. This is a special partition that holds boot loaders for all the OSes installed, in other partitions:\n\nThe EFI System partition is a partition on a data storage device that\n  is used by machines that adhere to the Extensible Firmware Interface.\n  It contains the boot loader programs for all operating systems\n  installed (in other partitions) on the device, device driver files\n  (used by the firmware at boot time) for other devices, and system\n  utility programs that are intended to be run before an operating\n  system is booted.1\n\n-\n\nIs it normal that the type of the Recovery HD is Apple_Boot?*  \n\nYes.

I have a 2011 unibody MacBook Pro, and have been gathering kludge on it for some time, and on previous machines (2007 MacBook Pro, 2004 Powerbook) whose data I've migrated over using the Migration Assitant. I'd like to, at some point soon, do a fresh install of Lion, grab my data from backup (or a disk image clone), and reinstall my applications (only the ones I'm currently using, with no detritus from other apps I've installed, used, and since uninstalled).\nHowever, I use a Time Capsule (1 TB) for backups, and wanted to know two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible, after doing the install, to have the previous history of my computer (on the Time Capsule) integrated with my current and future Time Machine backups? (I.e., the Time Capsule sees the new, clean machine as the same machine, and allows me to step into my file history and grab stuff, if need be.)\n\n*If the answer to the above question is yes, how would I do this?\n\n\nApologies in advance if this question has been answered elsewhere. A cursory perusal of the Q&A here didn't turn up anything; but I know there's the chance I could have missed something.\n\nA: I think you'd be better off doing a clean install and using Setup Assistant to copy over just the users and settings.  (Setup Assistant, like Migration Assistant, can use a Time Machine backup as the source.  The are basically the same application, but Setup Assistant configures your Mac for the first time and Migration Assistant helps you copy stuff over to a Mac you've already set up.  You can only use Setup Assistant immediately after a clean install of the OS, which of course includes the first time you boot up a new Mac.)  That way for sure your new users will have the same UID and UUID as your current users, meaning your backup and all your other drives ownership and read/write permissions will still work as before, and there's a chance that the Time Machine interface will work to fetch old files.  I wouldn't bet on the latter, but I've had permissions problems before when not migrating users.  Of course, this might be different if all your machines only have one user; my machines have 3. \nI'm pretty sure, also, that if Time Machine doesn't work straight off the bat, you can trick it into working by replacing the com.apple.TimeMachine.MachineID.plist file in the  Time Capsule's sparsebundle disk image for the backup for the machine in question.  But that's a bit advanced and certainly unsupported, so I'd leave that for \"when all else fails\".\n", "Q: Using all trackpad gestures via Apple Remote Desktop How is possible send all trackpad gestures via Apple Remote Desktop.app (ARD)?\nSome working, some not, especially don't works gestures:\n\n\n*\n\n*mission control (4 fingers up)\n\n*exposee (4 fingers down)\n\n*swiping left-right with 4 fingers - switching screens..\n\n\nThese gestures interpreted in my local machine, when i'm in windowed mode of ARD, and does nothing when i'm in fullscreen mode.\nIs here any way use all gestures for example in full screen mode?\n\nA: You can use BetterTouchTool to recognize all gestures and than send a keystroke to Remote Desktop which in turn will invoke the desired functionality on the remote machine.\nBetterTouchTool can configure actions for gestures based on the current active application. This way you are able, for example, to map \"three finger left\" to the shortcut for \"history back\" which you can configure as the action of \"three finger left swipe\" for Remote Desktop.\n\nA: I just had this problem and here's how I fixed it: I went into System Preferences>>Trackpad then unclicked \"Swipe Between Full Screen Apps\", clicked \"Swipe Between Pages\", swiped a few times, then went back to Trackpad and reversed them (i.e. -- unclicked \"Swipe Between Pages\" and clicked \"Swipe Between Full Screen Apps\"). I don't know if all those steps were necessary, but it worked.\n\nA: Make sure your client computer is set up to recognize those gestures.   I would not expect them to be passed in windowed mode, but in full screen mode they should work if they are enabled on the client.  My guess is that they simply are not enabled on the client machine. \n", "Q: How to change the creation (st_birthtime) date/time of a file in Lion? touch(1) can only change modification and access times, but has no options for creation time. This does not work, at least not on Lion.\nSo how do I change the creation time, also referred to as birthtime in fstat(2)? There's no corresponding call in utimes(2) and there doesn't seem to be any command line tool for this.\nI know I can copy the file to a new file, which then gets the current time as birthtime (and then delete the original), but surely there must be a better way?\n\nA: touch -t also changes the creation time if the target modification time is before the original creation time.\nSetFile can set the creation time to be before the modification time or in the future.\n-d date    Sets the creation date, where date is a string of the\n           form: \"mm/dd/[yy]yy [hh:mm:[:ss] [AM | PM]]\" Notes:\n           Enclose the string in quotation marks if it contains spa-\n           ces.

I should be able to read-write data using each machine/OS.\nMoreover, I need to store and move files larger than 4GB.\nSo, what should be preferred file-system type: FAT, exFAT or NTFS? Will my portable drive support exFAT?\n\nA: The only format that support all of your requirements is ExFAT. It is natively supported by Win7, Lion and Snow Leopard (from 10.6.5, I believe).\n\nA: I would actually recommend a 4th option - HFS+. I'm using Paragon HFS+ for Windows and its working very well. For $20 I am very happy with it and it definitely had advantages on the Mac side that you will not get with exFAT (TimeMachine, resizability, larger file sizes).\n\nA: I'd like to point out that exFAT is orders of magnitude slower on the mac than HFS+ or FAT32, especially when used on a spinning hard disk.  It works well on solid state (ssd's or flash).\n\nA: FAT\nFat is definitely off the table since it only supports files up to 4GB. So you won't be able to transfer files over 4GB like you stated in your question.\nexFAT\nexFAT won't have this limit since it's capable of supporting files up to 16 exabytes (16.000.000 terabytes). It's an excellent format for your flash drives and/or external (not internal!) hard drives.\nNFTS\nNFTS is an alternative, but your Mac (starting from 10.3) can only read it. It won't be able to write data on the drive, unless you use some extra software and hacks,\nbut some users have reported some instability and performance issues using NFTS on a Mac.\nWindows/Mac\nWindows 7 will read and write FAT, exFAT and NFTS without any problem. (It can even ReadyBoost from an exFat flash drive). Starting from Mac OS X 10.6.5, the OS supports reading from and writing to exFAT formatted drives.\nConslusion\nI would go for the exFAT. It's fast, supports huge datafiles and both your Windows 7 and your Mac will be able to read/write to it.\n", "Q: Bind  in Vim Is it possible to map  to save in vim in a standard terminal?

(the best way to use Ukelele is to duplicate your existing Turkish keyboard layout file and modify just the single key in question). \nAs a fast solution, and if you don't mind changing other keys on the keyboard, you could use the International pane to switch to a US keyboard layout. \n", "Q: iPhone 4S having audio issues - Other side hears his echo during call My uncle bought a brand new iPhone 4S last week and it is suffering from an annoying problem, side b (not him) hears himself with echo. The error does not occur while\nusing headset or speakerphone, only when using handset.\nIs there a fix for that problem?\niPhone 4S\nVersion 5.1\n\n\nA: I had this exact problem with a 4S until today. Here is what I did:\nI installed Skype and Google Hangouts on the 4S to check whether this problem occurs with any calling application or just GSM. I made calls with Skype and Hangouts via WiFi and had no problem at all.\nSo I had a friend with a 4S with no such problems and I borrowed his SIM card for a test. I called his number on my 4S and had no echo problems! I put mine back and the echo returned. To make sure, I repeated this a couple of times. My SIM had echo, his no echo.\nSo I went to my provider's shop and requested a new SIM. Problem gone.\nI hope this helps people who have tried all else with no results.  Why the SIM caused this is beyond me.\n\nA: A lot of user complained about this problem. It's been a 37 page long discussion on the Discussion Forum of Apple. \nI suggest he goes to the Apple Store, explains his problem and hope they come with a solution. \nMeanwhile, he can try a simple fix which seems to solve the problem. You can try to press the speakerphone button on and off again when the echo happens.\n\nA: My problem is solved. I had the same problem described here but it was solved by removing just one recording app I had installed and did not know it is causing this echo problme for a few weeks. To exclude all the problems regarding your downloaded apps you should back up your phone and without restoring reset your iphone to a new iphone. Again do not do a restore. Then try calling someone. You problem might have been resolved.   \n\nA: I had similar issue, fixed it by replacing the charging/data connection port.\nYou can test by simply disconnecting the ribbon and then making a call.\n\nA: I had an echo on my iphone 4s and all I had to do is put some scotch tape (or similar) to the little hole beside the headphone socket, job done, no echo!\n\nA: Echo on cellular phones is typically one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*A multi path issue where the signal from the cell tower to the phone is bouncing off several surfaces and the phone can't tell which stream is the best so you hear both. Installing software updates (update your iOS) or moving the phone to a different location will solve this cause.\n\n*If the person you are calling is on speaker phone, you will often hear an echo when you speak - so mute your phone and see if the echo goes away. If so, ask the person you're calling to lower their speaker volume or take their device off speaker phone mode.\n\n*Sometimes the echo is just bad cellular service or firmware on the carrier side. You would need to contact your cellular service provider to fix that sort of issue.\n\n*In rare cases, you could have a hardware problem. If the hardware is broken, you could have an internal crack where the sound comes from the receiver and gets picked up by the microphone. You would always have an echo no matter who you called and before / after updating the software. In that case, have your phone diagnosed by a technician or Apple support.\n", "Q: Is there any good iPhone stand with high-quality microphone for my desk? I use my iPhone 4 to go jogging and at some point the built-in mic has gotten damaged and the only way to talk to people is via an earbud with mic.\nI am looking for a desk charger which also has a high-quality mic so that I can take calls from my desk, hands-free. Does anyone know of a suitable product?\n\nA: There is no product that provides a stand and charger with a mic, but there are several external mics you can clip onto the iPhone. Some (lower quality) use the headphone jack, and some (higher quality) use the 30-pin docking port.\nHere are two examples:\nIK Multimedia iRig Mic Cast\nThis mic uses the headphone jack.\n\nTascam iM2W stereo mic\nThis mic uses the docking port, but has a pass-through USB connection that permits charging while the mic is in use.\n\n\nA: I'd recommend using Apple's own dock. There's an audio plug which will allow you to plug in any microphone you like, either directly (if it's iPhone compatible) or with a breakout cable.\nThen you can connect any non-USB microphone you like.\n", "Q: A Mac OS X VPN client that can import a .VPN file I have a .vpn file that I use on Windows with the Shrew Soft VPN Client that has the connection details (excluding the username and password).

I'm using the Messages Beta on Lion to receive iMessages on my MacBook Pro. I also have my iPhone set up with my iMessage account.\nWhen I receive a message, it's delivered on both devices. If I read the message on my computer, it disappears from the lock screen of my iPhone, so it doesn't fill up during a conversation.\nBut, this doesn't prevent my iPhone from vibrating every time I receive a message — and if I'm having an extended rapid-fire iMessage conversation with someone using my computer, this can get annoying.

Developers should make sure that they don't exclude items from backup that cannot be recreated in some ways (download, rebuilding & etc). Some movie players offer to disable backups for their content, but this is configurable.\nBecause TED content can be downloaded at any time, probably the developers decided to not backup video content.

This is my first Mac and I'm wondering: is there no Microsoft Internet Explorer for Mac OS X?\nI am a web developer and I need IE (not really lol) but so as I Google it, I see some questionable websites coming up on my Google search but none of them the actual Microsoft site.\nMy main reason is that I need it for browser testing and whatnot and so I see Firefox, Chrome, Safari obviously, but no IE.\nSo the question is: is there/where do I get Internet Explorer for Mac?\n\nA: Microsoft Internet Explorer for Mac is not available for the latest OS X versions (beyond OS X 10.4) as it was effectively replaced by Safari in 2003. As the Wikipedia page for Internet Explorer for Mac explains:\n\nAs a result of the five-year agreement between Apple and Microsoft in\n  1997, it was the default browser on Mac OS and Mac OS X from 1998\n  until it was replaced by Apple's own Safari web browser in 2003. \nOn June 13, 2003, Microsoft announced that it was ceasing further\n  development of Internet Explorer for Mac and the final update was\n  released on July 11, 2003. The browser was not included in the default\n  installation of Mac OS X v10.4 \"Tiger\" which was released on April 29,\n  2005. Microsoft discontinued support for the product on December 31, 2005 and removed the application from their Macintosh downloads site\n  on January 31, 2006. Microsoft recommends \"that users migrate to more\n  recent web browsing technologies such as Apple's Safari.\"\n\nYour best bet is to download the Windows version of IE and run it in a Virtual Machine (using something like VMware Fusion or Virtual Box).\nAlternatively, the OSXDaily article on Internet Explorer for Mac the Easy Way: Run IE 7, IE8, & IE9 Free in a Virtual Machine describes a way to do this (I've not used it myself, but this does appear to circumvent the Windows 30-day trial period by using snapshots and possibly to comply with the EULA you should purchase a Windows licence and use that in a VM with a downloaded version of IE, as above, instead):\n\nWe’re going to walk you through how to install Internet Explorer 7, 8,\n  or 9 in a virtual machine running Windows, directly in Mac OS X – for\n  free. This is achieved by using the freely available VirtualBox\n  software from Oracle, and combining that with free Internet Explorer\n  testing virtual machines from Microsoft, the trick is converting these\n  free IE vm’s so that they work flawlessly under OS X (or Linux,\n  technically), and that is all handled automatically with this method.\n\n\nA: Even the Mac version of IE when it existed rendered pages quite differently than its PC counterpart.\nIf you are to do proper testing in IE (among others), and don't want to juggle 10+ VMs, consider a service such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*CrossBrowserTesting.com - Takes screenshots, and allows you to do functional testing via their web-based VNC client on many platforms, including Windows XP/Vista/7, Android, iOS, OSX, and Linux.  The only downside is that their service is $30/mo.\n\n*BrowserShots.org - Takes screenshots, and is free.  If you're just a designer and don't need to do any cross-platform functional testing, then I'd recommend this route.\n\n\nThere are a handful of other similar services out there.

All you need is\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell current location of network preferences\n        connect service \"<name of your VPN>\"\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\n*displaying the VPN status bar item however, is not part of the Network Preferences Suite. If you cannot live with the icon being present permanently in your status bar area, you will have to use GUI scripting to enable it on demand:\nproperty vpnToUse : \"<name of your VPN>\"\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    -- first activate the network pane, wait for it to load\n    -- also might want to make sure this does not interrupt user interaction\n    <your code here>\n    -- get the index of the VPN in the service list\n    tell current location of network preferences\n        repeat with i from 1 to (count of every service)\n            if name of (service i) is vpnToUse then\n                set listIndex to i\n                exit repeat\n            end if\n        end repeat\n    end tell\n    -- select the VPN item in the service list and activate status bar item\n    tell process (name of application id \"com.apple.systempreferences\")\n        tell window 1\n            select row listIndex of table 1 of scroll area 1\n            tell checkbox 1 of group 1\n                -- only click if not already activated\n                if value is 0 then click it\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nnote this part, as always in GUI scripting, is potentially highly disruptive: it steals focus from the user, in the worst case even canceling whatever she was doing if she happened to be using System Preferences (there is an excellent discussion on the pros and cons of GUI scripting to manipulate System Settings predating the Preferences Suites at MacScripter). It’s also brittle (as it is subject to the specific UI layout of the preferences pane), although if you follow the model I show above, using indexes and process name retrieval via the application ID, it will at least not be affected by localization issues.\n", "Q: Troubleshooting high CPU activity in the WindowServer process As far as I know WindowServer process is used by all apps to draw windows that we see.

This tool is purpose-made for diagnosing exactly this sort of issue, where a simpler tool like Activity Monitor can only show you symptoms.\nThe output from perfdiagnose is not intended for end-users, but for developers and teams at Apple.

However something is still grabbing the key input before any terminal program can.\nFor example when running bash typing   Cmd +  S in the X11.app terminal results in: \n$s\n\nbeing printed to the screen. \nWhen I perform the same  Cmd +  S in the Terminal.app nothing is printed and the OS plays an Error Sound. I am not really sure why the keystroke is not making it to the terminal as expected, how do I allow  Cmd +  S to pass thru.\nFor more information on what / why  I am trying to do this see question Bind <Cmd-S> in Vim\n\nA: I have similar desires to yours. I solved it using a system-level modifier-key re-bind.\n(Of course, this is a mess; but I find it worth it to maintain my MacVim-trained hybrid of OS-wide controls (save, new, copy, paste) within command-line vims.)\nHere's how I did it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Karabiner, which is a very, very powerful program (and an essential part of any poweruser's / programmer's OS X installation, IMHO)\n\n*Enable “Command_L to Control_L (only in Terminal)”:\n\n\n*Map ⌃-prefixed controls matching whichever MacVim commands you're most used-to in command-line vim. For instance, to support ⌘S,\nnoremap  <silent> <C-S>    :update<CR>\nvnoremap <silent> <C-S>    <C-C>:update<CR>\ninoremap <silent> <C-S>    <C-O>:update<CR>\n\n\n*Restore expected ⌘-sequences for Terminal.app itself, by special-casing them in System Preferences. For instance, if you want ⌘N to still control Terminal tabs, instead of mapping it to vim files, try:\n\nNow, anything you don't add in this list, will be passed through verbatim to command-line vim (and, of course, any other command-line program you use.)\n\nCaveats\nThis approach has several further subtle downsides, that I want to hilight for anyone considering taking it (as I do):\n\n\n*\n\n*⌘␣ will no longer map to the system-wide Spotlight. (I've an open issue on Karabiner, and will come back here once I have a stopgap solution.)\n\n*For reasons I can't ascertain, even with the ⌃W exclusions set up in System Preferences, the tab-closing behaviour of Terminal.app changes with this setup: ⌘W will close individual tabs in a window; but if the current tab is the last tab, it will not close the window. Instead, it has no effect. I've had to re-train myself to use ⇧⌘W to close the window if there's only one tab left.\n\n*If you've trained yourself to use ⌃V in MacVim to do block-wise selection, then you'll have to re-train yourself to use the alternative, ⌃Q (or, now, ⌘Q). Additionally, you'll have to add stty -ixon in your shell's startup-script, as ⌃Q is consumed by default to preform an archaic shell-control function (one with no modern usage.)\n\n\n\nAlternative ⌘W behaviour\nIn addition to the above, I decided to further override ⌘W as a universal ‘close this’ key, applicable to multiple applications.\nInstead of mapping ⌘W to ‘Close Tab,’ as above; I personally map that to ⇧⌘W (to retain “immediately close this tab” semantics.) Then, in any given program, I map ⌃W to some sort of close-save-quit functionality.\nFor instance, in my .vimrc:\nnoremap  <C-W>    :confirm quit<CR>\nvnoremap <C-W>    <C-C>:confirm quit<CR>\ninoremap <C-W>    <C-O>:confirm quit<CR>\n\n… or my .zshrc:\nfunction close_tab { exit }\nzle -N close_tab_widget close_tab\nbindkey           '' close_tab_widget\nbindkey -M vicmd  '' close_tab_widget\n\nWith those two snippets in place, and your Terminal configured to ‘Close if shell exits cleanly,’ a series of ⌘Ws will first quit vim, and then close the shell entirely.\nIn addition, now additional on-exit functionality of programs can be preserved: for instance, vim will ask before quitting if files are unsaved (just like MacVim); and zsh will ask before quitting if there are background jobs.\n\nPostscript: Not directly related to your question; but you should also check out ‘Ubiquitous Vim Mode’ in Karabiner. It's “a bit much” for me to use everyday, but it's a very cool idea, and surprisingly-well implemented.\n\nA: not sure if this applies, but stty uses ctrl-s to stop the terminal until restarted with ctrl-q. I'd be a bit leery about sending ctrl-s to a terminal.\n", "Q: Does iPad rotate right sooner than it rotates left (or up or down)? If I don't have screen rotation lock turned on on my iPad 2 (OS 5.1) and am trying to use it in portrait mode, it's constantly rotating to the right when I don't want it to. Since it felt overly sensitive, I did a test to see how far it would have to tilt off of flat to rotate to a given direction.\nTo change rotation to up, down, or left, I needed to tilt it maybe 40 degrees off of flat. To change to right rotation, though, it only took a tilt of maybe 20 degrees.\nI have the 'Clinometer' app (a fancy level), and its readings seem more or less accurate, so it doesn't seem like a problem with the accelerometer. Do others experience the same thing? Is there any setting I can change to tweak this?\n\nA: I've just tried with an iPad (3rd gen) running 5.1, there doesn't seem to be a difference when I tilted left or right. At least, not a 20° difference.\nBut there could be. Since starting from iPad 2 there's the Smart Cover, people are more likely to tilt the iPad to the right, to have it in \"typing mode\" so Apple could have lowered the angle necessary to rotate the screen.\n", "Q: CrashReporter itself keeps crashing I never get crash logs when an application crashes, and the reason is that CrashReporter itself crashes:\n4/20/12 10:11:25 AM com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[104]\n(com.apple.ReportCrash.Self[133]) Job appears to have crashed: Trace/BPT trap\n\nA google search shows that I'm not the only person to experience this. But I haven't found a definitive cure. A popular google hit suggests moving the LaunchAgents .plist file from the System LaunchAgents to the User LaunchAgents, but that made no difference for me. I'm wondering if anyone has actually solved this.\n(This is on Snow Leopard. I have a Lion installation and another Snow Leopard computer; the problem doesn't occur there. It's just this one volume.)\n\nA: try these two things: \n\n\n*\n\n*boot to safe mode, and then reboot. (hold Shift at system chime) \n\n*boot to single user mode, delete /Systems/Library/Caches & subdirectories\n\n\nfixed lots of crash reporter errors on my machine. \n\nA: If you can reproduce this on a clean installation on that machine, it might be interesting to track down why and how the OS has become corrupted. It's not a tidy answer, but even for someone that can debug things - without the source code to the program this may be chasing a needle in a haystack to know why one of your computers isn't happy when it's crashing.\n", "Q: scheduled account lock Mac OS X You can set your Mac OS X account to automatically lock the screen so that the password is required after a certain amount of time of inactivity, but can you do the same thing using a schedule (say at 5:30 PM every day)? Kind of like how you can have the computer turn on/off or go to/wake up from sleep at a certain time. \n\nA: EDIT: Although I am not certain of why cron fails to work for this specific use-case, this answer is superceeded by the (currently more correct) answer using launchd.\nUse crontab -e in the terminal application to add /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend to the Crontab at the appropriate time, like so (for 5:30 PM):\n30 17 * * * /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend\n\nA: You can use launchd to do this.  Place the following xml into a new text file in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ and call it something descriptive with a suffix of .plist.  For example, mine is ~/Library/LaunchAgents/logoutAt1730.plist.\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n    <plist version=\"1.0\">\n    <dict>\n        <key>Label</key>\n        <string>Logout At 5:30 PM</string>\n        <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession</string>\n            <string>-suspend</string>\n        </array>\n        <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>\n        <dict>\n            <key>Hour</key>\n            <integer>17</integer>\n            <key>Minute</key>\n            <integer>30</integer>\n        </dict>\n    </dict>\n    </plist>\n\nIf you want it to run on the current power cycle (Eg you don't want to restart for this to take effect) use launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/logoutAt1730.plist to tell launchd about the new item.  It should load automatically next time you login.\nUse launchctl list and look for the label string (Logout at 5:30 PM) to validate that launchd knows about the item.\nI have verified this works on my workstation.  I don't know why cron doesn't.\n\nA: I wanted something similar, but instead of always locking at a specific time, I wanted to lock only on certain conditions. The script I used to check those conditions was triggered by cron, so I had the same issue.\nWhen I tried CGSession -suspend in a cronjob, and noticed that when it was triggered, Console.app logged an error, saying only root and the current logged user could trigger a Fast User Switching. So my solution: run it as root.\nSo in my script, I used the following, to lock the computer:\nsudo /usr/bin/osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to do shell script \"/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend\"'\n\nConvoluted? Yes. Working? Positive!\n", "Q: How do I remove or delete an @me.com email? I currently have 2 Apple IDs, one that uses my Gmail account and I have been using this one for a while now, this is the one I want to keep. \nWhen iCloud came out, I registered an @me.com email for free to reserve my name. But when I did this it registered a separate Apple ID rather then attach to my other Apple ID. \nThis is ridiculously frustrating, all I want to do is remove or delete one of my Apple IDs or @me.com email to make it available to my original Gmail account.\nHow would I do this? I don't see anywhere allowing you to delete your account.\n\nA: You cannot move, merge, or delete an Apple ID once it is created. Once it is created, it is a permanent account.\nMore info available here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HE37?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\n\nA: Currently, there is no provision to merge accounts which would allow you to combine everything and get rid of the unwanted account cleanly. I've not heard of a process to delete one other than letting it sit unused until the next time the service prunes unused accounts. That would at least let you walk away from everything related to the old account and perhaps enable it to be pruned / reused sooner rather than later.\nIn the past, unused accounts have not been deleted and freed, but with the move to iCloud some older accounts could get deleted and freed up but only Apple knows if this is planned since nothing has been spoken publicly about this.\nWhat you can do is change all personal information on the account you wish to leave behind and set the password to something written down in a safe location and wait for it to expire.\nYou can change your Apple ID on all accounts that are not ended with @mac.com @icloud.com or @me.com which is a welcome change to the past when you couldn't even do that. As it's not perfectly clear what your end goal is, why not reach out to Apple's billing and account support and discuss your particular needs with an actual employee trained in how the system works to see if they have a better answer for you.\n", "Q: vim arrow keys inserting strange character in iterm2 vim escape & arrow keys are inserting strange character (the letter q in my case) but works perfectly if launched in a tmux session or with terminal.app\nSomeone having the same problem?\n\nA: Setting the Report Terminal Type to ansi or linux in my profile solved my problem.\nWhen the terminal type of your sessions is set to one of those \"xterm\" types, iTerm handles the arrow keys, the home key, and the end key in a special way.\n", "Q: How to disable iChat's popup \"You are not connected to the internet\"? I am tired of seeing the \"You are not connected to the internet\" message from iChat every time after I open my macbook. I use iChat for screen sharing. Is it possible to disable the annoying popup or should I just use another app for messaging and screen sharing?\n\nA: You should probably use another app for screensharing and messaging.  If you choose to do this, I reccomend Adium for messaging and TeamViewer for screensharing.  I searched the contents of the whole iChat application, and I couldn't find anything, which leads me to believe that the pop up (I've had it too) is not actually part of the iChat application, but used by iChat.\n\nA: Open ichat, close windows, logout. That fixed it for me.\n", "Q: What is the size of a typical iPhone backup to iCloud? I currently backup my iPhone and iPad to iTunes. I’m considering switching the backups to iCloud, but I am not ready to purchase one of the additional storage plans.\nIf my 32 GB iPhone has 3 GB of free space, does the backup to iCloud only backup settings, phone data, etc. which would require far less space? Most of the space used on my phone is my music collection; surely it doesn’t backup all of the music as well, right?\nWhat is the typical size of an iOS backup stored to iCloud?\n\nA: If you use iCloud Photo Library, then your photos won’t be uploaded to iCloud for backup. The same goes if you use iTunes Match and MUSIC: you music won’t need to be uploaded to iCloud for backup.\nIf you don’t use those services then yes, your iCloud backup will contain your photos and music. Otherwise you wouldn’t be able to restore your device the way it was.\nAnd yet, even though I’m an iTunes Match and iCloud Photo Library user, my fairly barebones iPad takes up 1 GB of storage for backup.\nMy iPhone has a few more apps, (2 pages’ worth). However under iCloud → Storage, only one app stores over 200 MB (Runkeeper) with everything else taking under 50 MB. The vast majority takes up mere kilobytes. I don’t backup my Health data because this seems to be causing issues. Somehow my iPhone’s backup takes up 2.2 GB.\nAs far as data consumption, I believe iCloud performs differential backups, because while the initial backup takes a significant amount of time, subsequent backups seem to complete much more quickly.\n\nA: I recently did an iPhone 6 to iPhone 6s restore at an Apple store. The clerk there said the 29GBs of storage used on the device is only 1GB on the Apple iCloud backup servers. She could also see many previous iCloud backups that were also 1GB. Most of my data is recorded audio which has to be re-Added to the iPhone's music Library via iTunes or a 3rd party app. The iCloud backups are encrypted with Apple's keys on their servers and during transmission to Apple servers. The backup is decrypted by Apple (without having to know the device passcode) for law enforcement access with proper court orders.  \n\nA: Here is a list of things that iCloud stores in your iOS Backup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Purchased music, TV shows, apps, and books\n\n*Photos and video in the Camera Roll\n\n*Device settings\n\n*App data\n\n*Home screen and app organization\n\n*Messages (iMessage, SMS, and MMS)\n\n*Ringtones\n\n\niCloud does not back up the songs that you have NOT purchased from iTunes. iTunes purchases should not reflect in the size of your backup.  iCloud stores your purchase history and then re-downloads the files at restore.\nDepending on the amount of data stored in your apps, I would estimate that the file size would be roughly 1Gb-2Gb.  Of course that all depends on the number of applications, photos and videos you have.\n", "Q: Are Photos from the Photos app in iOS backed up to iCloud? Are Photos from the Photos app in iOS backed up to iCloud? I basically make albums in iPhoto and they are saved in my Photos app on my device. I really hope these are getting backed up to iCloud.

I am a programmer and I like my new iPad because its screen is fantastic. \nI am eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Adonit Writer Plus for the new iPad in the mail. \nHere's what I want to know: Which iPad remote desktop apps have the best bluetooth keyboard support? The keyboard has most of the standard keys and I'd like to be able to issue Ctrl, Alt, Windows (and the *nix and Mac equivalents) keypresses to the host machine seamlessly.

(I understand that GPS drains battery because it requires a different component to be charged up.) Or the fact that the GPS is enabled only means that the App can use it?\n\nA: If GPS is enabled at an app level it doesn't use more battery unless an app uses GPS. And even if an app uses GPS it can do so in a way that minimizes it's usage and battery drain. For example if Foursquare were to use GPS efficiently it would only fetch your location when you are checking in or looking up places to check in then turn off it's access to the GPS.\nNow at a system level enabling GPS might drain the battery a little but that depends on what you have enabled, i.e. Find my iPhone.\n\nA: When you give an app permission to use your location, in other words enable GPS for it, the app may or may not use it.  Some apps use it briefly to get a fix once each time you start the app, some apps don't use it until you perform a certain action in them, others use it whenever the app is open, and some even continue to use it after you've closed the app - for instance if you're doing turn-by-turn directions in the background.\nTo know if an app is actively using the GPS, and thus draining the battery faster than normal, is to look in the status bar next to the clock.  If there's a little white arrow, then an app (probably the one you've got open right now) is actively using the GPS.\nIf you don't have an app open, and the arrow appears, you can find out which app is using the GPS by going to the Settings app, selecting Location Services and going down the list of apps.  For each app there's the app name, and then a selector that determines whether that app is allowed to use the GPS.  Scroll down that list and look for a little arrow between the app and the selector.  If any app is using the GPS right now, it will show up as an arrow next to the app name.  The color and fill of the arrow provide additional information, which you can find out about here: How can I tell when the iPhone is actively using GPS versus only using region monitoring? . That question also gives a screeshot of the Location Services screen with an arrow showing, so you can get an idea of what to look for when you go through your list of apps.  It's for the iPad, but the iPhone is very similar in design.\nIf an app is using GPS and you don't want it to, change the selector to OFF and it will stop using the GPS and draining your battery.\n\nA: No. setting \"location services\" to \"on\" in iphone just gives the apps permission to use the gps module; it's the apps that actually kick starts the gps hardware to function. so, unless until apps start using the gps, no battery is consumed.\n", "Q: How can I sync my iPad/iPhone with iTunes except for the apps/iBooks? There are several GB of data on my iPad which I do not need to have on my MacBook Pro. I want to sync my iPad with iTunes on my Mac except for...\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS apps\n\n*iBooks\n\n\nBut whenever I try to sync, I am prompted to first transfer all the purchases to iTunes - otherwise the apps will be removed from my iPad.\nCan I avoid this dilemma? I thought that iCloud saves what apps/iBooks I use on my iPad.\n\nA: The reason why it's asking you to transfer purchases is because your Mac doesn't have the apps (and the data associated with said apps (e.g.: game data, documents, etc).) on file on the computer. When it's transferred, it can successfully back it up without losing your data.\nAs far as I can tell, there is no way around it; you are going to have transfer the files. After that, go to the \"Apps\" tab on your iPad section of iTunes and uncheck it. This should stop syncing your apps. Do the same with the \"Books\" section.\nAs for the question of whether or not your apps and books are on iCloud, they are. Every song, album, music video, TV show, app, or book that you have downloaded is associated with your Apple ID and can be re-downloaded for no extra charge.\nI hope that this solves your issue.\n", "Q: Merging folders when copying & pasting in Finder I've recently switched from Windows 7. One Windows feature that I'm missing is the possibility to merge folders (the German version of Windows is calling this \"integrate\") when copying & pasting them. \nThe merge feature works like this: if you paste a folder into a location that already contains a folder of that name, you get the option to merge the content of both folders. The files from the new folder will be pasted into the existing one; on conflicts, you get a choice what to do.\n\nFinder doesn't seem to support this: the only choice I get is to overwrite the older folder with the new one (with no explanation of what exactly this does), or stop the process.\nIs there a way to merge folders in Finder? Am I overlooking something?\n\nA: Because of a lot of complaints of people used to the Windows way, merging folders is now a feature in OSX Lion :\n\nThis merge dialog will only show up if:\n\n\n*\n\n*destination folder isn't empty\n\n*destination folder contents are different from to be copied one\n\n\nSo the way to merge folders in an officially supported way is to upgrade to Lion :-)\n\nA: Use rsync in terminal:\nrsync -arvu SOURCE_DIR DEST_DIR --ignore-existing\n\nThe --ignore-existing flag will ensure that you do not overwrite files in the dest folder that are already there. Incidentally, if you want to sync with an external hard drive or USB drive look under the folder /Volumes (All external hardware is mounted there)\n\nA: The feature you're talking about is NOT supported out of the box.\nWhat you could do though to achieve the very same thing is to use some external utility :\nFolder Merge (Free)\n\nSmall software utility that will merge folder contents\nBy Default OSX doesn't merge folder contents so this is a simple GUI tool to do just that.\nIf simply you want to merge the files located in two separate folders, you can easily do that with Folder Merge.\n\n\nUnison (Free)\n\nUnison is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and Windows. It allows two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored on different hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the changes in each replica to the other.\n\n\nA: You can also go into the source folder, hit command-a which will select all items in the folder then drag them to the destination folder and drop. You can process the overwrites one at a time by responding to the dialogs or you can tell it to just skip.\n\nA: Check the cp command. Use man cp and read the options.\nYou can do something like: \ncp -r -u ~/source ~/destination\n\n-R, -r, --recursive : copy directories recursively \n-u, --update : copy only when the SOURCE file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file is missing\n-p same as --preserve=mode,ownership,timestamps \n-v --verbose : explain what is being done\n\nSo if you want to copy files from you Downloads/music folder to say your Music/new folder you would do something as: \ncp -ruvp ~/Downloads/music/* ~/Music/new/ \nThis would merge the contents of these two folders and if two files with the same name and path exist it would keep the newest one based on the timestamp.\n", "Q: Preventing applications from creating folders in your documents folder I have two applications (Microsoft RDP Client and Parallels Desktop) that insist on creating their own folders in my Documents folder. They use those to store user-specific files, settings, profiles and such.\nMy Documents folder is neatly organized and I don't want applications creating their folders in it. Parallels Desktop has a setting allowing me to change the path for its folder, but the Microsoft RDP client doesn't seem to. \nIs there a straightforward way to prevent an application from automatically creating folders in Documents?\nIn my specific case, I'd be happy with a solution that prevents RDP Client from creating the directory altogether, e.g. by creating a hidden locked entry with the same name as the folder it wants to create. \n\nA: I understand your frustration, but I suggest you just hide the offending folders from Finder, you can easily do that with the following terminal command:\nchflags hidden ~/Documents/HideMe\n\nPreventing those folders to be created is likely going to cause problems running those applications.\n\nA: *\n\n*Right click on folder you wish to have scrubbed from existence.  \n\n*Click \"Properties\".\n\n*Click \"Hidden\".\n\n*Click \"Apply\".\n\n\nUnfortunately this only hides it and does not remove it.  You will have to repeat this process for any folders created, but it seems to be a way to at least keep your documents folder organized to your liking.\n", "Q: Using Skype in TV mode on a Mac Mini I've got my mac mini hooked up as a media centre - using Plex - and it's great!\nI control everything with a Logitech Harmony One.\nOne thing I've wanted to get going is Skype on the TV.  I have a webcam I can hook up to the Mac Mini, however the Mac version of skype does not seem to contain a 'couch mode' that can be controlled via a remote.\nIs there any way to install Skype on my Mac Mini, and make it easy to use with a remote?\n\nA: I have much the same setup as you and therefore ran into much the same dilemma, so the following may not answer your question, but it might help! \nI began by using Remote Buddy's \"Virtual Mouse\" function to use my Apple Remote to navigate around Skype using the directional buttons to move the mouse around (once contacts are set up, its mostly moving and clicking). However, I'm the first to admit this is a bit clunky and not exactly ideal. (I realise you're using a Harmony One, as opposed to an Apple Remote, which doesn't appear to be officially supported, but it looks as though its possible to pair it with Remote Buddy).\nIn the end, I gave in a bought a Logitech diNovo Mini which is good enough for when I need a keyboard and mouse. And you can also use it for some Couch-friendly surfing too :)\n", "Q: Best practice for installing applications for multiple users? I have a MBP with Lion (10.7.3) on it and there are two user accounts on it, I use them to seperate work and private stuff, but when I install apps, I generally want to use/upgrade/remove them using either account.\nApplications that come as a package (.pkg/.mpkg) tend to install/upgrade easily and require admin permissions in a user friendly way, no problem here.\nOther applications just come as an app bundle, which you can move to a desired location, in my case this is the /Applications folder, since I like all apps to be in a central place. But when user A moves an application there, there's no need for a password, but a application will be owned by user A, and read-only to user B. A lot of things that are supposed to be user-friendly break in this situation, for example: applications that upgrade themselves stumble over this, and instead of replacing an old bundle with a new one, I have to manually delete the old one before putting the new one in place. It's not the end of the world, but I wouldn't exactly call this user friendly.\nSo, how is it possible that user A can dump something in the /Applications folder without using a password, only to find it read-only to user B? It's very annoying. Also when I install something in account A, but use it the first few times using account B the \"this application came from the internet, are you sure you want to use it?\"-warning doesn't go away until I use it with account B.\nI'd like the applications (or their folder, whatever) to be read-write for both or writable using a password or something. Is there a way to make this annoyance go away? Should I install these applications in a different way? I want to manage my apps \"user account-agnostically\" if that's possible.\nI have experience with linux/unix/command/BSD subsystem, what have you, so answers of a technical nature will help. Of course I have tried chmod, chown creatively to tackle single instances, but I don't like fiddling around with permissions when I'm in the mac's natural habitat (system folders/app bundles). So any info on this matter will help.\nEDIT:\nJust to make it clear, I would like a nice workflow for managing/upgrading apps between two admins on the same computer, it shouldn't require an understanding of file permissions as it does now, it seems this situation is something the developers at Apple never thought of. Filling in a password is no problem, but sometimes deleting an app (in order replace it with an upgrade) is impossible unless I open Terminal and use sudo rm -rf /Application/SomeApplication.app. You just can't expect that from two users of a single computer that know both are able to install/delete apps but aren't technically savvy.\n\nA: Best practice - use one admin account that is used to install applications. Start application with the admin account after download.\n\n\n*\n\n*Avoids file permission problems when updating applications.\n\n*As long as the admin account has OK:ed the \"downloaded from internet\" popup, the other users do not have to.\n\n*If the other users are not administrators, they will have less automatic update notifications (at least System Update will not run).\n\n*Avoids the need for cryptic terminal commands after every installation.\n\n", "Q: Installing App using iTunes I've downloaded a game from iTunes to my PC and want to install it in my iPod Touch.

Sadly the performance is still very inconsistent, and I couldn't yet nail the cause down.\n\nA: The problem could be a huge amount of interferences produced by other Wi-Fi networks in the same band, 2.4Ghz band is shared by a lot of technologies (from DECT phones to Bluetooth and WiFi) and depending your area,neightbours and the way your building have been built, you can get a lot of issues like this.\nIn those situations i recommend switching to cable, it will always give you maximum performance if you are most of the time in the same place.\nAnother option will be to switch the band to 5GHz which is lot less crowded and much robust in terms of interferences, so if boh of your devices support that band give it a try! Your wifi will also reach some more distance\n\nA: The Wireless Diagnostic Tool that come with OSX is a great resource for finding out what the cause of your problem might be and it even suggests you the best channels to use based on your scenario (interferences of other wi-fi networks, for example).

Every time I open iPhoto '11 (version 9.2.3, latest version), it displays a dialog box that asks me to repair inconsistencies in my iPhoto library. After I click Repair, it takes 5 minutes to finish and after closing iPhoto and re-opening it, it displays the same message. I've re-installed iPhoto from the Mac App Store already and I can't see why iPhoto is doing this. It's a hassle to have to repair the library after every time it opens, and even when I cancel the repair, it works fine. Is there any way I can fix this?\nAlso, Photo Stream is acting up. When I go under the Photo Stream tab (which has been working fine until now), it says I am signed in.  After clicking \"Turn on Photo Stream,\" it displays a dialog box asking me to authorize iPhoto to access the Keychain. \"Always allow\"-ing it only makes it appear again and this continues from 10 to 15 times. When they finally disappear, Photo Stream simply doesn't do anything at all, and stays at the page explaining Photo Stream and the buttons to enable it.\nAs if all of that wasn't enough, after exporting two photos from Photo Booth, iPhoto insists on trying to import an already-imported picture EACH time the window is inactive (when I click on something other than iPhoto, e.g. Safari or Finder) and asks me to resolve duplicates.

My desk is a little too narrow for the long type of Apple keyboard -- the one that has the keypad and the Home ↖, End ↘, Page Up ⇞, Page Down ⇟ keys...  (it will take up the space for the mouse).\nSo if the small (wireless) keyboard is used, is there a way to simulate these keys: Home ↖, End ↘, Page Up ⇞, Page Down ⇟?  (Home ↖ takes a user to beginning of page, End ↘ takes the user to end of page).\nIn some apps like Chrome and Safari, Command ⌘ + Up ↑ is like Home ↖, and Command ⌘ + ↓ Down is like End ↘.  Fn + Up ↑ is like Page Up ⇞, Fn + ↓ Down is like Page Down ⇟, but it won't work in some apps such as in Finder (File Manager) and iTunes, where both of them will only do PageUp and PageDown simulation but not Home ↖ orEnd ↘ simulation.\nI have this keyboard:\n\nNot this keyboard (which has the dedicated Home ↖, End ↘, Page Up ⇞, and Page Down ⇟ keys):\n\n\nA: The Command+Up/Down keys you mentioned for Chrome and Safari are coincidences. The Fn+Up/Down keys are not. Those key combinations are actually mapped to the Page up/Page down keycodes, so the application thinks you actually pressed those keys. There are similar mappings for Home and End: Fn+Left and Fn+Right, respectively. These Fn+Arrow mappings will work exactly like Page Up/Down and Home/End in any application, unless it somehow is working around the system.\n", "Q: iTunes refuses to Restore home screen arrangement from Backup I backed-up my device to my MacBook Pro at the Apple Store right before I got my replacement iPhone.  I did it with an empty iTunes, as my library was on an external drive that I didn't have with me.  I don't sync my device to my Mac often (probably did it a month ago).  The genius told me that it will still work and I will get all my Apps back.  When I got back, several times I tried to restore it from Backup and get all the apps and app layout that I had on my old iPhone.  I failed every single time.  I then made sure that the iTunes library had all the Apps that I had on my iPhone and had them all up to date; this was about 200 apps I had to download or update. I then erased my iPhone and got ready to restore it again.  However when my iPhone came back up it didn't restore all the apps and app layout that I had on my iPhone at the Apple Store.  The apps & layout was old by several weeks. However at one point the correct home screen arrangement in iTunes at one point.\niTunes will back up the following information (from Apple Support):\nApp Store Application data including in-app purchases (except the Application itself, its tmp and Caches folder).\nApplication settings, preferences, and data, including documents.\nHome screen arrangement.\n...\nThus restoring from my backup should give me the correct home screen arrangement and application data.  The iTunes Library file (because I have all applications downloaded and up to date) will add the Application itself.  However for some reason my backup file is not restoring the correct home screen arrangement (restoring weeks old arrangement), even though all the other data that is on it (ie. pictures I took the day before) is restored.\nI have moved my Device Backup file to another computer's Guest account, plugged in my external device and tried restoring it from that computer's Guest account to see if it will work correctly from there. Once it the device was rebooting I removed it from iTunes.  It had no apps on it.  I reconnected it to iTunes and then it showed the correct home screen arrangement for about a minute until it started syncing, and then it reverted to the old home screen arrangement.  I now deleted the other backup files so that the only backup file is the correct one.  After doing this I restored it again and once again I see the correct home screen arrangement until it starts syncing.  I want to have it restored with the correct layout so that I get the Application data for the new applications that are only present on the correct layhome screen arrangementut.\nThe correct home screen arrangement is present until after the \"preparing apps to sync\" and then it reverts to the old home screen arrangement.  I'm guessing it is syncing to the old preferences overwriting the correct home screen arrangement. I only want it to restore with the applications and not sync.  Also with the correct home screen arrangement in iTunes if I drag App A onto App B it creates a folder with two App As.  Then when I close the folder App B is only present.  I have something really weird going on here!  The incorrect home screen arrangement also shows page 8 being grayed out even though their are apps on page 9 and 10.\nWith the only backup file (the April 19th one) I tried it again.  I click restore from backup and left it plugged in.  After it rebooted the apps in the iTunes view was the old home screen arrangement again.  I removed the iPhone after about 3 applications synced.  I then replugged in the device and the correct home screen arrangement was shown again.  I deleted an app from the correct home screen arrangement and clicked apply.  After a few seconds it reverted to the old home screen arrangement again.  What is wrong with iTunes?  I feel like I need to delete some file somewhere.\nI have currently been erasing the device from the device settings.  I am now going to try clicking restore from iTunes and I will try again restoring from backup.\nHow can I have it restore the backup version of the home screen arrangement and not sync the home screen arrangement on iTunes??\n\nA: Yay! After many attempts I finally restored my iPhone to the state that it was at when I entered the Apple Store.  I manually backed up my iPhone to a brand new iTunes library that my iPhone was not being synced to.  So to properly restore from back up I needed to restore from a brand new iTunes Library.  At first glance, this seems wrong.  I saw my iPhone after this initial restore with zero non-Apple applications, so at this point I gave up on this method.  But this is expected.  To continue, after restoring from a brand new iTunes library then open the iTunes library that the phone was synced to and wait for everything to sync back.  Once this process completed I had the correct home screen arrangement and everything, minus the status of the Podcasts that I had listened to, which, with a 1001 item Podcast library saddening me.  It only restored unplayed/played status from the last time I synced the device.\nNote: The iPhone remembers where the last play point was, if it was in the middle of the podcast, but doesn't show it.  (i.e. Podcast Episode X shows its unplayed. I click on it and it starts playing with 3 minutes left)  I want to get this information visible again so that I can see what episodes I have played completely through.\n", "Q: Preview on Lion will open all images I opened last time, and need to close each window one by one?

Then I was able to update all the 3 answers and add a \"Rescue Email Address\".\nI'm not 100% sure if omitting the email was what got it to work or if it was just a matter of timing but I wanted to post this in case it helps anyone else get past the issue.\n\nA: That solution didn't work for me but here's what did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Visit the Apple Web Site -- www.apple.com\n\n*Click on \"Store\" \n\n*On Store Main Page you'll see 'Account' on the far right...\n -- There are several choices in the Account pull-down, choose \"Account Home Page\n\n*If prompted to login, do so...\n\n*Click on:  \"Change your default shipping or billing info\"\n\n*In my case, I entered the same (new) card number I had been trying via the App Store but here it seemed to accept it. I will just add that I turned on \"Express Check-Out\" here but I strongly doubt that had any effect as I believe that's strictly for the Apple.com site (?).\n\n*Leaving the web site and now back at the App Store, I attempted to purchase the same App as I had previously and was presented with exactly the same request to update my Credit Card Security Digits.\n\n*This time however I could see that it had accepted my AMEX Card Number (last 4 were correct/new) - previously of course over the past several hours it had instead presented the Error Message we're all gathered here talking about (Unable to process...)\n\n*Indeed I entered the proper security digits and bingo - back at cruising altitude, all systems green. Phew, that wasn't fun.\nHope this helps someone, altogether frustrating experience -- not even a satisfied feeling once fixed, just exasperation fatigue! \nFWIW, having been through this a couple of times in the past two years and previously just giving up for a few days or more I do wonder whether this might have a measurable impact on Apple's bottom line. Doubtful it's much in the big scheme of things but as any business person knows it's the little things adding up that often make all the difference in achieving your projections. \nGood luck all, and Apple you too.\n", "Q: Exporting a Video in Quicktime in OS X Lion Shows only Audio I'm trying to export a video in OS X Lion to either 480, 720, or 1080 but it only exports the audio file. After the export, the file is in .mov format but, when I play it, the file shows nothing, only the audio is played. Before I updated to Lion, I could export videos just fine. How can I resolve this issue?\n\nA: Make sure that the \"Audio only\" option is not selected in the Export window.\n\n", "Q: Audio Devices: Hardware Rate Converter Audio MIDI Setup -> Audio Devices -> Built-in Input has four configurable audio parameters:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sample Rate\n\n*Sample Size\n\n*Channel Volume\n\n*Hardware Rate Converter\n\n\nThe Hardware Rate Converter has three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Automatic\n\n*Enable\n\n*Disable\n\n\nThis \"Hardware Rate Converter\" has basically no google presence. Having a decent understanding of digital audio I can infer what these three options will do, but I don't feel confident knowing what the specific correlation is between these options and the actual bits being processed by my mac on input.\nSo. Where can I find general specs on this thing? I'll settle for just knowing what (if any) latency these three options incur.\n\nMacbook Pro 10.7.3 (11D50)\n15-inch, 2.53GHz, Mid 2009\n2.53 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo \nMemory 4 GB 1067 MHz DDR3\nIntel High Definition Audio, Audio ID: 76\n\nA: Apple has documentation for this in Mountain Lion.\n\nIf your computer contains support for the hardware sample rate converter, the Hardware Rate Converter pop-up menu is available in the Input menu. When you choose Automatic from the pop-up menu, the hardware sample rate converter is turned on if the audio samples coming in are PCM and formatted according to the international standard IEC 60958-3. The hardware sample rate converter is turned off if the input stream is encoded. You can also choose Enable or Disable from the menu to keep the hardware sample rate converter turned on or off.\n\nSo this would only be useful if you have something like a S/PDIF input and wanted the audio converted to a different digital rate.  I don't have any specs on it, but I would expect the hardware rate converter to have very low latency compared to software rate conversion.    \n", "Q: VGA monitor doesn't work at boot time on Mac mini 2011 I have Mac mini 2011 and Samsung Syncmaster 710v (old TFT monitor) connected through mini DisplayPort to VGA. The monitor shows something only when the login screen appears (no boot menu, no boot-loading, just black screen, BUT no info that the monitor isn't connected).\nOn new monitors (VGA), my Mac works great and I can see the boot menu. Is it the monitor's problem, a mini DisplayPort issue, or software? \n\nA: Could be something to do with the energy save technology and standy mode on old tft monitors, if your monitor has energy save.\nProbably that's not 100% compatible with new Macs.\n", "Q: Infinite loop \"Are you sure you want to buy this item?\" in the App Store I have the latest Apple iPod touch. I just received a iTunes gift card and started downloading free apps.\nWhen I try to download apps that are $0.99 or higher, it asks me for my billing information. After I hit clicked 'done', it asks me if I still want to buy the item. I say yes and it starts asking me for my billing info again and then if I'm sure again and again...\nCan someone tell me what to do?\n\nA: Have you tried going to http://appleid.apple.com and confirming your billing information there (going to billing, clicking submit) and then trying again ;-)\n", "Q: Sync voice memos for the first time I recorded a long and important voice-memo on my old iPhone which is not synced anymore to any iTunes. I wanted to retrieve the memo using the advice here, however choosing Sync Music in iTunes brought up this warning:\n\nI tried to click Sync Music and the capacity bar at the bottom indeed indicated that all music, and presumably the voice memos too, would be deleted next time I sync the iPhone (the blue Audio bar was completely gone). I immediately reverted.\nHow can I retrieve the voice memos?\nThe other options in the question linked above include:\n\n\n*\n\n*DropVox - which costs money and forces me to have a DropBox account\n\n*Macroplant iExplorer - which is a freeware that doesn't work for me\n\n\nA: Try this way of syncing. You can also manually update songs if you don't want to lose songs.\nhttp://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/6403/iphone-transfer-voice-memos-from-iphone-to-computer/\nAnother option would be to email them to yourself.\n", "Q: Getting contacts from Microsoft Exchange on my iPhone I recently brought an Android phone and I'm trying to move my contact list from my iPhone to the new phone. Someone suggested using Exchange so I added Exchange to my iPhone using my Gmail details and selected Mail, Contacts, and Calendars. \nIt asked if I wanted to delete contacts from my iPhone and I said yes thinking my contacts were backed up with iTunes.  Now I have lost my contacts from my iPhone and I don't know how to get them from Exchange.  I have also tried selecting Sync contacts with Google in iTunes but this does't seems to have done anything.  What should I do?  \n\nA: Although your phone and your exchange are now in sync, you did not merge both databases. \nBy 'deleting' you relpaced your phones contacts with those of the Google Exchange Server. \nYour contacts are backed up inside the general backup of your phone and if you restore your iPhone from those backups you get your contacts back, though loosing everything new since then. You can extract the contacts directly from the backup with tools like iPhone BackupExtractor. You should be able to import those directly via the gmail webinterface. \n\nA: You should not have clicked Delete contact rather Merge contacts. You might want to reside to other more straight forward ways to transfer and sync iPhone contacts.\nTo get your original iPhone contacts back: If you recently synced your iPhone with iTunes, the contact entries were backed up automatically by iTunes. The only way to restore them is if you restore your iPhone to factory settings via iTunes. iTunes will then ask you whether you wish to restore your iPhone from an earlier backup. Choose the latest entry. Your contact entries will be restored. \n", "Q: Microsoft Word does not respond to keyboard shortcuts I have a MacBook Pro with Microsoft Word 2011 installed on it.\nFor some reason, all the editing keyboard shortcuts - such as Cut: Cmd + X, Copy: Cmd + C, and Undo: Cmd + Z - does not work in it.\nMy friend who also has Microsoft Word 2011 on a MacBook Pro has his keyboard shortcuts working fine.\nThis situation really hinders my work, what could be the problem?\n\nA: Check in the edit menu and see what MS Word thinks its shortcut keys are for cut, copy, and paste. \nIf they're not the keys you’re expecting, maybe something was accidentally configured in Word’s preferences, e.g. some alternate key mapping.  \nAlso, verify that there are not alternative key mappings specified in the Mac System Preferences, both system wide and application specific, that may be modifying your shortcut mappings to other keys.\n\nA: If the configuration of the hot keys disappeared from the Edit menu, you can reconfigure them through the menu \"Tools\", option \"Customize keyboard\"\n\nA: My keyboard shortcuts for Copy, Cut, and Paste also disappeared under Mountain Lion.  Going to Tools/CustomizeKeyboard did not help (the shortcuts are listed under Keyboard Shortcuts but do not show up on the Edit menu).\nThe workaround suggested above works.  In System Preferences/Keyboard/Keyboard Shortcuts/Application Shortcuts, you can add Microsoft Excel (use the + key, then in the Application pulldown menu you might have to go to Other and navigate through the Microsoft Office menu to be able to select Excel).  Then I just added cmd-c, x, and v.  The keyboard shortcuts still do not appear in Excel's edit menu, but the keyboard shortcuts work as they had done previously. \n\nA: Hmm, make sure you're using the \"command\" + \"C\" / \"V\" / \"x\" in order to copy, paste and cut and not \"ctrl\" + the keys.\nMacs dont respond to \"ctrl\" + other key shortcuts.\n\nA: Try quitting Microsoft Word (literally quitting...Command+Q) \nthen reopen and see how it goes. It worked for me.\n\nA: I had the same problem, and I found out how to fix it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to \"Tools\"\n\n*Click on \"Customize Keyboard\"\n\n*Choose \"Edit\"\n\n*Choose \"Edit copy\"\n\n*Highlight F3 and remove it, leaving ⌘ cmd+C and press OK.\nThe same is for \"Edit cut/paste.\" You just remove the F4/F3 etc.\n\n\nA: control panel\nall items\nlanguage\nadvanced settings\n(tick) let me set a different input method for each app\nrestart word\nDONE\n\nA: Mac-Windows-Word/Excel version: this was my fix\n\n\n*\n\n*In Word or Excel go to File\n\n*Options\n\n*Customize Ribbon\n\n*Keyboard Shortcuts\n\n*In Categories - All Commands\nThen search for CopyText, PasteText etc.\nIf no current keys then Press new shortcut key box and assign the keys wanted\n\nA: [Note: I'm using Cmd- the same as Cmd+ as you don't actually type the hyphen or plus, and Cmd is the \"command\" keyboard key. I found the problem using Excel with Office 2011, but it may apply to Word too.) \nCmd-C, Cmd-V, Cmd-X and maybe others stopped working and the shortcuts weren't displayed in the menu after I was messing around trying to add Paste->Transpose to the tool bar. (In addition, selecting an area and hitting Cmd-C did not display the crawling-ants indication around the selection.)\nGive this a try, and it may work. I had flakey results: go to menu View -> Toolbars -> Customize Toolbars and Menus...\nIn the window that appears the Toolbars and Menus \"tab\" is displayed (for me). \nCheck or un-check \"Show ScreenTips for toolbar commands\". (That setting is supposed to show what an icon is supposed to do if you hover the mouse-pointer over it.)\nOnce I UNchecked that box the shortcuts started working again (after \"OK\" dismissing the window) and the shortcut keys were displayed in the menus.\nBTW, \"Show shortcut keys in ScreenTips\" is checked for me.\nNow as I wrote this posting I found out that Cmd-C stopped working again. I went back in and checked \"Show ScreenTips for toolbar commands\" and Cmd-C started working again. And after more experimentation no matter if I check or un-check \"Show ScreenTips for toolbar commands\" I can't get Cmd-C to copy. (However the Edit menu does show that Cmd+C does \"copy to scrapbook\".)\nSo I exited Excel 2011 and went back in and all the shortcuts are again working and \"Show ScreenTips for toolbar commands\" is un-checked. I checked it and the shortcuts continue to work and hovering over an icon displays what function it's supposed to perform.\nTherefore, the above may or may not work for you. \nI still haven't found a way to make a transpose tool bar shortcut, although I read in another forum that Cmd-E is supposed to paste->transpose, but it doesn't for me. (You can get transpose if you use the Home tab's Paste ribbon pull-down but I'm trying to avoid mousing.) I might have to make a macro for it.\n\nA: I don't have an answer for this problem. But I am having problems with Word 2011 and keyboard shortcuts. I am trying to simply create a shortcut for the function \"GotoHeader\". I set it to F4. But when I depress F4 Word does nothing at all. Is there a trick to getting the program to recognize these shortcuts?\n\nA: I have MBP with MSO 2011 also and had same problem. Use \"control\" instead of \"command\" works.\n", "Q: Create a file which when opens and writes a line in Terminal Is there any way to create a file which, when clicked, opens up Terminal and types in and executes a specified line? (eg: say hello world)\n\nA: What you are trying to do is write a \"shell script\" (in case you need to google it later on).\nThe first line of a shell script needs to specify what interpreter to use. In your case, use sh for the regular Bourne shell. You write this with what's called a 'shebang' like so:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nafter this write whatever commands you want to run, in your case, say hello world. The shell interpreter will read this the same as if you had typed it in terminal.\nIn your case, your final file should be:\n#!/bin/sh\nsay hello world\n\nIf you write this in TextEdit.app make sure you are saving in plain text mode (which is toggled through Cmd + Shift + T). You can choose to save with either the extension .command or .sh.\nIf you want to run it by double clicking I recommend the .command extension.\nAnd that's it!\nPossible error: if when running it you receive an error saying:\n\nThe file “[filename]” could not be executed because you do not have\n  appropriate access privileges.\n\nyou need to give yourself execute permission. To do this run:\nchmod u+x path/to/my/file\n\nIf you don't know what the file-path is just type:\nchmod u+x\n\ntype a space, and drag the file into the window.\nIf you're curious, u+x means give user (owner) execution rights.\n\nA: The simple, but completely fallible, approach is to just write a shell script. Save this to a file called mysay.sh:\n#!/bin/sh\nsay hello world\nsay number five is alive\n\nAs long as you don't have XCode installed that should open up in Terminal when you double click on on it.\nYou can also do this with AppleScript and it's a little more durable since you don't have to worry if the default application for .sh files isn't Terminal:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n  set currentTab to do script \"/usr/bin/say hello world\"\n  do script \"/usr/bin/say number five is alive\" in currentTab\nend tell\ndelay 5\ntell application \"Terminal\" to quit\n\nSave that as an Application from the AppleScript Editor and you can double click on it and your Mac will talk to you. You can wait and close the Terminal session afterwards with a little more AppleScript if you like.\n\nA: You can also do this with AppleScript as mentioned above, by Ian C.  However, you can do the single command in fewer lines, and with a delay.  Here is an AppleScript which will run the command, then wait 5 seconds, and then quit the terminal.\ntell application \"Terminal\" to do script \"say hello world\"\ndelay 5\ntell application \"Terminal\" to do script \"logout\"\ntell application \"Terminal\" to quit\n\nJust an alternate method, compared to @Ian C.'s way.  You could also take Ian's .sh file, and rename it .command if you do have XCode, which will open it in Terminal, and do the same thing as the AppleScript, just without the delay.

I use Outlook to access Exchange.  I store old mail in an Outlook Archive folder.

I've got a lot of song in iTunes music library and would like to know for which songs there are music videos available. But, the only way I have found to do that is to manually search for videos for each song and this process is simply impractical. \nI figure there must be an easy way to know if there is video which I can purchase for every song in my library.\n\nA: You can try what this fellow suggested as an answer because I think you can easily import iTunes tracks to the Spotify application.\nThat's the only way I can think of.\n\nA: An imperfect solution, but one that will return a reasonable accurate set of results. This is based on being able to use AppleScript with iTunes and a published API to perform searches at the iTunes Store. The key aspect that makes this solution imperfect is that the data I can get out of iTunes (artist names, etc.) does not necessarily match what the iTunes store has in its database.\nThis AppleScript does require that 'JSON Helper' application from the App Store.

I used redsn0w to get an untethered jailbreak on my iPod touch. And now I want to remove it.\nI've seen people mention that you need to backup the iPod to iTunes and then restore it. However, when you restore it, iTunes will install the latest OS (5.1) on the device. This isn't good if you plan on jailbreaking again in the future (i.e. you want to leave it on 5.0.1). So is there any other way I could remove the jailbreak from the device and keep 5.0.1 on the iPod? Would using \"Erasing all content and settings\" on the iPod work?\n\nA: Agreed, you have to restore your device in order to remove the jailbreak.\nBut it's not that easy to restore to an earlier version of iOS - Apple verifies each restore of iOS and only lets you restore to the latest version (currently iOS 5.1). If you want to restore to an earlier version, you have to artificially verify the restore.\nFor an iPod touch, you can artificially verify the restore if you have pre-saved SHSH blobs for the device, by stitching them into custom firmware and using that to restore. Here's a guide to seeing if Cydia managed to save SHSH blobs for you and using them to restore your device. If Cydia didn't save SHSH blobs for you, you may be able to use redsn0w or iFaith to \"dump\" partial iOS 5.0.1 SHSH blobs off your device and then use them to stitch a custom IPSW - see this guide to using iFaith.\n\nA: This question holds a part of the answer. Basically you have to restore your device.\nIs you want to install a particular version of iOS on your device then you will have to locate the official firmware on your hard drive (.ipsw file) or download it from Apple.\nThen instead of restoring like usual you will have to hold the option key, hit restore and then you will be given the opportunity to select the file to use for the restore.\n", "Q: Windows installed on 17\" MacBook shows bad resolution.

These resolutions don't look good on my screen, in fact, they look very bad.\n\nA: It sounds like the BootCamp drivers haven't been installed within Windows as those are the default software resolutions for graphics cards without drivers. \nThe BootCamp drivers can be found on the original set of DVDs that came with the machine, which will be updated to the latest versions once installed in Windows.\nYou can download BootCamp 3.2 for Windows, and the 3.3 update here, although 3.2 should update once you're online anyway. http://support.apple.com/downloads/#macoscomponents\n", "Q: How can I store edited pictures with iPhoto for iPhone?

So I just learned of these security questions, I canceled out of the prompt yesterday and I managed to download some apps.\nDo I absolutely have to add these?

I really would rather not have email contacts save into my contact list automatically. Is there a way to stop this from happening?\n\nA: In Gmail Settings, under General, check the following option:\n\nThen go to Contacts and delete all the Other Contacts that were previously added automatically. Performing this action in Gmail will be faster than on your iPhone because you can select all those contacts with a single click. Then, just wait for the deletions to propagate to your iPhone.\n\nA: I suspect you the see this behavior since upgrading to iOS 9. Go into Settings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendars and deactivate Contacts Found in Mail. In iOS 10 it is found at Settings -> Contacts where you can deactivate Contacts Found in Apps. This option should be above the Import SIM Contacts option.\nThis option does not really write all the addresses into the contacts, it just sorts found mail addresses to your contacts (where you can explicitly add them to the contacts database if you want). This is not permanent unless you explicitly choose to import individual addresses, so maybe you can leave this on.\n\nA: Go to settings \n\nmail, contacts calendars \n  select your email account \n  you will see the tab contacts switch this to OFF. \n  It will ask you to delete email content in your contact list.\n  Delete it.\n\nEt voila bye bye emails in contact list.\n(just FYI - it will delete ALL contacts even the PHONE contacts you have added!)\n\nA: Tap on Phone icon. Then tap on contacts. In the contacts page on the upper left hand corner there is an icon named Group. Tap on that and then you come to a page where the heading is : Show all contacts and below that there is All iCloud, All Facebook and All Yahoo etc. Just click on All iCloud and press Done on the upper right hand top corner. You will find all the emails vanish from your contacts and only the phone contacts will remain.\nLet me know if it helps.\n\nA: I had the same problem but what i have just done (pure trial and error) is to go into Settings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendar and, on each of your accounts, unselect Contacts, then import SIM contacts.\nVoilà! No more random email contacts and all the numbers from your SIM! (Not sure how this will effect your email contacts when emailing but you can always sync them again if needed, I guess!)\n\nA: The iOS email contacts are saved into the Contacts app; so, the only way to remove the email addresses from your Contacts app would cause the email addresses not show up in the Mail app. If you are using Gmail, the official Gmail app could be the solution, but I have not used the Gmail app so I cannot be sure.\n\nA: You need to go into your Outlook to your Contact tab and create a folder for business contacts and for personal contacts and separate them accordingly.  Then on your iPhone go into your Contacts and hit groups and you can select either folder or both and this should fix your problem. \n\nA: Go to Phone then select Contacts, or select the Contacts app directly. In the upper left corner select Groups, then remove Suggested Contacts from the list of synced contacts.\n\nA: 1) Go to 'settings' --> 'Mail, Contacts, Calendars\". Scroll down till you see \"import SIM contacts\". Click on that to import your phone contacts to your iPhone.\n4) On your homepage, click on the Phone icon. On the contacts page, click on the 'Groups' button on the top left. Uncheck all (your email accounts), except for 'All on my iPhone'. Now click 'done', and you're all set! Go to your Contacts app directly and do the same (uncheck all email mailboxes). \nIf that doesn't work, try doing this:\n1) Go to 'settings' --> 'Mail, Contacts, Calendars\". Under 'Accounts', access each mailbox and toggle the 'contacts' option to 'off'. \n2) On the same page (Mail, Contacts, Calendar), scroll down till you see \"import SIM contacts\". Click on that to import your phone contacts to your iPhone.\n3) Now, scroll back up to 'Accounts' and toggle the 'contacts' option of all the mailboxes back to \"on\".\n4) Go back to your homepage and click on the Phone icon. On the contacts page, click on the 'Groups' button on the top left. Uncheck all (your email accounts), except for 'All on my iPhone'. Now click 'done', and you're all set! Go to your contacts app directly and do the same (uncheck all email mailboxes). \n\nA: I use my iPhone 5 for work and it syncs with my Outlook on my Windows PC/laptop. When I went to settings and turned off the Contacts switch for the email account it deleted all my contacts. Not a good thing. Instead, I went into Contacts and selected Groups at the top of the screen. I then deseleted Suggested Contacts. Now only the contacts that I input show up and all the random email addresses that I sent an email to once are hidden. They are still there in Suggested Contacts if I want to see them.\n\nA: I was reading all of these and started to follow the path as I too had loads of email junk contacts. Once I opened the Contact page and clicked groups I noticed three choices... All exchanges: Contact: suggested contacts. I clicked the work contacts and the other options no longer have checks next to them. Voila all the junk is gone and only my outlook contacts remain.\n\nA: Let's keep it simple, if you sync with your work Exchange outlook contacts, click on the \"Phone\" icon on your Iphone, in the upper left corner of the screen click on \"Groups\", under \"EXCHANGE\" make sure only \"contacts\" is checked.  If you have \"All Exchange\" checked, it will load all the email addresses as contacts in your IPhone directory. \n\nA: Install 'Delete Contacts' App free from the app store > scroll down to smart filters > scroll down and find 'no phone' > click on this and all the contact with no phone numbers will show up > delete them all and > go back to contacts and sync... all done.\n\nA: Tap Contacts, Groups , then un-tick 'All yahoo'. that's all\n\nA: Happened when I started using gmail. This worked (pasted from above):\nTap on Phone icon. Then tap on contacts. In the contacts page on the upper left hand corner there is an icon named Group. Tap on that and then you come to a page where the heading is : Show all contacts and below that there is All iCloud, All Facebook and All Yahoo etc. Just click on All iCloud and press Done on the upper right hand top corner. You will find all the emails vanish from your contacts and only the phone contacts will remain.\nLet me know if it helps.\nThanks,\n\nA: I actually solved the problem on my iPhone 5s by going to Contacts, Groups, then I clicked on my email address only. It removed all my email addresses from the contacts, but kept the rest, so I didn't have to import contacts from my SIM or do anything else for that matter. \n\nA: Contacts > Groups > uncheck any email servers (make sure there's still a check by your icloud settings). Only contacts you would have entered manually to your phone and backed up via icloud will be there.\n\nA: Go to Contacts app. On the left side at the top you will find Groups. If you select ‘Show all contacts’ you will have all the accounts of contacts, whereas if you select only the iCloud option you will only have phone contacts.\n\nA: Just  done it, contacts, groups and check the ones you want to hide so in my case Outlook contacts, click done and they disappeared.\n\nA: Its correct that you can click on Groups and then uncheck suggested contacts and it fixes the problem. However, in 15 or 20 min (Im assuming this is when the phone syncs back to exchange server) the suggested contracts gets checked again and the problem is back. Im not sure how to stop it from checking itself back on. \n", "Q: is there an App that can extracts parts of a mp3 file without re-encoding the file?

I have recently purchased an Windows Phone 7 (Nokia Lumia 900). I would like to use it alongside with all of my other Apple products. I have an iPhone 4S (I need 2 different phones for work), an iPad 3,an  iMac, and a Macbook Air. All the Apple Device are using iCloud to sync Mail, Contacts, and my Calendar. \nI understand that the Windows 7 Phone doesn't sync with iCloud. I need to use other sync services like Google, Yahoo or Windows Live. I am alright with using those services, but I don't want to give up using iCloud either since all my other device are using it and it works perfectly for me. I want to find the best way to sync my iCloud content with any other sync services that are available for my Windows phone, so I can get all of my contacts and calendars into my Windows Phone, while not changing any sync options for my other Apple Devices.\n\nA: Syncing iCloud Calendar and Google Calendar\nYou can sync your iCloud calendar to Google Calendar using https://icaltogcal.com. However, there are some limitations, most importantly:\n\n\n*\n\n*This is a one way sync, meaning that it goes from iCloud to Google Calendar, but not the other way around.\n\n*Google Calendar only updates these 'subscribed' calendars 'even few hours' so you can't have them always instantly up to date everywhere.\nn.b. I wrote a bit more about this here but this covers the highlights.\nI am not aware of any services which allow you to do true two-way sync between iCloud and Google Calendar.\nBut before you do that, unless there is a specific reason that you have to use iCloud for calendars, you could very easily: export your iCloud calendars to .ics files {and then stop using iCloud… in fact, I would delete them from iCloud once you have the ics files backed up so you don't forget and start to put stuff in the wrong place}, import the .ics files to Google Calendar, and then access Google Calendar from your Macs, iOS devices, and Windows 7.\nThat seems like a much easier and better option than trying to sync calendars between iCloud and Google Calendar, which, quite frankly, isn't likely to happen.\nSyncing iCloud Contacts and Google Contacts\nIt is possible to sync iCloud and Google Contacts. There are apps to do this available for the iPhone and Mac. However, to do this automatically requires that you have a Mac which is always on and connected to the Internet and to iCloud. (Perhaps your iMac would work?)\nOnce you have that, you can install Contacts Sync for Google Gmail (US$4) which will let you sync your contacts, and will keep them in sync for you.\nNote that this is two-way sync between iCloud and Google Contacts, meaning that you can make changes anywhere and have them reflected in both services.\nDisclaimer: while I do own this app, I haven't used it myself recently, so I can't vouch for it personally, but it seems to be well-supported and well-regarded. Make backups of your iCloud and Google Contacts before you use it, and I would recommend frequent checks to make sure that you are not getting a lot of duplicates, etc.\nIf you are going to do this, I recommend:\n1) Download all of your Google Contacts to your iMac from Google.com\n2) Download all of your iCloud Contacts to iMac from iCloud.com\n3) Make backups of those contact files from iCloud and Google (email them to someone, put them on Dropbox, copy them to a USB drive, whatever… just make sure you have more than one copy).\n4) Once you are sure that you have good backups of the contact files from Google and iCloud, delete all of your contacts from iCloud and from Google. Then sync all of your devices so that all of your devices have ZERO contacts on them.\n5) Turn off iCloud syncing of contacts on your iMac (after it’s empty).\n6) Merge your Google Contacts and your iCloud Contacts on your iMac.\n7) Make a backup of your contacts (post-merge, pre-de-duplicating)\n8) Run Contacts Cleaner ($5) which will alert you to duplicates and also to problems that you might face when syncing to Google*. I suggest running this weekly at first, and then at least monthly once you get it running and are confident with it.\n(* = for example: Google Contacts only has one \"name\" field, and iCloud has a \"First Name\" and a \"Last Name\" field. Normally that works OK until you run into contacts with three (or more) names. In my experience, that almost never works well, even when iCloud is just syncing to iCloud, so I tend to put a \"~\" between two of the names. For example, if I had a contact \"Jo Beth Williams\" I would list her as \"Jo~Beth Williams.\" You can use whatever punctuation that you like, but I like ~ because it’s unusual enough that if someone asks about it I can say \"Sorry, I have to do that because computers are dumb, otherwise I end up with your name in my contacts as something like Jo Beth Beth Williams.\" I assume people with such names are used to this happening for most of their lives.)\n9) Keep running Contacts Cleaner until it doesn't find any more problems.\n10) Back a backup of your contacts (post-merge, post-de-duplicating).\n11) Run Contacts Sync for Google Gmail and make sure it is syncing OK.\n12) Once Google sync is running OK, turn iCloud syncing back on\nBut before you do that,, unless there is a specific reason that you have to use iCloud for contacts, there's an easier way: just use Google Contacts and don't use iCloud contacts. You can set this up on your Mac and iOS devices very easily now, as Google themselves describes here. If you decide to do that, I would recommend steps 1-10 as described above, but then:\n11) Select all of your contacts (in the Contacts.app on Mac OS X) and export them to a vCard.\n12) Upload those contacts to Google Contacts.\n13) Delete them from your iMac's Contacts app.\n14) Follow Google's instructions for setting this up on your Mac (essentially: go to Contacts.app » Preferences » Accounts and add your Google Account). Then do the same thing for your iOS devices.\nThe Moral of the Story is this...\nIf you insist on using iCloud and Google, you're entering a world of pain. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon.\niCloud isn't likely to work on Android or Windows [desktop or mobile] any time soon. Google's contacts and calendar work on Android, Windows, iOS, and Mac today. So rather than try to patch together some solution to sync two different systems together, you'd be much better off to just use one everywhere, and the one that you can use everywhere today is Google.\nIf you're not convinced by me, perhaps Lex Friedman's recent Macworld article will convince you: Can't trust this: Inconsistencies shake faith in Apple\n\nA: It's seems like an impossible thing to do without changing any settings.\nSince you can't have contacts sync enabled for Google and iCloud together, you can try to sync on Google only what you need the most on your 2 phones (contacts and/or calendar for example).\nSo you can have Google for your address book and your calendar and you can keep Mail with iCloud.\nHope this helps ! \n", "Q: Is it safe to delete ipsw files? I just updated my iPod Touch to iOS 5.1. During the process, iTunes downloaded a 750MB file: ~/Library/iTunes/iPod Software Updates/iPod4,1_5.1_9B176_Restore.ipsw. I have no use for this file anymore, and it's just using up my limited disk space, so I want to get rid of it.\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will this file ever get deleted automatically, or will it stay there\nindefinitely?\n\n*Is there any GUI command in iTunes that will delete all such files?\n\n*Is it safe to manually delete this file?\n\n*If I manually delete it, will I be able to easily download it again if I ever do need it?\nUpdate: Ipsw files now appear in ~/Library/MobileDevice/Software Images, and they take up 1+ GB.\n\nA: *\n\n*I think that old .ispws will eventually get deleted, depending on the quantity and version.\n\n*I don't think there are any commands\n\n*Yes, it shouldn't harm your computer or device in any way.\n\n*Yes, by using Felix Burns or if you click restore iPhone, let iTunes download the *.ispw, but eject before it can restore (this worked for me once, but I can't be certain, so don't loose all of your data!).\n\n\nA: According to this website, it is recommended to get rid of all the old ipsw's, but to keep the most recent ones.\n\nEvery major iOS update for each type of device synced to your computer is retained. So if you have an iPhone 3G, a second-generation iPod touch, iPhone 4, and an iPad, you'll have all the updates for each of those devices, because the updated content for each device or generation of a device is different. Obviously, this can add up to a large amount of space over time with even a single device. So getting rid of older (but not the most recent) update files can free a lot of space.\n\nFor duplicate iOS versions (e.g. such as betas) usually searching for the build number on Google will let you know which version of the OS it is (e.g. search for 9B176 in the original example).\n", "Q: Why does iphoto only open 4 images in the external editor? I am using Photoshop as the external editor, but when I select a series of photos (more than 4) within iPhoto and choose \"open in external editor\" only the first four of the selected open.

I just want to select (holding control and selecting) different images to then edit outside of the program.\nIs this a setting i can adjust? What possible reason would there be for this limitation?\n\nA: I believe this is to protect against User error - the kind of thing that happens when an inexperienced user doesn't realise that s/he has every photo in their Library selected and then opts to send to the external editor. \nNo, there is no setting to adjust.

I am being offered an iphone 4 but it is locked to orange and I want to use my O2 sim in it. \nThe thing is that I want the phone so I can go into app development and have heard that working with a jailbroken phone can be a problem. \nI have read here that jailbreaking and unlocking are different things but unlocking needs jailbreaking however jailbreaking can be reversed but there's no info on weather that will undo the unlocking so I am really confused :S\nSo can I unlock an iphone and still develop apps with no problems assuming I have a developers licence and update regularly?\n\nA: According to this KB, Orange UK offers authorized unlock, so if the person that is giving you the phone is out of contract, he/she could be able to ask Orange to unlock it. This way you don't have to worry about the whole jailbreaking/unlocking business, if you only care about unlocking. Authorized unlock is like having never locked (factory unlocked) phone and doesn't affect/change the firmware, which is the issue that you are worrying about.\n", "Q: Experience with iphonejailbreakunlock.com My sisters iPhone needs to get unlocked.

We do web applications development and our files and source code is all hosted in-house.\nOur Mac-toting consultants would like to connect to the office to access files (AFP to shared volumes), update source code (subversion over HTTP/HTTPS), and demo software (HTTP through a browser) when they are on a client site.\nTraffic will be light. We are a small company (and cheap), and do not expect more than 3 or 4 people to be connected concurrently. However, we need the solution to be reliable. Many of our clients and consultants are abroad.\nWhich VPN Server Hardware is best for this scenario? I would prefer something that uses standard protocols - I understand that L2TP, PPTP and Cisco IPsec are built in to the OS - so something that uses these protocols will be ideal. (I have seen quite a few VPN solutions that have horrible, buggy, and badly supported client software). An added bonus would be support for iPads as well.\nNaturally, I would like it to not be too expensive (I told you we are cheap), though what I really mean is that I am far more willing to pay for reliability and built-in support, than for features I do not need.\n\nA: Where I work, we use the Junos line of products for VPN connections.  I'm a little light on the details as far as the hardware requirements and the setup costs etc. but we've had very little issues with them.  Some advantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Platform independent\nThe vpn runs in Java (I believe, I never took the time to look really) and can be run on pretty much any platform.  I've tried on Mac and PC, though if you might need Linux you should check into that first.\n\n*Works on iPad\nThis might be a bit more enterprise-y (read: Expensive) than your company is willing to fork over.  In that case, you might look into the built-in Mac OS X VPN.  Mac OS X Server has advertised VPN hosting capabilities which you can apparently use something like iVPN (though if you're technical with the CLI, you can probably get by without it.)  I don't have any on-the-job experience with this as we're a strictly SOHO environment, but it's for sure worth looking into.\nThere are enterprise options out there if your company is looking for a managed solution.  If not, there are options for enterprising individuals willing to put forth the necessary time and effort to make sure it all works.  I've experimented in the past with VPN and, though it was years ago and I'm sure the software has matured, I'd definitely prefer a managed solution.\n\nA: We used a Mac mini with Lion Server in the end. The VPN bit was relatively easy to set up. I followed the instructions at Mac mini CoLo (http://macminicolo.net/lionservervpn)\nWe also set up the same server to act as a DNS server. There is an EXCELLENT tutorial for this at Hoffman Labs (http://labs.hoffmanlabs.com/node/1436)\nL2TP works brilliantly for connection from Mac clients, iPads and iPhones.\n", "Q: How to recover deleted voicemail from iPhone 4S?

Some applications located in /Applications require a password in order to move them to the trash, others don't. Then there are also apps which cannot be deleted because they are required by OS X (a warning pops up).\nUpon further inspection, I've come to the conclusion that Apps installed via the Mac App Store require a password in order to be moved to the trash. Why?\n\nA: This is a permissions effect.  Most Application installed on Lion by default, via the App Store, and some installers are installed as system a.k.a Root and root only by default has Read and Write access to the Applications installed as root, while everyone else including your user is read only or custom for each Application. Applications that you drag and drop are owned by you, and you can delete them at will usually with out a password.\nVerify in the Finder or Terminal what the permissions are on Apps that require a password to move to the trash, its likely that those Apps that are set to read only access for your current user are the ones asking for a password and a temporary privilege to delete something owned by the system. \nIn terminal try:\nls -la /Applications\n\n", "Q: How to print screenshot with \"fit to page\" option?

Without hacking their encryption and storage format, the file cannot be extracted...\nbut if you can make the signature appear on screen, you can capture a screen shot of said signature, and use that file in another application.\n\nA: This solution worked for me using 10.8.2 (mountain lion).\n\nA: *\n\n*Insert your signature in preview on a blank part of a pdf page\n\n*Press Shift+Command+4 to choose image for a screen shot\n\n*Use the + that appears on screen to choose the signature for as your screen shot\n\n*Open the screen shot and export as pdf, save\n\n\nYou now have a pdf of your signature that can be used, for example, in Adobe Acrobat.\n\nA: You can alternatively try to insert your signature in a blank pdf document, crop to take only your signature and then save the document as a PNG file.\nFYI, it's seems that the signature is stored in a .plist file.\nThe file name is \"com.apple.Preview.signatures.plist\" and it's in folder : /Users/YourAccount/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Preferences/\nHope this helps !\n\nA: *\n\n*Open transparent png file with Preview.\n\n*Add your signature.\n\n*Export file as png with Alpha channel.\n\n\nA: Probably easiest just to scan in a new signature into an image file? Or take a photo of it.\n", "Q: Question Regarding Bootcamp and Windows 7 I am possible going to install windows 7 on my iMac using the standard bootcamp setup and have a question about this setup.\nI will store all of my large movies on the mac and will need good access to them, once windows 7 has been installed is it able to access HFS+ partitions at a reasonable speed and more importantly, will i be able to create an SMB share of the folders on the mac through windows?\nThanks for any feedback.\n\nA: I recently installed Windows 7 using BootCamp on my MacBook Pro, Yes, I am able to access all the files on my mac HD.\n", "Q: How can I tell what \"Audio\" and \"Other\" contains in iTunes's iOS device capacity meter? In iTunes, when selecting an iOS device from the left pane, the user is presented with a bar graph along the bottom of the primary pane showing the used space and available space of the given device. \n\nIn this example, the iPad in question contains no songs. My music is all synced through iTunes Match and I have not downloaded any songs (because of my lack of available space). How can I know what that 8.3 GB of audio is? On my iPhone I had assumed it was things like downloaded Audible books, but that can't be the case as Audible's app is not universal, and I haven't installed it on my iPad so there are no Audible books on my device. I do have podcasts synced to my device through iTunes (\"Automatically include all unplayed episodes of all podcasts\"), but the total size of all synced episodes (~2 GB) is far less than the stated use of 8.3 GB.\nAnd what is included in \"Other\"? Is that data that apps use for offline storage (such as Instapaper articles and offline Evernote notebooks)? Or would those items be counted under Apps as they are stored in apps' respective folders on the device?\nHow can I nail down exactly what is using the space on my iOS devices with such ambiguous category names? Secondarily, how are apps' internal storage counted in this graph? For example, the previously stated Instapaper articles, Evernote's offline notebooks: \"Apps\" or \"Other\"? Audible's downloaded audiobooks: \"Apps\", \"Audio\", \"Books\", or \"Other\"? Camera+'s internal photo \"Lightbox\" feature: \"Apps\", \"Photos\", or \"Other\"?\n\nA: The other part of the graph, as far as I know, consists of caches, cookies, history, logs, ... (mostly from safari). Also, things like contacts, calender events, ... are in this part, too. I don't think any app document (like Evernote's or Instapaper's) goes to this part. It's all in the app part. \nSo, for example, it can be cleared up a good amount by going to safari settings and clearing all caches, history, ... You'll be amazed at how much space they've claimed!\nAbout the audio, it is really strange that with no music and some audiobooks, it have taken up so much space. I don't know any other stuff other than that to be included in that part.\nAs a side note, sometimes doing a resync in iTunes will change the graph. Sometimes even the other part shrinks and goes to apps. So maybe you can try and see what happens.\nHope it helps.\n\nA: I've been having the same issue. Here is what I did. Look at iTunes, and make sure Audio is marked \"off\".\nThen, go onto your iPad/iPhone and go to Settings > General > Storage/iCloud Usage > Manage Storage.\nWhen you click on this last stage, it will provide you a list of what is running and what is taking up space.\nI found that I had about 3 GB of podcasts that I had downloaded through the iPad, not through the iTunes Sync.  Once I deleted those, it cleared up immediately in iTunes.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: How can I remove apps from my Default Browsers list and Safari's \"Open Page With\" menu? On my system I have Safari and Chrome installed, and the Develop menu in Safari enabled. In System Preferences (also, Safari's options) I am presented with those browsers as well as the apps Versions, Evernote, and Skitch as available browsers.\n\nVersions, Evernote, and Skitch are not web browsers. How can I remove these extraneous applications from these lists?\nI am currently using OS X 10.7 Lion, but this problem has persisted through version 10.5 and 10.6 as well.\n\nA: Over time, when lots of applications have been installed on a Mac OS X machine, the \"Open With...\" contextual submenu for files has a tendency to grow to quite an uncomfortable length, especially on older machines, which require a long time to generate and draw it. \nOne method of shortening the menu is to simply trash the applications you don't use. However, there are many vital applications that are set to be able to open common file types, such as .txt, .avi and .jpg. For example, how often do you open a JPEG file using QuickTime player or Project Builder? but you wouldn't want to trash those apps, either. The following is a way to avoid having these apps clutter your \"Open With...\" submenu without deleting the apps themselves.\nControl-click (or right-click) the app in question and select \"Show Package Contents\"\nOpen the Contents folder in the app bundle. There you'll find a file called Info.plist. This is an XML property list that stores all sorts of information about the app.\nOpen the file with your favourite text editor. I recommend Hydra, but TextEdit will do just fine.\nSearch for something that looks like the following:\n<key>CFBundleTypeExtensions</key>\n<array>\n      <string>txt</string>\n      <string>srt</string>\n      <string>suffix1</string>\n      <string>suffix2</string>\n  ....\n\nand so forth, with the suffices the app is able to open contained within the tags. Then you simply delete the suffix for items you don't want the app to open.\nSave the file, and close it (or quit the editor).\nThis will prevent them from being listed in the \"Open With...\" menu. The application will still be able to open the relevant file types. However, you will no longer be able to drop files with the suffices in question onto the app directly. \nDirectly from Mac OS X Hints\n", "Q: Is an admin password enough to protect my files? So I'm debating whether or not I should encrypt my MacBook Pro's HDD. Is the account password enough to keep my files safe? If my MacBook got stolen would the thief be able to access the files?\nWould encrypting slow things down significantly?\n\nA: In general, no - setting an admin password is not enough to keep your files safe. If someone has possession of your MBP, it is pretty easy for them to change your account password, and then access any of your unencrypted files. Your keychain is safe, since it cannot be unlocked without the original password.\nFileVault 2 (Full Disk Encryption) does not make much of an impact on speed. If security is a concern, it is worth implementing.\n\nA: Without encryption, yes, a malicious actor with physical access to your machine can easily access your files. Permissions only stop users who are abiding by the rules imposed by the OS.\nFull disk encryption is fast enough to be basically transparent. It does of course have some cost, but if you want to make it difficult for someone with access to your machine to get at your data full disk encryption is your simplest answer.\n\nA: An alternative to full disk encryption is make a new encrypted disk image file with Disk Utility, and keep your sensitive files in it.  While the rest of your files would be still be vulnerable to exposure to someone in possession of your computer or its hard disk, most of us can identify a relatively small subset of files or folders of files that need more protection.  Email, financial data, perhaps your calendar, come to mind; most of the rest of the contents of your ~/Library, the system files, applications your music, virtual hard disks and other non-personal files mostly aren't worth encrypting.  You might not need to open the 'vault' every session if access to those files isn't your primary mission.  \nOf course if you manage/store/transport other people's private information on your machine, it is probably what occupies most of your disk space, and you need the best software and physical security available.\n", "Q: OS X/ iOS Password Managers So I have been reading some articles today and I see the 1Password app coming up a lot. Is there anything special with it? I am currently using Wallet for both OS X and iOS and it does its job quite well. I was just curious because Wallet got 23 reviews while 1Password seems to be a lot more popular.\nIs there anything making that app better than its competitors?\n\nA: 1Password started as OS X-only, so it's more popular among long-time Mac/iOS users. Their Mac/iOS support should (theoretically) be better because it's their original platform.\nThat said, I use LastPass on OS X and iOS (and, occasionally, Windows and WebOS) and I'm quite happy with it. I haven't heard of any one cloud password management being significantly particularly better than its competitors nowadays.\n\nA: Caveat: I'm not familiar with Wallet.\nAfter reading this article, my guess is the reason why users prefer 1Password is because of its browser integration and ability to auto-fill web login forms and the like depending on browser URL. This is one of 1Password's key selling feature.\nEvidently Wallet does have some form of auto-fill, but it only supports Safari. 1Password supports nearly every major Mac browser. Also, according to that article, you have to type in your password every time you visit a new site and need to login. It may be more secure this way, but I'm sure most people prefer to automatically login if they have unlocked their keychain (which of course can be locked after a set period of inactivity.)\nIf I'm reading Wallet's homepage correctly, for device-to-device synchronization, a premium subscription is required. The data is then synched to Moxier's servers. 1Password uses the popular Dropbox (referral link) service for its synchronization, and is therefore free. (A basic Dropbox account includes 2 GB of free space.)\nSo, for those two reasons alone (easy web logins on every browser, free device-to-device synchronization) I would not replace 1Password with Wallet. If you don't require these features, keep on truckin'. \n", "Q: Change Apple ID primary email address Ho can I change my Apple ID primary email address.  I do not have access to the one listed\nI have been through all the support articles but they all tell you to sign on (which I would have to do with the old details and password and then wait for a verification email which of course I cannot do now.  This is not an iCloud related question, I just simply want to change my email address.\nThanks\n\nA: For obvious security reasons, in order to change one's account Email, you need access to that account in the first place. If you don't have access to the email in question (and you can't login) then you are pretty much out of luck. The verification email will go to the new email address to confirm it. \nIn the past few days, Apple added a Google-like mechanism to allow you to access your account in the event of a problem with the primary email. Essentially it allows you to answer three security questions. If you don't or can't access those, then a backup email is provided (and verified) so they can help you recover your account. \nBut… these things must be done before you lose access. \n", "Q: How to select all similar files in an directory If I want to view images I made with my camera using Preview, I have to select all files separately. Because when I select all files (cmd + a) all the videos I made get selected (and opened in Quicktime) too.\nSo I was wondering how I can select only the images in a certain directory?\n\nA: You can use the Search feature in Finder to limit the view in a specific folder to search criteria that matches what's in the search field. One of the criteria you can search on is kind. In the screen shot below I start typing kind:jpeg in the search field and you see that Finder presents me with a drop down list that includes JPEG Image. I select this from the list and I'll see only files of that kind. To limit the filter to just this folder I make sure the Downloads view is clicked on the Search: area just about the list of files instead of This Mac.\nOnce you've searched and filtered your view this way, you can select all to perform an operation on files that match that search.\n\n\nA: If all of the images have the same extension the following command (when run in Terminal.app) will search your directory for files with that specific extension and open them in Preview. \nfind /yourdir -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.jpg' -exec open -a /Applications/Preview.app {} \\;\n\nIf you want to search through multiple directories and not stop at the root directory (in this case \"yourdir\" you can remove the \"-maxdepth 1\" portion.\nIf you want to search for multiple file extensions (jpg and tif) use the following command.\nfind /yourdir -maxdepth 1 -type f \\( -name '*.jpg' -o -name '*.tif' \\) -exec open -a /Applications/Preview.app {} \\;\n\n", "Q: Mysterious second Ethernet stack on my Mac? What are Tun and Tap (ether tap stack) in the startup items folder? Are they legitimate ones used by services like Parallels or HPTrap monitor etc or are they installed to bypass services like Little Snitch? I found them while looking at space hogs on my computer.\n\nA: TUN and TAP are software-based network devices. They're usually created by VPN or ssh-tunnelling applications to handle network address translation or bridge functions from one network to another. They're also used for virtual machine bridging and you'll find them created by VirtualBox if you happen to use it as a VM solution. Possibly Parallels or Fusion might create them as well (though I don't have them on my Fusion-enabled machines).\nFrom this wikipedia entry:\n\nPackets sent by an operating system via a TUN/TAP device are delivered to a user-space program that attaches itself to the device. A user-space program may also pass packets into a TUN/TAP device. In this case TUN/TAP device delivers (or \"injects\") these packets to the operating system network stack thus emulating their reception from an external source.\n\nIf LittleSnitch resides between your ethernet interface and the OS, a TUN/TAP pair won't help route traffic around it. Though it may encrypt it beyond inspection.\nThat wikipedia lists a bunch of legitimate applications that might set up TUN/TAP pairs on your machine but that list by no means exhaustive. The pair might even be present for Little Snitch packet routing and inspection (though, truthfully, I thought Little Snitch just enhanced OS X's default Firewall service, not replaced it...I may be wrong about that though).\nYou can use netstat -nrl to try and ascertain what, if any, routes are being shuffled through the TUN/TAP pair. First do an ifconfig and get the ether value (the MAC address) for the pair, and then look up routes in the table that netstat -nrl returns to see if you can spot either MAC address.\nIf that doesn't work you can use Wireshark to listen on the interface(s) for traffic and see if you can figure out from where and to where it's headed. There's a homebrew recipe for Wireshark to install it:\nbrew install wireshark\n\nIt's a fairly complicated program to use so leave a comment if you need this expanded upon.\n", "Q: Ubiquity process root certificate not valid What are com.apple.ubiquity.... certificates in keychain? I have three of them and the Keychain access warns me that their root certificates are invalid. I previously had little snitch asking me about Ubiquity(ubd process) wanting to connect to configuration.apple.com. Anybody has any ideas about it? There are also other processes like AWACS that try to connect to Apple servers.\n\nA: The certificates are probably self signed certificates that get generated to make each mac unique and avoid sending data in the clear between macs and macs/apple servers performing iCloud services.\n\nAs for the processes you mentioned, these belong to iCloud and back to my mac location services and are part of a normal installation of Lion. You'd need to checksum / verify binaries to be sure you are safe, but the presence of them shouldn't be startling as they are normal processes on Macs.\n", "Q: Is the lock screen PIN secure enough when sending in for repair? The button on my wife's iPhone 4 has become unresponsive and I would like to get it repaired. Like most people, the phone contains important emails, documents and photos which she would not like to fall into the wrong hands (identity theft etc.). Due to convenience I probably wont send it into Apple and will take it to a local repair shop instead (not that I would trust Apple much more). \nWe are not celebrities or big shot executives, so I can't imagine that someone would go to great lengths using special hardware/software. Is the phone's lock screen PIN secure enough to be in the repair shop for a few days? Or can someone take a dump of the phone's contents via the standard USB cable and easily crack it at their leisure.\n\nA: \nIs the phone's lock screen PIN secure enough to be in the repair shop for a few days?\n\nI'd say no. There are forensic-type applications can that extract your phone data without requiring the screen to be unlocked. It's fairly easy to backup and then wipe your phone, and later restore it from that backup. Might as well do it and rest comfortably knowing none of your personal data is in the hands of someone else.\nBesides, you may not get your exact phone back. They may be able to swap it for a new phone or a refurbished phone if they're an Apple Authorized repair depot. In that case your data may be left on your old phone and sent off to a depot for reconditioning.\nWho would want that uncertainty?\nBacking Up Your Phone\nBefore you wipe your phone to send it in make sure you have a backup!\nIf you're using iCloud back up your phone go to Settings -> iCloud -> Storage & Backup and click the Back Up Now button to do a backup.\nIf you're using iTunes to backup your phone connect to iTunes and do a backup.\nWiping Your Phone\nDOUBLE CHECK YOU'VE MADE A RECENT BACKUP!!!\nTo wipe the phone go to: Settings -> General -> Reset and click the Erase All Content and Settings button. This will set you back to factory defaults.\nSend it in for repair.\nRestoring Your Phone\nWhen you get it back it should behave as if it's a new, never used, iPhone. In this case, after you pick your language, you'll be asked if you want to set it up as a new phone, restore it from an iCloud backup or restore it from an iTunes backup.\nSelect Restore from iCloud Backup and follow the prompts if you used iCloud to back up your phone.\nOtherwise select Restore from iTunes Backup and follow the prompts.\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to get the VLC app for iOS now? This app was taken down because of licensing reasons. People have reported that they were able to get the app loaded on new devices such as the new iPad (which was released after this app was removed) because the ipa was saved in their iTunes. \nNow, I don't actually have the app. I did a long time ago on an iTunes installation (on windows) that is long lost in a dusty corner of a partition on one of my many many hard drives. \nMy understanding is that there is some sort of signing that happens where it's impossible to download the .ipa file from some source and get it to run on your iOS device unless you jailbreak and apply AppSync (which basically hacks and bypasses the app verification). \nDoes this mean that I am SOL for being able to watch my collection on my new iPad without either transcoding or streaming? I could settle for streaming but it really makes me sad that awesome software like this has been taken away from us.\n\nA: As you state, VLC has been pulled from the app store because of incompatibility issues between its GNU license and the AppStore DRM.\nIf you have already bought it (even at 0 cost) you can still use it under the same account used to buy it. Because of DRM, apps can not be shared between users, so you can not use an .ipa from other user, just your own.\nIf its your case, VLC is available as a Cydia download for jailbroken devices. Otherwise there are good alternatives for a few bucks. You might wanna check out these:\n\n\n*\n\n*GoodPlayer ($2.99)\n\n*CineXPlayer ($3.99)\n\n\nI've used GoodPlayer and it works as expected, allowing you to play almost anything without reencoding.\n", "Q: Delete swap partition I made a swap partition to install Ubuntu on my MacBook Air 2011, but now I want to clean all the partitions up. However, I can't delete the \"swap partition\" in Disk Utility. Can anyone help me?\n\nA: You should be able to use a tool, such as a GParted Live CD, to delete the swap file partition and resize the OS X partition afterwards.\nPer this Apple discussion forum that covered this topic:\n\nI believe that you can do it with a Live GParted CD. \nhttp://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php\nBoot with the Live CD in the drive and delete the swap partition. You\n  may even be able to resize the OS X partition with GParted afterwards.\n\nAlternately, back up all of your data and applications and wipe/repartition the main drive and install OS X from scratch. Takes a bit longer, but will give you a fresh OS X installation.\n\nA: To delete swap partition go to disk utility. Select that partition, and choose erase from top right. From the the format options choose Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and press erase. This will erase everything on that partition. Now go to Apple SSD (or whatever is the hard drive where this partition is), choose partition. In the partition menu on the left hand side there will be all the partitions, choose the swap partition and press the \"-\" (minus) sign at the bottom. This will delete that partition. Then you can just pull and drag the mac partition to resize it. Hope it helps.\n", "Q: Can I get a new SIM card for iPhone I found? I found an iPhone lying on my table. I called every person I know that was in my house to check if it was theirs. No one said it was theirs. I waited a month later, keeping the iPhone in my drawer. I come back to it and, since nobody's claimed it, I guess it's mine now. It had no SIM card in it. But can I buy a new SIM for this? I have no phone & I'm having this iPhone for the first time. I ask my dad & he tells me I can't buy a SIM card because once I go to the Apple Store & I'll ask to buy a new SIM on the iPhone, they'll think I stole it & report me. When I go to iMessage & try changing the number, it's locked on the number that was on the SIM before it was taken out. What to do? Help! I need to know if it's safe to buy a SIM card. Will they report me?\n\nA: Please bring the phone to an Apple Store and ask them to find the owner. That's the \"right\" thing to do. I'm horrified that anyone on SE would assist you in stealing a phone and/or providing information that would assist someone in using a stolen phone.\n\nA: Go to your local GSM carrier (AT&T in the US) and try to reactivate it. A couple of possible scenarios seem likely:\n\n\n*\n\n*The phone is recent enough to be on a contract - they'd still have the payer on file and you could contact them about giving them the phone back or them cancelling the contract (or you taking it over).\n\n*The phone is free and clear - this is the best case if you want the phone. You'd just get a SIM (contract or pay-as-you-go) and start to use the phone.\n\n*The phone was reported stolen - assuming you didn't steal it, hopefully you get the benefit of the doubt and the owner gets their phone back.\n\n\n(Note: I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice. If you're really worried about the ramifications of the phone possibly having been stolen, you should talk to a lawyer.)\n", "Q: Web Start application management? After the latest update Mac OS X Lion, I think that Apple disabled Java applications by default.

Is there any other way to enable this setting besides trying to launch a Java application (i.e. is there some place to manage this setting)?\n\nA: Use the Java Preferences app (located in the Utilities folder) to manage Java settings (also see this reference).\nGeneral steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to your Utilities folder (either by going to the Applications folder or using the ⇧+⌘+U key combo from Finder)\n\n*Launch the Java Preferences application\n\n*Uncheck the box next to \"Enable applet plug-in and Web Start applications\"\n\n\nScreenshot:\n\n", "Q: How do I move a window to my secondary monitor above the menu bar? I just bought a second monitor which I've placed on a stand above my macbook. It seems to be working great but I can't move any application windows on to it because it's also above the menu bar. Is there a way to be able to move windows above the menu bar to the secondary monitor without having to put the menu bar on it too?\n\nA: I had the same problem with a secondary display that was at a lower resolution than my MBP display. OS X would not let me drag a window above the menu bar UNLESS I resized it so that it was small enough to be entirely contained within the smaller resolution of my secondary display. When I did that, it worked every time.\n\nA: SOLUTION: Move your mouse, while dragging a window, up through the menubar faster. \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences -> Display. \n\n*Select the Arrangement tab, and arrange the secondary monitor so that it sits on top of your MacBook monitor. \n\n\nYou should be able to move your application window up to the secondary monitor now.\nAs mentioned in the comments, if the menu bar is blocking you from moving windows up to your secondary monitor: go to the Arrangement tab and drag the little menubar representation from one screen to the other.

Try again in 22,236,924 minutes.\" I think my son was trying to guess the passcode! What do I do?\nI can't wait 42 years!\n\n\nA: No harm done, that is if you have a backup on iTunes.\nThe Apple Support pages tell you can reset the block by restoring it within iTunes. \n\nIf you cannot remember the passcode, you will need to restore your\n  device using the computer with which you last synced it. This allows\n  you to reset your passcode and resync the data from the device (or\n  restore from a backup). If you restore on a different computer that\n  was never synced with the device, you will be able to unlock the\n  device for use and remove the passcode, but your data will not be\n  present.

I unplugged it and hooked it up to my personal laptop (the computer with the iTunes account that it is synced to) and it let me put in my password to unlock it! :)\n", "Q: How can I email a document from iWork without the recipient seeing the intermediate saved versions? It looks like we don't need to keep different files like on Windows 7:\nspeech 2012 rev 01.doc\nspeech 2012 rev 02.doc\nspeech 2012 rev 03.doc\n\nSo on Lion, we can just use \"Save a version\" and all versions will be there later on to \"revert\" to any version...  The functionality introduced with Lion's \"Save a Version\" is cool, but what if we want to email somebody but don't want the earlier versions to be sent?\nSo are all the old version separate files in the hard drive? (then what if I want to clear those versions out to make space?)   Or are those version embedded within the document?  What if I want to email speech rev final.pages to somebody and don't want to include all the versions then?\n\nA: The versions are not embedded in the files, but instead get stored elsewhere.\nDue to the nature of how Lion stores versions, small files get saved entirely, but larger files can track only the parts of the file that changed in fairly snazzy ways to reduce the chance that some trivial change to a very large file uses more than a trivial amount of version space.\nWhen you mail any file, you don't send the version, just the last saved copy.\nWhen you delete a file, the system checks and cleans out versions so you are generally never going to see a large amount of space tracking files that no longer exist.\nIf you are curious - this terminal command will tell you the sum total of the tracking and storage on your main drive: sudo du -sm /.DocumentRevisions-V100/\nI have yet to see a mac with more than 200 meg of storage here, but post a new question if you ever find a bug or situation where this storage seems out of line.

I am so used to \"Save As\" on the PC, so that for example, if I remember I removed a line two months ago on my resume (also called CV) and now is April 2012, I can go back to\nResume 2012-01-23 revision 02.doc\n\nand then get those text back, and paste it back to my current resume.\nLion's version feature is nice, but how will I go about doing that, without \"undoing\" to earlier versions?  I also like to email a simple version of a Numbers document to a friend (because now it is much more complicated), so how can that be done too?  I guess I am just too used to having multiple files so I feel a bit un-eased at the situation of this transition.\n\nA: Saving versions\nThe first thing to know about Versions is that ⌘ Command+S now means \"Save a Version\". While you're editing the document, your work is automatically saved — but these snapshots are only created when a new version is created. So, rather than Save As, you can Save a Version.\nOf course, versions will be automatically created as well — every hour, I believe, as well as when you open or rename the document — but you can also explicitly save a version whenever you want.\n(You should be cautious about how long these versions stay around, too. I'm finding some information which says that the automatically-saved versions will be pruned to save space, but it's not clear whether the versions you save manually might also be pruned.

When setting up a new iOS device or installing the Messages Beta on OS X, you can log in with your iMessage account to start receiving & sending messages with iMessage.\nOne advantage of iMessage is that these messages are received on all your devices — meaning that as long as you have iMessage configured on a device, you can see the history of a conversation.\nBut as far as I can tell, you can only see messages which have been delivered after you set up your iMessage account on a device. Is there a way to load old messages which were sent/received before setting up iMessage? (I'd like to load both old messages within a current conversation/thread, and old conversations which have not recently received messages.)\n\nA: I just transferred all my chat history by copying ~/Library/Messages from an existing (OSX 10.8) machine to a new one (OSX 10.10).\nCouple of things to note:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Messages on both machines before you do this\n\n*After copying over, delete chat.db-shm and chat.db-wal from ~/Library/Messages on the new machine\n\n*Empty the Trash. I found that there was a process called 'IMDPersistenceAgent' that was holding on to the files I deleted. I killed that process ( sudo kill -9 pid in a terminal). To find out which process (and the pid) is holding on to those files I used the excellent What's Keeping Me. It found the culprit process, but I wasn't able to kill it from within it (and hence had to resort to killing from a terminal).\n\n*Start Messages. Now it might seem that you did not get the history back, but you did!  Try scrolling up for any existing conversations and you will find that the history has been restored.  If you were to start a new conversation with a contact that is not yet visible, you will find the old conversation history is now visible. \n\n\nI am happy with the above and am not too worried about the list of open conversations not being restored as long as the history itself is there.†w\n\nA: Messages app on iDevices and Macs store messages in local storage. To be brief, there is no option to see old messages that sent/received before iMessage setup, because they're not stored somewhere else like iCloud etc.\nYou could see sent/received conversations after setting Messages app up, under ~/Documents/iChats folder (default) in your Mac and change this via Messages app > Preferences > Messages.\nBut, there is an exception here is if you back-up files that are storing your conversations and load them back, you could see older messages.\n\nA: As a small clarifying point, if you have an iCloud iOS backup from your old phone and then you switch to a new phone, as long as your new phone gets the same cell carrier chip as your old one, you will sync in old iMessage messages as well.\nI tried a few times restoring the old iPhone 6s iOS phone backup to a spare iPad and no message history appeared.  But to a new iPhone 6s with the old cell carrier chip inside it, we had what appeared to be a full or or close to full history sync in automatically.\n", "Q: Change the default application (for a file extension) via script/command line? Is there a way to define the default application for a file extension via an Apple script, command line command (like defaults write [...]).\nI know that you can change it manually via the information panel or by using RCDefaultApp but as I have to setup many machines and user accounts I would like to find a way to automate the process.\n\nA: duti is a shell utility that enables using a text file to configure the default applications for file types and URL schemes.\nFor example save a file like this as ~/.duti:\ncom.gnu.Emacs public.plain-text all \ncom.gnu.Emacs public.unix-executable all\norg.videolan.vlc .mkv all\n\nThen run duti ~/.duti.\nYou can install duti with brew install duti or by running wget https://github.com/fitterhappier/duti/archive/duti-1.5.2.tar.gz;tar -xf duti-1.5.2.tar.gz;cd duti-duti-1.5.2;./configure;make;sudo make install.\n\nA: Launch Services is responsible for default file associations.\nLet's say I wanted to change all text files to open in Sublime Text 2.\nFirst I need the kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier for Sublime Text 2.

Trying to read PDF on a mobile screen is a pain, be it iBooks or Adobe Reader. Neither of the apps properly format the content for reading on the iPhone. I was wondering if there is a \"Reader\" feature, similar to Safari's reading feature, on a PDF reading application that with a tap renders the content perfectly viewable on the tiny mobile screen. \nIf there is no such application then I would like to know how I can convert a PDF into any other format that would allow me to format the contents better for viewing on the iPhone.\n\nA: PDF files are popular precisely because the formatting is fixed. A PDF author can be sure that their document looks the same on any device that displays it. So I'm afraid you're asking for a feature that goes against one of the basic premises of the format.\nThat said, some PDFs have a text-only layer that can be displayed directly. On an iPhone, I'd recommend Goodreader for this. It will display the formatted PDF, then you can click to display the text-only version. That version may be bigger and more legible for you.\nHaving a text layer depends on the author of the PDF, but I would think Goodreader may be a step in the right direction for you.\n\nA: I think Kindle for iOS can meet your requirement.\nYou only need to send PDF documents to your Kindle by e-mailing the PDF to to your Send-to-Kindle e-mail address. If you want to convert the PDF to another format，put the word \"convert\" in the subject line.\nIn this way, you can get a better experience to read PDF on the iOS.  \nSend to Kindle just recently came out. It allows you to wirelessly drag and drop files onto your iOS device.\n", "Q: User home folders not detected I have a Macbook Pro running Lion 10.7.3. It has an SSD with 2 partitions: the OS is located in partition 1 and my user home is in partition 2.\nEverything was working fine, but some days ago I had to restart the notebook and now the OS says that it can not access to my user folders, I cannot navigate (via terminal) to the OS folders, like Library and others.\nI've tried many things, including run fsck and Disk Utility's to Repair Permissions but nothing works; what could happened? Suggestions to solve or try?\n\nA: Check in the  \"User & Groups\" System Preferences, it looks like OS X may have somehow forgotten the path to where your \"Home directory:\" is at.\nIf you can still login, verify that your Path is still what you set in System Preferences for your \"Home directory:\" path.\nIf you can't log in, then try logging in as another Admin user to fix your home directory location. \nTry to login as that user and then edit, verify where the OS thinks your home directory is for your primary user account.   \nCreate a new Mac OS X adminstrator account without an existing administrator password might be helpful in your situation, so that you can have another admin account to help you trouble shoot.\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart the computer in Mac OS X single user mode by holding Command-S at startup.\n\n*Mount the computer's drive for read/write access. To do so, type the following command at the command prompt, and then press Enter:\n% mount -uw /\n\n*Remove the file that identifies that the initial run of the \"Mac OS X Setup Assistant\" has been completed, with this command at the command prompt, followed by Enter:\n% rm /var/db/.applesetupdone  #Update on Lion it looks like its .AppleSetupDone\n\n*Restart the computer by entering this command, followed by Enter.\n% reboot\n\n*The Mac OS X Setup Assistant screen should appear after the reboot, just as it does when you start up a brand new computer or upgrade to a new version of Mac OS X.\n\n*Create a new user account with the Setup Assistant. Be sure to name this user something different than the admin user that already exists on the system, and use a strong password (see \"Mac OS X password tips\"). At the end of the Setup Assistant process, the system will automatically log into this new user account. The account will have a unique ID (UID) that is one higher than the last user that was on the system, and will have all administration privileges.\n\n*Log in as the new user, and then edit the \"Home directory:\" Advanced Options path for your primary user.\n\nA: Man, I hate it when that happens, and something similar did happen to me a couple of weeks ago - right after I installed my SSD. If Disk Utility sees that partition, there is hope. What I was told by our local Mac guru was that SSD and partitioning don't work well together.\nThat's not what you want to hear, I know, but you asked for suggestions, so here is what I had to do. Luckily, I had a full backup of everything stored on a server. So it was just a matter of erasing everything on the SSD and then copying the backup file to the SSD. After that, I ran a couple of checks from within Disk Utility, and all was fine.\n", "Q: Is there a way to refresh a Finder file listing? I love my Mac and how things generally just work. Now and again, however, one finds a few annoyances. My latest one is that I cannot find a refresh button anywhere to update a file listing in a Finder window.\nPlease note that I am aware that refreshing is generally not needed as new files are automatically added to Finder windows. In my case I have a NAS on my network, and to update a file listing in a NAS folder I currently need to change directory to somewhere else and then back again to see new files.\nIs there a way to request an updated file listing in a Finder window?\n\nA: To relaunch the Finder:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold the Option key and right-click the Finder icon in the Dock, then select Relaunch.\n\n*Press Option-Command-Escape or choose Force Quit from the Apple menu, then select the Finder and click Relaunch.\n\n*Log out and log back in to your user account.\n\n\nA: Yes!\nA simple AppleScript can instruct the Finder to tell its front window to update every item. Such an AppleScript can be saved as an Application and then dragged to the Finder toolbar to give you a refresh button.\nThe AppleScript you need is quite simple:\n tell application \"Finder\" to tell front window to update every item\n\nPaste the above text in Script Editor (in the Utilities folder), then use Export -> Application. THAT executable should be dragged, with CommandOption, to the Finder toolbar (that is, the top bar, not the sidebar).\nYou can change the icon following this answer.\n\nA: The easiest way to have the Finder refresh its listing is to enter a subfolder and click the back arrow to come back to the original folder. You can also click the back arrow to go to the previous folder, and then the forward arrow.\nThe other way is to use an Applescript as suggested in Daniel's answer.\nUsing osascript, this command can be copy/pasted directly into Terminal, without first creating a script:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to tell front window to update every item'\n\n\nA: I've noticed that changing the view in Finder seems to refresh the content of the Finder window. What I mean by changing the view is going from e.g. Icon view to List. I've not done any extensive testing, but it did the trick for me last night when I copied a file into the NAS box in the Terminal, while the directory I copied the file into was also open in Finder. \n\nA: Disclaimer! - This is not a method to refresh current folder but a method to change folders quickly without having to use mouse or keeping action script open all the time which will eventually refresh the folder view.\nIt is almost as fast as pressing F5 in windows with only one difference - you need two hands.\nFirst way:\nCommand - [ and then ] (no need to release Command, just keep it and press other keys quickly - it's fast!) will go to previous folder and back effectively refreshing your view on current folder - same keys are used in Chrome for back and forward.\nBut sometimes you just opened Finder and there is no folder to go back to. For this case there is:\nSecond way:\nCommand - Up and then Down - will go folder up and then folder down thus coming back to your original folder and refreshing the view. Same as in previous case keep Command down all the time. Same keys can be used in general in Finder to go up and inside folder.\n\nA: If it's a remote server, sometime one has to reconnect to refresh the file list.\n\nA: This worked for me on El Capitan\nhttp://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/24714/refresh-finder\n", "Q: Can I use my Time Capsule with other OSes? I have two Macs at home which use Time Machine to back up to a shared Time Capsule.  Does anybody know of any tools or methods for other operating systems to perhaps make use of that back-up facility?  That is, does anybody know of a Windows or Linux client for a Time Capsule?  (Even if it's a very limited one.)\n\nA: Super highly unlikely you'll find something like Time Machine, as that relies on file-system event logging that was custom made by Apple for Mac OS X.  You can, however, mount the Time Capsule's disk drive as a file share using either AFP or SMB and use any program that will back up files to a file share, which is almost any program that backs up to disk, although beware of possible issues relating to ownership and permissions and unflushed buffers. \nNote that the following setup assumes you are using Airport Utility 5.6 or later but NOT Airport Utility 6.0.  If you are running Lion, 6.0 is installed by default but you can have both installed on your Mac and use both.  You can download Airport Utility 5.6 from Apple. If your are on Snow Leopard or earlier, you probably already have 5.6.  Airport Utility 6.0 is greatly simplified and missing a ton of features that were available in 5.6.\nYou need to explicitly enable File Sharing on the Time Capsule using the AirPort Utility.  From the AirPort Utility, select the Time Capsule, select Manual Setup, click on the Disks tab.  That should present you with the \"Disks\" pane, which should list the disks in and attached to the Time Capsule.  Note that like Disk Utility, the list is hierarchical, with drive partitions listed under drive devices.  My Time Capsule just has the internal drive with one partition.  (Click on the triangle next to \"Time Capsule Disk\" if you don't see a partition name under it.)  Click on the partition name an the right panel changes to show you information about it, including giving you the ability to change its name.  This partition name is the root directory name for the SMB share, so make it short and without spaces. You should avoid hyphens, too, as sometimes hyphens are converted to spaces and sometimes spaces are converted to hyphens and it just gets unnecessarily confusing.  Underscores are OK.\nNow select the File Sharing panel to get to the rest of the configurations you need to set.\nWith Time Capsule firmware version 7.6 and later you have 3 choices for password protection: you can use the same password for file sharing that you use fo Time Capsule, you can use a different password, or you can go all out and set up multiple users, each with their own password (and corresponding ownership and permissions features).  \nYou also want to assign it to a Workgroup if you're using SMB and you want your Linux and Windows machine and the Time Capsule to all be in the same workgroup.  The default workgroup name of \"WORKGROUP\" is the easiest way to go.\nTo authenticate the SMB client for access to the Time Capsule when you have not set up individual users on the Time Capsule, you can use any (non-blank) username (it is ignored) as long as the password is correct.    \n\nA: I would recommend against even trying. I did this myself with a Windows computer a couple of years ago using some undocumented features of Time Capsule that I figured out myself. Then I needed to restore a Mac from my Time Capsule backup and I discovered that I had interfered with the Time Capsule's ability to work with the Mac. I created my own tech-support nightmare. I spent hours on the phone with Apple and got to a senior tech support manager who said, \"That's why what you did is undocumented. The Time Capsule is not designed to support backing up from Windows computers. We don't encourage anybody to try this. You found out the hard way.\"\n", "Q: Is there any way to access Google Tasks on iPhone? How do I access Google Tasks on my iPhone or, even better, sync them with the iPhone's Reminders app?\n\nA: One of the best ways to access Google Tasks is via the webapp. Here is the iPhone version:\n\nAnd the standard basic HTML view:\n\nHope that helps!\n\nA: There is a number of native iPhone apps in the App Store that allow syncing with Google Tasks. They are better than using Google Tasks web site because they all allow offline access, so you don't have to wait for the web site to load.\nIn particular, I recommend the app that I myself wrote - GeeTasks.\nI don't think you will find a way to integrate with Reminders, as there is presently no API published by Apple to access Reminders.\n\nA: You might consider searching the App Store.

How can I transfer them  to the iPhone so that I can do my reading on-the-go?\n(Sure I could simply email them to myself, but I'm looking for a more convenient and less time-wasting solution.)\n\nA: One solution would be to use Dropbox or iCloud to hold/sync your notes and read them with a simple text editing or note taking app. I use Byword.\n\nA: Another solution is using Simplenote, and Notational Velocity.  \nSimplenote also has a web app at simplenoteapp.com.\nThese apps all automatically sync your notes and have great search features.  I've used this for the past couple of years to store all of my notes.  \n\nA: Using Dropbox will be the simplest, free solution. Within the Dropbox app you can view text files. No other app needed. \n\nA: Use Airdrop to send plain text (.txt) file and open in Notes.  This works if you are away from wi-fi for your laptop.\n\nA: You could download an app which allows you to read transfer and read txt files on your iPhone.\nFor me, I use fileapp to read my txt files on my iPhone. Transferring is done via the usb cable.\n\nA: I've tried a couple of solutions, in the end what most solutions lack is readability (each of my notes is \n~1k lines long so being able to easily read them is essential).\nI ended up with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Save the .txt as .pdf.\n\n*Add it to the iTunes library.\n\n*Sync the iTunes library with the iPhone.\n\n*Open using the iBooks App.\n\nA: There are plenty of free text editors you could use but I think the fastest way is to send this notes to your own email and open them from your iPhone.\n", "Q: Enabling Personal Hotspot feature My current carrier does not allow the Personal Hotspot feature for iPhone 4 so this option is missing in the menu. Is there a way I can enable this? I don't mind jailbreaking it. I don't want to use MiWi or any aditional application. I want to use the native one. Thanks\n\nA: Tetherme is an app you can purchase and install on a jailbroken device that will attempt to enable the iOS personal hotspot feature on devices and with carriers that don't support it.\nReports are mixed, some user indicating it doesn't work with their particular configuration, others reporting that some carriers detect this usage and disconnect when the personal hotspot is active.\nWhile you are interested in using the iOS personal hotspot, chances are good that the more reliable method is to use a third party utility.\nHowever, if you must use the iOS personal hotspot feature, tetherme seems to be only available option right now.\n\nA: To enable tethering (aka Personal Hotspot) you need to load a modified \"carrier file\", to do that you'll need what's known as the \"Wortel Commcenter Patch.\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Jailbreak\n\n*Install the Commcenter Patch through Cydia from this repo\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Edit your carrier.plist according to these instructions :\n\n\n\n  \n*\n  \n*browse to /System/Library/Carrier Bundes/your_carrier.bundle/\n  \n*Download your carrier.plist file from your iPhone and save a copy of this original file, just in case.\n  \n*Open the downloaded carrier.plist in your favorite text editor\n  \n*Under APNS->APN look for something with your carriers WAP settings.

For very large apps, such a GPS apps, the app store will decline updating an app if you don't have enough free space.\nHow much free space is needed?\nFor instance, I have a GPS navigation app that is currently using 1.8GB on my iPad.  The update is 1.43GB.  I have 1.9GB free.\nThe update would fit into the free space, but it still doesn't allow it.  Perhaps it downloads it, then installs it before deleting the old one, meaning you'd need twice as much space in order to install it.  It might even require more space if it then copies user data from the old app into the new one before deleting the old one and the installation file.\nHaving as much free space as the app takes isn't enough - so how much is required?  Is 2*update enough, or will I need more free space?\n\nA: Apps are submitted as .ipa files which is really just a zipped container of a .app file. In fact, you can simply unzip a .ipa file to see its true size.\nApps in the App Store are listed by their compressed size, and will need to be uncompressed after installing.\nAs of iOS 6, updates to apps only include files that have been changed. As of iOS 7, updates to apps only include changes to changed files.\nSo, I guess to answer the question directly, for any given app you would need: Free space to store the compressed app update file, free space to store the uncompressed app update file, and space currently being used by the app and all its data/caches.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1779/_index.html\n\nA: From my experience, it can be anywhere from one times to a tad over three times the amount of space that the app claims to take up once installed. I can't confirm this next hypothesis, but it seems to not be linear (the bigger the app, the more times the amount of space you need). For example, I've had times where I've had almost no space left on my device, and I had no problems with updates. I've also had the flip-side occur. Infinity Blade was the culprit. The App Store says it takes 595 MB, and I had 2 GB free on my device, but it wouldn't let me update it, for I needed to \"try deleting some photos or videos.\" I finally ended up getting a little under 2.5 GB of free space before it installed. It most likely depends on the types of files and such, but I've only taken this information from my own observation. Take what you like, but it's worth something.\n", "Q: Is it productive to use a Stylus with the iPad? My son loves drawing comics.  He wants to do it now on my iPad 3.  Does anyone have experience with using a Stylus for such an activity?\nDoes it make sense or will it be an exercise in futility?  I've looked at the Wacom Bamboo and Cosmonaut stylus.  Are either of these (or some other ones) suitable for drawing comics?\n\nA: The Cosmonaut is about the only stylus worth the effort in my opinion. I've tried a few different ones, but the Cosmo' has always felt right. I think it's to do with it's weighting and general sturdy feel.\nI think with practice your son will produce excellent results using the Cosmonaut, especially with the right app (Paper or Sketchbook Pro are excellent for art.)\n--\n'Random' 2yr update: After using the Cosmonaut on and off for the last couple of years, mainly with Paper by 53 and Procreate, I feel a small update is in order. \nI've used the stylus with the iPad 3, iPad 4, iPad mini and iPad Air. I've noticed a gradual loss of effectiveness of the stylus - it feels harder to use resistance-wise than it used to. Could be a change in screen surface technology or just the wear-and-tear you'd expect from using a stylus. So my opinion of this has lessened to a degree. Perhaps Paper's 'Pencil' product will be the one for me, when it's finally available for non-silly money in the UK.\n\nA: The only downside to drawing on the iPad with a stylus is that you have to keep your hand and wrist off the screen, which can become uncomfortable for those artists that still draw with their wrist (which is something one ought to change anyway).  Some apps claim to have wrist protection, but none of them are very good.\nHowever, I know many artists do use the iPad and other tablets for creating art.  They have changed their drawing habits and draw with their whole arm, and use the zoom feature to create detail they would normally create with their wrist touching the drawing surface.\nI am not an artist, but I do enjoy drawing, and I found that a pen size stylus gives me the precision I prefer, and doesn't obscure much of the screen.  I suspect the Cosmonaut would obscure more of the screen, being a thicker tool.  This is something that is up to the user's preference, though - he might prefer a larger grip, or weight.\nBe prepared to test out a dozen or more drawing apps.  I found procreate meets my needs, but I also have several others, and each has merits to recommend it.  \n", "Q: How can I expand the number of special characters I can type using my keyboard? I am aware that when I press ⌥ or ⇧⌥ on my Mac, I can type a variety of special characters. I also know that I can insert special characters using the character palette. Is there a way to expand the number of special characters I can type while using the keyboard? I am particularly interested in solutions that work in Lion and Mountain Lion.\n\nA: If you enable the \"Unicode Hex Input\" keyboard, you can enter any special character, knowing their Unicode code.\nFor example, if I press ⌥, and I click on 2, 2, 0, and 0, while keeping ⌥ pressed, I get ∀ (the FOR ALL Unicode character).\n\n\nA: Custom text entry key bindings\nOS X has a very nice text editing system, which you can extend using Key Bindings. You can, for instance:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up special characters to be entered when you press a certain key command.\n\n*Insert more than one character at once.\n\n*Include navigation commands and change the selection.\n\n*Use multi-stroke key bindings — this is how I type the ⌃⌥⇧⌘ characters.\n\n\nTo set this up, you just create the file ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict and put your customizations there. This article describes the steps in detail.\nHere's a list of the default key bindings, and here's Apple's official guide to the text system and key bindings.\nDiacritics\nIf you're just looking to be able to type more diacritics, and you use a U.S. keyboard, consider using the  U.S. Extended keyboard layout:\n\nThis allows you to type such characters as oòôȯóöơōṯțőo̊ɵỏọţǒŏõǫȏṵṷȍ. You can enable it from the Input Sources section of the Language & Text system preferences.\n\"Press and hold\"\nIn Lion, you can type many special characters by holding down a similar key on your keyboard:\n\n(It turns out this can be customized, if you're up to the task! All it takes is to edit a plist file.)\nArbitrary text substitutions\nIf you have specific phrases or characters you'd like to use, you can also set up custom substitutions for them in the Text section of Language & Text preferences:\n\nCharacter palette\nI guess you already know this, but I'll include it for completeness. If you enable \"Keyboard & Character Viewer\" in the Input Sources section of the Language & Text prefs, you can open the Character Viewer and browse through the entire Unicode character set (and you can also browse characters by category):\n\nThis window is easily accessible in most applications with ⌃+⌘+space (in older versions of OS X, the shortcut was ⌥+⌘+T).\n\nA: In addition to simply using the press-and-hold method included in @jtbandes answer, it is also possible to customise the list of options that you are presented with when you hold down a key.  In the example below I configured the \"Q\" key to show a list of special character codes corresponding to the Mac keyboard:\n\nTo do this, you need to be comfortable editing a plist file.  If you are not sure what a plist file is, this may not be a suitable procedure to follow, just in case you hit problems.\nI used TextWranger, but if you have Xcode you can use Plist Editor, or any other tool that can open and read the plist formatted files.\nThe first step is to navigate to the following location.  You may need to make your Library folder available depending on how you choose to get there:\n/System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/\n\nRight click on this file, and select show package contents, and head on over to ./Contents/Resources/Keyboard-en.plist - choose the keyboard file relevant to your locale if you are using a different keyboard layout.\nI took a copy of this file and dragged it over to my desktop for editing.  Also, for sanity, take a copy of the entire press-and-hold.app bundle in case you ruin everything.  Editing the file, you can see a series of statements that look similar to the following:\n<key>Roman-Accent-a</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>Direction</key>\n    <string>right</string>\n    <key>Keycaps</key>\n    <string>a b á â ä æ ã å ā</string>\n    <key>Strings</key>\n    <string>a b á â ä æ ã å ā</string>\n</dict>\n\nIn the example above, when holding down the lower case 'a' key, you will get the following alternatives.  I included 'b' in the list also.  After making the changes and saving the file, I dragged the file back into the press-and-hold bundle into the correct place, and authorised as administrator to allow the copy to complete.  To make this available, you need to log out/in to reload the plist.  Now just press and hold the key(s) you modified, to see your new list.\nYou can put anything you like in the alternatives list, just leave a space between each one, and don't bother going above 9 entries if you are a keyboard shortcut junkie, as you cannot select one of the alternatives by typing '10' without just getting '1' instead, even though the numbers above 9 still get listed...  Note that as per the above image, you can include unicode characters, emoji, and indeed anything that you can find in the special character palette that is also included in @jtbandes answer\n    <key>Roman-Accent-Q</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>Direction</key>\n    <string>right</string>\n    <key>Keycaps</key>\n    <string>Q ⌃ ⌥ ⇧ ⌘ ⎋ ⏏ ⌫ ↑ ⇡ ↖ ⇞ ⇥</string>\n    <key>Strings</key>\n    <string>Q ⌃ ⌥ ⇧ ⌘ ⎋ ⏏ ⌫ ↑ ⇡ ↖ ⇞ ⇥</string>\n</dict>\n\nFor preference, rather than ammend existing entries, I simply tested keys for ones that had no existing alternatives and made a fresh statement in the plist file for those keys as per above.  But be careful to check for duplicate statements for the same letter, as likely only 1 will work.  Try to keep them in alphabetical order for sanity.\nKeys q/Q/z/Z are good options for fiddling with, having no pre-existing alternatives for that particular locale/keyboard that I used.  This can give you up to 36 'slots' for  creating custom shortcuts to unusual characters.  You can have a set of Emoji, a set of Keyboard characters etc etc on any key you like.  Likely other characters are also currently free of alternatives, and perhaps using a non-alphanumerix key like ` or @ or ¬ or ~ would be a good choice if you are filling the alternatives list with more non alphanumeric characters, but I don't know currently how you would identify them in the plist - would <key>Roman-Accent-~</key> work?  I have no idea, I didn't test that.\nNote, take a copy of the plist somewhere, I have no idea if this will be overwritten on subsequent OS updates etc, and it would be a pain to remember what you did and repeat it next month when 10.7.4 is out etc.\nIt's possible that you can replace with more than a single character also.  I didn't try this either.  But is anyone fancies adding this <kbd></kbd> to the k assignment, I'd be interested to see what happens :)\n\nA: You can design a custom keyboard layout, which will appear in the input source list next to U.S. and Dvorak and Turkish and all that. You can arbitrarily change what character(s) are produced for any key with any combination of modifiers, and multi-character combinations (which in this context are known as “dead keys”, such as Optione which makes acute accents, but can be much more general than that).\nUkelele is a free program for editing keyboard layouts. I use a keyboard layout of my own design, which notably adds dead keys for typing mathematical symbols and Greek letters (without switching to a Greek keyboard layout).\n\nA: I incorporated Stuffe's excellent pop-up key solution into my own workflow (adjusted to include the keys I care about)and am extremely pleased with it. \nSeeking similar functionality on iOS, I also created a set of TextExpander snippets which I can access from my iOS devices or any Mac to which I sync my TextExpander settings. (I currently use DropBox to do so.) This is arguably faster than editing the plist file when I first \"take control\" of a new machine, and is less intrusive on Macs that I'm just borrowing. \nBelow is my list of snippet shortcuts followed by the character (or entity) that it expands to:\n,,via   ᔥ\n,,ht    ↬\n,,kb   <kbd>%|</kbd>\n,,cmd   ⌘\n,,alt   ⌥\n,,opt   ⌥\n,,ctl   ⌃\n,,esc   ⎋\n\n\nA: There are some important gotchas with the other solutions posted here. I’ll explain them, and offer an alternate solution that avoids these issues.\nFor one, symbol and text substitution entries only work in Cocoa apps. If you want a truly system-wide solution that works in all applications, this is not an option.\nAlso, apps like KeyRemap4MacBook are great, but relying on them means you have to keep the app running in the background all the time, which may not be what you want.\nCustom keyboard layouts to the rescue\nLuckily, remapping keys can be done in a way that will work for any type of application, and without any additional software!\nMac OS X has supported .keylayout files since version 10.2 (Jaguar). You can create your own keyboard layout, or rather, tweak the default one you’re using right now. Simply remap a keyboard combination you never use (for me, there are plenty of those) to the ² and ³ symbols, and that’s it. \nIn my custom QWERTY keyboard layout, I can simply press ⌥ + ⇧ + 2 to enter ², and ⌥ + ⇧ + 3 to enter 3. (My custom AZERTY layout has these mappings, too.)\nHow to create a custom keyboard layout\nTo create new keyboard layouts or modify existing ones, I’d recommend Ukelele.app. It has an option to create a new keyboard layout based on the one that’s currently in use.\nAfter you’ve created your custom layout, there’s no need for the application anymore — you certainly don’t need to keep it running in the background.\nHow to install a custom keyboard layout\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the .keylayout file to the Keyboard Layouts folder within ~/Library (if you want to install it only for the current user) or /Library (if you want to install the layout system-wide).\n\n*Reboot (if you installed the layout system-wide), or log out and log in again (if you installed it for the current user only).\n\n*Enable the new keyboard layout via System Preferences › Language & Text › Input Sources.\n\n\nHow to make a custom keyboard layout the system default\nOptionally, you could make the custom keyboard layout the system default by running the Setup Assistant with root privileges. This way, it will be used for the login screen, and any new user accounts you create will default to this layout as well. Note that this can only be done for keyboard layouts in /Library/Keyboard Layouts (i.e., layouts that have been installed system-wide).\nsudo rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone; sudo \"/System/Library/CoreServices/Setup Assistant.app/Contents/MacOS/Setup Assistant\"\n\nYou will have to create a new user account in order to complete the Setup Assistant — but don’t worry, you can delete the new account afterwards.\nAdding a custom icon to the keyboard layout\nOS X will use the following default icon for your custom keyboard layout:\n\nThis icon will show up in the preference pane, and in the “Input menu” in the menu bar.\nTo replace this with your own icon, create a 16×16px image, and save it in .icns format in the same directory as the keyboard layout itself, using the same file name (only the extension differs). For example, my custom QWERTY layout is named qwerty.keylayout, so if I wanted to use a custom icon, it’d have to be named qwerty.icns.\n\nA: SOME IMPORTANT KEYS:\n\n\n*\n\n*⇪ Capslock\n\n*⇧ Shift\n\n*⌃ Control(this is the one you are looking for)\n\n*⌥ Option (Alt, Alternative)\n\n*⌘ Command\n\n*␣ Space\n\n*⏎ Return\n\n*↩ Return\n\n*⌫ Delete back\n\n*⌦ Delete forward\n\n*⇱ Home\n\n*↖ Home\n\n*↸ Home\n\n*⇲ End\n\n*↘ End\n\n*⇞ Pageup\n\n*⇟ Pagedown\n\n*↑ Up arrow\n\n*⇡ Up arrow\n\n*↓ Down arrow\n\n*⇣ Down arrow\n\n*← Left arrow\n\n*⇠ Left arrow\n\n*→ Right arrow\n\n*⇢ Right arrow\n\n*⌧ Clear\n\n*⇭ Numberlock\n\n*⌤ Enter\n\n*⏏ Eject\n\n*⌽ Power\n\n*⎋ Escape\n\n*⇥ Tab forward\n\n*⇤ Tab back\n\n", "Q: What causes \"The Finder can't quit because some operations are still in progress\" error message? I am receiving this message when I'm trying to shut down my computer and I don't have any Finder windows open. What could be causing this message and how do I fix it so that I don't have to perform a hard shutdown?\n\nA: Here's another way to Force Quit an application:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the Apple Menu \n\n*Hold Shift, and notice that the 'Force Quit...'\nmenu item has changed to 'Force Quit [frontmost app name].' \n\n*Select 'Force Quit [frontmost app name]' to force quit the Application.\n\n\nA: It usually happens when it's trying to synchronize or back-up IOS devices.

Twitter won't allow me to reset, but the Twitter app on my iPhone still has access.\nThere has to be a way to access the iOS Keychain. Can someone point me in the right direction?\nThanks!\n\nA: Your Twitter app should not actually have your password stored on your iOS device.  Rather it should have a security token, specifically an OAuth access token.  \nHave you tried resetting your password via SMS?\n\nA: I don't know if the app in question stores the password in retrievable form in the keychain, but with iOS 7, you can enable keychain sync on iOS and have that information synced through iCloud to a Mac running Mavericks.\nFrom there, you can inspect the iCloud keychain contents just like any other OS X keychain and obtain clear text password as well as any other data stored in the keychain entry.\n", "Q: How do I get the Unicode code of a character from the Character Viewer?

I just found out today that Google is opening a cloud storage engine (a potential competitor to iCloud) called Google Drive, and I was wondering if there might be some way to backup your iOS device to it, short of jailbreaking it.\n\nA: I wouldn't call Google Drive an iCloud competitor. Google Drive (like Dropbox) is your hard drive on the Internet. Meaning you can see, and manipulate your files.\niCloud is a bit different, for starter, it's an Apple-centric service, you can backup your iOS devices, store your music (but only access it with iTunes), store your (iCloud) mail, calendar, reminders and contacts, and let apps store settings on it.  \nBut you can't access it directly like you would do with Dropbox or Google Drive.\n\nSo I would say that you will not be able to use Google Drive to back up your iOS devices as easily as you would do with iCloud.\n\nA: Google have announced that there will be an iOS client for Google Drive, however it has not launched with one.\nReports that it will be quite soon from the Verge\n\nA: Backing up to google drive will definitely not be possible on a non jail broken iPhone. Apps can only read and write data in their own little sandbox, they cant access data from other apps (there are ways to explicitly share data between apps but this requires both apps active participation) \nSo the client will only allow reading files already the drive and uploading files that you specifically choose. \nIt's preferable to use iCloud anyway as the integration is very deep. You can restore your iPhone directly from iCloud and it will backup automatically. \n\nA: This should be possible in using third party apps. Allthough only indirectly. You can use those iPod, iPhone backup apps to save the iOS content on the PC and upload the files to Google Drive. Some of those apps are presented here: http://en.kioskea.net/faq/9463-comparison-of-ipod-iphone-ipad-backup-software\n", "Q: Set up flash drive with multiple OS X Installers Working in a tech shop, and being an Apple fan, I deal with ALL the Apple-related products. I'm seeing products from 10.4 to 10.7, and I have made a bootable flash drive from 10.6 (since it's the most popular). I have the disks (and a disk image for 10.7) for each of these that we will use if the OS ever needs reloading. Is it possible to put a disk image of all these disks onto a flash drive so when we boot with the single flash drive, it asks which OS X version to install?\n\nA: I have an external hard drive with several installers on it. All you need to do is make several partitions, each large enough for the disc you're imaging. (My drive has 10.4 Tiger PPC, 10.5 Leopard PPC, 10.5 Leopard Intel, and 1.6 Snow Leopard on it, and I have a Lion USB flash drive.)\nI made the images using Disk Utility's Restore feature. Select the source disc (in the optical drive), choose the \"Restore\" tab, and make sure the selected disc is in the \"Source:\" field. Drag the intended destination partition to the \"Destination:\" field, hit the \"Restore\" button, and wait.\nThere are several caveats to keep in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*A FireWire disk is preferred to a USB disk, as not all Macs can boot (or boot easily) from USB. \n\n*Pay attention to the partition scheme on your hard drive: PowerPC Macs boot from Apple Partition Map and Intel Macs can boot from APM and GUID, so APM is preferred if you intend to repair PowerPC machines. You might want to have two drives, one for PPC and one for Intel Macs.\n\n\nOne good thing about having the installers on a drive is that hard drives are much faster than optical discs.\n", "Q: Is it okay to stack an Airport Extreme on top of a Mac mini? Is it ok to place an AirPort Extreme base station on top of a Mac mini, or could this cause problems (like overheating or interference) with either device?\n\nAs depicted, they do fit together pretty well...\n\nA: If I had to do it, I'd stack them with some kind of spacers to allow some air circulation between them.\n\nA: Stacking is not recommended. According to the Mac Mini user guide it is not recommended to place anything on a top of a Mac Mini, since its can interfere with the Mac Mini's Antennas for Wifi, Bluetooth and optical drive operation. Additionally, since that area kind of gets hot on my Mac Mini Late 2009, its probably not a good idea to cover it, since the Mini would be adding heat directly to the bottom of the Airport Base Station as well, and it does not have fans to keep it cool. \nAs noted in Mac Mini Late 2009 User Guide\n\nImportant:  Don’t place anything on top of your Mac mini. Objects placed on top may interfere with the optical drive or the AirPort or Bluetooth®\n   wireless signal.\n\nIn your case a stacking solution (pictured below) might be the safest way to save space and keep your hardware on the safe side to the written letter in the book. But if your careful and things are not interfering and things are not getting too hot, stacking might be OK, contact Apple to be certain. \nAlso consider moving your Airport Extreme to another location, it might help avoid sources of wireless interference at your desk, eg monitor, computer, speakers, cell phones, etc. You might be able to mount the Airport Extreme behind your desk or to a nearby wall behind your desk to get it out of the way and reduce the need to stack things.\n\n\nA: I advise you to avoid to put your\nExtreme AirPort Base station on top of the MacMini, because the top of\nthe Mac mini is a wireless reflector (cases of hard disk and optical drive are flat metal surfaces).\nIn the field of wireless network you should imagine each wireless card\nas a bulb light. To have a smoothly working wireless network, all these\nbulb lights should be placed apart from each others. You should avoid to place them against a reflecting surface (flat piece of metal, a window,\na concrete wall, on a glass table…) or behind an opaque object (metal, glass, concrete, us i.e. humans…) who will create shadows.\nWhen you place a wireless antenna directly against a reflecting surface it will suffer of interferences reflected by this surface (the direct field and the reflected one are using the same carrier wave and they fully interfere\nwith each other).\nIf you would like to learn more about this interference problem, I advise\nyou to install iStumbler on a portable Mac and to compare the\nsignal & noise columns (on iStumbler) when:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your Extreme AirPort Base station is on top of your MacMini,\n\n*Your Extreme AirPort Base station is at the other end of the room,\n\n*Both are using the same 802.11g channel (for example the famous 1),\n\n*Your Extreme AirPort Base station is on the 802.11g channel 9, and\nyour MacMini is on the 802.11n channel 64.\n\n\nA: I would DEFINITELY advise you to put your Mac Mini beside the AirPort Extreme Homebase. It's a very delicate product that has a hard disk, and the AirPort Extreme has magnets.

I'm running the latest version of lion.  This happens fairly frequently as well.\nTo clarify, the cpu is mostly idle.\n\nA: 1.5 is not a high load, especially on a multi-core machine.  Fan can be on overdrive because of a faulty temperature sensor or blocked airflow or things like that.  Using a laptop in bed and resting it on a down comforter, for example, can send the fan into overdrive.  Also, the GPU (video card) can generate more heat than the CPU and won't show up in load metrics at all.  Are you doing something graphics intensive, like editing video or playing video games? \n\nA: Aside from physical issues that Old Pro addressed, it's possible that you're using a program which isn't multithreaded.  Mac OS swaps active cores for any given process intermittently, but if the program is queued up for the foreseeable future, it will run as close to 100% as possible.  This can cause the CPU die to heat up and the ~1 load.  If you're noticing significant disk usage, it's likely that this is the case.\nTo further diagnose your issue, try using Activity Monitor to see which processes are using the most CPU.  You can also diagnose disk usage here.\n\nA: Do you plug in, wake from sleep, go back to sleep and unplug often? You might need to reset your SMC. I've been having similar issues, but with little to know load and I think it's due to my SMC. I wonder if this discussion will help you: High fan speed and CPU temp with low CPU usage?\n", "Q: Reinstall or Time Machine? How do I get back up and running? I just got an SSD for my White Unibody MacBook. What's the fastest way to get back up on running on 10.7.3 with a Time Machine backup (on an external disk via usb 2.0) and a Lion 10.7.0 DVD?\nCan I restore directly from backup? Do I need to install 10.7.0 first? Do I need to run System Update after that, or will migration assistant install the patches for me?\n\nA: A SuperDuper clone will be easy and will move your exact setup to the SSD. Put the new SSD in an external USB drive, format  the SSD in Disk Utility, and clone the boot drive onto it. You don't need to purchase SuperDuper as the Erase then Copy option works in the unregistered version. \nIf your current boot drive data takes up more space than the SSD can hold then you need to delete files to slim it down or use a custom script in SuperDuper to exclude what you don't want transferred. \nAfter the clone is successful boot the computer with option held down and make sure you can boot from it. If that works shut it down and swap the drives. \n\nA: Your options depend on what else you have available.  If all you have are a blank SSD, a USB drive holding a Time Machine backup, and a Lion DVD, then your only option is install the SSD, boot off the Lion DVD, and restore the now-internal SSD from the Time Machine backup.   You do not need to install Lion on the SSD first as long as the Time Machine backup is from the same computer you are restoring to.  (If it is a different machine there can be issues with drivers and UUIDs.)\nIf you have a working internal drive already and you want to clone it, you might want to invest in an external drive case (preferably one that has both Firewire and USB interfaces) and put the SSD in that, then use Carbon Copy Cloner (free to use, payment requested if you feel it is worth it) to clone the drive.  I think the external case is a good investment because after you clone the drive, you put the SSD in your laptop and the old internal drive in the external case and you have 2 usable drives.  \n", "Q: Is it possible to show a screensaver on a secondary monitor while using the primary monitor? I have an iMac with a large format display set up as a secondary monitor that we use as a television for watching movies.  When I am just using the iMac, I would like for the secondary display to display something interesting rather than just the wallpaper.\nIs it possible to set up a screensaver that appears on the second monitor (I really like the iPhoto slideshow) while allowing me to use the primary iMac monitor?\nI would even be happy if it wasn't technically a screen saver, but just any sort of slideshow that could be displayed on one monitor while I work on the other.  Currently if I play a slideshow in iPhoto, the other monitor goes blank. :(\n\nA: You can set your screensaver to be your desktop background (link to source).\nTo do so, run this in the Terminal:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine -background\n\nThis works on both monitors (tested just now in Lion), so as long as you don't put any windows on the other monitor, it'll just show the screensaver. (Unfortunately, the screensaver will also be behind all of your windows on the screen you're using. I hope you really like your screensaver.)\n\nA: The easiest solution is the widget Wallify.  It is free, with a \"Pro\" version available, but the free version basically does the same thing that CajunLuke suggested, but without having to use the Terminal.\nYou can select most of your screen savers directly from the menu on the widget, but specific photo slide-show style screensavers don't appear as an option.  To use these kinds of screensavers, you can choose them using the System Preferences > Desktop & Screen Saver, then on Wallify just select \"Default\", and it will use whatever you chose in System Preferences.\n\nA: You may want to try RandomExtra.screensaver This screensaver allows you to select a specific screensaver for multiple monitors. Following the very simple install notes, you can have this screensaver installed in seconds. Once installed open your System Preferences and go into your \"Desktop & Screen Saver\" pane. Find the newly installed \"RandomExtra\" Screen Saver and click on options. Once inside the Screen Saver options choose the \"Extra\" tab and you will find some options for what you may be wanting to do.\n\nA: Maybe another solution is to use software that manages multiple monitors like UltraMon, Multimon, DisplayFusion.\n\nA: I think I found a simpler solution. Go to Desktop and Screen saver in Settings and at the bottom of the window for the second screen pick a folder and checkmark \"Change picture\". For us the \"every 5 seconds\" works wonderfully with a great cross-fade.\nThis is in 10.7. Hope this helps.\nNick\n\nA: I found another thread that discusses this same problem and which has some additional solutions:\nhttps://forums.macrumors.com/threads/screensaver-on-external-monitor-only.282371/\nI hope this helps.\n", "Q: Save multiple photos from Mail on iPhone I send a lot of emails to myself from my Mac to my iPhone containing logos that I am designing, normal pictures or otherwise.

I've painstakingly edited audio from two separate tracks with my video in iMovie 2011. Now I want to trim the audio+video in certain areas. However, all I am able to do is select a portion of video, and delete it -- but the audio remains unchanged, so now audio is out of sync with video.\nThere seems to be no way to \"merge\" the audio back together with the video, or \"link\" them somehow, before trying to edit.\nNext I thought maybe I can import into Final Cut Pro X and have more control. So I imported it, but it brings everything in EXCEPT all of the edits I made to the audio levels in iMovie.\nNow the only thing I can figure to do is to export the iMovie project as a video (in Apple Intermediate Codec?) and then re-import that back into iMovie as a new project, where I will then perform my video edits. But this seems hacky and probably would result in a loss of quality, right?\n\nA: The workaround I came up with was to go ahead and import the iMovie project into Final Cut Pro X, and then export the project from iMovie as a movie file with high quality audio. \nThen I imported the exported movie into FCP, detached the audio, and then delete that video clip. That left me with the better sound track from the exported movie file, with the original video quality from the iMovie project.\n", "Q: Dropbox-like client for Macs to access existing FTP/WebDAV/CMIS storage We have many users on Macs that access their files on one big non-Mac server that supports FTP/WebDAV/CMIS.\nPROBLEM: They can not use their files while not connected to the Internet.\nQUESTION: Is there a Dropbox-like software for FTP? or WebDAV? or CMIS?\n\n\n*\n\n*When connected, pushes local changes to the server\n\n*When connected, polls the server every n minutes to pull changes\n\n*Preferably open source\n\n*Dropbox-like UI: Tray icon, minimal configuration dialog, maybe green check in Finder to show which files are synchronized.\n\n*Starts automatically at boot or login\n\n\nJust to make it clear: I am not looking for an online hosting service. I have an existing server and there are no plan to move any data to any cloud. I am looking for a client-side software that can synchronize local files with the server when connected to the network.\n\n\n*\n\n*FTPbox is nearly perfect and open source, but it has not been ported to Mac yet.\n\n*GoodSync does not work in the background (requires user click) so it is a no-go.\n\n\nI was asked to add a short section describing why DropBox is not a solution: 1) Documents are confidential, third-party is not an option 2) Dropbox is not reliable enough (better uptime/SLA is needed) 3) Dropbox becomes crazily expensive for large scale 4) The FTP/WebDAV/CMIS interface is actually provided by \"Alfresco\", an enterprise document management system which has many other features (not just file transfer), and is integrated with other critical enterprise systems. So my question is really about client-side only.\n\nA: You may want to look into the following open source applications:\n\n\n*\n\n*FTPSync\na Perl script to synchronize a local directory tree and a remote FTP directory tree.\n\n*ownCloud\nWeb services under your control. \nCurrent features: file management, WebDAV access, share via public link, music streaming, users & groups, OpenID, LDAP\nIn development: sharing, encryption, calendar, contacts, etc., desktop sync client, Android & webOS apps, server-server sync\nNOTE: You do not have to utilize their storage.\n\nA: CmisSync is just like Dropbox, and syncs with any CMIS-compatible server:\nSharePoint, Documentum, FileNet, Alfresco, Nuxeo, DocuShare, Oracle, Lotus, SAP, Windchill, etc.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Syncs both up and down\n\n*File stay accessible when offline\n\n*Conflicts are handled like in Dropbox\n\n\nOpen Source.\nDisclaimer: I wrote CmisSync as a fork of SparkleShare, the tool mentioned in Patrick's answer which unfortunately supports only the Git protocol.\n\nA: You can try IQ Uploader.com. For disclosure, I am the main developer working on this project.\nIt does exactly what you describe, and provides FTP sync for MacOs and Windows. It also uses FTP-SSL/TLS by default. It syncs local changes in real-time.\nWe just released a very usable Mac alpha that you can download. The official Mac beta will be released by the end of 2014.\n\nA: I had a similar requirement when trying to work with files on a remote FTP-Server from several clients. For me the best working solution on OS 10.11.4 is Fuse for OS X together with MacFusion. \nThe first one can be found on sourceforge: \nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/osxfuse/files/\nFuse is the \"background-package\" which basically extends OS X-file-system-capabilities. (Some older tutorials point to MacFuse, which is, from my understanding, an older version that is not supported anymore.)\nMacFusion is kind of an UI for Fuse. Basically, you don't need to know more than your credentials to access your FTP-Server. Here I found a (quite old) tutorial with screenshots from an older MacFusion-Version, that still works, anyways:\nhttp://www.simplehelp.net/2008/07/25/how-to-mount-a-remote-file-system-as-a-local-drive-in-os-x/\nhth\n\nA: Interarchy sounds like it can do what you want.  It came to my attention in the context of an iDisk replacement which can keep files backed up on a server, sync folders, share files, etc.  I haven't used it myself - I'm reporting what I've read - but it sounds like a likely candidate.\n\nA: Goodsync can be set up for automatic syncing. I just started using it a week ago. I have some folders set up to sync automatically on file change like DropBox and some to sync periodically like Time Machine, every x hours. It also syncs my ereader when I connect it to my mac. Some sync jobs are two-way some just one way, without a deep analyze, just automatically transfers everything.\nI choose it because it's WebDav transfer speed was many times faster than anything else tried so far (Finder and Transmit).\n\nA: git-annex Assistant is close to what you ask for:\n\n\n*\n\n*it's dropbox-like;\n\n*it's free (= libre) software, i.e. you must be able to host it on your own, and adapt it.\n\n\nWhat it is missing (at least, now):\n\n\n*\n\n*the protocols are not the ones that you want (although there might be some ways to integrate it with WebDAV -- http://git-annex.branchable.com/ikiwiki.cgi?P=webdav);\n\n*it's in development stage.\n\n\nA: Have you tried out sparkleShare? http://sparkleshare.org/\n", "Q: Is anybody else experiencing disappearing source files when using Xcode 4? I've been having a weird problem on a MacBook Pro; My source files disappear. It can happen when the files are not open in any application (although they are referenced by active projects in Xcode and the compilers are reading them…). I can start a long build, walk away, and along the way the compiler complains that it cannot find an #include at some point in the build (the file's disappeared at that point). I then revert from git history. Fortunately, I've not lost any data (yet!), but it's quite an annoying issue. I do use git clients (specifically, SmartGit and SourceTree), but the problem appears unrelated to these clients because I can work with either for extended periods and the problem still arises. As far as I know, other files have not been disappearing from this machine, but I use it almost exclusively for development. And maybe it's not at all related to Xcode…\nHas anybody else had a similar problem, or is this a confirmed issue? …and is there a solution?\n\nA: I'm having the same issue.

I flipped back to my project and half the files were gone.  Luckily the 4 files I had been working in were still there, but I had another project open at the same time, and I lost everything there but the project file.

I have been an iOS developer for quite some time now, and I am still using Xcode 4.2, because the new version is now only available for Lion.

Is there any possible way to avoid this?.\nI currently own a 17\" MacBook Pro with a Core i5 at 2.53 GHz and 4 GB RAM it runs Snow Leopard great, but I am afraid it will have problems with Lion, not only because of the hardware, but because it seems to be full of bugs and is just slower overall.\nI suppose I could install both Snow Leopard and Lion?. Any workaround is welcome.\n\nA: You really can't. Unless you skip to Mountain Lion. It's one of the blessings and curses of being an Apple Developer and that is that you must stay current, or you're out of the game for both iOS and Mac Development. \nTo use the latest bells and whistles for the next OS releases, you are really going to be bound to Apple's software and hardware requirements for those tools, otherwise you will find yourself spending too much time hacking together your build tools, instead of making forward progress.\n\nA: Get yourself a copy of VMware Fusion and run your various development OS virtually.

I like the basic idea of Appsfire Deals: tag applications you're interested in, get a push notification when they're offered with a discount. But I don't like that the app frequently notifies me of promotions for apps I did not tag. (I already turned off the “Daily Recommendations” in the app's push notification settings, the only other option offered there is to turn off push notifications completely.) Is there an alternative to Appsfire Deals which limits its push notifications to apps you're actually interested in?\n\nA: There is for example AppShopper. To use the notification feature (called \"wishlist\") you have to create a free AppShopper account.\nI'm using it for a while and don't get any spam.\n\nA: We understood your feedback about the notifications and Appfire Deals will offer additional configuration options very soon.\nNote also that promoting apps helps us to finance our work.

I'm used the app Global.AQ Lite on my iPhone to send an anonymous text message.\nI used my home Wi-Fi network while sending the text, and I used fake Global.AQ account details. I now have a different account logged-in on Global.AQ.\nCan the recipient find me? If so, how?\n\nA: The answer is yes and no. She can not find you. The police ultimatively can track you down but its taking a lot of time and effort which might not be worth doing so. \nThe procedure would be:\na) The police opens up a criminal case\nb) the police identifies the sending number\nc) the police identifies the sending SMSC\nd) the police ask the prosecution of the country of the sending SMSC who the sender was. This will most probably track back to a SMS aggregator. Going up the chain they will end up on Global.AQ provider.\ne) The police of Switzerland would have to hand over a court order to the Global.AQ provider (Fink Consulting GmbH in Switzerland) to hand over the identity data of the person who sent the message. A court order is required by law. The laws of data protection and the laws of telecommunications in Switzerland prohibit to give out any information about any telecommunications occuring or their contents to anybody. This is the case in most countries but some countries, such as the US give that information to the FBI or CIA without a blink of an eye. This is not the case in switzerland however where the rule of law is followed strictly in those matters.  Any information of the content of the communication is only available to the police in case of serious crimes. The information on who is the owner of the number is however not restricted to the serious crimes.\nf) The identity data would include your e-mail address used at signup, your name etc. which you used to sign up and the IP address. All of which could be hidden/faked to some extent.\ng) the IP address then can be tracked down to the mobile phone operator or Wifi access point from where the message was sent.\nh) the police now could know you and could prove you sent the message and could go after you.\nAll this would probably not happen if you are just a bit rude to a person. If you threaten to kill someone however such things can happen quite fast as life is considered in danger. It's also a question on if the police does want to do the effort of all this for a simple case of one time stalking.\nSo far the above procedure has happened only once in the lifetime of Global.AQ where someone was making a joke of placing a bomb. The receiver however has not considered this as being a joke but has taken it for granted and launched a chain reaction in police work.\nMy recommendation: be polite to people avoids the problem in the first place. It doesn't help to piss people off. It might fire back on you some day. Maybe in 20 years when you apply for your dream job but the HR manager of that company is the person you insulted and the person remembers it. In other words it never pays off to be evil.\nHope this answers your question\nAndreas Fink\nDeveloper of Global.AQ\n", "Q: Trackpad gets stuck in select mode I'm experiencing the problems \ndescribed here, basically the trackpad has spurts of spurious input, but the problems are fairly intermittent.

When I add the system preferences to the dock and click it, it opens in the common view.\nHow can I open a specific pane at once from the dock?\n\n\nA: If it's a particular pane you want then you can use AppleScript to do this. For example, start the AppleScript Editor and type the following:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    activate\n    set current pane to pane \"com.apple.preference.startupdisk\"\nend tell\n\nThis will open the Startup Disk preference pane com.apple.preference.startupdisk, but the other panes follow the same naming convention, e.g. com.apple.preference.dock etc. \nYou can now save this an application:\n\nThen drag the .app file you created to the Dock. When you double-click it, it will open the required preference pane. \n\nA: *\n\n*In Finder, open /System/Library/PreferencePanes on Lion for the system preference panes or /Library/PreferencePanes or ~/Library/PreferencePanes/ for user-added ones.\n\n*Drag the icon of your choice from the folder to the Dock. It will probably only go on the right side (the documents/folders/minimized windows/Trash side) of the divider.\n\n\nClicking the new icon will open System Preferences directly to that preference pane.\n\nA: If System Preferences is running, the Dock menu has a list of all available preference panes. If it's not running, they aren't in the menu because apps on OS X can't keep stuff in the Dock when they're not running. \nFor easy access to a specific preference pane, use Spotlight or a third-party launcher.\n\nA: I see this is an old post, but at OS X.7 (Lion) and X.8 (Mountain Lion), at least, show the full list by just clicking and HOLDING on the System Preferences icon in the Dock.\n\nA: The accepted answer is good but it doesn't behave like a native app's icon would on the Dock.\nThe AppleScript answer is good but it relies on knowing the magic string for com.apple.preference.* and also relies on opening the System Preferences app first (and loading info about all the panes) and then opening the desired pane, rather than just opening the desired pane (and not opening the main app first).\nI combined them into one that resolves all three issues. (on macOS Monterey, but it should apply to any version of macOS people are reasonably running today)\n\n*\n\n*Figure out which preference pane you want launched by opening /System/Library/PreferencePanes in Finder (we'll use StartupDisk.prefPane for this example)\n\n*Open Automator and create a new Application\n\n*Add a single step: Run Shell Script\n\n*Set the step's value to this: open /System/Library/PreferencePanes/StartupDisk.prefPane\n\n*Save it somewhere (probably ~/Applications)\n\n*Change its icon (probably to the icon from the StartupDisk.prefPane file)\n\n*Drag it to the Dock like any other application\n\nRun it and it will take you directly to that preference pane without the initial step of opening System Preferences.\n", "Q: Sync iPhone's contact with Facebook, Twitter, etc I am looking for an app capable of merging duplicated contacts and updating my iPhone contacts with Facebook and Twitter friends information.

This is fairly simple to do by setting up a Gmail account and telling it to sync (and merge) contacts with your address book. Then you'll need to use the web interface to merge duplicates. It's possibly the least painful one I've seen.\n\n*The built-in Twitter integration automatically syncs contacts where it can find matches, and the Facebook iPhone app was able to do the same (I don't use FB anymore so I can't test this now). In other words, two apps, not one, with the same outcome.\nThe merge option is more work than you're probably wanting to put in, but the amount of time it takes will be offset by the amount of time you're waiting for a perfect answer.\n", "Q: Process “ubd” high CPU usage I noticed my MBP got really slow, which must be strange with SSD and 8GB of RAM. \nSo I opened the Activity Monitor to discover a process called ubd keeps its CPU usage very high, about 120% most of the time:\n\nI found a thread that discusses the issue but it is related to having hundreds of iCloud certificates in the keychain, which I don't.\n\nHow do I go on with diagnosing the issue?\n\nA: By observing log messages in ~/Library/Logs/Ubiquity/<my username>/, I realized that Ubiquity (iCloud process) kept trying to create a file in a folder that doesn't exist:\n\nI opened up the Terminal and created this directory and its parent directories up to .ubd:\ncd ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/\nsudo mkdir .ubd && cd .ubd\nsudo mkdir peer-E2B13E4F-56F7-C79B-1621-E30738B638FE-v23 && cd peer-E2B13E4F-56F7-C79B-1621-E30738B638FE-v23\nsudo mkdir ftr\n\nThen I changed the newly created directories' owner from root to myself:\ncd ../..\nsudo chown -R <my username> .ubd/ \n\nThe fan turned silent instantly.\n\nA: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5208590?start=0&tstart=0 :\n\"Applications that can store documents in iCloud include Preview, TextEdit, Pages, Numbers, Keynote, GarageBand, and some third-party software such as \"DayOne,\" \"iA Writer,\" \"MindNode,\" and perhaps others.

My MacBook Pro (8,3) often gets fairly hot (see current sensor readings here: http://pastebin.com/2rj7GGAJ) even when it isn't closed. I'm about to purchase a DualHead2Go (or a TripleHead2Go) so I can use my MacBook while closed to push two 1920x1080 displays. I'm worried a bit about the heat generation, however. Is this a recommended and/or safe thing to do? \n\nA: Yes - they are designed to work when closed. The machine will shut itself off if it ever exceeds the safe operating temperature (unless of course there are multiple failures in the sensors).\nYou can measure the battery temp - and may reduce the useful life of the battery if the temperature is always higher (and substantially higher on the order of 10 to 30 degrees F) for extended always on periods.\nYou may never need a new battery with the new 5 year / 1000 cycle batteries - so that might not even be a concern. I'm happy to spend the $99 on a new one if I really need one after the normal 3 year coverage has lapsed with Apple Care. Other than the battery - the rest of the electronics is basically immune to heat. The next thing to go might be a blower bearing - but those are far cheaper to have replaced than even a battery.\n", "Q: Torrent tracker for OSX? Why are there no small torrent trackers for Mac? I want to share some things privately with a couple of people. I've tried a webserver, which works, but there is no indication on my end that any transfer is taking place. I'd like to be able to run a server, seed a torrent with a client so I can see upload activity, and share the torrent with select people.\nuTorrent for Windows has an embedded tracker feature, but it is not present for Mac.\n\nA: After some trial and error, I discovered a few ways to do this. The easiest solution requiring no Windows client and no external programs is option 1. The absolute easiest method is option 2, use µTorrent for Windows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Share between computers running µTorrent without a tracker\nThis assumes that your µTorrent machines can open their own ports in your firewall using uPNP or NAT-PMP. While this may work with other torrent clients, I've had the best luck when using µTorrent. Also, it seems to be one of the few that will allow us to manually add peers, the crucial step.\nFor simplicity, we'll call the machine with the file(s) to share, \"server\", even though bittorrent has no concept of a server.\nOn the server machine, select New Torrent from the File menu.\nSettings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the file or parent directory you want to share\n\n*Make sure the tracker list is empty\n\n*Select Start Seeding\n\n*Select Private torrent\nNow, Create and Save As... and give your torrent file a name.\nAt this point, you need to figure out your server's internet IP address. If you don't know how, try http://whatismyip.com.\nWith the IP in hand, you need to figure out what port µTorrent has opened in your firewall. You can find this in the preferences or by clicking on the right-most icon in the status bar at the bottom of the main µTorrent window.\nSend the torrent file along with the IP and Port (e-mail, instant message, etc.) to your colleague(s).\nEach of them should open that torrent file with µTorrent, select the torrent in the list, and select the Peers list. They may have to show the Details Pane from the View menu if not already visible.\nRight-click in the Peers list and choose Add Peer....\nEnter the server's IP and Port like this:  IP:Port.\nThe client should now connect to the server and start/resume the transfer.\nNote: If the server cannot open a port in the firewall, you could add the client peers to the server's peer list, too.\n\n*Use a Windows machine with µTorrent as a tracker\nIn the Preferences, under Advanced, set bt.enable_tracker to true. Now, create a new torrent as described above, but put http://IP:PORT/announce in the tracker list using the same IP and Port described above. Once this is done, your clients will not need the Add Peer... step. They can simply open the torrent file with µTorrent.\nNote: The Windows machine running the µTorrent tracker doesn't have to be the server or the clients. If you have any Windows machine available, you could run µTorrent on it and have it serve as your tracker. (I didn't actually test this, but in theory, it should work.)\n\n*Install a simple php web-server tracker\nIf you already have access to a webserver, the easiest tracker I found to install is BitStorm, a single-file php tracker. Simply place the php file on your server somewhere and then put http://server/path/to/bitstorm.php in your tracker list when creating a new torrent. The clients should only need the torrent file.\nNote: If I were going to leave this running for the sharing of private files, I would put it on an HTTPS server with a username and password pair to protect it. Then change the tracker url to https://user:pass@server/path/to/bitstorm.php.\n\n*Install an actual compiled tracker program\nI found several of these that will compile and run on OSX, but none of them seem to work properly in my testing. My tests may have been complicated by the fact that my tracker and clients all had the same IP address (my external IP). Regardless, I don't think this is the right solution because you shouldn't need to require developer tools to be installed.\nWarning: I tried using Vuze, an OSX torrent client with a built-in tracker, but I couldn't get it to work. However, it seems that it installed several plugins into every single browser on my system and changed all of my default search engines. Be careful.\n", "Q: Choosing Dictionary.app spelling language I'm Venezuelan, so my native language is Spanish. But I have my MacMini and my MacBook in English because that's the way I like to work, it's better for my (and my job). Usually, when I access Dictionary app (mostly with Alfred), I can just look out the definitions, synonyms and whatnot in English, but not in Spanish.\nThe only way I know how to switch the language is changing the global language settings (via System Preferences > Language and Text). This means that the whole OS would be in Spanish. I would like to be able to use both languages in Dictionary.app, at the same time, so I can look out definitions, synonyms, and else in both languages (specially through Alfred).\nAny way I can achieve that?\n\nA: The Dictionary.app supplied by Apple only has English and Japanese, regardless of what language you set your OS to.  You can add modules as explained here:\nhttp://m10lmac.blogspot.com/2011/12/more-dictionaries-for-dictionaryapp.html\nDictionary.app has nothing to do with spellchecking, that is done by other parts of the OS.  You can change the spellcheck to Spanish in Apple apps by going to Edit > Spelling and Grammary > Show Spelling and Grammar.\n", "Q: If a Mac has 1GB inactive, and it has been idle for an hour, why it doesn't swap the inactive RAM to the pagefile for \"readiness\"? I am sure Apple engineers have thought of and decided not to do it -- if from the Activity Monitor, I see out of the 4GB of total RAM, 1GB is not active, and the Mac has been idle for 1 or 2 hours, then if I start a new app, it is still very slow due to \"not enough RAM\" -- looks like the Mac is swapping things out to the pagefile so that the new app can run in the RAM space.\nBut if the Mac has been idle for 1, 2, or even 8 hours, why doesn't Mac OS X swap the inactive RAM to the pagefile first, so that there is 1GB of free RAM, so that when a new app is started, it is very fast, just like there is extra RAM there free to use.  Maybe it is so that the user knows the RAM is getting used up and we don't want the pagefile getting bigger and bigger and out of control?  But why not limit the getting bigger and bigger just to about 6GB total, or 8GB, and then start not swapping the inactive RAM automatically?  In other words, for the first 1GB or 2GB of inactive RAM, swap it to the pagefile, so that more RAM is ready for use immediately.  Just don't do it all the time later on.  Does someone know why that isn't done or how can it be made so? (by changing a System Preference?)\n\nA: The system does not know which action will be the next. If instead of opening a new application after an hour you decide to work on some stuff that was cached (and is part of the inactive memory) it will be already there.\nInstead of swapping out to free memory or emptying disk caches the system waits to see if you actually need the memory to avoid unnecessary work.\nYou can always force the disk caches to be flushed (freeing some memory) with the purge command.\n", "Q: Firebug style inspect element on iPhone?

I know a lot of important apps come bundled or pre-installed with OS X, but I am not aware of a lot of them.\nCould someone please point me as to where I can learn about such apps and what are the important apps which I should know about?\n\nA: The Mac 101 on Apple website seems like a good place to start.\nAnd of course, Ask Different.\n\nA: David Pogue's book Switching to the Mac: The Missing Manual, Snow Leopard Edition is highly recommended. As you can tell from the title, it's designed to explain Snow Leopard to people who are coming from Windows. It's 650 pages.\nThere is a second, larger (900 pages), and more comprehensive book from David Pogue called Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Missing Manual which is not aimed at Windows users and goes into greater depth about how to use Snow Leopard's features.\n\nA: Mac OS X is a Unix based system. Most Linux command line tutorials will work for Mac. Here is a really good one that I used. You could search for Bash, Shell, Mac command-line, etc.\n\nA: I highly recommend every new mac user check out ScreencastsOnline.  This is a weekly podcast by Don McAllister who is really well regarded in the mac community. I listen to a lot of mac related podcasts, and Don is the one the other podcasters go to when they can't figure something out. He used to be a Windows IT guy who made the switch to mac several years ago. He now works full time reviewing and explaining Apple tech to the rest of us.\nHis weekly episodes alternate between free and member's only. The free episodes are just as good as the member's and a great way to try before you buy.\nSpecific to your question, he did a 2-part review of all the applications in the /Applications/Utilities folder a while back. The first part is free and can be viewed here. Take a look at the full back catalog of several hundred episodes and you'll see that he covers pretty much everything.\n\nA: I don't think there is some you \"need\" to know. Other than couple utility apps like Onyx and Stuffit Expander/ The Unarchiver everything depends on what you do. Also I use Sparrow over the default Mail app. For some reason it kept asking my passwords all the time so I just shut it down.Annoying indeed.\nFor knowing about new apps I would suggest twitter.

I have an iPhone 4s with the latest iOS.\nIt seems that when I wake it up from standby, it switches from 3G (or EDGE) to WiFi. Judging from that, I suspect it turns off WiFi when in standby, and only uses it when activated.\nHowever, I don't know if that's purely coincidental, because a few friends of mine couldn't confirm it.\nIf switching to 3G data on standby is intended to reduce power usage, I would actually disagree, since often, a stable WiFi connection uses less data/power than 3G/EDGE with bad signal (which is the case in my apartment). Furthermore, I don't want to use my mobile carrier's data plan for doing background syncing/pushing, which my phone is doing 90% of the time when it's just sitting on the desk.\nSo, long story short: \n\n\n*\n\n*When does the iPhone switch back to 3G even if it has WiFi signal? \n\n*Can I modify this behavior somewhere?\n\n\nA: As you've noticed, the iPhone switches off WiFi when it sleeps and uses 3G. This is by design. The 3G radio consumes less battery power.\n\nWhen does the iPhone switch back to 3G even if it has WiFi signal?\n\nAs soon as you wake the phone it will being re-enabling sleep-disabled services like the WiFi radio. If you were previously joined to a wireless network that is still within range your phone should re-join that network a few seconds after you wake it up. Here is where problems can crop up - a burp in your router or temporary interference can prevent the WiFi from rejoining and if your data coverage is fast enough, you may not notice you are now on paid 3G data. Especially if you are streaming video or playing a game and the menu bar is hidden.\nIf will switch back to 3G if you tell it to forget the current Wi-Fi network it's joined to and have it set to no auto-join any other known network in range. Or shortly after you put it back to sleep.\n\nCan I modify this behavior somewhere?\n\nAll of the Wi-Fi behaviour is set using the Settings app, under the Wi-Fi menu.\nYou can turn the Wi-Fi radio off completely here. This will stop the phone from searching for wireless networks altogether and you'll be running completely on cellular data services. (See #1 in screen shot)\nYou can set what the phone does if the Wi-Fi radio is on, networks are detected, but it is not currently joined to any of them. In this circumstance the phone can prompt you to join a network or do nothing and let you manually join a network if you so desire. (See #2 in the screen shot).\n\nYou can also manually chose a network here. And, if you're currently joined to a network, you can click the > arrow next to its name to get the details and, if you want to, \"forget\" the network and disconnect from it.\n\n\nA: I finally got around that issue by jailbreaking my iPhone (using Absinthe), and installing Insomnia:\n\nInsomnia Pro is an application in Cydia that allows applications and WiFi to remain alive even if your iDevice is in standby mode. Insomnia Pro runs as a background daemon with a status bar icon, and survives reboots and SpringBoard restarts.\n\nThis is how it looks like:\n\nThe matter of fact is: In my room, 3G reception is terribly bad, so staying on WiFi will definitely consume less power than running on 3G all the time, and push messages now arrive instantly.\n\nA: Apple assumes you want to be able to receive phone calls, which means leaving the 3G radio powered on, and also want to save battery life when locked/sleeping, which means turning power to the WIFI radio off.  If you keep the phone plugged in to the charger and awake, then it won't try to save battery life.\n\nA: Same problem was faced by me, other than the above answers the best way is to switch off the Cellular Data from the setting panel and re-enable it when you are sure that you are out of your wifi zone.\n", "Q: License and royalty specifics for AppleLoops in Logic If I use any of the AppleLoops supplied with Logic 9 in my project, will I be subject to an liability or royalty?

I have this script lines from my ISP:\nsudo bash\necho \"plugin L2TP.ppp\">>/etc/ppp/options \necho \"l2tpnoipsec\">>/etc/ppp/options\n\nIt works if I paste line by line into Terminal.\nI want to create a *.command file and run it by double-clicking. But all I get is password prompting and then empty bash window. The resulting \"options\" file is empty.\nI tried this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"plugin L2TP.ppp\">>/etc/ppp/options \necho \"l2tpnoipsec\">>/etc/ppp/options\n\nI get: \n\n/etc/ppp/options: Permission denied\n\nI think I need to use some command to get root privileges from inside bash. \n\nA: Save this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"plugin L2TP.ppp\">>/etc/ppp/options \necho \"l2tpnoipsec\">>/etc/ppp/options\n\nto your Desktop in a file named script.sh.\nOpen a Terminal window and type:\nsudo bash ~/Desktop/script.sh\n\nEnter your password when prompted and all the commands in the file will run with super user privledges.\n\nA: If for security purposes, you don't want any user of your system to be able to run the script, but rather you want to be prompted for an administrative password, an alternate solution would be to save the shell script and then use the program AppleScript Editor to create an AppleScript.\nThe AppleScript would be a one-liner, saying do shell script «your script's name here» with administrator privileges. Save that script as an Application. Then, when you click it, it will ask you for an administrator password, then run the shell script with administrator privileges.\nObviously, replace «your script's name here» with the path to your script.\n\nA: The problem's that when you do it from the command line, what you're doing is starting bash under sudo, and then sending those next two commands to bash, not the original shell.  (the sign being that you need to exit twice)\nWhen you do it in a script, the bash command never exits, so the next two commands never run.\nIt's not as elegant as the AppleScript solution, but if you're going to do this as a script from the command line, the equivalent would be:\n#!/bin/sh --\nsudo bash -c 'echo \"plugin L2TP.ppp\">>/etc/ppp/options' \nsudo bash -c 'echo \"l2tpnoipsec\">>/etc/ppp/options'\n\nIf we didn't need the io redirection (the >> bit), we could just call the command directly via sudo without needing the sudo sh -c trick. (and note that I had to quote the argument to sh -c to keep it from running the echo as root, but the file appending as the original user.)\nIt will work as a .command file from the Finder, but it'll bring up a terminal window, asking for your password, and if entered correctly, will run the commands.  (assuming you haven't recently authenticated for sudo ... if you have, it'll run through without prompting)\n\nA: Take the script that you created:\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"plugin L2TP.ppp\">>/etc/ppp/options \necho \"l2tpnoipsec\">>/etc/ppp/options\n\nSave it in your home directory, or a 'scripts' directory inside your home directory, as l2tp.sh. Allow it to be executed(write this command in Terminal):\nchmod 700 ~/path/to/l2tp.sh\n\nTo execute the file using sudo (root privileges):\nMethod #1. In Terminal type:\n$ sudo ~/path/to/l2tp.sh\n\nMethod #2. Create a file run_l2tp.command with this contents:\nsudo ~/path/to/l2tp.sh\n\nAllow it to be executed:\nchmod u+x run_l2tp.command\n\nWhen you double-click run_l2tp.command and enter the password the l2tp.sh file will be executed with root privileges.\nSome notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*On UNIX like systems, ~ is short for \"my home directory\".\n\n*Chmod 700 will make the file executable only by you. For more information: see this Wikipedia page.\n\n*typing 'sudo' before a command will execute the program using root privileges. Be careful when doing this, bad things can happen if you're not sure what you're doing.\n\n*Obviously you can omit the /path/to if you saved this script directly in your home directory.\n\n", "Q: What can slow down/How can I speed up the pre-kernel boot steps? I've got a late 2007 Macbook Pro with 4 GB of RAM and an SSD.  I am running Boot Camp and have an OptiBay.  I have partitioned the SSD and secondary drive to devote half of each to Lion and half to Windows 7.  There is an additional Lion 'Recovery' partition - I've considered re-partitioning with gparted to remove this as I don't need it, but have left it alone for now.\nThe SSD especially makes things very fast; I can boot from the boot selector (this thing) to my Lion desktop (ignoring password entry times) in 23 seconds and to my Windows 7 desktop in 26 seconds. Both are a marked improvement over booting to just Lion with my 500 GB, 5400 RPM Scorpio Blue hard drive, which took some 45 seconds. \nHowever, the time to reach the boot selector has increased greatly: It now takes 25 seconds to reach the boot selector, where previously the computer would spin up the drive, chime, and reach the Apple logo in just two or three seconds.  The increased time to this screen negates the improved boot times in the actual OS.\nIs there something I'm doing wrong in my partition scheme to cause this slow boot up?\nThe boot sequence doesn't seem to have this much work to do in these steps.  The documentation says that the operations performed which are taking 25 seconds are: \n\n\n*\n\n*Power On: Boot-ROM/RAM check is initialized\n\n*BootROM-POST: Power-on self test of Boot ROM\n\n*BootROM-EFI: Boot chime\n\n*Boot EFI: Mounts drives and loads drivers and other files needed to start the OS\n\n\nAfter that, I select a disk (or let the default disk load) and the following steps occur:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kernel: Grey screen with Apple logo and spinning gear\n\n*launchd: Brushed metal screen\n\n*loginwindow: Login window appears\n\n*User Environment Setup: Desktop and dock appear\n\n\nIt does boot, so I can only assume that the BootROM-POST passed.  Is it possible it's 'barely passing' and testing multiple times or moving slowly?  I don't see how the first three steps could take much time at all, so I assume that it's the Boot EFI step that's taking forever.  I've also read the refit documentation on the boot process, which goes into a bit more detail about hardware discovery and driver loading.  Is it possible that the new drives are re-installing their drivers each time I boot? \nAny assistance towards removing or even simply better understanding this delay would be much appreciated!\n\nA: The boot selector scans all possible boot devices, including network, firewire, and USB devices.  Try disabling WiFi, unplugging everything, resetting PRAM (like cksum said) and then rebooting again.  The fewer choices the boot-loader has, the faster it will load.  The ultimate speed up, is to go into System Preferences -> Startup Disk to select the desired partition.  It sounds like that is not what you want, but it illustrates the process.\n", "Q: Print folder contents with non-standard printing settings I want to print all files which are dragged to a folder. Easy to do with Automator.\nBut I want to specify more settings for the print, namely to print the items two times, to use paper tray 2 instead of 1 (standard); the file should be deleted afterwards (This would also be easy with Automator)\nIs there a way to specify these special options? The process is all the time the same, so there should be no promt to ask me what options I want to choose; it should be a simple workflow: Drag files on folder, print with these settings.\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: I was not able to find a way to do this in Automator.  My work around was as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Automator to convert all documents to pdf\n\n*use CUPS to print from the terminal with non-standard settings, e.g. \n$ for i in *pdf; do lpr -o sides=two-sided-long-edge $i; done\n", "Q: Reinstalling Everything after HD Replacement I'm about to replace my iMac's HD (250GB to 1TB). I'm planning to create an image of my disk right in m Time Capsule, and after the transition I need to clone the HD back.\nUnfortunately Lion has no DVD, and I'm not sure if I should create one. Can I use my Snow Leopard disk to boot, and clone the Image to the new HD? Will the Time Capsule (which is connected via ethernet) be visible, and what about the difference between the image and the new HD in size? So, I'm not sure if it will work.\nAnother option would be to use the Time Machine backup to restore, but I'm not sure if I would trust it.\n\nA: You can do this with Time Machine, but there is another method, if you have the equipment. Instead of Time Machine, use a shareware disk cloning utility. I use Carbon Copy Cloner.\nIf you are paying someone to swap out the hard drive in your iMac, ask them if they can do the following for you. \nDon't erase your main hard drive just yet. Take the new hard drive that you are going to install in the iMac and put it in an external enclosure that uses USB or FireWire, and connect it directly to the iMac. Use Disk Utility to make sure it is properly formatted to make it a bootable Mac OS X volume. Install Carbon Copy Cloner on Mac OS X on your main hard drive and us it to completely clone that drive to the external drive. Check the Carbon Copy Cloner settings to make sure that it will create a bootable duplicate drive.\nThen you can remove the new drive from its enclosure and install the new drive into the iMac and boot it up.\n\nA: While the method you outline may work, Apple has much easier tools built into OS X that are meant for moving from one mac to a new one (which is essentially what you're doing). Basically you need to backup your data, create a Lion installation disk, install Lion on the new drive and use Migration Assistant to restore your data. \nBackup\nThe Migration Assistant allows you to recovery your data from either a Time Machine backup or a bootable clone. You mentioned making an image on the Time Capsule. It's my understanding that you can use the Time Capsule for Time Machine or as an external hard drive, but not both. Even if you can get it to work, it's messy.\nWhile you can recover from a Time Machine backup, I tend to be overly cautious when dealing with my data and like to have some redundancy. I would highly recommend buying a 250GB external drive (you can get them on Amazon for around $60) and making a bootable clone of your disk. It never hurts to have an extra drive around. Whichever way you decide to go, here's what you need to do -\n\n\n*\n\n*Run your normal Time Machine backup to make sure it's up to date.\n\n*Create a bootable clone using Carbon Copy Cloner as previously recommended. If you go this route, CCC can also create a clone of the Recovery HD (explained below).\nCreate Lion Recovery Disk\nWhen you installed Lion, it should have created a hidden partition known as the Recovery HD. You can boot from that just like you could from the Snow Leopard DVD. Apple has released a tool that will make a bootable copy of the Recovery HD on a USB thumb drive. If you used the Carbon Copy Cloner option above, you'll already have a copy of the Recovery HD on your external drive and can skip these steps (unless you want an install thumb drive \"just in case\").\n\n\n*\n\n*For some reason, some people don't have this partition installed. To verify it exists on your machine, shut down and then hold the option key while restarting. You should get a list of drives that you can boot from. Verify Recovery HD is listed. I'll cover what to do if it's not later. \n\n*Download the Lion Recovery Disk Assistant.\n\n*Insert a USB thumb drive. Apple says at least 1GB, but many are recommending at least 4GB.\n\n*Run the tool and follow the instructions.\nIf for some reason you don't have the Recovery HD partition, you can still create the USB drive, it's just a bit more involved. TUAW has a good walk through of how to do this.\nReplace Your Drive & Install Lion\nYou're ready! Pop in that new hard drive, then boot from the Recovery HD on the USB drive you just created or on the external drive you put your clone on (Hold down option key while starting the system and select the drive. It should be named Recovery HD). Install Lion just as you would install from DVD. You will need internet access since the installer calls home to get additional files. The process took about an hour for me.\nCopy Data Using Migration Assistant\nOnce the installer is done it will reboot your mac from the new drive and you'll see the Lion welcome screen that greets purchasers of a new mac. Follow the prompts and you'll be given the option to move your accounts from an old computer or drive. You'll be asked if you want to recover from a Time Machine backup, another mac or an external drive. If you have the clone, choose the external drive option, if not select Time Machine. You'll then be presented with options on what data you want to migrate. Just select everything and let the Migration Assistant go to work.\nWhen the tool is finished you can reboot your mac and everything will be back to where it was. You won't even notice you've got a new drive until you want to use all that extra space.\n\nA: You might also want to check out AppFresh, which connects to your iUseThis account and automatically downloads everything you've flagged as 'I use this.'  In some cases it can also install the software, plug-in, etc for you.\n", "Q: Is there a way to use a Finder hot key to open a folder in TextMate? I have setup a System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Services item to allow me to use a hotkey to \"Open in TextMate\". It works fine on files, but does not work on folders. \nIf I Control+Click on the same folder, select \"Services\" from the pop-up menu and choose \"Open in TextMate\" the folder is opened as a project in TextMate. This is exactly what I'm looking for. Is there a way to setup a shortcut to have the same open folder as project behavior as the Control+Click method?\n\nA: I think that's a bug with Finder. Services that receive folders as input don't seem to be listed in the Services menu when folders are selected (but it only applies to column view; they are listed in other view modes).\nIn any case, one alternative would be to just use an AppleScript without wrapping it as a service. You can give it an app-specific shortcut with FastScripts.\ntry\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        open (get selection) using path to application \"TextMate\"\n    end tell\nend try\n\n\nA: After seeing @Lri's answer I discovered that my original service would work in the Finder as long as I wasn't in column view. Since that's the view that I use most of the time, I decided to see if I could get @Lir's basic solution working without the need for an external application. Here's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator and choose \"Service\" from the options of what to make.\n\n*Set \"Service receives\" to \"no input\" and \"in\" to \"Finder.app\". \n\n*Drop a \"Run AppleScript\" action onto the main window. \n\n*Drop the code @Lri provided into place so you end up with:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    try\n        tell application \"Finder\"\n        open (get selection) using path to application \"TextMate\"\n        end tell\n    end try\n\n    return input\nend run\n\n\n\n*Save the action as \"Open via TextMate\".\n\n*Under \"System Preferences\" -> \"Keyboard\" -> \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" -> \"Services\" -> \"General\" add my preferred shortcut to the \"Open vie TextMate\" item. \n\nThis works in all my Finder views (including column view) for Mac OS X 10.7.3 and TextMate 1.5.10. \n\nA: Looks like you can do this with a piece of software called Shortcuts.\n", "Q: How can I clean a MagSafe power port on my MacBook Air There appears to be a few small metallic fragments clinging to the magnet around the port where the MagSafe power connecter attaches to my MacBook Air. I can still get the cord to (mostly) seat, enough to charge the computer, but it's not as snug a fit as it used to be. How can I clean my MagSafe port?\n\nA: Here's the solution I used to clean out metal fragments in my connector socket:\nUse Blu-Tack or Sticky Tack! This cleans out the connector socket almost immediately and it took less than a penny's worth of tack! Just roll it around in the connector and it'll work fine :)\n\nA: From Apple's Support site:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/TS1713\n\nIf your MagSafe connectors requires cleaning:\nTo clean the DC plug on either the computer or the power adapter,\n  disconnect the adapter from the wall outlet and/or remove the battery\n  from the computer. Remove debris gently with a cotton swab or a soft\n  bristle toothbrush, which provide the strength, flexibility, and\n  precision for this task. Be careful not to get any cotton fibers stuck\n  in the pin receptacle. You may use isopropyl alcohol to aid in\n  cleaning the connectors as well. Be sure the connectors are dry before\n  using the computer or adapter after cleaning.\nNote: The power adapter port contains a magnet that can erase data on\n  a credit card or other magnetic device if it gets too close. In order\n  to preserve and protect your data, Apple recommends that you keep\n  magnetic media away from the power adapter port.\n\n\nA: Once I got small pieces of iron stuck in the port - none of the magnets we had were stronger than the one in the port. We couldn't flick them out with a clean paintbrush and the hole was too small to put fingernails in. We ended up getting it out with blue tack!\n\nA: I used chewing gum to get the metal pieces out. That was the only resource I had at hand at the time, and it worked like magic!\n\nA: Tried all the above and finally got the shard out with a Bit-O-Honey. Yes, the candy. \n\nA: Start with a pencil eraser or small wooden dowel / tool to gently dislodge the debris. As the magnets are very strong, you may need to use tape with a strong adhesive to grab the foreign material. Clear packing tape strikes a good balance between not leaving residue and getting the crud out. Duct tape also is nice, but a bit more sticky and may grab the plastic covering if it is wearing or the adhesive is warm from internal heat.\nSo:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power off the mac\n\n*Let the connector cool\n\n*Be gentle - don't tear the magsafe covering\n\n*know you can get it serviced with a new connector if needed for approx $40 in labor and the part might run you between $10 and $40 depending on the model.\n\n\nAnd I know Apple recommends a toothbrush and a cotton swab. The first will get off huge easily removed debris, but not staples and highly magnetic items that are small. The latter is actually quite nice in many cases as it will grab items with a sharp edge. Usually when things are gunked up enough to displace the adapter - you'll have many fine pieces accumulated and need tape or stronger tools than a q-tip.\n\nA: I used a wooden toothpick, but not as you would expect. I broke it in half, ensuring there were a number of fibers splayed out from the broken ends. The metallic particle then became caught in these and was very easily removed.\nPat\n\nA: I was trying using a bobby-pin, paper clip, small pieces of paper, my nail for about 20-30 minutes, getting very frustrated at this point... finally I thought of tweezers!\nGot it out first try\n\nA: I just went through this myself - a couple pieces of metal got into my port - toothbrush and pen tip were worthless and only sticky thing I had around were some breath right strips which didn't work = What did work was cutting a 45 degree angle off a Q-tip - I happen to have the type with a hollow blue plastic inside - this allowed me to use the bottom edge to scoop the frags and the hollow plastic kept it from just clinging back on so I could scoop it.\n\nA: Just got bits of magnetized debris out by putting a piece of tape over the port and pressing the sticky side of the tape into the debris with a pen tip. It came right out when I pulled the tape off.\n\nA: There were microscopic metal bits stuck magnetically to the MagSafe port on my laptop. I fixed it by making several pointy edges of tape, sticky side out. I went completely around the 4 sides of the port. I did this several times until the MagSafe connector worked reliably.\n\nA: MacBook Pro feel into sand at beach... Magsafe instantly spawned a cancerous growth of iron particles on the magsafe charging port.... The cable wouldn't really connect and when it could it wasn't charging merely accepting power. Scraping stuff out was slow if not effective but still the adapter wasn't great. Luckily someone has some compressed air and I blew that crap right out!\n\nA: One way that I used to get some iron out of my MagSafe port was taking deep breaths and blowing out really hard directing the air into the port. If you blow hard enough the pieces should just fly straight out. One tip is just doing for at least one minute, at first, it didn't seem to work but with lots of effort it got the job done relatively fast.\n", "Q: How can I remove a PDF in iTunes? There are several PDF files which I imported into iTunes to read using iBooks.\nHowever, I cannot manage to remove them. By default, iTunes handles the its media library automatically. The PDFs and iBooks are stored in:\n~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\\ Media/Books/\n\nWhen I remove the PDF files here, they will still show up in iTunes. \nHow I remove their entries in iTunes?\n\nA: Can you not select the book and use Command ⌘ + Delete ⌫?\nYou'll be presented with a choice to delete the book from the library, or move it to the trash:\n\nYou'll probably want to move it to the trash, unless it's a PDF that you don't have somewhere else. Also, make sure that you are going to the books tab on your computer, not managing the books on your device.\nHere:\n\nNot here:\n \n\nA: I think I know what is happening. I had this happen.\nWhen you are trying to delete these items you are still in your device screen, not your actual Library.\nNear the top right, where it says Devices, click eject. This will bring you back to your iTunes Library.\n\nNow, in the top left corner, select Books fro the drop-down menu. Now you can delete items from your Library permanently.\n\n", "Q: HOME dir on another disk, how do I restore from TM backup? I have two disks in my MBP. One is small SSD for the OS and applications, and the other is  slow HDD for my HOME folder, downloads and stuff like that.\nI have Time Machine set up. Everything seems to be backed up smoothly. I have changed location of my user dir in the Settings -> Users&Groups. Also I have created a symlink /Users/sergio that points to /Volumes/MacintoshHD/Users/sergio (where actual data lives).\nI tried restoring from this backup, the user gets created in the process, but I can't login. Probably because it's another machine which has only one disk.\nWhat I was expecting (I don't know why) is that restoration process would walk that symlink in /Users and \"dereference\" my user dir onto system disk. Apparently, it doesn't do that.\nDid anyone try restoring a backup with similar setup? Is it even possible? If it isn't, I might as well stop backing up :)\n\nA: Time Machine backs up symbolic links, it does not follow them.  The operating system would not restore correctly otherwise.\nTime Machine will back up multiple volumes, if you allow it to do so in Options.  However, I believe you need to restore them separately.  If you were to restore both volumes in the same configuration as the original, then it should work.  Linking anything through /Volumes is a bit fragile, so you might need to adjust the symlink after restoring both volumes.\n\nA: I understand that you restored but can't log in under your user. Do any other users work?\nIf you can start in Single User Mode and then mount the hard drive\n\n/sbin/mount -uw /\n\nto allow access to the drive. After than perform these commands:\n\ntouch /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\nshutdown -r now\n\nThis will restart the computer and then let you go through Setup Assistant. Use Setup Assistant to create a temporary admin account (username:John; password: Doe, etc). Once that is finished you can then use Time Machine to attempt to restore the home folder from the other drive. Place it in the single hard drive of the new computer or recreate the symbolic link again.\n", "Q: When is the GUID partition table (GPT) preferred over Apple partition map (APM) for external drives? I have seagate external portable hard-drive 1 TB, and I will be using with following Mac's.\n13\" White MacBook (Intel Core 2 Duo) running Snow Leopard\n13\" MacBook Air (Intel Core i5) running Lion\niMac running Lion\nWhat partition map I should use, GUID or Apple when formatting external portable hard-drive?\n\nA: It's always better unless you must use the drive with an OS that is too old or too different to support the GPT format. Windows, Unix, macOS all support GPT / GUID and APM is not widely supported on other OS.\nTo elaborate, GUID (or more properly GPT - the GUID partition table scheme) is the new bootable standard for Macs so use it unless you have macs that need to boot from this drive and cannot support GUID. APM is your only option in that unlikely case. The vast majority of macs will work with both in all instances - especially if you don't need it to be bootable.\n", "Q: Image Capture \"Delete After Import\" Disappeared There used to be a checkbox when I import pictures from my camera that said \"delete after import\" or something like that. It's not there anymore. Any ideas?\n\nA: If Image Capture detects that the device uses iCloud Photo Library, it disables 'delete after import'.\nYou can tell when the program starts the option shows, then a split second later, when the iCloud icon shows up next to the device, the 'delete after import' option is gone.\nHere are some work-arounds:\nOn your device, go to Settings > iCloud > Photos > and then turn off iCloud Photo Library. This of course has larger repercussions (photos are no longer saved in the cloud).\nIn Image Capture, with your device connected, select all the photos you want to delete and then ⌘-Delete\n\nA: If the media is write protected, or if the device is not providing full USB drive functionality, then deletion would not be possible and so might not be offered.\n\nA: This was a very annoying thing for a long time until I decided to FIX IT.....\nI fixed it by replacing the cable - I use an original SHORT apple cable to connect the phone to my MAC :)\nI tried everything and this what did it for me. Good luck!\n", "Q: Why are some pop up boxes (or \"select\" boxes) colored blue but others aren't in Mac OS X? I am fairly new to Mac OS X and I am wondering why some of these pop up boxes have a blue in them, but others do not. For example, on one website it looks like this (look at the little \"Select site\" box):\n\nBut then on another site, it looks like this (the \"Show:\" box):\n\nIs there a different name for each of these? They both look like basic <select> elements but oddly it is blue on one site and not on others.\n\nA: The blue style is the default \"Aqua\" style for drop downs, which is what you'll see in most applications. However, sites can customize the appearance of dropdowns using CSS, in which case browsers like Safari and Chrome switch from the default style to the other one you see.\nHere's a little example where you can see the style change when you put your mouse on the dropdown.\n\nA: In the example pages referenced it looks the yola page is implementing their own custom drop down menu that happens to look like an OS X drop down menu (don't have a yola log in to verify) but I am \"pretty sure\" its not a native UI Drop down element try it on other platforms it should look the same or similar to how it does now.\nWhile on the other hand the Yahoo answers page is using a general html or other standards based drop down that will match the default drop down look for the platform that the browser is running on. Now try opening that page on multiple platforms and watch it change.\nFor example see how Yahoo answers looks on chrome on android\n\nIf your curious here is a reference to some java-script code that produces a standardized drop down menu that will adopt a native UI appearence based on Operating System platform.\n", "Q: Can't connect Mac to Mac via Finder over LAN I'm having trouble getting one Mac on my home LAN to talk to another - let's call them Red and Blue.

It's a free app that lets you send your personal documents to your Kindle devices and Kindle iOS reading apps from your Mac. \nYou can send using drag and drop, or from the Finder, or from other Mac apps via the \"Send to Kindle\" option in the Print menu. You can also choose which devices and apps you want to send to. \nThe documents you send must be one of these file types:\n\n\n*\n\n*Microsoft Word (.DOC, .DOCX) \n\n*PDF (.PDF)\n\n*TXT (.TXT)\n\n*RTF (.RTF)\n\n*JPEG (.JPEG, .JPG) \n\n*GIF (.GIF) \n\n*PNG (.PNG)\n\n*BMP (.BMP)\n\n*MOBI (.MOBI - used for eBooks)\n\n\nIf your file doesn't meet these requirements, you can always use a tool like Calibre to convert it to a compatible type.\nWhen uploading .MOBI eBooks these need to be DRM free.\nThere's more info on using the app on Amazon's site.\n\nA: I purchased an ebook in Mobi format from a seller other than Amazon. I used the Send to Kindle application on my PC to send it to my Kindle device (strangely, by Kindle for PC was not on the list of options - more on this later). It was delivered to my device right away, and I happily read it. I made many highlights (as I often do), and I wanted to see those highlights on my PC to prepare some teaching notes. However, I discovered that the book did not appear on my Kindle for PC. I also checked my history of highlights at https://kindle.amazon.com/your_highlights and they were not there either. I started to worry at this point, thinking that I only ever have access to my highlights on the Kindle device itself.\nI called Amazon support and here's what we learned: we went to Manage Your Content and Devices and clicked on YOur Content. The book did not appear under books, but DID appear under Docs. I then clicked on the action button next to my book and clicked the Deliver to: Others link. This brought up a window with a drop-down list of all my devices - except my Kindle for PC or the Amazon Cloud Reader were greyed out. I picked my iPhone, and sure enough the book appeared there with my highlights (yay!). I then went to my iPad (without sending the book there explicitly) and it was there with my highlights again.\nShort version: If you send a third-party mobi book to your kindle, it will sync between Kindle apps, but only if they are on a Kindle, iOS or Android device; the cloud reader and PC applications (maybe Mac, too?) will not have the book or its associated notes/highlights.\n\nA: An excellent way to do this besides the Send To Kindle app is to use your Send To Kindle email address which allows you to send all kinds of files directly to a Kindle device or device running an Kindle app. The best thing to do is to send it to your Kindle cloud account, which has 5 GBS of free space, and from there you can just download to any device using the Cloud tab. To get more info on how to find your email addresses and all that check out this link  http://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle/email\n\nA: It seems Kindle exclusively supports purchased ebook sync as Amazon won't auto sync every sideloaded book. Things are quite different on iPad and iPhone as iBooks supports purchased & non-purchased book sync. However, you must hope to sync between\nyour Kindle and apple device.\nHere is a guide exactly concerning how to sync the furthest page among various OS & devices, which does not suit you well but might be of help more or less.\n", "Q: How to make Mac Terminal restore working directories when restarting I use the Mac Terminal with a hand full of tabs each assigned to a different working directory. I have configured it to open new windows with the same working directory. Nevertheless, when I am quitting Terminal, and restart it it rebuilds all the tabs, their names, even shows me the last output in the window but stays in the user home directory and does not restore the latest working directory of each tab.\nWhat am I doing wrong? Can this be caused by some setting in the ~/.bash_profile?\n\nA: If you are using Bash-It, you may run into the problem of $PROMPT_COMMAND being overwritten by it.\nAs mentioned it is used by OS X to restore cwd in new tabs. Bash it should append values, not override them.\nBut a workaround for now would be to add the following line to your ~/.bash_profile\nsource $BASH_IT/bash_it.sh\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND=\"$PROMPT_COMMAND;update_terminal_cwd;\"\n\nFor more info checkout the issue tracker for updates:\nhttps://github.com/revans/bash-it/issues/240\nAnd the Apple reference for it\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/darwin/reference/manpages/man1/sh.1.html\n\nA: (For reference, we’re talking about the Resume feature of Mac OS X Lion 10.7 and later.)\nTerminal automatically restores the working directory if you’re using the default shell, bash. If you’re using some other shell, you’ll need to adapt the code in /etc/bashrc to send an escape sequence to communicate the working directory to Terminal so it can restore the directory later for Resume. If you’re using zsh, see my answer to Resume Zsh-Terminal (OS X Lion), in which I include the appropriate code for zsh.\nIf you have a custom ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc you may need to ensure that you’re not undoing the default behavior by modifying /etc/bashrc’s customizations. In particular, it sets the PROMPT_COMMAND environment variable to send the escape sequence at each prompt. If you customize that variable, you’ll need to prefix or append your code to the current value, e.g.:\nPROMPT_COMMAND=\"<your code here>;$PROMPT_COMMAND\"\n\nAlso, generally, ~/.bash_profile should execute ~/.bashrc:\nif [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then\n    . ~/.bashrc\nfi\n\n\nA: I wrote up a blog post on how to do this for csh/tcsh before I discovered this answer; if anyone else comes here looking for a solution for those shells, here it is:\nif (\"$?TERM_PROGRAM\") then\n  if (\"$TERM_PROGRAM\" == \"Apple_Terminal\") then\n    alias precmd 'printf \"\\033]7;%s\\a\" \"file://$host$cwd:ags/ /%20/\"'\n  endif\nendif\n\nAdd that to your .cshrc or .tcshrc as appropriate. (The outer if statement is necessary to avoid an error when remotely logging in, as with ssh. It has to be a separate statement because of the variable expansion rules in tcsh.)\nLike Apple's builtin bash support, this solution uses no external programs other than printf, at the cost of only escaping spaces. If you need to escape other special characters, you'll have to work a little harder to find a more comprehensive solution.\n", "Q: Am I missing out by not running in 64-bit mode? I'm running an Early '11 MacBook Pro with 16GB RAM.\nCurrently, OS X Lion runs in 32-bit mode by default, and an important piece of software I use for work requires this mode (Cisco VPN client). Most of the work I do is inside a VMWare Fusion Windows 7 64-bit VM with 4GB RAM. The RAM upgrade is fairly recent, which is why I am bringing this up now. I've also considered pushing the VM to 6GB or 8GB, but I'm hesitant as I thought VMWare might have problems loading up all that memory in a 32-bit space.\nAm I missing out on any performance gains by running in 32-bit mode? \n\nA: Not really - until you have programs that refuse to run on anything but a 64 bit kernel or programs that need to allocate more RAM than they can in 32 bit address space you can keep running 32 bit on the Mac OS.\nRunning a 32bit OS instance does not preclude you from running 64bit applications.  It's one of the more unusual things about Mac OS X, and very different to the Windows way of doing things where there are specific 32bit/64bit versions with fairly rigid limitations on what you can run.\nAs such, depending what you use your computer for there are some disadvantages to running in 32bit mode (addressable memory as per a different answer for one) but by and large you are not forced to run everything in 32bit just because your kernel is, and so the disadvantages are considerable less than for other OS.\nSee the following question/answer on Stack Overflow for more details:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://superuser.com/a/100837\nYou can have a play with 32 and 64 bit versions of the kernel by looking at the following instructions from Apple*:\n\nIf your Mac uses the 32-bit kernel by default, but supports the 64-bit kernel, you can start up using the 64-bit kernel by holding the\n  6 and 4 keys during startup.\nIf your Mac uses the 64-bit kernel by default, you can start up with the 32-bit kernel by holding the 3 and 2 keys during startup.\nYour Mac will revert to the default kernel the next time you reboot it.\nTo select the 64-bit kernel for the current startup disk, use the following command in Terminal:\nsudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture x86_64\nTo select the 32-bit kernel for the current startup disk, use the following command in Terminal:\nsudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture i386\nNote: This setting is stored in the /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist file and\n  will take effect every time you start up from this disk. If you start\n  up from a different disk, the setting on that disk, or the hardware\n  default, will take effect.\n\nI am not sure why you talk about RAM in the middle of your question there, it doesn't seem particularly pertinent to me, and nor is there a specific question, so perhaps a question edit would be helpful to promote more answers.\n(* Instructions for Snow Leopard, but should still apply)\n\nA: Lion is not meant to be used in 32bit mode. Also addressing more than 4GB ram with 32bit kernel is slower (it uses PAE).\nIf the only reason of using Lion in 32bit mode is the Cisco VPN client (yuck!) there is a way. Here is an article explaining how to use the native VPN client instead - it's for 10.6, but should work. It's a matter of configuration, not of software. And here is a forum post that pointed to thad solution.\nAbout the Cisco VPN 3000 hardware - yes, it works with iOS and native OSX VPN client in IPSec mode, and it's a matter of software update and configuration. You should be running at least 4.7.2P according to the CISCO field notice. It's stated that it's not supported, but it works. Here is another success story. Make sure that you're using at least OSX 10.7.2.\nps. being tight on money is not always bad, It usually makes people more creative and makes them think and learn new things.

If you find any, then one of your drives may be failing.  See my article Recover Failing Hard Drives\nThird, verify both your boot drive and backup drive in Disk Utility.  Do not attempt this until you have confirmed that there are no I/O errors!  Verifying the backup drive may take a long time (twenty minutes or more) as there are a lot of hard-links to check.  Repair if needed.\nIf that checks out, try locating a folder named \"freds mac\"... unless that's the name of your boot volume.  If its not the name of your boot volume, then rename it and try the backup again.

I was reading a great answer to how you can extend the list of characters Lion shows you when hold down a key for a few seconds. The in answer he says:\n\nchoose the keyboard file relevant to your locale if you are using a different keyboard layout\n\nIn /System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/Resources/ I see quite a few files. I'm not sure how to figure out which one, precisely, I need to edit to make the changes laid out in that program. I'm using an english keyboard, but I'm in Canada. To the best of my knowledge though I'm not doing anything Canada-specific with my keyboard layout. It's a plain, english, Apple keyboard -- the kind you'd buy in any Apple Store in the United States.\nThe plist file that applies to me could be any of:\nKeyboard-default.plist\nKeyboard-en_CA.plist\nKeyboard-en_US.plist\nKeyboard-en.plist\n\nHow do I figure out which specific keyboard plist profile is the one I'm using?\n\nA: It's determined by the list in the \"Language & Text\" preference pane's Language tab.\n\nThe plist file that is chosen is the one that matches with the language in the list that is highest to the top that has a match.\nFor example: if your list shows \"Canadian English, UK English, Spanish, …\", Keyboard-en_CA.plist will be chosen, as it best matches Canadian English. If the list is \"Português, Suomi, English, …\", Keyboard-en.plist will be chosen, as it best matches English, which is the language closest to the top that is available. (The last is assuming that Portuguese and Finnish plists aren't available.) If there are no languages in the list that have plists present, the Keyboard_default.plist would likely be chosen.\n\nA: I'd like to add that you can change the entire layout (or key-mappings) of your physical keyboard in software using the Input Sources tab in the Language & Text preference pane.\n\n\nThis enables you to type various characters and diacriticals pertinent to different languages according to the method used in those languages and countries.\nYou can change keyboard layouts independently of the Language choice, which determines the language of your user interface, menus, dialog boxes and help files.\n", "Q: How to force Startup Manager menu to appear at every boot? Is there any way to force the Startup Manager menu to appear on every boot? Rather than me having to remember to hold down Alt if I want a different OS.\n\n\nA: I'm not sure this is possible by default without holding down the ⌥ key at startup. You can make the Boot Camp partition always boot by selecting it in System Preferences → Startup Disk, but it sounds like this isn't what you want.  \nHowever, if you're not adverse to installing additional software, I think rEFIt may do what you need. The section on Getting into the rEFIt menu says:\n\nIf you have installed rEFIt on your Mac OS X volume, it will be loaded\n  automatically when the Mac starts up.\n\nYou should then be able to select whichever OS you want to boot from there.\n\nA: You don't without modifying things on a low level or adding custom software like the awesome Boot Runner. When a mac can't find the first viable image to boot, it's programmed to get the prohibitory icon - not the boot picker.\n \nIntel Macs have the following basic behavior at boot time when the chime indicates a successful POST.

What is the difference between the sudo and su command? Why does OS X handle these different than Linux?\n\nA: OS X handles sudo and su identically to Linux.\nsudo is a command that, without any additional options, will run a command as root. For example:\n% touch /newfile\ntouch: /newfile: Permission denied\n% ls -l /newfile\nls: /newfile: No such file or directory\n% sudo touch /newfile\n% ls -l /newfile \n-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  0 Apr 27 11:45 /newfile\n\nsu on the other hand, will switch the current user to root (again without any extra commands). In the example below, I have to run sudo su, since I don't know the root password for my system:\n% whoami\nalake\n% sudo su\n$ whoami\nroot\n\nThe key difference between sudo and su is sudo runs a command as root, whereas su makes you root. Much like other command line utilities there are a number of alternative ways to use both sudo and su, if you're interested you can always run man <command> eg. man sudo to get more information.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro GPU Diode over 100 degrees Celsius hot? I was playing Trine 2 yesterday and checked the inside temperatures with iStat Pro after playing. It showed the GPU Diode at being 107°C hot. Is that bad for the GPU Diode or other components inside the MacBook Pro?\nI was using it at normal room temperature and the MacBook Pro was sitting on a wooden desk.\nRight now the GPU Diode is at 6°C and the GPU itself is at 25°C, and all I'm doing is browsing with Safari.\nI have the late 2011 17\" MacBook Pro.\n\nA: Yes, that is bad.\nApple's fan controls favor quiet over safety and tend to key off the CPU temperature, ignoring the fact that the GPU can go far out of spec even while the CPU remains relatively cool.  3D games in particular can burn out the GPU because of the native control's bias toward CPU temperature.\nIf you are going to play video games on an iMac or MacBook, I strongly recommend obtaining fan control software and setting a steep profile so that the fans spin aggressively with CPU temperature, thereby keeping the GPU from going out of spec.  If you are playing games in Boot Camp, having a separate fan controller is absolutely essential.\nIt sounds like you may already have some damage to the GPU or motherboard.  If you are still under warranty or AppleCare, try to find an artifact that you can reproduce at the Genius bar and get the GPU/motherboard replaced.  Remember that the system will be cold when you get there, so it may take a while to reproduce heat problems.  The Geniuses like to use the iTunes visualizer as a test case, but if you have an offline game that produces  problems that will work as well.\nIn any case, increasing the fan speed to keep the GPU temperature down while playing 3D games will greatly extend the life of your system.\n\nA: It's probably not too much of a problem. If the system gets too hot, OS X will know to throttle down or shut down.\nIf you're worried or this happens too much (or the system declares it's too hot), take your laptop into an Apple Store or Apple Authorized reseller and have them check it out to make sure nothing's wrong.\n\nA: Try the app \"Macs Fan Control\" and set the right fan to the GPU. I set a max of 65c...seems to never really go above that for me...\n\nA: I have a late 2011 MBP 15\", after i switched from my 2009 MBP i definitely noticed that the 2011 runs much warmer and louder (fan). This is regardless of the task at hand. I've spent hours researching this and it looks like the i7s just run hotter than the core 2 duos. If your experiencing issues such as what you described, i highly suggest you take it into an Apple store to be looked at.\n", "Q: Is there a way to configure the keyboard on an iPad I just got an iPad 2 and I find the keyboard difficult to use, because the keys always show as caps.\nIs there a way to modify the keyboard to display lower or upper depending on what the what the case of the next typed character will be?\nOr better, is there a way to change the keyboard to a better one, perhaps with numeric keys accessible from the main keyboard?\n\nA: Unfortunately what you're looking for is unavailable as of iOS 5.1. \nThe letter keys you type are lower case unless the shift key is blue. This does match a physical keyboard so hopefully you can get past that lack of displaying exactly what you get.\nFrom a design standpoint, each app can add to the keyboard or replace the keyboard entirely, but you can't load a different keyboard if you don't like the ones that are delivered from iOS.\nOne example of an augmented keyboard is the Prompt ssh application by Panic.\n\nOne modification you can do to the keyboard is to \"pull the keyboard apart\". Using two fingers start in the center of the keyboard and slide your fingers towards the side of the iPad as if you were stretching the keyboard apart.\nAlso, if you're interested in editing in a language other then your device's default you can go to Settings -> General -> International then select one of several dozen languages available including Hebrew, per your comment. Once you've selected an alternate language you can tap the international icon to cycle through your selected languages as noted in the image below.\n\n\nA: There are various apps (search for \"keyboard\") which provide alternative keyboards that may be useful for certain purposes.

I'd like to write messages using Apple Mail using inline links, as opposed to the \"naked\" URLs, so I can do something like this:\n\nHave you visited Ask Different?\n\nUnfortunately, the best I seem to be able to accomplish is to add the \"naked\" link after the text, like this:\n\nHave you visited Ask Different: http://apple.stackexchange.com?\n\nI've tried using ⌘ + K (or Edit → Add Link... from the menubar) to add a link, but it only gives you the option to add the \"naked\" link itself, and not the substituted inline text.\nI'm aware that you can do this in Outlook for Mac, and the difference seems to be that Outlook formats it's messages as HTML whereas Apple Mail formats them as RTF.\nIs there a simple way to accomplish this?\n\nA: Yes you can. Simply select the text , right-click, select Link, Add Link and add the URL.\n\n\nA: You're doing it fine with ⌘K.

Silly question, but does the MacBook Air not actually have RAM because it uses Flash or what?\nDoes it make application loading faster than the MacBook Pro?\n\nA: Every model of the Macbook Air has RAM. Every computer has some amount of RAM.\n\nWhat led you to believe it didn't have RAM?\n\nA: The RAM is soldered onto the logic board in the MacBook Air line, so it's not something you can replace as a distinct part that can be added later.\nThis cuts both ways - in one respect, the product is smaller, has less moving parts, and is a more standard configuration. On the other hand, you can't add more later, take advantage of replacing one small part if it fails or delay the decision how much RAM to buy since it's fixed when you select a model.\n", "Q: Copy text from mac to ipad I'm often reading stuff on my Mac but then I want to switch to my iPad to read it there. Is there a simple way to copy text or an URL from my Mac to my iPad?\n\nA: Safari's reading list and iCloud works well to synchronize a list of URL between Macs and iOS devices. The Simplenote app and web app work well to let all your devices keep track of text documents. You only need to pay for the latter if you want enhanced features or avoid the advertisements that are minimal and generally very tasteful.\n\nA: Pastebot, while not iPad native, is excellent for pushing images/text and various other bits between a Mac and iOS device.\nIf you're looking for a longer lasting solution, check out Instapaper.\n\nA: To copy an URL you could try Jumping URL as well as myPhoneDesktop which can also push text to the Notes app on the iPad.  Let me know what you think about these.  In the meantime I'll look for some more apps.\n\nA: A free no additional app solution exists If you are using iCloud, you can use the built in Notes Application on the iPhone / iPad and coming soon to Mac OS X via Mountain Lion. \nBut til then on Lion Notes can be oddly be accessed via the OS X Lion Mail Application Notes function.

It was jailbroken before and after I clicked \"Erase all settings\", it won't boot up. Now I'm thinking to upgrade to latest iOS 5.1 and I have some questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*is iOS 5.1 slow on the 3GS? I just don't want to upgrade just for the sake of upgrading so if an older iOS version would fit better, I'll just take an older firmware.\n\n*can I easily unlock and jailbreak with 5.1?\n\n\nThanks!\n\nA: Tapping \"Reset all settings\" on a jailbroken device always causes problems - next time make sure to install ResetAllKiller to disable those buttons.\nThere are a lot of conflicting opinions about whether iOS 5 is slower or faster than iOS 4 on iPhone 3GS; I don't think there's any consensus on this.\nIf you do a normal iTunes restore to iOS 5.1, you will only be able to have a tethered jailbreak (see the Dev Team Blog post about the latest version of redsn0w), and the only way to unofficially unlock it would be to install the iPad baseband, which has various downsides and isn't even compatible with newer iPhone 3GSes - see this unlocking guide.\nThe best path would be to check to see which SHSH blobs are on file with Cydia's servers for your device, and then use the appropriate SHSH blobs to restore to an iOS version with an untethered jailbreak available. You can use TinyUmbrella to check your SHSH blobs and then use redsn0w to stitch them into custom firmware which you can use to restore your device - see here for a more detailed guide to restoring with SHSH blobs.\n\nA: I have no experience with jailbreaking but if your 3GS is out of contract, ATT will unlock it for you if you meet the requirements (basically don't owe them money). I just had it done yesterday by calling them. The lady in the storefront was unfamiliar with this new policy. \nBefore the unlocking the 3GS was running 5.1. It runs fine as I use for reading news, watching trailers, calendar, email, etc. Some games were slow. \n\nA: Regarding the ease of jailbreaking and unlocking on iOS 5.1, there isn't any official release of any unlocking or jailbreak tools for iOS 5.1 as of yet. \nThere are rumors of the jailbreak tool being found, but it may be withheld till iOS 6 to preserve exploits for future jailbreaks. \nPossible source : http://pod2g-ios.blogspot.fr/\nI got wind that Gevey Sim doesn't work on iOS 5.1 even though it has been released, do take note =). Source\n\nA: From personal experience on two phones, one jailbroken and one not, I can confirm that both the phones were slow on ios 5. In fact the jailbroken was so slow that I regretted upgrading it. It reminded me of the first time I used an android phone. \n\nA: My unscientific opinion - based on my own experience, and not measured, is that my iPhone 3GS was slightly faster with iOS 5 than iOS 4.\n", "Q: How to find your stolen mac on a network using the MAC address/Serial number The important stuff:\n\n\n*\n\n*My Mac got stolen in a public library (unsecure Wifi).\n\n*All I have is the MAC address and the serial number.\n\n*Can I use another laptop to get onto that network and list out the machines and lookup their MAC addresses?

I use my MacBook with an external monitor at work and home. Unfortunately, they are both the same model and this seems to confuse OS X.\nAt work, I have the monitor on the left and at home the right. But each time I move from one to the other, I have to manually change the arrangement.\nDoes OS X not remember arrangement for multiple monitors, or is using the same model the source of confusion here?\n\nA: OS X tries to remember arrangements, but it relies on monitors identifying themselves appropriately.  Cheap brands may not bother to put distinct serial numbers in the EDID information they report, even though this is required by the EDID standard, so OS X will end up recognizing them all as the same monitor.\n\nA: Even in 2019 macOS fails to preserve my monitor layout. I wrote a tool called displayplacer that lets describe your monitor layout as a terminal command. I then use BetterTouchTool to execute these profiles via hotkeys. It solved the same problem for me of using the same model monitor at work (in portrait mode) as at home (in landscape mode).\nFor example, on my 4 monitor setup at home I have this profile: displayplacer \"id:A46D2F5E-487B-CC69-C588-ECFD519016E5 res:3840x2160 hz:60 color_depth:8 scaling:off origin:(0,0) degree:0\" \"id:F466F621-B5FA-04A0-0800-CFA6C258DECD res:1440x900 color_depth:4 scaling:on origin:(-1440,1437) degree:0\" \"id:4C405A05-8798-553B-3550-F93E7A7722BB res:1440x2560 color_depth:8 scaling:off origin:(3840,-363) degree:270\" \"id:18173D22-3EC6-E735-EEB4-B003BF681F30 res:1920x1200 color_depth:8 scaling:off origin:(960,-1200) degree:0\"\nAlso available via Homebrew brew tap jakehilborn/jakehilborn && brew install displayplacer\n\nA: I have not verified the EDID, but I have a related problem that might shed some light...\nI use the old Apple Cinema 30\" HD display at both work and home. Unfortunately due to the desk configuration at the office, I'm forced to set-up my 30\" monitor to the left of my 15\" MBP w/ Retina, but have he opposite configuration at home (with the 30\" to the right of the MBP). \nI can attest that my MBP does not distinguish between the two Cinema displays and expect the desktop to span both ways for either of the configuration.\nIf OS X was indeed using EDID and distinguish the monitors by their serial numbers, I expect I would not see this behavior.\n", "Q: File management for iOS What are some better solutions (apps or any ways) to manage files (folders and subfolders with PDFs, docs, video, audio etc.) on iOS device (iPhone or iPad) that can sync with OS X? \nCurrently I'm using \"USB Disk Pro\" but I have to manually create the folders in iTunes and drag and drop each files manually.

I now have a directory tree recursively mirrored between iPad and OS X, and any changes made to either will be reflected on the other after a sync. Conflicts are handled manually.\nIf you don't want to set up SCP/SSH, you can use DropBox too, it is just slower than a direct connection to your Mac on the local network.\nIn truth, I use a combination, mirroring some folders (~5 GB worth) via SCP, and a few others via DropBox, just in separate trees on the Mac and on the iPad.\n", "Q: What iOS Twitter apps support custom API URLs? I recently read about the WordPress.com Twitter API released in 2009, and I want to test it out. \nThe API requires you to use a Twitter client that supports custom API URLs.  The example iOS application that they listed was Tweetie2, but it's dead now. \nAre there any other iOS app that allow custom API URLs to that I can test this out?\n\nA: Tweetbot for iOS does. It relies on the \"tweetbot://\" prefix. Using it without a suffix launches the app. But you can also tack on things like \"timeline\" to load up a users own timeline (the full command would be as follows tweetbot:///timeline). Other commands are tweetbot:///post?text=hello which will tweet \"hello\" or tweetbot://cksum/post which will tweet with a username (in this case \"cksum\"). Others include things like search or pull up a user's profile. \n", "Q: Is it possible to use a SD card as virtual memory in OS X Server? I have a 8gb High Performance SD card that I would like to use as swap (virtual memory).  Is this possible in Mac OS X Server, and if so how do I go about doing this?  \n\nA: You probably can use an SD card as a backing store. \nHowever: you should not expect a good result. See the up-voted comments. \n\nA: No - the Mac OS doesn't have an accelerate feature where extra storage swaps files (or anything else for that matter). The best you could do is try to disable swap - move the swapfile directory to the card and re-start the dynamic pager.\nHere are a few questions to get you started:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why would I disable swap file in Mac OS X?\n\n*How can I move virtual memory swap files to a different drive or partition?\nAlso - for the purposes of VM mechanics, the server OS and the normal OS behave the same.\n\nA: This is what I'll do.\na) Disable VM\nb) Delete the original folder where the system stores swap files\nc) Create a alias to a folder in the SD Card and change its name to match the folder you deleted.\nd) Enable VM and see if it works, if it doesn't it PROBABLY won't crash the system, VM SHOULD simply fall back and NOT turn on.\nI strongly don't recommend this, SD Card won't be any faster than HD in terms of performance.\nI will recommend alias (if it works), because that way you can just delete the alias if you changed your mind.\n", "Q: Is there a way to select Safari's search (Google) bar (top right) with a keyboard shortcut?

To do that, I use Dropbox and export the smart album every now and then to my dropbox, which then creates a web album for the folder.\nHowever, when Aperture encounters a file with the exact name of a picture that it wants to export, it appends \" (1)\" to the file name and creates a duplicate for the web album. To avoid this, I have to manually delete all files in the dropbox folder before I export. This is tedious and sometimes I forget to do so, having to export all files again.\nIs there any way to get Aperture to not export the duplicates?\n\nA: One method you might consider is using Aperture itself to create your web gallery. Use File > New > Web Page to create a web album, then fill it with photos from your smart album. Aperture won't duplicate photos in this album even when you drag in duplicates, so you'll end up with one copy of each image after all of your updates.\nWhen you publish the web album (using the Export Web Pages button), Aperture will replace any folder with the same name, again avoiding duplicates. This perhaps isn't quite as good as just skipping duplicates -- it does waste time, deleting old files and recreating identical new ones -- but it nevertheless achieves your goal.\n\nBut if you want to stick with your current system, the bad news is that there is nothing that will force Aperture to directly overwrite existing data. It's one of the fail-safe mechanisms of the program. There is a thread on the Apple discussion forum on a nearly identical question, and one of the respondents there suggests creating an Automator action that will delete the existing images on your Dropbox, and then export a new set of images from Aperture. Again, not ideal, but it does achieve your goal.\n\nA: One way: Use a colour label on the exported photos. Then you'll be able to see what ones have already been exported at a glance. Then just select the unlabelled photos for export. Once that batch is done, label them too.\n", "Q: Differentiating Apple products by their MAC addresses Apple has registered a ton of MAC address ranges for its products.  Does anyone know whether it's feasible to reliably identify which Apple product (particularly iPad, iPod, iPhone, and MacBooks) a particular device is in network traffic via specific MAC address prefixes? In other words, is there something about the MAC address of an iPad that is distinguishable from the MAC address of a MacBook, for instance?\n\nA: Reply two years after asking, it is not feasible relying only on the Mac address.\nSince you mention monitoring the network traffic,\nThe best approach would be to listen Bonjour traffic (multicast dns).\nBy default, machines are called 'jannies-iphone.local', 'gregs-macbook.local', 'peters-imac.local'...\nBonjour is pretty talkative and generate noise for AFP, SMB, VNC, RAOP, DAAP and other services/protocols. I would suggest you to use \"Bonjour Browser\" then script something with Tshark (Wireshark command line) to automatize the process.\nWithout remote scans, you can manage your devices by :\n\n\n*\n\n*Running an agent (or profile) on each OS X and iOS devices to fetch 'sysctl hw.model' or its serial number. 'Mac Tracker' can help you to\nsee the different models of Mac and their spec and serial number\npattern.\n\n*Using Profile Manager, Configurator or any MDM solutions. (But this does not address your question).\nFind iOS and OS X running on the network :\nAlso you could use a network tool such as nmap with the option -A, -O, or -sV (Active Fingerprinting and service version) and filter Apple mac addresses prefix using a network anylizer.\nLooking at the service version, port numbers [tcp 65xxx being a iphone-sync port, tcp 548 AFP (OS X)] will help you to determine OS X version and Hardware but not precisely.\n(You will not be able to differentiate, iPad, iPhone, and iPod, or Mac Model).\n\nA: If you are simply needing to identify whether it is a Macintosh product or not you could try the this MAC address lookup service. It allows you to type in the MAC address, and it will tell you what the vendor name is. It is not likely to be helpful in terms of identifying specific vendors for programatic use, however it has worked for me in regards to finding if the machine is an Apple product.\nUPDATE:\nAside from utilizing an internal database it is not likely that you will be able to do what you are asking. If you did decide to setup an internal database it may be prudent to utilize the serial number or another unique ID available for each machine.\n\nA: I was working for a worldwide known embedded computer developper/producer. As Dennis sayd (and I guess You allready known) the first three octets of six from the MAC address are for vendor's identification. Therefore u can buy adress ranges from IEEE. After them you have to guarantee as developper/vendor from your own hardware that this second part is so that the complete 6 byte MAC is entirely unique in the whole wolrd (without regarding missuse and MACspoofing for security issues later on). For lifetime of your production activity You have to guarantee that inner your 3 bytes vendor code, each code has a really unique range of adresses for second half of MAC.\nHow to realize that in a continuous production?\nWe ve done this by assume a new adress (n+1) from our range n in{0..16'777'215} per each MAC Vendor Adress part, where n was the last given address AND the concerning unit has succesful absolved the final function test (eg. was responding in a Ethernet test bank check).\nWhat's MAC Address and what is it identifying?\nIn fact, the MAC Adress is for network layer protocoll (2nd Layer in ISO/OSI model) and used for IEE802 protocols as Ethernet,WLAN, Bluetooth and others  and refers ONLY the Network Card! NOT the machine behind! So the 2nd part of MAC is nothing else then serial production number from network chipset respectively board (e.g. WLAN or bluetooth internal extention is a small smd- printed cirquit upset on the mainboard and also serviceable).\nExamples\nI have no Apple hardware arround me. But I made a check with Samsung hardware. Here are my results: (I refer only the vendor part of MAC)\n\n\n*\n\n*for Samsung Galaxy S II running latest Android 4.0.4\n\n04:46:65  WLAN (802.11)  this refers to Murata Manufacturing Co. as chip-producer\n  56:b2:a4  GSM advanced (IP over Cellphone network), not refered in my MAC-vendor list \n\n\n*Samsung Galaxy GT-P5110 running latest Android 4.0.4\n\n50:01:BB WLAN (802.11) not refered in my MAC-vendor list \n\nHope to give some aspect-related answers to  your question.\n\nA: No, sorting or determining a pattern in the MAC address isn't a feasible way to map to model of Apple product.\n\nOver years of watching MAC addresses on networks as well as the explosion of devices on the iOS end of things, if there were a nice pattern, it would start showing in deployments with hundreds of devices.\nFor example, I have one Mac that has data on about 1,000 iOS devices that have been connected over time to that Mac while iPhone configuration utility was running. Looking at the data now, there are no clear patterns to help differentiate between the device types. \nThis also applies to Macs. Sadly, my data here is in the hundreds and not thousands presently. Yes - a string of MacBooks when ordered together will usually have sequential addresses (more so than sequential serial numbers in fact) - but over time, the iMacs seem mixed in with the Airs and the MacBook Pro.\nIt could be that there is some encoding present and no-one has stumbled across which bits are coded with model numbers, but a simple sort of the MAC addresses has the devices all jumbled up. Perhaps if you can find someone that runs the mobile device management software for a very large company or school district and see if they are curious enough to see if a larger data set would yield some better results for you.\nI haven't seen a case where a Mac and an iOS device share the same smaller block of MAC addresses, but I can't even rule that out for you based on my experience running networks that log MAC address and are in a position to know what hardware is associated with which MAC address over the years.\nMy guess is the addresses are issued sequentially rather than by final destination. It would make sense to dole out parts of each region to factories that are expected to make 5 or 10 thousand devices in the next month and onle issue more once the existing addresses are consumed. If so, we might have better luck trying to bin the numbers by approximate manufacturing date rather than by where it ends up in a shipping product. Also consider on the Mac end, repairs often give a new MAC address to portables and even desktop Macs when the ethernet controller is replaced.\n\nA: I am not aware of any official list, but you can try to compile one the way AppleSerialNumberInfo.com has done with serial numbers.  You might even approach them to do it for you.  A quick check of a few devices suggests it might be possible, as the MAC prefixes I looked at did vary by model.  \nOf course it will never be foolproof, as devices such as routers and switches (as well as virtual machines) routinely allow you to easily set their MAC addresses to anything you want to.\n\nA: The first half of a MAC address identifies the vendor, the second half doesn't necessarily correspond to anything.\n\nA: No. it's not possible to differentiate between different products of Apple just by their MAC address.\nYou can, however, lookup hundreds of MAC addresses very conveniently - simply paste a list of MAC addresses and it will spit out the manufacturers.\n\nA: This is what I do. Using \"nmap\" you can find out what the device is  based on the OS or the device type.

It seems like a bug in vmhgfs.\nPlease don't suggest using NFS, SMB, etc.  I'm specifically interested in getting HGFS working.\n\nA: the following solution does not properly fit the original question, as it does not provide a solution to use symlinks in the host as symlinks within guests. nevertheless it can be useful in certain situations, specially for windows guests:\nAdding ...\nsharedFolderX.followSymlinks = \"TRUE\"\n\nto your .vmx file, where X stands for any given shared folder in question, makes the symlink transparent to the guest. so the symlinks now show as a regular file or folder within the guest. the mapping take place in the host.\nthis works for the following versions and above\n\n\n*\n\n*VMware ACE 2.0.x\n\n*VMware Fusion 2.x\n\n*VMware Player 2.x (Linux)\n\n*VMware Workstation 6.x (Linux)\n\n\nas of Dec 24, 2013.\nplease refer to the VMware KB article Symbolic Links Do Not Work in Folders Shared Between Linux/Mac Hosts and Windows Guests (1007277) for more details and affected/supported versions.\n\n---- edit by Martin (as comments not yet allowed).\n---- credits also to Mike as he provided the link to the VMware KB in his answer.\n\nA: Confirmed works under Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and fails under Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:\nroot$> mkdir bar\nroot$> touch bar/blah\nroot$> ls -l bar\ntotal 1\n-rw-r--r-- 1 503 80 0 May  7 16:37 blah\nroot$> ln -s bar/blah foo\nroot$> ls -l foo\nlrwxr-xr-x 1 503 80 8 May  7 16:30 foo -> bar/blah\nroot$> cat foo\ncat: foo: Is a directory\nroot$> cd foo\nroot$> ls -l\ntotal 1\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 503 80 102 May  7 17:02 blah\n\nI suggest filing a bug report with VMware\n\nA: Maybe this can help. http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1007277\n\nA: I worked around this by using NFS. However that this only gives read-only access.\n(NFS server config adapted from http://www.behanna.org/osx/nfs/howto1.html)\nOn the host edit /etc/exports:\nsudo vi /etc/exports\n\nAdd a line like the following (presuming your host network is using the 192.168.69.0 subnet, which is what vmware's NAT uses):\n/Users -network 192.168.69.0 -mask 255.255.255.0\n\nEnable nfsd:\nsudo nfsd enable\n\nTest your work:\nshowmount -e\n\nOn the Linux guest install the nfs client.

Note that this will mean that from the perspective of the guest mount all files on the host will be owned by you and have group \"staff\".  Then\nsudo nfsd enable\nsudo nfsd start\n\nOn the Linux guest\nsudo apt-get install nfs-common\n\nThen add a line like this to /etc/fstab\n172.16.241.1:/Users/foo /mnt/foo_nfs nfs auto,soft,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,rw 0 0\n\nthen\nsudo mkdir /mnt/foo_nfs\nsudo mount /mnt/foo_nfs\n\n\nA: I am working around this by using smb sharing instead of hgfs:\nhttp://communities.vmware.com/message/2089295\nsudo apt-get install smbfs\nsudo mkdir /mnt/foo_smb\necho \"username=foo\" > /etc/samba/user # where foo is my username on the host.\n\nAdd this line to /etc/fstab\n//172.16.241.1/foo /mnt/foo_smb cifs noauto,credentials=/etc/samba/user,rw,uid=bar 0 0\n\nwhere bar is my username on the guest.  Finally\nsudo mount /mnt/foo_smb\n\non the guest.\nUNFORTUNATELY, after upgrading to os x 10.8.2 recently, this stopped working.  Apparrently apple has replaced their SMB server with something called SMBX.\nhttp://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.cifs/3517\nAttempting to mount with the fstab entry above now gives\nmount error(22): Invalid argument\nRefer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g. man mount.cifs)\n\nThis can be partially worked around by adding the extra options\niocharset=utf8,nounix,noserverinfo,sec=ntlmssp\n\nbut unfortunately the nounix option means that symlinks will not work.\nAnother option is to add something like \nsharedFolder0.followSymlinks = \"TRUE\"\n\nto the vmx file, but this means symlinks will look like regular files, not symlinks.\nhttp://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1007277\n", "Q: How can I download free apps without registering an Apple ID? \n\"This Apple ID has not been yet been used before in the iTunes Store. Tap review to sign in, then review your account information.\"\n\nI keep getting this message when I try to install free apps from App Store. I don't want to give my account info until I actually purchase something. \nCan I not download free apps until I provide my account information? My email verification is complete. I'm using an iPhone 3GS logged in to my iTunes account.\n\nA: The App Store requires you to have a valid Apple ID (normally an e-mail address) in order to download any content from there.\nHowever, you do not need to add payment methods when following this guide:\nCreate an iTunes Store, App Store, or iBooks Store account without a credit card or other payment method\n\nA: This is by design. Apple requires you to set up an account even for free purchases (except podcasts).\nIn the past, you could set up a free account in iCloud and get away with not entering information, but now the security is getting beefed up.\nYou may be asked for three security questions and to re-verify your account periodically. The passwords are now more strict in needing a mix of case and numbers where you used to be able to choose a simpler password for your Apple ID.\nThere are cases where the device is not working properly and you keep getting this verification error, but in the case you describe it is now mandatory to enter more information when setting up your account initially.\n", "Q: Block access to folder or file in Mac OS X Is there any way to block access to some particular file or folder in MacOS X, so that it can be protected by password? \n\nA: Not directly - you have to use an app that accesses the file (e.g. a secure note in 1password or a program like gpg or your own app that encrypts/decrypts a file ) or put the file on an encrypted file system (create using Disk Utility or TrueCrypt etc.) See this question for some ways of encrypting.\n\nA: Yes and no.\nIf you want a file to be unreadable by a user without administrator privileges, you can Get Info for that file in the Finder. On the bottom of the information pane, there is a Sharing and Permissions section; setting everyone's settings to \"No access\" will prevent users of the OS from reading the file under normal circumstances.\nThat said,\n\n\n*\n\n*anyone with administrator privileges on that system can change the settings back to allowing read access to any user, and\n\n*If someone boots from a different boot disk (including the recovery partition in Lion), they can mount the regular filesystem and instruct it to disregard permissions, enabling anyone to read the file.\nSo it's not super-secure at all, but it is enough to keep nosy regular users without an abundance of technical sophistication out of a file.\n\nA: Using Terminal you can type the following commands to ensure root only access to the file or folder\nchown root /yourfile\nchmod 700 /yourfile\n\nThis ensures that the file is protected by password. (the root password)\nYou could do the same with any user. In the following command the \"example_user\" will have read and right access while nobody else will\nchown example_user /yourfile\nchmod 700 /yourfile\n\n\nA: You can make the file SIP-protected with\nxattr -w com.apple.rootless (file)\n\nThat prevents any change until you reverse it with -d instead of -w\nBut it is still readable unless you first use chmod 000 (file)\nDoing it on a directory protects the whole directory.\nAnother way is to active Apache, put the file in /Library/Webserver/Documents, make it accessible only to user https, and protect it with .htpasswd\n", "Q: iMessage issue when being sent to cell number A friend of mine has iPhone 4S with iOS 5.0. I can iMessage him using his apple id fine. However, when I try to use his cellphone number, I never get the light blue send button. It stays green all the time. This seems very strange to me. Any explanations?\n\nA: iMessage sends a text message to get activated on the first boot of the phone. Maybe this text message didn't arrived at Apple, so that his iMessage is only activated for use with his Apple ID. \nHe could try to deactivate and reactive iMessage.\n", "Q: Is AFP (specifically Time Machine) encrypted on the wire? I've been hunting for the answer to this, but I have not found it.  When I back up my laptop using Time Machine to a remote Time Machine server (Time Capsule, or Mac Mini with an external drive), is the data on the network encrypted?\nNote that I don't care about the encryption of the data on the hard drives at either end, just about the ethernet/wifi in the middle.\n\nA: Short answer, no it's not. As with most of the file transfer protocols(SMB, FTP, NFS) it transfers data in plain text. \n\nA: If the WiFi has encryption, it is encrypted over-the-air.\nHowever, wired ethernet is not encrypted or protected in any way.\n\nA: Your password for authentication may be encrypted depending on what you are authenticating to, but the AFP transfer is not encrypted. \n\nA: Encrypt the data before it's sent over the wire:\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/ph25615?locale=en_US\n", "Q: Why does my iPod display \"Artist Unknown\" after I entered in the artists in iTunes? I had a bunch of songs on iTunes that didn't have artist names, so consequently, I didn't have artist names on my iPod touch. I added artist names to all the songs I have on iTunes and now the artist names are not even showing up on my iPod. It just says \"Artist Unknown\" I really have no idea what to do. Can someone help me?\n\nA: I faced the same issue after upgrading my iPod touch to iOS 5.1.1. I ended up restoring it to factory settings, and setting to auto-sync with iTunes (I ordinarily prefer to sync it manually!). I also had to change not only all \"artist\" names but also \"album artist\" names, as the new software appears to list the music according to album artists.\n\nA: I had the same weird problem. After you download a music or something, be sure to check if the file is \"read only\" in properties. just uncheck it, make you changes on the file (album artwork, composers, album name etc.).\n", "Q: iOS App Store download data Does anyone know if there is public data App downloads from the iOS App Store?\nNot so much how many downloads has a particular app had, but data like:\n\n\n*\n\n*how many apps have zero downoads.\n\n*how many apps have a hundred downloads.\n\n*how many app have a thousand downloads.\n\n*what's the download numbers over time for apps on average.\n\n\nThat kinda thing.   \n\nA: There is no publicly available data on the actual iTunes App Store download counts (except for occasional special events such as the 25 billionth app download contest, and a few individual developer reports).  The exact app download numbers are considered confidential information between Apple and each developer (perhaps because an individual's earnings could be so deduced).  Each developer has access only to the counts for their own apps.\nThat said, a few developers do report some of their download numbers; and there are various estimations of the download distribution curve based on this evidence: for instance this blog post, and this academic paper, both from 2011, which may or may not be accurate.  (Disclosure, the blog post is mine.)\nAs for part #4 of your question, the \"on average\" answer may not be relavant, as the app download distribution may be so skewed that almost no app has a download count that is anywhere close to the mean average, but mostly a lot more or a lot less.  For instance, whatever the big mean average number is, there are some reports that most apps get downloaded less than once per day.\n", "Q: Does OSX have a hidden \"Device Manager\" list like Windows? Back in the Windows world there was a Device Manager control panel that would list all the devices that were connected to your computer.\nThere was even an option to show \"hidden devices\", basically a list of items like thumb-drives, SD cards, etc. that were once connected to your PC.\nI'm just curious if something like this exists in OSX? Is there a list of devices that are connected or ever were connected?\n\nA: Search for System Information in Lion or later (or System Profiler in Snow Leopard and earlier versions of Mac OS) in Spotlight (press ⌘ and Space). \nThe program is in /Applications/Utilities and is the tool to see the connected USB devices and other hardware details. It is quite simliar to Device Manager on Windows.\nAlternatively you can access it via the Apple Menu\n -> About This Mac -> More Info... -> System Report...\n\nThe System Information can save system profiler information to a file, so you could review an older snapshot to see what was connected once, but the Mac OS doesn't record all the devices connected - just the ones actually connected when you run the tool and it scans the current items on the device tree.\n", "Q: Any way to put Mac mini to sleep remotely? I use a Mac mini as a music centre connected to my stereo system (among other things). I control it remotely using apps such as Remote by Apple, Rowmote, and Remoteless (for Spotify), both on my iPhone and iPad.\nNow, when getting to sleep myself, I often want to stop music playback with the device closest to hand, usually iPhone. One more thing I'd like to do remotely is put the Mac mini to sleep. Any idea whether this is possible? \nTo clarify, I'm looking for an app or other solution that works on iPhone / iPad (with latest iOS, not jailbroken).\n\nA: I'm pretty sure you can do this with a hot-corner and the built-in VNC server. (You would need a VNC viewer for iOS, there are LOTS of them.\nYou could also create an applescript:\ntell application \"System Events\" to sleep\nand run it using the VNC connection.\n\nAlternatively, you can turn on ssh, ssh in, and issue the command:\npmset sleepnow (See the pmset man page)\nto put the mac to sleep.\nThis would require a ssh client for iOS. Again, there are a LOT of them. Personally, I have used iSSH, and it works fine.\n\nAs @mankoff stated in a comment, RowMote states in it's store description:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*SLEEP AND WAKE: Put your Mac to sleep by holding the Play button for 3 seconds while controlling any Apple application, just like the\n  hardware remote. Rowmote automatically wakes up sleeping machines\n  which are connected via Ethernet!\n  \n\n\nA: I use the following setup to sleep my Mac by using an iPhone:\n\n\n*\n\n*I created a AppleScript which sleeps the Mac\n\n*Create a rule in Mail.app, which runs the AppleScript. (I use a specific Subject and from Address to activate the rule)\n\n*Then on the iOS device, you just need to send a mail, as soon as the Mac receives the mail it will go to sleep\nAdvantage: You can put your Mac to sleep without the need to be in the same network\nDisadvantage: It could take some minutes until the Mac receives the mail.\n\nA: I use remote mouse\ndownload this app on your iPhone and Mac\nfollow the instruction on the screen\nnow you can make your make sleep and more\n", "Q: Old MacBook power adapter on new MacBook Pro? I have a 60W power adapter from my old 2008 MacBook. \nCan I use this power adapter on a new 13\" MacBook Pro, which also came with a 60W power adapter?\nHowever the two power adapters have two different modell numbers.\nCan there be a problem using the old one on the newer 13\" MacBook Pro?\n\nA: Yes, as long as your new MacBook Pro is of the 13\" variety, then you will have no problems.  \nWhile Power Adapters technically have different model numbers (to associate them during repairs), the wattage is what you need to look at when considering to use on on a machine.  15\"/17\" MacBook Pro's require 85W Power Adapters, where as, the 13\" MacBook Pro and MacBook use 60W Power Adapters.\nHope that clears it up for you.\n", "Q: How to delete one number off call list for iPhone 3GS What app would I need to download and what are the steps to deleting one number at a time My iphone 3GS is already jailbroken.\n\nA: If you're referring to the Phone > Recents listing the solution doesn't require a jailbroken phone. In the upper right corner is an Edit button. It will allow for the individual deletion of calls from this call log.\nIf this is not what you're after please provide some more detail for the question. Thanks.\n\nA: there is no edit button by default..you need to install add-on like cydia. probably newer versions of OS have this edit button added, but i am not sure..\n", "Q: iPhone EXIF/GPS Timestamp - Appears to be based on local settings? I was under the impression that the iPhone received timestamps along with GPS location data. While I can't say its not true for the internal database, it seems to be for the EXIF data attached to photos taken by the iPhone's camera.\nI ran a test by turning off automatic date/time settings, ensuring my correct timezone was set.\nI took a photo (IMG_1692), rolled back the time by two hours and took another (IMG_1693).\nUsing Phil Harvey's EXIF Editor, I retrieved this output:\n$ exiftool IMG_1692.JPG | grep Time\nFile Modification Date/Time     : 2012:04:29 22:51:46+10:00\nExposure Time                   : 1/15\nDate/Time Original              : 2012:04:29 22:51:46\nGPS Time Stamp                  : 13:51:00\n$ exiftool IMG_1693.JPG | grep Time\nFile Modification Date/Time     : 2012:04:29 20:51:32+10:00\nExposure Time                   : 1/15\nDate/Time Original              : 2012:04:29 20:51:32\nGPS Time Stamp                  : 11:40:50\n\nYou can clearly see the two hour difference in the file timestamp, as well as the GPS time!\nAm I correct in this assertion that the GPS timestamp doesn't come from the GPS at all? Or am I missing something?\n\nA: \nAm I correct in this assertion that the GPS timestamp doesn't come\n  from the GPS at all? Or am I missing something?\n\nYour experiment definitely makes it look like that!\nThis very detailed web page Exif Schema for Exif-specific Properties says:\n\nGPS Time Stamp: GPS tag 29 (date), 0x1D, and, and GPS tag 7 (time), 0x07. Time stamp of GPS data, in Coordinated Universal\n  Time. Note: The GPSDateStamp tag is new in EXIF 2.2. The GPS\n  timestamp in EXIF 2.1 does not include a date. If not present, the\n  date component for the XMP should be taken from exif:DateTimeOriginal,\n  or if that is also lacking from exif:DateTimeDigitized. If no date is\n  available, do not write exif:GPSTimeStamp to XMP.\n\nIt looks like what's happening is the File Modification Date/Time shows the local date & time according the phone's clock, in the phone's time zone.\nThis is then converted to Coordinated Universal Time (\"UTC\"), and saved as the GPS Time Stamp.\n", "Q: Why is a command line change to ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist not effective immediately? When the Info window of Finder is used to associate files of a particular type with an application: \n\n\n*\n\n*the preference is effective immediately. \n\n\nWhen Terminal is used to make a comparable addition to ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist\n\n\n*\n\n*the preference is not effective immediately. \n\n\nQuestion\nWhy does Launch Services not immediately respect a write to the user's com.apple.LaunchServices.plist? \nAn ideal answer might be a reference to a page in the Apple Developer area. \nAnswers need not involve running a command. \nBackground\nAgent or daemon?\nWondering whether a daemon or agent makes changes to that .plist effective, I ran: \nsudo launchctl list\nIn the list, under the label heading, I see nothing that might relate to Launch Services. \nReferences\nAn answer to Stack Overflow question How to set default application for specific file types in Mac OS X? suggests: \n\n… to be reloaded. You can logout, wait a few minutes or force launchservices to restart …\n\nIn my case: \n\n\n*\n\n*log out did not have the desired effect\n\n*I used the lsregister approach, but that type of scan is time-consuming.\n\n\nThe accepted answer to Super User question Is there a faster way to change default apps associated with file types on OS X? suggests:\n\n… restarting the OS to apply changes (logging out and back in isn't enough) …\n\n— if a restart suffices, that's probably less time consuming than killing then seeding the Launch Services database. \n\nA: From Apple’s Launch Services Programming Guide (all emphasis mine):\n\nAll applications available on the user’s system must be registered to make them known to Launch Services and copy their document binding and other information into its database. It isn’t ordinarily necessary to perform this task explicitly, since a variety of utilities and services built into the Mac OS X system software take care of it automatically:\n\n*\n\n*A built-in background tool, run whenever the system is booted or a new user logs in, automatically searches the Applications folders in the system, network, local, and user domains and registers any new applications it finds there. (This operation is analogous to “rebuilding the desktop” in earlier versions of Mac OS.)\n\n*The Finder automatically registers all applications as it becomes aware of them, such as when they are dragged onto the user’s disk or when the user navigates to a folder containing them.\n\n*When the user attempts to open a document for which no preferred application can be found in the Launch Services database, the Finder presents a dialog asking the user to select an application with which to open the document. It then registers that application before launching it.\n\nIn spite of these automatic registration utilities, it may sometimes be necessary to register an application explicitly with Launch Services. For example, although developers are encouraged to package their applications so that they can be installed by simply dragging them onto the user’s disk, some applications may require more elaborate custom installer software. In such cases, the installer should call one of the Launch Services registration functions LSRegisterFSRef or LSRegisterURL to register the application explicitly.\n\nNote the API calls needed by the only named manual registration procedure (source not available on opensource.apple.com, I’m afraid).\nWhile working around a bug in processing of Launch Services on Leopard with FileVault enabled, I noticed that ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist is:\n\n*\n\n*processed only on login after boot, as input data to the buildup of the Launch Services database proper (FileVault-enabled Leopard often failed to do this step, resulting in seemingly lost user settings); and\n\n\n*cached as long as the machine is not rebooted.\nSimply put, it’s the user domain persistence layer of Launch Services, and modifications to that persistence layer are only acknowledged on next processing – reboot or reseed.\n", "Q: Hard Drives shows up in Finder, but not Desktop In the past when I have plugged in external hard-drives they would always show up on the desktop. I'm not sure if it is because of a software update or the drive itself but it's no longer showing up.\nThe drive is working because if I go to Finder I can access the drive.\nHow can I change the settings so that drives show up on the desktop when they are plugged in?\nI'm using OSX version: 10.7.3.\n\nA: You probably have accidentally unchecked \"Hard disks\" from the Finder Preference pane (accessible with ⌘ +  , ). Just check the box,\n\nand you should be good to go!\n", "Q: How to backup Store Apps? I have been searching and I didn't find an optimal solution for my problem. I have some apps purchased from the Mac App Store (Pixelmator, GarageBand), and other ones installed (Xcode).\nI want to know is there an efficient way to backup this apps, and reinstall them after I do a fresh install of my system.\nP.S. I want to do this because Xcode's download size is too big, and my internet connection isn't the better around... Same with other apps.\n\nA: The receipt data from the Mac App Store is stored inside the application bundles, so anything that backs up your Applications folder will do the trick. You don't need to worry about your proof-of-purchase being saved in some other location on your hard disk.\nTime Machine is probably the simplest to set up, as it will back up your entire hard disk.\n", "Q: How to disable \"Sync Apps\" and \"Open iTunes when this iDevice is connected\" without forcing a sync? I don't want to lose all the stuff on my device. Any way to stop my iPad from automatically syncing with iTunes when connected to the Mac? I turned these features on when I bought it, but in the long run it's not such a great idea.\n\nA: If you go in to iTunes and go to Preferences -> Devices, and check the box that says Prevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing automatically. \n\n\nA: Try going to Edit-> Preferences-> Syncing to disable syncing.\n", "Q: How can I demo a website via an iPad? I've developed a proof-of-concept that I'll need to demo on a projector (VGA) and I'd like to use the iPad to demo it. I'd like to mirror the page with as little lag as possible, as the proof uses a lot of CSS transitions - the perception of the app may be degraded if it looks laggy.\nI've looked at the VGA accessory, but it looks like that does NOT support Safari mirroring. I've also looked at the new Apple TV, but converting from HDMI to VGA may not be possible. Is there any way to do this, short of using a document camera or something similar?\n\nA: It is quite difficult to convert VGA to HDMI because HDMI is digital, and VGA is analog.  It can be done, but the solution is often overpriced, and not worth it.  In my opinion, you should buy an HD projector, but if you can't then I would try something like AirServer and mirror it to your Mac and then connect your Mac to the projector.  Hope this helps!  In the meantime, I'll look for more solutions.\n\nUpdate August 5, 2016:\nApple now sells a lightening to VGA adapter.\n\nA: If you happen to have a jailbroken iPad, you can use the tweak DisplayOut to mirror the iPad screen on various kinds of displays - that page explains the configurations it supports.\n", "Q: Hostname changes in the terminal when connecting to some wifi networks When I connect to some wifi networks my computer hostname changes in the terminal - is this normal? Is there a way I can prevent this from happening?\n\nA: OS X normally gets the hostname from a reverse lookup of the IP address the machine has. When you're on DHCP, that means your hostname can change. If you want to force a hostname, you can edit /etc/hostconfig (use the cli editor of your choice, you'll need to use sudo) and change HOSTNAME=-AUTOMATIC- to HOSTNAME=NameYouWant\n\nA: On Lion (at least), the best way to achieve this is by running scutil:\nsudo scutil --set HostName NAME\n\nreplacing NAME with the hostname you want. Note that /etc/hostconfig is deprecated, if you can believe a comment at the top of the file. \n", "Q: Running 2 Apple ID's from the same PC Both my husband and I have an iPhone 4. When my husband tries to use his ID on his phone mine will pop up and he can't change it. When he goes into his settings his ID is there. This only started when I plugged my phone into the PC. \nCan 2 ID's be run from the same PC?\n\nA: Based on an incomplete understanding of the problem, I think you want to click on the \"Store\" section of your Settings app on the iPhone. From Store, you can click on the Apple ID and then choose \"Sign Out.\" You will then be able to \"Sign In\" as a different user.\n\n\nA: \nBoth my husband and I have an iPhone 4. When my husband tries to use his ID on his phone mine will pop up and he can't change it. When he goes into his settings his ID is there. This only started when I plugged my phone into the PC.\nCan 2 ID's be run from the same PC?\n\nAs the other posted have said, this is an incomplete question, but I infer that you have installed apps from each others' Apple IDs to the same phone. For example, if I am running iTunes as my own ID on my phone, but I try to update an app that was purchased by my wife with her ID, I will be prompted for her ID and password in order to do the update. To me, this sounds like what you're seeing on your phone which you are both sharing.\nTo answer your question, yes, 2 IDs can be run from the same PC, just as 2 IDs can run on the same phone... but NOT at the same time. That's the key. As the posted shows above, only one ID can be logged into the Store at one time though.\n", "Q: iCal shows an event that the Google Calendar doesn't have? I subscribed to a google calendar and all was going well until today that I saw an event on iCal and when checking on the web the event isn't there.\nI synced with ⌘+R and ⌘+⇧+R and the event is still showing, the event is a repeating one on google calendar that in the date it shows on iCal was deleted on Google.\niCal version 5.0.2\n\nA: I've seen this same problem when I use ical for Outlook synching.  Drives me crazy.  Today I figured out a solution.  Go to your Google calendar and \"Search\" for the offending meeting (just use some key word).  In my case, it found the meetings.  I simply expanded the meeting info in the search results and it allowed me to delete the meeting.  Then, give Outlook some time to resynch and it will be gone.\n", "Q: Can't get OS X installed on this ancient, formatted eMac Many years ago I was bequeathed an eMac. I believe it's a 1 GHz G4. It's been sitting around doing nothing for a long time, but now I need to install realMYST Mac edition, from 2002, and it's my best bet.\nI was given three OS X install discs with the eMac: A 10.0 disc, an eMac Software Restore disc (that says it has Panther on it), and also a set of Panther upgrade discs. Unfortunately, the eMac refuses to boot from either the 10.0 disc or the Restore disc. It will boot from the Panther Upgrade disc, but I can't install it because the hard drive is blank and doesn't have a previous version of OS X on it!\nIs there some file on the disc I could delete, some plist I could change or something, to make this installer not do the upgrade check? Or does anyone have any ideas on how to get it to boot from the restore disc?\nEDIT to clarify:\nThe discs that the eMac won't boot from are in perfect condition and entirely readable by other Macs; the eMac simply won't boot from them. But it boots perfectly every single time from the Panther Upgrade disc. And the Panther Upgrade disc is way more scratched up (to the naked eye, anyway) than the others.\nApparently this eMac shipped with OS X 10.3 Panther. The restore discs claim to have Panther on them. But the eMac won't boot from the restore disc, even though it boots from the Panther Upgrade disc.\n\nA: You are in a bit of a pickle, but not one you can't escape. :)\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have another ancient Mac, you could use probably use target disk mode (hold T when booting) to install a version of Mac OS X on it.\n\n*If you don't have another Mac, take the 10.3 Restore disc to a local video store and pay a few dollars for it to be resurfaced. You'd be surprised how bad a CD can look before and still work after. I recommend this over the other approaches, because the Restore CD probably contains software you won't be able to get any other way. (Of course, don't read this as a guarantee that the 10.3 CD will work when resurfaced, but I think it's a good bet.)\n\n*Failing that, you should try to get a Retail 10.3 or 10.4 (Tiger) CD. I think you'd want to upgrade to Tiger anyway on this system.\n\n\nA few more notes, assuming your eMac is really 1GHz (it's definitely a G4, they all are):\n\n\n*\n\n*Your eMac requires a special build of 10.2. You should be able to use a 10.3 or 10.4 retail CD, but you're not going to be able to use a 10.2 retail CD. That 10.0 CD? I don't think any eMac will boot off a 10.0 CD.\n\n*If the eMac is faster than 1GHz, it may require a special build of 10.3 and you won't be able to use a retail 10.3 CD.\n\n\nPersonally, I found 10.4 the best version of Mac OS X for running Classic Mac apps. So if you can't get the restore CD to work (or even if you can), it's worth keeping an eye open for a 10.4 Retail CD.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wikipedia: eMac Specifications\n\nA: The restore disk will work on the old eMac, I remember working on those things, they looked as big and bulky as they really are. \nThe eMacs had two major issues with them. \n\n\n*\n\n*Sound card failed. It was a known issue, and Apple at the time if you had your cert, allowed you to repair them. \n\n*The CD drive failed. Which it sounds like your may of, if you can read other CDs then it may be that the CDs that it came with either is not compatible with the machine or the firmware may of been updated, and caused the computer to no longer recognize the disks as compatible. Which sometimes was a known issue. \n\n\nOn a side note you never stated how you were attempting to get your computer into booting from the CD... there are multiple ways to try. \nThe easiest way to see if the disk are even being recognized as a boot disk is as the computer is starting to press and hold down the shift key while the computer is booting. Don't let go until the screen shows all drives that are bootable. \nIf your CDs are ever going to be recognizable it is going to be here.\nAlso, and I hate to say this, but make sure you have the correct CD in when you start up, otherwise I really can't guarantee you will ever see the CD. \nYou can also eject the CD from this screen as well, so if it doesn't show up, you should be able to eject the CD from there, and try other disk.\nIf this doesn't work, really your only other choice is getting a friend with an old computer and external HD case and install the OS on the drive. \nTo get to the drive you need to unscrew the back, if I remember correctly they were still using star bits back then, #5 I believe. I may be wrong, but if you need help taking the computer apart ask, I may be able to still get the repair guide for the eMac and tell you how to fix any issues hardware wise you may have with it. \n", "Q: iMac secret feature or application? I found this presumably hidden feature by accident; my keyboard fell so I picked it up.  When I did, my background looked like it was in space, the Finder window was open and in the middle of the background there was the sun. On the side a new menu bar showed up; one option said \"Today\" and the other option, I think, said \"Tomorrow.\" It just looked like my background was traveling through space, it was cool; kind of like when you reboot your computer and it gives you that Apple outerspace show.\nMy question is: how do i open that feature or application and what is it for?\n\nA: If it looked like this:\n\nyou just entered Time Machine. From Apple:\n\nTime Machine is the built-in backup that works with your Mac and an external drive (sold separately) or Time Capsule. Connect the drive, assign it to Time Machine, and start enjoying some peace of mind. Time Machine automatically backs up your entire Mac, including system files, applications, accounts, preferences, music, photos, movies, and documents. But what makes Time Machine different from other backup applications is that it not only keeps a spare copy of every file, it remembers how your system looked on any given day—so you can revisit your Mac as it appeared in the past.\n\nIt's not a hidden feature but it does aim to stay unobtrusive and out-of-the-way until you need it.\nYou can get to Time Machine any time you want by clicking this icon in your menu bar and selecting Enter Time Machine.\n\nIf you don't see the Time Machine icon in your menu bar go to System Preferences -> Time Machine and make sure the Show Time Machine status in menu bar option is checked.\n\nA: What you most likely opened was Time Machine, that is, if your screen looked like this:\n\nThis is not at all a hidden feature of Mac OS X, but a very popular one.  I don't know what the keyboard shortcut is, but somehow, you activated the application.\nClick here to read more about Time Machine.\n", "Q: Maximum number of pages on iPad, and maximum apps in a folder? For some reason, after I installed many apps (because a company made them free Apr 27 to 29), and then, the icons don't appear at all, and there was no warning.\nAnd I started to wonder, are there maximum number of pages?  And so I created some folders and put existing apps in them, and the other apps magically appeared. (I forgot if I restarted iPad in order to see them).\nAnd there seems to be maximum 20 apps per folder.\nI just wonder why there was no warning whatsoever given iPad and Apple products are usually very well designed and user friendly. Are there official pages that describe this situation?\n\nA: There is a maximum of 11 pages of apps on your iPad.  Those that don't show up can be launched by swiping all the way left to the iPad spotlight, and searching for the app title.  As for maximum number of apps in a folder, I was able to fit 20 (as you mentioned). \nI was not able to find any official documentation regarding this matter.\n", "Q: How to save a .css file from TextEdit or Word? I once read you could force the color of visited links in Safari by adding a:visited { color: #6611cc !important; } in the .css file under Preferences < Advanced. In this way, it will turn every link you've clicked on purple and by so override the actual web design.\nI like the idea but I tried to do so, but TextEdit or Word won't allow me to save the file. It wants to add .rtf, .webdesign or other extensions behind the .css.\nHow can I force to add this to the .css file? \n\nA: Although it doesn't directly answer your question, personally, I would use something like Textwrangler (free) instead, which is much better suited for jobs like this. \n\nA general-purpose text editor for light-duty composition, data-file\n  editing (where the data files consist of plain [unstyled] text), and\n  manipulation of text-oriented data.\n\nYou won't run into any of the issues you described (including the fact that rtf is formatted text and what you want is plain text - although you can switch to plain text in TextEdit) and you can name the file whatever you wish. You'll also get syntax highlighting which helps too.\n\n\nA: First, use TextEdit, don't use Word.\nBefore you save your document, select Make Plain Text from the Format menu. (If the menu says Make Rich Text then you are already in plain text mode.)\nIf you save the document now, you should be able to give it whatever extension you want. Since the file is plain text, you can be sure that TextEdit won't add any additional formatting instructions that will turn it into an incorrectly-formatted CSS file.\n\nA: Save the file then select the file in the Finder. With the file selected in Finder, Choose Get Info (Command - I).\nIn the Name & Extenstion section, rename the file to visited.css. It will likely as if you want to change the extension from something like .rft to .css, click OK and your done. Move the file to wherever you want and select it from within Safari.\n\nA: Just found this while searching for an answer myself - not sure if it's any help now - 4 yrs later \nBut you need to go to 'get info' on the text file\nAnd then remove \".txt\" from the name & extention\nDone!\n", "Q: Using hotcorners to move between spaces/desktops I would like to use hot corners to move between desktop/spaces. Right now, the only way to move between desktop with a mouse, is to go via Mission Control and clicking on the desired desktop. I want something faster without using keyboard shortcuts.\nIs there any programs available or is there a code I should edit? \n\nA: If you have a magic mouse with gestures turned on you can two finger swipe left or right to scroll through the desktops.\n\nA: You can try CornerClick, which will allow you to add some default actions on hot corners. \nAnd if you want to find some more tips and trucs about hot corners and your mouse, I can suggest you read this article.\n", "Q: Is there a way to make the iPad stay in the App Store when you buy an app? This has infuriated me since I got my iPad. If I am buying multiple Apps the iPad takes me to my Desktop after I buy each app, meaning I have to go back to the app store.\nIs there a way to tell it to stay in the appstore when I buy an app?\n\nA: There is no official way to do so, but if you've jailbroken your iPad, you can use StayOpened. It's a Cydia Tweak and I can highly recommend it. It does exactly what you want.\n", "Q: downgrade from iOS 5.1 I've clicked \"Erase all settings\" on my iPhone 3GS and it went into a locked state where I couldn't get to the login screen in any way. I then decided to upgrade to 5.1 but forgot to save the SHSH.\nIs there any way to downgrade to 4.2.1 or at least something different than 5.1?\nThanks!\n\nA: You may actually have some SHSH blobs saved for your device, since Cydia automatically tries to save any available SHSH blobs every time you open Cydia. Also, I believe Apple is still signing iOS 4.1 for iPhone 3GS (I don't know why though).\nYou can use TinyUmbrella (a free tool compatible with OS X and Windows) to check your saved SHSH - plug your device into your computer, click the \"Advanced\" tab in TinyUmbrella, check \"Request SHSH from Cydia\", and then click \"Save SHSH\".\nIf you find that you have suitable SHSH saved for your device, you can use this guide to stitch the SHSH blobs into custom firmware (using redsn0w) and then restore with that firmware.\n", "Q: How similar is Microsoft Excel for Mac to Excel for Windows? Like the title says - how similar is Microsoft Excel for Mac to Excel for Windows? Is it confusing when you have to keep switching from one to the other when working on a complicated excel file? (For example using a Mac at home and Windows at work). Are the formatting and formula inputs exactly the same? Thanks for any answers! \n\nA: My Excel in the Mac doesn't open some password-protected files of my Windows ExceL: in Windows, the Excel passwords can have an almos limitless number of caracters, but in the Mac the password must be 16 or less.\nThe only solution I found was to reduce the number of characters in the password of the Windows files.\nIf you have Office for Mac 2011, there is a 100 percent compatibility ratio, as described on the BrightHub review.  \nI work with both and personally, I find Excel for Windows much more intuitive and more user friendly, but basically you can do (almost) the same with both versions.\nBut the most important part is, the two versions are 100% compatible with each other.\n\nA: I have Excel for Mac 11 and also use Excel 97, Excel 07 and Excel 10 on various Windows machines.  Needless to say, there is confusion all over the place with the different menus, shortcuts, ribbons.  Shortcuts are different, keyboards are different.  They do the same things, and that really depends on how complex your spreadsheets are as I think even with newer software, most people don't get too complex with Excel, be prepared that it will have to be done differently from machine to machine.  I think MS will let you do a trial so can get get a feel for it.\n\nA: Your mileage may vary depending on your requirements.\nVisual Basic Applications (VBA) macros while supported in Excel 2011 don't always work when they were set up in Excel for Windows. Also ActiveX controls do not work in Excel 2011. \nI wouldn't call that 100% compatibility but it is a lot better than previous versions of Excel for Mac.\n\nA: I'm an advanced Office 2003/7 Excel user (Windows).  I've recently been using Excel for Mac 2011 and while you can do a lot of things with the Mac version, learning how to do them a different way for Mac makes it a royal pain in the proverbial.  Ultimately, all the design has gone into the first Windows version and in the Windows environment is an awesome tool.  On a complex file, you might as well be learning a new application. I don't have the time to effectively learn a new application, so will be Windowsizing my Mac solely to use Office.  \n", "Q: Screen share between OS X and iOS Anyone knows any application that will allow me to share my OS X Lion screen with an iPhone? I don't care to have it over the Internet, WiFi is sufficient. \n\nA: I've been using Remoter VNC for a while now and I'm quite happy with the result. Their website covers most of it's features, so I suggest you take a look and find out yourself if it fits your needs.\n\n\nA: The title of the question says iOS, so here's an iPad solution. \nI use DisplayPad (currently $2.99 USD). It's great because it's got close to zero configuration parameters: it just works. My Mac treats the iPad like a second monitor.\nIt doesn't work on the iPhone as far as I'm aware.\n\nA: I recommend the free app VNC Viewer by RealVNC, available on iOS, OS X, and Windows. The app is barebones and the icon looks from the 80s but it works perfectly, simply, fast, and, it's free. \nI don't recommend TeamViewer, it requires you to run another piece of software at all times on the sharing computer, and can cause heavy resource usage on that computer, in addition to causing other major bugs (it did for me anyway). The only good thing about it is that it can share audio, which VNC does not do.\nJust open the app, create a new profile, and put in your mac's IP address. (Also, you must enable screen sharing in the mac system preferences/sharing if it's not already.)\nYou can also access remotely if you forward the VNC port (5900) to your mac in router, and signup for a dynamic dns service (free to set up with some routers), this can be very useful sometimes.\n\nA: Teamviewer app works great. You just register a user name and password, add a device via a code from the teamviewer app you installed on it, and voila, it works. I have this on most of my gadgets, and each one can see the others.. well, the mobile apps can interact with the PCs/servers/laptops and so forth. \nOh, and it's free for home use, works over wifi or internet/remotely, with no need for port forwarding or anything.\n", "Q: New iPad camera button I am trying to draw a button in my iOS app which would look exactly like a button in camera App of the new iPad (like on this image)\nSince I don't have the new iPad, I can't check it by my own. But what I want to know is, how does this button look like if the background is dark, and if it is some complicated image behind, not just smooth blurred single color as on their screenshot. If somebody has the screenshots of camera app when background is not so ideal, I would appreciate if you share them. Or maybe somebody has values of colors, gradients, sizes, which are used in this button, then it would also be great to see.\nThank you.\n\nA: It's a semi-transparent image.

I've used one display with the computer for a long time, but recently acquired the second display.\nGiven that I have these two monitors, what are my realistic options for using both with the same MacBook Pro? What is the current state of multi-monitor support? Moving to a Thunderbolt display is not an option. \n\nA: I've looked into this in the past, and from what I know, you have a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'd never really recommend it, you can get a usb adaptor that essentially adds another display port to your computer.  Make sure the one you pick is Mac compatible - there are some that exist.\n\n*DualHead2Go is an interesting product that emulates a single double-wide monitor to your computer.  There are some catches:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is a maximum resolution the device supports\n\n*It works best if the monitors are the same dimensions and resolution\n\n*It's currently ~$230\n\n*The computer doesn't see the monitors separately, which means that when you configure/use it, it will act accordingly.  If you put the menubar on the external 'monitor,' it will stretch across both; maximized windows will be two monitors wide etc.\n\n\n*I can't find anything to back it up at the moment, but at one point I do believe I saw an ExpressPort/34 video card or a breakout box for a PCI card.  The only thing I can find now is XGP, but I'm near certain I saw a Mac-specific solution at one point.\nEach has its benefits and drawbacks.  If you're not on a tight budget and your monitors will work for it, I'd recommend the DualHead2Go.\n", "Q: 27\" iMac SSD + HDD Migration from old iMac 10.7.3 I've just purchased a 27\" iMac and am planning on installing a SSD (256 gig) to act as my boot drive.  I was wondering if it would be possible to:\n1) Install Lion on to the new iMac \n2) Create my user account\n3) Move the new user account to the HDD that came with the iMac\n4) Use Migration Assistant to migrate my old user account into my new iMac?\nThe current Home folder/Music/Photos and home movies is nearly 400 gigs of information.  \nI've read here where users utilize migration assistant twice (once for apps, then move home folder, then data) or manually move the data\n\nA: Besides the obvious issue of you having too much information to load onto the SSD, I've done this basic procedure in the past.  However, it's much easier now using Time Machine, but you have a few options:\n\nTime Machine\nIf you don't currently have a backup that can hold all your data, do yourself a favor and pick up a drive that can.  Time Machine should be built into the OS you're currently running.\nDo the backup.  For 400 GB, you probably want to set it up before you go to sleep and let it run overnight.  Once  it's complete, unmount the drive and unplug it from the computer.  Go through with the drive install and then install Lion.  When the computer reboots, before you start to work with the setup assistant, plug in the new drive.  At some point it will prompt you for a location from which to migrate data.  Select your backup.  Let it run for a while and when you get back, it will contain all the data you backed up, in a usable form.  This is my current favorite method for cloning user workstations.\n\nSuper Duper\nIf you can't get an external backup, you can use SuperDuper to create a full-system backup from the active system disk.  You'll have the ability to trim the data to the size of the disk to which you're copying in the interface.  This route is a little more technical and requires a bit more time hands-on.\n\nFile Copy\nI wouldn't recommend copying a user folder for a logged-in user due to open  preferences files.  You'll get all kinds of \"File In Use\" errors and it will probably exit the copy prematurely.  Instead (if you're dead-set on using this method - which I advise against) create a second admin user and copy the folder over into a temporary location before staging it into the actual /Users/ location.  You'll also need to make sure the permissions for the entire folder are set so that the user whose home you are copying can actually access and write to their files.  To do this, you can use the Finder's Get Info on the folder and then add the user to have full permissions.  Once it's staged into the /Users/ folder, you can log back in to the main user and delete the secondary admin.  You may have permissions issues in the future using this method.\nAll that said, it's totally worth it to get an external to back up to for Time Machine to clone your new SSD from.\n", "Q: How do I close the source of an AppleScript application? When saving an AppleScript as an application, you can view the source by looking in the package contents.

Check that when you save.\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to default ALL new reminders/calendar events to have an alert? I like my iPhone, but one thing that REALLY bugs me is that EVERY time I create an event I have to manually set an alert.  \n(One has to wonder why Apple thinks that I would add an entry into my calendar and NOT want an alert.  At the very least this should be configurable - to do some default.)\nI am hoping there is such a setting that I have overlooked.  Is there?\n\nA: Yes, there's a setting!\nSettings->Mail, Contacts, Calendars->Default Alert Times->Events\n", "Q: How can I disable gestures on a particular workspace? Is it possible to disable trackpad gestures I don't want to trigger on a particular workspace?\nI have virtualbox fullscreen on one of my workspaces and I'd like for mouse gestures to not trigger when I am on that workspace.\n\nA: This is not a feature provided by OS X.\nYou have to disable unwanted gestures in System Preferences → Trackpad and then use a third-party tool to enable customized gestures.\nE.g. You can use BetterTouchTool to define gestures on a per-app basis. This will allow to simply not set set any gestures for virtualbox.\n\n", "Q: AppleTV 3 wakes iMac every 10 minutes Until recently, I left my iMac (27\" late 2009) on all the time. I now want to sleep it when not in use, but also wake it remotely via my AirPort Extreme. All this is working fine. The iMac is set to sleep after 6 minutes.\nI have an AppleTV 3 and when powered on (but sleeping) it causes the iMac to wake every ten minutes. greping for wake in system.log shows a bonjour service connection approximately every 10 minutes. After lots of mDNS debugging I narrowed it down to the AppleTV (there are iPads and phones and other Macs around, it wasn't my first thought). Unplugging the AppleTV proved this - the iMac has been asleep for 8 hours now.\nI do have home sharing enabled. This is pretty much all it's used for.\nHas anyone come across this before and know what's going on?\n\nA: After Apple TV Software Update 5.1, I comfirmed this issue was resolved.\nTry to update your FW!\nThe following my old comment is for old FW. I leave it just for knowledge.\nI had have same problems. I know Snow Leopard's mDNSresponder wakes a Mac every 2 hours during sleep. So a similar thing occurs on AppleTV every 10 minutes, I guess. \nIn my case, AppleTV woke my Mac If I set Home Sharing on it. So, 1st option is disabling HomeSharing.\nHowever, I didn't want to do that. So now I avoided this to kill iTunes before Mac sleep. This means it doesn't register Home Sharing service for sleep proxy.\nNote: \n 1. You have to wake up your Mac by some method(http, ssh, magic packet or something) when you want to use your Home Sharing.\n 2. You cannot use sleepWatcher to make 2nd option because it's too late for killing iTunes after sleep trigger. So you must check IDLE time and sleep timer.\n\nA: Switching my AppleTV 3 to WiFi has proven to be a valid solution to this.\nI am unsure if the issue with wired networking is with the AppleTV itself or my network, but suffice to say for now that the network doesn't cause any other noticeable problems.\n", "Q: Does overcharging a MacBook degrade its life? I have an early 2011 13\" MacBook Pro and I use it almost like a desktop. I leave the power cord connected all the time. Is this OK? Am I ruining the computer or diminishing its lifespan?\n\nA: There are mixed opinions about this.  Some say it'll shorten the battery's lifespan, others say the intelligent charging circuitry will prevent that from happening.  I've always discharged the battery totally at least once a month as per Apple's guidelines.  You can also see they do not recommend leaving it charged in all the time.  Even their own guidelines aren't clear.\n\nA: Here's my insights from eight years of laptop using experience.\nThe laptops that I've mainly used as a desktop (and left plugged in for the majority of the time) have all had their batteries lose a considerable amount of charge capacity within one year.  A couple of batteries lost 80% of their charge just past a year of use.\nWhen I've used them more on-the-go, I saw no giant reductions in charge capacity over a two year span.\nI now try to fully discharge the battery at least once per month.  Six months with a late 2011 MBP 15\", and I see no difference in capacity.\nSo, my history indicates two points:\n\n\n*\n\n*fully discharging the battery will help to some degree\n\n*batteries and charge controllers are better now than 5 years ago\n\n\nA: As an AAST for close to 20 years, I recommend to my clients to leave the computer connected to the power adapter and only use on the battery when necessary but being sure to cycle the battery once every 2-3 weeks (for Lithium Ion batteries. I also recommend using the Reminders app or the Calendar app to setup a recurring reminder to cycle the battery.\nThe life of the battery is determined by the combination of charge cycles and full charge capacity (FCC) against specification. You will not find the FCC specification publicly. You can take your computer into an Apple Retail store (be sure to make an appointment) to have a diagnostic run that will provide you the results. This information is important as it relates to the warranty you have remaining on the entire computer. If your battery falls below 80% FCC but is under the break point for cycles, (device specific) the battery will be covered under your warranty as a bad battery. If the battery exceeds the cycle count by even one, the battery will be considered consumed and you will have to pay for a new one regardless of warranty status and the FCC.\nThe current generation of Apple portables have cycle counts that exceed 700, so the chances of your battery becoming consumed before your warranty (either limited or extended) expires will be very low using the aforementioned approach.\n\nA: All Macs cease charging and let you know this by changing the \"orange\" LED in the charging cable to \"green\" when the battery is topped off and you are merely running the Mac - not charging it.\nThe question you ask would be more precisely worded - what harm is it in keeping the battery constantly and always topped off to full?\n\nYour early 2011 13\" MacBook Pro has a lithium ion battery. Luckily, lithium ion batteries have an internal circuit to prevent the battery from being charged over 100%. There is a very slight chance that something can go wrong with the charging mechanism in the laptop, which would cause the battery to overcharge, but I wouldn't be concerned with that.\nYears back, laptop batteries were made from nickel-cadmium or nickel metal hydride. It was recommended that these batteries were regularly fully discharged then fully charged so they'd continue to hold a full charge, though even following these practices they would eventually lose capacity.\nApple still recommends that you fully discharge your battery monthly, and never store your laptop with a charge below 50% for an extended period of time. In short, it's perfectly acceptable to leave your laptop plugged in while it's in use but let it fully discharge once a month for optimal battery health.\n\nA: i always try to fully discharge my MacBook air battery so i can keep it healthy, apple support says that cycles can keep health your MB even if you complete one cycle in a period of 4 days.\nthis link may help you :) Apple's battery support\n", "Q: Some windows in OS X Lion do not move to foreground when taking focus I have two windows open (so far I think this has only happened when at least one of the windows is a Finder window, though I'm not sure if that fact is essential to the problem), and I click the one in the background. The previously-focused window changes shade to show that it has lost focus and the now-in-focus window also changes shade to show that it has gained focus, but no matter how many times I click it, it doesn't come to the foreground. I have to try cycling between the windows in order to successfully move-to-background the out-of-focus window and move-to-foreground the in-focus one. Why would this happen? I've never seen such behavior in older versions of OS X and don't think it's a Lion \"feature\" either.\nEDIT: Screenshot attached showing behavior in 10.8\n\n\nA: I've noticed this in versions of OS X as far back as Panther. It seems to happen more often with apps that use heavily tweaked windows (like Microsoft Office, Adobe apps, or Java apps, particularly Eclipse).\nIt's just a bug in the app. File a report with the vendor if you want and maybe they'll be able to fix it.\n", "Q: Run Minecraft Server using OSX Lion Server? Is it possible to run a Minecraft server using an OSX Lion server? I know that this is a very basic question.\n\nA: Yes. You don't even need to have the Sever edition of Lion. Here is how:\n\n\n*\n   \n*Download minecraft_server.jar from the Minecraft website\n   \n*Open terminal and paste the command listed below (there should be a space after -jar\n\n*Drag the minecraft_server.jar into the Terminal window and type nogui. Then hit enter. Your server should start up.\n\n\nRead this article on the Minecraft Wiki for more information.\njava -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar\n\n\nA: Sure is\nJust down load the .jar sever file and run it with command line that minecraft suggests\n\nA: It is possible to run the Minecraft server on Mac OS X Lion Server as well as on Mac OS X Lion. Keep in mind that Mac OS X Lion Server is an additional package of server applications, services and tools on top of OS X Lion. You need it if you want any of the services provided by OS X Server.\nIf you intend to run the Minecraft server at all times, the proper solution is to start it as a deamon using launchd. See here.\nThis allows you to always get the Minecraft server running on system startup without having to open a user session. This way if your computer crashes and reboots you don't have to relaunch the server or login to automatically launch it.\n", "Q: Running a gpg shell script to decrypt a file via Automator I regularly need to decrypt a gpg-encrypted file (always the same) to simply view it in TextEdit. I have a very simple shell script for that. It looks like this:\n#!/bin/sh\noutfile=`mktemp -t $$`  # Temporary file name\ngpg --output $outfile --decrypt /path/to/file.gpg\nopen -a TextEdit $outfile\nsleep 1\nrm $outfile\n\nWhen run from the terminal, all goes well. GPG asks for my passphrase in a pop-up window, TextEdit comes up, the temp file is deleted and all is great. Not so in Automator. I select \"Run Shell Script\", ignore the shell script input, paste the contents of the script (except for the first line). TextEdit pops up with a blank file and GPG never asks for the passphrase. I tried using the full path to GPG but that didn't do it. I know virtually nothing of Automator actions so the problem surely comes from me.\nAny help appreciated!\n\nA: The Automator “Run Shell Script” action runs the script in a non-interactive shell (for an explanation of the difference between interactive and non-interactive shells, see the pertinent section of the Advanced Bash Scripting Guide) – there is, simply spoken, no terminal to get user input from. I suppose the gpg utility recognizes this and skips the password prompt (else your script would hang).\nYou should be able to pipe your passphrase to GPG inside such an action using the --passphrase-fd 0 option (see gpg’s man page) , however, i.e.\necho \"passphrase\" |  gpg  --passphrase-fd 0 --output $outfile --decrypt /path/to/file.gpg\n\nYou can securely store your passphrase in the OS X Keychain and retrieve it from there. Although possible via a shell script (the TextMate blog has details on how to achieve that – be sure to read the comments), there are so many gotchas to that I’d recommend  using a bit of AppleScript and Daniel Jalkut’s excellent Usable Keychain Scripting app. Once installed, the following bit of AppleScript will retrieve your password (assuming the account name is “GPG”):\ntell application \"Usable Keychain Scripting\" to get password of first generic item of current keychain whose account is \"GPG\"\n\nEither wrap it in an osascript shell command, i.e.\npassphrase=$(osascript -e '<command above>')\n\nor, as you are using Automator, add an AppleScript action, retrieve the passphrase inside it and pass it to the shell script.\n", "Q: Group windows in Mac OS X Is there a way to group 2 or more windows so that they act together? If I drag one, they all move. If I hide one, they all hide. If I alt-tab to one, they all come in focus, etc.\nThese windows might be in different applications \n\nA: I do believe I understand what you are requesting, and actually find it very interesting. However, this functionality does not exist in the base OS itself (10.5.x | 10.6.x | 10.7.x). An alternative to grouping windows in OS X, that you be interested in, is to utilize Mission Control (10.7) and Expose. In Mission Control you can add a new Desktop and drag your window(s)/Applications into that new Desktop thereby grouping them. They do not have to be like items and this can be done a number of times. Expose does not really cover what you have requested, but still is beneficial in terms of grouping like items.\n\nA: Have you seen Optimal Layout? I've never used it so I can't comment from experience, but the features list in the Mac App Store states:\n\nWindows can STICK TOGETHER\n\nSo, it might have the functionality you're looking for.\n", "Q: Expose on OS X 10.7 Is there a way to get OS X 10.5-type Expose for windows, on OS X 10.7?\nI've found the new \"Mission Control\", but I haven't figured out how to get it to show me all my windows, like before.  It shows me all my applications, but all the windows are piled on top of each other.  If I \"swipe up\" on one of the piles, the windows scoot apart a little ways, so I can see about 3 of them, but of course that means the one I'm looking for is invariably on the bottom of the pile, still.\nIs there any way to get Expose for windows (rather than applications), like OS X used to have?\n\nA: You can turn on App Expose (for some reason in preferences it's not on by default) with a 4 finger gesture which is far better than peeking at window groupings within Mission Control.\n", "Q: Advice about eBook Readers for Mac/PC Forgive me for my ignorance but, I recently purchased an eBook only to find that I also had to download Adobe Digital Editions in order to be able to view it on my Mac.  The PDF that I downloaded in the process is encrypted.  Does this mean that I can only view it using Adobe Digital Editions, or can any ePub Reader (including any that I install under Windows) be able to read it?\nI know that there are many (better) ePub readers out there, the prominent ones of which are listed in the following post.\nWhat could I use to read epub books on OS X?\nIf I now were to install Calibre, for example, would it interfere with Adobe Digital Editions?\nNote that I bought the eBook from http://www.ebook.com.  This is the message I get when I try to double click on the PDF file to open it using Acrobat Reader:\nThis document requires digital rights management (DRM) features supported\nby Adobe Digital Editions. Would you like to open it in Digital Editions now?\n\nThis is the information that I have been able to retrieve about the file using Adobe Digital Editions:\nPermissions set by the publisher\n  Allow viewing: on any device\n  Allow copying: 5 copies with an additional copy accrued every 6 days,\n  capped at 5 copies, on any device\n  Allow printing: 20 pages with an additional page accrued every 1 day\n  12 hours, capped at 20 pages, on any device\n\n\nA: ePub is a digital publishing format, but it's not as straightforward as you might hope, in that not all ePub files are the same.  There are 3 main types of ePub in the wild today:\n\n\n*\n\n*Straight ePub, any ePub reader should be able to open these\n\n*ePub with Digital Rights Management protection:\n\n*\n\n*Adobe Digital Editions\n\n*Apple iBooks from the iBooks store\n\n\n\nThe protection mechanisms are portable to an extent, you can see the Digital Editions protection on other formats other than ePub.  The main takeaway is that to read the file, you need a compatible reader.  For the non-protected files, that is straightforward enough.  Pretty much anything can read them.  For the protected ones, it's more difficuly.  Adobe protection is compatible with a small number of desktop apps for a bit of extra portability, but iBooks ones can only be opened in iBooks in iOS, full stop.\nIt's a pain, and like the MP3 fuss we are starting to see people dropping DRM entirely from their ebooks.\n\nA: The single most important thing to remember is the point mentioned by stuffe about the iBookstore.  Do not buy books there if you want to read them on your Mac or PC.  They can only be read on an iOS device, and some (those in .ibooks format) can only be read on an iPad.  No app exists (not ADE or Calibre or any browser add-on) which will let you read a DRM'd iBook on a Mac or PC.\nNot all iBooks have DRM (e.g. those published by O'Reilly do not), but it is impossible to tell which ones fall in that category.\nMost other sources for ebooks I have seen have a FAQ or Help page which explains what software is required to read its books on what devices.\n", "Q: How can you tell if an iPhone camera photo has been fully uploaded to the Photo Stream without using a computer? I'd like to know if the photos were uploaded yet, but an indicator isn't apparent. I'd like to know without resorting to checking a desktop/laptop. Is there one I'm missing?\n\nA: In the photos app, you should be able to compare between the \"camera roll\" and the \"photo stream\" in the albums tab.\nThe picture shouldn't appear in the local device's Photo Stream until it is uploaded.\nTo see this in action, go to the Albums tag. Take a screen shot. (Power + home)\nThe photo will appear in the Camera Roll and (net willing will within a few seconds) then appear in the Photo Stream.\n\nA: It's quite easy to see indeed. If the two images match (left), all photos were uploaded to the Photo Stream. If they don't match (right), some pictures haven't uploaded yet.\n\n\nNB: Photo Stream will only work over Wi-Fi, syncing only the latest 1,000 pictures taken in the last 30 days.\n", "Q: How can I get parallels 6 to run well on my MBP I've been trying to run windows 7 on my MBP on parallels so that I can test different browsers.

I mean really, this should be enough.  Any tips on getting this to actually perform?\n\nA: I had the same issue. Moving the Parallels virtual machine to an external hard drive completely changed it for me, from terrible to tolerable. \nI'm using an old laptop hard drive, 5,400rpm (so not even a fast one), and it works fine.\nAll you need to do is plug in the hard drive,drag the Parallels virtual machine to the hard drive, and double click to open (or go through the Open virtual machine dialogue in Parallels. \n", "Q: User specific hosts file in Mac OS X I'm working on an OS X 10.6.8 machine, for which I do not have superuser privileges.\nI'd like to imitate the effect of adding an entry to the hosts file, i.e. have a certain domain resolve to a certain ip.\nIs it possible to add configuration to my home directory to achieve this?

I can't for the life of me figure out how to print a selected email to PDF using Automator.\nExample - iTunes invoice arrives as email text (not an attachment) and I want to save it as a PDF to a specified folder for tax time.\nHow do I print a selected email to PDF using Automator?\n\nA: You're on the right track, and @mankoff's answer is spot on. I'll elaborate in case you need more details.\nFor reference, you could read Apple's developer document on PDF workflows or, more simply, this great step-by-step guide to creating the sort of PDF workflow you want.\nAs a summary...\n\n\n*\n\n*First open Automator and create a Print Plugin.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Then select an action to move your PDF to a folder of your choice.\n\n\n \n\n\n*\n\n*Save the workflow with a meaningful name. It will automatically be placed in the correct folder (~/Library/PDF Services).\n\n*Now, when you are in Mail, you can select your workflow from the PDF menu of the Print dialog box. Your PDF will be generated and automatically filed in the folder you specified.\n\n\nA: Make your script and put it in /Library/PDF Services/ or ~Library/PDF Services/. Then, from anywhere, Print (CMD+P), and select your workflow from the dropdown menu under \"PDF\".\nFor example, my workflow takes the name of the file (usually the website name, but sometimes something generic or unhelpful) and appends YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM.pdf and puts it in the ~/Documents/receipts/ folder.\n\nA: For this exact same situation I use an app called Keyboard Maestro. I have created an action in there that runs with a hotkey. I have set it up to print the email and save it as a PDF called RENAME_ME.PDF and put inside my dropbox folder. It then opens the folder for me and I rename the file manually. Download my action, add it to Keyboard Maestro and edit the action to use the correct Dropbox path to suit your needs.\n\nA: I think you can do it if you combine it with Apple Script. There is no print action for emails. But you can call a applescript.\nYou could even combine it with (mail) rules. So when for example you see 'invoice' in the header or body, you start a applescript that automatically prints and saves it to a folder.\nIm not really into applescript, but have a look here:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com...\n\nA: I found a great way to do this and thought I should share. It doesn't use automator but rather a mac keyboard shortcut.\nI found it on the MacSparky blog so I will just link to that for a full and elegant explanation.....\nhttp://www.macsparky.com/blog/2008/3/19/keyboard-shortcut-for-save-as-pdf-in-os-x.html\n\nA: Here's a keyboard shortcut I use for creating PDFs quickly.

How can I limit the movies itunes display to the one's that are actually added to the library and/or \"reside\" in specific folders?\n\nA: iTunes is going to display any files that are in its library. To avoid displaying files, don't import them into iTunes and don't use iTunes as the player for those files because they will be added to the library collection. To play those files use Quicktime Player or a third-party solution like VLC instead.\nYou can also disable iTunes's copying of files into it's own folder structure in iTunes > Preferences > Advanced, but this will apply to all media types and, in my experience, is a less-than-optimal way to use iTunes.\n\n", "Q: 2 Apple IDs - 90 day ban? I have 2 Apple IDs but I think I read that if you use a second ID, you cannot use the first again for 90 days. Is this true? If so, I need another solution!\n95% of my app purchases have been with Apple ID #1, the original one. Apple ID #2 has only been used for a few important and more-expensive apps. I just want to log in occasionally to Apple ID #2 and download a purchased app, then go back to Apple ID #1 for all downloads, purchases, etc. \nHere is what we have. It's pretty simple because I do all the setup; my husband just uses the phone, iPad, etc. My husband and I have 2 iPhones and 1 iPad. He is still using a PC after all these years, but I have a Mac desktop with an iTunes account. Over the years I have created 2 Apple IDs.\n\nA: Currently the 90 day restriction is only for automatic download of additional purchased content.\nThis also is a per device limitation and not something about the account being banned from working elsewhere. \nFor 90 days after you turn on the \"automatic download feature\", you can't switch another account to start automatic downloads on that one device. You can always trigger updates manually. As long as you disable automatic downloads on the second account (or both) you won't have any issues with your two ID on multiple device setup until you run into the 10 total device limit for a given Apple ID for store purchases. \n\nA: You could try family sharing on Icloud, the same thing sort of happened to me. I had bought all of my previous music on my dads Itunes account and then I made my own. Everything was fine until I switched phones and none of my music switched with it, so I just redownloaded it from my dads account. But since I had set my phone up with my apple ID, it was now associated with my dads. I bought an album on my apple ID, because I can still buy music, I just can't download previous purchases, and it didn't all download. We got it back through Icloud family sharing.\n\nA: you can change your time zone to 90 days from now i think it should work\n", "Q: Application to record each individual action in contact list I would like to record each good thing someone in my contactlist or maybe not in my contact list did to me or record a happy time we did togethers.\nSo i can read all the happy memories.

My goal is to archive automatically the email I've just reply. Leaving me with a clean inbox. How can you that exactly? (I'm using MailTags and Mail Act-On a lot.)\n\nA: The option I use to to have Keyboard Maestro intercept the standard send button key command, and then run a macro that\n\n\n*\n\n*Sends the message. \n\n*Moves the message to my archive folder.\n\n\nI set the macro for the standard Shift-Control-D. Keyboard Maestro intercepts that key command. It then executes the rule \"Select 'Send' in the menu 'Message' in Mail\", and then \"Select 'Archive' in the menu 'Message' in Mail\". Archive is the name of my folder. So Keyboard Maestro is just executing those commands in the menu, since there isn't any build-in keystroke for moving messages to folders in Mail. \n\nA: Apple's Mail.app doesnt have a feature to toggle for this, but you /can/ do this in Sparrow. \nSparrow has a lite version that might suit your needs, but the full version does what you ask.\n\nA: You might find MailHub better than (or in combination with) Act-On is the winner.\n", "Q: 2 Apple IDs on one device? Can you have multiple Apple ID's on the same iOS device?\nMy girlfriend and I have both got an iPad and an iPod Classic and may well be getting iPhones at some point, we each have our own apple ID and I was wondering if I could have both Apple IDs logged into one of our iPads to avoid us having to buy Apps twice.\nI would have thought that Apple wouldn't allow this, but I just wanted to check as I can do this on my current Android phone (Two Google accounts rather than Apple IDs obviously).\n\nA: This may help. It's from the Apple iTunes agreement we all have to 'read' and sign...\n\nAssociation of Associated Devices is subject to the following terms:\n(i) You may auto-download iTunes Auto-Delivery Content or download previously-purchased iTunes Eligible Content from an Account on up to 10 Associated Devices, provided no more than 5 are iTunes-authorized computers.\n(ii) An Associated Device can be associated with only one Account at any given time.\n(iii) You may switch an Associated Device to a different Account only once every 90 days.\n(iv) You may download previously-purchased free content onto an unlimited number of devices while it is free on the iTunes Service, but on no more than 5 iTunes-authorized computers.\nAn Apple TV is not an “Associated Device.” However, TV show iTunes Products and purchased (i.e. not rented) movies iTunes Products may be played back on compatible Apple TVs, provided that you may only play back any such TV show or movie on a limited number of Apple TVs at the same time.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Recently Apple introduced Family Sharing.\nThis means you can share all your purchased apps, books, music, etc with up to 6 people you define yourself to be family. Apps or other media you purchase are not automatically downloaded on their devices, but they do get free access to it.\nOn the side you can share photo albums and calendars, but that goes beyond your question. Just have a look for yourself what it can all do: https://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/family-sharing/\n\nA: I'm not entirely sure I follow your reasoning: having \"two Apple IDs logged in at once\" doesn't solve the problem of purchases occurring in the context of an Apple ID - there is no way to purchase an app with two different IDs without both accounts being charged. (Please elaborate if I'm misunderstanding what you're asking :) )\nHowever, across multiple devices, you can use a single Apple ID for purchasing, and separate Apple IDs for iCloud, if you want one source of purchases but separate sources of data / backups on each device.\nThe settings are distinct: In iOS, you pick the Apple ID used with the iTunes Store via Settings > Store and for iCloud via Settings > iCloud.\nSo, for example, you could both use your account for the Store, and have the purchases made on each of your devices.\nThat said, there is no easy way to use separate accounts with iCloud on one device, as setting the device to use Account #2 will blow away Account #1's data, making it difficult to truly share a single iOS device unless you don't care about separating your contacts, Photo Stream, etc.\n\nA: Yes, you can actually have 7 different Apple IDs on one iDevice.  See this question I asked previously:\nCan I have different Apple IDs on my iPhone 4S?\nAnd yes, you use the same Apple ID on multiple iDevices.  This would allow you to share apps.\n\nA: My husband & I have 1 Verizon share account & 2 iPhones. We use 2 Apple ID's & separate iCloud accounts for privacy. \nMost apps sync via iCloud but for purchased apps, we do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Share 1 purchase on one device with my ID\n\n*Log on with my Facebook account\n\n*Then download app on his device with his ID\n\n*Then we log on with a Facebook account to share w/o repurchasing\nbecause of our share plan.\n\n\nA: Yes, you can have apps installed from different Apple Id's.  Simply log in with whatever account you both want to use for purchasing.  You can log out and back in with a different App Store account at any time.  \nI have multiple accounts, and multiple devices sharing applications.\nTo follow up the other responses, your App Store account can be separate from your iCloud, Messages, and FaceTime accounts.  I use a separate account (Apple ID) for iTunes purchases than my iCloud account. \nSome people even split things the opposite way - sharing email, FaceTime and messages but having different store accounts.

Is there a way to force iWork apps to behave as expected?\n\nA: Judging from Apple Discussion threads (a quick search turned up these three threads on the first page of results alone), the global Resume switch does not seem to consistently stop applications from saving and restoring Saved State information.\nIf you only want to disable Resume selectively for iWork, you may be best served by something like RestoreMeNot or TinkerTool, which has a dedicated tab for granularly managing Resume besides its other tweaking features.\nIf you want to completely disable the Resume feature, Mac OS X Hints outlines a procedure to do so.

Most probably you will not have the rights to do so. Depending on your choice of text editor, you are asked for a admin password when opening the file or when you try to save it. I use the nice TextWrangler from BareBones and it opens the file without asking (it will do so later in the process).\nNow edit the CSS to your liking and save the file.\nOpen Safari and check out how it looks.\nAnd one more thing: With the next update of Safari your changes in Reader.html will most likely be overwritten. So you might want to keep a version of Reader.html at another location outside the application package Safari to re-implement your changes.\n\nAs always, proceed with caution when modifying default applications and have backups of both any edited files as well as your important data.\n\nA: New new location of Reader.html is at \n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Safari.framework/Versions/A/Resources\n\nif you're not sure, just use locate\n\nA: You can also change the iOS Reader.html CSS on iPad, iPhone or iPod, confirmed working on iOS 8.1.2 iPad Air 2. Here's how:\nYou will need to Jailbreak your iOS device, and download a file system managing app called iFile. Then you'll have full Explorer/Finder functionality on your iOS device.\nNext, navigate to the folder:\n\n/var/stash/_.HVRQId/Applications/MobileSafari.app/Reader.html\n\nThis is the location on my iPad Air 2 with iOS 8.1.2, it may differ for you. If you upgrade to the paid version of iFile for $4, you can do a search system wide for the Reader.html file, which is what I did.\nOpen in Text Viewer, now just change the CSS as desired, anywhere you see the \"font: -apple-system-*\" declaration. \nIf you want to change the main body typography, add a font-family declaration to the .page tag. For example:\n  .page {\n        font: -apple-system-body;\n        text-align: start;\n        font-family: Georgia;\n\n}\nYou can do the same thing to edit the page heading under the h1.title tag\nh1.title {\n        font: -apple-system-headline;\n        font-weight: normal;\n        text-align: start;\n        -webkit-hyphens: manual;\n        font-family: Georgia;\n    }\n\nSave Reader.html, reload the Safari webpage, and enjoy your new Reader font!\n\nA: It is certainly possible to make changes in iOS Safari without a Jailbreak. Don't know exactly about Reader View, but the general algorithm is:\n\n\n*\n\n*make backup to your computer;\n\n*decrypt backup file with special tools;\n\n*find Safari and edit its contents.\n\n\nAlso for Safari you can use plugin CustomReader II.\n", "Q: Why is a black iPhone 4S is shown as white in iTunes? I've recently got a new black iPhone 4S, but in iTunes and Xcode organizer it is shown as white (see screenshots below). \nI purchased this new within the UK (model MD239B), but I'm not sure if it was refurbished. The search request says it is a white one. Could it possibly be a refurbished device? I've checked the serial number on support.apple.com, there is no single word similar to 'refurbished'.\n\n\nA: iTunes deduces the color of the iPhone from the serial number he finds on the logic board.  For example:\nMD269LL   = Black AT&T 64GB 4S  \nMD271LL   = White AT&T 64GB 4S  \nMD277LL/A = White Verizon 16GB 4S\n...\n\nSo, check your model number and look it up to make sure you've got a black one.\n\n\nA: What you have is a classic mixup. Apple and AT&T/Verizon often have iPhone roaming around between them based on bad or returned devices and other reasons.\nJust make sure that the IMEI number on your phone is the same as that associated with your account. I faced a problem where the AT&T folk told me that the IMEI I told them from my iPhone was a fake! \nSo, just make sure that your Wireless provider (AT&T or Verizon) are aware of the phone and the IMEI and you'll be fine.\n", "Q: Starting MySQL produces \"The server quit without updating PID file\" I've literally looked all over Stack Overflow, Superuser, I cannot find a solution to my problem that I'm experiencing right now, when I want to start MySQL, it produces this error:\n\nERROR! The server quit without updating PID file (/usr/local/var/mysql/My-Username.local.pid).\n\nwith the sudo mysql.server start command, however, if I simply use the mysql command, it will produce:\n\nERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql.sock' (2)\n\nWhich is also another problem I cannot fix, I did touch /tmp/mysql.sock, nothing.\nI've chown'd the /usr/local/var/mysql with mysql:mysql recursively, but that didn't help at all.\nI installed MySQL via homebrew on OS X 10.7.3. How can I start up MySQL?\n\nA: We (myself and Mr. Burning) did some diagnosis in chat, and I will detail what we did find:\nThe root of his problem was that MySQLd was already running in some capacity. This could have been a previous version of MySQL installed from Homebrew, still running after upgrading the binaries/libraries.\nOur resolution was to simply kill all of the running processes. Then, OS X's launchd did it's work and restarted MySQLd, which was definitively running as installed by Homebrew.\nThat seemed to resolve the issue.\n\nA: There used to be a bug in where MySQL would look for it's socket. I think this is your problem as well. I discovered it several years ago when using phpMyAdmin.\nThere seems to be a problem with how current versions of OS X store the mysql socket and how phpMyAdmin looks for it. It seems currently the socket is stored at /tmp/mysql.sock but phpMyAdmin is looking for it at /var/mysql/mysql.sock. The result is a connection error type #2002.\nhere’s the solution.

I've taken everything I need off it, so I'm looking to part out the rest of the components to recover a few dollars from what I paid for it.  The logic board is pretty obviously fried - absolutely no life in it if I attempt to power it on.\nHowever, the PMC seems to be intact.  When I connect a charger it lights up green, then orange like it's charging the battery.  The charge indicator lights on the side also come on and indicate a discharged battery (one blinking green light).  \nSo, given that the battery may have been water damaged, but shows no symptoms of it, how should I go about testing it, and what should my concerns be?  If it seems to be holding a charge in the damaged macbook, could it still damage my fully-functioning macbook if I plugged it in to test it/check the capacity?\n\nA: If you have the Apple Service Toolkit, that is the easiest way, if you don't... there aren't may programs out there really suited for this type of work. \nIf you are showing that the battery may be holding or attempting to obtain a charge, the battery probably will be OK to be used. I am sure that enough time has passed in where the battery has been completely dry.  In many cases you could submerge the battery, dry it off and it will work. The batteries are pretty much air tight to begin with. \nIf a battery had a crack in it, or something of the sort you'd know.  \nThe best thing to do is to attempt to get a charge out of it, if the battery holds one you are fine, if not then you may be able to go down to an Apple Store and ask if there is a way to view how much life is left in the battery.\nOf course, this is assuming the battery hasn't been saturated in salt water either, if it has, you may just want to throw it away.  Otherwise I think you will be safe to use it as long as it holds a charge that is. \n", "Q: How can I watch iTunes purchased movie on my Mac if it is missing in my library? I have purchased Cars 2 HD movie on my iTunes. I can't find it and/or play it on my Mac now. the only option is to buy it once more. I have just one iTunes account. when go to the movie bar in my library, there's nothing there, just the intro screen. Please help. \n\nA: This Apple support article deals specifically with downloading past purchased content. You want to check the section labeled Mac or PC since you're trying to download purchased content in iTunes on a computer.\nFrom the article and assuming you're using iTunes 11 or later:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes.\n\n*If you're not already signed in, choose Store > Sign In and type your Apple ID and password.\n\n*If you're in the iTunes Store, click the Library button, in the upper-right corner, to go to your library.\n\n*Make sure that you have \"Show iTunes in the Cloud Purchases\" enabled in your iTunes preferences by going to iTunes > Preferences in the Store tab and clicking OK.\n\n*In your iTunes library, click the content type you wish to download using the content selector in the upper-left. Choose Music to download music, Movies to download movies, and so on.\n\n*Locate the item or title you wish to download.\n\n*Click the download icon to download that item.\n\n\nAnd as 2DD8847 points out their answer: being able to do this is country dependent. You can only do this where an X appears in the media category for the iTunes in the Cloud availability by country table found in this support article. And note that for some countries, under the Movies category, there's a caveat that \"Some previously purchased movies may not be available in iTunes in the Cloud.\"\n\nA: Have you tried using the \"Check for Available Downloads\" feature? It's under the Store menu. \nIn the past, if I was missing a track/show/whatever I would be able to download again using this.\n\nA: If the \"Check for Available Downloads\" does not resolve your issue, you can just redownload the movie. If you have already bought the movie you can redownload it free of charge. The button still says \"buy\" but when you click on it, a window will pop up that tells you that you've already bought the movie and will just download it.\nIf you have downloaded it already but it is not in your library it should be in you iTunes library in your home folder (music), if you haven't changed the data storage path. Just drag and drop the movie file into iTunes to get it back into your library.\n\nA: \nIt depends on what country you live.\n\nIn Germany, for example, you just can't redownload purchased movies. \nHere you can see a overview which features are enabled in each country. \nIf you are currently in a country that supports this feature, you have to go to the iTunes Store and select \"purchased items\" on the right sidebar. There you can see all your purchased content and you can redownload it from there. \n\nA: Look in 'Itunes' > 'iTunes Music' > 'Movies'\nBasically it's in the folder where iTunes stores your music, in a subfolder called Movies\n", "Q: Is it recommended to use Mac wifi sharing for long periods of time? I am going to be buying a MacBook Pro within the next few months (hopefully an updated version if it comes out) for university this autumn.\nI am wondering, due to the Uni halls having only wired Internet, whether using the hotspot feature of the mac is appropriate for extended periods of time? This would be for the use of my iPhone and iPad which do not connect via Ethernet obviously. \nI know I could buy a wifi router but was just wondering as this method (via MacBook) would be cheaper and more portable.\n\nA: The Internet Sharing \"hotspot\" feature does work well for this. However, it is WEP only and you are stuck with the default IP address range unless you do some hacking. I use an Airport Express and I find it's very convenient, supports \"more\" secure connections(WPA), and is configurable. It's also always available, never goes to sleep and never drains a battery. It can become a pain always having to have your MBP available for your iOS devices.  \nBeing in an University environment, I would want to use something a little more secure then WEP.\nAlso, you can adjusts the signal strength on the AE. Turn it down if you'd like it to just cover your room. Turn it up if there is a lot of other WIFI going on. I'm not sure what kind of range you'll get on the MBP and how many connections it will handle well.\nThe MBP will work in a pinch. I'd get a dedicated device to save yourself time, and hassle.\n\nA: While you can certainly use your laptop as your Wi-Fi hotspot, you will find certain limitations.  Obviously, you can only have Wi-Fi available when your computer is powered on, and connected to your Internet source via Ethernet.\nI've done this before on business trips. And it's not hard to setup. But, what I found was it was much easier having a dedicated device (Apple Airport Express) to serve my Wi-Fi constantly than worrying about having my laptop powered on, or connected to the Ethernet cable.\n", "Q: How can I boot a 2012 Mac Mini off of a USB thumbdrive with CentOS on it? I have a 2012 Mac Mini running OS X 10.7.3. On another PC, I have created a USB boot disc with CentOS 6.2 on it. The goal was to install CentOS onto the Mini. The USB drive is MBR partitioned and boots fine on BIOS based PCs. However, not so on the Mac Mini. While holding down the option key, I see the USB drive offered as a \"Windows Drive\" however selecting it to boot into causes the screen to go completely black and the words \"Boot Error\" to be displayed with a blinking cursor underneath the words.\nI have installed rEFIt as an EFI boot manager onto the Mac Mini. Using the rEFIt boot management screen to select the USB drive to boot from causes no difference. The Mini can boot from a USB drive that I turned into an Apple Recovery Disk.\nWhat could be preventing the Mac Mini from booting off of the USB drive when other BIOS based PCs don't have trouble with it?\n\nA: It appears that the Mac Mini version that I purchased cannot, as of the time of this post, accept an alternate operating system. Hacks and workarounds may exist, but they are not apparent.\n\nA: The best way to actually install an OS from a USB stick, and to allow it to run on a Mac/PC or anything in between has been with a program that I've used in the past called unetbootin. \nThis program has over 20 Distros including CentOS. \nI have used it in the past, and I will tell you now when I used it, it was a lifesaver. All you need to do is download the ISO and run the program. Follow the simple steps and sit back, enjoy the install show, and then run your OS from the USB without an issue.\nHope this helps you.

I am writing an AppleScript and I'd like to be able to format text in a display dialog box. For instance, I want part of the text to be bold or italic. How can I do this?\n\nA: Barring using Cocoa dialogs and integrating them into your script (way out of the scope of this question – and of my expertise, too), you can’t. AppleScript’s display dialog does not allow for typographic formatting (and neither does the only script friendly alternative to AppleScript’s inbuilt abilities, Carsten Blüm’s Pashua).\nIf all you need is for the first (supposedly most important) part of the text to be emphasized, you can use display alert instead of display dialog\ndisplay alert \"this is the important part\" message \"… and this is not\"\n\nwhich will give you this:\n\n", "Q: What I can delete from /private/var/vm? What is this folder? It's huge and I can use the extra room. I've read sleepimage isn't necessary—is this true? Should I just deal with it? Is the \"private\" folder emptied automatically, or would I have to do it manually? If it isn't useful (or needed), is there any way to prevent it from reappearing in the future?\n\n\nA: /var/vm/sleepimage is used to store the contents of the RAM during hibernation, and the hybrid hibernation and sleep mode that Mac laptops use by default. If you have 8 GiB of RAM, /var/vm/sleepimage takes about 8 GiB of disk space. I don't know why it isn't deleted after waking up from sleep though. It might be to ensure that there is enough free disk space for it or so that it won't be stored on non-contiguous blocks if disk space is low.\nYou can delete /var/vm/sleepimage safely, but it will be recreated when you put the Mac to sleep. If you run sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0; sudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage, the Mac will use a normal sleep mode (like desktop Macs by default) and it won't recreate /var/vm/sleepimage.\nFrom man pmset:\n\nhibernatemode = 0 (binary 0000) by default on supported desktops. The system will not back memory up to persistent storage. The system must wake from the contents of memory; the system will lose context on power loss. This is, historically, plain old sleep.\nhibernatemode = 3 (binary 0011) by default on supported portables. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will power memory during sleep. The system will wake from memory, unless a power loss forces it to restore from disk image.\nhibernatemode = 25 (binary 0001 1001) is only settable via pmset. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will remove power to memory. The system will restore from disk image. If you want \"hibernation\" - slower sleeps, slower wakes, and better battery life, you should use this setting.\n\n\n*\n\n*0 (traditional sleep mode) enables fast wake up and sleep, saves disk space, and reduces writing to the drive.\n\n*3 (hybrid hibernation and safe sleep mode) enables fast wake up and sleep and enables restoring state after a power loss.\n\n*25 (hibernation) saves energy and enables restoring state after a power loss.\n\nI used hibernatemode 0 with my MacBook Air. Even if the MacBook Air went to sleep when the battery was nearly empty, the battery didn't usually drain out completely during sleep. /var/vm/sleepimage took about 4 GiB of disk space, and writing it hundreds or thousands of times might have reduced the lifespan of the SSD.\n\nA: Don't remove /private/var/vm it is your swap files which the OS constantly uses.\nWhen you need less swap or you reboot the OS will reduce the number of files it uses here.\n\nA: An additional note to the top answer:\nSince you can either choose to disable the sleepimage, or activate it but then be forced to keep it after wake up, i found a dirty little trick for my preferred solution: Have a sleepimage but delete it after wakeup to free the disk space. If you are someone like me who constantly hovers at around 2-6 GB free space on your small SSD, this might be your solution.\nJust point the sleepimage to your .Trash folder and empty your trash bin after wake up.\nsudo pmset -a hibernatefile ~/.Trash/sleepimage\n\nThis is only a viable solution, if you only use one account on your mac. You wont be able to easily delete the sleepfile from another account (Of course you could if the other account has sufficient rights, but it would loose it's simplicity because it would not just mean clicking on the trash bin).\nIf for whatever reason you want to return to the factory settings, just type\nsudo pmset -a hibernatefile /var/vm/sleepimage\n\n(Note: I use 10.8, this might change in other versions, just check man pmset to be sure.)\n\nA: Addition: What Dan Barrett said about the sleepimage re-creation is true. However there's a way to get around it and therefore permanently free the disk space occupied by sleepimage.\nThe whole steps:\ndisable hibernation mode:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\n\ndelete /private/var/vm/sleepimage:\nsudo rm /private/var/vm/sleepimage\n\ncreate an empty file and name it 'sleepimage':\nsudo touch /private/var/vm/sleepimage\n\nchange its flag to immutable:\nsudo chflags schg /private/var/vm/sleepimage\n\nIn this way the system cannot re-create sleepimage anymore. This worked perfectly for me and I've not seen any problem on my Mac for 4 months.\n\nA: If it's not taking too much space (like in your case) I would leave as it is. Things in the private folder are not meant to be messed with. It's part of the UNIX system your Mac is build on and shouldn't be visible. It's why they call the folder private.\nBut software, like you used, made it visible, which is not a good thing. \nThat being said, you can delete this sleep image without any problem, but I wouldn't recommend it. If you really need those 4GB, try to use a hard drive for your movies, music or so and save space with your own files, not the systems files.\n\nA: sudo pmset -a hibernatefile /dev/null/sleepimage\n\n", "Q: MBP 2011: external displays not detected automatically My late-2011 13\" MacBook Pro generally doesn't automatically detect external displays. At work or at home, I plug it to either a 23\" Cinema Display (2005) or a 24\" LG display using a Mini DisplayPort / DVI adapter.\nSometimes auto-detection of the display works out-of-the-box (notably, the first time I plug a display after a reboot), but most of the time I need to manually click \"Detect Displays\" in system preferences.\nMy two monitors work perfectly, my MDP/DVI adapter works too (confirmed by cross-testing with other Macs, other displays, other adapters).

I don't know exactly what's the difference but it works for me.\n\nA: Here are some troubleshooting steps you could try to isolate the issue:\n\n*\n\n*Run all software updates on both the iMac and MacBook Air. A lot of times there are firmware updates that address issues like this.\n\n\n*Reset the PRAM on the MacBook Pro by restarting the computer and holding\n⌘+⌥+P+R on boot but until you hear the POST chime twice. Then you can let go and boot normally.\nThe PRAM stores configuration information about the displays connected to your Mac, so resetting it may be the answer for you.

I want to be able to start an app or script, leave it running for a few hours, then come back and see a log of what processes started and stopped in that time. This is not the same as Activity Monitor or Top which will only show me a \"live\" view.\nE.g. something like this:\n<timestamp> <pid> Safari started\n<timestamp> <pid> ssh started\n<timestamp> <pid> ssh stopped\n<timestamp> <pid> Safari stopped\n\nAny recommendations?\nEdit to clarify - I don't already know the names of the processes I want to monitor - I want to find out what processes are starting/stopping.\n\nA: The following script builds an array of Applications/Processes dynamically. This is an advantage in the sense that you do not need to \"know\" every process prior to its launch. However, it is important to note that due to this design as the number of processes grow the longer it will take to add a new process to the array. To compensate for this the script keeps the contents of the array cached so as to use them later preventing the need to re-add them to the array. \nALSO: If the Application/Process has not been dynamically loaded into the array prior to the process stopping the logger will leave the \"Command\" column empty. This will become less and less likely as your dynamically built array builds upon its cached information. Adding to the previous point. At times a \"Command\" may not be shown in the column yet it has already been added to the array. This is likely caused by the fact that certain process's like \"sort\" have been removed as they are used in the script and would be constantly starting and stopping (adding false positives to the logger). Currently the data will be put into the file /command_logger. This of course can be changed as you see fit. The config file /tmp/command_logger.plist can also be renamed/moved but remember that it holds the data to the growing App/Process array.\nPlease feel free to use and modify the following script as you see fit. Please remember to utilize a testing environment prior to running on your primary environment.

I have a set of PDF documents that each have a few extra pages. I'd like to remove the first two and last pages from each of them. Preview only lets me look at and annotate a PDF, not edit one. Can anyone recommend a (free/freeware) tool to do this? I'm using 10.5 PPC so that does limit some of my options. Command line or GUI is fine.\n\nOk, in Preview it seems I can delete pages by hitting ⌘⌫ on the thumbnails, but it will then not give me the option to save. I can then try printing the altered document to PDF, but I am leery of this because I don't want to loose any metadata (I have to double-check all the files to see how much metadata there is if I decide on this course).\n\nJust tried Acrobat at work, that doesn't work. The files are mod-protected by a password.\n\nA: Preview can selectively export pages of a PDF through the printing options. I just download IRS form W9, which has four pages. The first page is the form that needs to be filled out, and the final three pages are instructions. I filled out the first page using Preview on Mountain Lion, then I chose to print. From the print screen, I chose to include only one page (the first page), and saved to PDF with the button at the bottom of the print sheet. This technique can be used for individual pages or a range of pages. \n\nA: For the command-line I can recommend:\npdftk, the PDF Toolkit (for the Snow-Leopard installer you can try Pacifist to get the binaries or use the older version)\n\nMerge PDF Documents\nSplit PDF Pages into a New Document\nRotate PDF Pages or Documents\n…\n\nIf your PDF is edit-protected, you may want to try qpdf (via e.g. homebrew) to remove the restrictions first.\n\nQPDF is a command-line program that does structural, content-preserving transformations on PDF files. It could have been called something like pdf-to-pdf. It also provides many useful capabilities to developers of PDF-producing software or for people who just want to look at the innards of a PDF file to learn more about how they work.\n\n\nA: As I have written before, QPDF is great. Use it this way to extract pages 3-998 from 1000 pages of input.pdf and save it as output.pdf.\nqpdf --pages input.pdf 3-998 -- input.pdf output.pdf\n\nPlease note that input.pdf is written twice.\nYou can install as described here:\nDownload MacPorts and invoke:\nsudo port install qpdf\n\nOr you can install it with Homebrew:\nbrew install qpdf\n\nIt is a great tool for PDF manipulation, which is very fast, has very few dependencies. \"It can encrypt and linearize files, expose the internals of a PDF file, and do many other operations useful to end users and PDF developers.\"\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/qpdf/\nIt can work with password protected files. For example:\nqpdf --empty --copy-encryption=encrypted.pdf --encryption-file-password=pass\n--pages encrypted.pdf --password=pass 1 ./encrypted.pdf --password=pass 1 --\noutfile.pdf\n\n\nA: PDFpen from Smile Software is a commercial program that can do this and much more. The latest version for Lion is PDFpen 5.8, but you can purchase a copy of their older version 4.7.1, which is compatible with 10.5 Leopard.\n\nA: The commandline for pdftk (suggested by iolsmit) to remove the first 2 and the last two pages from a 30-page PDF named input1.pdf is this:\npdftk \\\n  input1.pdf \\\n  cat 3-28 \\\n  output input1_p3-28.pdf\n\nThe very latest, still unreleased version of Ghostscript (which will become v. 9.06 in a few weeks) can also do it:\ngs \\\n  -o input1_p3-28.pdf \\\n  -dFirstPage=3 \\\n  -dLastPage=28 \\\n  -sDEVICE=pdfwrite \\\n   input1.pdf\n\nTo automatically determine the number of pages, you could use pdfinfo (also available from MacPorts):\npdfinfo input1.pdf\n\nwill show the collection of embedded metadata about the PDF. Hence you could script the whole process of removing the pages. First, put the number of pages into a variable:\n_endpage=$(( $(pdfinfo input1.pdf | grep Pages: | awk '{print $2}' sed 's# ##g') - 2 ))\n\nThen, run one of the above commandlines using this variable:\npdftk input1.pdf cat 3-${_endpage} output input1_p3-${_endpage}.pdf\n\nJust put these two lines into a Bash script called remove-my-4-pages.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\n_endpage=$(( $(pdfinfo ${1}.pdf | grep Pages: | awk '{print $2}' sed 's# ##g') - 2 ))\npdftk ${1}.pdf cat 3-${_endpage} output ${2}.pdf\n\nand run it like this:\nbash  remove-my-4-pages.pdf  myinput.pdf  myoutput.pdf\n\nJust make sure that the pdfinfo and pdftk utilities are in your $PATH environment variable. Otherwise the script will not run. If you installed these utilities from MacPorts, you can put the followng line into your ~/.bash_profile:\nexport PATH=/opt/local/bin:$PATH\n\n\nA: Combine PDFs\n...is a tool that does this task very fast and simple. It costs $30 in the Mac App Store, but you can still download the completely free version 3.0 on their website.\nThe free version 3.01 is already several years old, but I've been using it in Lion without problems.

I am trying to see if I can SSH to my iPhone using the 3G network. So, given my IP, I am trying to make contact through SSH, using the defined port (which is no longer 22, I changed it).\nIt all works fine on my private wifi network.\nFor some reason, it doesn't on 3G...\nAny ideas ?\nThanks\n\nA: a) Unless you have jailbroken your device, iOS doesn't have an SSH server to run.\nb) If you have jailbroken your device, it will not be possible to SSH into your iPhone over cellular. You are behind one of the most complex NAT setups there is. When you move between towers, and lose signal, you lose your lease to a unique ID with the cellular network (like an IP). However, every time your connection is re-established with your carrier, you're connected to a new tower and your connection is routed differently through another NAT and finally out somewhere, probably in another state.\nIn researching this alone, over the course of 10 minutes, my iPhone returned 2 different IPs from the internet, one in Florida, one in Pennsylvania.\nShort answer: Wi-Fi = yes | Cellular = no\n\nA: Yes, you can, if you use a VPN service, that assigns you a real, unmasked IP address (which will be accessible from the internet) or a VPN to your local network.\n", "Q: How can you get an app running in Terminal to scroll properly (as on Ubuntu)? Example: In Terminal, I fire up elinks and browser to a web page. I try to use the trackpad scroll gesture and the page up and page down to scroll up and down the web page that elinks is showing me. But instead of scrolling the web page, Terminal scrolls the entire scrollback buffer. \nIn Ubuntu, elinks will scroll properly when you press page up and page down and the scrollwheel.\nThis also applies to other console-based POSIX programs like Vim.\nAny suggestions on how to get these programs to accept trackpad scroll gestures in OS X?\n\nA: To use a mouse wheel or trackpad to scroll in Terminal.app you'll need to install MouseTerm. After installing MouseTerm you'll need to add set mouse=nicr to your .vimrc file:\necho \"set mouse=nicr\" >> ~/.vimrc\n\nIf you're still not able to scroll in elinks it's possible that it wasn't compiled with GPM (General Purpose Mouse) support. Since elinks isn't a native application to OS X you probably installed through MacPorts or Homebrew. I'd open the \"formula\" file for elinks /usr/local/Library/Formula/elinks.rb (by default for Homebrew) and verify that --without-gpm isn't anywhere to be found.\nThough your question states you want to do this in Terminal.app I'd recommend taking a look at iTerm2 which supports this natively, and has quite a bit more to offer then the stock Terminal app.\n", "Q: How can I disable rounded window corners in OS X Is there any way that the rounded window corners can be disabled in OS X Lion (10.7.3) ?\nUpdate: It's the bottom two corners that I have problem with as they show up even in full screen mode.\n\nA: Tested on 10.7.3 & 10.7.4\n\nTo turn rounded corners off for all windows use the following command in Terminal.\ndefaults write -g AppleUseCoreUI -bool false ; killall Finder\n\nTo restore the rounded corners for all windows use the following command in Terminal.\ndefaults write -g AppleUseCoreUI -bool true ; killall Finder\n\nNOTE: For this to take effect on already open applications those applications must be closed and reopened (this is why the commands above include killall Finder). Some Applications may interact differently once CoreUI is turned off.\nALSO: This does not affect the corners at the bottom of the window. They will still appear rounded. (As noted in comments by Daniel Lawson)\nIf you are not comfortable with the killall Finder being used in your command the steps can be taken to ensure the same result.\nStep 1. (Turn off rounded corners)\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the following Command\ndefaults write -g AppleUseCoreUI -bool false\n\n\n*Remember to close and reopen any Applications that were open when prior to this command being run.\nStep 2.

However, trying the same USB on a newer Macbook Pro, from late 2011, does not work.\nI have gone with a method adapted from the one described here, which creates a Mac partition on the USB and copies some rEFIt files into it.\nOn booting the new Macbook Pro, holding the option key allows the choice of boot device to be made. Selecting rEFIt then allows Linux to be chosen, which works the same way as on the older Macbook Pro. However, on the late 2011 model, following the selection of Linux, all I get is a screen saying that no bootable devices were found.\nDoes anyone know what might be causing this, and, if so, how to fix it? The version of Ubuntu I am trying to run is 10.04 32-bit.\n\nA: Make sure you are using a DVD with the image burned onto it instead of a USB drive. (USB images never seem to work.)\nAlso rEFIt is still fine for use as the bootloader. Old question, I know, but it might help.\n", "Q: Multi-output audio device disables volume control When creating either an Aggregate Device or a Multi-Output Device in Audio MIDI Setup and setting it as the default audio output device, the volume control is greyed out and locked at maximum intensity. Why is that and how can it be bypassed?\n\nA: When using the Built-in Output as part of a Mult-Output Device, you can set the volume of the Built-in Output with AppleScript:\nosascript -e 'set volume 2'\n\nThis doesn't seem to affect the volume of the other devices that are part of the Multi-Output Device.\nNow, if only there was a way to get the volume button keys to run a script!\n\nA: This is a paid, but very robust solution to this problem: https://staticz.com/soundcontrol/\nI'm using it in combination with SoundFlower which allows me to record program sounds.\n\nA: Whilst I'm not certain why the single volume control in the Sound preference pane is greyed out (or whether that behaviour can be changed), the only way I found to allow me to change the volume at all was to manually adjust the \"Master\" volume slider for each device in the aggregate or multi-output device.\n\n\nA: The only fully functional and painless solution I have found is to use Rogue Amoeba's Loopback. In its interface you can route audio to multiple audio devices and set the volume of each, or route to a multi-output device already set up using the Audio Midi Mac app. Both solutions retain system volume keyboard control and work perfectly. I opt for the former method since it is easier to adjust volume for individual devices in the Loopback interface.\n\nA: I have written a popover app just for doing it.\nIt is working as\n1-) Get default audio output device\n2-) For each sub devices of it\n3-) Get or set left and right channel volume.\n\nYou may find it helpful. Here is the medium topic i have written for that\nhttps://medium.com/@gurhanpolat/change-volume-on-aggregate-sound-815fd575347a\nit is now working in the status menu as a volume slider. You can also use Volume UP,DOWN,MUTE commands to change the volume.\nSource code\nhttps://github.com/adaskar/AggregateVolumeMenu\nReleases\nhttps://github.com/adaskar/AggregateVolumeMenu/releases/\n\nA: It's weird the inside the Audio MIDI Setup, I get the Master slider grayed out even if not using the Multi-Output device. Please, let me know if any better solution exists (or at least a workaround to my disabled Master slider).\nMy current solution is using Soundflower as suggested here by Jeremy at the end:\n\nThe final issue to resolve is having the ability to change the audio volume like normal. Unfortunately, I didn’t find a way to do this without the help of a 3rd party app, but thankfully, Soundflower seems to do the trick without any extra bloat and appears to be well maintained. It’s hosted on Github and you can find a download link both on Github and it’s Google Code home. Once you install it, you will find two new audio devices are listed in the Audio MIDI Setup app. For my purposes, the two channel device fit my needs, so I went in and set it as the default for both input, output, and system alert sounds (right click on the device and you will see options for each). You don’t have to do all three, but I found it works for my needs, so might for yours too. Once you have done that, launch the Soundflowerbed app from /Applications/Soundflower and then look for a menu bar icon shaped like a flower. Click on it, and then pick your Aggregate Device as shown here:\n\n-><-\n\nWith that, you should now be all set.

Email, Simplenote, notes, Evernote, or wherever else you like to store the text for submitting a bug with Apple. You can also get at the logs after syncing from iTunes or Xcode - but getting it when the crash happens works best for me in most cases.\n\nA: If you have Xcode installed, plugin your device to your computer and open Xcode. Then open the Organizer, which can be found in the Window Menu.  Now find the desired crash log (as shown below) and click the export button (bottom of window).  This gives you a .crash file that you can send to the developer.\n\n\nA: You can pull crash reports from your phone using Organizer in Xcode: Locating Crash Reports.\nIt looks like iTunes also copies them over when it syncs, so you should be able to get at them from Windows if you don't have a Mac.\n", "Q: What mail program offers spam filtering and a unified way to check multiple mailboxes?

However, the inbox does not sync at all. It always shows 'No offline messages'. But I am able to see the messages under All Mail and Important labels. I have enabled the POP and IMAP settings for my gmail account (under settings).\nPlease help me resolve the issue so that my inbox syncs up automatically. Thanks a lot in advance.\n\nA: The preferred method for syncing your GMail account with an iOS device is by using Exchange with Google Sync. I could detail the directions here, but Google has a great writeup that is far more robust.\nIf you have multiple calendars you'll want to follow this guide to configure your device to access them as well.\n", "Q: How to rebuild iTunes Library with altered file locations without losing playcounts|ratings etc My iTunes was set to make copies of all the music that it imported and keep it's own library within the iTunes folder. I wanted to delete my original files but deleted my iTunes copies instead. Now I have an exclamation mark beside all my music and since iTunes renames the files in it's own copy according to the ID3 tags, I can't simply replace my iTunes folder with my original files as the filenames and folders don't match. \nThe brute force alternative is to manually point each missing file to the new file location but this does not seem like a very clever solution given I have over 5000 tracks. \nI don't want to reconstruct my library from scratch because I will lose precious listening and rating history from the past six years! Is there anyway I can fix this without losing my play counts and ratings?\nI can a poor idea of rebuilding the file/folder structure on a new iTunes instance on another machine/account and copying the files back to the folder but this doesn't sound fool-proof. Any suggestions! \n\nA: There are a few AppleScripts from Doug Adams that might help you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fix Broken Tracks will merge the data of \"dead tracks\" (iTunes tracks designated with \"!\") with the real track that you have re-added to your iTunes Library.\n\n*iTunes Track CPR will check your library for \"dead tracks\" and re-add them while keeping all the previous metadata intact. In order for this script to work, the files need to be moved back to the iTunes Music Folder. \n\n*Music Folder Files Not Added displays files in iTunes Media folder which are not in the iTunes library.\nIt's important to read the manuals for these scripts before running them. Test a script only on a few tracks at first before running it on your entire library. \n\nA: If you have the original Library.xml file, you can extract the play count and rating information from the XML:\n\n<dict>\n   ...\n   <key>Play Count</key><integer>5</integer>\n   ...\n   <key>Rating</key><integer>100</integer>\n\n\nA: I once had a problem pretty much like the one you described with my TV Shows. I know, it feels bad at the moment. Anyway, here is the deal.\nBack then I was reading and examining a lot about iTunes' infrastructure. The conclusion I came to realize is that iTunes' infrastructure is so complex to deal with that you'll probably won't be able to achieve what you want and in the end you'll have to build your library from scratch.\niTunes library infrastructure isn't just a basic folder system even though it seems like that. It's much more complex than that with additional files that makes iTunes work the way it works.\nMaybe someone else with more experience than me will come with a solution but then again rest assured it won't be easy.\nGood luck! :)\n", "Q: I am no longer able to burn discs using my MacBook's SuperDrive. How can I fix it? About a year ago, the SuperDrive in my 2010 MacBook appeared to stop working. When I insert a blank CD or DVD, the disc does not show up in the Finder. The drive appears in Disk Utility, and I am able to eject it from there. I assumed this was a hardware problem with the SuperDrive, so I just purchased an external Samsung USB DVD drive. I am seeing the exact same behavior with it. This leads me to believe there is some kind of OS X problem rather than it stemming from the drives.\nWhat steps should I take to troubleshoot and try to fix this?\n\nA: I reset the SMC and the SuperDrive is working again.\n", "Q: How can I tell which volume the operating system is on?

If I have a really high resolution image in Keynote, and I shrink it down to start out small, and then use the scale up action (animation) to make it big the resulting image is pixelated and low quality, even if the image was scaled up to its original size (before it was scaled down).\nThis is the same for both vector and raster images.\nIs there a way to scale up an image without losing image quality?\n\nA: I found two workarounds for this, but both are a pain.\n\n\n*\n\n*The first is to replace the scaled up image after the scale action completes. This works pretty well, but during the scale process you can see the loss of quality until the regular image replaces it.\n\n*The second is more complicated, but produces better results:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start with small scaled version of the image (image A) where you want it. Apply any Build In animations on it.\n\n*Have a full size image (image B) with the opacity set to 0%.\n\n*Have a Scale Action on the image B setting it to the size of Image A.\n\n*Add a Opacity Action on image B to 100%.\n\n*Use a Disappear Build Out on image A.\n\n*Then use the Scale Up Action on Image B to the new size you want it to be.\n\n\n\nThis produces perfect results, but as you can see is very complicated.

But  when I am trying to do that same thing by attaching it with my PC(itunes) the update size is ~767mb.\nWhy is this difference in size?\n\nA: It sounds like you're talking about the difference between an \"Over The Air\" (OTA) update, also called a delta update, done by tapping a button in the device's Settings - and a normal update done by clicking \"Update\" in iTunes on your computer.\nOTA updates are smaller because they only include the new assets (code, images, etc.) from the update, instead of replacing all the assets on the device.\nThis article includes an example of this difference on an iPhone 4:\n\nNot only are over-the-air updates simple to install, but they’re also deltas. That means that the updates contain only the minimum data needed to upgrade, instead of the complete operating system. For the 5.0.1 update for a GSM iPhone 4, the over-the-air update weighed in at 44.6MB; the full download via iTunes was 790.7MB.\n\n", "Q: How can I preserve the battery cycles on my MacBook Air? I recently got my MacBook Air, and the battery cycles is already at 12. Is this good/average? I don't know if I am not charging it properly or something, because I don't want to ruin my battery in the first year of having it. \nEarlier today, I didn't even run the battery all the way down to 0% (it went down to 6%) and then I charged it up to 94%, and the battery cycle count has increased to 12, but that is not a full cycle, or is it? I'm confused about this whole battery cycle thing, because I'm used to a desktop and not worrying about batteries.\nSo, how can I preserve the battery cycles and not use as much cycles in a week? Maybe I am charging it too much or something?\n\nA: Don't stress about it so much.\nA Battery cycle refers to, more or less, one mostly full discharge and recharge. Typically, your battery should be rated for somewhere in the neighborhood of 1000 cycles. Eventually, the battery just won't hold a charge for as long as it did when it was new, but that's why batteries are easily and affordably replaceable. It's a consumable part. If it dies prematurely (which is the only thing you should really need to pay attention to cycles for), then it's covered under your warranty. The 'Battery Cycles' indicator is mainly there so that you can diagnose this. If, in a years time, your laptop's battery only lasts half as long as it did when it was new, but you've only used say, 400 cycles, well, that's not performing up to spec, and it should be covered under your warranty. If you've used 1500 cycles (doing that in a year would be some pretty heavy and impressive use though, I've gotta say), well, that's to be expected. You used your battery a lot, and it wore out.\nUse your laptop as normal. Battery cycles are not a scarce and precious resource to be hoarded. 12 cycles in about a week and a half sounds pretty normal for a new laptop being used heavily to me. That's about, what? 6 hours/day unconnected to a power source? If you're using it on the go, that's a perfectly reasonable amount of consumption.\n\nA: It is, to the best of my knowledge, complete nonsense that on a newish macbook pro and air, that keeping it plugged into the wall damages the battery. \nIt was the case on older pc laptops, and most probably older macs too, but the newer macs are intelligent enough not to keep pumping power into the battery once it's charged.\nOnce the battery is fully charged, it's my understanding the computer stops putting power to the battery, and uses the power adaptor solely to power the computer.\nI believe that this is what the green or red light on the magnetic charging connector signifies.\nWhen it's green, the power is bypassing the battery, thus it's not damaging the battery.\nWhen it's red, power is going into the battery.\nKind of the same as electronic cigarette battery chargers which flash red when charging, and green once they are charged. \nYou may remember in the news that some electronic cigarette batteries were exploding when they were left plugged in, before the manufacturers started using the different type of charger that cuts the charge, once the battery was at capacity.\nMy friend (who is the 'mac expert' in my circle of friends, and also a programmer) said that the way to check this is by waiting until your mac is 100% charged, then go to the top right of your screen and click on the battery icon, while the adaptor is still plugged in. \nThe menu that opens will say \"battery is charged\" and underneath it - \"Power source: Power adaptor\" which shows it's not using the battery to power the mac.\nThen, unplug your charger and look at it and it will say \"Power source: Battery\"\nYour battery cycles won't keep adding up if you keep it plugged in. And it won't ruin your battery, like older laptops.\nThe cycles will only start adding up when you use the mac without power, and then you recharge.\nIf you were to use the mac SOLELY with the power supply connected for the next week, you will notice your cycles will remain exactly where they are, because the battery isn't being used at all. It's just sitting there waiting to be used, should you unplug it.\nI had the same concern when I first got my mac.\nI was thinking that I had to unplug it when it was charged and was concerned I was gonna burn through my battery rapid style, as I work about 8 - 12 hours a day on it.\nI was coming from a 2010 sony vaio where keeping it plugged in had damaged the battery. (It only stayed on for about 4 minutes unplugged!)\nBut, I was relieved to hear the MacBooks are smarter.\nCheck out what I am saying for yourself and try it out.\nIn short, I believe that keeping it plugged in does not damage the battery on a macbook pro & air(I have the 2014 pro retina 15\" model) because the mac doesn't keep trying to charge a full battery and does not power the laptop at all with the battery when the power supply is connected.\nSave your battery cycles to use during the times when you can't plug it in, to maximise the life of your battery.\nThe new systems are very clever and not like the older systems.\nCheers\nAlan\nPS. here I have copy and pasted the info about my battery:\nCharge Information:\n  Charge Remaining (mAh):   8221\n  Fully Charged:    Yes\n  Charging: No\n  Full Charge Capacity (mAh):   8221\n  Health Information:\n  Cycle Count:  20\n  Condition:    Normal\n  Battery Installed:    Yes\nThis shows that my battery is 100% charged, and still running at full capacity. (8221 mAh)\nIt also clearly states that the battery is not charging, and it's plugged in right now as I write this.\nSo I hope this gives everyone who is concerned about this some relief. And you can look forward to your battery lasting a lot longer than you initially feared.\n", "Q: What Photogrammetry software is available on Mac OS X?

Check it out!\n\nA: I use BTT (Better Touch Tool) which includes window snapping, as well as a whole host of other useful features such as extra multitouch gestures, and button management.\nYou can use as much or as little as you want, but window snapping is on by default and just means you drag an application to the top to maximise it, left to align and fill the left half, and to the right for the right.\nEDIT: This is called BST (Better Snap Tool) and it is no longer free.\nEl Capitan has an implemented feature (press green button until you can drop it to the side) or check other free tools like Spectacle\nUpdate: As of Feb 20, 2016 BST is $2.99 USD.\n\nA: Yet another tool suggestion: ShiftIt.

Some easy ones I chose were “ctrl + alt + ←” and “ctrl + alt + →” because they are pretty unlikely to conflict with anything else. Avoid the shift key as a modifier as it can make the animations go in slow motion.\nNot all apps have these menu items in their “Window” menu, so those apps won’t respond to these keyboard shortcuts\nAnswer taken from https://medium.com/ryan-hanson/going-without-a-3rd-party-window-manager-in-macos-catalina-4bd270b29245\n\nA: There's also BetterSnapTool, made by the same developer as BetterTouchTool. It has more features than BetterTouchTool, and it's in the Mac App Store for $1.99. Yes, it's a bit more expensive than free, but I personally prefer BetterSnapTool (and you're supporting the developer; very important).\n\n\n\nA: Another tool is Moom (5$ in the Apple Store): you can divide the screen in a number of squares and define keyboard shortcut to position the windows. Several standard placements are already defined by default (right/left half, bottom/top half, ...)\n\nI never used anything else (I'm very happy with Moom) but DoublePane was mentioned several time on AskDifferent and it seems that several other alternatives exist.\n\nA: Original Answer (Update below):\nApple has provided this functionality as part of its OS X El Capitan. Here are the steps:\n\n*\n\n*Click and hold on the green maximize button of an active window (for example, a Safari window);\n\n*When the window shrinks slightly and the background becomes highlighted, you’re about to enter Split View, while continuing to hold the green button drag the active window into either the left or right panel to place it full screen there;\n\n*As soon as you place the first window into the Split View panel, the other side of the screen turns into a mini-Expose much like Mission Control, simply click the window tile you want to open into Split View for the other side here to immediately send it side by side into Split Full Screen Mode.\n\nThe answer has been taken from osxdaily.com website's page.\n\nUpdate:\nMany people commented that they wish there was a shortcut for it. I figured a way to create a shortcut for that from another answer on AskDifferent which I cannot find the link to. This is how:\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences;\n\n*Go to 'Keyboard' settings;\n\n*Go to 'Shortcuts' tab;\n\n*In the left pane, select 'App Shortcuts';\n\n*\n\n*In this section you can add app specific shortcuts, as well as shortcuts that you want available for all apps.\n\n\n\n*Click on the '+' sign below right pane to add a new shortcut;\n\n*A new drop down will open. In this drop-down:\n\n*\n\n*In the 'Application:' keep it for 'All Applications';\n\n*In the 'Menu Title:' type 'Tile Window to Right of Screen'. Better that you copy-paste it because it has to match letter by letter;\n\n*In the 'Keyboard Shortcut:' press the keys you want to use as shortcut for tiling an application window to the right. On my machine, I've set† it to ⎇⌘→.\n\n*Repeat the same for tiling to left by putting 'Tile Window to Left of Screen' in the 'Menu Title:' and adding your desired keys for left-tiling shortcut.\n\n\n\nYou should now have the shortcuts available for any application window that supports tiling. Now, you can press your shortcut keys to tile the first window to left or right. Then the other side will turn into a mini-Expose from which you can select the second window using your mouse.\n\n\n†I have a dual monitor setup. So other than the one listed above, I have also set the shortcut to move a window to another monitor. The 'Menu Title's are: \n1. \"Move to Built-in Retina Display\", with shortcut ⌃⎇⌘→;\n2. \"Move to LG UltraFine\", with shortcut ⌃⎇⌘←;\nTo remember the shortcuts, notice that all they keys, are next to each other. All you do is use arrow keys differently. Further, moving to another monitor has an extra key in the shortcut, while putting the windows in split view is on the same monitor, therefore it has one less key.\nHint:\nThe shortcut name depends on the MacOS system language, e.g.:\nenglish:\n'Tile Window to Left of Screen'\ngerman : 'Fenster auf der linken Bildschirmseite anordnen'\nor a different title: 'Fenster auf die linke Seite des Bildschirms bewegen'\nPhrases for left / right can be found on the green \"full screen\" button:\n\n\nA: Unlike other answers, you don't need an app to do it.\nHolding the option button, click on the green icon on the top left.\n\nYou will see the option to Tile Window to Left of the screen.\nIf you don't hold the option, then spaces will be divided.\n\nA: I have used BetterTouchTool for a long time, but found it sometimes needed to be restarted because it stops working. \nI have also used Divvy, and am now switching to Divvy-only. \nMy personal setup is to use the tilt left/right scroll wheel buttons on a Logitech mouse to snap the windows to left/right halves of the screen. Clicking the scroll wheel button maximizes a window. Divvy doesn't allow mouse shortcuts AFAIK, so I used the Logitech control center to make those buttons trigger the shortcuts I configured in Divvy. If anyone is using a similar mouse maybe this is good info; Divvy is a great application either way.  \n\nA: Try using El Capitain's split screen mode\n\nA: By default, you can use the (green) maximize button on the window bar as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Click and hold the green maximize window button,you will notice a slight change in screen size.\n\n*Now drag the window to the left or right hand side.\n\n\nA: I'm using this with Monterey, despite is \"Looking for a new maintainer\" is a recommended alternative\nhttps://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt\n\n", "Q: Two iPhones on separate accounts I got a new iPhone, and I want to give my old one to my son.

I dont want to risk scratching such an expensive investment. Any recommendations on screen protectors which satisfy the following criteria?\n\n\n*\n\n*Fingerprint resistant \n\n*Retains the clarity of the retina display\n\n*Anti-glare \n\n*Does not interfere with the screen sensitivity \n\n*Does not interfere with swiping (you know.. that resistance you get when you\nswipe on plastic)\n\n\nI had a matte protector on and it did points 1,3,4 and 5 really well. But I guess that's a given with matte screens. But it scattered the light too much that I took it off. Need recommendations on clear screens which meet all the above criteria.\n\nA: There are several companies which offers you all 5 points. \nI've got a lot of experience with the Zagg Invisible Shields. They offer great quality and lifetime guarantee. But they are a bit expensive though. Quality comes at his price. \n\nThen there is BodyGuardz. A bit cheaper, lifetime replacements as well but I don't have any experience with it. And they don't seems to offer a specific protector for the new iPad, but the protector of the iPad 2 will fit. \n\n\nA: Personally I really like the matte protectors, but I had to accept that they do scatter light more, and visibly alter the clarity of the screen.  That being said, I recently decided to try a \"new material\" that a friend told me about, and I have to say it's hands down the best non-matte screen protector I've ever tried (out of maybe a half dozen different varieties).\nYou can find it on Amazon:  http://www.amazon.com/iSmooth-iPad-Screen-Protector-Replacement/dp/B00989QKA8/\nI'm not really sure what it is that's different, but somehow the material is a huge cut above the other (admittedly, cheaper) screen protectors I've tried.  Once it's on, it truly is invisible and the overall quality is way higher.  I wouldn't likely have spent this much on a screen protector (which I realize is a pretty lame reality... $600 device and I want to spend less than $5 to protect the screen??  How backwards is that??) but since a friend recommended it, I'm glad I did.  These really are, in my opinion, the best out there.  The price also appears to have dropped a bit since I bought mine, and considering the above is a 3-pack... they're about the same price as the inferior ones I've bought before.\nThey are not matte however, and I've written to the company requesting that they make a matte version.  If they could somehow make a matte one out of this same material, I think I'd have my 100% perfect solution, rather than the 95% perfect I have with their clear version.\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Can an iPad be child locked so they cannot escape from one app? I'm planning on getting an iPad, but it very much needs to be childlockable - that is I need the ability to lock it so only one app can be used unless a user has a pincode or password.  I'm presuming I'll have to jailbreak to get the functionality but I'm not sure where to go from there - any ideas? \nThis is the only feature I'm looking for - the app I'm wanting to access is likely 'prologue2go' but that's the only reason to purchase - I'm presuming I'll be getting an iPad2 simply because they are, and will be (I pressume) more stably jailbroken.\n\nA: This is now a feature in iOS 6 by using Accessibility. You can enable this feature by opening Settings > General > Accessibility > Guided Access. Here you can set a Passcode, enable Guided Access, and choose whether to allow the device to sleep or not (in this case you would want that enabled). After that, triple click the home button after opening the app, and configure the remainder of the settings.\nOne Caveat:\nThe only way to get out of Guided Access (without entering the passcode after triple clicking the home button) is to reboot the iDevice. This could be a good or bad thing, depending on the scenario. Obviously one could put a passcode on the device itself which would prevent the user from accessing everything else.\n\nA: Indeed. This behavior is not included by default in iOS. You'll have to jailbreak the iPad. Once you've jailbroken the iPad, install LockDown by using Cydia. It's from the BigBoss repository and it's free. It will allow you to do exactly what you want, lock one (or several) application.\nSince you're planning to buy an iPad 2, you'll have to wait until there is a jailbreak for 5.1 available (unless you bought one with maximum iOS 5.0.1). Rumors has it the jailbreak will be available within 2 months.\nOr if you have 5.0.1, you can take a look at this tutorial.\n\nA: When you get a jailbroken iPad, I'd recommend installing IncarcerApp - here's a review of it. It's a free tweak compatible with iOS 5 and iPad that lets you disable the home button and use an alternate volume-button-pressing method to access the homescreen. It also has extra features designed for parents helping a kid use an iPad successfully - rotation lock, alert blocking, etc.\nYou might actually consider getting an iPad 1, since it can be jailbroken on any iOS version due to jailbreakers having a bootrom exploit (very low-level exploit) available for it. The current jailbreak for iOS 5.1 on iPad 1 is only a tethered jaibreak, which means you need to boot the device by plugging it into a computer and running your jailbreaking tool, but that shouldn't be too much of a problem if you usually have a laptop nearby. Jailbreaking the iPad 2 depends on jailbreakers figuring out a totally new jailbreak for it each time a new iOS version is released, so if you have to restore the device, you might be waiting indefinitely for a new jailbreak to be released.\nThere are also special cases available for iPads that block usage of the home button - searching for \"childproof iPad case\" brings up a bunch of options.\n", "Q: How to transfer a movie (.avi) from pc to iPad without iTunes? I'm trying to copy a .avi movie-file that I ripped from a dvd that I own from my PC to my iPad. I've tried doing this with iTunes, to no avail, and frankly I'm sick of iTunes so I'm looking for alternative methods. So far, I have found none.\nDoes anyone know an easy way to transfer a file (specifically an .avi file), from a pc laptop (with windows Vista) to an iPad without iTunes? (Preferably through the usb connection?)\nps.: Don't worry about the .avi format, I've installed the flexplayer app on the iPad, which should be able to deal with movie formats other than .mp4 such as the .avi I've chosen here.\n\nA: There are a lot of alternatives for iTunes which will allow you to manage your iDevice. \nFloola, Songbird and Yamipod are three popular alternatives for iTunes. \nThen there is software which will allow you to treat your iDevice like a external hard drive, like iTransfer or SyncPod (not for Lion or iOS5). \nBut my overall favorite is Bigasoft iPad 2 Transfer. I've used it quite some time and I have no complaints about it.\nIf it's an option, you could try and stream it. Make an server out of your Mac and stream it with Air Video to your iPad.\nAnd there is even an alternative by using the cloud. Dropbox is a great example of this. It's all listed in this article of MacWorld, which made me wonder if you even have searched far and wide enough :)\n\nA: Doesn't satisfy your \"USB connection\" criteria, but the Buzz Player app for iPad can play video files off any machine on your local network (provided you can reach it via SMB or FTP), and offers the option to copy them over to the iPad first.\n\nA: I often use DropBox for this and either re-use an existing account or simply make a new account for just this purpose. Presumably you have WiFi when you are at your iTunes to USB to iPad location and can just dump all the AVI files into dropbox. The iPad dropbox app will hopefully see that flex:player has registered to play AVI files and offer to send the file to the app from within iOS rather than how the flex:player wants you to use iTunes to copy the documents into the app.\nAlternatively, you could use a program similar to PhoneView to replicate the function iTunes serves by mounting the iPad so you can copy files directly into flex:player's documents folder on the iPad. That would totally bypass iTunes and still use the USB cable as you asked.\n\nA: GoodReader supports file transfer from your Mac or PC using:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB, using there own GoodReaderUSB app\n\n*USB, using iTunes file transfer\n\n*WiFi, using the in-app GoodReader webserver on your iPhone or iPad\n\n\nOnce your video is in GoodReader you can use 'open in…' to open it in whatever app supports the filetype. GoodReader is one of those 'swiss army apps' which does a bunch of things. It is considered an invaluable tool.\nIt supports both iPhone and iPad, and costs US$5.\n\nA: This is something I found by thinking out loud what would happen if I connect my ipad to ubuntu directly since they are both unix-based.\nIf you connect the ipad by usb to your ubuntu notebook or desktop, it will show two drives in the ubuntu file manager - /documents, /ipad. In /documents you can find the folder for your apps (dropbox, vlc, acrobat, etc). You can just drag and drop your large files directly and it will be as fast as your usb can. The /ipad drive is for itunes folders and it doesn't seem to work adding files in there. But you can open the dcim folder in there and get your ipad photos and videos.\nPS: Here's the caveat. I upgraded the ipad to iOS6 and now I cannot drag files into /documents drive.\n", "Q: Prevent other users from ejecting (or even seeing) my mounted disk images I have an encrypted disk image (sparsebundle) where all of my private documents are stored; I mount it to a custom mount point with:\nmkdir -p /Users/gabriele/MyDocs\nhdiutil attach /MyDocs.sparsebundle -mountpoint /Users/gabriele/MyDocs\n\nOther users see the mounted disk image in the Finder window sidebar and maybe also on their Desktops (according to Finder preferences), but they cannot access the volume because of unsufficient privileges. In any case other users can eject the volume, and this is bad.\nIs there a way to prevent other users from ejecting my volumes, or even seeing this volume if they don't have enough privileges to view its innards?\n\nA: To help make the mounted disk image less visible, you can run the SetFile command to make the volume's directory invisible. This will make the mounted disk image be less-obviously visible in the Finder sidebar for other users. Of course, this makes it less visible to you, too, but you can make an alias in the Finder to where the folder should be for you.\nRun SetFile to make the mounted disk image image be invisible in the Finder:\nSetFile -a V /Users/gabriele/MyDocs\n\nOpen the disk image location in the Finder:\nopen /Users/gabriele/MyDocs\n\nMake an alias to make it easy for you to open the now-hidden MyDocs. Within the open Finder window, grab the folder icon in the top center where it says \"MyDocs\" and then drag that while holding down the Option+Command keys and release it on your Desktop, just not to /Users/gabriele, because you will need to rename the alias first, otherwise it will not let you copy it. So rename the dragged-off \"MyDoc\" to \"MyDoc alias\", then move it to /Users/gabriele or wherever you like. Now you should have the alias \"MyDoc alias\" to your hidden MyDoc directory, other users will not see it in the Finder sidebar.\nNote: Xcode needs to be installed in order to use SetFile. Additionally, I had to relaunch the Finder on Lion for the mounted disk image to become invisible, try that if you can't get MyDoc to disappear.\nNot sure how to prevent ejection, since anyone with access to Disk Utility, the mount command, etc. can see the path to it and un-mount it for you. However, making it invisible does lessen the need to make it un-ejectable, since it will not be in other users' faces in the Finder as an option to eject.\n", "Q: iPhone is confused with iMessages I have a contact, Niels; he has an iPhone too, and he uses iMessages, just as I am. For some reason, I've got 2 conversations going on with Niels although the contact card both contains the e-mail and the phone number. \n \nWhen you delete one conversation, you delete both conversations. \nAm I using iMessages the wrong way?\nIs this a known bug?\nIs my iPhone messed up with the use of BiteSMS and other jailbreak tools?\n\nA: It's possible that one of you is using the phone number to initiate a message, and the other is using an email address.  Starting from a blank slate, send a message, and have Niels reply, do you then have a single session, or 2?  If this is behaving oddly, try initiating the chat with both email and phone numbers, and see what happens.\nYour recent contacts will likely show both messages from e-mail and phone number.  You might think that the iPhone should match and merge both conversations but in fact they remain separate for good reason.  Imagine you have an iPhone and an iPad, messages to the phone number only go to the phone, messages to the email go to both. It's a case of knowing how to reply. If it merged the 2, which would it choose to reply to?  It would have to choose the email address, as it's portable, the phone number isn't.  Any attempt to merge could leave one of your devices only getting half the replies, or the inability to reply if replying to an iPad from an iPhone that has decided to use the phone number as the primary contact choice.\n", "Q: Clarify costs on my credit card printout when buying apps.

As a group (work, family,...), you produce an Aperture library on your computer.\nOthers (spouse, coworker...) in the group now want to access and edit this library from other computers.\nAny solutions?\n\nA: Put the library file in a folder that is accessible to other computers and set permissions so that it can be accessed/edited by other users. You also need to be certain that only one person is editing the file at any given time – the software isn't designed as a shared database and I don't know what, if any, protections it provides against this scenario. \nYou can also use referenced images instead of managed and put those images in a shared space. However, other users will only have access to the master images and you will want to beware of external edits that are destructive to those master files. Changes to that file hierarchy itself (file moves, renames, etc) made outside of Aperture will result in broken links and you'll have to relocate the images from inside Aperture. . I prefer the simplicity, security and beauty of a managed library. \nIn what way is this lock-in? It's a simple case of access to a database file. Granted the file — a sparse bundle containing images, metadata and edit instructions in which your master images are stored in their original format — is proprietary to Aperture but the master files remain available should you lose Aperture for some reason.\n\nAccessing the files contained within the Aperture Library package using a right (control)-click\n\nInside the library bundle your master images are filed, hierarchically by import date, in their original format. They can be copied out as you wish.\nI fail to see this as an example of Apple forcing the eco system on you. You are not forced to use Aperture if you don't like it's features and limitations and departure is a simple export (of versions and masters) or \"unbundling\" of the library file (masters only) away. \nBeautiful indeed.\n", "Q: Risks of upgrading from OS X 10.5.8 to 10.6.3 Knowing little about OSX, a friend has asked me to help upgrade their machine from OS X 10.5.8 to 10.6.3; what are the risks of doing so, if any, and what is the best way to mitigate them? \n\nA: As with any major change to an OS I'd recommend taking a backup of the machine before the migration. TimeMachine is the Apple's built in backup software. If your upgrade goes poorly you'll be able to restore from a TimeMachine backup without supplying OS media. To ensure that you have a complete and consistent TimeMachine backup I'd recommend running the backup with all applications closed. Preferably get a few different backups so you have multiple points to roll back to.\nSecondly, I'd check the installed third party applications and their compatibility with 10.6, some applications might not support 10.6 and will need to be updated to continue to work. You could install a third party program that will track application that will inform you of application updates. I use, and would recommend, AppFresh for this purpose.\n", "Q: How do you use small caps in Pages? I don't see any obvious options for small caps in Pages, either under styles or text formatting.

(One I found is Avenir.  I was wishing for it in Helvetica Neue.)  As described in this blog post and the comment above, If the feature is available for the font, you can open the OSX Font panel (Cmd-T or Format->Font->Show Fonts... in most apps) and select Typography... under the \"gear\" menu.  Look especially for Lower Case\nAs the linked blog post notes, for the Pages app in particular, you can also create and save a \"character style\" to make it faster to select.  Other than that, this should work the same in any app that uses the standard font panel such as TextEdit, Bean, etc.\n", "Q: How to do a screen capture from iPad 3? I need to record me using an iPad while I am drawing on it (with Penultimate). I usually use ScreenFlow to record onscreen actions on my desktop Mac, so I need a way to display iPad on my Mac. Is there a way to do screen sharing? Or, I suppose I could do a screen capture right from my iPad. Any suggestions? Thanks,\nUPDATE: One solution for 10.7.3 and iPad 3 is Reflection + ScreenFlow, no cords:\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/22358199/testRef2/index.html\n\nA: Tricky one, but you can rig up a solution - I'm not sure about the final quality though.\nFirst, you need to allow your iPad to use AirPlay Mirroring with your iMac as the target device.\nTo do this, you need to use a program like AirServer ($15 for a single user license) or Reflector ($15 again, but has a trial at least) or AirMac (Free, but not as fully featured) or AirPlayer (Similarly beta).  Mountain Lion will have this feature built in, potentially.\nWhen this installed, check you can get it to work - so ensure the iPad and iMac are on the same wireless network, and turn on Airplay Mirroring, pointing it at the correct host:\n\nYou should get a window displaying the contents on your Mac.  Note, than even if you are using the top of the line iMac, the resolution of the iPad will still be too large to view without scaling, so expect some downscaling, either by the airplay protocol or the receiving app anyway, simply to ensure it fits on your screen.  Given a choice, a neat halving to get the original 1024x768 resolution should suffice.  The method of doing this will be different depending on which app you end up using.\nOnce you have a window running with out iPad screen in it, you can capture it with Quicktime.  I note that you already use ScreenFlow (which I missed at first), so you can do this your own way, but for everyone else you can do it with build in tools like Quicktime.  I am going to assume you are on Lion.  Open up Quicktime Player, and go File > New Screen Recording  Hit the big red recording button, and you get the message Click to record the full screen.  Drag to record part of the screen  Drag a neat square over your Airplay receiving window, adjusting as required to get a neat fit, then hit the record button in the middle, and do your stuff.\nCAVEAT: Lots of things can affect quality using this method.  Your wireless network may be slow, resulting in dropped frames or lag when recording.  Your computer may be slow, or busy, resulting in dropped frames etc etc etc.  Quicktime (if you use it) is already by definition recording a compressed video, not raw, and it's using an image source on your screen that is already displaying a video that has been compressed down from Retina resolution to something saner for desktop use.  This method works, but the resulting video quality can vary wildly depending on your setup.  You can mitigate to an extent with thoughtful configuration of your network and so on, or by using more expensive screen capture solutions that record raw etc, that but is up to you to decide how much quality you need.  As it stands, the test video I put up was more than sufficient to be perfectly pleasant on YouTube.\n\nNow, time to own up, I cannot get it to work with the free versions on\n  offer, but I have in the past, so I'm throwing the solution up anyway,\n  in case it's just me being stupid.\n\nI have used the trial version (limited to 10 minutes) of Reflector though, and created the following video as an example, proving it can be done, but you may need to cough up for paid software to do so:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1fyp8QzWeg\n\nEDIT: Since this answer was accepted, many of the software solutions listed have included screen recording directly within the airdisplay software, negating the need to arrange a separate quicktime screen recording, and potentially improving quality.\n\nA: On an iPad 2 or iPad (3rd Generation) almost every video signal can be mirrored out via the dock port and an appropriate cable/adaptor — VGA, or HDMI. That video signal can be input into a capture device, be that a computer or a dedicated device.\nI've linked to the Apple versions of the video out adaptors, but there are also third-party versions available, often at a lower cost.\nApple sells a composite video out cable that fits into the iPad dock but, unfortunately, video mirroring doesn't support composite output. If you want to use a composite capture device for the Mac, for example, the Elgato Video Capture , you'll need to use the Digital Video (HDMI) adaptor and an external device to convert that signal to composite video. You can also do the same from a VGA output using a different converter. Again, these products are linked for reference only, I'm not endorsing hardware or source.\nIf you can live with lower resolution, Steven Sande outlined a budget solution for getting analog video into a Mac in TUAW's iPad 2 video mirroring to Mac, the cheap and dirty way\nPersonally I would use a hardware solution or the AirServer workflow and avoid the security and functionality risks inherent to a jailbreak, but that's a personal preference. If you do decide to go the jailbreak route, be certain to educate yourself as to the risks as well as the benefits and make your choice accordingly.\n\nA: If you've jailbroken your iPad (which you'll be able to do within a few weeks), there is Display Recorder ($1.99). \nAnother way to do it, is explained in this MacMost podcast. But it involves a huge setup (including a HDMI cable and extra software on your Mac), so I would wait for the jailbreak :)\n\nA: A late answer, but pertinent.  As of iOS8, simply attaching your iOS device to a Mac with the lightning Cable (not sure if this works with devices that support iOS8 but stil use the 30 pin dock connector, e.g. iPhone 4S, iPad 3) allows the display to be used as a camera input in Quicktime.  Simply connect, go to New Movie Recording, and then choose your device from the drop down list of sources.  It can also attach a voice track at the same time.\nThis method has the advantage over the others of quality, and price.  It's higher resolution, better bitrate, and free.  Also, it totally replaces your status bar, thus hiding the bright blue \"I'm using AirPlay Mirroring\" highlights, removing your cell carrier details, and showing the time as 9:41 with permanent 100% battery - just like Apple demos.\nExample:\nhttp://cl.ly/1j33302L0a1n/testmax720.mov\n", "Q: Can I remove Recovery HD partition? We replaced the hard drive with a Patriot SSD in our iMac at work. I messed up while cloning the drive to the new SSD using a GPartEd CD. Everything works but there is about 40 GB unpartitioned that I want to recover. I cannot extend the main Macintosh HD partition using Disk Utility because the Recovery HD partition is \"in the way\", it is right after the Macintosh HD partition and all the free space is after the Recovery HD partition.\nSo, in short, is it safe to delete the Recovery HD partition? If not is there an easy way for me to remove it, resize my main partition, and then create a new Recovery HD partition?\nAlso, just out of curiosity, what does the Recovery HD partition do? Disk Utility seems to imply it has something to do with the bootloader but that doesn't make sense to me.\nEdit: Partial duplicate of Can I repartition my primary hard drive without removing the Lion recovery partition?\n\nA: Start by reading this document from Apple, which explains the recovery partition in Lion. From the article:\n\nOS X Lion includes a new feature called Lion Recovery that includes\n  all of the tools you need to reinstall Lion, repair your disk, and\n  even restore from a Time Machine backup without the need for optical\n  discs.\n\nIn short, if you remove this partition you'll need a Lion USB drive, or physical media to perform the actions described by Apple above.\nTo reclaim the space of the recovery partition follow the steps below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal.app\n\n*Run the commands below (omit the # and everything after)\n\n\n\n$ diskutil list                                   # list disk partitions\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Nymeria                 499.2 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 <---\n$ diskutil eraseVolume HFS+ Blank /dev/disk0s3    # Erase Recovery HD\n$ diskutil mergePartitions HFS+ \"Nymeria\" disk0s2 disk0s3  # Merge partitions / reclaim space\n\nOne thing to note here, you can only merge consecutive partitions. If you have disk0s2 and disk0s4 running diskutil mergePartitions HFS+ \"Nymeria\" disk0s2 disk0s4 will merge partitions disk02s2, disk02s3, disk02s4. Also, only the data on the first partition will be preserved when merging. As an example, if your Recovery HD is disk0s3 and your OS partition is disk0s4, merging using diskutil is not possible. Use extreme caution modifying your partition table, and I'd highly recommend taking a full backup before hand.\n\nA: Lion Recovery Partition is a hidden partition that provides an alternative boot drive from which you can run disk repair utilities or initiate a re-install of the OS.\n\nOS X Lion includes a built in set of utilities in the Recovery HD.\n  Restart your Mac and hold down the Command key and the R key\n  (Command-R), and keep holding them until the Apple icon appears,\n  indicating that your Mac is starting up. After the Recovery HD is\n  finished starting up, you should see a desktop with a Mac OS X menu\n  bar and a \"Mac OS X Utilities\" application window.\n  (ᔥ Apple: OS X Lion: About Lion Recovery)\n\nIt can be removed, though you shouldn't need to because it should be on one end of the drive or the other and not be in the way. It can also be added after the fact if necessary—I once did so by reinstalling the OS over my existing version.\n", "Q: Can't login to Lync for Mac 2011 I am unable to login to my corporate Lync 2010 server. I'm up to date with Microsoft updates to Mac Office 2011. I've tried automatic and manual configuration. I've tried with and without Kerberos authentication. I know I have proper credentials because I can login to the Windows version of Lync from a Windows session in Fusion.\nIs anyone else using Lync for Mac 2011 on a corporate network? Anyone experience this issue and find a fix or a workaround?\n\nA: I was able to resolve this issue in two steps. \n\n\n*\n\n*I imported the root certificate from my corporate Lync Server to my MacBook Pro and configured it as Always Trust(ed) for all options\n\n*I generated a kerberos ticket on my MacBook Pro using the terminal command kinit\n\n\nThe level of trust on the root cert maybe overkill, but it works. I have to regenerate the kerberos ticket periodically otherwise I am not able to sign-in to Lync, but I resolved this with an Automator app that runs the kinit command when I login to my MBP.\nHope this helps someone down the line. Cheers!\n", "Q: MacBook kernel panic error screen on boot This MacBook had milk spilled on the keyboard a few months ago. It's continued to work, with a few of the letter keys no longer functioning, up until this point. Now, upon start up, the MacBook just displays an error screen and performs no other function. \nThe error message:\n\nIs there any saving this MacBook from becoming an expensive paper weight??\n\nA: You should take the computer in to your local Apple Store or Apple Authorized reseller. It may be that the milk (or milk residues) finally dripped down enough to short out parts of the motherboard.\nDon't try lying to them; fess up to the milk spill and maybe you'll get lucky. In any case, you're looking at what is likely to be an expensive repair (involving the motherboard, keyboard, and anything in between).\n", "Q: iPhone simulator on iPad When using an iPad if you download and use an iphone application, an iphone outline will appear on the screen with the application inside. \n\nI'm looking for a way to switch between viewing websites normally as they would appear on the iPad and iphone view.\nWhat would be the best way of going about this?\n\nA: Download an iPad browser, such as Dolphin Browser or Opera Mini.\nThen download a web browser that is iPhone/iPod touch only, such as Mango Browser, iFox FREE, Sphere, or Full Screen Web Browser (99¢). Then you can run an iPad browser in the full iPad mode and run another browser that is in the 1x 2x iPhone mode.\n", "Q: How do I display a hyperlink with an AppleScript? I am trying to get a URL via AppleScript, then displaying it as a clickable link via a window. How do I do this? (if I need to use Xcode for this, please add the answer, but provide detailed instructions, please)\n\nA: AppleScript itself cannot display rich text (HTML) in a popup dialog. So your options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Display a normal text dialog with AppleScript, showing the URL and asking the user if she wants to go there. If user clicks \"OK\", open that URL (that's exactly 1 click, so pretty much equivalent to a clickable link).\n-- tested with Safari 5.1.7 on Mac OS X 10.6.8\nset theUrl to \"http://j.mp/LgHoEB\"\ntry\n    display dialog theUrl & \"\\nClick OK to open this URL in Safari.\" with title \"Open URL?\" with icon caution\n    if button returned of result is \"OK\" then\n        tell application \"Safari\" to make new document with properties {URL:theUrl}\n    end if\non error number -128 -- user cancelled\n    -- do something else\nend try\n\n  \n\n*Use the Safari AppleScript command do JavaScript to make a JavaScript popup with the desired URL as a clickable link (and possibly some more custom HTML):\n-- tested with Safari 5.1.7 on Mac OS X 10.6.8\nset theUrl to \"http://j.mp/LgHoEB\"\nset JSPopup to \"(function() {\" & ¬\n    \"var w = window.open('', 'Clickable link');\" & ¬\n    \"w.document.write(\" & ¬\n    \"'<html><body><p>\" & ¬\n    \"<a href=\\\"\" & theUrl & \"\\\">\" & theUrl & \"</a>\" & ¬\n    \"</p></body></html>'\" & ¬\n    \");})()\"\ntell application \"Safari\"\n    do JavaScript JSPopup in current tab of window 1\nend tell\n\nOf course, this will only work if your Safari allows popup windows (with my settings, for instance, a new tab is opened instead).\n\nA: Until now links cannot be made clickable in apple scripts but there can be a way around.

For example this wp install is at something like this:\nwptest.ryankeefer.computername.local\nI'm wondering if it is trying to find the wp-content dir at \"ryankeefer.computername.local\" rather than where it's actually at (wptest.ryankeefer.computername.local). Any ideas on how to get it pointed to the right place?\nI can obviously get around the FTP portion for adding and upgrading plugins to the wp-content/plugins/ directory directly, but would like to have the FTP option as well.\n\nA: To find a folder on your filesystem open the Terminal.app then run (omitting $):\n$ find / -name \"wp-content\" -type d\n\nOr since you're looking for the wp-content for wptest:\n$ find / -name \"wp-content\" -type d | grep -i wptest\n\nAlternatively you could look for MAMP's httpd.conf file, open it in your favorite editor, and locate the DocumentRoot path for the subdomain you're trying to access:\n$ find / -name \"httpd.conf\" -type f\n\nTake the path that is returned and paste that in to your FTP client's path bar, or use Finder to browse to that path.\nAs a recommendation, I think you'd be better served by not FTP'ing to your local machine unless you have some fancy reason for doing so. FTP by itself is insecure, deprecated and moving forward I'd recommend you enable Remote Login (under System Settings -> Sharing) and transfer files using SCP... though I'd just use Finder, or point your editor directly to the path of your development environment.\n", "Q: Use Textmate (or any arbitrary application) with Lion's \"Versions\" feature? I'm writing a thesis in LaTeX with TextMate. I want very simple, very automated version control. Nothing complicated! Just, every time I save, a new version is created so that I can easily go back in time and look at previous versions. Lion's \"Versions\" feature is perfect for me but doesn't work with TextMate.\nIs there a plugin I could use to get this to work? Alternatively, is there a different form of version control that's super easy to use?\nI realise TeXShop now has Versions support (courtesy of this question Which text editors take advantage of Lion's Versions feature?), but I'd rather stick with TextMate if at all possible.\n\nA: Scouring the TextMate community and community plugins doesn't show that this feature is currently available in TextMate. This blog post states that they're \"holding back with 'lionizing' TextMate till we feel confident we can fully drop backwards compatibility\".\nYou're not alone though, the community seems to be very interested in this feature.\nI don't have experience with this plugin, but the community seems to enjoy the ProjectPlus plugin.\n", "Q: iPad 2 vs iPad 3 stylus sensitivity My iPad 3 is noticibly less sensitive to my stylus than my iPad 2. (For instance, on my iPad 2, barely brushing my stylus against the screen, even in the slightest, has an effect; on my iPad 3, I must apply enough pressure to visibly deform the tip of the stylus.)\nMy question is: is there a setting to change this sensitivity?\n\nA: There is no way to adjust the pressure sensitivity unfortunately. However, there are several pressure sensitive styluses (styli? I've never had to pluralise stylus before) on  the market or at least in development. \nCheck out the Jot-Touch.\nThe Pressure Pen and Ten One's Blue Tiger are still in development.\nWacom's Bamboo Pen isn't pressure sensitive, but it does improve pressure sensitivity.\n\nA: I made my own using extremely fine steel wool (does not harm the glass in any way).  There are Youtube videos on how to make them.  The resulting stylus is infinitely more sensitive than the dozen or so commercial styli I have tried on both an iPad 2 and 3.  It's more like a paint brush than a stylus in fact, though there are ways to stiffen it just slightly and get a perfect \"happy medium\".  Check Youtube and you should be able to find more specifics.\n", "Q: How to extend the functionality of Open and Save dialogs of OS X applications? On Windows there are several third-party applications that can be used to improve the standard Open and Save dialogs.\nI am looking for features like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Being able to delete files from the these dialogs.\n\n*Being able to move files.\n\n*Remember dialog size or common directories per application (not all apps are able to do things like this).\n\n\nIf the solutions are commercial, please mention the price.\n\nA: Step one - try the free trial of DefaultFolderX (30$).\nStep two - buy it.\nThese is no step three. It's that good. \n", "Q: How do I copy the text content of a dialog box on OS X? Many people are not aware that on Windows you can copy the whole text content of a MessageBox by pressing Ctrl ⌃ + C when the dialog is focused.\nThis is an essential feature for reporting error messages, and in some cases these could be huge.\nStill, it seems that on OS X, that Command ⌘ + C does not work and I'm wondering if there is another method for doing this. \nDoing screenshots is not so convenient, especially that they are not searchable :p\nI am looking for a generic solution, if it exists. Here is an example:\n\n\nA: The most generic way may be to use the Accessibility Inspector and copy the text form its window.\n\nIn Mac OS X v10.4 and later, Apple provides the Accessibility Inspector testing tool...\nAccessibility Inspector presents a utility window that displays the attributes (and values), actions, and position in the accessibility hierarchy of the object currently under the mouse pointer. To use Accessibility Inspector, be sure to enable assistive applications in the Universal Access Preferences.\n\n\nHere is an example for Trim Enabler, where you can't select and copy the text of the \"About\" tab:\n\nAnd the window displayed by Accessibility Inspector:\n\nThis is with the mouse pointer hovering over the long text, which can then be found in AXValue.\nEdit 2014-10-18:\nThe next example shows step-by-step how to copy text that is not selectable using Accessibility Inspector 4.0:\nOpen the window from where the information shall be extracted and open Accessibility Inspector, then hover the mouse pointer over the element of interest:\n\nPress Command ⌘ + 7 to lock Accessibility Inspector, then click on the line you want to copy (e.g. AXValue) and press Command ⌘ + C to copy it to the clipboard:\n\nPaste the copied text where needed:\n\n\nA: The general case is that the programmer needs to expose this text on a dialog by dialog basis, so you can't easy just copy the text unless the program intends for you to have that function.\nThe things you could do, but seem more work than it's worth is enable universal access where the text could be sent to an external device such as a braille display or other special purpose device and somehow captured.\nYou could also try to crack that program and modify the dialog call to change things so that it's always selectable. That might make a better question for the programming side of things.\nYou've done the practical thing - take a snapshot and hope the message is logged elsewhere to a text file. Linking to this question might be a nice way to ask the developer of programs where you need this ability to modify their coding practice like Safari, Terminal and other programs mentioned in the comments above.\n\nA: You can also run a script like this in AppleScript Editor:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    value of UI elements of windows of process \"Application Name\"\nend tell\n\nIf you don't see the text in the results, try to add one or more UI elements of parts after value of.\n", "Q: Endianness of iPhones? I know iPhones (and iPads) run on ARM processors, which are little-endian by default (and iOS on itself is little-endian according to the Wikipedia page); however, ARM processors supposedly have the ability to switch between little-endian and big-endian. How possible is this and how does it work?\n\nA: even if you think you do not need to know the endianness someone might do. No need to explain why someone does not need it because you may do not know the context. The question is not \"do I need to know endianness\" but rather \"is it big- or little endian\". So concentrate on the subject please!\nHaving said that probably it is the best practice if we do not re-invent the wheel and just rely on the macros Apple provides for this. The reason is because they have spend quite some time to optimize these macros and made sure that works well with the simulator as well as on Mac, iPhone and all of their OS' and hardware.\nIf you dig down what is happening when you invoke CFSwapInt16BigToHost you may can see comments that suggests these macros are producing probably the best machine code you can get with the help of the compiler optimization: \nOS_INLINE\nuint16_t\n_OSSwapInt16(\n    uint16_t        data\n)\n{\n  /* Reduces to 'rev16' with clang */\n  return (uint16_t)(data << 8 | data >> 8);\n}\n\nOS_INLINE\nuint32_t\n_OSSwapInt32(\n    uint32_t        data\n)\n{\n#if defined(__llvm__)\n  data = __builtin_bswap32(data);\n#else\n  /* This actually generates the best code */\n  data = (((data ^ (data >> 16 | (data << 16))) & 0xFF00FFFF) >> 8) ^ (data >> 8 | data << 24);\n#endif\n\n  return data;\n}\n\n\nA: Endianness isn't something that end users have any real interaction with - but here is a 10,000 foot summary of what this means for users of Apple products.\nIn a nutshell - endianness for an internal processor is the same as the writing direction for a language. When you look at letters of an english text, we all agree to start on the top left and read first right then down. Other languages start on the right and read to the left and some even read down first before moving left or right.\nIt doesn't really matter to a user if the bits in an internal representation of an address or number gets stored little endian or big endian. In fact OS X on a Mac adheres to a big-endian representation and iOS adheres to little-endian ordering. This fact doesn't in any way mean that the two devices can't work together properly. This works because this representation only happens internally and doesn't get exposed to us as users.\n", "Q: If I get a second iPad will I have access to all my apps? Do I need to purchase them separately for every iPad I have?\n\nA: As long as you log in on both iOS devices with your same login from Apple (or backup and install them with the same login on your Mac/PC with iTunes), you will be able to use the same apps and other data without the need to purchase them again.\nYou can still manage your apps separately for each device: For instance, iTunes will keep them apart (you get to name each device yourself), and you can install different sets of apps and photos, music and all on the devices. But anything that comes from the App Store is linked to your Apple ID login - and once you've purchase something with your ID, you can install it on all your devices.\n\nA: I'd also like to add some info.\nIn iOS 5 you can set your devices to automatically sync new apps. This means that they will appear on all your devices once you have bought them. (However, this does mean several devices will start downloading apps as soon as you purchase them, and therefore use up considerable bandwidth, and a fair portion of your data allowance)\nThis can be set for music and other stuff you buy in the itunes store. Unfortunately this does not work for songs you add manually.\nThere is an alternative, for some files you can use dropbox or a similar service to transfer the data between your devices. But that is not syncing anymore.\n", "Q: Is there a music application that integrates with iTunes and shows the waveform of the song?

Is there such an application?\n\nA: Have you seen Capo? I have the iPad version, and it does what you want. I assume the desktop version does the same.\n\nA: djay is what I was looking for. I really like it, as it integrates with your iTunes library, and auto-updates when you add new songs to your library.

My (bilingual) mom just recently bought an iPad.  When typing in Korean, her native language, she became irritated by the autocorrect feature -- it would often suggest incorrect spelling corrections, forcing her to pause typing to press the 'x' button to cancel it.  However, because she's not proficient in English, she found the autocorrect feature very useful when typing in English.\nWe found a way to completely disable autocorrect, but couldn't find a way to selectively enable it based on the keyboard language.  Is there a way to do this, or something similar?  Alternatively, is there a way to configure the settings so that the autocorrect suggestions do not automatically take effect after hitting the spacebar?\n(If it matters, she has an iPad 3 (I think.  I'm pretty new to Apple too))\n\nA: I just found a great solution for this problem: Install Gboard which is Google board and it's English.

So I thought I could use AppleScript.\nI'd have to perform these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect to a network drive (smb://myserver/public, where every user has different login names and passwords, so wiring the usernames and passwords in the code is not an option).\n\n*Navigate to a folder on the network drive (every user has a different folder on the network drive).\n\n*Copy a certain file from the user's desktop to the opened folder on the network drive.\n\n\nSo when running the script the user has to enter his or her username and password for connecting the network drive, and the user has to enter the name of the folder they should copy the file to.\nCan the name of the folder be stored permanently somehow? So the user won't have to enter the folder name each time when he or she runs this script. But from time-to-time these folders may change, so there has to be an option to change the folder before copying.\nAlso how can I check if the network drive is already mounted, so the user won't be asked for username and password each time he or she runs this script?\n\nHere is how far I've been able to go in assembling a script to accomplish this task:\nI'm struggling to understand how AppleScript likes to store a path to a file/folder on a mounted network drive. \nSo here is what I have now:\nproperty userName : \"myfolder\"\nproperty folderName : \"myusername\"\n\nproperty serverName : \"public\"\nproperty serverAddress : \"smb://myserver/public\"\nproperty serverStatus : 0\n\non connectToServer()\n    global userName\n    global folderName\n    global serverName\n    global serverAddress\n    global serverStatus\n\n    set mountedDisks to list disks\n    if mountedDisks does not contain serverName then\n        mount volume serverAddress as user name userName with password (display dialog \"Enter password for\" & quoted form of serverName with title \"\" default answer \"\" giving up after 3 with hidden answer)\n    end if\n\n    set mountedDisks to list disks\n    if mountedDisks contains serverName then\n        set serverStatus to 1\n    else\n        connectToServer()\n    end if\nend connectToServer\n\non mainLoop()\n    global userName\n    global folderName\n    global serverName\n    global serverAddress\n    global serverStatus\n\n    if serverStatus is equal to 0 then\n        connectToServer()\n    end if\n\n    set mainDialog to display dialog ¬\n        \"Your username: \" & userName & \"\nYour folder's name: \" & folderName buttons {\"Quit\", \"Settings\", \"Copy file\"} with title \"File Copier\" default button 1\n    set mainDialogAnswer to button returned of mainDialog\n\n    if mainDialogAnswer is equal to \"Quit\" then\n        quit\n    end if\n\n    if mainDialogAnswer is equal to \"Settings\" then\n        display dialog \"Enter your username\" with title \"Step 1 of 2\" default answer userName\n        set userName to {text returned of result}\n\n        display dialog \"Enter your folder's name\" with title \"Step 2 of 2\" default answer folderName\n        set folderName to {text returned of result}\n\n        mainLoop()\n    end if\n\n    if mainDialogAnswer is equal to \"Copy\" then\n        -- copy the file\n    end if\nend mainLoop\n\nmainLoop()\n\n\nA: Copying of files in Applescript is best done either through System Events or Finder, using the duplicate … to command, i.e.\ntell application \"System Events\" to duplicate sourceFile to targetFolder\n\nwhere both sourceFile and targetFolder need to be the correct object type for the application used – meaning disk item or finder item (both objects can be created from AppleScript alias objects, or textual path values with a bit of type coercion – I’d add the details, but you have not stated how the paths to both are stored / acquired in your script).\nA few notes on your code:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is no need to use globals when you have defined them as properties already. AppleScript properties are script scoped and persist across execution – they are only reset when the script is recompiled. If you assign those that need user setting missing value when declaring, you can even check if they are already set and skip re-prompting the user (there would be an even more comfortable and secure solution if Apple hadn’t deprecated Keychain Access Scripting).\n\n*There is no need for the repeated assignments and recursive call in your connectToServer() handler. The following code\nset timeOutCounter to 0\nrepeat while (list disks) does not contain serverName and timeOutCounter is less than timeOutInterval\n    -- mount drive\n    delay someInterval -- recommended, so you don’t hectically loop\n    set timeOutCounter to timeOutCounter + someInterval -- time out loop \nend repeat\n\nwill try to connect in the interval defined by someInterval, until the mount is available or timeOutIntervalis reached (assuming these values are declared. As properties, best – see above).\n\n*You might also want to offer your user a more comfortable way of selecting the target folder than typing a folder name from memory. Check out Standard Additions’s AppleScript dictionary for the choose folder command.\n\n*Finally, but that is mainly a matter of taste and coding style, I’d rather move the display dialog command into its own handler and call that, if needed repeatedly, from the script body, than use a C style mainLoop handler. I’ve found that, generally speaking, AppleScript runs out of Stack space easily when recursing and can get very confused about variable assignments, so it is a good idea to avoid recursive constructs where they are not necessary.\n\n", "Q: How does Back To My Mac work without UPnP or NAT-PMP? Back To My Mac (BTMM) used to require UPnP or NAT-PMP on your router to work, but at some point this changed and it can work (albeit slowly) without those.\nBTMM (usually?) works by setting up an encrypted IPv6 tunnel over IPv4 between the two hosts, and with UPnP/NAT-PMP, the appropriate ports are forwarded on the router at each end, allowing a direct connection.\nBut how does it work when there's no UPnP/NAT-PMP?\nI noticed that it's much slower if either end doesn't have UPnP/NAT-PMP (I get a ~40ms ping if both ends have the automatic config, and about 1000ms if they don't), so I'm wondering where the traffic goes — presumably it has to go via Apple servers if a direct connection can't be automatically negotiated?\nBut even with just plain old NAT, is it not possible for a 3rd party to arbitrate a connection between two NAT'ed hosts?\nIs there a way to tell how that IPv6 tunnel is getting set up? I can't figure it out from the output of ifconfig, traceroute, traceroute6, netstat or lsof...\nFor bonus points, is it possible to set up static port forwards on a router that lacks UPnP/NAT-PMP in order to get BTMM working directly, rather than in this slower mode?\n\nA: You probably already read did-you-realize-apples-back-to-my-mac-mobileme-service-uses-ipv6 by now. It has some of the answers.\nAlso https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KAME_project\nI don't know how much was changed since MobileMe became iCloud.\nlsof -i:4500\nShows that the process 'racoon' is handling the tunnel. This port is also opened on the router.\nI wonder what it does with mdsDirectory.db.\nAlso, it would be nice if BTMM worked also without tunneling and instead used native IPv6 when possible.\n", "Q: how to rename a pdf in ibooks on ipod I just downloaded 40+ chapters of a medical reference book onto my ipod touch. They were not available to download as a whole book so I had to download them one at a time. I put them all in a folder in ibooks. Instead of being labelled \"chapter 1\" or \"chapter 2\" etc, they are all labelled by the name of the book (that is, they all have the same label). This makes referencing them much harder. I want to be able to find certain chapters quickly. Can I rename these pdfs so they can be easier to reference?   Thanks\n\nA: In the PDF directory or folder you have your files, touch the \"select\" option on the top right. Then touch the name of the file you want to rename and the cursor will appear.  Simply delete the garbled-up iBooks name and type the new file name. Finally, touch the aforementioned \"select\" option to save it. \n", "Q: iPod failed during update I have just bought an iPod Touch second hand. I tried to update it's firmware to the latest version using iTunes. The update failed and now I cannot access the iPod either directly or in iTunes. Turning the iPod ON the screen shows a 'connect to iTunes' looking icon and does nothing else. Connecting the USB does nothing and the iPod does not show up in the iTunes side bar. The iPod turns itself OFF after a minute or two. What now?\n\nA: You'll have to connect your iPod in recovery mode. Make sure the iPod is disconnected and turned OFF, so not on stand by, but completely off. \nThen, while pressing and holding the Home button, reconnect the USB cable to the device. The device should turn on with the \"Connect to iTunes\" screen. When this screen appears you can release the Home button; your iPod should now be in recovery mode. \n\nIf not already open, open iTunes. iTunes should then display a warning that it has detected an iPod in recovery mode and will ask you to restore it.\n\n\nA: Finally got it working - it was the cable!

This is running OSX Lion FYI.\nMy problem is that the machine sometimes seems to switch into Japanese input mode even when no one has touched the input mode switching keys. This is issue also happens on my wife's MacBook running OSX Snow Leopard and a friend's iBook running Leopard, all of these being Japanese model machines.\nDoes anyone know of a way to force the OS to ONLY switch the input language when someone actually chooses it from the actual pull down menu?\nPerhaps all three of us are hitting the input keys by mistake (i highly doubt that though). If that is the case then it is a design flaw.\nAny input (non-Japanese :) would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: \nCould it be that you are accidentally hitting the input source switching shortcuts? If so, you can disable them in the System Preferences.\nAlso, if you find that the input language changes when you switch apps, this is actually normal behavior. By choosing “Use the same one in all documents” in the input source options, you can greatly decrease the chances of this happening. (With the exception of a few apps that seem to ignore/override this setting. Very annoying.)\nIf you've experienced this problem only when using Japanese keyboards, then I guess there is a different cause. I use US keyboards, but this unintended switching happens to me too. Mostly when switching to Adobe apps.\n", "Q: Using Automator or AppleScript to encrypt/decrypt with OpenSSL I would like to know how to use Automator or AppleScript to create a droplet that would compress/uncompress (tar.gz) and encrypt/decrypt with OpenSSL files and/or directories dropped in it. The workflow on what the droplet will do to encrypt would be something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Files/directory is dropped on droplet\n\n*Files/directory is compressed\n\n*A password prompt is presented\n\n*OpenSSL is used to encrypt file, file is renamed to *.encrypted \n\n\nTo decrypt:\n\n\n*\n\n*File is dropped on droplet\n\n*If file is named *.encrypted, a password prompt is presented. If not, do encrypt workflow\n\n*File is decrypted, and renamed\n\n*Files is uncompressed\n\n\nAnyone?\n\nA: Actually, Automator is not a bad choice for this, as it allows you to combine AppleScript and shell scripting without actually having to mix them (which leads you straight to escaping hell, after a short stay in quoting purgatory) and pass values between them an orderly fashion. Also, besides a droplet application, Automator will allow you to create a Service with excellent integration into Finder:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new Automator workflow. \n\n\n*\n\n*either select “Application” when prompted what type of workflow to create – that will get you a droplet that processes files and folders you send to it, or\n\n*select “Folder action” and set “Accepts selected” to “files and folders” – that will get you an item in the Finder Services and context menu of files an folders (all translations approximate, I’m on a German system).\n\n\n*Add a \"Run AppleScript” action and edit its contents as follows:\non run {input, parameters}\n    try\n        tell application \"System Events\" to set thePassword to text returned of (display dialog \"Please input your password for OpenSSL encryption\" default answer \"\" with hidden answer)\n    on error errorMessage number errorNumber\n        if errorNumber is -128 then quit me -- user has canceled\n        error errorMessage number errorNumber\n    end try\n    return (thePassword as list) & input\nend run\n\n– this will prompt the user for the encryption password and pass it as the first argument to the next action.\n\n*Add a “Run Shell Script” action, setting it to get its input through arguments (not stdin, as is default). Make sure the shell is set to /bin/bash. Edit the script contents as follows:\n[[ -n $1 ]] && password=\"$1\" && shift || exit 0\nfor f in \"$@\"; do\n    if [[ ${f##*.} = \"encrypted\" ]]; then\n        fname=\"${f%.encrypted}\"\n        openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -salt -in \"$f\" -out \"$fname\".tar.gz -pass pass:$password || continue\n        tar -xPf \"$fname\".tar.gz && rm \"$fname\".tar.gz || continue\n    else\n        fname=$([[ -f $f ]] && printf \"${f%.*}\" || printf \"$f\")\n        tar -czPf \"$fname\".tar.gz \"$f\" || continue \n        openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in \"$fname\".tar.gz -out \"$fname\".encrypted  -pass pass:$password && rm -f \"$fname\".tar.gz || continue\n    fi\ndone\n\n– this will decrypt and untar-gzip .encrypted files, tar-gzip and encrypt all other files and directories with AES 256-CBC encryption and the password given.\nCaveat Empteor: error handling is primitive (basically, the for loop skips an iteration when it encounters an error), there is no logging and there is no failsafe against wrong password inputs (you might want to ask twice and compare the results, as the shell utility does). Disasters should not happen, though, as files are only deleted when the previous steps complete successfully.\nFinally, you might want to investigate alternatives to prompting for a password – a passphrase file on a USB key, say (use -pass file:/Volumes/volname/passfile instead of -pass pass:$password, skip the Applescript step and remove the first line of the shell script), or storing your password in the OS X keychain and retrieving it programmatically (see this answer of mine on Stack Exchange for ways to do that).\n\nA: I built an applescript droplet to compress & encrypt a folder.

I like iCloud, as I can just sync back and forth from a folder on different PCs.  It took me a few tries to get it configured ... I also rely on DropBox, Box.net, and now Google Drive and Skydrive ... Many, many gigs of synced storage online.

I have a separate wooden board on top of my desk that covers the desk's entire area.

I'm mostly thinking about possible damage to the hard drive or other components that are designed to work in a (more or less) perfectly horizontal position only.\n\nA: It shouldn't harm your mac in any way so. At my workplace my Macbook is tilted. The only problem I can foresee is that since it's a wood base and there's no holes it may cause the macbook to overheat ( this is the worst case scenario). My workplace has a titled setup that tilts the mac to keep it cool. Tilting your laptop is good because it prevents overheating and its better posture for your hands. \n\nA: Yes, as long as your MacBook Pro is steady (not moving constantly), it should work fine.  \nAll movable parts in your Mac (hard drive and superdrive) are well encapsulated in their cases and won't be able to move much.\nThe only problem I would think of is gravity (...) since it will somehow force your disks and hard drive to be in a flat position, but the case around those parts is very tight and won't allow the items to move.\nIf you work on a 15° angle, you won't suffer much from it.

It seems like that my Macbook prefers the AirPort for Internet, but doesn't recognize that my printer is no internet-connection. So the iPhone tethering is still on, but I don't have internet access...\nAnyone with a solution for this specific problem ?!\n\nA: You need to set the service order for the wifi to be below the USB tether.

Manually adding server with the ip address obtained by nslookup to /etc/hosts makes ping work too, but this \"solution\" circumvents the nameservers and is thus not ideal (and I would have to add about 20 other entries as well). Any idea what is causing this? Why does ping not use the results of nslookup/the searchdomains?\nssh server\n\nalso fails, which is the real problem/inconvenience.\nI already added AlwaysUseSearchDomains to mDNSResponder, but this fix only helps the problem when using server.foo.\nI'm using OS X Lion 10.7.3.\n\nA: Well, did you read the comments at the top of /etc/resolv.conf?\n# Mac OS X Notice\n#\n# This file is not used by the host name and address resolution\n# or the DNS query routing mechanisms used by most processes on\n# this Mac OS X system.\n\nThe correct solution is to add the search domains via the Network panel in System Preferences as described here.\n\nA: I had the same problem.  The solution I used was to create an /etc/resolver directory.  Inside that directory, create a file named for each domain you wish to resolve for.  Inside each file there should be two lines\nnameserver 10.0.100.2\ndomain  home.cainmanor.com\n\nThe file above would be named /etc/resolver/home.  It may need to be named home.cainmanor.com, but I can't test it right now.\nGood luck! \n\nA: I believe, the problem lies within the searchdomains configuration: ping/ssh are trying to use gethostbyname2() which fails because named is not running anymore (in Lion at least) and /etc/resolv.conf with the configured searchdomains is thus ignored. /etc/hosts is the last resort for gethostbyname2() and thus ssh works again with proper entries in /etc/hosts.

I disabled Wi-Fi and deleted all of my preferred networks.

It probably should have been the first thing I tried, but I'm a Linux guy and I look at console fixes first.\n", "Q: iOS Wifi Connections - Search Domains In iOS Wifi settings, each Wifi connection has a Search Domains section, usually blank.\nWhat is this used for?\n\nA: A Search Domain is simply a convenience that allows the system to convert host names to Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN).  Anyplace you might use a FQDN, such as in the location bar of Safari or as an argument to ssh, you can use a simple host name.  If the system can resolve that host name to an IP address (e.g. localhost -> 127.0.0.1) then it will use that.  If that doesn't work, then the system will try appending the search domain to the host name and try again. If you specified more than one search domain, it will try them each in order. \nIf you are typically connecting to other Mac's on your LAN, then setting the search domain to local will make it easier to use just the other computer's names everywhere.  If you are in a corporate environment and all your servers are available at name.example.com, then setting a search domain of example.com will allow you to access them by just using name.\nThose are the two most typical use cases.  When using a public Wi-Fi network, you should leave the Search Domain blank/empty to avoid accidentally connecting to some computer you didn't mean to connect to.  \n\nA: Primarily, I set the search domain to \".local\". Why? It makes activity on your local network (in your house or your office) the priority.\nFor instance, this fixed an issue in which iTunes and my iPhone and iPad were not syncing reliably over Wifi.\n\nA: A search domain is a way to adjust the domain when looking up an address. As in, assist in defining the actual domain name, only having to use part of it in a local network.\nFor example, in some networks, the Search Domain '.local' may be used to append to what a user puts into their URL bar in their browser, like a user can just type 'intranet', but it knows to complete this to 'intranet.local'. \nSome routers do something similar to help devices find each other on a local network. \nIn many cases, this is set by your network gear, similar to acquiring an IP address through DHCP. \n\nA: Same as in OS X when you look in the \"Network\" System Preference.\nLINK\n", "Q: When running a virtualized operating system on my Mac, is it important to have anti virus software? Just curious if it is important to have anti virus for a virtualized operating system I got to thinking, that operating system is actively connecting to the Internet, so I thought maybe it had vulnerabilities. \n\nA: If you are virtualizing a version of Windows, I would recommend you do use anti-virus software. Although Windows is running in a VM, it still is Windows and is vulnerable to viruses. A good choice of anti-virus software for Windows is Microsoft Security Essentials, which is free from Microsoft. (Note that: \"Your PC must run genuine Windows to install Microsoft Security Essentials.\")\nIf you are virtualizing a Linux distro, there is malware for Linux, so I would recommend anti-virus as well. There are several listed on the Linux malware Wikipedia page, including Avast! (Free) and AVG (Free).\n\nA: If you're running Windows in a VM and it has Internet access, then yes, you should consider running anti-malware software.\nVMs attempt to be as much like real computers as possible, so Windows in a VM is just as vulnerable as Windows running on real hardware.\n\nA: Although it is important to protect a VM from malware and exploits, it might not be quite as important for VMs where you can easily take a snapshot of a clean system and revert to that snapshot periodically (every day, every user logout, after every time going online, after browsing, etc.)  Also, the VM might be running on a system that has an active firewall and suspicious activity logging external to the VM (for example: Little Snitch on a Mac can warn you if a VM attempts to connect to some unexpected port number).\n\nA: Yes, you should run anti-virus software on a VM, and also on your Mac standalone. Macs are vulnerable to viruses, and Virtual Machines can posse a risk to your Mac because it is emulating a virtual environment. I've gotten my fair share of viruses running Crossover for Counter Strike. So if your going to use a VM I highly recommended using one! \nYou can never be to safe these days... \n", "Q: Open MS Office documents on Windows 7 guest VM in OS X host using Office for Mac I am running OS X Lion, VMware Fusion 4.1.2 which points to the Windows 7 installation created for Boot Camp.\nWhen I am in my Windows 7 VM, I want to double click on files (.pdf., word .docx, .pptx, etc) and have them open using my MS Office for Mac and other native files.  I think that this is doable but cannot figure out how.\nIn My VM settings, under Default Applications, I have the box checked to \"Open your Windows files and web links using Mac applications\". I do not have the \"Open your Mac files and web links using Windows applications\" checked, as I want everything to open natively in OS X, not Windows. There is a Configure button underneath the 2nd option that I listed and I have mailto and web pages mapped to OS X programs (Mail and Safari). If I try and add another to the Default Applications, there are options for News, RSS Feeds, File Transfers, and Remote sessions. How do I add custom mappings to default applications so that when I click on a .docx file in Windows 7 explorer (guest OS) it opens in word on OS X?\n\nA: Once you've checked the \"Open your Windows files and web links using Mac applications\", the following should work (providing the file resides in one of the folders shared from the Mac according to this VMware Fusion guide):\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on one of the file types you wish you open in the VM and click \"Open\" or \"Open With...\" if the program already has an associated application (if you selected \"Open\", in the window that appears, check the \"Select the program from a list of installed programs\" radio button and click OK).\n\n\n*In the window that appears there should be a VMware icon in the top-left that says \"Default Host Application\", select it and click OK. (You can also check the \"Always use the selected program to open this kind of file\" so that it opens with the host application next time too).\n\n\n*If the VMware icon is not in the top-left, you may have to drop down the list with the \"Other Programs\" heading and you should see it there instead.\n\nThe document in the VM should now open in the default application on the host. For example, a pdf should open with Preview and a docx with Word for Mac.\n", "Q: App to alert if Internet connection is lost Is there an app for the Mac that will alert me if my Internet connection is lost?\nSometimes I work from home and lose my connection without knowing it.\n\nA: The following script will alert you when your wireless network no longer has a connection. Though you could modify the script to require a check to locate a specific SSID, the following script simply looks for any wireless network connection. The script can be run via a Launch Daemon (login option preferred) or by simply running the script manually when you decide.\n\nAlert mechanism: \nIf you do not have a wireless network connection the script will set\n  your volume to be set at its maximum, you will then hear an alert\n  beep and the following phrase \"your wireless network has been\n  disconnected\".\n\nNOTE: This script contains an internal loop. The loop is designed to sleep for 2 min intervals so as not to constantly beep and verbalize said phrase. This interval can be modified to your liking by modifying the \"SLEEP_TIMER\" variable found within the script.\nALSO: If you are interested in setting up a Launch Daemon but do not have a lot of experience with Daemons, I recommend using Lingon (was once free but Lingon 3 is $2.99).\nTested on:\n\n\n*\n\n*10.5.x\n\n*10.6.x\n\n*10.7.4\nPlease remember to utilize a testing environment prior to running on your primary environment.

If it took such instructions literally, presumably you would need a magnifying glass to read the results (or more practically, to use the zoom function on every page).\nDoes the iPad web browser take this into account and multiply specified sizes by some reasonable conversion factor to end up with element sizes that work well on the high-resolution screen?\n\nA: According to Quirksmode, a \"pixel\" is \"essentially an abstract construct created specifically for us web developers\". In other words, yes - the iPad web browser, and other browsers (and other applications!) in the same situation handle this smoothly. You can read more about this in the QuirksBlog post.\n\nA: Consider that in portrait, the original iPad is only 768 pixels across. This is too narrow for many/most web page layouts. So instead, it renders the page as if it was 980 pixels across. Then it downsizes that to fit the actual screen pixel, shrinking graphics. It also fiddles with the text so that it is clear, rendering it directly (instead of rasterizing and then shrinking, which would make it fuzzy).\nWith a Retina display, it still acts as if it is 980 across, but now it upsizes everything. Text is now very sharp. With image elements, if the graphic actually has more resolution than the declared size, it will be shown at the best possible resolution. (For example, the element is IMG WIDTH=\"980\", but that particular graphic is 1536 pixels across. It's a \"full-width\" graphic, so you'd see every pixel one-for-one, even though it's \"only\" 980 pixels in size.)\n\nA: It can be problematic, but Safari does attempt to scale the page ... Think of when you double tap a block of text, and you are \"zoomed in\" to larger text.  Still, things can render in crazy ways.  It helps a lot to think about the viewport size rather than screen resolution ... And viewport/alignment/scale relationships.  Of particular value in controlling the experience is setting the viewport meta tag in page headers thoughtfully.\nGood question -- with iPad ownership exploding (19% of US households a few months back, and total purchased going into the hundreds of millions, tablet rendering can't be ignored.  It isn't enough to detect the browser agent and forward people to the \"mobile\" site that is optimized for smartphones.\n", "Q: Wifi preferences whenever my computer (which is a MacBook Pro bought in 2012) is sleeping or off, and i login with my password, it is always on a different wifi then my home wifi.

I find that iTunes management of backing up Apps isn't ideal for a number of reasons.  It will happily keep a copy of the most recent App in it's own area within the iTunes library, but it's archival process is very much against your \"current\" applications, without necessarily keeping a history of previous versions.\nThere are various reasons for keeping previous versions of an App, from being able to simply revert when a new version is buggy or makes changes which you do not wish to use, to the App changing it's minimum requirements to need hardware which you just down own therefore making the App unusable.\nMy current manner of archiving old iOS applications is both manual and therefore dysfunctional. \nCurrently I move copies by hand to a folder named \"old iOS applications\". I also depend on Time Machine to provide historical copies of apps for the rare case when an update to an app causes me to have a problem with functionality of an app. I prefer to keep iTunes only managing apps that are actively installed by deleting things I don't use regularly and letting the next iOS sync transfer back just the apps that are currently in use. The downside of a lean iTunes library is that finding an old app is hit or miss - needing to recall when it was saved to Time Machine. This hesitation also acts as a deterrent to keeping iTunes lean since I don't have a good process for archiving these programs.\nWhat are people doing to have all copies of iOS apps organized without depending on Time Machine exclusively? I'm looking for an automated process for archiving apps delivered from the iOS app store. \n\nA: Indeed, iTunes will simply throw in the Trash any item that is replaced by a subsequent update, which is a handy getout clause if you notice that you need the old version back quickly, before you empty it, but isn't exactly a robust solution with long term options.\nUsing Time Machine is a simple way of checking back through your history, and should be very effective on the understanding that you are using it regularly and to the normal hourly schedule, but may people don't have it setup, or use an external disk that is often not connected for long periods of time (guilty as charged).\nSo, they key is to get ahead of iTunes, and create your own archive of Apps, and you can break this down into 2 simple steps, the first being noticing when an app has changed, the 2nd being to do something about it.\nYou can happily write a script that you schedule to check for changes to select files and folders, but this is inefficient when you can simply use built in OS features such as Folder Actions, which are a much neglected yet insanely useful and powerful set of tools.\nA folder action is simply an action that is executed automatically whenever certain things happen within the folder to which is is applied.  When the folder is opened, closed, or modified (and modifications include files being added, removed, or altered), the folder action script activates automatically.\nThe script that you apply to a folder action can be anything you like, and the simplest way is to create something within Automator, which allows you to string together various application specific functions with bits of AppleScript or even Shell scripts to achieve the end result, in our case taking a copy of updated apps and archiving them off.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*So, to start off, let's start Automator, and choose Folder Action as your document type.\n\n*On the left hand side is a column (may require expanding, under Library) of collections of actions, choose Files and Folders, and in the list that appears under the adjacent column, drag the following two items into the space in the right of the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy Finder Items\n\n*Rename Finder Items\n\n\n*Next, either create (or locate) a backup folder where you wish to store you backups, and in the Copy Finder Actions tasks, either browse to this location or simply drag it on top of the folder name to make it choose it.\n\n*The 2nd task, Rename Finder Items will likely be called \"Add Date or Time\" instead, which is odd, until you realise that this is simply the first method of renaming that is offers.  Change the selection to read \"Make Sequential\", the default options should be self explanatory, adding a number to each file that is renamed, starting with -1.ipa etc.  (note that the file renaming takes place before the file extension, so you will get file-1.txt, not file.txt-1)\n\n*Now, above your two tasks, you have likely spotted the option to choose the folder to which the action is applied.  Browse away and locate your mobile Apps folder in here, it's likely to be something in ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media somewhere, exact location dependant on the age of your iTunes library, current iTunes version, and dependant on how you let iTunes organise your folders, for me it was Mobile Applications in the above folder.  You are essentially looking for a folder stuffed full of files ending in .ipa.\n\n*Your Automator should now look something like this:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Now you can save your action, I called mine \"Itunes App Backups\", don't worry where it saves the file to (which is actually ~/Library/Workflows/Applications/Folder Actions/)\n\n*You now have the action you just created, applied against the folder you chose.  You can prove this, just right click on any folder and click \"Folder Actions Setup\", from here you can pick a pre-existing action and assign it to a folder without having to recreate the whole thing just by choosing to add from the list of known actions you are presented with; note that your new action is listed in the options provided, but hit cancel for now.  You will see a list of folders which have actions assigned against them.  Select your Mobile Applications Folder, and there you see the following:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*That's it.  Because iTunes removes and replaces applications with upgrades, then each new file has a copy taken at the time it is added, meaning that it doesn't matter when it subsequently get's removed.  Note that sometimes Apps include version information in the file names, sometimes they change names completely (Read It Later becoming Pocket, for example), and sometimes they use the same name exactly (which is where the renaming with sequential numbering comes in for added safety)\n\n\nNote, that you can amend or expand this workflow to do all sorts of clever things, from keeping a set number of versions, removing any files older than X months at the same time etc etc, and if named sensibly you can apply the same workflow to multiple folders, thus creating your own personalised archiving mechanism for things other than just Apps for example. Also, note that if you subsequently replace an upgraded app with one of your own backups, it will get backed up again, which is something you might like to be aware of for such files that retain the same filename and are only distinguishable by their timestamps.\n\nNote that a lot of the ideas in the post were inspired by a Macworld\n  Article, which introduces the same process but in less detail\n\n", "Q: Remote Bonjour Connection I currently use a code editor called Coda.\nIt uses Bonjour to offer collaborative code editing over a local network.\nI am going to be travelling for the next two months and need to occasionally screen share with a colleague.

I have installed HardwareGrowler, which displays a notification every time something is being mounted/ejected, connected/disconnected, etc.\nIt tells me that at the start of when Software Update the Recovery HD is mounted and after something like 5 seconds it is ejected.\nIs this because it needs to check the version of your Recovery HD, or is it used for something else?\n\nA: Software Update checks and updates both your running Lion and your recovery partition, so that in the event of a significant security issue booting to the recovery partition won't instantly open you up to attack.  (Compare booting unpatched Windows XP from DVD or a vendor recovery partition for recovery purposes; it has severe security issues fixed by service packs.

If you really need to run it at boot instead of when you log in, that is a lot more involved.

Or is there specific RAM made for Macs?\n\nA: I upgraded the memory in my Early 2011 MacBook Pro from 4 GB (2x2) to 8 Gb (2x4) using the Crucial site, and haven't had any problems at all.\nFor the record, I also did the same with a brand new iMac, swapping out both memory modules with 2x4 GB from Crucial. \nIt worked out to be about 1/3 of the price that Apple charges for the same memory.\n\nA: Any brand of RAM will work, so long as it matches the specs the computer is expecting. (That would be the \"DDR3 1333 MHz\" part.)\nFor the most part, Apple uses standard PC hardware, so there's no more restrictions on what types of parts will work than there would be on a non-Mac.\n\nA: If you aren't sure just use crucial.com's system analyzer.

Optionally, set “in” drop down to “Finder”.\n\n*Add a “Get Selected Finder Items” action.\n\n*Add a “Move Finder Items” actions below that and set it to your target folder.\n\n*Save your service in the default location (~/Library/Services) as “Archive”.\n\n\nyou now have a new service menu and context menu entry (depending on the number of services active: either on the first menu level, or in the “Services” submenu) called “Archive” that will move the selected file or folder to your target folder.\n\n*How to automate HFS+ compression of files added to your target folder: there are several ways to achieve that. You could, of course, simply add that step to your archiving service. The disadvantage of this approach is that no compression will be applied if files or folders are ever added to the folder outside the service, of course. A better approach would be to have everything in the folder be compressed automatically, without reliance on the the entry vector or user interaction.  \nOne way is, as you have discovered, to have a compression utility run every time a file or folder is added to your watched folder:\n\n\n*\n\n*the way to launch a shell utility in AppleScript is the do shell script command – see the linked documentation;\n\n*the inbuilt way to leverage filesystem events in an AppleScript is to use Folder Actions, which call AppleScripts on changes in a watched folder. What events the script reacts to are defined by the script itself, through the handlers it provides (for instance, the script in Mark’s answer has a handler for adding folder items – meaning it reacts to newly added files; see the Applescript Language Guide for the full reference). Folder Actions configuration is found in the services menu of folders in Finder (in the context menu, too).\n\n*a turbocharged alternative to Folder Actions is Paul Kim’s Hazel (commercial software), which adds rule based processing and a plethora of criteria for filesystem event handling that go far beyond what you can achieve with simple Folder Actions – you might want to investigate Hazel if you plan on doing more or more complex stuff along the lines of what you are planning now.\n\n\nAn alternative to the whole scripting approach is using LateNiteSoft’s Clusters – another commercial software, that does nothing but automatically apply (and re-apply, where needed) HFS+ compression to the contents of watched folders.\n\nA: @williamvoor: The script fails with filepaths which contain spaces, as set the file_name to the POSIX path of this_item does not escape properly. Correct the appropriate line of your code to this:\nset cmd to \"/Users/sn/bin/bin/afsctool -c \\\"\" & file_name & \"\\\"\"\n\nExplanation: afcstool's file_name argument is surrounded with quotation marks, which themselves in the AppleScript code are escaped in order to be correctly handed over to the command line environment.\nMeta-topic: As I lack reputation points, I could not comment at the appropriate position (= to @williamvoor 's own post), therefore I post it as an own answer, and ask you to edit the code change into your post, and give me a thumbs up, so that I gain enough reputation, enabling me to directly comment in the future.

The thing is that it doesn't ring when someone calls me but it play the sounds on some games or when I try to change the ringtones in Settings->Sounds menu. All the ringtones are the default ones. \n\nA: Is your ringer switch stuck on mute? If not this could be a simple software issue, you would have to save all your data through iTunes, save all of your pictures separately, and restore the iPhone to factory settings. Once restored you must choose to set the iPhone up as new, otherwise restoring from a corrupted backup will bring the issue back. You can make sure to save contacts & calendar events on 4.2.1 by going into the info tab while the iPhone is plugged into iTunes, and selecting sync contacts, & sync calendars, notes, bookmarks, ect. \nIf you did drop it too many times & break the ringer switch, it's about time for a new phone\n", "Q: It's May.

It's a small app in your menubar and gets the job done.\n\nA: Changes Meter is an app that just notify you about some change in web page.

I don't want to sync whole folders. \nIs it possible to \"sync\" single selected photos without deleting all the others? Granted, \"sync\" is the probably the wrong word here. \nI know I can send them via email to my iPhone, but assuming that I have no internet, what else can I do?\n\nA: Its difficult to give the best answer without knowing which photo manager you use and how often you'd to transfer a photo. For rare transfers, email and Dropbox are good solutions. \nFor a more sophisticated approach, I use a smart album in Aperture together with a keyword called \"Sync.\" Now whenever I add the Sync keyword to a photo on my Mac, it is automatically added to the Sync album, which is set (in iTunes) to sync with my iPad. \n\nA: Photo syncing on the iPhone is kind of lame.  Apple wants you to commit 100% to iPhoto or Aperture and if you don't then you don't get much support.\nProbably easiest is to create a separate folder just for photos you want to put on your iPhone and then sync photos from that folder.  You can put aliases in the folder so you don't have to move/copy the photos from wherever it is you want to keep them. \n\nA: You can accomplish this best just like Ash had suggested, although another route If you are using iPhoto or Aperture is to make Albums & add any photo from any event/project into the album(s) you want manually. You can also try creating one album called \"iPhone Pictures\", and then either drag and drop the pictures you want to put onto the iPhone into that album, or use the +to button in the toolbar. Then sync that selected album through the photos tab in iTunes while the iPhone is plugged in. :-)\n", "Q: How do I find a list of available printers on a specific print server?

Though there is no shortage of journal and note taking apps I have yet to find one that specifically mentions that the user content is encrypted while on the device. Does iOS provide APIs to allow for AES or similar encryption (Blowfish etc ...)? Is it difficult to encrypt user data within an iOS application? \nJust to clarify ... I am not talking about simple password protection but rather encryption of the user data such that if the iOS device were compromised the user data would be unreadable. \n\nA: 1Password.  Not strictly a note taking application, but it does have secure notes built into it.  You're not going to find markdown support, but you get a place to type text.

I have several MPEG files (technically \"MPEG 2\" I believe).\nI want to do some very simple editing, mostly deleting a few frames here or there.\nI do not want to have to re-encode or transcode the video, or do anything else which would decrease the quality of the source.\nThe only software that I am aware of which does this sort of editing is MPEG_Streamclip, but surely there must be others.\n\nA: MPEG-2 is subject to license restrictions and royalty payments, so you won't find much in the line of free software to edit MPEG-2 videos.\nYou can do this sort of editing in QuickTime player with QuickTime Pro, but be aware that MPEG-2 for DVDs uses a complicated compression scheme using key frames and \"difference\" frames that repeat in a regular pattern (Group of Pictures a.k.a GOP).  You cannot just edit out one frame without re-encoding the rest if you want to play it in a DVD player.  \n", "Q: In the iOS 5 Music App, some songs have a circle with small square beside them I would like to know how to remove the songs with this shape next to their title because they seem to mess up the song play.

I am playing a game that's called Bookworm on the Mac, and it runs in full screen mode.\nIf I press ⇧ shift+⌘ cmd+4 to capture part of the screen, it won't work.  Usually, I can press space and click to capture the whole window, but that doesn't work, either.\n⇧ shift+⌘ cmd+3 works to capture the whole screen, but I'd like to find out how to take a partial screenshot.\n\nA: Just use commandshift4 as usual. It just won't display its color overlay for the selection frame. The crosshair cursor should still show up and the screenshot should still be of the selected area.\n\nA: Check SnappyApp - is a very useful tool for screenshots for Mac OS, more powerful than the system screen capture functionality and it's free.\n", "Q: Is there a way to force a game running in full screen to become a window? I am playing a game called Bookworm on the Mac, and it starts as a full screen game, and the only way seems to be from its Options to choose not to run in full screen.  What if a game doesn't provide such option, is there a way to make it become a window?  (force the game to run in window mode instead of full screen).\n\nA: Yes and No.  The game has to support the ability to run in windowed mode.  If it doesn't support it, then it will not be able to do it.\nNow, when it comes to games that don't have the option in an preference menu, they can sometimes still support the feature, they just don't advertise it.\nThere are a few games that require you to edit a preference file to enable/disable certain things. Usually contained inside the game icon, right clicking on the game icon and hitting \"Show Package Contents\" will open the game's directory and show you the files that make the game.  Be very careful when doing this because editing the wrong thing can break the game.  Usually if this option exists then it will be somewhere on the internet and you will be able to find out more about it by doing a search for that game.\nOne such game that supports this is Cave Story+, editing the preference file can enable certain game modes and unlock features.\nOther games will work with a shortcut when running, usually:\n\n*\n\n*opt/alt + enter\n\n*opt/alt + f\n\n*cmd + f\n\n*cmd + opt + f\n\n*cmd + opt + enter\n\n*cmd + enter\n\nNow, if none of these are viable options, then you won't be able to do it.\n", "Q: Google Chrome confirm close Many a time and oft I get confused between close tab (⌘+w) and close (⌘+q) in Google Chrome, closing dozens of tabs at once.\nHow do I specify a close prompt before closing multiple tabs on Chrome (version 18.0.1025.168)? \nI have tried chrome://flags/, and the wrench menues but found no such option.\n\nA: Enabling \"Warn Before Quitting\" should prevent that from happening. You can find that option in the Chrome menu in the menubar.\nWhen enabled, you need to hold down ⌘+Q for a bit before it actually quits.\n\n\nA: That is not currently possible but you could do cmd+shift+T a number of times, until you have all your taps restored.\n", "Q: Find out if my iPhone is unlocked without purchasing another SIM Is it possible to determine if my phone is unlocked without buying another SIM card?\nI don't know where it was originally purchased or what the original terms of the phone service were.\nAll my relatives are on the same network, so it doesn't help to borrow their SIM.\n\nA: Three methods work for deteriming if an iPhone is unlocked:\n\n\n*\n\n*You see the one time message from iTunes when it restores a phone that previously was locked and now is unlocked.\n\n*You contact your carrier and they will tell you if the phone on your account has been unlocked.\n\n*You swap the SIM with one that isn't from your carrier and it works.\n\n\nApple maintains a nice article explaining which carriers offer an unlock as well as other iPhone related services. If you didn't buy the phone yourself, it could have been sold originally as an unlocked phone in which case you would need to know this fact or experiment with two SIM to know if that device is in fact one that is authorized as an unlocked device.\n\nA: Registering a free account at http://www.imei.info/ and entering your IMEI number for your iPhone and doing a free simlock check works for me:\n\n\nA: There is a thread on Macrumors which suggests that connecting the iPhone to iTunes on your computer will display a message stating \"This iPhone has been unlocked.\" I can't confirm that it's true, and the conversation in that thread does state some exceptions, but perhaps it will get you started. \n", "Q: Google Chrome - Flash on Youtube issue Here is the information about Flash plug-in in Google Chrome:\nFlash - Version: 11.2.202.235\nShockwave Flash 11.2 r202\n\nIt's able to load & stream videos on YouTube but the problem is, after about 10 seconds, the videos paused unexpectedly, even when it was buffered a lot more.

You could test the same YouTube videos in other browsers, as Chrome contains its own Flash rather than use the /Library plug-in version, but every YT video I've played on a Mac has always had that buffering pause a few seconds into it.  (Vimeo is usually smooth.)\nThere have been some sorta-hacks to set Mac browsers to use HTML5 instead of Flash, however: you might start with Jon Gruber's always-excellent blog though that may be somewhat outdated.\n\nA: You should try click 2 flash, a free extension for safari that puts a grey box in place of flash elements which aren't run until you left click them.

I use my iPad a lot as I teach, showing the students slides, videos, etc.\nHaving a words with friends, draw something, or email notification, especially with personal content in the first line, show up is always distracting.\nI see that I can change notification settings per-app, but don't see  a way to disable all notifications system wide. Disabling apps individually works, but requires a bit of effort and time, and isn't something that can be done mid-lesson.\nIs there a way to disable all notifications from appearing while you are actively using the device (e.g. while having your device mirrored on a screen during a lesson, presentation, demonstration, etc.), then re-enable all previously allowed notifications without fiddling with each one individually?\n\nA: If you don't need a internet connection during the lesson a simple solution would be to just switch into airplane mode or to disable the Wi-Fi.\n\nA: (Since the accepted answer for this question is outdated and the actual answer is buried as a comment, I’m providing a better answer for all future people with this question, in hopes that it will become more visible.)\nThe default behavior for the Do Not Disturb feature is stopping notifications while the screen is locked, so that your iPad/iPhone won’t keep buzzing in your pocket/backpack/desk while you’re trying to concentrate on something else. \nThat’s good, but not what we want. We want to stop notifications while we’re using the device. \nWell, at least since iOS 12 there’s an additional setting within Settings > Do Not Disturb that you can turn on, here:\n\nAll you need to do is change the “Silence” option to “Always” in this screen. It will keep any and all notifications away from your screen as you write, read, present content to others, play a game, etc. \n\nA: The latest iOS - iOS 15.0.02 has a new feature called Focus, which allows you to set up different states that allows for notifications from different people  and/or apps - and you can select who and what is allowed through.\nIt allows for the following:\n\n*\n\n*Set Focus State and tell people you are silencing notifications (and allow them the option to notify you anyways).\n\n*Hide notification badges on home screen, as well as select custom home pages (so cool!)\n\n*Dim the lock screen\n\n*Show notifications on lock screen\n\n*Schedule these focus states.\n\nYou can create your own custom states as well.\nBy hiding notifications from all people and apps, and disabling focus state, you can hide all notifications.\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, I don't think there's any way to disable all notifications at once in iOS 5.\nThere is no global toggle switch (like there was in iOS 4).\nHopefully Apple will change this in the future!\nAll I can suggest is that you send Apple feedback.\n\nA: After years, Apple provided a way of achieving this.\nIt is called the \"Do Not Disturb\" feature, available since iOS 10.\nref: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204321\nUpdate per @Pascal's comment as there's a lot of confusion about this online:\nUnder Settings -> Do Not Disturb, you can select to 'Always' disable notifications when in Do Not Disturb mode, not just while locked.\n\nA: As of iOS 11, there is no way to temporarily disable all notifications while actively using the device (i.e. in \"presentation mode\").\nThere have been some Notification Center improvements announced for iOS 12, including Group Notifications and Instant Tuning (allowing you to swipe left on a notification and set it to \"Deliver Quietly\"), and some features that allow for timed Do-Not-Disturb.  However, it is unknown at the moment if the temporary nature of the notification-disable can be applied to non-lock-screen notifications.\nDo-Not-Disturb mode still appears to only affect lock-screen notifications, and not banner notifications (per your original scenario, which is what I'm searching for as well).\nUntil Apple addresses this in a future iOS update, one potential iOS 12 work-around that's not perfect but definitely an improvement would be to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have all your notifications set to be grouped\n\n*In notification center, select your most-used apps (which are probably at the top) and swipe left to \"Manage\" the app's notifications\n\n*Select \"Deliver Silently\"\n\n*After your lesson/presentation, go back into notification center, select those notification groups again, swipe left, Manage, and select \"Deliver Prominently\"\n\n\nAgain, not perfect, but at least easy to do for the 3-4 apps that you know are the worst offenders during your presentations.\nMore info: MacRumors - All of the Changes to Notifications in iOS 12\n", "Q: Home share between iPhone and Macbook not working My home share between my iPhone and Macbook is not working. My macbook music will show up on my iPhone but it doesn't work the other way around. Someone please help! I've tried basically everything.\n\nA: Home Sharing does not work in that direction, meaning you can only share music stored on your Mac but not music stored on an iOS device.\n\nThe only way to view your iPhone music library on a computer is to connect it with iTunes and view it. This can be done in either of two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug the iPhone into your MacBook with a dock connector USB cable. Open iTunes and find the appropriate item in the sidebar under Devices.\n\n*Plug in the iPhone and set up iTunes Wi-Fi Sync: Select the iPhone in iTunes, and under Options you should see something that says \"Sync with this iPhone over Wi-Fi.\" Tick that option and apply settings.

On Windows and Ubuntu I can use ⌘+1 to start the first app in the Dock, ⌘+2 to start the second app in the Dock, etc. How can I achieve same effect in OS X? Is it some built-in functionality or third-party extension?\n\nA: You could save scripts like this somewhere in AppleScript Editor and give them shortcuts with for example Alfred or FastScripts.\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Dock\"\n    perform action \"AXPress\" of UI element 5 of list 1\nend tell\n\n(Just assigning fixed shortcuts for each application would probably be a better option though.)\n\nA: Seems that alternative is \"expose\". I can arrange items here so app became selected by only entering first letter of it's name. So switching to \"mail\" is as fast as clicking \"f4\", then \"m\" and then \"enter\". It's a bit more keys compared to \"win-4\", but much more flexible.\n\nA: You might try some of the launcher apps like Quicksilver (my personal choice) or Alfred as both will allow you to specify a hotkey for an application, script, etc.\n\nA: Not so fast as special hotkeys you ask for, but a little bit more flexible and build in:\nYou can use CTRL+F3 to select the first dock icon (or last used) and then switch per left and right between your dock icons.

Each time I boot it up, however, Terminal and Chrome start once I hit the desktop, no matter what programs I had open when I last shut it down.\nAt first I was worried it was booting to the same state again and again, but new files I create are still present on the system if I shut the computer down and start it up again.\nIs there any way I can stop my computer from booting up the same two programs as though nothing has changed since the clone to the new drive?\n\nA: Please see Matt Ball and my comments for the answer. The problem was:\nA HTML file had somehow found its way onto the list of login items, and it was loading via Chrome, and presumably booting the Terminal window as well. After removing this file from that list, the problem has, as far as I can tell, vanished.\n", "Q: iPad app where possible draw, save for reuse and drop 'objects' on canvas for prototyping and to make mockup For prototyping / mockup needs, I want an iPad app where it's possible to draw, save and drop 'templates' on a canvas.\nSomething similar to balsamiq mockups, where there is a collection of components that can be placed on canvas, but with the ability to create my own components by drawing and saving for later reuse.\n\nA: The best app that comes to mind is Sketchbook Pro for the iPad. It's like a simplified version of Photoshop where it has brushes and a lot of features that are at the mercy of your fingertips.

Even seemingly innocuous actions may call Finder to wake and read the drive, such as opening a file browsing dialogue in another application.\nYou may try removing from the Sidebar of Finder any folders on that drive. Also go into Finder's preferences, go to the 'Sidebar' tab, and uncheck either 'Hard Disks' or 'External Disks' under Devices, depending on whatever drive this is. That might prevent Finder from calling the drive.\n\nBarring that, you may try try checking off Put hard disk(s) to sleep when possible in the Energy Saver's preference pane, which will keep the drive awake perpetually, and avoid pauses while it wakes.\n \nYou may also want to run ps -ef to check and see if there are any background processes that may be indexing or calling the drive.\n", "Q: Syncing between devices and macs problem Is there a way to sync between macs and iDevices in a way you specify which device has the most recent data? I mean, suppose I make some modifications to a contact using my Mac or I buy some apps for my iPhone using iTunes on the Mac. When I sync the iphone, the sync is always made as the iPhone is the priority. So, the app will not be transferred to the iPhone and not even the change on that contact. Some times I want the reverse to occur.\nHow do I manage those situations?\n\nA: The way your question is worded is a bit funny but it sounds like the \"Replace information on this iPhone\" might be what you are looking for. You can find it in the Info tab of the iTunes sync window and what it does is it basically wipes what data there is on the iPhone (ot other iOS device) and replaces it with what is on the computer.\n", "Q: How do I add keywords to iPhoto images using Automator I have an Automator service that adds selected photos to iPhoto. I would like it to also add a specific keyword to these photos.\nHow can I do this?\nI found this question, but the only answer does not set the keywords via automator.\n\nA: If you are using the “Import to iPhoto” Automator action, that returns a list of iPhoto photos you can process. Just add an “Applescript” action after your import action with the following script:\ntell application \"iPhoto\"\n    repeat with importedPhoto in (input as list)\n        select importedPhoto\n        assign keyword string \"your keyword\"\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n– that should do the trick.\n", "Q: Installing Homebrew: .git already exists I should mention that I have no idea what I am doing :) So, sorry if this is confusing. \nI am trying to install Homebrew with this command \n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(/usr/bin/curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/master/Library/Contributions/install_homebrew.rb)\"\n\nusing the directions here https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation\nAfter installing i ran brew doctoras it said to, I got these errors:\n    Error: /usr/local/include isn't writable.\nThis can happen if you \"sudo make install\" software that isn't managed\nby Homebrew.\n\nIf a brew tries to write a header file to this directory, the install will\nfail during the link step.\n\nYou should probably `chown` /usr/local/include\nError: /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig isn't writable.\nThis can happen if you \"sudo make install\" software that isn't managed\nby Homebrew.\n\nIf a brew tries to write a .pc file to this directory, the install will\nfail during the link step.\n\nYou should probably `chown` /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig\nError: /usr/local/share isn't writable.\nThis can happen if you \"sudo make install\" software that isn't managed\nby Homebrew.\n\nIf a brew tries to write a file to this directory, the install will\nfail during the link step.\n\nYou should probably `chown` /usr/local/share\nError: Some directories in /usr/local/share/man aren't writable.\nThis can happen if you \"sudo make install\" software that isn't managed\nby Homebrew.

Matrox Dualhead2go makes it possible to have 2 external screens for a Macbook Pro. It performs that by splitting a very large screen in two smaller screens.\nI am very worried as to how will the applications behave with that:\n\n\n*\n\n*will the dock be displayed in the center? (i.e. between the 2 screens)\n\n*will all modal dialogs be centered also?\n\n*Are Expose and Spaces working good? Isn't their display broken?\n\n*Is watching a video full screen on one display possible? (VLC, youtube, DVD...)\n\n*Will fullscreen apps work? (aperture for example)\n\n*Is that possible to maximize a window on one display easily?\n\n\nNote: I have tested an external USB graphic card as an alternative solution, it is way to laggy to be used IMO.\n\nA: I have this product.  All your concerns are valid.  Modal dialogs and prompts are split by the program's bezel.  The dock can be positioned across only one monitor, but that is the only configuration option.  Fullscreen video on one monitor is not possible.  Fullscreen apps span both screens, which doesn't work well. Calendar is OK.  Mail is impossible, especially when composing a message.  It is easy to maximize to just one window using built in hotkeys.  However \"true\" fullscreen is usually complicated by monitor bezels.\n", "Q: Why can't this process terminate? \nJust recently I ran into an issue where my network program couldn't bind to a port because it was already in use. I opened the activity monitor and realized it (named \"server\") was already running from previously, even though I had closed the window and it was supposedly terminated. Quit or Force Quit on the process do nothing. I even restarted the computer but it was still there! This hasn't happened with my program before. I even typed in the terminal kill 4517 and nothing happened. Help?\n\nA: OS X uses a process launching system called launchd which consolidates functions provided by Init scripts, crontab and more in *nix systems (see the Wikipedia article for a high level overview, and Apple’s Developer docs on launch daemons and agents for details). One of the abilities of launchd is to keep a process it launched alive, if so defined by its configuration file – in that case, the process will relaunch whenever it is terminated. Your problem with a process apparently persisting across reboots and manual termination sounds very much like a case of launchd initiated process with a keepAlive key.\nlaunchd configuration files are in plist format and found in\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/LaunchAgents – agents for the current  user account only\n\n*/Library/LaunchAgents and /Library/LaunchDaemons – agents and daemons for all user accounts\n\n*/System/Library/LaunchAgents and /System/Library/LaunchDaemons – system level agents and daemons\n\n\nand are usually named in reverse domain notation (tld.domain.process.plist). Depending if the user account of server is yours or not (can’t say, as you have blanked it), you should look in one of the first two locations above for a likely plist (if you have Xcode installed, you can QuickLook them easily). If found, your server is indeed controlled by launchd. The correct procedure to stop it is to remove it from launchd’s process list through\nlaunchctl unload <tld.domain.process>\n\nwhich will unload and stop the process (note you omit the plist suffix).\nThere is also a GUI for handling launchd files, Peter Borg’s Lingon (make sure to get “Lingon”, not “Lingon 3”, which is a dumbed down version safe for vanilla use), which might be more convenient than manually rooting through the file locations.\n\nA: Give this a try.\n    sudo kill -9 4517\n\nWhere 4517 is the PID of the process. \nIf the process comes back with a new PID, something relaunched it.  See kopischke's answer for how to deal with that.\n", "Q: Nook Comics on iPad? I'm considering buying an iPad to read comics, so I am looking in to my options for purchasing digital comics.  I see Barnes and Noble sells \"Nook Comics\", and their site indicates these can be read on the color Nook tablets and the Nook app for Android.\nSeems odd that they'd support reading the comics on the Nook app only for Android, not under iOS as well.  I was hoping someone who uses the Nook ecosystem and has an iPad could clarify if this is an oversight, or accurate.  Does the iPad Nook app really not support Nook Comics?\n\nA: The newest release of NOOK for iPad and iPhone now supports comics and manga.\n\nA: You probably need to convert from the Nook format (which I believe is special for the Nook) to one which is more general purpose. The first obstacle is, what exactly is the format they come in?\nThe chances are very good that you can find something to convert it to PDF, for free.\nOnce it is in PDF or CBZ or CBR or some more common format, there are lots of comic readers for iPad - my favourite is Comic Zeal but iBooks works pretty well too for PDF.\n", "Q: Grab list of Stats, Application Data, and Serials off OSX 10.6 to prepare for reformat and fresh install? I need to reformat my 2007 OSX as it is now returning kernal errors. I want to install everything fresh but I have a lot of software and don't want to sit here making a list of everything installed as it is all unorganized.\nFor windows I usually accomplish this with Belarc Advisor: http://download.cnet.com/Belarc-Advisor/3000-2094_4-10007277.html?tag=mncol;1\nIs there something similar, whether a method or an app that will allow me to do this on a mac?\n\nA: Most of what you need (i.e. hardware, network information, software etc. thats similar to what Belarc Advisor returns) can be obtained using the built-in System Profiler application (/Applications/Utilities/System Profiler.app). \nYou can then export the information to a file using File ➔ Save As.., then select either \"Plain Text\" or \"Rich Text Format\" from the \"File Format\" dropdown.\nThe above can get quite verbose, so if you just want a quick snapshot of installed apps (including those installed by default, of course), you could start the Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) then type\nls /Applications \nor \nls /Applications > ~/Documents/apps.txt to send the output to the file apps.txt in your Documents folder.\n", "Q: Why are home folders in Mac OS X located in /Users, and not /home? My question is as title stated.\nWhy mac osx user directory located at /Users, but not /home?\nBecause /home is the default directory of user's home of Unix and Linux.\n\nA: While we can only guess on Apple's motivations for certain decisions, the most obvious explanation would be that a \"Users\" folder has existed since Mac OS 9, before it was a Unix system, and Apple chose to stick with something familiar to their users. The same goes for other already familiar folders like \"Applications\".\nThis effectively translates in two different parts of the filesystem, where the not-so-user-friendly Unix hierarchy is hidden from the GUI, and a more friendly folder hierarchy is added on top of that and is exposed in the GUI.\nThere also is a clear difference in the style of directory names between the visible and invisible part. The invisible part uses all lowercase words as per convention in *nix filesystems, while the exposed part of the filesystem will uppercase the first letter of each word in a folder name.\n\nA: No /home/ is the default on Linux but this is not a standard.\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory#Default_Home_Directory_per_Operating_System for a list of default home directories.\n\nA: /Users originated in NeXTSTEP/OpenStep, the ancestor of Mac OS X. /home is really just a Unix tradition and in no way necessary. You don't even need to have all home directories in the same containing directory. If you used Unix when HDDs were much smaller you might have seen something like /u0/user1, /u0/user2, /u1/user3….\n", "Q: lock account and sleep Is there an easy way to lock my mac and then immediately sleep, all in one command? I know I can show the login window and then choose the sleep button, but I'd prefer one step rather than two (and a wait in between). There's also the Lock Screen command in the Keychain menu, but that (stupidly) offers no sleep button that I can see. Could a script work for this, or would the script also get stuck after one command?\nUpdate: Forgot to mention that I don't want to always have to enter my password after waking up from sleep, only after I explicitly lock the computer.\n\nA: ⌥ + ⌘ + ⏏ will put the computer to sleep. Then, if you have \"Require password [immediately] after sleep or screen saver begins\" checked under System Preferences ➔ Security ➔ General, it will prompt you for a password when it wakes up.\n\nA: Actually, a script containing these two commands (first one sleeps, second one suspends computer) worked fine:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to sleep'\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend \n\nThe order is apparently not important, neither command stops the other from completing.\nSorry for not making myself clear enough (Sometimes I want to put the computer to sleep without password prompt when waking).\n", "Q: Is my system vulnerable to Apple's new password-in-clear-text bug? \nWith the latest Lion security update, Mac OS X 10.7.3, Apple has accidentally turned on a debug log file outside of the encrypted area that stores the user’s password in clear text.\n\nHow can I determine whether my system if affected by this issue? If so, can I work around it, and also determine which users’ passwords have been exposed?\n\nA: As stated in the article linked in the question:\n\nAnyone who used FileVault encryption on their Mac prior to Lion, upgraded to Lion, but kept the folders encrypted using the legacy version of FileVault is vulnerable. FileVault 2 (whole disk encryption) is unaffected.\n\nThe password shows up in /var/log/secure.log.

Either server side or on my Mac? I need to be able to connect without the extra parameters. \nThanks\n\nA: Hmmm, seems we need to have this question re-answered every major release of OS X.\nSo I can only say this works on 10.10.x :)\nFrom OS X's man page for mount_nfs\n\"nfs.conf(5) can be used to configure some NFS client options. In particular, nfs.client.mount.options can be used to specify default mount options\"\nTo get the Finder to default to using NFS v4 add the following to /etc/nfs.conf using the terminal command \"sudo vi /etc/nfs.conf\"\n nfs.client.mount.options = vers=4\n\nAgain, to check after mounting use \"nfsstat -m\" and check the \"NFS parameters\".\n\nA: The syntax for using NFS v4 (and passing options in general) is :\nnfs://vers=4,10.0.10.26/srv\n\nYou can check the mount afterwards from the Terminal using :\nnfsstat -m\n\n\nA: I know this is an old question, I just wanted to note for current users that under Big Sur I am able to use\nnfs://vers=4,myhost.mydomain.com/nfs/share\n", "Q: How to make bash (Terminal.app) remember history of previous sessions? In my computer at work, my bash shell remembers history from previous sessions, even if I just opened a new terminal.\nIn my computer at home, this doesn't happen.\nI have the same OS 10.6.8 in both machines and I don't have any history related setting in .bash_profile.\nHow could I set this up on my home computer so it remembers history across sessions?\n\nA: I just discovered I had a similar problem, though my employer only has two Macs, and neither sits on my desk. Unacceptable, but a battle for another time.\nAnyway, at home, Mac Mini (migrated from MacBook Pro) did not cooperate even after setting .bashrc and/or .profile. Then I discovered that my ~/.bash_history file was mysteriously owned by root. Had to do this:\nsudo -iu root\ncd ~(myusername)\nchown (myusername) .bash_history\n\n(Yes, I know it can be done in fewer commands. Habit.)\nThen I exited Terminal, and started up a new one. Woot! All sorts of history previously lost came rushing back. How very nice.\nLikelihood anyone reading this has accidentally put themselves in this predicament: 0.2%. I'm sure I mucked this up when over-zealously \"fixing\" something else.\n\nA: I had this problem and what worked for me was create a file called .bash_sessions_disable in my user folder (~/).\nBasically OS X create history files in .bash_sessions folder for each session (in my case, one for each Tab). And even properly closing these sessions, OS X don't replay the historical to .bash_history.\nCreating the .bash_sessions_disable you disable this behavior.\ntouch ~/.bash_sessions_disable\n\n\nA: You'll need to tell bash where to keep your history file, and how many lines to keep:\n# Set the location of your HISTFILE\necho \"export HISTFILE=/Users/<USERNAME>/.bash_history\" >> ~/.bash_profile\n\n# Number of lines to keep (1000 in this example)\necho \"export HISTFILESIZE=1000\" >> ~/.bash_profile\n\n# Set how many commands to keep in the current session history list\necho \"export HISTSIZE=80\" >> ~/.bash_profile\n\n# Ignore commands that start with a space\necho \"export HISTIGNORE=\\\"&:[ ]*:exit\\\"\" >> ~/.bash_profile\n\n\nA: This answer from this Reddit thread saved me:\n\nIt's probably RVM preventing the exit \"hook\" for bash_sessions to run. If you comment out the following line in your .bash_profile, it should work.\n\n[[ -s \"$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm\" ]] && source \"$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm\"\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem as well, no history recorded. The given solutions didn't work, but at long last I found out that the problem was as simple as a missing .bash_history\nThe solution was to go to /home/[username]/ and add a file .bash_history, so\nnano .bash_history\n\nand then type anything in the file (otherwise it won't be created), exit and save. After this the history started functioning normally.\n\nA: If you add shopt -s histappend to your ~/.bash_profile then even with history sessions enabled (which it is by default in MacOS), the primary ~/.bash_history file will be appended with the results of each session. My ~/.bash_profile is configured as follows:\nexport HISTSIZE=100000000     # yes I know this is big I manage it manually\nexport HISTFILESIZE=100000000 # yes I know this is big I manage it manually\nshopt -s histappend\n\nThis answer applies to <= MacOS 10.15.x\n", "Q: Ping and curl resolve to one IP, dig/nslookup/host resolve to another OK, I have a very interesting case. I have a custom DNS server that is vending out IP addresses to varying servers in my test network. If I use dig, nslookup, or host, it tells me that it's properly resolving the IPs. If I ping or curl the hostname, it resolves to the actual external internet IP. \nIn my Network settings, I have only my custom DNS server, and this is correctly reflected in /etc/resolv.conf. I do not have this host in my /etc/hosts. If I add them, it will work, but I have multiple hosts that I'd have to add and remove, and I really want to know why this isn't working.\nI've tried dumping the DNS cache using both dscacheutil and restarting mDNSResponder. This has had no effect. If I lookup the hostname via dscacheutil, it resolves incorrectly.\nClearly, Directory Services is messed up somehow.

Also note that I'm using fully qualified domain names, i.e., foo.example.com or www.example.com.\nUPDATE:\nI also have a VPN enabled, but it's second in the Network list. The VPN is vending me a \"lookup domain\" that is the same as the domain that I'm trying to lookup. Somehow it's vending me a DNS server that is overriding the DNS server that I have set (Looks like a case of most-specific lookup). How can I tell it NOT to look via that server?\n\nA: And I found it. The VPN config was auto-configuring it's own DNS servers, which were overriding my setup, because the VPN was also telling it to look up hosts in the domain that I was overriding. This caused the Directory Services to use the VPN vended DNS servers. \nTo fix, I added my custom DNS server as the first lookup entry under the VPN DNS config, and that worked.\n\nA: I had this issue recently as well. Thanks to Kylar's reply I was able to piece a few things together. I was not using a VPN, however, I was plugged into Ethernet, and my WiFi was still enabled as well.\nEven tho WiFi was second in the Network list (and even tho the DNS servers were the same for both), I thought maybe there could be some internal issue where something wasn't updating properly?\nSo I turned off my WiFi connection and tested it again (solely on Ethernet), everything worked fine, curl & dig both resolved to the same IP. Really strange.\nSo then I tried to reenable WiFi, and it remained, curl & dig both resolved to the same IP.\nSo it seems that disabling and reenabling WiFi fixed the issue. I'm still not sure exactly why this fixed the issue, but it did for me, so I figured I'd share my findings here in case it helps someone else.\n", "Q: Does activating auto-login compromise secure password storage? or:\nDoes enabling auto-login in OS X add any additional security risks?\nHow does this auto-login work? I'm not a security expert, but I imagine that such a procedure would require the password to be stored somewhere in plain text, right? But then this specific location could be exploited by malicious software.\nWhere is the password for the auto-login stored?\nThe setting I'm referring to is located at:\nUsers & Groups → Login Options → Automatic login\n\n\nA: Enabling autologin does store the user's password in recoverable form, but it's not in plaintext (it's obscured, and no, I'm not going to tell you where it is).  The reason for this isn't to enable autologin itself, but to allow automatic access to the user's keychain (which is encrypted based on the user's password).\nThis doesn't weaken security too much; the main implications are that someone (/some malware) with root access to the computer (and/or physical control of it) can find out what your password is; but since they already have full control of the computer, that doesn't matter much.  It gives them access to your keychain (which a password reset wouldn't give them), and if you used the same password for other things they know that... but that's about it.\nRealistically, if you care at all about security, you shouldn't be enabling autologin anyway.\n\nA: Yes. If you enable automatic login, the keychain password is stored in /etc/kcpassword using XOR cipher, which can be decoded easily. You need root privileges to read it though.\nsudo ruby -e 'key = [125, 137, 82, 35, 210, 188, 221, 234, 163, 185, 31]; IO.read(\"/etc/kcpassword\").bytes.each_with_index { |b, i| break if key.include?(b); print [b ^ key[i % key.size]].pack(\"U*\") }'\nEven if automatic login was disabled, the login password can be reset in single user mode. It doesn't change the password of the login keychain though. If someone logged in to your account after resetting the login password, they could access most of your files normally, but they couldn't log in on your account in Mail or use auto-fill in Safari. If automatic login was enabled, they could see your passwords with something like security find-internet-password -s accounts.google.com -w and use Mail and auto-fill.\nThere was a vulnerability when automatic login was enabled:\n\nAccording to a leading password recovery software developer Passware, your password could be easily accessed via the direct memory access associated with the Mac’s FireWire port.\nIt seems that by enabling the “automatic login” feature the FireWire port on your Mac opens the door to unauthorized password recovery. It seems that this is an issue that has plagued Snow Leopard as well, but as it stands it does not look like there is any fix for it, apart from disabling “automatic login” and spending that extra second or two typing in your password.\n\nThe hash of the login password (which is usually also the password of the login keychain) is stored in /private/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/username.plist in 10.7 and 10.8. In 10.7 even relatively complex passwords could be cracked with DaveGrohl, but 10.8 switched to PBKDF2, which limits it to about 10 guesses per second per core.\n", "Q: How can I use Automator to generate a kerberos ticket using KINIT? I need to be able to generate a kerberos ticket for my MacBook Pro each time the machine restarts. I can manually run KINIT with my credentials to generate a ticket. What is the best way to automate that process? \n\nA: You can easily package shell commands inside an Automator application (or service) using the “Run Shell Script” action. However, this will run the commands in a non-interactive shell  (for an explanation of the difference between interactive and non-interactive shells, see the pertinent section of the Advanced Bash Scripting Guide – simply put, you will not have access to the terminal for the password prompt, and if kinit is not aware of this, your script will hang). There are two ways around that:\n\n\n*\n\n*script Terminal.app to execute your command instead of executing it directly. In that case, you will need a “Run AppleScript” action instead, containing the following command:\ntell application \"Terminal\" to do script \"kinit <options>\"\n\nwhich will open a new Terminal tab running the given command.\n\n*use kinit’s --password-file option and pass it the password inside your workflow, i.e.\necho <password> | kinit --passwordfile=STDIN <options>\n\nTo avoid storing your password in plain text inside the workflow, you can securely store it in the OS X Keychain and retrieve it from there. Although possible via a shell script (the TextMate blog has details on how to achieve that – be sure to read the comments), there are so many gotchas to that I’d recommend  using a bit of AppleScript and Daniel Jalkut’s excellent Usable Keychain Scripting app. Once installed, the following bit of AppleScript will retrieve your password (assuming the account name is “kinit”):\ntell application \"Usable Keychain Scripting\" to get password of first generic item of current keychain whose account is \"kinit\"\n\nEither wrap it in an osascript shell command, i.e.\npassphrase=$(osascript -e '<command above>')\n\nor, as you are using Automator, add an AppleScript action, retrieve the passphrase inside it and pass it to the shell script.\n\nA: Just wanna chime in; i didn't fancy putting my password into the keychain so i wrote a quick applescript to pick up from a user prompt:\non run {input, parameters}\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set the_username to do shell script \"whoami\"\n    set the_password to \"password\"\n    display dialog \"Enter password\" default answer \"password\" buttons {\"OK\", \"Cancel\"} default button \"OK\" with icon 2 with title \"SLAC Kerberos\" with hidden answer\n    set the_password to text returned of the result\nend tell\nreturn {the_username, the_password}\nend run\n\nof course, you probably wanna put the domain into your username too. and then, from a shell script you can do something like:\necho $2 | kinit --password-file=STDIN $1\n\nwhat would be nice would be to check the output form the shell script to check for incorrect passwords etc.\n", "Q: How do add new proofing languages to Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac? How is possible to add new spellchecking languages to Office 2011 for Mac?\nI am referring to languages that are not listed in the relatively small (~20) default list of languages.\n\nA: It is impossible, but a good place to ask might be the forums run by MS for its products:\nhttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macword\n", "Q: What does the Flashback malware do? There was a question about removing the Flashback malware from your OS X machine, but I'm still not clear on what it does. What exactly does the Flashback malware do once it is installed on your Mac?\n\nA: From Wikipedia:\n\nThe Trojan [FlashBack] targets a Java vulnerability on Mac OS X. The system is\n  infected after the user is redirected to a compromised bogus site,\n  where JavaScript code causes an applet containing an exploit to load.\n  An executable file is saved on the local machine, which is used to\n  download and run malicious code from a remote location. The malware\n  also switches between various servers for optimised load balancing.\n  Each bot is given a unique ID that is sent to the control server.. The\n  trojan, however, will only infect the user visiting the infected web\n  page, meaning other users on the computer are not infected unless\n  their user accounts have been infected separately, this is due to the\n  UNIX security system.\n\nFor a lengthier, more technical description, read this F-Secure article.\n\nA: It means someone has bypassed the security on your Mac and can install new programs, steal data like passwords, banking web site locations and perhaps other sensitive personal emails and information.  \nIt also means then can install other software on your Mac if it connects to the Internet to further do similar acts of I'll repute. \nLastly, it could crash your Mac if the program has logic errors or was not thoroughly tested.\n\nIf you are really interested in this subject, here are some links I have found to be helpful to understand the problem. The program itself is clearly quite sophisticated and will try to install itself as an admin process (total control) and if it cannot escalate itself to the equivalent of root access, will still install itself as a user level process and work with your files, but not the whole machine's data. \nThe company, Intego, that first reported this exploit has a established good record for providing balanced reports and assessments of the risks of Mac malware. It was specifically designed to grab passwords and although reports of mitigation efforts have surely lessened the brunt of the damage, I believe it's folly to assume all variants of the \"flashback\" trojan are completely neutralized or even detected perfectly.\nWhat is always worrisome is when a trojan successfully has gotten control of a computer and can check in with other computers to download new instructions, the sky is the limit as to what can be done if the program is undetected and the people running it have a chance to make money from exploiting personal information, passwords or just driving traffic to sites that they receive compensation from legitimate and networks like Google and others.\nAdditional reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.macworld.com/article/1166622/symantec_flashback_malware_netted_upwards_of_10000_a_day.html\n\n*http://www.macworld.com/article/1165534/intego_finds_new_insidious_strain_of_mac_flashback_trojan_horse.html\nI don't mean to cause undue alarm, but this program not only was caught steering search results to pay click revenue on a massive scale but also did a good job of attempting to collect passwords from macs that were compromised before countermeasures were deployed.\n\nA: the short answer is that it did nothing,  the long answer is The malicious servers were not \"turned on\" as of the date of the OP question.  they were not \"turned on\" to push anything towards the botnet, or towards the infected machines.\nif they are turned on today.. or when ever someone reads this,  they will still not be able to do anything, because the number of machines infected was exaggerated in the first place by \"estimates\", (which is why it was not \"turned on\",  it didn't have enough)    and what ever the real number was,  it is now down to such a small number that the effectiveness of the botnet,  (which was set up to do a Denial of service type of attack)  is completely non effective as a DNS..  so it did and does, and will do nothing....\nmalware can also try and steal passwords or user logins...  what people fail to tell you is that the app that would have to be downloaded to do that is extremely complex, and also not actually done here. (none of the applets you hear about that it \"installed\" did this) (nor could it in reality)\nthere has been a lot of mis-information passed off about this...  including the \"estimates\" of infection..  done by a Russian security firm...  (the mis-information is mainly done to hype security products and brand names to try and get people to spend some money someday)\nto prove how \"off\" the estimates were,  other teams of \"security\" firms, that were not russian,  weeks later showed far fewer infections,  which is not proof in itself,  what was proof, was that the original Russian security firm then came out with a new number that was close to the original number of infections...  showing their \"estimates\" to always be off...  (a second russian security firm \"confirmed\" their numbers,  but in reality they were working together)....\nthe second bit of misinformation was that it could \"infect\" your computer without you putting in your password,   this is not correct,  it could put an applet in a directory of safari(or other),  only if you gave it your password...  what it was doing if it did not get you to type in a password,  was other vectors of attack which in general were not effective... \nas proof of this...  the steps to remove the applet from \"security firms\" included terminal sudo commands that require your password,  in otherwords to delete it,  you needed a password,  to add it also needed your password...  (there are exceptions to this,  like running as root,  and the number of users doing this in my immediate vicinity of 1000 mile radius I could count on one hand)  (i am exaggerating,  but only to show the point)...\nin short you are only a victim of overhype...  WAY overhype...   nearly every variant of this until people were so aware of it that it no longer could infect,  was a version that pretended to be a flash update,  or similar...  (hence the name)   \nif you didn't get a prompt to \"update\" your flash with a big box like installer message...   and more importantly were smarter than an average computer user and recognized that every social engineered attack route starts out by...  \"you need to install an update\"  or you should install a anti-virus software app...\nthen you don't even need to check to see if you have the malware...\nas a matter of fact a little bit of a fact goes a long ways in understanding this...\nmore people are infected by installing \"anti-virus\" software,  which infact was the trojan than other malware now adays...   \nand here is some more...   more computer users have lost data (or down time) to LEGITIMATE anti-virus software,  than Mac users have lost data (or down time) to malware...   because the software programs themselves had bugs in them that updates from the companies would go rogue  believing some files were not correct... which were actually important files...\nhere is another,  not a single AV software package detects or are able to get rid of the malware,  until the malware is in the wild... and you have to update that AV-software....  this is not preemptive software,  it is after the fact software...   which does a mac user little good...   especially if you are a user who does keep on top of things.. and you know about things about the same time an update is available...\n", "Q: Is it possible to use custom fonts in Mobile Safari?

There is lots of advice that suggests using a shared Apple ID for purchasing things (so that all devices using that Apple ID for purchasing can access those purchases) and to then use a separate Apple ID for iCloud for each \"user\". \nThis makes perfect sense to me, but what should be done if there is currently 1 Apple ID (my account) that is used for all the purchases and also is used for my iCloud, and I want to add another user to the mix?\nWhat problems will there be if my Apple ID is used for the purchases on all devices and also used for my iCloud account for my user, while a different Apple ID is used for iCloud for a different user?\nNote: The places this would apply to would be my iPhone, another iPhone, and 2 user accounts on an iMac (one for me and another for the other user)\n\nA: In your first question you ask:\n\nwhat should be done if there is currently 1 Apple ID (my account) that is used for all the purchases and also is used for my iCloud, and I want to add another user to the mix?\n\nTo enable you to share purchases the new user will use your Apple ID for the App Store and iTunes. This use would then create a new Apple ID or use an existing one for the iCloud portion. They would assign this Apple ID to iCloud by clicking Settings -> iCloud -> Account. \n\nSecondly you ask:\n\nWhat problems will there be if my Apple ID is used for the purchases on all devices and also used for my iCloud account for my user, while a different Apple ID is used for iCloud for a different user?\n\nThis is the solution I noted above, and the preferred method. By separating iCloud accounts for each user you'll have less devices competing for the 5 GB of free space allotted by default.\n\nIn summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*All devices use Apple ID for Store (Settings -> Store -> Apple ID)\n\n*Your devices would use your Apple ID for iCloud (Settings -> iCloud -> Account)\n\n*Other user's devices would use a unique Apple ID for iCloud (Settings -> iCloud -> Account)\n\n*There are no drawbacks to sharing an Apple ID and using individual accounts for iCloud.\n\n", "Q: OS X Lion mysterious user cron job just does echo \"PATH is $PATH\" OS X Lion 10.7.3.\nConsole view of system.log shows log entries for cron jobs defined in my user crontab as expected.

My MacBook Air w/Lion is getting sent in for repairs, and IT gave me a MacBook Pro w/Snow Leopard. I have a current backup of my Air, and I'd like to get this MBP to run Lion with all my apps, files, settings, etc...\nWe were theorizing that we need to wipe the hard drive on this MBP and then try to boot from the Snow Leopard disk and do an install from Time Machine backup. And since that is the Lion install with all my stuff, everything will just work.\nDoes that sound like it will work?\n\nA: I think the best way to proceed is like this : \n\n\n*\n\n*First, see with your IT department to gave you an Mac OS Lion copy (from\nMac App Store or on a usb drive)\n\n*Next install Lion and restore with your TM Backup\n\n\nIf you cannot have a Mac OS Lion copy, you can try to navigate to your TM Backup (with a Finder) and copy only what you need on your disk (it depends on what you need to work, if it's just some documents for example it should ok, but I do not recommand to copy an app).\n\nA: I doubt that it would work -- all the lion os stuff will be wrong, and will probably break the resulting install.  That said, trying it should only waste time -- worst comes to worse, you still have your backup and can reinstall snow leopard from the disk (I assume that there is nothing worthwhile on the macbook pro currently).\n\nA: The issue is that a Time Machine backup is a disk image. That means that it preserves the OS, and all its functionality.\nWhat I believe you could do, although I haven't tried it myself, is use Migration Assistant (Applications/Utilities/Migration Assistant.app) to transfer your files.

I was late to work today because it didn't wake me up.\nOn my Android I could set the Alarm volume separately (and also automatically turn my ringer and notifications to silent based on the time of day). How can do this on Apple's flagship phone?\nThanks!\n\nA: The Alarm sound is independent from the hardware mute switch.  Essentially there are 2 volume states for iOS.  One is for system notifications (Alarms, calendar events, emails, SMS, other notifications etc) and one is for playback of music etc in Games, playing music, videos etc etc.\nApps have a choice what to do what the hardware switch is set to mute.  The intention is that even with the switch set, you can still hear sounds, the thinking being you have specifically chosen to hear those sounds at that moment in time by playing the video (for example).  Therefore, many such sounds \"play through\" the hardware mute.  However, some apps decide to take things another way, and look for the switch state, and match the App actions accordingly.\nBoth of these volume levels can be set to different levels.  In fact, there are sub-levels of the App volume level, in that you can retain different levels depending on whether you are using the speaker, headphones, or a headset (It will switch to the last set level for each type as and when you plug/unplug the relevant accessory)\nEither way, the Alarm will ring using the normal notifications volume level (the one you can set at the home screen without any apps running, labeled \"Ringer\") regardless of your mute switch setting, so just turn it up, flip the mute switch, and unless you fire up a game whilst sleep-gaming, the only sound that will ever disturb you is the Alarm, and/or someone using Find my Phone, which also plays (actually at Max volume) regardless of the setting.\n\nA: As far as I know, you cant, at least with a non-jailbroken iPhone.\nIn case you dont know, althought the device is in silent mode, the Alarm still sounds, therefore, if the problem is with the sound being too low, you could, just, increase the general volume of the device.\n\nA: I just want to add that the iPhone does actually have a useful 'Do Not Disturb' Mode, that is very similar to the Android 'Quite Times' setting. I recently moved from Android to iPhone and missed this feature too until I found it. \nSettings > Do Not Disturb: toggle on or off manually\nOr, to program it automatically, \nSettings > Notifications > Do Not Disturb > then...\n\n\n*\n\n*toggle Schedule, adjust times to suit your preference; \n\n*choose if/who you want to allow calls from; \n\n*toggle 'Repeated Calls' on or off to allow the second call from the same number within 3 minutes to not be silenced (i.e. your boss is trying to reach you 'cuz you slept in ;-)\nHope this helps and Enjoy!\n", "Q: iPhone first generation LCD replacement My kid dropped my first generation iPhone and now several parts of the display only show grey. Looks like some pixels died. There are no cracks on the screen and touch works in the areas that are grey. \nWhat should I replace to fix this? I believe the screen is made up of different components (glass, LCD etc). Should I replace the whole display unit or can I just replace the part that is broken?\n\nA: It's unlikely that the pixels have died, but the edge connector of the screen may have become dislodged or damaged, or it could be that the connection to the logic board could be loose.\nYou can try following this ifixit guide to see if taking it apart and reassembling it will restore any bad connections that dropping it may have caused.\nIf that doesn't work, you can just replace the display, as on pre iPhone 4 models the screen/digitiser and display are separate components, so if that's the only damaged component then it should fix the problem.\n", "Q: iPhone 4S Safari Scrolling I've recently switched from Android to an iPhone 4S, and while it's great, there's a few annoying issues. One of them is when I'm viewing long web pages. On my Android I could flick the screen and it would scroll at speed, allowing me to quickly get to the bottom of a long page with minimal finger strain.\nWhile other Apple apps do this, Safari seems to stop scrolling almost the second I let go of the screen, making long pages a laborious task (e.g. Checking for new comments at the bottom of a blog post).\nIs there any way to alter this?\n\nA: If you were on a Mac I would say that you had turned off the Inertial Scrolling preference, but there is no such setting for iOS devices running Safari, and it should be the default behaviour at all times.\nThe answer by @Aaron is a good start to force quit an App (note this works for all apps, although in many cases the app isn't really running in the background, it just has a saved state that allows to a fast restart that you can clear using this method).\nIf it's still doing this after you have restarted it, check for other scrolling characteristics to see if there are other issues.  If you scroll past the top/bottom of a page, and let go, does it \"bounce back\" (rubber banding), or can you not extend past the edges?\nOther than that, you can work on your flick technique, as it were, release your finger before it gets to the edge of the screen, can you get different distances each time, or is it a pretty much static scroll?  You should be able to get anything from a few lines to a few pages.\nLastly, and this isn't in your question but it related to scrolling large distances, when at the bottom, you can scroll to the top in a single stroke just by tapping the very top of the screen; this should work in any vertically scrolling app (Twitter clients, etc), not just Safari.\n\nA: This is not normal behavior for Safari on the iPhone, though I've seen this occur on my iPhone a few times. You might want to force the Safari app to close by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hit the home button to close Safari\n\n*Double tap the home button to show recently used applications\n\n*Tap and hold on Safari\n\n*Click the red X badge on Safari\n\n", "Q: Does iOS support IEEE802.11e QOS functionality? As the title says, I would like to understand if iOS devices (iPhone, iPad mainly) support the IEEE802.11e (IEEE802.11-2007) protocol?\nThis protocol enhancement enables QOS support on WiFi.\n\nA: Certainly on the Airport range, MacBooks, and iOS devices there's no QOS, Apple doesn't support it. Not sure about the Mac Pro or Xserve.\nEDIT: In response to requests for sources, it's very hard to find an official source for something that isn't implemented, but a simple google search for \"does apple support qos\" will result in many links to posts about someone asking the question about various Apple products, several on Apple's own support communities. Everything points to no QOS because it simply doesn't exist on Apple products.\n", "Q: Darwin/Linux/Unix command line email client that supports iCloud? I need to access my iCloud email from a command line.\nIs there a command line client for Mac OS X (and/or Linux and/or Unix) that can connect to Apple's (I assume it is IMAP) servers?\n\nA: A popular command line e-mail clients is Mutt. Use a package manager such as Brew or Macports to install it on MacOS. Have a look at this page for some pointers.\nYou can find the IMAP settings for iCloud in this Support article.\n", "Q: Safari autofill multiple e-mail adresses My personal vCard has multiple email addresses. When I use the autofill feature from Safari I always get the wrong email address filled into the web form. How can I get Safari autofill to use the right email address? \n\nA: It will default to the first email address in the list, so put the one you want to use for autofill first in your address book and it will then use that one.\n\nA: Safari's too dumb to select the first on the list.\nYou have to create a new card with ONLY the info you want to be autofilled & designate that card \"Me\"\nOr, change to Opera browser which enables you to nominate multiple entries for multiple fields, then presents them as Drop-Down Lists.

I have a iPhone 4S. They created a contact with my name, added my number (I live in UK, in the following format +44 7XXXXXXXXX). I have created a contact called Mom on my mobile with her Apple ID (i.e., the email address). \nWhen I create a new message...I am able to pick the contact and Message turns to iMessage. The \"Send\" button turns from (hulk) green to (blue). I send a message. It is sent, but I do not get a delivered report. \nWhen my mom creates a new message, she is able to pick my contact and Message turns to iMessage and \"Send\" turns from (hulk) green to (blue). However, it fails and comes up with the red exclamation mark. \nAny ideas what could be the problem?\n\nA: Try turning off iMessage in Settings, reboot the device, and turn on and log into iMessage again.  This should re-register your device with Apple's iMessage servers, and may resolve your problem.\nThis has fixed a similar issue for my iPhone in the past.\n", "Q: How to disable iPhone notifications from Facebook Places? I've got this long-running annoyance about the Facebook iPhone app. \nNow, I do want notifications from Facebook e.g. when someone posts on my wall/timeline or mentions me in a comment.  However, every now and again, some of my friends check in (or whatever it's technically called) somewhere with Facebook, and I get a big alert about it:\n\nI most certainly do not want these notifications! And I don't really follow why Facebook considers someone's random check-in an event that I should be notified about. \nQuestion is, how can I disable these—or all Facebook Places related notifications, while at it? Are there any settings on the Facebook website related to this?\nI'm asking at Webapps SE, and not e.g. Apple SE, because I'm pretty sure the iPhone app doesn't have any related settings. The only FB notification setting I see is this one: \n\n(...and as said, I wouldn't want to turn off all FB notifications.)\n\nA: Turns out I was wrong; you can configure this on iPhone.\nAs the guide on this page taught me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings\n\n*Scroll down to the application list and select Facebook\n\n*Choose Push Notifications \n\n\nNow, in my case it was probably Nearby Friends that I mostly wanted to disable. I ended up turning off some others too:\n\n\nA: This has been driving me crazy because the notifications show up in the web browser Facebook, but the settings can only be accessed and turned off from the Facebook iOS app. \nNote that the Facebook app has a new UI and that these settings are now inside the iOS app. I already had all Facebook iOS notifications off. \nEven worse, Facebook's notion of what's nearby makes no sense for an urban area. 15 miles away, across the bridge, who cares? Stop notifying me.\nThanks.\n\nA: here is how to remove it : go to your facebook on your phone; slide to the right so you can see newsfeed, messages, etc etc , go to Account Setting, then go to Notifications, then go to Mobile Push, then uncheck NEARBY FRIENDS.......There you have it !!!\n", "Q: iTerm2 terminals close immediately with \"argpath=login error=No such file or directory\" Whenever I try to open a new terminal window in iTerm, it closes right away after displaying this:\n## exec failed ##\nargpath=login error=No such file or directory\n\nDoes anyone know what is causing this? Thanks!\nNotes\n\n*\n\n*The terminal is working fine\n\n*The default command for new iTerm sessions is set to Login shell\n\nA: Not sure why it didn't work with Login shell selected, but I changed it to \n⌘ command and invoked bash -l or /bin/bash -l to make it work the same way. Hope this helps anyone else who has the same problem!\n\n\nA: I had the same error, and the cause was that my PATH variable wasn't set correctly (I had meddled with it). Restoring a proper value using setenv fixed the issue. If you have meddled with your launchd path, you must edit it with launchctl.\nIn a terminal:\nlaunchctl\nsetenv PATH /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin\n\nYou may have to add the path to your /etc/launchd.conf file, and restart your computer as well.

My iPhone's lcd is crashed last night and I want to get a new one. I just wanted to know what people's though are on normal iPhone vs refurb iPhone. What's the real difference?\n\nA: If you get a refurb from Apple then it will come with the same warranty as a new phone. It is not a scratch n dent type phone, but will look and feel new.\nNot 100% about getting one from a provider like AT&T or Verizon, but I think they will also provide a full warranty.\n\nA: I got a refurb phone ~10 months ago. From my experience, the battery degradation was much quicker than a normal phone. I feel that the phone was used for a while they fixed it but the battery was used.\nOverall, it does not worth the 50$ difference to get a cheap refurbished phone.\n", "Q: Where did the command-backtick keyboard shortcut go in 10.7 Lion? With every Mac OS X I've ever used, hitting command-backtick (`) cycled to the next window.  I just installed Mac OS X 10.7 (on top of a perfectly fresh 10.6), and command-backtick does nothing at all.\nDid this feature go away?\n\nA: You might also be interested in Hyperswitch.\nAlong with Command ⌘ + Tab ⇥, hyperswitch allows Option ⌥ + Tab ⇥ to switch between windows of the same app. I find it much more useful than Command ⌘ + ~ (tilde) since Command ⌘ + ~ (tilde) only iterates through all windows, rather than just toggling between two.\n\nA: This feature is still present (I'm using 10.7.3 and it works for me).\nGo to System Preferences > Keyboard and check the keyboard shortcuts.

Does anyone know what's going on here?\nEdit: I haven't seen those errors after I replaced TextEdit with TextEditPlus. It's based on TextEdit's source code but it disables sandboxing and makes a few other changes.\n\nA: It seems that this is actually a bug in Apple's sandboxing implementation. This means that none of the steps above should help. We had the same console output in one of our applications (including the inability to save text) and spent quite some time on finding the cause of the bug (see this radar). From what we've found out, it seems that after retrieving the recently opened documents for a number of times, the application cannot save files anymore because it does not get the permission to do so. You could try clearing the recently used documents menu, maybe this helps.\n\nA: There's, in Lion, a hidden way of repairing permissions, which seems to be even more effective:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart Lion, and Before you hear the chime, hold down Cmd + R, to access Lion Recovery.\n\n*Click the Utilities item in the Menu Bar, then click Terminal.\n\n*In the Terminal window, type resetpassword and hit Return.\n\n*The password reset utility window launches, but you’re not going to reset the password.

I've seen advice on an per-application basis, but is there a standard approach like Add/Remove Programs in Windows?\n\nA: None that I know of (as advertised by Apple, I mean).  I found this on my bookmarks: http://www.thexlab.com/faqs/uninstallingapps.html, which might give you a better idea of what to do before and after installing applications.\nThere are a few apps that take care of this too like: AppCleaner which tries to find the documents and settings the application uses (though it's debatable how efficient/reliable this apps or any app of this nature really are)\n\nA: The vast majority of OS X programs are actually bundles; if you open the terminal and navigate to the application folder, you'll find that your applications are actually directories (folders). Inside are various libraries, executables, resource files, etc.\nTo uninstall you usually...usually...just drag the application to the trash and empty it. Then do a search from the Spotlight textbox (think it's a dropdown from the magnifying glass in the corner) and look for the application name to find any .plist files in the library folder(s); those are the preferences. You can drag and drop those into the trash as well. Then the application should be gone.\nI say usually because some applications did use installers when you put them in, and sometimes those installers can when re-run uninstall the program. The majority, though, can be eliminated as described above, especially if you installed it by dragging it to the application folder in the first place.\nIf you screw up somehow you could always just reinstall the application and look for a README file in the installer DMG volume. I've seen a lot of applications that come with a README just to tell you to drag the application to the trash to uninstall it.\n\nA: Remember that (most) Mac OS X apps are installed self-contained; i.e., you simply drag a copy of the *.app folder into the Applications directory of your choice.\nOnce reason for this is to simplify the uninstall - delete the app folder; simple.\n\nA: Use Spotlight. \nFirst drag the app to the trash. Wait.\nFirst background:\n man hier   # get an idea of where that stuff should be.\n\nThen run:\n mdfind -name AppName      #identify all the stuff that got left behind.\n\nThen to actually remove all files, which is what you would want:\n mdfind -name AppName | parallel rm -rf {}      # xargs works as well, but not as cool\n\nThere is something I just don't get about uninstallers i guess, on OSX.  Files have a place to go, it's all very well documented, I do not understand why 9/10 uninstall scripts leave preferences, and Cache and Application Support directories around.  \n\nA: Nope. The installer framework in OS X (.pkg files) does not actually support uninstall. So it's manual cleanup on a case by case basis.\n\nA: The other comments here are right on for uninstalling applications, however you may want to try something like Hazel which has functionality for deleting an application's related/support files when you have dragged the app to the trash.\n\nA: I've used AppZapper with good results\n\nA: I use a one liner borrowed from a user somewhere else on this site, or related sister site, or from macosxhints (I no longer remember the reference or I'd post a link), that I turned into a script (called \"uninstaller\") and adjusted slightly by changing the rm command to using a safer command line program installed using macports, rmtrash. The user provided bom receipt file should be in /private/var/db/receipts if the application to be removed was installed using an installer and the dev included one. The script will place all files installed into the user's Trash.\n #!/bin/bash\n #uninstaller /private/var/db/receipts/com.url.name.of.app.bom\n #uninstall os x application installed with installer -pkg\n #using (user) provided bom receipt\n #place all installed files and directories in user's Trash\n\n lsbom=\"/usr/bin/lsbom\"\n cd=\"/usr/bin/cd\"\n sudo=\"/usr/bin/sudo\"\n xargs=\"/usr/bin/xargs\"\n rmtrash=\"/opt/local/bin/rmtrash\"\n\n lsbom -fls \"$1\" | (cd /; sudo xargs rmtrash -u $USER)\n exit\n\nInstalling MacPorts and rmtrash is simple enough, however, once xcode (for Mavericks 10.9 xcode_5.1.1.dmg) is installed:\n curl -Ok https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-2.2.1.tar.bz2\n tar xf MacPorts-2.2.1.tar.bz2\n cd MacPorts-2.2.1\n ./configure\n make\n sudo make install #not war!\n cd ..\n rm -rf Macports-*\n sudo /opt/local/bin/port -v selfupdate\n export PATH=$HOME/macports/bin:$HOME/macports/sbin:$PATH\n export MANPATH=$HOME/macports/share/man:$MANPATH\n sudo port -vsc install rmtrash\n diskutil quiet repairPermissions /\n\n", "Q: Can I restore data backed up from a newer version of iOS? I have a 3gs with iOS 5.1.  I backed up my data, and wanted to restore to my new iPhone 4, with iOS 5.0.1.  Somehow, I was not given an option to restore my backup.  Is it possible to restore backup to a device that has older firmware?\n\nA: Unfortunately you cannot restore an iOS device to any backup that had been done from a newer version of iOS, using either iCloud or iTunes, due to the firmware. \niTunes will give an error and iCloud will not even show the backup as an option to restore from. \nTo be able to use the backup that you have, you must upgrade the iPhone 4 to the newest 5.1.1 update that was just released. It should go smooth from there. \nI work at the Genius Bar at an Apple Store. \n\nA: It should be easy enough to set up the new iPhone 4 (temporarily), upgrade to iOS 5.1.1 (or whatever is a convenient latest version), and then restore from your backup to there, making your question moot.\nI honestly don't know the answer to your question, nor do I have a way to test it to find the answer, but there's a straightforward workaround.\n", "Q: What is the performance bottleneck when launching large applications on OS X? I have an Early 2011 13\" Macbook Pro (i5 2.3Ghz).\nI've upgraded it to have 8GB 1333 ram and an OCZ Vertex II (120GB) SSD.\nThere are a couple of heavy lifting apps on my mac that take roughly around 10 seconds to launch (WebStorm being one of them).\nI was hoping that having an SSD in the machine would increase performance (and it has) but I'm still too impatient for these waits.\nI'm considering installing a second OCZ Vertex III (120GB) SSD into the superdrive slot and configuring it in a RAID0 in hopes of increasing disk performance even further.\nMy question is, what are the primary bottlenecks that are causing apps to launch slowly on my Mac? If it's something other than the disk, I might as well save my $$$.\n\nA: Activity Monitor is a good starting point. At a minimum, you can determine whether your system is becoming CPU-bound when you start the large application. It can also show how system memory is being utilized and whether excessive swapping is taking place. An Apple KB notes:\n\nTip: Page outs occur when the Mac has to write information from RAM to\n  the hard drive (because RAM is full).  Adding more RAM may reduce page\n  outs.\n\nThis Quora post has a reference to another good tool - the Shark utility from the Apple Developer Tool Suite:\n\nShark from the Developer Tools suite (CHUD) provide even more powerful\n  process inspection capabilities and organizes bottom-up and top-down\n  trees of where your time goes for the entire space of function calls,\n  and is even decent at explaining where the bottlenecks are, sometimes\n  suggesting low-level optimizations.\n\nApple's Developer Library notes:\n\nShark is an advanced tool for sampling or tracing a single application\n  or all running applications. Like Instruments, Shark provides a set of\n  powerful analysis tools with an easy-to-use interface to help you\n  gather performance data. Shark helps you isolate problems quickly by\n  providing a rich set of data-mining features and is an indispensable\n  tool for finding performance bottlenecks. It provides optimization\n  tips and help with analyzing assembly-level operations. Because it\n  traces operations down at the kernel-level of the system, Shark can\n  also provide you with tremendous insight about the behavior of your\n  application relative to the rest of the system.\nAmong the types of operations you can perform in Shark are the\n  following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Statistical sampling of your application over a period of time \n  \n*System-level tracing \n  \n*Malloc tracing \n  \n*Static analysis \n  \n*L2 Cache profiling \n  \n*Processor bandwidth analysis \n  \n*Java code analysis \n  \n  \n  In addition to basic sampling, Shark also offers the windowed time\n  facility feature for several of its sampling options. The windowed\n  time facility tells Shark to record and process a finite buffer of the\n  most recently acquired samples. This feature lets Shark record data\n  continuously and for long periods of time in the background. You can\n  then direct Shark to stop sampling only after something interesting\n  occurs in your code and to display the samples related to that\n  interesting behavior. Thus, you can use this feature to determine what\n  part of your program’s execution is interesting after it occurs.\nFor a quick example of how to use Shark, see “Using Shark.” For\n  detailed information about Shark, see Shark User Guide.\n\nThe page also lists a number of other tools in the developer tool suite that can be used to monitor your system's performance and hopefully pin down any potential bottlenecks before you buy the second SSD.\n", "Q: samples on Garageband on the iPhone?

This is crazy-annoying.\nAfter reading this other thread explaining how to craft a DMG with a script to surface the window, I now believe this is the normal behavior on Lion.\nHow might I \"fix things\" so I get a DMG to pop up without needing to reprogram each one?\n\nA: Digging around on Apple Discussions, I found this hint for this problem:\nIn Terminal.app, execute (all on one line, no carriage return) \n(does not require sudo)\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister  -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\nA successful run produces no output.\nAfter doing that on my machine (OS X 10.8.2 12C60), the expected behavior for read-only .dmg's momentarily occurs, i.e. when opening .dmg's from Firefox or from the Downloads folder on the Dock, after accepting the license agreement (if one is present,) the Finder window for the .dmg pops to the foreground.\nBUT, this desirable behavior only seems to last a matter of seconds before the old behavior (opening under other windows) recurs. Not sure what to make of it.  Probably some conflict going on within LaunchServices, either an Apple bug, or maybe interference from some other application.\nIn my case, I have a lot of third party file-system and UI tools such as PathFinder, DefaultFolderX, KeyboardMaestroX, etc, maybe one of these is to blame.\n", "Q: Make iTunes stop prompting me for my username and password On OSX Lion, iTunes keeps prompting me to enter my username and password to \"sign in to enable this computer for automatic downloads.\" In the past I tried checking the box to remember my password but it kept forgetting, so now I just disabled the \"always check for available downloads\" option in Prefs -> Store. It still prompts me. It drives me crazy.\nIs there a way to get it to stop prompting for my password, so it will just behave like a well-behaved offline music library manager, and only ask me for my username and password when I open the iTunes store?\n\nA: All you need to do is Sign OUT of the itunes store!\nIf you are signed in, each time you fire up iTunes, it will try to login again and ask for your password. Sign out and it won't bother you!\n\nA: Try to resetting your warnings, as suggested in this thread:\n\nOpen iTunes/preferences/advanced, then hit the box in the middle that says \"reset warnings\".\n\n\nA: This sounds like you might have duplicate iTunes password entries in your keychain. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open your Keychain.app and search for entries with \"iTunes\" in it\n\n*delete those iTunes entries (you need to know your passwords!)\n\n*reboot (to clear out your cache) \n\n\nNow try again.\n\nA: Possibly sign out of iTunes store, then click \"Deauthorize This Computer\" under store tab in menu bar, then reauthorize your computer, then sign back in to iTunes store.\n\nA: I have an older laptop running OS X.  I finally found out how to stop iTunes from asking for a password with each restore.  Click System Preferences > Users and Groups > Login items > deselect iTunes.\n\nA: I just deleted iTunes no more sign ins. Hooray. \n\nA: I am running Windows 7. I was getting the popup every 2 min until I got mad and just clicked the \"X\" to close the window that asks for password instead of complying with the machine. It hasn't prompted me for a login since and I have been commissioning multiple iPads for use at our Production Plant.\n", "Q: How do I open two/multiple fullscreen views simultaneously in 10.7 Lion? When I open two Lion-supported-fullscreen apps in dual-monitor mode, one monitor shows one app while the other monitor shows a \"fabric\" pattern/texture. The other fullscreen app is available by swipe or Mission Control as another view, but I'd prefer to have the two fullscreen apps up simultaneously (and no cloth pattern texture on the other screen). Is there a way to customize my setup natively or with apps to accommodate?\nMoreover, is there a way to disable the second screen's \"fabric\" pattern/texture altogether (showing the desktop or other apps in that view)?\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, you can't. I am hoping Apple will fix this as soon as possible as well.\nThere's a trick where you can put some app in the fabric space, as documented in OS X hints.\n\nHowever, if you utilize the full-screen swipe gesture to move to a separate full screen and pause/stop in the middle with multiple Spaces in view and invoke another application (i.e. via Spotlight), the spawned application can reside in the 'fabric space' or anywhere else. It basically remains attached to that space. \n\n\nA: you have to go to system preferences, display settings with both monitors attached.  And you can choose one screen to be a primary with the menu top and bottom, (if that's where you have them).  the second screen, will be secondary, and you can choose a unique photo background for it, as it will have its own preferences open on that screen. if you have a laptop screen open, it will use that as the 2nd monitor as well, if you have one main monitor.  and in expose, you should have the same background picture for each virtual desktop.  \n", "Q: OS X 10.6.8 Function Keys (brightness, playback control) no longer working I have a 27\" iMac (2009) running the OS X 10.6.8 and using the Apple Wireless Keyboard.  Since around March or early April, I noticed that the function keys (F1-F9) have stopped working. I think it started with one of the recent software updates.  \nNow, I can no longer control the brightness or media playback with the keyboard function keys.  Looking at the on-screen keyboard, it's like the F1-F9 keys are not even registered by the OS.  The volume keys (F10-F12) do still work.\nWhile I can still control the brightness in System Preferences, this is still a big problem for me because when I try to use the iMac in target display mode with a MacBook Air (2011), the iMac goes to full brightness and I cannot adjust it down anymore with the keyboard buttons like I could before.  This makes it unusable as a secondary display.\nI have tried a lot of stuff but nothing seems to help.  I have noticed a few posts on the Apple support forums with similar problems but there doesn't seem to be a resolution yet.\nThings I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*restarting computer\n\n*PRAM reset\n\n*SMC reset\n\n*disconnecting and re-pairing the keyboard\n\n*replacing keyboard batteries\n\n*using a different keyboard\n\n*repairing disk permissions\n\n*toggling the \"Use F1,F2 keys...\" setting\n\n\nAnother weird thing I noticed is that now the keyboard defaults seem to be mapped weird - it says that the brightness controls are mapped to F14/F15 when I don't even have those keys.  And some of the other functions like Dashboard also got their defaults to different keys.\nIf I try mapping the brightness controls different keys such as F11/F12, I get the \"invalid input\" beep when I try pressing them.\nAnyone know what could be going wrong?\n\nA: Have you tried Change Keyboard Type in System Preferences -> Keyboard?\n\n\nA: To change the command, instead of double-clicking the entire line, simply highlight F14 and rename the command to whatever you decide (I changed it to the up arrow), then do the same for F15...\n", "Q: Best way to connect a MacBook Pro to a projector I recently purchased this projector that has HDMI, VGA, and S-video inputs. Also, I have one of the first versions of the MacBook Pro, from around 2007/8. Currently I have connected both devices vía VGA using the Apple DVI to VGA adapter. The thing is that even at 1440x900, I have trouble making out text.\nThis is an 1152x870 picture taken with iPhone:\n\nI was wondering if one of the Apple DVI to HDMI adapters will help to get a better image? Would a clone be okay?\n\nA: HDMI will provide a higher resolution. You don't need to use any sort of special 'Mac' or Apple produced cable for this -  DVI to HDMI cables are widely available and affordable from the Internet retailer of your choice. Just hook it up and you're good to go.\n(N.B. while HDMI is capable of carrying Audio as well as Video, the DVI output on your MBP does not output sound. If you'd like to connect your MacBook to the projector or some other external audio device, you'll need a separate, but again, quite standard, audio cable to do so.)\n\nA: The projector's specs indicate a native resolution of 800x600 pixels; it probably will accept a higher input resolution and is simply downscaling, which would result in blurry text.  Otherwise I'd agree on using DVI to HDMI, even if the output is only 800.\n", "Q: Can MS Outlook work with iCloud? Can I iCloud-sync my iPad 2, iPhone 4S and Outlook 2010? I haven't been successful getting iCloud to work with Outlook 2010 on my Windows 7 PC. My iPad 2 and iPhone 4S are iCloud synced. Is it hopeless to get all 3 together: iPhone, iPad and Outlook 2010?\nI get into iCloud on the PC, start the sync with Contacts and it fails. \nShould I just give up on PC/iCloud and just use iCloud for the 4S and iPad?\n\nA: You should be able to set this up by using these instructions. You need to make sure you have the iCloud Control Panel for Windows. I've set this up on numerous occasions and it's worked well. \n\nA: Matt's right, you need the Control Panel for Windows, but it's also worth adding CodeTwo Sync for iCloud to it. The Control Panel adds an additional account to Outlook and CodeTwo puts it all together by syncing the default profile with iCloud in real time.\n", "Q: Automator action to adjust volume on audio files I am looking for an Automator action (or an app with Automator support) that can adjust the volume on audio files (something like set to 150% of input file volume), preferably free.\n\nA: How about something like SoX (free/donationware). It's features page lists wide variety of volume/level effects, including:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Volume/level effects\n  \n*\n  \n*...\n  \n*...\n  \n*vol: Adjust audio volume\n  \n  \n\nAccording to the SoX documentation, the following should double the volume of input.wav and write it to output.wav (the value after the -v flag is a multiplier)\nsox -v 2.0 input.wav output.wav\nYou should be able to use this in an Automator workflow using the \"Run Shell Script\" action.\n", "Q: Is there a way to access the menubar icons using the keyboard? I know how to use the menu items using only the keyboard. Is there anyway I can access the icons in the top right as well?\n\nA: If you have \"Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys\" checked in System Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard tab\nCtrl + F8 moves the keyboard focus to the icons in the menubar\nIf you have \"Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys\" unchecked in System Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard tab\nCtrl + Fn + F8 moves the keyboard focus to the icons in the menubar\nAlthough the leftmost user-installed ones on my computer cannot be accessed, you can then use the cursor keys to move ← → and ↓ to bring up the menu associated with the icon.\nIn addition, Ctrl + F2 (or Ctrl + Fn +F2) moves keyboard focus to the menubar items.\n", "Q: How to export groups from an iCloud Address Book account using Automator? I’m using Mac OS X Lion with iCloud. My address book ‘lives’ on iCloud and I’ve gat a number of groups in the address book. \nUnder Snow Leopard I used Automator to export addresses from a group using the following actions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get Selected Address Book Groups (Get selected “groups”)\n\n*Get Contact Information (Export Format “Spreadsheet (tabs)” with all fields selected, and Add Labels checked)\n\n*New Text File (Save as: “addresses.txt”, where “Desktop”)\n\n\n– this worked like a charm, but since I got to use Lion, I only get the header filled with the labels, no addresses.\nAlthough I do have a workaround (i.e. selecting all cards of a group and using “people” instead of “groups” in the first action of the workflow), I run in other problems like the fact I can’'t export to the MAC Roman encoding but must use UTF-8. In that case the address lines are garbled with mysterious spurious characters.\nIs there a way to retrieve the individual contacts from a selection of Address Book groups in Automator, or is this a bug in Lion?\n\nA: Apparently, Lion’s Automator actions are a bit more finicky about implicit data conversion between actions than Snow Leopard’s. In your case, the issue is the “Get Contact Information” action does not perform a conversion from groups into their contained  contacts. This can be solved quite easily by inserting a “Get Selected Address Book Items” action set to “people” after the first one (which retrieves the selected groups) before the “New Text File” action. This will allow you to select groups in Address Book instead of having to select all their constituent members.\nAs to the encoding issue, that does not seem to have anything to do with the Automator workflow: testing with my iCloud address book (German, with lots of Czech and French contacts) neither your nor my variant produce any issues writing UTF-8 text as long as the “New Text File” action’s file format is set to “text (.txt, convert if necessary)”. If the issue persists on your system when using these settings, possible causes I can think of are\n\n\n*\n\n*TextEdit (or your editor of choice) is set to display the file as another encoding than UTF-8; in that case, it would mangle them on display.\n\n*your address book might contain differently encoded characters, possibly from importing from older systems: Address Book is very good at hiding these, but they can cause a number of odd issues. There are a number of utilities out there claiming to fix broken Address Book records, but I have never tested them – YMMV.\n\n", "Q: Is it legal to install one copy of Final Cut Pro X on six different Macs owned by six different people? I am wondering if it is legal and/or possible to buy a copy of Final Cut Pro X and then share the disk and the cost with five other people?\n\nA: No. This would violate the license agreement between you and Apple when you purchase the software.\nSecond, there is no such thing as an installation DVD for Final Cut Pro X. You would have to purchase it as a download and install and register it through the Mac App Store, and I don't think you would be able to use your single Mac App Store log-in account on six computers owned by six different people who are not family members of yours.\n\nA: Kinda tricky to answer, because questions of legality are highly dependent on your location.  Of course, it's entirely possible that you live in Afghanistan or a small and hitherto unknown spit of land in the middle of a vast ocean without any recognised legal system, or perhaps you roam the skies forever outside the jurisdiction of any sovreign state, occassionaly touching down in airports around the world to wash your underwear in the restrooms, but I'm going to go out on a limb and imagine that you live in, and are therefore bound by the laws of, The U S of A.

As it said, i recently got a new apple mac and I want to backup my old iPhone onto it because i have a new iPhone 4S which i would like to get up and running.\nI have all of my music and photos onto an external hard drive but i don't really want to loose my contacts, messages, apps, calendar entries etc.\nIs it possible? Or will i just have to write everything down and re-enter it?\nThankyou :)\n\nA: All you need to do is plug in your iPhone 4 into the Mac, and depending on your setup, iTunes should start backing it up. The Mac isn't actually a requirement here, if you set up the iPhone 4 with iTunes on a PC, you can do the same there.\nWhen you get your iPhone 4S, and plug it into the computer, it will ask you if you would like to set up the phone as a new phone, or use a backup from a previous device, like the iPhone 4. Say yes - to use the backup - and it should set up the 4S just like your 4.\nWith iOS 5, iCloud actually will do part of this for you as well. If your iPhone 4 is already backing up to iCloud (instead of iTunes), when you set up iCloud on the 4S, it may ask you if you want to set it up using the previous backup. This is exactly how I migrated my wife's iPhone 4 to a 4S when she got it.\n\nA: If you have a spare PC, you can use the following tool to back up iPhone contacts to your PC in the form of *.vcf files. \nThen save the *.vcf files on an external drive such as a USB pen and transfer them to your Mac.\n", "Q: 3D movies or videogames from MacBook Pro to 3D projector I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*a 3D projector with: HDMI, VGA, S-VIDEO\n\n*one of the first MacBook Pros, with a DVI port (with an ATI X1600)\n\n*DVI to HDMI cable (and a DVI to VGA)\n\n*Active glasses, not the red/green (anaglyph) ones\n\n\nI would like to be able to watch 3D movies being played on the MacBook and watched on the projector.\nQuestion is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the hardware I have enough? \n\n*If so, what software do I need and what video format (.mp4, .mkv, etc.)?\n\n\nI downloaded the bino player but seems to be for the red/green kind of glasses.\n\nA: No - according to the specifications for that projector - they support set top boxes only and not computer playing DVD.\nThe player they provide runs on Windows and basically draws sequence of frames at double refresh rate so that each eye sees every other frame (they call it side by side) to create the illusion of a 3D scene. There is also reference to 60 Hz refresh rate for over/under (the side by side calls for 120 Hz refresh on the video source)\nYour mac can certainly run windows in emulation or in Boot Camp and make use of the provided software. It's not clear if there isn't Mac equivalent software or it's just not linked from this manufacturer's web page, but your display's Dual Link DVI horsepower is certainly fast enough to drive the display in question fast enough to meet the hardware requirements listed for 3D projection.\n", "Q: How to move files to trash from command line? I do a lot of terminal work, and today had the experience of typing\nrm fileInQuestion.txt\n\nBefore finding out that I did actually need fileInQuestion.txt. If I'd deleted in the GUI then I would have just gotten it out of the Trash. I'd like to know if it's possible to overload 'rm' in the Terminal in such a way that it sends the file/files to the Trash on the way out.\n\nA: a modern approach using swift\nhttps://github.com/reklis/recycle\n//\n// main.swift\n// recycle\n//\n// usage: recycle <files or directories to throw out>\n//\n\nimport Foundation\nimport AppKit\n\nvar args = NSProcessInfo.processInfo().arguments\nargs.removeAtIndex(0) // first item in list is the program itself\n\nvar w = NSWorkspace.sharedWorkspace()\nvar fm = NSFileManager.defaultManager()\n\nfor arg in args {\n    let path = arg.stringByStandardizingPath;\n    let file = path.lastPathComponent\n    let source = path.stringByDeletingLastPathComponent\n\n    w.performFileOperation(NSWorkspaceRecycleOperation,\n        source:source,\n        destination: \"\",\n        files: [file],\n        tag: nil)\n}\n\n\nA: I have an executable called rem somewhere in my $PATH with the following contents:\nEDIT: code below is a revised and improved version in collaboration with Dave Abrahams:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport subprocess\n\nif len(sys.argv) > 1:\n    files = []\n    for arg in sys.argv[1:]:\n        if os.path.exists(arg):\n            p = os.path.abspath(arg).replace('\\\\', '\\\\\\\\').replace('\"', '\\\\\"')\n            files.append('the POSIX file \"' + p + '\"')\n        else:\n            sys.stderr.write(\n                \"%s: %s: No such file or directory\\n\" % (sys.argv[0], arg))\n    if len(files) > 0:\n        cmd = ['osascript', '-e',\n               'tell app \"Finder\" to move {' + ', '.join(files) + '} to trash']\n        r = subprocess.call(cmd, stdout=open(os.devnull, 'w'))\n        sys.exit(r if len(files) == len(sys.argv[1:]) else 1)\nelse:\n    sys.stderr.write(\n        'usage: %s file(s)\\n'\n        '       move file(s) to Trash\\n' % os.path.basename(sys.argv[0]))\n    sys.exit(64) # matches what rm does on my system\n\nIt behaves in exactly the same way as deleting from the Finder.

The USP of this command is that enables to easily restore the files. A command to trash files/folders is no use if you can't restore files/folders after trashing them. From the command's website:\n\nBy default, trash asks Finder to move the specified files/folders to the trash instead of calling the system API to do this because of the \"put back\" feature that only works when trashing files through Finder.\n\n\n\n-F\nAsk Finder to move the files to the trash, instead of using the system API. This is slower, but it utilizes Finder's UI (e.g. sounds) and ensures that the \"put back\" feature works.\n-l\nList items currently in the trash. If this argument is used, no files need to be specified.\n-e\nEmpty the trash. trash asks for confirmation before executing this action. If this argument is used, no files need to be specified.\n\nTo install trash run the following in Terminal:\nbrew install trash.\n\n\n\n*rmtrash\nA command line tool that move files to the trash. From the command's man page:\n\nThis command moves files to the trash rather than removing them totally from the file system.  Very useful if you decide  you  want  that  file after all...\n\n\n\n-u USERNAME\nan optional argument.  This will move the file to the specified user's trash. Note that you need sufficient privileges to accomplish this.\n\nTo install rmtrash run the following in Terminal:\nbrew install rmtrash.\n\nA: This is an improvement to the answers given by Antony Smith and cde.\nThe problem with embedding a filename in a string that is passed to osascript via -e is that, on modern Unix-like systems, filenames can contain quotes, to the effect that parts of the filename could be run as AppleScript.\nA safer way to do this is to read the filename from an environment variable:\ntrash() (\n    : \"${1:?}\"\n    case $1 in\n        (/*) FNAME=\"$1\" ;;\n        (*)  FNAME=\"$(pwd)/$1\"\n    esac\n    export FNAME\n    exec osascript <<-EOF >/dev/null\n        set fName to system attribute \"FNAME\"\n        tell application \"Finder\" to delete my (POSIX file fName)\n    EOF\n)\n\n\nIf you add this function to your .bashrc or .zshrc, you can call trash from the command line. EDIT: Though turning this into a function that is actually useful requires more work, of course.\n\nA: Use the terminal command osascript, the AppleScript interpreter.\nosascript -e \"tell application \\\"Finder\\\" to delete POSIX file \\\"${PWD}/${InputFile}\\\"\"\n\nThis tells AppleScript to tell Finder to send the file to trash.\nPWD is needed for relative file paths, as AppleScript does not handle that well.\n\nA: The trash command line tool can be installed via brew install trash or port install trash.\nIt allows you to restore trashed files via command line or the Finder.\n\nA: I wouldn't advise aliasing rm to mv as you might get in the habit of rm not permanently deleting files and then run into issues on other computers or under other user accounts when it does permanently delete.\nI wrote a set of bash scripts that add more Mac OS X-like command line tools (in addition to a number of the built-in ones like open, pbcopy, pbpaste, etc.), most importantly trash. My version of trash will do all the correct things that aliasing rm won't (and hopefully nothing bad, but I've been using it on my own Macs for a few years now without any lost data), including: renaming the file like Finder does if a file with the same name already exists, putting files in the correct Trash folder on external volumes; it also has some added niceties, like: it attempts to use AppleScript when available so you get the nice trash sound and such (but doesn't require it so you can still use it via SSH when no user is logged in), it can give you Trash size across all volumes.\nYou can grab my tools-osx suite from my site or the latest and greatest version from the GitHub repository.\nThere's also a trash command developed by Ali Rantakari, but I haven't tested that one myself.\n\nA: While it is possible to make rm move files to Trash instead of removing them, I would advise against bringing the mindset of the safety net of graphical user interfaces to the UNIX shell. There are many ways to do serious damage using the terminal. The best advise IMHO is to simply think twice before hitting the enter key in a shell window.\nIf you want rm to remind you that you are about to delete a file consider using the following alias (for /bin/bash put this line in .bashrc in your home directory):\nalias rm \"rm -i\"\n\nThis will make rm request confirmation before attempting to remove each file.\nIf you have TimeMachine running (I hope so!) you can always get your file from backup. This way you can lose at most one hour of work. Which is bad enough, of course. So think again before pressing that enter key!\n\nA: Properly trashing stuff (so that it is definitely recoverable) is trickier than simply a mv to ~/.Trash. \nosx-trash might be what you're looking for.

It works cross-platform, no trash sound, and supports Put Back.\nYou can install it with (requires Node.js):\n$ npm install --global trash-cli\n\nAlternatively, if you don't want to use Node.js, you can install the native binary osx-trash manually.\n\nA: A simple function could let you trash files by moving them to the user's .Trash folder: \ntrash() {\n   mv $1 ~/.Trash\n}\n\n\nA: In your .bashrc (or wherever you keep the parameters for your shell), try adding an alias that changes the behaviour of rm to moving stuff to ~/.Trash, as in:\nalias rm='move/to/.Trash'\n\nThis alias if far from trivial to implement (at least for me) though, because the use of mv (the prime candidate to use for this job) is\nmv file where\n\nso having an alias that puts the 'where' part in front of the file to be moved might be pretty sketchy.

In System Preferences/Language & Text/Input Sources I have activated the \"Allow different input source for each document\" option. Incidentally, I also have English as the top language in System Pereferences/Language & Text/Languages, even though that is not relevant to this particular problem. I also have Input Menu enabled at login window and experience no problems with that.\nHowever, when launching a new window or application, I can never be sure what language I will start typing in. That's very inconvenient, especially in full-screen apps/windows/modes. I have been unable to determine a consistent pattern of when and why the input source changes or whether it even consistently \"sticks\" to the an application or window.\nExtensive googling and searching through existing q&a here yielded no satisfactory answers. Most confuse the question with the language selection. I have once stumbled on a tip saying that if you press-and-hold the input source switch keyboard shortcut (⌘-space in my case), you will get a visual switch cue (which is true), and that the default will \"stick\" to the value at which you release the keys (which I couldn't prove is working, at least for me, also default for what? current window?)\nSo the question is - how do I set a systemwide default input source, which will be applied to every new invoked application and its windows?\n\nA: To expand on Han's answer, here is the excerpt from the article Managing input methods in OS X\n\nTo change your default input method in OS X and avoid having to make\n  these adjustments for each application and document you open, you\n  first have to be sure the setting to allow a different input source\n  for each document is disabled. To do this, go to the Input Sources\n  system preferences and select the option to \"Use the same one in all\n  documents.\" With this setting in place, go to the input menu and\n  select the desired method you would like to have as your primary input\n  source. After this is done, you can go back to allowing a different\n  input source for each document, and any newly opened documents and\n  applications will now use the desired primary input method, until you\n  manually change it for that document.\n\n\nA: I asked Seth from CNET about this, and he replied me this article (Managing input methods in OS X, I'm reading it, wish it will help us!!

I understand that PDF reader in iPad can be a security loophole for virus to get through; but beyond that, how easy ( or hard, or even possible ) is for a virus to sneak through iPad safari browser? Any well publicized exploit concerning it?\n\nA: Presently there aren't any known Viruses for iOS. The security exploit that you mentioned, the PDF exploit and the TIFF image exploit before it, were patched shortly after the exploit was made public.\nIs it impossible for a virus to sneak through? Absolutely not, though if you're running the most recent iOS release the chances you'll get a virus or have your iOS device be exploited are extremely unlikely. There's a large community of people who actively seek exploits for non-malicious reasons (Jailbreaking), and Apple is always quick to patch the security hole.\nAs a rule of thumb, for iOS and other operating systems, keep your device up to date via the built in update mechanisms and you're exposure to security vulnerabilities will be quite low. In fact, the most recent iOS update 5.1.1 included a URL-spoofing security update. Though this isn't a virus, it's an example of the cat-and-mouse game that Apple and the security community continually play.\n", "Q: Fast External DNS Servers and My Intranet The local DNS servers, where I work, stink.  They're absurdly slow and often completely fail to resolve web domains during certain periods of heavy sunspot activity.\nIn response, I've just added Google's DNS server to my Network configuration.  This totally solves the speed problem, but also generates a problem with the intranet.  Whenever Google's sever is ordered above the local DNS, I can't resolve anything on the intranet.\nI always assumed OS X would just go down the list if it couldn't find a DNS on the first server, but apparently it isn't.  I have to go in and manually re-order the local server to the top (ahead of Google's) in order to resolve the intranet.\nIs there any way around this?  Have I set something up incorrectly?\n\nA: Stub resolvers only try a different DNS server in the list of available servers if they fail to get a response after trying one server. If they do get a response, then they don't go down the list querying other servers just to make sure the other servers agree with this response. (And if they found conflicting responses, which one should they trust?) So it's normal that when Google's DNS server claims your intranet host doesn't exist, it doesn't check any other servers to make sure.\nWhat you would need to do if your local resolvers are garbage is provide one or more alternative servers that do the same job and use those. Basically: reimplement the slow servers except... not slow.\nYou will need a list of all domains that belong to your intranet, and the corresponding authoritative nameserver set that serves each one. The problem is that your IT department may not furnish you with this list and it may receive additions and changes over time, so you will need to constantly maintain it up to date. Your IT department maintains this list in the resolvers that it provides, but they may not support a third party maintaining another copy in their own resolver.\nYou will need a caching DNS server such as bin or unbound. I would normally recommend unbound for this, but if you want to run the software on your local machine you will find bind easier because it comes preinstalled on MacOS. If you run it on your local machine then you can configure 127.0.0.1 as your resolver.\nSet up each of the intranet domains as a \"forward\" zone, and set the forwarders to the authoritative nameservers for that domain. For both BIND and Unbound, you can use mostly the default config, with additions of one forward zone for each intranet domain. For BIND:\nzone \"yourdomain\" {\n    type forward;\n    forwarders ip.add.ress ip.add.ress;\n}\n\nFor unbound:\nforward-zone:\n    name: \"yourdomain\"\n    forward-addr: ip.add.ress\n    forward-addr: ip.add.ress\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to change text size & formatting of Numbers' formula input field?

How do I change the settings for the MacBook Pro's built-in webcam?  \n\nA: According to this Apple discussion forum post:\n\nAs you know, software always controls your iSight. Most apps,\nincluding all Apple apps of which I am aware, automatically make the\niSight settings for you and do NOT allow you to manipulate them from\nwithin the application.\nIn my own case, I have found that merely adding more light to my work\nroom has allowed the automatic settings to give me adequate iSight\nimages.\nHowever, if you want to take manual control, the iGlasses2 add-on\nlets you manipulate many of the features that iSight (and many other\ncompatible webcams) offer. Note that iGlasses2 may not work with\nevery applications that can work with your camera.\nYou can get iGlasses2 here: http://www.ecamm.com/mac/iglasses/\n\nThis Apple KB also offers some troubleshooting guidance:\n\nImportant: Follow these instructions in order. Test the camera\nbetween steps to see if the issue is resolved.\nBuilt-in iSight cameras These steps are for iSight cameras that are\nbuilt into a computer, such as the iMac G5 (iSight) or later, the\nMacBook, or MacBook Pro.\n\n*\n\n*See if the issue is application-specific. Try another application (iSight works with applications like iChat, PhotoBooth,\nand iMovie HD 6) to see if the iSight camera exhibits the same\nbehavior in all applications. If it only happens in one application,\ntry reinstalling that application.\n\n*See if the issue is user-specific. Test your iSight camera in another user account. If the issue only occurs in one user, the issue\nwould be isolated to user settings.\n\n*Find out if the computer recognizes the iSight Check System Profiler (in the Utilities folder, inside the Applications folder).\nUnder the USB header, check to see if the iSight camera is detected.\n\n*Reset SMC or PMU Reset your computer's SMC or PMU, and then check System Profiler again. (SMC reset instructions for iMac G5\n(iSight), Intel-based iMacs; PMU reset instructions for MacBook and\nMacBook Pro.)\n\nIf your built-in iSight camera is still not behaving correctly after\ntrying all these steps, you may need to contact Apple or an\nApple-Authorized Service Provider for service.\n\nIn short, you can try adding an app to offer access to the controls or do a bit of troubleshooting on you MBP to confirm if this issue occurs on other applications or for other users.

I am unable to ping outside of my mac from the Terminal, and yet the internet connection (as seen from Safari) is otherwise just fine.\nWhere do I start to debug this issue?\n\nA: Your Mac is probably behind a proxy.  This article explains how to configure proxy settings on your Mac.  If you are behind a proxy, then you probably will not be able to get ping to work.\nOtherwise, the first step to troubleshooting a connectivity issue when Safari is working is to use traceroute to some well-maintained destination.  I typically use google.com.  \ntraceroute google.com\n\nIf you get the error unknown host google.com then you have a DNS problem.  Otherwise traceroute should provide you with information that helps you pinpoint the problem.\n\nA: I recently dealt with a similar issue you its possible that something is blocking your ping requests.

Lets say the WiF network uses LDAP to authenticate users with a user and password and the  users login to the OS using the same LDAP credentials. Is there a way that this WiFi connection can be always connected, even when no one is logged in after powering on?\nIdeally, we can float around a Macbook Air that is always connected to this wifi connection (using LDAP, not traditional WPA etc.) which would allow anyone to login using their LDAP username and password.\nIts sort of a chicken and egg scenario and it would be a lot easier if Lion simply allowed you to connect to a new WiFi network when at the login screen.\n\nA: I figured this out! Lion now supports configuration profiles. These can be used to specify default settings and payloads like VPN, WiFi Authentication, Permissions etc. \nThe config files are written in XML and can be created in Lion Server's Profile Manager.\n", "Q: Western Digital external hard drive is constantly ejected I have a 1TB Western Digital external hard drive that I use for Time Machine backups, and recently my iMac has started to randomly eject the hard drive, preventing backups. It tends to happen while the display goes to sleep, but I have my Energy Saver settings set to not put the hard drives to sleep, and the computer is set to never go to sleep.\nTo correct the issue, I pull the USB cable on the drive and then re-attach it. I'm wondering if this is just a bad drive that I need to return or if this is some kind of larger issue.\n\nA: Someone reported a similar issue on an Apple discussion forum:\n\nI tried that but the drive will still eject itself randomly at times.\nI contacted Western Digital about this and they say it might be a\nproblem with my USB cord. So they're going to send me a new one.\nHas\nanyone else had this problem and found that it was due to a faulty USB\n3.0 (compatible with USB 2.0) cord?\n\nAnother poster in the same thread commented:\n\nSounds like disk is on the way out. I would move or backup all data on\nit.\n\nYou should first back up that drive before anything else. Contact WD to see if they can send you a new USB cord. It's a good idea to run some diagnostics on the drive to confirm that there are no disk errors. Testing on another computer would also be a good idea to narrow down to see if the issue is isolated to your machine or the drive.\nIf the drive is failing, you'll need to return/exchange it.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with a 1TB 2.5\" WD USB drive. It started to get randomly ejected while the MacBook was writing to it. Drive diagnostics didn't show any problems, reconnecting the drive didn't help.\nThe simple solution was a reboot of the MacBook. (It hasn't been rebooted for about 2 months).\n\nA: Customer Reviews: Western Digital 1TB My Book for Mac - Apple Store (U.S.) include some comments that are thought-provoking. \nIf Western Digital software is installed, try uninstalling. \nIf you can, use the Western Digital web site to see whether the firmware for your drive is current. \n(Western Digital's link to My Book Essential no longer works.)\n\nOther Stack Exchange questions that involve Western Digital connectivity include: \n\n\n*\n\n*External HD doesn't mount when USB plugged in (Lion)\n\nA: I've hit this problem multiple times, invariably when I am writing large amounts of data to the drive (Time Machine, Retrospect, or Carbon Copy Cloner backups).  Once it starts happening, it seems to keep happening, and only formatting the drive fixes the problem, and even then it seems to reoccur.\nI have just tried using Disk Utility’s Erase Free Disk Space, and that seems to correct the problem, which is odd, but so far I haven't had a reoccurrence with the afflicted disks once I did this, so crossing fingers, hopefully this helps for real.\n\nA: I had this same problem and it seems that the drive may have been underpowered. I may be wrong, but I got a powered USB hub and a new surge protector and everything worked out. \n", "Q: Developer setup install script, with Homebrew & Dropbox? Installing development tools is not too hard these days, with the likes of Homebrew - http://brew.sh ...

I know that keeping the battery of a MacBook Air in a hot environment is a bad idea. But sometimes I have to leave it in a hot car. Are there any recommendations as to what to do in this kind of scenario?\nI'll usually close the lid, which puts it into sleep mode, but I just realized that the battery is probably still being used in that case; and using a battery while it's hot is worse than storing the battery in a hot environment. Is this right? And would the recommendation then be to shut off the computer? What other things are recommended?\n\nAccording to Apple's webpage:\n\nHot Tip\n  If you use your iPod, iPhone, iPad, or notebook in temperatures higher than 95° F (or 35° C), you may permanently damage your battery’s capacity. That is, your battery won’t power your device as long on any given charge. You may damage it even more if you charge the device in these temperatures. Even storing a battery in a hot environment can damage it irreversibly.\n\nNotice the relationship for bad things to do with a hot battery:\n\nStoring < Using < Charging\n\nIn other words, the worst thing to do is to charge the device at a hot temperature. Then comes using it, followed by storing it (i.e. storing the battery is the least damaging thing you can do).\nSo the question is when the device is sleeping in a hot car, is the battery usage (i.e. to keep the RAM data) significant enough that I should be shutting down the computer rather than sleeping it?\n\nA: Putting a computer in a hot car is a bad idea. The additional heat, generated by a sleeping MacBook is almost zero.\nIf you have to leave your computer in the car, and temperatures are (or will reach) near the storage limits (45°C/113°F) you should leave it in an thicker or insulated bag, that will protect the computer from the heat. Avoid direct sunlight at all cost.\n\nA: According to the tech specs, you should not store your MacBook Air in temperatures over 45° C or 113° F. While we can assume Apple's specs are a bit conservative (better safe than sorry), doing so might risk damaging your computer, or reducing its lifetime. Note that temperatures inside a car in the sun on a hot day may rise well above 60° C / 140° F.\nBeing in sleep mode vs. being completely shut down would not make any significant difference, as the battery discharge is neglectible, and while in sleep mode no considerable additional heat is produced by the computer.\nThe only proper advice I can give you is not leaving your computer in a hot car.\n\nA: When your machine is sleeping, it is still discharging the battery, albeit much more slowly.   In this state, the system state is still in RAM, and that means power from the battery is being used to maintain it in RAM.  On Windows, it is possible to \"hibernate,\" which stores system state to disk and fully powers down, thus virtually eliminating battery discharge.  On Mac OS, you can change to a Sleep mode to simulate \"hibernation\" such that your system state is written to disk and no power is used to maintain state in RAM; see this thread over on Super User.  \n", "Q: iPad and iPhone can sync with each other on Notes -- how about adding info on the Mac or PC? Right now the iPad and iPhone can sync with each other for any Notes added or edited, so one note added on the iPad will go to the iPhone automatically, and I think this is done by sync'ing with the Gmail account.  How about when using the Mac, if there is additional info, is there a way to add it to the note on the Mac (or on PC)?\n\nA: In Lion, iPad and iPhone notes that are synced through your mail account can be accessed and edited in Apple's Mail app.\n", "Q: What should i do when pIctures on my iphone are not rotating when i rotate the device,?

SoundFlower can let us play the system's audio to the SoundFlower 2 channel and record with this SoundFlower 2 channel, so QuickTime on Mac OS X Lion and record exactly what the system is playing for a game play.\nAnd it works for 16 channels as well.\nBut is it true that while we can record the sound, we can't hear it?  So if we are playing a game and we are recording the video/sound, then we can't hear it.  I just wanted to set it up to record the ending credit and the song, but if it needs to be played without sound, then that's somewhat a problem too.\n\nA: No. You can still hear the sound by creating a new audio device in Audio MIDI Setup. Go to the SoundFlower menu and click \"Audio Setup\". Audio MIDI Setup should popup up. Create a new multi-output device (click the + in the bottom left hand corner). Then set the settings as pictured below:\n\nThis will allow you to capture the system sound and still hear it through your speakers/headphones.\n\nA: When you install Soundflower, you should also have an application named \"Soundflowerbed\" located in Applications > Soundflower.\n\nWhen you launch it it opens only into your menu bar.\n\nClicking it reveals a menu that is used to route the output to another device of your choosing.\n\nSelecting Built-In Output, or the output device of your choosing, will allow you to monitor the audio Soundflower is capturing.\n\nA: I own a MacBook with Retina Display.  The process is a little difficult, but you do need to follow the 2 other instructions listed here, about Soundflowerbed & Audio MIDI Setup.\nThe 3rd & Final Step for me was to go to SYSTEM PREFERENCES > SOUND ...\n1) Under the OUTPUT tab, select \"Multi-Output Device\"\n2) Under the INPUT tab, select \"Soundflower 2ch\"\nNow I can record audio/video while using my headphones; although the volume cannot be controlled via the computer & when recording sound the volume is a bit low.  But once I revert back the Input/Output options under SYSTEM PREFERENCES > SOUND, the audio is back to its proper volume.\n\nA: I think you'll also need Jack http://jackaudio.org.\nDo the following mappings: as mentioned create a Multidevice with the Soundflower 16 and the built in audio.\nNext select soundflower 16 as the device for audio output in System Preferences. (Sys. Audio is Routed to Soundflouwer Input 1/2)\nIf you wana here your Game play select Bultin Output in Soundflower Menu (the one below the 16Channel green/yellow)\nNow start Jack (it take a few moments) when its running creat the following routing Soundflower Input 1 to Soundflower Output 1 + 3 and Input 2 to Output 2 + 4.\nIn your Recording Software (i recommend Audacity for Audio) you can now select Soundflower 3/4 as Input.\n", "Q: Why aren't my songs from iTunes actually syncing to my iPod? I just put a bunch of songs on my iPod, and most of them worked. But now there’s two more that I need to download and when I drag and drop the files to the \"Music\" section of my iPod, the songs show up there, but they have that symbol next to them that suggests they are still syncing, and they are gray. But it's been like that for like three hours. So I know they are not actually syncing. Why is it doing this and how can I fix it?\n\nA: You can also uncheck the songs in iTunes, sync with whatever device you are using, then recheck the songs in iTunes and sync again.  Worked for me.\n\nA: Some media cannot be played by the iPod even if the format is already AAC (.m4a in Finder). I've experienced this with media that was not directly purchased in the iTunes store. This broke the syncing and I ended up calling  Apple Care Support.\nWhat worked in the end was to convert all songs that were not purchased directly in iTunes to AAC using iTunes (right-click menu).\nThen update your lists and try to sync them to the iPod again.\n\nYou really need to make sure that you have the right songs in the lists. Because I now had two AAC versions of the same song, I had to make sure that I only keep the version that iTunes created:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the song\n\n*Press ⌘+I (Get Info)\n\n*Go to the tab summary and confirm that Encoded with says iTunes 10.X\n\n\nA: I had the same problem. It was because my iPod was synced to a library on a different computer. I had to resync with my current computer. The iPod will only sync with one iTunes library. In iTunes, select your iPod and synchronize.\n\nA: I was with apple support for probably 20 minutes on the phone and even screen sharing. She had me uninstall all itunes and apple first, restart my computer and reinstall. So that might be part 1. Part 2 was that in the music section when your ipod is connected, there is a button that says sync music and gives you the option of selecting the whole library or only checked albums, artists etc. I had to hit that sync button instead of the one that pops up when you connect the ipod. That worked with me so just dicking around solved the problem. If anything make an apt. with the apple store.\n", "Q: Is there a way to filter or sort my iOS Apps by Account which was used to purchase them? Related to this question:\nI have used several accounts to purchase/get for free a lot of iOS Apps. I'd like to sort them by account that was used to purchase them, since clicking through all those Apps with the Information Window is infeasible.\nThe problem I really want to solve is the following:\nSometimes, there are updates for apps purchased from other country stores (other accounts) - these show up in iTunes, but only as nonzero number next to the Apps Category.\nE.g.: Today, if I use my main account (Austria) then I see no update notifications, but when I use my US account there is the number 3 next to the Apps category. I just want to find out what all the accounts are that I might need to check. (Yes, there are some that might have slipped my mind)\n\nA: I've multiple accounts as well. I'd like to use free US apps as well that they don't provide on my countries App Store. Neat trick.\nAnyway. Unfortunately there isn't a sort option existing in iTunes like the one you've asked since Apple won't care about our situation in general. Most users will only have a single account.\nAlso there isn't a third-party app for that.\nSo we're stuck with changing accounts all the time. But one advice that I can give you is that check some of those apps that you've downloaded with your US account in Austria store. Maybe those developers placed theirs apps in Austria store as well as of now. Deleting the old one and re-downloading it will keep your app library more organized.\n\nA: With your apps in the main iTunes window (this still works with multiple windows but only if the apps list is in the original iTunes window), Get Info and then press ⌘+N which will cycle you through to the Get Info for the next app in the list. I basically stared at the account information and pressed ⌘+N multiple times and tried not to blink. When the account info changes, press ⌘+P slowly to get back to it. (⌘+N & ⌘+P are the keyboard shortcuts for Next and Previous, the buttons shown in the Get Info pane.)\n\nIf that's too lame for you, then you can try hacking together a script. A few years back, I downloaded an AppleScript or Automator workflow that gave me a text file list of all my apps and the account used to purchase each one. I've searched my computer and the web for the original to no avail. I do remember that I had to tweak the script to get that data, but in the absence of the original file, I am unable to reconstruct it.\nIt is possible to get all of the Get Info window data via Automator. If you want to try yourself, you can download an iTunes script that outputs your music file data and start tweaking it yourself to get what you want.\nGoogle can answer most of your questions on how to do that if you have the patience.\n", "Q: 3D modeling application for Mac? Background: I recently upgraded my Mac, and it happens to have a pretty nice graphics card (not that my old one wasn't nice ... in 2006). While I didn't upgrade my Mac for this purpose, it has occurred to me that my life might be a tiny bit more efficient if I used some of this amazing graphics power that I now possess (and perhaps my old Wacom tablet) for sketching 3D designs, rather than my current method*.\nSo I hopped on over to the Mac App Store, typed in \"3d modeling\" (and every synonym I could think of), and was disappointed to see a pretty slim selection of apps.\nIs there a good basic app for creating 3D objects?  Free is good, cheap is also good -- I don't mind paying but \"3D modeling\" frequently seems to mean \"here's a $10,000 program that lets you make Lord of the Rings\", and I'm sure it's amazing for that, but I don't need that.\nI need: ability to create simple objects, mostly square or circular, including CSG, and to move them around and look at them from different angles.\nI don't need: any particular file formats, or textures, or animation, or smooth organic surfaces like human faces.\nIf you think \"designing a chest of drawers\", that's about the level of sophistication that I'm looking for.  What TextEdit.app is for words, I want for 3D objects.\nSketchUp is almost what I'm looking for, except it's kind of awkward and not entirely Mac-like, and to do any CSG you need the $500 \"Pro\" version (which I might get eventually, but it seems like there could well be something better and cheaper).\nI'd almost be happy with something like POVRAY: the CSG is nice, the price can't be beat, but unfortunately it lacks any interactivity.\n* (It involves whiteboards, paperboard and glue, and listening to old Yes albums while trying to visualize how things will fit together in space.)\n\nA: Have you tried Blender?\n\nA: My personal favourite is Maxon Cinema 4D. It has a nice learning curve, is fairly respected in the industry and does what you require very well (simple objects). It has a slightly Adobe-like feel to it. I found that for complex organic modelling you'd need to start looking at Maya or 3DS Max (PC on Bootcamp).\nHowever, these options cost quite a lot - though C4D is less than many applications and is modular.\nA cheaper ($99) option is Cheetah, available through the app store. Basic but nice.\nAs Nix said, Blender is a fantastic, free option. I just found the learning curve is a little more tricky than C4D.\n\nA: AutoDesk makes a Mac version of Maya. I'm partial to Maya as I learned 3D on it. If you're a student, you can get an educational discount, which is how I got it about 4 years ago.\nhttp://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-maya/free-trial\nAs others mentioned, there is also Blender which is free. I tried it but it there is a bit of a learning curve as matt_w mentioned. \n\nA: Here's a pretty big list, with, presumably, all the info you might need. A description, the price, the requirements, and links to the Downloads page.\n\nA: A few years ago (2009) I compared the input and output formats available on a few 3D model apps.  Here is my list:\nJavaview\n  opens:  byu, jvx, obj\n  exports: byu, fe, {jvd, jvx}, mgs, mpl, obj, off, stl, wrl\nGeo3D\n  opens: wrl {including ver 1}, 3ds, obj, 3dmf\n  exports: 3dmf\nFbxConverter:\n  opens: fbx\n  exports: dxf, obj, 3ds\nFreeWRL\n  opens: x3d, wrl\nInstant Player\n  opens: x3d, wrl, [Instant Player Engine], [OpenSG Scene]\nMaple\n  opens: mpl\n  exports: x3d, dae, pov, dxf\n\nA: I think you should have another look at SketchUp.\nIt's 'Mac-like' quality (on the Mac platform) has improved a bit and, I'm not sure I understand your CSG needs, but I would guess the increasing number of plug-ins now available makes it one of the best tools around. I can't think of anything better and cheaper.\nI teach architecture and many of my students use the free SketchUp version in combination with Render[in], Artlantis or the new Maxwell Render for SketchUp plugin.\n\nA: Take a look at Shade 3D. You can get Shade 3D for Unity for free, and Shade 3D Basic is only $99. It has modeling, rendering and a lot of features you may not need now, but may decide you want later. Plus, its easy to get started with.\n\nA: I would recommend 'Hexagon' from Daz3D, which they offer for free and it meets all your requirements.\n\nA: My personal recomendation is SCULPTRIS\nhttp://www.pixologic.com/sculptris/\nFree, simple, easy but powerfull.\nONLY use it for modeling ORGANIC models, i doesn's work with geometric or square models, remember, only organic.\nLater its perfect complement is ZBRUSH for amazing modeling from sculptris and\ngreat painting tools.\n\nA: I would recommend Verto Studio 3D. It is on the Mac App Store \n", "Q: How do I restrict Internet access while still being able to make calls/receive messages? Is there any way I can restrict my iphone from using the internet? Basically all apps should be blocked from using the internet, in one go, but I should still have the provision to make/receive phonecalls/messages.\n\nA: Turn off Wi-Fi (in Settings > Wi-Fi), and turn off Mobile Data (in Settings > General > Network).\nThis will keep the phone off the internet, but still allow phone calls and texts. (iMessage and MMS won't work, however).\n", "Q: What is the Aliases pane in Sparrow? I've just installed Sparrow on my brand new iMac. I found the Aliases pane in Sparrow:\n\nI've Googled it and found some source say it similars to Shortcut in windows. \nWhat the Aliases pane for?   \nPlease help guys!\n\nA: No this is not a file alias (which is the same as a shortcut in windows) but an email alias. An email alias is an additional email address for an existing account.\nYou create an account with an address email@example.com and then a series of additional address for the very same account (the aliases).\nYou will have\n\n\n*\n\n*one account\n\n*several addresses\n\n\nIt is the same principle as shortcuts and aliases for files but in another context.\n", "Q: This symbol has a square in the middle, triangles on the sides, and arrows in the corners. What does it mean? My Apple Remote was not working with my iMac which is running 10.7.4. \nWhen I attempted to pair the remote to the computer, by holding down the menu and the next track buttons, the following symbol appears in the center of my screen.\n\nAfter resetting the SMC, the Apple remote is working as usual. In particular, holding down the menu and the next track buttons displays the \"linked chain\" icon, indicating that the remote has been paired to the computer.\nBut I am still curious, what does the image mean?\n\nA: Since no-one has a good guess, here is how I would try to track it down.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off Time Machine\n\n*Reboot the mac\n\n*open terminal\n\n*run this command sudo fs_usage -w\n\n*let fs_usage run for a bit and make sure all disk access is to a minimum,\n\n*repeat the steps to make that icon appear - noting the time to the second\n\n*press ⌃-C to kill the fs_usage dump and scroll back to see what application or files were being read when the icon appeared.\n\n\nA: Posting a guess in case it helps someone else figure out the answer.\nI've now looked at nearly every icon on my Lion MacBook Pro, and a lot of the PNG's too. I have found most of what I expected to find but still not this symbol.\nMy guess is that your icon is related to the iMac going into or coming out of target display mode.  Perhaps it was trying to go into target display mode but you didn't have anything connected and this was how it was complaining about there being no signal. It is a known problem with iMacs that they can erratically go into target display mode when the SMC is having problems.\nSo far, the closest I have found is\n \nwhich is obviously different, but close.  It is for changing a slide show to fit-to-screen mode.\n"]
