["Q: Why does only Safari have (nearly) perfect inertial scrolling in OS X? I'm quite amazed that Safari is the only browser in OS X that manages to get (nearly) perfect inertial scrolling.\n\n*\n\n*Even with lots of flash content on a website, Safari's scrolling is smooth.\n\n*There are websites with lots of content to load and Safari will continue to scroll smoothly while the content is being loaded and rendered.\n\n*Installing several extensions does not have an effect on the scrolling performance.\n\nThe major competitors to the Safari browser on OS X are Chrome and Firefox. Both don't manage to deliver the same smooth scrolling like one is used to in Safari:\n\n*\n\n*Enabling flags like GPU compositing on all pages in Google Chrome (chrome://flags) or ...\n\n*smooth scrolling in Firefox (Options > Advanced) don't deliver the scrolling performance that Safari delivers per default.\n\nQuestion\nIs Safari using private API to deliver smooth scrolling that the Chrome/Firefox developers's can't access? How come Safari's scrolling is so much better and competitors don't manage to deliver non-broken scrolling.\nI'm wondering especially about Chrome because it usually adapts to new OS X features really fast.\n\nA: The difference is likely to do with the architecture and interprocess communication choices of each browser.\nModern web browsers render pages in separate processes. Apple has a framework called IOSurface that provides a streamlined way for one process to pass an image to another process. This framework was introduced in Mac OS X 10.6, aka Snow Leopard, for the latest iteration of QuickTime.\nQuickTime uses IOSurface to offload movie decoding to separate processes. With no decoding to do, the QuickTime Player application is left dealing solely with the user interface and showing images provided by the decoding processes.\nI suspect Safari has learned from QuickTime and is using the same techniques. Web pages are offloaded to other processes, rendered, and passed back.\nCould Chrome and Firefox do the same thing, absolutely. The challenge is ensuring the thread dealing with the user responds quickly and is not delayed waiting for the rendering to update.\nChrome does use separate processes and appears to use IOSurface on the Mac; this bug talks about improving Chrome's use of IOSurface.\nIOSurface is a public framework available to any Mac OS X 10.6+ application. However there is little documentation and it is Mac specific.\nThis is all conjecture.\n", "Q: What are the iPad gestures for the new Chrome app? I cannot find the documentation for them anywhere.\n\nA: Have found only these two:\n\n\n*\n\n*switching through open tabs: swipe from the edge of the screen\n\n*change order of tabs: long press on tab and move left/right\n\n", "Q: What can I do about frequent beach ball Safari and other apps? I very frequently get the beachball and occasionally the wristwatch (as in every minute or so if I'm using the machine multi app) as I use my Mac. This appears in all apps, especially Apple core apps. This most often happens in Safari, but can happen unpredictably in anything. It's not reliably reproducible, though doing almost anything in Safari will soon create it.\nUsually, it happens when either I or an app do something (vs it just sitting there). Neither cpu nor memory appear overloaded in Activity monitor when this happens, (though just occasionally cpu goes to 100%, and fan goes full.)\nSystem is MacBook Pro 2.7GHz Core i7, 4GB 1333 MHz DDR3 (factory spec) running OS X 10.7.4. One probably totally unrelated oddity is that the s/n of the machine never comes up on the Apple database, always apparently missing a digit in the middle. And yes, I bought it from Apple!\nSolution attempts: \nExtensive.\nMachine has been back to Apple, who replaced system board and hard drive.\nRepeated visits to Genii (Genius's?) who have spent much time deleting, and reinstalling individual apps, fiddling with plists, general fiddling, reinstalling the OS (Clean reinstalls - as in reformat HD).\nBut the problem comes back, every time.\nI'm not reinstalling any of my 3rd party software, as I can't bear the repeated process, but also so as to eliminate that possible source.\nI'm at the end of my tether, almost can't bear to use the machine (which is NOT how I want to feel about my Mac), and can't afford to replace this still very new machine.\nDiagnostic questions will be gratefully received. I would be delighted for any possible solutions.\n\nA: Once I got something similar after a Snow Leopard upgrade:  spinning bechball when starting Safari and making Safari inoperable. Turned out it was an incomaptible SIMBL plugin from before the OS upgrade.\nIf you already replaced the motherboard and hard drive, there's really not much \"hardware\" left that can be eliminated.\nIf you already have done a clean install as well, there is really no other \"software\" eliminated either. Make sure you've done a total clean install though: format HDD, install the base OS without iLife, etc, DO NOT restore anything from you backup afterwards, DO NOT use your regular username and DO NOT enter your Apple ID at first boot. Do not restore and data from your backup, especially not /Library and /Users//Library\nI guess I'd also try to install a different version of OSX (downgrade or upgrade, doesn't matter) and see if the problem persists.  Also try booting a different OS (Windows, Linux, boot from a Linux live CD/usb would be the easiest option). Booting in a different OS is the best way to find out if it's a hardware issue or software.\nGenerally a spinning beachball are caused by CPU/memory/disk access spikes, but it can also be some other kind of blocking I/O (e.g. network, USB). Maybe it's compatibility issues with your home network? Use it on a different network, try connecting to the network with an external USB ethernet adapter.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: You forgot to mention the HDD drive you're using.\nIf it's a non-factory SSD, it is likely to have some issue with your configuration.\nIt it's an HDD, it has pretty sure some hardware defects.\nPlease try booting your Mac from an external hard drive via USB (better: FireWire, as it is faster than USB-2):\n\n\n*\n\n*The external hard drive must have OSX installed on it, best way to create a bootable media is to clone your internal hard drive with Carbon Copy Cloner (free for 15 days) or SuperDuper (free for simple cloning)\n\n*Simply connect the external drive to your Mac and hold ALT before the grey apple appears.\n\n\nAlso let us know which type of HDD you're using.\n\nA: One easy and powerful way to test if your software setup is making trouble:\nCreate a new user. Log out from your normal account, then use some of the \"Apple core apps\" you mentioned for a while from the new account ... maybe ten to 30 minutes. You’ll know what to do to reproduce the rotating beach ball. \n\n\n*\n\n*If no beachballs: It’s a software / configuration problem within your (normal) user account.\n\n*If beachballs: Probably a hardware problem.\n\n\nI have used this technique several times to resolve head scratching Mac situations. Good luck!\n\nA: It has already been stated in the comments by @IconDaemon, this is probably a hardware-related case. You can reinstall OS X from the original media, login and start using your computer. If it starts failing, then it's not your fault, something is not functioning properly. \nAlso if the Serial Number doesn't come up, there's clearly another issue.\nI can recommend you one simple test, create a new user account, and use the machine a few hours from there. Surf the web, use FaceTime, etc. \nIf the problem persists, then you need to take it back to Apple as soon as possible and explain to them all you've done.\n", "Q: Can I transfer purchased content from an iPhone to an authorised PC Ok so on computer 1, I have setup my iPhone, authorised computer 1 and downloaded some content from iTunes, and put this onto my iPhone.\nI have just authorised computer 2, can I transfer the data on my iPhone to computer 2 or do I need to re-download everything?\nIt seems a bit of a waste having to re-download everything (a couple of gigabytes) when all of the content is already sitting right there on my iPhone.\nI'm not trying to do anything dodgy, just trying to transfer some purchased apps/music from a non-jailbroken iPhone to a properly authorised computer, why does Apple make this so difficult?\nThis is my first apple device so I am new to the whole apple ecosystem, can somebody help me carry out this simple task?\nThanks\n\nA: You can transfer purchases from your device to your computer.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Assure that you are signed into the AppleStore on the Computer\n\n*With the device plugged in via USB, Context-click (right-click) on the device and select \"Transfer Purchases\".\n\n\nFor more information and guided steps, please refer to this AppleSupport Article\n\nA: Phone to PC (or Phone to Mac) is some shareware that can be used for this, although the trial should be sufficient for your one time use need\n", "Q: Why does the Google Chrome icon appear like this in Applications? \nI am using OS X Lion 10.7.4.\nThe Google Chrome application seems to work fine and the icon appears normal the Dock and Launchpad. What does this error icon mean?\n\nA: I have not seen this happen and it is quite uncommon, but usually it means that the app hasn't fully loaded the icon from the dmg file to the memory. It could've been because you moved the app over very quickly or you must not have followed the standard procedure, which is Download app → Drag icon to Applications folder.\nEither way, it should fix itself on a reboot.

I would be grateful for your help.\n\nA: Detailed specs on Apple's processors for iOS devices are usually not mentioned. Mosty likely as Apple's focus is on a product's performance as a whole. Mere numbers for memory, cache and clocks don't reflect that.\nTherefore, even a professional blog such as AnandTech draws such information from running a GeekBench test:\nL2 Cache is 1MB and shared among both cores.\nBut note that these are not official numbers confirmed by Apple.\n\n[picture from AnandTech]\n", "Q: The headphone jack on my MacBook Pro just stopped working. How do I fix it? The headphone jack on my MacBook Pro stopped working. It was working fine, then just spontaneously stopped while I was using external speakers plugged into the output jack. Now, neither speakers nor 3 different headphones have sound. The internal speaker on my MacBook Pro still works.\n\nA: Try resetting PRAM.\nRestart your machine and hold down Command ⌘+Option ⌥+P+R all at the same time as soon as it turns on. Keep holding until it resets. \n\nA: I've had similar issues and restarting coreaudio work for me. Run this in a terminal (you might be prompted for your password).\nsudo pkill coreaudiod\n\nIf your curious sudo is something used to run commands as administrator (SU-DO as in super user do) and pkill sends signals to processes based on name, in this case coreaudiod, which is the name of the coreaudio daemon process. When it gets a terminate signal sent by pkill it will terminate and then macOS will restart it again. \n\nA: This happened to me yesterday. I tried three different headphones. \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Sound > Output.\n\n*Plug your headphones in if you haven't yet.\n\n*Look at the bottom where it says Output Volume and un-check the mute button.\n\n\nA: Let me tell how I solved my problem (that was: internal speakers worked whereas the headphones plugged in didn't):\n\n\n*\n\n*I plugged in the headphones.\n\n*I pressed the \"F10/Sound OnOff\" key on the keyboard\nThat was it! The headphones worked again.\nBut why? \nTo my understanding the reason is that Apple attaches the sound-on-or-off-state to the current output device.\nSo switching off the sound while having plugged in the headphones makes the headphones be silent. Plug them off and you will hear the internal speakers. Plug them in again (after a minute or after half a year) and they still will be silent. Because YOU switched off the sound OF THE HEADPHONES (some months ago).\n(It is the same the other way round. But in that case you probably would try the F10 button ...)\n(Note: you can see this behaviour also with the checked or unchecked mute button in System Preferences > Sound > Output, as mentioned in a post above. Its state depends on the selected output device.)  \n\nA: I had this same problem with my MacBook Pro 13\" (mid-2009) running OS 10.6.8. Somewhere on the internet I found the answer. After plugging in the headphones and looking at the System Preferences/Sound, you may not see (in theis model) the option for Headphones, only for Internal Speaker. (Of course, you must first check that the audio port is selected for output, since this Mac has only a single port audio. Also, that the mute is not selected.) \n   After seeing no Headphone option, put the Mac to sleep and wake it up again. Voila! Your headphones/external speakers will work.\nDoes anyone know what the permanent fix is for this problem?\n\nA: If you see red glowing light coming from it try the toothpick approach: take a toothpick and poke around in the jack until light turns off.\n\nA: I'm not sure if it's a hardware issue for you; if you go under System Preferences → Sound → Output, you should see Headphones as one of the output devices. Most likely the audio is being directed to some other output device (like Soundflower or Boom). Just make sure that Headphones is selected.\n\nA: In the sounds control panel with the sound output tab selected, be sure to have use audio port for output, rather than input... this was why mine was not working.\n\nA: Quote @mattias's answer. For people who are not familiar with the terminal, open activity monitor and search coreaudiod, then quit it.\n(why do we still have this bug in 2022?!)\n\nA: I've got a weird solution from here and I'm glad it worked for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your headphones into the audio socket.\n\n*From the apple icon menu in the top left corner of the os x screen, tell your computer to go to sleep.\n\n*Immediately wake it up again from sleep.\n\n", "Q: Switching Keyboard Layout on Macbook on Lion Is it still possible to switch from the default (Macbook UK) keyboard to the US layout in Lion?

I tried using a different charger and the MacBook charges fine. What might be the problem?\n\nA: I actually have the same problem but a different solution worked for me: \nThe problem only arose when I unplugged the charger from the MacBook (but not from the power supply) and plugged it back in. Unplugging the charger from the power supply for a moment solved the issue instantly.\n\nA: In my case, the problem was the temperature of the charger. Since it's currently winter in the southern hemisphere, removing the MacBook from charge causes the charger to cool down (since it apparently draws very little mains power when there is no load on the MacBook side). At some point when it is cool enough, it will refuse to supply power when the MacBook is plugged in again.\nThe workaround is to warm up the charger (for example, by sitting on it) for a few minutes until the charge light comes on. Then the current running through the charger is enough to keep it warm, and it continues charging.\nUpdate: A year later, after returning from being away for six weeks, my charger refused to work again even after sitting on it. Apple was happy to replace it under AppleCare.\n\nA: my mba would not charge at all.  i literally sat on my charger and warmed it up and now my mba charges-unbelievable.

I don’t think they’ve been able to boot from external USB 2 drives though.\nThe new MacBook Air (2012) has USB 3.0. Can it boot from an external USB 3 hard drive?\n(I know it also has Thunderbolt, and I assume it could boot from an external Thunderbolt hard drive, but you can get a 500 GB USB 3 external drive for £50: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Western-Digital-Elements-500GB-Portable/dp/B005A97A86).\n\nA: In some testing on a MacBook Pro with USB 3.0 and an earlier MacBook Pro with USB 2.0 (no USB 3.0) I've found\n\n\n*\n\n*Both will boot to an external disk (a clone of the internal drive) if the drive is in a USB 2.0 case.\n\n*The USB 3.0 external case drive can be read by both machines. It does support USB 3.0 on the newer MacBook Pro.\n\n*The USB 3.0 drive is clearly an option in System Preferences, Startup Disk, and I can select the drive just fine.\n\n*The USB 3.0 drive will NOT boot on the newer MacBook (but it boots fine on the earlier MacBook with only USB 2.0). In fact, when booting holding down the option key, even then the external USB 3.0 drive is not visible on the newer MacBook, but is visible on earlier MacBook.\n\n*Once the OS is fully up and running, the USB 3.0 disk shows up fine as a device in Finder, it works at USB 3.0 speed, etc.\nMy Conclusion:\nUSB 3.0 is NOT supported by the internal firmware in the newest MacBook Pro so it cannot boot to the drive, but the Operating System itself clearly adds the support for the USB 3.0 device once it is loaded.  \nUSB 3.0 is supported only in the operating system, and not in the firmware.\nThis makes the USB 3.0 support far less valuable, in my view, since booting to an external USB 3.0 device may be a very handy way to have a backup of the internal drive that can be used a reasonable speeds.\nAt this point, I have to put the external drive in a USB 2.0 enclosure. It boots, but offers absolutely no advantage on the newer MacBook with USB 3.0 support.\nPerhaps we'll see an updated firmware that solves this problem.\nMy current Boot Rom Version is:  MBP91.00D3.B08\nI looked here:  http://support.apple.com/downloads/#macnotebooks\nbut didn't find a description of this USB 3.0 boot issue (yet).\n\nA: Various generations of Macs have different capability booting from different external drives.  Before intel macs (2006), the external boot was generally supported on Firewire and not usb.  Since \"intel\", USB is supported as well as firewire.\nI am an experienced MacOSX user, and I have just experienced some issues with booting off of an external USB 3 drive.  I suspect it has to do with power saving feature of external drive (that uses battery power) that counts on smarter power control than is currently done during the usb 3 booting process.\nIn particular, I experience trouble booting from a 1.5t seagate goflex USB 3.0 portable drive on my 2012 macbook pro 9.2 using Macosx 10.7.4.   I think it is a driver / OSX version problem, but I haven't resolved the problem quite yet.\nYou have to have a \"good\" version of MacOSX that supports your model of Macintosh:  There are subtle things that can happen among recent 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8 sub configurations that sort of customize themselves for specific models of intel macintosh models and loose some capabilities of running all functions on all macintoshes (this is a very subtle issue).  (this is not \"supposed\" to happen, but it does.  This should be an issue of a different post, it's complicated in its own right).\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Yes, I just got a new Mid-2012 MacBook Pro 13\" and did this very thing over USB 3.0. I know of no reason why it would not work on a MacBook Air.\nWhen booting from an external spinning hard drive over USB 3.0 on my new MacBook Pro, the external hard drive sends data back and forth to the Mac about as fast as it would if it were installed internally. I have not specifically measured drive speeds in this scenario; I'm just saying that it performs quite well.\nAs far as I know, all Macs with USB have been capable of booting from an external drive connected via USB--all the way back to the first iMac circa 1998, which only made use of USB 1.0. Booting from an external USB 2.0 drive, whether a flash/thumb drive or a spinning hard drive, is, however, quite slow.\nWhen you boot your Mac, immediately after the startup chime, hold down the Option key. Your Mac will show you a row of icons of each volume or partition currently connected to the Mac (internally or externally) that holds a Mac OS X installation that you can successfully boot from. Use the arrow keys to select which one you want to boot from, and hit the Return key to boot from that volume.\n\nA: This is dependent on the USB 3 controller chip located in the drive interface on the external drive.. I am currently going through USB3 hell with this.. Seagate Backup Plus External 3TB does not boot USB3. Seagate Backup Plus Portable 1TB does.. it's all a crapshoot to see which works & which doesn't.. any Mac that has a USB 3 port CAN boot from it, so long as the drive controller/firmware supports it.\n", "Q: Regular Boot System Unresponsive My computer was working fine until last night when I restarted.

If you do try it, please take the time to report your results, even just to say there was no noticeable difference. Thanks! Here's the demo download page: http://www.luxology.com/trymodo/\nI'm going to ask Luxology if they can shed some light on the situation...\n\nI was searching around for ways to improve graphics performance on OS X and I found an article about disabling an Apple GPU power management kernel extension (I checked and this is loaded on my Mac).\nI also noticed that the same games run much better in Windows 7 under Bootcamp on the exact same hardware. These are OpenGL apps and do not use DirectX. Windows also runs much hotter. The case is hot to the touch and the fans run at their max 6,000 RPM pretty much the whole time Windows is running.\nIn light of these two things—the Apple GPU power management kernel extension and Windows performing better and running hotter—it looks like there is some software layer imposed by Apple that is reducing performance to keep the hardware cooler. -Edit: It seems the GPU power management extension only has to do with dual GPU models, so it wouldn't effect me. Still, it's obvious there's some software-level restraint on performance.\nI have not yet tried removing the kernel extension because obviously running Modo gets the performance boost without removing it. There is still something simpler going on here that allows Modo to boost performance (without abandoning power management and melting the components :3 )\n\nI've noticed that, with no other changes, Urban Terror and Second Life (both use OpenGL) will have double their usual framerate if I run Luxology Modo and use it to render a preview image first. I first noticed this effect a few years ago when I started using Modo. Without changing any settings, Unreal Tournament 2004 would be faster and render effects that just didn't show up at all before.\nAny ideas why this might be?\nUrban Terror, Second Life, and a fully-functional demo of Unreal Tournament 2004 are all available free online if anyone with Modo wants to try for themselves.\nI'm still using Modo 301, but I imagine whatever they did to optimize performance has survived.

How can I make it preserve the current window size when opening a new tab?\n\nA: This behavior is due to the Window settings in Terminal. All new terminals open to what is specified under Window (default is 80 x 24). When you open a tab, it resizes the window to the new tab.\nI wasn't able to find a solution to this for Terminal.app, however, I've since switched to iTerm 2, and it doesn't suffer from this issue. All new tabs open to the same dimensions as the existing window they're opened into, rather than resizing the window to the default.\nYou can find iTerm 2 at http://www.iterm2.com/\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Click on Terminal on the menubar, go to Preferences\n\n*Select General\n\n*Change the option 'New tabs open with' to 'Same Profile'\n\nA: While this is not a full solution but more of a workaround, I still thought it's worth sharing.\nLike many on this thread, I noticed that, much to my annoyance, the Terminal window changes size when I add new Tab on El Capitan (10.11.3). I'm also using Spectacle for arranging my windows from the keyboard. I thought it might be an issue with spectacle but the same happens when I quit spectacle and resize Terminal windows with touchpad. \nFrom what I noticed it only happens to me when when the below sequence is followed:\n1. Open a new Terminal window\n2. Add a new tab\n3. Make the window smaller (height or width)\n4. Add a new tab, and this one will change the size of the window.\nNothing happens when I make it bigger. I figured through experimentation that each and every tab in the window must be holding it's dimensions form when it was last viewed. In this particular scenario the last new tab in step 4 will change the size of the window to what it was when tab 1 was last viewed.\nNow this is most important bit.\nThe new tabs will adjust its dimensions to the biggest tab in the window.\nWorkaround:\nWhen I resize the Terminal window, I use Shift+CMD+Arrows to quickly browse through all the tab in this window. If I do that, new tabs will not affect the size of the window.\nWhile it might be useful to some, I understand that it is not really practical, especially if you have a lot of tabs open. It is my way of dealing with this until a proper solution comes along.\n\nA: Resize your Terminal in Mac Preferences to fit your needs:\nOpen Terminal with Spotlight (⌘space, enter 'Terminal') and open Preferences (⌘,). In the Window tab, look at the Window Size, Columns & Rows. The values are often 80 and 24.\nOptionally, resize your window to fix your desired new size. Pause and think, 24 lines, how wide is a line? OK, how many do I need?\nIncrease column size if when you both create a new tab or new window it is not the same size as your desired size.\nTrial and error, just attempt to keep your estimates close and it will be brief. Similarly decrease if it is too large, for example, on this 1920 × 1200 scaled display the following is great for me: 130 & 40\nTest your new setting by opening a new tab (⌘T).\nPlace your window over the previous one, is it the same size or close enough for you? If not keep resizing, until it is.\nOpen a new terminal window also (⌘N) and do similar.\nNow consider using a window management program, I recommend Spectacle because it is free as in free beer and freedom: https://github.com/eczarny/spectacle\nYou can then use the following to move windows quickly while a window is selected: ⌘⌃→\nThis places the window in the top right corner 1/4 of the screen, left works similarly. If you also hold down shift it will place the window below in the 1/4 half of the screen: ⌘⌃⇧→\nPlenty more options are available, enjoy!\n\nA: To force all terminal windows and tabs to the same size, add a line like this:\neval resize -s 45 157 >& /dev/null\n\nTo your .profile file.\n\nA: It seems that this \"bug\" was introduced in macOS Sierra or High Sierra... but is fixed now with Mojave (10.14).\nOpening a second tab will now adjust the height of the window in order to accommodate the tabs. This was the previous behaviour before this issue.\n", "Q: Streaming protocoll for HTML5-video Is there a universal streaming protocoll that both, Android and iOS devices can play, within HTML5 video objects?\nIt looks like even HTML5 could not \"force\" a universal solution to simplify publisher's work.\n\nA: Extracted from here and supported by the W3 Wiki:\n\nCurrently iOS is the only platform with adaptive streaming, supporting Apple's own HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) protocol. Android 4 introduced HLS support too, but its market share is still low.\n\n", "Q: How do I negotiate dialogue boxes using the keyboard only? On Windows based machines, whenever a dialogue box pops up with multiple choice options (ie 'Abort', 'Continue', 'Retry'), you can use the 'Tab' key to cycle through those options without using the mouse.\nOn OSX, there doesn't appear to be an option to cycle through dialogue boxes using a key rather than the Trackpad.\nIs there any keyboard shortcut to do this?\n\nA: You can press Control+F7 (or fn+Control+F7 depending on your keyboard preferences regarding default function keys) to turn this option on/off on the fly.\n\nA: It is also the tab key. The difference to Windows is, that the \"return\" key always pushes the default button (which is the colored one). The currently selected button (which can be changed using the tab key) is marked through a colored border. If you'd like to push this button, you have to press the space bar.\nFor this to work you must have it enabled in System Preferences / Keyboard / Shortcuts\n\n\nA: Enable focusing with tab key at  → System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Full Keyboard Access... → All Controls\ntab moves between buttons  \nspace presses focused button (with blue outline)\nreturn presses default button (with blue background)  \n⌘+first letter on button presses that button (works sometimes)\n⌘+. cancels    \nesc cancels (works sometimes) \n\nA: MacOS Ventura\nTurn on option at :\n → System Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard Navigation\n\n\nMacOS Monterey/BigSur/Catalina\ncheck the checkbox at :\n → System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts tab → Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls\n\n\nIf the checkbox is already checked, uncheck it and check it again.\n\nA: macOS provides functionality to cycle through dialog boxes, but there is a system setting that must be enabled.\nToggle Functionality with Keyboard Shortcut\nPress Control-F7\nSystem Settings (macOS Ventura and later)\nStarting with macOS Ventura, the setting is in System Settings → Keyboard → Keyboard Navigation.

Also, I recursively changed Steam.app to 777 such that this user doesn't have issues with Steam Update complaining about admin access. This was the easiest way to do this though now anyone can edit it, I know, but all users of this machine are trusted and remote login (SSH) is very carefully disabled. Steam.app is allowed through the Parental Controls prefpane as the admin. Also, upon first run (and subesquent, post-update runs) of Steam, I allowed 'steam', 'ipcserver', and a few other little bits as dialogs popped up.\nPreviously, I temporarily disabled all parental controls on this account, logged in, opened and logged into Steam, downloaded all wanted games, and it Steam -> Go Offline; upon re-enabling Parental Controls and logging back in to the user account I got a 'Could not update - Updates must happen when in Online Mode, not Offline Mode' or some such message.\nHow can I get Steam to run? I'd like to be able to run it in Offline mode (or Online Mode, but this is not required) with parental controls set to whitelist both websites and applications. I'd like to be able to every now and then disable parental controls, open Steam in Online Mode, and download new games in this account, but then be able to drop Steam back to Offline Mode such that I can re-enable Parental Controls without breaking it.\n\nA: Steam has an automatic updating system. Games, and even the steam client will update automatically, if you are connected to the internet.\nWhat seems to be happening to you, is that one of the games (or the actual client) has registered its intent to update, but it cannot, due to offline mode being enabled.\nTry enabling online mode, and updating everything. This should negate the need for an update, and fix the problem.\nHowever, if I have read your question wrong, this method will probably not work.\n\nA: Switch Steam to online mode, open Activity Monitor, click on Steam, and click the blue 'inspect' button. Then click the 'Open Files and Ports' tab. This will show you everything that Steam needs in order to function. For instance, 192.168.1.108:49491->valve.tge2-3.fr4.syd.llnw.net:27030. I don't know whether Parental controls will let you add addresses like this, but it's at least something to think about.\n", "Q: How can I \"mark as spam\" in Sparrow for iOS?

Everything is unlocked and I have the administrator password so I shouldn't have any problems but I am unable to click the delete key. Is there another way to delete a user account without damaging the computer or any other accounts?\n\nA: In order to add/delete accounts you have to unlock first:\n\nwhich will prompt you for an Administrator account/password. Once entered successfully you can select and delete any user not currently logged in.\n\nA: You said you have an administrator password but you have to be signed in to an account that currently has administrator privileges.

How do I get it back? Sometime last week my dock stopped showing up. I rebooted and the problem persists. I can get it back if I go to dock preferences and disable autohide, but I like to keep my screen real estate and would like to have the autohide working.\nAnybody have any suggestions on how to fix this?\n\nA: Try setting the dock (with auto-hide) to the left or right side of the screen.  If either of those work, it would seem that you may have a screen resolution setting that's keeping the dock off-screen.  \nPerhaps try changing your resolution, or bouncing it from one to another.\nIf none of that helps, you can try deleting the dock preferences (returning it to its default state) and restarting the dock.app\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to (or just spotlight to): ~/Library/Preferences\n\n*Delete (or just move them to your desktop) com.apple.dock.plist and com.apple.dock.db \n\n*Open up the terminal and enter the command: killall Dock (if you don't like terminal and killing, you could log out and in again as well)\n\n\nThis will force the dock to make new preference files.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Dock and then turn On and then Off the Automatically hide and show the Dock.

I am using iMovie '11 on my MacBook Air. I am editing two video sources (used to capture the same action from different angles) together into one video, using the audio from one video source as the source throughout. This involves inserting Video B in place of Video A, and then detaching Video A's audio and expanding it so that it syncs up with Video B. I always detach Video A's audio, thus muting the clip's audio and creating an editable version of Video A's audio that I can then stretch out to sync with the inserted Video B footage.\nExcept now when I detach Video A's audio, it mutes both the clip AND the detached audio. The audio is still at 100% (I can see the waveforms too). It is not muted, as I tried muting and unmuting it. I have shut down iMovie and restarted it, as well as restarting my computer. None of this is fixing it. And it's vexing, of course, since I haven't changed any of my editing methods and this problem has just arose, and it's never happened before.\nThis is a fairly time sensitive problem. Does anyone have an idea?\n\nA: Open a new project , make your audio changes, share into mov and move the new clip into your events to make your project.

As the calculations only take about 5 minutes each day and the XServes run hot and loud as well as use a considerable amount of power, I shut them down when I don't need to actually run the calculations (I do run the XServes much more when we do R&D so they do get used).\nAs my work requires me run the above parallel calculations everyday at a specific time and then personally notify someone about the results -- they don't want an automated message:( -- the process has tied me to my desk.  In time I hope to automate the entire process, but probably won't get to that until the fall.\nWell its summer and I want to go to a beach for a few days.\nSo, I need a solution to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Access this network from a remote location. \n\n*Start the XServes or wake them from sleep. \n\n*Log on to the XServes.\n\n*Access and log on to my main desktop machine to: \n\n\n*\n\n*launch my Mathematica application; \n\n*launch the remote parallel kernels on the XServes (I can do this from Mathematica);\n\n*run my Mathematica application; and\n\n\n*Shutdown the XServes or put them to sleep.\n\n\nIdeally, I'd like to this from an iPad, but I have the use of a MacBook Pro if I need it.\nWe do have an old license for Apple Remote desktop if that would help.\nWhile I could leave the XServes powered up while I go to the beach, I'd then have to run air conditioning and that seems like a waste of money and not particularly good for the environment.\nCan I set the XServes to go to sleep if they don't have anything to do?  If I do, can I wake them up remotely?\nAny suggestions on the best way to do all of this, much appreciated.     \n\nA couple of clarifications moved up from comments below.\nI typically access the Xservers by physically turning them on, seeing them come up on Finder, then doing a screen share. Maybe I just need to get them to wake-on-LAN or just wake up when I want to access them. Then I wouldn't need to actually access them via ARD or a VPN. If I can wake them up somehow from my desktop I only need to get to the desktop. \nAlso, the Xserves only serve as parallel processing nodes. My iMac runs Mathematica and my application distributes processing jobs to the computing kernels on the XServes. \n\nA: The main thing to tackle is booting up the xServes. Luckily, Intel xServes (which yours should be if they're running 10.6) have Lights-out-Management (LOM) that should support this sort of thing (all Macs support Wake-on-LAN, but that only works on a local network). \nApple Remote Desktop (ARD) has support for this. It looks like you'll need to forward a few ports (looks like 623 for the LOM, and then a bunch for ARD - do a search), unless you have some sort of VPN access to your home network.\nThe basic method will be, use ARD to power up your xServes, then remotely connect via ARD or a VNC client, build your Mathematica app and run it. Then shut down the xServes.\nIf you have a Mac with you, all this can be done via ARD, but if you want to do it with an iPad, you'll need your desktop Mac running whenever you want to remotely access it. The process there would be to enable Screen Sharing (in the Sharing panel of System Prefs), forward the appropriate ports, then use an app like Screens to connect to your desktop Mac, run ARD and Mathematica remotely on it, and do the above.\nIf you don't have your desktop Mac running all the time, you could in theory use Wake-on-LAN to turn it on, then access it with Screens, but that requires some other device to be always on, remotely accessible and capable of sending the WoL packet to the Mac (some routers are capable of this, typically with 3rd party firmware).\n", "Q: Can I make the Finder label a folder if it contains a file or folder of a specific name?

I have an '08 Mac Pro. If I try plugging in my Belkin N150, it works. Then if I plug in my iPad to the slot beneath it, the wireless kicks out. Then if I plug the wireless back in, they both work. So I think the slots are competing for power? What are some solutions?\n\nA: The iPad is a high power draw device, and Belkin N150 USB Wireless adapter probably is no power slouch either, so it is technically possible for them to be overdrawing an internal USB Bus or Hub in the Mac Pro.\nThe Mac Pro has 5 independent USB Buses as noted in the picture below.\n\nNow depending where things are plugged in they show up in different USB Buses, you may want to Open your System Information Application, and try to avoid placing the iPad and the Belkin N150 on the same bus.\nFor Example, on my computer the ZyXel... and the DataTraveler are plugged into front USB ports and they appear to be sharing the same usb tree. While my external Hub labeled \"Generic USB Hub\" and my VF0680, CIRCA102 are all plugged in rear usb ports on the Mac Pro, note how the CRCA102 is on its own Bus. \n\nA: Could you not connect the Belkin router via Ethernet rather than USB?\nYou may want to ensure that you computer isn't trying to use the iPad as a modem when it's plugged in: System Preferences > Network.\nBy the way you can find out how much current each USB device is drawing in System Information/System Profiler under Hardware > USB.\nEdit:\nUsually if devices are drawing too much power, you'll receive an warning message such as this: http://i45.tinypic.com/accqok.png.\nHere is an an Apple support document which could explain more:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4049.

You should be able to find out why your iPod unit won't run new games and its evidences.\n\n\n*Trying to get things clear with iPod touch 3rd Gen 8GB, here it's more about argument between stores and misled customers.\nAfter you get some ideas, you should've realized by now that you've purchased and owned a true 2nd Gen iPod MC model - commonly advertised as 3rd Gen 8GB iPod around the globe.\nIf you need another evident, go to apple website and register your product with your iPod's serial number and you'll find out that you got a refurbished 2nd Gen iPod.\nYou should also watch Phil Schiller iPod touch presentation September 2009 from youtube, and you'll see 2 things stated by de_an777 :\n\n*\n\n*Phil Schiller wiped out the $229 from the screen and changed it into $199 after he said that $199 is the price point that Apple would give to the 8GB model.\n\n\n*Then he brings up the iPod touch lineup, changed the price of the 8GB model, and doubled the capacity for the 16&32 GB models. He said,\" there are two other things about the 32&64 GB versions of the iPod touch, and I'll make sure you knew about it.\"\n\n\n*The first thing was those large capacity models would operate with up to 50% faster and the second was those models were added OpenGL ES 2.0 support.\n\n\n*But still, he did not say anything about upgrade to 8GB model, which means, it will be the same as the previous model (at that time, Apple hadn't classified iPods into generations yet).\nThese information were also released in apple press release 09/2009, basically telling you the same thing.\nAt this point, there's nothing you can do about it. However, in those 2 threads I've posted here, many people take action to the stores (either authorized or 3rd party ones) because they believe that they were misled during the time of the purchase. If you think you were misled too (such as, the seller said that all 3 3rd Gen models offers the same capability), I think you may take action too.\n\nA: Did you purchased that iPod because you were convinced by the store that it had the same performance as the real 3rd Gen iPod ?\nIf it's a \"yes\", I'm afraid you've been duped by the seller.\nNo matter what you answer might be, here's the fact :\n\n\n*\n\n*iPod touch 8GB in late 2009 is an updated version of the iPod touch in late 2008\n\n*iPod touch 32/64GB in late 2009 is a new version of no previously released iPod\n\n\nAs you can see in picture below (it was Apple online store back in January 2010) :\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple had made no changes to the 8GB models except updated its iOS to iOS3 for free.\n\n*But Apple made new 32GB iPods with faster performance including gaming.\n\n\nHence, this is the official advertisement made by Apple and I still confused why a lot of Authorized stores still making the same mistake since I'm victimized here too.\nFinally, you iPod does not support gaming because it's not a 3rd Gen iPod, its an updated/refurbished/re-released iPod touch 2nd Gen.\n", "Q: Where can I find gcc in Xcode 3.2.6? I have a Mac with OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard. I'm trying very hard to learn the basics of programming in C, but I can't get my first simple program to run. \nI read online to go to Xcode Preferences -> Downloads and check in there for gcc downloads, but Xcode 3.2.6 doesn't have a Downloads tab in the preferences. I've tried downloading gcc from the gcc.gnu website, but I didn't see anything specifically labeled gcc, and I still couldn't get my simple \"Hello, World!\" program to run in terminal. \nIt's very possible this is an easy solution, however I haven't been able to find anything pointing me in he right direction. It's definitely a little convoluted as a beginner, but I'm trying. \nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Just a hand to get Xcode and gcc working. \n\nA: You can install the command line tools separately from here. You want the 10.6 download listed under \"Option 1: Downloading Pre-Built Binaries\". \n\nA: Xcode 3.2.5 does include gcc.\nThere is no need to download gcc from gcc.gnu.\nTo check whether gcc is installed on your machine and gcc is in your shell its search path, do run Terminal command $ which gcc. Our output is: /usr/bin/gcc\nWhen gcc is not in your search path, you can try to find it for example with a Terminal locate command.\nNote in our case there are multiple versions of gcc installed:\n/usr/bin/gcc-4.0\n/usr/bin/gcc-4.2\n\nA: As noted by CanuckSkier above you can download the gcc toolchain as a separate download from within XCode or the developer site, or you can invoke the bundled gcc using the xcrun command.\nxcrun gcc -v\n\nwill give you the version installed. \nIf you are just wanting to learn C however don't get too hung up on which compiler toolchain you are working with. XCode gives you the option to create a command line tool which you can edit build and run within the IDE which should get you started. You will eventually progress to building and running from the shell if you need to.\n", "Q: iTunes library access not consistent I have an iPhone 4s, iPad2, and AppleTV3\nMy problem is that, my iTunes library on my PC doesn't consistently appear over all my devices (on my phone and ipad, I am referring to Apple's Remote app).  Sometimes, my itunes library will be visible by my apple TV and not my phone, or not my ipad, and vice versa. It's very random how some devices can see it and some cant. Even more strange, sometimes, a device will see it, and connect, and control it, but then shortly after, it's as if a connection is severed. And the device can no longer see my library. Any ideas why this would be? Here are some things to help you form answers.\n- Everything is on the same network.\n- They are all as up to date as possible.\n- it DOES work, it just isn't always working.  \n\nA: I have sometimes have similar issues accessing iTunes libraries from AppleTVs. Sometimes I have better luck using a WiFi rather than Ethernet connection.\nAlso, have you tried assigning your AppleTVs static IP addresses (assuming you use DHCP?) \n\nA: I found a fix for this problem.\nWhen any devices can't find my itunes library, I close iTunes, and re-open it and it finds it right away. \nI don't know why this is happening. I have every device on a dedicated router IP address. but at least I know that if the apple TV can't access my iTunes library, a quick restart of iTunes will fix the problem.\n", "Q: iPhone not recognized by iTunes after not ejecting properly I unplugged my iPhone without clicking the eject button. Now the computer doesn't recognize it in iTunes.\nI have followed everything in the help section but still no luck.\n\nA: The built in help (on Mac at least) doesn't have the good troubleshooting articles that http://support.apple.com does.\nI would start with running a Device Sync Test in iTunes and if that won't even run, you can fall back to the Device Connectivity Test.\nThat should pinpoint the source of the issue if it's not software to:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS issue\n\n*USB hardware failure (on the computer, cable or device itself)\n\n*Hardware failure of the device (get it repaired / restored by taking it to another computer)\n\n\nA: I haven't had this problem with an iphone but I have with an ipod. To resolve I opened it on another machine. The other pc didn't think itunes was still open for it and so opened it up. When I went back to the original machine it worked fine again.\n\nA: Try restarting the iTunes Helper process in Task Manager. Otherwise reboot your device and your computer and that should take care of it.\n", "Q: Good iPad piano software? I have a third generation iPad (\"the New iPad\"). I am looking for software I can use to make a piano keyboard appear on my iPad such that when I press the keys, they play notes and sound like a piano. I'd like to be able to use it to plunk out a tune when trying to compose music away from home, and to let my children practice their beginning piano lessons when we're visiting relatives but they don't want to forget what they've learned.\nI am looking for the following features:\n\n\n*\n\n*good responsiveness (no noticeable lag between touching the keys and hearing the notes)\n\n*no ads\n\n*ideally in the $1 - $10 price range (lower is better unless the program is particularly great, but I'm willing to pay for quality)\n\n*doesn't take up too much memory (sorry, GarageBand -- 800MB is too much space to part with on a 16GB iPad)\n\n*key size comes close to that of a real piano\n\n*reasonable number of keys (perhaps a way to shift octaves if necessary to expand range)\n\n*no crazy gimmicks (notes arranged like a piano, not in a spiral or pulsing different colors or other weirdness)\n\n\nCan anyone recommend software that works well for a use case like this?\n\nA: Apple's Garageband for iPad is $4.99 and looks like it should fit the bill pretty well. It also has a whole bunch of other instruments and functionality that may or may not be useful for you.\nI haven't used either, but Virtuoso Piano (Free) and Pianist Pro ($4.99) look like good bets, based on a quick search and the ratings. Pianist Pro was featured in an iPad commercial, which is probably a pretty good endorsement on its own.\n\nA: I ended up liking Real Piano HD Pro better than anything else I tried. At 72.3 MB, it's less than a tenth of GarageBand's size. It has good responsiveness, and it has several configurations (full size keys, smaller keys with multiple keyboards on the screen) and several nice sounding instruments.\n", "Q: Can two iPhones access the same iCloud content? My wife and I have iPhones. We have separate Apple accounts on the phones. Can we share the same iCloud music and pictures?\n\nA: Nope. The same account would need to be signed in on both devices.\n\nA: You would need to both use the same iCloud account in order to share photos across Photo Stream. You can sync both devices with the same iTunes library to share music, while still using seperate Apple ID's within the iTunes store under the phone settings. (if you wish to continue using separate IDs for downloads)\niCloud does not sync music, so if the end result is to share all music downloads and photos the best advice I can give is to stop using one Apple ID and simply start using the same ID. There is no way to merge two IDs, only to both share the ID that contains more downloaded music and apps. \n\nA: Now it's possible: \nYou can set up shared albums on iCloud for pictures, and Family Sharing for music bought on the iTunes Store; you can also subscribe to a Family Plan on iTunes Music. \n\nA: If you have a shared account for iTunes and individual accounts for Mail/Calendar/etc. it is possible to access iCloud music from several devices. Just make sure to log in to iTunes with the shared account on both iOS devices (and on the Mac).\n", "Q: How can you sync videos from Youtube to your iPad for offline viewing automatically? I'd like an application like Readability for iPad, that will download and cache videos on the iPad for offline viewing whenever it syncs with the Internet.\nA qualifying application would let you do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Flag a video for later viewing with a Google Chrome extension\n\n*Avoid having to use iTunes at all\n\n*Automatically download all new videos wirelessly to the iPad whenever the iPad app syncs (just like Readability)\n\n\nIs there anything out there that's close?\nIt could be desktop software or a web application, it doesn't matter.\n\nA: Watchlater does just that. Click a bookmarklet to add a video to the queue, and when you open the app, it will cache the videos in the queue.\n", "Q: Add podcast-like chapters to audiobooks I have a number of audiobooks that are very long (10 or more CDs).  I don't like having them all in separate files because when you leave and come back, you're scrolling through hundreds of files to find the one you were on.  Instead, I used an audio editor to combine them in to 3-5 hour files.  However, if you are scrubbing through the file and accidentally slip (lift your finger, etc), you've now lost your place in such a large file.  I have seen in some podcasts that have chapters, allowing you to use |<< and >>| to skip around, and keeping the scrubbing to within the chapter.  Can these be applied to audiobooks?  If not, can I tell iTunes that my book is a podcast and set them there?  I tried that once but couldn't see how to set chapter markers anywhere.  \n\nA: You can do it with Garageband on a Mac, or using a separate utility on Windows.\nMac with Garageband\nThere's a detailed guide here, but the concise version is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new Podcast in Garageband.\n\n*Delete the placeholder tracks (the Podcast track can't be deleted), then drag in the audio file you want to add chapters to.\n\n*Select the Podcast track, make sure the editor is open (⌘E).\n\n*Move the playhead to the position you want a chapter at, and click Add Marker. Repeat for each chapter position you want. You can add titles if desired.\n\n*Export to disk or iTunes via the Share menu.\n\n\nIf you want the files to appear as audiobooks in iTunes, you may need to select them (in iTunes), and change the Media Kind (Get Info/⌘I, Options tab) to Audiobook.\nWindows using Chapter and Verse\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the free Chapter and Verse program. There are probably others out there, but this one seems to do the trick fairly simply and is free.\n\n*Click Add Files to import your audio track. If it's not in AAC format, it will prompt you to convert it.\n\n*Go to the Chapters tab and add your chapters as necessary.\n\n*Click the Build button to save the file, then import it to iTunes as desired.\n\n\nA: You can do that with Audiobook Binder. It's an open source app, and also available for free on the Mac App Store.\n", "Q: Archive iCloud calendar How do I archive an active calendar so it's still in iCloud but doesn't sync with any devices. I can do this in Google Calendar but not sure about iCloud.\n\nA: You can't selectively sync calendars on iCloud. If it's on iCloud, it goes to all your devices. You can however select which calendars get shown on a each device.\nIn iCal for OS X and Calendar for iPhone and iPad, there's a Calendars button in the upper right corner of each app. Tapping/clicking it will give you a list of all your calendars, grouped by what service they use (iCloud, Local, CalDAV, etc.). Simply uncheck the calendars you don't want to appear.\nIf you want to save a separate copy of one or more calendars as an archive, you can do that with iCal on the Mac. You can save either an iCal Archive, containing all the calendars in iCal as one bundle, or you can save individual calendars as .ics files. Both options are available under the File → Export menu in iCal. Export… will save whichever calendar is selected in the Calendars pop-over menu as a .ics, and iCal Archive… exports all your calendars.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Retina 15.4\" External Display wrong resolutions Before this machine I had a late 2008 MacBook Pro, 15.4\" (Lion) with max resolution of 1440x900.\nThrough the mini to HDMI adapter I attached a second display (TV/Monitor model 19LG3000) and I was able to set a resolution for both displays at 1440x900, it looked very nice and sharp on the external.\nOne thing I caught is that this TV has two HDMI ports, and depending on where I connect the cable (coming from the old MacBook) I get a list of different resolutions in Mac OS X settings and one of them (the port labeled 1) presents the 1440x900 resolution, which does fit in general on this kind of display.\nNow the monitor port (HDMI 1,2) doesn't matter at all if I connect the Retina, it will always display the very same resolutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*1080p\n\n*1080i\n\n*720p\n\n*1600x900\n\n*1344x756\n\n*1024x576\n\n\nwhich I recall being the same list when I connect the old MacBook Pro to HDMI display port 2.\nI tried every combination of resolution/frequency (defaults to 60 Hertz NTSC, but 50 Hertz is also sometime selectable, depending on the resolution value), but everything doesn't look well. Especially for coding it's very bad to the eyes, even at 1344x756.\nAlso I noticed that there is now Underscan, and I had to use it for about 3 bars to let the image fit in the monitor.\nIs this is happening to anyone else?\n\nA: Found SwitchResX 4 but also the keyboard shortcut.\nWhile on the Monitor section, press the Option key when you choose the scaling option, it will show all resolutions.\nNo need for SwitchResX.\n", "Q: iCloud Document Library as replacement for Dropbox? I've been put down by iCloud when it came out and kept using Dropbox instead. I mostly need to synch files between macs and eventually sneak-pick them on mobile devices. I don't take lots of pictures, I'm not an iWork user and most of all I need to share PDF files, Illustrator / Photoshop files and source files as I'm a programmer. Will the upcoming \"iCloud Document Library\" work like Dropbox allowing me to sync and share any kind of file even when not directly supported by an iCloud-linked app? Thanks.\nEDIT\nMaybe I didn't make it clear enough. I don't want to share my documents with other people I want to share them among my devices. The problem with iCloud as it is now is that it doesn't let me manage any kind of file that I like, but only certain formats, while I'd like to synch among my two macs, my iPad and my iPhone files like .zip files, .ai (Adobe Illustrator) files, .avi movies, source files of software I write and so on, hence not being limited to \"sync photos\" or \"sync Pages document\", since those are not kind of files that I'm interested in sharing among devices.\n\nA: No, as iCloud is supposed to be for personal use only. To, in this case, share documents between all your devices.\nYou could always share your password and let someone else log in and download the file, but that will be insecure, of course. Extracted from Apple's iCloud page:\n\nJust sign in to icloud.com/iwork in any modern web browser, and all your iWork for iOS documents will be there — complete with your most recent edits. Click a document to download it in iWork ’09, Microsoft Office, or PDF format\n\nEdit: Documents eligible for sharing with this new feature, are those created or edited with compatible Apps. Therefore, I don't think you'll be able to share any kind of files through iCloud.\n\niCloud is already seamlessly integrated with the Apple iWork apps for your iOS devices — Pages, Keynote, and Numbers. And we’ve given developers the tools to make their apps work with iCloud, too.\n\n\nA: No, iCloud is your Apple device etcetera cloud. It syncs relevant data between your Apple devices and their desktop/iOS app equivalents. While you might be able to upload a zip-file or an .ai file to an iCloud folder, that is not its current intended use. \nEveryone wants their own space on the web these days. Adobe's got their cloud, Microsoft got their 365. Still – the best solution is sticking to ye good old legacy folder and its file, aka. Dropbox et.al.\nShort answer: Dropbox is currently a much better alternative for your needs. \n", "Q: Does backing up the single VMWare Fusion's virtual machine file to be suffecient to backup the entire virtual machine? Does backing up the single VMWare Fusion virtual machine file sufficient to backup the entire virtual machine? Meaning if I use that single file on other Mac or PC, will it run as it is?\n\nA: On a Mac, when you copy the virtual machine file, it is actually a directory with all the files included that you will need to run it on another machine.\nShut down the VM before you copy it otherwise it can give issues on the other system. If you look at the folder you copied afterwards, you will see a bunch of files. The important ones are all grouped with VirtualMachineName.vm* and VirtualMachineName.plist and VirtualMachineName.nvram\nYou can remove all the other files.\nThe one with the .vmx extension is the config for the VM.\n", "Q: How many photos can iPad handle? I have a large-ish photo library on my home network server of over 20,000 pics. I am considering syncing it to my iPad 2nd generation 64 GB, but I am not sure whether the built-in Photos app would be capable of managing that many photos. I know they woudn't fit in the memory, but I am willing to make some kind of selection. My question is not about the raw size (that's easy to compute), but about the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can the built-in Photos app handle several thousands of photos?\n\n*Is it still usable and responsive?\nAny experiences are welcome. Suggestions on alternative apps, in case the built-in one is not good, are also welcome. Thanks.\n\nA: Assuming that each picture you shoot is 1 MB, 20000 pictures will take up 20000 MB which is approximately 20 GB. Now if you put these on your iPad 2, you have around 40 GB to work with keeping the reserved space in mind, which is okay. Looking at that information, you can upload 40000 more if you need. An alternative is to upload them all on a photo-hosting website to save all the 20 GB if you don't look at them often.\nResponding to your second query, yes: it is quite responsive. My uncle has 8436 pictures and 129 videos on his iPad 2 and it is working perfectly.\n\nA: Large amounts of photos shouldn't be any problem on your iPad. Properly built apps don't load all the images (in this case) available when you are in a table view image app. Instead, only the photos that are visible to you are loaded. This is a very efficient process, and they load very quickly (with the help of a little pre-loading). The memory of the iPad 2 should be enough for this: so, you shouldn't need worry about that.\n", "Q: Restoring my current Time Machine (Lion) with my DVD of Leopard? I have bought a new HD and I want to remplace the one I have in my MBP. In wonder if I will be able to restore my current backup made by Time Machine, since I've upgraded my OS to Lion (Using Apple Store). So the only DVD I have is the one I got with my laptop. I think it's Leopard. \nAre those 2 versions of Time Machine compatible?\n\nA: If you have a USB to SATA adapter or drive caddy, you can easily put your new HDD into this, use Disk Utility to partition it with a GUID partition table and format it Mac OS Extended Journaled.\nOnce that's done, restart your system and hold CMD + R to boot into the Lion recovery mode. From there you can choose to install Lion to your new drive. Once that's done you can migrate from the internal drive so that the new drive is now running Lion and has all of your data.\nNow you can safely swap the drives over.\nIf you have no USB to SATA adapter, or drive caddy, you can create a USB Lion installer with Apple's own Lion Recovery Disk Assistant to install Lion on the new drive, and then restore your data from Time Machine.\nYou shouldn't need to touch the Leopard DVD this way.\n\nA: This answer on AskDifferent will give you an idea of what you need. \nYou can restore a Snow Leopard Time Machine into Lion (using migration assistant for example), but I'm almost sure I read somewhere that Leopard (10.5) -> Lion was not supported due to changes in the structure.\n", "Q: Is there some kind of certification for Apple developers? I'm looking for a certification as an \"Apple developer\" but I don't know if that exists.\nI found http://training.apple.com/certification but it only offers certification for OSX and Apple software like FinalCut.\n\nA: There is no official certification. There are, though, non-Apple-official courses which are highly reputed, such as Big Nerd Ranch's, for instance.\n\nA: Apple now offer training with software engineering focused courses for Swift and iOS:\n\nApp Development with Swift\nSwift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and Swift includes modern features developers love. Swift code is safe by design, yet also produces software that runs lightning fast.\n\nWith regard to Apple certification, they do not offer software engineering specific certification.\n\nA: only https://certiport.pearsonvue.com/Certifications/Apple/App-Dev-With-Swift/Overview has an official partnership with Apple to certify students on their Swift Programming knowledge and skills.\nTheir year-long Swift certification program covers high school and college-level knowledge of the programming language, which when attained can be a golden stamp on your iOS developer resume that can lead you to your dream iOS developer role!\nI don’t think it’s absolutely necessary but if you’re all about the certifications, then there you go!\n", "Q: Run and build Visual Studio project on Mac OS X Can I open a Visual Studio C++ project on Mac OS X and run the app?\n\nA: Although you will get more info from Windows/Mac developers on StackOverflow, I can tell you that depending upon the project and its dependencies, you might get away with it or you may not. Of course nothing Windows related can be run on OSX, so if you're only doing a \"hello world\", chances are you will be able to run it, provided you have the right toolchain to build that (gcc++, etc.)\nRegarding whether there's a \"Visual Studio Compatible IDE\" the answer is \"no\" (unless you consider MonoDevelop which works 'ok' for some things).\nThe solution, of course, is to use one of the virtualization alternatives (Parallels, VMWare) or simply have a windows partition via Bootcamp.\n", "Q: iPhoto '09 referenced library - modified files are saved locally? I've been trying to organise my photos better on a NAS (QNAP) that is exposed as an AFP share. I've copied all the JPEGs into an organised structure on the NAS volume manually. I'd like the files on the NAS (RAID5) and the library on the MBP. They have a direct gigabit connection and jumbo frames are enabled.\nI created a new iPhoto '09 library, changed preferences to NOT copy the originals to the library, then imported a directory hierarchy of this years photos. I then proceeded to do some face recognition, tagging and placing as a test.\nI then looked at the external NAS files and the internal HDD files and can see many, many files duplicated within the Modified folder of the new iPhoto library\nMy question is - is this the expected behaviour? Is this avoidable somehow? Can iPhoto be made to save modifications to the original files in the referenced location?\nNote: I would prefer to use iPhoto but I also have Aperture if that is usable in some way. Or open to other suggestions\n\nA: Couple of thoughts:\n\n\n*\n\n*You're running a Referenced Library (where iPhoto does not copy the files to the Library on import). You're doing this with the Library on one volume and the files on another. In iPhoto 09 and earlier, iPhoto uses a system of aliases to track the location of the files. Aliases are very unreliable across volumes. If the path to these files changes you could find yourself fixing each one... one at a time for the entire library. There are other pitfalls to this set up - https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3062728?tstart=0 for more\n\n*No. iPhoto will only store the modified images within the Library package. There is no way to change this behaviour. iPhoto will never modify the original file.\n\n*If you have Aperture then forget about iPhoto. The pitfalls mentioned above simply don't arise as Aperture is designed with Referenced Masters in mind, you can manage and (if need be) relocate referenced masters from within Aperture. Also, Aperture (and iPhoto 11) does not make a Modified version. It does make previews, these will always be stored within the Library package, but with Aperture you can choose not to generate them.\n", "Q: How to import dashboard stickies from an old hard disk without using migration assistant? I recently installed a new hard drive in my Macbook Pro for a fresh installation of OSX Lion.\nHow can I get my dashboard stickies from the old hard disk without using migration assistant?\n\nA: You'll need to copy two files from the old installation of OSX:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dashboard.plist\n~/Library/Preferences/widget-com.apple.widget.stickies.plist\n\nThe first tells Dashboard which Widgets to show, the second contains your notes.\nCopy these to your new ~/Library/Preferences and you should be good.\nYou'll need to restart, logout and login, or kill the Dock, for example by opening Terminal and running killall Dock.\nIt worked for me - but I should warn that my home path was the same on the old install and new install.\n\nA: Make sure that you guys are in the users library (Users/Your username/Library) which I believe is hidden by default. This is different than the computer's Library folder (contains application support and all the other non-user dependent stuff).\nI was able to find the file there when I originally thought it would be in the main library folder.\n", "Q: How do I fix \"An email message can’t be created because Safari can’t find an email application.\"?

I'm currently looking for a Mac mini for development.  I will need to connect 3 Kinect sensors to a computer for an installation. The form factor the Mac mini is ideal, but the main limitation is the number of USB controllers. The Kinect sensors use a lot of bandwidth and each sensor requires a separate USB controller. \nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but the latest Mac mini seems to have only two USB controllers wired to 4 USB ports. Looking on Wikipedia, I see there was a model with 3 USB controllers:\n\nThe Mac Mini 2009 model gave access to 3 different USB busses on the back. Port 2 shares a USB bus with the IR connection. Ports 1+5 and 3+4 are each on their own USB bus. So it should be possible to get a throughput of 3x480=1440 Mbit/s.\n\nMy question mainly is: which is the newest Mac mini that has 3 USB busses?\nAlso, with the new one is there any decent way to expand that somehow?\n\nA: It seems that those after 2009 (which reverted to 4 USB ports instead of 5), only have 2 buses. The 2009 models are likely the only models with 3 USB buses.\nIf you get one of the newer ones with Thunderbolt, it's possible to connect to a Thunderbolt Display which would add a third hub. I don't know of any devices off-hand that will give you just another USB hub via Thunderbolt, but if they're not out there already, they're bound to show up.\n", "Q: Where can I find the phone number of the SIM card that I have in an iPad?

I use PHPStorm to open projects and source (/Volumes/dev/project_path), but sometimes it happens that Forklift freezes (in Activity Monitor 100 and more percent cpu). To solve this I have to kill Forklift, remount and reopen project.\nAny idea or tip for better mounting?\n\nA: Seems https://mountainduck.io is where it's at:\n\nMountain Duck lets you mount server and cloud storage as a local disk in the Finder.app on Mac and the File Explorer on Windows. Open remote files with any application and work like on a local volume.\n\nIf you find other alternatives, add them at https://alternativeto.net/software/mountain-duck/\n\nA: Two good options, one paid, one free.\nTransmit\nTransmit is a long-standing and well-regarded Mac app that handles FTP, SFTP, S3 and WebDAV (possibly other protocols, I'm not sure). It can mount anything you can access as a local volume. $34, but it's the faster way, if you don't mind buying another app.\nFUSE and Macfusion\nDownload and install FUSE for OS X and Macfusion. Make sure to check MacFUSE compatibility when installing FUSE for OS X. Open up Macfusion, add a new share with the + button, and you should be set. This is the free option, but it can be a bit fiddly, and I've heard it can be less stable, but I don't have enough experience with it to say for sure.\n\nA: Best option for me is now Samba. After install and adding smb user it works perfectly. Simply connect in Finder -> Go -> Connect to Server -> smb://server-name/.

There are a few scattered old versions of things on the web and it took me a while to work out where the latest versions of things are:\n\n\n*\n\n*FUSE for macOS was originally macFUSE written by Google, but that project is abandoned.\n\n*The osxfuse Github project has its own version of SSHFS which they should really delete - Mac support was merged into the upstream SSHFS years ago.\n\n*There is a GUI frontend for this called MacFusion but it has been abandoned and still uses macFUSE rather than FUSE for macOS. There are instructions to make it use FUSE for macOS instead.\n\n\nAlso complicating matters, the latest version of upstream SSHFS requires libfuse3, but FUSE for macOS only provides libfuse2.\nAnyway:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install the latest release of FUSE for macOS.\n\n*Download and the latest 2.x release of SSHFS.\n\n\nNow compile it:\ntar xvf sshfs-2.10.tar.gz\ncd sshfs-2.10\n./configure\nmake\ncp sshfs ~/bin/   # (Or whatever)\n\nNow you can mount somewhere:\nsshfs me@host: ~/host\n\n\nA: Because I was missing a simple front end to sshfs for macOS, I wrote my own GUI app called SSHFS-Mountlet. It's a bash script using platypus to provide a menu bar icon. You can mount and unmount previously set up connections with a single click. It only works with ssh public key authentication for ease of use and security.\nYou can download it including the source. It is licensed under GNU GPL 2.0.

I recently dropped my iPhone 4 in the bath. Whoops...\nKnowing Apple's stance on water damage, I simply upgraded (I was due an upgrade as part of my contract) and got a new phone.\nMy house-mate then informed me that I could go to Apple and purchase a new phone for £119. I did just that, and the kind lady in the Apple store let me know that the new phone only comes with a 90 day warranty.\nAs such, I have two Apple phones, and I'd like to sell my old (but brand new..) iPhone 4.\nMy question is: if someone purchases my phone on say eBay, will they too receive the 90 day warranty, or does it become invalid when I sell the phone?\n\nA: The original warranty usually the standard 1 year + any AppleCare stays with the iPhone. And any remaining warranty transfers to the new owners.\nApple Care FAQs\n\nIs the AppleCare Protection Plan transferable?\nYes. If you choose to sell or give away your Apple product, you can also transfer the ownership of the AppleCare Protection Plan. Please see the AppleCare Protection Plan Terms and Conditions for complete details.\n\n\nA: If you bought the iPhone 4 new through the Apple Store or a Cellphone store, it comes with  a one year warranty, not a 90 day warranty. This applies in The UK as well as in the US.\nAs per the iPhone 4 warranty: \n\nApple warrants the Apple-branded hardware product and accessories contained in the original packaging (\"Apple Product\") against defects in materials and workmanship when used normally in accordance with Apple's published guidelines for a period of ONE (1) YEAR from the date of original retail purchase by the end-user purchaser (\"Warranty Period\"). Apple's published guidelines include but are not limited to information contained in technical specifications, user manuals and service communications.\n\nThe date of purchase is tied to the serial number at the point of sale. Your eBay purchaser will have the remaining balance of the one year warranty. They can check the status of the warranty at: https://selfsolve.apple.com/agreementWarrantyDynamic.do\nIn short, yes, they will have the warranty, but the warranty does not \"start over\" when the buy it, they only get the remaining balance.\nIf you have AppleCare Plus, it must be manually transfered by calling Apple's 800 number. AppleCare Plus can only be transferred ONE time. (The purchaser could not transfer it a second time)\n", "Q: How can I see my home folder in the finder?

The name has been changed to \"whatever (1)\"\" (or (2), I'm up to (4) at the moment).\nThe Mac is plugged in to the network via an ethernet cable and gets a DHCP assigned IP address from my router which runs pfSense. I have DHCP set to give the same IP address to the Mac's Mac.\nWhy does this happen, and more usefully, how can I make the machine stop renaming itself?\nIn System Preferences - Sharing I have 'File sharing' and 'Remote Login' enabled.\n\nA: Usually this is the fault of the router and the Mac is responding to conditions out of its control.\nHave you tried using a fixed IP address or making a DHCP reservation so that your Mac more reliably claims the same address when it wakes from sleep?\nThis has gotten much worse with iOS 8 and OS X 10.10 and there are several bugs in the new discoveryd daemon that replaces mDNSResponder for DNS naming and device discovery and routing. Basically, even computers with one network connection, there are two IP addresses - one IPv4 and the other IPv6 and the system is confusing one for the other and incrementing the host name.\n\nA: This happens to me on occasion most typically when the OS has some sort of hiccup and needs a cold restart.\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplug the router.  For some reason after the restart, the computer has trouble connecting with the network as the, router \"thinks\" that a connection was never broken in the first place.

This means that your Mac will no longer change it's name automatically, so it's important that there are no other machines on your network that actually have that hostname. When you run this, replace \"new_hostname\" with your desired hostname:\nsudo scutil --set HostName new_hostname\n\nsudo scutil --set LocalHostName new_hostname\n\nsudo scutil --set ComputerName new_hostname\n\nYou can check to make sure the values are set by running:\nscutil --get HostName \n\nscutil --get LocalHostName \n\nscutil --get ComputerName \n\nSources: man scutil\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man8/scutil.8.html\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2010/09/06/change-your-mac-hostname-via-terminal/\n\nA: Another option to try is disabling Wake for Network Access inside of System Preferences -> Energy Saver. We have this problem at work and doing that + renaming it back usually seems to hold the name in place\n\nA: This automatic renaming hostname number (1), (2), (N), ... suffix problem plagues many Apple devices, has a lot of potential workarounds, but no known full solution.  It most likely has to do with a network discovery protocol used for Apple AirPlay and other services called:\n\n\n*\n\n*mDNS (also known as Bonjour, Avahi to Linux users, or Zero-conf Networking to Windows users).\n\n\nThis service is automatically started in Mac OSX, and is how local machines are able to discover each other via hostname.local mDNS names, as well as discover services such as AirPlay.\nMany users online have come up with workarounds or potential solutions, but in my experience none have worked reliably all the time.  Setting hostname only appears to work for a short period.\nI have started a Work-in-progress workaround & answer placeholder here.  Hopefully Apple will provide a fix for this issue in the future!\n", "Q: Is it possible that some hacker is logged in to my computer? When I type w at the terminal I see myself logged in two times.\n\nWhat are console and s000? Is it possible that one of these neos is actually somebody else?\n\nA: Nope. Both of those are you.\nconsole is where you've logged in (likely on startup), and the GUI started up.\ns000 is the first shell you opened, the Terminal window itself. If you look at the WHAT column, it shows the last command run in that shell (w), which you just did.\nSo it's the same user (you), logged into two sessions, one for the OS X GUI, and once in that shell in the Terminal window.\n", "Q: Running Ubuntu under VirtualBox vs natively Does anyone have any recommendations on how to use Ubuntu on a Mac machine alongside OS X? It's OK if I switch between them by booting, if that is best.\nThe two options I'm considering:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run Ubuntu in VirtualBox\n\n*Dual boot into Ubuntu\nI suspect #2 has better performance but may involve more hardware driver issues.\n\nA: Running an OS natively vs running it through a VM both have their strong and weak points.\nRunning it natively will give you better performance because you aren't running two OS's at the same time. You're native install will have all the RAM and CPU cycles to itself.  If you have extra HD space that you don't mind partitioning to use for the install, its great, just be sure to give yourself enough space in the beginning because expanding partitions can be a pain. There are many guides to installing Ubuntu on your mac all over the web, usually involving rEFIt. This can be a little tricky depending on which mac you have, but if you follow the guides out there carefully, everything should go fine.\nRunning it in a virtual box can be great though because it is the easiest and most hassle free way to get ubuntu on you mac.  This is what I would recommend.  Having it in a virtual box means that you don't have to partition your drive, it can usually be moved easily between Macs, and it doesn't require you to reboot your machine, you can even delete it if you hate it and no repartitioning to get your space back.  And best of all you can still access the mac side at anytime and switch between both seamlessly.  The downsides of this are usually performance when it comes to heavy things, if you are doing regular things (web surfing, programming, document editing, etc) though then it won't be a problem, if you plan on doing super CPU, RAM, GPU intensive things on your ubuntu side then you might want to consider the native install path.  It is really up to you though. The more RAM the better. Most machines come with 4GB which is good for running OSX Lion and Ubuntu side by side.\nPersonally, I would recommend trying the virtual box install first, seeing how you like it and how it performs. If everything is great, no need to try the native install.  If not, then those guides all over the internet will lead the way.\nI hope that this answer helps you out.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut for restoring applications from the Mac OS X Dock? Is there a keyboard shortcut to restore a minimised application window from the Dock?\nAlmost all Apple Mac OS X applications respond to the Apple + M command which minimises the current application window to the Dock, which is fine.\nI can then use Command + Tab to cycle through my running applications - including the minimised application, but selecting the application with the minimised window neither restores the minimised window, nor sets focus to the minimised application window in the Dock so I can restore it without having to reach for the Mouse.\nUpdate: Thanks for the answers, however the consensus seems to be to use the 'Hide' feature (Apple + H) instead of minimising, as it's easier to get the window back using Command + Tab.\n\nA: To restore one of many minimized windows using only the keyboard, you have two choices:\nWhile using Cmd + tab (eg. changing applications):\n\n\n*\n\n*Start with a minimized window\n\n*Cmd + tab to the application icon (Continue to hold Cmd)\n\n*While holding Cmd, push the ↑ (or ↓) arrow key on the keyboard. This will bring up a list of all the application's windows (You can release key command key once the window list view comes up if you like)\n\n*Push the down arrow key (↓) to select the minimized windows.\n\n*Use the left and right arrow keys (← or →) to select the minimized window you want\n\n*Push Return or Enter to restore the window and bring it into focus (make it the selected window)\n\n\n(Tested on OS X Mountain Lion)\nOr,\nDirectly when the application is already the current application:\nSteps as above, but instead of steps 2 and 3 (Cmd + tab and arrow keys):\n\n\n*\n\n*Start with a minimized window\n\n*Control + ↓. If App Exposé is selected in Trackpad preferences, you can also swipe down with three fingers.\n\n\nOS X Mountain Lion \"Keyboard\" preferences have a \"Mission Control\" keyboard shortcut for this:\n\n\nA: Depending on how your keyboard is set in system preferences, the shortcut to focus the dock may be Ctrl + Fn + F3.\n\nA: I asked for assistance at the Apple Genius bar in Aventura, and while they didn't have an answer, they did suggest using the Hide feature instead (Apple + H) which works well because when I Alt + Tab back to the application the hidden window is shown.\n\nA: I would strongly suggest using Witch. This lets you bring back minimized apps, as well as 'orphaned' apps, after you have closed the main window. You can also directly access the different windows within an app. Well worth the registration fee; about 10 euros. \n\nA: Some applications have their own shortcuts:\n\n*\n\n*iTunes: ⌘ Cmd+⌥ Opt+1\n\n*Messages: ⌘ Cmd+0 (for the Messages window); ⌘ Cmd+1 (for Buddies list)\n\n*Calendar: ⌘ Cmd+0\n\n*Notes: ⌘ Cmd+0\n\nA: I have found the answers to this question helpful for this as well.\nFor an easy way to invoke App Expose to get at minimized windows for current app use Ctrl-Down; Down; Enter.\nExplanation here:\nCtrl-Down Exposes application windows.\nDown To select the minimized window.\nEnter To show the selected window\n\nA: *\n\n*Command + Tab until you get the app's icon.\n\n*Before releasing the Command key, press and hold the Option key.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You must switch to another app and let it take focus first. In other words, you can't just Command + Tab to another app and before actually selecting that app (by releasing the Command and Tab keys), switch right back to your minimized app, which you might attempt to do if you minimized it by accident or just simply changed your mind shortly after minimizing.\n\n*Both the Command and left Option keys must be pressed on the same side (left or right) of the keyboard.\n\nA: I don't know of a direct way to restore a minimized window, however, you can get keyboard focus in the dock by pressing fn+control+F3. Then select the item you want via the arrow keys and press space or return to restore it.\n\nA: I had to find this one, as I use Linux as well as Mac OS X, and in Thunderbird Ctrl + M is the key to compose a new message... under Linux. On Mac OS X, it keeps \"minimizing\" the app. This is a little tricky, but...\nCmd + Tab to the app you want to restore. Release Tab, but keep Cmd held down. Now press Option (a.k.a. Alt), and while it is held down release Cmd.\nI have been \"training\" myself to make use of Cmd + H (Hide) on Mac OS instead of minimizing. If you hide an app, then once it is selected via Cmd + Tab it pops back up on-screen.\n\nA: I use OS X El Capitan\nCmd M is minimize and then press Cmd L works\n\nA: There is another way! Going off of the other answers you can actually access the other windows of a single application using Ctrl + Down. Now you can simply press any arrow to navigate through all the windows that are open or minimized.\nIf you didn't want to focus on the window you were on and wanted to cancel the whole thing and return to the window of that app that you were already focused on just press Ctrl + Up. \nAlso, don't forget you can access any of the windows that are not minimized of the same app by using Cmd + `  <-thats the same key as ~ for those who never use backticks.\n", "Q: How to configure Xserve to go into sleep mode when Energy Saver setting don't work? This question relates to an earlier question, but as it seems a unique and contained problem I thought it merited its own.\nTo review I have a home office network comprised of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Time Capsule\n\n*27\" iMac with dual cores running Mac OS X 10.6.8 and\n\n*2 Xserves each with 2 quad cores running Max OS X Server 10.6.8\n\n*All networking by Ethernet\n\n\nI access the Xserves through Finder -> Share Screen.  This works fine.\nI use the Xserves to run parallel calculations for about 5 minutes a day. As the machines run hot and loud as well as use a considerable amount of power, I want them to \"Sleep\" when I don't need to actually run the calculations, even better if they fall asleep on their own!\nSo, I went into the Xserver's System Preferences, opened Energy Saver, and configured the settings as you can see below:\n \nThe Xserves should fall asleep after about 5 minutes of inactivity. They don't.  \nNot even when I have the \"Share Screen\" window closed.\nNote, I need \"Wake for Ethernet network access\" checked because I want to use \"Wake On LAN\" capability to wake the Xserves from a remote computer.\nI can put the Xserves to sleep manually from the \"Share Screen\" window, but having to do that just seems silly.\nAny ideas of what I need to do get them to fall asleep?\n\nA: Well, XServes are servers after all, designed to provide user services 24/7/365. I bet that there are some services (web serving, mail, iChat, etc,) turned on by default that you must first turn off before the Xserve can sleep. If you didn't setup these Xserves yourself, (or even if you did,) this Snow Leopard Server Getting Started manual may help you to find out how to look for these services in the Server Admin app to shut them down. This Snow Leopard Server Installation & Setup Worksheet may also provide you with more insight.\nThrough Network Utility on the Xserve itself, or on the remote machine using the Xserver IP address, you could use the Port Scan tab to find out which services are being advertized, and thus which services are running. Here's a handy chart of the ports Snow Leopard Server uses.\n\nA: There's a free app called Please Sleep. This works well on my iMac when something is keeping it from sleeping. It waits for the Energy Saver time limit then forces the system to sleep, even if iTunes is running or a video is playing or whatever. You can configure what applications it acknowledges and ignores when determining whether to force sleep or not.\nNot sure how it'll work on an Xserve. If it does, it'll save you from having to manually put them to sleep.\nSometimes I get to a state where even manual sleep doesn't work. In those cases though, even this can't help.\n", "Q: Use same slide number on several slides in keynote? As you might know, you can add some notes for every slide in Keynote. Since I want to talk quite a lot about one specific slide, there are a lot of notes I want to add to this slide. In the moderator view, I can view this notes, but since they are so long, I would have to scroll if I place them all on one slide.\nSo my idea was to copy the slide lets say five times and put a portion of my notes on every of the copies. Then, I can \"click through my notes\" while the slide looks similar all the time. The only problem is, that if I do so, the slide has five different slide numbers.\nIs there a way to set the number of  a slide or any other way to solve this? Thank you!\n\nA: I don't think there is an option for this. So you will have to manually number all slides in order to keep the slide/page number the same for several of them.\n\nA: Maybe the answer is to resize the notes display in the Presenter View. If you can get your notes to fit comfortably in Presenter View, then there is little need for duplicating the slides. \nTry the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Keynote, select \"Play -> Customize Presenter Display\". You'll be presented with a flexible layout and and an Inspector \n\n*In the inspector, assure that \"Notes\" is checked.\n\n*Try resizing the \"Notes\" display so that it is large enough to view all (or most) of your notes.

Having said that, I did purchase the above Headset Buddy and am unable to get it working in any way. It appears that the OS does not recognize the device in any way and it is not an available selection within Sound, only the internal components.\nI want to avoid using a USB solution at all costs but more importantly identify if the port is indeed audio in/out and how I can get my Headset Buddy functioning properly?\n\nA: The port does support headphone+mic combos, which you can verify for yourself by plugging in any headset that's compatible with an iPhone. Apple notes this on the Audio section of the Tech Specs.\nThe reviews on the product page suggest that it works with other Macs, so it seems likely you've got defective hardware somewhere in the chain. Try testing the components individually with other known-good devices. Test the adapter + headset with an iPhone or iPad, the headset itself with a PC, and the MacBook Air port with an iPhone headset.\n\nA: You can probably benefit from my (rather expensive) experiment with a happy ending. ;)\n\nA: using a 3.5 mm jack splitter for three poles (iphone style connector to mic/headphone split) will not work so well. sometimes a mic that is connected simply wont be recognized and sometimes it will. i connected my mixerboard in this fashion and got a high noise floor. \nplus a weird thing happened when playing clipped sound on the computer. in some way the clipped sound must resemble how the button on a headset works cause every time i would play the same bit of clipped recording itunes would start. \nall in all, unstable solution. i'd say, get a usb-soundcard!\n", "Q: iPhone Backup Restore Ate 30 GB of HD Space - How to Clean Restoring my iPhone backup ate about 30 GB of hard drive space. I had to keep up with it deleting files the whole time it was running. Not much fun. \nI'm guessing it extracted a bunch of files somewhere. I want to get rid of these files while still having my iPhone backups. It doesn't seem normal that iTunes wouldn't clean up after itself but oh well.\n-- Edit --\nThe first time I tried the restore process it ate about 10GB and I never recovered that after it failed.\n\nA: The first thing to try is to delete any extra backups that might have been made in iTunes. Open the Devices tab in iTunes Preferences, see if there are any extra backups (it should list the device name and date it was backed up. Any backup that has a timestamp in the Name (i.e. \"Device Name - 2012-07-03 3:12PM\") was created during a device restore.\n\nSelect the backups you want to delete, click Delete Backup…, then confirm, then click OK in the Devices Preferences window. If you don't click the OK button, the files don't actually get trashed from the Finder.\nIf after that, you still haven't recovered all your space, check the ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup folder (~/ means /Users/your_user_name/) folder. That's where the iTunes backups are stored. They're named using hashes, so you have to guess based on the dates which is which, but if you see more folders than there are entries in the Devices Preferences in iTunes, they didn't get deleted properly. You can delete them directly from the Finder, but make sure you know what's what before removing it.\nFinally, if you're still low on space, try a tool like GrandPerspective, which will scan whatever folders you specify (I suggest starting with your user folder), and give you a graphical representation of the sizes of all the subfolders and files within. Pretty easy to find big files or folders taking up space. A likely culprit after a restore is .ipsw files laying around that didn't get cleaned up - that's the system image for iOS devices.\nIt's also worth checking to see if during the restore, your iPhone sync settings changed - it may have synced apps or media that wasn't previously synced to your computer.\n\nA: In addition to CanuckSkier's answer, I'd suggest setting your iPhone to backup to iCloud rather than your local machine. This setting is on the Summary Page when your iPhone is connected to iTunes.\n", "Q: Is it possible to edit the web pages in the Profile Manager user portal? When setting up Profile Manager in Lion Server, there are a few web pages that are generated for web management of both devices and profiles.  Is it possible to edit these pages in any way?  I am just looking to customize the look and feel without changing the functionality.  \nIf editing is possible, where are these pages stored?  I have looked through the /Library/Server/ProfileManager and /Library/Server/Web folders without any luck.\n\nThis is one particular page I would like to edit. Ideally I would like to be able to edit the HTML directly.  I am looking to match the page's style with a variety of other pages hosted on the server.  \n\nA: I was able to locate the source for these pages.  The comments on this question by ioi's were leading in the right direction.  The root directory for the app is /usr/share/devicemgr/.  The portal is actually a Ruby on Rails app, so there is no direct HTML to edit.  However, there are CSS files that can be edited to fit your needs.  The CSS files relating to the page I posted are located in /usr/share/devicemgr/backend/public/start_ota/.\n", "Q: iPhone 4S not syncing with my Google calendars I just purchased an iPhone 4S and I am using iOS 5.1.1. Only one of my Google calendars is syncing. I've searched the web and have tried every suggestion, nothing is solving the problem.\n\nA: You'll need to make sure that your account is properly configured in Settings > Mail, Contacts, and Calendars.\nSince you're using Gmail, make sure that Calendars are set to ON and then go to the Calendar app and make sure all the calendars are selected to be displayed by tapping \"Calendars\" in the top left corner and checking off all the calendars you want to see from your Gmail account.\n\n\nA: That's the google recommended way\nhttp://support.google.com/mobile/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=139206\n\nA: Maybe you have only enabled CalDAV syncing for the one calendar that works?\nOn this page you can select which calendars are to be synchronized to the CalDAV devices*:  https://www.google.com/calendar/syncselect\n*) iPhone etc.\n", "Q: Siberia v2 microphone will not work with OS X or Windows XP in Boot Camp Is there a workaround to get my Siberia v2 headset microphone to work with OS X or Boot Camp Windows XP?\nIn OS X, the microphone is recognized but will not let me switch to it in Steam. The built-in microphone still picks up everything. I tried to switch to into in the Sound options.\nIn Boot Camp Windows, the microphone isn't even recognized. Under Control Panel > Sound options > Voice... the only option I have is for the built-in mic.\nI have one of the newer iMacs. \n\nA: There are two options for using a Siberia v2 with a Mac. The first is to buy the one that has the proper connector already (they have one with the 3-ring connector) or to buy the standard, dual connector audio/mic v2 and use an adapter such as Headset Buddy to connect.\nThe adapter works fine, however, but there is a ritual associated with using this headset with that adapter on my later 2012 MBPr (running 10.8.3). It seems that if I mute/turn off the microphone (using the switch on the headset cable) before plugging it in, then the mic will be recognized by my Mac. But, if I do not mute the mic, it won't recognize the headset mic. When I disconnect, mute, and reconnect, it works flawlessly even after enabling the mic. It doesn't sound weak or lossy as other posters have stated that non-powered mics would.\nObviously YMMV, and I did see another poster that said he had to turn his mic off before plugging it in (not sure what headset he was using, though).\n", "Q: WiFi Sync iPhone on new MacBook Pro I am able to sync when the iPhone is connected by cable, although its not possible through WiFi.\nOn my previous mac, the iPhone would be visible in iTunes at all times while both connected to WiFi.\nAlthough now its not visible whether its connected to power source or not. Also from the iPhone my MBP doesn't appear available. Both devices are registered under same Apple ID.\nHow can I fix this issue?\n\nA: *\n\n*Connect your iPhone to iTunes and select it when it shows up in the sidebar.\n\n*Scroll down in the Summary Pane until you see the \"Options\"\n\n*Assure that the \"Sync with this iPhone over Wi-Fi\" option is checked.\n\n*Click the \"Apply\" button and you're done. \n\n\n\n", "Q: Educational Volume Purchase and B2B (iOS apps) Can the Educational Volume Purchase Program work with apps developed and distributed through the B2B program?  The WWDC session video on it mentioned education once, but it only talked specifically about distributing the apps through the regular Volume Purchase Program, which requires a DUNS number.\n\nA: Answer from telephone support: yes.  The B2B program interfaces with the Educational Volume Purchase Program the same way the regular Volume Purchase Program does.\n", "Q: Are these root certificates suspicious? On a fresh install of Leopard when I look at the root certificates this is what I see when I order them by expiration date.\n\nI find the names, dates, and number of certificates suspicious. Is this all normal?\n\nA: Yes the installed certificates are valid, however I would advise updating to the latest version of Leopard and make sure that the compromised Diginotar certificates are uninstalled:  This link at ps Enable provides an easy method for this.\nOn Root Certificates, they are by their nature long lived since they are the \"Master\" certificates and having them expire too often would cause issues with SSL certificate chain's world-wide.\n\nA: Yes, they're listed in date order and all look to be valid root certification authorities.\nIt is extremely unlikely that anything could be compromised at install unless perhaps you used media downloaded from a third party. If it was real media and the disk was formatted you're almost certainly fine; the only attack vectors then being other infected macs on the local network or infected updates downloaded from fake update servers you're directed to by dodgy dns servers that have been intentionally configured on your dhcp server for that purpose (this scenario is so unlikely you'd stand a better chance of infecting your macbook with a virus by sneezing on it). \n\nA: This is normal. Don't worry about this.\nMac always send/get a messages from his own server, and this certificates needed for them.

This question is related to this other question.\nAfter you have jailbroken your device, you have root access to your device and so do apps that you install. \nCan you change the account that an application runs with after you have installed it? This would allow to use an account with less privileges.\nIf it's possible, then how do you grant/revoke access to data (address book, emails, settings) and APIs (install keyboard hooks, issue network request)?\n\nA: Someone would have to write a sandbox for jailbroken programs, which would be extremely ironic, because the point of jailbreaking was to escape the sandbox. Normal apps still run under the mobile user when you're jailbroken, though, so there's nothing to worry about there. All jailbreak packages have full access to anything, and there's currently nothing you can do about that. Just play it safe, and only install trusted packages from reputable developers/repositories. A related question that I answered on the same subject can be found here.\n", "Q: Monitor not displaying color red. Is this the monitor or some setup I'm missing? I've plugged the monitor into both an iMac 2006 and a MacBook 2008. Red shows up as black. I've set up the monitor in System Preferences and on the monitor itself. The color red simply shows as black. Is there something I'm missing or is the monitor likely broken? \nI've searched online and can't find similar issue. \nEdit: Now I'm *really confused: can't be the monitor, because I tried plugging a different monitor (from a friend's computer) and I have the same problem.\n\nA: There are applications that let you control how much of each color component in the display generated by your machine gets to the monitor. An example of this is Dark Adapted.\nThese are useful for adjusting your monitor for night time viewing, and other special cases. Unless you have something like this running on BOTH the machines, it's likely that the problem is either with the monitor itself, or with the cable.\nAre you connecting via VGA or DVI? A problem with the cable wouldn't manifest like that on DVI, but could on VGA, where individual pins literally correspond to component colors. If on VGA, try another cable and see if that helps. If that doesn't work, it's most likely that the monitor is broken. \n\nA: Based on the fact that your edit says that two different monitors have the same problem, I'm guessing it's either the OS's color calibration or the pins on the cable/port.  I'd try a new cable, first, as it's the easiest thing to do and the most likely culprit. If that doesn't work, check the color calibration under System Preferences > Displays > Color. If that doesn't work, check the port on your computer and see if there's anything obviously wrong with it.\n\nA: My Acer monitor lost the red color before.  I found no answer to the problem.  One day I wiggled the cable and the red color came back. The same problem and remedy repeated many time. Today I tried to move the cable to different directions without result.  I guess I have exhausted the possible directions.  But if you have not tried this, it may work for you.\n\nA: A DVI/VGA monitor from 2009 failed to display ANY RED once connected via VGA today.  It now looks fine after a few hours.\nAfter the fact (I forgot to check) I noticed the Color Profile is different for VGA or DVI input.  DVI input only was used before then. \n", "Q: App compatibility for first gen iPod touch I have recently acquired a first-gen iPod touch updated to iOS 3.3. I'm having trouble installing apps from iTunes as it appears most require iOS 4 and above. So far I have managed to find two games that are still compatible with iOS 3. Not even the Facebook app will install! iTunes says I have the latest iOS available installed.\nIs there a way to force install iOS 4? Otherwise, is there a third party repository of older apps I can install from (obviously after jailbreaking)?\n\nA: You can use iOSSearch, a free tool to find apps in the iTunes store which are compatible with iOS 3.1.3. This is a non-commercial page I made.\nNote: the app store has recently been updated to allow downloads of last compatible versions but it appears that this only provides apps which are compatible with iOS 4.\n\nA: You can install whited00r so you can have an app market with all the iOS 3 compatible apps! It also lets you use multitasking, wallpaper and all the things only newer iPhones/iOS versions have.

Is it possible to set certain non-Retina enabled apps to not scale up (in other words, run at a native resolution) on the new Retina MacBook Pro?\n\nA: SwitchResX is what you want. It will allow you to set application specific display sets.\nSwitchResX is a commercial third party application, but it is available to try for free and for download. Probably because it is technically a hack to use the full resolution of Retina Displays, it appears to be unavailable on the Mac App Store.\nBy creating display sets for each application you wish to use the full native Retina Display resolution, effectively, you can disable the scaling for individual applications.\n\n\n\nA: It is possible to disable the auto-scaling of all applications from System Preferences > Monitor: https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht5266\nOf course you'll see everything smaller :)\n", "Q: Exporting pictures from iOS device without using a computer How can export pictures on an iOS device to an SD card or a USB memory stick without using a computer?\n\nA: Since the iPhone and iPod Touch don't have an SD card port or the inherent ability to mount a USB memory stick, you'll need to purchase 3rd party hardware (and potentially software) to transfer data to either of these media types without a computer.  \nA Google search on the subject could help. I can't make a product recommendation, but one place to start is with some reviews like this one at Wired's Gadget Lab\n", "Q: How do I list iTunes apps by the account that purchased it? I've got more than one person downloading apps to my iTunes, and so I'd like to list all apps purchased by one account (meaning the same email address). How can I separate apps like this?

I need some advice. I am new and non-techy so please could you help me on a simplified level.\nI am running Snow Leopard on my Mac which I am happy with. I will upgrade to Mountain Lion later but I want to bypass Lion. \nHowever I need access to Xcode 4.2 for a course I enrolled on. It's a long story but you can't get access to Xcode 4.2 for Snow Leopard unless you have a paid developers account for $99. The only other option is to download Lion for $29.99 instead and use Xcode 4.2 for Lion.\nI was told I could keep Snow Leopard and use Lion on a partition. I have downloaded Lion and made a bootable USB drive.\nI keep reading about booting from a USB drive. What does this mean in practise? Could I just run Xcode from the USB drive instead of having to make a partition on my Mac's HD? Would an 8 GB flash drive be enough to run Lion and Xcode? All I need to use in Lion is Xcode and maybe Safari.\nOr should I just make a small partition for Lion? I feel uncomfortable making a partition for Lion as I read that Lion OS makes a second extra unrecoverable partition that uses up space.\nThanks\nSoph\n\nA: There are multiple scenarios in your question. Your final objective is to run Xcode 4.2. Since Xcode is free, you can always try an Apple Store, they may be able to give you a hand with that and install the SL version for you if you charm them enough. That's the simple route, never underestimate an Apple store.\nIf you want to go ahead and install a Lion, you can connect any external drive (8GB Penn Drive won't cut, too small, too slow), you should rather get a cheap USB2/FW800 (if your hardware supports it) 500GB drive (or even less) and you could use that as the installation drive (make sure it's connected when you boot your Lion's bootable media).\nAnother alternative (more time consuming but more \"secure\") is to use an external drive the same (or bigger) size as your current drive, clone your current bootable Snow Leopard into it, make sure it boots (more on this later) and then install Lion in your current drive, as an Upgrade. You can always boot back your old backup drive with SL (and clone it back to Lion if you prefer, including the \"hidden\" Lion Recovery Partition).\nThis way you know your original drive stays untouched in the Backup and you can always bring it back. I wouldn't, being so close to ML, I'd just stick with Lion for a month or so, but that's just me.\nSo how do you boot an external drive or a different bootable partition?\nWhen the computer is starting (and you hear the chime), press and hold ⌥ and wait for things to happen, you should see a list of bootable media (and partitions).\nHow do you clone your drive(s)?\nUsing the very reliable and free of charge Carbon Copy Cloner. Rather simple to use. \nRemember, after you make a bootable clone, always restart your computer and test the clone making sure it boots and that your data is there. You don't want to find out in a couple of weeks that what you thought was your backup, doesn't work at all.\nLast but not least, if you need help installing OS X on an external drive, here's a simple tutorial. \nGood luck in your Xcode endeavors!\n[thisAnswer release];\n", "Q: How to use CTRL+W instead of CMD+W in Chrome? I'm using my Caps-lock as \"CTRL\" on Mac OS X Lion 10.7.4. On Linux and Windows I can easily close and open tabs via CTRL+W and CTRL+T. \nHowever on Mac I have to use CMD+W and CMD+T. CTRL+W and CTRL+T doesn't work. \nWhat can I to fix this behaviour?\n\nA: You can customize some shortcuts in System Preferences:\n\nYou could also use an application like Keyboard Mastro to assign control-W to a macro that emulates pressing command-W. But it might have a small additional delay or not work everywhere.\nBut it would be nearly impossible to have the shortcuts changed consistently or to use control instead of command as a modifier key everywhere in OS X.\n", "Q: Airplay over wired network? I intend to buy a MacBook Air.\nI already own an AirPlay enabled receiver/player from Denon. It features both WiFi and Ethernet network interfaces.\nWill AirPlay work over a wired (Ethernet) network (no WiFi at home).\n\nA: Yes, it will work as long as both the MacBook Air and the Denon receiver are on the same network segment. Your Air will need either the USB or Thunderbolt adapter to connect to ethernet (the latter provides Gigabit speed as well as supports jumbo packets) directly.\nYou can have many iOS devices and the Air also connect over a wireless bridge and they will see the receiver that is connected via ethernet to the main network switch.\n", "Q: Where are Address Book group definitions stored and how can I delete them all? I know Address Book metadata is stored in Library/Application Support/AddressBook.\nI wonder, however, what's up with Address Book \"Groups\". \nThey are peculiar items. For example, I quit LaunchBar (it prevents deletion if it's running), then I removed all items from AddressBook, emptied trash, then started Address Book and watched Library/Application Support/AddressBook/Metadata get repopulated with the .abcdg files that define Groups.\nClearly, Address Book was getting them from somewhere! I was not logged into iCloud. I have the sense Apple doesn't like Address Book 'groups', I wonder if this is very old code.\nI'm trying to find a way to clean them all out because of an iCloud Debacle related to EOL termination leading to a cascading and comical failure chain (which established, in my mind, that iCloud is a regression from MobileMe, which is saying a lot - details here -- http://tech.kateva.org/2012/06/icloud-transition-went-as-expected.html).\nOne aspect of the failure chain is recursive Group creation (hundreds of replicated groups).\nAny advice appreciated!\nUpdate: one guess. I think they may be coming in from somewhere in a local cache of iCloud data that's not being fully cleaned out even after logging out from iCloud.\n\nA: I think I can answer my own question, based on further experiments.\nOnce you sync an Address Book with iCloud, the data is, in a sense \"gone\" from the local drive. You can still see it all in the usual location, but it's a cached version of the iCloud data. (You can \"move\" contacts back to the local drive, but Groups are gone forever.)\nOn startup, even if you're not logged into iCloud, there's a process (a bug?) that recreates at least the Groups, probably from some local iCloud data store. (I do wonder if Apple has 'social' plans four our Groups.)\nIf you truly kill all iCloud accounts, including from both System Preferences AND from Address Book, and restart, it is possible to delete all from Address Book and not have files magically reappear.\nThere are many tedious details on this and other iCloud topics in a long personal multi-update blog post: http://tech.kateva.org/2012/06/icloud-transition-went-as-expected.html.\nSuffice to say, these are coming from iCloud. If you never mess with iCloud (personally I'm going to wait for Mountain Lion!) you won't run into this bizarre behavior.\n", "Q: FTP app that can monitor a local folder I recently switched to another text editor from Coda. The feature I miss most from Coda is that it can monitor any folder and publish any changes made with a click of a button. I have been looking for an FTP application that offers this functionality, but haven't found anything. Most apps will \"synchronise\" a remote and a local folder by scanning them and looking at the size and/or timestamp of each file. Since many of my projects contain thousands of projects and I'm on a slow connection, this is not a good solution for me. So I'm looking for an app that can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Monitor files in a local folder (don't care about remote changes)\n\n*\"Mark\" these when they are changed\n\n*Offer to upload the files that have been changed since the last upload\n\n\nI only need to watch for local changes. I am the only one editing these files. So I can safely overwrite anything on the server when it has been changed locally.\nI can not use Git or any versioning protocol because most projects are running on cheap shared hosting, without shell access. However I am fairly experienced using the shell so if there's a solution there that's also an option, although I would prefer an app with a GUI.\n\nA: Transmit can achieve what you're looking for thanks to its Transmit Disk feature.\nOnce you have specified a remote location as a favorite (analogous to bookmarking it), you can use Transmit Disk to create a local volume with the same name as the favorite. Any changes made to this volume's files are mirrored to the server. The two are kept in constant sync.\nAccording to Panic's website (and my own usage), the files are uploaded even if Transmit.app itself isn't running. Transmit Disk runs as a separate background process. On my system, with one volume mounted and shortly after requiring a sync, this process is using 0% CPU and 13MB of memory. Performance, it seems, is not an issue at all.\n\nA: I have used Weex for uploading only the files that have changed since last time Weex was run. Neat little tool that can be run from scripts.\nI have tried a couple of GUI ftp apps, but haven't haven't come across any GUI tools that can do the same.\n\nA: There are quite a few commercial FTP programs that offer Local/Remote folder synchronisation, here are a few that I know of.\nCaptain FTP\nFolder Synchronization\nSynchronize or mirror entire folders/directories between local and remote sites in either direction through the Visual Browser Module.\n~~~~\nTransmit\nSync\nPanic's Transmit, my current client of choice, has a function called Sync which basically lets you pick two folders and sync their contents.\n\nA: I think http://www.yummysoftware.com/features/ftp-watcher does what you're looking for?

Nothing is original.\n\nA: There's a tool that can recover the restrictions passcode from an unencrypted backup, called pinfinder. Download the tool at the pinfinder github page, make an unencrypted backup and follow the instructions.\n\nA: It is possible, I have done it before on my sister's iPad, the passcode is stored in a plist file in the iPad backup. I will return when I find what the plist file is called.\nAlso note that synchronising with a computer will create a backup on your computer.\nSo I have looked it up, this appears to only work in iOS 4. I see a possible way around it in iOS 5 but I have not tested this new method.\n\n\n*\n\n*Find your backup folder. Windows: %AppData%\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\\ and Mac: <your home folder>/Library/Appli­­cation Support/MobileSync/Backup/\n\n*Open your iPad's backup - this involves a little guesswork (if you sync more than one device). However, you can check the date of the backup in itunes preferences, then find the backup in the folder with the same date.\n\n*If you are using iOS 5 here - see if you have an iOS 4 backup with the passcode. If you have an iOS 5 backup only backup your backup. I have not tested the following method.\n\n*Locate the file 662bc19b13aecef58a7e855d0316e4cf61e2642b (no extension). Open with a Property-List (plist) editor - link from Youtube. (Mac comes with a built-in one).\n\n*Look for the key SBParentalControlsPIN. Underneath is the 4 digits of the Restrictions Passcode. If you have an iOS 5 backup, you won't find the key and you need to do step 6 instead.\n\n*WARNING! THIS MIGHT BREAK THE BACKUP, BACKUP YOUR BACKUP FIRST. I HAVE NOT TRIED THIS, I CANNOT VOUCH FOR IT WORKING: - Locate the key called SBParentalControlsEnabled. Uncheck the box, or change from true to false, or similar. Restore your iPad from this backup. IF IT FAILS, REPLACE THE MODIFIED BACKUP WITH THE ORIGINAL COPY THAT YOU MADE, THIS WILL GET YOUR STUFF BACK.\nHope this helps, and sorry if it doesn't.\nSource: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaXtrSHfWi8\n\nA: This works definitely, either by installing the SSH client as in the original message or by connecting with terminal from iMac (at least it worked with my iPad 2 with iOS 6.1.2 that was jailbroken with evasi0n 1.05 and then installed OpenSSH on iPad).\n\nTo Manually Reset the Passcode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install any desktop software for browsing the iPhone filesystem (iPhoneBrowser/iFunBox/SSH/DiskAid trial version). \n\n*Navigate to /var/mobile/Library/Preferences/ and delete com.apple.springboard.plist\n\n*Navigate to the directory /var/Keychains/ and delete \"keychain-2.db\"\n\n*Reboot the iPhone.\nTo give you an idea on how this worked, the com.apple.springboard.plist file contains the setting of your passcode turned-on. Deleting this resets the toggles back to default (after the final reboot) and takes care of that part of the problem. But since a passcode was already defined, the \"keychain-2.db\" \n\nA: I don't know for sure if there is any way for jailbroken devices to bypass this.\nIf you have a backup, you can restore to it. The only things you will lose are any changes you have made since your last backup. However, you will still be able to retrieve any songs and apps downloaded via iCloud.\nIf you do not have a backup, you will have to start from scratch. Backing up the device after the password was changed will store the password in the backup, so there is no other option.\n", "Q: How can I start postgres automatically on startup?

How to get Time Machine disk to backup itself (ie, non-Backups.backupdb on the Time Machine disk)?\nSpecifically: I moved my /Users folder to a separate parition, a parition that also houses Time Machine backups (for my boot-SSD parition in /Users/Backups.backupdb).  I also want to Time-Machine backup the /Users/ folders, but Time Machine won't (thus far) let me backup folders/files on the same disk where the Time-Machines backups are stored.\nFrom one standbpoint, it makes sense to keep physically-different disks.  (I employ multiple Time-Machine disks for this purpose, including for system above.)  However, most backup needs are not due to physical-drive failure, but a \"logical/soft\" fault (usually me accidently deleting files), and as such, enabling the backups above would prove quite valuable.\n\nA: It sounds like you're trying to recreate something Time Machine already does via its \"Local Snapshots\" feature (see here and here for info).  Basically, all you need to do is configure your Mac to back up to an external drive, and then whenever that drive isn't available it'll make local snapshots instead (as long as there's disk space available).\n", "Q: How to remap 'Context Menu' key on external keyboard? I'm using a Cherry G80 (excellent 'clicky' keyboard btw.) on my Macbook Air. Everything works fine, I can use and remap all keys using Ukelele1 or directly in Emacs.\nThe only key behaving strange is the Context Menu2 Key.\nIt returns the same Unicode sequence as Control-P. \nThis is the output of Key Codes3 when pressing the Context Menu key:\nKey Down\nCharacters: \nUnicode:        16 / 0x10\nKeys:       \nKey Code:   110 / 0x6e\nModifiers:  256 / 0x100\n\nThis is the output for Control-P:\nKey Down\nCharacters: \nUnicode:        16 / 0x10\nKeys:       ⌃P\nKey Code:   35 / 0x23\nModifiers:  262401 / 0x40101\n\n(Notice the difference in 'Keys')\nMy goal is to use it directly in Emacs or be able to swap it to some other (modifier) key. Is there any way to do this? I can't find a way to bring Ukelele to do that.\n\nA: Bad news. Apple's XML DTD format that Ukelele targets does not support modifiers outside of shift keys, option keys, control keys, and command keys.\nAs @Lri suggested KeyRemap4MacBook supports mapping the Context Menu Key, which it calls the Application Key. In KeyRemap4MacBook's preferences go to For PC Users -> Change PC Application Key to see all the supported options. Mappings that may be of use for Emacs: Fn Key;  Shift_L Key; Option_L Key; Control_L Key; and, Command_L Key.\n\nA: This is what I've done to map the menu button on my keyboard to the option modifier:\nhidutil property --set '{\"UserKeyMapping\":[{\"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc\":0x700000065,\"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst\":0x7000000e6}]}'\n\nThe approach I used for to first find the key code for the keyboard button. Use https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2450/_index.html for the list of key codes. To find the key code for button I wanted to change I used\nhidutil property --set '{\"UserKeyMapping\":[{\"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc\":0x700000065,\"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst\":0x700000004}]}'\n\nwhich converts the button to the letter 'a.'  That way, when I pressed the key on the keyboard, the letter 'a' should appear in the terminal.  I kept changing HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst until I found the key code that I was looking for.  Once I knew the source code, I used the table in the link above to figure out what to change it to.\n\nA: The easiest way is to customize the key layout. You can do this by hand but I'd suggest using the utility Ukelele. I haven't used this on Lion so I don't know how well it works. If you want to do it manually (which I've done in the past as well) here's the tech note from Apple on how to do it.\n", "Q: Scrolling or resizing windows are no longer smooth on my iMac Scrolling is no longer smooth on my iMac, neither is resizing windows by clicking the (+) button.

I saw this message and I'm not sure if it is a sign of harddrive issues (corruption, etc) or anything I should be concerned about. It popped up in Photoshop when saving. Might also be worth noting that it is a file in my Dropbox folder.\n\n\nA: Most likely it's Dropbox. It could be that it synced to another machine, which added some metadata to it automatically, then synced back to your machine, so it looks to Photoshop as if it's changed, when only the file's metadata has. Unless this happens consistently with files outside of synced folders, it's probably nothing to worry about\n\nA: Do you have Fusion 3 or 4 running with the Adobe Photoshop plugin active? I have been reading that the plugin does embed font sense metadata into the document, causing the error. If you do, you might want to try to turn off the plugin and see if you are still getting the error.\n", "Q: iMac 10.6.8 pointing fail with Bluetooth enabled 10.6 Aluminum iMac w/wireless keyboard and trackpad.\nWorking fine long-term, no recent change to the h/w or system software.\nAll of a sudden pointing started operating as if permanently in mouse-down state.  In Finder, this means that the mouse would move around the last-selected object.  It is impossible to put the object down and so impossible to operate the Mac.  Restart doesn't help.\nI turned off the wireless devices, replaced the wireless keyboard and trackpad with old, wired keyboard and mouse, and restarted. Normal operation was restored.  Tried putting back the the keyboard, but pointing was disabled the instant I re-enabled Bluetooth.  Now stuck permanently as if in mouse-up state, so impossible to operate.  Fail.\nTemporarily OK with wired keyboard and mouse.  Ideas how to return the system to wireless keyboard and trackpad operation?\nTIA\n\nA: Problem solved!\nFirst, the underlying cause MAY have been an unusual circumstance: a smartphone (Galaxy Android) was placed next to the iMac, turned on and with Bluetooth enabled, and left for hours to charge.  Could this proximity have resulted in the Mac getting some strange Bluetooth input?\nFix:  Using the temporarily-installed mouse and keyboard, I removed the existing Bluetooth keyboard and trackpad entries. (I just removed every Bluetooth device.)  Then I used the standard procedure to re-pair the wireless keyboard and trackpad.\nAfter removing all Bluetooth devices, I could not get the Mac to detect any Bluetooth devices until I restarted the Mac, at which point device detection and pairing worked flawlessly.  \nMy best --and admittedly ignorant, sketchy-- theory:   Some mal-formed event got stuck in the Bluetooth input stream, causing the trackpad up and/or down states to be hyper-sticky.  That event couldn't be cleared without removing the originating device and re-pairing.\nHTH\n", "Q: Pages to pdf export results in a smaller page size, how can I make the page size as setup in Pages?

Even though both the sender's and recipient's address are in the USA, Cards (via Location Services) probably wants to send the card from France, which is absurd!\nIsn't there a workaround for this? Would disabling location services and waiting 24 hours work?\n\nA: The problem was this: under Settings > General > International > Region Format, I had selected France because that's where I currently am.

It does this during the initial file-system scan as it builds the list of all available files. The receiver then checksums its version of each file (if it exists and it has the same size as its sender-side counterpart) in order to decide which files need to be updated: files with either a changed size or a changed checksum are selected for transfer. Since this whole-file checksumming of all files on both sides of the connection occurs in addition to the automatic checksum verifications that occur during a file's transfer, this option can be quite slow.\nNote that rsync always verifies that each transferred file was correctly reconstructed on the receiving side by checking its whole-file checksum, but that automatic after-the-transfer verification has nothing to do with this option's before-the-transfer \"Does this file need to be updated?\" check.\n   -E, --extended-attributes\n\nApple specific option to copy extended attributes, resource forks, and ACLs.

I cannot use the iCloud on my old iPhone. I do not use iTunes sync and manage my iPhone manually, so would strongly prefer not to use iTunes at all.\nI was thinking placing the contacts on my SIM card, but iPhone only supports getting contacts from SIM and not saving them to SIM.\nI was also thinking bluetooth, but learned that bluetooth is only used for iPhone accessories and cannnot be used for iPhone data transfer whatsoever.\n\nA: You can extract your iPhone contacts and back them up to your computer via CopyTrans Contacts.\nThen use the same program to transfer the contacts from your computer to your new iPhone. \n\nA: Well... back in the day when I had iPhone i used to sync my contacts with Gmail.  Here you will find the instructions on how to do it.

However, if you're on a device that doesn't let you add a\n  second account, you could also use CalDAV to sync Google Calendar and\n  IMAP to sync Gmail.\n  \n*In the Email field, enter your full Google Account email address. If you use an @googlemail.com address, you may see an \"Unable to\n  verify certificate\" warning when you proceed to the next step.\n  \n*Leave the Domain field blank.\n  \n*Enter your full Google Account email address as the Username.\n  \n*Enter your Google Account password as the Password.\n  \n  \n  Notes about passwords: Be sure that you have a strong password for\n  your Google Account. If you see an error message saying \"Invalid\n  Password\", you may need to unlock your account by solving a short\n  CAPTCHA. Go to https://www.google.com/accounts/UnlockCaptcha. If you\n  are a 2-step verification user, please use an application-specific\n  password instead of your regular password in this field.\n9 - Tap Next at the top of your screen. \n9a - Choose Cancel if the Unable to Verify Certificate dialog appears.\n10 - When the new Server field appears, enter m.google.com.\n11 - Press Next at the top of your screen again.\n12 - Select the Google services (Mail, Calendar, and Contacts) you want to sync. To receive and respond to meeting requests on your device,\n  both Mail and Calendar need to be turned on, and New events needs to\n  be enabled in your Google Calendar settings.\nTo enable 'New events', sign in to your Google Calendar using the web\n  browser on your phone or computer. Go to Calendar Settings > Calendars\n\nClick on the Notifications for the calendar you want to sync.

This will also allow you to keep syncing with\n  your computer via iTunes.\n  \n  \n  If you want to sync only the My Contacts group, you must choose to\n  Delete Existing Contacts during the Google Sync install when prompted.\n  If you choose to keep existing contacts, it will sync the contents of\n  the All Contacts group instead. If there are no contacts on your\n  phone, the latter will happen -- the contents of your All Contacts\n  group will be synced.\n\n\nA: Another app to give a shot is Airbook (I wrote it :) ). It'll create a vcf backup and store it on your DropBox, Box, Google Drive or MS Skydrive accounts, where you can manage these backups too. It'll also help you import contacts from these backups by either adding them all or choosing before importing as a premium feature. Contacts are merged automatically.\nThere's also an emergency contacts access feature that allows you to view your contacts on somebody else's phone (which can be either iOS or Android based) in case your battery runs out or you lose your phone (requires at least one backup).\nHere are the links:\n\n\n*\n\n*Free iOS version, AirBook\n\n*Premium one for iOS, AirBook+\n\n*Free Android version, AirBook\n\nA: If you're a Mac user then the way to do this is PhoneView. \nhttp://ecamm.com/\n\nA: Very Simple! use Disk Aid\nI am attaching the link for your reference \nHope this helps :-) \n\nA: iOS supports the vCard format natively, so you just need to export your contacts to a vCard format. There are plenty of apps in the store that can do this, My Contacts Backup is free and seems to have good ratings, but just search for vCard in the App Store to have a look at some others.\nYou can email the vcf file to yourself, and if you open it in Mail.app, it should offer to import all the contacts.\nNo need for any syncing voodoo. That said, once you get a new iPhone, I've found iCloud has done a good job of dealing with my contacts, on my Mac, iPhone and iPad.\n\nA: I'm Michael and I work for connex.io, an address book app.\nWith our service you can easily do this.

I'd like everything to update and sync automatically (from Dropbox to SkyDrive) so that any changes I make in the Dropbox folder (add/remove/change to files or sub-directories) get reflected in the SkyDrive folder.\nI thought that a symbolic link between the top-level directories (e.g. ln -s /Users/MyName/Desktop/Dropbox /Users/MyName/Desktop/SkyDrive) would do it, but it's not working as I expected.  I only see the directories get linked, not the contents.\nIs there a better way to do what I'm trying to accomplish?\n\nA: Dropbox honors symbolic links so you can use\nln -s ~/Desktop/SkyDrive ~/Desktop/Dropbox/\n\nThis creates a symbolic link SkyDrive inside your Dropbox folder pointing to the whole SkyDrive. All files/directories stored inside SkyDrive will be available in Dropbox as well now.\n\nA: You can tell Dropbox to syncronise any directory tree in its Preferences see Dropbox documentation. So you could tell Dropbox to sync /Users/MyName/Desktop/SkyDrive.\nHowever I would wonder what happens when .dropbox-cache updates - does Skydrive update and then dropbox update ie you get a continuous uploading - this applies to any way you make the directories the same.\n", "Q: Is there an external bluetooth GPS antenna for Google maps on iPod touch WiFi?

I've installed an SSD as my main drive, and installed an HDD in the optical bay with a caddy, however I would like to blank the optical bay with an aluminium panel or something which I would assume could just be pushed into the slot.\nI can't find anything by searching for a blanking plate, so just wondering if they even exist?\n\nA: I have never see anything that covers the area where the slot is, so cannot really help with your query specifically, although I did spend a long time researching the whole caddy thing when I did the same to my iMac, and I've never found anything.\nHowever, I would advise you to blank it off from the inside, with some electrical tape or other, to prevent dust ingress through the slot.\nAny external blanking plate, (presumably to remove the temptation for someone to try to use the slot left behind?) is going to be more unsightly that the slot, in my opinion, unless it is perfectly machined out of the same aluminium as your laptop.  I'd be happy to ensure that the opening is secured from dust, and not worry about the aesthetics of a pointless hole, because the alternatives will almost certainly stand out more.\n\nA: I will not recommend you do this since it will degrade your wireless performance.\nThe WiFi and bluetooth antennas are located just off the DVD slot to allow more signal to come out.  Remember the MBP is a metal cage and wireless signals need a way to come out.\n\nA: Why not just measure the width and height, and get an aluminum part (or plastic, if you prefer) custom made.\nThis company make custom parts, for example: \nhttp://www.customlasercutting.com\nIt sounds like an easy template to create in a vector-art application. Still, if you have an accurate scanner, you could even turn your MacBook on its side, scan it, and trace the shape of the slot.\n\nA: Why don't you use duct tape? The color would match really nicely and it might even amplify wifi/bluetooth signals.\n\nA: Just use an aluminum soda can and a pair of snips to cut out a blank that you can place on the inside and the caddy can hold it in place. Or do like I did and use a combination of hot glue and epoxy to glue the piece of the can to the outside of the Macbook.\n", "Q: iOS Simple Counter App with multiple counters and data export?

Or does it rely on the Spotlight database for some of its search awesome-sauce?\nEdit: I'm considering disabling Spotlight because mds is currently in the process of re-indexing my just-moved home directory. I'd rather not have that happen during working hours. That got me wondering if I even need Spotlight at all with LaunchBar present.\n\nA: I've contacted their support and here's their reply:\n\n\nA: It does indexing separately, but has a feature that lets you pass a search directly to Spotlight. I assume if you disable Spotlight, you'd just lose that feature and the rest of the app would function normally.\nThis won't be the case for all apps like this though. Alfred, which I use, relies wholly on Spotlight for indexing. If Spotlight stops working, so does Alfred.\nEDIT: Just tested this. It seems like LaunchBar initializes itself with the Spotlight index. After that, I can't see where it's storing what it indexes, so I guess it's still depending on Spotlight, i.e adding to the Spotlight index, but doing so through it's own process.\nIf this is the case, even though it does its own indexing, it WILL be continuously dependent on the Spotlight index existing. You may not have to let Spotlight add to the index (via the mds process), but you probably shouldn't delete the index.\nThey really don't make this clear on the product site or in the docs.\n\nA: There's a checkbox for the Applications index in LaunchBar that says \"Use Spotlight index\". Uncheck that and you're good to go. I've used LaunchBar for years to find and launch applications on drives that Spotlight isn't indexing, and it works fine as long as you tell it not to use Spotlight. Even if Spotlight is active, LaunchBar works much better with this checkbox unchecked, in my experience.\n\nA: No - In the general case of all of the items in the index, spotlight is used if it exists. There is a special case for Applications where you can tell LaunchBar to not use Spotlight results and just specify folders to crawl on the filesystem, so you could certainly use the program with Spotlight temporarily or permanently disabled once you understand that the app launcher function can exist apart from Spotlight.\nLaunchBar depends on the spotlight indexing to make it's own indexes. For a short time, you can disable spotlight and just use the current LaunchBar indexes, but should it decide to reindex things, you will find that search results suffer when spotlight doesn't have a correct picture / index for the drive in question.\n", "Q: How do you stop screen sharing in Mac OS?

If I restore my iphone to default factory settings will it remove the ios firmware updates and leave ios in the state it was in when I got the phone?\n\nA: Restoring to factory setting will simply wipe out every bit of customization you did to it (every setting you changed from the default) but it will not downgrade the firmware.\nIn other words, if you bought your iPhone with iOS 3 and now you're on iOS 4, then a factory setting reset will still leave you on iOS 4.\n", "Q: Is it possible for me to use my iPhone4 microsim dataplan on an iPad2? I have the new iPad2 and am wondering if intead of buying a new microsim/connection from AT&T, I can just use the microsim from my iPhone4.\nPlease advise.\nThanks\n\nA: No, not since 4.2 can you do this because the APN settings disappeared off the devices.  \nThough, there are videos on youtube and tutorials in other places that can walk you through adding the features back on to your device. Whether or not they still work or will work for you depending on your current iOS version installed on iPad is a different story. \nA particular Video here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUnPQ68DNO8\nIf you read the comments though, it doesn't work for everyone, and some people it did work for had issues with their sim cards after about a week of use, with AT&T disabling them.\nOther people on here might tell you to jailbreak your device and enable tethering but that is your choice.

The answer to an earlier question, Access and control home office network, iMacs, and Xserves, left me with a new problem. To review, I have a computing environment comprised of:\n\n\n*\n\n*27\" iMac with dual cores running Mac OS X 10.6.8\n\n*2 Xserves each with 2 quad cores running Mac OS X Server 10.6.8\n\n*All networked over Ethernet to a Time Capsule.\n\n\nAs this question has more general application than the earlier one, I thought it merited its own post.\n\nI need to launch and shut down a service (in my case Wolfram Lightweight Grid Manager but this really applies to any service, program, or application) which needs to run on a server (or more generally, any other machine) attached to my network (or again more generally, any network to which one has authorized access).\nI need to have that script:    \n\n\n*\n\n*Access and log on to 2 Xserves on my local network and there\n\n*Launch a script on the Xserves that will in turn launch Wolfram Lightweight Grid Manager\n\n\nNote: I have this script. It currently runs from launchd when I turn on the Xserves. I just need to control its running and ensure it is not running more frequently than needed so the Xserves can sleep (the grid manager appears to keep the Xserves from sleeping).\nAt some later point, I'll need to do the same thing as above, but turn off the service on the remote servers.\n\nQ U E S T I O N S:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*How do I go about this?\n  \n*How do I get to a remote machine, especially as it does not likely have a fixed IP address?\n  \n\nI do have machine names and logon credentials.\nI've very rarely done this sort of thing.\nReferences or examples welcome.\nMy OS X server scripting never amounted to much, so any guidance welcome.\n\nA: So there are a few components to this, which I'll tackle in chunks. The most important is how to execute a remote command/script. As IconDaemon points out, SSH is the best use for this. There's even a pretty good and secure means of doing this without requiring a password, for automated scripting purposes.\nFor clairity's sake, I'm going to refer to the Xserves as the server and your iMac or other machine accessing them as the client.\nExecute a Shell Command on a Remote Server\n\n\n*\n\n*On the server, open the Sharing panel in System Preferences, and check the Remote Login box\n\n*\n\n*This enables the SSH server, allowing us get a remote command-line login. \n\n\n*On the client, open Terminal.app and type the following, then press enter: ssh-keygen -f examplekey\n\n*\n\n*This creates two files in your home directory. examplekey (the private key) and examplekey.pub (the public key). These are cryptographic signatures that will allow anyone with examplekey to connect to your server, without any password. For this reason, we're going to restrict what commands can be executed, but you should also be careful to keep the private key file stored safely, only on devices that will need to execute your remote script.\n\n\n*On the server, open /Users/YOURUSERNAME/.ssh/authorized_keys in a text editor.\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you're doing this with whichever user has permissions to run the script.\n\n\n*On a new line, enter command=\"/path/to/yourscript\", followed by a space, then paste the contents of examplekey.pub\n\n*\n\n*The command in the quotes should be whatever you want executed (presumably the script to activate/deactivate the Grid Manager).\n\n*If you have two scripts, one to turn it on, one to turn it off, you'll need to either combine them into a script that toggles it on/off, or repeat steps 2-4 to create a second key, so that you have one to turn it off, one to turn it on.\n\n*This command is the only thing that can or will be run; unlike a standard ssh session, the command= parameter doesn't give you an interactive prompt, it just executes the command and closes. We want this for security purposes.\n\n\n*Now with all the pieces in place, we can run the command. In Terminal on the client, type ssh -i /path/to/examplekey user@serveraddress and run it. If everything's been set up properly, it should run your script, then close the connection.\n\n*\n\n*You can omit the user@ portion, if the usernames are the same between the client and server.\n\n*The server address can be an IP or hostname. The second part of my answer will address how to connect over the internet, when you don't have a static IP.\n\n*If you need to use a non-standard port (i.e. not 22), change the command to read ssh -i /path/to/examplekey -p PORT user@serveraddress. You may need this for the next section.\n\n\n\nNow that you have SSH working, we need a way to run this from a remote computer.\nAccessing a Computer Remotely without a Static IP\nThere are a few different ways to do this - you can access your iMac over the internet through VNC/Remote Desktop, then access your servers across the local network as above. Or you can directly access the servers over the internet.\nEither way, you'll need two things:\n- A way to access your local network remotely, without keeping track of your IP.\n- Port forwarding to enable access for whatever protocol you want to use (SSH, VNC or Apple Remote Desktop).\nDynamic DNS\nThis is basically a simple way to give yourself remote access without having to worry about your ISP changing your IP. You sign up for a free service, which gives you domain name that points to your home network. To keep track of your IP changing, you run a client program that updates the service's records whenever you get a new public IP.\nI use DynDNS, but it seems they've discontinued new signups for their service. No-IP seems to be the best alternative.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make an account for their \"No-IP Free\" service.\n\n*Once you're signed up, follow the steps to add a new hostname. Make a note of the hostname you choose, it will be something like myhostexample.no-ip.info.\n\n*Download the Mac updater program here and install it on a computer that's going to be running often. It doesn't matter which one, since anything on your home network uses the same public IP, you just want it to be running often enough that it doesn't miss any updates to your public IP.\n\n\nNow you've got an address to connect to your home network, we need to configure your router to allow remote access to the services you need. This depends on how you want to connect remotely (SSH, VNC or a combination). I'll give a general example.\nStatic DHCP and Port Forwarding\nTo access a computer inside your network from the internet, we need to allow certain traffic through your router's firewall, and have an address to send it to.\nMost routers use DHCP to assign your local IP addresses (if you've manually configured your IP, you know this and can skip this part). However, they can be set to configure each machine with the same IP every time (called static DHCP).\nThere's a good guide on how to do this with an Airport Extreme here, but it should be nearly identical for your Time Capsule. Take note that the final portion of the guide is redundant, and possibly undesirable (the last three paragraphs and last screenshot). You'll want to do that for each computer you need remote access too (potentially both Xserves and your iMac).\nNow that you've got static DHCP set up, we need to do some port forwarding. Which ports you forward depends on how you want to do your remote access, but I would suggest forwarding SSH to both Xserves. That way you can use the SSH setup in the first section from wherever you happen to be. This guide covers how to enable it on your Time Capsule.\n- The basic concept is that you can forward any port accessed on your external address (the myhostexample.no-ip.info that we setup before) to any port on any of your external machines. So if you go to myhostexample.no-ip.info:1234, it can be redirected internally to 192.168.1.9:567.\n- For SSH, you'll want to redirect some arbitrary public port to port 22 on each of your Xserves. So you can set up (for example) public port 9022 to go to port 22 on one Xserve, and use public port 9122 to go to port 22 on the other Xserve. The public ports don't matter (you just have to change the ssh command to match), but using port 22 internally eliminates extra configuration.\nYou can use the same principles to allow other access to your iMac or Xserves (like VNC or Apple Remote Desktop), you just need to make note of which ports you need to forward. http://www.portforward.com is a good resource for this. Also note that if you're using VNC, it's not encrypted, so you'll be sending your password in the clear. If you have to use VNC, google \"VNC SSH tunnelling\", which should give you some good guides on how to secure it.\nWrap-up\nOnce you have all this in place, you should be able to ssh from anywhere to your Xserves and activate your scripts. Assuming you set up myhostexample.no-ip.info as your dynamic DNS and 9022 as your port forward, you just need to run ssh -i /path/to/examplekey -p 9022 user@myhostexample.no-ip.info.\nHope that works for you, sorry it's a bit long, but I think I covered most of the bases. Please ask if something's not clear!\n\nA: You'll have to delve into the mysterious world of SSH (Secure SHell).\nI once needed to have a FirstClass mail server execute a script on a remote backup server to start a daily backup process. A script on the FirstClass server first paused its mirrored mail-store disk, did some sanity checking to make sure the pause actually occurred, (backing up the live mail-store was a recipe for disaster), then used SSH to execute the script on the backup server to start the backup job.\nThe backup software then conveniently ran a post-job script which, through SSH to the FirstClass server, un-paused the mirror mail-store disk. Once I got the SSH details figured out, (the Secure part was the tough nut), it worked like a charm for years until Google took over and we had to drop FirstClass.\n", "Q: Can I \"fix\" Xserves' IP addresses on a local network?

I've my iPhone set to \"never auto-lock\":\n\nI am aware that this will mean I'll have to recharge the phone more frequently. But besides the inconvenience, will the \"life\" of the iPhone be affected in any way?\n\nA: Yes - since the battery is not user-replaceable and it has limited charge cycles, anything that causes you to recharge the device more often than needed reduces the lifetime before it needs a battery service.\nNow, it's quite easy to replace the battery on an iPhone for a technician and Apple offers their service if you want a warranty or feel uneasy with yourself or a local shop doing the work.\nThe rest of the device is likely to last years before aging causes the backlight to dim or the other parts to fail, so in that case I would say no - you can't really run out of the rest of the phone's life by preventing the screen from locking.\n", "Q: Macbook Air does not automatically connect to known networks after wake up I have a new 2012 Macbook Air (with 10.7.4) which doesn't connect to my own local network automatically after it wakes up. I have to choose my network manually and it works instantly.\nAny ideas how to solve this problem?\n\nA: I had similar issues with earlier versions of 10.7 as well as 10.6.  I can't guarantee that my problem is a match to yours, but I'll share what worked. \nIn both cases my network had somehow been lowered in priority in the list of \"Known Networks\" and the list had become a bit bloated in one instance. Ever since, I've made it a point to somewhat regularly visit and clean up my list of known networks.  \nNote: What follows may not resolve your problem, but it's a good step to take.  If it doesn't, I suspect that it's related to a more touchy Wifi issue for Macs running Lion. I recall that there have been at least 2 updates to 10.7 that addressed issues with reconnecting to Wifi when waking from sleep.  I've seen it, but it's rare for the Macs that I manage. \nHere are the steps that worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Visit System Preferences -> Network,  select \"Wifi\" and click the lock (if needed) to authenticate. \n\n*Assure that \"Remember networks this computer has joined\" is checked\n\n*Note the order of the \"preferred networks\" (see blue box in the figure).

During the configuration, I'd set the SSID before enabling WPA. This caused the macbook to remember the unsecured AP only and wouldn't automatically join the WPA protected instance. By removing the unsecured access point from the list from \"Preferred Networks\" (and ensuring \"Remember networks this computer has joined\" (as mentioned above) fixed the problem.\n\nA: Uncheck \"Ask to join network\".

My wife and I both have iPhones, we also have separate Apple IDs, but we'd like to be able to share and edit documents. We've looked at a couple of options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Google Docs - Since it's lacking a native app, it seems to be difficult to edit on the phone especially for spreadsheets.\n\n*Page/Numbers iOS app - It appears that documents created by one user can not be shared with another one.\n\n\nWe both have dropbox accounts that we could use to share the docs, but is there app to edit them? \n\nA: Short answer: Dropbox (preferably with Dropbox-aware apps).\nLonger answer: It depends a lot on what type the documents are, and what apps you use to edit them.\nAnything that only has iCloud as a sharing mechanism won't work, without exporting via email or some other means (which would seem to defeat the point). For the foreseeable future, iCloud documents are tied to individual accounts.\nDropbox is probably your best bet - either a shared account, or shared folders between individual accounts. The app itself can open files in whatever application supports them, but then you're dealing with multiple versions again. If at all possible, use apps that have built-in Dropbox support to avoid this.\nIf you're dealing with plain text, there is a vast selection of Dropbox-enabled text editors out there. Brett Terpstra has a heavily detailed comparison here.\nFor other formats, it may be a bit more hit and miss. For Office documents, Office2 HD and Documents to Go both advertise Dropbox sync, but there may be more out there.\nFor PDFs, PDFPen does Dropbox sharing, and is a great app. PDF Expert has similar functionality.\nIf you narrow down what sort of document support you need, I'm sure others can chime in with suggestions.\n", "Q: Does installing a second hard drive in my Mac Mini 2011 void my Apple hardware warranty? I just installed a second hard drive, and I'm wondering if that voids my warranty.\n\nA: Apple's policy has traditionally been that you can install RAM, drives and PCIe cards (on a Mac Pro), without voiding your warranty. However if there's evidence that you broke something during the install, they won't cover that, nor the 3rd party parts (naturally).\n", "Q: Install Windows 7 on MacBook Pro via USB?

Last resort will be sourcing an external superdrive, but I thought I'd ask if there's an updated way to achieve this.\nI'm running a 15\" MBP early 2011 and have a 256gb SSD in the main drive bay, and a 500gb HDD in the optical drive bay.\nI've edited Bootcamp's info.plist to enable it to create a bootable USB stick with the Windows installer and drivers on, but upon reboot, it comes up with the missing operating system error.\nI've also tried creating a USB stick within Windows with Microsoft's own tool, and used rEFIt to try and boot with the same problem.\nAnd finally I tried booting with a USB Freecom DVD drive and the original Windows 7 DVD, but that ends up just flashing a _ on a black screen.\nAre my only options really either using an Apple external superdrive, or a lot of messing about with VMware Fusion and reimaging with a cloning tool?\n\nA: Having exactly the same problem. It took a long time, and a lot of trail/error/forum reading to get to where you did (editing info.plist). I removed my 'useless' superdrive also.\nRefit has a utility to rebuld partition info as Mac likes it (after using gparted, in my case to grow the bootcamp partition as I made it too small), but after that nothing wants to boot into my windows boot usb key to run the final step which is the repair of the windows install/boot config.\nMaybe osx adds some boot info immediately after you commence creating the bootcamp environment with Boot Camp Assistant. I remember it always booted into windows until you finish setting windows up... either by 'Option' selecting OSX on boot, then rebooting from system prefs, boot disk page. Or rebooting from Windows bootcamp tools. This worked also into windows setup if your USB was in. Once you have done that though, nothing wants to boot off your Windows install USB. Not even refit.\nUnfortunately for me, that's where the windows repair utility lives which will complete the fix of my partition resize.\nObviously recreating the bootcamp partition would do it. But that defeats the purpose of trying to grow it without reinstalling windows in the first place.\nBloody hell, I already had to open my MBP up as the windows installer likes to fail if you have a HD attached to your Super Drive Sata port.\nMight have to wipe, disconnect OSX and reinstall windows all over. Paragon Boot Tune is supposed to be able to resize Boot camp, but the damn thing requires a superdrive to burn a boot disc to!\nOnly other thing I can think of is that refit ruined something. But I don't think so. FYI I also removed refit and can select the Win Boot Camp partition or Boot USB Key but they fail that way  also.\nAnyone reading this... make sure your Bootcamp partition/drive is at least 30gb. Windows takes 15-25 (if you include room to move for temp files, caches and updates etc. Then you got apps on top of that.\n\nA: Bootcamp will create a Windows partition from a \n\na USB flash drive that contains a Windows 7 ISO image downloaded \n  from Microsoft. Boot Camp Assistant helps you burn the image to the flash drive.\n\nSee the Lion Bootcamp install notes from Apple - similar notes exist for Snow Leopard.\nI have installed the Windows 8 RC using this method.\n\nA: I just bought a USB housing for my optical drive, and then I found this thread... But I did find something that might help anyone needing to install Windows without an optical drive. About to try this myself. http://www.andrewsavory.com/blog/2011/2156\n", "Q: Numbers: Count unique items in a column I'd like to count the occurrence of unique items found in one column of about 120 items.

As soon as I launch my Lion MacBook, hundreds of megs of updated documents, software updates, mail, notifications etc are downloaded.\nThis is desirable when I'm on broadband, but when I'm travelling and tethered to my iPhone, it's expensive.\nIs there a way I can block all programs except Safari from using bandwidth? I could dual-boot a linux distro, but that seems overkill, and I'd lose access to mac apps.\nThanks,\nBernie     :o)\n\nA: The easiest way would be to use an application such as Little Snitch; that way you can define rules easily based on whatever situation you happen to be in. It's also an excellent firewall replacement for the standard Mac OS X one, as well as multiple other uses.\nIf you like doing things yourself, or don't want to spend the money you could manually add entries into your hosts file located in /etc/hosts/ or create your own rules using pfctl or ipfw. I wouldn't recommend messing around with either of those unless you're confident using terminal, plus it's more work. \n", "Q: Will Time Machine back up new data and bypass OS back up? Since Time Machine will back up new data as a higher priority, what if the Mac's hard drive is 800MB full, and the back up drive is only 500GB?\nSince the OS system files are the \"old data\", will Time Machine back up the newer and newer data and therefore \"forget about\" the older data including the OS X system files, and that a \"restore\", if it is ever needed, will not be able to restore the Mac into a bootable condition?\n\nA: First, I must say if you are running Lion you shouldn't worry about this, as all Lion machines have a \"Restore Partition\". That is they save all the system files required to restore the system on a special \"section\" of the disk unaccessible under normal conditions. If you ever do want to access this Restore Disk, simply hold down the option key while your Mac is booting up, and you should see be able to select it.\nTime Machine, as far as I can tell, DOES backup system files. It full copy of your drive. Nonetheless, time machine backups are not bootable. You can save space by excluding system files, or any other big files you might not want/need to back up. Here are some articles that might help you with that: Time Machine tips and troubleshooting, Guide To Excluding Data from Time Machine Backups.\nIf you don't, time machine will leave them, no matter how old the data gets, and it would display an error/warning if you run out of space rather than deleting them. Time machine makes sure to always have at least a single full copy of your system. \nRegarding space, you can backup a larger drive with a smaller one, as long as your Time Machine Drive can hold all the space you are using on your larger drive. So if you have 800GB in your system, but have only used 200GB, you could back it up with a 500GB drive, though it is not recommended, because if one day you do fill the drive Time Machine wouldn't be able to have a single full backup. Nonetheless, if you keep your actual disk usage below your Time Machine Disk capacity, you should be fine, with at least one full backup. \nMy final recommendation is you check those articles and save space for your backup, excluding the system files (Time Machine backups aren't bootable anyways. You'd need an installation disk or a Recovery Drive.) and any other large, unimportant files. Finally, keep an eye on your backup, and if you find out you do need more space I really recommend buying a larger hard drive! Time Machine can come up pretty handy in times of despair! \n", "Q: Are \"generic\" Optical Bay Hard Drive Enclosures for Macbook Pros just as good as Optibay/OWC I'm looking at replacing my DVD drive in my Macbook Pro with an SSD.  The Optibay and OWC solutions seem awfully expensive compared to \"knockoffs\" found on Amazon and eBay.\nDo these knockoff products work just as good?  Does anybody have hands-on experience with these alternatives?\nDo you really need a caddy when installing an SSD?\n\nA: Yes, you need something in order to install a drive in the area where your optical drive is.  You won't really be able to do it without one. \nYou can obviously buy a knock off optibay at a lower price, I did when I bought my first one, and for the most part it does the job it says that it will do.  It was a cheap plastic little skeleton of a mount and did the job it said it would do.  \nLater on I purchased a newer computer not too long ago, I decided to buy the actual official optibay.  \nNow, I am someone who likes build quality, and the official optibay was superior to the knockoff one that I purchased before that.  It is light and wasn't just a plastic skeleton that held the drive like the knock off.  It was a full thin metal chassis that seems like it would hold it more solidly and not jitter around.  It was made of thin sturdy metal and felt more rigid, like it was going to last.  Also, when I purchased mine, it came with a free DVD drive enclosure, which works great and it didn't require me to go and acquire one somewhere else. I was able to keep the DVD drive and it even works on my other macs.  Pretty convenient but not entirely necessary. The enclosure was very bare bones and was plastic but it was a nice gesture and it works.  The Optibay is now only 50 dollars, when I bought it, it was about 100 with shipping and handling but came with the enclosure for free.  The enclosure is now a 30 dollar add on.\nThe bottom line is that though there is a difference between knockoffs and the official one, whether or not you will really care about those difference is entirely up to you.  The experience that I received with the official was great and it is backed by a company that actually cares about their customers and they test all the new laptops to make sure that everything will continue to work. If you end up buying a knock, just make sure that it will work with your exact make and model and year of your macbook pro.  Don't usually expect support, when I bought my first one, it was off of ebay and really cheap and I can't even remember the company it came from. Also, be sure to check the size limitations, the official optibay supports drives that are 9.5 mm thick, others may give you slightly more space or be slightly different since their are multiple knock offs out there. \nJust read reviews and research, you'll find the one that you like. Also, make sure that you also research about SSD in your computer and things that you can do to optimize things, it never hurts to learn as much as you possibly can.  \nGood luck.\n", "Q: Does windows installed via bootcamp only have access to the partitioned part of the HD?

There's three of us sitting in a pod and we can get a headphone splitter, but its a bit tedious.\nSo I wondered if anyone knows a way to share the sound output to other macs so that we can each listen through our own sound card?\nMany thanks\n\nA: There are certainly multiple ways to accomplish this, but what I figured out is the simplest free approach I know of: use SoundFlower (a free download from Cycling 74) to pipe your system audio to iChat, and use iChat to send the audio to another computer.\nIn your System Preferences go to Sound and set SoundFlower as both Input and Output. Note that this will make your system sound not go through your speakers, so to turn that back on also run SoundFlowerbed (the front end that comes with SoundFlower) and set SoundFlower's output to the speakers.\nNow launch iChat and go to Preferences. In the Video/Audio preferences you can set what input to use; it'll probably be defaulting to your microphone but you can set that to SoundFlower. Now when you do a voice chat with someone else they will hear your computer's audio.\n\nA: Is it essential that you all listen in sync? If not, you could use iTunes home sharing and share playlists that way, or setup playlists in a web based service such as Spotify.\nAlternatively you could set-up a shoutcast server on one of the Macs, and then use a radio streaming app to manage the playlists. There's a free (but simplistic one) called butt.\nI'm not aware of a way you could simply share audio to multiple sources without additional hardware.\n", "Q: Unable to unmount drive!

Does that mean it is already jailbroken? If so, can I just go ahead and use the apps? Do I have to jailbreak to use it?\nAlso the iPhone is used on my Tmobile provider and I was told not to update the iOS on iTunes or it will get locked to ATT and I will not be able to use it.\n\nA: It certainly sounds like it's been jailbroken, and unlocked with one of the tools rather than by authorised means.\nIf Cydia works, then it's been jailbroken and there's nothing you need to do.\nThe downside is that if you're not aware of the unlocking tools, or how to jailbreak in the first place, you either need to start researching these, or avoid doing any official software updates.\nThere are a great many sites which have guides, some good some bad, and some downright dangerous. I'd recommend http://osxdaily.com and http://blog.iphone-dev.org as the most reliable of sources. The former being a site which reports on developments, and the latter being the people who release most of the tools.\n", "Q: Renaming a populated iMac Snow Leopard external HDD a possibility? I want to place my iMac Snow Leopard Users Folder on a separate external HDD. It is already populated with data in my Documents, Downloads etc., and Media Folders. My problem is I have already named the HDD using Disk Utility. Is it possible to rename the disk without having to erase the data it contains, Just the name?\n\nA: Select the drive (just like any other file/folder) and press enter, and rename it just like any other file/folder\n\nA: Renaming an external drive is as easy as right-clicking its name in the Finder sidebar and selecting the appropriate option.\n\nA: Yes.\nSelect the drive in finder, press CMD + I (or right click and select Get Info), and you can change the name in the \"Name & Extension\" box about half way down.\n", "Q: Can I create a Windows VirtualBox image on a Linux computer and then use it on my OS X Mac? I want to try Windows 7 under VirtualBox on my Macbook Air, but I have no optical drive. Rather than going out and buying one, can bypass the optical drive installation by making a Windows 7 VirtualBox image on my Linux tower and then copy that image over to my Mac via rsync? \nAnd are there any VirtualBox configuration settings I may need to use to accomplish what I have in mind?\n\nA: Yes, you can easily copy virtual machines between systems.  \nThe easiest way would be to just create the virtual machine on your linux machine, and when you are ready to copy it over, you can export it as an appliance.  This will give you a single file to copy over to you Macbook Air.\nOnce you have the file copied over to your Air, you can then import it there, and you will be all set to try it out.  \n", "Q: Open terminal window on a particular folder \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I open a Terminal window directly from my current Finder location? \n\nOn Windows there is a utility which opens the command prompt on a particular folder.

When I start a new screen, the aliases that I have set in my ~/.profile do not seem to be sourced.\nDoes anyone know where I can change this or which file is actually read when starting a new screen?\n\nA: For an alias to work in ~/.profile the session needs to be a login shell. Bash, which is probably what you're using, is typically read from ~/.bash_profile.\nThere's a good explanation of the differences mentioned here:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/183870/difference-between-bashrc-and-bash-profile\n\nA: Apple uses ~/.bash_profile as mentioned above. If you want bash inside screen to behave exactly as the Apple Terminal, create a ~/.bashrc file with the command\nsource /etc/profile\n\nwhich will include all Apple settings. \n", "Q: Lost file when moving it to a \"All My Files\" Finder window By mistake, I moved a file in to a Finder window that I previously did a search in, so it was open on \"All My Files\" which is not really a folder.  Yet when I moved the file in to this Finder window, the file disappeared from its original location.  Now when I search for the file I cannot find it..\nWhat happened to it?\n\nA: The file most assuredly ended up in your home directory somewhere.  I was able to replicate your problem and the file I dropped there ended up in my Documents directory.  \nIf you don't see it in Documents, try searching for the file by name with Spotlight. Lastly, if that doesn't work, try issuing the following command in Terminal.app:\nfind $HOME -name \"filename\"\n\n", "Q: Time Capsule disappears from Finder My time capsule is disappearing from my Finder list (left side) occasionally.. it is very odd.  I have my iMac plugged in to it via Ethernet cable.  How do I force my iMac to connect to it when it misbehaves like this?\n\nA: If it's connected via Ethernet the most likely cause is the drive has fallen asleep and your system has lost its connection with the drive. The remedy: open the drive about once every two or three hours to keep it awake.\n", "Q: iTunes: move location of imported items I have about 23,000 MP3 files which I have imported into iTunes with the \"Copy files to iTunes media folder when importing\" setting unchecked.\nNow I need to move the location of these files - just moving the whole parent folder onto a new drive.  Is there a way I can update the location of the existing library items in bulk?\n\nA: Go to iTunes Menu > Preferences > Advanced (Tab).\nIn there you can change the iTunes Media folder location. Make sure you have your new drive connected first and select the location on the new drive you want to move it to. Press OK.\nIIRC it tries to move your files immediately. If not, after clicking OK in the Preferences window, go to File > Library > Organize Library. In here, check \"Consolidate files\". Then hit OK to start the process. It will start moving all your files from ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media to the new location you selected. Even if it does something after you change the location, you might want to consolidate just to be safe.\nThis process will keep your library intact, and relink all the items in your library to the new copies of the files. However, keep in mind that the iTunes library file itself (very small) will still be stored at ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Library.itl. You DO NOT want to delete that.\nIt leaves behind the original media files at ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media. After verifying that the copy was successful, you'll want to delete that folder, not the entire ~/Music/iTunes folder.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Any productivity tip for using OS X with only one arm, like Windows its sticky key?

So in first try it shows nice digits as a result, but then \"write\" (and only write) numbers become lower and lower, and fixing about 10 Mb/s. Is it mean that something non good with my SSD drive?\n\nA: mapasov pointed this link out for me to enable TRIM if you're using Lion http://digitaldj.net/2011/07/21/trim-enabler-for-lion/\nIt means that your system will handle TRIM as if it were a native Apple SSD, and that you shouldn't get the problem you're facing after the system has had time to manage it\n\nA: As AlanJC mentioned try Trim Enabler. Also its very important to check that you are running latest firmware on your SSD. You can see that under:\nAbout this Mac>More Info> System Report>Serial-ATA : Select the SSD and firmware version is listed as Revision. Get that and check if its latest for your SSD.\nIf you need to update it, there will be clear instructions along with the update on how to run it.\n\nA: Sounds like you are writing data to it faster than the controller's garbage collection can create free pages for writing.  Make sure you have plenty of free space and leave the system idling to make sure the controller has time to run GC.\nYou can read about the underlying technical details elsewhere but, as a general rule, OS X is sensitive to GC since TRIM is only enabled on Apple SSD's.\n", "Q: How can I tell which application is using the network? Very occasionally when using my Mac, I notice my internet connection slowing down. Using Activity Monitor I can see that it's because something is downloading data at the full rate my connection can support --- but I don't know how to tell what's responsible for it. It can be caused by several different things (Dropbox syncing; some app doing an automatic update; most recently it was a video buffering in a browser tab that I'd forgotten about) so it'd be really handy to have a way to tell which app is responsible for the network use. Is such a thing possible in OS X? Ideally I'm looking for a free solution. (Command line is OK.) I'm on Snow Leopard if it makes a difference. \n\nA: Firewalls\nYou could use Little Snitch or HandsOff. They are great firewalls and both have a \"Network Monitor\" feature, that will do the job:\n\nLittle Snitch includes a Network Monitor, showing detailed information of all incoming and outgoing network traffic.\nA status icon in the menu bar provides a summary of current network activity, and a monitor window with more comprehensive information pops up automatically in case of new traffic events.\nHands Off is an application to monitor and control the access of applications to your network and disks. Being able to monitor the normally unnoticeable activities enables you to make informed decisions regarding the transfer of your private information, hence avoiding confidential information leakage.\n\n \nThe network monitors of: Little Snitch (left), HandsOff (right)\nNettop\nA free and built-in cli solution (unfortunately it is not included in Snow Leopard) would be nettop. nettop groups traffic by program and port and measures various network statistics.\nOther\nThere are few other programs, that capture and measure traffic (iftop, wireshark, tcpdump), but they don't know the originated pid. To make the connection you should use netstat.\n\nA: You can try this dtrace one-liner:\nsudo dtrace -n 'syscall::recvfrom:return { @[pid,execname] = sum(arg0); }'\n\nLet it run for a while, then hit Control-C. It will print a summary of the number of bytes read from sockets, distributed among processes. For a more detailed view, replace sum by quantize. Or just to see a count of socket reads, replace sum by count.\nDisclaimer: I have only tried this on Lion, but AFAIK no great changes in dtrace-ability have occured between SL and Lion.\n\nA: sudo fs_usage -f network\n\nwill give you all network accesses by all applications (and processes). Usually the process creating a lot of traffic is the one which appears most often in the output.\n\nA: The \"DTrace book\" has a script, soconnect.d, that does this.\nCopy the \"Mac OS X\" version, paste it in a text file, then run it from the terminal with sudo dtrace -s soconnect.d.\n\nA: Activity Monitor has also had columns for received and sent bytes since 10.9:\n\n", "Q: Why does it take a long time to upload photos to Flickr using iPhoto '11? I take a lot of photos and use iPhoto to manage everything.  I also have a Premium Flickr account where everything gets sent to in order to have an online presence.\nWhenever I use the 'Share' option in iPhoto to send them to Flickr, no matter how many photos I try and upload it takes a very long time.  After a while it doesn't seem to be actually uploading anymore, but something is causing the process to hang, but I can't tell what.  It has currently been about 90 mins and with the absence of any progress bar or indicator I can't be sure when this will end, or why it's taking so long.\nUPDATE: After checking my Flickr sets online, two of the sets and several photos (about 50) are not yet uploaded\nDoes anything have any advice to figure this out?\n\nA: Maybe try an export plugin and see if it's any faster? Otherwise, it might be a limitation of your connection.\n\n\n*\n\n*FlickrExport\n\n*FFXporter\n", "Q: How can I create an installable OS X Leopard DVD from a running system? I need to reinstall Leopard on a computer although I don't have the install disks. Leopard is still installed on the computer. Also the disk drive doesn't work. What options are there? Can I create a bootable USB somehow?\n\nA: There is no way to create an installation disc from an installed Leopard system.\nYou can contact Apple for replacement installation discs. If I remember correctly they charge an amount for the service and shipping, at which point you might want to consider buying a more recent version of the OS instead.\n", "Q: A way to change NIC's MAC-address except with CLI ifconfig's \"ether\" option? Some ISPs do MAC-address port locking or/and use DHCP to assign IP-addresses to clients' network interfaces. Assuming you don't wanna bother calling them, what are your options then? If ifconfig's is the only one, where should it be called from so early during boot time that no Ethernet frame would ever went to wire with its original MAC-address?\nP. S. Alas, there's no 'mac-address' tag yet and you need at least 300 reps to create one.Thanks to @gentmatt, now we have one. ;-)\n\nA: You won't be able to permanently change the MAC address of the card, as it is hard coded on the card itself.  However, as you have guessed, you could create a script and run it at boot in order to change it every time the computer boots.    \nThis post details the steps it takes create the script and how to have it run when you want it to.  If you follow that, you should be good to go. \n", "Q: MacBook connecting to wrong network? My neighbors just setup a Wi-Fi network, and my MacBook is now automatically connecting to it.\n\n\n*\n\n*I've never manually connected to it\n\n*It has a single bar (\"dot\") of signal, my network has all 4\n\n\nThis is starting to get on my nerves, as I run lost of server software on my computer that I need access to from my other devices, and I don't want my neighbors to have access to. Additionally, I run a BitTorrent client often, and I feel bad using it on someone else's network, due to the high bandwidth usage. \nNote that I do have a terrible router that's normally sold for $10 now, and I do lose wireless for ≈ 10 seconds every hour or so, and it might see the other network as a good alternative to no network. How can I prevent it from connecting automatically, other than asking the owner to set a password?\nAlso note that my admin is quite paranoid, and I have very limited access to the Network. My options are \"Turn AirPort Off\", \"Network Name\", and \"Show in menu bar\". \"Ask to join new networks\" is permanently checked, and I have no advanced options. Might there be a \"forget network\" feature like on iOS?\n\nA: If you go to Network Preferences in System Preferences, you should see a button labeled \"Advanced\" click on that to get to a window with many different network options. Click on Wi-Fi at the top and then rearrange/delete/add networks as you see fit. Then hit ok and you should be good to go! Depending on your OS this may not work, I have no idea. I am on Lion.\n\nA: I discovered an issue with my home network similar to this. After scratching my head for hours (contrary to popular belief, I have proven this does work!) I discovered one of my four access points was set to WPA2 when all the others were set to WPA security. My devices prefer WPA2 to WPA, and so even when the signal would nominally dictate my devices should be switching AP, they were clinging on for dear life to the weaker signal WPA2 AP. now I have set them all the same and AP roaming works like it should.\nIf your neighbour's AP is set to 'better' security maybe this is worth looking into. I.e. you have mixed security on your network, your Macs get confused and connect to the unsecured network.... I know, it's a stretch but worth looking at.\n\nA: Just to add to Zizma's answer:\nIf your preferred network is already shown & you still can't connect to it automatically, delete it, by highlighting its name & clicking the minus button & then reselect it from the WiFi icon located in the menu bar.\n\nA: I had this problem too. It would connect to every network but my own! Like Zim stared to say, open Network preferences/advanced.  And I noticed that i had the \"Remember Networks\" box checked.  So it saved about 10 networks and mine was at the bottom.  I removed all networks and unchecked the box. Back to the from page I just added my network and it works great now!  \n\nA: I have a MacBookAir, so how I figured it out is: System Preferences >> Network >> Advanced >> click on WiFi name >> click on the - sign.\n\nA: Best option is what Zizma pointed out, so better get in touch with your admin and ask him to rearrange/delete the network. \n\nA: System preferences => Network => Advanced = > Drag Preferable Wi-Fi to the top priority.\n", "Q: During jailbreaking iPhone 4 shuts down and can't start again I have an iPhone 4 which I tried to install Cydia on, and everything worked well.

What could be causing this problem?\n\nA: Try plugging in to computer then press the home and power button, it usually worked for me.\n\nA: It hasn't shut down - DFU mode displays a black screen, so you might think it has shut down. Go ahead and do whatever thing you wanted to do in DFU mode.\n", "Q: How do you set file permissions in Lion? I just loaded Lion on my Mac and now cannot access certain files. How can I change the permissions of a certain file? \nI've tried to find the HD in Finder but it doesn't show up. \n\nA: The easiest way of setting permission to a file is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the file you want to change permissions to.\n\n*Hit Commandi.\n\n*In the last part of the information panel, just authenticate and change the permissions as you want them.\n\n\nThis can be achieved, too, through terminal with the chmod command. \nLion does not show the HD by default. In the General tab of the Finder's preferences just check Show this items on Desktop: Hard Drive, and it will be shown. You can also type ShiftCommandC to open a Finder window for the whole drive directly.\n", "Q: Why do Mac OS X ramdisks appear to be limited to 550mb and how can I change this? All I can find on the Internet is a one line bash command to activate a ramdisk. It is only 550mb and I would like to be able to create on with more space? Is there a way to configure how big they can be? If not, why are they limited in the first place?\n\nA: Here is the one-liner I found to create a ramdisk:\ndiskutil erasevolume HFS+ \"ramdisk\" `hdiutil attach -nomount ram://1165430`\n\nIt is actually two commands; if you run them individually, you get:\n$ hdiutil attach -nomount ram://1165430\n/dev/disk4              \n\n$ diskutil erasevolume HFS+ \"ramdisk\" /dev/disk4\nStarted erase on disk4\nUnmounting disk\nErasing\nInitialized /dev/rdisk4 as a 569 MB HFS Plus volume\nMounting disk\nFinished erase on disk4 ramdisk\n\nThe first command creates a block storage device in RAM, and the second command formats it with the standard OS X filesystem.\nIf you run df to see how much free space is on your disks, you'll get:\n$ df\nFilesystem                        512-blocks      Used Available Capacity  Mounted on\n/dev/disk0s2                       974509344 435640768 538356576    45%    /\n....\n/dev/disk4                           1165424     27376   1138048     3%    /Volumes/ramdisk\n\nNote how it shows that the RAM Disk is using 1165424 '512-blocks' (which, if you run df -h, for human readable output, you'll see is '569 Mi').\nSo, the answer is, change the number you specify in the first command, which specified how large the disk is in 512 byte blocks.  If you want 1.5 GB (or, perhaps I should say 'GiB', go as follows:\n           1024 MiB   1024 KiB   1024 bytes    1 block  \n 1.5 GiB * -------- * -------- * ---------- * ---------   = 3145728 blocks                                                                 \n             GiB        MiB         KiB       512 bytes                                         \n\nTo verify, I'll run the following commands:\n$ hdiutil eject /Volumes/ramdisk/\n\n$ diskutil erasevolume HFS+ \"ramdisk\" `hdiutil attach -nomount ram://3145728`\nStarted erase on disk4\nUnmounting disk\nErasing\nInitialized /dev/rdisk4 as a 2 GB HFS Plus volume\nMounting disk\nFinished erase on disk4 ramdisk\n\n$ df\nFilesystem                        512-blocks      Used Available Capacity  Mounted on\n/dev/disk0s2                       974509344 435460472 538536872    45%    /\n...\n/dev/disk4                           3145728     24696   3121032     1%    /Volumes/ramdisk\n\n$ df -h \nFilesystem                          Size   Used  Avail Capacity  Mounted on\n/dev/disk4                         1.5Gi   12Mi  1.5Gi     1%    /Volumes/ramdisk\n\nIt sounds like previously you could only create a RAM disk up to 2.1 GiB, but that is not the case in Snow Leopard and newer.\nAlso, there are tools to help create RAM disks without calculating blocks yourself.  I haven't used them, but here are three: TmpDisk, Make Ram Disk, and crd.\n", "Q: Executing program through Terminal I have Sage (math program) and I want to execute it through terminal.\nI know I can go to the directory and execute it with - \nopen Sage.app\n\nBut would I really want to do is simply type sage in terminal and have it run. I believe this is a fairly simple task, but I just don't have any idea! Thanks.\n\nA: You need an alias. Typing alias sage='open /PATH/TO/Sage.app' will create an alias which will do exactly what you want, run the program just by typing sage. The problem is that this will only last until you close that terminal window (bash). So, you need to create that alias each time you run a new bash. To do so, just: \n\n\n*\n\n*Create or modify a text file called .bash_profile in your home directory.\n\n*Add alias sage='open /PATH/TO/Sage.app' on it\n\n*Save the file\n\n*Load the file once by typing . ~/.bash_profile\nRemember that it will be case sensitive, so if you type Sage (instead of sage) it won't work.\n\nA: You need to create a shell script named sage containing:\n#!/bin/bash\nopen /Applications/Sage.app\n\nI suggest creating a bin directory in your home folder, and storing any scripts you create there. Save the script there with the name sage, then execute chmod u+x sage to give your user permission to execute the script.\nNow, the last step is to tell bash that it should include any scripts found in ~/bin in your path. To do this edit ~/.bash_profile. You can do nano ~/.bash_profile or use any text editor you like. Add this to the file:\n# Prepend ~/bin to the PATH variable\nexport PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\n\nSave and close .bash_profile, restart bash, and you should be able launch Sage.app by typing sage.\nEDIT: An alias, like the other answer said, is probably a cleaner approach (1 less file to keep track of) if you don't need the logic of a script and just want to launch the app.\nI've gotten used to doing it this way as most often I find myself passing a lot of parameters that don't change to an executable, but 1 or 2 that might. So I write the script to accept just those parameters and insert them in the right places when calling the executable. Just something to keep in mind.\n", "Q: Can I do iOS like dictation on OS X Lion? Dictation on the iPad is great.\nI can use Dragon Tree etcetera but would like to use an iPad like voice dictation program instead for simple tasks.\nCan I do the same thing on my OS X 10.7.4 iMac?\n\nA: iOS like Dictation...\n...currently isn't a native feature of OS X. However, Mountain Lion's new features willl include a system wide speech input.\nMountain Lion will come out this month (July '12). So you might wanna just wait a few more days.\nHere's the description by Apple:\n\nNow you can talk anywhere you can type. Dictation converts your words into text. It uses the built-in microphone on your Mac, so there’s no need to set anything up — just start speaking instead of typing. When you say “comma” or “exclamation point,” Dictation punctuates for you. The more you use Dictation, the smarter it gets. It learns voice characteristics. And it recognizes people from your contacts so it enters names accurately. Dictation supports English (U.S., UK, and Australia), French, German, and Japanese.\n\nMacLife also states how to use Dictation:\n\nTo use Dictation, open any application that has a text input area and position your cursor in that text area. Press the Shortcut key twice (by default, it’s the Function key).\n\n", "Q: Creating bootable USB for OS X Leopard I need to re-install OS X Leopard on a computer that has broken DVD Drive. Also I don't have firewire cable.\nSo I created a .dmg file from the install disc and then copy that on a usb drive using SuperDuper. When I check my startup disks from preferences I can see the usb drive so I select it and click restart. When it restarts I just get a grey screen and nothing happens.\nAlso as soon as I open the computer (and desktop appears), the flash drive opens and I can click on \"Install OSX\", same window that pops from the DVD. It asks admin password then restart and again the same grey screen. \nYou think the problem is with making the bootable drive or with the .dmg file?\nI had to convert the installation disk from .iso to .dmg using \"convert\" from disk util and then renamed the destination file to .dmg> convert.\n\nA: I've done a bit of searching, and found these two articles:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to Create a Bootable Mac OS X USB Disk\n\n*Make a Bootable Mac OS X 10.7 Lion Installer from a USB Flash Drive\nThe first article was written with Leopard in mind and does advocate the use of SuperDuper, much as you've done.\nWith that said, one of the comments notes that you need to partition your USB thumbstick with a GUID partition table, and, while not stated, I would certainly use the HFS+ filesystem for your partition.  Did you do it that way?  It also appears that you need a flash drive that is at least 8 GB in size.\n\nOne more thing to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your mac.\n\n*Hold down the option key at bootup.\n\n*Do you see your USB flash disk an something to boot off of?\n\n*\n\n*If so, you can select it to boot off of it.  (You can also hold down Command-V while doing so to boot in verbose mode; it should give you white text on a black background, logging details of what the computer is doing.  If you can get that far and it gets stuck, can you share some of what it says, especially anything near the end or anything that looks suspicious like it may have gotten stuck there?)\n\n*If not, it means that your computer doesn't recognize the drive as something it can boot off of.\n\n\n\n\nHere are a couple of more thoughts:\n\n\n*\n\n*if you have another Mac, buy yourself a firewire cable, boot the second Mac into target disk mode (hold down 'T' at bootup), insert the DVD into it, and you should be able to boot off of the DVD through the other computer.\n\n*borrow a USB DVD drive, and boot off of it.\n\n*just a wild thought that I'll throw out, but would be more trouble than it is worth for one computer, and it well beyond the scope of what you really want to do.  You could set up NetBooting to send an image file for the computer to boot up from over the network.  Buy Mac OS X Server from the App Store if you are using Lion (and download Apple's server admin tools so you can run Server Admin), or try out JAMF software's NetBoot Appliance (that will run as a virtual machine, under OS X, Windows, or Linux), and (hand waving here; you might be able to use \"System Imaging Utility\" in the server tools) set up a NetBoot image of your installer DVD to install the software.\n", "Q: Swap right command with right alt/option on external bluetooth keyboard I can swap/remap (only) the right command with right alt using Keyremap4macbook for the built in Macbook keyboard, but would the same be possible for the Apple's external Bluetooth keyboard?\n\nA: It seems to work at least on my Apple Wireless Keyboard. KeyRemap4MacBook should work with most external keyboards that don't have their own drivers.\n", "Q: Is there a quality difference between the unofficial iPhone replacement screens and the official? I want to replace my scratched up screen (GSM iPhone 4) and been looking into the options. I've seen that there are 100$ 'Official' replacements and the much more common eBay 30$ replacements. Is there a quality difference between the two or is this a case of which side of the factory these came out of? (ie. the Apple approved front door or out of the back door).\n\nA: I purchased one of the cheap replacements and it seemed identical during installation and right afterward, but it soon became apparent that the oleophobic (oil \"fearing\") coating  was either missing or very different. My screen is constantly filmy and gross and is extremely difficult to clean. It will come clean after a lot of buffing, but within an hour or two is back to being gruesome.\n(I'm at the end of my contract and will soon replace it; otherwise I'd spring for the full-priced one and swap it out in an instant.)\n", "Q: How do I sync my Google calendar with my iPhone?

Switching to another app turns the audio off except in this very specific case:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the power button to lock the screen. This will immediately turn the audio off.\n\n*Double-click the home button to show the audio controls.\n\n*Press play. The lecture will begin playing.\n\n*Receive a notification (e.g. a text message) while the screen is locked.\n\n*Open the notification item from the lock screen. The audio will continue playing while you're in this other app. \n\n\nUnlocking the phone any other way brings you back to the iTunes U app, which only gets us back where we started.\nIs there a simpler way to do this?\n\nA: I understand your frustration, thankfully, it can be done.\nMany video apps, like the YouTube app or the iTunes U App allow you to play the content in the background like music, it just takes a certain trick.  The way you do it is two ways, depending on if you want to sleep your iPhone or use other apps while you listen:\nExit the App and then double click the home button, and then swipe to the right to reveal the iPod controls, you should see the youtube or iTunes U app in the place of the iPod Music Icon.  Hitting play should continue playing the contents audio in the background while you do other things. Opening another music or sound related app may mute or stop the playing but opening up Safari or checking your mail, text messages, etc should not stop anything.\nTo have it play in the background with your iPhone in standby mode, i.e., like listening to your music while your iPhone is sleeping. Simply lock your iPhone, the sound will stop. Double click the home button and the iPod controls will show up, press the play button and the audio portion of your iTunes U or Youtube app content should keep playing.  \nI hope that this information helps you out.\n", "Q: Is picture location info retained when I share a photo? When I send a picture to a friend (e.g. via Messages, Mail, or Tweet), is the location information in that photo preserved? In other words, can they see where I took that photo?\nWhat about when I use 3rd party apps such as Facebook?\n\nA: Yes.\nThis is a feature usually only offered by professional photo software. Removing metadata (like EXIF or GPS) requires an additional step by the one that wants to share his/her photograph.\nAperture for example offers to export picture as either an original or a version. When you choose to export a version the  meta- and gps-data is removed from the original.\nI know from experience that sharing via the following options does not remove these and from pictures:\n\n*\n\n*Mail for OS X\n\n*Tweetdeck for OS X\n\n*Uploading via a web browser\n\nHere's what the metadata of an export as original look like:\n\nHere's what the metadata of an export as version by Aperture look like. This is an exported version of the same original. The data will differ depending on the export options for a version.\n\n\nA: No, the iPhone strips location data before sharing via Email or text message - whether you like it or not. \nNow, this is true for the standard photo app in the iphone - this may not be true for 3rd party photo apps.\nThe official Facebook app for iphone also strips location info.\n", "Q: H.264 encoded .mp4 not playable on iphone i have a video podcast that i've synced to my iphone.  when i browse the iphone through itunes, it shows that the podcast is on the phone.  when i open the 'Music' app in my phone, the podcasts don't show up.\nthe video is H.264 encoded .mp4 files, and my phone has 5 GB free.\nhow do i get the videos to show up and play?\n\nA: Does it play on your computer in iTunes?  There is a menu choice in iTunes that will convert to iPhone-compatible format.\n\n\nA: have you tried re-encoding the file with Handbrake or another encoder? The file container may appear compatible, but that's not always the case.

I've been using the Japanese keyboard layout for a while, but only recently I have noticed there are two options for the software keyboard layout, namely \"Kana\" and \"Flick only\". Can anybody tell me what the difference is, since they look and behave identical, as far as I can tell.\nThis is on a 1st generation iPad running iOS 5.1.1.\n\nA: It's like this: With the \"Kana\" setting, you can reach the different kana of one group by either \"flicking\" in different directions, or by repeatedly tapping one kana. With the \"flick only\" setting, only the flicking works, not the tapping. \n\nA: I know this is an old thread, but it was one of the first results I got on Google\n\"Kana\" shows a special keyboard with hiragana characters instead of the English letters. The iPad keyboard will show a grid with all the characters. The iPhone keyboard groups them by consonant to have less on-screen keys, and sets a direction for each vowel. You can either hold and flick in a given direction or repeatedly tap to get the desired characters (just like old 2000 phones)\n\"Flick only\" is an option that only on iPhones or iPhone apps running on an iPad (like Instagram) because that's the only way to show the iPhone keyboard on an iPad, and it deactivates the option to tap repeatedly, only allowing you to type characters by flicking\n", "Q: How to find out devices associated as iMessage client with my apple ID Is it possible to find out what devices have been registered to receive iMessage with my Apple ID? \nI can only see my phone number and Apple ID in iMessage settings, but not what devices are registered.\n\nA: \nItunes > Itunes Store > Click on email id after logging in (i.e. view account) > Manage Devices \n\nThat should get you a list of devices, that you have your appleid enabled on.

MBP 17\" has 2 audio jacks so I supposed the second one is for microphone but just doesnt work (Mac or Windows) and I gotta use USB audio card shipped with my headset.\nAm I doing something wrong or the other jack is not supposed for audio input with classic 3.5mm microphone jack?\nEDIT:\nI of course selected the Line-In device in preferences. The bar under device list wasn`t doing anything while I was talking, but when I was moving with the cable it blinked (I guess because I created some noise by moving the cable).\n\nA: Mac laptops have not supported a non-powered microphone input for years.\nThe input you see is a \"line-in\" input that requires more input signal level than a passive (non-powered) microphone can deliver. \nYou will need an additional pre-amp or active mic (a microphone with phantom power will suffice).\n\nA: Actually, if you plug in an TRRS plug (the one with three rings on it) into the headphone jack, your Sound menu will switch from \"internal mic\" to \"external mic\" and you don't need a powered headset.  So if you have a headset with two plugs, you'll need a combiner Y-adapter for that.  They're about $4.\nEdit: the TRRS plugs come on headsets like the iPhone headset as well.  Those work fine.\n\nA: If you microphone has a physical mute switch, this can confound the Mac a bit. If you leave it muted, it seems either the port or the OS eventually decide there is no mic there and switch back to the internal/built-in mic. \nWhen this happens, the only actions that work for me to get the mic recognized again are to: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open the mute switch\n\n*Unplug from the port\n\n*Plug back in again\n\n\nA: I recently had a similar problem.  I was plugging in a 3 ring (TRRS) iRig2 guitar device into my 2012 MBP.  This model has both headphone and line in jacks.  I wrestled with it for days but finally figured out that plugging the iRig into the headphone jack worked.  As soon as I plugged it in, my sound preferences pane changed to show an external mic as a new input.\n", "Q: Google+ hangout mic volume on iPhone4/the new iPad I'm trying Google+ hangout from my iPhone4 and the new iPad. I found that the mic volume is too small, participants can't hear my voice.\nIs there any way to adjust the mic volume?\nThere's no problem about speaker volume. I can hear others voice.\n\nA: Unfortunately, there are no options for adjusting Mic volume in iOS, as it's handled automatically by the audio subsystem. I tested this on my iPhone and where was no problem with the volume at all. If you have a case on your iOS device, make sure it's not one of the many designs that inevitably muffle the Mic by being so close to it. Secondly, I would suggest trying a pair of earbuds or Apple EarPods, anything with an inline Mic that works with your iOS device, and try a hangout then. If the others are able to hear you clearly with the earbuds/EarPods w/ inline Mic, but not so clearly when it's just the built-in Mic, I would consider taking it to Apple and at least have them look at it. It's quite possible your device could have a somewhat faulty Mic. I've had a few iPhones with faulty parts that were manufacturing errors, and Apple replaced them free.\nSorry I can't offer more help, but there's no options for adjusting the volume of the Mic in iOS, so I would look at eliminating possible physical matters.\nGood luck and happy hangin'!\n", "Q: How do I disable DVD player auto start when a DVD is inserted by using Terminal If anyone can help me with this it would be the best!

I don't have a PPC Mac, so I can't verify it.  \nIt also mentions that this will not last forever, as Spotify will update their servers at some point and not allow that version to connect any more.  \n\nYou can also try Spotify-0.6.6.10.dmg from PowerPC Software Archive.\n\nA: Some anonymous do-gooder has made an older version (it updates itself to 0.6.6.10) available right here.

Why is Finder being so picky?\nI already tried repairing permissions in Disk Utility.\nEdit\nSorry, forgot to mention that I'm running OS X Lion 10.7.4.\n\nA: OS X asks for a password whenever you try to delete a file because your ~/.Trash folder belongs to the root user and has permissions drwx------ — noone but root can read, write or open this folder. Being in the same situation I tried the command shown below in Terminal and it helped:\nsudo chown -R steve:staff ~/.Trash\n\nNote that I've changed my username to yours in this example. Also note that sudo command will ask you for user password — it's OK.\n\nA: From what I can tell you've got some funky group permissions. Normally your user membership would belong to the staff group. It appears you have only one directory with an ACL associated with it also (Movies). Usually the other main directories in your home folder such as downloads, desktop, pictures, etc. would have ACLs too. I realize not everyone has their system configured the same, so without knowing more that's all I can tell.\nThe following command in Terminal should add your username into the staff group:\nsudo dscl . -append /Groups/staff GroupMembership `whoami`\n\nIt also couldn't hurt to reset your password and ACLs by:\n\n\n*\n\n*(for 10.7+) Restart then hold ⌘ R, which should boot into the recovery partition.\n\n*(for 10.5+) Insert the OS X Installation DVD and reboot with the C key held down.\n\n*Choose language and select \"Terminal\" from the Utilities menu, \nthen type 'resetpassword' to open the password reset utility.\n\n*Select your hard drive and your user account from the drop-down menu.\n\n*Click the \"Reset\" button next to \"Reset Home Directory Permissions and ACLs.\"\n\n*Select \"Restart\" from the Apple menu and then see if the issue is gone.\n\nIf you still have trouble try the following:\nid \nthen\ndscl . -read /Groups/steve GroupMembership\nthen\nls -le@a\nand post the results back here.\n\nA: This might likely be a permission issue. Maybe you can check some files in your folder for permission using the terminal.\nSimply navigate into your target folder and type ls -l\nThen take a look at the left column:\n\nThe leading d tells you if it is a directory. Then you have 3 chunks consisting of 3 letters each. The first chunk is for the user, the second for group and the rest for other. And r = read, w = write, x = execute.\nSomething like rwx-xr-x would mean that user has all rights, group can only read and execute (not write), and other can only execute.\nTo be on the save side, you could set everything in this folder to rwxrwxrwx by typing chmod ugo+rwx * -R into the terminal. u for user, g for group, and o for other. And via the + you'll give all three of them all permissions. The asterisk is the wild card that stands for everything that is in this folder, and the -R (recursive) makes sure, that you also cover the subfolders.\n", "Q: How can I export Aperture projects to folders that are named according to library project names? I want to upload an Aperture library to a FTP/SFTP server for use with Zenphoto. Since Aperture doesn't have it built in, and since uberupload doesn't appear to exist any longer, I figured it would be fairly straightforward -- install sshfs and Fuse4X, export the Aperture library to a folder, and then drag the folder into the SSH mount.\nThe problem is, it appears that Aperture doesn't have a built-in function to export a library to a folder (i.e. if the library contains the projects \"Hiking\" \"Biking\" and \"Fishing\", there should be three folders created with the respective names and all the photos should be dumped in each). But apparently, you can only export a project to a .aplibrary file. Granted, this is really just a folder, and you can find the folders inside, but I'd have to manually rename every folder -- not optimal, since there are a ton of projects.\nShort of writing an AppleScript (which I'm somewhat resigned to doing), is there any solution? Literally all I need to do is to export the library to a folder structure.\n\nA: Found the solution: just go into the Photos sidebar item and export from there. All the projects will be put in their appropriate folders.\n", "Q: git auto-complete for *branches* at the command line? On my Linux machine I have autocomplete for branches with Git.\n[Note we are talking about git branch completion, not bash completion (e.g. commands, files, etc).  Thus NOT Lane's answer at all]\nFor example I can type git checkout+TAB and get a list of branches.\nOr I can type git checkout feb*+TAB to get all branches that begin with \"feb\".\nHow can I get this functionality on a Mac?\nI tried downloading and running bash-completion/bash_completion and bash-completion/bash_completion.sh.in but no joy.  The first gave error messages about declare: -A invalid_option.  The second gave no errors.   When I git checkout+TAB though I am still getting a list of files in the directory, not branches.  I am in the project root.\nAuto-complete for directories and bash commands are working ok, so it's specific to Git. \n\nA: Here's what's confusing some of you: you have brew or ports installed, but you are using an the system git in /usr/bin/. To check this: \nwhich git\n\nIf you see /usr/bin/git then either brew isn't correctly configured, or you've not installed git via brew.\nIf you install git via brew, then enabling bash completions for brew will also enable bash completions for git. This is because /usr/local/etc/bash_completion actually sources everything in /usr/local/bash_completion.d, and the brew package for git installs a git completion script there.\n\nA: Ok, so I needed the git autocompletion script.\nI got that from this url using the following command in the Terminal app:\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash -o ~/.git-completion.bash\n\nNo need to worry about what directory you're in when you run this as your home directory(~) is used with the target.\nThen I added to my ~/.bash_profile file the following 'execute if it exists' code:\nif [ -f ~/.git-completion.bash ]; then\n  . ~/.git-completion.bash\nfi\n\nUpdate: I'm making these bits of code more concise to shrink down my .bashrc file, in this case I now use:\ntest -f ~/.git-completion.bash && . $_\n\nNote: $_ means the last argument to the previous command. so . $_ means run it - \"it\" being .git-completion.bash in this case\nThis still works on both Ubuntu and OSX and on machines without the script .git-completion.bash script.\nNow git Tab (actually it's git TabTab ) works like a charm!\np.s.: If this doesn't work off the bat, you may need to run chmod u+x ~/.git-completion.bash to grant yourself the necessary permission:\n\n*\n\n*chmod is the command that modifies file permissions\n\n*u means the user that owns the file, by default its creator, i.e. you\n\n*+ means set/activate/add a permission\n\n*x means execute permission, i.e. the ability to run the script\n\n\nA: Run this on terminal:\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash -o ~/.git-completion.bash\n\nThen, do this:\nvi ~/.bash_profile\n\nAdd this lines:\nif [ -f ~/.git-completion.bash ]; then\n  . ~/.git-completion.bash\nfi\n\nThat's all. This worked for me.\n\nA: You could install bash and git from MacPorts with the \"bash_completion\" option enabled. It is probably the easiest way of maintaining both git and the completions up-to-date.\nhttp://denis.tumblr.com/post/71390665/adding-bash-completion-for-git-on-mac-os-x-snow-leopard\nTo install MacPorts: http://www.macports.org/install.php/\nAdditional info\nAs for locating the completion settings on your Linux system, have a look in /etc/bash_completion.d/git (it is a long file). Copying that by itself probably won't work, though, as it is designed to be sourced by the completion framework through /etc/bash_completion (which is sourced from /etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh; files in /etc/profile.d are sourced from /etc/profile).\n\nA: For macOS Catalina+, in zsh: \ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.zsh -o ~/.git-completion.zsh\n\nThen update your ~/.zshrc with: \nif [ -f ~/.git-completion.zsh ]; then\n    . ~/.git-completion.zsh\nfi\n\n\nA: git and git-completion.bash already come with macOS command line tools (xcode-select --install). To enable bash autocomplete, add this to your ~/.bash_profile.\n[ -f /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/share/git-core/git-completion.bash ] \\\n    && . /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/share/git-core/git-completion.bash\n\nThis will also enable autocomplete for git branches.\n\nA: Git autocompletion on Catalina and newer (using Homebrew)\nmacOs changed from bash to zsh as default shell starting with Catalina.\nSo you will need specific autocomplete scripts for zsh.  \nHere is how to install them with Homebrew:\nbrew install zsh-completion\n\nBrew's zsh-completion does in fact include git-completion.\nTo activate autocompletion you then need to add a small block of code to your  ~/.zshrc. You may have to create that file in your user folder if it does not already exist. Note: The output of the above installation script will tell you exactly what code to add, so read that carefully and copy from there in case it has been updated since my writing here.\nif type brew &>/dev/null; then\n  FPATH=$(brew --prefix)/share/zsh-completions:$FPATH\n\n  autoload -Uz compinit\n  compinit\nfi\n\nImportant:\nWhen installation has finished, read the output of the installation script.\nIt will instruct you not only to add code to .zshrc but also give you advice on additional actions that might be necessary, like force rebuilding zcompdump. But most likely you will not need the additional steps.\n\nA: If your git completion is partially broken, even after sourcing https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash, you may just need to update your git version.\nFor example, when I typed git check + TAB, it would correctly autocomplete git checkout. But when I typed git checkout + TAB, it did not display the list of branches, only HEAD.\nThe fix for me was to update my git version. I was on 2.7.0, which apparently was not compatible with the latest git-completion.bash. I ran brew upgrade git, which updated it to 2.13.0, and now it properly autocompletes my branch names.\n\nA: By far, the best reference I've found to solve this very issue is on SpinDance, by Connor Livingston:\n\nIf the git-completion.bash script doesn’t exist on your machine, please retrieve it from the link I provided above (which is this) and save it to your local machine in a new file called git-completion.bash in the /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/ directory. If the git-completion.bash script exists on your machine, but is not in the /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/ directory, we should create a copy of it in that directory. A quick sudo cp /current/path/to/your/git-completion.bash /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash should do the trick. For those who are curious about the /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/ directory: it’s for storing new completion commands, and you may have to create it if it doesn’t already exist on your machine.\nAt this point the git-completion.bash script should exist on your local machine in the /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/ directory. Now we’ll plug the git completion script into bash by pointing to it from ~/.bash_profile.\nNote: the tilde in the previous sentence refers to the home directory on your computer. Add the following line to ~/.bash_profile: source /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash and save. The final step is to reload your bash profile. You can achieve this by running source ~/.bash_profile in your current bash session.\n\n\nA: Tried it and it works well for branches but when you do git st + tab then it shows the error like this\n\nunknown option: --list-cmds=list-mainporcelain,others,nohelpers,alias,list-complete,config usage: git [--version] [--help] [-C ] [-c =] [--exec-path[=]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path] [-p | --paginate | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare] [--git-dir=] [--work-tree=] [--namespace=]  []\n\nSearched the internet and found that --list-cmds in .git-completion.bash was in latest version of the git and on my mac the git version was 2.17.2\nHere are the solutions\nSolution 1\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the version of the git by using git --version command\n\n*Then put the same version number in the url as I did\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/v2.17.2/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash -o ~/.git-completion.bash\n\n\n*Then follow the same steps as in the top answer, put the below code in ~/.bash_profile\nif [ -f ~/.git-completion.bash ]; then\n  . ~/.git-completion.bash\nfi\n\nSolution 2\nYou should try to update the git version to the latest then it should work.\n\nA: Some people prefer to use a package manager to automate the installing, updating, and configuring of Mac OS packages. I am a fan of package managers, and I think Homebrew is the best package manager for Mac OS (some would say it's the de-facto Mac OS package manager). \nOnce you have installed Homebrew, you can simply install git along with bash-completion with brew install git bash-completion.\nYou'll then need to put the following in your ~/.bash_profile:\nif [ -f `brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash ]; then\n  . `brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion.d/git-completion.bash\nfi\n\n(Note: If this install fails with a 404 error, and you already have git installed, just remove the git part of this brew install) \nMore info on installing git and bash-completion with brew here.\n\nA: Install oh-my-zsh and set zsh as your default shell and thank me later :)\n\nA: Most users will have git installed as part of xcode command line tools at /usr/bin/git and bash completion rules for git will be available at /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/share/git-core/git-completion.bash.\nIn this case no need to install git from Homebrew or source git completion rules from raw.githubusercontent.com. Just create a symlink as follows:\ncd /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/\nln -s /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/share/git-core/git-completion.bash git\n\nNote: make sure you've installed and configured bash-completion package from Homebrew.\n\nA: If you are willing to switch to a different shell, the fish shell has this feature built in.

Apache is typically user _www of group _www on MacOS.  Verify this with:\n grep -e '^Group\\|^User' /etc/apache2/httpd.conf\n\nTwo lines should be printed.  My output looks like:\nUser _www\nGroup _www\n\nThis means that on my system, Apache processes run as user _www with group _www. If you're using another configuration, check the appropriate config file for the same parameters and replace _www in the following solution if yours differs.\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the group of /var/www with: chgrp -R _www /var/www\n\n*Change the permissions to add group write with: chmod -R 775 /var/www\nThat should fix the error. \nAs an extra step, you can change the ownership of /var/www to _www and then add yourself to that group to maintain your read and write privileges.\n", "Q: Can I improve network speed with VirtualBox between host and guest? I use a VirtualBox machine with Arch Linux as development web server. I want to improve rsync transfer speed via smb://. What kind of configuration is best to improve file transfer/synchronization?\nWhich network configuration is best for speed between the host and the guest? \nMy config:\nIntel PRO/1000 MT Desktop (Adaptador em ponte (bridged), en1: Wi-Fi (AirPort))\n\nA: This is not directly the answer you are looking for, but an alternative approach that works wonders for my development environments.\nVagrant (vagrantup.com) is a tool built on VirtualBox which facilitates using virtual machines for development environments. Once you installed it, you can navigate to a local folder with your source files in the terminal, and initialize your virtual machine. Vagrant will map the current folder by default to \"/vagrant\" inside the virtual machine with read-write access, through VirtualBox's shared folder support. You could then point the webroot inside your virtual machine to a folder below there, for example.\nHave a look at the Get Started guide for more info on Vagrant. If you prefer Arch Linux, you can also find prebuilt boxes at www.vagrantbox.es. You can even build your own box from scratch, in which case you might want to look at this chapter in the manual.\nAs for portability, I believe it is not such a good idea to distribute your sources inside a virtual machine this way (even for a single developer). You should put those in a version control system like Git or SVN, and have a check-out on every machine where you want to develop on.\n\nA: Better than smb:// would be to NFS mount your shares over a private network interface running the virtio-net drivers. Once mounted, inside the host OS, you'd rsync in the data with:\nrsync /some/mount/point /home/myuser/\n\nOr whatever you wanted.\nSomeone already mentioned Vagrant and, on its own it won't speed up your VirtualBox setup, but it does make doing things like mounting in shares on your Mac via NFS export much, much easier than doing it by hand.\nFor example, here's a Vagrantfile that ups an Arch Linux installation and mounts your Documents directory on your machine via NFS using virtio drivers to /documents on the image.\nVAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION = \"2\"\n\nVagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|\n  config.vm.box = \"losingkeys/arch\"\n  config.vm.network \"private_network\", ip: \"192.168.33.10\"\n  config.vm.network \"public_network\"\n  config.vm.provider \"virtualbox\" do |vb|\n    vb.customize ['modifyvm', :id, '--nictype1', 'virtio']\n    vb.customize ['modifyvm', :id, '--nictype2', 'virtio']\n    vb.customize [\"modifyvm\", :id, \"--natdnshostresolver1\", \"on\"]\n    vb.memory = 1024\n    vb.cpus   = 2\n    # Uncomment this to run in not-headless mode\n    # vb.gui  = true\n  end\n  config.vm.synced_folder '.', '/vagrant', type: 'nfs'\n  config.vm.synced_folder File.join(ENV['HOME'], 'Documents'), \"/documents\", type: \"nfs\"\nend\n\nIt requires root priveledges to work. You'll need to add:\nCmnd_Alias VAGRANT_EXPORTS_ADD = /usr/bin/tee -a /etc/exports\nCmnd_Alias VAGRANT_NFSD = /sbin/nfsd restart\nCmnd_Alias VAGRANT_EXPORTS_REMOVE = /usr/bin/sed -E -e /*/ d -ibak /etc/exports\n%admin ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: VAGRANT_EXPORTS_ADD, VAGRANT_NFSD, VAGRANT_EXPORTS_REMOVE\n\nto your sudoers file via visudo for it to work.\nOnce you've put that Vagrantfile on disk all you have to do is cd to the directory where you saved it and run vagrant up and you're in business. To connect it's vagrant ssh or you can uncomment that line I left in there to run it with a display head.\nThat's the fastest configuration I know of for host/guest I/O with VirtualBox running Linux as a guest OS.\n\nA: If you're running into an I/O bottleneck, I would recommend putting the VM on it's own hard drive.  Either that or upgrade to an SSD for improved disk I/O performance.\n", "Q: Request for Comment - late 2008 MacBook as starter Mac I am refreshing my home technology stack and considering a Mac. I could use some advice about new versus used.\nI am currently running a hodgepodge of old 2005-era machines running iTunes, web sites, dev, etc, all Windows/Ubuntu. Want to reduce that footprint and maybe start learning Mac.\nA Mac seller in my hometown is offering a MacBook from 2008 for $399 with the following specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Late 2008 model, 2.1 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 13.3-inch glossy\nwidescreen display\n\n*2.0 GB RAM (upgradable to 4 GB), 120 GB hard drive\n\n*Mac OS 10.6 Snow Leopard installed\n\n*Comes with iPhoto, iMovie, Garageband, iTunes, iChat, Photo Booth and the Safari web browser\n\n\nBased on those specs I believe this is a MacBook 4.1.\nI'm looking for something which would support the following roles:\n\n\n*\n\n*Convert programs recorded on Tivo to iPhone/iPad format for transfer to devices;\n\n*Watch iTunes movies on TV (could connect directly to TV); \n\n*Experiment with XCode development - would like to learn iPhone app development;\n\n*Host an Apache/Tomcat type stack for internal development.\n\n\nMy questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right now price is more important than portability. How much future-proofing would I buy with a new Mac Mini for another $200? I am just looking to learn about Mac, I don't use it for work so not keen to drop a lot of money here without some experience. Not interested in the Craigslist route.\n\n*I know newer Macs are more user-maintainable but it seems like a lot of that changed during 2008. Can I upgrade this model's internal components myself, esp. the RAM? Have done lots of upgrades on PC cases, new motherboards, CPU/Fan, power supply but Mac is new to me and not sure about this model. \n\n*What is the software support picture like for the apps I've listed under Snow Leopard? Will I have to upgrade to Lion for XCode, iTunes updates, etc?\n\n\nA: From your description, this is a MacBook4,1 or MacBook4,2. They both have the same compatibility, and are essentially the same machine for considering the future:\n\n\n*\n\n*That MacBook will run Lion once the RAM is upgraded. It will not run Mountain Lion. Today's Mac mini would. The MacBook4,1 and 4,2 have less than a month before it becomes unsupported by the next OS. The Mac Mini probably has several years.\n\n*Macs are not generally user maintainable. (Edit: To be clear, I mean to the degree that you're used to.) The RAM in that model is user upgradable. I believe it's just three screws in the battery compartment.\n\n*You will need Lion for the current version of Xcode. In a month or two, you'll probably need Mountain Lion for the latest Xcode. Apple may ship the next Xcode with compatibility with Lion (say, 40% odds), but certainly next+1 won't be compatible.\n\n\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X Mountain Lion (Wikipedia)\n\n*MacBook Model Specifications (Wikipedia)\n\n\nA: With the exception of XCode, any Intel Mac should handle the tasks you listed. XCode is a bit of a special case. Apple seems to be doing this now:\n\n\n*\n\n*Users of the current OS (right now Lion, soon to be Mountain Lion), will get access to the newest versions of XCode for free in the App Store.\n\n*Users of the previous version of the OS (Snow Leopard right now, Lion soon), get access to similar versions, lagging by a few minor revisions, IF they're a $99/year paid developer.\nFor example: App Store currently has XCode 4.3.3 for Lion for free. Paid developers also have access to Xcode 4.4 and 4.5 developer previews for Lion and Mountain Lion through the Apple developer site.\nPaid developers can also get 4.2 for Snow Leopard (likely the last SL version) through the Apple developer site. Make of that what you will.\nA huge amount of 3rd-party apps, and many of Apple's own apps still support Snow Leopard, though a lot of them have dropped support for 32-bit processors. So you'll see OS X 10.6.8 or newer, 64-bit processor required often. That said, the machine you mention has a 64-bit chip and should run those apps on SL. And Lion costs just $30 in the App Store.\nA few other notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Given the specs, it's definitely a MacBook 4,1.\n\n*From my experience with lesser hardware (Core 2 Duo with the Intel GMA 950 graphics), this should run Lion well once you give it enough RAM. Because the machine you mention has the Intel GMA X3100 though, it WON'T be able to run Mountain Lion at all.\n\n*You can actually get up to 6GB memory if you need to on this machine. Apple only officially supports 4GB, but users have reported a 4GB + 2GB combination working. Of course, you will sacrifice some memory bandwidth since dual-channel mode gets turned off when you have dissimilar sizes of modules installed. The most significant effect this will have is on graphics performance since the graphics chip shares main memory.\n\n*These plastic MacBooks are actually among the easiest Macs to upgrade and repair. Much MORE maintenable than the current models (except maybe the non-Retina Pros). With a couple standard tools you can upgrade the RAM and hard drive easily and safely. With a bit more time and care you can swap the optical drive out for an SSD, repair the screen, speakers keyboard etc. Parts for these are readily available on eBay and sites like http://www.ifixit.com\n\n*At home we have 3 of these non-unibody polycarbonate MacBooks which I take care of, and are still in daily use; a 2006, a 2007, and a 2009. We've broken speakers, keyboards and screen bezels, all of which I changed myself. The 2006 had a faulty inverter which cost me about $10 and half hour to fix. Of course, RAM and hard drives have been upgraded over time, and we've worn out a few batteries. This sounds like a lot, but when you work the total cost of ownership, these MacBooks have been VERY cost-effective.\nMy suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*You really want Mountain Lion. Don't count on Apple to support apps and updates for Lion past mid-2013. This is especially true if you plan on developing anything using XCode.\n\n*If you really wan't portability, try to get the MacBook 5,2 instead. That's the 2009 (non-unibody plastic) one I use. It's Mountain Lion compatible, so you should get at least two years of life out of it.\n\n*If portability isn't an issue, definitely go with the current MacMini. You'll put out a bit more cash, but have much more power available, and get a longer useful life (~3-4 years).\n\n*The current MacBook Air, despite it's lack of upgradeability is an excellent choice for a portable machine. If I were buying a laptop right now, I'd get the 13\" Air with the 8GB RAM upgrade without hesitation.\nIf you just want to dip your toes in the Mac pool I wouldn't hesitate to get any Mac. Even older machines, which can't run the current OS, maintain good resale value. I wouldn't get anything that isn't capable of at least 64-bit Lion though.\nWhatever machine you get, if the OS does nothing for you, worst-case is that you end up reselling the machine at a slight loss. Just be mindful of the limitations if you buy a used machine with an older OS version installed.\nGood luck!\n\nA: The system you list could do the four tasks you list well enough. A Sandy Bridge or Ivy Bridge would do the video conversion a lot faster, since they have H.264 conversion in hardware. I wouldn't think a current Mini would give you a whole lot more, though it would include Thunderbolt for possible expansion options. If money is the chief consideration, this sounds like a good deal.\nLooking at the system requirements for Mountain Lion, MacBook support starts with the Late 2008 Aluminum. So you look pretty safe for being future proof. Mountain Lion will be out this month, and just cost $20. You can upgrade from Snow Leopard for that cost, and that will get you access to the latest version of Xcode. So skip Lion.\nAdding memory is not bad. You can actually upgrade to 6GB. That will make the system feel a lot faster. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1651?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US#link2\nNote that you can also boot this system to Windows or to Linux using Bootcamp, or via a VM. \n\nA: I did exactly that.  I bought a $400 4 years old mac last year in the hope that I could learn how to use a mac a lot better (I do ruby on rails development and the market share is about 80% macs), though I prefer Linux (ubuntu) myself.  I found that the $400 Mac was really just too old to be useful.\nI completely understand that $2,000+ is probably out of the question.\nI would consider either: \n\n\n*\n\n*a Second hand mac from 2010.\n\n*a Mac Air 13inch.  I got one for $1100 and this is my advice based on my experience.  If you want a 4 year Mac I've got one for $300 now ;)\n", "Q: Upgrading RAM on old MacBook I need to upgrade the ram on an old macbook. It takes DDR2-667Mhz. Although those are quite expensive (guess they are not made anymore?). If I get higher MHz DDR2 memory will it still be compatible and just run at 667? Are there chances that it won't work? Also what about 1067 DDR3?\n\nA: DDR3 ram is not pin compatible with DDR2 so you will have to find the DDR2.\nThe higher speed RAM should work as it throttles down to the speed that the motherboard can handle.\n\nA: The frequency rating on RAM is analogous to the top speed of a car, if it's max speed is (for example) 250 km/h, it can drive up to 250 km/h, but it won't break if u drive at 25 km/h.\nSame for RAM. As long as it's the same DDR2 Standard, it will run, regardless of how high the max clock speed is.\n", "Q: Are there any security vulnerabilities that would allow an attacker to change the admin password? A good friend of mine woke up one day to discover that someone had changed the admin password on his mac. It seems the same attacker also broke into his Yahoo email. Assuming he was on an unsecured network is there some kind of Mac OS X vulnerability that would allow an attacker to login remotely and change the admin password, even if remote management and remote login were disabled? How could someone without physical access to the machine do this?\n\nA: CVEdetails.com currently lists 783 vulnerabilities in Mac OS X, of which over 100 allow remote attacks, and many allow Admin access to be gained.\nIf you do want to ask about specifics, http://security.stackexchange.com welcomes a wide range of security questions.\n", "Q: How can I remove geolocation info from a picture on an iPhone? Since geolocation info is usually preserved when I share a photo from my iPhone, I was wondering what the simplest way is to remove this geolocation info from an existing picture.\nTo be clear: I don't want to take a new photo, and I don't want to disable the option that geotags my photos. I just want to take an existing photo, remove the location info (e.g. by duplicating it, while retaining the original size), and then send it to a friend.\n\nA: There's an App called GeoZapper ($1-$2) (or a free, limited Lite version), which will remove geolocation info from pictures.\nIf you know of any other apps or alternative methods to remove this info, please post them.\n\nA: There are various PC software packages that will strip the information.

Can one in principle get Apple TV to join/extend a wireless network even if that wireless network is from a non-Apple wifi router?\nEdit:\nBy that I mean: Can one control an Apple TV from a Macbook if the network that the Macbook has joined is not broadcast by an Apple router?\n\nA: The Apple TV is a client device, meaning it connects to the router. However, the current generation Apple TV does not have the capability to extend the network; i.e. act as a router.\nEdit: To answer the question you edited in, yes, you can control the Apple TV from any Wi-fi network, as long as it is a 802.11a,b,g, or n network. Wi-fi is Wi-fi, no matter what device is broadcasting it.\n\nA: Join: yes. Any 802.11 a/b/g/n network should work. Extend: no. The Apple TV can't extend any wireless network.\n\nA: Yes you can control an Apple TV from a Macbook even if the network that the Macbook has joined is not broadcast by an Apple router, but as others pointed out it cannot act as a router by itself. \n", "Q: Historically, how long does it take for MBP/MBA to reach the refurbished store after release? From the previous releases of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, how long is the gap between the devices being released and appearing on the Apple refurbished website?\n\nA: It can happen any time after the first machine exits the initial 90 day phone warranty. As soon as Apple has a used machine returned to them, it will be reformatted, cleaned up, and repackaged. Once Apple has enough to sell again, they go on sale as refurbished models.\n", "Q: Spacebar in Quicktime Player X used to pause video, no longer does in OSX Lion It used to be that pressing the space bar in Quicktime Player would pause a video.  However, beginning with Lion, it seems that it sometimes pauses the video, but other times it skips or jumps the video to a random location.\n\nA: The problem is if you use the two fingered gesture to fast-forward or rewind the video.  As soon as you do, you'll notice that the tab focus jumps to the position indicator.\nHere's a normal Quicktime Player control before using gestures:\n\nHere's what the control looks like as soon as you use a fast-forward or rewind gesture:\n\nNotice that the diamond position indicator is now blue.\nSeems to be a particularly annoying bug in the player.\n", "Q: Is there an iPhone 3GS app that stores incoming SMSes encrypted? I'm looking for an app which will store the incoming SMSes encrypted. Is there any?\n\nA: I don't think that's possible. You could send Encrypted SMS, though. So, in the end, you'll have them encrypted. Black SMS could do the trick. Extracted from Gizmodo's review:\n\nHere's how it works. When you download the Black SMS app, you attach a password to your message and then type whatever you'd like into the app. Once the message is complete, hit Send and the app will automatically open your SMS app. Paste the message and the recipient (and everyone else) will only see a black text bubble. SECRET AND ENCRYPTED BLACK TEXT BUBBLE, that is. The person on the receiving end then copies the black bubble and unlocks the message by pasting it into Black SMS with the password. If it sounds convoluted, well, it is. But hey, keeping secrets ain't easy. \n\n", "Q: How can I use an external HD to boot from in Snow Leopard? Recently my OS X Snow Leopard has been taking a really long time to boot up. Suspecting that something might be wrong with the HD I did a disk verification using the Disk Utility. It showed me an error message stating that i need to repair the disk using the disk utility from the installation disk.\nHowever, my CD ROM does not function properly and I am unable to boot from the installation disk.\nIs there any way I can use an external HD to boot from?\nAny solutions that you could suggest?\n[EDIT]\nUnfortunately I dont have access to another mac\n\nA: You will need a USB drive (8GB) and access to another Mac or a functioning CD ROM drive. You can use any external drive instead of a USB drive, but be aware that you'll have to format the drive and you'll loose any content on it.\nThe procedure to make the external HD bootable is explained at Upgrading to Snow Leopard without optical drive\n", "Q: Transfering files from PC to ipad 3 with out using itunes Just got an Ipad3 and want to transfer files from PC/Win7 to Ipad 3 with out using Itunes. \n\nA: In addition to iGameRam's answer, you can transfer files by either a dropbox or iCloud or other cloud solutions.  Depends on the file types and applications that you wish to use them with.\n\nA: If your question is like \"can i transfer files from PC to iPad 3 without any software\" then its a NO AFAIK.

This also happens when right clicking on the desktop or on an application in the dock. It's as if single clicks are getting counted as double clicks. \nSometimes, the cursor just disappears. It reappears when moving the mouse, but keeps flickering.\nIt's not a problem with my Apple wireless mouse. I also tried a wired Logitech mouse and had the same problem; so, it must be a software bug, not a hardware problem.\nI started experiencing the issue after doing a software update to OS X 10.7.4, but I'm not sure if this is the cause of the problem.\nI have uploaded a video of the problem here: http://tinypic.com/r/2vxk9af/6\n\nA: I've occasionally had problems over the years with weird mouse issues, and bar once, they were all fixed by deleting the \"com.apple.driver.AppleHIDMouse\" file located in ~user\\Library\\Preferences. Upon reboot the file will be recreated, and you can bak it up first in case it changes something. Software updates can sometimes change/corrupt plist files, and deleting them to fix issues is fairly common.\nWorth a try if you're struggling for a fix.\n\nA: I have also been suffering this odd double-click issue for several months.\nI think I finally figured out the problem for me.\nIt's iTunes.\nIf I have iTunes running I get odd double-clicks when trying to select files in Finder.

It appears that the special indent settings were accidentally removed, but luckily it is not hard to put them back. \nIf you did use the built in tool, it should be very easy to fix. Click anywhere within the region of the table of contents (this will select the object). Then click on the ruler to create the special indent setting that will control where the page numbers will go. That should do the trick!\nIf you ever would like to delete the indent settings, all you have to do is click on the blue triangle representing the setting you would like to remove and drag it out of the ruler and let go of the mouse.

Read the man page for full reference.\nOne way to would be to deny all TCP \"establish connection\" packets except those directed to gitserver, leaving all other traffic untouched:\nipfw add allow tcp from me to gitserver setup\nipfw add allow tcp from me to me setup # may not be needed\nipfw add deny tcp from any to any setup\n\nThe rules will be lost on reboot, so they must be set on every boot (e.g. from /etc/rc.common or crontab's @reboot).\nIf that seems too complicated, get a third party firewall. Little Snitch is a good one, but it costs another $30 :)\n\nA: A little outside-the-box thought: Put a second network card into gitserver and connect the machine via that. Of course, routing should be disabled on gitserver.\nAlternatively, assign your machine the IP 192.168.1.2, netmask 255.255.255.252 and leave the \"router\" field empty. This basically means your machine can communicate directly only with 192.168.1.1 and if there is no router configured, it doesn't know how to reach the outside world.\nFor both of these approaches, you need to be sure you don't need anything from \"outside\" - DNS, NTP, AppStore and application updates via network will not work with those setups.\n", "Q: What WiFi adapter can I use to monitor a WiFi network on OS X from a MBP?

Keeping it fully charged isn't a realistic option.\nThis phone is running the final version available for it, iOS 4.2.1 (8C148).\nMy question, then: Can I make this work? Failing that, is there documentation available that says once and for all that it can't be made to work?\n\nA: \"Set Automatically\" takes the time from the cellular network. If you remove the SIM card (or just keep the phone in airplane mode with Wi-Fi enable), the time will never get updated.\nFrom the iPhone User Guide (available in iTunes):\n\nIf iPhone is set to update the time automatically, it gets the correct time over the cellular network and updates it for the time zone you’re in.\nSome carriers don’t support network time in all areas. If you’re traveling, iPhone may not be able to automatically set the local time.\n\n\nA: You can also turn off 3G Cellular and set manually.\n", "Q: Creating folders from the Open File dialog I need to know how to create client file folders and reference or matter subfolders to be saved within each client folder from within the Open File dialog.\nFor example, \"Smith Manufacturing Corp.\" would be the master client folder. Within that folder, I would like to create subfolders for each matter the lawyer is addressing for that client, for example: \"Agreement with Jones Demolition Co.\" or \"Purchase of Main Street Property\" and so on.  I was able to do that quite easily with Microsoft Word on my PC. \nFolder structure diagram:\n- Smith Manufacturing Corp\n  + Agreement with Jones Demolition Co.\n  + Purchase of Main Street Property\n\n\nA: This cannot be done from the Open dialog on the Mac. It, however, can be done from the \"Save\" dialog.\nEnter the \"Save\" dialog (in Word, it's usually shown as a sheet). If you don't see the file tree, click the down-arrow next to the filename box (it's circled in the below image).\n\nIn the expanded window, navigate to the folder where you have your client information. To make a new folder, click the \"New Folder\" button in the lower-left of the sheet (again, circled in the below image).\n\n(Screenshot examples from Word 2011.)\n\nA: This cannot be done with macOS's built in capabilities, but you can do it with recent versions (v5.1) of Default Folder X\n", "Q: Search all hidden .htaccess files inside a folder and run a terminal command? Searching for the issue, I found this Q&A:\nHow can I show only an .htaccess file in the Finder?\n\n[...] you could create a symlink to the file in its directory, omitting the dot in the name:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*open Terminal, cd into your folder \n  \n*ln -s $PWD/.htaccess $PWD/htaccess\n\nIs there some kind of terminal batch to search for all .htaccess files inside a folder (i.e.: /public_html) and apply the symlink?\nOr would it be a combination of Automator and Terminal?\n\nA: Change to the initial directory (public_html in the question) and run\nfind . -name '.htaccess' -print | while read f; do\n    ln -s \"$PWD/$f\" \"$PWD/${f//.htaccess}htaccess\"\ndone\n\nPS: I did some rudimentary testing but please make a backup before you run it anyway.\n", "Q: Will updating my iPod delete my files? I am going to update my iPod to the newest software and was wondering if this will delete the files?\nMost of my songs are from my old computer which I now longer have, so I no longer have the songs in iTunes. If I try to back up my files will it only do the ones from my current iTunes and delete the rest?\n\nA: No. Upgrading iOS should leave the files that are on the device in the exact same condition as it was before. That said, however, it is always important to do a backup of all the data on the device before upgrading. \nWhen you plug your device in, open iTunes, and select the backup option, it should backup all the data that is on your device, including any music that is not in your current library. Note that this will not add that music to your library, though, it just saves it in case you happen to need to restore your device at a later date.\n", "Q: Recovering an accidentally deleted  folder in OSX - no Time Machine or backup available  I am a longtime Windows user, recently switched to Mac. I replaced folder with another folder (they had the same name) thinking that OS X will merge the contents of both folders. But OS X deleted the original folder and replaced it with the new one. Windows merges both the folders (I do this often in Windows). I have now lost hundreds of files. I haven't enabled Time Machine. I've tried using Finder's Undo, but that doesn't work.\nCurrently, I am trying to recover my data using photorec. It shows estimated time as 7 hours, 31 minutes. Does anyone know any free data recovery software that's faster and more powerful?\n\nA: Data Rescue is a long time favorite for undeleting files. It is not free, but you can download a free trial to see if the folder and files can be recreated before deciding to pay for the software or seeking professional recovery.\nTo be safe, I like to use macOS recovery to install a new OS on a blank external drive so that I stop making any changes to the affected disk until recovery efforts are complete.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/intro-to-macos-recovery-mchl46d531d6/mac\nSimilar to Windows, OS X and now macOS doesn't wipe the files but instead marks the directory entries as free. This is the same for when you make changes to the partition table, most data does not get overwritten immediately.  As long as the files do not get overwritten (say you powered off the Mac immediately after the error was performed) you should get most of the files back. It all depends on chance that the system didn't overwrite the files as part of the normal shutdown process.\n\nA: Other than testdisk and photorec, I haven't found any free data recovery tools. I managed to reduce the recovery time in photorec by selecting only the file formats that I wanted to recover. Photorec recovered more than 5000 files but only a few were useful to me.\n\nA: FileSalvage has always been my first choice.  It has a free version that allows you to see what it can recover before purchasing it.\nYou will find that in some cases, one app can recover more than another and in other cases, the other app is better suited.  Try them all as most offer free trials and see which one works best.  FileSalvage and Data Rescue are the two top ones by far though.\n\nA: I usually use Clever Files Disk Drill application. Have always had good results. It has deep sector scans, but is a paid application. There is a fremium version that is avail. on the website\n", "Q: How do I restart Messages daemon on OS X Lion? From times to times my Messages on OS X Lion gets crazy and will not load when I try to run it.\nWhen that happens I need to restart OS X and it will work again.\nIs there a way to avoid restarting and simply restart Messages daemon/whatever it is? Is there a command to do that on terminal?\n\nThis is the list of all daemons running on my machine... I cannot see messages there, but I have it running...\nPID Status  Label\n-   0   com.apple.cfpreferences-xpcservice\n-   0   com.apple.qtkitserver\n-   0   com.apple.cmio.registerassistantservice\n1   -

Below is a general answer.\n$ sudo launchctl list might help you to get a list of running daemons. When the first column (PID) is actually not a minus-sign, than it is running. Otherwise the launchd job is loaded and waiting in the background to be started on the corresponding event.\nOne of the output lines could be:\n33  -   com.apple.notifyd\n\nNext you need to find where its plist file is stored.\n$ locate com.apple.notifyd\n\nHelps here, with output:\n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.notifyd.plist\n...\n\nFinally the command to restart is:\n$ sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.notifyd.plist;sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.notifyd.plist\n\n", "Q: iTunes 10.6.3 opens every time I put in an audio CD In system preferences> CDs & DVDs I have everything set to ignore.

Can an iPad somehow connect the iPad Camera Connector AND be plugged into power simultaneously?\nI need to use the USB port AND have the iPad connected to a power source.  Possible?\n\nA: Not with Apple's own kit, but you can find various adapters on places like ebay which do what you want. My friend has one similar to this which appears to work fine (on iOS 5.1.1 at least).\n", "Q: Limit processor speed like in Windows In Windows (Linux too), you have the very useful \"Power saver\" mode that limits the maximum frequency at which your CPU runs.\n\nIs there something similar in OS X?\n\nA: No. OS X doesn't have a CPU or even GPU throttling lever that users can toggle.\nThere is a nice app, gfxCardStatus to know which of the two GPU is engaged on Macs that have two options. It also allows pinning to the higher or lower power consumption which might be of use. It's not clear if there is no way to get past the OS to exercise control of the CPU or just that no-one has programmed it yet.\n\nA: Mac OS X has SpeedStep built into the kernel and enabled since OS X 10.4, and, as already has been said, it can no longer be controlled through the System Preferences. There are, though, some applications which will let you configure and set specific clock speeds. All of which I could find, such as CoolBook, do not work on Lion nor support the latest processors.\nI could find, though, CPULimit. A script / tool  which will let you control the usage of a specific process. \n\nA: Though Windows and Mac OS X run on x86 platforms , AFAIK, power consumption is handled differently in both the OSes and in Mac OS X it is slightly better. It is better not to use third party tools to manipulate CPU speeds as far as possible. Cheers\n\nA: In fact , there is GPU power state management in Mac OS X. The kext responsible is AppleGraphicsPowerManagement.kext into Extension Folder.\nAccording to the GPU Core Throttle % ,changes the Power States from 0-4.

Does this option exist on the Mac Word 2011?\n\nA: I realize this is a very old question, but here goes.  The option to change to linear allows for copying as plain text.  This option can be found in the Equation ribbon.  Also, the Equation box dropdown has the change option as well.\n\n\n", "Q: How can I map keyboard keys to other keyboard keys in an app specific manner? I would like to have some way to specify that when I am focused on Spotify.app and I press the j key that it will translate into a ↓ key and be sent to the app. I would like this because I like vim style navigation but Spotify  does not support remapping keyboard shortcuts.\n\nA: @iGameRam's suggestion of KeyRemap4MacBook ended up working for me. I selected KeyRemap4MacBook because I am already using it to remap keys for me system wide. To do this I had to read the reference manual.\nFrom the reference manual I found that there is a private.xml file that enables me to add more remapping values to KeyRemap4MacBook. By going to the KeyRemap4MacBook pref pane, going to the \"Misc & Uninstall\" tab and selecting \"Open private.xml\" I was able to open the file.\nI had to add two elements to my private.xml. The first was:\n<appdef>\n  <appname>SPOTIFY</appname>\n  <equal>com.spotify.client</equal>\n</appdef>\n\nThis is because KeyRemap4MacBook does not ship with an app definition for Spotify. It does ship with many others. I need the app definition so my keyboard keybindings only apply for Spotify and are not system wide.\nThe second element I added was:\n<item>\n  <name>Spotify Vim Style Nav</name>\n  <appendix>J and K works in Spotify</appendix>\n  <identifier>private.spotify.vim_style_nav</identifier>\n  <only>SPOTIFY</only>\n  <autogen>--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::J, KeyCode::CURSOR_DOWN</autogen>\n  <autogen>--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::K, KeyCode::CURSOR_UP</autogen>\n</item>\n\nThis is the actual definition of the key bindings. The <identifier> tag is supposed to be unique for every key mapping. The manual suggests prefixing the identifier with private.. The <only> tag has to match an appname defined in the private.xml or shipped with KeyRemap4MacBook.\nThe <autogen> tags are supposed to contain the mappings. The manual has many examples on what kind of mappings that can be created. The two I have map the J and K keys to the Down and Up keys respectively.\nOnce the file has been saved, I just needed to press the \"ReloadXML\" button and then my mapping appeared as an option in the menu.\nAfter selecting it everything worked as I wanted.\n\n\nA: There are a couple of third party apps that can do what you are asking for (as i understood it ) , KeyRemap , Double Command . Please try this and let us know if this is what you were looking for.\n\nA: If the action you want to perform can also be accessed through the menubar you could add a keyboard shortcut in system preferences/keyboard/keyboard shortcuts/Application short cuts. \n\nA: I know it works for controllers to keyboard, not sure about keyboard to keyboard, but you can try ControllerMate.\n\nControllerMate is a system that generates keyboard, mouse, and MIDI activity in response to triggers from gamepads, keypads, MIDI controllers, and other general-purpose input devices. It allows many types of devices to be used with software that would normally be compatible only with a keyboard, mouse, or MIDI source.\nControllerMate's internal devices generate activity based on a system of building blocks. Some building blocks respond to controls on input devices, other blocks trigger activity on ControllerMate's internal mouse and keyboard. Building blocks that implement timers, apply simple or complex logic, or perform basic math can also be created. Each individual building block performs a basic task, combinations of blocks can perform complex and creative functions.\n\nA good thing about that app is you can choose to activate the remap for only the apps you want.\n\nA: Try Keyboard Maestro. It does a lot more than just remap keys, but it can be very useful for that purpose. You can set up all sorts of macros and actions on a global or per-app basis.\n", "Q: How can I batch rename files to copy them from OS X to Windows NTFS? I am trying to copy a large number of files to an NTFS formatted Windows 7 machine from a Mac OS formatted external hard drive.  I am mounting the drive by attaching it to my Airport Extreme Router.  This gives me access to copy files, however, it chokes on thousands of files that have names with various characters that are not supported in filenames on Windows.\nThere are too many files to fix it manually.  I am looking for an automated way to move the files to the NTFS drive.  I am okay with the files being renamed, but I would prefer to not have to play a guessing game of which characters to rename across a folder with thousands of files.  Any ideas?\n\nA: You might want to try the application A Better Finder Rename. It has a built-in function to convert Mac file & folder names to legal Windows file & folder names:\n\nNaturally, somebody will come along later and throw a smattering of regex in a bash script for you to puzzle out, but ABFR does this kind of thing so easily. It can even create a droplet app onto which you can 'drop' files & folders to be processed.

If someone can come up with a way to permanently disable display mirroring under all circumstances, I'll probably put together a bounty for you.\nI'm running OS X Lion on a sufficiently recent MacBook Pro.\n\n I'm not sure why they include mirrored mode in modern computers, anyway. It's never useful and it only confuses people. Don't tell me it's for presentations: any decent presentation software will have a presenter mode that everyone should learn to use and love.\n\n\nA: There doesn't seem to be an entry for the shortcut in com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist. The media keys cannot be configured in DefaultKeyBinding.dict or keylayout files. I didn't find any hidden preferences with strings either.\nI was able to disable it with KeyRemap4MacBook, but only on my laptop's keyboard; not on an Apple Wireless Keyboard.\n\n\n*\n\n*Save a file like this as ~/Library/Application Support/KeyRemap4MacBook/private.xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <item>\n    <name>Disable Command-F1</name>\n    <identifier>private.disable.command.f1</identifier>\n    <autogen>--ConsumerToConsumer-- ConsumerKeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_DOWN, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L, ConsumerKeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_DOWN</autogen>\n    <autogen>--ConsumerToConsumer-- ConsumerKeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_DOWN, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_R, ConsumerKeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_DOWN</autogen>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\n\n*Press the ReloadXML button and enable the new remapping in the first tab\n", "Q: Is there an equivalent in iChat to Adium's \"Force old-style SSL\"?

Guess it's got something to do with a self-signed SSL certificate or likewise.\nHow do I make the iChat client connect? Want to kick Adium to the curb for a few reasons.\n\nA: Go to iChat's Preferences > Accounts, choose the account in question, and go to the \"Server Settings\" tab. Make sure that \"Use SSL\" is checked, but change the port to 443. You should probably also turn off \"Automatically find server and port\" if it's on.\n", "Q: Why won't my Airport Extreme mount my USB 3.0 External Hard Drive? I just decided to upgrade to a USB 3.0 Hard Drive Enclosure. I regularly use my Airport Extreme to share the hard drive using an older enclosure. I know that the Airport Extreme won't have USB 3.0, but I expected it to be backwards compatible. Am I wrong, or is something else amiss?\nI'm using this Thermaltake Max 5G, and it mounts when I attach it to a MacBook Pro running Lion.\n\nA: Per Thermaltake support:\n\nThe Airport Extreme Base Station cannot provide the proper driver support for the docking unit. The docking station was designed to be directly connected to a computer's USB port. \n\nNot a very satisfactory answer, but I guess it is the answer.  I expected it to simply function as USB 2.0 speeds, rather than not working at all.\n\nA: Maybe the reason your MacBook can see it but not airport extreme may be because of the type of partition scheme - just read that you need to set it to GUID rather than DOS-style Master Boot Record - see here: http://lowendmac.com/2009/things-to-know-when-connecting-usb-hard-drive-to-airport-extreme/\n\nA: Try plugging an old externally powered USB 2.0 hub into the airport extreme and then plugging the external drive into the hub.  This is the only way I could get my new (Sept. 2014) USB 3.0 hard drive to work with my 5th generation airport extreme.  The drive came with its own externally powered USB connector but it would not work with the airport extreme for some reason.\n\nA: Oh oh oh!  I got it to work!  You can format it HFS+ (Mac OS Journaled), but when you connect it to the Airport Extreme, and want to see files on it, the AE creates a /Shared directory.  Throw all your stuff in there and you're done.\n\nA: I have an Airport extreme about 2 years old and have just bought a 4TB seagate USB 3.0 .. works perfectly.\nHave you tried formatting it by plugging it direct to the Mac first?\nJ.\n\nA: Any drives harddrives connected to the usb port on Airport Extreme must be in FAT32 or HFS+. If you plug it directly into the Mac USB port then an NTFS or DOS, fat 16 etc can be recognized also but to see an external on a network plugged directly into usb port of an airport extreme, it must be in HFS+ or FAT32 in order to see it over a network.\nThe reason the Mac sees it is because of the Mac OS file system. If you plug it into the Airport Extreme you won't see it unless it's formatted correctly. This is a \"limitation\" of the AE.\nFaslane\n", "Q: What exactly does \"erase and sync\" mean in iTunes? This is one of the scariest, vaguest warnings I've ever seen.\nIn my case I don't mind if it erases all of my songs and re-syncs with my new computer, but I sure as hell don't want it erasing everything on my iPhone. Why on earth would it need to do that? Why is this error so vague?\nI'm definitely not willing to just try it and see what happens.\n\nA: I finally found a tool that will let me transfer songs to my iPhone without iTunes, at least from my PC: CopyTrans.\n\nA: Extracted from Apple's Support Page:\n\nClicking Erase and Sync will delete any existing content currently on your device. The content will be replaced with whatever existing content is in the current iTunes library your device is connected to. If there is no content in the iTunes library, nothing will be synced to your device, and your device will be empty.\niTunes will begin copying any purchases made with any account for which the computer is authorized.\n\nWell, if you'd like to sync with a new computer or transfer your purchases to a computer, this is the way. And for the vague, it seems pretty clear:\n\nErasing and syncing replaces the contents of this iPhone with the contents of this iTunes library.\n\nIt keeps being sort of scary, though.\n\nA: As far as I know and from my experience it will all delete the third party apps and music, but as for the other contents and I am pretty sure that they have links on your itunes account in iCloud like photo and contacts plus messages will not be harmed. \nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/1967470?start=0&tstart=0\n\nA: Although it's not technically the answer to the question as I worded it, for the sake of others I finally managed to get my iTunes to sync with my iPhone by first:\n\n\n*\n\n*Finding my iTunes library persistent id from my iPhone using http://www.magicspace.eu/software/iphone-itunes-sync-recover-your-library-persistent-id/\n\n*Changing the library persistent id of my iTunes installation using http://www.andrewgrant.org/2008/03/30/how-to-sync-an-iphone-with-two-or-more-computers.html\n\nA: iTunes can only be synced with one Apple device at a time.  You can also try Library Tunes, which gets around this restriction and guides you step by step.  It uses the library persistent method mentioned above.\n", "Q: How can I remove my me.com address from Mail? I have a few email accounts set up in Mail. One of them is my xxxxx@mac.com email address. At some point (maybe after I switched to iCloud), Mail started including the xxxxx@me.com address in the list of potential from: addresses. Is there any way to convince it to not include the @me.com address? I don't ever want to use it.\nEdit\nSorry, I may have been unclear. I want to continue using the xxxxx@mac.com address. I just don't want the xxxxx@me.com address in the popup list or to have Mail automatically enter it in the From field when I create a new message.\n\nA: Go to Mail's Preferences / Accounts / Advanced and deselect the Activate this account checkbox. This should do the trick. \n\nA: If you want to completely remove the account and all associated data from your hard drive.\nGo to:\nMail > Preferences\n\nIn the tab choose Accounts:\n\nChose your .me account:\n\nHere you can remove it with the - button\nThen in the popup simply choose to remove:\n\n\nA: Actually, if you just want to remove the \"@me\" from the \"from\" drop down when creating an email (I found this excruciatingly annoying), go to Preferences, Account Information, and then in the Email Address field, delete the \"@me\" address, so that only your cool .Mac is in there. \n\nA: This is a long shot, but maybe try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*In your iCloud account preferences in Mail, click on the \"\"Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP)\" menu\n\n*Choose \"Edit SMTP Server List\"\n\n*Add a server for smtp.mac.com\n\n*Use default ports\n\n*Set Authentication to \"password\" and enter your @mac.com username and password\n\n*Choose the server you just set up as the server for your mac.com account\n\n\nThat setup works for me to send from mac.com instead of me.com, but I'm not sure if that's because it was somehow grandfathered in or not. Curious to know if it works for you. \n", "Q: Safari Extension to Manage Tabs? I'm looking for a more efficient way to manage my tabs in Safari. Specifically something that allows me to move multiple tabs at once to a new window.\nI often find myself following a link for a new subject/idea, then another, and so on and so on, until I find myself with a dozen tabs that should really be in their own window, but it's a pain to manually find and drag each one. I'd love to be able to do it in one fell swoop. Any suggestions?\n\nA: Poor mans answer - I use XMarks and do any management I need in their web interface. However Safari is close to getting the boot on my mac since I can only see 13 open tabs. \n\nA: I have develop this open source Tab Manager for Safari, I hope its useful to you. All the comments are welcome .\nhttps://github.com/morsamatias/UltraTabSaver\n\nA: I don't know any tool, which could do this.\nBut a somewhat less inconvenient way would be to safe all tabs as bookmarks. Move all bookmarks you like to have opened in another window to another bookmarks folder, right-click on the folders name and open all tabs simultaneously.\n\nA: Tabs Saver for Safari (https://apps.apple.com/in/app/tabs-saver-for-safari/id1440006971?mt=12) is a good one. This is not a free app (close to 3.5$).\nBut this works perfectly as a session saver.\n\nA: You can do it vey easily. Use top menu History -> Reopen Last Closed Tabs.\n", "Q: \"Partition failed with error: Couldn't unmount drive\" I am trying to create a new partition so I can install Windows through Boot Camp. I boot into recovery mode using my Recovery Assistant USB and no matter what I do, when I try to resize my drive and create a new partition, I get this error. What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Have you tried repartitioning with Boot Camp (just go through the Boot Camp process normally)? You shouldn't have to repartition manually in the first place.\n\nA: You should install OS X on an external hard drive and wipe your internal hard drive. Hopefully, if there's nothing on the internal drive, the OS won't bother mounting it.\n\nA: Use Boot commands for mac os x\n", "Q: Is there a way to show the release dates of System software updates? I was previously hit by the Thunderbolt Update that made the iMac not bootable, so as a precaution in the future, I may check and see the release dates of all the Software Updates, and if the update is more than 2 to 3 days old, then I will install it -- if less than 2 to 3 days old, then I will not install it.\nThis is because if a software update has any issue, by the 2nd or 3rd day, it will be known and any correction will be made, or the update may be pulled from the update list.\nBut is there a way to see the release dates on the list?  Right now only the version is displayed, such as 3.0.6, but the release date will be more useful.\nWe can click on the link to see the details on a webpage, but it is time consuming if there are many updates, and sometimes the webpage doesn't show a release date.\n\nA: If you are running a software update service on OS X Server, you can see when Apple released each update (and also when the server actually downloaded the file). This is also nice as then you can then only mark an update as viable to your machines once you have had a chance to review things.\nAlso, for a more lightweight solution, you can look at the downloads web site to determine when a particular package was released.\n", "Q: More than one iPad on one computer / temporary connection My wife uses her iPad (first generation) a lot, but never syncs with her laptop.\nSo she never updated to IOS 5, because she never got a message to do so. \nHer laptop is gone. I would like to update her iTunes and install IOS 5. But my computer has the existing partnership with my iPad.\nCan I plug her iPad into my computer, without synching, for only the purpose of downloading and installing updated iTunes and IOS 5 on her iPad?\n\nA: It is possible to sync several iOS devices to the same computer account. I do it all the time with an iPhone and an iPad, it will also work with two iPads.\n\nA: If you want to update your wife's ipad using your own computer which is not the one in sync.\nIf you update your wife's Ipad using your itunes it will delete all 3rd Party apps and Music on your wife's ipad. With this issue as your wife's computer is not with us anymore, but you said you have your wife library back up right? You might try this solution, thou I haven't really tried yet. link\n\nA: A better approach: Create a separate user account on the Mac and have that account login to the other Apple ID.  Only sync her iPad on that account.\nI took another approach: when we married, we downloaded everything stored on her iCloud, then switched her devices to my Apple ID.  The reason for that is so that we could share more things than \"family share\" supports.  Each iPad can still have a different set of Music and Apps on it.  I'm told that limits us to five devices, but as of today, all six seem to be working.\n", "Q: Change my shell to a different bash version at /usr/local/bin/bash? How can I set my /usr/local/bin/bash (which is the 4.2 version that allows auto-completion of 'cd to directory with directory name') to be my default bash for a new window instead of my regular (v3.2.48) version.\nI can type /usr/local/bin/bash and get into it but that's not the default for a new Terminal window which is what I want.\n\nA: I don't know if this will populate in the terminal / advanced user account locations, but \"The Way This Has Worked For Years\"™ in Linux-land is that you must update /etc/shells with the path to the shell location, and then use chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash username to use it.\nSimply running chsh without modification to /etc/shells should cause an error indicating you've chosen an invalid shell, in case you're curious.\n/etc/shells is a root-owned file, so you must use sudo in tandem with an editor in order to modify it.

I'm thinking about buying a macbook pro (latest 2012 version) and it seems sensible (from a financial point of view) to buy the standard built in hard disk and do the upgrade to SSD myself.\nIn order to get the most bang for my buck, I'd like to know what the maximum read/write speed of the SATA interface in a macbook pro supports? i.e. is it worth getting a 600Mbps or 300Mbps drive? Is it SATA 2 or 3?\n\nA: OWC has tested it and confirms that..\n\n...the MacBook Pro 15” (2012) has two drive bays, each capable of running an OWC 6G SSD at full 6Gb/s speeds.\n\nwhich is the SATA Revision 3.0 speed.\nThey've also setup a striped RAID which benchmarked at \"over 1000MB/s read speeds and write speeds that nearly hit 900MB/s\".\nRegarding the Macbook Pro 13\" (2012), OWC recommends using a 6Gb/s SSD only in the main bay, as the 6Gb/s performance of the optical bay is very poor. 3Gb/s models however work without problems in the optical bay.\n\nA: They've had SATA 3 (6Gb/s) since switching to Sandy Bridge early 2011. I'd say get the SATA 3 SSD if it doesn't cost much more.\nIf the combination of memory chips and controller inside the SSD itself can't supply data as fast as 3Gb/s, you won't ever max a SATA 2 connection. However, some current SSDs are starting to approach the real world limits of SATA 2, so they should all be on SATA 3 soon regardless.\nDepending on how disk I/O intensive your work is, you may not notice the difference between an SSD on SATA 2 vs. SATA 3, so I'd say if it's a huge price difference, it won't be worth it for most users.\nBut you'll definitely notice the difference between a spinning disk and an SSD on any version of SATA.\n", "Q: Can I force Mac OS X to select certain Wifi network? When I turn on Wifi on my MacBook, it always selects some open network.\nCan I somehow force the system to choose another network (it is password-protected but I have the password stored in the Keychain and it keeps choosing the open one)?\nI'm using Mac OS X 10.7.4.\n\nA: You could also uncheck the \"Remember networks this computer has joined\", in combination with \"Ask to join networks\", ensuring that the one you want is in your preferred list.\nThis will then mean the computer will only connect to the preferred list in order that they appear.  If they are not available for any reason it will simply ask you to join another (if it finds one), without then saving that network name in your list and joining it automatically subsequently, meaning you will be asked each time, even if you have used it before.\n\nA: Sure. Just go to System Preferences/Network, select Wifi and click Advanced. A list with all the Wifi networks you've been connected to will appear. Just rearrange the connection order (the ones you'd like to connect first on top) by drag-dropping. \nAlso, delete any unwanted network SSID (network names) if you no longer want to auto-join that.\n", "Q: Configure Router with Mac My router's IP address is 192.168.1.245.

The simplest way is like this:\nfind . -user 501 -exec chown Julian {} +\n\nThe \"find\" command is explained in the manpage, and in a number of tutorials and howtos like this one, nut the short idea is \"find everything that matches these criteria, and do this command with each one\".\n\n\n*\n\n*. means to look in (and beneath) the current working directory.\n\n*-user 501 means to only find files owned by user 501.\n\n*\n\n*Note that this is BSD-specific; in some other POSIX systems, user takes a username, and a separate uid flag takes numeric user IDs.\n\n\n*-exec … {} + means to run whatever's in the \"…\" (in this case, \"chown Julian\") repeatedly, passing it as many of the found files as possible.\n\n*\n\n*So, if there are 5000 files, it may end up calling chown 4 times (on the first 1203, then on the next 1888, and so on). \n\n*Note that this is a BSD extension (although GNU has a similar extension); there is a portable equivalent with ; instead of +, but this will call chown once for each file, which will generally take a lot longer. (The standard solution is to use -print0 and pipe the result to xargs -0. But, since you're doing this on a BSD system, you don't have to do that.) \n\n*Note that if you're typing this in the shell, some shells will require you to escape the braces, but bash (the default shell on modern Macs) does not.\n\n\n\nA: This will do what you want:\nfind . -type f -uid 501 -print0 | xargs -0 sudo chown Julian\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*The . starts the search from the current directory.\n\n*The -type f requires only files to match, not directories.  (Omit this if you want to change directories too.)\n\n*The -uid 501 requires all matches to be owned by this user.\n\n*The -print0 separates matches by nulls instead of spaces so that any path containing spaces is not misinterpreted.\n\n*The xargs -0 ensures that xargs input looks for null delimiters instead of spaces.  Since chown can accept multiple files, xargs is used to ensure that sudo chown is run only as often as needed to affect every listed file.  (In this respect it is much faster than an equivalent find ... -exec.)\n\n\nA: Not sure if this will break things in OS X if the files are system related. But to change the owner of the files do a\nsudo chown -R Julian <directory>\n-R means the owner is changed for all files recusivly in the current dir. So be careful.\nman chown should give you some additional details. \n", "Q: How to distinguish multiple OS X installations from each other in the bootloader?

It did not have an entry in the plist like all the others.\n\nA: The 'All HD' menu (along with many others) apparently is loaded dynamically over the internet (presumably via a connection to the itunes store). If your Apple Tv is not connected to the internet this menu (along with others) will not show up.\n", "Q: iPhone 3GS keeps vibrating at random times I've had this 3GS for nearly three years now, and just recently (last few months) it has started to vibrate briefly (under 1 second) with no alerts or other indication onscreen as to why it's vibrating.\nIt happens a few times a day now, even after a reboot of the phone.\nHas anyone else seen this behavior, or are there suggestions for things I can try to resolve it without repairing the hardware? In other words, yes, I realize it's probably a hardware issue, but is there a possibility it is software or can be resolved without repairing the hardware?\nI used to keep in on vibrate 100% of the time, and recently have switched to letting it ring as my belt case broke and I don't feel it vibrate in my pocket.\n\nA: When I worked at the Apple Store we had 3G and 3GS models come in every so often where their iPhone would vibrate without cause, sometimes the problem could be recreated by squeezing the top left hand corner (Pressing in on the front and back of the case) of the phone. As shown in this video:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zs17LV2SAM\nIt doesn't always show the vibrate on off icon when it happens. \nWe noticed it happened more with people who had 3G and 3GS phones that were older.  It is a common enough issue that if you google search iPhone 3g vibrating randomly, you'll get quite a few hits.\nWhen we had this issue, it was usually the vibrate motor going bad or having issues, a lot of time it was because people dropped their iPhones a lot and we could tell because the corners we scratched up, but it wasn't always the case. If you are under warranty, they will replace it.  If not, they can replace your iPhone for a price, usually 200 dollars. There was no software fix available from Apple.  We just had to simply repair the iPhone.  Restoring/Updating the iPhone didn't help either. It was purely a hardware issue.  There might be guides on replacing the motors in the device since it is easy to open up the devices but do that on your on discretion if its possible.\nPersonally, I would just hold off until a new iPhone comes out and just buy it if you want to.  Unless the issue gets to the point to where it is constantly vibrating for minutes at a time, which I have also seen happen during my time at Apple, then see if you can get them to replace it. It vibrating every once in a while won't cause issues but it vibrating constantly can deplete battery life quicker than normal.  \nNow, it could also be an app that is just updating its badge and your not realizing it. Every time I have seen it though it was because of the vibration motor.\nI hope that this information helps you out.\n\nA: I had the same problem for over 2 months. My Mobile Shoppee friend used a pin to clean both sides of the Ring/Silent switch. After removing a lot of dirt the random vibrations have stopped. The culprit may be dirt accumulated on both sides of Ring/Silent switch. Carefully clean the switch with a pin if it appears to be impeded.\n", "Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut for Don't Save? One thing I do a lot is Command ⌘-Tab over to TextEdit, jot down some notes, and then decide to throw them away.  I can close the window with ⌘-W, but is there a way to not-save it from just the keyboard?\nEscape simply cancels the close. ⌘-D takes the file-picker to the Desktop (and I thought this used to work, pre-Lion, but maybe I'm just imagining it).\nIs there a keyboard shortcut for Don't Save, short of turning on Full Keyboard Access?\n\nA: The default shortcut was changed to ⌘⌫ on Lion.\nYou can change it back to ⌘D with defaults write -g NSSavePanelStandardDesktopShortcutOnly -bool true. It won't affect some applications like TextEdit though.\n", "Q: Machine name set to new-host-X instead of the name set in Preferences My machine name is set shiny in System Preferences/Sharing/Computer Name.\nFrom another machine on the network, I can only use shiny.local to refer to this machine. In the past, I used only shiny.\nIn a terminal, I have new-host-7 instead of the machine name.\nI don't know if this is relevant, but the computers are connected to an internet box, on which a DHCP server is activated. I assigned a static IP address to the Mac. The internet box can see the name I gave to the Mac.\nIs there something I can do to refer to the Mac as shiny on the network ?\n\nA: Try using sudo scutil --set HostName shiny and sudo scutil --set LocalHostName shiny then close your shell (Terminal window) and open a new one.\n\nA: I figured it out here - (the scutil command is nice to know but didn't work)\nAccess your router (usually 192.168.1.1 or something) and look for the list of devices. On my Verizon Router this is under \"My Network.\" You should be able to rename them there.\nThe problem I found was that my computer had two different IP connections to the router: one was the ethernet, the other was the wireless connection. The wireless connection had the correct name, the other one had \"new-host-5\". You can't have the same name for both, so rename the wireless connection to whatever, and then change the name of the ethernet connection to what you want. (Also I just disabled the Wireless connection, because I don't need both... Don't know if that was necessary though)\nHope This helps!\n", "Q: How to create a playlist in Quicktime Player for many files in separate subfolders? I have a folder of .mov files that are all part of a video tutorial session. The directory looks like: \nTuts/\n  Tut1/\n    Chapter1/\n      1-1.mov\n      1-2.mov\n      1-3.mov\n    Chapter2/\n      2-1.mov\n      2-2.mov\n   Tut2/\n     ...\n\nWhile trying to watch this series I have to go back to Finder and open the next .mov file in order to get start the next video. I've been looking around Google and can't seem to find a way to make Quicktime Player just play the videos in order.\nIs there any way to import this folder into Quicktime Player and just play them all in order without having to close Quicktime Player, go back to Finder, find the next video, open that video with Quicktime Player?\n\nA: Quicktime Player (X or version 7) doesn't support playlists to my knowledge. You could add the files to a playlist in iTunes, or download VLC. I'd highly recommend VLC, it's free, it can tackle pretty much any format you can throw at it (including .mov), and you can just drag and drop files to a playlist to queue them up very simply.\n\nA: If you create your own movie player using the QuickTime Framework it's possible to add whatever functionality you want. QuickTime Player itself does not appear to offer playlist capability on Mac OS X. Here's a few screen captures of my movie player using a playlist:\n\n\n\nA: Try Graphic Converter. It's good for lots of other things but you can use its slideshow features to play, for example, all the movies in a particular folder. Other than making sure the movies you want are in the folder, you don't have to actually make any kind of playlist. If you have .jpgs in the same folder, it will include them too, as part of your slideshow.\nIt's shareware, and well worth the US$35 for all the other stuff it does too.\nBut you can use it for free for a month or so, uncrippled, to see everything it can do.\nI don't have the website handy but if you do a search, you'll find it easily enough. LemkeSoft, I believe, is the developer.\n\nA: It's not for quicktime specifically, but you should check out IINA, it's basically QuickTime ... but 100x better, with playlists and more ... and it's open source and free :)\nhttps://lhc70000.github.io/iina/\n", "Q: Purchasing rMBP now - will come loaded with Mountain Lion? I wanted to purchase the new rMBP, but I was waiting for Mountain Lion to be released so that Mountain Lion comes already loaded on my computer.\nNow, I am going away to college on August 16th, so really, I'd want to be able to have my computer by the time I head off to college and as of now, Apple Store's website says 3 - 4 weeks (I need to order it online because I want to upgrade my RAM from 8 GB to 16 GB).\nSo what do you guys think? If I order it now, by the time it comes in 3 - 4 weeks, it will be pre-loaded with Mountain Lion?  Or is that a risk depending on when Mountain Lion is released vs. my computer shipped?  Or is waiting for Mountain Lion a silly thing to do as the update will be seemless/not a big deal at all and if I don't order it within the next week, I am risking not getting my Computer in time?\n\nA: Order now. You'll get Mountain Lion free no matter what, and it's a pretty painless process to install, particularly on a clean computer.\nIt's probably a toss-up whether you'll get Moutain Lion or not. It seems likely that it will be released before the end of the month, but when that image gets pushed to machines is anyone's guess. And even if you do end up with Lion, that may be a blessing in that you can wait out any 1.0 bugs if they pop up.\nOrdering now gets you in the queue, and there's virtually no downside to not having a copy pre-installed.\n\nA: Buy now would be my advice. All macs sold after the announcement get a free upgrade to Mountain Lion. \nIf you get your Mac before the release date, just wait to set it up until the new OS is released of you worry about starting to download things that are not yet ready for the new OS. \nWith internet recovery and the forums here, you don't need to depend on physical media like in years past. In fact, reselling a Mac that can run the old OS is slightly more valuable since the buyer could use that legacy software if they want options to not be forced onto Mountain Lion. It's an odd edge case, but having options is of value. \n", "Q: How can I verify a Lion FileVault recovery key? I have a volume that is encrypted with OS X Lion's full-disk FileVault. When I enabled FileVault I was given a recovery key, which I wrote down. I'd like to verify that the recovery key that I wrote down is correct before I store it somewhere safe.\nHow can I verify that a FileVault recovery key is correct?\n\nA: You should boot on the Recovery HD and use Terminal there to unlock the drive using the recovery key (you can't check the recovery key if you are booted on the crypted disk, since the unlocking process will fail: already unlocked).\nTo start with, you will need to identify the Logical Volume UUID of the encrypted drive using the diskutil corestorage list command:\ndiskutil corestorage list\n\nRunning that command will give you a listing of all Core Storage volumes. \nOnce you have the UUID of the encrypted volume, you can then unlock the encrypted volume using the following commands:\ndiskutil corestorage unlockVolume UUID\n\nWhen prompted enter the passphrase you would like to test.\nThis article provides more information and screenshots, Unlock or decrypt your FileVault 2-encrypted boot drive from the command line.\n\nA: This is much easier to do beginning in Mavericks. The fdesetup command was expanded to support recovery key changes and verification.\n$ sudo fdesetup validaterecovery\nPassword:\nEnter the current recovery key:\ntrue\n\nThis will prompt you for the key, which should be entered in all caps with the hyphens.\ntrue means you entered a valid recovery key.\n\nA: After you enable FileVault2 you will be prompted to restart your Mac.\nUpon startup you will be presented with a dialog box asking for your password. Typing in the wrong login password three times will produce a note under the password field which states, \"If you forgot your password, you can… …reset it using your recovery key.\"\nClick the triangle-button next to that message to reveal the Recovery Key textfield (which replaces the password textfield)\nIf the recovery key allows you to login then you know it worked. You will be asked to change your admin password if use the recovery key.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4790\n", "Q: Will jailbreaking my iPhone 4s allow me to copy songs manually in iTunes (or other software)? I want to be able to manage my music manually on my iPhone, but it's currently synced with a no longer available computer and won't let me re-sync with another computer without completely erasing my iPhone, apparently.\nIs jailbreaking an option or will I still be limited by iTunes and this ridiculous restriction?\n\nA: I'm not an expert on jail breaking, but AFAIK, that limitation is baked into iTunes - it doesn't really care if your phone is jailbroken, at least for the purposes of your question - it just talks with the music app (or more specifically, the database behind it).\nThat said, there is software out there that can restore your iTunes library from an iPod or iPhone. iRip works on OS X, there's also DeTune. SharePod seems to be the goto option for Windows. You'll have to use one of those programs to get your library back on your new computer, then re-sync your iPhone from your new library.\n", "Q: Time Machine keeps asking to create new backup? Every time a backup completes I get this message -\n'Time Machine completed a verification of your backups. To improve reliability, Time Machine must create a new backup for you.'\nI am backing up to Lacie Network Space 2 drive via wifi. \nDoes anybody know how to correct this?\n\nA: There is a very good thread here\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3658856?start=45&tstart=0\nOn page 4, user Hoppah discovers that his Time Machine (TM) backups go corrupt if they occur simultaneously with \"RAID scrubbing.\"  The RAID scrubbing is a function of the network application server (NAS) run periodically to check consistency.\nHoopah used the TimeMachineEditor utility to ensure that TM backups did not occur at the same time as the RAID scrubbing.  That solved his problem.\nThere is a post from a user Christof Birkenmaier, also on page 4, about how to mount the disk image of the backup and delete the portion of the backup causing the problem.  It is a very ugly fix that requires editing the TM record of its state. Scary.\nA blog entry at\nhttp://blog.jthon.com/?p=31\nexplains loading the TM disk image with the Disk Utility to repair it.  If that fails, it explains a command line method to run a file system check on the attached, but not mounted TM disk image.\nElsewhere in the thread first referenced above, from discussions.apple.com, on page 3, there is information about how to look at log files to spot the errors.  \nIt appears TM backups may be corrupted if the network connection is interrupted during backup.  You pack up and leave your house while the backup is running.  That pulls the plug on your wireless connection to the backup device.  Nasty thing to do to TM.\nI have decided to run TM manually, when I know it won't get interrupted, and when I know the NAS is not doing RAID scrubbing.\n\nA: This will not get fixed until Time Machine re-engineer its approach and move away from using a remote-mounted disk image over the network.\nThe problem lies due to network connections inherently being unreliable (more so wireless networks). However the file system (HFS+) was built for locally-attached disk and assumes that the connection is mostly reliable. Using Time Machine over the network is like writing to a hard drive in which you often unplug the cable mid-transfer. Eventually corruptions occur.\nThe only way to correct this is to file a bug report to increase the priority of fixing this within Apple's engineering group.\nMore information here.\n\nA: I've been having this problem since upgrading to Lion. Perhaps interesting and related, my iMac using a wired network connection does not exhibit this problem while the two MacBook Pro's connected over wireless do have this problem.\nI've been able to successfully fix this following these instructions: Fix Time Machine Sparsebundle NAS Based Backup Errors. Unfortunately it'll fix it for a few backups then the problem pops up again and I need to run through the same fix again.\n\nA: Connect to your external hard drive via USB, Firewire, or Thunderbolt.  \nProblems can occur when backing up over a network connection that corrupt the time machine backup.\nThis apple support communities discussion ended menitoning the Airport Extreme Base Station as a possible cause of the problem.\nThis site goes into more detail about the error message.\n\nTime Machine locks the sparse bundle containing your network backups, and marks it as damaged.  You may be able to view and restore some things from these backups, but you will not be able to continue backing-up to them.  Disk Utility may appear to repair them, but they’re still damaged and if you try to back up to them again, you’ll just get the same message again.\n\n", "Q: What does this mean: \"mds: (Warning) FMW: event:1 had an arg mismatch. ac:2 am:51\" \nmds: (Warning) FMW: event:1 had an arg mismatch.  ac:2 am:51\n\nThis error shows up in my system.log file regularly.

In the US the legal precedent for this sort of activity would be \"The Betamax case\", which established that Americans have the right under Fair Use to \"time shift\" TV shows to tape.\nI've used Handbrake.  It makes a hugely complex process much more manageable, but it's not perfect.\n\nA: Handbrake is a great tool for ripping DVDs and otherwise converting video.  \nThe legal question is probably beyond the scope of this forum, but if you own the dvd and are only ripping it for your own personal viewing, I wouldn't worry about it.\n", "Q: Managing AVCHD videos with correct date I'm copying the .mts files directly from my Canon HD camcorder's SD cards.  It appears the camera only writes the date of video capture to the \"Modified\" portion of the file meta data, but doesn't update the creation date.\nWhen I copy it over, OS X puts today's date/time as the last modified, and so the date of the video capture is lost - at least in the file meta data.  I haven't checked to see if it's also encoded in the MTS file (perhaps someone here knows how to check this?)\nWhat are my options for preserving the file information when copying?  Using import with iMovie and others takes much, much longer than just copying them over, so I'd rather avoid using an import process, but at this rate it looks like that might be my best option.\nAny other ideas?\n\nA: It looks like the best way to copy the camera data without importing it is to use the disk utility to image the SD card.  Later on it can be mounted and normal camera import utilities will work and capture all the related metadata not stored in the MTS files.\n", "Q: Why does my Xserve simply eject Linux install CDs instead of reading / booting from them? I have an Xserve G4, dual 1.33 GHz processors, 2 GB of RAM, 1 CD-ROM drive, 2 internal Hard Drives (read: Nowhere really to back them up to). I also have 1 EXTERNAL Hard Drive, Firewire, but just like the internal drives, I can't reformat with any sort of ease, too much data.\nNow for the problem: I am trying to install Linux, specifically Gentoo or ArchLinux, for a multitude of reasons spanning from: wanting to get away from dependancy on Mac OS, to not liking the performance of old versions of Mac OS X in a modern (internet) age. I have Live CDs for Ubuntu 8, and the latest Gentoo Minimal Install PPC disk. I can not, however, get the computer to accept the CDs. About 20 seconds after inserting the CD to the body of the Xserve, it comes right back out. These are 700 MB CDs, with 680 MB and 140 MB of data on them, respectively. The burns had no errors, I have the console reports handy if they are requested.\nPossible solutions/diagnoses I have come up with, but can't act on without advice on how to:\n\n\n*\n\n*The CD drive is defective? (How do I test this?)\n\n*Boot to one of my 2 spare (10 GB each) hard drive partitions on my HFS drive, no success on that front so far.\n\n*Would using an external CD Drive work for boot-from-CD?

Would mac-fdisk actually be able to resize, or is that just parted?\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n\nA: Make sure the security lock on the front panel of the Xserve is not engaged. If the server is locked (using an allen key) it will simply refuse to accept any disk in the slot load and eject it, assuming you are trying to insert a 'malicious' disk when the sysadmin has protected it.\n", "Q: Which type of storage between HDD and SSD should I use in MacBook Pro for app development job? I'm deciding to buy my first MacBook Pro for developing iOS application. I never use any Apple desktop or laptop before, and also never develop any application. I think if I want faster result when I compile an application, higher CPU and RAM are better. But I'm not sure about storage type, does SSD significantly results faster compilation time than HDD?\nPros of SSD: faster read & write speed\nCons of SSD: expensive!\nIs it worth to use SSD instead of HDD?\nP.S. I choose MacBook Pro instead of iMac or Mac Pro because I have to bring it to training center to study iOS application development.\n\nA: It depends on your project size, but an SSD is unlikely to make a huge difference in compilation speeds - it's almost entirely a CPU-bound task. However an SSD can still make a big difference in your productivity with Xcode, and OS X in general. It particularly helps when you're indexing files in a project, or searching the documentation.\nYou'll also notice a big improvement whenever you're swapping to disk (e.g. if you're doing another task while a big compile is happening).\nUnless money is very tight, I strongly recommend getting an SSD. You can save a lot of money buying a 3rd party SSD and installing it yourself (which is pretty easy in a MacBook Pro) - prices have been dropping sharply lately, I'd estimate about 50% from where they were at the start of the year.\n\nA: If you can afford it SSD is the way to go. If storage space is also an issue, and you can sacrifice the optical drive, you could install an OWC Data Doubler which enables you install a second 2.5\" drive. It's not the most straightforward of installations but isn't that hard. This is what I've done in my 13\" MBP. 120Gb SSD for OS and Apps. 500Gb HD in the Data Doubler for storage.\n\nA: There is storage solution in between of HDD and SDD, namely hybrid drives.\nA hybrid drive is a hard disk drive with a smaller solid state drive built in. Seagate offers these drives under their \"Momentus XT\" range up to 750GB (ST750LX003) at a price of approximately 70% above regular HDD prices.\nAn additional tip: verify that your backup procedure is good. SSD's in our experience fail more often then HDD's. And when they SSD's fail, there is no data to recover.\n", "Q: iTunes track notifications for Mountain Lion In OS X Lion there was the preference (via a Terminal command) to enable iTunes track notifications that were displayed as a popup in the dock.\nSo far it seems as though Mountain Lion does not allow this, I was wondering if anyone knew whether the command had changed or if this is just not possible in OS X 10.8.\nThe Terminal command I had been using in Lion was:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock itunes-notifications -bool TRUE; killall Dock\n\nA: As best as I've been able to tell, this feature has been removed.\nThere are two alternatives to the Lion-provided notification mechanism that provide a few more features and customizability.\nIf you have Growl installed, you can use GrowlTunes to provide Growl notifications on track and playback changes.\nThe official Last.fm Scrobbler app provides notifications via Growl as well, the bonus being that it's worth using if you also scrobble your playback history to Last.fm.

Simply said, What options exist for heavy duty (12 GB photo library to start with room to grow) and more efficient way to manage photos and videos between my computer and an iPhone.\nI am asking this because recently, my iPhone is complaining to me that I have no more storage space. I have a lot of photos and videos shot on my iPhone and I usually leave them on my iPhone. I back up my precious photos and videos via the back-up feature in iTunes and that's all. But iTunes doesn't allow me to view the photos that it has backed up and removing any image from my iPhone is going to do the same to the back-up copy. I have depleted the storage space, I need to clear some of the photos from my iPhone. \nI could back up the photos by copying them from the iPhone icon under My Computer. However, this method gets confusing in the long run, especially when I am selectively removing photos over time and putting them back. \nSo I'm starting to ask myself if everyone else does it this way (the confusing method). What is a way to manage photos and videos more efficiently between my computer and iPhone, such that my computer is the main library of all the photos and videos -- that's deleting items from iPhone when sync'ed with computer does not remove the copy on my computer and new items on my iPhone gets transferred to the computer? \nThe leading solution of using a Cloud service may be too expensive. It would be great if I could transfer between just an external hard drive and my iPhone.\n\nA: *\n\n*When importing new photos and videos from my iPhone, I always click to delete them on my iPhone, so the master copy moves to the iPhoto library.\n\n*The only photos & vides I keep on my iPhone are those I explicitely synch to it: I use a smart album of last 12 (or whatever) months plus whatever hand picked photos and albums I want.\n\n\nThis works of course because I use a Mac. Since you tagged your question \"Windows\" and you speak of \"My Computer\" icons, I suppose you're on a PC and this answer will not be very useful to you. But I am still posting it in hope that it maybe inspires you to find a solution that works for you.\n\nA: For windows PC's Photo albums: \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a master sync folder on your pc with no photo files at the root level of the folder. (e.g. C:\\Pix\\iPhone)\n\n*Create sub-folders within the master sync folder with the subfolders named what you want the ipad's photo albums to be named. (e.g. C:\\Pix\\iPhone\\2013-01-01 New Years Party!)\n\n*Place the photo files you want to sync in the appropriate subfolder within the master sync folder. (e.g. C:\\Pix\\iPhone\\2013-01-01 New Years Party!\\IMG001.jpg)\n\n*In itunes on the photos tab, select the master folder as the sync folder. (e.g. C:\\Pix\\iPhone)\n\n*After syncing, each subfolder will be an album on the device with the proper photos contained there-in. (e.g. Albums\\2013-01-01 New Years Party!)\n\n*Delete photos from the iPhone\\DCIM folder that you've copied.\n\n\nThe trick here is to copy content from iPhone\\DCIM to your local Pix\\iPhone and sync back via iTunes. Delete the originals from the iPhone\\DCIM after copying each time. You can create an Pix\\Inbox folder where you copy all the pictures, and only move the ones you want on the iPhone to the Pix\\iPhone\\[ablum name]\nsee Apple Forum\n\nA: My solution is to use Apple Photostream with iCIoud in conjunction with the two Photosync tools (an iPhone app and a PC program). Photostream automatically sends pics I take on my phone to the photostream folder on my phone and then to the cloud. The cloud only holds 1000 pics, but that's ok because it functions just as a temporary holding space for pictures. I have Photosync running on my PC. it monitors the cloud and automatically downloads new pics to  a PC folder. I occasionally take the pics from that folder and organize them into my picture library on my PC. Deleting old pics from my phone (camera roll and photostream folders) never deletes them from the PC, so I delete several hundred pics whenever the phone is getting close to full. I also have it set up so my wife's iphone shares the same photostream, so her pictures appear in my iphone photostream folder and vice versa. That detail won't be to everyone's liking for privacy reasons, but for us it's great because we take mostly baby pics and like to see the others' shots.  Thats all free.\nI also want to be able to see my pictures from years ago on the phone. To do this, I use a paid syncing service with my PC called sugarsync. It copies my entire library to the cloud so I can always find old pictures in the cloud using the sugarsync app on my iphone. \nVideos I take with my iphone have to be handled separately since Apple's photostream only does photos. Occasionally, every month or two, I use the Photosync iphone app to push all my videos to my PC wirelessly. Then I can delete them at will from the phone to gain space. You could also use this method for photos, but I like the speed, instantenaity, and sharability (I made up those two words) of our photostream method. I can also access old videos through sugarsync as desired as well.  \nIt can all get a bit confusing but it really works well for me. Frankly the biggest challenge is deleting hundreds of pics from my phone at once. The fastest way is to connect the phone to the PC, but I resent ever having to wire up my phone, or heaven forbid, connect to iTunes. So I just delete them by hand on the phone. \n\nA: You could try Together\nAll videos will be linked to your account, synch is done over the air (no need to plug in), web management interface is available. Also there are some cool features for working with videos.\nThe basic idea behind the service is that people usually need to delivery stories and not the chunks of their experience (separate photos, funny video clips). That's why the service aggregate individual media pieces (photo and videos) into groups (by date, by tag, by album, by location). All that videos could be easily downloaded to any PC through the web interface. Also you could work not only with individual content units but albums as a video clip consisting of numerous video scenes and photos.\n", "Q: Can I disable video iCloud backups in Camera Roll? My default iCloud backup is almost full at 4 out of 5 GB, and I strongly suspect it's not the photos (I don't take that many) but a few giant videos in the Camera Roll:\n\nIs there any way to disable backing up videos only to iCloud? I can only find a way to turn the entire camera roll backup on or off, which I don't want. I definitely want the photos to be backed up to iCloud, just not giant oversize videos.\nYes, I can copy the videos off and delete them from my phone, but I still want the videos on the phone, I just don't want them backed up to iCloud at all.\n\nA: No - there is no easy way to just tell iCloud to omit part of the camera roll. I suppose a jailbreak could theoretically work in this functionality but I'm not up on what is possible in that realm.\nTwo workarounds seem practical today:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manage those videos in another app (Vimeo/iMovie seem clunky and undesirable for this but perhaps something like DropBox would work if you didn't mind the extra steps of migrating and then deleting video assets from the roll).\n\n*Give up iCloud backup of the camera roll contents and depend on iCloud Photo Stream for eventual backup to a computer.\n\n\nI've seen the second option work for people once they were acquainted with how the archival process works on a computer pulling from Photo Stream. Since iCloud backup is usually a half day behind in backing up, the stream is generally faster at getting a still photo off your device than the backup mechanism.\nIf you are OK with a computer regularly importing the photos from the stream before the 1000 image / 30 day limit starts deleting them from the stream, you could turn off the Camera Roll from your iPhone's backup options:\n\nSelecting Turn Off & Delete will reclaim your space in a minute or so. Just be sure your current camera roll has been totally imported before selecting the red delete option.\nSince videos do not go to the photo stream, you will need to transfer them off your device to make a backup copy of them going forward when needed.\n\nA: Now you can use Microsoft's OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) and Google Photos for media backup instead. Both offer 15 GB of free storage each.\n", "Q: Camera Roll Duplicates Why do I have 2 of every picture side-by-side in my Photo Library? I don't edit or rename pictures at all. All I do is take pictures.  Then sync phone to my Mac with iTunes. But Photo Library on iPhone shows 2 of everything without a trash can to remove them. What is going on?\n\nA: Chances are, you are importing these pictures into iPhoto. After that, under the photos tab, when you have your iPhone plugged in, is a checkbox to sync photos from iPhoto. This likely is checked. If these two things are correct, it will then transfer back onto your device, all the pictures that were/are on your phone. This is the only time I have seen pictures that I can't delete (that don't have the \"trash can\").\nIf this is the problem, it could be easily remedied by simply disabling the sync checkbox under the Photos tab for your device.\n\nA: @bassplayer7 is correct, and here's the breakdown. \nSteps to recreate the issue: \n\n\n*\n\n*On iPhone: HDR setting off. \n\n*On iPhone: take a picture\n\n*On iPHOTO: Select (or automatically) Import photos\n\n*On iTunes: on your iPhone settings, in the photo tab, select 'sync Photos from iphoto'\n\n*On iTunes: Sync. \n\n\nPresto! Two sets of the same photo(s). \nWhy: \n\n\n*\n\n*In step 3, you didn't tell iPhoto to delete the photos off your phone\nafter import \n\n*In step 4-5, iTunes was told to copy photos that were\nrecently added to iPhoto.\n\n\nReason there is no trash can: \n\n\n*\n\n*The iPhone has TWO photo directories. \n\n*\n\n*The first one is the photo ROLL. This is created by the iPhone, and this is where pictures you have taken or saved from applications on the phone are stored. They can be manipulated and deleted.  \n\n*The Second directory is the 'imported from PC' directory, and this is read only. You cannot modify these directly from the iPhone. This is intentional, so that iPhoto can maintain them. \n\n\n\nThe confusing part about it, is that when you look at the iPhone 'Photo Library', they all appear combined. \nThe distiction you can see is that the 'Camera Roll' should only have the copy you took on the device, and there should be a folder in the Albums list that shows the items imported back from iPhoto. \nThe solution: \nCheck your settings on iTunes and iPhoto. Decide if you want iTunes to copy the last import back to the phone, and on iPhoto, check if you want to import and delete.\nHope that helps! \n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean about the \"trash can\" (could you post a screenshot?) but if you have the HDR option turned on in the Camera app, it will create two copies of every photo - the standard camera capture, and a copy processed with HDR.\nYou can toggle HDR on or off before you take a photo by tapping the Options button that appears over top of the screen when running the Camera app. There is also an option under Settings -> Photos (Keep Normal Photo under the HDR section) that, if turned off, will only keep the HDR version of a photo.\n", "Q: Why does Apple not support Power Nap on some of the Macs that have Power Nap capability? Apple has already released the OS X Mountain Lion Technical Specifications which lists some Macs as excluded from certain features of Mountain Lion including:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power Nap\nWhen is a Mac excluded from a this feature? Is it a hardware limitation?\nI ask because I learned that AirDrop for example is excluded from some Macs as they don't support the ad-hoc Wi-Fi networking which is required to use AirDrop over Wi-Fi.\nI heard that Power Nap might require Intel‘s Smart Connect Technology and is therefore excluded from most Macs. However, this is unlikely to be true as the MacBook Air (Late 2010 Mid 2011 or newer) is already listed as supported - but Intel's Smart Connect was just about to be announced around 2011.\nSome 2010 hardware, for which firmware was apparently seeded by Apple (example: MBA13SMCSeed_2010.smc within publicly available 2010MBA13.pkg), is currently unlisted under Power Nap in the specifications. \n\nA: The why did Apple engineers X question is always a hard one to peg, but the simple answer is that a very small subset of Mac hardware is targeted for the initial Power Nap implementation.\nSpecifically, the Sandy Bridge and newer Air and the retina MacBook Pro all have non-user replaceable RAM and SSD so Apple has great certainty that there will be no oddball ram timing issues or storage related timeouts. Furthermore, these models all have intel integrated graphics and intel chipsets that were designed for this sort of \"operation while sleeping\" to perform network operations in a low power state.\nMacs have long had the ability to wake up using their internal clocks from the Energy Saver preference. Next, they were programmed to wake periodically to maintain DHCP leases and talk with Airport hardware so that the routers could proxy bonjour sharing requests while the Mac slept. Power Nap takes this ability of the network interfaces to remain alert while in a very low power state one step further. Now the CPU, storage and network stack (but not the fans or display and keyboard lights) power up on an hourly basis to see what tasks can be accomplished before returning to sleep.\nIf you look at what Power Nap does - it is clear that the functions are designed to use as little power as possible:\n\n\n*\n\n*App Store updates are only triggered weekly\n\n*Only one time machine backup is completed while sleeping. After that, it stops trying to back up while that sleep lasts\n\n*Software Updates (security) trigger once daily\n\n*The rest of the items like Photo Stream, Mail, iCloud documents and synced data are an hourly refresh while sleep + nap continues\n\n*Napping activity stops once the battery level has 30% full charge capacity remaining\n\n\nEven the name Power lets you know that the primary focus is preserving power but still do the things that you will have to do at some point. Others have speculated that heat is a design issue, and in so far as heat comes from using battery power I would agree that heat is a byproduct of the primary design limitation of Power Nap.\nAnyone that has used a MacBook Pro in clamshell mode or had one wake up while shut in a bag is aware that these machines run just fine at temperatures that most people are alarmed and worry about light burns / pain while holding.\nOnly time (or some public statement, lawsuit deposition or leak) will show us which other models gain Power Nap functionality going forward and whether my reasoning is on the mark about why three models only support Power Nap at launch. \n\nA: Only the MacBook Air (Mid 2011 or newer), MacBook Pro with Retina display were originally supported supported for Power Nap. The reason for this is An SMC update is required to gain all the functionality of Power Nap, and these are the only models Apple has chosen to actively write the firmware updates to support the feature. In other words, it's not that Apple runs some exclusion script to keep other models out; it takes an active update to the firmware to make a model run Power Nap, and they've chosen to do that for two particular lines of computers.\nIn a subsequent firmware update, Apple included Mid 2010 MacBook Air models in Power Nap.\nAs far as why they've made that decision, we enter the realm of speculation, but fortunately, we have some good information here.\nThe idea behind Power Nap is that when the computer appears to be asleep, from time to time, it actually wakes up and performs various tasks. This waking, however, is not noticeable to the user because the computer remains dark and silent. This means no audio or video is activated. It also means, of particular relevance to this question, the fan is also kept off.\nThis requires a storage device that can run without a fan and a processor that can run without a fan (sorry notoriously hot G5 — I doubt there would ever be a way to support you for this).\nAccording to John Siracusa's epic Mountain Lion review, the Dark Wake mode that Power Nap invokes does not turn on the fans. Thus, only devices Apple knows are designed to be able to access their storage without risk of overheating (as a spinning hard drive might) will take advantage of Power Nap. Siracusa suggests that third party SSDs might have a different heat profile.\nWhile SSDs could be installed in any computer, and Apple could perhaps write firmware updates for all their Macs so that Power Nap checks to see if the computer has a SSD drive and if so, runs Power Nap, they haven't chosen to do so. Instead, they've made Power Nap work only on those models of computer that they know will have a SSD drive.\nThe limitation might not be drive-based; it could be the processor that can't run silently. This seems slightly less likely to me, given the supported models, but it could explain why the 2010 MacBook Air is excluded. Power Nap monitors temperature, and if the system gets too hot to run without cooling, Power Nap disengages, but if the processor in earlier MBAs was triggering such an alert too often, that may be why Apple removed them from the list of models that support Power Nap.\ntl;dr: likely it's hardware; specifically, heat.\n\nA: Power Nap requires an SSD model (just don't ask me for a reference, but I remember some extended discussions about this after the WWDC keynote).\n\nA: Only Mid-2011 or newer MacBook Air models and Retina-display MacBook Pro models with factory SSDs support the feature; even then, they may need a firmware upgrade. See Mountain Lion's PowerNap feature requires firmware update.\n", "Q: Can I configure the relative brightness level that auto-adjust will set? I enjoy the Mac OS X brightness auto-adjustment on my MacBook Air, but I would usually prefer the screen dimmer than the level it decides on. This would also conserve some charge.\nI don’t suppose there is a way to bump it down a few notches? (I have searched for this and found nothing, so I assume the answer is no. But it is difficult to pick keywords that will produce relevant rather than almost-relevant results so there is a slim chance that I am overlooking it, and I shall remain hopeful yet.)\nThis would be in 10.7.4, in case that is relevant.\n\nA: You can use Shady.\nThe way it works is that it...\n\n...pull(s) a virtual shade over your screen ... dimming the display to a more comfortable level.\nShady will save your shade level and restore it next time you launch the app.\n\nAs it's just a virtual (but effective) dimming method, I doubt that this saves much energy, but I cannot confirm this as LED displays should consume less power if displaying darker colors.\n\n", "Q: MBP 15\" Late 2011 Lion audio noise Today I noticed something unusual on my MBP's audio.\nWhen I played some music on youtube today, I noticed that something was different.

I'm just asking because I don't want to damage the computer. I've read that this will happen, but I just want to ask around before hand :).\n\nA: The frequency rating on RAM is analogous to the top speed of a car, if it's max speed is (for example) 250 km/h, it can drive up to 250 km/h, but it won't break if u drive at 25 km/h.\nSame for RAM.

Here is the hardware report for the card reader:\n\nBuilt in SD Card Reader:\nVendor ID:  0x05ac\n  Product ID:    0x8403\n  Revision:  1.00   Serial\n  Number:   9833\nSDHC Card:\nCapacity:   7.97 GB (7,969,177,600 bytes)\n  Removable Media:  Yes   BSD\n  Name: disk1\n  Partition Map Type:   MBR (Master Boot Record)\n  S.M.A.R.T. status:    Not Supported\n  Volumes: \nPI:\n  Capacity: 7.96 GB (7,964,983,296 bytes)\n  File System:  MS-DOS\n  BSD Name: disk1s1\n  Content:  DOS_FAT_32\n\nAny ideas why the transfer to /dev/disk1 is so slow and how I could speed it up?\n\nA: Just ran into the same problem and it seems to be that /dev/disk* is slow because it is buffered. If you use the corresponding rdisk device (ex: /dev/rdisk1s1) you should get the speed you expect. This is apparently a BSD thing.\nExample:\n% sudo dd if=pi.bin of=/dev/disk1 bs=1m count=4095\n^C408+0 records in\n407+0 records out\n426770432 bytes transferred in 1393.452305 secs (306268 bytes/sec)\n\n% sudo dd if=pi.bin of=/dev/rdisk1 bs=1m count=4095\n4095+0 records in\n4095+0 records out\n4293918720 bytes transferred in 378.669512 secs (11339489 bytes/sec)\n\nRef:\n\n\n*\n\n*Note on Dev Entry Access\n\n*Post on Apple mailing list\n\nA: It could well be that the SD-card is that slow. \nTake a look at this benchmark (Random Write, 4 KB (QD=1) [MB/s]) and you will see that most SD-cards have a lousy write performance (below 100 kB/s) for small files - and a typical linux installation consists of a lot of small files been written to disk. \nThe internal card-reader should be capable of reading/writing at least 20 MB/s - it's very unlikely that another card-reader will improve your experience with this very SD-card.\nOnce all the files are written, i.e. the system is installed, you may actually be able to run Linux from the SD-card in an acceptable speed - as it's mostly read access.\n\nA: If the card is mounted with the sync option, this means every file close causes the write to be flushed to disk and thus your performance on small files will be terrible when compared with large files.  If you remove the sync from the mount options, then there is no guarantee that writing a file causes it to go out to disk -- you have to manually call sync from the command line, or unmount the device before removing it or powering down.  However, without sync you should see small files write performance improve drastically.\n\nA: No, this is clearly some issue with the Mac OS.   I get significantly faster performance when I do this same operation using Linux on a virtual machine running on the same Macintosh.   I.e., the VM is about 5x faster than the native OS.\n", "Q: Create a new iTunes column for \"Play count/skip count ratio\"? Is it possible to somehow create a new column in iTunes for \"Play count/skip count\" ratio? I usually use Play Count as a way to determine what songs I like the most, but this typically excludes newer songs (unless I limit the playlist by date).\nHowever, if I had a new column that took a song's play count and compared it to the song's skip count (such as 50 plays to 2 skips, 25:1; versus 20 plays and 5 skips, 4:1), then it'd be easier to see what songs I truly like, regardless of its age.\nSo, can this be done in iTunes at all, or is it absolutely not feasible?\n\nA: The columns and metadata that iTunes supports is hard coded unfortunately. There's no way to add a custom field or column to the browser.\nYou might be able to get a similar effect with some combination of smart playlists and/or some external scripting, but there's nothing built in that will do what you need.\n", "Q: Can you prevent the iPhone browser from reloading pages? I commute using the subway so this means 20 minute stretches of no internet.\nTo give me something to do, I often open a bunch of web pages, say 3 or 4 before I'm offline so I can read them while I'm without a signal.\nIf I check my pages just before losing a signal, they show up perfectly and the internet icon doesn't show, hence my thinking that it's not reloading when I check.\nAfter loosing internet, sometimes my web pages will display fine, other times they try to reload.\nIs there a way to have them not reload so I can read them?\nAny other alternatives?\n\nA: I will give you a real fix of how to stop iPhone from reloading web pages. I have tried everything but there is no real fix in Safari. However, you can install browsers like Mercury etc. \nThe Problem with such browsers is that they are not as good as Safari or Opera Mini. But I have lately come to know one feature in Opera Mini where one can stop web pages from reloading and it saves you huge data. I would strongly recommend you to give it a try. \nStep 1. Install Opera Mini browser from the App Store (It works just like the Safari browser works)\nStep 2. Open the browser and you will find 'O' sign in the middle - click 'O' sign.\nStep 3. At top you will find 'Savings Enabled' click it. You will find three modes of Opera Mini there:\n\n\n*\n\n*Opera mini\n\n*Opera turbo\n\n*Off\n\n\nStep 4. Switch to Opera mini.\nI would also recommend to keep text wrap mode on in 'advanced settings,' 'layout' tab. \nTo improve speed, switch off your phone for 2-5 minutes.  \n\nA: The behavior that you've described appears to be a limitation of the Safari mobile browser. Other users have complained about the Safari Mobile auto refresh behavior on several Apple community forum posts. \nThis iFans post offers some explanations and potential solutions:\n\nThis is not a feature... It's a limitation.\nMobileSafari keeps website cache only in RAM, and therefore, once it\n  runs out of RAM, it'll automatically destroy an entire page, forcing\n  the refresh, disguising itself as an auto-refresh feature. You can\n  only keep at most 3 pages open at any time... Even the iPhone 4 with\n  double the amount of RAM can only keep 5 pages.\nYou can try a third-party browser that has offline caching, and it'll\n  remedy the situation. Or alternatively, use the swap file mod I posted\n  in the jailbreak forums and it should work, too.\nThese third-party browsers have offline page caching as far as I know:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*iCab Mobile (also supports concurrent tab, which means you can browse\n  websites while listening to music on youtube, this is my personal\n  favourite) \n  \n*Atomic Web Browser (many useful features, but the interface\n  is a bit strange) \n  \n*Mercury (cool browser that looks like a shrunk\n  version of desktop Safari)\n  \n\nYour choices appear to be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a jailbreak mod to increase the swap file size (hopefully will increase number of pages that can be stored)\n\n*Use a third party browser that supports offline caching\n\n\nA: Mobile Safari clears tabs from memory when it receives a low memory warning from the OS. For performance reasons, iOS doesn't do any paging to disk, so when something is moved out of memory, it's gone unless it's been saved. So the reason you have to reload pages is that other tasks on your iPhone (other apps or new browser tabs) are using memory, so Safari kicks the older tabs out of memory, and when you flip back to them, they need to be re-dowloaded.\nThis is system behaviour, and it can't be changed. However there are several apps that are designed to save pages for offline reading. I personally recommend Instapaper - very well designed, actively maintained by a great independent developer, and the service integrates with a lot of other apps, so you can save links from most RSS and Twitter clients, amongst other things.\nThe basic premise is that when you open a page you want to read later, you use a bookmarklet to save the page to Instapaper. Then open the app and it downloads a nicely formatted, text- and pictures-only version of your saved pages for reading at your convenience. It has lots of other features, including saving your position in an article and syncing it to any other Instapaper clients you use. Highly recommended.\n\nA: Safari reading list saves everything for offline reading, so you could use that feature for any page you download and don't read immediately. \n\nA: Take screen shots of what you want to read. You will then not have any reloading issues. \nOf course, you'll have to fit all of the content of what you want to read on the screen.\n\nA: I prefer ReadItLater (now called Pocket) to Instapaper, but both are good. I wish someone would write a jailbreak patch to mobile safari to enable page caching to disk, but until then, I guess I'll try mercury and icab. Thx all.\n\nA: By member request, following is the answer found on the page my original answer links to:\nIn Safari or another browser app, touch and hold on a piece of text (a single word or letter is fine), then lift your finger off the screen.  The word or letter will be selected and the familiar little pop-up that says \"Copy | Define\" appears.  Touch \"Define\" and the screen that shows the word's definition or says it couldn't find a definition pops up.  Now, do not touch anything else; not \"Done\", \"Search the Web\", or anything else. Now press the Home button (i.e., the one on the bottom portion of the front face panel of the iPhone with the square in it).  You will be switched back to the springboard with all your app icons and from there can do anything else you want.  Then, touch the browser icon for the browser you were in and you'll switch back into it.  The definition screen covering the browser window will still be there.  Touch \"Done\", and the screen drops away.  Blessedly, the open browser window(s) will not reload.\n\nA: If you don't want to download a third party browser or an app, and keep browsing in Safari. \nYou can actually use Noosfeer for this. It is intended to be used in any browser and work offline. The plus, the UI/UX is optimized for reading in any screen.\n\nA: Turn off 'open new tabs in background' in settings / safari. That sorts the problem\n\nA: Today I inadvertently discovered a way to stop this annoying behavior, even though it does not qualify as a real fix, it is a method of suppressing the behavior by taking a simple action every time prior to switching out from Safari or another browser.  Not ideal, but it does give you control (finally) of the browser such that the behavior is suppressed.

I am trying to free up space on my PC's internal space.  And if so, how do I go about doing so?\n\nA: Backing up your purchases is one approach. Since iTunes provides access to your prior purchases (as long as they have not been removed by Apple or the Developer), you can safely delete them from your computer. That won't be enough though.  You'll need to tell iTunes not to automatically download them.  Here are the steps you could take:\n\n\n*\n\n*In iTunes, go the iTunes Preferences ( or ⌘, ) and select the Store tab.\n\n*Under Automatic Downloads, assert that the Apps checkbox is unchecked. (see image below)\n\n*Delete the mobile Apps\n\n\n\n\nA: The best way would be to set your whole iTunes library to your external hard drive.\nTo do this, go to:\nedit > preferences > advanced\nThere chance the \"iTunes Media Folder Location\" to your external hard drive.\nNote that this will copy all your iTunes Media (Apps, musics, series, movies, and so on) to the external disc. I don't think there's a way to set just the apps to the new iTunes Media folder (but someone correct me if I'm wrong).\nAnother way you could go around this is to simply cut and paste all the apps from your Applications folder in your current iTunes Media folder to your external hard drive, but this has some implications: Go to the Advanced preferences pane section again (instructions above) and untick the checkbox that says \"copy files to iTunes to iTunes Media folder when adding to library\". In this way you can keep everything anywhere, so you can keeps your apps in the external hard drive. But this imply that nothing you add to iTunes will be copied to the iTunes Media folder, so if you are a freak for having the iTunes Media folder organized (I am), then this is not the option for you. But if you don't mind, you could even have your songs in one hard drive, your apps in another, and link them to iTunes by unticking that checkbox.\n\nA: Go to your Music folder (\"My Music\" on windows and \"Music\" on Mac) (or whether you store your iTunes folder.

Is there a way to show the desktop from full screen apps? I'm used to do it with F11 but it doesn't work if you are running full screen apps. The same is true for hot corners.\nI need this functionality for example when I'm writing a mail and I need to drag and drop an attachment from my desktop.\n\nA: There doesn't seem to be a way to show the desktop straight from within the full screen app, but (depending on what methods you use for various kb/mouse shortcuts etc) it can still be done without exiting full screen (although someone may show that doing so would actually be quicker, perhaps, than my method below).\nLet's say I have Safari full screen, and I want to view a screenshot by opening it in a new tab (not a particularly useful scenario, but involves dragging a Desktop icon into a full screen app as per your question).  Here how I would do it, noting that there are probably loads of other methods depending on your preferred input methods.  The bold bits are the actual actions I choose, the rest is commentary on why:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I switch Safari full screen, it creates a new space to the right of the one I am in.\n\n*From within the full screen app, my desktop gesture of choice (5 finger trackpad spread) doesn't work (neither does F11, but then on my keyboard it's the volume down key, and I don't have \"use all F1, F2, etc keys as standard function keys\" preference option set, and the FN key is not located particularly well on a full size desktop keyboard, unlike the laptop ones)\n\n*So I 4 finger swipe to the right to show the previous screen before I went full screen (you may do ⌃Left Arrow)\n\n*Then I 5 finger spread on my trackpad to show the desktop (You may use F11 if it's not been commandeered by the volume down key or FNF11 or whatever the key happens to be depending on the age of your keyboard)\n\n*Then I hardware click with my thumb and hold the icon I wish to drag with my trackpad\n\n*Then I 3 finger swipe left (which exists the Desktop view and then swiped across a desktop in one movement)\n\n*\n\n*If you are not using a trackpad you can hit F3 once to exit desktop mode, and F3 again to show Mission Control (your mapping and or keyboard layout may differ), then just hover over the required full screen desktop at the top until it flashes and switches you to it in a second or 2)\n\n\n*And I am left with the file still help under drag conditions to drop wherever I want within the full screen app\nThis method uses a variety of inputs including gestures and keyboard shortcuts that may not be available to you depending on your hardware.  For example, using the trackpad allows me to perform simultaneous gestures like swiping desktops whilst in the middle of a drag operation that would not be possible with a mouse (maybe with a magic mouse, I don't own one).  It's a case of knowing that gestures are actually pretty powerful when you understand that the hardware uses the multitouch to let you do a lots more than you might be used to.\nThis seems a whole load of hassle, but as actually quite quick once you get into it.  As to why you do it this way, I think you need to contemplate the nature of full screen of Mac OS X, and this means appreciating that when you go full screen you lose the whole desktop metaphor, and this includes the desktop in addition to resizable window edges, so you need to quickly nip into a windowed desktop to be able to see behind those windows to the desktop, if you see what I mean.\n\nA: Here's a simple way to jump to Desktop 1 (or 2).\nYou can turn on this shortcut by:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences  \n\n*Keyboard\n\n*Shortcuts\n\n*under Mission Control\n\n*click Switch to Desktop 1\nthere you will see the default option is ^1.\nNow you can jump to desktop 1 from any full screen app by pressing control 1\n\nA: You can directly copy to/from the desktop to/from fullscreen mode using drag-and-drop.

I use the TOP RIGHT corner for Mission Control and the BOTTOM RIGHT for Show Desktop. However, as the OP mentioned, they cannot access the desktop using various methods or shortcuts when starting in a Full-Screen Space, including Show Desktop. Yet, Mission Control DOES work. So, if you are in Full-Screen and need to go to the Desktop or vice-versa, use the drag-and-drop method. Click and hold on the item, drag the pointer to the top-right corner, Mission Control will show all your open Spaces, drag over to the space you want and hold until that Space appears. If you're attempting to reach the Desktop, then the Space you want will be one that's not Full-Screen, then once you reach that space and you still don't have open desktop space, drag the cursor to the bottom-right corner and your Desktop will clear to drag to.

As you may already know, Thunderbolt Displays have internal Ethernet adapters which is very convenient in that a user can now connect their wired network connection to their display rather than their MacBook, and when they come in to work in the morning, the only thing they need to connect to their MacBook is the MagSafe adapter and Thunderbolt cable, both which come from their display. Essentially, the display is now acting as a docking station with all of the most commonly used ports on the display sent over the Thunderbolt connection to their MacBook.\nHowever, this convenience presents a problem on more heavily managed networks like my own (e.g. enterprise) that use DHCP reservations.\nTraditionally, when a new Macintosh comes in, a system administrator would add the MAC address of the wired ethernet port on the Mac to our DHCP server, and associate it with an IP address. That MAC address will now always get the same IP address assigned to it via DHCP. This is a tried and true method employed on most enterprise networks, regardless of operating system/platform (this all happens at the network level). When that MacBook connects to my network via the wired connection, it will now always get the same IP address – the one that I've designated in DHCP.\nApple has set a new expectation of using the Thunderbolt display as a docking station. This is convenient, but it introduces a problem. Now that Thunderbolt displays have on-board ethernet with a MAC address on the display itself they are the connection point to the network. It would be easy to start adding reservations for displays to our DHCP server, but ultimately foolish because it wouldn't gain us anything in manageability and would only serve to confuse us or slow us down as systems administrators when we're trying to access client workstations for remote support and administration.\nI want DHCP reservations to still get honored for the Macs on my network, even if they are behind a Thunderbolt display. This way users can move around and plug their MacBooks into any of our Thunderbolt displays and still get the same hostname and IP address from DNS and DHCP, giving them consistency, and making administration as straightforward as it once was.\nSo I ask you, fellow Mac administrators. How would you handle this situation?\n\nA: This depends a lot on your DHCP server, but I would look into using the client id to assign static IPs. It's not tied to the individual hardware (although you'd have to set it at least once when they first use a TB Display), so it avoids the switching displays problem. It can be set via the networksetup tool.\n\nA: Simply assign a static IP to the Network Adapter of the screen and remove the reservation.\n", "Q: Printing to Windows Server shared printers from an iPad We have a VP who wants to print from his iPad. We have a few printers shared off our DC running Windows Server 2008 r2. All of the iPad apps that I've found have not worked very well. Has anyone had any success with getting iOS devices to print on a Windows network?\n\nA: Ignore the offical advice from Apple, they just want you to splash yet more of your cash on a licensed AirPrint printer. Here's the good news. Even on iOS5 (and iOS6), most printers can be AirPrint enabled via Windows without buying a new printer. Here are two ways to get what you want.\nFree solution (requires tinkering)\nIf you don't mind doing a bit of configuration legwork, get JasonHD's fantastic AirPrint Installer from the MacRumors forum: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1293865\nAirPrint Installer is fully iOS5 and iOS6 compatible. The first post in the thread contains a link to download the software; the rest of the thread has tips for troubleshooting if you can't get it to work.\nPaid solution (just works)\nOn the other hand, if you're a technophobe and don't mind a small outlay... get FingerPrint:\nhttp://www.collobos.com/\nCosts $19.99 and has a free trial so you can confirm it works with your printer.\nEither way, you should be AirPrinting without a new a printer in no time...\n\nA: There's a guide here for that particular version of Windows server, although I suspect it applies to others as well.\nThe conceptual version is that you need two components - a program to convert from the iPad's AirPrint protocol to something the networked printers understand, and then a service to advertise the availability of the printer via Bonjour (aka zero-conf networking).\nThe reason you can't just hook up to standard printing services is that the iPad doesn't have any printer drivers, it offloads that responsibility to the printer, so if it's not an AirPrint-native printer, an intermediary has to do some of the extra work.\n\nA: For an office environment it's hard to beat an inexpensive piece of hardware to serve up a dozen or more networked printers to iOS.\nLantronix makes the current best of breed model - xPrintServer. The home model is new, but the \"network edition\" has been a stalwart for many sites I've helped.\n\nA: Our business has 300+ users using iPads and apps such as PrintnShare Pro.  http://mobile.eurosmartz.com/products/printnsharepro.html\nThe beauty of this app is that they can print over 3G or Proxy as well as over wifi ; so great for the mobility element and can swap between users without compromising any security. Our Sales troops even print from their trunk as well as direct to our network printers in Logistics to fulfill orders. Very tidy solution over Windows XP and 2003 at least.\n*  Note I am no way affiliated with the company or get any kickbacks or anything else like the reply says!!

This was concerning to me since I assumed that the iOS passcode was secure; meaning for example that it was part of the boot/build, and without it correctly presented, the phone's data was not accessible. (Yes, I know, silly to think that would be the case.)\nAnyway, at this point after quickly researching the topic, it appears it's possible to delete one file, turn the phone on, have complete access to it, replace the file, and no one would be the wiser.\nNot asking for a how-to - just confirmation that the passcode is meaningless security-wise.\n\nA: One a malicious individual has physical access to the hardware, any protection becomes meaningless, security-wise. \nIf an attacker had the time and resources, they could circumvent any UI-based security by removing (de-soldering) the flash from the logic board, connecting it to another system, and reading any data off them. Only full-disk encryption would block that, but, given physical access and/or time, that's defeatable, too.\n\nA: Just as locks do not work to deter a trained safe-cracker with physical access to a safe, the passcode lock is sometimes amenable to cracking with the correct forensic tools.\nHaving a passcode lock makes it so much harder to break into a phone (beyond the obvious knowledge, time, tools) since you can't run arbitrary programs while the device is in a locked state and on all but the oldest devices, data protection makes it harder to read or write to the encrypted contents and bypass the OS protection.\nUnless you are a target of government or corporate espionage - setting a passcode and instructing the device to wipe itself on repeated failed attempts is quite secure in practice. If you are a target - you better hope the rest of your tracks are as well covered as iOS is.\n\nA: Using the 4-digit standard numeric passcode on an iPhone can be cracked in 45 minutes or so.  Adding an advanced passcode is a better, yet not fail proof option.  Law enforcement has been doing this at an increased rate as of late.  Software like Micro Systemation is often used to crack these 4 digit combinations.  Or they may be relying on certain insecure, older versions of iOS to reset the password.  It's also possible they just put the iPhone in DFU mode, restore it, and give it back without any data!  :)\nAs stated above, given time and physical access, you can be hacked.

For some reason, Apple has imposed a most absurd restriction where the only way to get an iPhone (or other iDevice) to sync with a different computer is by erasing it first. I haven't verified first-hand that this process actually erases the entire iPhone, because, naturally, I'm too afraid to try it.\nSo I spent a long time scouring the web trying to find a way around this ridiculous (and artificial) limitation. I spent literally hours over the course of several days and eventually found a combination of web pages that finally allowed me to do what I needed. I'll summarize the steps here for others who have banged their heads over this one.\n\nA: By design, the iPhone will sync iTunes content with one computer at a time. Any attempt to sync such content with a second computer will result in ALL iTunes content being first erased from your phone & then replaced with the content from the second computer. This is a design feature and cannot be overridden. Because you replaced your computer, or hard drive, your phone will see this as a \"new\" computer. The iTunes content sync is one way: computer to phone. If you have photos that were synced to your iPhone or music ripped on your own, you will first have to copy them from your iPhone using third party software, such as TouchCopy, before you do anything else, as Apple makes no provision to do so. \nOnce you've done that, do the following in the order specified:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable auto sync when an iPod/iPhone is connected under iTunes>Preferences>Devices(under Edit menu if using Windows).\n\n*Make sure you have one contact & one event in the supported applications on your computer(iCal & Address Book on a Mac, Windows Address Book or Outlook if using Windows). These entries can be fake, doesn't matter, the important point is that these programs not be empty.\n\n*Connect your phone, iTunes running, do not sync at this point.\n\n*Store>Authorize this computer.\n\n*File>Transfer Purchases. Also read here: \nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT2519\n\n*Right click your phone in the left device pane & select \"Reset warnings\".\n\n*Right click again and select \"Backup\".\n\n*Right click again & select \"Restore from Backup\", select the backup you just made. When prompted to create another backup, decline. Note music is not part of your iTunes backup and needs to be restored as above.\n\n*This MUST be followed by a sync to restore your iTunes content, which you select from the various tabs, You'll get a popup regarding your contacts & calendars asking to merge or replace, select \"Merge\".\nYour phone should look just like it did when you started, with no data loss.\n\nA: Theres an easier method.  MUCH easier.  Cancel that window.  Your iPhone stays mounted in iTunes.  Right click and choose backup.  After the backup is complete, unplug your iphone and plug it back in.  Then allow it to erase your iPhone, and just restore from your backup.  \n\nA: The first thing to be aware of is that iTunes uses a unique \"Library Persistent ID\" to identify the pairing of an iDevice to an installation of iTunes. This 16-digit hexadecimal id is stored on both the device and the computer it is paired with. iTunes generates a new id when it is installed (or more accurately, when it builds its library). If you plug in an iPhone that has a different persistent id than the copy of iTunes installed on that computer, you will get the warning dialog shown above.\nThe only thing standing in your way, however, is that darn persistent id. To get things working smoothly, we need to hack the installation of iTunes so that it thinks its id is the same as the one on our iPhone.\nTo do that, we first need to figure out what our phone's persistent id is. There are a couple options here, depending on whether or not you have the original synced copy of iTunes still available.\nStep 1: Getting the Persistent ID\nIf you still have the original installation of iTunes that your iDevice is synced with, you can grab the persistent id from the \"iTunes Music Library.xml\" file in your iTunes directory. Just search for the \"Library Persistent ID\" tag.\nIf you no longer have access to that previous installation (as was my case), you need to get the id from your iPhone itself. Luckily there is a sneaky way to do this without having to jailbreak your phone. [If your phone is already jailbroken, you can read it from one of the .plist files in your iTunes directory on the phone, I believe.]\nThe trick is that you need to do a backup of your phone using iTunes and then dig into the backup files to find the persistent id. Fortunately iTunes lets you perform backups without being synced, so you can backup an iPhone on any copy of iTunes.\nUnfortunately, the id is not plainly visible in the backup files. You will need to use a free web script to determine your persistent id from an Info.plist file you upload.\nFull instructions are on this page.\nNow that you have your library persistent id, you need to trick your installations of iTunes into thinking that that id is actually the id it has.\nStep 2: Changing iTunes' Persistent ID\niTunes stores the persistent id in two places, just to make it trickier for us to change: once in the \"iTunes Music Library.xml\" file already mentioned, and once more in the \"iTunes Library.itl\" file, which is a binary file and much trickier to edit.\nAlthough it is (or at least was) supposedly possible to edit the binary file and get it to accept the change, I have not been able to get this to work, so I don't recommend bothering since there is an easier way that doesn't require it.\nFirst, backup the two aforementioned files. Next, open the xml file and paste in your library persistent id obtained from step 1 over the existing id in the <Library Persistent ID> tag and save.\nNow create an empty file and name it \"iTunes Library.itl\". It won't work if you just delete or rename the file. iTunes needs to think it's become corrupt, not just disappeared.\nNow when you start iTunes, it will see the \"corrupt\" library file and will rebuild it for you, from the xml file which contains your new persistent id.\nIf all goes well, after a few minutes of rebuilding your library file (it can take quite a while if you have a large library, mind you), you should be able to plug in your iPhone and sync as if nothing were wrong in the world!\nFor more details (including how to find the iTunes directory on your computer), read this page.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How do I get LaunchBar to open the enclosing folder for a selected file?

I want to install some version of Linux on my 1st gen Apple TV.\nWhat Linux variants can be installed on an Apple TV?\nBonus points: is this even a good idea?  How useful is the Apple TV as a computer?  Do you have a link to detailed tech specs?\n\nA: The first generation Apple TV had a pretty low powered Intel CPU, as you can see in the specs here. So in theory, you should be able to run just about any Linux distro, just a question of how much hacking you're willing to do.\nThere are a bunch of resources for doing this, but a good one is at the atv-bootloader project. There are tools to create a nice USB stick that should do most of the work for you.\nAs for how useful it is, don't expect much for general purpose computing - after all it's a 1 GHz Pentium-M with 256 MB of RAM. But it may do reasonably well for some home theatre tasks, or if you need a home automation server or similar box.\n\nA: OpenElec 2.0 is made for ATV v1 and 2 and supports the newer HD encoder you can install.\n\nA: Is better that you install the OSMC\nBest regards!\n\nA: If you have an apple tv it works very well with openelec 3, even better with a Broadcom BCM970012 or BCM970015 Crystal HD card fitted, but this way you lose the wireless network unless you add wireless usb, wich is well supported i openelec.  I have RPi also and prefer the ATV as dedicated openelec media server and the RPi as my little linux box, which is no surprise as the ATV was designed as a media server and the RPi as lovely little computer :-) but I do keep a dedicated 16gb openelec SD card for the RPi for when I am on the move. Considering I bought my ATV over 5 years ago, the Linux, XBMC, openelec solution has kept the ATV from being consigned to the scrap heap long ago, to the point of it being now, as good as the RPi and maybe better in some cases and is a far better solution than some of those media playes sold today.\nShort answer now you have the RPi, install openelec 3 on the ATV for media centre fun and use the RPi for good old Linux fun, with GPIO and all the goodies it was designed with :-)\nCheers\nIan\n", "Q: How to Have CSS Content Preview in Finder?

It's worth a shot, I guess.\n", "Q: Where does Time Machine store its cache? Mine is sometimes corrupted Whenever a backup is run, Time Machine says \"Preparing Backup...\". During this stage, it looks for what files have been changed since the last backup by comparing changes in the Event Log (I assume) with its cache of files on the system.\nBecause of the cache, the Preparing stage is usually quite fast (30 seconds), but for some reason, sometimes when I restart from Boot Camp (Windows 7) into OS X, Time Machine's cache is wiped clean or corrupted. I know this because the Preparing stage takes 10 minutes after booting back into OS X.\nSo, that's why I'm wondering where the cache is located so perhaps I could determine why it's sometimes corrupted.\n\nA: There could be any number of different factors involved in why Time Machine is doing a full scan after using Windows/Bootcamp. From what you describe it seems out of sync, as if your system is telling Time Machine 'this volume is not like it was, so do a full scan'. One of the first things that might give you an idea of what is going on would be to open Console immediately after Time Machine kicks in with 'Preparing...'. By observing fseventsd, system.log, and backupd you should be able to get a better picture of what might be taking place. You can type any of those terms in the search box of Console to see a consolidated list of those events.\nThis article is also an excellent in-depth guide to Time Machine; it covers just about everything you could imagine, so take a look.\n", "Q: No Keys Repeating on New MacBook Pro After Changing Key Repeat Speed I just opened my new Retina Display MacBook Pro and everything worked fine, but when I tried to go into System Preferences to make the key repeat speed faster, none of the keys repeated, not even numbers and symbols.\nIf I type defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false into terminal, it works, but it disables the accented key popup when holding down keys such as A and E, which I use often.\nThis worked perfectly on my old 2009 MacBook Pro that was running 10.7.4.  I have restarted this computer and reset the key repeat speed, but have still had no luck.

I have several albums on DVD with both Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1 versions. I'd like to be able to listen to them without dealing with physical disks all the time.\nI have no problem using ffmpeg to pull the audio data out and stick it in a file, but I haven't been able to find the magic format that will let it play via Apple TV. I've read that the Apple TV doesn't need to understand the format, it just needs to send the data to a receiver that does, which makes perfect sense, but how do I get it to do that? I can't get a WAV containing DTS to work.\nIf the solution ends up being to stick the AC3 data in a video container, that's fine, but ideally, I just want to store/play the audio (and ideally, it would be the DTS version).\nI have both a 1st and a 3rd generation Apple TV (a.k.a. the Apple TV 2 with 1080p support), so any solution, old or new, will do.\n\nA: Yes. The Apple TV can pass through 5.1 AC-3 to a receiver if you set up the file correctly. Apple has the full details in a knowledge base article, but basically you need to set up your mp4/m4v file with a stereo AAC as the default audio track, then put your AC-3 track after it, disabled. On the Apple TV, you need to enable it by turning on Dolby Digital Out in the Audio Settings.\n\nA: AppleTV will pass through an AC3 5.1 audio track if it's a secondary audio track (with AAC the primary). You need to embed the audio into an m4v file and make sure all tracks have the same language setting (including \"Unknown\"), but you can use empty video and AAC tracks and just add the AC3 Passthru track as the only actual data. Then if you mark it as \"Music Video\" in iTunes, iTunes will treat it as if it's a music file (and it'll show up with other music files). Things get more complex with music that segues between tracks, since iTunes cannot stream \"videos\" seamlessly one into another like it can with music.\n", "Q: How to get 3 1900x1200 monitors working on a 2010 Mac Pro I have a new Mac Pro with a single ATI 5770 card installed. It has two mini-display ports, and one DVI port\nI have tried the following configurations:\n\n\n*\n\n*All 3 DVI connections: This results in one monitor always being black\n\n*2 Mini to 2 VGA and one DVI - This results in the VGA monitors having a max resolution of 1920x1080 but defaulting to 1600x1200 due to the aspect ratio. All monitors have a 1920x1200 resolution, but only the DVI port is giving this resolution\n\n*All 3 VGA with a DVI to VGA converter on the DVI port - Same result as #2. The monitor plugged into the DVI->VGA port has full resolution. The two Mini->VGA are limited to 1920x1080\nMy question:\nIs this even possible without Apple's dual link adapters?\n\nA: According to Apple's specs listed under Tech Specs for the Mac Pro it should be able to handle 3 displays at up to 2560 by 1600 pixels over the digital connections. I think the trouble is coming from a little known about techology from AMD called Eyefinity. Which seems to require \"Active\" Adapters in order to run more than 2 displays at a time.\nAccording to AMD who makes the ATI 5770 card.\n\nWhat are the basic requirements for connecting multiple displays?\nConnecting multiple monitors for AMD Eyefinity technology couldn’t be simpler. There are four easy rules to remember:\n\n*\n\n*The first two monitors can connect to the graphics card with any display output on your product: HDMI, VGA, DVI or DisplayPort.\n\n\n*The third (or greater) display must be connected to the graphics card via DisplayPort.\n\n\n*If your monitor does not have a DisplayPort connection, you will need an inexpensive active DisplayPort adapter for it. DVI to DP adapters can be had for less than $30 USD.2\n\n\n*Every family of GPUs supports a different maximum number of displays.\n\nIt looks like you may have the passive  adapters for  the MiniDP to DVI adapters. and hence the trouble and why only 2 displays work when all DVI. Note that the MiniDP to VGA are active adapters.\nWith the 1920 X 1200 resoultion you will be fine with Single Link adapters, you just need active mini display port to DVI adapters. For some guidance on obtaining compatible adapters see AMD Eyefinity Validated Dongles\nAs noted in a similar question in the Apple Store:\n\nQ:To use three monitors, does this work with the recently-available active single-link DP to DVI adapters (NOT the simple passive one that Apple [sold])?\nLate last year, active single-link DVI adapters became available that function in the same way as the active dual-link adapter that Apple sells, but is intended for use with smaller, single-link monitors. These provide the same added intelligence that the dual-link adapters provide, but only support single-link resolutions. This makes them much cheaper (typically around $30) and they don't don't require the extra power of a USB port.\nCan these adapters be used with this card in a mid-2010 (5,1) Mac Pro to drive the second and third monitors in a three-monitor setup?\nAnswer: To run 3 monitors with this card - 2 of them need to be \"active\" on the display port connections.\nI run the card with 2 display port monitors (an HP and DELL) and 1 DVI monitor - (A 1080p projector with an hdmi/dvi passive adapter). I'm doing this in both a 2010 and 2008 mac pro.\nI assume because of this, you can buy the active dual-link dvi/dp adapter and get the same results.\nBut I can confirm you can't do this with a passive adapter.\n\n", "Q: How to fix a situation where a new iPad 2 causes other macs to disconnect from Wi-Fi?

I have since reinstalled everything, updated to IOS 5 and have sync'd the phone via iTunes etc. But I still can't see it and can't find a way of adding it to as an app, if that's what I need to do.\nHow to get the Camera icon back?\n\nA: You actually can't remove the Camera app, but you can move it. Perhaps it is hidden in a group.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings -> General -> Reset and tap \"Reset Home Screen Layout\".\n\n\n\"Camera\" should reappear in the first page, but if it doesn't its likely a parental control or a profile restricting camera use. \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings -> General -> profiles and delete all of the ones you don't need. Inspect the ones you wish to keep to see if one restricts the camera. \n\n\nIf that still doesn't work, you'll want to back the device up and restore it to get if a hardware or software problem is causing the problem. \n\nA: When this happened to me I followed the following instructions; go to Settings > General > Restrictions. Then toggle the Camera Off then On again.\nExit, then the Camera icon should be back.\n\nA: As it's not possible to remove stock apps, you should be able to find Camera by using the Search iPhone feature. (Press Home button or swipe left-to-right when in the first screen.)\nWhen you type \"camera\" to the search field, the results should give access to Camera and reveal the folder it possibly is in. If result doesn't list any folder on the right side, then Camera should be in some of the screens.\n\nA: As David said, it's impossible to delete a stock app such as the Camera app. Your daughter could have done one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Moved the Camera app into a folder somewhere. If this is the case, simply open Settings, go to General, scroll down to Reset, and tap \"Reset Home Screen Layout\".\n\n*This is less likely, but it is possible that she created a restriction for the Camera. In this case, you will have to get the restriction passcode that she (accidentally) set. Once you have this, open Settings, go to General, open Restrictions, type in the passcode, and switch Camera back to \"On\". From there you can also disable any other restrictions she may have set.\n\n\nA: Scroll to next pages and make sure you have to scroll up to last page because the same thing happened with my camera and I wasted lot of time in finding two pages as I had actually two pages and I didn't realize that the camera has moved to 3rd page.\n", "Q: Change label on USB drive in OSX Terminal I am trying to write a program in Python that will rename a USB drive (from the standard \"USB DISK\" to my custom \"MYDISK\").\nHowever, I can't find any way to do this neither in Python nor in OSX Terminal. (I figured, if I can make it work in Terminal, I can simply use os.system(\"command\") in Python).\nThe USB drive is a FAT32 formatted flash drive on filesystem /dev/disk2s1, and it is by default mounted on /Volumes/USB DISK\nWhat I have tried so far: (from http://techbu.com/2009/06/28/renaming-usb-drive-labels-in-linux)\nsudo umount /Volumes/USB\\ DISK            ## Works fine\nsudo mlabel -i /dev/disk2s1 ::MYDISK      ## Command not found!\n\nIt seems that the \"mlabel\" command is not found in OSX Terminal.

How to install new font on OS X to be used across OpenOffice, iWork, OfficeForMac, mail and other word processing applications?\n\nA: A third option would be to open the files (for all typefaces), and click the Install Font button in the window, which copies the font files to ~/Library/Fonts/.\n\nI usually just move the files manually because I keep each font in their own folder.\n\nA: You can use the application Font Book which is part of your default OS install in your applications folder.\nOpen is up, hit the menus, and check out File > Add Fonts then navigate to the files in question.\n\nA: Using Finder, drag the font files to folder /Library/Fonts.\nOr drag the font files to folder /Users/<your user name>/Library/Fonts when you would like to install the fonts for usage in your own account only.\n\nA: I usually use RightFont to install my fonts, maybe it can help you.\n\nA: To clarify gentmatt's comment, you download the .ttf file, double click to open it, then a new dialog shows up with some examples using it, click \"install font\" in the lower right hand corner, and you're done.\nThis installs it \"for the current user\" into your ~/Library/Fonts folder.\nMost applications seem to pick it up and use it \"next time they refresh the screen\" (instantaneously for some), but without restart anyway.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu on a 1st gen Apple TV? I want to install Ubuntu on my 1st gen Apple TV.\nHow should I go about doing this, using as little third-party software as possible?\n\nA: Most of the time when installing Linux on the Apple TV, you are doing it in order to unlock more capabilities when it comes to video playback and options; I assume this is what you are looking for. If you follow these recently updated instructions everything should go fine. Just be careful to read them thoroughly. \nThey will walk you through two different options: running from a USB stick and not touching the Apple TV hard drive, or installing Ubuntu (CrystalBuntu) on the Apple TV itself. I would highly recommend the first: In the case you don't like it, you can just power off, unplug the USB and, then restart; everything would be back to normal. It has both Mac and PC/Linux instructions in there depending on what you have to work with.\nInstall Instructions\nI know that the link says things about XBMC but it is for installing Ubuntu on it so that you can run XBMC too, its a very good media player option. It involves installing Crystalbuntu, a port of Ubuntu with media player options using XBMC.\nHere is a nice how to video as well that goes over the booting from a USB stick option:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJqyr0QRRvU\nUPDATED\nI understand that you want to do an install that will leave you with a desktop/server environment, which is also possible.\nThere are also a few other different options for installing a regular version of Linux, like Ubuntu 8.04 and even Arch Linux, with these, you will have a regular desktop and such, as you can see in this example video:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko0cwbGsKHU\nThis process, discussed here on Ask Different, goes over the way a bootloader can be copied and used to boot most versions of linux:\nWhat Linux variants can be installed on an 1st generation Apple TV?\nThe direct page link is here:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/atv-bootloader/wiki/InstallingLinux\nThis page, has talks about the atv (Apple Tv) Bootloaders and how to use them.\nFor simpler install though you can download and run there is the following link, which will install the OS of your choice on an USB Drive and do all the heavy lifting can be found here:\nhttp://stmlabs.com/2011/03/28/crystalhd-released/\nHere is a direct link to the installer download page with more instructions:\nhttp://www.stmlabs.com/projects/crystalhd-for-appletv/\nAlso, if you google search \"Install Linux on an Apple TV 1st Gen\" you can find loads of helpful articles too.\nI hope that this helps you out.\n\nA: To add to the post by @de_an77, I came across this very detailed walkthrough.  It references the code.google link in the other answer, but it actually adds quite a bit... explaining each line etc.\nI saved the link because it appears to be an excellent resource, but I never did test it.\n\nA: I succeeded in creating a USB flash drive  Crystalbuntu disc from my PPC MAC and my 1st generation Apple TV booted from the flash drive no problem. I didn't have a USB hub or keyboard and the command line reported a fail for a sync file before asking for a login where my project ended.

I have made a chart in Numbers '09 and now I want to create another very similar chart but with different data, so I have copied and pasted the chart and now I want to make it take its source data from a different table.\nWhen I select the chart I can see a blue box with a grey header indicating the data-source in the table, but I can't drag this into another table - so how do I change it?\n\nA: As far as I know there is no way to make the desired changes all at once, but there is a way that you can make things significantly faster than creating a brand new chart. \nAs it appears you've already done, copy and paste the chart into your Numbers worksheet. Depending on the chart you've created, select an individual line, bar, pie segment etc. and open the chart pane in the inspector. Here's a screenshot of what that looks like (with \"Example 2\" being the copied and pasted chart):\n\nAs you can see, in the field labeled \"Data,\" Table 1 is referenced. This source can easily be changed to a different table. Just delete the listed source and select the new source of data from your worksheet (you don't have to type in the source). Depending on your chart you may also want to change the data source for the x-axis labels. This is also controlled by the inspector. That can be changed here:\n\nWhile you'll have to change the data source for each line of the chart, it's certainly faster than creating a whole new chart and having to format it the way you'd like. \n\nA: Actually there is a more efficient way of doing this: \n\n\n*\n\n*Select both table and chart (drag the cursor or hold ⌘ Cmd and click on both).\n\n*Duplicate them (⌘ Cmd+D) or copy and paste (⌘ Cmd+C, ⌘ Cmd+V).\n\n*Fill the duplicated table with your new data. \nThe duplicated chart already references the duplicated table so the only work you will have to do is copy the new data from your table to the duplicated one. \nIt worked really well for me.\n", "Q: Can I block or disable hotspot mode in iOS 5.1?

To reproduce/debug an issue exclusive to OS X 10.5, i was trying install Leopard on my Mac Mini (model \"macmini3,1\", came with Snow Leopard).\nHowever, when trying to boot from a Leopard install medium (tried both from DVD and USB stick) the machine just hangs:\n\n\n*\n\n*when manually choosing the boot medium: hangs with the boot medium selection screen still displayed \n\n*when running the install app from Snow Leopard and letting it restart the machine: hangs with the bright grayish screen and no logo or progress indicator\n\n\nDoes anyone happen to know what could cause this / how to work around it?  \nOr could my models hardware be too new for 10.5? Although a web search suggests there were/are macmini3,1s with 10.5 running. Also, this question and it's resource suggest it should be working.\n\nA: The usual Apple way is that a set of generic OSX disks only support all machines that come out before that OS (How would any know what a new machine might have changed). Machines released after an OS release will include boot disks that can be loaded by that machine but earlier versions might not.\nThus I suspect that your mini is unsupported for Leopard or people bought it earlier with a leopard version for that machine.\n\nA: It sounds like you are trying to boot from a Power PC version of the System on an Intel processor computer. \n", "Q: What's wrong with my screen?

Apple read them and when they get enough request for a feature they get more incentive to implement it.\n\nA: Check out InterConneX from Econ Technologies:\nhttp://www.econtechnologies.com/interconnex/overview.html\nInterConneX is free but to connect to a Mac, you need to purchase one of their other applications. It's not a well-known app, but it's quite cool what it can do.\n", "Q: USB vs FW400 for iMac G4 external backup drive? I am setting up an old iMac G4 running Mac OS X 10.5.8 as a computer to back things up from my network. I.e. it uses SSHFS to mount network shares and back up their contents (about 120GB) to a connected external LaCie rugged hard drive (the iconic orange one).\nThe hard drive has USB3 and FW800, both of which are not present on the iMac. However, I have a FW800 to FW400 adapter cable, and the USB3 cable works with the iMac's USB port (which is USB2 right?).\nMy question is which one will be faster? Does it even matter whether I use the USB3 to USB2 versus FW800 to FW400 connection? Thanks!\n\nA: Firewire 400 will be considerably faster than USB in this case, as FW has its own dedicated chipset, whereas USB requires CPU time and shares its bus with all other USB devices.\n", "Q: iPad 2 certain emails received are gibberish Why are some emails I send to others received in gibberish- containing dozens of extra characters?

Most implementations of Markdown would leave me with a circuitous route at best to get a Word file.\nPerhaps more importantly, I'd want to be able to format things like footnotes/endnotes, which don't have any representation in Markdown or Multimarkdown, as far as I know.\nIs there anything like this out there? Basically a flavor of Markdown oriented toward print rather than the screen?\n\nA: John Gruber, one of the two inventors of Markdown, uses footnotes fairly extensively on Daring Fireball; to see his raw (pre-Markdown) formatting, append .text to one of his urls, like this: http://daringfireball.net/2012/07/this_ipad_mini_thing.text.\nAs far as converting Markdown to RTF, textutil is your friend. You can pipe the output of the Markdown.pl command to textutil like so:\n/usr/local/bin/Markdown.pl | /usr/bin/textutil -stdin -stdout -format html -convert rtf | pbcopy # or whatever else you want to do with it\n\nInstead of piping to pbcopy (which puts the rich text on the clipboard), you could > it to a .rtf file, or whatever else your workflow dictates.\n\nA: You can also use pandoc:\npandoc -f markdown -t docx file.md -o file.docx\n\nOne advantage compared to textutil is that the output uses paragraph styles. You can also use styles from an existing file with --reference-docx file.docx.\n\nA: iA Writer offers formatted Word (.docx) to Markdown import and export: iAWriter.com\n\n", "Q: what is different with Safari and other webkit Why Safari on Mac OS X can execute processingjs on local without web server like MAMP but not Chrome? There is a Apache Server include in Mac OS ?\nHere is a zip folder sample.\n\nA: I didn't know that Safari could execute PHP; the only way that I believe that it could do this is by using Mac OS X's built-in Apache server and placing the files in the \"Sites\" folder.  You can activate this server by using Web Sharing in System Preferences.\n\nA: PHP is a server-side programming language, it cannot be executed in the browser and needs to be interpreted by the server.\nApart from MAMP, you can also use the built-in Apache installation with OS X or a package manager like Homebrew or MacPorts to install a webserver with PHP support.\n", "Q: iTunes Album Artwork I listen to a lot of indie music and so have a lot of songs that were released as singles and have their own album artwork. I always use the list view that displays album artwork on the left. I also combine a lot of the singles that I have into albums which I use to sort them. iTunes seems to randomly choose one of their artworks to display as the artwork for the entire album, is there any way I could set one artwork for the album and also have separate artwork for the individual songs?\n\nA: No, iTunes and related apps use the artwork from the initial track of each album. Yes, it is frustrating. And no, it is not worth retagging your songs to pretend each of the tracks is its own album.\nI asked what is essentially the same question over here:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/11081/how-can-i-force-front-row-to-show-me-single-artwork-instead-of-album-artwork\nIn case you want to ask Apple to add this feature, here is the feedback page for iTunes:\nhttp://www.apple.com/feedback/itunesapp.html \n", "Q: How to set up an iMac not to look for USB Flash drive info during boot up? Short question: is there a way to disable an iMac's USB Flash Drive boot up so that boot up time is faster?\n\nDetails:\nMy iMac has an external USB hub, and it has 3, 4 or sometimes 6 or 7 USB Flash drives plugged into the hub.  But during the boot up of the iMac, there seems to be 20 seconds or 25 seconds before the spinning wheel of the Boot up screen shows up.  During this 20 to 25 seconds, the light of the USB Flash drives can blink for several times.\nIf I unplug all those USB drives, then the boot up is faster.\nIs there a way to tell the iMac not to look for the USB Flash drive info during boot up time?  Maybe it was trying to see if those drives contain any bootable image...  I already set in the System Preference to boot up from the Hard Drive, so maybe there needs to be some extra setting to tell the iMac not to look for any boot info in the USB Flash drive -- is there any way to do that?\n\nA: Interesting question, but I assume there is no way you can disable the \"probing\" of attached USB devices on startup. After all, the system has to find out about the characteristics of attached devices, be it sound in/outputs, keyboards, mice or mass storage devices.\n\nA: The only way I can think of is to unplug the hub before start-up.  \n", "Q: Permissions issues with shared folder I have a 27\" iMac (Snow Leopard) that has four accounts.  Two admins (my wife and I) and two kids.  With one of the kids being a restricted account (locked down for 8 year old).\nAnyway, I also have a MBP that I use for development.  100% of my code is in my DropBox folder.  That folder is also on the iMac.  So when I update my code, the changes get synced to the iMac.\nHowever, there are many problems.  First, the DropBox location on the iMac is in the Shared folder.  But I STILL get permission problems with the other accounts.  Even the other admin account.  I have gone in and told the OS to give read/write permissions (and all sub folders) to all accounts in the DropBox folder.  Still doesn't work.\nI constantly get access denied on the other accounts accessing that folder.  My guess is because I am creating the file on my MBP and sending over with MY account.\nShould I create the same users on my MBP and give them access?  That seems ridiculous.\nAny other suggestions?\nEDIT\nBy DropBox, I mean the SERVICE DropBox.  I want the DropBox folder to be read/write for all users because we also use it for photos, etc.\n\nA: The concept behind having a drop box is write Only for others and read only for the owner of the Dropbox (the user in this case). So If you are looking to have a shared folder then try creating a new folder in your user's public folder or on your Macintosh HD and share it. Let us know if you find problems with this approach. \nMy understanding of the question is you are looking for a common folder between your MBP and iMac and not about applying proper share permissions on the DropBox folder.\n\nA: I would want to know if you are logged in with multiple accounts at the same time and using the fast user switching? If so, one login may be 'holding' onto permissions of the dropbox folder. It would do this so the changes that are made by one account can't effect the changes in progress on another account. This would be what the dropbox agent that runs in the background is doing. Try logging into only one account and make sure the others are not running.\n\nA: It is not likely a permissions problem, its a file locking problem. Another user on your Mac may have a finder window looking at your Dropbox folder, which locks the files. OS X incorrectly reports this error as inadequate permissions, but it really a lock file. See this article for more on this error:\nOdd Permissions Issues on Windows Share\n", "Q: MBP15: 45W works only right after unplugging 85W My MBP15 (8,2, Late 2012) doesn't normally charge or draw power from a 45W adapter (from a 2008 MBA), with one exception: \n\n\n*\n\n*First, plug in the 85W power adapter;\n\n*Second, switch the adapters quickly.\n\n\nFollowing this procedure the MBP15 draws power form a 45W without any glitch for light usage.\nQ1: Why is this procedure necessary and how does it work?\nQ2: Is there a way to skip step (1)?\n\nA: As far as I know, the 15-inch MacBook Pro is not supposed to use the 45W power adapter.  Therefore, when you plug in the 85W and quickly swap in the 45W, you are essentially tricking the MacBook into thinking that it is still charging from the 85W power source.  \nI don't believe this to be dangerous to your MacBook in any way, but it is definitely a hack and it is unlikely that this can be done without using an 85W adapter.\n", "Q: Chrome loses cookies on browser restart I have cookies set to 'Allow local data to be set (recommended)' and yet, whenever I restart Chrome, I have to re-login to sites like reddit/facebook/google which should be keeping me logged in.\n\nA: Make sure that on those sites you select the \"Remember Me\" option, as websites can set an expiration time for the cookies, which is what appears to be happening here.\n", "Q: How to list all files in directory excluding any that start with a dot? I'm currently using the command \nfind /Volumes/DriveName > driveName.txt\n\nto create a file listing of all files that are on the drive.\nHow could I modify my command (or what would be a better command) to have the list not include any dot files, for example ._Filename or .DSstore?\nI'm not looking for software like CDFinder etcetera to keep a searchable database. I need a text output that contains all the files on the disk, as well as their relative locations to each other.\n\nA: This isn't remotely Mac-specific, but you can pipe your output through grep. More particularly, the -v option will exclude lines that match the pattern you are looking for (in your case, filenames beginning with a .).\nSo instead of \nfind /Volumes/DriveName > driveName.txt\n\nyou can enter\nfind /Volumes/DriveName | grep -v '\\/\\.' > driveName.txt\n\n\nA: I was going to recommend tree as an alternative, but I realized it's not installed by default on OS X. However if you don't mind following some straightforward instructions to compile it yourself, it might be a useful tool for your purposes. It takes any directory and gives you a nice ASCII based tree of all the subfolders and files therein (and by default it omits hidden/dot files).\nSample output:\n~$ tree test\ntest\n├── alpha\n│   ├── testA\n│   ├── testB\n│   └── testC\n├── num\n│   ├── test1\n│   ├── test2\n│   └── test3\n├── test X\n├── test Y\n└── test Z\n\n\nA: To exclude files and directories add an exclusion pattern to the find command (see info find for more):\nfind /Volumes/DriveName -not -path '*/.*' > driveName.txt\n\n\nA: You can use ListAllFiles from the App Store.\n", "Q: iOS Icon Update Delay I installed the update for the official iOS Twitter icon a couple of days ago and noticed that even though the update advertised a new icon, the icon didn't change when the update installed.  Today I just looked at my phone and the new icon is there.  Is there usually a delay between update installation and icon update?  If so, how long is it supposed to be and why does it occur?\n\nA: There shouldn't be any delay. It's likely it's just a bug - perhaps one of the graphics files in the app file didn't get swapped out. It happened with Reeder for iPhone recently. Or the release notes were in error (I note they don't seem to mention any icon update now).\n", "Q: Filevault login screen slow to start after trying to install Windows using bootcamp Since trying to install Windows 7 on my iMac with Lion 10.7.4, using Boot Camp, I noticed that the login screen where it asks for the FileVault password is taking a lot of seconds to be displayed. \nWhen I turn on the computer, after the sound only a blank screen is shown for a lot for seconds.\nEven after removing the Windows partition using Boot Camp, this slow down persists.\nAnyone with similar problem, or solution?\n\nA: The common cause is when the OS X EFI isn't selected in startup preferences (and then stored in NVRAM) so the system needs to read all drives before defaulting to the lowest numbered Mac volume. \nA more oddball case would be if the kernel caches are somehow invalid and must be recreated which slows a boot sequence considerably. \n", "Q: Alternative to FaceTime or iMessages to communicate with Android devices? How can I contact my friends that have no Apple products (iOS or OS X) in similar manner to using FaceTime or iMessage?\n\nA: Well, you cannot use iMessage or FaceTime with non-Apple devices.  With iMessage on the iPhone, the phone will switch to SMS messages when contacting non-iPhone users, but that's it.\nFortunately, there are alternatives to FaceTime and iMessage that are cross-platform.\nAlternatives to FaceTime:\n\n\n*\n\n*Skype (Mac, PC, iPhone, Android, Windows Phone)\n\n*Tango (PC, iPhone, Android, Windows Phone)\n\n\nAlternatives to iMessage:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kik (iPhone, Android, Windows Phone, BlackBerry)\n\n*Facebook Messenger (Works on pretty much anything with a web browser)\n\n\nA: I recommend Telegram. It's fast, well designed, works on every platform (including web browser), requires no registering ala whatsapp, and provides sophisticated encryption options if privacy is a concern for you.\nUsing it for years with both iPhone and Android friends without any issues!\n\nA: Check up this answer here. I love Talkatone because it uses Google Voice -- unfortunately Google Voice supports only US to provide a Google Voice number (this may change in the future). Anyway, the Google Voice -app is a god-sent for cheap international calls and sync with with Google Contacts and Facebook contacts.\nInstead of hacking with apps such as Skype, I chose Google Voice and Facetime/iMessages although it costs a bit to use but better integration and no interest to set up new accounts to new services.\n\nA: For an alternative to iMessage, check out Viber — it works on all popular mobile platforms and integrates with their address books.\n\nA: WhatsApp has matured of late and has seen wide adoption across various mobile platforms. They even have apps for Windows PC and Mac along with mobile apps for major platforms and a Web app.\nWhatsApp has added Audio and Video call features (which are quite similar to FaceTime Audio and Video), and the recent version are integrated deeply in iOS and Android. Audio and Video calls can be received just like regular calls, even when the app is not running (but an active Internet connection is required).\nIt is mandatory to run WhatsApp using a mobile app, as the new account registration is done using an active mobile phone number. The WhatsApp mobile apps needs to be running for Desktop and Web app to work.\n", "Q: What advantage does clicking a menu separator have? If you click a separator in a menu, such as the right click menu in Finder, it closes again. Why? In all other environments it does nothing, why has Apple decided to close the menu? Is it to avoid accidental clicks?\nEDIT:\nAlso, clicking at the very top or bottom of a contextual menu does nothing! Talk about consistency. Why are these different to the separators?\nEDIT 2:\nAs of macOS Sierra, clicking the separator does nothing :D\n\nA: History.\nIn the original Macintosh's System Software in 1984, Apple decided that releasing the mouse button over a menu separator should dismiss the menu. This was probably because they viewed holding down the mouse button as a form of concentration; letting go of the button meant it should go away. Where the mouse was didn't matter. You could even be outside the menus entirely, but not pointing at anything particular on the screen.\nLater, when Apple made menus click instead of hold, the behaviour was copied over. That was years ago, the the behaviour is still the same.\n(It actually probably predates 1984; the Lisa probably did the same.)\nI think this was absolutely the right behaviour for click-and-hold menus, but click-and-hold requires more coordination than click.\n", "Q: OSX Lion: Long press menu automatic selection I've recently upgraded to OSX Lion and I find the long press menu with accented characters very handy when I have to type in french. The only problem is that it's slowing me down a lot having to long press THEN select which character I'd like to have.\nTherefore I'm looking for a way to automatically select the first option if another key is pressed. Example: the first option for \"c\" is ç but I have to long press then press 1 to get it. The behaviour I'm looking for is when I'm typing the word \"ça\" I don't have to press 1, I just long press \"c\" and type \"a\" but because I long pressed the key I get a \"ç\" and the word \"ça\".\nOther questions have been concerned with changing characters in the popup list but I didn't find any concerning this. Is there an option I missed? Do you have any leads on how I could obtain such a behaviour (it doesn't matter if it involves programming or fiddling with the command line)?\n\nA: UPDATE: I misunderstood your question and the answer is you can't. The way it works is kinda lame  but i haven't found a way to change that.\nThey way I do it, is I long press the key and then use the right arrow key to select the one I want, so a single right arrow key will put you in the first item. But then again, this is not the \"automatically insert the first one when i long press\" option that you want.\nI will leave the rest of the answer just because it was too much writing and it may be useful for someone :-D\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nThe only solution for this is to alter the order of the chars in the corresponding language. If you're \"familiar\" with the Terminal, you can find how to do that in this answer.\nQuoting:\n\nThe characters included in the popovers are defined in property lists inside the /System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/ bundle.\nI was able to change à to y by editing /System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/Resources/Keyboard-en.plist and logging out and back in.\n\nSo, you should open Terminal.app, and type:\ncd /System/Library/Input\\ Methods/PressAndHold.app/Contents/Resources/\n\nThen, perform an ls to see the contents:\nls -l\n\nAnd find one that looks like the keyboard layout you're using (I'm assuming french) so it should be Keyboard-fr.plist\nBackup the file now to your Desktop just in case:\ncp Keyboard-fr.plist ~/Desktop\n\nFinally, edit the current file by doing:\nsudo vi Keyboard-fr.plist\n\nthis is going to prompt you for your password, the reason is that the file is protected so you need to be an admin. Type your password and press enter. The vi editor should open with the contents of the file.\nIf you scroll down (use the arrow keys), you will find this:\n<key>Roman-Accent-c</key>\n <dict>\n  <key>Direction</key>\n  <string>right</string>\n  <key>Keycaps</key>\n  <string>ç c ć č</string>\n  <key>Strings</key>\n  <string>ç c ć č</string>\n </dict>\n\nThere are two key pieces here:\n\n*\n\n*you can see that this corresponds to the lower case 'c' because it says: \"Roman-Accent-c\". If you wanted to modify 'a' you should find \"Roman-Accent-a\". You can even create new ones, like Roman-Accent-Q will be for upper case 'Q'. (so the popup will appear if you press-and-hold shift-Q. Neat huh?\n\n\n*You can see the sequence of chars: ç c ć č\nThere is a space between each char (you can add more, I don't know if there's a limit, I have one with 14).\nPlease note that you have to change it in both lines\nI assume you're familiar with the 'vi' editor, but if you don't know how to do it, here's a 5 seconds crash course for this task.\nOnce you are positioned (using arrows) where you want to edit (i.e.: the cursor is over the ç in the  line), press \"i\" to enter insert mode. now retype your chars in the order you want them and delete the ones you don't want (move with the arrows if unsure, delete with \"delete\" key). It's a bit tricky.\nRepeat the above for the other  line below, they must look alike.\nOnce you're done and happy, press ⎋ (That's the esc key) to exit insert mode, then type:\n:wq\n\nYes, that's a semicolon, then a \"w\" and a \"q\" (for write, quit), then press enter.\nYou should be back at the terminal.\nIf you get a -- INSERT -- W10: Warning: Changing a readonly file or similar when you press \"i\" to INSERT, you forgot to do the sudo command and you have no permission to write to the file, so don't waste time and try to fix that first :)\nIf for some reason you mess up, don't panic. You can always exit insert mode at any time (by pressing esc) and then 'u' to UNDO or :q! (semicolon, q + !) to quit without saving.\nAnyway, once you have saved your results, logout or restart your computer and you should be set to go.\nGood luck :)\n\nA: To improve your accented character typing speed in the French language, you can disable Press and Hold with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Terminal command $ defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false.\n\n*Logout and log back in.\n\n*Your \"System Preferences > Language & Text > Input Sources > Select input sources to use.\" should be set to \"U.S. International - PC\"\n\n\nThen you can use PC-style accented character typing:\nPress ' and then c to get ç\n", "Q: How can I hide or ignore old Outlook iCal invitations? I often ignore invitations to office events on my phone, and then answer them later from iCal on my Macbook. Sometimes there are old invitations for events that have already occurred. However, the only options in iCal are Maybe, Decline or Accept. \nIf I choose any of these an email is sent to the requester which is confusing for them. How do I remove these from my queue without triggering an email? In other words, where is the Remove or Hide button?\nUpdate 2013-01-08: The problem is that the invitations no longer appear on my phone (the \"Invitations\" list is empty) however they still appear in my Mac's iCal tray.\n\n\nA: For an Exchange account the only way I found to clear old invites out was to log into Outlook Web Access in my web browser and decline them without sending an email in there. Just go to the same dates specified in iCal for the invites and use the right click menu in the calendar tab to decline them.\n\nA: actually for me it worked to delete the caches: http://kb.mit.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=12386508\n\nA: It appears that several similar forum threads have your question and have had no success in finding an option in iCal to Ignore or Remove an invitation without clicking one of the options you have listed, which sends an email. Here is a workaround that is worth a try if you don't want iCal to trigger an email:\nUse iCal Reply Checker. I've tried it myself and it works great to prevent or change the emails iCal sends when responding to an invitation.  It is shareware, however, so remove all of the old events you need within the ten days that the application is free.\n\nA: On the webpage for Ical Reply Checker it says:\nNote: iCal Reply Checker is not compatible with notifications sent by iCal using Exchange or CalDAV servers including the iCloud calendar.\nUnfortunately I have this issue with an Exchange account (as probably most ppl will)...\n\nA: Disable the internet connection on your mac. Then click any of the invitation replies. Go to the Mail application and delete the message from the outbox. Restore internet connection.\n\nA: All I did to get rid of the previous invitations on my iPad was to remove the exchange account from the iPad all together and then re-add the account again. This may not work for a few though because for some reason you may want to view to previous events on your iPad and it looks like it eats rid of all the previous events. However it worked for me how I wanted it to and there are no more invitations that I can't get rid of.\n\nA: It's easy actually. Go to the day of the notification. Highlight it on your calendar. Then select \"Delete without Notifying\"  \n\nA: Success!   In the iCalendar menu, click View==>Show Declined Events.  Once they appear, right-click on one and choose whether to Delete that instance or Delete All occurrences.\n", "Q: editing a sqllite database from the command line within an iPad I'm running a technical demo - it requires altering a SQLite database on an jailbroken iPad.  At the moment I'm pulling the database off via SCP and altering it with a GUI I have lying around, (very new to SQLite).  This takes time so ideally I'd like to be able to alter the SQLite database from the command line within the iPad - any recommendations for how that might work out? \n\nA: I would like to bring up that you do not need to jailbreak your iPad in order to pull this off.  You may still want it jailbroken for other reasons, but that is up to you. \nFirst download iSSH from the Apple store.  It is $10, but it is worth every penny.  That will allow you to securely log into the server that already stores the SQLite database.  You said that you are currently using SCP to access the database, so SSH is already set up for you on the server side.  Just log into the server with the same credentials you use to SCP to/from it. \nIf you are SSHing in, you aren't going to have access to a GUI program to alter the SQLite database.  You will have to do it using the SQLite command line tool \"sqlite3\".  This really is easier than you think it is, and I personally feel that using the command line interface for SQL databases really help you understand them much better.  \n\nA: Firstly, jailbreak your iPad and install sqlite and openssh in cydia.\nThen connect to that iPad via ssh remotely or use some ssh app like iSSH. You can also use the Mobile Terminal app from Cydia, but I don't think it works very well.\n", "Q: how to fix the parallels so it won't make the cpu work in 100% and above(140%) I have seen that is a common problem:\nhttp://forum.parallels.com/showthread.php?t=112661\nbut there is no solution or any relevant update. the parallel runs my win7 and when it startup it consume all the cpu power immediately and doesn't stop to do that for hours. does anyone know what is the problem?\nI have the most up to date max os X and parallel.\n\nA: You could try using renice with the application/process, which allows you to adjust it's CPU priorty. There are several applications that can assist in doing this, or you can do it from the command line in Terminal. \nIn Terminal the syntax is:\n# renice ## -p PID \n\nwhere ## is priority (value from -20 to 20, -20 being HIGHEST). PID is the process ID of the application. (For more information # man renice)\nSo if I open Activity monitor and notice Parallels is process ID 1222 and want to lower it's burden on the CPU I would use something such as:\n# renice +5 -p 1222\n\nSeveral Applications (that I know of) also have the ability to do this too:\n\n\n*\n\n*ATMonitor\n\n*QuickSilver\n\n*Appriority\n", "Q: Extending network with 2 airport express from another router I have two airport express devices.

I frequently have to print a 3-page document.  Wanting to save paper, I print it 2-to-a-page, double-sided.  So I end up with the front having \"1 | 2\", and the back having \"3 |  \".\nIt'd be more convenient if the front had \" | 1\", and the back had \"2 | 3\".  Is there a way to have Mac OS X printing insert a blank page at the start when printing?\n\nA: Hmmm probably not the way you want it. You don't mention what are you trying to print (Word? Pages? TextEdit?), If you use Pages, for example,  you could create a template that inserts a page break in the 1st page (at the beginning), so your real 1st page would be the 2nd page. Then use that template as your \"blank document\". \nI know, simple solution but works ;)\nUPDATE Since you need to usually add a blank page to a PDF, you can use preview for that. Position yourself in the first page and do an: \nEdit -> Insert Blank Page\n\n", "Q: How to fix inverted color on one thunderbolt monitor with maximum resolution set? I have two monitors. All of the sudden my second monitor has switched blue for red when it is at the full resolution 2560x1600. However, white is not black, so it isn't totally inverted.\nIf I use the same monitor on a different thunderbolt port at the full resolution this problem doesn't happen. \nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: The following seems to have fixed it:\nsudo mv /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist ~/Desktop/\nsudo mv /Users/kbrandt/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.windowserver.CDE1EF8A-5D17-5A4E-AFB8-C4D1E19616DD.plist ~/\n\nFollowed by a reboot. I expect there may be a more targeted way to fix this, but this worked for now.\nIf you can forgive a little rant, I also have to killall Dock to get the wallpaper on the second monitor, and use SwitchResX to get the monitor to display the proper resolution. In short, it seems OS X sucks with multiple monitors (at least with non-apple displays).\n", "Q: How can I solve an iPhone 4S restore failure loop? My iPhone crashed while it was connected to the computer. I performed synchronization and left the phone so it can recharge. When I looked it after some time I saw Apple logo. I have tried multiple times to reset it (power + home) but every time it just stuck on Apple logo.\nAfter some time I gave up and decided to restore it but even that didn't work.

None of the answers worked for me. \nI then checked my time machine setup. It was deactivated but I still had two old unused shares in it. I removed them and I guess this solved the problem.\n(Originally, I checked the plugin time machine scheduler, because I thought of it as the problem. This led me to time machine itself.)\n\nA: It depends on how this was set up to launch.  From boot, Go > Connect to Server > (click the dropbox) and select clear recent servers, if not using any.  Then go to System Preferences > Accounts and see if there is something set up in the Login Items tab related to the server and clear.  Restart and test.

The dock is still there, and I can click on icons to restore minimized windows, but clicking on something that isn't running, won't run that program.  System-level shortcuts like Command ⌘-Tab and Control ⌃-F2 don't do anything, but I can still hit the Exposé key F3.\nIf I reboot, everything is fine, but of course it can happen again when something goes wrong.  If this were a Linux box, I'd restart the X server.  If it were a Windows machine, it would be like explorer.exe crashed, and I'd have to kill and restart that.  Is there any analogous fix that doesn't involve waiting for the whole machine to reboot?\n\nA: You might try force quitting Dock with killall Dock. It should be reopened automatically by launchd. The Dock process seems to be responsible for many general UI features like Mission Control and the application switcher.\nYou can usually just log out and back in instead of restarting the OS. sudo killall loginwindow would be even faster than that, but it only seems to quit some processes.\n", "Q: How to format a MacBook Air 2012?

How can it easily be achieved? The help file offers no hints as to how I can accomplish this.\n\nA: Use the command brew upgrade in the terminal to update all of the packages.

I have created 3 partitions on a hard drive.\nI've tried renaming the partition with a dot in front, however it seems that the OS doesn't allow that.\nHow to make one of the 3 partitions hidden to the user?\n\nA: My previous answer is preserved below.\nYou can use the chflags command to apply the hidden attribute:\nchflags hidden /Volumes/Hide_this_disk\n\nAnd to unhide:\nchflags nohidden /Volumes/Hide_this_disk\n\nThese commands should take effect immediately.\n\nYou need to have the Apple Developer Command Line Tools installed. You can either get them from inside of Xcode (in Preferences under Downloads) or you can download them from Apple's Developer website (free registration required).\nAfter it's installed you'll have the SetFile command:\nSetFile -a V /Volumes/Hide_this_disk\n\nThis needs to be executed as root, and it won't vanish right away. But after remounting it, it won't be displayed in the Finder any more. You'll need to use Disk Utility (or diskutil) to mount and unmount the disk afterward since it won't be visible to unmount and it will still be available under /Volumes normally.\nIf it's an internal disk then I believe that it will auto-mount at boot, but I don't know for certain.\nTo make it visible again just run the same thing, but with a small v:\nSetFile -a v /Volumes/Hide_this_disk\n\nAgain, you'll need to remount it.\n", "Q: Why does Chrome prevent my Mac from sleeping?

I do a clean install whenever I upgrade my OS to a new major release.\nI know Coda 1 is no longer in the App Store and isn't supported by Panic anymore but I'd like to keep using it because it works for my needs. I am curious whether Coda 1 can be re-downloaded on the Mac App Store under \"Purchases\" after I install a clean OS (particuarly Mountain Lion later this month)?\nIf not, can I copy the App to a USB drive and put it manually in to a cleanly installed OS and will it work?\n\nA: Yes. Most cases the developer will leave the app on the store, but just remove it from being sellable to new owners.\nThat allows them to submit bug fixes for existing customers, not force them to upgrade, allow them to re-download things - but not have new buyers buying the wrong version (not the latest).\nOf course, the developer or Apple can also remove the app entirely - but this is far less common. What is common is when the developer keeps the same name as far as the store is concerned. In this case, you'll want to have a backup that you control to re-install no matter what Apple or the developer chooses.\n\nA: You can back up the .app bundle and restore it at a later time. It'll work so long as you use the same apple id as before (due to code signing)\n\nA: This is possible in most cases.  Whilst ordinarily you may only download an App if it is available, and even then you may only download the most recent version of that app, in a number of circumstances it is possible to download an app that is no longer available.\nThe first obstacle is that if it is no longer available, then you cannot find it in order to download it.  They key is to find it on your purchase history section on the iTunes stores within iTunes.  If it's listed there, you should be able to download it regardless of it's availability to new users.\nThe most common reason for an app to become unavailable is for the developer to not renew his yearly $99 developer program fee.  This not only stops the developer from having access to the various tools etc, it also means that any apps they have in the store are removed.  Obviously in these cases it makes no sense to cause unnecessary hassle for legitimate purchasers who downloaded the App when it was legitimately available, and so these people always have this back door to re-download.\nI believe the same applies for Apps that are pulled for breaking rules, if you downloaded it and Apple remove it, they only remove it for new downloaders.\nOf course, it is possible just less common that the app has been removed due to malicious behaviour that was not caught in the review process.  In this case, then it's prudent to have access to it genuinely removed for good.\n", "Q: iPad: H.264 vs MPEG 4? On the Apple website it is said that  \n\nCamera Connection Kit support standard photo formats, including JPEG\n  and RAW, along with SD and HD video formats, including H.264 and\n  MPEG-4.  \n\naren't H.264 and MPEG4 the same thing? I thought that there are two names only because different standard consortiums have different terminology.\n\nA: With MPEG-4 you generally mean H.263, the predecessor of H.264. It has lower compression and therefore lower image quality at same bit rate.\n\nA: H.264 = MPEG-4 AVC = MPEG-4 Part 10\n", "Q: Can i use \"Remote Disc\" from a Linux host remotely to OS X? I just got my first MacBook Pro (retina), so I'm new to OS X. It does not have an optical drive, but I notice there's a \"Remote Disc\" device in Finder.\nI was wondering if I can mount my physical disc from another Linux machine on the network and have it appear as a \"Remote Disc\" on MacBook Pro. Is this possible?\nI have been using sshfs to connect Linux directories to OS X, but I wanted to access Audio discs as well, and those cannot be mounted through sshfs.\n\nA: Most likely no because it's proprietary technology.\nApple's remote disc functionality is provided by the host OS which has to be OS X or Windows having the proper drivers installed. You also have to have a fairly current Mac which has no built-in optical drive.\nHave a look at Apple's knowledge base for a more detailed explanation: DVD or CD sharing: Using Remote Disc\n\nA: Rip the audio discs on Linux using ffmpeg/mencoder/etc and then share those files to your Mac using Samba.  A little less direct than you were hoping for, but perfectly viable.\nIf you want to share data discs, you can do the same by mounting the discs in the Linux filesystem and then sharing those mount points (again, using Samba).  That's how I do it.\n", "Q: Disk unmount failing ; Unable to install Lion OSX. Ends with a kernel panic I have been trying to install Lion OSX but it fails with a kernel panic.

I have a long list of apps I've downloaded for my iPhone on a single PC. I would like to export a list of these apps to a text format.\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: You could do this with a few Terminal commands.\nFirst, open the Terminal by going to Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal.  Then, paste in the following and press return.\ncd ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes\\ Media/Mobile\\ Applications\n\nThen, paste in this next command and press return.\nls > ~/my_apps.txt\n\nNow, in your Home folder (/Users/yourusername/), there will be a text file called my_apps.txt containing a list of all of your apps.\n\nA: The second answer concerns Mac OS X (as I haven't specified the system when asking the question). Here is the answer for Windows (tested on Windows XP SP2):\nOpen cmd.exe by clicking Start menu --> Run, then type cmd and click <Enter>. Type:\ncd C:\\Documents and Settings\\<your_user_name>\\My documents\\My musc\\iTunes\\iTunes Media\\Mobile Applications\\\n\nThen you execute the following command (to get the list of files in this directory without extensions):\nFor %a in (*.*) do @echo %~na >> AppsList.txt\n\nYou'll have the full list of apps (ordered alphabetically ascending by default) in the 'AppsList.txt' file.\n", "Q: Deleting all songs in a given iTunes playlist using Applescript I'm working on a script to manage my \"queue\" playlist in iTunes and wanted an easy and fast way to quickly delete all songs in that playlist.\nApplescript seemed the best option and I created a little script executable with a keyboard shortcut. However it doesn't seem to work.\nThis is the relevant part:\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    repeat with t in tracks of playlist \"queue\"\n        tell playlist \"queue\" to delete t\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nThe problem is that not all the tracks are deleted, only a part of them. Executing the script multiple times, eventually, deletes all the tracks in the playlist.\n\nA: I've had the exact same problem. There's more and more AppleScript bugs in each version of OS X.\nIf you just want to delete all tracks on a playlist, single expressions like this don't seem to skip any tracks and they're also faster:\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    delete tracks of playlist \"untitled playlist\"\nend tell\n\nIf you only need to delete some tracks, something like this might work:\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    repeat\n        set tr to tracks of playlist \"untitled playlist\"\n        if tr is {} then exit repeat\n        repeat with t in tr\n            delete t\n        end repeat\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n\nA: \nThe problem is that not all the tracks are deleted, only a part of them. \n\nSince you are deleting the tracks as you are iterating across them, it might be getting confused.  It ends up with approximately half the number of tracks so it looks like it is removing every other one.\n\ntell playlist \"queue\" to delete t\n\nFor the record, the tell playlist \"queue\" to is being ignored so this is equivalent to just saying delete t.\n@user495470 answer is good but this also works for me:\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    delete of (every track of playlist \"tmpList\")\nend tell\n\n\nA: Note that these examples only delete the song from the playlist, and not from disk.\nThis has worked for me to do both:\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n  set tr to tracks of playlist \"a\"\n  repeat with t in tr\n    set a to location of t\n    set f to POSIX path of a\n    delete t\n    do shell script \"rm \" & quoted form of f\n  end repeat\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Repair disk from single user mode (fsck fails) Earlier today my 2009 iMac emitted I/O errors trying to copy files. So I ran disk utility, verify disk to see if anything was amiss. It was. But as it's my startup disk I couldn't repair it, so I tried safe mode. Safe mode worked the very first time, but when I rebooted it shows the progress bar filling up, before halting. Every time I turn it on now, the same progress bar then crash happens. Booting in verbose mode reveals fsck is failing with signal 8.\nUsing single-user mode, as that's as far as I'm aware the only way I can get any access to the system, I've been running fsck_hfs.

Press the on/off button once.\nDoing the above booted my Macbook (running Snow Leopard) to the desktop, bypassing the failing fsck check and allowing me to run an up-to-date time machine backup. YMMV but I hope this helps someone.\n\nA: About three years ago, I ran into the exact same problem you're having. The issue is with the hard drive itself--nothing software related. Take it to the nearest/best Apple repair store and have them replace your hard drive. You can then restore all of your information from your backup. You do back up your computer, don't you?\n(Note: if you forgot to back up your computer recently or otherwise cannot access your old files, the repair shop will most likely be able to recover most, if not all, of your data. If the HDD is really badly damaged, however, you're best bet is to send it to DriveSavers for a cleanroom disassembly and data recovery. If you choose that option, however, be prepared to spend several hundred dollars.)\n\nA: As far as I can tell:\nfsck_hfs -Rc -d /dev/disk0s2\n\n…is not a valid command - the R should be r.  So:\nfsck_hfs -rc -d /dev/disk0s2\n\ninstead.\n\nA: You can try to force fsck_hfs to rebuild the catalog by running\nfsck_hfs -Rc -d /dev/disk0s2\n\nor (if you want to avoid having to answer the prompts)\nfsck_hfs -y -Rc -d /dev/disk0s2\n\nOf course this will only fix logical damages and keep failing if the disk itself is damaged.\n\nA: Just to clear this mess up:\n-Rc -fd \n\nPrompts an error \"illegal option --R\", where usage should be:\nb = physical blocks size \nB path =file containing physical blocks numbers to map to paths\nc size = cache size\nE = exit on major error\nd = output debugging info\nf = force fsck\nl = lkive fsck\nm arg = octakl mode used\nn = assume a no responsev\np = just fixes normal inconsistencies\nq = quick check\nr = rebuild catalog btree\nu = usage\ny = assume a yes response\nUsing :\n/sbin/fsck -fy /dev/disk1s2\n\njust didi it for me now!\nHope this helps others too!\nLAO\n", "Q: Which options exist for a Macbook air (2010) SSD upgrade?

If I force quit the bash process, it restarts and does nothing and the system gets back to normal.\nWhat can I do? \nI already checked the permissions. \n\nA: Select that bash process in Activity Monitor and click Inspect, then switch to Open Files and Ports tab. This should give you some clue on how that process was started and what it is doing. Otherwise update your question with that info, someone surely will help you here\n", "Q: Cannot copy certain podcast episodes to iPhone My iPhone (3GS, 5.1.1) has decided that certain new podcast episodes simply cannot be copied to the phone. When I move them from the iTunes Podcasts category in the library to the phone, nothing happens. This applies only to the newest one or two episodes of each affected podcast. Other episodes copy nicely.\nI tried deleting all podcast episodes on the phone, rebooting the phone and restarting iTunes.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Some podcasts are video and if the resolution is too high for your device, it will not work.\n\nA: Try using Handbrake and use the presets to convert it to the correct format. \n\nNote: iTunes will probably place the movie in the Movies section of your iTunes library. To fix this and make iTunes show the episode in the Podcasts section, you can Show Info (Command + I) and change the Media Type under Options to \"Movie\"\n\n", "Q: Disabling lots and lots of NFS mounts based on location I have a number of NFS automounts in my Local directory node on 10.7. I am using a laptop and when I work at home I don't have access to the servers. As a result I often get beachballing Navigation Services dialogs for example, and logs are flooded with NFS error messages on this and that server not being reachable.\nIs there some simple app (preferably a GUI one but scripting will do as well) which will disable the mounts when I am on WiFi or just not at work?\n\nA: Try ControlPlane. It can perform all sorts of different actions, including mounting/unmounting network drives based on various triggers, including which WiFi network you're connected to.\n\nA: It turns out this is not easily done. To disable automounts you need to actually remove them from the directory services. What I think I will try is just mounting the requisite volumes manually with the mount command when I am at work and unmounting them once I am home. This way no apps will get hung up on files that cannot be opened.\nHowever it's a pity that automountd is so badly designed that it does not allow disabling or enabling mounts and does not have a hard limit on retires on a mount when the network configuration is stable.\n", "Q: Remove Little Snitch via script I want to be able to uninstall Little Snitch over Apple Remote Desktop. I came across the script below here: http://fromtheadmin.com/kill-and-remove-little-snitch-application-via-ard-script/\nHowever when I run the script locally on a test machine with Little Snitch running, Terminal returns \"No matching processes belonging to you were found\".

There's a risk with LS that you could\nshoot your own session (and script) if taking out the LS processes\nglitches the network. If you believe you need to kill processes that\nact as gatekeepers for network traffic, you should make sure your\nscript is not subject to normal hangup handling (see the man pages\nfor nohup and batch for ways to do that)\n\n*Underkill: if you're committed to killing the active components of\nLS before reboot to be sure (i.e. as if it were self-protective) you\nneed to also take out the Little Snitch Daemon process and unload\nthe kernel extension.

If\nyou want to be less polite, use \"now\" and/or no message.\n\n\nA: ALERT: This answer has been tried and apparently does not work.  However, I am leaving the answer here in order to help others diagnose the issue.\nWhen you run the script, $NetworkMonitor becomes Little Snitch Network Monitor instead of the required \"Little Snitch Network Monitor\" (to deal with the spaces).\nI would change the first three lines of your code to:\n#!/bin/sh \nNetworkMonitor=\"\\\"Little Snitch Network Monitor\\\"\"\nUIAgent=\"\\\"Little Snitch UIAgent\\\"\"\n\nI think that might take care of your issue.

How can I disable the \"dog ears\" my PDF previews have in Finder?\nThis is most easily seen in windows with icon view. (Command ⌘-1 is the shortcut). Is it possible to customize this icon so it is similar, but with the corner  not folded over like a page that has been dog-eared?\n\nA: You cannot remove the dog-ears, as that is how the Finder renders the images. Most OS X apps' document icons have that dog-ear on the icon image so it looks more like a physical page and less like an unadorned white square. \n", "Q: How can I access emails in Apple Mail programmatically? I have an iMac running OS X 10.6.8 and use Apple Mail version 4.5.\nI need to access specific parts of specific emails programmatically using Mathematica (others of course could do this more generally with any other programming language, I need to use Mathematica).\nI need to find the specific eMails, which I can arrange to identify by either the: \n\n\n*\n\n*\"From\" and/or \n\n*\"Subject\" \n\n\nfields.\nI then need to read either a string of numbers and characters from either the:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Subject\" or \n\n*\"Body\" \n\n\nfields of the eMails.\nSo, \n\n\n*\n\n*Can one do this?\n\n*If yes, how are emails in Apple Mail kept (flat file, database file, csv, unique format, other)?\n\n*What is the name of the above file?\n\n*In what directory can I find it?\n\n*How do I access the file and the relevant information in the file?\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: One can do this.  The following shows what I've found...\nIndividual Apple Mail emails reside in a directory, typically something like the following:\n/Users/UserName/Library/Mail/POP-myEmail@isp.com@pop.secureserver.net/INBOX.mbox/Messages\n\nas \".emix\" files readable by any text editor.\n\".emix\" files have a sequential numbering by mails received by one's Apple Mail itself rather than the particular mailbox, something like:\n18373.emix\n18376.emix\n18378.emix\n\nThe \".emix\" files have clearly marked identifiers of their content.  An abridged \".emix\" file follows::\nReceived: (somemailprovider ...); 16 Jul 2012 00:04:00 -0000\nReceived: from unknown ...; 16 Jul 2012 00:04:00 -0000\nX-IronPort-Anti-Spam-Result: AuEPABVXA1DR...\nReceived: from ....isp.com ...; 15 Jul 2012 17:03:59 -0700\nReceived: by qcsg1 ...; Sun, 15 Jul 2012 17:03:59 -0700 (PDT)\n\nDKIM-Signature: ...\nReceived: ...; Sun, 15 Jul 2012 17:03:59 -0700 (PDT)\n\nReturn-Path: <myEmail@isp.com>\nReceived: from iMac-6.local ....\n\nDate: Sun, 15 Jul 2012 20:03:54 -0400 (EDT)\nFrom: myFromEmail@isp.com\nTo: myToEmail@isp.com\nMessage-ID: <50035a6e.02d0e00a.1fef.....com>\nSubject: TEST\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: multipart/mixed;boundary=\"----=_Part_0_1792110529.1342397034510\"\nX-Nonspam: None\n\n------=_Part_0_...\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit \n\n------=_Part_0_...\nContent-Type: image/gif; name=0001.gif\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: base64\nContent-Disposition: inline; filename=0001.gif\n\nSo, given all of this one needs to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Identify which email one wants to read (I can use date and a specific email directory) ;\n\n*Import the text of the email into Mathematica;\n\n*Parse the required information using the appropriate identifiers in the \".emix\" file.\n\n\nA little cumbersome, but workable.\n\nA: There are different paths you could take and to me it seems a bit odd to try to get the information out of the mailapplications data which has probably been saved in an encoded way. If you want to try this, you may find the data in the hidden /Username/Library. You should be able to access it via the Terminal.\nSince you're flexible in the kind of language to use, I would highly recommend using Python and then just access the mailserver via imap (or pop3) and search for the information you want that way.\nhttp://docs.python.org/library/imaplib.html#module-imaplib\n", "Q: How do I hide rulers on startup for Pages? I can press Command-R to easily hide the ruler, but is there a way to make this behavior consistent every time I start up Pages?\n\n\nA: Get a document set up exactly the way you like it, with whatever showing or not-showing that you want. Save it as a template (File: Save as Template).\nIf you have the template picker load on startup, then just pick that template.\nIf you don't, then go into Preferences, and choose that template as the template to load by default (For new documents: Use template…). \nThese templates can also include custom styles, canned text, etc.\n", "Q: I can't remove items from the sidebar in Finder I'm having trouble removing items from the sidebar in the finder window. I can right click on Applications, and ill have options for it saying \"remove from sidebar\". However, I have a lot of things on my sidebar that don't even let right click on them and remove them. How do I go about removing things from the sidebar? \n\nA: On Lion, items that cannot be removed from the sidebar are usually listed under \"Devices\" or \"Shared\" (there are Snow Leopard counterparts to these as well). If you'd rather not see these items in the sidebar, you can remove them by following these steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*With Finder focused, visit Finder->Preferences or ⌘, and select the Sidebar tab.\n\n*Uncheck items that you don't want shown in the sidebar\n\n", "Q: I've lost everything on my iphone4, how do I put my library back? Syncing doesn't work First my phone said \"No wi-fi\" so I reset everything on the phone, the phone now has nothing on it & asked me to set it up again. I opted for 'restore from back-up' instead of 'new phone', now it is instructing me to connect into itunes but it syncs all the songs & stops & the phone still instructs me to connect to itunes - I'm going around in circles. I don't know how to get my phone back to how it was. can anyone help please. I don't have Ninety something dollars to call apple for help.\n\nA: Are you connecting your phone to the mac / pc you're usually syncing it too? Because it would need the backup file which is created everytime you sync it.\nIf so, you should try this instructional guide. It has screenshots and should be easy to follow.

Does anyone know why Skype requires Flash? Is this new? Are there any \"recent\" versions of Skype that do not?\nI'm guessing it requires it solely for it's \"Skype Home\" section, which is pretty annoying since I don't need that section in Skype and it makes me have to run flash (which in turn makes me sick and my battery unhappy).\nthanks!\n\nA: I am running Skype 5.7 on a Mac without Flash installed. It does not complain about its absence. The 'Home' screen initially showed a blank box which was clearly a Flash video with a demo for something. That has now disappeared. It looks like Skype will use Flash if its installed but it is not required.\n", "Q: Mac App Store update issues after migrating to Retina MBP I had a 2011 MBP and I just purchased the new RMBP. I used the startup migration assistant to port all my data, easy.\nBut I'm getting weird issues, when I opened programs for the first time I was prompted to put in my password.\nNow, I am unable to update my apps (so far IMovie and IPhoto) through the mac app store, I get this error:\nI only have one account and I am logged in to that account.\nI've followed the instructions regarding repairing disk permissions and re-indexing spotlight found here \n\nA: I had this same issue when moving to my new iMac.  Unfortunately, I contacted Apple Support and even they could not solve the issue.\nEventually, they just gave me promo codes to purchase and re-download (for free) the iLife suite.\nI would use this Mac App Store support form to contact them.\n", "Q: Key Combination for Restart During Boot My Mac gets stuck during bootup quite frequently recently (no entry sign and flashing folder). Every time it happens, I have to press the power button to shut it down and press the power button again to turn it on.\nIs there a software reboot key combination like Window's Control + Alt + Delete? \n\nA: Although Apple publishes a list of OS X keyboard shortcuts for startup, there is not one for forcing a reboot.\nHowever, your problem seems to be indicating a failing hard drive, so make sure that you create a full backup of your data (if you don't have one already) as soon as possible.\nI would replace your drive manually (if your Mac has a user-serviceable hard drive) or take your Mac into an Apple Store for service.  In the long term, this should solve your issue.\n", "Q: Can't disable \"Press the Option key five times to turn Mouse Keys on and off\" Apple lets users who occasionally want the use of Mouse Keys to enable/disable it by pressing Option (⌥) five times. I use Maya, so I'm constantly using the Option key to manipulate the camera, and this usage often triggers Mouse Keys. Unfortunately, this disables the rest of my keyboard (see this Apple KB page) and I can't use other helpful shortcuts. I can of course disable it again, but it's annoying when I have to do it again and again.\nI went to the appropriate place in System Preferences to disable this (Universal Access > Mouse & Trackpad), but it's greyed out. I've done extensive searching and haven't found anyone with a similar problem.\nWhy is this happening, and how can I stop it?\n\nA: Change the value of useMouseKeysShortcutKeys to NO in 'com.apple.universalaccess.plist'. I believe you will find the files in ~/Library/Preferences/. When you're done, don't forget to reboot ;)\nAlso, you can do this via Terminal by typing defaults write com.apple.universalaccess useMouseKeysShortcutKeys NO and pressing enter. You may need admin rights to do this.\n\nA: There's indeed an option to disable that permanently\nStep 0\nSearch for  \"Mouse Keys\" in spotlight\nStep 1\n\nStep 2\n\n\nA: To avoid editing plist or avoid command line, you can still do it in the prefs menu. \nGo to System Preferences > Accessibility Preferences > Mouse and Trackpad > Options > Press Option Key five times to toggle Mouse Keys\" (1st option). You have to uncheck \"Ignore built-in trackpad when Mouse Keys is on\", first.\n\nA: To disable mouse keys I went to system preferences\n\nA: timothy go to accessibility in system preferences and then mouse and track pad then click options and it is the first option\n", "Q: Does the MacBook Pro with Retina have two Thundebolt busses, or are the two TB ports sharing a bus? Just wondering whether the two ports on the rMBP are sharing the same bandwidth. \nIf so, does the single-port, non-retina MBP have the same bandwidth with just one port instead of two?\n\nA: Each physical Thunderbolt port can handle two (duplex) 10 Gb/s channels. Per Anandtech's very thorough review, the Retina MacBook Pro has four channels, two for each port.\nA further Anandtech article says that the 2011 MacBook Pros used the Light Ridge controller, which has four channels, however due to having only one physical port, only two of those are actually available to the user. It's not clear what chip the 2012 non-Retina MBPs use, but it's likely the same Cactus Ridge chip used in the Retina machine, but with the similar limitation - each port is limited to two channels, so that's all you'll get, regardless of what the controller behind it supports.\n", "Q: No Wi-Fi on iPhone? In my iPhone settings where I'm supposed to turn Wi-Fi on or off, it is just grey & says 'No Wi-Fi'.\nI have reset network settings, restored phone, re-synced everything, but still have this problem. Does anyone know how to fix this?\n\nA: See this Apple support page: http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1559 \nThis also is typical of hardware problems relating to wifi chip or an internal antenna connector failure, either of which indicates that a trip to a Genius Bar may be in order. Apple service also is available at https://locate.apple.com\n\nA: Same issue - a perfectly good, 7 month old i4S that is out of Apple warranty (original phone got wet, I went to Apple Store and bought a $199 replacement phone but they only provide a 90 day warranty of that vs. 1 year on a 'new' phone from a cell carrier - go figure).  \nApple hosted 2 chat support sessions and 1 store visit, at which time they said it's a hardware issue, out of warranty, buy a new phone & good luck.  So I am going to buy a new phone - but it won't be an iPhone!\nSo - in summary, your issue is likely a hardware issue and you might want to learn from someone who regrets paying for a \"repair\" rather than just buying a new device or other warranty extension.\n\nA: I have been bitten by this - the symptoms were that the 'enable wifi' slider button was completely grayed out after multiple reboots, backup/restores, and updates.\nThe 4S has a well-documented issue with overheating that apple refuses to acknowledge or fix.  To see if your phone is affected by this, power it down, wrap it in a paper towel, and (seriously) place it in your freezer for 20-30 minutes.  Power it back up, and try to turn on your wifi.  It might work anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour.\nThe bad news is that if you are indeed affected by this issue, you'll need to have apple replace the phone.\n\nA: I had the exact same problem. But I went to Apple and they replaced. So go to Apple and they'll hopefully replace it for you too (if you have AppleCare).\n\nA: I had the exact same issue with a 2 year old iPhone. I read up on it all day and tried everything. Last ditch - I tried  a weird solution I found online and it worked. Overheat the iPhone gently with a hot hair dryer until it gives the Temperature alert and goes into recovery mode.\nNow put it in a Ziplock bag and place it in the freezer for 5-10 minutes. If it comes back on you are ready to do the following.\nGo to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings and reset the phone.\nThis takes a few minutes. Once complete, force reboot the iPhone by holding down the Home and Power buttons simultaneously for about 10 seconds. Once you see the Apple logo let go of the buttons.\nIt's weird - it was my last roll of the dice - but it worked. I was able to switch on the WiFi and it connected.\nThere is a Canadian post online where many people have had the same success.\n\nA: I had the same problem. It took several tries but this is what worked (kinda) for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cool off the iPhone. 15 minutes in a fridge. Temperature seems to have a role.\n\n*Reset Network Settings (General > Reset > Reset Network Settings).\n\n*Let it reboot, and give it time if it's stutter-y after a boot.\n\n*It should allow you to have WiFi enabled. Connect to your WiFi network.\n\n\nSo this got WiFi to be enabled for me, but I'm experiencing trouble where it keeps dropping the WiFi signal and trying to reconnect. Associated with this I'm seeing the iPhone occasionally freeze when trying to deal with the WiFi settings, sometimes when that's frozen Control Panel doesn't work to turn Airplane Mode on even, stuff like that.\nUnfortunately it is impossible to downgrade to iOS 6.1.3 now. Either the iPhones will get better themselves like they were before the problems hit, or Apple will put out an update soon, or it is a possibility that our iPhones will need to be replaced.\n\nA: Wi-Fi greyed out in iOS 7 iPhone 4 or iPhone 4s is a hardware issue and you need professional help.\npodmod.de fixes the issue for €69 in 20 minutes. Check the website and get it repaired.\n\nA: This is a very complicated issue of iPhone you're facing. I hope till now you've discovered a solution for this issue, if not than I want you to say after upgrading to latest iOS 7 many iPhone users around the world faced similar problem, and than a later version Apple released including WiFi bug fix and the latest upgrade fixes such problem upon installing. Thus if you're having such problem after an upgrade consider installing latest iOS upgrade or older version to have back your WiFi.\n\nA: This is a KNOWN issue with a certain batch of 4s's that have wifi chip temp. sensor issues. Warming the wifi chip with a soldering iron for 30 secs or so and then reseting the network settings will get wifi back. Maybe for a month, maybe only a few days. Has worked for me several times. \n\nA: 15 minutes in the freezer has worked, do it at your own risk, but I had ice on the screen, but its faster than it ever was and the WIFI is back working\n\nA: This may just be a temporary glitch.\nTry restarting the iPhone:\n\nTo restart iPhone, first turn iPhone off by pressing and holding the Sleep/Wake button until a red slider appears. Slide your finger across the slider and iPhone will turn off after a few moments.\nNext, turn iPhone on by pressing and holding the Sleep/Wake button until the Apple logo appears.\n\n\nIf that does not help, try a hard reset:\n\nTo reset iPhone, press and hold the Sleep/Wake button and the Home button at the same time for at least 10 seconds, until the Apple logo appears.\n\nReference: iPhone Troubleshooting Assistant\n\nA: This unfortunately is a widespread issue which has sparked an heated debate on the Apple discussion pages, as you can see when you do a google search on \"iphone 4s wifi\"\nThis issue is probably caused due to an unreliable Broadcom wifi chip (which also handles the Bluetooth communications you might have experienced)\nThe iOS seems to overheat the Broadcom chip with as result a possible hardware failure of the chip. Since the chip is part of the mainboard this means your iPhone 4S is now officially dead and you are out of warranty. Also since Apple claims: 'the upgrade to iOS 7 is at your own risk'\nSince there are mostlikely thousands of people affected and Apple is keeping a 'deafening silence' a.k.a. not giving any response to all the cries for help\nI have tried to sum up my observations on this and have set up a page where you can read on this.\n", "Q: What screwdriver size is needed for MacBook Pro mid 2012 back cover?

I tried to rename the hard drive of my Macbook from \"Macintosh HD\" to something else without the freaking space. However, after renaming it, many of my applications showed errors immediately and I stupidly restarted my computer. \nRight now, I cannot log in to my user account because of an error. Everything is blocked.\nIf someone can tell me how to change the harddrive name back without logging into my previous account?\n\nA: *\n\n*It seems you have another system - in that you are able to post the question. If it is a mac, you can start the problem system in Target Disk Mode (if it has FireWire), connect it to the working system with a firewire cable and you should be able to change the name remotely.\n\n*If you can start in single-user mode (s) that may allow you to bypass the problem.\n\n*If you start in verbose-mode, (same link as above), you may be able to see the problem.\n\n*If you can start from the Lion recovery disk, or a DVD, that will also allow you to change the drive name.\n\n*Finally, if you do get the system restarted, I urge you to check it through Disk Utility (applications > utilities).\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: In my experience, you should only rename your hard drive when your computer is fresh out of the box (or after you've wiped the hard drive to start fresh). The problem seems to be that there is software that will hard-code the full path to certain support files, and that includes the hard drive's name.\nIf you change the name before you've done anything else, this isn't a problem.

I had several problems with my disk due to a couple of wrong choices (you can read the story here). \nI booted the machine from a Lion disk and I didn't succeed in formatting the disk in HFS due to a cryptic \"Wiping volume data to prevent future accidental probing failed\" error from the disk utility (both from GUI and terminal). \nThen I tried booting with a Snow Leopard disk and the disk utility refused to format the disk with another cryptic message \"POSIX reports: The operation couldn’t be completed. Cannot allocate memory\". From terminal wasn't better \"Error: 12: POSIX reports: cannot allocate memory\". \nMy conclusion is that Samsung SSD 830 is not supported.\nThat's the story.\nOf course, there is a question: any suggestions?\nUPDATE: I've spent other three hours trying to fix this situation with no luck. I created an USB Lion boot (with a lot of problems due to Mac OS X bugs and lacks of documentation) and when after I started the installation on the SSD disk I obtain another magnificent error message \"Can't download the additional components to install Mac OS X\". After that moment the disk became invisible for the installer and I stopped trying. \n\nA: Since I cannot directly comment on your question (too little reputation) I'll do it this way by answering it (I know that this is not a real answer, so please forgive me). I'll just cover the supplement of your question. \nI'm using a Samsung SSD 840 PRO in my MacBook Pro (Late 2011 model) without any problems. When installing the SSD I had the same problems as you described, namely \"Can't download the additional components to install Mac OS X\" during the installation process. For me it helped to download the Mountain Lion installer (or use a copy on another mac) and build the USB disk with the DMG file that is contained in the Mountain Lion installer (this should also work with the Lion installer I guess). Here it is described how it works.\nThe reason why this is working is that the USB stick  contains all of the necessary data to install (Mountain) Lion whereas the solution given by Apple misses a lot of files that have to be downloaded from the web at the time of installation and the the download failed for me somehow. I'm not sure how you build your USB stick but if you used the way suggested by Apple you should give the other way of doing it a try.\n\nA: That's the same drive as mine, although I have an early 2011 mbp, and it works brilliantly, however I don't think your laptop is SATA 3. On paper a SATA 3 drive will work on SATA 2 connections and just work slower, however there are bound to be some compatibility issues from time to time.\nIf yours came with the USB adapter, you could try recreating a bootable partition on it that way, and installing Lion on it and see if that boots, if so, install the drive internally and see if it still boots.\n\nA: I have an early 2008 MBP with specific HD requirements. I think the late 2008 MBP may have the same ICH8-M AHCI SATA controller. If that is not the case, please disregard the rest of my answer.\nThat chip is capable of 3.0 Gb speed, but was shipped with 1.5 Gb speed. The flasher they came up with to change this destroyed the ATAPI bridge for the early optic drive so it was never released for that model.\nI have read elsewhere that my Early model will only accept up to a 320 Gb 5400rpm HD or a 250 7500rpm HD because of this. You may have success installing the OS using the SSD as an external HD on a different machine but there is a good chance it will have frequent hangs once placed back in your laptop (if indeed it has the same chip).\nI would do some research to see which SSD is known to work in that model and also check if Apple released a flasher for that exact model. I know I had a hard time finding out why my 640 Gb HD upgrade would never work properly. I've also wondered if clipping the controller chip for the optic drive. Running the Apple flasher for that chip and then resoldering the optic drive would work but I'm too poor to try.\n", "Q: Is there any way to use a 2011 iMac as a monitor for a non-Thunderbolt PC? With a 2010 iMac I would be able to connect an HDMI to mini DisplayPort cable from a GPU to the iMac and have the iMac act a monitor using Target Display Mode. However, after some research I found that the 2011 iMac cannot do this and its Target Display Mode only works if you are connecting from a Thunderbolt device.\nIs there any cable or converter or even a GPU with a Thunderbolt-output that I can use to get around this?\n\nA: Sorry, no. There are some PCs and motherboards coming out now that support Thunderbolt, but because of how Thunderbolt works, it's not something that can be added on later to something that didn't initially support it.\n\nA: Although it is an entirely different direction, you could run a VNC or RDP server on the other machine, and run the client on the iMac.  It's not like plugging in a monitor per se, but it does allow you to have another computer show up on your iMac's display.\n", "Q: (Batch) moving iTunes songs to ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/Artist/SongName I have three albums by Jack Singer.

Those files are in ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/Jack Singer and his band/SongName\nI choose to ignore the distinction and rename the artist of the latter to become just Jack Singer. iTunes does not move the files. They remain where they are. Presumably this is done to avoid unnecessary Time Machine changes. But I would like to move the files to their canonical location before launching my first Time Machine backup after adding the new album.\nHow do I tell iTunes to move the files to ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/Jack Singer/SongName, mirroring the name of the artist in the tag?\n\nA: From the comments: Under Preferences -> Advanced, \"Keep iTunes media folder organized\" must be checked\n", "Q: Make the enter key send message on iPad I use a Bluetooth keyboard with my iPad. When I am sending messages through the Messages app, the enter key does not initiate a \"send\" the way I expect (it, instead, just returns down to the next line). Is there a way to make the \"enter\" key send the message instead of dropping down to the next line? Some magic key combination perhaps?\n\nA: Hit Enter while Cmd is in action.\n\nA: There is not a way to do that. The enter/return key does the same action as hitting the button in the lower-right of the keyboard. In some apps, it sends a message or performs an action; in others, it generates a newline. Messages does the latter. You have to use the Send button on the screen to send a message.\n\nA: On you iPad. Go into \"Settings\" then navigate to \"General\", go to \"Keyboard\" option. Select the \"International Keyboards\" option and change your \"Hardware Keyboard layout\" from \"U.S.\" to \"U.S.International-PC\".

I tried suggested brightness and contrast settings and RGB values and reset the monitor back to factory settings.\nHow do I get the same results or better than Windows or some other arbitrary HDMI device? I want OS X to at least best an upscaling DVD player.\n\nA: The problem was caused by OS X outputting in YPbPr not RGB. YPbPr sends approximate colours and is used primarily for TVs. Unlike Windows, OS X didn't recognise the Dell as a Monitor because of the HDMI connection. Shifting to a DVI connector fixed this and forced RGB colour data, and thus, correct colours.\nSo no, it was not a problem with callibrating the monitor or its colour profile\n\nA: I joined just for saving anyone interested from the frustration I had in the last couple of hours. This fixed it for me (the universal patch). \n\nA: On your U2410, set Display Settings -> Sharpness to 0 then everything will be fine.\nI use Macbook Air 13' 2011 mid with Moshi HDMI connector.\nWhile I use DisplayPort to connect, no configuration needed. So it may be some bug with dell monitors.\n\nA: Mac OS keeps nagging you with it's default ICC files for that monitor. I suggest you make a colour profile as you wish, and use it to replace the monitor's ICC profile in /Library/ColorSync/Profiles/Displays (and make sure you rename it to have the same name as the default file). Then, from the inspector (\"get info\") lock the file, so that Mac OS stop reverting it to the default.\n", "Q: How do I get iOS Reminders to recognize my location/geofence better? I really like the idea of location based reminders, and would love to use them more. \nWhen I first tried them, they worked great. I had it setup to remind me to do something when I got home, and the alert would fire when I pulled into my driveway. I have my home address in my address card as being my actual address, which routes correctly. \nNow though, they never go off. When I go to the reminder, and then look at current location, it always seems to have a very exact address, but not mine. For example, I may live at 123 Main Street, but it says that I am at 432 Broad Road (which may be only a house or two away around a corner). \nI have not seen a difference when being outside or inside. I used to think the location services were just not working correctly, but then when I went to the current location in Reminders, it was always a little off, and I figured thats why the event wouldn't fire. \nIs there any way I can get this to work better? If anything, I would like it to be less sensitive. As in, let me know when I am very close to the location, which would work for me. \nThis is on an AT&T iPhone 4. My wife has a 4S, and hers only slightly works better. When using other apps, location is actually more precise, and usually only a house number off (I think due to how the underlying GIS system is done).\n\nA: The Reminders.app does not allow you to customize the geofence perimeter in the application. In iOS 6, it will allow custom address input versus someone from your address book. \nA way to get around this is use one of the several other apps available. \nI ended up using Checkmark. You can enter custom locations, and for each of those locations, you can adjust the perimeter. This has worked great, I have a larger perimeter around my work, and a medium size one around my house. \nFinally, I think this comes down to the GPS sensitivity in the iPhone 4. My wife's iPhone 4S picks up our location much closer and quicker when it comes to geofencing. \n", "Q: How do I find the windowid to pass to screencapture -l? The command line utility screencapture claims to be able to capture a single window without requiring interaction, but I can't figure out what to pass it.\n-l<windowid> capture this windowsid\n\nIt's not the process id of the the application.\n\nA: I wrote a command line utility that wraps over screencapture and the Quartz windowing library.\nGrab it here: https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/screenshot\nUse it like this:\nscreenshot Chrome -t \"Stack Overflow\"\n\n\nA: As far as I can tell, there still isn't an easy way to get the window ID from the command line.

However, the window geometries are exposed. So instead of using screencapture -l you can use screencapture -R x,y,w,h to capture the specific portion of the display covered by the target window. With AppleScript, the process can be selected by Unix PID as property \"unix id\".\nAssuming the process has just one window and your PID is in $PID:\nscreencapture -R \\\n`osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to get { position, size } of first window of (first process whose unix id is '$PID')' | tr -d ' '` \\\nwindow.png\n\nIf the process has multiple windows, you need to select by the target window title:\nscreencapture -R \\\n`osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to get { position, size } of (first window whose title is \"My window titlebar text\") of (first process whose unix id is '$PID')' | tr -d ' '` \\\nwindow.png\n\nTip: You can list the selectable properties of any object with get properties: osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to get properties of first process whose unix id is '$PID\n\nA: I wrote a little command line utility to retrieve the Window ID for apps that don't support AppleScript.

There are several out there:\nDisk Inventory X (free)\n\n\nDisk Inventory X is a disk usage utility for Mac OS X 10.3 (and later). It shows the sizes of files and folders in a special graphical way called \"treemaps\".\n\nIt is my personal favorite, as it is really simple and easy to use, as well as the great price of free!\nDaisyDisk ($20, currently on sale for $9.99)\n\n\nDaisyDisk scans your disks and presents their content as interactive maps where you can easily spot unusually large files and remove them to get more free space. The map gives you an overview of your data, so you always know what your hard disks are filled with.\n\nI don't have personal experience with DaisyDisk, but it has been highly recommended by many people, including members of Ask Different.\nGrandPerspective (free)\n\n\nGrandPerspective is a small utility application for Mac OS X that graphically shows the disk usage within a file system. It can help you to manage your disk, as you can easily spot which files and folders take up the most space. It uses a so called tree map for visualisation. Each file is shown as a rectangle with an area proportional to the file's size. Files in the same folder appear together, but their placement is otherwise arbitrary.\n\nAgain, no personal experience, but highly recommended by others.\n", "Q: Why is Outlook 2011 constantly writing to my hard disk?

In the Finder window for the destination, the filesize is slightly smaller, and is dimmed.\nWhat does it mean that the filesize is dimmed?\nIn the screen shot, the file is 1Password.agilekeychain and the size 11.6MB you can see as dimmed. The size on my Mac is 12.2MB.\n\n\nA: Dimmed means it is displaying a cached value while waiting for the size to be calculated again.\nThe .agilekeychain file is in fact a folder with lots of small files in it so it will take a few seconds to finish adding each individual size. Why isn't it there already? Maybe the Finder is occupied calculating another size on a previously opened window, it is not very efficient on focusing its work on the front window. Or the server does something else at this time, for example my Time Capsule can be horrifyingly slow to display folder sizes while indexing a backup.\nAs for the size difference, it means it has taken its snapshot value at a bad time during the copy process, when the folder was not fully copied. Dimmed values can be unreliable, it's outdated data by definition.\nSo either you wait for the Finder to update its data and display a correct size (in black), either you open a Terminal window, type du -s --block-size=1000 --apparent-size  [space] then drag and drop your file, you will get its size far quicker (in kiB).

The Wireless Extension is an interface allowing you to set Wireless LAN specific parameters and get the specific stats.\nHomepage: http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html\n\n\nA: I don't mean to come off like a smartypants but why don't you just do your capturing from a linux VM or Backtrack VM?  It's much more stable.  If you're just trying to capture packets use Wireshark (runs in x11) or Apple's built in Wi-Fi diagnostics in Core Services.  If you're trying to hack your own network, and you really want airmong-ng on Lion, you need Command Line Tools for Xcode, which you get from Apple's dev page. \n\nA: You may need the Command Line Tools component for Xcode.\nTo install this go to Xcode Preferences and in the Downloads tab select Command Line Tools and hit Download to the right, it's about 600MB.\nHaving said that, I'm running Mountain Lion 10.8.2 and I also get \"Wireless tools not found\" when I try run airmon-ng.\n\nA: install the package wireless tools\nit worked for me :)\n\nA: You can use:\nsudo wash -i en1\n\nto scan wifi networks on macos\n", "Q: Cannot log into MAC OS X after rename the disk I tried to rename the hard drive of my Macbook from \"Macintosh HD\" to something else without the freaking space. However, after renaming it, many of my applications showed errors immediately and I stupidly restarted my computer. Right now, I cannot log in to my user account because of an error. Everything is blocked...\nIf someone can tell me how to change the harddrive name back without logging into my previous account, I will appreciate it a lot. It will save my life!\nThanks\n\nA: You can't log into your account because the OS can't find your user directory.\nYou have to boot the computer keeping pressed command + R to enter the restoration/repair mode. Then go to the \"Utilities\" in the upper menu and enter \"Terminal\".\nType:\n/usr/sbin/diskutil rename \"oldname\" \"newname\" where oldname is the name you assigned to the disk and newname should be \"Macintosh HD\".\nIf everything is OK you will receive a message informing that the disk was renamed and you can restart your computer and log into your account.\n\nA: You should be able to rename your hard drive; it should not cause problems with the functionality of your computer. I’ve done it dozens of times, and Apple even has a support article explaining how to do it. It’s okay to do, virtually any time, as many times as you want.\nAlthough it is possible some applications could potentially throw errors after renaming the drive, virtually none of them should. For example, the Applications folder is addressed by /Applications, regardless of the hard drive’s name, just as the home folder is accessed by ~/ instead of the user’s home folder name (and other UNIX variables like $HOME and whoami).\nMy guess is you have another issue (maybe filesystem or ACL permissions issues) and it just happened things have gone awry around the same time.\n", "Q: Cannot purchase from Mac App Store (\"Connection failure\" msg) I have a 2008 MBP with 10.7.4. I use a WIFI and ethernet connection. I cannot purchase or download anything in the Mac App store on my computer. I can, using other folk's computers. After putting in the password, I receive a red \"Connection Failure\" message. Despite this message, I can click on apps in the Store to read about them. I turned off Little Snitch to no avail. Everything else on the internet works just fine. No useful assistance from Apple. Any ideas?\n\nA: Try this: log out of your iTunes account (within the App Store choose Store > Sign Out), restart your Mac and then try to purchase/download something.\n\nA: I FOUND the answer at the link below. The only correction I would add is to do EVERY item that has a blue cross. \nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4085819?start=0&tstart=0\n", "Q: How to add a Safari toolbar button that runs an AppleScript How do I add a button to the Safari toolbar that, when clicked, executes a given AppleScript?\n\nA: Another solution, and this is really dependant on what you want to do, is to use Services to execute your Applescript.\nIt doesn't create a toolbar icon, but will allow you to create a service from your AppleScript. You can then define a shortcut key in the System Preferences Keyboard Services pane\nThis page over at automatedworkflows.com shows an example as well as a link to the rather useful ThisService program.\n\nA: I don't think it can be done unfortunately. To put a button on the toolbar, you need to write a Safari Extension, which are restricted in what they can do. They can't execute any sort of arbitrary code outside of Safari. You can read more on developer.apple.com.\n\nA: A workaround Safari Extension, could be to use a bookmark in Safari \"Favorites Bar\".\nUse the folder action handler on opening folder this_folder\n-- Simple script handler. When clicking the bookmark Finder opens a window to the enclosing folder of the script. However the handler closes the folder again. Leaving the impression that no folder was opened.\non opening folder this_folder\ntell application \"Finder\"\nactivate\ntell application \"Finder\" to close front window\ndisplay dialog \"Safari Toolbar Button\" -- Your action script goes here\nend tell\nend opening folder\nSave the handler in your Users  ~/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts/mySafariButton.scpt\nRight click \"Folder Action Script\". Choose services from the contextual menu. And choose Folder Actions Setup. Attach your handler script.\nOpen a Finder window and locate your handler script. Simply draw it to the Safari Favorites Bar. \nAlternatively create an alias of the script and move it to a new Folder. Attach a Folder action(same procedure as above) rename the alias if you like.\nNOTE! Avoid folders on your desktop. Known to cause errors when working with Folder Actions. If you move the alias or the containing folder. The bookmark is broken and you have to recreate it.\n\nA: I researched a way to \"Launch Scripts from Webpage Links\" on a page at Macosxautomation.com that sounds highly promising, even if it's a bit TOO thorough for my taste ...\nApplescripts CAN be launched from links and therefore CAN be added as buttons on Safari's favorites-bar (NOT: toolbar), roughly by:\n\n\n*\n\n*... preparing ScriptEditor by adding XML keys/values to its internal info.plist file\n\n*... writing a/some applescript/s to be applied to (a) page/s\n\n*... creating a link with (calling) arguments to identify which one script to run\n\n*... placing this link as button on your favorites toolbar\nAs I said, this sounds very promising. I'll test the scheme and report on my experience later ...\n\nA: \n\"What were the test results?\"\n\nI posted a quite complex (& probably circuitous) solution or way to execute at GitHub (\"Download window with full names\").\nPrincipally speaking my bookmark opens a folder that contains (and therefore executes) a Folder Action Script.\nThat bookmark I sometimes use to display a list of downloaded files in an AppleScript dialog window – but in an UN-abbreviated form (e.g. for an overview of several  episodes of a downloaded TV series …).\n", "Q: Bluetooth printing from iPad? The company I work for had people out in the field doing data entry on their iPads.  We would like them to be able to print from the iPad to a bluetooth printer in their car, but I'm not sure if this can be done.  We tried using the HP Officejet 100 Mobile Printer, but while we can connect using bluetooth we have been unable to print.  \nHas anyone done this?  If so, can you point me in the right direction?\n\nA: @Jason's link to SO is correct - the out-of-the-box iPad will not support Bluetooth printing. However, there are receipt printers like Blue Bamboo or the Star Mobile printer, but these solutions might not be what you're looking for.\nThere are iBluetooth apps now in the iOS App Store - it's possible that the vendor no longer supports the Cydia version.\nAnother possible solution is an app like PrintCentral, which allows for printing wirelessly over 3G and WiFi. \n\nA: We use the Brother RJ4040 mobile printer and Print n share for our sales guys out on the road. Works really well and when we first introduced it the guys took to it quickly with no problems. The rj4040 has its own Wifi network so you can print straight to it from the ipad? Hope this may help, saw your question and had to answer!!\n\nA: I'm having the same problem\nAn AirPrint printer will only work through a wireless network, this means you must have a network through a router.\nWhen you are out of the office or home you are then out of the network range  so your ipad will switch over from wifi to 3G hence no network,so no printer.\nThe fixes are \n1 get a mobile wifi router which will need another Internet plan, (more money) \n2 get a Bluetooth printer, ( can't find any )\n3 get an ipad three ( lots more money but it has personal hotspot )\nSo in other words it can be done but it will cost you.\n\nA: I just got off the phone with Apple. They informed me that the HP Officejet 100 mobile will NOT work using Bluetooth with my ipad 4. The young lady did tell me, however, that the HP Officejet 150 mobile printer will work. Unfortunately it is a bit costly at $400. Hope this helps.\n", "Q: How to trim .mov without losing quality? When a video file (.mov recorded on iPhone) of resolution 1080x1920 is trimmed in QuickTime and saved as 1080p, the saved video resolution is 607x1024. \nIs there a way to trim video and keep the original video resolution?\np.s. QuickTime Version 10.1 (501.22) on Lion\n\nA: Just trim your video on the iPhone, in your \"camera roll\". This is the only way I know won't  re-encoding the video. \n", "Q: How to fix when connecting to any server results in \"Connecting to '...'\" window that will leave up all day? Along with myself, a couple other people in my office are having the same issue as I. Below, I will go through all the steps I've taken thus far (it's been a long time) and the results if I have them/can remember them.\nIssue: When connecting to any server (smb, vnc, doesn't matter) the connection never initializes. It stays at the \"Connecting to '...'\" window. I can leave it up all day and it won't complete nor will it error out.\nCurrent workaround: Create a new profile on the computer, and either User Switch or Migrate to that user.\n\nTroubleshooting steps taken:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ping. I can ping all and any servers fine. It returns with reasonable times, and resolves the host fine. If it's a webserver, I can go to it from any browser no problem.\n\n*Log. I can't find anything relating to when I first attempt connection, or anything during the duration of the attempt. Checked all logs that seemed relevant, and got nothing.\n\n*Netstat. Routing tables match the new user account fine.\n\n*sysctl.conf. Added the following:\nnet.inet.tcp.delayed_ack=0\nnet.inet.tcp.mssdflt=1440\nnet.inet.tcp.sendspace=250000\nnet.inet.tcp.recvspace=250000\nRebooted, still nothing.\n\n*Reset PRAM. Nope.\n\n*Reset SMC. Nope.\n\n*Connect to server on new account, then try to access it on the broken one. Drops connection to the server and dissapears from finder.\n\n*Delete Finder.plist. Didn't help.\n\n*Disable local firewall. Nope.\n\n*Connect using static IP and DNS name. Nope.\n\nI've probably tried more along the way, but have forgotten.\n\nA: Try this:\nrm ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist\nIt's an invisible preference\n", "Q: Free or cheap software to boost volume of Macbook? \nPossible Duplicate:\nDo you know a simple sound booster app for Mac? \n\nWhat software can I use to artificially increase the volume of my Macbook? I know Boom and Audio Hijack Pro are solutions but they are pricey. Any other recommendations?\n\nA: I've done some research for you, and I didn't seem to find anything except paid applications, and one that is a half solution. I only found these three (paid) options:\nAudio Hijack Pro (free trial, $32 for the full version)\nAudio Hijack Pro will allow you to boost your sound pretty easily. Upon opening the application, click \"System Audio\" in the list on the side:\n\nThen at the top, click \"Hijack\":  Once Audio Hijack Pro is hijacking your audio, go to the Effects tab and where it says \"Click here to insert effect\", click and under the 4FX Effect, click Gain.\n\nYou'll then have two dials to control the gain. Use these dials to boost the volume.\n \nIn my use of Audio Hijack Pro for boosting volume, this seems like a viable solution.\n\nBoom (free trial, $6.99, on sale right now for $4.99)\nBoom lives in your menu bar and has a simple slider to boost the volume.\n \nIf you click on the  button, you will be presented with an equalizer and numerous other nifty controls:\n\n\nHear (free trial, $19.99 for a license)\nHear is a little more complex than the other applications. It is jam packed with features, as you can see from this screenshot:\n\n\nVLC (free and open source)\nI'm not including VLC as a complete solution as it may not work in your specific case. However, it is a half solution. \nYou may be wondering why I include VLC as a solution. Here's why: VLC boosts the volume of movie and audio files up to 400%. If you open an audio/video file, adjust the volume slider and it will boost the file's volume:\n\n", "Q: Use different memory capacity RAMs in mac mini I have a mac mini with 2GB RAM and want to buy another stick (since mac mini only have to memory slots) of 4GB (all other specs are the same), will it cause a problem?\nThanks,\nMatt\n\nA: You need to find out what RAM your computer is capable of handling before you just start putting RAM into it, even if the speeds are the same, it's never to much trouble to be careful and do a bit of research to make sure things go smoothly. \nThankfully there are a lot of websites that have already tested these things for you so that you don't make any mistakes.  I usually go to:\nhttp://www.crucial.com/store/drammemory.aspx\nThey have a system scanner service that will scan your system and check your settings, it will redirect you to a page where you can buy RAM, you don't have to obviously, but it will show you all the RAM configurations that your system supports.  It will let you know the max RAM capacity, if you don't see 4GB as an option, then it doesn't support it. \nIf you don't want to use the scanner you can also just input your make model year and cpu to get the same results, though the scanner is usually more accurate if you aren't sure which machine is yours. They do tests to make sure the RAM is compatible and list all the speeds and configurations for the RAM so you know which ones to get.  Make sure everything matches up before hand.\nKnowing these things will help you find out if the RAM you have or are about to purchase will work so that you don't waste your time.  I hope this information helps you out.\n\nA: The answer is no, it shouldn't. I have a Mac Mini 2009 that I replaced with 2 X 4GB of RAM, with absolutely no problem. You may get a warning that your RAM is not optimally configured, but it shouldn't actually cause any errors (unless you don't install it correctly).\n", "Q: Will SSD improve iPhoto and Aperture responsiveness? I have a late 2008 Macbook with Core 2 Duo and plenty of RAM and HD space. (8GB of RAM, max for my machine)\nEvery time I do some work in iPhoto and Aperture, my CPU usage goes up to around 60-80% eaten up by those apps. They weren't as responsive as when I was on Snow Leopard. This started happening since I upgraded to iPhoto '11.\nI'm thinking of upgrading to an SSD, would that improve my iPhoto performance? I doubt it because it seems that iPhoto is CPU, not IO, bound. Has anyone else tried this?\n\nA: The details you've provided aren't very clear.\n1. Has this problem started to happen after upgrading to Lion?\n2. What tasks in iPhoto are causing the slow down?\n3. When it is running slow, how much free RAM does the system have? \nIt's likely that it's slowing down because you're low on RAM\n", "Q: recover WPA2 passphrase from iPhone4s or its backup? I forgot the passphrase to a WiFi network but my phone still connects to it. \nMy old iPhone3 used to be connected there, then when I migrated to an iPhone4S the settings were magically transferred through iTunes. I guess the WPA2 key is therefore in the backups (which are not encrypted)\nIs there a way to recover this WPA2 key from either the phone directly or from the backups? I read that there is an app for jailbroken phones but mine is not.\nThanks!\n\nA: If you don't mind jailbreaking your phone, there's an app called “Wi-Fi Passwords” in Cydia that displays the Wi-Fi networks you've connected to and their passwords. \n", "Q: Mac Mini Video out I recently aquired a Mac Mini 1.42ghz but I get no video out. It chimes on and everything but nothing on the monitor. optical drive seems t work\n\nA: I agree with de_an777. We could use more info. However, if you think the computer is running, you might want to try to screen share from another system, or connect via Firewire Target mode, and run some disk checks. If you can screenshare, you might want to try accessing the monitor preference on the mini, and changing the setting way down (640 x 480) to see if that works. \nI dont know if this works anymore (showing my age), but if you try to reset the PRAM - this can reset the monitor settings. This will cause late life arthritis but you restart the mini - then when you hear the chime - press CMD, OPT/ALT, P and R at the same time, and hold them until the chime sounds for 3 or 4 times.... Let go, and see what happens.\n", "Q: Any way to force command line terminal to control a Mac? I'm experimenting a little with Automator at the moment and often get stuck with some pre-recorded automation running very slowly while the whole Mac (an 2010 iMac in my case) doesn't respond to any input - either by keyboard or mouse.\nFor now I connect via SSH from another machine and issue a killall Automator to get controls back.\nIs there any solution available which enables me to halt / freeze a Mac and issue commands using a terminal?\n\nA: It seems like you want the ability to enter commands using the mouse and keyboard when the mouse and keyboard are unavailable, which is sorta odd.\nAnyway, I can think of a few ways to prod your computer into doing something without the mouse and keyboard.\n\n\n*\n\n*A Griffin PowerMate. Set it to open Terminal or run a script when you press the button.\n\n*Do Something When. Set it to run a script when a specific USB flash drive (or similar) is inserted.\n\n\nA: You could also run a \"deadman's switch\" app: have a script (maybe an Applescript) running when you start the Automator testing. After five minutes (or however long the Automator setup should take), it should display a dialog asking if you have control back this dialog would have a timeout (of 30 seconds or so), after which, it would try to kill the Automator process.\nExample code:\ndelay 300\n\ndisplay dialog \"Can you use the computer yet?\" buttons {\"Yes!\", \"No \"} default button 1 giving up after 30\n\nset retval to (the result)\n\nset gaveUp to (gave up of retval)\nset theText to (button returned of retval)\n\nrepeat while gaveUp or theText is not \"Yes!\"\n    set randomNumber to (random number from 1 to 65535)\n    do shell script \"kill -9 \" & randomNumber\n\n    display dialog \"Can you use the computer yet?\" buttons {\"Yes!\", \"No \"} default button 1 giving up after 30\n\n    set retval to (the result)\n\n    set gaveUp to (gave up of retval)\n    set theText to (button returned of retval)\nend repeat\n\n(Note that this code, instead of killing Automator, kills a random process. This is probably not a good idea, but I'm not sure exactly what you need to kill, and I thought it'd be fun. I've not actually tested that particular bit of code.)\n\nA: Yes - the normal unix process control and shutdown commands allow you to reboot, shut down or otherwise suspend or kill arbitrary processes.\n", "Q: Printing source code with OS X How can I print source code in OS X (HTML/PHP) with number lines and without long line truncation? I was used to Gedit on Linux, but here it seems I can't obtain the same with applications such as TextWrangler or TextEdit.\n\nA: You can print source code with line numbers and without truncation in TextWrangler, the key is Soft wrap text.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on \"Soft Wrap Text\" under Text Options. \n\n*Open TextWrangler > Preferences\n\n*Select \"Text Printing\" then check the \"Print line numbers\" checkbox.\n\n*Print again, long lines should wrap and line numbers should be present.\nNote: you may want to set up \"Editor Defaults\" in TextWrangler's Preferences, and have it Soft wrap text for you for each file you edit, and to a specified width too. \n\nA: enscript can be installed via Homebrew and used via Terminal.

It works fine from OS X --> OS X but not if the MacBook is running Windows.\n\nA: It should work. The iMac is taking Thunderbolt input, so, assuming the MacBook is putting out a full Thunderbolt signal (which I assume the Thunderbolt chipset can't not do), it ought to work.\nIf it doesn't \"just work\", it could be a driver issue.

I have systems running Mac OS X 10.5.8 and 10.6.8 that I would like to schedule some cron jobs for with the Cronnix GUI application.\nI prefer those computers be asleep until the scheduled jobs start. I know the Energy Saver System Preferences pane lets me schedule daily wake up times for the computer, but my cron jobs run at different times in the day.\nIs there a way to set up more than one wake up time per day on these Macs? I prefer a GUI based approach but any ideas you have would be great, thanks!\n\nA: This article,  How to Power On Your Mac at a Specific Date and Time, shows how to schedule your Mac to power on using Energy Saver, pmset, and Power Manager.\nThe most capable method is with Power Manager; it can schedule the multiple power on and wake up events you need using the Graphical User Interface (GUI).\nPower Manager supports Mac OS X 10.6 and later, but the previous version is still available and supports Mac OS X 10.4 - 10.7 for PPC and Intel.\nDisclosure: I work for the company who makes Power Manager.\n\n\nA: You can use cron to change the wake up time using pmset. E.g., say you want to run script1 at 1 am and script2 at 3 am. In root's crontab:\n0 1 * * * /path/to/script1\n0 1 * * * pmset repeat shutdown MTWRFSU 01:01:00 wakeorpoweron MTWRFSU 02:59:00\n\n0 3 * * * /path/to/script2\n0 3 * * * pmset repeat shutdown MTWRFSU 03:01:00 wakeorpoweron MTWRFSU 00:59:00\n\nWhen script1 is run, cron runs pmset to shutdown in 1 min and wake up when it is time to run script2. Likewise when script2 is run, it sets back up for script1.\nChaining your cron jobs this way would be equivalent to using multiple wake up times.\n\nA: Chaining CRON jobs to power-on like user66309 suggested would be the best solution. But to ensure that the first CRON job actually runs, you need to add an @reboot CRON job to schedule the first wakeorpoweron event.\n# the first wake or power on event is scheduled just before midnight\n@reboot pmset repeat wakeorpoweron MTWRFSU 23:59:00\n# schedule script1 for 1 minute past midnight\n# keep computer awake as long as script1 is running\n1 0 * * * caffeinate -i path/to/script1\n# wake or power on computer a few minutes before script2 is scheduled\n1 0 * * * pmset repeat wakeorpoweron MTWRFSU 11:59:00\n# keep computer awake as long as script2 is running\n1 12 * * * caffeinate -i path/to/script2\n# wake or power on computer a few minutes before script1 is scheduled\n1 12 * * * pmset repeat wakeorpoweron MTWRFSU 23:59:00\n\nAs an additional suggestion, I wouldn't schedule a shutdown or sleep event. Instead I'd run the script with caffeinate -i. This way the computer stays awake for as long as the script needs, and afterwards the system settings for sleeping take effect. This way your computer won't shut down while your working on it.\n\nA: Sorry, I only know command-line tools to do the job.\nYou can use pmset for that (like in pmset schedule wake \"02/12/2012 12:42:00\").\nMore explanations here and, of course, man pmset.\n\nSetting Multiple \"Power On\" & Power Off\" Events\nCurrently, it appears that pmset will NOT allow you to set more than  one pair of \"power on\" & \"power off\" events when using a repeating schedule.\nFor example...\n\n# pmset repeat shutdown MTWRFSU 02:00:00 wakeorpoweron MTWRFSU 06:45:00\n\n\nThe above command would set a repeating schedule that would shutdown the Mac nightly at 2 AM in the morning and startup daily at 6:45 AM.\nBut, if you want to set multiple \"power on\" & \"power off\" events, you could specify a specific date/time and with a little scripting you could setup a schedule for a month.\n\n# pmset schedule wakeorpoweron \"06/07/2007 07:00:00\"\n# pmset schedule shutdown \"06/07/2007 22:00:00\"\n# pmset schedule wakeorpoweron \"06/07/2007 00:00:00\"\n# pmset schedule shutdown \"06/07/2007 01:00:00\"\n\n\nA: I think this is what you are looking for.\nhttps://youtu.be/84fLayEY9Z4\nBest wishes!\n", "Q: OSX Network: \"could not save because write access was not granted\" We have a really basic network of Macs here in our studio.

The weird thing is if you simply close the file without doing a save as, it disappears from the folder it was in.\nI didn't set up our server, but I know we tried to enable all the permissions we could for every user.

I know the data antennas (3G, WiFi, etc.) power down to save battery, but push notifications still seem to come almost immediately. My iPhone and iPad will chime before the email shows up on my desktop. I'd hooked up a TCP/IP sniffer on my Wifi iPad and noticed the push notifications didn't come via TCP/IP. I understand the sending and receiving of push notifications from the App point of view (register the device, send notification to Apple, who sends it to the device), but would like to know more about this last leg of the trip. I see that Apple says port 5223 is involved somehow, but much in the way of details.\nI've searched around the web some and not found anything that explains the mechanism of delivering push notifications from Apple to an iOS device. Is it UDP? Is it an existing always on connection? Why doesn't it kill the battery? Basically, how can the notification happen almost immediately without keeping the radio always on, thus killing the battery?\n\nA: I unfortunately only know the answer to the second part of your question.\nAPNS (Apple Push Notification Service) uses XMPP (eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol). XMPP is commonly known as the Jabber IM protocol that also powers Google Talk. XMPP uses TCP port 5223.\nThe device (client) makes a connection to the APNS servers on port 5223. Thereafter, the server can send an XMPP message back to the client, which will in turn notify the subscribing application.\n\nA: WiFi networks use \"beacons\" to allow clients to enter power-saving mode, but still be notified regularly if there is any traffic waiting to be sent to them.\nBefore entering power-saving mode, a WiFi device checks how often beacons are sent from the AP (typically, every 100ms, so ten per second, but some APs will let you vary it) and then wakes up in time to receive it. This beacon tells the client if there is any traffic waiting to be sent to it. Thus, it can still spend most of it's time powered down, but occasionally wake up to see if there's any real work to do. If there isn't, it immediately goes back to sleep again. And therein lies the powersavng.\nGood page on it here: http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/1492071/\n", "Q: Why does Finder use 59GB of swap space? My new retina MacBook Pro(with 16GB RAM) keeps receiving this \"Your Mac OS X startup disk has no more space available for application memory\" message. I have 300 GB of free space on my hard drive, and 16 GB of RAM. This shouldn't be happening.\nBut it keeps happening, even when I'm not actively using my Mac. I went to lunch, came back, and saw this:  59 GB of swap used.\nWhat is going on?\n\nA: I believe this is a bug in OS X 10.7. I also have a retina MacBook Pro. Mine is 2.6/16/512, and I noticed that there were 0 page outs but a very large swap file being created (mine was about 8 GB). Closing applications actively reduced the swap space being used. Again there were no page outs being recorded. \nI believe this has to do with the sleep image file that also gets housed alongside the virtual memory files in /private/var/vm. When pmset hibernatemode is set to 3 (default for laptops, suspend to RAM and disk), sleepimage gets written upon sleep. This is why it takes a few moments for these laptops to go to sleep: it's writing up to 16 GB of RAM to the sleepimage.\nHowever, changing this setting so that the RAM gets powered on sleep and NO sleepimage is written has resulted in no abnormal increases in swap file size. My suspicion is that the sleepimage is in some cases being preserved post-sleep and prompting the creation of swap files. Perhaps it is this incorrect behavior that is also resulting in the unusually large swap file sizes you are seeing. \nFrom the manpage for pmset, to change to NO suspend to disk you would run in a Terminal: \nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\n\nTo delete the sleepimage (and reclaim 16 GB on your computer with 16 GB of RAM), run:\nsudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage\n\nI restart after these operations just to ensure there's no weirdness. On each power source, you can check the status with:\npmset -g\n\nYou should be aware that, in the event of a total power loss (battery dies and not plugged in) the contents of the RAM will not have been saved to the hard drive, and you will lose your work. For me, this is a small but calculated risk because the speed of sleep/wake, coupled with the great battery life and reclaimed storage space. Additionally, for me it seems to have mitigated this issue, which I have not seen on any other Mac laptop I've owned. I wish we had those battery indicator lights, though.\n\nA: I had this issue due to a bug in Dropbox on my MacBook Pro 13 inch.\nIt was a old version of Dropbox.

Please note that I need the calendars to be continuously synchronized.\n\nA: A .ics file is effectively a read-only solution. An iOS device can import a calendar that way (\"Subscribing\" in Apple's terminology) if it's hosted via HTTP, but it's a static file from the device's point of view. It only gets updated if the file at that URL gets updated, and the iPad can't add/edit/delete items. It's the digital equivalent of the flyer with your garbage collection schedule on it - you can read it, but you can't change it.\nTo get what you seem to want - a central calendar that one or more clients can access and update, you'll need some sort of calendar server software to keep everything in sync. CalDAV is an open standard that's well supported by the built in iOS calendar and most apps on other platforms.\nI don't know what server software is good, but there are several options to choose from. One alternative to running your own server is signing up for iCloud on your iPad and accessing the CalDAV server behind it from your other calendar clients (Lighting, etc.). It looks like this can be done without too much trouble, but I haven't tested it - I found a blog post with instructions here.\n", "Q: Sharing iTunes account My husband and I share the same iTunes account but when we sync our iPhones to the same account, we can no longer text each other.  \nI've tried starting my own account in which the iTunes will sync but all of my contacts and calendar events are no longer on my phone.  \nWhat can I do?\n\nA: Under Settings -> Messages, check \"Receive At\" - you are probably both using the same Apple ID for messages.  One of you will need to setup a separate Apple ID to use for Messages.  You should be able to do this while continuing to share the same iTunes account.\n", "Q: How to fix a Macbook that does not always draw its internal screen after waking from sleep and having unplugged external display while asleep? I have a 2012 MacBook Pro (Retina) which I mostly use on my desk. The computer is \"docked\" via a Thunderbolt display, and additionally a third-party DVI display, which I have hooked up via an Apple Mini Display Port to DVI adapter (the active one, doing 2560x1440).\nI use the MacBook during the day with the lid closed. So I work on the two external monitors. Via the Apple menu I put the Mac to sleep in the evening.\nSometimes, later in the evening, I like to take it downstairs and use it on my lap, so I unplug everything while the Mac is still asleep. I take the computer down and open it up.\nSometimes, when I open the lid up (not always) the internal screen does not come on. The back light illuminates, but there is no display.\nI know the MacBook is alive because I can SSH into it.\nPlugging the external monitors back in, in this state, has no effect.\nMy only workaround at the moment is to wake it up and do my replugging while it's awake but I don't think I should need to do this.\nSo, what might be causing this how to resolve it?\n\nA: In my experience, any Mac can be a little glitchy when waking from sleep out of \"clamshell mode.\" Likely what is happening is that when you unplug the MagSafe and Thunderbolt connections from the MacBook Pro, it is waking up. Then the System Management Controller (SMC) gets confused because your Mac is trying to wake up but it's lid is closed (and the sensor is telling it) which usually means that you want your Mac to be asleep (because you don't have an external display or mouse/keyboard hooked up.) What often ends up happening is the Mac is \"awake\" but the display is \"asleep.\"\nFollow these procedures and you SHOULD get consistent behavior...\n\n\n*\n\n*wake up the MBPro by opening the lid\n\n*unplug all your cables and make sure it was fully woke up\n\n*then put it back to sleep by closing lid and/or carry to your\ndesired destination.\n\n\nAdditionally, since you have setup remote login (via SSH) you could try telling the Mac to go to sleep via command line, wait 20 seconds, and then wake it up againe (open the lid/press a key on the keyboard.) This webpage describes the procedure:\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2012/03/14/remotely-sleep-mac/\nHTH\n\nA: I would pay attention to two factors:\n1) Do you have an external keyboard attached?\n2) The power situation - how/when sleep happens is affected by this\n3) If the lid is closed at the time you move the mac.\nA couple of examples will help illustrate this:   \nRecently I found that my external keyboard was not waking up the closed lid mac as I thought it should.  I found that this was because the power was unplugged and the 'lid closed' operation only worked with the power actually plugged in.\nAs another example I found that when my computer was asleep, in order to wake it up - without opening the lid! - the trick was to plug an external keyboard/mouse in and hit a key / move the mouse.  This then took the mac out of sleep (though again that may depend on whether you have power plugged in or not).\n\nA: I was having strange issues with my external monitor when waking my iMac from sleep. I reset my PRAM/NVRAM and it seems to have solved the issue (at least it hasn't come back in the week since I reset the PRAM/NVRAM). \nResetting PRAM and NVRAM instructions from http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1379\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the computer.\n\n*Locate the following keys on the keyboard: Command, Option, P, and\nR.

You must press this key\ncombination before the gray screen appears.\n\n*Hold the keys down until the computer restarts and you hear the\nstartup sound for the second time.\n\n*Release the keys.\n\n\nA: By any chance are you running gfxCardStatus?  (I've had similar issues with my non-Retina MBP recently, and that's the only thing I can think of that I've installed in the past couple of weeks.)\nIf not, did you use Migration Assistant to setup this machine?  Or did you set it up as a bare machine and manually reinstall apps and preferences?\nI would look for extensions and other items that may not be compatible with the Retina-MBP hardware.  Turn everything off and turn them on one-by-one, testing this issue each time.\n\nA: I have this problem constantly. It's hit-or miss. One way I found that works is I use Alfred and just tell it to sleep before I unplug. If the mac goes into normal sleep mode, unplugging will not cause issues. Actually I forgot -- \"Apple\" menu -> sleep should do the trick without Alfred.\nAnother possibility is to open the lid, wait for it to switch to dual monitor mode, unplug monitor, wait for it to switch to single monitor mode, close lid. This guarantees it will resume normally.\n", "Q: My Macbook Air won't connect to the internet I have a Macbook Air I bought in November 2011, v 10.7.4 and I have issues connecting to the internet.

Of course, needless to say, I get the same results (no output) if I use ps -ef instead of ps -eo pid,command.\nAlso, there's no /var/run/sshd.pid file.\nWhat's going on?  Does OS X use a different program to handle incoming ssh logins?\n\nA: No - OS X uses OpenSSH and you can inspect the source code used here.\nBased on your output, it looks like sshd is not active on the machine. Also ps|grep ssh[d] will prevent your grep process from matching the target. Some people get concerned when they don't see sshd running, since it gets started on demand when launchd detects an incoming network request. Are you certain ssh is active?

I know there's probably a setting in preferences, but I need to be able to do it without Word being open.\nThe problem is one of my docx has become corrupt, so every time Word opens it immediately stops responding and I can't access preferences.\nIs there a way to clear a cache or something somewhere so Word forgets about these files at startup?\n\nA: You want to disable the resume functionality in Microsoft Word 2011, which will prevent it from trying to reopen documents when the program is launched. Enter the following command in the Terminal:\ndefaults write com.microsoft.Word NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false\n\nThere are also full instructions on how to turn off resume for an arbitrary program.\nYou can also turn-off resume at the operating system level in System Preferences > General  then uncheck \"Restore windows when quitting and reopening apps\".\n\nA: I tried orangebox's and Adam's instructions and linked instructions but it didn't do the trick, so I tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Opening up, in this case, Excel, close all documents and quit Excel.\n\n*Open up the following folder: ~/Library/Saved Application State\n(you can also use the Cmd+Shift+G shortcut in Finder)\n\n*There you can search for the application folder. For me the folder is com.microsoft.Excel.savedState.\n\n*Select it, use Cmd+I for an information window on this folder and check the \"Locked\" option.\n\n\nNow Excel can't change the savedState folder and will always open with a blank spreadsheet, which is at least faster for me.\nWhen you drag a document on Excel (in the Dock for example) it will open it normally. Closing Excel and reopening still gets me a clean spreadsheet.\n\nA: From the macrumors forums you can hold shift when you launch a program to launch it without the resume previous window functionality.\n\nAlternatively, for those who want some resume functionality and don't\n  want to globally disable it, you can hold Shift when you launch an\n  application to bypass resume and start that app fresh.\n\nIf that doesnt work you can turn off the function globally by going to System Preferences -> General and unticking \"Restore windows when quitting and reopening apps\"\n(you can also disable the function on a per-app basis using the instructions here)\n\nA: I am on Mavericks and I tried all the advice given above and it did not really work for me.  What I did instead was to physically close each document in Word one by one but left Word open.  Then I went to the dock, right-clicked on the Word icon > open recents > clear recent.  It worked for me, thankfully.\n\nA: If you're on Mavericks, it's easiest to just open System Preferences and check \"close windows when quitting an application.\" That will prevent things like TextEdit from doing the same, so it might not be exactly what you want, but it works.\n", "Q: Installing Windows XP into Boot Camp under Lion I've been attempting to install Windows XP using Boot Camp with Lion 10.7.4 following the procedure in Pogue's  missing manual for Lion. \nI have partitioned my internal HD using Disk Utility and booted to my original XP installation disk. All goes well until the Installer requests that the Enter key be pressed to continue. \nThe two USB wired keyboards I have tried will not work with the installer, although they do work while still running the Mac OS. Any suggestions for getting this to work?\n\nA: You state in your question that you have partitioned your \"internal HD using Disk Utility\". \nFrankly, I do not see how this could possibly work since the hybrid MBR on your drive would not be properly configured if you partition your drive using Disk Utility. (This is just a guess, but possibly the BIOS emulation is also not correctly enabled?)\nI suggest you use Disk Utility to remove the partition you created for Win XP and then restore your OS X partition to its full size. Then use Apple's Boot Camp Assistant (located in the Utilities folder) to create the Windows partition to install XP into. \nUsing Boot Camp Assistant to create the partition will ensure the hybrid MBR is set up correctly. \n\nAnother alternative you might want to consider if your usage of XP is going to be minimal (i.e. no graphics intensive gaming) and your Mac has enough memory (at least 4 GiB) and a processor which supports virtualization. You might want to try installing Windows XP into a virtual machine instead. \nI have had good luck using a Oracle's free, open source virtual machine VirtualBox.\nThe advantage of using a VM is that you don't have to reboot your Mac to use Windows. You just start the virtual machine which runs under OS X.\n", "Q: Google Map directions on iPad When looking for directions, Google Maps says \"first of three suggested routes.\"  It shows the first, but I can find no way of finding out what the other two suggested routes are.  I've searched the screen and can see no way.  How do I do it?\n\nA: \nYes, I know this isn't an iPad screenshot, but I don't currently have iOS 5 on my iPad :). Regardless, the function is the same, you can tap the route labels in order to view the alternative routes. You may need to zoom in or out to see them.\n", "Q: Connection Timeout Error for WEP security I'm connecting my MacBook Pro to a router which uses WEP security. It shows a Connection Timeout error every half an hour. The security level of the router can't be changed, since its a common router. Other Mac systems are having no problems with it.\nSo far I've tried removing the network from the System Preferences/Network panel and restarting the router and the computer, with no luck. What should I do next? \n\nA: Different devices use different wireless chipsets. Although most should be compatible sometimes they don't work well together.\nDid you try to update the router's firmware? A newer one might correct some glitches.\n", "Q: How can I delete saved configuration passwords from AirPort Utility for iOS? I've tried deleting and reinstalling AirPort Utility, but I can still manage base stations without being asked for a configuration password.\nI'm thinking of selecting not to back up data from AirPort Utility, then making a backup to iCloud and wiping and restoring the device. Has anyone tried this?\n\nA: Since iOS doesn't have a keychain utility to go in and surgically remove the stored password, you would have to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*change the password on the base station to effectively lock out all clients with the old password.\n\n*erase the iOS device and refrain from restoring a backup that contained saved passwords onto the device. (Encrypted backups of the device typically store keychain items, non-encrypted backups don't save those passwords, so you might try an unencrypted backup, restore the backup and then test if the password was saved in the application bundle as opposed to a keychain).\n\n*As a long shot, try enabling iCloud keychain syncing and see if you can clean things on a Mac that has iCloud keychain syncing enabled as well by opening the iCloud keychain in Keychain Utility.\n\n\nA: Haven't tried your approach, but apparently you can't delete the passwords. After doing a little research I've found a lot of people complaining about this same issue, even in the App's Review.\nAlthough a nuisance, changing the password should revoke the management privileges of device, if that's what you're looking for.\n\nA: Did you try changing the passwords on the Airport devices? Airport Utility for iOS should show a new prompt to enter the passwords. Enter the new ones and change your Airports back to the old password.\n\nA: *\n\n*Change the password on the base station. \n\n*Update the base station\n\n*Do not store new password\n\n", "Q: Unable to save hosts file after adding websites to block. I'm unable to save hosts file after adding websites to block,as well as unable to flush cache.  I am not a techie, just researching on the web, and trying to follow directions for terminal and Text Edit.\nDid the problem start here (this is how text edit opened):\n\nHost Database\nlocalhost is used to configure the loopback interface\n  when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.\n127.0.0.1    localhost\n255.255.255.255   broadcasthost\n::1   localhost\n\nIt lacked a computer name (I don't have one; this is evident in the System Preferences > Internet and Network Sharing > Computer Name field being empty.) and the  \"fe80::1%lo0     localhost\" line.\n\"Couldn't Save The file 'hosts' is read=only. Attempt to overwrite?\" > Click  \"Overwrite\" > \"Couldn't Save Couldn’t save document as “hosts” in folder “etc”.\nThis is a PowerPC G4 running Tiger (OSX 10.4.11).\n\nA: This specific request \"I want to block sites and need to edit /private/etc/hosts\" requires you to know how to edit a normally hidden system configuration file. Your information on an older processor and OS are excellent, but in this case all OS X work the same for modifying the unix host file.\nThis error is intentional and by design, since making this file easy to modify means that you could easily break the computer from working (and also this file is very desirable for malware or trojan/virus software to attack - imagine if your banking website was directed to another site to harvest your user and password before sending that information to your real bank as part of a \"man in the middle\" attack.)\nMost people use a terminal based editor since it's easily to use the sudo command to temporarily edit the file with root permissions - taking care not to undo the protections that make this not writable by any users directly.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS X Server: How to edit configuration files\nAs always, be sure you know how to correct a change like this - the normal Time Machine backup should preserve this file if you know how to to navigate to the /private/etc folder using Finder Go -> Go to Folder... keyboard shortcut before entering Time Machine.\n\nA: If you want to have your computer to have a name for networking purposes just enter one in System Preferences > Internet and Network Sharing > Computer Name.\nThat's what I would recommend, because Apple OS X is mostly configured using Apple's GUI and not like other conventional Unices editing text files manually. Most of the time the manual edits will be overwritten.\nGenerally speaking if you want to edit system files I use the terminal most of the time. To get system privileges to be bake to save those files I use sudo, which precedes commands to execute the command with system privileges. Using sudo you have to type in your password to get access and you have to be an administrator.\nAn fairly easy to use command line editor would be nano, which belongs to OS X by default.\nEditing the hosts file would be:\nsudo nano /etc/hosts\n\nYou have to use control and not command keys to use nano. control+x would exit the editor. If you want to save your document, just answer y at the following prompt.\nFurther help in nano is displayed at the bottom of the screen.\n", "Q: Prevent iTunes from showing video preview frames By default, iTunes video podcasts display their album art as preview frames, rather than the embedded album art that ships with the file.  I have been manually replacing the image with each new episode, but that is very tedious.  Is there a way to prevent iTunes from displaying preview frames in this manner?\nThere is no Secrets entry for this and I haven't been able to find anybody as anal-retentive about this subject as I am.  Surely someone must exist out there.\n\nA: There isn't a setting to force iTunes to do this.\nThis actually depends on the the podcast creator and how they embed the album art into their video files.  So, if you aren't getting album art displayed, the issue is on the creator's end and not on yours.\n", "Q: streaming a full screen app or a screen space on apple TV I would like to see if there is a possibility of streaming a full screen app or a space onto Apple TV with MacOS mountain lion. The implication of this is that I could stream for example a tech talk on to my TV while I browse on another screen space. I believe that mirroring would just show the stuff that I see on my screen.\n\nA: Unless a hack will be  possible or Apple will have an AirPlay API for someone to make an application that makes the Apple TV a 2nd display it does not look possible with the advertised OS X Mountain Lion feature AirPlay Mirroring, since it will only allow mirroring of what is on your screen, probably only your primary screen too.\n\nWireless mirroring\nSend what’s on your Mac screen to an HDTV wirelessly with Apple TV. Mirroring is great for classrooms, conference rooms, and your living room.\n\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Retina suddenly stopped mounting Huawei USB modem I recently bought a MacBook Pro Retina. The first day I was able to connect my Huawei E352 3G USB modem and it worked all the day. After a couple of day I needed 3G connection again, but my MacBook Pro Retina does not recognize the modem anymore. There is a micro SD card in it, and it also does not mount. The modem works with my iMac flawlessly. All the MacBook Pro Retina USB ports work flawlessly, and recognize any other devices (pen drive, Blu-Ray writer, USB 3 external hard drive).\nAny ideas as to why the modem doesn't work anymore?\n\nA: The issue is probably that by pulling out the modem without safely ejecting it first, the MicroSD card became corrupted and/or the modem itself was damaged.\nThe simplest and quickest fix may be, unfortunately, to get a new modem.\n\nA: The Huawei modems are terrible. But regarding your problem, I've had it too, and the good news is that there is an easy fix. Provided it's visible in Disk Utility, open Disk Utility and select your device and run Verify and Repair Disk permissions. Run both the root and the sub disk.\n", "Q: Upgraded my HDD to SDD. Can boot successfully via USB but will not boot when in MBP I have a late 2011 macbook pro. I decided to upgrade to SSD. Here are the steps I took:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connected SSD via USB\n\n*Formatted using MAC OS Extended Journaled (using disk utility)\n\n*Cloned HDD to SSD using Carbon Copy Cloner (during this clone, I was prompted to create a recover partition which I did)\n\n\nI then rebooted (holding CMD + R) to select my new SSD as the boot up drive. This worked fine. To test this fully I created some files on the desktop and restarted several times switching between SSD and HDD to verify that I was actually booting up into SSD.\nI can boot up via SSD with the HDD in the MBP and SSD connected via USB. But when I remove the replace the HDD with my SSD and power it on, all I see is the apple logo and the spinning wheel forever. For some reason, I cannot boot up when it has been fitted inside.\nAny ideas why this may be?\nEdit:\nFurther on from this, I can't boot into the recovery partition and I have also cloned the them switched around (SSD internal, HDD on USB). This cloned fine but still presented me with the same problems. Attached is the CMD+V output from booting up with SSD inside. \n\n\nA: Thank you for all the responses. I believe I have tried everything and have lost count of how many time I have switched the drives, formatted and reinstalled the Lion.\nI figured out the problem, in the end, it turned out to be a problem with the firmware. The firmware on the drive was not compatible with late 2011 MBP and needed to be downgraded. After downgrading the firmware to 0309 it worked like a treat!\nThank you for all the responses, most appreciated. I hope this helps some people out.\n\nA: I know it might sound simple, but have you tried holding down Option while booting and seeing if the drive is visible to boot from.  If so, select it.  \nIf you tell the Mac to boot from a drive that is on a certain port or connected a certain way, and then move it to a different port or connection type, i.e. from USB to SATA in your case, the computer itself won't know that you made the move. It will look for the USB drive that is was booting off of because that is where you said to look.\nI had a similar issue when it came to booting off my new SSD in my MacBook Pro.  I told it to boot off my SSD when it was in a original HD SATA Port and then moved it to the place where the optical drive was using an OptiBay, putting the old HD back in its original bay so that I have two HDs. It booted up and spun for about 30 seconds, way too long for an SSD, and then found the old drive that I still had in the original HD bay, it never found the SSD because it wasn't where I had told it it was, so it then went and looked for things it could boot off and found the old HD before the new SSD.\nTry holding the Option key while booting and see if you can find your HD and boot from it, once you do, set it as the default boot drive in your system preferences so that it knows that its supposed to boot off of it.\nI hope that this helps.\n\nA: I had this issue also but discovered that Carbon Cloner gives boot priority to the Connection used to clone the drive i.e. USB. (If You Clone the drive via usb it will only boot via usb)\nSo I removed the main drive, inserted the drive I wanted to clone into the main slot, and cloned the old drive by connecting it to USB with the new drive in the main terminal. This worked perfectly and I have no issues with the cloned SSD not booting.\nHope This Helps!\n\nA: I'm battling the same problem with my Mid 2007 (7.1) iMac running Snow Leopard.  Cloned new 2 tb Seagate SATA drive in a external USB enclosure, removed 300gb Hitachi Deskstar internal drive (probably not the original) and installed the \"booting when USB\" Seagate in the internal mounting.  Will not boot either drive, new Seagate as internal and won't boot the previously internal Hitachi in the USB enclosure.  Only get the Apple logo and the spinning \"wait\" progress icon.  Holding the option key does nothing at all, cannot boot into Open Firmware, cannot boot into safe mode with the shift key.  I decided to order a new Snow Leopard CD/DVD and will install the OS from that onto the new drive in the internal position.\n\nA: If you cloned the drives, the content and name is the same. Try changing the name for the SSD to make sure the computer isn't changing to the HDD after unsuccessful booting from SSD via USB.\nTry booting from your HDD via USB while the SSD is connected internally to the MBP and clone the drives again to be sure the SSD works correctly while connected to the MBP directly.\n\nA: I have done something very similar recently. Although I was using spinning disks and not SSD. But for you it sounds like your SSD is working fine because it is working when it is on the outside of the computer.\nIf the above options aren't working with your set up I would suggest trying \"SuperDuper\" as your cloning tool. It worked great for me recently to move up disk sizes. The procedure I followed was exactly as you describe. \n\n\n*\n\n*Started with a Moutain Lion laptop.\n\n*Connected new (larger) disk to USB port on computer\n\n*Ran SuperDuper to clone the internal laptop hard disk to the new larger disk\n\n*Went to bed whilst disk clone ran\n\n*Booted off external disk by restarting and holding down option\n\n*Put external large disk into inside of MacBook\n\n*Rebooted, held down option and booted off the new disk.\n\n\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Spaces and some other fonts are changed to rectangles? I installed Microsoft Office 2011 yesterday on my MacBook Pro with Snow Leopard. I already had Microsoft Office 2008 on this device and simply added 2011. Now for some reason, many of my fonts have changed to rectangles as if I don't have the fonts installed. Also when I am in Mac Mail, the spaces are replaced with rectangles with \"A\" inside of them.\nHow can I fix this? Has anyone had a similar experience?\nIf you need more information from me, feel free to comment.\nSOLVED:\nI used the Terminal command:\nsudo atsutil databases -remove; sudo atsutil server -shutdown; sudo atsutil server -ping\n\nThis cleared the cache and resolved the problem.\nYou could also use Lion Cache Cleaner or CleanMyMac to clear the cache and restore all the fonts.\nNOTE: Make sure to open the \"Font Book\" application and make sure you resolve all duplicate fonts. Right-Click on the fonts with a small yellow attention sign beside it and click \"Resolve Duplicate\". This can also cause problems.\nGave credit to @da4 and @lri for there answer.\n\nA: Try cleaning your font caches - the simplest way is to use a maintenance utility such as Lion Cache Cleaner.\n", "Q: Find files created by program Is there an app out there that lets you see what files were created by a program?

I'm converting a shell script which xclip and similar tools on Linux, to use pbpaste and pbcopy on Mac. The problem is the default pasteboard ('general' according to the man-page) for these tools is not the one being used by Stickies / Safari / TextMate / all the GUI apps.\nI've tried all the pasteboard names mentioned in 'man pbpaste' but none contain the data I copy in any GUI app. If I load data into the 'general' pboard using 'pbcopy' I can extract it fine via 'pbpaste' - but it's separate from the GUI pasteboard.\nNote I'm not running any unusual shell, Terminal or WindowServer settings, this is standard 10.7 Terminal and bash.\n\nA: As suggested in one of the comments, the issue was a confused pasteboard server - a restart of that made everything work as expected.\n\nA: Check your bash aliases - is something aliasing pbcopy/pbpaste to use one of the other pasteboards?\nThe manpage for these commands mentions four possible pasteboards that they can use - general, ruler, find, and font. Try pbcopy -pboard general to force it to use the general pasteboard.\n\nA: If you are using the command under tmux / screen, you need some settings. There're great post on this problem.\nhttps://github.com/ChrisJohnsen/tmux-MacOSX-pasteboard/blob/master/README.md\n\nA: It can happen that you get different clipboards,    \n\n\n*\n\n*one with the old apps started before the new clipboard is used,    \n\n*and one with new apps which got started after the new clipboard was set.\n\n\nSo I guess the pasteboard used by the app will be set on startup of an app.    \n\nI currently have only Mail, Safari, TextEdit sharing a different clipboard, and all other apps sharing an older board. I believe I crashed/reset/recreated/duplicated the clipboard server by running the following command (ignoring man pboard(8) clearly stating Users should not run pboard manually.)\n$ pboard\n\nSadly I couldn't yet figure out how to cleanly restart the server (except a reboot), but that is my best guess as to when/why the clipboard 'group' changed.\n", "Q: How can I see how long my computer has been active (as in not idle) I've seen a variety of solutions to check how long my machine has been idle, and I know I can check how long since last reboot with uptime, but I'm curious if there's a way to see how long since my computer was last idle. Maybe since the last time the power save settings kicked in, or last time since the screensaver turned on / monitor turned off, etc? \nI'm fine using an applescript or shell command to determine this, if those are the best solutions.\n\nA: You can also find the idle time in UNIX by running\nioreg -c IOHIDSystem\n\nAnd looking for the returned HIDIdleTime\nOr you could run a shell script on idle like so, just call it every 30 seconds or so using LaunchD.

This can be accomplished by double clicking the divider between two column's headers. But I can't find a way to do the same using AppleScript. This is what I've tried:\nFinder's column class has the attributes width, minimum width and maximum width but there doesn't seem to be a way to use the width attribute to resize the column to it's optimal width.\nI also tried to use UI Scripting to simulate a double click in the small region around the column header divider using the following script:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Finder\"\n        set nameButton to button \"Name\" of group 1 of outline 1 of scroll area 1 of splitter group 1 of first window\n\n        set {px, py} to position of nameButton\n        set {sx, sy} to size of nameButton\n        set clickPos to {px + sx, py + 5}\n\n        click at clickPos\n        click at clickPos\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThis should simulate a double click between the headers of the Name column and the column to it's right but it is instead processed by Finder as two distinct clicks on the header of the second column which just changes the sorting order of that column twice.\nThe Accessibility Inspector also doesn't \"see\" the small regions around the dividers of column headers and always shows the properties of either column header.\nIs there any other way to accomplish this?\n\nA: The only thing that I can think of off the top of my head would be to get a list of the items in the current folder, find the item with the longest name, and then resize the width per that value. That's really all that's happening with the optimal width double-click.\n", "Q: 10.7: managing SMTP (outgoing) server for multiple POP email accounts on the same mail server Folks:\nre:   mail.app  5.2 (MacOS 10.7.4), possibly similar for earlier versions\nI'm struggling to understand how to establish and maintain multiple simple POP, non-SSL email accounts on the same mail server.  Say, I have two accounts for which the hosting service control panel gives these manual setup summaries:\n  account: blue@example.com\n  password:  [blue's password]\n  outgoing server:  smtp.example.com, on port 98\n  incoming server:  pop.example.com, on port 99\n  account: green@example.com\n  password:  [green's password]\n  outgoing server:  smtp.example.com, on port 98\n  incoming server:  pop.example.com, on port 99\nI want to add these to mail.app.   No problem with establishing and maintaining the incoming account information.  But mail.app uses a non-parallel method for specifying the outgoing server, yes?   It wants you to enter the data for a multiply-used SMTP (outgoing) server once, then assign each parallel account to that server.   For the above accounts, I think success of this process is indicated by the SMTP Server List (as seen in edit-the SMTP-Server-List mode) showing:\n          Server Name               In Use By Account\n          -------------------               --------------------------------------------------------------------\n          ...\n          smtp.example.com      blue@example.com, green@example.com\n          ...\n\n(Leftmost \"Description\" column omitted.  The table display will likely be mangled in this posting;  you can possibly see it correctly by copying the above, pasting it into a new document in an editor, and setting a monospaced font.   I think the accounts are listed in order of establishment;  here \"green\" is the second account entered for this outgoing server.)   \nSo far, so good?\nThough the basic information about the outgoing server --the server name and port settings-- is the same for both accounts,  I think one must set --and later, maintain-- the account name and passwords individually for  each account, even though the common server information is the same.  These are not simply copied from the incoming values for the same account,yes?  (I do not recall seeing an email account in which these credentials differ for the incoming and outgoing servers, and I'm fairly sure some client apps automatically use the same for both.)\nI cannot seem to find a method in mail.app's UI to set and later reach these unique settings. \nReference:   this thread gives the general method for adding the second account, but is not sufficiently specific, and refers to mail.app on MacOS10.6.\nWhen I add the second outgoing account, selecting the common server from the Outgoing Mail Sever (SMTP):  pull-down gives me the information for the first account.   Am I supposed to over-write that information?  I don't think so -- correct me if I'm wrong.  I think mail.app should present me with empty boxes, indicating I can enter the new account name and password for the second account. But it doesn't.  (Maybe occasionally, it does, but I can't really figure out how this works.)  \nThe same goes for later maintenance.  If the password for the \"green\" account changes, I need to make that change to both the incoming and outgoing server, (right?) but I don't see a method for persuading mail.app to show me the credentials for \"green\" so I can update the password for green's outgoing server.\nHow is done?   Am I missing something incredibly obvious?  \nSupplemental:  I noticed that I can run Connection Doctor and click on the rectangle of a failing (\"red light\") SMTP account to bring up the Edit SMTP window. Cool!  That would be a reasonable, though obscure, way of accessing the SMTP credentials following a password change for that account.   But the account selected in that window seems to have nothing at all to do with the failing server.  It looks like mail.app highlights a random SMTP account in the Edit SMTP window.\nTIA\n\nA: Update: I've now demonstrated this problem is broken navigation in mail.app.  That's sufficiently different to close the above question and start a new thread, which I've done:  10.7 mail.app preferences-->accounts navigation broken; how to fix?\n", "Q: Force window to appear on a select screen Is there a way to make a window in OS X Lion always initially appear on a select screen? So that when the window appears, it'd automatically appear on the screen I select?\n\nA: If by screen, you mean desktop, I think this is how you can do it:  \nGo to the desktop you want.\nOn the doc, right click (or control-click) the item you want to appear on a certain screen.   There should be a menu with \"options\" on it.  Select options, and from the submenu select \"this desktop\".\nReturn to any other desktop and verify, that if you were on, say 'desktop 2' when you selected 'this desktop', the options will have 'desktop 2' checked.\nThen if you click the app on the dock from whatever desktop, your desktop will switch automatically.  Results may not be the same when you open the app with some different method.  For example, when I tried from a terminal window \"open -a Bean\"  it opened Bean in the right desktop, but did not swithch automatically.  When I tried to open Firefox with open -a, basically nothing happened (apparently).\n(I'm on Lion 10.7.4, but as I recall this also worked in a similar way on earlier distributions.)\n", "Q: QuickLook stopped working What might cause quicklook to 'freeze', as it were.\nquicklook has gone south to some degree, some files are QL-able, other not, \nand we're speaking of the apple plug-in type (pdfs, txt, jpg, etc.)\nEven whilst running the Topher 'fix', terminal hangs \nafter either the qlmanage -r or qlmanage -r cache.\nCheers, and thanks in advance for any light \nyour available time might hereby shed. :)\nRunning OSX, ver 10.6.6 on an iMac\n\nA: It is possible that some QL plugins are broken, you should check \n~/Library/QuickLook/\n/Library/QuickLook/\n/System/Library/QuickLook/\n\nfor new QL plugins (check the date of the files).

I just installed Prompt on my iPad so I could possiby do some real work on my iMac via ssh.  so far Mutt and Vim and emacs seemto work responsively enough for me.  I've made a few tries at emacs before, but am essentially relearning it.\nOf course the emacs that comes with Lion is 22.1.1.  I installed the current emacs cocoa on my iMac,  but it doesn't run in a terminal.\nIs there a terminal version of 24 precompiled for OS X?  Or is compiling it straightforward?  So far I've had no need for Macports or Homebrew, and would prefer not to use them.\n\nA: As far as I know, every emacs under the sun can run in a terminal:\n/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -nw\n\nChange the path, of course, if your emacs resides elsewhere. If this is too long to type, even with tab completion, you can create a symlink to the Emacs executable, or make an alias for your shell.\nLook to http://emacsformacosx.com/ for a precompiled modern Emacs for OS X.\n\nA: The emacs wiki has a nice summary of your options to get a package manager and compile your own version of emacs as new as you please.\nI would choose homebrew  unless you read something you really prefer about one of the other tools for managing open source tools.  If you are happy with version 22.1.1 you can just install Xcode and download the command line tools as they package emacs for the terminal with the rest of the things you'll need to compile the source yourself.\n", "Q: Any iPhone apps for fine-resolution mapping? I am trying to record tracks at a much finer scale than is possible with GPS, but hopefully using something simple and cheap, ideally an iPhone. The resolution for track data I am after is around 10-20cm.\nThe location of the track, and even the scale is not as important as the fine details of the shape of the track.\nWhat I have in mind as the ideal solution is an iPhone app that uses the camera in conjunction with the other sensors to record a track in a similar way to an optical mouse detecting movement over a desk's surface.\nSo you would hold the phone with the camera facing down and walk the track. The app would trace the moving surface and infer where it is going, using the gyroscope and accelerometer to help correct for tilting the camera. It would also use the gyro and to a lesser extent the compass to help correct and detect the turns in the track. The height of the phone off the ground I don't think could be sensed or inferred but you could just enter that and hold it carefully at a consistent height. The LED could be on to aid detection through shadows.\nIf you happen to be walking in a track that finished where it started, you could mark that in some way to close the loop and it would try and correct it if the ends didn't meet up, and if you walked a long way, perhaps over 50 meters, it could also use GPS data to calibrate the scale of the track, but probably not really contribute much to the details of the track's geometry.\nSo does something like this even exist in any form for iPhone or otherwise? Is there anything which is simpler, e.g., it just uses the gyro/compass and a pedometer-style measurement method?\n\nA: Clearly, there aren't any popular apps that replicate an Inertial Navigation System which is what you describe.\nThe wikipedia article I link above illustrates that the integration errors that crop up from this sort of apparatus build up over time and errors of hundreds of meters are possible after only an hour of operation.\n\nGPS would be far more accurate than inertial calculations given the limitations and lack of precise calibration of the gyroscope sensors within an iOS device. They are designed to detect gross movements (10-25 degrees) and other tools like laser or echo location would be needed to measure a path over a 50 meter span more accurately than GPS will allow.\n\nA: The M7 in the new iPhone 5S should do pretty much exactly this. I don't know whether there are any specific apps that do exactly what you're looking for yet, but the new hardware enables this sort of functionality.\nARGUS - Motion and Fitness Tracker by Azumio looks like it might be fairly close.\nPlus, if you can't find one, you could always write your own!\n", "Q: Different desktop with different dock? I'm using 10.7.4, and I use multiple desktops (in Spaces). When I switch between desktops, the dock does not change. \nI open an application in Desktop 1 and its icon remains in the dock after I switch to Desktop 2.\nWhat I want is I open an application in Desktop 1, its icon remains in Desktop 1's dock, When I switch to Desktop 2, Desktop 2's dock only has application icons that I open in Desktop 2.\nIs it possible to do that; to have different desktops with different docks?\n\nA: Lion doesn't support that. It wasn't supported in Spaces under older versions of OS X, either.\n\nA: I don't believe that is possible, even with third party software.

Is there a way to create a bootable DVD/USB from a running system so I can try running the Disk Utility app?\n\nA: Honestly, you don't mess around with these messages. I think that the first thing to do is to make sure you have a complete backup of your hard drive. Get a second drive with enough capacity. Use Carbon Copy Cloner or Time Machine, or Super Duper to copy the drive.\nOnce you have a backup, you could easily reformat the drive, (this will avoid bad sectors), and then copy back from the backup.\nMy 2¢ Hope this helps..\n\nA: This answer pertains to your bootable DVD/USB question.\nIf you are using Snow Leopard, you'll need the Snow Leopard install DVD, which will allow you to run Disk Utility (you'll find it in the Utilities menu).  In order to boot from DVD, hold C during boot (after the startup chime but before the Apple logo appears).\nIf you are using Lion, you can create a bootable Lion DVD or USB key from a running system by following these instructions from Lifehacker.  You can then run Disk Utility from there.\n", "Q: Why do images with the same dimensions have different size icon previews? Why is the preview icon for one image larger and the other smaller?\n\nThe images should be the same size. Css_cursor_pointer.png was opened in Photoshop and saved as cursor.png.\n\nA: I know that problem. It's probably because your \"DPI\" is different on both of them. Had this a lot of times...\n\nA: Image files can be embedded with preview images, which makes them slightly larger. The original image (Css_cursor_pointer.png) probably didn't have one, so the large preview image was generated Finder. When cursor.png was saved as PNG, Photoshop added the small preview image.\nSave for Web & Devices would save images without the thumbnails. They can also be removed later with image optimization utilities like ImageOptim. Finder caches the preview images so it might keep showing the old ones even after they have been removed.\nOne way to add the preview images to files would be to use the Add Thumbnail Icon to Image Files action in Automator.\n", "Q: Multiple users working remote on one mac? we want to develop some iOS apps in our company.

It would be enough, if only two users could connect at the same time to the mac.\nOr do we have to buy a Mac for every developer in out team?\nThanks\nKonrad\n\nA: If your plan is development using Xcode , then forget about multiple users on a single mac, because of 2 reasons \n\n\n*\n\n*Multiple instances of XCode will make the system slow ,\n\n*even if you solve issue 1 buying adding lots of RAM and a powerful processor, the iOS simulator won't allow us to run more than 1 instance at a time. \n\n\nSo developers will face issue while developing. The best option for you for to reduce initial cost is go for multiple mac mini's with non-Apple displays and keyboard.\nHope this helps \n\nA: I tried some development to a remote Mac once. It was a terrible experience. Even over a LAN, the latency of the display update speed was maddening in what should be an instant-feedback development UI.\nYou could maybe try using virtual machines on the Mac Mini (I don't know how this would affect licensing, you'd probably have to buy another OSX per virtual machine) which would get around not being able to run more than one iOS Simulator as mentioned in the previous answer).

While the Lion supports this feature, it will only allow you do restore one file at a time. \nWith 4,000+ files my eyeballs would fall out by the time I finished. \nFortunately someone at Apple invented Apple Script. \nAnd someone else wrote a script that will undelete files one file at a time. \nI ran the script went to bed and found that it worked!!!! \nOf the 4,000 file only 1,700 remained in my trash (Woo Hoo!!!). \nThe problem is the remaining files require me to enter a password before the restore can take place.

Once a script is correctly authenticated, it will not ask for authentication again for five minutes. The elevated privileges and the grace period do not extend to any other scripts or to the rest of the system. For security reasons, you may not tell another application to do shell script with administrator privileges. Put the command outside of any tell block, or put it inside a tell me block.\n  Default Value:\n  false\n\nSo it should be something like do shell script \"whatEver\" with administrator privileges. \n\nA: Alternatively, run the script using sudo, e.g. in the prompt, type:\nsudo command\n\nwhere command is whatever you want to run as root (super-user).

I have two 21\" LCDs that I use as external monitors. One uses the built in Mini Display Port on the Macbook Pro and the other is connected via a USB to DVI adapter (Diamond DVILink).\nThe problem I am having is with the 13\" built in display of the Macbook Pro. I would like it to remain closed and unused (I prefer the dual monitors at same resolution), however I cannot seem to \"disable\" the display in the display preferences applet. So even though the Macbook Pro lid is closed the operating system still makes use of the display, even though the apple logo on the back of the display is unlit. I have tried to move the laptop screen off out of the way in display preferences but I find when I \"sleep\" my setup that any applications that remain open move to the laptop screen. This makes it difficult to locate the application windows when resuming from sleep.\n\nDoes anyone know of a way to disable the laptop built in display so it is not seen by the OS when external monitors are being used?\n\nA: Turning the brightness down as suggested above turns the monitor off on my MacBook Pro - mid 2014 model. Keeping the lid open allows better dissipation of heat and keeps the fan noise to a minimum so this is my preferred mode of working.\n\nA: You should be able to close the lid and use an USB mouse/keyboard to awaken the computer to only use the external display.\nThe interesting thing here, is that you use an USB-graphcis adapter too.  That software may confuse this process.\nI would suggest just using the native graphics ports to begin with and see if you can make it work, and then add the USB-adapter.\n\nA: I use a very naive solution on a Macbook Air mid-2012: instead of using clamshell mode (closing the lid), I just press the brighness down button until the lowest level. For my surprise, the lowest level turns off the internal display. I don't know if this works for others models, but it works well for me.\n\nA: There's a tool that allows you to disable internal display: https://github.com/Eun/DisableMonitor.\nI've been using it with success in the same scenario.\nDisclaimer: I'm not a maintainer, so I fear I won't be able to provide support in case of any problems. Please use github issues.\n\nA: On 10.6 an earlier, the internal display stayed disabled even after opening the lid. There's a firmware variable that restores that behavior:\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"iog=0x0\"\n\nI don't know if it would help in this case though. You don't have to reboot when changing display configurations.\n\nA: Lunar can turn off the MacBook display without having to close the lid of the MacBook.\n\nThis allows the MacBook to cool down faster and allows you to keep using TouchID, webcam and the very nice speakers of the MacBook, while being able to focus on the external monitor.\nThe feature is called Blackout, here are some more details: lunar.fyi/#blackout\nHow it works:\n\n*\n\n*Sets the native brightness of the MacBook display to 0\n\n*Sets the Gamma tables of the MacBook display to a list of zeroes\n\n*Mirrors the external monitor to the MacBook display so that:\n\n*\n\n*The monitor keeps its native resolution\n\n*Apps/windows don't get trapped on a non-visible display\n\n\n\nTo activate, just press Control+Command+6 and Lunar will toggle Blackout and do all of the above steps for you.\nDisclaimer: I'm the developer of Lunar and BlackOut is a paid feature with a free 14-day trial\n\nA: I have Mac book Pro Retina 13 late 2013 and turning brightness down to the end made my lid off with two external monitors connected one via hdmi another one via thunderbolt port.\nAs @Mikey said closing lid and using external monitors can cause serious heat problem for lap top it's true and i asked apple support directly for making sure. it's better to let it be open and using external monitors.\n", "Q: How to get + metacharacter for sed in Terminal? It looks like sed that comes with Mac OS 1.7.4 is the original one, without the + metacharacter. Can I get the + metacharacter functionality?\n\nA: OS X's implementation of sed uses the \"basic\" regular expression format by default, which doesn't support +.  From man re_format:\nObsolete (``basic'') regular expressions differ in several respects.  `|'\nis an ordinary character and there is no equivalent for its functional-\nity.  `+' and `?' are ordinary characters, and their functionality can be\nexpressed using bounds (`{1,}' or `{0,1}' respectively).  Also note that\n`x+' in modern REs is equivalent to `xx*'.  The delimiters for bounds are\n`\\{' and `\\}', with `{' and `}' by themselves ordinary characters.  The\nparentheses for nested subexpressions are `\\(' and `\\)', with `(' and `)'\nby themselves ordinary characters. [...]\n\nSo, what can you do?  Well, one possibility is to tell sed to use the modern format with the -E switch.  This may, however, force you to rewrite other parts of your RE to conform (for example, swapping \\( ... \\) with ( ... )).  Another option is to use one of the suggested alternate forms above.  Here are examples using the various approaches to match \"A\" followed by one or more \"B\" or \"C\", followed by \"D\":\nsed -E 's/A[BC]+D/[match]/'\nsed 's/A[BC]\\{1,\\}D/[match]/'\nsed 's/A[BC][BC]*D/[match]/'\n\n\nA: The + is a GNU extension of sed that matches one or more of the preceding expression but the version on OS X is BSD sed.  A version of GNU sed has been ported to OS X on MacPorts.  Otherwise you'll need to try a workaround.  \nFor example, to match one or more digits, you could use [0-9][0-9]* instead of [0-9]+\n", "Q: At the command line, how can I 'arrow along' faster using words instead of chr's I am at the command line and I have\n. /this/set/of/directory/this_command \"parm1\", \"parm2\", \"parm3\"\nWhen I 'up-arrow' to recall previous lines, how can I move along the line from \"word to word\".

Additionally, you can use opt+click to reposition the cursor.\n\nA: As a general solution for the bash shell (Linux/Mac) : I set the Vi mode with\n$ set -o vi\n\nI have set it in the global /etc/bashrc file.\nThat way I can navigate with the usual vi keys within a command line after hitting the ESC key.\nE.g. changing into Vi mode and then by pressing 'b' I can move back a word. And since the directory seperator counts as a word seperator it would work for your example.\nTyping 'w' would move to the right again by a word each time. And so on\n\nA: If you'd prefer not to switch to vi mode, you can check “Use option as meta key” under Preferences… > Settings > any profile > Keyboard. With that enabled you'll be able to hit Opt+B & Opt+F to move backward & forward a word at a time, along with a plethora of other emacs-style shortcuts.\n", "Q: How do I install a2ps for better printing?

This allows you to easily install new command-line applications.  \nThen, just use the following terminal command:\nsudo port install a2ps\n\n\nA: I have homebrew so the solution for me was:\nbrew install a2ps\n\n", "Q: Why are my images exported to flickr at a lower resolution when I asked for \"Actual size\"? When I export a bunch of images to Flickr by using the built-in share to flickr, I see the images getting exported but they all appear as max 1024 pixels on either side. I did select \"Actual size\" when exporting so it should use the full resolution. And I think it did work fine in a previous export.\n\nA: Just wait a little longer. What happens is that it starts by uploading 1024-sized images, and then later replaces them with high-resolution versione. So if you check flickr while it is still working you will see the lower-resolution versions but wait and reload and it will be high-resolution.\n", "Q: Time Machine from networked Mac?

I just don't know how to get them back on the device. The back ups are all encrypted.\n\nA: If you used the iTunes backup restore process or the iCloud backup restore process, then your messages should have been transferred automatically back to your phone as these are included with the iTunes/iCloud backup.\nIf for some reason this did not happen, you might want to try restoring again or restoring from a different backup (if available).\nReference: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4946\nNote the mention of Messages in the list of data that is backed up.\niTunes will back up the following information \n    - Messages (iMessage and carrier SMS or MMS pictures and videos).\n\n\nA: If you have back up your sms, you can restore from the backup.\nTo restore information from a backup, use one of the following methods after connecting your iOS device to the computer with which you normally sync:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click (or Control-click) the device and choose Restore from Backup\n\n*If you have a new phone, you can connect to iTunes and it will prompt to restore from your backup\n\n\nSolution from Apple.com: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1766\n", "Q: What are the differences between an iMac Display and a Thunderbolt 27\" display Context: I purchased a Mac mini 2011 (lower end) last year to move from PC to a Mac. I went for a Mac mini because I wanted to reuse my old PC's peripherals. Later however, I developed a liking for the Apple Touch Mouse, the Bluetooth keyboard, and the external SuperDrive and supplemented my Mac mini with them. Now I am wondering if the Thunderbolt display is any good (I am currently using a 20\" LED display from Samsung). Obviously, this leads me to wonder if I would have been more cost effective to go for the iMac 27\" to begin with.\nActual Question: What are the differences between the iMac 27\" display and the Thunderbolt 27\" display? Why is the sum of prices of the parts of an iMac 27\" significantly more than the whole unit's price? Are there better alternatives to the Thunderbolt 27\" display that will work great (fonts should appear smooth and the display should have a high resolution and a high contrast ratio) with OS X?\n\nA: Thunderbolt Display:\n\nThis huge 27-inch glossy widescreen display features a cinematic 16:9 aspect ratio and an astonishing 2560-by-1440 resolution. \n\niMac 27-inches:\n\n27-inch (viewable) LED-backlit glossy widescreen TFT display with support for millions of colors. Resolution: 2560 by 1440 pixels\n\nYou won't notice any difference between them. Therefore, if the concern is just with the Display, the Thunderbolt's should be your choice. If, in the other hand, you are feeling that your Mac Mini is not powerful enough for you, getting an iMac could be a good idea. \n", "Q: Can I use Apple TV First Gen as a wifi extender? I have my router on one end of the house and my xbox on the total opposite side. My mom won't let me run an ethernet cord down stairs and won't let me reposition the router in the middle of the house. All i have is a first gen apple tv and since it has wifi and an ethernet port, I thought I could use it in some way to get the wifi signal and repeat it through the ethernet to my xbox. I have seen people put leopard on the first gen aTV and I thought maybe I should do that as a last resort (the sharing internet option). I come to this amazing community for help incase there's an alternative to my last resort.\nThank you!!\n\nA: It should work if you do as you suggest - hack your Apple TV to install OS X on it, you should be able to use Internet Sharing to share the wifi signal. There are many resources on how to do this, but this blog post should be a good starting point.\nTwo caveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*I haven't tried this, so no promises.\n\n*Because of how Internet Sharing works (it's using NAT), whatever is on the wifi side of the network may have limited access to the rest of your network. Internet access should work okay, but things like iTunes Home Sharing and the like won't be accessible.\n\n", "Q: How do I type the Escape key on an iPad keyboard? I just got a Zagg keyboard and it is great for typing long sections of text on the iPad.  But a big drawback is that it does not have an Escape ⎋ key.  All the top row keys are mapped to iPad-specific features. This is bad when using vim or remoting into a Windows machine.  Does anyone know how to get the Escape ⎋ key to work?  Or is there a better iPad keyboard out there that has the Escape ⎋ key?\n\nA: After much research I cound not find a solution to get the key to work.  My solution was to return the Zagg keybard and simply get a standard wireless keyboard from the Mac store.  It feels solid and works great.  A tad more bulky than the Zagg, but I love that it works with more than just the iPad.\n\nA: Give Ctrl and [ a try that should send the same as Esc (ASCII 27).\n\nA: For shell-level stuff I use an app called Prompt to SSH into servers and it has ESC and other commonly used VI keyboard sequences. \nI am still looking for an escape key for use with the Amazon web services console, when it randomly tosses up a \"Please wait...\" browser dialog box which it also says to press Esc to end it. No solution yet with either Chrome or Safari that I know of so far. I could use my Mac keyboard, but don't usually have it with me.\n\nA: Fn+Home = Escape ⎋. Easiest thing ever.\n\nA: Try fn and the square button (where the Esc key would be)\n\nA: If you have a keyboard with the \"keyboard key\" the fourth from the left On the top row of keys. This functions like the escape key on other keyboards.\n\nA: The Zaggkeys keyboard for the iPad mini works well with vim.\nOn starting the program touch the centre of the screen twice and then press i for insert mode.\nTo leave insert mode and enter command mode use the backslash character. This can be obtained by holding the fn key and pressing the key that has the characters ]\\} and | on it.\nI haven't worked out how you get a \\ character into your text.\n\nA: Take 3 fingers and swipe down on your i-pad screen.  That brings up a menu bar at the bottom of the screen that has an escape button on it.  Touch the escape button on your screen.\n\nA: I don't know if the Zagg keyboard has a Control, but my iPad keyboard has one, and if I do Control-C, it forces Vim to quit (at least on my VPS).\n\nA: Ctrl-[ (Ctrl + left bracket) is identical to Esc.  Am using the Zagg with a Galaxy Tab 10.1 and really love it.\n", "Q: Why is exFAT so slow on Mac? I tried exFAT in order to use my external hdd on both mac and windows but I found it's so much slower than HFS+. The speed is noticeably different when I tried to fast forward movies (over 4gb). \nexFAT was recommended in this question.\n\nA: exFAT is a file system optimized for flash drives, meaning storage devices without moving parts where seek times are constant. It sounds like you're using it for a mechanical hard drive – which is what's causing the poor performance that you're experiencing.\nYou should reformat the drive to HFS+ or FAT32 and only use exFAT for solid-state drives.\nref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExFAT\n", "Q: Does Apple change OS X operating systems between the GM and the final release? For instance, I've found quite a few bugs while working with the Mountain Lion Golden Master. Is there any chance Apple might fix these in the public release?\nThanks!\n\nA: There's a first time for everything but, but basically: no.\nUnless you have found the mother of all security bugs, so humiliating that it would overshadow Apple's entire Mountain Lion release, the bug to end all bugs and live on in infamy, it just is not going to happen.\nNot to mention, fixing and testing bugs generally takes time. The fastest Apple bug fix ever, to my knowledge, took two days but that's very unusual for a company its size.

How to use SSL tunnelling on OS X to give full internet access to some applications while you are on a restrictive corporate network?\nDetails:\n\n\n*\n\n*you want to be able to access some restricted destinations and/or ports with some applications from your computer but you are on a restricted network (corporate) - Even using a Torrent client.\n\n*you have an AWS machine running Ubuntu that you can use as a proxy (and you can SSH to this machine)\n\n*You cannot create a full VPN because this means that you will loose access to your intranet and you do not want that.\n\n\nA: You can create a local SOCKS proxy by using the dynamic port forwarding function of SSH by running ssh with the -D flag. This will tunnel all traffic of applications that use the local SOCKS proxy through SSH connection.\nFor example running ssh -D1234 user@host will open a SOCKS proxy on localhost port 1234 that you can direct your applications to.\n\nA: Assuming that you are running Lion or greater, I would recommend that you create an OS X virtual machine (using VMware Fusion or Parallels Desktop) and route that through a full VPN.  \nAlternatively, if you have a Mac at home, you could just use VNC or some other remote desktop solution and run your applications from there.\n", "Q: tmux on Mac, how can I enable vi mode for the command line I want to be able to hit escape and then use vi navigation keys like b (back a word).

At least you can in CS6, I don't have CS5 installed anywhere any more. But for a more in depth look into how to style dreamweaver's layouts check out this help page from Adobe, it's pretty straight forward. \nYou may also find that changing to one of the other preset work spaces suits you better.

Is there a way to rip DVDs so that iTunes plays the DVD exactly like as if you playing from a disc. I mean so that it has the menus, and extra features like audio, commentary, subtitles, and deleted scenes etc.\nI would like to store my DVD collection on my iTunes server, but don't want to have the features as extra files or not at all.\nI've downloaded movies from iTunes which have iTunes extras so it is possible, but is it possible to convert DVDs to these format?\n\nA: You can rip a full disc as an ISO file or a folder structure. That will give you the exact contents of the disc that you can store on a hard drive (local or networked), but iTunes can't play those types of files. Other programs, such as VLC can play it back, with menus and all. You can rip to this format with RipIt, but there are others out there too.\nExtras in downloaded iTunes movies (and the similar feature for music, iTunes LP) are built with a framework called TuneKit, for which Apple has posted some developer information. From what I can tell, it's basically all the media (videos, pictures, music) in iTunes-compatible format (i.e. H.264 m4v for video), tied together with some HTML and CSS for the \"menus\".\nSo if you're comfortable with web development, it looks like it's possible to create your own iTunes Extras to package the content from a DVD, but you'll need to recreate the menus on your own, they can't be ripped directly to this sort of format. Extra audio tracks, commentary, and subtitles can all be ripped by standard tools like Handbrake, and deleted scenes or other video features can be ripped as separate video files, then linked in via the menus you create. There are some tutorials from Gigaom and iTunesLP.net that apply to iTunes LP, but the format seems to be pretty similar, so they may help.\nSo all in all, it's possible to create a similar experience to a full DVD in iTunes, but it will take a lot of work on your part. Alternatively, if you use another application, you can get the full, bit-for-bit copy by ripping to ISO files.\n", "Q: OS X Lion not able to login with regular open directory domain users I've configured a Lion client machine to connect to my OS X server and use it for network logins. The diradmin works okay, but I tried to use a regular user, and it doesn't allow any other users to log on.\nWhere can I start to troubleshoot this?\n\nA: I'm guessing from your tags this is a 10.5 Server with 10.7 clients? \nIn your Open Directory user configuration/preferences are you using portable home folders? (With the user in question selected in Workgroup Manager, choose the Preferences button and check the \"Mobility\" section)\nIf so (and even if not!), check that your users have a Home path set in Workgroup Manager -> Accounts -> testuser -> Home tab. Usually the diradmin default home is set to /var but for other users I've seen it default to (None) which causes the login window to just shake and reject the user when trying to log in on a client system, probably because the system doesn't know where to create their home folder.\nTry a test where you set testuser's Home location to /Users/testuser by clicking the + in the Home tab of WGM and entering /Users/testuser under the Full Path: field (I'm basing this wording off a 10.6 server but I recall 10.4 to 10.6 being all quite similar.)\nGood luck!!\n\nA: (assuming server is 10.5)\nCheck out the Service Access Lists (SACLs) on the server under Server Admin -> Settings -> Access. Make sure you aren't restricting access to Login Window (or something similarly named).\nAlso, is the workstation in the Workgroup Manager?

I'm interested in upgrading my old MacBook to using an SSD and moving the data drive to where the DVD drive is using an optibay.\nOften SSDs come with a licence for NVELO Dataplex software (which is windows only). This software is basically a windows driver that keeps track of commonly used files and moves then to the SSD, thereby giving you a hybrid SSD.\nIs there anything like NVELO Dataplex for OS X or should I just put OS X and applications on the SSD, and put home folders on the HDD using symbolic links?\n\nA: This is an old question, but for the benefit of anyone who comes across it: Apple introduced this capability under the name Fusion Drive in late 2012. Officially you can only get a Fusion Drive as a build-to-order option on a new Mac, but many people have reported success with configuring their own using the diskutil Terminal command in OS X 10.8.2 or later.\n\nA: I have been thinking the same since I learned about Nvelo Dataplex and recently I stumbled upon ssdcache\nIt looks like they are working on versions for Mac, Linux and Windows.\n", "Q: How to view a PDF at its original size?

The cable itself seems to be secure, and the problem persists even if I turn the screws on the connector to secure it to my laptop. As a result, my external monitor is basically unusable! Any ideas why this is happening and how I can fix it? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: The displays's physical connection is disconnecting and reconnecting causing the Mac to automatically detect settings from the display upon re-connecting, this seems to indicate a physical hardware issue. \nMonitor Cable:\nFirst  make sure the cable is securely attached to the monitor too.\nFailing that, I would try a different cable and see if the problem persists, there may be a short or continuity issue in the wires within the cabling. \nMonitor:\nAdditionally try a different monitor and see if the problem persists, it is entirely possible that the Monitor's internal electronics may be failing.\nThe MacBook Pro:\nIf the problem persists after trying another cable or monitor it may be an issue with the DVI port or even the connection of the DVI port to the motherboard on the MacBook Pro. \nIf you try gently applying very slight force to the cable end near the MacBook Pro while the monitor is connected in directions such as: up, down, left, right, etc and that causes a change in what your observing, the DVI port may be failing.  \n", "Q: Accessing wireless from my Macbook?

I turned it back on a couple of hours later. \n\nA: In general - drops will not find the sensitive places and unless you live in an area with salt spray saturating the air - it won't gather much salt and be corrosive before it dries.\nStatistically, there are only a few places where water will get wedged into a small crack (capillary action also can move a drop quite some distance from where it lands) and cause corrosion before it evaporates.\nYou did well to power it off. The only other thing would be to flip it upside down after closing a cloth between the keys and the screen.\nYou can edit your question to specify exactly where the liquid landed and what model (year and size) and I'll see if you need any more details in the answer.\nIn short - don't worry. Let the water dry, and use the Mac. Take it in to a genius bar or someone well used to repairing that mac. They will be able to educate you on the risks of using it (not much - and back up your data anyhow - something will eventually fail spills, accidents or perfect maintenance nonetheless).\n", "Q: How to get sound to headphones through my USB speakers vs. the internal speakers? I have AKG headphones with a USB or dual prong jack that I want to use with my MacBook Air. I can plug them into the USB port but how can I get the sound to come through the headphones instead of the laptop speaker?\n\nA: It sounds like you don't have your sound input configured correctly. Have you tried going into System Preference > Sound and changing the Output device?\n\nAnother (easier) option is to Option ⌥ -click the sound menulet in the menubar, which will bring up an Input/Output device selection menu (10.6 and later).\n\n\nA: Hold down the Option (alt) key and press the volume icon on the menu bar.  Then, under output device, find the headphones that you are plugging in and select them instead of the Air's speakers.  For reference, the integrated speakers are usually the first option.\n", "Q: does command-option-click on app icon in dock still hide all open windows? This apple article explains it.\nBut it no longer hides all open windows for me under 10.7.4. What could be causing this?\n\nA: Command-option-click does not hide all open windows. As stated in the linked Apple article, this command hides all other open items leaving the clicked item visible. It is possible to hide all other items and minimize your most recently item with command+option+h+m. This is a combination of command+option+h - Hide Others and command+option+m - Minimize.\n", "Q: Reserve a static IP address on an older Airport Extreme base station I'm trying to give my server a static IP address (it's connected directly to the base station) but it's an old base station, (Airport Extreme 802.11g) so there's no obvious way to reserve an IP address (equivalent to the DHCP Reservations panel on the more recent base stations.) For example, the information here is very clear, but my Airport Utility shows no such reservation panel.) Am I out of luck, or is there another way to do this?\n\nA: What you could try is set the DHCP range to start at +1 and manually set the IPs on your server. For example, set the DHCP range to be 10.0.1.3 to 10.0.1.200. The 10.0.1.2 IP will be free to be used by your server. In AirPort Utility for me this is at Network > Network Options.\n\n\nA: All AirPort base stations set up their internal NAT gateway code for a full /24 network (10.0.1.x by default). That means that IP addresses .2 through .254 are available for machines connected to the network. But all AirPort base stations configure their internal DHCP servers by default to only serve out addresses .2 through .200 via DHCP. This means that .201 through .254 are already set aside for manually/statically configured hosts.\nJust manually configure your server machine to be on one of those upper 54 addresses (.201 through .254) and it'll just work. Heck, even if you manually configured the host to use one of the addresses that the base station's DHCP server usually hands out, the base station will be smart enough not to try to serve out that address to some other client while your other machine is using it.\nThe UI you see on later base stations is a way to make the base station's built-in DHCP server give the same host the same IP address lease via DHCP each time, based on the host's MAC address. That's convenient if you have a laptop that you take to different networks all the time, and want to leave that laptop configured for DHCP. But if you have a machine that's going to be on your network all the time because it's a server, you can just configure that server machine's IP address manually, on the server.\nLetting other hosts on the Internet get to your server is a separate issue. For that, you have to set up Default Host (some other products call this \"DMZ\") or Port Mapping (a.k.a. Port Forwarding).\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Lion + lavalier mic records nothing How can I record audio using a lavalier mic and MacBook Pro OSX Lion?\n\n\nI have just opened my brand new Audio-Technica ATR-3350 Lavalier Omnidirectional Condenser Microphone. I tried to connect it to the jack just next to the earphones jack and record sound using quicktime player. \nRecording works well without a mic, but when I connect the mic and choose Built in input: line in instead of Built in Microphone: internal microphone, only silence is recorded.\nThe microphone was tested on a Windows 7 notebook, and it works well.\n\nA: The ATR3350 is not compatible with Macbook Pro. Nor is it compatible with iOS devices.\nIt's a turkey and I regret having bought it. The manufacturer is deliberately misleading people about this unit.\n\nA: ATR3350 is compatible with iOS devices.  I have it working on both my iphone6 and iPad Pro (9.5 inch).\nAt this time however it still does not work on my MacBook pro (13\" Retina 2015)\n\nA: macbook air needs a lavaliere plug that has 4 sections to the plug to override Mac's attempt to only allow mac products. An inexpensive lavaliere type will work with a 4 section inexpensive plug\n", "Q: OSX bluetooth private network between 2 macs Does anyone know how to create a private network over bluetooth that a couple of macs could use for screen sharing?  Our wifi router doesn't seem to like screen sharing (kicks us off after a few minutes and we need to get a new address - weird). We currently use firewire but would love a wireless solution.  Suggestions?  The docs on google are mostly about connecting to your phone. \nThanks\n\nA: Bluetooth is PAINFULLY SLOW… maybe 80-100 KB/s if you're lucky. It really isn't suitable for this sort of use.\nPerhaps you could create a network on a host machine, and use a client mac to connect to it for screen sharing. An ethernet connection to the host machine would also allow for internet sharing to both macs (since you'd no longer be connected to your router.)\n", "Q: No applications respond to trackpad clicks I had a application called Boxcryptor which recently threw some errors (version expired, upgrade, etc.) and left the system in a unusable state.\nMy MacBook running Lion no longer responds to mouse (trackpad) clicks on any windows. I am able to move the mouse pointer but clicking on any controls in application does not work. The window does not even register the click (doesn't even get focused).\nHowever, I am able to launch Terminal from Spotlight and managed to cleanly uninstall Boxcryptor using the provider Uninstall.Command.

I have this MacBook Pro (3,1). I know there are maximum temperatures at which the system will shut itself down in order to prevent damage. I know this because I have seen it happen a couple of times \nWhen I run Windows, apparently the OS doesn't care to throttle power in order to reduce dangerous heat like Mac OS X does. I now have a program that monitors CPU and GPU heat when I run Windows 7, and it will sound an alarm if they reach a pre-set ceiling.\nMy question is, how do I know what the emergency shutdown temperature is so I can set the alarm limit appropriately (low enough to trigger before catastrophe, but high enough that it doesn't trigger when things are still okay)?\nThis page from Intel seems to be telling me that the CPU should not go above 100°C ...does that seem like the number I'm looking for?\nNvidia doesn't seem to say anything about temperatures on the product page. User forums seem only to speculate on what is or isn't safe with no real specifications to back them up.\nHow can I find these numbers, either from Intel & Nvidia, or from Apple? Or, is there a general ceiling that I can go by to make sure my alarm warns me before an emergency shutdown?\n\nA: I have a pre-2009 Unibody MacBook Pro. My Mac went over 105°C and still worked. \nTyping was about 200% slower—around one word per minute—but I was playing a Flash-based game and have noticed the game raises the temperature to around 90°C in about 5 minutes of playing. \nSo I think the maximum temperature is around 110–120. Then it shuts off automatically.\n\nA: I frequently have my macbook around 80 degrees c (when rendering video), having a program like smcfancontrol can be used to manually raise the fan speed, and help lower CPU temperature in advance of a period of high CPU usage. I find that the shut off point of my macbook seems to be around 90 degrees\n\nA: I monitor my graphics card, CPU, and HDD temperatures and elevate the fan speeds (with SMC Fan Control) if one of them exceeds that.\n60 degC is (rough rule-of-thumb) the hottest temperature we can stand to touch, and in the absence of published specs, I arbitrarily took that as a conservative upper limit, assuming that materials can stand a higher temperature than I can.  While it may be unnecessarily conservative, it's not likely to have the consequences an insufficiently conservative limit would have.\n\nA: My 2010 Macbook Pro will go from 80 - 175 degrees if I use it for more then two hours and wont turn off. so I would geuss it shuts down at 200\n\nA: running handbrake makes my i7 cpu goes up to 94° per core but still works flawlessly  \n\n*\n*\n\n\nA: per apple it is this: \"Operating temperature: 50° to 95° F (10° to 35° C)\"\nthe info is here: http://support.apple.com/kb/SP13 scroll down to \"Electrical and environmental requirements\"\nThat's the outside temperature you should operate it at or use it, not the internal temperature.\n", "Q: How can I create a Saved Search that excludes a specific folder from the results? I'm trying to set up a Saved Search of my Mac that will exclude files in a folder called 'XYZ' from the search results. The reason is because I'm getting a ton of false positives from that folder that are difficult to sort through.\nJust to be clear, I know you can add folders to a \"Privacy\" list in the Spotlight preferences, but I don't want to add this folder to that list --because I don't want to exclude it from all future searches, just this specific saved search. Any idea how something like this could be done?\n\nA: I looked at some of the saved search files in Finder's application bundle, and for example /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Resources/MyLibraries/myDocuments.cannedSearch/search.savedSearch used a format like this for excluding directories:\n<key>FXScopeArrayOfPaths</key>\n<array>\n  <string>~/</string>\n  <string>-Library</string>\n  <string>-Music/iTunes</string>\n  <string>-Documents/Steam Content</string>\n  <string>~/Library/Mobile Documents/</string>\n  <string>-com~apple~Keynote</string>\n  <string>-com~apple~Pages</string>\n  <string>-com~apple~Numbers</string>\n</array>\n\nSo you can exclude subfolders by adding strings that start with a minus character after a full path. Something like -~/Library doesn't seem to work.\nYou can edit savedSearch files by dropping them on a text editor. RawQueryDict:SearchScopes and FXScope:FXScopeArrayOfPaths seem to list the same paths by default, but just editing the second one appeared to exclude folders at least in Finder.\n\nA: I want to add that if \"Document Container\" is not working for you (such as is my problem), you can set the Search Folder to opt in/out specific folders. \nPardon me, I do not have the \"reps\" to post images so I will do my best.  This is my first post so feel free to flame away.\nFor my music organization work-flow, I wanted the iTunes folder to hide erroneous sub-folders.  Of course, moving folders out of the iTunes folder was not an option since it would break/freak-out iTunes into re-creating those same folders.  Here is how I accomplished this by tweaking Lake's above method: \n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to iTunes folder, in Finder Menu > File > \"New Smart Folder\"\n\n*In initial search criteria select Kind > is > Folder\n\n*Following Lake's lead, in the drop-down created by holding option and (+), select Any of the following are true (this is for opting-in folders)  To opt-out folders as Lake mentioned above, change 'Any' to 'None'\n\n*Since I am \"Opting in\" folders I then nested 5 criteria underneath the Any option which looked like this (actual folder names are used for example):\n\n\n\nName is \"Automatically Add to iTunes\"\nName is \"Music\"\nName is \"MUSIC TO ADD - MAIN FOLDER\"\nName is \"TuneUp Results\"\nName is \"MusicBrainz Tagging\"\n\nSo the end result is that when I click on the Smart Search (located in the Finder sidebar for me) I will only see the 5 folders I want to without destroying the inherent folder layout of the main folder the reside in.\nI do hope this helps.\n\nA: If you hold option the (+) button to add a search criteria will become a (…) and an Any/All/None block. Set this to None.\nFor the criteria select Document Container. It won't be in the default list alongside Name, Kind, etc. Select Other… to select it from a list of additional criteria so long it has its own search feature:\n\nSet this to the name of the folder that you'd like to exclude using whatever is/contains/begins with/ends with you find suitable.\nThe end result should look something like this:\n\n\nA: Currently, I don't think this can be done. There appears to be quite a few people trying to do this that Google finds and nobody has a real answer (other than the Privacy exclusion) :(\n\nA: In the finder when you are searching for files, you can exclude them by adding minus in front of the criteria. For e.g. I want to search for all the files that is not pdf files, I can write \"Kind is -pdf\". This seems to work for me.\n\nA: I am pretty sure that I've found a different way to do this. \nIn configuring the smart folder, use a Raw Query search attribute. By default, this is not in the search attribute drop down menu, so you will need to find it by clicking Other at the bottom of the drop down menu. \nIn the input box next to Raw Query, type:\nkMDItemPath != \"/Users/yourname/Documents/foldertoexclude\" \n\nin which the text in quotation marks is the pathname of the folder to be excluded, which can be found via Get Info.\n\nA: Based on @Lri answer I wrote an Automator workflow with the apple script below. Not very subtle and still a lot to unfold (eg. relative paths to search folder) but it works as a basic concept.\nset savedSearch to path/to/.savedSearch\nset exPath to (POSIX path of ((choose folder with prompt \"Directory to exclude\") as alias)) as text\nset userPath to (POSIX path of (path to home folder as alias)) as text\nset xmlExclude to \"-\" & (characters 1 thru -2 of findAndReplaceInText(exPath, userPath, \"\"))\nset cmd to \"/usr/bin/plutil -insert SearchCriteria.FXScopeArrayOfPaths.1 -string \" & quoted form of xmlExclude & \" \" & quoted form of savedSearch\n\ndo shell script cmd\n\non findAndReplaceInText(theText, theSearchString, theReplacementString)\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to theSearchString\n    set theTextItems to every text item of theText\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to theReplacementString\n    set theText to theTextItems as string\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to \"\"\n    return theText\nend findAndReplaceInText\n\non split(theString, theDelimiter)\n    set oldDelimiters to AppleScript's text item delimiters\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to theDelimiter\n    set theArray to every text item of theString\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to oldDelimiters\n    return theArray\nend split\n\n\nA: I was too suffering the same problem, and found a way to do so.\nGo to Preference system > Spotlight > Select, then select \"Privacy\" tab, and you can add specific location(s) to exclude in Spotlight search. \nI've tried, it works.\n", "Q: How can I switch Dock configurations when an external display is connected? I have a MacBook Pro that I use in two different 'modes', mobile and desktop.\nMobile is for when I'm using just the MBP with the integrated trackpad, keyboard, and display.\nDesktop is for when I'm using it with external displays and an external keyboard and mouse, usually in clamshell mode.\nA couple of facts have led me to look for a way to configure a different Dock to appear in each mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*The resolution of the external displays is higher than that of the internal display, so I have more room for extra apps/folders/spacers in the Dock.\n\n*I generally use a different set of main apps in each mode.\n\n\nSo, is there a way to configure two different Docks in OS X and switch between them either automatically based on the presence of an external display or manually?\n\nA: DockSpaces is nice and convenient, but annoyingly unscriptable. So, I wrote two little shell scripts, one to change to my desktop Dock and one to change to my mobile Dock.\nThe desktop script is triggered on arrival in my Home context in ControlPlane, and the mobile script is triggered by departure from it.\nThe desktop context is defined based on the presence of my external displays:\n\nHere's how the scripts work:\nI save a copy of both Docks in my Documents folder (the Dock configuration is stored in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist).\nWhen I switch from one to the other, I replace the appropriate file in my Documents folder with the current file in my Preferences so that changes I've made to the Dock are saved. Then I copy the alternate Dock from my Documents to my Preferences. Finally, the Dock process is restarted so that the changes take effect.\nThe Scripts:\nTo Desktop:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncp ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist ~/Documents/Docks/mobile.plist\ncp ~/Documents/Docks/desktop.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist\nkillall Dock\n\nTo Mobile:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncp ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist ~/Documents/Docks/desktop.plist\ncp ~/Documents/Docks/mobile.plist ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist\nkillall Dock\n\n\nA: I found a manual solution, Dock Spaces.  It will cost you a little bit under $8, though.  Hopefully that's not an issue.\nAs for automating it, I'm not sure if it is scriptable or not, but it does not have automation like this built-in.\n\nA: DockSpaces is the answer to your question. DockSpaces allows you to create docks with  different applications in each dock. It does not have the automation built in, so I would recommend to you an application that you recommended to me, ControlPlane. You should be able to change docks based on the presence of an external display.\n", "Q: Cannot connect to iTunes Store in Mac OS X Lion without any error messages I can no longer connect to the iTunes Store on my Mac.\nMy iTunes is from 10.6.3 (now updated to 10.7.4).\nWhen I try to connect to the iTunes Store, the following error is occurring and indicating no access to the store.\n\nI have internet connection and I can also open websites in Safari, Chrome, Firefox.\n\nA: Since you haven't posted any specific troubleshooting steps taken the best course of action would be to use the help menu in iTunes and search for \"cannot connect to the iTunes store\". \nAlternatively, you can search http://apple.com/support under iTunes and see if you can find an article that might help you narrow down the causes of this problem. \n", "Q: How can I open an application when a secondary monitor is connected? I use SecondBar to add a menu bar to an external display. I've added it to my login items, but I don't want it to open when there isn't an external display.

Nothing I have tried gives me read/WRITE access to my SD card from my Canon camera. How can I secure-delete before selling the card on eBay? (the lock switch is on: unlocked - tried the other position too, just to make sure)\n\nA: If you can't erase the card from your camera does the camera at least recognize the card? Can you take a picture and have it saved to the card? If not the card may be damaged or your camera's card reader may be damaged.\nEither way, try putting the card in a card reader attached to your Mac's USB port (or if you have a later model MacBook Pro or iMac, in the computer's built in SD card reader) and see if the Mac recognizes it and mounts it on the desktop or in a Finder window. If it does, run Disk Utility and erase it there. Generally these cards are formatted MS-DOS (FAT) for use in Canon and other brand cameras and you can choose that format in Disk Tools.\nIf you want a more secure erase you can use Disk Utility \"Security Options...\" to accomplish that.\nIf you can accomplish this with your computer, put the card back in your camera to see if it is recognized. If it isn't there may be something going on with the card reader on your camera.\nJust to be thorough, what brand, size, and speed is this SD card? Some off-brand cards can develop issues like this (directory or database problems during a shoot, don't format correctly, etc.) and it's worth noting here that there are differences between brands of these cards. I've never had a problem with dozens of Sandisk, Lexar, or Kingston brand cards of all types: compact flash and SD of all types, sizes and speeds.\n\nA: If two cameras fail to erase the card, then something is almost certainly broken in the card.\nYou could simply put the lens cap on and take enough black pictures to fill up the card. That is equivalent to secure erase / one pass as the old data will be overwritten.\nOn the Mac side - your best bet would be to repartition the drive to APM or GUID so that the OS knows it can erase everything. Some filesystems the Mac doesn't \"support\" fully will be marked as read only.\n", "Q: How can I upgrade my PHP 5.3.1 to 5.3.2 on XAMPP Mac OS X? I've just installed XAMPP on Mac OS X Snow Leopard, and everything is running correctly and setup completely well.\nHowever, I want to install an open source project that requires PHP 5.3.2 or higher.

This is necessary because by XAMPP uses Apache version 2.2 and the files with the 2 prefix are built for Apache 2.0, so you must take the files build for the newer version (which has a different plugin interface) and rename them in the filenames XAMPP expects.\n", "Q: Reduce memory usage in OS X Lion I have a summer-2006 iMac with 2Gb memory.

Since I upgraded to Lion (though this was happening in 10.6 too), I sometimes have problems when I do 2 things simultaneously (web + Skype for instance) and fall into the karma wheel + swapping slowliness.\nMy question is the following: how could I just reduce memory usage simply as I do not need any eye candy transitions or such new features that may be consuming the memory I have. what are the obvious things to do to be on a memory diet? \n\nA: I doubt you have summer 2006 iMac. Those models are all Core Duo and don't support Lion. And by the way they don't support more than 2GB of RAM anyway.\nOnly thing you can do about memory usage is to turn any service in System Preferences that you don't need especially under Sharing tab and watch for autologin items in Accounts tab.\nAlso you may uninstall Adobe Flash to make browsing more responsive.

From my laptop it was simple to configure Time Machine to use that shared disk as the storage.  It created a sparesebundle and it's been happily backing up ever since.\nNow I have a new disk to use.  So I removed the old one and installed the new one and prepared for that initial very large backup over the network.  However, it would appear that there's no option to use this shared disk for backup purposes.\nWhen I enter Time Machine preferences and opt to select a disk, there are no disks listed:\n\nEven though there are actually two network drives (and the local drive) mounted:\n\nIn this case, \"Backup\" is the drive shared from the Airport Extreme.\nIf I opt to \"Set Up Other Time Capsule\" it takes me to the Airport Utility (6.1) in which I find no options mentioning any kind of Time Capsule setup.  It lets me share or un-share the disk, that's about all I can find.  \nI also tried downloading Airport Utility 5.6 to see if the older interface had some familiarity for me to set up the disk for Time Machine, but again all I seem to be able to do is share or un-share it.  I can't seem to tweak anything that would result in the Time Machine Preferences actually seeing the target disk.\nHas anybody run into this issue before?  Is there something simple that I'm overlooking?  The driving factor in getting a new disk was to increase the size so that I could use the same disk for automated backups from my Linux box (which would mount the share and run some simple cron jobs using tar for incremental backups), which mounts the share just fine (the last mount point in the list):\n\nUltimately, how can I use a disk shared from my Airport Extreme as a storage target for Time Machine in OS X 10.7?\nEdit:  To add some clarity, the hard drive in question was formatted on my Mac.  It was given a single partition and formatted as \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" and is 3 TB in capacity.\nI've searched around on the internet and people who are experiencing the same symptoms all seem to be using some off-the-shelf NAS.  The general theme is that the firmware for each such NAS needs to be upgraded to support updated protocols.  However, the controlling device in this case is an Airport Extreme which, to my knowledge, is fully up to date.  So I can't imagine why anything would be unsupported in this case.\nI was previously using the same setup with just a different external hard drive.  That worked fine.  Time Machine could mount the drive and perform the backups all by itself.  All I did was swap out the drive with a new one, and now Time Machine can't use it.\nI've also just noticed that when Time Machine tries to start a backup, the \"Name\" of the target device get appended with a number.  It started with \"-1\" and then I tried to de-select and re-select the target disk, not it has a \"-2\":\n\nUpdate: Just to test, I've removed the drive from the Airport Extreme and plugged it directly into my MacBook Pro, and it's currently in the process of backing up without problem.  I'll try re-adding it to the Airport Extreme after and see if perhaps it can back up (maybe the problem was in the creation of the sparsebundle on the file system? it's worth testing).\n\nA: Try using the following Terminal command then restarting System Preferences (if it's open):\ndefaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1\n\n\nA: I knew it was going to end up being something simple that I was just overlooking...\nAs I Googled around more, some of the information I found contained images of the icons for the mounted drives.  This turned out to be my biggest clue.  Notice the drive as I had mounted it:\n\nAs it turns out, this is mounted and an SMB share.  Easy enough to overlook, since all of my other network stuff is SMB.  (I mainly use my Linux server for central file storage and share it with Mac and Windows clients, so SMB is the most universal.)  However, Time Machine doesn't like SMB.  I must have not even paid attention to the difference years ago when I first set it up.  But by mounting it as an AFP share:\n\nI was able to see it in Time Machine (even after reverting to show only supported targets) and am currently backing up to it.\n\nA: I know it's a really old question, but there are some that still use Airport Extremes for Time machine and they may face the same issue as I did today. Mac osx 10.14.5 and Airport Utility 6.3.9.\nI changed the airport-time machine drive today and I had the identical issue as the OP. \nBut for me the issue was because the Shared Disk was secured by password, so it was unaccessible by Time machine app. All I had to do was to go in Finder, Connect to the Airport base and unlock the HDD (a popup asking me for password was prompted).\n", "Q: Time Machine performing a mobile Backup to a location I can't find anywhere First of all:\nI'm running OS X Lion 10.7.4 on a recent MacBook Pro, have a local USB hard drive (1TB) Time Machine is configured to use for backups – this works perfectly fine.\nAdditionaly, I once tried to setup a network share to use for mobile backups so I wouldn't have to plug the USB drive in to have a backup ready. I setup Netatalk on my Ubuntu machine which works as some sort of NAS in my local network, chose a Folder I setup on a 750GB disk, tried to use it as a Time Capsule on my MacBook but it would not work, so I reverted to using the USB disk instead since I did not have the time to figure out what went wrong.\nNow, when I go to /Volumes on my MacBook, I see a Time Machine configured Drive named MobileBackups, the name I chose for the experimental Time Machine Volume. I can enter the folder and browse the backups, they are updated every few minutes and seem to be working perfectly fine. I can even start Time Machine with the USB backup drive not plugged in and can see previous file versions.\nThe MobileBackups drive is said to be 749,3 GB in size, the exact size of my MacBook Pro HDD and the size of the network shared HDD I tried to setup as mobile backup volume.\nBut when I access said network shared volume, there is no indication of my Time Machine backup. I accessed it via ssh on my Ubuntu box which it is connected to and ran ls -la on the location I setup as Time Machine backup folder, I ran du | sort in the root of the volume, but still I couldn't find the Time Machine Backup.\nSince my MacBook Pro HDD contains already about 300GB of data, I would expect to easily find a complete Time Machine backup of that, but as I was saying… I have no idea where it is located.\nI even ran GrandPerspective on the MacBook just in case I screwed something up and Time Machine is performing a full backup to a folder on the same drive, but that doesn't seem to be the case either.\nSo… either I have generated vacuum disk space out of nowhere, or I am incredibly stupid.\nPS: When I access my Time Machine backup, it says it's inactive since my USB backup drive is not connected, yet the MobileBackups folder is still being updated.\nThis confuses me the most.\n\nA: The folder you're seeing has nothing to do with the network volume you created; it just happens to have the same name. This is a new feature in Lion which keeps track of file changes on laptops when you're away from home so that you still get the benefit of file versioning that Time Machine provides even when your external backup drive is not connected.\nYou can find more information about this feature in John Siracusa's Lion review at Ars: http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7/18/\n", "Q: Charging my Macbook with power inverter I bought a MotoMaster Eliminator Mobile Power Outlet Digital Power Inverter rated for 400 W.\nIt has thoses specs:\n\nAC output voltage: 115 V\n  Max Continuous AC power: 320 W\n  AC Output frequency: 60 ±1 Hz\n  AC Output waveform wave: Modified Sine Wave\n\nI can plug my little iPhone adapter in the inverter AC outlet and it charges.\nWhen I plug my MacBook's adapter, I hear little ticks from the adapter, and nothing happens. I unplug it from the inverter, plug it in the wall outlet, and nothing happens. I have to unplug it from the wall, wait a minute or two, re-plug it to the wall and my MacBook is charging again.\nWhat's happening? I bought this specially to charge my laptop when doing camping. Is there something I can do?\n\nA: The problem lies in one little word: Modified sine wave. Which typically has a rather tenuous connection with an actual sine wave. Rather, its voltage is a periodic step function with rather few steps (though I can't say for sure about the specific model you mention). You need an inverter that provides the latter. They exist, but tend to be more expensive. I use one made by Mascot, and it charges my macbooks just fine. My previous inverter, with its modified sine wave, did not.\n", "Q: Can .zip folders created using Windows XP Pro be opened and extracted on Mac without any additional software? I am a Windows user, and I would like to send a compressed archive/folder to my colleague who is a Mac user. I do not want him to have to download any additional software to open and extract it. \nCan .zip files created using Windows XP Pro be opened and extracted on Mac without any additional software?  Is the file specification the same in Mac as it is in Windows?\n\nA: Yes.\nThe PKZIP format used by Windows is understood by OS X and has been this way since about 10.3. The tool used to extract the contents is called Archive Utility and it is installed by default with every OS X installation.\nYour Mac-using friend can either double-click on the archive in Finder to extract it or he can right-click/control-click and select the 'Open' option from the list of actions.\n\nA: And you can go the other way as well.  Select an item or folder and hit Compress under File in Finder.  It will make a compatible .zip file you can send to a Windows user.\n\nA: Yes, OS X can natively extract .zip files. You should be fine sending it.\n", "Q: Is there any way to set Gmail app as the default mail client in iPhone and iPad? I want to be able to one-click email links from apps such as Twitter, Safari and Instapaper. Is this possible if I'm using Gmail and not Apple's Mail app?\nDo I have to set Gmail as the default mail client? Is this possible?\n\nA: This is not possible on iOS 13 and lower. (Or iPadOS 13 or lower)\nIn order to utilize email functionalities from within apps, you will have to enable the Apple Mail app. I recommend turning off all notifications for Mail if you want to use the Gmail app as your primary iPhone mail client.\n\nA: It works if you are using the Gmail app and Chrome browser (i.e. when clicking on the mail icon in a NY Times story you are browsing in Chrome), but I don't think you can enable it by default in other apps.\n\nA: To give a very short answer: No, this is not possible.\n\nA: I just added outlook to the apps when sending from Safari and it now appears as an option. Not quite default but good enough\n\nA: I do have a jailbroken iPhone 4s and unfortunately I cannot find any app to add this much desired functionality in any Cydia repository.\nSo at the moment I'd say it is not possible.\n\nA: This is a nice workaround, it may be a good solution:\nCan I use gmail as default client for sharing photos from camera roll or links from safari?\n", "Q: Which video/movie file format would be most convenient for inclusion into a Keynote or PowerPoint presentation?

The yellow sign informs you that the System cant find that item any more, as it no longer exists.\nJust select it and click the minus sing above to get rid of it. \nEDIT:  Apparently someone with the same issue found a workaround. Creating a new user an pointing it to the same home directory allowed him to delete the login item. \nTo do so just go create a New User, and Right Clicking on it, select Advance Options. A new window will prompt, were you'll be able to change your Home Directory. Here you can find some more detailed information.\nI'll try to find a not so tricky way, though. \n\nA: Try Looking in the folder:\nSystem/Library/Extensions \n\nSearch for anything that has the \"Blackberry\" or \"RIM\" name in the extension (with .kext at the end of the file) and move it out of the folder.

In any case windows explorer has it listed as a drive now. It says I need to reformat the drive before I can use it. This is windows explorer reformat, not iTunes reformat. Should I?\niTunes still doesn't give me any indication that it sees the drive.\n\nA: If the iPod is makes horrible drive noises, then you have most likely lost the hard drive in the iPod. It might have crashed in the middle of the format and caused a crash.\nYou can try the disk mode to see if you can do anything with it, but sounds like it might be a dead drive.\n\nA: Have you tried putting the iPod into disk mode?\n", "Q: How can I remove Tapjoy's signing certificate?

A menu pops up. Select \"Download Linked File as...\"\n\nA: As has been noted by others, the accepted answer that modifies the Safari plist does not work as of Sierra (Safari 10+?).\nThe method I used (on High Sierra) was to navigate to /Library/Internet\\ Plug-Ins/ (terminal or via Go in finder). There were two plugins AdobePDFViewer.plugin and AdobePDFViewerNPAPI.plugin. I moved both of these to the /Library/Internet\\ Plug-Ins/Disabled\\ Plug-Ins directory.

Instead of renaming files, you should be able to correct this consistent metadata.\nAs long as the files are named with the same Album, and the track/disc numbers are laid out accordingly, the files will be played in order.\nConsider the following:\n\nAs you can see, I have one album in perfect track order, and a recently added Audiobook in total disarray.\nScrew renaming files! iTunes does that for you anyway. Mass-edit all the consistent tags first.\n\nGrouping them by total number of tracks, disc, album, and artist, will organize them all into their own section initially. After doing so it's a simple matter of clicking on a single track, entering it's specific track number, and clicking next.\nThe coolest part of this process it that iTunes will maintain focus in the metadata field you select, so once you have everything else out of the way, simply leave the mouse cursor on the 'Next' button, type a track number which you should be able to get from the track name, then tap on the mouse button without moving it.\nTwo minutes later, you have consistent metadata:\n\n", "Q: Kernel panic after using Android Emulator for Mac OS X Lion I experienced a kernel panic.\n\n\n*\n\n*When I run Android emulator on a MacBook, iMac, or Mac mini, I sometimes get a grey screen for unexpected shut down and instructions to press and hold the power button to restart the Mac.\n\n*After I upgraded to OS X Lion, only this grey screen came; it was working fine when I had Snow Leopard.\n\n*When I update software, the issue disappears for week or month but then it starts happening again.\nDo I need to do something special to prevent these unexpected shut downs? \nShould I downgrade it to Snow Leopard? \nOr is it coming because I'd upgraded the same Lion install on 3 Macs?

If you scroll down past all of the \"Me Too's,\" you'll actually find useful information; there appears to be a workaround involving /Applications/Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/eclipse.ini for some.\n\nI increased the heap space used by Eclipse, and haven't experienced this problem since.\nIn eclipse.ini I used the following values:\n--launcher.XXMaxPermSize256m\n\n-Xms256m\n\n-Xmx1024m\n\n\nThe same issue has a duplicate. In this thread, they mentioned a slightly different method where they added -vmargs between --launcher.XXMaxPermSize256m and -Xms256m \nAnd I assume you've installed Intel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager, as this is a requirement for  the Android Emulator.  However, in the comments, people note that it doesn't work with Mountain Lion and they had to disable it for Android Emulator to work.\nFor your question about the number of installs Lion from the App Store will give you, this is directly from Apple's EULA (emphasis added):\n\n(i) to download, install, use and run for personal, non-commercial\n  use, one (1) copy of the Apple  Software directly on each\n  Apple-branded computer running Mac OS X Snow Leopard or Mac OS X  Snow\n  Leopard Server (“Mac Computer”) that you own or control;\n\nSo, assuming that this is for personal, non-commercial use, Apple lets you install Lion as many times as you like on the Macs that you own or control.\n", "Q: How do I transfer my iOS developer profile to another computer?

If an iPad is connected to a PC, then in My Computer, there is a iPad device containing a folder with all photos and videos.\nBut on a Mac with Lion, this won't happen...

It is much more lightweight than iPhoto and is for downloading images and videos from digital cameras, which the iPad technically is as well.\n\nA: Very Simple! use Disk Aid and transfer the video to your mac \nHope this helps :-)\n\nA: You can use an app called iExplorer to view the photos and videos on your Mac without using iTunes. There may be other methods involving the terminal, but to my knowledge, there's no way to avoid using a third-party product.\n\nA: If you have iPhoto, once you connect your iPad and open iPhoto, it should detect all photos on the iPad and will allow you to sync / transfer them to your computer. \nYou can get iPhoto to transfer the iPad photos to a folder you create, and you will be able to see all the images there.

On my iPad, there are many apps that I owned once, didn't enjoy much, and then deleted.\nHowever, if I go to iTunes and then open up the section pertaining to my iPad, I still see these many old apps listed (just that their check-boxes are unchecked, symbolizing that they are not copied over onto the iPad.)\nI would like to totally delete these from the iTunes world too. Partially because I did a sync today which caused them to awake from the dead and get re-synced to my computer... and partly just out of a sense of completeness and health.\nNOTES: I have tried to click one of the unwelcome apps and then go to the Edit menu and choose Delete.  But Delete is greyed out! even though that app's checkbox is unchecked. ALSO, note, I have my iPad synced to the computer via WiFi -- I can't imagine that causes the problem?\nWhat is the official, graceful, good way to fully delete these apps so they don't exist, even in ghost form?\n\nA: In iTunes in the left hand sidebar go to Apps into the Library selection.

So I got my first Apple laptop, a Retina MacBook Pro.\nI heard that its best to let the laptop discharge until 0% in order to restart the battery cycle or something like that.

Most of my work-related mail goes through a ticketing system. Whenever a customer or me or any of my colleagues sends a mail or replies to a mail, the ticketing system sends a copy of said message to my inbox.\nWhen 'threading' or 'sort on conversation' was on in Snow Leopard's Mail.app, it used to group all mail with the same subject. This way I could easily spot when a ticket was not yet replied to be my or one of my colleagues.\nLion's mail.app seems to behave differently and seems to sort mail by Sender rather than Subject. Does anyone know of a way to make Lion sort conversations by subject rather than sender?\nRight now it's very annoying:\n\nYou would expect all mails with subject test to be grouped together, but they aren't. I would expect that it respects the \"In-Reply-To\" header.\nThese are the relevant headers of the first mail with subject [#VZB-74211-323] test:\nMessage-Id: <DDEF4B55C73B450B8E5F90B15A4FC117@banteng.be>\n\nSecond mail:\nMessage-Id: <1342771382.500910b676bc9@cerb5.openminds.be>\nIn-Reply-To: <DDEF4B55C73B450B8E5F90B15A4FC117@banteng.be>\n\nthird:\nMessage-Id: <1342771377.500910b107688@cerb5.openminds.be>\nIn-Reply-To: <DDEF4B55C73B450B8E5F90B15A4FC117@banteng.be>\n\nfourth:\nMessage-Id: <003CDBAA3CF04F8D8947DE9294E0E314@banteng.be>\nIn-Reply-To: <1342771382.500910b66b047@cerb5.openminds.be>\n\nSurely there MUST be a hack somewhere or some plist to edit to fix this?\n\nA: Ah!  I think I have actually found the answer.  In the Mail.app with Lion, it sorts by whether or not there is a Re: in the subject.

I've searched around for an answer to this, but I can't seem to find it. Perhaps someone here can help?\nI've created several M4V files through Handbrake from a DVD I own, and added them to iTunes. The episodes of the TV show appear OK, but the soft-coded subtitles I selected in Handbrake don't appear as an option when playing the episode on my iPad. But, if I open these same M4V files through VLC Player, the subtitles are there, and can be turned on and off.\nIf they're in the M4V file, why can't I enable these subtitles on my iPad? :(\n\nA: As you discovered, DVDs often store subtitles in the VobSub format, which are images, not text. QuickTime and the iOS Video app only handle SRT/3GPP format text subtitles.\nUsing the very handy (and free) Subler, VobSubs can be converted to SRT subtitles and packaged in an MP4/M4V. It does this using OCR, but I've found the results to be quite accurate, since the source material is pretty clean.\nIf you need support for non-english subtitles, you need to go here and download the proper Tesseract language file, unzip it (so you have a .traineddata file), and place it in the Contents/Resources/tessdata folder in the Subler.app bundle.\nConverting from VobSub to SRT with Subler\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Subler, and create a new file.\n\n*Import your existing MP4/M4V (or MKV) file (File → Import → File…).\n\n*The import settings should be automatically set up properly, but make sure that the subtitle track's action is set to 3GPP Text, not Passthru.\n\n*\n\n*Other tracks should be set to Passthru, unless you have audio in a format the MP4 container doesn't support (but this should have been taken care of by Handbrake).\n\n\n*Click Add.\n\n*Optional: Click on the subtitle track and change the Forced setting to All Samples Are Forced, if you need forced subtitles (i.e. always on, for foreign languages).\n\n*Optional: Add any metadata you might want. Subler has a nice auto-search option (File → Import → Search Metadata Online…).\n\n*Save the file. This should be relatively quick, since it's not transcoding any of the video or audio.\n\n\nA: After doing more research, it appears that the following is true:\nThere are three types of subtitles: \n\n\n*\n\n*Closed Captions \n\n*Vobsub\n\n*SRT (external file)\n\n\nBasically, according to this post on the Handbrake forums, only Closed Captions can be used to reliably \"soft code\" subtitles into M4V files for use on iOS devices. (\"Soft code\" meaning the subtitles can be turned off and on.)\nYou can only \"hard code\" (aka \"burn in\") Vobsub subtitles (I think they're actually images), and SRT files can often corrupt, meaning you only get part of a sentence. \nSlightly annoying, but good to know: Go with Closed Captions when you can.\nUnfortunately that also means that if you don't have CC (or an SRT file) then your iPad will not let you enable subtitles -- even if they're there -- as it doesn't support Vobsub.\n\nA: I would not group SCC Closed Captions with Soft Subtitles. They are very different from one another. \nSCC Closed Captions are a binary format that can only be installed at encode time.\nMake a mistake and you'll have to re-encode the entire video file.  Most soft subtitle tracks, OTOH, are text files, the simplest being SRT (SubRip).\nThere are many places on the Internet where you can obtain the SRT files for popular movies and TV shows.  \nYou'll see this referred to as \"fan-subbing.\"  If you want/need to create your own SRT files, Jubler is a good, free choice.\nQuickTime also supports SCC Closed Captions but you'll need to use Composer ($50) to install them. \nFor my purposes, I favor SRT/3GPP soft subtitles over SCC Closed Captions because soft subtitles look better and are much more flexible.\n\nA: Go back to version 9.  There is no other solution for a certain type of problem. Starting with Version 10 and carrying on with 11 and 12 (the current version only recently released) all refuse to honour soft subs that were previously compatible. This type of sub is present in the m4v file on your computer but is actually stripped by itunes from the file when transferred to your ipod. That's really important so I'm going to repeat it in caps:\nItunes versions 10 through 12 (and this has been happening for years so future versions will probably do the same) STRIP THE VALID TX3G TEXT STREAM FROM THE FILE WHEN SYNCING SO THERE ARE NO SUBTITLES PRESENT ON YOUR IPOD.\nI have done this with numerous video files though on a limited number of devices (mainly classics and nanos)  and it is possible that newer devices do not experience the same stripping. \nMethod to confirm this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Confirm via a suitable program like MediaInfo that the soft subbed file has soft subs compatible with ipod. There will be a text stream called something Timed Text in TX3G format. The very useful Handbrake encoder will convert external SRT and some muxed subs to TX3G subs automatically if requested. For a one hour video the size of the text stream shouldn't be much bigger than 200 kiB and could easily be smaller. If it's VobSub or several megabytes in size then you're dealing with a bitmap sub which as explained above won't show on an ipod.\n\n*Sync this file to your ipod with your current version of itunes.\n\n*Using finder/explorer navigate to the video file on your ipod. I like to find the video size on the hard drive then search by file size in the music folder (even though it's a video it's in the music folder) in ipod_control folder of the ipod.\n\n*Check the file on ipod with your media info program. If using version 10 or later there will be no text stream present; using version 9 the same stream found previously will still be present.\n\n*Remove/mark as watched/uncheck the video in itunes it and resync so that the file is removed from your ipod. (If you don't remove it then you won't see any changes in step 7 since the file won't have been transferred by a different version of itunes.)\n\n*BACKUP your itunes library. Later versions of library are 100% incompatible with earlier versions.\n\n*Roll back or \"upgrade\" itunes and repeat the process with the same video file to get the opposite result.\n\n*Reinstall your preferred version and restore backed up library if necessary.\nIn older versions of itunes I've also seen the problem that the ipod will display subs during the wrong video, that is, the text stream looks as if it has been transferred to the wrong file. I thought of this confirming method too late to check that a file that should have a sub doesn't at the same time that one that shouldn't have one does have one.\n", "Q: Sending Pictures from iPhone - Orientation is Wrong I have an iPhone 4. I take a picture, send it to a friend, and regardless of how I sent the photo...the size I send, the orientation of the camera when I shoot the photo... most of my photos arrive to the friend's email upside down or sideways. \nAny clues from you folks? \nUPDATE:\nThis appears to actually be a bug in iOS5. Here is a thread I discovered with others having the same issue. I particularly like this guys solution and would love to see Apple implement something similar: \n\nWhat I think Apple should do is add a camera settings feature to the settings tab that allows for two new options. Option one would be \"camera frame orientation always up\". This would mean that no matter how you hold the camera, up is always up on the photo or video. Option two would be \"camera frame orientation fixed\". A sub option here would allow the user to select either portrait or landscape (with home button on the right) as the default \"up\" orientation. That would allow those rare two or three people in the universe who really do want to take upside down or sideways photos to do so. The \"always up\" option would allow the rest of us to take photos without having to worry that they will come out jacked up. In any case, I sure hope Apple is reading its support blogs...seems like there are enough of us out there who are having this photo issue to merit a fix in a not-too-distant future iOS update.\n\n\nA: The iPhone takes photos in whatever the orientation of the sensor is then uses EXIF data to instruct proper rotation.\nYour friend's e-mail is ignoring (or stripping) the EXIF data. There's no way to fix it on your side.\n\nA: iOS strips out the metadata information when sending the picture via the web. The information is present if the picture is downloaded from the phone onto a computer directly.\nThis means that if you transfer the picture off the phone using any of the following methods, it will not have the metadata information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upload it to a website using HTML5 file input control.\n\n*Send it to someone via e-mail using the built-in Mail client.\n\n*Upload it to Dropbox, Facebook, etc.\n\n\nAll of the above methods will cause the photo to lack metadata information.\nThe only way to retain the metadata information is if you attach your iPhone or iPad to a Mac or a PC and transfer the picture to it first, and then send it to whoever you want to send it to.\n\nA: More information is needed. Does he have an iPhone also? Is this the only friend that it is happening to? Does the friend get photos like this from other people?\nI don't know if it's been fixed or not, but there is/was a bug where landscape photos that were taken with the volume buttons facing up would be displayed incorrectly on Windows machines. If your friend does not have an iPhone, maybe this is the cause of the problem.\n\nA: It seems as though no matter how you hold the camera during a picture, iOS  will record the orientation as landscape, shutter button to the right. Thus, when sending via email the picture will carry that orientation with it despite how you may have held the camera when taking the picture. Thus, it can come across miss-oriented in an email. I just make a point to take most shots with the orientation iOS likes: landscape with the shutter button to the right.  \n", "Q: Can't create alias for 'nano ~/.bash_profile' I tried to make an alias to edit my bash profile, but when I save and relaunch a new window, I get the following:\nLast login: Sun Jul 22 12:00:25 on ttys001\n-bash: alias: nano ~/.bash_profile: not found\nAdams-MacBook-Pro:~ adam$\n\n### manually reopen a new terminal\n\nAdams-MacBook-Pro:~ adam$ ebp\nAdams-MacBook-Pro:~ adam$  \n\nMy .bash_profile looks like :\n# edit bash profile\nalias ebp= 'nano ~/.bash_profile'\n# alias rbp= 'source .bash_profile'\n\nAlso fwiw, my other aliases work fine.

I found that a lot of accessories I had used with my iPod Nano and 3GS don't work with my friends 4's and 4s'. \nIs the accessory one of those FM transmitters, or a direct cable link to the stereo? If it is the latter, and the radio has an 'Aux in,' you can connect up a jack to jack cable from the headphone port to your stereo. If it is the former, you may have to buy a new unit, as newer Apple devices are just not compatible with some accessories unfortunately! Griffin make a good one I believe. \nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Run a command before launching an app I have a particular app that uses its own Ad Library aside from iAd. If I remove the correct folder prior to launching the app, No ads will be shown during that session. However, upon closing and relaunching the app, the folder is recreated and ads are shown.

As such, my question is this:\nCan I make my jailbroken iOS device run a command (in this case, rm -rf bla/bla/bla) and then launch an app, all from the touch of a homescreen icon?\n\nA: You can replace the binary of the app with a .sh script. Pretend your app's binary is named App; rename it to something else like App.real, and then make an .sh script that's simply called App. Not App.sh, just App without any extension. Put your command in the .sh script, and then on the last line of the script, call ./App.real.\nEdit: I tested this, but I never seemed to be able to make it do what I wanted.

I'm trying to get my Mac to boot from a USB flash drive. I know the drive works and is bootable, because it works with my friend's Windows PC.\nSpecifically, I was running Windows 7 on my Mac to create the bootable disk, which has Windows Defender Offline on it. I have had the same issue trying to use the Ultimate Boot CD on a USB, various Live USBs for Linux, etc.\nSo, what do I have to do to get my Mac to recognize and boot from another OS on a USB flash drive?\nOr maybe a better question, if there isn't a simple answer, would be what does Bootcamp do to allow booting from a Windows install DVD or to allow Windows, once installed, to boot?\nEDIT: I was able to sort of get results using the bless command in Terminal. Specifically, I used \n\nsudo bless -mount \"/Volumes/WDO_Media32/\" -legacy -setBoot -nextonly\nand then did a restart. Boot was slower, but then I was presented with the normal log-in screen. The log in screen, though, was much slower than usual, as if something else was happening in the background. So, I seem to be effecting something with that command, but I still can't boot from my Windows bootable USB drive.\n\nA: Boot Camp has to emulate a BIOS system, as Windows requires this to run.  Apple uses something called the bless tool in order to instruct EFI (which Macs are based on) to activate this BIOS system.\nHowever, if I recall correctly, emulation of BIOS is not supported on Mac for any device that is not attached via a SATA connection (ie. internal drive, DVD drive).  So, I believe that you cannot boot from your USB key.\nIf you want, you could install an alternative bootloader on your Mac that would allow you to do this.  See this post for more info.\n\nA: You can in fact boot Windows from a USB drive on a Mac.\nI've done this recently with the Windows 10 Technical Preview, but the software I used should work with Windows 7+, but it does have a disclaimer that says Windows 7 does not support USB 3.0, so if you're trying this on a newer Mac, you'd have to use Windows 8 or higher.\nI'm booting Windows 10 off of an external USB to SATA hard drive dock. It takes a while for Windows to boot, but it runs okay once it's started. I imagine it'd be much faster if I was running USB 3.0.\nI needed another Windows computer to run the utility called \"WinToUSB\" here is a link to their site: http://www.easyuefi.com/wintousb/\nYou will need a Windows installer disk or ISO image to create the bootable image.\nDo NOT attempt to create or format any of your Mac partitions from within Windows because there is a very high chance you will lose some/all of your Mac data.\n\nA: I ran into this issue a while back when I wanted to run Windows off and EHD so it wouldn't take up any space on my Macbook's HD.\nThe issue you are running into is that you need to setup an EFI boot in order to be able to boot and run Windows off a USB drive.\nI used this tutorial to do it myself: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7587958\nYou'll need a computer running Windows to do this entire process.

Is there a service to check which app have security updates ready to be downloaded? Opening each one on Fridays for a routine check sounds inefficient. For MacPorts, there is a script but I have stuff that comes from other sources too. Is this an unreasonable expectation to have? It seems technically feasible just to maintain a DB and query it with a list of package/version, package/version... getting back a list of update/version/url, update/version/url...\n\nA: Edit: Better Option\nI found AppFresh, which seems to do exactly what you're looking for, using a bunch of different sources, including Apple Update, Sparkle (which a lot of 3rd party apps use to push updates), Microsoft Updates and more. It also has the option of installing the updates right from the app.\n\nOriginal Answer\nMacUpdate offers RSS feeds of updates to all the software it tracks. You could use that, with something to filter for items matching software you have installed (Yahoo Pipes) might be useful for that) to give you a list of updates to any of your apps.\nIt's probably not a comprehensive solution depending on the obscurity of some of your apps, but it's probably the closest you'll get to a single source.\nThe other alternative might be creating a script that periodically checks provided URLs for all your software for any changes, then notifies you in some way.\n", "Q: Is there an iPhone app that takes continuous photos?

I had a Smart Search for my Photo Stream files located at ~/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets/sub/, searching for JPG and PNG files. I found that not all files were showing up. So I went looking for them myself and was able to locate them.\n\nHow does this make sense? Why doesn't finder see the same results? The list of files was achieved using the find command at the prompt. I then passed a simple find result to wc to get the count, 153 files found via find in Terminal but only 75 in Finder using Spotlight? What's the deal?\n\nA: It might be necessary to rebuild the Spotlight database by running\nsudo mdutil -E /\n\nand waiting a few hours. I had the same issue in the past and rebuilding the index resolved it.\n\nA: I have this all the time...\nManual search or saved search shows:\n\n\n*\n\n*IMG_4668.JPG\n\n*IMG_4663.JPG\n\n*IMG_4662.JPG\n\n*IMG_4661.JPG\n\n\nand in the /assets/sub folder I see all the files. (including IMG_4664/5/6/7.JPG etc)\nAfter running the following command everything is fine but it will take only a week or so before it's messed up again. \nsudo mdutil -E /\n\nSame applies to the ~/Library/Mobile Documents/ folder. \nMultiple tests on other folders are succesfull. Just not the results for these 2 folders that both happen (?) to be under ~/Library/ \nOld Macbook and my new (freshly installed) Macbook: same issue\n\nA: I'm not exactly clear on what you mean by \"Smart Search\". I'm assuming you're referring to a \"Smart Folder\", which allows you to specify and save Spotlight search criteria? \nIn Lion a Smart Folder with saved Spotlight criteria will show up in Finder as a folder with a gear icon. Smart Folders show up in ~/Library/Saved Searches/ with an extension of .savedSearch, which are actually preference lists holding aliases that create a virtual folder.\nLooking at your screen capture it doesn't appear you're using a Smart Folder. Another observation is that your Finder search shows the files in the sub directory, where in Terminal you are drilling further down. Since it appears to be a standard Spotlight search it makes perfect sense why you're not seeing the same results in Finder and Terminal. \nBy default Spotlight does not index or search System folders, which includes the Library folder that you're searching. To resolve the inconsistency here's what you need to do:\nIn Finder navigate to:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets/sub/\n\n*In the sub window click inside the search box and hit option return\n\n*Search: This Mac | sub should appear just below\n\n*Click sub and then + on the right side\n\n*From the dropdown menu that appears select Kind is Image All\n\n*Click the save button on the right and name it.\n\n\nIf you still aren't getting the same search results vs. Terminal then look through the search criteria options (+) to make adjustments. Hopefully this helped you, and/or anyone else that needs to setup a \"smart search\".\n\nA: This is what worked for me:\nGo into System Preferences > Spotlight \"Privacy\" tab. Press the \"+\" button at the bottom and add the volume you are trying to search. This will remove the volume from search results. Then click the \"-\" button to remove the volume you just added. This will reindex the volume that is having problems. \nTry your search again. If you're in the same situation I was in, this should work.\n\nA: I have been searching long and hard to fix the same issue with Finder showing no results when doing a simple search. I came across this solution that seem to have worked effectively and have now cured my aging frustration. I am using OS X Yosemite and from my research it seems multiple OS X releases and a large number of people were having this exact issue.\nThe solution is below:-\n\n*\n\n*Open a new Finder window\n\n*Navigate to your \"Library\" folder\n\n*\n\n*How: Command-Shift-L or in Go menu, choose Library.\n\n\n\n*Open the \"Preferences\" folder\n\n*Locate the \"com.apple.finder.plist\" file and move it to Trash (i.e. delete it)\n\n*From the Apple menu in top left corner, select Log Out (Or do a Restart)\n\n*Log back in to your user account\n\n*Open a new finder window and perform another search to test if fixed\n\n*Once Finder search is confirmed working again with results showing up, you can then empty the Trash\n\nThis should resolve your issues.

Is it OK if I keep charging my iPad and iPhone using the Mac USB ports? Or is it better to charge them with the supplied chargers?\nI understand that charging slowly is better (though I'm not sure why), and I don't think it can get any slower than 1 day for the iPad using the USB port.\n\nA: Charging more slowly won't make any difference, other than reducing the slight side effect of heat buildup on the iPad.\nBut it's perfectly OK to use lower powered ports such as those on your computer instead of the main powered chargers.\nIt's also perfectly OK to do it the other way around; you can charge your iPhone using the more powerful 20W iPad main adapter. It won't actually charge any faster than using the equivalent iPhone adapter, though. People will warn you that you'll damage your iPhone using this method, but that's simply a misunderstanding. 20W is the amount that the charger is capable of delivering, but if the phone doesn't ask for it, it doesn't get it. It's not all or nothing.\n\nA: It's not any better or any worse just slower. Personally I'd use the mains supply as its much quicker.\n\nA: If you have both options, you should prefer the wall charging method. The USB charging is not only slow but also not as efficient as the wall charging.\n", "Q: Moving iTunes library after crashed Windows drive I've read many questions and answers here about moving iTunes libraries between computers and drives. My situation is a little different though. I have (had) Windows XP with iTunes installed on C: and my iTunes library on a second drive (E:). Drive C: crashed recently.\nMy plan is to move my iTunes folder from drive E: to an external backup drive, re-install Windows onto drive E: (obviously it will now be drive C:) and then copy my iTunes library onto drive C:. I would then configure iTunes to point to C: drive for the library. From what I've read, this should work.\nWhere are all my podcast subscriptions stored? Where are all my ratings and play-counts stored? Will they still be in iTunes after I've followed these steps?\nEdit: Further reading has made me aware of the Media and the Library folders. As far as I know, all my library files (music and podcasts) are located in the iTunes folder on E: drive.\nEdit: I have a backup image of the C: drive from about six weeks ago, so I should be able to access files from there if I need to to restore metadata?\n\nA: By your method , backup and restore the library and files, definitely works . It saves all the playlists, playcounts, music, movies, ratings everything. \n\nA: Because my music and podcasts were stored on the E: drive, I needed to also copy the iTunes metadata folder under My Documents. I had a backup of this from a few weeks ago. The iTunes Library file(s) there reference all music and podcasts as being on the E: drive, which is where they were. Instead of editing that file, I used the subst command in Windows to create an E: drive which just referenced C:. After installing iTunes and copying the iTunes metadata folder into My Documents, I launched iTunes and my music and podcasts appeared.\nMy understanding is that if music and podcast files are not stored in an alternate location, simply copying the iTunes folder under My Documents as described in the official documentation is sufficient. My music and podcasts were stored in an alternate location (E:), which additionally no longer existed after the reinstall.\n", "Q: Do 2.5\" SATA HDDs in an external enclosure need extra power over USB with Windows? MacBook Pro 2008 motherboard failed. Upon sending it to an Apple authorized repair center, they confirmed this. They gave me the laptop back so I could open 'er up and get the hard disk out, which I did. The hard disk should be undamaged.\nHowever, upon plugging it into an external enclosure – and connecting the enclosure to a computer running Windows – there's power, but nothing seems to happen. I'm just powering over USB. I wouldn't expect the HDD to be dead as well as the motherboard.\nDoes the 2.5\" SATA HDD from a 2008 MacBook Pro need extra power when connected in that way?\n\nA: What is the exact make and model of external enclosure you are using? Some of them require an external AC adaptor. Some of them come with a duplex (two-headed) USB cable and require that both of them be plugged in to powered USB sources to provide enough voltage to run the enclosure and the drive.\nOf course it is possible that your hard drive itself is damaged. If that is the case, you will need to pay a lot of money to a specialty hard disk data recovery service.\nFinally, do you not already have a Time Machine backup of your Mac's internal hard drive to an external disk drive? When this current situation is resolved, it would be wise to invest in an external backup system using Time Machine.\nUPDATE:\nHave you tried this drive in a different external enclosure? until you do that, you can't rule out that it's the external enclosure's problem and not the drive's problem.\n\nA: My understanding is that USB drives do require more voltage than that provided by a chassis/ enclosure. Often the enclosure has a power supply and that should work, but if it doesn't, you could get one at a Radio Shack or equivalent.\nAn alternative is this cheap rig from Other World Computing that allow you to connect and power many types of drives. \nOWC - http://eshop.macsales.com/item/NewerTech/U3NVSPATA/\n\nA: No, it shouldn't. I use this enclosure for external drive work, but what I found is that the USB port you use is important. Connect up the cable, and use the furthest USB port away from you of the two (i.e. the one closer to the MiniDisplay Port). I discovered this when first trying to use my Lacie 500GB external for TM backups, it would mount and then dismount after a few seconds, which was incredibly annoying. I then tried swapping ports, and it has worked flawlessly ever since. I think I read somewhere that Apple underpowers one port or something.\n*This is the case on my MBP mid-2010 anyway. \nHope this helps!\n\nA: The problem is to do with the file system. Whilst I had mentioned in some comments that I had plugged it into a Windows machine, I should have mentioned this in the main post. I assumed that Windows would pick up there's a drive there, even if it couldn't read the files, but I misunderstood how file systems work.\nTo fix this, I simply installed MacDrive 9 (there's also HFSExplorer) and plugged the hard disk directly into my PSU on my main system at work, and lo, behold the data!. I was quite surprised. I will not make this mistake again, as it was written in the book of data \"thou shalt back up thy data otherwise a mighty plague of death upon your magnetic storage!\"\nSo remember, Windows just fails to recognise an HFS-formatted drive.\n\nA: If its a 2.5\" then it doesn't need external power . I can assure you that. \n", "Q: Mac Postfix - Force from address, prevent from using Mac Username After making the switch from Windows using WAMP and sendmail, to Mac using MAMP Pro and hopefully Postfix I am having issues getting the emails configured correctly.

I want to change some settings related to restrictions on my iPad but I don't remember the code I used to lock changes to restrictions. I have a few common variations to try, I'm certain it is one of them, but I noticed that the device counts the attempts I've already made. \nWill I be blocked from further attempts at some point or is just an informative counter?\n\nA: If you are talking about Parental Control type of restrictions on the iPad, I believe that to be entirely iOS software level. You have 6 attempts before it locks you out for a minute. It then increases the locked-out time after further failed attempts. Since you have two failed attempts, it should let you have four more without consequence, which, if one goes through, all is well, if not, you will be locked out, before you can do a 7th attempt for 1 minute - to start with.\nIf you fail the 7th time, it will increase the time to 5 minutes.\nThe eight time increases it to 15 minutes.\nAnd if you fail the ninth time, the timer increases to sixty minutes and will be that amount until you enter the right one.\n", "Q: Left mouse click for external mouse not working after upgrading to Lion I'm setting up an older MacBook Pro (it still has the button on the trackpad) and after upgrading it from a fresh install of Snow Leopard to Lion last night my external mouse is not functioning properly.\nLeft clicks with the mouse are not registered. Right clicking is fine. Moving the mouse around is fine. But left clicks do nothing. I can click with the trackpad button (but this button sticks, which is why an external mouse is required) and that does work.\nI have natural scrolling turned off.

For 3 days, I now got a new rMBP. I am a first time Mac user.\nI had a friend with a MBP and it usually wakes up in a mere second, as soon as he opens the laptop's lid up. However in my Retina MBP, it takes a few seconds (3-5s) to wake up.\nIs this normal?\n\nA: To confirm that you're in Deep Sleep mode, open Terminal and type\npmset -g | grep hibernatemode\nThe output should be hibernatemode    3, with the 3 indicating that you're in Deep Sleep mode. This is useful if you're putting your computer to sleep and you're low on battery—if your battery dies in sleep, your session isn't lost. But you get that 3–5 second delay, which can be annoying when everything else is blazing fast. \nIf you're like me and have the battery charged most of the time (keep it plugged in 90% of the time—it's the charge cycles that kills your battery, much more than any debatable effects of overcharging. Use the battery 10% of the time to keep the electrons flowing), you can disable Deep Sleep and get rid of the delay. \nType sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0 in Terminal. It'll prompt you for an admin password. Type it in (note that it won't show up when you're typing, but it is being entered) and hit Return, and you'll have no delay when waking up. You'll also recover as much disk space as you have RAM, and those 8GBs or 16GBs are significant, especially if you're on a 256GB SSD. \nNote that I've had occasional issues when waking with the recent SMC update (black screen and nothing happens until reboot), but even with a reboot you don't loose your session.\nSource: http://www.macworld.com/article/1053471/sleepmode.html\n\nA: Here is a post about how to fix the slow wake up time. Its about sleep mode goes into standby mode:\n\nApple now uses a new powersaving mode to fulfill the 30 days of standby. The new MacBook Pro’s and Air’s are now switching after a delay of 1 hour from sleep modus to standby. In the standby mode the content of the RAM will be written to the hard drive and the RAM is powered down to further extend battery life. When you wake up the MacBook from standby, the content must first read back to the RAM and this can take some seconds depending on the RAM size.\nWith a simple terminal command you can change the delay time before the MacBook will switch to standby. The command uses seconds for the time value. So e.g. if you want to change the delay time from 1 hour to 12 hours you need the value “43200” for the command. It depends on how you use your MacBook to which value you set the delay.\nChange MacBook Wake Up time with terminal command:\n\n*\n\n*Start Terminal in Application -> Utilities -> Terminal.app or type Terminal in the spotlight Search.\n\n\n*Type sudo pmset –a standbydelay 43200\nYou can also disable the standby mode completely with 0. Mostly I don’t shutdown my MacBook and set my delay to 24 hours (86400)\nTo view the current settings use pmset -g.\n\n\nA: This post is a little older, but I found it very helpful.  Instead of using terminal, though, you could just enable Power Nap by going to System Preferences, Energy Saver, Battery, then click the box to Enable Power Nap While on Battery Power.  \nI got this info from http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4392.  Here's the pertinent content below:\nThe standby mode activates after just over an hour of \"regular\" sleep. To enter standby, the computer must:\n\n\n*\n\n*Be running on battery power.\n\n*Have no USB devices attached.\n\n*Have no SD card inserted.\n\n*Have no Bluetooth devices currently paired.\n\n*Have no external display attached.\n\n*Have Power Nap disabled (if it is supported on your Mac).\n\nA: In addition to what Nathan said, if you have any external drives connected up as well, the system remounts them before presenting you with the login screen also. So if you have a slow hard drive/optical drive connected, it may take a bit more time to fire back up again. \n\nA: After the rMBP or the MacBook Air are left sleeping for one hour, they enter a deep sleep mode in order to conserve battery.  Traditional Macs without SSDs do not enter this mode, so they might awake from sleep a bit faster.\nTo answer your question, that is normal behavior.\n", "Q: Delete Stored Offline Attachments in Mail.app I'm using Apple Mail and have noticed that the ~/Library/Mail/V2 folder is using up over a gigabyte of space. I'm guessing that a lot of that is stored attachments for my email messages.

I'm getting some strange results in my LinkShare affiliate report for sales made through the iTunes Store App Store: multiple sales of the same SKU but for different Sales amounts. I'm not aware of any sales on that item, so I'm wondering if someone else happened to pick the same SKU. (That's awfully coincidental b/c this SKU is 1/2 of the total items we've sold.)\nSo, I'm wondering how I can search for what products have that SKU.\nI tried searching the iTunes store for the sku. I didn't get any hits (not surprisingly).\n\nA: Simple,\nTake your SKU (it should be something like..  id398157641 or 398157641)\nPop it in where the same number is.. and make sure there is the word id before it.. like so...\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/app/app-name/id398157641\n", "Q: Is there a way to lock your Apple device against syncing on other computers?

I shuffled my home directory around and moved it back to my spinning platter drive in my MacBook. Ever since, Time Machine has been running my machine hot (the fan comes on when Time Machine starts up) and the backup data size estimates shown by Time Machine in the menu bar are huge. Many gigabytes.\n\nBut when I inspect the completed backups with BackupLoupe the actual backup size is very, very small.\n\nThis wouldn't bother me so much if it weren't for the fact that Time Machine runs my machine very hot when it runs, occupies a fair bit of CPU and takes a good 20-30 minutes to complete the hourly backup run now.\nMy complete exclusion list for Time Machine is currently:\n~/Library/Application Support\n~/Documents/Virtual Machines.localized\n~/Virtual Machines\n\nUpdate 1:\nI excluded ~/Library/Application Support on a hunch that it might be time stamp issues on cache files that end up having no change in in their bits. But TM is still saying it's backing up >2 GB of data.\nUpdate 2:\nUltimately I'd like to trim the amount of time Time Machine spends running on my machine. Currently it's spending upwards of 30 minutes every hour spinning on these backups.\n\nWhy is Time Machine's reported effort in the tool bar so much higher than the actual backup contents as reported by BackupLoupe? Is one of them wrong? Which one?\nHow can I help guide Time Machine in it's estimate of what needs to be backed up so it doesn't have to work so hard?\n\nA: Time Machine uses FSEvents to determine what has changed, which is based on folders rather than files. Hence, I've always assumed† that the larger number indicates the total size of the folders it has to process. Next, within each folder it will evaluate each file. (In 2008, some wrote \"Time Machine considers two files to be identical if their path and dates and size are the same\", so some changes might even go unnoticed. But that's another story.)\nIf many files in a large folder have not changed, then the total number to actually back up is much lower, but Time Machine does not know until it has processed those. Note that files might have the extended attribute com.apple.metadata:com_apple_backup_excludeItem set, or might be excluded by Apple's factory settings, implying they won't be put on the backup. See Does Apple's Time Machine app really copy everthing on Super User.\n(So: I guess you need to find large source folders that are small on the backup. Tools like Disk Inventory X or GrandPerspective could indeed show large folders, like in /private/var. Might be easy to compare that to the few folders on the backup?)\n\n† Now that I think of it years later: seeing the size of my Downloads folder, I doubt that it's (always) showing the folder size in the amount of data it's going to back up. Downloading another small file does NOT make Time Machine claim it needs to back up the full size of that Downloads folder. (And yes, that folder is on my backups.)\n\nA: A couple of suggestions that may or may not help; firstly take a look at this app, TimeTracker, it shows what was backed up and, most importantly, its size, in TM. A bit like the app in the screenshot you provided, but for TM. \nA guy on a forum post I found said something about an Office identity being the problem, and it was also suggested that Virtual Machine swap files may be an issue as well. I don't think either of these folders will be located in Application support, hence why the massive backups will still happen, if they are to blame.\nHopes this helps to shed some light on the mystery!\n\nA: I do not have an answer directly to your question about the difference in reported sizes as I am not familiar with backupLoupe.\nBut when faced with a similar situation I chose to have the Time Machine backups run less frequently.\nIn terminal enter the following command:\nsudo nano /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-auto.plist\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Use your arrow keys to navigate to the field that says\nnumber of seconds\n\n*Change the number (default is 3600) to your desired time (in seconds)\n\n*To save the file, press Control + O, then hit enter to save it.\n\n*Lastly, press Control + X to exit nano (unix text editor) and close terminal.\n\n*Rebooting your computer will make these changes take effect\n\n\nSource: http://hangoutjunkie.com/how-to-change-time-machine-backup-frequency/\nRemember that if you use this method you have fewer saved states from which you can pull from if you need to restore a file.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Believe it or not, time machine runs without an external hard drive present. It has a local cache (called Local Snapshots) which it backs stuff up on and then syncs that to the disk.\n\nApple says the following:\n\nWhen you enter the Time Machine browser (used to restore data), local\n  snapshots will appear on the timeline along with regular backups\n  distinguished by different colors. Gray tick marks represent local\n  snapshots and pink tick marks represent backups stored on your\n  external backup disk or Time Capsule. Note: Pink tick marks will be\n  dimmed if your portable computer is not connected to your external\n  backup disk or Time Capsule.\n\nMore can be read on Time Machine and local snapshots: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4878\nThe large amount of items could be history for days OR even things you recently deleted. Let it finish once, then the next time it should be less.\n", "Q: What is the impedance of the line/headphone jack on MacBook Pro Retina? I want to buy headphones that I will primarily use on my MacBook Pro Retina. I read that I should not buy headphones with high impedance because the volume will be really low. I want something I can use with my MacBook and my iPad. I looked at these headphones, but I'm afraid they will not work well for my purposes:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Beyerdynamic-770-PRO-250-ohms/dp/B0006NL5SM/ref=pd_cp_e_0\nDoes anyone have experience with this stuff?\n\nA: The thing is, the higher impedance headphones will be much lower quality on a low impedance output such as the MacBook. Coming from an audiophile, if you only have a MacBook and you don't have the dough to buy a $500 headphone amp, it's not worth it! A $150 set of headphones would have better quality than an $800 dollar set without an amp.\n\nA: I have a pair of Beyerdynamic 990 PRO 250 Ohm which supposedly use the same drivers as the 770 Pro 250 Ohm. I use these with a MacBook Air (early 2011) and have no trouble driving them at levels beyond what I would think of as comfortable or even healthy (but others may have a different definition of \"loud\").\nOn the positive side, if the output impedance of the MacBook is rated at <24 Ohm, then the 250 Ohm input impedance of the Beyerdynamics gives you a damping factor above 10 which helps keep distortion low.\nBeyerdynamic have versions with lower impedance to deliver higher volume with portable equipment but I have found that even my Samsung Galaxy Note drives the 250 Ohm versions loud enough for my (almost 40 year old) ears.\n\nA: Update for the 2021 MacBook Pro 14\" and 16\".\nThe 3.5 mm headphone jack on the MacBook Pro (14-inch, 2021) or MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021) features DC load detection and adaptive voltage output. Mac can detect the impedance of the connected device and will adapt its output for low- and high-impedance headphones, as well as for line-level audio devices.\nWhen connected headphones with an impedance of less than 150 ohms, the headphone jack provides up to 1.25 volts RMS. For headphones with an impedance of 150 to 1k ohms, the headphone jack delivers 3 volts RMS. This may remove the need for an external headphone amplifier.\nThe built-in digital-to-analog converter supports sample rates of up to 96 kHz.\nReference : Apple Support - Use high-impedance headphones with new MacBook Pro models\nPS: I am answering  here as well since this thread is active, in addition to my original answer for the New 2021 MBP thread: High Impedance support for the new Headphone Jack on the 2021 MacBook Pro 14\" and 16\"?\n\nA: The 2021 MacBook Pro have a fairly detailed spec sheet:\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212856\n\nI couldn't find the specific details for the original MacBook Pro Retina machine, but these specs are pretty universal across the whole MBP lineup and should help you match a pair of headphones:\n\nLine/Headphone Output\nThe line/headphone output is automatically selected for audio output if no external device is detected at the S/PDIF optical digital output port. The line/headphone output supports a stereo data stream at bit depths of 16, 20, or 24 bits per sample and at sample rates of 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, or 96 kHz. The line/headphone output volume can be adjusted from 0.0 dB to -95.25 dB.\nDuring playback of a 1 kHz, full-scale sine wave (44.1 kHz output sample rate, 24-bit sample depth, 100 kΩ load, unless otherwise specified) the audio line output has the following nominal specifications:\nJack type: 3.5 mm stereo\nMaximum output voltage: 2 VRMS (+8.24 dBu)\nOutput impedance: < 24 Ω\nFrequency response: 20 Hz to 20 kHz, +0.5 dB/-3 dB\nSignal-to-noise ratio (SNR): > 90 dB\nTotal harmonic distortion + noise (THD+N): < -80 dB (0.01%)\nChannel separation: > 75 dB\nNote: For best results, equipment plugged into the line/headphone output jack should not connect the audio ground to other grounds, such as the chassis or “green-wire” ground.\n\nThe answer to that post doesn't contain a reference link I'm afraid.\nI did find a link on the Apple Support page that says the Mac Mini's headphone jack is 10 Ohms.\nAll this is to say: yes, you're correct. Those headphones are far too high a load for the limited-power amplifiers in your iDevices and your MacBook Pro.\nYou want a lower impedance headphones. They're more efficient at converting the electrical signal they're passed in to sound you can hear. More efficient means, for the same power electrical signal, higher volume reproduction.\nAim for something the less-than-or-equal to 64 Ohm range if you can.\n\nA: I have tried both the Marshal Major and the Urban Ears headphones through the Macbook Pro Retina.\nBoth are simply fantastic.\nMarc\n\nA: If you are concerned about the volume level, try headphones that have between about 16 and about 32 ohm impedance and with a high sensitivity (dB/mW), say more than about 90 or 100. There are headphones with over 110dB/mW sensitivity with impedance in that range.\nIf the output impedance of the device is a bit lower than the input impedance of the headphones, you trade a little bit of loudness for a bit of quality.\nThis will make sure you can use your headphones with many different devices, if one day you upgrade your sound sources.\nMore details about line level and headphones can be found on the Wikipedia:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_level\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headphones#Electrical_characteristics\n\nA: http://nwavguy.blogspot.com.au/2011/02/headphone-amp-impedance.html\n\"THE SHORT VERSION: All you really need to know is most headphones work best when the output impedance is less than 1/8th the headphone impedance. So, for example, with 32 ohm Grados the output impedance can be, at most, 32/8 = 4 ohms. The Etymotic HF5s are 16 ohms so the max output impedance is 16/8 = 2 ohms. If you want to be assured a source will work well with just about any headphone, simply make sure the output impedance is under 2 ohms.\"\nSo if the mac is 10 ohm output, you want headphones with >80ohm impedance.\n\nA: It turns out higher impedance headphones will produce very low sound on MacBooks. For this reason headphones with an ohms rating above 80 may not be suitable, and would require a headphone amplifier to function properly.\nSomething like the FiiO E11 could get the job done at the expense of some portability, although it would allow such headphones to be used with most portable devices too like iPods, iPhones, and iPads.\n\nA: This is an old question, but this does still come up from time to time.\nFor portable use you want a low impedance headphone. On the one you quoted the 16 or 32 ohm impedance is the one you want. Lower impedance will be a little more bassy, 32 Ohm might be a smidge better quality but a little bit quieter. The high impedance headphones are for amplified studio use. I'd get the 32 Ohm unit.\nThis site says a lot, probably enough to confuse you more. https://www.headphonesty.com/2019/04/headphone-impedance-demystified/ The table at the end says the Air has an output impedance of 1.6 Ohms.  I don't think it matters much for you, however.\nYou see, while I don't have a MacBook Pro Retina, the Sony MDRZX110 sounds great on a Mac Mini. 24 Ohms, 98dB/mW sensitivity. Output from the Mac Mini at 1/3 full scale is fine, full scale would induce hearing loss type loud over time. $14 on Amazon. Audio quite clear. Ear covering style. In addition, it works great with the USB-C to 3.5 mm adapter for airplane trip use, and works fine on my iPhone SE with the same adapter. All those devices have a wide range of low impedance.\nThe power output on these differing machines is similar. It probably qualifies as line-out, which is at least 1V p-p.  Headphones or a speaker that is powered will do fine. The headphones I described above are fine.\n\nA: I've tried the Beyerdynamic 770 Pro 80 Ohms on a MacBook Pro (2018) and they sound dull compared to my other Marshall headset and to what they produce on a Hi-Fi amplifier.\nI'm exchanging them for the 32 Ohms version.\n\nA: Geeez ...  Why make a simple question hard ...  Almost all analog audio devices have an output of between 4 and 20 ohms.  So, the closer to that range your headphones the better they will perform.  10 ohms is good.\n", "Q: Time Machine error - backup disk image could not be created I get this error and was wondering if anyone knew what the issue might be. \n\nIt is supposed to be backing up to Time Capsule but not sure if it's ever worked.

The closest I've seen is System Status, which is an Activity Monitor-style app that has a big battery status display, as well as lots of other info on free memory, device space, running processes, etc.\nSomething that does exactly what you're looking for is unlikely, as there are no public APIs for getting the device signal strength.

However, if I open the same document in Acrobat it looks heavily pixelated.\nIs there any explanation for why this is happening? Or how it can be fixed?\nThx!\nSee attached photos\n\nThe first screenshot is from Preview and the second is from Acrobat.\n\nA: Well, OS X has built in font-rendering that Preview uses, which tends to look pretty great.\nAdobe Acrobat must be using their own custom software to render fonts that isn't as good.  Unfortunately, it is up to Adobe to fix their font rendering.  You might want to look for an Acrobat setting that enables anti-aliasing which might help.\n\nA: It looks like the font is being rendered differently in each application. It's possible you have two copies of the same font family installed, and Acrobat is using a different one to render. I've had similar problems where Office installed duplicate versions of fonts that caused some rendering weirdness.\nTry opening the Font Book application, and select Look for Enabled Duplicates… under the Edit menu.

Because it has no text, it does not appear in the notification center and I therefore cannot determine what app is causing this.  Kind of annoying.\nIs there anyway to identify which app is sending an audio-only notification?\n\nA: Yes, you can, you just have to do some digging around to find the particular one that is causing the noise. If you go into your Settings application on your iDevice, and go into the Notifications Options Tab and look for apps that have the sounds attribute available.  As seen the in the screen shot below highlighted in red.  \n\nSelecting that one will take you further into the customizations and see if the app is sending other notifications, as shown below, this one does sound and badge and can be seen in the lock screen.  Toggling those on and off will help you find the culprit.\n\nYou will be looking for an App that is only making noise, look for one that says noise only and everything else is turned off, that one will most likely be the problem.  You can then turn on other notifications so that it will be more helpful. If you find more than one app that is noise only, enable more notification types to help you narrow down which one it is. Once you find it, you can disable it or change the setting any which way you want.\nI hope that this answer helps you narrow down the noisy notifier. \n\nA: How to find the source of a sound on an iPhone? suggests it may be GMail.

But that account was deleted a long time ago, and since then I've updated tons of apps...so it's very strange.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: When you install Apps, you usually install them to the Applications Folder, which is accessible to all users, because it is in the ROOT directory, not just the users that installed them.  You can create an Applications Folder in a User's Folder and keep them for just that user, but it usually is the first way I mentioned. That way when you make a new user on the fly, you don't have to install all those apps again, waisting space. Also, that way you don't lose apps that may have taken time to install that other users need and use.\nApplications that are installed to a computer through the App Store are linked to an Apple ID that was used to Purchase/Download it.  This is similar to iOS devices as well.  If I download an app on another persons iPhone using my account, they need my account to update it.\nSo this means one of two things:\nEither your wife bought iPhoto (Or which ever other App is in question) or when you bought the computer, registered iPhoto to her account.\nWhen you buy a new mac, it comes with iLife, and iLife is now downloaded through the App Store.  It will link those 3 Apps, to the Apple ID of your choosing so that if anything happens and you need to do a restore or something, you can download those apps you got for free again, no problem.\nI had to do this when I bought my mid 2011 Mac Mini. \nSo she either purchased it or registered it to her account, and that is why it is still on the computer, because it is an App that can be accessed by any user that is on the machine, so it wouldn't have been deleted when she installed it/registered it.  You will need her sign in and password in order to update it.\nI hope that this information helps you out.\n", "Q: Is it possible to enable 1.5x scaling using HiDPI on OS X? I use a Mac Mini on a 46\" 1080p TV and using native resolution the UI is too small, and using HiDPI the UI is too big.\nIs there a way to hack the OS X to enable 150% scaling instead of 100% and 200% ??\n\nA: No, this is not possible as it would result in a significantly distorted image with loss of image data. There is no way to accurately display one dot over 1.5 x 1.5 pixels.\n\nA: Unlike previous attempts at OS X resolution independence, HiDPI mode has a fixed 2x scaling factor. There's no way to change that scale factor, nor would I expect things to work well even if you could. In fact, prior to 10.7.3 or .4, HiDPI still had some bugs here and there.\nThere's a good section on resolution independence in John Siracusa's Lion review at Ars Technica if you want a bit more detail.\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly you would like to have your information displayed in 1080p, I am low vision and use my mac mini server on a 42\" vizio, if you right click or two finger tap (with a magic trackpad) on the tool bar of safari, mail and many other apps you will get a menu to hide tool bar and an option to customize tool bar, select customize tool bar then drag the little A and big A icon onto the tool bar this will allow you to enlarge the element inside of safari (keystrokes are command = or - on the short keyboard, you can use the + or - on the num pad of the long keyboard). For my lcd it takes three or four clicks of the big A, or three or four clicks of command +, this will display the page as it should, if I need further enlargement I will use pinch to zoom on the trackpad and two finger slide left or right to move the element to be able to read all the text on the screen. This option is not available with the app store or iTunes.\nWhen the above options are not available or I need to read the tool bar or menus I use the accessibility feature in ML or Universal Access in Lion or earlier. Open system preferences select accessibility in ML,  then select zoom and enable the box for use keyboard shortcuts to zoom (this mode enlarges the whole screen not just the element inside the app) the keystrokes are option command = to enlarge or option command - to decress with the short keyboard (if you have the long keyboard you can use option command + or - on the num pad). You can also select more options and use the maximum zoom slider for a one click default zoom option, use the same keystrokes option command = or + to zoom out and option command - to zoom back in. You will have to play with this to find the zoom size you need.\nSorry I do not know how to include pictures or screenshots if someone could edit it might help. I hope this has helped.\n\nA: Yes, this is possible:\nFirst you need to get SwitchResX.\nAfter installation, you then click System Preferences > Other > SwitchResX > select your Mac / Monitor from the right column -> Custom Resolution > and click + button to add a new resolution.\nNow you need to select \"Scaled resolution\" inside the select option field & enter the resolution inside the scaled to Text field. So lets say if you want a 1920 x 1080 Hidpi setting, you need to create a custom 3840 x 2160 etc.\nAfter all, just click save and then restart it, once you restart your mac, you should be able to see the new hidpi setting under display setting.\n", "Q: Why might more memory be wired in safe mode than in normal mode?

The extra memory is likely being used for the display where it would normally be allocated to share with integrated graphics or be handled by a discreet graphics card.\n\nA: Wiring code into RAM prevents it from being swapped to storage, so this might be a nice design tradeoff to wire critical components and frameworks to RAM so that the chance of a drive that fails to write data correctly will bring the system down.\nTrading speed for stability would be a nice thing for safe mode to enhance it's ability to run in edge cases (drive totally full, drive failing, major software corruption). Even if this is not intentional, the safe boot does throw away (and does not recreate) the dynamic loader shared cache and that also might be a design reason to just pin each library needed into RAM. You would want to run sysdiagnose before, during and after a safe boot and might be able to see in memory allocation statistics if this makes up for your measured difference in RAM allocation.\nI can't speak for the designers, but I would consider making this tradeoff if I were in their shoes and wanted to make Safe Mode as safe to run as possible.\n", "Q: Cannot enable guest account I cannot enable Guest Account.

You can fix the metadata in iTunes once you've imported it.\nThere are programs that will set the metadata based on the file name but unless you are planning to do many files, it may not be worth the trouble.  Are you using OS X or Windows?\n", "Q: iMac sounds like it's starting up then shutting down immediately I have an iMac. Since yesterday, it has been making sounds where it seems like a hard drive is starting up then shutting down immediately. However, that can't be possible of course because the computer technically works fine—the sound occurs while I'm using the computer, and it doesn't lock up or anything like that. (Also, I thought it was an external HD but I put my ear to the back of the iMac and it is definitely coming from there.)\nThis started happening around the same time that I started watching high definition videos (720p h264) of a TV series. I had watched maybe ten episodes before the sounds started occurring. That would be perhaps ten hours over a 20 hour span. Also, the computer was up (hadn't shut down) for 72 hours straight.\nI'm thinking it could be a fan problem perhaps, or a power supply problem?\nThese sounds have never happened before, even when doing stuff like playing high performance computer games.\nI have also noticed that there is a high-pitched buzzing sound that occurs when this startup/shutdown sound happens. Also, the startup/shutdown sound seems to happen consistently when I start up my computer, so perhaps it IS a fan or power supply related problem?\n\nA: Open it up, check for dust, reinstall the Mac OS X (fresh installation), Check whether the fan is functioning properly. If all these doesn't solve the issue, then probably you will need to get it examined by an Apple service guy. \n", "Q: Cloning a Windows machine and import into Boot Camp Consider a Windows 7 x64 installation on a physical machine. \nHow can you take a snapshot/image of a Windows installation, and end up running that system in Boot Camp? \nIs there a  P2V for Windows to Boot Camp?\nThe goal here is to save time and effort, rather than going through the OS installation + updates + application installation process after creating a fresh install in Boot Camp.\n\nA: This question on Super User may be of assistance.\nIt looks like you should be able to do a standard Bootcamp install of Windows, then use the system restore feature to clone your existing setup over to the Bootcamp install.\nIt's not as straightforward as directly cloning from your PC, but it should still save a fair bit of time vs. doing a full re-install with patches, etc., particularly if you use a USB drive for the install (which Bootcamp can help you with, given an Windows Installer ISO and a USB drive).\n", "Q: Downgrade a Mac App Store app? Is it possible to downgrade a Mac App Store app?  One of my apps has an update showing today, and I want to know if it's a one-way street.\nFor example, if I make a copy of the app before upgrading, and then do the App Store upgrade, and then delete the upgrade and move the original back, will I be back where I was before the upgrade?  (Or does it keep track of versions elsewhere, so things would get screwed up if I tried this?)\nOr is there an easier way?  Are downgrades a native feature of the App Store, so I don't have to do anything special myself?\n\nA: This can only be answered properly if you ask about a specific app. However, for the vast majority of apps there are three things you need to be aware of:\nthe app bundle\nInside the Applications folder (or wherever you've moved it to), you will find the app. If you have a backup (eg: with Time Machine) of an older version, simply restore the old version.\nTechnically, this is the only thing you need to do. But it won't always go smooth, so continue reading.\nthe settings\nAlmost all apps will write to a file ~/Library/Preferences/com.developer.AppName.plist and some will write to other locations inside ~/Library (a common one is Application Support).\nDepending on what the developer has done, these files may or may not need to be reverted to a backup that you made before upgrading the app (again, Time Machine is probably the best way to revert these files).\nMost of the time, it should be fine. Personally I would try using the old version without reverting these files, and if you do run into problems - then revert them.\n(note: the paths have changed a bit for apps that use the new sandboxing model... perhaps someone can edit my answer to describe how)\nyour documents\nAny document you've edited in a newer version of the app, might not be fully compatible with the old versions. For example Microsoft Word 2003 documents do not always open perfectly in Microsoft Word '98, depending what features you used.\n\nA: Typically, the method that you described will work.  However, in some (rare) cases, the app will change the way it stores settings and other information, and that would cause the old version to misbehave until you delete the app's settings (usually found in the Library folder) and start anew.  \nBut, as far as the App Store goes, your method is pretty much the only way to go, and the App Store shouldn't complain if you reinstall the old version.\n", "Q: Does push notification work on a jailbroken device? This is a quite straightforward question.\nI have read about the jailbroken devices having some problems receiving push notifications.\nIs that really true? And if so, how can we resolve it?\n\nA: To answer the question, you'll need to understand how Apple's push notification service works. Every application that wants to use push notifications must register with the Apple Push Notification Service (APNS). Typically, this is done right after installation. iOS asks the user if the app is allowed to receive push notifications. If the user agrees, his iPhone talks to the APNS and requests a token that can identify the combination of application and device. This token is then handed to the service provider (i.e. the developer of the application). If the provider wants to send a push notification, it sends this token along with the payload to the APNS, which then delivers the message. So you can imagine the token as some kind of address. That is, the provider has to include the token in every push message request.\nBut how is the token generated? According to Apple's docs, the registration mentioned above works as follows: The device sends its unique device token (this is another one!) to the APNS and requests the mentioned deviceToken from the APNS. This deviceToken depends amongst others on the device ID and the app ID and is generated using cryptographic functions, so it cannot be forged.\nNow here's the point: The unique token iOS needs to register applications and hence to allow push notifications is generated during the activation process in iTunes. The unique token also uses cryptography and can only be obtained from Apple during this activation process. Jailbroken and hacktivated iOS devices never perform the official activation, so they miss the token. Hence, push notifications cannot work (at least if Apple did not make a major mistake in the implementation). \n", "Q: Can't get Apple Hardware Test to work So I'm trying to run the Apple Hardware Test. I start the computer up and hold \"D\". It boots into OS X like a normal startup. So, I plug in the Ethernet and hold option-D to do the AHT from the Internet. It tells me \"Apple Hardware Test does not support this machine\".\nSo, I try to install the \"iMac EFI Update 1.8\" from http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1493 (which is for my iMac model, which is a iMac (Mid 2010)), but it says \"This software is not supported on your system.\" I also tried the later version, v1.9, from http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1498 but it isn't for my iMac and so I get the same error.\nI also tried putting in my DVD 1 for my iMac, then starting up by holding both \"D\" and \"option-D\", but neither booted AHT from the DVD.\nSo now I'm stuck. What should I do now?\n\nA: Do you have another mac? Can you boot the problematic machine in Target Mode (boot holding the T key). Connect to the other mac and run system utilities (Disk, etc) from there.\nWhat is the problem with your computer that requires you to run AHT?\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Okay, so I finally got it working by inserting DVD 2 rather than DVD 1. It clearly indicated on the DVD that it has Apple Hardware Test, which I missed the first time. This could be useful to those who have a similar problem to mine, I suppose.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro: water damage improved screen's brightness! This isn't your typical water damage story.\nOne side of my 2007-model, pre-Unibody laptop got damp from rain in a backpack yesterday. When I opened it, the left quarter of the screen had a splotch of water damage.\nThe damaged area is brighter and more vibrant than the rest of the screen!\n\nThe screen has seemed dim for most of the laptop's lifetime. Not long after its first birthday I even disassembled the screen looking for the problem. I found a blown capacitor and supposed a backlight power issue, but later discovered that wasn't the case.\nNow this seems to confirm it's some kind of optical effect. But what? I know plenty about optics and this doesn't make sense. The water must be filling a gap and providing better coupling between two layers, but there's no brightening if I press lightly on the screen. There's a little thin-film interference at the edges of the water layer where it tapers off. So the water layer is doing something.\nThe laptop will be fine in a few days; the water seems to be evaporating out through the screen. But I'm suffering this physics mystery.\n\nA: The reason it's brighter is because water has a refraction index that is closer to 'glass' (as in the specific material used in the screen--I know it's not really glass per se) than air does. This means that less light is lost in the area between the LCD and the front glass (or between the LCD and the backlight--but not very likely) and thus the screen appears brighter.\nYou'd probably get a better explanation on Physics in terms of specifics, but this is the answer in a nutshell.\n\nA: I have noticed the same effect when using a flatbed scanner to scan samples of wood (I dabble with tree-ring research). I get better results when I put a layer of water between the wood and the scanner plate. A colleague told me I would get even better results if I used oil - but I didn't want to foul up my scanner, so I didn't try that. I wonder if a layer of mineral oil would allow you to retain your screen improvement indefinitely. \nI would like to propose that the layer of liquid effectively 'smooths out' the surface of the LCD and the underside of the screen, resulting in less scattering of light(?). In support of this idea is that the smoother the surface of my wood samples, the clearer the resulting scan (for example with finer and finer sanding). I think this effect could be working in tandem with the Refractive Index effect explained by Matt above.\nCan you report back, did your screen dry out without failure in the end? I'm curious, because I half-filled my Macbook Air screen with water last week. It seemed to work fine during the shutdown sequence, but I have been hesitant to turn it back on again until it dries out completely. \n", "Q: How to check what is preventing MBP from graceful shutdown/restart and fix it? [Now with log entries] And hopefully really final edit: After upgrading to Mountain Lion, the issue seems fixed, hopefully permanently.\nFinal Edit: The problem doesn't happen all the time, sometimes I have to wait several days for it to occur. So it is hard to test under different conditions (i.e. safe mode or with some software disabled) and I've decided that it is not worth spending days truing different conditions in order to on fix this. Graham Perrin's suggestions were the most helpful for finding specific information about restart/reboot issues, not found in the general-purpose logs.\nSome log entries are in Edit at the bottom:\nMid-2010 15in MacBook Pro, running OS X 10.7.4. Sometimes when trying to restart or shutdown the machine, it won't work -- the screen turns gray, the spinning wheel shows, but the machine doesn't power down so after several minutes I have to shut down the machine by pressing the power button. \nIt doesn't happen every time, and I can't relate any software used during the session with the problem. In fact, when testing this, sometimes this would happen when I try to shutdown the machine immediately after starting it.\nHow to check what is preventing the graceful shutdown/restart? I assume that I have to look in some log files, but I am not sure which ones and what to look for.\nEdit: Added the verbose start/shutdown setting in the nvram as suggested by Graham Perrin,  and eventually the machine got stuck on reboot. I saw some verbose entries on the screen and after rebooting found them in in /var/log/launchd-shutdown.log. It appears that WindowServer may have something to do with it.

Fewer tea leaves. \nTo start in verbose mode without keying Command-V\nA preference can be stored in NVRAM. Enter the following command in Terminal, and be prepared to enter your admin password: \nsudo nvram boot-args=\"-v\"\n\nThe next start of the system will be verbose. \n\nsysdiagnose\nBefore each restart or shutdown, in Terminal: \nsudo sysdiagnose\n\nIt's time consuming, but you need not investigate the results of all runs. Pay attention only if a problems arises. \nFor a case such as lupincho's: \n\n\n*\n\n*the run of sysdiagnose may reveal a problem before a restart or shut down\n\n*the end result of sysdiagnose may be of interest following a forced restart or shut down. \n\n\nMore specifically: if a run of sysdiagnose fails to progress beyond a certain point, knowing that point can help to gain a sense of the underlying problem. \nDuring the run you can use the following key combination, repeatedly, to see whether things are progressing: \n\n\n*\n\n*Control-T\n\n\nFor the allmemory part of the sysdiagnose routine, Apple's two minute estimate may be wildly inaccurate. Be patient. \nIf you suspect that sysdiagnose fails to progress beyond a certain point, then key: \n\n\n*\n\n*Control-C\n\n\nIf repeated use of Control-C fails to abort sysdiagnose, then (in my experience with Mountain Lion) it's almost certain that an attempt to restart or shut down the operating system will fail. \n\nShutdown monitoring\nIn Finder, go to: \n/private/var/log/shutdown_monitor.log\nThis file is typically empty, but may contain items of interest following a problematic shutdown. (I have little experience in this area.)\nIf the only stray process at shutdown is WindowServer\nIt's not unusual to have stray processes at shutdown. A stray can be problematic only if it is not killed. \nIf you suspect that WindowServer is not killed, and that this particular stray is contributory to shutdown failure: ask yourself whether any third party software makes nonstandard use of the WindowServer process. \nQuick Look of a GrabFS view of WindowServer on Mountain Lion, with two displays: \n\nIf Lion is similar, then my gut feeling is that the cause of shutdown failures lies beyond WindowServer. \n\nGuesswork, based upon results of launchctl\nWhilst the machine is running normally, what response to the following command? \nsudo launchctl list | grep  --invert-match com.apple\n\nWonder whether any non-Apple software is contributory to the problem. Anti-virus, anti-malware software?\n\nFollowing an upgrade from Lion to Mountain Lion\nAim for: \n/private/var/log/com.apple.launchd/launchd-shutdown.system.log\n\nIt seems the default is one log per shut down, with a maximum of two so there's also: \n/private/var/log/com.apple.launchd/launchd-shutdown.system.log.1\n\nFollowing any forced restart or forced shut down, you might choose to set aside a copy of the most recent of the two. If force is required on any more than one occasion, you can compare files to see whether a pattern emerges. \nGenerally\nDon't rule out the possibility of an issue with third party software, even release quality. Little Snitch may be well written and widely respected but: \n\n\n*\n\n*when problems such as the one in this question become extended or too puzzling, any non-Apple kernel extension deserves attention. \n\n\nI tested Build 12A269 of OS X 10.8 for around two weeks before it was released, with particular attention to shut down behaviours in difficult situations. Whilst I have not watched any videos from WWDC 2012, I do have a sense that Apple has worked very hard to prevent the need for force in all but the most difficult situations. \nBuilding upon David DelMonte's answer\nAt least on Mountain Lion, I see the load of Little Snitch 3.0 Preview 2 (3857) very early – before shutdown logging begins. If things relating to this KEXT are similarly late around shutdown time, then maybe an issue will be not evident in the usual log files on disk. \n\nIf ever you discover the cause of the problem – with either Lion or Mountain Lion – I'll be pleased to know. \nIn the meantime, with big thanks for the bounty, a closing thought: \nkextstat -l | grep --invert-match com.apple\n\n\nA: Go to Applications -> Utilities, and open Console \nTake a look at the system.log file, you might be able to find something there.\n\nA: pmset -g assertions gets a summary of power assertions:\n$ pmset -g assertions\nAssertion status system-wide:\n   PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep             0\n   CPUBoundAssertion                       0\n   DisableInflow                           0\n   ChargeInhibit                           0\n   PreventSystemSleep                      0\n   PreventUserIdleSystemSleep              1\n   ExternalMedia                           1\n   DisableLowPowerBatteryWarnings          0\n   EnableIdleSleep                         1\n   NoRealPowerSources_debug                0\n   UserIsActive                            0\n   ApplePushServiceTask                    0\n\nListed by owning process:\n  pid 153: [0x00000099012c023b] PreventUserIdleSystemSleep named: \"com.apple.audio.'AppleUSBAudioEngine:Apple Inc.:Display Audio:15261930:2,1'.noidlesleep\" \n  pid 19: [0x00000013012c0235] ExternalMedia named: \"com.apple.powermanagement.externalmediamounted\" \n\nYou can see the path of a process with ps up $pid:\n$ ps up 153\nUSER          PID  %CPU %MEM      VSZ    RSS   TT  STAT STARTED      TIME COMMAND\n_coreaudiod   153   0.0  0.2  2475000   6740   ??

I finally resolved it by connecting to the drive using eSATA instead of USB or Firewire.  My USB/FW enclosure has an eSATA port on the back, and I connected to that instead of USB.  Bypassing the USB circuit in the external enclosure allowed Mac Disk Utility to directly recognize the WD30EZRX 3.0 TB drive, and to partition it correctly to that size.\nLuckily I have an older Macbook Pro with and Express/34 slot and an eSATA adapter for that.  I don't know how we are going fix this with newer MacBooks.  Perhaps newer USB interfaces can correctly represent the Advanced Format sector info.\n\nA: You may have a non-issue that you're worrying about. I have experienced this with several \"enclosured\" hard drives. The enclosure manufacturers want to sell more units, so they have developed their devices for the lowest common denominator--often Windows XP and USB.\nThe newer hard drive mechanisms utilize 4k blocks for better performance and media utilization. \"Most\" newer systems can directly talk to drives with the 4k interface. Unfortunately, I would assume these \"most newer systems\" represent less than 20% of the total market.\nThe enclosures manufacturers write and build the hardware/software interfaces between the native mechanism and the computer. This interface translates the eight 512-byte USB calls to single 4k SATA commands, aligning the USB blocks so they don't break the 4k boundaries. \nnew_hfs is reporting the USB controller's capabilities.\n\nA: There are several possible explanations for what you are seeing: \n\n1. Diskutil is reporting incorrect information\nOn my system, I have a Western Digital Black 750 plugged into the sata port previously occupied by my super drive\nI documented the install here:\nhttps://spuder.wordpress.com/2011/02/17/hard-drive-upgrade/\nEven though my advanced format drive has 4k sectors, the Block Size reports 512 Bytes. Since a Block is a collection of sectors, It would seem that my sector size is 512, and my block size is also 512. \nspuders-MacBook-Pro:~ spuder$ diskutil info /dev/disk0| grep -E \"Total Size:|Device Block Size:\"\n   Total Size:               750.2 GB (750156374016 Bytes) (exactly 1465149168 512-Byte-Blocks)\n   Device Block Size:        512 Bytes \n\nHowever further investigation casts doubt on the output of diskutil\nAccording to this website (\nHow to get HFS+ filesystem blocksize ), You can query the block size using the stat command. \nSpuders-MacBook-Pro:~ spuder$ stat -f \"%k\" ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \n4096\n\n4096 seems more like it. \nSo one possible solution is that diskutil simply can't be trusted. \nIt would be great if some other people could compare the output of their diskutil. \n\n2. The usb enclosure does not support 4k sectors\nThis is the more likely answer. \nIf a hard drive enclosure supports 4k, it is likely to brag about it. \nHere is an enclosure which people have reported working with 4k\nhttp://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-3-5-Inch-Removable-Enclosure-S352U2RER/dp/B002GWQ4IW\nThis could easily be tested by someone who has access to a 4k drive, and an enclosure that is known to support 4k. \n\n3. The drive is mis-reporting the sector size\nAccording to this wiki, drives are not guaranteed to report the correct sector size\n\nUnfortunately, some HDD manufacturers do not properly respond to the\n  device inquiry sizes. ...

I have a 1st gen one and I'm thinking about selling it to get a new one.\nPeople on ebay seem to want the old one.\nWhy are 1st gen Apple TVs selling on ebay for over $100 while a new Apple TV is sold for $99?\n\nA: de_an777 wrote a pretty solid answer. I'll add that because the underlying CPU is an Intel Pentium-M, the first generation Apple TVs can be hacked to run OS X. The later generation ones are ARM based and are thus restricted to Linux distributions that are ARM-compatible.\n\nA: Here is the big reason: The first gen ATV has a wifi card which can be removed in favor of a $40 Broadcom HD Decoder card.  Then, with a customized Linux distribution, you can run XBMC on the device and stream 1080 content from a NAS or another computer.  \nSince there is no jailbreak currently available for the third gen ATV, this is an easy an inexpensive way to watch HD video on one's HDTV, complete with an IR remote, and it's a full linux install as well.  \n\nA: The main reason the 1st generation Apple TV first retains it's value is because of the hard drive.  The 2nd generation does not have any built in storage and so everything has to stream to it.\nThere's nothing worse than hearing that long sigh on the other end of the phone when I have to explain that iTunes needs to be on the computer to stream the Glee album she wants to play.  \nIt has its limitations but the original Apple TV is superior for browsing my music collections.\n\nA: I'm impressed that the Apple TV first generation is really an Intel Mac capable of much more than a movie player. The Linux Crystalbuntu OS seems to be a good medium between a video device and an all out Intel Mac.  I purchased the 160 GB 1st generation for under $80 instead of the ATV 3 and think I've got a much better toy. \n\nA: It may not be an issue to many, but I prefer the old one because it has analogue audio out which makes it possible to link it with an older amplifier\nThis is a big issue to anyone who wants audio in Zone 2 or 3 from an AV receiver.\nOnly very expensive AV receivers can pass digital audio to secondary zones, they only pass analog audio.  Because newer AppleTVs only output digital audio (HDMI or optical), you need a digital to analog converter if you want audio from the AppleTV in secondary zones.\n\nA: We have a 1st Gen ATV plus a 2nd Gen ATV. At times either of these have been connected to the same Sony 42\" HDTV. There is a money saving difference that no one here mentioned: the first option with all movies on the ATV1Gen is to rent the SD version for a dollar less than the HD version. At least on our ATV 2nd Gen, only the HD version of movies is offered. Since the ATV and our Sony HD television are both capable of up-converting, we usually buy the SD version and save about $50 a year in movie rentals. The SD version is not some crappy, old low quality 4:3 television image. It looks so good on our TV only a video freak would notice the difference without a side-by-side comparison. I know, some of you will say it's big difference to you. Personally, we don't see much difference and we already have the thing so I say \"Save the money.\" We rent a lot of stuff with friends over, and not one has ever asked \"What's wrong with the resolution of the movie? Are you up-converting it?\" \nWe also hacked it with RemoteHD to be Airplay capable, and have it connected to the analog inputs of our tuner downstairs. Only the hacked ATV1Gen can accept streams from another Apple TV; later generations of ATV cannot share between each other. So we can stream music to it from any device in the house, even the other ATV, which is nice if you like background music while working or when entertaining. \nAlthough it has a hard drive, even if you pre-fill it with rented movies to take it with you, it still requires an internet connection to authorize the playback, so it's not really \"untethered\" from the internet for DRM movies. But non-DRM content like MP3 and Home movies play without a network connection. With some effort, you can get around this by converting movies beforehand, but I won't go into that. That's for people with more time than money, or insomniacs going on an extended cruise or something where there's no possibility of reliable internet.\nATV1Gen has proven to be a keeper. I bought it used on eBay for $125 and wouldn't sell it back even for more than that.  \n\nA: The only super major differences the 1st Gen Apple TV's has from the new ones is the ability to store Movies, Music, Content, etc because they have a physical hard drive in them for doing those things.  The other things is that they can connect to TV's through Red, Blue, Green Component Cables.  They also do not support Airplay with out a hack or a software fix. Also, the newest Apple TV, the 3rd Gen, allows for 1080p HD playback, where the older ones only support 720p HD playback. \nThere are also a few other minor differences in size, power consumption, software options/OS and so on.\nThe new Apple TV's do not have hard drives or Component Cable outputs and support Airplay out of the box. Airplay is probably the biggest feature that makes people who don't want to hack to jump ship to the newer box.  It is pretty cool. The 1080 HD playback is nice, but depending on your TV, may or may not be noticeable/important. \nSome people like the older ones also because they can be hacked and used as linux computers (link) with actual storage and since they can also store things on them, you can take it with you and have videos/music on it and not require internet for streaming your content. \nThough the biggest reason is most likely the hack-ability of them, they are tiny computers with a decent amount of power. And since they aren't sold any more and are still sought after, that would explain their above average price. \nThe new Apple TV's require internet of some kind or at least a local network for stream video and movies and data from a computer or the internet.  \nThey are also significantly smaller too, the older Apple TVs are much larger.\nYou can see all the differences on their wiki page, it lays out the differences in features between the devices and even talks about most of the hacks that are available. Very informative.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV\nI hope that this answer helps you out.\n\nA: You can also upgrade the HD to 1TB which takes the whole ATV1 to a new level. \n\nA: Re: Analog/Digital capabilities\nWith newer-gen Apple TVs you still can, apparently, hook up to analog with a simple & inexpensive hack - a digital-to-analog converter = $20 \nI'm just the messenger - not the thinker behind this, so if you want to check it out,  the link is at bottom of my comment\nI can't argue anything technically here - I was just looking into this and found the link right after leaving this site (which was helpful - thanks) \nJust wanted to share with anyone who comes looking for answer after me... \nhttp://www.technologytell.com/hometech/95077/3rd-gen-apple-tv-multi-room-music-server/\n\nA: Floating pictures screensaver\nAh, there is a major void here. The Apple TV Gen 1 is a photographer's dream.  For those of us with thousands of digital images, when do we ever trot them out and look at them? Rarely.

While I have music in iTunes on my non-primary computers, I don't need or want them to be connected to my overall iTunes account - I buy almost nothing through iTunes and just don't want or need them to be connected. \nThis is the box that pops up twice (that has somehow autofilled my email address even though I've never used the account on this machine's iTunes):\n\nI checked system preferences and didn't see anything that would appear to disable the pop up, but anyone know how to get rid of it? \nI realize this is a fairly basic question but it's super annoying. Both computers this is happening on are macs, if it matters.\nEDIT: This is what the Store Preferences page looks like - I don't see an option for disabling downloads, only ways to enable it via an iOS device or to a different account.\n\n\nA: Essentially, there are two different options you can try - depending on the way you want to use iTunes. I'll be writing this answer for Mac users, but Windows users can probably suss it out using these instructions.\nBoth options will only require you to click \"Store\" from the menu bar from within iTunes.\n\nOption One (red) - If you intend on using the Store, you can simply click the \"Authorize This Computer...\" menu option. This will prompt you for your password and tie your computer and iTunes library to your iTunes account.\nOption Two (blue) - If you don't intend on using the Store and would simply like to not see the dialog box prompting for your password, you can click the \"Sign Out\" menu option.\nOne of these two things should solve the problem of the persistent password prompt.\nBest of luck!\n", "Q: Changing the name attached to my MacBook Pro I bought a MacBook Pro Retina, and it's my first OS X computer.

And does it vary with 128GB or 256GB size hard drives?\n\nA: I don't see how this would depend on the type of Mac or hard drive. Instead, it should only depend on the version of OS X that you're running.\nWhile Apple's documentations for OS X 10.7 Lion state 7 GB as a required minimum, BootCamp 4.0.3 allows a minimum of 8GB for the OS X partition. Probably, because this includes the 650 MB for the recovery partition (end of page).\n", "Q: What is the complete upgrade path for Mac OS X version 10.7? I went to the Apple website, and they only talk about the upgrade to 10.7 from its previous version, 10.6.x. (and I know 10.8 is coming out soon). \nI am the new tech who tries to support a small number of Mac users in my office, and although they all want to upgrade to 10.7, I know they have different machines with different specs that they do not all run the version 10.6.x of Mac OS X.

Is there an upgrade map, along with models of Macs that I can look at? On the Apple website, they talk about upgrading from 10.6 to 10.7, but nothing for prior versions.\nThanks :-)\n\nA: For Mac OS X Lion 10.7, you need to have Snow Leopard (10.6) installed and updated to have the Mac App Store. So yes, if you had a computer still on Leopard 10.5, you would first have to install Snow Leopard, update it to get the Mac App Store update, and then install Lion from the App Store.\nYou mentioned:\n\nI know 10.8 is coming out soon).\n\nIt's coming out tomorrow! :)\nWhich is great, considering that Mountain Lion 10.8 allows Snow Leopard 10.6 and higher Macs to upgrade directly! \nI've never had any problems upgrading an OS, although I usually run a backup before just in case (and it's a good idea).\nI can't find an official Apple article for upgrading from Leopard 10.5, but I'll edit this post if I do.

I don't need any data while I am actually hiking (and tracking my progress with GPS).

The problem with Airplane mode is that it shuts the GPS off as well.\nIs there a way to conserve battery and use the GPS?\nI could get a solar charger or battery charger but would prefer not to.\n\nA: The best way to conserve battery is to turn off the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cellular data ( Settings > General > Cellular)\n\n*Bluetooth (Settings > Bluetooth)\n\n*And Wifi (Settings > Wifi)\n\n\nSome may recommend closing all the apps in the app switcher, but those shouldn't drain battery. \nI have found my iPhone 4S to last about a day with no/almost none cell phone coverage at all while tracking my \"travel\" (hiking, walking, whatever) with GPS.

Do I need to activate homesharing or something, because I don't have this problem with my iPod. PLEASE HELP!!!\n\nA: From my understanding of the question, it seems to me that you are trying to sync your new iPhone with two different libraries.  This is impossible without a jailbreak (which by no means I am suggesting you do). \nSince you can't sync songs from your own iTunes library, it looks like you set up your iPhone on your mom's library. I would suggest that you select 'Erase and Sync' when you try to sync your music to your own library and allow your iTunes library to manage your new iPhone. Then, I would probably import your mom's music to your iTunes library.\nYou can do this using Home Sharing, as you said, but only if both of you use the same Apple ID.  Alternatively, you could follow this thread and simply share the organized files and put them in your ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music/ if you're on a Mac.

I have never had problems with other services, torrent, skype, app store (not sure what port that uses) - although, these could just be in the group of sites/services that I can access - note I am writing this on the problematic machine, so this site is fine. \nAny help would be greatly appreciated. I'm desperate to fix this.\nBTW - I did read this: I cannot connect to internet but my MacBook Pro detects the network and my HP computer works fine on the same network but note that I have no proxies selected. \nThanks!\nEDIT - I just noticed while looking at other questions, that people did not have their router address as a DHCP-provided DNS server in their network prefs. So, I logged into my router and disabled 'use router as DNS server' and then added Google's primary and secondary servers to the router. My machine now shows the Google servers but the problem persists. \nEDIT #2 - A client has a VPN that I connect to using Juniper Network Connect. Rebooting my machine fixes all network issues, but the second I open Network Connect, it kills it. BUT, if I sign out of Network Connect and close the VPN, the network is still broken, so whatever it changes, does not revert.\n\nA: So, I fixed this issue by changing my internal network to use a different IP address range. From 192.168.* to 10.0.*.\nI'm assuming there was a conflict somewhere.\nAnyway, hopefully this info helps somebody else. \n", "Q: Custom audio guide I know a minister with a graveyard with significant historical value.

Or is it possible to build one easily? If dock icons does not allow placing buttons (I've seen some advanced usages of dock icons like a progress bar or near-real time preview of virtual OS on parallels etc.), we may try to just design a dock icon containing a UI image skin but trying to receive mouse click events by other means (coordinate estimation, etc). I'd also prefer that to have Last.fm support (love/ban the song), rating functionality on dock menu.\n\nA: I am not yet aware of anything like I've mentioned in the question, but HyperDock Mac application seems to be the closest thing to what I want.

I am looking to buy a used iPhone for use on the TracFone network. I am pretty sure that it will run on the network. According to eHow, I can do it with a jailbreak and according to another eHow article, AT&T phones work. Can someone point me in the right direction? Which version of the iPhone (AT&T, Verizon, or Sprint) do I need? How do I get it on the TracFone network?\n\nA: You should be aware that changing the SIM card is not a solution because when you go to activate, Tracfone will ask for the IMEI of the phone and this is a unique to each phone. They have a list of those numbers associated with all the phones they typically sell to the public and the one on your iPhone is not on their list so you cannot activate the service. You should also be advised that changing the IMEI number is a felony. Basically you are not going to meet with success and it is a pity since the Tracfone service is great but the stock phones that go with it are outdated, underpowered and not what many people are willing to settle for.\n\nA: TracFone, per the eHow guide, relies on a SIM card to work. The CDMA standard does not commonly use SIM cards, especially not in America. TracFone also works on pre-iPhone 4 iPhones.\nThe conclusion?\nGet any version of the iPhone, but get a GSM version if a choice needs to be made.\nThe next question is, does TracFone provide a micro-SIM for use in an iPhone 4 / 4S?\n\nA: Now (May 2014), some Verizon CDMA iPhones DO WORK.\nSpecifically, the Tracfone site says that the iPhone 4 and 4S can be activated onto the Tracfone as BYOD phones:\nHere's the link:\nhttps://www.tracfone.com/direct/controller.block?__blockname=direct.byop_cdma_tf.landing&app=TRACFONE&lang=en&init=Y\n\nA: I am currently on an iPhone 4s that has tracfone as my service provider. \nWhat I did was buy an used iPhone 4s off of amazon(make sure it is verizon as Verizon is the only company that will work and also make sure it has a clean esn and everything) then I asked the seller if he could check the meid number on the iPhone to see if it would work with tracfone. It did work and I bought it. \nThen I went onto the website to activate it. You need to buy an airtime card beforehand and have it on hand when activating it. My suggestion is to not activate it online, as I had trouble and ended up calling customer service and having them activate it for me. You need to buy a network access code over the phone or online while activating it. You will need a credit card to buy it. It is 10 dollars plus tax.\nThen I registered an account over the phone and bought an airtime card over the phone because I didn't buy it before hand like I should have. Minutes, data, and texts triple on the iPhone 4s.\nThen I was all done and everything was set up. You just have to call this 2889 number and it sets up calling and texting then you call any number you want and it makes finalization and you're done.\n\nA: I have an Verizon iPhone 4 recently off contract that I JUST activated online with TRACFONE. I did it all on the website, providing them with the IMEI number first to buy the access code then to buy the airtime minutes which TRIPLED into three buckets, talk text and data. It really does work. Phones must not be brand new but previously used on Verizon CDMA Network. See picture included that shows Tracfone activation confirmation text on iPhone.\n\n\nA: Tracfone has a \"bring your own phone plane\" but when asked for the phones info you will see the following notice:\n\nNote: This program will not work with Blackberry or iPhone, nor with Straight Talk, TracFone, Safe Link, NET10 Wireless or Telcel America brand phones.\n\n\nA: It can be done although it is a tedious process. You have to buy an off contract Verizon phone with a clean esn and an activation card. Be prepared to spend about 2 hours on the phone with Trac fone, have all your meid numbers from both your old Trac fone and your new iphone 4 available. \n\nA: As of this writing (October 2016), unlocked AT&T, T-Mobile and other GSM iPhones, as well as Verizon CDMA iPhones, can be used with TracFone without any major issues. Jailbreaking is not required.\nFor GSM devices you will need to purchase a SIM card from them ($1) and then choose an airtime card to activate with. I'd suggest you buy the SIM card and then choose an airtime card during activation, instead of ordering a SIM + airtime package - in the packages, the cost of the SIM ends up being about $10 instead of $1 versus buying the SIM and airtime card individually.\n\nA: just unlock the phone using black rain (its a program you can download), and the problem with not having the micro or nano sim is simple, try googleing \"sim cutter\"\n\nA: It will not work, TracFone is not compatible with iPhone. I have tried to unlock and it works for other carriers, but not TracFone.\n", "Q: Detect installed applications (software dev) on OS X Lion I'm a first time Mac user. \nAside from checking out the installed applications on my Applications folder, are there other ways to find out what applications have been installed on my OS X Lion?\nWhen I tried out the Terminal, and then assumed that the IRB (Interactive Ruby) or Ruby was installed, so I typed \"irb\" and it did work.

I'll review this question, and answers, after 10.8.1 is released. \n\nA: It's difficult to tell if you have a hardware issue or this is just how things are designed.\nHave you read through this article on how Apple detects the first device that requests higher power and enables that power on some, but not all ports?\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Computers and Displays: Powering peripherals through USB\nI know you have linked to it, but the 500 mA is subject to measurement errors on the computer side - so plugging in a device can draw more current than the device says it should. Similarly, the measurement side where the Mac determines the actual power draw could be flakey or failing. This sort of thing isn't tested in the system diagnostics. You would need a test set / oscilloscope / engineering lab to really measure these currents with enough resolution to pin down exactly what is happening.\nIt could be just the order in which the system decides to detect a device attached. Once you have ruled that out and have a repeatable issue - you might need to have the Mac checked for service if it isn't producing power as expected. Now that you know that the order in which devices are plugged can affect things, perhaps this will help narrow down if the enhanced power is correctly available to some (changeable) subset of the ports and hubs made by Apple.\nThere is no easy answer other than being precise and narrowing down exactly which devices are causing errors and statistically determining/isolating whether it's the devices or the port that is out of spec and needs to be replaced.\n\nA: The port may be dirty or worn.\nIn that case it may be a contact issue, the port might have dirt, corrosion, etc. building up on the contacts. I would try cleaning the USB port with an electrical contact cleaner or  isopropyl alcohol and see if the problems persist. If it does then I would suggest there may be an issue with the USB controller or the physical port itself, causing the misbehavior.\nAlso a helpful source on how to clean a USB Port\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Unplug any devices from the USB ports and turn off the computer.\n  \n*Blow compressed air into the USB ports to remove any dirt or dust.\n  \n*Dampen a cotton swab with a small amount of isopropyl alcohol and squeeze out any excess.\n  \n*Wipe the inside of the USB ports gently with a cotton swab. Allow the ports to dry for an hour or two before turning the computer on.\nRead more: How to Clean USB Ports | eHow.com http://www.ehow.com/how_8279912_clean-usb-ports.html#ixzz21djdUf2f\n\n\n", "Q: I lost 2.3 GB after unjailbreak my iPhone 4s I just unjailbreak my iPhone 4s to the original 5.1.1 version. \nI notice the devise is now SUPER slow and also I noticed that the storqage capacity lost 2.3 GB !! \nI have 16 GB iPhone 4s and iTune showing [Capacity 13.62 (.31 other) (13.4 free)]\nThe way I jaibreaked my iPhone is by \n- downloading 5.1.1 from iTune \n- enter the DFU mode, (power button and home button for 10 sec then only home button for 8 sec)\n- click restore \nHow can I unjailbreak my devise in the correct way? (if I did it wrongly)\nWhat is the reason for losing the storage? \n\nA: Whether you're JailBroken or not, and regardless of if you've ever been, you'll never actually see the full 16GB on your iPhone. Part of that 0.31GB of \"Other\" that iTunes reports are the remnants of the JailBreak. Restore iOS again, and then \"Set up as a new phone\" when going through the activation process. You'll never gain back that 2.3GB, because that's what iOS is using to store the operating system. To be more detailed, the 13.62GB of capacity is only the capacity of the User's partition on /var/mobile/. The other 2.3GB is given to / (the System partition).\n\nA: as @gtm said \n\"Possible duplicate of Apple site  - the question itself is different but the answers there answer this question as well\"\n\nA: It could be the traces from the jailbreak, try to restore the device as a New Device\" instead of restoring from the back up and see if you still lost that 2.3GB.

I have noticed that the \"direction cone\" in the Maps app sometimes changes its acuteness: sometimes it will get wider or narrower. The cone seems to represent some sort of accuracy/confidence. I'm particularly interested in what factors (environmental?) alter it.\nWhat causes this? (or am I just imagining that it changes at all?)\n\nA: I believe it's related to the accuracy of the compass.  In my experience, the compass is quite inaccurate and maps do not align perfectly with real life, but usually the actual alignment is somewhere in the cone (I say usually because sometimes they're so inaccurate that it's outside even that, especially when I'm inside a big metal car).  This is similar to the blue circle around the dot that represents uncertainty in your location.\nIt probably changes its acuteness because the compass becomes more and less accurate over time.  The angle of the device may have something to do with this (based on the built-in compass app and personal experience, the compass seems to be more accurate when the device is laid down flat).\n\nA: As far as I noticed, moving the device in place also moves the cone. This would mean that the app is using the Compass in order to determine what you are \"looking at\". I guess what the app is trying to achieve is show your point of view, on the map, so you can easily distinguish objects. I have no idea why it would get wider/narrower, maybe something to do with compass accuracy?\n", "Q: difference between disk size in console vs disk utility Console results df -h\n\ndisk utility results\n\nWhat explains the large difference here in capacity as well as used memory?

In those cases, ⌥ + Clicking the battery icon in the menu bar shows something like this:\n\n\nA: Ask to keep changes when closing documents\nYou can now force Mountain Lion to ask whether you want to keep changes you made to a document when closing it, which effectively allows you to sidestep autosaving.\n\nSystem Preferences > General > [√] Ask to keep changes when saving\n  documents\n\nClearing the checkbox, as shown below, allows unsaved changes to be saved automatically.\n\n\nA: Quickly Renaming Bookmarks in Safari\nWhen you click and hold on a bookmark on the Safari bookmark bar you can quickly rename it.\n\nA: Documents in iCloud\nIf an application is iCloud-savvy, its Open dialog has an iCloud tab. You can not only open documents here, but you can also drag documents into the cloud from the Finder, and you can create folders (drag one document onto another to do so).\n\n\nA: Document auto-locking removed!\nIn Lion, an auto-saved document would automatically lock itself after two weeks of inactivity. (This time interval could be adjust thru a pref hidden deep in Time Machine.) In Mountain Lion, this \"feature\" has been quietly removed; no more auto-locking.\n\nA: Quick access to Accessibility settings\nPress ⌥+⌘+F5 to bring up a new Accessibility Options window that offers quick access to a subset of the settings from the Accessibility prefpane.\n\n\nA: Reading List caches content for offline use\nReading List in Safari is not new (it was introduced in Lion). But in Mountain Lion, a Web page stored in the Reading List stores the page, not just the URL, so you can read the page later without having to download it from the network.\n\nA: When updating apps, Mac App Store reopens apps and offers to skip open apps\nWhen Updating All in the Mac App Store, rather than going straight down the list and demanding you shut down each open app along the way, it offers to let you skip the apps that are running:\n\nEven better, if you do let it close an app, it will automatically reopen it when the update is complete. Furthermore, once you have initiated the update, the apps that are going to be changed are locked and a helpful error message is presented from the App Store if you try to launch an app that is about to be (or in the middle of) being updated. All together, these make updating apps less prone to error or conflicts due to files being in active use during an update.\n\nA: Multiple Time Machine Backup Destinations\nIn Time Machine you can now select multiple backup destinations.\n\n\n\nThat was from the \"OS X Mountain Lion Core Technologies Overview\".\nYou can select additional disks from System Preferences:\n\n\nA: Kernel Exclusively 64-Bit\n\n\"Starting with Mountain Lion, OS X exclusively uses a 64-bit kernel, but it continues to run both 32-bit and 64-bit applications (OS X Mountain Lion Core Technologies Overview)\"\n\nWhy this is a good thing:\n\nThere are two reasons this is a good thing. The first is simple: 64-bit computing is necessary if you want one of the programs on your computer to have access to more than 4GB of RAM. Second, there are some speed boosts associated with running in 64-bit mode. The Intel processors that power Macs have built-in math routines that operate more efficiently in 64-bit mode, processing tasks in fewer steps. That means that certain math-intensive tasks will see a speed boost under Snow Leopard’s 64-bit applications (Macworld).\n\nHowever, having a 64-bit kernel does have its downsides: some older 64-bit computers like the iMac (pre-Mid-2007), Macbook Pro (pre-Mid-2007), Mac Pro (pre-2008), and others are not able to run Mountain Lion. This has to do with the fact that now with Mountain Lion, Macs can only boot into 64-bit mode, but prior to that, Macs could boot into both 32 and 64-bit mode, so older Macs were able to boot into 64-bit mode, but their EFI firmware was 32-bit and therefore can only interface with a 32-bit kernel.\n\nA: You can now silence bouncing application icons in the Dock by just hovering over them, instead of needing to click and activate them.\n\nA: 'Do Not Disturb' Mode for Notification Center\nIn the Notification Center drawer, scroll up a bit past what appears to be the top. There's a switch 'Show Alerts and Banners' that is checked by default. Uncheck it to disable notifications for the rest of the day.\nAlternatively, option-click on the Notification Center menu bar item to activate Do Not Disturb mode quickly.\n\n\nA: You can quickly get rid of a notification by hovering over it and swiping with 2 fingers from left to right (swipe it off the screen)\nAnd if you just want to peek behind it or something you can click and drag it (one finger) to the left and when you let go it will bounce back.\n\nA: Zoom and Mission Control/Launchpad play nice!\nFinally, if you zoom in your screen (for example, by ⌃+scrolling), activating Mission Control or Launchpad doesn't immobilize the viewport!\n\nA: Improved Kernel Security (ASLR)\n\n\"Apple introduced randomization of some library offsets in Mac OS X v10.5 (released October 2007). Their implementation does not provide complete protection against attacks which ASLR is designed to defeat.Mac OS X Lion 10.7 has improved ASLR implementation for all applications. Apple explains that \"address space layout randomization (ASLR) has been improved for all applications. It is now available for 32-bit apps (as are heap memory protections), making 64-bit and 32-bit applications more resistant to attack.\" Since OS X Mountain Lion 10.8 the kernel as well as kexts and zones are randomly relocated during system boot\" (Address Space Layout Randomization).\n\nThis is beneficial in that it protects the user against the malware exploits that rely on fixed locations for some well-known system functions.\n\nA: Exposé for all windows\nMountain Lion re-introduces the pre-Lion feature to be able to disable group by application in Mission Control, this was enabled by default in Lion and could not be disabled.\nYou can disable this in: System Preferences → Mission Control → Group windows by application.\n\n\nA: Save As\n...is back!\nTry the following keyboard shortcut: option-shift-command-S.

You can check for updates like this (which opens the App Store):\n\nPrior to Mountain Lion, software updates took place in a separate application that looked like this:\n\n\nA: Click-and-hold to toggle Notification Center\nClick-and-hold the Notification Center icon to show your notifications; once you release the mouse button, they'll hide. This also works if you've assigned a keyboard shortcut for Notification Center (press-and-hold the key, then release).\n\nA: Browse through photos in screensavers via keyboard\nIn any of the various photo screensavers, you can hit the left or right arrow keys to manually navigate between photos.\n\nA: Photo Stream and other screen savers\nMountain Lion includes a bunch of new kinetic photo-based screen savers.\nYou can select from several categories of stock images or choose a folder, iPhoto event, or Photostream as the source of images.\nGo to System Preferences -> Desktop and Screen Saver -> Screen Saver and select one of the screen savers in the Slideshows category to try them out.\nPersonally, I'm a fan of Shifting Tiles.\n\n\nA: Re-enable Web Sharing for individual users\nMay be more a \"feature\" than a feature, but anyway:\nPer-user Web Sharing is gone from Preferences but can be easily re-enabled via Terminal.app. Copy the following snippet into /etc/apache2/users/USER.conf:\n<Directory \"/Users/USER/Sites/\">\n    Options Indexes MultiViews\n    AllowOverride AuthConfig Limit\n    Order allow,deny\n    Allow from all\n</Directory>\n\nand restart Apache with sudo apachectl restart.\n\nA: Enhancements to Launchpad\nThere's now a search bar on top, and when you mouse over the Launchpad icon while an app is downloading, you get progress information:\n \n\nA: The Mac App Store can be navigated with two-finger swipes\nBack and forward are (finally) bound to the two-finger swipe gestures in the MAS just like they are in Safari.\n\nA: AirPlay Everywhere\nAirPlay devices like Apple TV and Airport Express now show as system audio output devices, so any audio on your Mac can be streamed to them.

Press ⇧⌘4 to enter screenshot mode, then press space to select a window, like normal. However, instead of simply clicking to take the screenshot, ⌥-click the window to take the screenshot without the shadow.\n\n\nOn the left is the default style of screenshot; on the right is the sans-shadow screenshot.\n\nA: Navigate through a PDF in Mail.app by scrolling the mouse while hovering over it\nThe need to open a PDF in Preview/Quickview just in order to see pages other than the first one, is now gone.\n\nA: When Show contact photos in the message list is enabled, user image additions/edits from Contacts.app are updated immediately in Mail.app (not after relaunch, as in Lion)\n\n\nA: In Mission Control, holding option will immediately show the + icon for adding a new desktop and X icons on each secondary desktop. You can then click these icons immediately, instead of hovering and waiting for them to appear after a delay.\n", "Q: Proper backup procedure for upgrading to OS X Mountain Lion I'm rarely an early adopter of new software, but I'm taking the plunge today and buying Mountain Lion. I don't know if it will break anything important (I run a few rather obscure programs on my mid-2011 Macbook Air), nor if I will like it. I have a current Time Machine backup, but no bootable clone. I can afford to be without the use of my computer for a few hours should things go horribly wrong and I need to restore it.\nI'm considering charging ahead and installing Mountain Lion with just a Time Machine backup (in part so I can get up and answering ML questions on this site!). Is this a reasonable course of action or incredibly stupid, and if so, what should I be doing instead?\n\nA: Here are the things you'll want in case things don't go well with the install over your internal drive with your apps, settings and files:\n\n\n*\n\n*An external USB drive with a Recovery HD (4 GB is plenty for this)\n\n*Time (Downloads could be slow and error prone today)\n\n\nDive in is my advice given your recent hardware, speed of the machine and storage and the framing of your question (you've asked the right details to be aware of the potential downsides).\nDo try booting to the recovery USB drive once and see that it shows your Time Machine drive as a valid place to restore Lion. I have had people find one USB port was dead when they tried to use both - I know this is paranoid, but update time is when most people find out about issues (software corruption and hardware problems) since it changes things at a very low level. Machines can be infirm enough to keep running and fail when faced with a re-install or migration of data that a major OS upgrade entails.\n\nIf you were paranoid, you could also add another external drive with 20GB free to your list of things needed. Just installing a clean version of Mountain Lion is always safer than installing onto a system with data and settings. By migrating the contents over to be sure all your third party apps are ready for the new OS. This is a nice alternative to making a bootable backup.\nRe-doing the installer a few days later on your internal drive is easy work (or using Disk Utility to erase the internal drive and \"restore\" the external image to the internal drive doesn't take that long for Air sized images.\n\n\nA: I agree with all recommendations. I was one of those unlucky enough for Mountain Lion not to like my internal hard drive, resulting on a panic kernel error upon trying to reboot. Suppossedly because it had problems with permissions requiring repairs.\nFortunately I had an external thunderbolt hard drive to reboot from. None of the supposed permissions problems were confirmed with Disk Utility.\nNevertheless I decided to reformat the internal hard drive and perform a clean install of Mac OS X Lion.\nI will then restore the Time Machine backup I had just made before attempting the upgrade to a Mountain Lion.\nI guess the time is not yet ripe enough for me to risk an upgrade...\n\nA: Your solution seems good enough Time Machine only, however I would recommend an additional bootable clone of your primary OS drive would be more ideal, allowing you to just boot up from  or clone the non upgraded copy to the primary drive if needed. \n\n\n*\n\n*The advantage is you would be exactly where you left off at before upgrading to 10.8, as opposed to a potentially different restored time machine state, that may or may not be missing some minor settings. \n\n*This should save you in the worst case situation, since you would not have to re-install 10.7 and then try to restore from Time Machine backup.   \n\n*Its an extra backup up copy, the more copies the better...\n", "Q: Can I resume an interrupted download of Mac OS X Mountain Lion? I have a slow internet connection. I want to download Mountain Lion (Mac OS X 10.8) from the Mac App Store and resume the download if it gets interrupted because of my internet connection.\nDoes the Mac App Store allow resuming broken downloads?\n\nA: Yes - the App store handles interrupted purchases without intervention in most cases. There is a support article if you want to nudge things or it manages to wedge itself.\nYou don't have to let the download complete on iOS or Mac OS X and can control things on the Mac side of the store much better than on iOS.\n\nA: The Mac App Store does allow to resume a download, however things do not seem to work out always as expected - to be safe download it all in one piece.\nYesterday, I downloaded Mountain Lion from the Mac App Store - halted it - and resumed later without having restarted the Mac. The whole download started over. This is not the first time I have encountered it - therefore I do not take the pause/resume feature for granted.\n \n", "Q: Why does my home directory location keep reverting to the previous setting? I have two hard drives in my MacBook Pro: one is a solid state drive that holds the OS and Applications, the other a spinning platter drive that holds my home directory.\nI currently have /Users/ian as a symlink to  /Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/ian.\nAnd in my user profile my home directory is /Users/ian:\n\nWhen I change the Home directory field to /Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/ian and perform the requested restart of my machine, after I log back in, my home directory is set back to /Users/ian.\nWhy won't my changes to this setting stick?\n\nA: I suspect the problem was me trying to change my home directory from my account. I was able to make it work by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Creating a new user on the system\n\n*Giving that new user Administrator privileges\n\n*Logging out of my account\n\n*Logging in to the new user account\n\n*Editing my account's home directory from the new account\n\n\nAfter that was done the changes stuck and my home directory is now on my HD instead of SSD. I kept the other account around for now, though I stripped it of Adminstrator privileges.\n", "Q: Can I update to OS X 10.8 from OS X 10.7 without doing all softwares updates? Do I have to perform all system updates to Lion before I update to Mountain Lion?\n\nA: Yes, I was able to update from 10.7.3 to 10.8 without running software updates (10.7.4) and Mountain Lion runs great.\n\nA: Yes since you are running 10.7.x you can update straight to Mountain Lion and not have to update to the latest version of OS X Lion first. This capability to jump from any version of Lion to Mountain Lion is noted in how to upgrade to Mountain Lion.\n\n...\nStep 2:\n  Make sure you have Lion or the latest version of Snow Leopard ...\nIf you are running Lion (10.7.x), you’re ready to update to Mountain Lion. Go to Step 3. If you are running Snow Leopard (10.6.x), update to the latest version of OS X Snow Leopard before you purchase OS X Mountain Lion from the Mac App Store.

In my case,  purchased OS X Lion with my Apple ID, one of my family signed to my account once in order to download Lion, but they can update their system using the the classic Software Update utility afterwards. Now it seems they'll need to sign into my account every time for any update, or we'll have to create a new Apple ID just for this purpose.\n\nA: The term Software Update does appear in the  menu, but clicking it opens the Updates tab in the App Store app.\n\n\n\nA: OS updates are in a different group in the Mac App Store, and neither checking for them nor downloading them requires you to be logged in to any account at all, so you should not have any problems.\nAlso note that you could simply enable automatic updates in System Preferences to avoid having to manage OS updates yourself.\n", "Q: Move iPhone notes to iCloud I have OS X 10.8, and there is an empty list of notes on my Mac. But I have some notes on my iPhone, which are not in iCloud. Instead, they are local notes in the \"On My iPhone\" folder. How to move them into iCloud?\n\nA: Using OSX 10.8 it is simply not possible at the moment, what you need to do is to access a Mac running 10.7 or lower and sync them to that Mac and move them to an IMAP notes account. Then, you can access the IMAP notes in 10.8 Notes app and drag them all to iCloud. The only manual part necessary is to remove the duplicate notes left \"On your iPhone\" - they need to be removed one by one (or simply left alone).\nDetails:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off iCloud Notes sync (Settings -> iCloud -> Notes switch to Off)\n\n*Set up an IMAP account in Mail on both computers (running 10.7 and 10.8)\n\n*Set up iTunes synchronization with the Mac running 10.7 (Make sure to select to synchronize Notes in iTunes)\n\n*Synchronize with iTunes\n\n*Go to Mail in 10.7 and drag the notes \"On your Mac\" to the IMAP notes folder\n\n*Turn on iCloud Notes sync (Settings -> iCloud -> Notes switch to On)\n\n*Open the Notes app in 10.8 and drag the notes from your IMAP notes account to the iCloud notes account\n\n*(Optional) Switch to your \"On my iPhone\" notes account and remove all notes, one-by-one, in order to avoid confusion later.\n\n*On your phone, make sure that you are using the iCloud notes account (Notes -> Accounts -> iCloud) when using notes\n\n\nA: Just make sure that you have your iCloud notes sync enabled on your iPhone as per:\nTransfer iPhone notes via iCloud \nNote that notes which were already on your iPhone before you enabled iCloud Notes sync will not automatically sync to your iCloud account. \nWhat I would do in your case is simply email the notes to your @me.com account which you created just before you enabled iCloud Notes sync. This should move these specific notes to your iCloud account.\n\nA: Make sure that \"Notes\" is enabled in the iCloud settings on iOS.\nSecondly, you will have to upgrade your notes to the new iOS 9 / OS X El Capitan version (if you haven't already). In the top level of your iOS Notes app (tap the Accounts button), you will have a little button that allows you to upgrade your iCloud notes. (More info here: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204987)\nFinally, go into your \"On My iPhone\" notes folder, then select \"Move All\" (or select specific notes to move) and select your iCloud Notes folder as the destination.\n(Thank you to 'airplay' of http://discussions.apple.com/thread/4961565 for the original advice)\n\nA: If you've got other mail accounts set up on your iPhone, the notes might be synced into that account rather than your iCloud account. The problem is that there's no way, that I've found, on an iPhone anyway to move your notes from one account to another.\nIf they are synced into, let's say, Gmail, you may be able to log into your Gmail account online and copy them manually into the Notes.app on 10.8.\nThe other problem may be that your notes are automatically stored \"On My iPhone\" rather than your iCloud account. You can find this out if you go into your Settings, then the Notes section.\nIf this is the case, your best bet will be to copy the notes individually, and recreate them under the iCloud account. It would also be a good idea to set the default to iCloud from now on. \n\nA: If you can sync the notes from your iPhone to your mac and Notes App, you can move them to iCloud by selecting the small drawer icon located at the bottom of the Notes App. That should open a drawer which shows local notes and iCloud notes. Then use drag'n'drop to move them\n\nA: There are two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*You need an Apple ID/iCloud account to make sure the notes sync!\n\n*But if you already have a @me.com email, and you're logged in, it still doesn't show up! Well, in system preferences, in iCloud, make sure \"notes\" are checked on all your devices\n\nA: I agree, you must check how many Notes accounts you have on your iPhone. To do so go to your Notes app and tap on \"Accounts\" on the upper right cornder. If you see On My iPhone, then you can do the following:\nSome people have found that the issue was sorted once they disabled iCloud Notes sync on the iPhone and re-enabled it. Therefore, go to Settings > iCloud and toggle the Notes switch from ON to OFF and then back to ON. This chould sync your entire set of iPhone notes to your iCloud account.\n\nA: I found a way to extract the old notes from the backup of an iOS 7 device, and then import them into the Notes app on a mac (where you can reupload to iCloud if you like).\nFirst find the folder where iTunes stores the backup of the phone. For me it was:\n/Users/myself/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/89e6c98d92887913cadf06b2adb97f26cde4849b\n\nOpen a command line terminal, and use grep to search for files containing ZNOTEBODY:\ngrep ZNOTEBODY -r /Users/myself/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/89e6c98d92887913cadf06b2adb97f26cde4849b\n\nFor me this reported ca3bc056d4da0bbf88b5fb3be254f3b7147e639c\nThen create a php file extractnotes.php containing the following code:\n<?php\n$file = '/Users/myself/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/89e6c98d92887913cadf06b2adb97f26cde4849b/2b66fd261ee5c6cfc8de7fa466bab600bcfe4f69';\n$sqlite = new PDO('sqlite:' . $file);\n$query = 'SELECT ztitle, zcontent from znotebody JOIN ZNOTE USING(z_pk) ORDER BY zmodificationdate';\n$rs = $sqlite->query($query);\n$data = $rs->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_NUM);\nforeach( $data as $row ) {\n    file_put_contents('/Users/myself/Desktop/notes/' . str_replace( '/', '_', $row[0] ) . '.html', $row[1] );\n    sleep(1);\n}\n?>\n\nand run it via php extractnotes.php - making sure to update the folder names.\nYou can then use the Notes app on macOS to import the entire folder of notes.\n", "Q: Spotlight in upper right screen corner in Mountain Lion In the System Preferences panel for Spotlight in OS X 10.8, it claims \"Spotlight is located at the top right corner of the screen\". On my system, this no longer appears to be true; the Notification Center menubar icon has claimed that particular piece of prime real estate. There is precisely one pixel that is \"at\" the top right corner. Spotlight is still near the top right corner, but the top right pixel no longer triggers Spotlight.\nHas anyone discovered a way to make the Spotlight icon appear where it used to (preferably without disabling Notification Center, which is indeed useful but doesn't need that particular spot)?\n\n\nA: It used to be the realm of the first menu-bar item to start the got the prized first (last?) slot in the menu bar.  But since Spotlight, it's always had the prime location to itself.  Now it's been usurped.  That's not to say that some command line hack won't turn up that can change things, but as things stand there is no officially supported/provided way of doing this via a preference pane.\nBut I wouldn't actually go looking - the whole point of the spotlight button is to allow you to type in some search criteria.  As such, why click the icon, then move to the keyboard - just use the provided keyboard shortcut instead - command+space is not only the easiest to remember (for me) it's also the easiest to pull off even if you are terrible at remembering shortcuts.  I use it as my command launcher these days, just command+space+\"sa\"+return starts Safari up faster than mousework for me.\n\nA: This isn't my ideal answer, because it eliminates not only the Notification Center icon, but Notification Center itself. But for anyone desperate to get Spotlight back in the top corner, here goes:\nWarning:\nThis involves hacking your System folder; make appropriate backups and proceed with caution!\nTo disable Notification Center entirely (which will cause its icon to not appear in the Menu Bar), you can go to /System/Library/CoreServices and select Notification Center.app. Press ⌘I to Get Info. Click the Lock icon at the bottom of the screen to unlock the settings (you will be prompted for your password). In the Sharing and Permissions portion of the pane, click the plus sign. Add your account as a special user, then set the Privilege column to Read & Write for yourself. Then, in the Name and Extension field, add the letter x to the beginning of the file name, dismissing any warnings the system throws your way.\nReboot the system.\nNote that this eliminates the icon, but also all Notification Center functionality.\nSpotlight does, however, return to its proper place. Not worth it for me, but someone might find this helpful.\n\nA: Bartender is an app, presently in beta, that allows you to hide the notification center menubar item, among other menu bar-tending tasks. Notification Center is hidden (and so Spotlight is rightmost), but I still get notifications!\n\nA: I haven't had a chance to test it myself on the Notification Center icon, but have you tried Broomstick?\nhttp://www.zibity.com/broomstick\nI've used it to successfully hide just about every other app that I didn't want hanging around in the menubar.\n\nA: Unfortunately I lack time so I'll post a raw idea. Hope somebody will benefit from this one.\nWhy don't we replace existing Notification Center icon with an empty one and create another application with regular menubar icon which opens and hides Notification Center?\nIcons for on/off/pressed states can be found under\n/System/Library/CoreServices/NotificationCenter.app/Contents/Resources/\n\nWe'll need to generate a blank .tiff file and place it instead of current icons. Hopefully 0x0 tiff will be rendered correctly.\nAlso it could be hard to show/hide Notification Center programmatically from our statusbar application.\nBy the way I tried to track Bartender.app file changes with\niosnoop\n\nto find a .plist file responsible for the notification center icon position but found nothing.\n", "Q: Does Mountain lion download Apple's JDK or the OpenJDK when attempting to load a Java app? When you first try and load a Java application (eclipse, run mvn commands etc) Lion prompted you to download a JRE/JDK. From my understanding this is still Apple's version of Java and not OpenJDK.  Will Mountain Lion still have Apple's Java available the same way or will it prompt you to download OpenJDK?\n\nA: It prompts you (just tried to open Aptana).

When you first launch an app that requires X11 libraries, you are directed to a download location for the most up-to-date version of X11 for Mac.\n\nDoes anyone know how to download X11 for Mountain Lion?\n\nA: If Apple's dialog for X11 does not appear, you can grab the package directly from the XQuartz website.\nVersion 2.7.1 was the first to support Mountain Lion, but 2.7.2 is the current release as of this writing.\n\nA: Normally, Mountain Lion should show the following window:\n\nClicking Continue just takes you to http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5293, so simply go there for official instructions for installing X11.\n", "Q: Where are system environment variables set in Mountain Lion? In Lion (and previous releases) it was in .MacOSX/environment.plist. After upgrading to 10.8, the file is still there, but the variables aren’t taking.  \nI’ve also tried adding them to /etc/launchd.conf and they’ll show up in  Terminal, but not GUI applications (like my IDE).  \n\nA: Setting environment variables in /etc/launchd.conf is the way to go: Every application launched after a reboot by local shells, Finder or Spotlight inherits these variables - I have tested this extensively with Mountain Lion 10.8.3.\n2 caveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shells might overwrite the settings in their login scripts. (See For correct functioning in shells though...)\n\n*Launched apps might not expose the environment to their children. (ssh seems to behave like this - see ...why do remote shells via ssh do NOT inherit the environment...)\n\n\nA: Try launchctl setenv NAME VALUE. I don't know if/what it does differently from editing launchd.conf, but it works for me in both Terminal and GUI apps. More details.\nNote this doesn't survive across a reboot. Here's a way to fix that.\n\nA: I know this is an old question but I thought I would point out that in Yosemite /etc/launchd.conf no longer works (as confirmed by the man page). So here is an alternative.\nLaunch AppleScript Editor, enter a command like this:\ndo shell script \"launchctl setenv variablename value\"\n\n(add as many lines as you like)\nNow save (⌘S) as File format: Application. Finally open System Settings → Users & Groups → Login Items and add your new application.\n\nA: I asked this question on the Apple Developer Forums as well and got back this, official response.\n\nChange the Info.plist of the .app itself to contain an \"LSEnvironment\"\n  dictionary with the environment variables you want.\n  ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist is no longer supported.\n\n\nA: As you have discovered, the use of environment.plist file is no longer followed, the variables stored in Info.plist as LSEnvironment strings are only set by launchd.\nYou cannot depend on them to set a general environment variable that the terminal will set if you call your program from the terminal/shell directly. The good news is the open -a command does trigger launchd to do the launching, so the variables will be set consistently for the app environment if not for the local shell environment.\n", "Q: Which Macs cannot upgrade to Mountain Lion?

I just upgraded to Mountain Lion, and now gcc, make, g++, etc. are not found when trying to launch them in Terminal.\nSo I went to Xcode Preferences, Downloads, and clicked \"Install\" next to Command Line Tools.\nIt asked me for my Apple ID, which is weird and unnecessary, but I entered it anyway. Note that I am a registered Mac OS X and iOS developer (so I pay 2x $99 per year).\nMuch to my surprise, it tells me:\n\nUm, what?! And why is it asking? \n\nA: It thankfully seems that this was a temporary issue, probably due to the increased load on the Apple servers on Mountain Lion's release day.\nI am now able to download the Command Line Tools as before so it seems the issue has gone away.\nAlternatively, if you're still having problems, this link worked for me when the \"Install\" button in Xcode didn't.\n", "Q: Is there a way to install Mountain Lion on a Mac Pro 1,1 2006? The Mac Pro 1,1 2006 is not officially supported for OS X Mountain Lion, are there any work arounds to get it to work?\n\nYour Mac must be one of the following models:\n...\nMac Pro (Early 2008 or newer)\n...\n\n\nA: Yes its possible. The limitations that need to be over came are three fold. \n\nThere are two things that prevent 10.8 from installing on a MacPro 1,1.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The first is the lack of EFI64. Mountain Lion as has no support for 32bit kernel and extensions so it will not boot. This is true of many early Intel macs.\n  \n*The other thing is that checks are made by the installer; against a supported machines list. If your mac isn’t on the list, it refuses to install.\nIt’s important to note that an upgraded graphics card is virtually essential. The stock 7300 GT isn’t supported and will cause Kernel Pannic. I don’t think the X1900-xt is either, my 8800GT did odd things on DP1 but may be OK on newer builds. Ideally Id try and source a HD5770 or other newer card. \n\nSolutions:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*New compatible graphics card will need to be obtained.\n  \n*The first issue can be dealt with by using the Chameleon bootloader. Chameleon will emulate EFI64 and therefore load 10.8.\n  \n*Customization of the 10.8 Installer by adding your machine kind back onto the list of supported machines. \n\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.j4mie.co.uk/blog/2012/02/18/how-to-install-mountain-lion-on-macpro11/\n\n*http://www.jabbawok.net/?p=47\n", "Q: How to revert to Lion from Mountain Lion? I'm running a Mid-2011 Macbook Air, my first Mac.  When I bought it, it had Lion pre-installed.  Yesterday I picked up an external hard drive, and made my first Time Machine backup.  In the next few days I plan on going to Mountain Lion, but am trying to be cautious.\nIf I have issues with Mountain Lion, and want to revert to Lion, what steps can I take now to ensure that I don't lose anything when going back to Lion?  Will a Time Machine backup + the Lion Recovery disk maintain all my documents/data/settings?  So, I'd have a Time Machine backup of my post-update Mountain Lion system, will Lion/Time Machine be able to take all the documents and data that were created under Mountain Lion and restore them to my system after reverting to Lion?\nEssentially, I'd like to know what other steps I can take now, while I have Lion, that will make this hypothetical reversion a smoother experience.  Is my plan of Time Machine + Lion Recovery disk fundamentally flawed in some fashion?\nedit:  As discussed in the comments, I've made a TM backup, and made a Lion Recovery disk.  I went forward with Mountain Lion's install.  I see in the Mac App Store, that I have ML available to redownload, but there's no option there for Lion (which I was sort of expecting, but now have confirmation).  Looks like the only way to reinstall Lion at this point is to use that recovery disk.\n\nA: The Time Machine backup should do a pretty good job keeping all of your documents and most of your settings and should be backwards-compatible*, but I recommend making a complete, bootable backup of your previous system so that you're guaranteed to be able to restore your machine to exactly as it was before updating.\nI'm a fan of Carbon Copy Cloner (free trial) for making the backup. Back up to a clean disk or partition using CCC and tell it to copy everything. It will also help you \nclone your Lion Recovery HD onto the backup disk.\nOnce the backup is done be sure to try booting from it to make sure everything worked.\n*Should be, but I haven't personally tested.\n\nA: The combination of four questions is good, but that number – and the major differences between the operating systems – makes it difficult to give a single concise or comprehensive answer. \nSome of the four here overlap with questions elsewhere in Ask Different. I'll focus on two …\n\n\nWill a Time Machine backup + the Lion Recovery disk maintain all my documents/data/settings?\n\nFor this case, considering the unknowns, I should say no. Apple's standard exclusions apply. \nIf you encounter a problem relating to downgrade, and if you wish to use logs for diagnosis, the required data – the logs – may be not amongst your backups. \n\n\nIf I have issues with Mountain Lion, and want to revert to Lion, what steps can I take with Lion to ensure that I don't lose anything when going back to Lion?\n\nIf your concerns include consequences of a major downgrade from Mountain Lion – consequences such as loss or multiplication – then you must think beyond actions in Lion. Think also of …\nActions to be performed in Mountain Lion\nAt least: \n\n\n*\n\n*for each Apple app included with the operating system that you will use in Lion, see whether its equivalent in Mountain Lion can export to a suitable format. \n\n\nApplication-specific formats that are designed for export and import\nTo minimise the risks associated with downgrades, I guess that:\n\n\n*\n\n*an archive produced by Calendar in Mountain Lion should be usable without issue in iCal in Lion\n\n*an archive produced by Contacts in Mountain Lion should be usable without issue in Address Book in Lion\n\n\n– and so on, but see below concerning potential duplication of data. \nI can't guess what apps you might use so I'll list only those two. \nMixtures of local and remote data\nIf your Calendar 6.x stores calendar and reminder data both on your Mac and on servers – CalDAV, Exchange Web Services etc., then for downgrade purposes you may wish to produce two archives – one with service accounts such as iCloud enabled, another with service accounts disabled. \nThe second, smaller archive may be a more suitable starting point for import to iCal 5.x. \n(I can't predict how iCal will deal with potential duplication from a larger archive that includes data from servers.)\nAnd so on, for Contacts and for other export-enabled apps that can use services such as iCloud. \nHint\nIf you use iCloud alone, without using your Mac for local primary storage:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple's use of CalDAV and CardDAV should effectively remove any concerns you may have about downgrade compatibility of local archives and application support data from Calendar and Contacts.\n\n\n\nAll things considered\nI should paraphrase advice given elsewhere: \n\n\n*\n\n*please do not assume that a major downgrade will be entirely free from difficulty. \n\n\nA: Once install Mountain Lion, the recovery will be replaced with Mountain Lion recovery. What you can do is that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into recovery mode and format your SSD.\n\n*Reboot and wait for your machine to download Lion Recovery again from Internet.\n\n*Use Lion recovery to recover your Mac.\n\n*Use TimeMachine backup to restore your documents.\n\n\nA: Machines with 10.8 installed from factory do not take kindly to downgrade attempts. Even with a fresh SSD and multiple USB boot drives of older versions of OS X I was unable to boot. Seems the firmware will only accept 10.8 in the newest Macs. \n", "Q: How do I check the download progress of Mountain Lion through the terminal? I am downloading Mountain Lion, I know I can monitor download progress through the Mac App Store purchases screen but I want to know if I can monitor progress through Terminal.app using a shell command.\n\nA: Sure - the storeagent uses a folder deep within /private/var/folders to hold the download progress.\nOn my Mac it's downloading to this folder below - yours may change, but you should be able to search for the com.apple.appstore using mdfind and use du or ls to see the file size grow.\n/private/var/folders/tv/xyw2rpln7hq4gw2m0prg_src0000gn/C/com.apple.appstore/497799835\n\nThe App Store has a nicer wrapper on the progress with a time estimate, but with bc and other tools, you could do the same in a short shell script exercise. \n\nIf you can't locate your folder, this find command might be of use to narrow down your search....\nsudo find /var/folders -type d -name com.apple.appstore -print\n\n\nA: I decided that the best way to identify the file being downloaded was to write a small script that fetched the files held open by the App Store program storeagen.  \n#!/bin/bash\nappstore_pid=$(ps -ef|grep storeagen|grep -v grep|awk '{print $2}')\nlsof -p $appstore_pid|grep private|awk '{print $7 \"\\t\" $9}'\n\nI set appstore_pid variable to the PID of storeagen by extracting it from the ps command using grep and awk\nThen I use lsof to list open files by the PID of storeagen and I print out the size of the files and the files path.  If you do this several times in succession you can see the file(s) that's growing and make a good guess by its size that it is the OS download.  \n\nA: I just used the activity monitor and watched how much data transfer was happening...\nAnd ensure no other traffic at the time of download. Its not perfect, but gives you a general idea something is happening.\n", "Q: Include Images with Reply in Mail?

No 3rd-party libraries or apps required and is completely portable for use on other systems. 10.9 notification on the top, 10.10 DP in the middle, 10.10 on the bottom.\nAppleScript can be run from the shell using /usr/bin/osascript:\nosascript -e 'display notification \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\" with title \"Title\"'\n\nYou can also customise the alert further by adding…\n\n\n*\n\n*a subtitle\nAppend 'subtitle' followed by the string or variable containing the subtitle.\ndisplay notification \"message\" with title \"title\" subtitle \"subtitle\"\n\nThe above example produces the following notification:\n\n\n*sound\nAppend 'sound name' followed by the name of a sound that will be played along with the notification.\ndisplay notification \"message\" sound name \"Sound Name\"\n\nValid sound names are the names of sounds located in…\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Sounds\n\n*/System/Library/Sounds\n\nPosting notifications can be wrapped as a command-line script. The following code can be run in Terminal and will add a script to /usr/local/bin (must exist, add to $PATH) called notify.\ncd /usr/local/bin && echo -e \"#!/bin/bash\\n/usr/bin/osascript -e \\\"display notification \\\\\\\"\\$*\\\\\\\"\\\"\" > notify && chmod +x notify;cd -\n\nThis is the script that the above will add to notify.\n#!/bin/bash\n/usr/bin/osascript -e \"display notification \\\"$*\\\"\"\n\nNow to display a notification:\nnotify Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\nsleep 5; notify Slow command finished\n\n\nA: Official documentation\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/MacAutomationScriptingGuide/DisplayNotifications.html\nCopying the text here, in case the document is moved or removed.\n\nTo show a notification, provide the display notification command with a string to display. Optionally, provide values for the with title, subtitle, and sound name parameters to provide additional information and an audible alert when the notification appears\ndisplay notification \"All graphics have been converted.\" with title \"My Graphic Processing Script\" subtitle \"Processing is complete.\" sound name \"Frog\"\n\nNOTE\nAfter using a script to display a notification, the script or Script Editor (if the script is run from within Script Editor) is added to the list of notifying apps in System Preferences > Notifications. There, you can configure options, such as whether to display notifications as alerts or banners.\nClicking the Show button in an alert-style notification opens the app that displayed the notification. For a script app, the action of opening the app again triggers the run handler of the script, potentially causing the script to begin processing a second time. Keep this in mind, and add code to your script to handle this scenario, if appropriate.\n\n\nA: Thank you, this was just what I needed for some user scripts. I made a slight modification to add a subtitle and sound. If a value is not provided, it is ignored.\nfunction _sys_notify() {\nlocal notification_command=\"display notification \\\"$2\\\" with title \\\"$1\\\" subtitle \\\"$3\\\" sound name \\\"$4\\\"\"\nosascript -e \"$notification_command\"\n}\n\nalias sys-notify=\"_sys_notify $1 $2 $3 $4\"\n\nFor the sound, use a sound filename without the extension from /System/Library/Sounds. For example, to use the file Ping.aiff, use Ping for $4\n\nA: I just want to add a note to @grgarside's answer, because I know many people want to have a notification popup that can only be dismissed by button click.\n\nI have found the solution for you:\nIt was actually controlled by a setting in System Preference, rather than some parameter in the script written. These two images should explain it all\nThanks @grgarside for the great answer.\n\n\nA: If you want sticky notifications (Vic Jang's comment seems to no longer work, at least in Big Sur), here's a kind of way, use dialog instead of notification:\nosascript -e 'display dialog \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\" with title \"Title\"'\nSo you could do one display notification then follow it up with the dialog.\nAlso alerter does sticky.\n$ brew install alerter\n$ alerter -message \"hi\"\n\n\nA: You can now do this with Growl2 (available from the App Store). Install Growl and enable \"OS X Notifications\" (screenshot)\n\nAdditionally, you'll need to install GrowlNotify for a command-line tool to send Growl notifications. You can download this tool for free on the Download page.\nYou can now generate Growl notifications from the command line, which will be forwarded to the Notification Center. For example:\ngrowlnotify -n \"My App\" -m \"Hello world\"\n\n\nNote that it currently doesn't seem possible to change the application icon.\n\nA: @grgarside's solution is nice, but it is vulnerable to script injection, which can be a major security issue when this is used to e.g. display log file contents or something similar.\nThis should be safer:\n#!/bin/bash\nX=\"$*\" /usr/bin/osascript -e 'display notification system attribute \"X\"'\n\n\nA: I recently forked terminal-notifier to build a command line tool to display notification Alerts (with actions) and Reply Type Alerts.\nI use it with my shell scripts and golang apps to get interactive answers from users.\nhttps://github.com/vjeantet/alerter\n\n\nA: (This is an alternative implementation based on @grgarside's excellent answer.)\nAppleScript can be interpreted directly by putting osascript in the shebang line.\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\n\non run argv\n    if length of argv = 1 then\n        display notification (item 1 of argv) with title \"Notification\"\n    else if length of argv > 1 then\n        display notification (item 1 of argv) with title (item 2 of argv)\n    else\n        return \"<message> is required\\nUsage: notify <message> [<title>]\"\n    end if\nend run\n\nSave this as notify somewhere in your path, e.g., /usr/local/bin/notify, and make it executable (chmod +x notify).  It accepts a message and an optional title.  If either has whitespace, wrap it in quotes so the shell interprets it as a single argument.\n$ notify \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\" \"Testing Notifications\"\n\n\nA: Since Growl is not free, and terminal-notifier is not available on pre-10.8 systems, I tend to use cocoaDialog. It is free and open source, so you can probably also distribute along with your scripts.\nIf you don't need a lot of customization, you can also use AppleScript's display notification which you can also call from the shell as others have already mentioned.\nBut beware that AppleScript seems to require double-quotes. So if you need variables, this will not work:\nosascript -e \"display notification '$text' with title '$title'\" #WRONG\n\nYou will have to use escaped double-quotes. This is ugly but works:\nosascript -e \"display notification \\\"$text\\\" with title \\\"$title\\\"\"\n\n\nA: terminal-notifier\nFrom the README:\n\nterminal-notifier is a command-line tool to send Mac OS X User\n  Notifications, which are available in Mac OS X 10.8.\nIt is currently packaged as an application bundle, because\n  NSUserNotification does not work from a ‘Foundation tool’.\n  radar://11956694\nThis tool will be used by Kicker to\n  show the status of commands which are executed due to filesystem\n  changes. (v3.0.0)\nDownload\nPrebuilt binaries, which are code-signed and ready to use, are\n  available from the downloads\n  section.\nUsage\n$ ./terminal-notifier.app/Contents/MacOS/terminal-notifier\n  group-ID sender-name message [bundle-ID]\nIn order to use terminal-notifier, you have to call the binary\n  inside the app bundle.\nThe first argument specifies the ‘group’ a notification belongs to.\n  For any ‘group’ only one notification will ever be shown, replacing\n  previously posted notifications. Examples are: the sender’s process ID\n  to scope the notifications by a unique process, or the current working\n  directory to scope notifications by a project.\nThe second and third arguments describe the notification itself and\n  are its ‘title’ and ‘message’ respectively. For example, to\n  communicate the sender of a notification to the user, you could\n  specify the sender’s name as the title.\nThe fourth and last argument is an optional one. It specifies which\n  application should be activated when the user clicks the notification.\n  By default this will activate Terminal.app, to launch another\n  application instead specify the application’s bundle identifier. For\n  example, to launch Safari.app use: com.apple.Safari.\n\n", "Q: Mail.app configured to access gmail, is there a way to sync \"sent items\"? I've decided I'd like to use only my @gmail.com email account.  I configured Mail.app to access my Gmail account and I can see the 'inbox' just fine.\nHowever, when I send an email with Mail.app it does not appear in the 'sent items' at gmail.google.com.  And sending from gmail, it does not appear in the 'sent' folder of Mail.app.\nIs there anyway to get the 'sent' mail to sync up in both clients?\n\nA: Select the Sent folder for Gmail in the Mail.app sidebar (might be under a [Gmail] heading in Mail depending on how you set it up) then go to the Mailbox menu in the menu bar and look down near the bottom for the Use This Mailbox For menu.\nChoose Sent in there and that should make the Gmail-based Sent folder the default place for Mail.app to save outgoing mail. It will also appear to move that [Gmail]/Sent folder out of the Gmail section and up to the top-most Mailboxes section below Inbox, etc.\nAfter you do this you may notice you now have a section in the Mail sidebar for On My Mac folders, and a Sent folder in there. This is the folder that previously was containing all messages sent via Gmail but stored locally. Feel free to copy all the messages out of there and into the new default Sent folder (which will copy them all up to the Gmail server).\nPS - This process works for Trash as well, so you can map the Gmail Trash to be used by Mail.app. You can also do it for Drafts but I've seen some weird behaviour where Gmail/Mail.app doesn't delete drafts after sending a message and you get a ton of them stacking up in Drafts, which is why I usually leave Drafts as a local-only folder.\n", "Q: Does Time Machine check that old backed up files are present and not corrupted? My only copy of my (large) iTunes library (and all my personal files) is on my MacBook, and I was thinking about using Time Machine to back it all up to an external hard drive (a Western Digital MyBook plugged into the USB port on my Airport Extreme).\nMy question is, when Time Machine makes a copy of a file (say, a song) to the hard drive, since that file never changes I'm guessing it will never get updated by Time Machine.  But will Time Machine regularly review the file to make sure it had not become somehow corrupted?\nI've had trouble with hard drives going bad in the past, and I would hate to be trusting Time Machine for a months and months only to find out that some hard drive partition got corrupted and the file was actually gone long ago.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: If you hold the \"Option\" key while clicking the Time Machine icon in the menu bar, there is an option \"Verify Backups\".\nIf the Time Machine icon is not in your Menu Bar, go to System Preferences, Time Machine, and tick the \"Show Time Machine in Menu Bar\".\nI can't see any other way to get to the \"Verify Backups\" other than through the item in the menu bar.\n", "Q: Hide unused icons from Dock I just installed Mountain Lion, and I notice that the icons for Launchpad, App Store, To-Dos and Notes cannot be removed from my Dock — if I try to drag them off my Dock, they float back in.\nIs there a way to hide or remove these icons?\n\nA: I have not tried it myself, but I read in a review that they intentionally made it harder to accidentally remove icons from the Dock.\nTrying dragging the icon a good distance away from the dock and holding it there for a couple seconds, it should show you some kind of \"about to poof this\" indicator, and then drop it.\nAt least, that's what I got from the review I read.\n\nA: I just noticed that if I right-click on these icons, there is a \"Remove from Dock\" hidden in the Options sub-menu in the context menu.\n", "Q: 1 old (Snow Leopard) iMac & 2 newer (Mountain Lion) MacBooks -- iCloud or DropBox? I have an old iMac (circa 2006, Intel Core Duo) which is running Snow Leopard (somewhat slowly) and cannot be upgraded to Mountain Lion, so there's no iCloud on that machine.\nI also have 2 MacBook Pros which will both be running Mountain Lion very shortly.\nMy question is, I'd like to keep my \"Documents\" folder in sync across all of these three machines.  If I used iCloud to sync both MacBooks, is there an easy way to sync the iMac (minus iCloud) as well?\nOr should I just use DropBox?  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!\n\nA: I think in your case Dropbox is the solution to keep synchronized your files.\nYou can continue to use iCloud on your other Mac with Moutain Lion (to synchronize your reminders or other contents that use iCloud).\nMoreover, my understanding is that iCloud don't sync your Documents folder, so anyway for your need, you should use Dropbox.\nHowever, be careful when you put your personal data online !\n\nA: I recommend ChronoSync. You can use it to sync just one file or a whole folder (even your entire Documents Folder) between two Macs over your local network. You can sync one way (left to right, say) or both ways (ie. with changes in both folders). It can be set up to run automatically when a volume mounts, or manually.\n", "Q: How do I \"pin\" Notes in Mountain Lion? The official feature list for Mountain Lion says that individual notes opened into their own windows from the Notes app (1.0) remain \"pinned\" open \"even if you close Notes\", but this isn't true. Closing Notes closes any notes that have been opened into their own windows.\nHow do I get the Notes app's note \"pinning\" feature to work as described.\n\nA: The feature description is a bit misleading. It appears that by \"close Notes\", Apple means \"close the main Notes window\", not \"close the Notes app\", which (not surprisingly) leaves other windows open.\nIn fact, the context menu refers to the main Notes window as Notes:\n\nSo what Apple's description basically means:\n\nEven if you close Notes, the note stays open on your desktop.\n\n= You don't need to use the overview window at all times. You can use Notes.app similar to Stickies.app\nBy the way, Stickies.app is still available in Mountain Lion and has been upgraded to version 9.0.\n\nA: The feature description is a bit misleading. It appears that by \"close Notes\", Apple means \"close the main Notes window\", not \"close the Notes app\", which (not surprisingly) leaves other windows open.\n\nA: Double click the name of a note on the overview pane where it lists your notes. It will pop out into its own window. You can then close the main notes window, but the extra window will stay open and act like a stickie note.\n\nA: Two workarounds (for Mac OS X) to get the 'pins' (double click the listed note) in Notes to reopen on quit and restart/shutdown. Now you can use Notes the same way you used Stickies.\nWorks on quit and restart/shutdown:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences \n\n*Navigate to the General Pane. \n\n*Uncheck 'Close windows when quitting an application'\nWorks only on restart/shutdown:\nCheck the 'Reopen windows when logging back in' box that appears in the middle of the screen on restart/shutdown.\nNB! One can restore the overview window by pressing Command ⌘ + 0 (zero).\n\nA: To contribute to this discussion, and to the confusion caused by this \"feature\": yes, indeed, you can close the main notes window, after \"pinning\" one or more separate notes, but you cannot open it anymore. When you click the notes app, only the then open pinned notes will become active. You have to close all your pinned notes first, if you want to re-open the main notes window in order to create a new note, or to open another one. \nThis is very annoying indeed.\nIn addition, when you pin a note, close the main window, then close the pinned notes in order to re-open the main notes window, you may will find your previously pinned notes in double, or even triplicate when you select to view \"All Notes\". As it turns out, the previously \"pinned\" notes are now appearing both in their original folder (in my case in iCloud), and in the \"recovered items\" folder under \"On My Mac\".\n", "Q: Mountain Lion upgrade for organizations How does an organization upgrade to Mountain Lion?  Is it possible to create a generic Apple ID and purchase multiple copies from the Mac App Store?  Are there any other available methods?  Once one Mac is upgraded, can a DVD be created and used to upgrade the rest?  How many license are needed?  Individual upgrades seem to be good for 5 installs, however I suspect that does not hold true for organizations.  \n\nA: The general advice is that Apple has sales channels (within the retail stores as well as without) to assist organizations understand the various programs and licensing terms. Additionally, organizations typically get tools to assist with license management, support and deployment.\nIf you don't have a sales contact yet, you could start with this somewhat dated, but very nice white paper on the issues for deploying OS X in a large scale setting:\nhttp://www.apple.com/education/docs/Apple-SolutionsSystemMgmt.pdf\nThere are more up-to-date presentations for the App Store, but I haven't seen them published on the web.\n\nA: My experience went something like this, not sure how typical it is:\nApple Rep, was contacted.  There is no volume discount for less than 20 licenses, but I think we did pay with a PO.  We got an encrypted PDF with some keys.  Everybody that needs to upgrade can create an individual Apple ID using their organization e-mail address (select the 'None' payment option), click on 'Redeem', enter one of the keys and download and install Mountain Lion.\nI hope we never need to transfer a license between Apple IDs.  \n", "Q: How can I assign a customisable mouse button to open Notification Center? I want to set my mouse's customisable button to open Notification Centre on OS X Mountain Lion.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: Depending on your mouse and driver software, your best bet would probably be to set a keyboard shortcut for Notification Center and program your mouse button to trigger that shortcut.\nYou can set up the shortcut in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Show Notification Center.\n\nThe setup for your mouse driver will vary, but on a Razer mouse you can assign the button to a Keyboard Function and type your shortcut.\n\n\nA: You could also use BetterTouchTool paired with an Apple keyboard shortcut as shown:\n\n\n\nA: If you don't have customizable mouse software, you can write an AppleScript to perform the keystroke and then attach the mouse button to the script.\nThe script I used is:\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"N\" using {command down, control down, option down, shift down}\n\nYou will have to adjust the keystroke and the modifier keys to suit whatever you set in the Keyboard Shortcuts preference pane.\nSave the script as an application bundle, then stick it somewhere (I put it in ~/Library/Scripts). Adjust your mouse button in System Preferences to open the application bundle.\n", "Q: In the past, how long have Up-to-date OS upgrades taken to arrive? I've bought a Macbook Pro Retina display before Mountain Lion was released. I have signed up for a copy of Mountain Lion for free, as promised by Apple if you purchase an Apple computer after June 11, 2012. When I finished the application form, the page said to wait till I get an email from Apple.\nThe problem is I don't know how long to wait. If past is prologue, how long is it before I can expect to get Mountain Lion? It has been three hours, and I still have not received an email.\n\nA: This appears to be a real issue, per this MacRumors article from earlier today:\n\nApple support staff have acknowledged the difficulties and are advising customers that they may need to wait up to three days to receive replacement codes, although some replacement codes are reportedly already coming through without any action required by the users.\n\nHopefully your codes will arrive within that window - if not, I recommend you contact Apple support; given proof-of-purchase on your MacBook, they should get you sorted.\n\nA: I would make a call to Apple tomorrow to ask if you should fill out the form again. There have been some credible reports that people have received redemption codes in the email from Apple, but that those codes did not work. I don't think you fall into that category since you would have at lease received one email from Apple.\nOf course, check your spam mail folder and perhaps try to enter the web form again, and watch for errors. I don't think there's anything the retail stores could do if you went in - so calling might be good to know if it's OK to re-enter the web form or if someone needs to correct this by hand.\nSorry for the news, but I wouldn't count on it working out if you would rather not wait a week or more for the new bits.\n", "Q: I am missing the option to see the remaining battery life as time in the menubar? In previous versions of OS X the battery indicator in the menubar included options to show the remaining battery life as percentage or time (or nothing).\nIn Mountain Lion, there's only an option to show the percentage?!?!\nHow can I get the missing option back?\n\n\nA: A cheaper and simpler option than the still-awesome iStat Menus is Watts for USD $6.95.  Very configurable and lets you schedule reminders including re-calibration.\n\nI've been using it on 10.6.8 on my last three portables and am very happy with it.\n\nA: I made a very simple app to specifically show time remaining: Battery Time Remaining\n\n\nA: iStat Menus can also solve the problem (as well as show tonnes of other useful information) http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/\n\nA: According to the following blog entry Apple removed the option deliberately and it won't come back:\nhttp://www.macpoint.be/mountain-lion-is-coming/\nI also missed the option, so I wrote an App. It's in beta now:\nhttp://batterytimeapp.com/\n\nA: SlimBatteryMonitor\nNot only does it save much more space in your menu bar, it lets you choose what information to show in specific states.\nI have mine set to show the time when running on battery, the percentage when charging, and just the icon when fully charged.\n\n\n\nA: You just can't show the remaining battery time in the menubar since Mountain Lion.\nThe following free app uses almost the same icon design and adds a bit more features which makes it a valid replacement:\nBattery Time Remaining\nby Han Lin Yap\n \nYou can read my blog post for some more detail on what I did, it also won't hurt to report a bug to Apple. So this issue will get to their attention.\n\nA: I thought this was already present in Lion. In Lion you could change it with\n# Menu bar: show remaining battery time; hide percentage\ndefaults write com.apple.menuextra.battery ShowPercent -string \"NO\"\ndefaults write com.apple.menuextra.battery ShowTime -string \"YES\"\n\nfound on\nhttps://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.osx\n\nA: If you have an older Mac and the older version of the Battery.menu app backed up (or downloaded from a trustful source), you can replace the new crippled Battery.menu with the former one that shows the Remaining time.\nInspired by this article, but in my case, I had to do everything in the Recovery mode in order to make it work.\nThey also link the old menu version if you trust them. I fortunately had my own backup.\nApproach in general:\n\n*\n\n*Get the previous version of Battery.menu\n\n*Reboot into Recovery mode\n\n*disable System Integrity Protection\n\n*swap Battery.menu apps\n\n*enable System Integrity Protection and reboot\n\nDetailed steps:\n\n*\n\n*open this guide in your phone to keep it on eyes\n\n*get the old Battery.menu e. g. to ~\n\n*Reboot to Recovery mode (Command-R while start-up)\n\n*Run Menu: Utilities > Terminal:\n\n\n# csrutil disable\n# reboot\n\n\n\n\n*Trigger Recovery mode again (Command-R while start-up)\n\n*backup replace Battery.menu again in Menu: Utilities > Terminal:\n\n\n# cd /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/\n# cp -R Battery.menu Battery.menu.backup\n# cp -R ~/Battery.menu .\n# csrutil enable\n# reboot\n\n\n\n\n*Double-check the System Integrity Protection is really enabled after rebooting in Terminal:\n\n\n# csrutil status\n\n\nThis last step is really worth double-checking, because forgetting it would mean a serious vulnerability of your Mac.\n", "Q: Can I configure Messages for Mac to receive messages sent to my phone number? Is it possible to configure Messages for Mac in such a way that it receives text messages sent to my mobile phone number?\nCurrently on the Mac I can receive only messages sent to my Apple ID, but on my iPhone I can receive messages sent to both.\n\nA: In iOS 6, your phone number and your Apple ID will be unified, so when you'll receive a iMessage or a Facetime call, they will appear on all your devices (iOS and Mac OS).\nMore info here. \nSo I think you just need to wait until this fall to resolve your problem ! \n", "Q: Why can't some Macs upgrade to Mountain Lion? This is an extension of this question. As noted by that question, Apple discontinued support for many of their older computers, notably the plastic MacBooks. What is the reasoning for leaving out this hardware? Is it due to hardware restrictions or is it just a push for owners of older hardware to upgrade?\n\nA: The limitation is because Mountain Lion dropped support for 32 bit kernel and extensions. There are work arounds that work on some old computers (like the first gen Intel Mac Pro), leading me to believe it's simply an artificial limitation, much like the exclusion of Intel Core Solo support that came with Lion.\n", "Q: How to view logs in Airport Utility v6, or install 5.6 in Mountain Lion? So I just upgraded to Mountain Lion, and I'm watching some Netflix over my Apple TV, when it stops streaming and tells me it's not connected to the network any more.  Sure enough, my Air has also lost it's network connectivity and the Airport Extreme is solid Amber on the status light.\nI wait a while, it starts to flash green, then it goes green, and slowly my SSIDs start to appear, and everything is normal again.\nI presume the AE just rebooted, so I fire up Airport extreme to look at the logs, and remember that in Airport Utility 6.0, all the nice advanced features (and some not so advanced ones) are not available.  Amongst them is viewing the logs.  So I download 5.6, which is the most recent non-6.0 version that uses the old ways and lets you view logs etc - and it won't install because it's not compatible with Mountain Lion.\nA bit of googling about also reveals that apparently V6.0 will only manage Wireless-N networks.  Seems anyone with older Airport kit, or a need to do anything slightly advanced in ML is screwed.\nAnyone know how I can either view logs in 6, or install 5.6 on 10.8?\n\nA: I restored version 5.6 from my Time Machine backup of Lion and it works properly, however you should also be able to download it from Apple and extract the application from the .pkg using Pacifist.\n\nA: If you do not want (or can't) get the app out of a backup you can extract it from the installer.\nDownload the Airport Utility 5.6 for Lion and move the file AirPortUtility56.pkg contained within the dmg to your ~/Downloads folder. Then in a Terminal window do :\n$ cd ~/Downloads\n$ pkgutil --expand ./AirPortUtility56.pkg ~/Downloads/AirPortUtility56\n$ gunzip -c < ./AirPortUtility56/AirPortUtility56Lion.pkg/Payload | sudo tar -C / -xvf - \"./Applications/Utilities/AirPort Utility 5.6.app\"\n\nThe app works without issue on Mountain Lion in my limited testing so far.\n\nIf you wanted to mod the package to skip the check, if you want to easily install the package on multiple macs for instance, here's what you need :\nA tool called \"Flat Package Editor\" to modify the file called Distribution in AirPortUtility56.pkg. To get that tool download the \"Auxiliary tools for Xcode\" from the Apple Dev site. It's hidden in PackageMaker.app/Contents/resources/Flat Package Editor.app. With it you can open the pkg directly :\n\nJust drag out the Distribution file and remove these lines :\n// Less than 10.8\nif(-1 != system.compareVersions(my.target.systemVersion.ProductVersion, '10.8')) {\n  my.result.type = 'Fatal';\n  my.result.message = system.localizedString('ERR_OSHIGH');\n  return (false);\n}\n\nDrag the new version back in, delete the old Distribution and save.\n\nA: I too was unable to get any of the installers to install any older 5.x version of the utility onto Mountain Lion, but I did copy over AirPort Utility 5.3.3 from a Lion machine and it has been working fine for days to manage some hardware. It is not signed so GateKeeper will prevent you from running it until you go to security preference and allow downloads from anywhere to run.\nI'll probably set up syslogd forwarding so I don't need to fire up a Lion VM or boot back into Lion for routine diagnostics.\nThis is a bit of a pain to not be able to do some of the following things with a supported client on Mountain Lion:\n\n\n*\n\n*save and manage profiles\n\n*see signal strength graphs\n\n*configure syslog forwarding\n\n*look at the system logs\n\n\nThis seems like a poor solution since the newer AirPort extremes are not usable even on 5.6 version of the software and I strongly dislike using unsupported software to manage something like a network router.\n\nA: I use Airport Utilty for Windows on my virtual PC in Vmware Fusion to configure advanced settings.\n\nA: Here's how I did it. Worked fine for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find Airport Utility 5.6 on a machine running Lion. Copy it directly from the Applications folder onto a formatted thumb drive or the like. (Or extract the app from the .pkg using Pacifist.)\n\n*Copy the app to the desktop on your Mountain Lion machine.\n\n*Rename it to Airport Utility 5.6.app\n\n*Copy it to the Applications folder. The end.\nAll the problems arise when you try to REPLACE 6.x. So don't replace it... just install them side-by-side.\nThis way you get the best of both worlds: they both work fine (if you may call anything about 6.x \"fine\"). Doing it this way does not interfere with updates. And if you need to turn on SNMP just open 6.x and do it. Then close the damned thing and use 5.6 for everything else.\n\nA: Use \nhttp://frank.is/mountain-lion-and-the-old-airport-utility/\nIt works amazingly!\n\nA: Airport Utility v5.53 works fine in 10.8\n\nA: After I tried every other solution offered out there, this one finally worked for me: Download Pacifist for Mac. OPEN the package in Pacifist then EXTRACT it to your Applications folder. Then dig down the files until you find the application. Open it and you're good to go.\n\nA: The above will not work with the new Apple Extreme 802.11ac Router & Time Capsule. Apple has decided to eliminate SNMP in the firmware.\n", "Q: What features from Lion will be lost when upgrading to Mountain Lion? I know Mountain Lion has some cool new features that Lion did not have, but will it overwrite any of Lion's functionality?\n\nA: One of the bigger-deal removals for some is the 'Web sharing' button in the System Preferences > Sharing tab that controls Apache. Apache is still there, and can be manually set up, but the old one-click solution is gone. That was one of the things I used to demonstrate to people new to the Mac that they found astonishing.\n\nA: *\n\n*Safari doesn't have separate source windows\n\n*Calendar doesn't support scheduling scripts\n\n*The option to disable smooth scrolling was removed\n\n*The tab for installed updates was removed from the Software Update preferences\n\n*Mail doesn't support notes\n\n*Nested menu titles like >File>Duplicate no longer work in the keyboard shortcut preferences\n\n*Old files cannot be locked automatically\n\n*Safari doesn't have RSS buttons\n\n\nA: Safari Changes:\nActivity Window Missing:\nPrior to Mountain Lion, there was an Activity window that could be opened from \"Safari > Window > Activity\". Now however, that functionality is no longer available. I found the Activity window to be especially useful for downloading videos from sites like YouTube. I'm sure there were many other uses for it, but that was what I primarily used it for.\nDelete Button No Longer Goes to Previous Page:\nIn Lion, one could navigate to the previous page in Safari by pressing the delete key, but in Mountain Lion this feature is no longer active by default (in Mountain Lion it's Cmd[). However, you can activate it with this terminal command:\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari com.apple.Safari.ContentPageGroupIdentifier.WebKit2BackspaceKeyNavigationEnabled -bool YES\n\n\nA: Of course.  In adding features, the behavior of previous features changes, not always for the better.\nIf you find features that were present in Lion but missing in Mountain Lion, please edit this answer to add your contributions to this list.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mountain Lion drops support for some models of Macs supported by Lion.\n\n*Clicking the top right corner no longer triggers Spotlight (Spotlight's menubar icon is still present, adjacent to the new Notification Center icon).\n\n*The battery indicator in the menubar will no longer offer to show the remaining time.\n\n*X11.app is included, but that app alone no longer provides X11 functionality. When the user first runs X11.app – or an app that requires X11 – a dialogue guides the user to Apple's article HT5293 about XQuartz, which provides the functionality.\n\n*Mail.app and Safari.app drop support for RSS Feeds.\n\nA: Disk Utility may lose the ability to present S.M.A.R.T. status\nThe underlying cause, as I see it: in Disk Utility, a physical disk may be invisible.\nWithout Disk Utility\nS.M.A.R.T. status will be visible in System Information, or with a command such as this:\ndiskutil info disk0 | grep SMART\n\n\nA: In addition to operating system features that are removed, many third party applications will not work, at least until they are upgraded by their developers.  There's a pretty extensive community built list at http://roaringapps.com/apps:table/.\n\nA: Safari 6 removes the ability to change the default fonts in webpages (see Safari 6: How to change default fonts?).  Note that this will also happen even if you upgrade to Safari 6 in Lion.\n\nA: MAIL has lost its progress bar and also the belly-button indicators by each mailbox... so you don't know when servers are being checked, or when mails are being sent or downloaded nor how they are progressing... or not.\nAlso, MAIL has lost its DELETE button, so you have to use the Delete button on the keyboard.  Minor hassle, but why add hassle?\n", "Q: How to hide notification center button in Mountain Lion? I am using Mountain Lion.\nThe only advantage (for me) over the gesture is that Option + clicking the button enables/disables showing alerts and banners (toggles the switch in the notifications center).\nIs there a way to hide the button in the status bar that opens notification center?\n\nA: I had the same problem yesterday, and found this tool called Bartender. It is paid software.\nOn my Mac, running Mountain Lion, the icon is gone but the other notification functionality remains.\n\nA: Sadly we can't remove the icon yet without disabling Notification Center entirely.\nShould you want to proceed, this procedure requires a short disclaimer.\nWarning:\nThis involves hacking your System folder; make appropriate backups and proceed with caution!\nGo to /System/Library/CoreServices and select Notification Center.app. Press ⌘I to Get Info. Click the Lock icon at the bottom of the screen to unlock the settings (you will be prompted for your password). In the Sharing and Permissions portion of the pane, click the plus sign. Add your account as a special user, then set the Privilege column to Read & Write for yourself. Then, in the Name and Extension field, add the letter x to the beginning of the file name, dismissing any warnings the system throws your way.\nReboot the system.\nIf you don't want to reboot you can use Terminal.app, which can be found under /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app.\nType killall NotificationCenter and press enter. This terminates the NotificationCenter process.\nNote that this eliminates the icon, but also all Notification Center functionality.\n\nA: Holding the Command key then click and drag-off-the-menu-bar totally worked!  This is so great.  (I wanted to remove my User Login Name from displaying up there.  I know who I am, and I never ever switch users...wasted space.)  I can also confirm that this idea works for all those system icons up there.\n", "Q: Some songs are not syncing with iCloud in iPhone I have some songs that are not synced with iCloud.

I was kind of confused when I wasn't redirected to the Twitter page, to allow ML using my Twitter account for several things. In this case I had to input my username + password in the pure Mac gui and it just works.\nHow?! Basic Auth was disabled a few months ago.\n\nA: Twitter removed basic auth, yes, but it didn't remove Username/Password auth.\nSee their documentation on xAuth.\nIn a nutshell, you collect the user's username and password, and on successful verification, store the OAuth token and discard the username and password.\nxAuth is explicitly allowed for certain applications, approved only from Twitter. It's not a stretch to say that Twitter would have approved Apple's request to use this in a heartbeat. The lack of ability to access Direct Messages via xAuth is limiting, but ultimately not relevant given the level of Apple's integration.\n", "Q: Stop iTunes from opening when a device is plugged in? Since re-installing OS X (10.8), every time I plug in an iOS device iTunes opens up and shows an error message:\n\niTunes could not connect to the iPhone \"...\" because it is locked with a passcode. You must enter your passcode on the iPhone before it can be used with iTunes.\n\nI plug in various devices all the time, just so I can charge them. I do not want them connected to iTunes, I definitely don't want iTunes storing a copy of the device's passcode (or however that works) on my mac, and some of the devices plugged in aren't even mine.\nHow can I stop this from happening? It doesn't happen when I'm booted into 10.7 on the same mac, with the same iOS devices.\nI already have \"Prevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing automatically\" enabled in Preferences.\nEDIT: this particular device also has \"Open iTunes when this device is connected\" turned off, so it seems to ignore that setting.\n\nA: Under System Preferences → Users → [you] → Login Items → select iTunesHelper, then click the minus sign and log out/into your Mac.\nNo devices will cause iTunes to launch (that's the whole purpose of iTunesHelper).\n\nA: You need to disable iTunesHelper agent. The following command in Terminal can help:\nlaunchctl stop com.apple.iTunesHelper\n\n\nA: In iTunes there is an option to prevent the app to launch when a device is connected to your computer.\n\nOpen iTunes > Clic on a device in the sidebar > Scroll down to the \"Options\" section.\n\nThen you have to make sure this little checkbox is un-check:\n\n(source: f.cl.ly)\nIf the problem still occurs after that, come back here !\n\nA: Open iTunes -> Preferences -> Devices.\nMake sure Prevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing automatically option is checked. \n\n\n\nA: The solution I found that worked since nothing else did for me was to rename the iTuneshelper.exe file before I plug in my iPhone. I use Explorer to get photos off my phone and this is the only way I could do that after I installed iTunes. Apple needs to really work on improving iTunes.

I was under the impression I could download previous purchases free of charge.  What's going to happen when I click \"Buy\" on a previous purchase?\n\nA: If you really purchased it, it will show buy and then tell you it's free since you already bought it. As long as you didn't mistake a newer version of the song you can \"buy\" again for free. There is a report a problem link if you do accidentally re-buy substantially the same item and I wouldn't hesitate to ask for a refund when the storekeeper doesn't make it easier to know if it's a re-download or a buy.\n", "Q: Mac App Store Debug - Save page source to disk I've searched the net for this, but nobody seems to have the answer.

I have tried adding the drive to the \"Prevent Spotlight from searching these locations\" list on the Privacy tab of the Spotlight Preference Pane.  Unfortunately, MacOS seems to forget this setting every time the drive is removed (every workday, in other words).

Currently running MacOS 10.7 Lion (at least until the Mountain Lion Up-to-Date Program manages to get itself straightened out) and SuperDuper 2.6.4.\n\nA: This ended up being a SuperDuper! problem.  It was doing a fresh copy rather than a smart update and when it does that, it sets the drive to be indexed in spotlight rather than retaining your previous setting.  Once I set it to smart update the problem was fixed.\n\nA: You might want to look at Spotless.

I'm pretty sure that it's an OS X process, but don't want to give access to my keychain to just any process.\nSo, my ultimate question is: does anyone know what assistantd is and why it would need access to my keychain?\n\nA: According to this site, Ongoing Cross-Section of assistantd Headers - Useful for Siri Mods, it appears assistantd is associated with Siri functionality on iOS.\nGiven this, I suspect assistantd on Mac OS X is related to the new dictation functionality. Dictation on Mac OS X 10.8 uses Contacts and other personal information to improve accuracy; gaining access to this information would explain the need for Keychain access.\n\nA: It is there to support the speech function. By default, dictation runs when you press the fn button twice.\n\nA: If you are having problems quitting the pop-up and get rid of it you should open Spotlight search - Write Activity monitor - open it - after you opened the program on the top click 'Disk\" and search for assistantd and or accountsd (pretty much same thing) double click on it and there will be a pop up with its information after you've got that done .

I updated to OS X 10.8 and my process count went from about 75 under Mac OS X 10.7.4(?) to 96. What can I do to fix this?\nI use my Mac (MacBook Pro, Mid 2010, 2.8 Ghz Core i7, 8GB RAM, 256 GB SSD) for iOS development and the occasional gaming and it bugs me how the process count keeps jumping with each OS upgrade.\nSince, I feel more comfortable with Windows I already have my PCs optimized down to ~30 processes when idle thanks to the handy dandy MSCONFIG.\nIs there an equivalent utility for Mac OS X?\n\nA: The number of processes is completely unimportant. Your machine can run tens of thousands if it needed to.\nAsk yourself the question: What are those processes doing? Is any one eating up ram nonestop? Tons of memory? Lots of those may be os-related. Use \"Activity Monitor\" installed with OSX to figure this stuff out. TinkerTool does a good job allowing you to see every program you configured to start on startup.

Just upgraded to Mac OS X Mountain Lion, and I'm loving it so far.\nOne thing I don't care for though is that now, three-finger tapping links—or anything, for that matter—brings up popups with the definition of the word that was tapped.\nThis is less than convenient since I'm using MiddleClick to set that particular tap gesture to act as a middle-click.\nIs there any way that I can disable this behavior?\n\nA: In System Preferences under Trackpad then Point & Click, uncheck Look up.\n\n\nA: I am not sure what \"middle click\" is, it sounds like some third party utility, so until we know what you mean by this and what it is supposed to do, I can't really help on that front.\nOne thing I would say though is that there is a difference between a 3 finger tap, and a triple tap,  Most people would mean a triple tap to mean tapping 3 times, in the same way as double click means clicking twice.  For clarity, I am sure you mean a 3 finger tap (all three fingers in one go with one tap) - it's a minor point, but will help you to define the problem better.\nIf, after disabling the 3 finger tap lookup feature in Daniel Lawson's answer this stops the dictionary lookup, but doesn't then allow your MiddleClick utility to use it, then is might suggest that it is simply not compatible with Mountain Lion, and I would check with the developer for support.\n\nA: Just discovered this glitch going from Lion to Mavericks. A good work around is to map it to 3 finger click. That seems to work fine.\nNote, I'm using BetterTouchTool which is a much more powerful gesture and keyboard binding tool. Since it experiences the same issue, it's likely this is a bigger problem than just buggy software.\n", "Q: What steps should I take in preparation for upgrading to Mountain Lion? I am considering upgrading my Mac to the new Mountain Lion operating system. What steps should I take to make sure the process goes as smoothly as possible?\n\nA: According to The Tech Scoop and Lifehacker, there are a number of things you should do before upgrading.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your computer will actually run Mountain Lion. Here is a list of all the Macs that will not support Mountain Lion.\n\n*Run Software Update. Go to the Apple menu > Software Update and make sure you have all the current updates installed. Make sure that you are at least running Snow Leopard 10.6.8 (as required on Apple's website).\n\n*Make sure you have enough space on your drive. Mountain Lion requires 8GB of space, so make sure you at least have that amount free (preferably more though). If you don't have the space required, you can use a disk visualizer such as DaisyDisk ($9.99) or Disk Inventory X (free) or use AppCleaner to remove old, unused applications. More detailed information on that is available from Lifehacker\n\n*Check  that all your applications wil run on Mountain Lion. RoaringApps is the best place to check. It has a status indicator, and a feature list of what feature the application supports\n\n*Repair disk permissions and disk. If you are running Snow Leopard, start from the install disc and open Disk Utility. If you are running Lion, shut down and restart while holding Command ⌘ + R (restart into the Recovery partition). In Disk Utility, click on your main hard drive and then click \"Repair Permissions\". When that's done, click \"Repair Disk\".\nThanks to cksum for commenting that repairing permissions before an install is not necessary. \"You don't need to repair disk permissions prior to installing Mac OS X over a previously-installed OS. The installer will do this automatically.\" (Apple KB doc about repairing permissions)  \n\n*Backup your computer. This is the most important step. If something goes wrong while installing Mountain Lion, you want to have a backup to go back to. Also, if for whatever reason you want to revert to Lion, backing up your computer will make it a million times easier to revert. The Tech Scoop recommends using Disk Utility to backup your computer. Lifehacker recommends using either Time Machine or Carbon Copy Cloner to backup your computer. My preference is Carbon Copy Cloner, freeware software for cloning a hard drive. If you want to use the other options, check out the links above. Open Carbon Copy Cloner, select the source and the target and click \"Clone\". Wait for it to backup your computer...\n\n\nIf you've completed all the above steps, your Mac is ready for Mountain Lion! Go to the App Store and install Mountain Lion.\n\nA: In addition to the above, and over-and-above any backup strategies, if your iCal connects to any third-party Cal-Dav servers you'd be well advised to export a copy of those calendars to a .ics file first as I found the upgrade to Mountain Lion nuked all my non-iCloud calendars apart from my default Google calendar.  All calendars I had linked to Google Groups got nuked too.\n\nA: On point 6. Backup your Computer of @davisgeek's answer, I'm just adding SuperDuper as a backup option.

I'm testing an iPad application that requires an Internet connection. I'd want to simulate a situation when the connection isn't stable and can be suddenly lossed. If it's possible I'd want to control this process and \"hit a button\" that will abort the connection for a couple of seconds. I'd want to abort/resume connection quickly to test that app will resume it in case of connection abort.\nHow can I simulate non-stable Internet connection?\nI know that it's possible to just turn Wi-Fi off on iPad but will it be the same for application as abortness of connection because of other reasons?\n\nA: There are a few ways you can do this, depending on your situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move further away from your router. While this may seem a bit obvious, I realize that it isn't always possible while testing/debugging (for example, if you are working on a desktop computer).\n\n*Put aluminum foil around the router and/or antenna. This will (partially) block some or all of the radio signals by creating a makeshift Faraday cage. The results you get will depend on the strength of your router signal, distance from the router, and other environmental factors.\n\n*Set your router's wireless signal power to a lower setting. The method for doing this is different for each router, so you will have to look at the user guide for instructions on how to do this.\n\n\nI hope this helps solve your problems!\nEDIT:\nAnother thing I just thought about would be to make your SSID hidden. iDevices are known to have problems reconnecting to hidden networks, and you might be able to programmatically disconnect from the network at random intervals.\n\nA: Rather than accomplishing this on the iPad, how about shifting the wifi instability to a Mac instead? You could use Internet Sharing to provide a network connection to the iPad (activate and deactivate it without disturbing the rest of your network), and ipfw to throttle the connection however necessary for your test...\n\nA: Another thread proposes this tool:\nhttp://mattgemmell.com/network-link-conditioner-in-lion/\n", "Q: Is there an option/shortcut in Safari 6 to focus the search results after a search? When I write a search query in the url bar in Chrome, I want the focus to go on the search result.\nIn Chrome I can search for something, then hit tab and select the results with my arrow keys (and open the link with return). \nIs there any option/shortcut to focus the page after search?\n\n\nA: Let me make a clarification.\nThe problem is real, and we got it with the unique URL bar behaviour in Safari 6.\nIf you make a google search from the URL bar, Safari doesn't bring the focus to the document, but (for some reason, e.g. assuming you continue with typing new search keywords) leaves the focus in the URL bar. This causes that you can't instantly use the very advanced keyboard handling of Google's search results pages - which is: from the input field TAB gives you a selector arrow and you can navigate with keyboard arrows.\nFor using the search result page's keyboard handling, you have to bring the focus to the document. Now, whether it's easy or not depends on your keyboard settings in System Preferences. If the setting which says \"Full Keyboard Access: In windows and dialogs, press Tab to move keyboard focus between:\" is set to \"Text boxes and lists only\", then it's easy to bring the focus to the document by hitting Tab only once. But if it's set to \"All controls\" (which actually happens a lot if you're accustomted to using the keyboard in UI navigation), then Safari brings you through all the bookmark bar items and such buttons when you hit Tab. This is definitely a no-way.\nYou always need to switch back to \"Text box only\" (by hitting Ctrl-F7). The problem is that in this mode you can't navigate between form elements like checkboxes and buttons.\nIn Chrome the problem doesn't exist, because Chrome always brings the focus to the document when doing a search.\nApple should definitely address this issue.\nUntil then, a workaround can be that you hit Ctrl-F (moves focus to in-page search), then hit Tab 4x.\n\nA: In Safari 12 (and possibly earlier versions), pressing the Escape key after the page has finished loading will focus the web page content, letting you use any keyboard shortcuts that the web site has defined (such as the J and K keys in a search results page in Duck Duck Go). \nIf you press the escape key before the page has finished loading, it will simply stop the page from loading. Fortunately, search results pages from the major search engines load quite fast so it’s not too much cognitive load to wait. \nSadly, Google have removed custom keyboard shortcuts from their search results page. You can use the Tab key to move between page elements, but you must tab through UI elements like the search input box before getting to the results. \nThis keyboard shortcut is not listed in the Help section inside Safari, or in the keyboard shortcuts help page on Apple’s support site.\n\nA: I haven't been able to replicate the exact Chrome behaviour, but I adapted this extension for Safari, and maybe it'll help if you're used to keyboard shortcuts. What it does:\n\n\n*\n\n*After searching, remove focus from the search field\n\n*Navigate results using j (down), k (up) and / (search field focus)\n\n\nThe extension and source can be found here. \n\nA: It's almost the same in Safari but you need to hit tab three times instead of one.\n\n\n*\n\n*Search in the url bar\n\n*Hit enter\n\n*Hit tab tree times and use the ↑/↓ to navigate between the results\n\n\nA: This is a serious problem for keyboard users in Safari.\nThe omnibox can't be used for search via google without having to use the mouse to open search results.\n\nA: If you haven't enabled full keyboard access from System Preferences, you can press tab twice.\nIf you have enabled full keyboard access, you can press shift-tab three times.\n\nA: If you customize your toolbar to have no items to the right of the search bar, you can move your focus to the page with a single press of tab.\n\nA: If you simply want to select Google search results using the keyboard, first run this:\nd=~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Safari;mkdir -p $d;for i in {1..9};do echo 'tell app\"safari\"to do javascript\"window.location.href=document.querySelectorAll(\\\".r>a:first-child\\\")['$((i-1))'].href\"in document 1'|osacompile -o \"$d/Select Google Link $i.scpt\";done\nThen use FastScripts to assign a keyboard shortcut to the scripts.\nThe :first-child part above is needed to skip the \"Translate this page\" links.\n\nA: I discovered this way to mouselessly visit search result web sites—in part by accident: \n\n\n*\n\n*⌘L → focus on URL search field in Safari. \n\n*Type search terms & hit enter.\n\n*Search results are displayed and focus remains in the URL search field. \n\n*Hit tab. Focus moves from URL search field to DuckDuckGo's Search field. \n\n*[This was the accident]: Hit Escape. Focus moves to a magnifying glass button next to the DuckDuckGo search field. \n\n*Now use either \"j\" or down-key to move down your results. \n\n*Hit return when you land on a plausible source of funny cat videos to visit that site. \n\n*Use Safari's \"Search Results Snapback\" (⌥⌘S) to return to your DuckDuckGo search results. My previous choice was highlighted again. \n\n*Use j/l or down-/up-key to move about \n\n\nthis is with Safari Version 12.1.2 (14607.3.9) & DuckDuckGo\n", "Q: Will downloading Mountain Lion from Mac AppStore resume if I restarted/shut down the computer?

I just bought an iPhone 3G secondhand from a friend. Under Settings the version is listed 4.2.1 but it's missing some of the iOS 4 features. Double-clicking the home button doesn't bring up recent apps, and there's no option to set this function in the home button settings. There's also no Game Centre on the home screen. Does anyone know why this might be?\nEDIT: While it will download apps requiring iOS 4.0 from the App Centre, they crash immediately after opening. Apps requiring iOS 3.0 work fine.\n\nA: This is by design, although the basic internal features and functions of iOS4 are present (this is mainly the stuff that apps will use, so you can be sure that if your app says it needs OS4, then you can run it) not all the OS functions are present, and this includes the background switching functionality as well as a few other things.  I can't remember them all right now, but the 3G only got some of the functionality that the iPhone 4 and 3GS got.\nLikewise, when OS6 comes out later this year, there are bits and pieces that will not run on an iPhone 4, which will run fine on an iPhone 4S - I think the turn by turn navigation will not be available on the iPhone 4, for example.\nThis sort of thing has always happened with iOS upgrades, and the hardware at the bottom of the compatibility tree often has to forgo some of the features.  Often it's down the memory constraints etc.  The key is that none of the missing bits are essential for the running of other apps, so an app that needs OS4 will run fine whether or not you are running it with all the new bits, or only some of them.  Apps will only care about the APIs available to them, and you should have the very same ones regardless of the extra stuff on top that is missing.\n\nA: on jailbroken phones, we can actually rename the firmware version like 3.0 can be written as 4.2.1 or 5.1.1, but actually it is only 3.0 i think you have only 3.0 version.\n", "Q: How to increase the font size of 3 finger tap lookup results?

Remember, too, to reopen the Application were you're testing this, or the changes won't be noticeable.\n\nA: I cannot find a way to do this automatically, I have tried within for example Safari to zoom in/out whilst the popup was present, and it ignores it, which makes sense as it's a system wide feature.  But I have found a possible alternative/workaround:\nThe best method for doing this is to enable the zoom functionality within System Preferences\nThe following screenshot shows my settings, and I have circled the changes from default that I had to make:\n\nNow, if I want to zoom into anything on screen to make it larger, be it the lookup popup or anything else, I just center the mouse over what I want to look at, hold down Control, and scroll to adjust the zoom level.  I get a little rectangle which I can move around with the mouse/trackpad etc.  To get back to normal, just zoom back out fully.  The following screenshot shows the rectangle, but because of what I can only assume to be an odd screen drawing routine the zoomed content is not shown in the screenshot - rest assured that when you try this, the rectangle will show zoomed contents of whatever is currently underneath it.\n\nOddly, by accident, I also just discovered that pressing Control+Alt/Option it immediately zooms into a preset level which I can then amend with my normal zoom approach (gesture, mousewheel, etc), but if you do not ammend the zoom then just letting go of the keys removes the zoon rectangle, so for a quick peak holding those 2 keys, then letting go is pretty quick.\n", "Q: Replacement RSS reader for Mountain Lion, integrated with Notification Center? I am looking for a recommendation for a replacement RSS reader for Mountain Lion. I have used RSS feeds in Mail.app for semi-important alerts, like maintenance announcements from my webhost or new posts on rarely updated blogs. I do not want or need a full dedicated \"news reader\". Occasional messages in my inbox were perfect.\nIs there a good, inexpensive RSS reader that I do not have to check separately but that keeps me up-to-date with these kind of occasional RSS updates? Preferably integrated into Notification Center, which would make a lot of sense.\n\nA: Firstly, in order to integrate into Notification Centre, an app needs to have been purchased from the App Store.  Only App Store apps can use it (same with most iCloud features).  So your search needs to start there.\n2 very popular RSS readers are Reeder and NewsNetWire.  Neither have been update to use Notification Centre yet so far as I know, but for sure some of them will be.\nIt's likely that if you can find an RSS reader that used to use Growl as it's notification method, then it will be modified in time to use Notification Centre instead, but there are so many RSS readers (particularly on iOS, perhaps less so on the Mac App Store) that I can't name a particular app right now.\nI quick search for \"rss notification\" yields no results, but \"rss growl\" gives 3 hits (Note that for those who are not aware, Growl is in effect a third party tool that has done what Notification Centre will do for years already, and loads of apps already support it):\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/cappuccino/id492594411?mt=12\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/monotony/id533978766?mt=12\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/feeds/id458374415?mt=12\nThe fact that these 3 already support some form of notifications may be indicative they they will be amogst the first to support OS X 10.8 Notification Centre.\nHowever there is another way:\nFor those apps (not just RSS) that use Growl, there is talk that Growl will morph into a sort of bridge between the Notification Centre and non MAS apps, because it is on the MAS itself, and as such can install notifications into the tray, and it can also poll other apps for Growl notifications and simply pass them on without the originating app needing to know about Notification Centre formally.  See this blog post for info.\nIt's not happened yet tho, although there is already an app to bridge between Growl and Notification Centre called HISS (See here http://9to5mac.com/2012/07/25/put-growl-in-your-notification-center-with-hiss/) which will punt any grown notification into NC instead, although it's very much Beta, and frankly will be superceded as soon as Growl get their own act together, but at least it is available now.\nAs such you may be able to roll your own temporary bodge using a combination of an RSS reader as suggested above that supports Growl, installing and using Growl, installing Hiss to pass Growl notifications into the Notification Centre...\n\nA: Caffeinated is the only rss app I know of that uses notification center.\n\nA: RSS.app is a free lightweight RSS reader which integrates with Notification Center.\n\nA: Try LuckNews - its free and also does not use the Google Reader API which Google has announced will be going away in July.

Now (Mountain Lion) that Notes and ToDo lists are synched among devices via iCloud, I can finally leave it and just find a good application to manage my bookmarks.\nI have tons of them, mostly in Delicious. I've tried a couple of desktop clients, like Delish and Delibar, but they don't really work well for me. Delibar, while cool-looking, is nothing about managing bookmarks, just consuming them. Delish is better, but why can't I select multiple bookmarks, drag them onto a tag to add them to it, just open the bookmark without having to right click on it...\nHow do you manage your bookmarks so that you can arrange and fully-organize them on the desktop while still being able to access them on the web and from your i-devices? Thanks\n\nA: It seems to me like you're looking for the exact kind of solution that I am... and I have yet to find anything that exactly fits the bill. Safari can sync bookmarks through iCloud, of course, but it's severely lacking in other functionality. Yojimbo is a great Mac app for managing bookmarks (among other types of data) but doesn't have any great iOS companion (they have a buggy, read-only iPad app, and also the ability to create a read-only web-based version of your library). I'm hopeful that Yojimbo 4.0 (which should be coming very soon) will improve this, but I'm certainly not holding my breath.\nIn the meantime, I've found some of the web-based bookmark managing solutions to be the best. Both Pinboard and Kippt work great (I've been using both for different sorts of bookmarks). Pinboard charges a sign-up fee but is fantastic & very actively being developed. The biggest difference between the two is that in Pinboard you manage bookmarks via tags (much like Delicious) whereas in Kippt you create groups/folders of bookmarks. The cool thing, though, is that both of these services are supported by a fantastic Safari extension called Cloudmarks that will let you easily search through your bookmarks or add a new bookmark to either of these services. While not exactly a native Mac app, it does make it really fast to find the bookmark you're looking for. Also, on iOS, there are several apps that sync with Pinboard and at least one that works with Kippt (hopefully more soon since they only very recently opened up their API).\n\nA: A lot of my friends use Diigo.

Mountain Lion won't install without a valid EFI partition.\nHere's my partition table.\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                  Apple_HFS EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            799.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                200.3 GB   disk0s4\n\nAs you can see I've had a go at fixing the EFI partition with the following command:\nnewfs_hfs -v EFI /dev/disk0s1\nThis didn't seem to create the correct type of partition, it created an Apple_HFS instead of EFI.\nMy question is (without formatting the disk) how do I create an EFI partition?\nThanks\nRich\n\nA: You can recreate the EFI System Partition (ESP) using the command-line gpt tool. It should start at sector 40, and it should be 409600 sectors (exactly 200MiB) long. The GPT entry's type should be C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B, and if you have a hybrid MBR, the type there should be EE. The format is actually a subset of FAT, not HFS+. You can read the GPT using the command sudo gpt -r show disk0 in a Terminal window, this produces output that looks something like this:\n      start       size  index  contents\n          0          1         PMBR\n          1          1         Pri GPT header\n          2         32         Pri GPT table\n         34          6         \n         40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n     409640  447801712      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  448211352    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  449480888   40753831         \n  490234719         32         Sec GPT table\n  490234751          1         Sec GPT header\n\nYou can see the correct EFI partition at index 1. If that line doesn't match exactly, the easiest way is to delete the partition in its place and recreate it.\nMake sure you know what you're doing before proceeding from here - you may lose data if you mess up.\nYou can't edit the partition table using gpt while partitions on the drive are mounted, so you'll need to boot from another drive (e.g. a USB stick with the OSX installer) or run the mac in target disk mode and do the partitioning from another mac. You may need to unmount any automatically mounted volumes using diskutil unmountDisk disk0 before proceeding, and in between commands.\nTo delete your \"bad\" EFI partition, run this command:\nsudo gpt remove -i 1 disk0\n\nMake sure disk0 is really the disk you want to change - the numbers can change between reboots. Also, this will only work if you already have a non-ESP partition in the place of the ESP - if not, deleting partition 1 could be disastrous! In this case, you'll need to move the indices along, as I think the ESP must have index 1. By the sound of it, this won't be necessary in your case.\nOnce deleted, re-add the partition with the correct layout and type:\nsudo gpt add -b 40 -i 1 -s 409600 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B disk0\n\nThis should sort out the partition itself, but as you've created an HFS partition in its place, you need to fix its format as well.\nThe format of the EFI System Partition is documented by Apple here. As you can see, they recommend you clone an existing ESP rather than recreating the file system with newfs_msdos. If you have an external drive with a GPT partition table (OSX install stick should have it), you can clone that.\nMake sure you have your disk and partition numbers the right way around or you may overwrite data:\nIf disk1 is your external drive, and it contains an ESP as the first partition (disk1s1) and disk0 is the drive whose ESP (disk0s1) you want to fix, run this command:\nsudo dd if=/dev/disk1s1 of=/dev/disk0s1\n\nThis will copy every single block of disk1's ESP and overwrite the corresponding block in disk0's ESP with it.\nAlternatively, take a gamble with newfs_msdos.\n\nA: Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up drive on time machine.\n\n*Restart, rebooting on Lion install disk.\n\n*Go to Disk Utility.\n\n*Erase Partition.\n\n*Erase HD.\n\n*Re-erase partition again, this time giving it a name.\n\n*Click on HD.\n\n*Verify HD to confirm EFI error message no longer appears.\n\n*Go back to install screen.\n\n*Choose restore from back up.\n\n\nA: Simpler solution was found here: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/174522/182014\nAn EFI partition can be created via GParted Live CD/USB:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create 200MB drive (all my free space at the beginning):\n\n\n*\n\n*Type: fat32  \n\n*Label: EFI\n\n\n*Format it\n\n*Set boot flags (option available only after formatting) to \"boot, esp\"\n\nReady!\n\nA: Try iPartition 3 or above. Go to view menu and display system devices. Since it is missing the 200mb EFI, shrink the first partition on disk hopefully by 200mb. Create new partition, then in the disk inspector window there are tabs. You can choose a many different type of file system. Just choose EFI System Partition.\n\nA: This fixed the issue for me.\n1) Backup the Bootcamp partition using Winclone\n2) Backup Mac OSX drive using Carbon Copy Clone to an external drive\n3) Install Mountain Lion to a flash drive or external drive\n4) Purchase a copy of iPartition, download to flash drive or external drive\n5) Reboot while holding the Option key to get boot menu\n6) Select the flash or external drive to boot from\n7) Extract iPartition and execute. Select View and Inspector from the dropdown menu.\n8) Select Bootcamp Partition under the Partition tab and check off the two boxes in the list (Active and Visible in Windows) then close the box.\n9) The Go button should be illuminated, if not then grow the Bootcamp partition a little. Mine is 2 TB OSX, 500 GB Windows on a 2.5 TB Drive.\n10) Once the Go button is pressed it should start to process; although you may have to kill any process that keeps it from running (Done with Activity Monitor)\n11) Once finished shut down and remove the external boot device and then power the Mac back on.  It should be fixed and boot normal -- at least mine did.\nI'm running an iMac 27, 3.2 GHz Intel Core i3 with 16 GB RAM and a 2.5 TB hard drive.  Most of the items listed I had already done prior to Mountain Lion install except for a current backup of the Bootcamp drive.  Winclone worked even though Bootcamp wouldn't boot and the restore process generated an error writing the MBR.  I just ignored the error and continued onward with the rest of the process.  Apparently Mountain Lion messed with the PMBR or the EFI and even rEFIt wouldn't fix it but whatever iPartition did; its now fixed.\n*DISCLAIMER** \nWhile this process may have worked fine for me IT MAY NOT WORK FOR YOU!  AS WITH ANY PROCESS THAT EDITS THE PARTITON TABLE AND BOOT DATA, YOU STAND A CHANCE OF LOSING DATA.  BACKUP YOUR DRIVE IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR DATA.\nI highly recommend Carbon Copy Clone for backing up the OSX partition because it can create a bootable clone that I've never had fail.\nI'm sure others have had success elsewhere in resolving this issue and appreciate everyone who has posted what they have done as it helped me resolve this issue on my iMac.\nThanks to everyone and I hope this helps someone else.\n(Posted in Apple Forum)\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/19220149#19220149\n", "Q: How to use drag and drop to move files instead of copying Drag and drop between drives defaults to copying the files not moving them.

You can bind it to Spotlight's default keybind (Command-Space) and set it to search your entire system.\n\nA: It may not be exactly what you're looking for, but you can access the backend database of Spotlight directly from the command line with the mdfind command. mdfind blah will search nearly everything on your drive (not just the stuff Spotlight shows) that matches \"blah\" - in file names or indexed contents, like Spotlight. It's not a nice GUI interface, but for the occasional search for something Spotlight won't find, it's a good built-in option.\nThere's also Find Any File, which doesn't seem to use indexing, but rather does a full disk search, so expect it to be much slower, but not limited by Spotlight/mdfind's exclusions.\n\nA: I'm not aware of a solution in Spotlight with(-out) tinkering.\nIt certainly would add a lot of \"trouble\" to users with HDD as the the amount of file to index will be too much - hey, after all it's the / directory... \nQuicksilver allows to index user defined directories in Preferences → Catalog.

I understand all the concepts about how to enable them, and configure them etc, but it doesn't seem to work as advertised.\nI'll use Safari as my example here:\nI have the following preferences set in both System Preferences, and Safari's Notification Preferences tab:\n\n\nAs you can see, I set the alert style such that any alert should stay on screen until dismissed, and the most recent 5 alerts should remain unless dismissed within the notification centre \"tray\".\nNow, when I trigger alerts (and to do this I have been enabling desktop alerts in the Ask Different Chat Room and getting people to ping my name) I am getting numerous odd behaviour.\nSometimes when I receive the alerts, I can see them appear both in the top right, and also in the \"tray\", but if I ignore them, they not only go away automatically (they shouldn't, I am not using banner alerts) but they also subsequently remove themselves from the tray without any action on my part.\nOther times the notifications refuse to show and only appear in the Notification Center without ever popping up properly - I think that this happens with Safari minimised.\nI have switched them to banner type and back, and no change.  But it seems to work fine in Mail, the alerts (set as Banners in its case) show, disappear when they should, but the most recent 5 remain in the tray as expected, but I cannot get any to stay in the tray for Safari at all.  I have tested notifications through Twitter and Messages also, with banner and alert styles, and these all seem to operate normally.\nI made the following screen captures that shows an alert style notification simply disappearing without any acknowledgement within Notification Center, and also one that shows them failing to show at all:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUiR3cFrEw4&feature=youtube_gdata_player\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89q5r6OpThM&feature=youtube_gdata_player\n\nAnyone know if this is a Safari, or a NC bug?

Any ways to \"fix\" it?\nExtra:\nAfter checking the comments and talking this through (and testing) extensively in chat, it seems that lots of people have similar issues.  I have come across people just not getting any full stop using the same config as me above, and Chrome users getting the same results too so it looks like a NC issue, not Safari.  Feel free to add your issues if you have any as comments, I will try to expand the question if I spot a common theme.  I have not yet read anything that indicates it's massively widespread, but anecdotally on here and in chat it seems that it's not just me.  The following answers were removed for being \"me too\", but show that others are experiencing the same issues:\n\nI'm seeing the exact same thing w/safari and gmail. the alerts pop up correctly and I can see the notification show up in notification center.

Not sure if there's something simple I'm missing or if it's an issue with the new OS. Anyone else have this issue? Solution anyone?\nanswered Jul 26 at 22:27\nLion in SD\n\n\nA: I'm a Mac OS X developer and I just finished adding Notification Center support to my app. For what it's worth, here's what I found out:\n\n\n*\n\n*By default, notifications (the alerts) are NOT shown if the application is already frontmost (this explains why alerts refuse to show up sometimes, and you only see the notification in Notification Center). This is up to given applications to overwrite and it is not very straightforward, so do expect most applications to not show notifications when they're active. In my opinion, this is very annoying.\n\n*The application, after sending a notification still has a lot of control over that given notification. It can remove it from your screen at any time it wants, regardless of the settings you have. Basically, if Safari, for some reason was set to remove notifications after X seconds, it will do that, your settings do not matter.\n\n\nI have no idea if this is a bug in Safari or Notification Center, or both. However, I am fairly confident that there is nothing you can do about the second issue (there might be a hidden defaults setting for the first one, but I haven't heard of it). I did check the WebKit API Specification, to make sure it's not something that the individual websites are doing, and you can rule out websites from your suspect's list, because they do not have any control over the notifications.\nI guess we'll have to wait and see if Apple will address this in its next bug fix release (10.9). However, by the looks of it, not showing notifications when the app is frontmost is a \"feature\", so don't get your hopes up.\n", "Q: Can't access About.com from my Macbook pro 2011 (lion then mtn lion), no matter what I try Using chrome, firefox, and safari gives me this type of warning: \"Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at www.about.com\".

As you all know, Dock icons can be removed by simply clicking them and dragging them out of the Dock.

I went back and forth between rubbing the qtip on the metal standoff and then using the other side of the qtip to rapidly move the standoff spring action up and down to work in the wd40.  After doing this for all of the standoffs my bottom cover no longer makes any noise.  \nI cannot stress enough that I used a TINY amount of WD40 and was EXTREMELY careful not to use enough that it could possibly run off into other parts of the motherboard.  WD40 is no electrically conductive.  \nAlso, I see that the accepted solution is to put electrical tape on the bottom of the case itself.  I see that this has worked for other people but in my case it was clear that the noise was coming from unlubricated springs in those standoffs.  Also, you can see that there are cutouts in that black sheet that is attached to the metal bottom case specifically where these standoffs make contact with the case.  The standoffs are metal and the case is metal, so I did not feel it was appropriate to put electrical tape in between these two metal surfaces to block electrical conductivity seeing as the laptop was clearly designed to allow for this metal-on-metal contact.\n", "Q: MacBook unplugged from external monitor thinks it's still the Secondary Desktop I've got a MacBook Pro 13\" with Lion plugged into an external VGA monitor.

Before installing Mountain Lion and using iCloud for the first time, I would like to know how it can be configured.\nMy iMac has three standard user accounts and one admin account.

Here are my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does that Apple ID apply for the whole Mac, for the admin account alone or for one standard account to be specified?\n\n*Is it possible to assign a distinct Apple ID to each user account?\n\nA: That apple ID applies only to the user account that is created during the setup process. If you look in System Preferences, you'll notice the following option called \"Apple ID\", under a test account I created:\n\nAdditionally, when logging into the new test account, I was presented with the iCloud login screen which you saw during initial setup of the OS install on your Mac. \nIf you restored your iMac from a backup, or installed Mountain Lion over Lion, \nyou will already have access to those accounts without seeing the iCloud setup screen. In that case, open System Preferences, click on Users & Groups, and set up your iCloud account as you wish.\nSo, one iCloud account per local account. This would appear to be the case on Lion as well.\n\nA: One aspect of iCloud can only be active for one account per hardware device.  Find My Mac is exclusive - no matter how many accounts or even how many OS installs you run (say booting from multiple OS - Lion externally and Mountain Lion internally), only one iCloud account gets to find your Mac's location.\nApart from that, each account can use it's own iCloud account fully with no restrictions.

After upgrading to Mountain Lion today, I'm noticing the Reminders and Notes apps now having been added to the dock.\nGreat way to discover those apps if you're not aware of them, but I'm not going to use them.\nAs such, I tried removing them, which seems to work (both dragging them off and right-click and remove from dock), but after logging out and back in, they're back.\nWhat's the quick-tip to get rid of those from the dock permanently?\n\nA: The only unremovable Dock icon is the Finder, removing anything else should result in it staying removed.  There is nothing special about Reminders and Notes, and it's always annoyed me that they put in icons for things like launchpad etc when they have system wide keystrokes or gestures for the same task.\nOne point to bear in mind tho, is that to prevent people accidentally removing items from the dock (accidental drags are apparently more common on Magic Mouse/Trackpad users) the distance you have to drag the icon away from the dock is significantly increased.  Try it, drag an icon away, and see how far it has to travel before you get the \"puff of smoke\" icon that indicates it will remove it.  Letting go before seeing this cursor change will just boomerang your icon back into the dock.\n\nA: OK, the problem here looks like it was access rights on the file that stores my dock contents.\nApparently, using TinkerTool to prevent changes to the dock sets the access rights on that file, and doesn't change them back when I disable that feature.\nI'll open a question on superuser.com about what the correct access rights should be.\nBasically, this fixed it:\nsudo chmod 777 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist\nkillall Finder\n\nBut I don't like the 777 preferences.\nEDITED: OK, turns out that this is TinkerTool's doing. To prevent accidentally removing things from the dock, which I tended to do to begin with, I used TinkerTool to disable modifications to the dock. This changes the access rights on that file. However, if I disable that feature, which I had done, the access rights are not changed back to what they where before. As such, after changing the access rights above, restarting finder, removing the items, and then locking down the dock again with TinkerTool, the changes stayed.\n\nA: Drag them to the trash - which will highlight 'Remove from dock'.\n\nA: On every boot, OSX 10.8 always checks the dock for certain apps (Launchpad, Appstore, Reminders, Notes, etc.), and adds them back to the dock if they've been removed. (No idea why--this seems odd & annoying to me, too.)\nThe solution is to edit the system plist file (/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dockfixup.plist), removing the configuration elements that define these \"fixups\". To modify this file, you'll need admin privileges--TextWrangler should automatically prompt you, when you start changing things.\nIn the plist file, find the \"add-app\" key, which should be followed immediately by an  element, which contains several  elements:\n    <key>add-app</key>\n    <array>\n            <dict>\n                ...\n            </dict>\n            <dict>\n                ...\n            </dict>\n            ...\n    </array>\n\nYou can selectively remove just the  elements for certain apps, or you can remove them all.\nAfter you save those changes, you'll still have to manually remove the offending dock icons. However, on future reboots, the system will not automatically add those apps back to the dock. (You can always add them back manually, if you want.)\n\nA: I had this problem too but just discovered if you right click on the icon on the dock and go to Options and click Remove from Dock it goes away!\n", "Q: Is there a shortcut key to bring up the Launch Pad on an older apple keyboard? It's a white iMac, I think perhaps 2007 model. Here is the keyboard currently:\n\nThere is one that works for Mission Control, but not for Launch Pad.\nDo you think there is a way to configure one to work?\n\nA: Check in System Preferences > Mission Control what key is assigned for Launchpad. You can customize the settings of course.\nNote that per default pressing F11 for example will work as a media key (change volume in your case). So you need to press fn+F11 instead.\n\nA: You could simply configure a shortcut of your liking for it in:\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Launchpad & Dock\n\n", "Q: As of Mountain Lion, Google Chrome has asked for permission to view my contacts. Does this mean that it has likely had unrestricted access before? I'm not sure why Chrome wants this access, but since prior to Mountain Lion there wasn't a prompt for this, it makes me think that it must have been looking at them this whole time. Right?\n\nA: Yes, right.  Round about Tiger (10.4) Apple introduced a nice neat way for apps to integrate with your address book and calendar data stores etc.  At the time it was a novel thing that allowed for any number of clever calendar widgets etc, and stuff that could happily replace the in-built tools (or enhance them) without you having to change anything at an account or data level.\nThese days, because of a number of high profile mobile apps getting in trouble for doing what the desktop OS have been doing for years, they are cranking up the security and privacy options.\n\nA: To turn this off and eliminate the error messages, you can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the Chrome menu  on the browser toolbar. Select Settings.\n\n*Click Show advanced settings and find the \"Passwords and forms\" section.\n\n*Click \"Manage Autofill Settings\" \n\n*Deselect the \"Include addresses from my Address Book card\" checkbox.\n\n", "Q: How can I make windows the same size on my 17\" MacBook Pro & 23\" HD Cinema Display? I just purchased a new 17\" MacBook Pro and I am using it with my 23\" Apple HD Cinema Display. I have both displays set to 1920 x 1200 but all the windows and text are smaller on my MacBook Pro. How can I make onscreen elements the same size?\n\nA: The MacBook Pro has the same number of pixels as the Cinema Display but a smaller area to show them on. That makes the pixels on the MacBook Pro smaller. Since windows and text are a certain number of pixels in size, screens with smaller pixels will make them appear smaller.\nThe solution is to choose a lower resolution on the screen with smaller pixels (the MBP in your case). Choosing a lower resolution means that each pixel of data will be drawn across multiple physical pixels, making everything bigger.\nI can't tell you exactly what resolution to use on your MBP to get things close to the same size, but it shouldn't be hard to find out with a little testing.\nOpen System Preferences -> Displays and go to the Display tab of the window on your MBP.\nCheck the Scaled radio button and pick the second resolution on the list that appears. If that isn't big enough, move on to the next (lower) resolution, etc. Stop when you get to one that makes things similar in size across both displays.\n\nNote that, as a result of this, your MBP's display may not look as nice. Things won't look as crisp and some resolutions will have to stretch things sideways.\n", "Q: Safari 6: Open and close tabs with middle click?

I have Eclipse Indigo Service Release 1 version and the lastest SDK installed.\nIf I upgrade to Mountain Lion does it mean I have reinstall the SDK?\nI have folders in the root Macintosh HD such as android-sdk-macosx, are these deleted?\n\nA: No, nothing is deleted when updating. A common sense would be to back-up everything as things can go wrong, but if everything go right, nothing is deleted! Even opened apps are reopened after update.\nIt must be noted though that the first time you launch Eclipse, OS X will tell you that it will install Java first, as Java is not installed by default anymore.\n", "Q: How can I re-run the initial Setup Assistant on Mountain Lion? As described in my write-up on custom keyboard layouts, in some situations it can be useful to re-run the Setup Assistant (the app that you get when you start a new Mac for the first time, or do a fresh OS X install) to change some settings for the current user.\nThis used to work fine in OS X 10.7 Lion and earlier versions:\nsudo \"/System/Library/CoreServices/Setup Assistant.app/Contents/MacOS/Setup Assistant\"\n\nHowever, in OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, this command exits early with the following message:\n\n...System identity already exists for domain com.apple.systemdefault. Done.\n\nIt seems the Setup Assistant has gotten “smarter” in that it detects all the settings for the current user have already been entered. Is there any way to bypass this detection so I can run the Setup Assistant again (to change the global system keyboard layout)?\n\nA: Actually, you should be able to do it by removing a hidden system file which tells OS X that setup has run. Delete this file:\n/var/db/.AppleSetupDone\n\nIt's a hidden file, so you will have to remove it using Terminal, or show hidden files in Finder. You can remove the file like so:\nrm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\n\nTo show hidden files in Finder, type the following into the Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true\n\n…and then restart Finder.\n\nA: You can easily redownload the installer from the Mac App Store and re-run it on the same computer.

I'm specifically looking to design a custom action for LaunchBar so that I can initiate a tweet from that utility. Since Notification Center has a \"Click to tweet\" button, I wondered if Notification Center has any hooks that would allow me to script this without waiting for the developer of the program add a function to perform this action.\n\nA: Apps can hook into the sharing options with the new NSSharingService API. It sounds like custom LaunchBar actions can be made with any UNIX executable file, so you could probably write a small command line tool (or you may need to build an actual app — you'll have to test it out) which activates this API (using NSSharingServiceNamePostOnTwitter), and that should display the tweet dialog.\nUpdate: to initiate a tweet from AppleScript, you can do the following:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Notification Center\"\n        -- activate notification center\n        if (count of UI elements) is 1 then click first menu bar's first menu bar item\n        -- click the tweet button\n        click button 1 of UI element 1 of row 2 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of window \"Window\"\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nFurthermore, you can toggle the \"Show Alerts and Banners\" / do not disturb mode:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Notification Center\"\n        key down option\n        click first menu bar's first menu bar item\n        key up option\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n(This is all very specific to the current window layout of Notification Center and is likely to break with future OS X updates — but there will probably be easy fixes.)\n\nA: None that I know of (and in fact I think that having a Twitter/Facebook quick post area inside the notifications area is actually dumb (should be a widget really), and I have turned it off) but you can use the command line to both send a read tweets, as mentioned in this webpage, extracts below:\n\nTo display a list of tweets (replace osxdaily with a twitter username of your choice):\ncurl -s http://twitter.com/osxdaily | grep '' | cut -d\">\" -f2 | cut -d\"<\" -f1\n\nTo update your twitter status:\ncurl -u your_user:your_password -d status='This is My update' https://twitter.com/statuses/update.xml\n\n\nA: Taking this all one step further and putting together what we've learned so far, here's a fully programatic tweet:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Notification Center\"\n        click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1\n        click button 1 of UI element 1 of row 2 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of window \"window\"\n        keystroke \"Content of the tweet\"\n        keystroke \"D\" using {command down, shift down}\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nOf course this is fragile, but for now, it works.

This functionality seems to have disappeared in OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion. Is there a way to restore (no pun intended) this feature from with the System Preferences or perhaps a Terminal trick?\n\nA: Undo quitting of all applications\nApple has slightly changed the wording but the location for this setting is still the same as in Lion:\nSystem Preferences → General → Close windows when quitting an application\nUndo quitting for a specific application\nThis works only with Close windows when quitting an application disabled at the same time.\nType the following command in the Terminal. Then restart the specific application.\nIn general the syntax is:\ndefaults write com.\"producer\".\"program-name\" ApplePersistenceIgnoreState YES\n\nThus, in your case (Safari.app) it is:\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari ApplePersistenceIgnoreState YES\n\nYou can undo this by using the parameter NO instead.\nIf you prefer a graphical interface, you can use TinkerTool. But the current version 4.9 only supports the toggling on a per app basis in Lion. I'll update this answer when TinkerTool adds this feature for Mountain Lion as well.\n\nA: If you already have the \"Close windows when quitting an application\" setting disabled, but certain apps don't restore their windows (while most other apps do), this fix worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences -> General, and check the \"Close windows…\" setting.\n\n*Close System Preferences\n\n*Reopen System Preferences -> General, uncheck the same setting, and close it again.\n\n\nThe setting should now be applied uniformly across all apps. At the very least, this fixed the issue where Safari would not restore its windows (even though other apps were doing so).

You can also download most of the files from there, but normal users are stuck.\nSo, if you only have one Mac (and any number of iOS devices), then the iCloud part of Preview and TextEdit is useless, other than that it provides another method of manually backing up a select number of files.\n\nA: Each app has it's own container for want of a better word, in which to store it's documents.  It may well be possible for an app on iOS and OS X to both use the same container ID in order to share documents between platforms (this must be possible, apps like Day One that use iCloud Sync are able to share this way) but it's not possible for one app to access the container of another app, unless it can prove that is effectively is the same app, by having the key to the container.\nIn essence, you need to learn a new way of doing things if you intend to store a lot of stuff in iCloud, and for those documents that are not particularly app-specific, like PDFs, TXT files etc, then maybe deciding iCloud isn't the best host is the way forward\n\nA: If you're not terribly concerned with formatting, most of your plain text notes that you might otherwise save in TextEdit could just go into Notes instead. This way, they are on all your Macs and iOS devices. \nBonus: you can set up (and rename) folders in the Mac version of Notes, but you can't do that on iOS. You can see those folders and the corresponding organization and add/edit/delete notes in those folders. \nThe only other benefit to TextEdit I can see (speaking of only plain text notes) would be Versions. \n\nA: using iCloud Drive w/ iOS 9 it is possible.\n\"On your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch with iOS 9, you can access your files from the iCloud Drive app. To show or hide the app, go to Settings > iCloud > iCloud Drive. Next to Show on Home Screen, choose On or Off. On your PC with Windows 7 or later and iCloud for Windows, you can go to iCloud Drive in File Explorer\"\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201104\nnecro, I know.

Recently I am facing a problem with my phone. When I set a wall paper, it is not showing behind the icons. Of course it is showing the picture when my mobile locks. The background behind the icons is plain black. How can I change the wallpaper behind the icons?\n\nA: In the settings app, there should be an option to change the lock screen background,  the home screen background, and an option to change both. You are likely changing just the lock screen, not the home screen. Try changing the home screen background.\n\nA: Did you recently update it to iOS 4.2.1? If so, then I'm afraid you're out of luck, as that feature was dropped to help with performance issues. Unless you jailbreak it, you're stuck with the black screen.\n", "Q: Youtube on AppleTV, continuously? Is there a way, with the current AppleTV, to watch a bunch of Youtube videos without having to select each one by hand?\nThat is, either by entering some keywords to search for, or by providing it with a 'playlist' somehow.\nOrder isn't important.  Exact matching isn't important.\nA method for doing this that involved streaming from a Mac would be fine, too, though I don't have a Mac capable of Airplay Mirroring, so that specific feature won't help me.\n\nA: I asked at an Apple store, and basically the answer is \"no\".\nThe best workaround we could come up with is creating a Youtube account, making a playlist on Youtube, adding all the videos I want to that, and then playing them through AppleTV.  It's not exactly convenient, though.\n\nA: Yes there is a way. \nJust add your videos to your \"watch later\" playlist. \nAnd just play. \nIt will play all the videos uninterrupted. \nN-joy\n", "Q: Can Mountain Lion be used as a guest OS under 10.7 Lion? I'm installing Mountain Lion on one of my Macs and I'd like to test it (under virtualization) on another. This other (for a variety of reasons) will continue to run Lion. \nCan I use VMware Fusion to virtualize Mountain Lion (client) under Lion (client) legally? Does the virtualization section of the license allow this?\n\nA: As far as the license says, no.\nYou have the right to:\n(iii) to install, use and run up to two (2) additional copies or instances\nof the Apple Software within virtual operating system environments on each \nMac Computer you own or control that is already running the Apple Software, \nfor purposes of: (a) software development; (b) testing during software \ndevelopment; (c) using OS X Server; or (d) personal, non-commercial use.\n\nSo, as far as the license goes, you must already be running Mountain Lion in order to virtualize it.\n", "Q: How can I perform the swipe gesture for quickly accessing Notification Center? The swipe gesture for accessing Notification Centre is the same as for going back in Safari (amongst others). How can I consistently get it to do one or the other to stop me using the wrong gesture?\n\nA: Put two finger on the right side of trackpad, your finger should be outside of trackpad area.\nThen swipe to the left, inside to trackpad area.\nIt works beautifully for me.\nI created video how to do it, you can see it here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4znRZBAtE1s\n\nA: You might wonder why a two finger gesture on the trackpad from the right edge to the left edge doesn't always allow you to quickly access the brand new Notification Center in Mountain Lion.\nApple's instructions state:\n\nSwipe to the left from the right edge of the trackpad to visit Notification Center anywhere in OS X. Even from a full-screen app.\n\nWhat they actually meant was a swipe gesture starting from the very edge if not outside from the right side of your trackpad and then finishing on the left side within you trackpad. This is easier on a notebook trackpad, you can start on the wrist area and swipe in, it's harder on an external one tho.\nIf you start too far within your trackpad you won't be able to perform the gesture for quickly accessing Notification Center, or you will trigger the page forwards/backwards gesture instead.\n", "Q: Will Mountain Lion run on an early 2008 MacBook White? I know it isn't in Apple's list of supported Macs, but I want to know if anyone has tried it. \nAlso, my Mac has 4GB of ram and plenty of disk space. It currently runs Lion.\n\nA: As Steve Moser says there is no support for 32 bit drivers and Mountain Lion will refuse to install on the macs which had 32 bits drivers (someone seems to be too lazy to rewrite them?).\nIf this answer is not the one you want to hear, then you can install Mountain Lion the hard way. Because there is a way (which worked for the preview).\nYou will need another compatible mac (support) and you will have to do some hard drive switching.\nThe idea goes as follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get Mountain Lion\n\n*On the target Mac remove the hard drive (target drive)\n\n*On the support Mac insert the hard drive (USB or internally)\n\n*Install Mountain Lion on the target drive\n\n*Put the target drive back in the target Mac\n\n*Boot on the target drive holding Cmd + V And write down the ID given in the error message \"Incompatible Mac detected: ...\"\n\n*Put the target drive back to the support Mac and on this drive in /System/Library/CoreServices edit PlatformSupport.plist\n\n\n*\n\n*Add your board ID in the SupportedBoardIds section.\n\n*Add your model ID in the SupportedModelProperties section.\n\n\n*Put the target drive to the target Mac\n\n*Boot\n\n\nYou should be able to get to the desktop but without hardware graphics support.\nTo enable the graphics hardware support you will have to install the right kernel extentions. You could use kexthelper.\n\nEDIT: To avoid all the hard drive switching and messing with internal components you can boot the target Mac in the so conveniently named \"target mode\" and connect it to the support Mac on which you could install the OS to the target drive and then boot on the target drive to edit the plist files.\n\nA: No, Mountain Lion requires 64-bit graphics drivers and mac formatted drivers don't exist for the graphics in the early 2008 White MacBook.\n\nA: \nMountain lion will run on a early white MacBook.

I have a mid-2007 MacBook Pro, the one with the trackpad that had the physical button on along the bottom edge. The trackpad is not well and using it can cause it to stick and freak out OS X.\nIs there a way to disable the trackpad that's a little more low-level than the method outlined in this question and answer? A BIOS setting perhaps? I'd like the trackpad to never be useable on the unit, whether an external mouse is connected to it or not.\n\nA: You should be able to do this by unloading the kernel extension (kext) that controls the trackpad from the command line.\nsudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleUSBTopCase.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBTrackpad.kext to disable it. Change kextunload to kextload to re-enable it.\nWhen I tested this, it complained that it couldn't unload the kext, but it appeared to disable the trackpad (and it didn't show in System Prefs) despite the warnings.\nWarning for Magic Trackpad Users: I don't have a Magic Trackpad, so I don't know whether this kext is responsible for that device or not. Careful testing this out, you may accidentally disable all your mouse inputs at once.\nEdit: I did a little more digging, and there is a \"AppleBluetoothMultitouch.kext\", which sounds like it's responsible for the Magic Trackpad, so it's likely you can disable the internal trackpad independent of any external ones.\n", "Q: Hide username from menu bar In Mountain Lion, my full name is displayed at the right of the menu bar (between the time and the search icon, to be specific).

Now that Safari 6 has been released for Lion, I can't seem to find anywhere to get it.\n\n\n*\n\n*The Safari download page redirects to the main Safari page with no download link.\n\n*Apple's developer site, Apple's downloads and even the download for Safari 5.1.5 all link to the Safari download page (which as I mentioned doesn't have a download link).\n\n*It is not listed in Software Update.\n\n\nHere's my Software Update history showing that it hasn't been installed without me noticing:\n\nHere's the Safari build I currently have:\n\nAm I missing something?\n\nA: I have run into the same issue.\nI have the developer preview of Safari 6 (Beta) installed on Lion and now that ML is out, I can no longer get the uninstaller from Apple's Developer Connection Website.  Like you said, all the links are stale and point me in the direction of the Safari Website with no download links.\nAll direct links to the Safari 6 Beta Uninstaller, like this one: \nUninstaller\nDo not work and say that your session has expired.\nUnfortunately, at the moment, I have not been able to find a copy of that uninstaller or any older version of Safari to reinstall.  Usually though, the beta version is just superseded by newer versions that will be coming out eventually or they will release an update for beta users, or reissue links for the uninstaller.  Unless you can find the uninstaller somewhere, I would suggest doing nothing. Do not uninstall safari yourself or delete things, this might cause issues that could just as easily be fixed with patience. It suck to mess things up and make things worse when technically the Safari 6 Beta works just like Safari 6 for Lion.\nI know it isn't the solution you were looking for, but everything will work itself out, either with Apple fixing things, or an update that just installs the newer version for you.\nI hope that it helps.\n\nA: I had expected the download to be on the Safari web site or the Safari Developer Center, neither of which has a link to the download.\nI did manage to find it using de_an777's link. That link took me to a \"your session is expired\" message as he described but after logging in I was at https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action.\nUnchecking all of the options on the left except Safari gave me options to download the uninstaller. I'm now back on 5.1.7 and Software Update is downloading the release of Safari 6 right now.\n\nA: Safari 6 seems to be available from Software Update today (31 July 2012) for me (I had Safari 6 Preview 3 installed). \nUninstallers for previews 1 and 2 could be found on the Apple Developer site, but the uninstaller for preview 3 was no longer available there. I tried the uninstaller for preview 2, but that did not remove the preview 3 installation.\n", "Q: Time Machine says \"Waiting to Backup\" after ML upgrade I just upgraded to ML and my Time Machine says \"Waiting to Backup\".\nIs the cause of this got to do anything with Spotlight indexing?\n\nA: It's possible.

I figure if it works just as well as the $200 pairs, why not! I am open to other suggestions as well. \n\nA: Yes, you can buy third party RAM.  I usually buy Crucial RAM.  As long as it is made to be compatible with your machine (Same Bus Speed and such).  Usually, you can search these companies sites for RAM for your specific make and model MBP and they will have suggestions for it.  \nYou can sometimes even put in more RAM than Apple says it can.  The companies test newer machines to see how much RAM they can handle.  For instance, the new current gen MBP only supports 8GB according to Apple, but 16GB of RAM will still work and won't cause any problems. It will work perfectly. \nI am running 8GB of RAM in my machine, it cost me 46 dollars with shipping over 200 dollars from Apple.\nJust be sure to keep you old RAM just in case your new RAM goes bad, which it most likely won't, but that way you have back up RAM to use in just such an occasion. \nI hope that helps.\n", "Q: Is there a way to save notes to the iPhone itself and not to any account for syncing? On the iPhone and presumably applies to the iPad as well, running iOS 5.1.1.\nRight now, I've got my iCloud and Gmail account on my phone syncing everything including notes. When creating a note using the stock Notes app, notes are saved to my default account (which happens to be my Gmail account). However, I would like to save some notes to the phone itself and not synced with any account. I do not see an option to explicitly enable this option.\nBut I've also discovered a funny quirk that seems to allow this option to unexpectedly show up:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable the syncing of notes for all accounts \n\n*Add a note (which I'll refer to as \"the note\") to the Notes app (making sure there are no existing notes) \n\n*Re-enable notes syncing with accounts \n\n*Go back to Notes and the option to save to the iPhone only will show up\n\n\nQuirk: Delete the note, reopen the Notes app, and that option to save to your iPhone only disappears.\nIs this supposed to be normal? Is there a way to keep the \"On My iPhone\" option on at all times?\n\nA: In Notes.app when you are in the \"On this iPhone\" section, any notes you create will exist only on the phone (not synced with google or iCloud). The option disappears when all your notes are synced, presumably to encourage you to save to iCloud by default, but the solution is simply to leave one in the \"on this iPhone\" folder.\n\nA: When you go in the Mail, Contacts & Calendar menu, you can go in the account settings and select what is syncing, including Notes. Just disable them there. It will probably ask you to remove synced notes to de-activate syncing (I hate that)\n\nA: In iOS 10, all you have to do is go to\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > Notes\n\n*Toggle \"On My iPhone Account\" to on (for me this was the last option).\n\n\nThis will create a section in the Notes app called \"On My iPhone\".  Notes saved in this section are exactly that – on your phone and not backed up to the cloud.\n", "Q: How exactly does the new Mountain Lion filesystem work? I heard that the new filesystem only allows one level of folders. How does it work exactly ? Will my existing beautifully organized folder-tree be collapsed into one folder when I upgrade? As a software developper, I really need to work with multiple level folder hierarchy, and I can't imagine living without this.\nI'm waiting to upgrade until I get better information about this. The article I read doesn't make me comfortable with such a flattening of the OS X filesystem if indeed that has happened. Can someone shed more light on this please?\n\nA: The filesystem in Mountain Lion is exactly the same as the one in Lion.  It's no different.\nWhat you are referring to, is the document storage facility within apps that use iCloud.  If you store your documents within iCloud enabled apps, then you are as you say limited to a depth of 2 when it comes to file structure, so you can store all your files at the top level, or you have have folders, but you cannot have subfolders within those folders.\nThe whole point is to simplify the storage medium, ensuring that files created within apps are held by those apps only, and not nested in some obscure directory structure whereby as Siracusa points out \"direct interaction with the filesystem is where usability goes to die\"\nSee this for more detail.\n\nA: Don't worry, the filesystem is really the same as in Lion. What you may have misunderstood is how the new iCloud integration works. Every app that supports it (it may even be built-in if you use the system-standard open/save components, I'm unsure) will display an iCloud tab in the Open/Save dialogs, but this is in addition to the standard Finder hierarchy that's been around forever.\nThis new iCloud storage doesn't allow nested folders, so you only get one level of hierarchy. The idea is to keep things simple à la iOS (it looks like and is conceptually the same as organizing apps on iOS).\nFor more detail and description, check out the iCloud and You section of John Siracusa's Mountain Lion review at Ars Technica.\n\nA: As far as I know, what you're saying applies only to iCloud... MacOS has been using HFS+ (HIERARCHICAL File System +) since 1998, and, as the name implies, file system hierarchy is a corner stone in it.\n", "Q: Can I increase the default font size for the Notes in Mountain Lion?

These monitors are typically no-frills no-thrills Dual-link DVI only, so I would be purchasing an Apple-branded Dual-Link mini-DisplayPort to dual-link DVI adapter and connecting it via the Thunderbolt port on each laptop. The specs for both of these say that it should be able to drive a display with this many pixels without issue.\nIs there anything else that I should be taking into consideration other than poor 3D performance at that high of a resolution, or should this setup be fine given the proper adapter? \n\nA: It should be fine. Apple themselves offer to sell you a 27\" display along with the laptop so it clearly is capable of driving that many pixels.\nI myself use a 15\" 2012 MBP Retina with one of those mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapters (hooked up to a Hazro 27\" monitor, so cheap no-frills much like you're considering) and its been pretty good. This is in addition to also driving a cinema display of the same size, so I have two external monitors.\nI read a lot of reviews around the Internet before buying it, and there's a few horror stories (most of them say make sure you get one with firmware 1.03, but there's no way to tell what firmware you have, till you plug it in! - fortunately mine was 1.03 from the off).\nThe only issue I have with mine is occasionally (maybe once or twice a day) the Hazro monitor goes blank for a second, then comes back on. I have no idea whats causing this, the MBP doesn't even notice (doesn't try to rearrange windows or anything) and its infrequent enough that I just live with it. It may be a slight incompatibility between some of the equipment.\nI do suffer from some occasional oddities if I unplug the external monitors while the MBP is asleep, then wake it up (the internal screen won't come on, I think its the graphics card drivers crashing at the unexpected situation) but I don't believe thats related to the Dual-Link DVI.\n\nA: I use a 11\" 2011 MBA (i7) with an Apple Display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 with no problems, so you shouldn't have any problems with it (My previous monitor was an HP 27\" with DVI and I used the MiniDisplayPort-To-DVI adapter. \nThe only reason why I changed to the Apple one is because this was brought by the company I work for :)\n\nA: I purchased the Apple Mini DisplayPort -> Dual-Link DVI adapter to run a 30-inch Cinema Display from a Retina Display MacBook Pro. It's a little sketchy. It works, but I'm experiencing a bit of flickering and some odd resolution issues when I open new browser windows, etc.\nIt's not the best solution, it seems... But I don't know if these are OS or hardware-related.\n", "Q: How to make ⌘⌫ delete a line of text in Messages? The shortcut ⌘+⌫ normally deletes a line of text in a text field. But in the new Messages app in Mountain Lion, this is the shortcut for \"Close Conversation…\" (or, if you choose \"Save history when conversations are closed\" in the preferences, it's \"Delete Conversation…\").\nIs there a way to disable this shortcut such that ⌘+⌫ can again be used for deleting text?\n\nA: You can change the shortcut for \"Close Conversation\" to something else, that should avoid the conflict. To do this, open Keyboard Preferences, and then go to the \"Keyboard Shortcuts\" tab. Click Application Shortcuts, then the + button to add a new one. You should get a popup like this one (I'm still on Lion, but I don't believe they changed much):\n\nChange the application to Messages, enter the proper menu title (if it uses an ellipsis, you may have to enter that exact character — not just three periods — by hitting optionshift;), then enter in a shortcut you're unlikely to use.\nIt's also possible to disable a keyboard shortcut from the command line, rather than just setting it to some obscure command. However I haven't tested this on Mountain Lion or Messages app, so no guarantees.\nIf you're comfortable with the command line, the proper command would likely be defaults write com.apple.Messages NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add \"Close Conversation…\" nil. However I don't have access to Mountain Lion, so the com.apple.Messages part is just a guess. You may want to test first by trying defaults read com.apple.Messages and see if it pops up with an error. It should spit out a long list of plist-formatted preferences, if it doesn't the app identifier (com.apple.Messages) is probably wrong, so you'll need to do some digging to find out what it is.\nAgain let me stress that I haven't tested this second option on Mountain Lion or Messages at all, it's just based on how things work in previous versions of OS X.\n\nA: Control-K deletes the selection, or if there is no selection to the end of the current line. This works in any true Cocoa text view.\n\nA: *\n\n*Quit Messages.\n\n*Open a terminal window and do:\ndefaults write com.Apple.iChat NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add \"Close Conversation…\" nil\n\nNote that's a real ellipses character, either type ⌥; or just copy/paste from here.\n\n*Re-start Messages. Both Command-Delete (⌘⌫) and Option-Delete (⌥⌫) will now work as editing commands.\n\nA: I use ⌘ + Shift + Left to select all the text on the line and then hit ⌫. To select all the text, I'd substitute that with ⌘ + A.  It's not perfect, but it works.\nEdit:\nBased on CanuckSkier's answer, I've gotten the delete conversation message to\ngo away with the following command on the Terminal:\n\ndefaults write com.Apple.iChat NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add \"Close Conversation…\" nil\n\nIt's also a little cleaner than using the System Preferences method, because you have no command instead of an extra obscure one.\n\nA: Open System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts.\nQuit Messages if it is opened. Click the + at the bottom of the list on the right. In the pop-up, select the “Messages” application, enter Close Conversation… (with proper ellipsis, as @CanuckSkier stressed) in “Menu Title”. In “Keyboard Shortcut”, type ⌥⇧a, for example. We'll redefine the “a” right after.\nOpen ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iChat.plist with your favorite text editor (it can even be TextEdit), and look for (⌘F) NSUserKeyEquivalents. You should find the string ~$a somewhere nearby, which is our encoded previously-defined shortcut. Simply replace the “a” with the special character “⌫” (you can copy-and paste it from this post). Save the file.\nThis should do the trick to define ⌥⇧⌫ as the shortcut  :)\n", "Q: Mountain Lion: AirPlay doesn't show up (but it works in iTunes) I have mountain lion and Apple TV. iTunes only displays the option for AirPlay.

Here is a list of all supported Apple Computers:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4080592?start=0&tstart=0\nDepending on the Year and Model of your machine, you may not be able to use AirPlay mirroring.  \nIf your computer is not listed as being compatible, then it will not work. \nYou can alternatively use a program called air parrot which will do roughly the same thing, just not as nicely.\nThe reason has to do with the graphics cards that the machines use, as explained here.\nI hope that this answer helps you out.\n\nA: Airplay mirroring is for full system side mirroring of the whole OS, not limited to just a video, or slideshow etc.  As such, you computer (like mine) may well be able to use airplay within iTunes, whilst not being compatible for mirroring the whole display.\n", "Q: Twitter And Facebook Integration Missing In Notification center? I have recently installed Mountain Lion and noticed that 'Sharing' via Facbook and Twitter are missing!\nI have checked the System Preferences to enable this feature but I am stuck. Can anyone help me?\n\nA: For twitter:\nGo to your system preferences, type in twitter \nyou should get a drop down menu called Set up a Twitter account:\n\nclick on Set up a Twitter account and you should be taken to a screen where you can enter your twitter details\nnow for Facebook you'll have to wait to the fall of this year (2012) since apple will add this feature later. ( or if you have a OSX developer account you could get early access to the beta version ) \nnote: you also can setup 'share' accounts for vimeo and flickr:\n\n\nA: The Facebook integration wasn't available when this question was asked - it was added in OS X 10.8.2 in September 2012.\nTo activate Twitter and Facebook sharing, you must first configure at least one Twitter and / or Facebook account via System Preferences -> Mail, Contacts & Calendars -> Add Account -> Twitter (or Facebook). Once you've successfully added a Twitter account, the Twitter widget should appear at the top of Notification Center.\n\nA: You MUST Log off and log back on!!!

Hello I just got my first ever MBP Retina and I was wondering if this is normal :\nSometimes I try to scroll upwards or downwards (natural way) and the mouse moves instead of scrolling the page up and down. Im not sure why this happens, is there a specific way how I should position my fingers on the trackpad ? Or perhaps the distance between each finger ?\nRegards\n\nA: Normally, this means you just don't put both fingers at the same time. Try sticking your index and the other finger together and moving your arm or your wrist instead of trying to move the individual fingers. You'll get used to it.\nThe animated videos in the System Preferences -> Trackpad are a good example of the safest way to do the gesture.

When a row in a table from a webpage is copied to the Numbers app, such as\n2       3    4      5\n\nand another row is copied, as some \"deltas\" (minor addition or subtraction):\n+0.25   0    0   -0.5\n\nThen the numbers are added up vertically.  The number in the first column adds up to 2, while the last column adds up to 4.5.  So the first column is incorrect, and the last column is correct -- I think the reason is +0.25 is treated as a string, while -0.5 is treated as a number.\nIs there a way to make it work on Numbers?   (manual editing is not preferred, as it is error prone and there are actually a lot more numbers, and finding the + by eye and removing it can cause an error when it is not seen, and if there are 200 such numbers, then doing it 200 times by hand is quite a time consuming method.)\n(and actually, this happens on Google Apps as well)\n\nA: You can use the Search/Find functionality (Cmd-F) in Numbers to replace the + with \"nothing\". Don't worry about + in formulas, they won't get replaced. Summing the the rows should work ok afterwards.\n\nA: You can remove the + by using =VALUE(SUBSTITUTE(A1,\"+\",\"\")).\n", "Q: Password dialog box differs between Macs I upgraded a Mac in my lab (23\" iMac) to Lion. My MacBook Pro (mid 2007) is running Mountain Lion. For some reason the iMac is showing a different user password screen than my MBP - I can't figure out why. I like the new screen, and am trying to figure out why my MBP doesn't use it.\nMy MBP shows the \"old\" screen, with text boxes for user name and password, like this:\n\nThis screen hasn't changed on my MBP since Tiger at least.\nThe iMac shows only the user icon and a spot for password, like this:\n\nI have a hard time thinking it's a hardware limitation issue. Could also be from some old setting, but the iMac used to use the old dialog too. (iMac originally ran Leopard, was upgraded to SL some time ago; same basic upgrade path as my MBP). Any ideas?\nUpdate: This is still happening in Mavericks. The single answer below does not address the issue - the preference pane affects the login screen only, not the password dialog that comes up after screen lock. (I'd vote the answer down - not because it's wrong, but because it doesn't directly address the problem - but I apparently can't do that yet.)  User icons on login look just as expected - round icon with user photo, but the password dialog after screensaver has not changed on my system since I bought it in 2007.\nPer my comments below, note that any new accounts created use the new screen lock dialog, but my account uses the old format - so this MUST be a per-user issue. I am having a hard time accepting that no one out there can tell me what needs to be changed. I've tried nuking basically ever preference I can find on my system. This is really minor but trying to figure out why it is even happening is driving me nuts.\nFor anyone else with this issue (and at least one person has emailed me to report they deal with this too!) - I did \"fix\" the problem thanks to a hard drive crash. I did a clean install, and did not copy any Apple system prefs from backup, just my files and program preferences. This resolved the problem, but didn't do so in a way that allowed me to figure out what the specific setting was that caused it in the first place!\n\nA: If you see the old unlock screen (gray window asking for your username and password) you have to delete the following file:\n/etc/cacloginconfig.plist\nIf you delete this file, you will see the new unlock screen (like the login screen) and touch ID will work again. \n\nSummary: If \"/etc/cacloginconfig.plist\" exists in 10.9 +, the screensaver unlock screen will be controlled by SecurityAgent (old style). Admins, when they successfully authenticate, will be allowed to take over the user's session.  Even if \"system.login.screensaver\" in AuthDB is set to \"use-login-window-ui\", this will be overridden by the existence of \"/etc/cacloginconfig.plist\". We will still be presented with the SecurityAgent style login window. \n\nMore Info: \nhttp://www.openradar.me/19177988\n\nA: Open the Users & Groups preference panel, and check the Display login window as: setting in Login Options (highlighted below). List of users should give the icon and password option, Name and password gives username and password text fields, albeit with the standard Lion grey linen background, not the dialog box you posted a picture of.\n\n\nA: The ScreenSaver dialog box changed in 10.7, switching to a user with a password dialog versus a user/pass combo dialog box.   There is a way to revert to the older method by changing a file to be set to the old style - but I can't remember off the top of my head how to do that.  \n\nA: I had this problem for a looong time, but finally found the solution (in a comment on https://randomoracle.wordpress.com/2015/02/16/smart-card-logon-for-os-x-part-iv/):\nsudo sc_auth remove -u [user]\n\nand then logout and back in.

(Backups are to a HD shared by a Lion Server on the network).\nProblem is When I choose Enter Time Machine (or double-click on the Time Machine application icon) nothing happens. No window. No error. No...nothing. I do notice that the remote HD mounts in the Finder... but that's it. \nI've reviewed a similar question which appears to be Lion (or perhaps Snow Leopard) related. But this is not acceptable as I don't want to erase my whole backup and start anew...as I can't afford to toss my only Lion backup.\nAnyone know what's up? And how to get my TM working properly under MLion?\n\nA: I had to reformat the external drive I use for Time Machine. It said there was a permissions problem, that it was Read Only - which it wasn't, and a look at the Info for it confirmed it was Read & Write. Still, I just erased the drive and started again. Works fine now.\n\nA: Have you tried going to Time Machine preferences and removing that drive from the list of backup drives? Try that, then re-add it. If that doesn't work, subtract it again, look at it in Disk Utility, perhaps rename it to something else, verify and repair the volume, eject then remount it, add to Time Machine backup list, attempt to enter TM again. If no luck, subtract, rename to the original name, re-add to backup list.\n\nA: While in opened time machine, press Shift-Command-C it will make TM clickable.

I have an app on my iPad that is basically a flashcard app that has questions and answers.  I want to put these questions and answers into an excel spreadsheet.  How would I extract the information out of the app?\n\nA: Unless the app has that functionality built in there is no easy way to go about this.\nApps keep all their data stored internally, giving you no way to access it unless they include an export feature or integration with iTunes Documents or something like Dropbox. You'll have to look at the documentation for the app you're using to see if it does.\nThe only potential solution I can think of would be to jailbreak so you have access to the iPad's internal filesystem and hope that you can find and extract the files. You would then have to either write a script or handle the conversion to XLS/CSV manually so the data can be used by Excel.\n", "Q: How do I report a bug in Safari 6.0? I found a bug in the latest version of Safari, how can I report it to Apple?\nThey no longer have the menu option to submit bug reports. I've tried searching Google but all the results are outdated.\n\nA: http://bugreport.apple.com is the canonical bug reporting mechanism. Once you have submitted an issue, it will be given a \"radar\" number and you will be treated to possibly the most archaic customer-facing bug reporting interfaces on the planet.\nYou will want to first select a developer account and agree to Apple's terms. In your case, the free of cost Safari developer program might be very useful if you care to know what changes are in store for Safari.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/devcenter/safari/index.action\n\nA: The OS X Feedback page has a bug report option (under \"Feedback Type\"). There's also http://bugreporter.apple.com, but I can't recall if that's limited to those with a Developer account (which is free to get).\n", "Q: How did I make this screen appear? This is a pretty general question, and I'm sorry I don't have a screenshot for you.\nFirst, some specs: I am running OSX Lion on a MacMini with a Magic Mouse.\nI had a screen appear and I'm not sure what it was or how it appeared. All my windows faded out and there was a list of files (and folders perhaps) listed above the dock station. This was not mission control or launchpad, I know that much. It also wasn't whatever the screen is that I get when I two-finger swipe to the right (with the calculator, clock, weather and other widgets).\nIf it helps at all, when it happend I was attempting to open my DropBox folder. I am often switching between a Windows PC and my Mac. I've been on my Windows computer lately and am used to opening DropBox by double-clicking the icon in the task bar. It was somewhere around that time this screen appeared. It disappeared when I clicked anywhere outside the file icons - which I unfortunately did pretty quickly.\nIf there is any other information I can give to possibly identify this screen, just let me know.\n\nA: It sounds like you probably activated the \"Application Windows\" feature of Mission Control (previously Exposé) in an app that didn't have any windows open.\nIt looks like this if you have no windows in that app open:\n\nThe list of files are recently opened files in that application (in this case, TextEdit).\nHow you opened it depends on your particular setup. You can set a keyboard shortcut for it in System Preferences under Mission Control, but I think there are also gestures. I don't have a Magic Mouse or Trackpad with gesture support handy, so I can't confirm exactly what may have activated it for you. Look through the Mouse panel in System Preferences for any reference to Exposé or \"Show Application Windows\" or similar for an idea of what exactly activated it.\n", "Q: How to use iCloud for photo backup On my IPad i have 1300 photos and small movies so I desperately need more free space on it.

An iPad backup to iCloud doesn't include photos or videos. That tells me it is not safe for you to delete anything at the moment.\nI think your best bet is to install one of the other cloud services that support syncing photos. Both Dropbox and SugarSync can do backups although Dropbox renames all your photos so SugarSync might be a better choice. There are other services as well but these are the two I happen to use the most.\n", "Q: Enable standby mode / deep sleep on SSD macs with mounted SD-card This question arose from the comments page of The Nifty Minidrive's Kickstarter page\nThe Nifty Minidrive is essentially a microSD card adapter that fits perfectly into the SD-slot of the MacBook Pro / Pro Retina / Air so that a microSD card can be used as additional storage.\nHowever a backer came across this apple support document which explains that for a Mac to be able to enter Standby mode one criterium is that it must \"Have no SD card inserted\".\nThis is a potential deal breaker for many backers.\nIs there a way to enable deep sleep mode even though an SD card is inserted?\n(I have no way of actually testing this, but does an inserted SD card which isn't mounted prevent deep sleep as well? If it doesn't it should be possible to make a script that unmounts the SD card before the Mac goes to sleep and mounts it when it awakens?)\n\nA: SleepWatcher works fine with Mountain Lion. I've written an extensive guide to address the exact problem to unmount and auto re-mount of SD Cards and any external HDDs using sleepwatcher.\n\nA: If someone could confirm that unmounted (but still inserted) SD cards do not prevent standby mode / deep sleep I have a couple of proposed solutions to unmounting SD cards on sleep and mounting on wake:\nControlPane App - http://www.controlplaneapp.com/ - Can run \"actions\" on wake and sleep. Running a simple applescript to mount / unmount would do the trick (ML-compatibility in latest beta)\nSleepWatcher - http://www.bernhard-baehr.de/ - Seems to be the more popular solution to do the same things as ControlPane App, no word on Mountain Lion compatibility though.\nScenario - http://www.lagentesoft.com/scenario/index.html - Paid alternative ($4.99)\n\nA: Mountain provides an automated solution for your problem.\nIn addition to the battery drain it occasionally happens that the MiniDrive is ejected when the Mac goes into deep sleep. This problem can also be solved with Mountain using the \"Remount USB storages\" command.\nThis blog article explains you how to use Mountain to solve common issues with the Nifty MiniDrive like battery drain in sleep mode or the need to reattach the MiniDrive after waking up from sleep.\n", "Q: Delay in keyboard responsiveness after wake with Mountain Lion? After upgrading to Mountain Lion, now when I open the lid to my 2010 13\" MacBook Air, there is a 3-5 second delay between when the screen powers on and when the keyboard will respond to key presses in the login dialog box.\nThis did not happen for me under Lion.\nIs this a known bug?\n\nA: While I believe Macbooks Air did this before Mountain Lion, you seem to be experiencing a resume from standby. All Mac laptops, by default, write the contents of memory to disk when they sleep, but leave the power to the RAM on for a quick resume. Writing the contents of memory to the disk occurs so that you won't lose data if the system loses power. \nHowever, on Macbooks Air and Retina Macbooks Pro, which have built-in Flash memory (which Apple distinguishes from 2.5\" SSDs on Macbooks Pro), in order to advertise a 30-day standby time, after an hour the system removes power from the RAM. So, if you leave it asleep for more than an hour, you'll actually be resuming from the disk. It's a lot faster than on a device without an SSD, but it's still a noticeable delay. Apple calls this \"standby\", and while it's resuming you basically see a still image of the login screen that you can't interact with.\nYou can disable standby with this unsupported command: sudo pmset -a standby 0. This will cause your battery to drain much more when you leave the system asleep, but it'll make it resume much more quickly.\nApple's documentation on standby mode is here.\n\nA: I find that sleep/wake problems can behave somewhat better after a reboot. Try it, let's know if it helped. \nAlso, have you updated http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1559?\n\nA: After I freshly installed ML on my Macbook Pro Retina, I encounter the same 3-5 delay in keyboard-trackpad when the lid is opened and screen is on. Note that this usually happens after long sleeping hours. There is another thread that discusses the exact same problem here http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1415204.\n\nA: I reset the System Management Controller on my Macbook Air and the problem has gone away.\nUPDATE: It came back the next day.\n", "Q: What is the API call that iPhone makes to check if a number has iMessage enabled I tried to sniff the http calls by setting up a proxy on my laptop in the same LAN as the iPhone. Once that was set up, I entered different numbers that I know have iMessage enabled into the number field of the Messages app, but couldn't see any calls being made. \nOf course, the proxy was functional as I could see other calls go through such as Safari, App Store etc. Also, these numbers were not in my address book originally.\nAccording to How does iMessage know that the recipient is an iOS 5 device? - iPhone makes a call to Apple servers to determine whether the recipient is an iOS 5 device or not.\nWhat is this API call being made to see if a phone number has iMessage enabled?\n\nA: When checking whether a recipient is on iMessage or SMS, iOS does not use http protocol. \nYou can use Wireshark on PC or tcpdump on Mac to sniff the entire tcp protocol.\n", "Q: Fading of the URL in Safari 6's Unified Search and URL Field  With Safari 6, the omnibar fades the non-server part of the URL, so that the actual server name is more visible. Presumably, this is to reduce phishing attacks.\nHowever, I find that the remainder of the url is hard to read, and to be honest, when developing websites, that is the part I care much more about.\nIs there any way to have it so that the whole url is the same?\n\nA: As mentioned above by dan8394, you can click the omnibar, reactivating the full URI. Unfortunately, there is not an option for changing this in Safari, nor does a hook exist in AppleScript. To the best of my knowledge, the only way this can be changed would be through a Safari extension.

Now I cannot open or upgrade VMWare Fusion, the icon is blocked, and if clicked, a pop up comes out and if click help, another popup telling me that nothing is available. \nHow to upgrade and use VMWare fusion again?\n\n\nA: The latest version of VMWare Fusion is version 4. If you want to use VMWare on Mountain Lion, unfortunately you can no longer use the old version. This VMWare blog post says:\n\nDoes VMware Fusion 3 work with Mountain Lion?\nNo. VMware Fusion 3 was released in October 2009 and was optimized for Mac OS X Leopard and Snow Leopard.  VMware Fusion 3 is no longer being updated for newer versions of Mac OS. Customers wishing to run VMware Fusion on Mountain Lion should use VMware Fusion 4. A free 30-day trial is available for current VMware Fusion 3 users. The trial can be found here: http://www.vmware.com/go/tryfusion\n\n", "Q: Does Notification Center have keyboard shortcuts? Are there any keyboard shortcuts for controlling Notification Center on OS X Mountain Lion? Of particular interest is a shortcut equivalent of the Click to Tweet button that appears at the top of Notification Center (when the requisite option is selected in the Notifications settings pane), but if it happens to have other shortcuts (either predefined, or definable in System Preferences - I couldn't see any) those would be useful as well.\n\nA: There is a configurable keyboard shortcut to open Notification Center:\n\nOther than that, there seems to be no way to configure any keyboard shortcuts. The closest I could get is discovering that you can set Notification Center as the action for a hot corner. If you wanted to do this when a key is pressed, you can try combining this with AppleScript (like in this post).\n\nA: The proper answer to this question is \"No.\" But that's not a very satisfying answer. So if you're determined to have keyboard shortcuts for Click to Tweet in Notification Center, this is what you can do:\nWarning: this is a complete and utter hack, but it seems you can (for now; this might break easily) trigger the Tweet button through a very delicate use of UI scripting.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an Automator service.\n\n*Give it a single action: Run AppleScript\n\n*Here's the script:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Notification Center\"\n        click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1\n        click button 1 of UI element 1 of row 2 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of window \"window\"\n        keystroke \"Whatever text you want as your default tweet\"\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\n*Save the service (obviously modify it from my example), assign it a keystroke in System Preferences, and voila: you've got a keyboard shortcut… until Notification Center gets rearranged and button 1 of UI element 1 of row 2 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of window \"window\" is no longer the Tweet button.\nIf this looks convoluted, that's because it is. If this isn't something you want to use, I don't blame you, and you can fall back on the answer of \"no, there aren't keyboard shortcuts.\"\n\nA: While it doesn't work for \"click to Tweet\", there are indeed three keyboard shortcuts that work with Notification Center. They are ↑, ↓, and return. Combined with the ability to assign a keyboard shortcut to open Message Center, normal messages can be responded to using the keyboard alone. The Share button and the Mute switch do not seem to respond to these inputs, however.\n\nA: Here's what I do:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a shortcut set to open Notification Centre. This is mapped to F13, as described in other answers.\n\n*I also have the tab key enabled to move keyboard focus between 'all controls':\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Press F13 to open NC.\n\n*Press the tab key twice until 'click to tweet' is highlighted in blue:\n\n\n*Press the spacebar.\n\n*Type my tweet (I haven't found a way to add location without clicking).\n\n*CMD+Shift+D to send.\n\n\n\nA: While not related to Notification Center, you can achieve this easily using the official Twitter client for OS X. This has a configuration option for \"Global New Tweet\" which lets you compose a tweet with a key combination without the Twitter app being in the foreground.\n\n\nA: Here's an alternate:\ndisplay dialog \"Tweet?\" default answer \"\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1\nset mytweet to text returned of result\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Notification Center\"\n        click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1\n        click button 1 of UI element 1 of row 2 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of window \"window\"\n        keystroke mytweet\n        repeat 3 times\n            keystroke tab using {control down}\n        end repeat\n        keystroke space\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\nA: If you are using a trackpad, there is also a new gesture to show/hide the notification center: swipe with two fingers from the right border of the trackpad towards its center.\nThis setting can be enabled/disabled in Settings -> Trackpad.\n\nA: Found a great one! \nAlt + ↑, when notification center is open, reveals an additional switch above the Tweet area, to temporarily disable Notification Center:\n\nOnce you click the switch:\n\nEdit:\nAnyone else see this documented anywhere?!? Am I the first one to find this?!?\n@siracusa Documented it in his epic Mountain Lion review: http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/07/os-x-10-8/4/#notification-center\n", "Q: Did Mountain Lion fix Launchpad's re-arranging curse? Anyone that has used Launchpad aggressively knows that (at least on Lion) it would re-arrange the icons upon reboot.  There was no way to save or lock the order and location of the icons.  Is this fixed now in Mountain Lion?  Or did they just add a search bar and call it good?\n\nA: Yes, it is fixed.  I have been rearranging program icons for hours every day, over two days, rebooting repeatedly, on a Fall 2010 MacBook Air, and the order and orientation has stuck (stayed) every time.\nAs far as I can tell, this is finally fixed.\n", "Q: Can't boot Windows 7 USB Install on iMac 8,5 I would like to install Windows 7 with Boot Camp on my 20 Inch iMac 8,5 from late 2008. My Superdrive seems to have failed, inserting a DVD or CD just results in it spinning a bunch clunking about and spitting it out. So I need to use the USB method to install. \nI have tried the following methods of creating a bootable USB to various USB devices in s 4GB & 8GB and had zero success in booting them:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Camp USB Creator directly from Boot Camp (I edited the .plist to allow this)\n\n*Unebootin (Linux distros won't boot either)\n\n*Windows USB Maker from a Parallels install of Windows 7 (the same ISO)\n\n*Terminal \"sudo dd...\"\n\n*Disk Utility converting the ISO to an IMG and successfully restoring it to the usb partition\n\n*WinToBoot and various other Windows applications to wipe and write the iso via Parallels Windows installation\n\n*rEFIT both directly on my mac and as a bootable usb, the bootable usb is recognized and sees the Windows usb but when launched it simply says no bootable device\n\n\nI have also tried to do a simple linux install usb with Unebootin with no success in booting. I have created a bootable Mac OS install usb using Disk Utility which is recognized when holding Option. \nI am starting to wonder if it is my computer or EFI firmware? All the USB ports work fine with other peripherals and recognize the usb devices when Mac OS or parallels is open.\nAs of yesterday I am running Mountain Lion (I'd hoped perhaps updating would make something work) made no changes. \n\nA: I think the problem is the way the computer is locked, if your computer has a Super Drive, your Mac is automatically configured/locked to boot from that drive and ignore the USB.\nTheir is no amount of reconfiguration or software tricks that would change that, what you can do is take out the Super Drive, or try cleaning it with a CD cleaner - the one with the brush.\n", "Q: Why some folders have the .DS_Store but some doesn't?

I'm trying to make an alarm clock for myself with AppleScript after my old (physical) one crapped out. I've got a script that'll schedule a pmset wakeup at the requisite time. There's just the matter of making the script actually make noise at that moment.\nTo that regard, does the actionscript delay command count time the computer was asleep? It'd be nice to say \ndelay (# of seconds between now and when I have to wake up the next morning)\n\n, but if delay doesn't count down when the computer's off (or, rather, retroactively decrement the countdown upon wake), then I'll need some other way of doing things.\nDoes anyone know about this behavior, and any workarounds if the answer is 'it doesn't count time asleep'?\n\nA: I doubt that applescript keeps delay during sleep.  I guess what you can do is when you want to start the delay, get the current time, then set a repeated delay, something like as following.  I'll write this in psuedo-code since I'm not too familiar with applescript anymore\nstartDelayDate = current date\nshouldRepeat = yes\nrepeat while shouldRepeat is equal to yes\n    delay(1)\n    if (((current date) - startDelayDate)>=yourDelayTime) //You'll have to implement your own date checking method\n        //Do your stuff\nend repeat\n\n", "Q: if iPhoto came with my Mac, can I still get free updates after Mountain Lion? Since:\n\n\n*\n\n*I got iPhoto included with my MacBook Pro, not from the Mac App Store\n\n*Mountain Lion is replacing Software Update with the Mac App Store\n\n\nWill I still be able to get free iPhoto updates with Mountain Lion?  How would that work?\n\nA: Yes! When you open the App Store's Updates tab, you'll see a special dialog allowing you to accept the apps such as iPhoto that were bundled with your computer. If you accept them and enter your account info, the licenses will be automatically associated with your account. In the future you'll be able to receive updates exactly as if you had purchased the apps.\n(The details probably depend on which computer you have and when you purchased it. But if your computer is a relatively recent model then you probably will have access to these apps. If you want more details you may need to contact Apple.)\n\nA: Last night I installed Mountain Lion on my 2011 iMac which came with Snow Leopard and iLife on DVD. After the install, I opened iPhoto and chose Software Update as normal.\nThe App Store opened and in the updates tab, it had a new section called System Updates and downloaded the updates for iPhoto and iMovie. I do not have these apps associated with my account in the App Store and thus there was a note at the bottom of the System Updates section stating that these updates are all subject to the original licence agreement.\n\nA: Didn't you get the iLife DVD with the MBP? or did u get the iPhoto preinstalled. If you got it preinstalled then inform Apple support before you upgrade. \n", "Q: My Launchpad organization was reset with Mountain Lion. How can I recover it? I had neatly sorted the applications in Launchpad when I was running Lion. But after upgrading to Mountain Lion, none of my custom folders are there any more, and it seems Launchpad is back to the default layout (the first page being all Apple apps).\nIs there a way to restore the layout I had in Lion? Is this something I could take from an old Time Machine backup? How would I apply it without breaking Launchpad (such as making some apps permanently disappear, or other such undesirable results)?\n\nA: According to this article, you can force a Launchpad reload by removing a .db file in ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Dock. This file is the SQLite database for Launchpad. Theoretically, you should be able to recover the file, which has a name something like: 5187B29E-A5A8-4CD6-A688-28D426B923F6.db and move it to the correct place. Note that you should backup the current .db file before doing this.\n", "Q: Phantom Update Stuck In Mac App Store About a year ago I downloaded the \"<3 Sudoku Daily\" (click for MAS link) app from the Mac App Store. After a while I decided I didn't want it anymore, so I deleted it by putting the application file, in the Applications folder, into the trash and emptying the trash.\nHowever, for almost the past year, the MAS has persistently shown an available update for the application, exactly as if it were still installed on my computer.\nThings I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing the update (which reinstalls the app) and then deleting it\nagain. \n\n*Deleting the app using App Zapper and Hazel to erase any\nassociated files.\n\n*Signing out of my account and signing back in.\n\n*Contacting the developer.\n\n*Rebuilding LaunchServices per this other  question.\n\n*Reindexing Spotlight.\n\n*Disconnected any external storage devices that could even possibly have a copy of this app installed somewhere.\n\n\nThis phantom update has even survived the upgrade to Mountain Lion. It didn't bother me so much at first, but now, after almost a year, I'd really, really like to get rid of this application once and for all.\nDoes anyone know why the MAS would think that this app is still on my Mac, or what I can do to fix it?\n\nA: I think this is more likely a problem with Spotlight. Try running the terminal command\nmdfind \"kMDItemAppStoreHasReceipt == 1\"\n\nto see if it is still somewhere on your machine. If the file doesn't actually exist, try forcing Spotlight to reindex.\n", "Q: rMBP Doesn't Wake Up From Sleep After Upgrading to ML It is the second time that my rMBP doesn't wake up from sleep. The only application that I've recently installed are Alferd and BetterTouchTool - Could it have something to do with that?\nIn addition it happened twice only after long time sleep of like 8 hours - if I sleep the machine now and wake it after 2 minutes it wakes up perfectly.\nDo you have any ideas what can cause this? In Lion I had no problems.\nEDIT: Apple released the following update\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/DL1559\nhopefully this will fix the problem.\nEDIT: Nope, didn't help.\nEDIT: I freshly installed ML again, which fixed my problem. I have added an answer below, please read it.\n\nA: Not a solution, unfortunately, but a report of the same problem with a MacBook air (mid 2012). It was running Lion without a glitch, but ever since I upgraded with ML, I can't wake it up from sleep (closed lid) when I try to use it back in the morning. To get control back over the machine, I need to do a SMC Reset (Left Shift - Option - Control + Power button at the same time) for a hard reset. I tried to install the SMC update mentioned in the EDIT, but the MBair refused to accept it. Still at a loss… \nI have unchecked the Power Nap feature to see if it would make a difference, but to no avail. \n\nA: OK, finally a solution that worked.\nI formatted my partition and freshly installed ML, which fixed my wakening problems.\nHere is a tutorial on how I freshly installed ML: \nHow To Fresh Install ML\n", "Q: Routing all traffic except a few IP-ranges though default gateway in Mountain Lion I am using VPN (Cisco IPSec) through the default Mountain Lion network preferences. In Lion (and also in Snow Leopard), I did the following to change the routing back to using my default gateway for all traffic, and thne set up a few routes for the specific IP-ranges that needed to go through VPN:\n# Route traffic through VPN:\nroute -nv add -net IPRANGE -interface utun0\n#...more lines for the different IP-ranges that should go through VPN)\n\n# Route all other traffic through the old default gateway:\nroute change default DEFAULT-GATEWAY-IP\n\nThis seems to not work under Mountain Lion. The (new implementation?) of Cisco IPSec seems to dynamically add a lot of routes to the routing table as I visit them in the browser.\nI have debugged this a lot (pinging, traceroute'ing), but still haven't found a solution. \nThe basic problem I'm trying to solve is just to route traffic for specific IP-ranges through VPN, everything else should act as I am not connected to VPN. Any other solution that achieves that will be fine with me =)\n\nA: If you configure your VPN server to allow split tunneling, this will work without any need to configuree your vpn client or the network on the Mac. \n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/anyconnect-secure-mobility-client/119006-configure-anyconnect-00.html\n\nSplit-tunneling is used in scenarios where only specific traffic must be tunneled, opposed to scenarios where all of the client machine-generated traffic flows across the VPN when connected. Use of the AnyConnect Configuration Wizard will by default result in a tunnel-all configuration on the ASA. Split tunnelling must be configured separately, which is explained in further detail in the Split Tunnel section of this document.\n\n", "Q: How can I send a tweet without taking my hands off the keyboard? If I'm typing a tweet in Mountain Lion's new Notification Center panel, is there a way to send the tweet without moving my hands to the trackpad to click the \"send\" button? I've tried return, enter, ⌘return, and other key combinations, but nothing obvious sends the message.\n\n\nA: I didn't intend for this to become a self-answered question, but I think I found the answer:\n⌘⇧D\nThe send mail shortcut works to send a Tweet also. Yay for discoverability.\n", "Q: Unable to deselect items in migration-assistant I had created a test user upon installing Mountain Lion, now I want to import my regular user from backup, but only that particular user and no other users nor applications. However in the Migration-Assistent window all check boxes are greyed out for my most recent backup (both for my carbon copy clone and the TimeMachine backup) even though I could change the selection for a much older backup. What can be done to allow me to make a selection instead of needing to import everything ?\n\nA: This posting seems to suggest it might be something to do with Server.app software - https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4157337?tstart=0\nOn the new machine, you might try removing Server.app from the /Applications folder and restarting. It might be that you need to remove Server.app from the backup before doing the migration - perhaps you can boot from the clone and remove it from the clone. Removing Server.app from the /Applications folder should cause the system to warn you that it will shut down all the server services, but should otherwise leave the server data and settings intact so when Server.app is reinstalled everything will be as it was before.\nServer.app seems to also cause probelms with \"not enough room\" warnings that are incorrect but still prevent Migration Assistant.app from completing its job as detailed in Migrate OS X using Migration Assistant and Time Machine - not enough space\n", "Q: Can I download software update and apply them on another iMac I have the same iMac twice at two different locations. On one location I have a good internet connection but on the other one I have internet over satellite and it is limited to 3GB / month. I would like to know if there is a way to download software updates at one location and apply them at the other one? (I've already managed to download the mountain lion install package and copy it on an USB stick, but now I'd like to the same for the iPhoto update for example).\n\nA: Yes. However instead of getting the update through Software Update look for the update web page. e,g, 10.7.4 update for Lion and iPhoto 9.2.3. I found the latter by google search site:apple.com iPhoto update\n\nA: I'm not sure if this is already available in Lion, but in Mountain Lion you can access the  combo software updates in four steps.\nFirst click on the Apple icon in the menubar, and then on About this Mac:\n\n\n", "Q: Network Access - SonicWALL VPN options Does the built-in VPN client connect to SonicWALL?\n\nA: \"The client side is set up in the usual fashion\" - I've had different results due to Firewall Unique Identifier. At least on a Mac OS X 10.8 client.\nThe SonicWall configuration guide (Equinox document SonicOS_Standard-6-EN.pdf) clearly states a need for Firewall Unique Identifier. It's \"Item 1\" in things to write down and have users enter into the client software.\nFirewall Unique Identifier appears to be a non-standard extension (its not discussed in RFC 2409). Fortunately, Equinox sells VPN Tracker Personal for $130. I believe that's known as Vendor Lock In.\n\nA: Yes you can set up the sonnicwall to work with the built in L2TP vpn client.\nYou are a little short on config options but it works for most setups.\nYou have to leave the WANGroup profile on the sonnicwall as standard for its ipsec setup.\nYou need to make note of your shared secret for the WANGroup profile.\nThen turn on the L2TP vpn section on the sonnicwall.\nSet up a local ip address range for the l2tp users and make them of a group that has access. (trusteed users is a good default)\nNext in the PPP tab of l2tp setup please make sure MSCHAPV2 is at the top of the lists.\nThe client side is set up in the usual fashion.\nShould work fine.\nIn the client console if you see that Phase1 is not connecting check your shared secret.\nIf you need to change the WANGroup profile to work with other ipsec clients then you will not be able to make it work. \nIn that case you may be better working with the ipsecuritas software on the mac.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: While I cannot definitively say for every model of Sonicwall, it's unlikely. L2TP over IPSec is(and has been) available, I've never heard of Sonicwall being able to take advantage of that built-in configuration.\nYou may know all of the following, but I'm throwing it out there anyway:\nThere have been three ways to connect to Sonicwall as VPN gateways in the past: the free IPSecuritas, the (paid) 3rd Party VPNTracker, or the (free) Java-based NetExtender SSL-VPN client that Sonicwall provides for some models that never was particularly optimized for a mac experience, but had basic functionality.\n", "Q: Restore partition from merged partition I accidently merged my BOOTCAMP and Mac OSX Partition via diskutil.\nIs there any way to recover my data from the Bootcamp partition?\n\nA: You'd have to do some very serious data forensics on the partition and even then, you're not guaranteed to get all your data back, as some of it will likely have been overwritten already. If it's important, you're probably best off paying for a professional data recovery company to get the data back. If it's not important, just reinstall bootcamp from scratch.\nYou could try to do this yourself, though you'd risk making things worse, so don't do this unless you don't really care about losing all the data. Basically, you would need to re-shrink your OSX partition to its original size, create the bootcamp partition in the exact same position and size (e.g. \"80GB\" is not good enough - this needs to be precise down to the sector) as before without initialising/formatting it (just adding the partition table entry - NOT via Disk Utility). Then, you can run an NTFS data rescue utility on this partition and see what it finds. You probably don't know the exact size and start of the old bootcamp partition, so you either need to see if it's recorded in any log or backed up files, otherwise you'll have to scan the drive for the NTFS header, if it's still there. Again, there are tools that can automate this.\nI can't overstate how easy this is to mess up though, so unless you're prepared to lose the whole lot forever, let a professional handle it.\n", "Q: Cannot move window I install a linux (Fedora) distribution through VMWare (4.0) on Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion. The the virtual machine open up at the top of the window and hide its taskbar underneath the apple task bar as shown in below image:\n\nNow I cannot move the virtual machine window. Solution?\n\nA: I use two workarounds in cases like this.\n\n\n*\n\n*In the VMWare Fusion View menu, select \"Full Screen\". The guest OS fills the entire Mac screen, except for a Fusion menu bar with menus View, Virtual Machine, and Window. Then from the View menu, select \"Single Window\". When the guest OS window comes back, it's shaped better to fit the host OS display.\n\n*Log in to the guest OS, then use the guest OS's control panel for display settings to reduce the size of the guest OS's display -- say to 1024x768. Then from the Fusion View menu, select \"Single Window\", if not already selected. The result is a guest OS window which takes up less of the host OS display. Adjust from there. \n", "Q: How to Secure erase files in OS X without moving the files into trash? My Question is I want to erase a file in OS X Securely (like the function of \"Secure Empty Trash\") so that, the file cannot be recovered by using recovery tools. I don't want to empty the trash. It is possible to erase Files Securely in OS X without moving the file to Trash ? \n\nA: If you want to make sure that your files, deleted or otherwise, cannot be recovered, just turn on FileVault to encrypt your disk.\nMultiple erases or writes on SSDs do not make the file \"more\" erased.\n(I realise this is an old question.)\n\nA: You can always use the terminal command rm with the -P option:\n\n[Option -P will] \n  Overwrite regular files before deleting them.  Files are overwritten three times, first with the byte pattern 0xff, then 0x00, and then 0xff again, before they are deleted.\n\nIf you're not handy with the Terminal, just:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Terminal.app (Found in /Applications/Utilities).\n\n*Type cd  and drag the folder which contains the file you want to delete, to the terminal window.\n\n*Type rm -P FileName.extension and hit Enter\n\nA: srm is another shell utility for deleting files securely. It uses the 35-pass Gutmann algorithm by default, but -s (overwriting files with random data once) is faster and should be secure enough for most purposes.\n\nA: The securely delete command overwritten the areas on the storage medium. In OS X El Capitan 10.11 it was still accessible via the terminal. It was called srm - and has disappeared since macOS Sierra 10.12\nThe -P option ensures that when deleting the memory areas are overwritten three times before the memory space is released. For example, rm -P Desktop/File.txt deletes the file File.txt from the desktop. The additional option -R also removes folder contents and subfolders (as well as their contents)\nrm -RP ~/Desktop/[Directory/File]\n\nDeletes folders and their contents. To avoid typing errors, enter rm -RP including a space at the end.\n", "Q: How can I add missing avatar/profile pictures in Messages? In the new Messages application introduced with Mountain Lion, I cannot see my own avatar.\nThis is happening even though my Messages.app email is linked with my contact in Contacts.app.\nNo Avatar appears when I text in Messages:\n\n\nBut I do have an avatar in Contacts:\n\n\nA: This looks like a bug but as a workaround you can set the avatar by using the Buddies window:\n\n\n*\n\n*open Window > Buddies\n\n*click the avatar box at the top right to select an image or just drag & drop an image on this avatar box\n\n\nApparently, the Buddies window shows up only if you have a \"classic\" IM account setup too, like GTalk or AIM.\n\nA: You can set your own avatar, one that is even different from the one in your address book with the following menu selection:\nMessages → Change my Picture...\n\nA: I guess the contact picture on your contacts is from Facebook? If so, Messages does not seem to see it. The picture has the be \"set\" in the Contacts.app, not imported through Facebook (or Twitter, I guess).\n", "Q: How can one debug imagent issues?

Upon entering my Apple ID into the respective applications and attempting to sign in, I receive the following error message:\n\nThe server encountered an error processing registration.  Please try again later.\n\nWhilst I assume that imagent proceeded beyond the authentication stage (as providing incorrect credentials results in a different error message), I am unable to ascertain exactly what went wrong.  I cannot find any log file (nor any option to enable logging) that shines light on the subject.  Is it possible to audit imagent activity?\nI have found various suggestions, some of which appear to have worked for others:\n\n\n*\n\n*Force quit the imagent process;\n\n*Reset /etc/hosts to default state;\n\n*Enable ntp;\n\n*Fix permissions and/or delete ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.imagent.plist;\n\n*Delete certain Apple-issued certificates from the user's login keychain;\n\n*Use Google's public DNS resolvers;\n\n*Disable all firewalls and packet filters;\n\n*Delete the contents of /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration;\n\n*Reset NVRAM/PRAM;\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nI have tried all of the above, with no improvement.\nI have tried using two different Apple IDs: one a simple MobileMe account (ending @me.com) that has been transferred to iCloud; the other an old .Mac address (ending @mac.com) with which additional non-Apple email addresses have been associated and verified.

There is no .bashrc file in the home dictionary but the environment variable PATH indeed exists as the result of this command shows:\n$ echo $PATH\n/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin\n\nAnyone know how/where OS X stores environment variables?\n\nA: The system-wide default path is in /etc/paths. The default on a 10.8 system contains the following:\n\n/usr/bin\n/bin\n/usr/sbin\n/sbin\n/usr/local/bin\n\nTo add additional system-wide PATH entries, you could change that file, but a better option would be to add a file with the additional path entries to directory /etc/paths.d. That user-created file will be protected during any upgrades/patches, which may replace a customised /etc/paths with an Apple-distributed version.\nAlternatively, you could put the appropriate PATH modifying statements in /etc/profile or /etc/bashrc (in the case of bash, it will only use the latter if the former doesn't exist). Any other system-wide environment changes can be done using those files as well.\nUser-specific configuration can be put in $HOME/.bashrc or $HOME/.bash_profile.\nNote: In the above, I've assumed you're using bash - if you're using csh or zsh, you'll need to adjust their configuration files (the information about /etc/paths and /etc/paths.d remains valid, however).\n\nA: You could make your own .profile or .bashrc file to set environment variables for your user.\n\nA: Where setting environmental variables for a shell which file you use is dependent on what shell you are running.\nTo determine what shell your running in the Terminal try:\necho $SHELL\nOnce you have that you can read the manual page for your shell, which is likely going to be bash.\nman bash \nIf you are running bash, this segment from the bash manual will be helpful.\n\nWhen  bash  is  invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login\n         option, it first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists.

I have bootable clones of my old Lion install before I upgraded, but sometimes I only need to run a single application and rebooting from another disk is a pain, so I would like to be able to fire up an instance of Lion as a virtual machine.\nThe Lion license allows for VM installs (up to 2 I think), so there should be no issue from a licensing perspective, but I don't know how to go about actually doing it.\nI have access to Parallels 7 (although I have never used it, got it as part of a software bundle recently), and I would happily use VirtualBox if that's the easiest way.  I have seen a few tips for creating ones within VMWARE, but I don't have access to this software.\nSo, starting from a point of having access to the Lion download, having the installer image within that download extracted onto a USB stick, and also have a bootable copy of a working Lion image, what is the simplest way to get a clean minimal Lion install working within either Parallels or VirtualBox on Mountain Lion?\n\nA: OK, having had a good play the following options are possible with Parallels:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the Recovery Partition on your machine, however this only works from the current one, not any other attached ones, so if you are booted into ML, you can only use the ML recovery partition - so no go for Lion\n\n*From original Media, in this case an official USB stick as it was not available on DVD, I didn't have one, so no good for me (note that hand made ones will not work, neither will if you created a bootable partition\n\n*From a Disk Image file.  As with option 2. above, creating a bootable DVD/USB Stick/partition on an drive etc will not work if you have extracted the image file to create one.  You need the actual DMG file.  If you have the original App Store download, the easiest way to get this is is to rick click and Show Package Contents, then find the InstallESD.dmg file and make a copy of it.\n\n\nUsing the file from method 3. will allow you to use the new VM Wizard to create the Lion VM\n\nA: For Parallels see their knowledge base article for \"How to create Lion Virtual Machine using Parallels Desktop 7 for Mac\".

After upgrading to Mountian Lion on both my MacBook Air and my wife's MacBook Pro, I recieved a prompt asking to install Java (I did not get this on my iMac). \nI was wondering what triggered this event for it to ask for Java. Was it because a Java runtime was there previously? I don't remember installing one (and not sure why my Air would ask, but not my iMac, many more things are installed on my iMac). \nHow can I find out what triggered this? Also, how can I remove a runtime if an older, and now incompatible one was there?\nIs there also a place where an older JVM may have been, and where it saw it there and decided to prompt me? If so, that would help me track down the notice, but also remove it from my machine. \n\nA: I did some more research and finally found some things out:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have the Logitech remote software installed, and when launching it, it brings up the prompt, but a slightly different one. So, I know I have a few Java apps installed, but this was happening without me launching something\n\n*My actual error was related to a Facebook chat thing I had installed a while back, that I never put on my iMac. It was named 'com.facebook.videochat.[username].plist', and was in my ~/Library/LaunchAgents directory. \n\n*I actually came across this question (asked after mine) when searching for the only Java information I found Console.app:\n\n\n8/31/12 6:44:23.606 PM Download Java Components[7588]:\n  com.apple.message.domain:\n  com.apple.java.usage2.DownloadOnDemand.complete\n  com.apple.message.result: failure com.apple.message.signature:\n  install_canceled com.apple.message.domain.version: 12A269\n\n\n*I would recommend checking your ~/Library/LaunchAgents directory first, and you can easily grep for java by doing: cd ~/Library/LaunchAgents and then grep -i \"java\" *.*. This searches for the word java (case insensitive) in all files in that directory. Thats where I found the reference to the Facebook videochat plist.\n\n\nA: I resisted installing Java based on the prompt at startup, so I could see whether I would get a similar prompt when opening a specific application. For me the actual event went by quickly while I was caught up in work, but it seems to have been triggered by Adobe CS5 InDesign (or some associated application used by CS5).\n", "Q: Mimic TouchCursor movements on Mac I'm using OS X Lion.\nI'm a PC user and just recently tried out using a Mac.  I'm used to installing a handy app in Windows named TouchCursor.  It allows me not to release my fingers in the \"home\" keys of the keyboard, which helps increase productivity (IMHO) because I don't need to reach out for the arrow keys anymore.\nIn Vim, the standard for the left, right, up and down is the H, L, K, and J keys.  I mimic it in Windows through TouchCursor by just adding the Spacebar (holding it down) + either H, L, K and J, depending on the direction I choose.  I made it universal, not only using Vim, but used it every time I navigate Windows, work with MS Office and other apps.\nIs KeyRemap4MacBook able to this just like I used to do it in TouchCursor?  Currently I have downloaded it and would be experimenting and see how it goes.  I just needed to post this question assuming someone might have experience solving this.\nCheers!\n\nA: I use both programs, and they are quite similar in spirit, but different in detail.  What I find works well for me in KeyRemap4MacBook is to turn on \"normal mode\" (I think that's what it is called).  I tap my Command key, then I can use vi-like keys, then I tap Command again (or use i).\nAnother useful thing is \"simultaneous vi mode\" (I think that's what it is called).  I press and hold s and d simultaneously, and while holding them I can use vi keys.  Quite similar to TouchCursor, except not with the space bar.\nI wish there were programs that are more similar than these two, but I think this is currently where we are at.\n", "Q: Activating screen saver from AppleScript in Mountain Lion I had a script that I used to use to activate my screen saver, and it no longer works in Mountain Lion.\nIt was a shell script that called an AppleScript script:\n#!/bin/bash\nosascript /Users/lorin/scripts/lockscreen.scpt\n\nThis is what the lockscreen.scpt file looks like:\ntell application \"ScreenSaverEngine\" \n        activate \nend tell\n\nIf I bring up lockscreen.scpt in the AppleScript Editor, I get the \"Choose Application\" dialog popping up asking \"Where is ScreenSaverEngine?\"\nAnybody know the Mountain Lion-y way to activate the screen saver?\n\nA: This works in ML:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set ss to screen saver \"Random\"\n    start ss\nend tell\n\n\"Random\" can be replaced with your choice, \"Flurry\" or \"Shell\" and so on.\nSource Disclosure: http://hintsforums.macworld.com/showthread.php?t=111478\n\nA: tell application \"ScreenSaverEngine\" to run\n\nA: That is a nice way of starting a random screen saver.\nIf, however, you'd simply like to start the active screen saver, you can use this in Mountain Lion:\ntell application \"System Events\" \n    start current screen saver\nend tell\n\n", "Q: How do you remove Safari 6 on Mac OS X 10.7.4 I understand there was a uninstaller for Safari 6 beta (is that available anywhere?) but it seems no longer available in the Apple Dev Center, and I am on Safari 6 release version.\nI need to remove this and revet back to 5.1.7.\n\nA: To downgrade Safari 6 on OS X Lion (10.7.4) to Safari 5.1.7:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Time Machine to have a fresh backup!\n\n*Get Pacifist.\n\n*Get Safari 5.1.7 for Lion here (apple.com) \nor here (mirror).\n\n$ md5 Downloads/Safari5.1.7LionManual.dmg\nMD5 (Safari5.1.7LionManual.dmg) = 504bdd1629f660084725d9883629f58e (same for both download links)\n\n\n\n*Quit Safari if running.\n\n*Install Safari 5.1.7 using Pacifist. Select \"Open Package\", choose the 5.1.7 dmg from step 2. Click on the \"Contents of Safari5.1.7LionManual.pkg\", Click \"Install\" on the toolbar, Choose \"Yes\" or \"Replace\" when asked (select the box for all continuous questions).\n\n*Open a new Finder window and press Command ⌘+Shift ⇧+G (Or menu \"Go\" -> \"Go to Folder...\").\n\n*Paste /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ in the goto field.\n\n*Rename the \"SafariServices.framework\" folder to \"SafariServices.framework.disabled\" (You will be asked for your admin password).\n\n*Use Finder go to again for /System/Library/StagedFrameworks/Safari/ folder. \n\n*Rename the \"Safari.framework\" folder to \"Safari.framework.disabled\".\n\n*Rename the \"WebInspector.framework\" folder to \"WebInspector.framework.disabled\".\n\nThe last one (WebInspector.framework) and possibly the first one (SafariServices.framework) don't really need to be disabled; Safari 5.1.7 will start anyway (at least for me), but since they weren't there before 6.0, I disabled them, too.\n\n\n*Launch Safari.\n\n*If you're happy with your newly downgraded Safari, you might safely delete those .disabled folders/frameworks. They will be reinstalled if you ever choose to install Safari 6 again. Look for the disabled frameworks (e.g. \"SafariServices.framework.disabled\") and move them to the Trash. You will be asked for your admin user's password again.\nIf it doesn't work for some reason, you can re-install Safari 6 from Software Update.\n\n*Run Disk Utility and Repair Disk Permissions.\n\nA: Unfortunately, I am now on Mountain Lion, so I can't confirm this works myself, but some searching found some options for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a backup from before you installed Safari 6, use that to revert.\n\n*The Safari installer places a backup of the old Safari in /Library/Application Support/Apple named .SafariArchive.tar.gz.  Note that since the name starts with a dot, it's not visible in Finder.  Doing an ls -a, or setting Finder to display hidden files via defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE followed by restarting Finder will let you see the file.\nOnce you've unpacked it take a backup, as you'll have to copy the older Safari's various support files into place.  The unpacked file will have many folders that overlap with files on your Mac's root folder.  To delete the Safari.app (TAKE A BACKUP, FOR REALS), you'll have to go into a Terminal, navigate to /Applications and run sudo rm -rf Safari.app/.  Copy the unpacked files into place, and you're golden.\n\nA: The uninstaller(s) for the Safari betas are indeed available presently in the developer downloads section. You can get the version there for whatever version you had installed. If you do not have an OS X Developer account yet you can register under http://developer.apple.com/ for free.\nIf you used the currently shipping version, there is no uninstaller. Using the uninstaller for a different version would probably yield undesired results.\n\n\nA: Don't try the following if you do not understand what this is about!\nFor me the command-sequence was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal as an admin\n\n*Become Root ($ sudo bash)\n\n*Check if the backup exists by entering the command ls '/Library/Application Support/.AppleSafariArchive.tar.gz' (including the quotes)\n\n*Do Not continue, if the archive doesn't show up.\n\n*Execute the following command:  cd /;tar czf Safari6.tar.gz 'Library/Widgets/Web Clip.wdgt' System/Library/StagedFrameworks/Safari System/Library/SyncServices/AutoRegistration/Clients/com.apple.safari System/Library/SyncServices/AutoRegistration/Schemas/com.apple.Safari.syncschema Applications/Safari.app;rm -fr 'Library/Widgets/Web Clip.wdgt' System/Library/StagedFrameworks/Safari System/Library/SyncServices/AutoRegistration/Clients/com.apple.safari System/Library/SyncServices/AutoRegistration/Schemas/com.apple.Safari.syncschema Applications/._Safari.app Applications/Safari.app;tar xzf '/Library/Application Support/.AppleSafariArchive.tar.gz'\nI moved the archive out of Library/Application\\ Support to save Safari 5 from Apple.\n\nA: if you want to revert to Safari 5.1.7 this link should allow you to download the version directly.\nI am not sure how to remove all traces or 'remaining parts' of Safari 6, but the link above is the manual installer DMG for Safari 5.1.7 for OS X Lion.\nHave not tried it, although the link is from Softpedia.\n\nA: Just to add I used the safari 6 developer preview 2 for lion uninstaller with the v6 final release and it appears to work \"well enough\" for users wanting a roll back - after the reboot courtesy of the uninstaller v5.1.7 is back in place, working correctly and Software Update is wanting to install v6 again.  \nThe challenge is in finding it (Apple Developer Download looks like it was a good source, but its not appearing under Crash Wrangler like the screenshot above anymore - probably removed...) - most copies on the internet (which aren't supposed to be there anyways) have been taken down, I found it a couple of places still doing a search on the file name and the first return had it (although it was non user friendly site - pop up windows etc.) and also via a search on \"Safari 6 uninstaller\" and results about 26 returns down the way, some steve guy's website.\n", "Q: Are there any wireless hard drives work well with Lion or newer Macs? Are there any wireless hard drives to use with a mac?\nI need to copy paste files from and to this hard drive, when the disk on my mac is full. Do I need to look for a specific Apple drive or will any network writable drive work for basic file storage?\n\nA: There are a couple of good options, depending on what you are looking for.\nThe most obvious option is to use an Apple AirPort WiFi router to provide NAS:\n\n\n*\n\n*The AirPort extreme supports attaching an external USB drive\n\n*TimeCapsule devices combine WiFi and an internal drive.  TimeCapsule is intended to be used for backup with TimeMachine, but you can use all or part of your drive as a mountable volume (just like any NAS solution).  TimeCapsules also have a USB port so you can add an external drive if desired.\n\n\nMany other vendors sell Mac compatible NAS drives, but the reason I'm partial to Apple's drives is that there were driver compatibility issues when OS/X Lion first came out.  Apple's drive were and are the most compatible (even if they are not the most cost-effective in $/GB).\nIf you are looking for a portable solution, you may be out of luck.  The portable Wi-Fi drives, which are becoming popular nowadays, are intended as media \"servers\" for smart phones and tablets; they are read-only over Wi-Fi and require a USB connection to \"load\" music, movies, etcetera.\n\nA: There are a few wireless hard drives that work well with the Mac. The best and most popular is the Apple Time Capsule which is available in a 2TB or a 3TB version.\n The Western Digital My Book Live 2 TB Personal Cloud Storage Drive is another good option but it would need to connected to your wireless router. \nOn this site, there are some good reviews on wireless hard drives to help you out with this issue. \n", "Q: iPhone connect to internet over WiFi using PPPoE Is there a way to connect my iPhone 4S to the Internet with WiFi when the connection is using the PPPoE protocol?\n\nA: Do you mean to connect to the wireless router itself and get internet access this way?\nAccording to Apple Support Forums,\n\nGenerally people will have a router establish the PPPoE connection and then share it with the devices on the local network.\n\nDo you have a computer or another device already connected to the local network? If so, you might be able to share the connection off one of these devices as a separate Wi-Fi connection.\n\nA: You could try using Connectify to redistribute the computer's connection over WiFi, not sure if it works on OS X though, check it out: google connectify.\n", "Q: How do I join a Microsoft Active Directory Domain in OS X?

I've got a mid-2011 Macbook Air running Mountain Lion.  Power Nap is enabled.  My Time Machine back up goes to a USB external hard drive.  My current workflow is to sleep my computer when not in use, and now that I'm running Mountain Lion I'll then attach the hard drive.  Overnight, the system will use Power Nap to make a backup and all the other stuff Power Nap does.\nMy concern is that I don't know when it's safe to unplug said hard drive.  The computer doesn't have any outward signs when it's in Power Nap vs. sleeping.  So I'm afraid of unplugging the hard drive mid-backup.  Having to wake up my laptop, eject the drive, and then re-sleep the laptop is something of a hassle, which I'd like to avoid if it's not necessary.\nHow can I determine when my laptop's in a Power Nap state instead of regular sleep?\n\nA: There is the simple answer and the clever answer.\nThe simple answer is listen for the external drive spinning. If it's sleeping, you will not be interrupting data transfer (but you will be yanking an open filesystem from a sleeping computer but that's not a new issue introduced by Power Nap).\nThe more clever answer is to observe other things that may be happening like network traffic by sniffing the traffic and seeing if the machine is sharing files or available to ssh into if you have sharing turned on. This takes more work and an iOS device or another computer and certainly won't be faster than just opening the lid of the Mac and knowing it's not napping anymore.\nIn the end - it's probably worth re-training your workflow to just open the lid and eject things properly. Since Power Nap is only supported on Mac that have Apple supplied integral SSD and ridiculously fast wake times, the delay to perform the eject cleanly is less than 10 seconds excluding however long your external drive takes to wake.\n\nA: Another indicator, mentioned in another question: attach a USB mouse with a LED. If the system is on, the USB port is powered and the LED lights up.\n", "Q: Can I use Dictation in OS X Mountain Lion offline? There is a new feature in Mountain Lion, Dictation.\nWhen I try to enable it in the System Preferences, I get the following dialog:\n\nIn other words, what Dictation does is just record your voice and send it to Apple, which does the conversion of your voice into text server side. This makes very little sense on today's powerful laptop or desktop Macs (I can see why it would make sense on a mobile device though). Is there a way to use the Dictation feature offline?\n\nA: No, your speech is still sent to the Siri/Nuance servers for processing, so you can't use dictation without an Internet connection.\nAn alternative would be to use a third-party dictation app like Dragon Dictate.\nWhile your machine is probably powerful enough to handle conversion (although maybe not as quickly as Apple's servers), it makes a lot of sense for Apple to keep things on their end. The software used for conversion is doubtlessly quite complex and would be a huge download. Living on their servers also means that they can push updates as frequently and quickly as they like.\n\nA: No.\nIf you read the Dictation FAQ it's not entirely clear that you always need an active broadband internet connection, but that is how this feature works.\nYou cannot use it when you are not connected to Apple's servers. There are other software packages that do offline voice transcription, but that's not what is baked into Mountain Lion.\nIf you read up on the technology behind voice recognition and the benefits of having excessive processing power to handle colds, dialects, slang, process out background noise and other items it makes much more sense to do this server side on massive equipment rather than sending the data needed to match words to each computer and having them all do the heavy lifting autonomously.\n\nA: Yes. Off-line dictation is possible since OS X 10.9, Mavericks.\nStarting with OS X 10.9, you can now use dictation offline, by checking the \"Enhanced Dictation\" box in the Dictation system preferences.\n\nA: No. It does not work offline. \nAnd when it is online it sends personal data to Apple which in - my view - have nothing todo with speech recognition.\n(By the way it makes a lot of sense NOT TO send data to Apple: You may want to use time when you are offline for dictation; rules of professional secrecy may bar you from sending data to Apple; and programs like Dragon had been perfectly capable to handle speech recognition before the arrival of the Mountain Lion.)\n", "Q: How can I clear the JavaScript console in the Safari 6 developer tools? In previous versions of Safari the JavaScript console in the Developer Tools (aka Web Inspector) had a little 'clear' button at the bottom that emptied out console items, which was useful for getting rid of clutter between debug sessions.\nAs of Safari 6, the new Dev Tools don't seem to have such a button. Manually using clear() and console.clear() doesn't work either. The 'Clear Console' item in the contextual menu doesn't seem to do anything for me.\nShort of console.log(\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"), is there a way to clear the console in Safari 6?\n\nA: Use Command-K (⌘+K) to clear Safari 6 Web Inspector console.\n\nA: As of May 2019:\n\nEven though, current Safari version is far beyond 6 (it is 12, actually).

Is the iPhone or an iPad of any help? Is there any remote-control app?\n\nA: Are you trying to remote control the Apple TV? Or are you trying to remote control the MacBook Pro? (both will work!)\nThere's the Remote app (by Apple, not affiliated) which can control the Apple TV, and there are probably lots of 'VLC Remote' apps if you are trying to control VLC itself.\n\n\n*\n\n*VLC Remote Free for iOS here\n\n*VLC Remote (paid) for iOS here\nThese work directly with the VLC client and allow for the full control experience - media selection, play, pause, rewind, forward etc.\n\nA: The remote app for iPhone will let you control any Mac or PC running iTunes. Remember, though, it controls iTunes, not the whole Mac. There is also a Keynote Remote app that will supposedly let you remote control that app, but I've not tried it, though. \n\nA: Check out Rowmote, Hippo Remote.

I was leery about installing Safari 6, but I figured I could cope with the changes. But, after using it for about 30 minutes I want Safari 5.1.7 back.\nMy \"plan of attack\" was to download the 5.1.7 installer, delete Safari 6, and install Safari 5.1.7. After the installer finished downloading I ran sudo rm -rf /Applications/Safari.app. As expected that deleted the application file. However, when I opened the 5.1.7 package installer I get the following error.\n\nI decided that the best way to get Safari 5.1.7 back was to reinstall Mac OS 10.7.4. But before I run the install I have a couple of questions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the \"Client Combo\" edition the wrong thing?\n\n*Will it attempt to install 10.7.4 incorrectly? \n\n*Is there a better way of deleting Safari 6 and installing 5.1.7?\n\n\nA: Reinstalling the OS just for Safari seems a bit drastic. The reason it says that is probably exactly because you used rm -rf as opposed to dragging it into the trash.\nIn OS X there is a central registry of installed applications, and afaik when you drag an application to the trash, it is automatically removed from this registry. When you just rm -rf it will delete the files but not the entry in the registry.\nSo I'd try : reinstall Safari 6 normally, then drag it to the trash. This should remove it from the registry, so try to install Safari 5 afterwards.\nIf it still doesn't work, try using the /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister tool to manually unregister Safari.\n\nA: First off, double check your backup situation and be ready to use it to restore your data onto a clean 10.7.4 install if needed.\nYour idea to delete the safari app and then re-install the Combo Updater is a great one and I have used it to great success in many cases where people managed to delete Safari in the past. The client combo is the correct update for you. (Client is correct as opposed to the server version of the combo updater)\nIt is not guaranteed to work (and I haven't tested it with Safari 6 having been installed and 10.7.4 yet so you could encounter a dragon but if your alternative is to do a clean install and skip the upgrade to Safari 6.0 you don't have much to lose by trying the combo updater trick.)\nWatch the install logs to be sure that the Safari installation isn't skipped due to detecting a newer version. If that happens, you'll have to much around in the /Library/Receipts folder and potentially the receipts database to remove the recipt that tells the system what version of Safari was installed in the past.\n\nA: If all you want is the old Safari.app I would suggest using a tool like Pacifist to open the .pkg and install just that component rather than jumping through hoops.\nHowever you should also be aware that the Safari 6 update may have installed a newer version of WebKit and other support frameworks that simply won't work with Safari 5, in which case you'll have to try to install the full 5.x pkg and overwrite the newer frameworks (not recommended though!). Pacifist ought to be able to do such an install while bypassing the usually Installer checks but... \n...If you'd prefer to run the checks and use the system's Installer.app I'm pretty sure you need to clear out the Safari 6-specific receipt that tells OS X that it was previously installed. I'd imagine that's what the Safari 5 installer is checking but I haven't tested at all to see if this is indeed the case. \nNot to call out houbysoft particularly but I doubt the reinstall issue is related to lsregister though, since (as evidenced by its path) I'm pretty sure that's only related to LaunchServices (ie. the service that decides what apps will show in the Open With menu for documents) rather than app installation.\nAnyways, rather than retyping, this answer about Java uninstallation (starting with the \"clean up the installer records\" section) provides a good list of the steps to take and places to look for the installer files, substituting Safari for Java of course :-)\nEdit: More awesome comprehensive installer info can be found on Nick Shubin's site\nOr, alternately, be zen about it and learn to live with Safari 6 instead of making work for yourself ;-)\n", "Q: $PATH error on a terminal Before you raise your pitchforks, this is NOT another \"How do I change my $PATH variable value?\" question. I had installed Oh my zsh on my machine(Macbook Pro), and didn't like it. So I uninstalled it.\nEver since I installed it I get the following when I run the $PATH command:\nAnups-xxxx-xxx% $PATH\nzsh: no such file or directory: /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin\n\nHow do I get rid of the bit that says zsh: no such file or directory. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Okay, so you've got a good understanding of $PATH and how it's used, but you're mistaken in thinking that it's a command. In Bash (and other shells), words prefaced by a dollarsign are variables. You can change the value of $PATH with the export command (as you probably already know).\nexport PATH=$PATH:/path/to/something/you/need/bin\nSo in your shell when you just type $PATH you're basically telling your shell to run the command /usr/bin/:/bin/:/usr/local/bin:/etc//etc//etc/ which isn't a valid shell command.\n@patrix was right, you should use echo to inspect your $PATH. I suspect that the \"zsh: no such file or directory\" is just your shell telling you that your command doesn't make sense.\n\nA: If you think there should be a path command, use this:\nalias path='printf \"${PATH//:/\\\\n}\\n\"'\n\nThis will display the contents of your $PATH, one element per line.\n[665] mbp13 $ path\n/opt/local/bin\n/opt/local/sbin\n/usr/local/bin\n/usr/bin\n...\n[666] mbp13 $ \n\n", "Q: Moving notes to iCloud I just upgraded to mountain lion and noticed that I can only see notes in iCloud in the \"Notes\" application.\nI have several notes related to a mail account that I would like to see on the Mac or move to iCloud.\nNow:\n\n\n*\n\n*notes are no more visible in Mail.app (as expected)\n\n*the notes in the mail account are visible on my iPhone and iPad but I cannot move them (there is no such functionality)\n\n*the Notes application shows the mail account on the left pane with a sub entry \"Notes\" but is empty\n\n*in the \"Mail, Contacts & Calendars\" preferences the checkbox \"Use With: Notes\" is checked\n\n\nAny way to move the notes to iCloud on iOS or better getting Notes to synchronize everything on the Mac?\n\nA: Notes in Mail will be removed in iOS 6, and iCloud only syncs notes between the notes apps.\nSo, Mountain Lion is just a few month ahead of iOS 6 so there is a bit of a missing link between the systems.\n\nYou can create for every \"mail.app-note\" one entry in the notes app\n  from iOS and they will be synced to all your devices.\n\nSo copy and paste every entry from the Mail-Notes to a new entry in the notes app on iOS, and they appear in Mountain Lion and on your other iOS-Devices.\n\nWorks between iOS 5, 6 and Mountain Lion.\n\n", "Q: Mountain Lion sleeps too aggressively For me, Mountain Lion always seems to sleep whenever there is no user action, even when the computer is still doing something. In my case it always sleeps in the middle of running a batch operation in Lightroom 4.1, and it has slept while Time Machine is still cleaning up.\nAccording to Siracusa's ML review, apps need to be written to make \"power assertions\" if they want to stop the computer from sleeping. Otherwise, sleep it will. This seems like a way too aggressive strategy, especially to implement by default in a new OS? There must be many, many apps that have not been written to make these power assertions (including it seems parts of Apple's own Time Machine backup process).\nIs there a hidden preference somewhere to revert to the old method of sleep at least until we get better app support for this? I'm not looking for a solution to supress sleep entirely (I know I can just tell the computer to never sleep), but rather to stop sleeping while it's still doing something.\nAdditional info:\n\n\n*\n\n*My Mac does not support Power Nap (mid 2009 13\" MBP)\n\n*My power settings in system preferences are set to the default, as follows:\n\n\npmset -g:\nActive Profiles:\nBattery Power       -1*\nAC Power        -1\nCurrently in use:\n hibernatemode        0\n acwake               0\n lidwake              1\n halfdim              1\n sleep                10\n ttyskeepawake        1\n sms                  1\n hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage\n disksleep            10\n displaysleep         2\n\npmset -g cap:\nCapabilities for Battery Power:\n displaysleep\n disksleep\n sleep\n acwake\n lidwake\n lessbright\n halfdim\n sms\n ttyskeepawake\n hibernatemode\n hibernatefile\n\nSystem log before and after a particular problematic sleep state (subsequent wake was not due to user input but rather a \"DarkWake\"):\n    2012-07-27 00:32:07.343 com.apple.launchd[1]: (com.apple.iCloudHelper[3859]) Exited: Killed: 9\n    2012-07-27 00:32:07.000 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3859 [com.apple.iCloud]\n    2012-07-27 00:32:12.416 com.apple.time[13]: Next maintenance wake [Backup Interval]: <date: 0x7fea7b6235f0> Fri Jul 27 00:45:48 2012 CEST (approx)\n    2012-07-27 00:32:12.416 com.apple.time[13]: Requesting maintenance wake [Backup Interval]: <date: 0x7fea7b6235f0> Fri Jul 27 00:45:48 2012 CEST (approx)\n    2012-07-27 00:32:13.000 kernel[0]: AirPort_Brcm43xx::powerChange: System Sleep \n    2012-07-27 00:32:14.000 kernel[0]: 00000000  00000020  NVEthernet::setLinkStatus - not Active\n    2012-07-27 02:20:14.000 kernel[0]: Wake reason: RTC (Alarm)\n    2012-07-27 02:20:14.000 kernel[0]: RTC: Maintenance 2012/7/27 00:20:13, sleep 2012/7/26 22:32:15\n    2012-07-27 02:20:14.000 kernel[0]: AirPort_Brcm43xx::powerChange: System Wake - Full Wake/ Dark Wake / Maintenance wake\n\n\nA: caffeinate -i open -W -a Lightroom.app\n\nshould keep the system awake as long as Lightroom is running and not idle.

I have a Mail.app rule that copies certain incoming messages into an archive mailbox. I'd like those messages to be marked as read in the archive mailbox but remain unread in my in-box until I actually read them. I tried adding \"Mark as Read\" to the copy rule but that marks the message as read in both the archive mailbox and my in-box, so I never have any unread messages in my in-box. Any ideas?\n\nA: It seems Mail 6.0 in Mountain Lion has fixed this for me. When I have new mail it shows as unread in both my in-box and my archive mailbox. And now, when I read it in my in-box it gets marked as read in both my in-box and my archive mailbox. Chalk one up for Mountain Lion.\n", "Q: How to recover deleted files from OS 10.5.8? I'm not very experienced with Macs, so please pardon my mistakes. I'm assisting a coworker with a client of ours who recently let go of one of their employees, and in the resulting meeting the person deleted all their documents & threw the laptop onto the floor, cracking the screen and likely damaging the hard drive.\nThe Mac appears to boot normally, and boots into a profile like normal, but we have no documents of any kind to access. My worker tried MacKeeper, but after running for over a day it crashed. Edit: MacKeeper disappeared because my coworker uninstalled it & deleted it, so I removed this part of the paragraph.\nIn any case, for Mac OS all I'm seeing for data recovery is paid software. I was hoping to be able to inspect the file system and/or attempt recovery in Parted Magic, or run TestDisk/PhotoRec on it, but I cannot boot to Hiren's on this computer (which doesn't surprise me). Is there a Mac equivalent to Hiren's I could look into?\n\nA: There should be a way of recovering the data if the profile/system can load successfully. I use Data Rescue 3 (tried but NOT affiliated with the company/developer) which recovers files directly from the hard drive and is actually quite good.\nI believe Data Rescue 3 (link here) has a free trial and also a paid version, although it is quite expensive.\nCan you access system files or any documents you have created at all?\n\nA: I would take out the HDD, which is quite easy with a Mac laptop and put it into a case to be plugged in to another mac. If you purchased MacKeeper you can re-download it anytime and also you can use it to get advise direct from their techs online 24/7 (see the info on the r/h side of the screen when MacKeeper is running. Also see if Time Machine (an auto backup) program has been running on the Mac. Time machine can take you back to any previous data and re-install it.

I am trying to migrate select data from my old Lion install. Does anybody know where the text replacement definitions in System Preferences > Language & Text > Text lie? I would like to migrate them to my Mountain Lion install.\n\nA: Thanks to Sacrilicious identifying the actual file/key where the data is stored, I figured out how to copy the whole thing with a few Terminal commands.\nMake sure you don't have System Preferences open while doing this, or it may not work!\n\n\n*\n\n*On your old install, run /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -x -c \"Print NSUserReplacementItems\" ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist > backup.plist\n\n*\n\n*This saves the substitutions to the backup.plist file in whatever directory you ran that command from (by default, your home directory).\n\n\n*Copy that backup.plist file to your new install (I recommend your home directory for simplicity).\n\n*On the new install, run /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Delete NSUserReplacementItems\" ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist, then run /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Add NSUserReplacementItems array\" ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist\n\n*\n\n*This wipes the default substitution list and creates a new blank one.\n\n\n*Again on the new install, run /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Merge /PATH-TO-BACKUP/backup.plist NSUserReplacementItems\" ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist, first replacing the /PATH-TO-BACKUP/backup.plist part with the actual path to wherever you saved the backup file.\n\n\nThat should do it. Open System Preferences to double check, but you should have an identical copy of your text substitutions on your new install.\n\nA: Programmatically speaking, each substitution is a dictionary written to the NSUserReplacementItems array at the root of the ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist file. \nI'm not able to think of a simple way to move data, even with Xcode's Property List Editor, from 1. an invisible file 2. in a hidden folder 3. to a specific part of the new systems file. To get you started, you can read them all with defaults read .GlobalPreferences NSUserReplacementItems or, if you want to just pull one(the first I'm seeing that I just customized in Lion is located at index #15, therefore): /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Print :NSUserReplacementItems:15\" ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist which would return something like this:\nDict {\nreplace = bIg \nwith = BigBabyBuggyBumpers\non = 1\n}\n\nAnd then writing the stuff back could be done in any scripting language that speaks apple's xml, or piecemeal with the trio of:\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Add :NSUserReplacementItems:16:on integer 1' ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist\n(which turns the checkbox on)\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Add :NSUserReplacementItems:16:replace string \"bIg\"' ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Add :NSUserReplacementItems:16:with string \"BigBabyBuggyBumpers\"' ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist\nI'll tweet it out, someone probably has the easier way and can chime in or build on this.\n\nA: I found an easier way to do it.\nUse these steps to export your existing text substitutions:\n- Open System Preferences > Keyboard > Text.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the shortcuts you want to export. If you want to export all of your text substitutions, select one of them, then choose Select All from the Edit menu.\n\n*Drag the selected shortcuts to the desktop.

(rMBP) I have attached two external monitors to my retina MacBook Pro:\n\n\n*\n\n*24\" Dell 1920x1200 with HDMI->DVI\n\n*19\" Samsung 1280x1024 with Thunderbolt->VGA\n\n\nWhile non-retina enabled apps look just fine (e.g. Blender) and seem to be pixel exact (monitors working correctly), all OS X rendered fonts seem to lack font smoothing or seem to have bad font smoothing. The funny thing is, that there seem to be two different kinds of font smoothing:\nA black on white font with just black and white (font smoothing on the internal):\n\n\nand some with color (font smoothing on the external monitor):\n\n\nThere is also some text smoothed with color on the internal, and folder names on the desktop are smoothed in black/white on both displays. The folder font on the external display still looks bad, though.\nShort question: how can I improve this behaviour, e.g., get the font on the external monitor to smooth in black/white like Blender does it?\nblender:\n\n\nsame font size finder:\n\n\nBlender also always seems to get the straight lines in a font aligned with pixel lines. The problem is still there when working with the lid closed. I already tried to read \ndefaults -currentHost read -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing\n\nto get the current setting but it tells me it the setting does not exist. \n\nA: It doesn't look quite as good as my 27 inch iMac, but something that helped me was to turn down the display's built-in sharpness setting to zero (Dell U2713H). This, combined with increasing the brightness, made my display look much better when plugged into my rMBP (running 10.9.1 at time of writing). It's a huge improvement!\n(additional note, I'm plugged into the display with mini displayport)\n\nA: None of the LCD font smoothing options are going to do you any good, and here's what I suspect is the reason.\nSubpixel rendering simply doesn't work with resolution-independence as implemented by Apple. If OS X renders everything on a much larger pixel grid and uses subpixel rendering, it would look fine if shown at native resolution. Instead, in 10.8, the graphics card scales the larger pixel grid down to what's displayable by the monitor. During the downscaling multiple adjacent pixels get averaged together and combined. For black text on a white background, this means that the red, red+green, blue+green, or blue subpixels on the edges of fonts (which give subpixel rendering its characteristic crispness) are averaged with adjacent white pixels during the downscaling. The subpixel effect basically disappears in the process and you're left with entire pixels colored funny around the text, and none of the LCD smoothing options look acceptable. Your best bet is to UNCHECK \"use LCD font smoothing\" in the System Preferences and let the graphics card antialiasing do the job instead. It's not as good as what we had before, but at least it isn't quite as fuzzy. The only way I could see this being addressed would be if the fonts were rendered on the native pixel grid after scaling instead.\nNotice that if you zoom in using the OS X zoom feature, with LCD font rendering enabled, you see colored blocks around the fonts.  But if you zoom all the way out and take a photograph of the screen using a camera, subpixel rendering is actually not taking place!  I'm a bit surprised that Apple would leave the option in there when it clearly doesn't function as intended with external monitors.\nHere is a picture I took of my external display connected to my rMBP with \"flat panel\" (sub pixel) font smoothing enabled.  Notice that it's definitely not occurring, because entire pixels are being dimmed to the sides of characters.\n\n\nA: Applications like Blender or Photoshop just don't render text the same way as native applications. Subpixel rendering is also disabled for elements with a transparent background like the text for icons on the desktop.\nYou can disable subpixel rendering by unchecking System Preferences > General > Use LCD font smoothing when available.\nThere is no AppleFontSmoothing key by default in ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/.GlobalPreferences*.plist or ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist. Setting AppleFontSmoothing to 0 would usually correspond to disabling LCD font smoothing in System Preferences. Setting it to 1 would make text lighter but keep subpixel rendering enabled.\n\nA: Funny thing is that under Mac OS X 10.9.5 (Mavericks), the setting \"LCD font smoothing\" does not appear to have any effect.\nWhen I zoom in to text (control + swipe up), I always get the color fringes on my external Cinema display (driven by a Retina MacBookPro).\nThat occurs apparently in all applications (I tried Safari, Mail, GVim, Finder, Microsoft Word).\n", "Q: No email notifications when Mail.app isn't running?

But it is possible to hide the badge!\nIn System Preferences, open Notifications and select Mail. There, deselect 'Badge app icon with notification count'.\n\n\nA: I can only say that this is true. Mail.app has to be open to get notifications.\n\nA workaround: Open Mail, and close it with the red dot (or command+w). So the blue\n  point under the icon in the Dock is still there. So you have no window\n  open but mail is still getting emails.\n\nThere is no app or anything there yet to fix this \"problem\".\n\nA: Check this out. Seems like this is what you are looking for. http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/32744/herald/download\n\nA: No desktop email application can receive email if it isn't running.\nThe iOS Mail app is a different beast to the OSX app. It is always active in the background.\nI don't see why the OP thinks this is a problem. Just minimise Mail, the dock icon isn't obtrusive.\n\nA: I don't want to test this on my system because it might break code-signing, which could prevent Mail from updating correctly, but quitting an app, adding the lines\n<key>NSUIElement</key>\n<string>1</string> \n\nto the inside of the top-level <dict> of the file /Applications/Mail.app/Contents/Info.plist and then relaunching the app has had the effect in the past of making an app \"faceless\" — no Dock icon, no ⌘tab switching.\n", "Q: Shortcut Keys for Moving Desktops in Mission Control in Mountain Lion 10.8.x? Are there shortcut keys for moving a Desktop in the array of Desktops in Mission Control?\nI can now do this manually using the mouse by dragging and dropping, but I would like to do this with shortcut keys. Sometimes they even get re-arranged on their own (not sure how that even happens).\n\nA: Regrettably I don't believe this is possible. As you've probably noticed, there are no user-accessible options for this in System Preferences' Keyboard Shortcuts. As far as I can determine, there aren't any scriptable interfaces either (plists, Applescript). Options for building your own program seem to be pretty limited as well, according to a mailing list post I found. The most you seem to be able to do programmatically is get the current number of open spaces.\nThe only way to possibly do this without some serious OS X hacking is to use something like Keyboard Maestro to do some GUI scripting to do the dragging for you. However GUI scripting is always a bit messy, and you'd need to account for the changing positions of the desktops, depending on how many are open, etc. I suspect that's not exactly what you were looking for, but it's probably the closest you'll get, unless someone finds something I didn't.

Mountain Lion has introduced a new way for quick scolling which brings quite strange results in Safari.\nHere is the explanation extracted from this Macstories review of ML:\n\nOn Mountain Lion, if you perform a quick scrolling gesture three times in a row the scrolling speed will ramp up to let you reach the end of a document quickly.\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to hide the unread count badge in Mountain Lion's Mail.app?

This is probably a duplicate. I can't imagine I'm the first person to notice this.\nIt seems that Safari 6 has removed the appearance tab from the preferences, and with it, the ability to change the default fonts.\nHow do I change the default fonts for Safari 6?\n\nA: You can still use defaults:\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari com.apple.Safari.ContentPageGroupIdentifier.WebKit2StandardFontFamily Georgia\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari com.apple.Safari.ContentPageGroupIdentifier.WebKit2DefaultFontSize 16\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari com.apple.Safari.ContentPageGroupIdentifier.WebKit2FixedFontFamily Menlo\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari com.apple.Safari.ContentPageGroupIdentifier.WebKit2DefaultFixedFontSize 14\n\nAnother option is to set a CSS file like this as as the default style sheet in the advanced preferences:\nbody {\n  font: 16px Georgia;\n}\npre, code, tt {\n  font: 14px Menlo;\n}\n\nBoth options have precedence over the default stylesheet but not over styles specified by websites. So like the preferences in Safari 5 and earlier, they mostly apply to pages that would normally use 15px Times or 13px Courier.\n\nA: Serenity Caldwell wrote an article on Macworld when Mountain Lion was first released as a dev preview:\n\nSafari no longer offers an option to set default fonts and sizes (though you can upload a style sheet or force the browser not to show font sizes smaller than a certain number)\n\nYou can do this via an extension called User CSS. Pretty simple, add your custom CSS and it will override the styles.\nThere is also an Apple discussion thread about this, but nothing important has come of it so far. One thing that was mentioned was using HelveticaTheWorld, which changes all the fonts to Helvetica. Not terribly useful unless you want Helvetica everywhere... Another extension mentioned is Google Fonts in Safari. It allows you to pick from the Google Fonts library. \nAs of right now, there is no other way to change the fonts in Safari. I would suggest you submit Apple feedback to see if you can get this added back in.\n\nA: Indeed, this is trivially easy with a simple style sheet that overrides the default \"body\" font. All you need is all of three lines long:\nbody {\n    font: 12px \"Lucida Grande\";\n}\n\n\nA: * {font-family: \"Helvetica\" !important;}\npre, code, tt {font-family: \"Menlo\" !important;}\n\nI think that is what you want.

In testing out Keen's response, I found that if I leave my OSX Calendar enabled in iCloud, then look in OSX Reminders, I see all the same tasks as on my iOS devices.

Now, when I look at my iOS device, the task I added while on my Mac is there (and alerted me on my iOS device at the appropriate time). \nSo, temporarily enabling the OSX Calendar/Reminders sync with iCloud is a work-around...certainly not pretty, but do-able...until Apple improves OSX to separate the Reminders iCloud sync from the Calendar iCloud sync.\n", "Q: Upgrade to mountain lion from dual-boot ubuntu configuration I have a Lion installation dual-booted with Ubuntu using refit.  Upon trying to upgrade to Mountain Lion, I reboot into the mountain lion installer, and get a message about OS X not being able to be installed on this disk since it can't be booted.\nHow can I recover from this situation?  My machine is not having a problem being booted (I can work around that).\n\nA: Basically, I ran into the issue discussed on the apple message board.  One of the partitions had been altered (probably by rEFIt), and I had to \"fix it\".  I'll list the steps I went through while troubleshooting.  I guess it goes without saying you should have good backups before you do this.  Not an issue for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm running a MBA 2011, one internal disk, 6 partitions on it in total.\n\n*I repaired the disk with disk utility, reboot (not sure that this did anything).\n\n*I tried to use fdisk -u /dev/disk0, reboot (not sure that this did anything).\n\n*I tried an article about resizing a partition with disk utility, it didn't work.  Some error about wrong partition type, even though it was an HFS+ partition.\n\n*I installed gptfdisk -- installed using brew brew install gptfdisk.  I'm sure you can get it another way.\n\n*\n\n*once installed, you run with sudo gdisk /dev/disk0\n\n*find your \"Recovery Partition\", for me that was partition 3 i <CR> 3 <CR>\n\n*Change the type t <CR> 3 <CR> to Apple Boot\n\n*Write the table w <CR>\n\n*Reboot\n\n\n*Upon reboot I could successfully upgrade to mountain lion\n\n\nTo get Ubuntu back booting I had to do a combination of fixing up the MBR, and re-installing grub to /dev/disk0 (/dev/sda in ubuntu) which should be familiar to most people.  For my case (Macbook air 4-2), I had to follow ubuntu's instructions (skipping things associated with installing the OS of course), especially the part about the bios_grub partition.  This must be something that was done for me in the past, since this is the first I remember seeing it.\n\nA: I also had this problem (on a 2012 MBA). Running rEFIt's partition table tool and accepting the \"update the partition table\" dialog it offered fixed it for me. (The Ubuntu install instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookAir4-2 do tell you to do this to resync the partition tables; but not doing it didn't seem to cause a problem at the time.) For me the only partition table change it made was to change the type of the recovery partition to Apple Boot: probably best to look carefully at what it is proposing on your system before accepting it.\n\nA: I ran into the same problem today with my new retina mbp. And while trying to fix it I remembered having the same problem last year while upgrading OSX on my girlfriend's ubuntified mba 2011...\nThe thing is that (during install) there needs to be some free space after the OSX partion. (http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3926)\nI did not manage to resize the OSX partition using the disk tool, but booting Ubuntu and using gparted I had no problem making it a couple of hounded megs smaller.\nNow the install seems to run just fine... \"15 minutes remaining\" as we speak.\n\nA: Just had a similar experience, but resolved it differently.  \nI created a \"Lion\" partition to install the new OS, leaving my old leopard partition in place.  This made my partition list look like:\n  Leopard\n  Lion\n(Note -- even though the Lion partition looks like it is the last partition in the list, there is actually a hidden Apple Recovery partition, unmounted, as the last partition.  You have to enable the disk utility debug menu to gain access to the hidden partition)\nLion installed fine, but I didn't have enough room for everything I wanted to move to the new OS, so I started tinkering with partition sizes.\nWhile trying to resize/expand the partition for Lion, I removed the hidden disk recovery partition.  This made the Lion partition the last partition in my disk partition list.\nTrying to re-install Lion gave me the \"this disk can't be used to start\" message.  On a hunch, I created a small partition from the bottom of my Lion partition, so that the Lion partition was (once again) NOT the last partition in the list.\nThis fixed the issue.  The installer suddenly allowed me to install to the \"Lion\" partition.\nTo summarize, one of the situations which will prevent the installer from installing to a disk partition, is if it is the final partition in your partition list, including the hidden partitions.\n", "Q: Damaged and can't be open app error message I bought the iBoostUp app when I was using Lion, and one day it suddenly stopped working, I uninstalled it, and yesterday I got Mountain Lion hoping that it would get magically fixed, but it didn't.\nAny clues on how to restore the app?\n\n“iBoostUp” is damaged and can’t be opened. Delete “iBoostUp” and download it again from the App Store!\n\n\nA: In Terminal, run \"xattr -rc /Applications/Application.app\", that should fix it (naturally, replace \"/Applications/Application.app\" with your actual application path. No need to disable GateKeeper.\n\nA: For a similar problem, with the (Java) application Sawmill, it was sufficient to \"Allow applications downloaded from: Anywhere.\"  I got the \"damaged\" error when I tried to run it; then I changed that setting to Anywhere; and now I don't get that error anymore.  Looks like a bug in Mountain Lion, sort of: the error message could be a lot better, e.g., something saying that Security & Privacy settings disallow that application.  Anyway, thanks for the suggestions; it worked.\n\nA: From their FAQ:\niBoostUp fails to launch after an update with error \"iBoostUp is damaged and can't be opened\"\nWe've had intermittent reports of this occurring with our 3.1 and 3.2 updates.\nThis issue is not specific to iBoostUp and related to a problem with the App Store itself.\nTo resolve, please:\nRemove iBoostUp from your Applications\nRemove com.ituneup.ituneup.plist and com.ituneup.ituneup.plist.lockfile from ~/Library/Preferences\nDownload iBoostUp from the Mac App Store\nIn case you are unable to locate the above-mentioned files please try the following:\nOpen Terminal.app from Applications -> Utilities\nType \"rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.ituneup.*\" without quotes and then hit [enter]\nRe-download iBoostUp again from the app store.\nTo re-enable any of your previous purchases please follow the steps in FAQ entry #12 \n\nA: I have received the same \"[Application] is damaged and can’t be opened.\" error when trying to run unsigned applications in Mountain Lion. Notably Davmail.\nTry the \"Allow applications downloaded from: Anywhere\" setting in the \"Security & Privacy\" System Preferences pane :\n\nFor whatever reason you may be running an old, unsigned version of the app.\n\nA: Don't forget to\n\nxattr -rc /Applications/Miro\\ Video\\ Converter.app\n\nOtherwise you'll get a \"App is damaged\" message after editing the app ;-)\n\nA: I have had the same issue with an app today (Nov 12 '15) on El Capitan and it was caused by an App Store certificate issue.\nSee more details here.\nIn my case deleting and redownloading the app helped (but strangely I had to repeat this procedure 2 or 3 times...).\n", "Q: Is otool removed in Mountain Lion? I can't find /usr/bin/otool any more in Mountain Lion.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does anybody know why otool is removed?\n\n*Is there any alternative for otool in Mountain Lion.\n\n\nA: In a somewhat-recent version of the Xcode developer tools, the command-line utilities were moved into a separate package. You can either install them from inside Xcode or just download them separately. See my answer here for more details: I installed Xcode but I still don't have gcc in my terminal.\n", "Q: If I save files in iCloud, where are they \"really\"? If I save files to iCloud in apps in Mountain Lion that support such saving, where on my drive can I find these files if I want to run command line utilities on them, edit them in other programs, etc?\n\nA: They're located at ~/Library/Mobile Documents.\n\nEach application has its own individual folder under Mobile Documents where its documents and settings are stored.\n\nA: The folder ~/Library/Mobile Documents seems to be the magic iCloud folder. In fact, if you open said folder in the Finder, the folder name changes to iCloud and it gets a cloud icon rather than a standard folder icon. Pressing ⌘↑ will not return you to the ~/Library folder.\n", "Q: How can I force specific HiDPI modes? I have a 13\" MBP (Early 2011) plugged it to a Dell U2711 monitor via DisplayPort.\nI have successfully enabled HiDPI mode, using Quartz Debug the problem is that the screen won't run at the HiDPI equivalent of the screen's native resolution. i.e 1440x720 HiDPI (2560x1440). The screen's maximum resolution of 2560x1440 is recognised & working.\n\nThe best it will do is 960x720HiDPI (1920x1440), which seems strange as most of the documentation suggests HiDPI will only work at pixel doubling resolutions.\n\nIs it possible to force the MBP to run the display at 1440x720 HiDPI on a screen that supports 2560x1440 native pixel resolution?\n\nA: After a lot of messing about I managed to get this working in two ways.\n\n\n*\n\n*The first is by using the Retina Display Manager I found on reddit.\nThis gives a menu with all the available display modes, but try the second method first.\nScreenshot 1 (Warning, large file)\n\n*The second I found after using Retina Display Manager, to my surprise the Displays pane in System Preferences was reporting it was running in 720p mode.\nThis mode is actually 1280x720 HiDPI (2560x1440).\nScreenshot 2 (Warning, large file)\nYay!\nI was going to embed screenshots of these new menus, but they are now insanely huge due to HiDPI mode, so I just linked to them instead.\n", "Q: How can I put the folder containing my iCloud documents in the Finder sidebar? iCloud documents live in ~Library/Mobile Documents. But if I try to drag said folder to the Finder sidebar, I get a \"do not enter\" sign, and it won't add. How can I put my iCloud documents folder in the Finder Sidebar?\n\nA: First, make an alias to the ~/Library/Mobile Documents folder. Then, drag the alias to the sidebar.\n", "Q: Can I dismiss a Notification Center Alert using the mouse? Is it possible to dismiss a sticky \"alert\" (from Notification Center) from the upper-right corner of the screen by using the mouse?\n\nA: Yes! You can simply click and drag the alert off to the right and it will disappear. If you have a multi-touch input device such as a trackpad, you can also use two fingers and swipe it away to the right.\nAdditionally, you can temporarily move the notification by dragging it to the left:\n\nIt will stay there for a few seconds and then move back to its original position.

For many, reducing their MTU size solved the issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences.\n\n*Select Network.\n\n*Select your connection and choose Advanced...\n\n*Select Hardware.\n\n*Change Configuration to Manually\n\n*Reduce the MTU size to 1300. Most people had good experiences with this value.\n\n*Observe how ping behaves over time. You can further reduce the MTU size in steps of 4.\n\n\nHowever, there seems to be another issue: Proxies. The solution suggested here is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences.\n\n*Select Network.\n\n*Select your connection and choose Advanced...\n\n*Select Proxies.\n\n*Turn off Auto Discovery Proxies.\n\n*Apply the settings.\n\n\nThis should be fixed with an upgrade to OS X 10.8.1 (not sure if an upgrade to Mountain Lion directly brings you to the latest upgrade, or to 10.8.0).\nActually, I would first try the upgrade to 10.8.1. If this does not work, try the proxy solution. If this does not work, try the MTU size reduction.\n", "Q: How do I get my user directory working for web sharing again? I had web sharing enabled in Lion and a web site at http://localhost/~user, where user is my User directory.

The configuration files are in /etc/apache2/users/.  The missing one is user.conf, where user is your short username.\nIf you don't want to fiddle with the command line, here's an Applescript you can run to create a configuration file for your user.

Just updated the mountain lion, and download the latest Eclipse 4.2 to upgrade the old one. However when opening the application, it shows that it is from an unidentified developer and the gatekeeper refuses to open it.\nI know that there is an option to change the security and privacy option to allow it, however I want to know whether there is a way to just add eclipse into the list. Any hint on this?\nMore information: before updating I have the Eclipse 3.7.2 on machine, and after updating it works smoothly (I think I have added it into the allow list). So is there a way to do this to Eclipse 4.2?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Actually, just right-click on any app that Gatekeeper complains about and select \"Open\". You'll get a warning, but one of the buttons is \"open\". After you select \"open\" in the dialog box, you'll never see the warning for that application again.\nThis is explained as exempting the specific application in Apple's Gatekeeper FAQ:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491\n\nA: No, there's no specific editable \"list\" for Gatekeeper. Apps that are already present on your system are by default added to the Gatekeeper \"whitelist\", which is why it runs without incident after you updated to Mountain Lion.\nThe only options you have are to change your security preferences to allow all apps, or to right/Control-click on the newly downloaded app and select \"Open\". This will allow you to bypass Gatekeeper for that app now and always.\n\nA: *\n\n*disable Gatekeeper (\"Allow applications downloaded from: Anywhere\")\n\n*run Eclipse once\n\n*reset Gatekeeper to a more strict level (\"Mac Store and identified developers\".)\n\n\nDoing this has allowed me to start Davmail, also a Java app, after Mountain Lion initially claimed the binary was corrupt (\"App is damaged and can’t be opened\" error message) even when back on the stricter level.\nAnother option, as mentioned in John Siracusa's excellent review, is to do the following from the Terminal:\n% xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/Eclipse.app\n\nI have not (yet) personally tested this but John's a solid source.\n\nA: Yes there is such a list:\nfrom man spctl\n/var/db/SystemPolicy.\n\nUse the spctl tool to add and remove items from the policy.\n", "Q: Game Center in Mountain Lion won't let me log in I'm trying to log in to Game Center using my Apple ID but it just won't let me do it. Actually, nothing happens: no error messages, just nothing.\nI think there is an issue, because I also get a pop-up window where I suppose a new registration could be done within the same program, but it's blank (Annulla means Cancel):\n\nApart from what is being suggested in this question about Chess over Game Center, why isn't the simple log in working? I could use the workaround but I want the standard way to work anyways.\n\nA: I had a similar problem. For me, there was a verification screen that popped up behind the login screen. I could not see it at all! Not sure why I thought of it, but dragging the frontmost window out of the way showed me the verification screen, I did what needed to be done there, and on I went to Game Center to be underwhelmed.\n\nA: There is a bug that causes this. I can't log in either, and the issue isn't with the account because creating a new profile didn't help.\n\nA: I'm not sure if you ever got this resolved, but I just had pretty much the same problem in Mavericks. The only difference is that, rather than being stuck on that blank screen, the screen would show up, disappear, ask me to log in again, and repeat in a never ending loop. What I did to solve this was quit out of Chess, but leave Game Center open. This then let me log in normally and it worked fine after that.\n", "Q: View location of a document open in Preview I've got a PDF open in Preview (5.5.2) and I want to know where it is located in my filesystem.

I have verified all partitions, and cleaned up file system permissions.  In addition I have resized my main partition slightly to make sure the EFI has been recreated (in case it had problems).\nStill no go. Do I really have to reinstall the full HD?\nWORKAROUND: When I selected the partition \"Blank\" (disk0s4) as my upgrade partition, the warning dialogue didn't appear.  It installed a fresh OSX Mountain Lion on it, and I used the Migration Assistant to copy settings, programs and users from the primary partition.  This means that the Recovery HD was not at fault even though the installer claimed that, but I guess something was \"wrong\" with my primary partition.  This solution still isn't a very good one.\n\nA: From what I've been able to gather, this issue occurred because of the existence of partition 4. A default install of OS X, as of Lion, involves three partitions: EFI, your OS X boot volume, and the recover partition.\nFeatures such as Recovery Mode and FileVault require original partitioning schemes in many cases - especially when FileVault is already in use on a partition, as it the partition scheme has been converted to a CoreStorage group. This makes things much messier to try installing without an original layout.\nThis seems to be the most likely cause of your error. Since I have no logs, dumps, or other material to go by, I can only speculate and apply my knowledge and experience to the matter. However, seeing as OS X installed just fine to the 4th partition, which was blank, it seems to me that the partition scheme itself was to blame, as I stated above. Sorry about the inconvenience.\nGood luck and happy upgrading!\n", "Q: Is it possible to dual-boot Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion? I want to try out the new version of OS X (Mountain Lion), but since I'm so comfortable with my current installation of Lion, I do not want to do a normal upgrade and install/customize all my programs from scratch. Instead, I'd like to be able configure my MBP to a dual-boot system, so that I can switch to whichever OS I want to use at the moment.\nWhats the best way to proceed, without screwing up my installation of Lion? \n\nA: *\n\n*take a full backup to an external usb drive using a tool like Superduper or CarbonCopyCloner and boot it to make sure it's good (select disk using \"Startup Disk\" in System Preferences.) You need a good backup before messing with the partitions.\n\n*Using Disk Utility (/Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app) select your internal drive in the left-hand column and select the \"Partition\" tab in the right-hand column. Hit the \"+\" button under partition layout to create an additional partition. You can use the slider in the partition layout or the \"Size\" textbox to change the partition sizes. Hit \"Apply\" to confirm changes and write to disk.\n\nAll partitions will be dynamically resized, presuming they pass a fsck (filesystem check test.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Install OS X Mountain Lion.app (no need to bother with usb install disk creation) and accept the license agreement. When you get to the screen showing the install disk click the \"Show All Disks...\" button and select the partition you just created.\n\n*Proceed with the installation as normal (this being Apple you will not be asked for a lot of input.) As part of the installation the installer will boot into the second partition for you. If you want you can use the Migration Assistant in the final stages of the installation to import all users and settings from your Lion partition.\n\n\nThat's all there is to it! I've done this on an iMac and a Macbook Pro so far this week with minimal problems. Only the Macbook Pro couldn't pass the fsck and I needed to boot to the recovery partition to repair the root fs before I was able to shrink and create another partition.\n\nAddendum: repairing the system partition\nThe system partition cannot be resized if it does not pass a filesystem check and you cannot repair the system partition while you are booted into that system so you will need to boot from an alternate one. Apple has made this very easy by automatically creating a Recovery Partition in OSX Lion and later.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot the system. While booting press and hold down the \"option\" (aka \"alt\") key until you are presented with a list of boot devices and choose the \"Recovery HD\" disk. (Alternatively press and hold [CMD]+[R] during boot to boot directly to Recovery)\n\n*You are presented with a list of utilities, choose Disk utility\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Now you have the familiar Disk Utility interface but on a linen background. Select your system partition from the left-hand column and select the \"First Aid\" tab in the right-hand column, finally click the \"Repair Disk\" button located at the lower right-hand side of the text box.\n\n\n\nA lot of text will scroll by in the text box. If all goes well you should end with a message telling you that \"Volume repair is complete.\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Now reboot (\"Apple Menu\" > Restart) and let the system boot as normal.\n\n\nA: Best way is making 2nd partition, prepare USB Flash installer, and install ML on 2nd partition \n", "Q: Xcode 4.4: how to copy on other machine Is it safe to just copy the Xcode 4.4 app from a machine to another or does the Mac App Store download an installer, rather than just a bundled app, and some Xcode 4.4 pieces get installed somewhere in the system?\n\nA: Xcode, from version 4.3 on, is a single app and self-contained. Source :\n\nThis version of Xcode is distributed as a single application bundle,\n  Xcode.app, installed through the Mac App Store directly to the\n  Applications folder. Installing Xcode 4.3 no longer requires the\n  Install Xcode application\n\nThe command line tools, which are stored elsewhere on the filesystem, are an optional download which you can install separately.\nWhen copied over manually, the App Store will recognise Xcode.app's presence  and change the badge for the application in your \"Purchases\" from \"install\" to \"installed\".\n", "Q: How do I change the number of desktops in Mountain Lion? I have just downloaded Mountain Lion and I would like more than one desktop (the default setting) how do I change the number of desktops?\n\nA: Open \"Mission Control\" (icon should be in the Dock or else through Launchpad) and move your mouse to the upper-right hand corner. A '+' sign will appear allowing you to create an additional virtual desktop. The dimmed half of a new desktop appears in the upper left if the dock is changed to the right side of the screen but otherwise is in the upper right when the dock is in the left or the bottom.\nAdd a Desktop\n\nRemove a Desktop\n\n\nA: Just received new from Apple Macbook Pro running ML, 10.8, 2 November 2012.\nFor more desktops, activate Mission Control and put mouse into upper right corner.  A very small image of the desktop I use comes up.  Click on it to create another desktop.\nTo remove/delete a desktop, hover the cursor over the desktop to remove and an X will appear (while in 'mission control.')  Just like widgets or apps on the iPhone.\n\nA: In addition to the excellent answer given by @Tyr, you can quickly create a new desktop by dragging any window to the area where your newly created desktops appear. The button-image will darken, and Mission Control will immediately create a new desktop for that window (or group of windows).\nBefore dropping window:\n\nAfter dropping window:\n\n\nAt any time in Mission Control, you can hold Alt to see the \"New Desktop\" button image, as well as \"Close\" buttons on all your desktops.\nEdit: Forgot to mention that holding Alt also keeps you in Mission Control; clicking on a desktop will focus that desktop in MC, but not activate it. Comes in handy.\n\nA: In Mountain Lion, if your dock is on the right side of the screen then you have to navigate to the upper left corner of the screen, not the upper right. Not sure why that change was necessary...\n", "Q: Enabling Java 7 on Mountain Lion The first time I tried to use Java on Mountain Lion, it installed automatically. Unfortunately, it installed Java 6, so I installed Java 7. If I navigate to Java in System Preferences, only Java 7 is listed. How do I switch to Java 7, or remove Java 6?\n\nA: Apple's tools don't see Java 7, Oracle's tools don't see Java 6; it's all a bit ugly.

Is it possible to downgrade Safari 6 to 5 in Mountain Lion? \nI tried to install 5.1.7 but it says it only works with OS X 10.7.\nIs there any workaround I can try?\n\nA: No, you can't go back with Safari on Mountain Lion.\n\nA: Yes you can. See this answer:\nHow do you remove Safari 6 on Mac OS X 10.7.4\n\nA: Sorry this answer is for downgrading Safari 6 in Lion only\nYes you can go back to Safari 5.1.7 from Safari 6. I found the uninstaller on this site. Third from the top is Safari 6 - Lion uninstaller, click this to download, run it, reboot and Safari 5.1.7 will (surprisingly) reappear, I have just done it, no problems though YMMV.\n", "Q: Where is \"jvisualvm\" in Mountain Lion Just upgraded to Mountain Lion (of course). I use Java on a daily basis so I asked Mac OS X to install it right away. It installed \"Java 6\". I am more than OK with it.\nThe only thing I don't have is a utility that comes (used to come at least) with it that is called 'jvisualvm'. Any ideas on how to install it on Mountain Lion?\n\nA: You should be able to download it from http://visualvm.java.net/index.html.\n", "Q: How to fix DNS resolving issues on Mountain Lion after waking from sleep? After I installed Mountain Lion the other day I've noticed something very annoying. Almost every time I wake my iMac (27\", mid-2010, CI7) from sleep: it seems that something DNS-related is broken. When I try connecting to other machines using their IP (v4 & v6) addresses I can SSH and send pings, but resolving host names isn't working very well.\nNow I have not yet tried checking my DNS server logs to see if the requests are even making it there. Though I suspect that the DNS request are not making it to the DNS server since a quick reboot of the client machine or using another client machine works ok.\nI've seen a couple of mentions of similar problems on other sites but no credible answers to why this problem appears, one user who was using WiFi apparently \"fixed\" it by toggling some random seemingly unrelated WiFi and sleep settings which just makes me suspect that this issue is some setting that got broken.\nI'd love to find a reliable workaround/solution to this problem but I've double-checked all settings in the power management and network preference panes and it all looks fine. I have also tried re-saving the settings after making some changes and then reverting to the original settings just to see if that fixed it for me as well, no such luck. How to fix DNS resolving after wake from sleep?\nEdit: I am only using wired networking myself and wifi is completely turned off. Both IPv4 and IPv6 settings have been made manually.\nThe network is a plain old 192.168.1.0/24 subnet with all machines connected to a fairly cheap managed gigE switch, 100/100 Mbps FTTH connection that goes to a FreeBSD box which acts as the gateway, dhcp (isc-dhcp for 192.168.1.1-72) and DNS (bind) server. IPv6 connectivity is through a Sixxs tunnel. Pretty standard setup that hasn't caused any problems in the past.\n\nA: I've had this exact same experience, though not every time. Sometimes it means sites that I have visited recently are unavailable but other sites I haven't visited in ages load just fine. \nUsually flushing the DNS cache resolves it.\nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n\n\nA: Occasionally I get this as well. When it happens, I tell the system to flush the DNS:\n# As root or sudo it\ndscacheutil -flushcache\n\nIn the power settings, to avoid sleep/wake related issues, I've disabled the system's \"put disk to sleep\" option, as apparently, it can cause issues with SSD equiped boxes.\n", "Q: Has Mountain Lion helped take advantage of multiple displays? after using Lion I was frustrated by the lack of multiple display integration it had. When I swiped between spaces, the secondary display served no purpose but to display that gray linen pattern that we're starting to see appear everywhere.\nHas anyone discovered a feature in Mountain Lion that allows more function to come out of a secondary display? I would really hope there is.\nThanks for the help,\nGreg\n\nA: The only change in Mountain Lion related to multiple displays is the ability to make an app go full-screen on a display other than the main one. Unfortunately, you can still only have one full-screen app open at once (the linen covers whatever display the app isn't on).\nI recommend using a window manager like Divvy to easily make apps take up the full screen space and switch them between displays quickly.\n", "Q: In Mail.app 6.0, is there a way to drag-select parts of message bodies? In Mail.app 6.0 with 10.8 Mountain Lion, Apple has chosen to make it impossible to drag-select text in a message that has been sent or received. In previous versions, you could do as you can with every other single program that handles user-created text anywhere in the operating system (!!!) and put your cursor anywhere in the message, drag to highlight the text you want, and then, voilà, there'd you have a discrete selection of text that you could, say, copy. \nNow, in Mail.app 6.0, when you try this in the body of a sent or received message, you instead get a little mail icon. Mail.app assumes you want to drag the whole message somewhere else! This is highly counterintuitive program behavior. \nIt is impossible to drag-select text in a sent or received mail message, as far as I can tell with the settings Mail.app currently has. The only approximation is to double-click on a word (which selects it; triple-click will select a sentence), then hold the shift key, then click on the end of the text you want to select, then copy or whatever as you like. But even with this method it is impossible to select just a part of a word.\nHow can I revert Mail.app 6.0 to the proper drag-select behavior that works absolutely everywhere else on the system? The way Mail.app 6.0 behaves for this is counter to my 24 years of history with the various Mac OSes.\nUPDATE: It seems to have resolved itself. I am not sure what did it but now it behaves as it should.\n\nA: I had the same issue after upgrade to 10.8, had some old emails sitting open that I had minimized, closed all of them and then quit Mail. After restarting the issue went away, had previously tried to quit/restart/change layout with no luck.\n\nA: I had the exact same issue. Oddly, switching from Classic layout to the new layout \"fixed\" it for me. Problem now is, I hate the new layout..\n\nA: If you double click on the mail item in the list view, it will open in a new window.  Then you can highlight the text properly.\n", "Q: How to migrate several usb Time Machine backups to a Time Capsule? I have several Mac each with its own USB hard drive, holding a Time Machine Backup.\nI am wondering if I can move all of them to a Time Capsule. I have seen tutorial about single time machine backup, and as I understood, it's not a standard or official procedure.\nBut I didn't see any tutorial or advice for moving more than one backup.\nDon't know if it's relevant, all the backups have been made under Lion, then Mountain Lion, and Time Capsule will backup ML machine.\n\nA: Finally, I decided to give a try by myself. I had no particular problem, I just followed the well known procedure of backup to Time Capsule, interrupt, and restore the USB drive to the Time Capsule sparsebundle related to the machine.\nAll my previous backup, have ben recognized.\nHowever, for 500GB of data I had to wait for two days to be completed. \nApparently, by matching the two .sparsebundle size, the data seemed to be transferred in a reasonable time from 4 to 7 hours. For the rest, it just seems that disk utility stopped doing nothing for the rest of the time. \nEven the USB drive went in stand by mode for almost two days. Then, after two days, it just stop informing that the restore went fine.\n", "Q: Disable saving to iCloud in Mountain Lion Mountain Lion introduced a feature where you can save your documents to iCloud instead of local storage.\n\nI don't ever see myself using it, is there a way to disable this (but I don't want to disable iCloud entirely)?\n\nA: Actually I found there's a switch in System Preferences > iCloud > Documents & Data\n\n\nA: If you don't want to uncheck Documents & Data from System Preferences, there is also an unexposed preference that disables showing the iCloud-centric open dialog when there are no open windows:\ndefaults write -g NSShowAppCentricOpenPanelInsteadOfUntitledFile -bool false\n\nIt makes TextEdit create an untitled document and Preview not open any window.\nUnlike unchecking Documents & Data, it does not disable using the iCloud-centric open dialog when you for example press command-O.\n", "Q: How to restores files lost from application during upgrade of app I had a lot of important files on my iPhone in an app called Documents Mobile Office. \nDuring upgrade of the application, the upgrade failed & the application does not reload.

You can be sure FileVault is off by seeing the following from terminal:\nMac:~ me$ diskutil cs list\nNo CoreStorage logical volume groups found\n\nAlternatively, you could disable and re-enable the File Vault encryption and watch for the prompt where it asks if the OS user should be permitted to unlock the drive with the user's password. \nIf you select yes from that, the user will show up on the first login screen and both unlock the FileVault protected volume and log in with the same credentials.\n\nA: If anyone else tried bmike's method but didn't fix multiple logins, try the following :\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences\n\n*Security and Privacy\n\n*Unlock the settings using the lock button (buttom left)\n\n*Advanced\n\n*Disable \"Log out after ## minutes of inactivity\" option\n\n\nNow you should only get one login screen after a screen saver or waking up, rather than logging you out and having to enter the password twice.\nWhat I deduced from this is that it logs you out, and you have to enter the password to log in again. Then the lock to the desktop shows up, where you have to enter the password again to access the main desktop.

I started with Leopard OSX, then upgraded to Snow Leopard, then upgraded to Lion.  \nNow Mountain Lion is unleashed. Is it recommended to make a fresh install or upgrading is just fine?\nDoes OSX suffer from bad performance over multiple OS upgrading processes?\n\nA: As a rule, the OS takes care of itself. An upgrade both ensures the core OS is intact, but also disables code that is too old to run. \nIf you would have done a clean install anyhow - lots of slowness, crashiness, etc. Then that's the reason to do a clean install. In the past (10.4 and earlier) the install process was different than the migration assistant but as the migration assistant has matured, it now runs anytime you upgrade so unless you hand migrate files and preferences, there is no difference between a clean install and an upgrade in place (assuming you select apps and settings in the assistant). \nI personally love a clean install and using all the defaults for a week. Consciously installing just what I need feels \"right\" for me and if I end up missing everything, I can always wipe and migrate the entire setup a week I to using the new OS. \nIn summary, for most users, the changes in the OS have disabled the worst offenders in terms of performance, and gatekeeper keeps most old apps from running until you explicitly allow them to run. If you have performance issues, you can always flip that switch and reboot to isolate the cause of slowness. \n\nA: If you have all your data backed up and you are pretty sure that you won't be rolling back for any reason , then do a clean install, otherwise...choose the upgrade . For long run, I would definitely recommend a clean install.\n\nA: Lion to Mountain Lion are optimized for upgrade.  However, the fact that you went from 10.6 to 10.7 I would recommend a clean install of Mountain Lion.  \n", "Q: iMac wiped clean, no install disc I just bought two iMac's at an auction, they were both wiped clean before the sale. The problem is when I turn them on I'm getting a screen with an icon of a folder with a question mark. So the guy wiped them but didn't reinstall it, or so I believe. \nI did not get any of the disc's for the computer because it was a school sale, so I have no idea how I can installed the system so I can use them. I do have a Macbook Pro running Mac OS X version 10.6.8, however the disc that came with it didn't work on the large iMac's, which I figured it wouldn't.\nMy question is what do I do at this point? Is there a way to start them, Do I need to buy a disc?\n\nA: Unless your MacBook Pro lacks a FireWire port, you can use Target Disk Mode to have the iMac reboot and act as a FireWire drive.\nFrom there, you could use Disk Utility (or Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper or other tools) to make a bootable copy of the MBP's OS onto the iMac's drive.\nAlternatively, you might buy Mountain Lion or use a past Lion purchase from the app store to download an installer and run it from the MBP. You could choose to install the OS onto the \"external drive\" that is the iMac. Then you could chain the second iMac (or repeat this activity).\nIt really depends what OS you want and can run on the iMacs.\nYour first step is to run the serial number of the iMacs to this page and see what Apple's service name for each Mac. From there, you will know what OS shipped and if the Mac can run Lion or Mountain Lion.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/manuals/#\nJust enter the serial number in the address bar past the # or enter it into the form on the web page. You can always order replacement media from Apple, but there will be a charge for that. The other suggestions to buy a retail packaging DVD to install will likely be an inexpensive way to acquire an install OS once you have determined what OS can run and which OS you want to run.\n\nA: I'm not sure you can find a Snow Leopard installation disk to buy anymore.\nYou could buy Moutain Lion on the App Store on your MacBook Pro and create a bootable USB key in order to install the OS on your iMacs. \nTo turn a USB key to a Moutain Lion installer and then to use it, I recommend you this tutorial.\nEDIT : before you do that, you should be sure that the two iMacs are recent enough to support Moutain Lion. \n\nA: You need to download the OS from the app store (onto another Mac already running OS X) and the you can either create a bootable USB or DVD and install it.\nYou can find the instructions here http://eggfreckles.net/notes/installing-mountain-lion-clean/\nThough the instructions are for Moutain Lion , it stands good for Snow Leopard and Lion too.\nIf you need any specific help, please feel free to ask.\nHope this helps\n\nA: I also had the same problem \nJust call the apple support line and give them the serial number \nthey will check the operating DVD shipped with that unit and send it to you \nApple sent me the Original DVD for my iMac and the upgrade for snow leopard FREE   \n\nA: Realise this is quite an old thread but was helpful for me today! After a bit of searching around I managed to do it -\nYou can make a USB install disk by re-downloading the OS on a separate Mac but not installing it. (I'm currently running OS X Yosemite) You should end up with a 'Install Yosemite' file in your application folder.\nGet a program called Disc Maker X which can be found here: http://diskmakerx.com/\nFollow the instructions and it will make the USB start up disk for you. You'll need a usb stick at least 8gb in size.\nWhen all is finished, you should be able to boot and install the OS on the wiped machine from the USB disk.\nI did this today after purchasing an old 2007 iMac. Now running OSX Yosemite 10.10.5. All seems fine and dandy so far!\n\nA: I had almost the same problem I think the best idea is to go to apple store.\n( I did not go to the store for 7 years ,I still has to go to the store :) .\n", "Q: How to check how much battery each application uses? How would one check how much battery an application uses from a full charge of 100%?\nAre there any applications out there or is this impossible?\n\nA: This is pretty much impossible. Each program doesn't directly use battery power - they all use the CPU, which uses battery power. But every other hardware component uses power as well - the screen, GPU, hard drive/SSD, etc. And of course you're not just running one program at a time, you're typically running several, plus all the background processes for the OS and other services. This is further complicated by how the OS and CPU allocate resources - despite how it appears, everything isn't running simultaneously, the CPU just switches between tasks every quickly, giving the appearance of everything running concurrently. On top of that, modern CPUs can change the amount of power they draw depending on the tasks going on.\nSo the effect that each program has on battery life depends on a lot of factors, most of which aren't easily measurable. The closest you could get might be tracking the CPU utilization of each program over time, and making an estimate based on the battery drain over that period. However that would be a very rough estimate, and not very accurate for any useful purpose I can think of.\n", "Q: Just upgraded to Mountain Lion and I have to buy iPhoto again? I originally was on Leopard.  Then I got the free upgrade to Snow Leopard.\nI bought Lion when it was released and removed it after a few months because it made my machine too slow.  I upgraded the RAM and upgraded to Mountain Lion yesterday.\nBut iPhoto is missing?  During the last two years I bought (from Apple) an iLife disc.  Remember discs?  lol\nAnyway, it's iLife 11 so technically I could install it from disc but I like the app store experience.  Do I really have to pay $15 again for iPhoto in order to get it from the app store?  Or is there another way?\n\nA: You can always re-run the disc based installer and avoid re-purchaing the app from the App Store. Eventually you will buy a new Mac which will then allow you to claim the App Store licenses for iLife without paying additional fees.\nI'm stuck in the same boat with Aperture. The convenience of the App Store isn't enough to make me want to re-pay for the software I have a DVD based install.\n\nA: Since you've never purchased it from the App Store, you cannot re-download iPhoto from the App Store (unless you buy it again).\nThe only way you get re-download rights to iLife on the App Store is if you either purchased it from the App Store or bought a Mac that does not come with a software re-install disc.\n\nA: The same thing happened to me! I didn't have a disc and didn't want to pay for it on the App Store so I made a Genius Barn appointment. I explained my situation and they pulled out an external hard drive with all the software on it and re-installed it for free. If your close to an Apple store and have enough time, I would try that. \n\nA: You cannot download it from the App store. Once installed from the disc, you get free updates though. \n", "Q: How to set noatime for startup drive in Mountain Lion?

Can this work under Windows as well?\n\nA: I see no reason why you could not plug three external monitors into a Mac, whether it's running OS X, or Windows under bootcamp.\nThere are two Thunderbolt connectors and one HDMI connector, and they all work as video outputs - the driver should be able to handle a monitor plugged into each of these.\nAs the comment on the question mentions, Windows does not know how to handle retina displays all that well - but for external (non-retina) monitors it should not have any issues.\n\nA: I just went as far as attaching two external displays (1920x1200 + 1280x1024 + the internal at native 2880x1800) and apart from the fan blowing slightly I didn't run into any problems. I don't think that three external displays at that moderate resolution of 1680x1050 pose a problem especially when you don't bump up the internal resolution to native. The guys at OWC attached two thunderbolt displays with considerably higher resolution and a FUllHD to the rMBP. If the OS X driver is able to handle it I am pretty sure the windows driver can do just as well.\n\nA: Well, it depends on which rMBP you have. Depending on the year and if you do or do not have the dedicated GPU, you may or may not be able to (easily) drive 3 external monitors.\nAs far as I know, none of the base model 15\" rMBP (the ones without the dedicated GPU) can drive three external displays WHILE IN OS X.\nHere's where this is interesting to me. 3 external monitors works PERFECTLY in Windows 10 through Bootcamp. Which means that the lack of support for 3 displays is purely software limitations and nothing to do with hardware capability. I've no idea why there would be a limitation in OS X since I feel it runs lighter than Windows 10 in the first place, but for some reason, without some sort of adapter (or an Apple TV, but who really would enjoy using a wireless Apple TV-connected display as a computer monitor?) it is impossible to run 3 external displays on a 15\" rMBP unless it is equipped with the dedicated GPU. \n", "Q: How to upload pictures from an iPhone?

The reason for asking is that they introduced pf in Lion, but kept ipfw, however there is a chance that ipfw would eventually be removed.\nI found this: Can I use ipfw on OSX 10.8 (Mountain Lion), but that was asked before releasing Mountain Lion and there is no answer.\n\nA: Yes it is. I use it for my firewall needs. A great way to test if it still exists, is to just run it. Open Terminal.app and enter the following command:\nsudo ipfw list\n\nIt should report the following (rules may vary):\n65535 allow ip from any to any\n\nAdditionally, Apple will not remove it as it is actually the backend for the default Application Firewall found in System Preferences, at least not for some time.\nYou can read up more on ipfw in OS X using Apple's Manual Page (or simply type man ipfw in Terminal.app).\nAs for pf (the actual implementation of OS X is pfctl), it is a much more object orientated program that can control network access translation and packet filter (while ipfw requires external components to handle them). It is born from OpenBSD (as opposed to FreeBSD) and has been around for quite a while as well. It's power comes from being able to accomplish more internally, but also optimize long rulesets (that sometimes bogs ipfw down). They are both, however, excellent firewalls and can coexist quite happily.

What is the difference between an SSD and the flash drive in the latest MacBook Pros? The only difference I've noted is the price, because MacBook Pro with retina display costs $2799 with a 512 GB flash drive. At the same time, MacBook Pro without the retina display costs $2199 plus $800 for a 512 GB SSD, for a total of $2999, and a difference of $200 from the MacBook Pro with retina display.\nSo what is the difference between the two types of drives?\n\nA: Usually when Apple says \"SSD\" they refer to a removable/upgradeable solid-state (flash) storage device. The MBP with Retina Display (and the MacBook Airs) are also using solid-state storage, but they are non-removable.\nSee also: http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2371288,00.asp\n\nA: Up till now and including the current models, an SSD sold by Apple is a standard drive enclosure using the SATA interface and you could use that drive in pretty much any PC or Mac or with external drive enclosures and interfaces. \nFlash storage like in all of the Air and the retina MacBook Pro use non-typical connectors that you can not just place in another computer.

Going back into App Store, it shows 10.8 with the download button, so it seems that the install hasn't worked?  Shutting down, rebooting and restarting several times has not helped.  \nThe apple menu / About this Mac / More Info / shows:    Software OS X 10.8 (12A269) \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_v10.8#Release_history suggests the build is 12A269 (GM), but I don't know if the GM is significant.  \nIs this a concern? If so, how can I download and install the final version of Mountain Lion from the App Store?\n\nA: This shouldn't be a concern. (I followed the same path of installing the GM seed.) The App Store allows you to re-download the installer if you desire, but indeed, the build you installed is the same as the release version. If  > About This Mac shows Mountain Lion, you're running Mountain Lion!\n", "Q: How do I see who's online to my linked Gchat and Facebook Chat in Messages? I had Google Chat and Facebook Chat linked to iChat, but since I upgraded to Mountain Lion I can't see who's online through the bar that used to display along side messaging window. Any ideas?\n\nA: The sidebar shows your list of open chats. When someone is offline, the text \"Offline\" shows under their name:\n\nThis also depends on whether you have iMessage-enabled contact information for those people — it seems that if you do, they never appear as Offline.\n(Also note that the buddy list window still works well for seeing who's online!)\n\nA: Under the window menu you can access all the same contact lists as before (or a unified list if you chose that within Messages preferences)\nCommand + [a number] is the shortcut to open/close these windows\n\n\nA: I had the same inconvenience but then found it. It's the exact same buddy list you had in iChat:\nCommand + 1 \nOr Window - Buddies. \n", "Q: What bitness is Mountain Lion kernel, because `uname -p` returns `i386`?

Safari 6 integrated an address bar and a search box together.  So when you want to search a keyword, you just type into the address box.  That's maybe good.\nBefore, when you type something in the old search box, you were seeing a url that contains all search term as query strings in the old address bar.  For example, if you type Safari 6 in the search box, you'll see something like https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=safari+6… in the address bar.\nIn Safari 6, repeating this experiment, type Safari 6 in the integrated address bar. You'll keep seeing Safari 6 there, not the real URL.  This happens even if I go to the search site first and type the keyword into their search.  It only happens for your choice of the search engine in the Safari preference.  So let's say, I pick \"Yahoo\" and go to \"Google.com\", then it shows the real URL.  \nIs it possible to bypass this annoyance and get Safari 6 to reveal the actual URL?\n\nA: Safari maintains this information internally, but I've only been able to make it divulge the actual URL by enabling the web inspector (Option-Command-I) after you have enabled the Debug menu at the bottom of the advanced tab in Safari Preferences (Command-,). You can of course drag the URL out of the search window to get a link (instead of copying which just copies the visible search terms).\nYou will see the Full URL under the Location disclosure in the bottom right corner of your screen. The only good part of this is the text is copyable once you've navigated and selected it. It might be possible to write a Safari extension to perform this copy, but I have not found one to do this yet.\n\nAs provided by Arjan you can also make a bookmark and use JavaScript to retrieve the URL. \njavascript:(function(){window.location.href=window.location.href.replace(\"search?\", \"#\");})()\n\nYou might also be interested in gDirectLinks or it's more fully fledged sibling LinkThing which change the way Safari renders google search terms and works with URL handling from google.\n\nA: A really simple way I discovered to get around this is this (btw, I'm using Safari 7.1):\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Select all\" in the address box\n\n*Open a new Safari window\n\n*Click in the address box and \"paste\"\n\n\nThis gives you a URL (a really long URL) you can then drag off and save into a folder, paste elsewhere for reference, etc.\n\nA: Install the SafariKeywordSearch extension, and this behaviour goes away, but most importantly, you'll get the ability to set other search engines than the ones AAPL has been payed billions to include.\n\nA: I've created a Safari Extension: Get URL to solve this exact issue. It opens a nice popover with the full url, already selected and ready for copying and pasting.\nI hope you enjoy it!\n\nA: Right clicking the title of the window shows a menu of the URL you're on. You can't copy from here, but you can SEE the url at least.\n\nA: OMFG I discovered the answer to this by accident.\nJust select the text in the search/URL field and Copy it. That's all. The Google url, not the search text, will be copied to the clipboard. Simple as that.\nEdit: As a commenter pointed out, this works only after you have executed the Search.\n\nA: The workaround I use doesn't require downloading extensions and it creates a URL you can copy: in Safari Preferences > Advanced, check \"Enable Develop Menu\". In the Develop menu, click Show Page Resource. A grey screen appears on bottom third of your monitor, and at extreme right, under \"Location\", copy the URL.\nAnother, less sprightly, workaround: add the Google Search Results page as a bookmark, say within a special bookmarks folder created expressly for this purpose (I named mine \"Safari Detours\"), then right-click to copy the URL from the bookmarks page.\n\nA: It seems that Safari 6.0.1 fixes this.\nTo quote the release notes:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Fix an issue that could cause the Smart Search Field to interpret URLs as search terms.\n  \n\n", "Q: Does the Microsoft Intellipoint software work with Mountain Lion? I've been using the Microsoft Intellipoint software with Leopard, Snow Leopard, and currently Lion, to provide mouse cursor movement that feels a lot more like Windows. Has anybody tried installing this on Mountain Lion, and found it to be compatible or not?\n\nA: Microsoft has released a new version of Intellipoint: version 8.2. Although the site says it supports support 10.4 to 10.7 only, I tested it and it seems to work on 10.8. All bugs and problems that I know about have been fixed since version 8.0.\nHere's the download link:\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/wireless-mobile-mouse-4000-limited-edition\nor\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/wireless-mobile-mouse-4000-studio-series\nAlthough 3 version has different name but it also run with same driver\n\nA: I believe I have discovered the real reason why this happens and the cleanest work around (version 8.2 doesn't fix this for me).\nWhy this happens:\nThe issue for me was tracking speed (and mouse acceleration!) reverting to the OS X default and not using Intellipoint settings. After trying to learn AppleScript for 2 hours to hack around the issue and adjust my sensitivity settings through an automated script to adjust the preference pane, I remembered there should be a process called 'MicrosoftMouseHelper' loaded for the Intellipoint to work, and I noticed it wasn't running on a clean reboot. This, I believe, is the issue as it must be run to activate the hardware and software features for the mouse. (Use Activity Monitor to check yourself if this is running on clean boot and it likely won't be running, or if you already opened the preference pane as per @tquang's suggestion, kill MicrosoftMouseHelper process and see the mouse behaviour change). When you open the Microsoft Mouse preference pane, the above process starts and stays in memory after you close the system preferences, hence why you only need to open the preferences then close, and why @tquang's approach works rough-enough.\nHeres my cleaner/less-intrusive solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder.\n\n*Navigate to: /Library/PreferencePanes/.\n\n*Right click on \"Microsoft Mouse.prefpane\".\n\n*Select Show Contents.\n\n*Navigate through Contents > Resources.\n\n*Leave the above open, and now open System Preferences.\n\n*Select Users & Groups.\n\n*Click on your user, and click Login Items.\n\n*Go back to your Finder window, select the file \"MicrosoftMouseHelper\", and drag this into the login items area on the right-hand side of the login items page (in the System Preferences window).\n\n*Intellipoint settings should now be loaded at login, overriding the default OS X settings for pointer speed, scrolling, and buttons.\n\n\nA: Looks like it's not fully compatible. When you reboot your Mac, Intellipoint doesn't start when OS X boots. You need go to System Preferences and open the Intellipoint preference pane. I'm waiting for Microsoft release new version of the utility.\nA few links with the same issue on the MacRumors and InsanelyMac forums.\nI've got a temporary solution: add the \"Microsoft Mouse.prefPane\" to the login item list (in System Preferences > Users & Groups). The full path of the preference pane is /Library/PreferencePanes/Microsoft Mouse.prefPane.\nThis gets inconvenient, however, as whenever you login or reboot, you'll need to close System Preferences after it automatically opens.\n", "Q: How to fix Terminal error DYLD_ environment variables being ignored because main executable (/usr/bin/login) is setuid or setgid?

And then Download the Command Line Tools from XCode.\nThat fixed it for me...\n\nA: I had this happen to me on 10.8.2 and just logging out then back in fixed it.\n", "Q: Strange failure with Spaces? Over the course of my ownership of a MacBook Pro running Lion, I've had an extremely odd bug occur somewhat sporadically. It rarely occurs, but when it does, the following effects become apparent:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can no longer switch spaces using trackpad gestures, but I can using keyboard shortcuts.\n\n*Dashboard becomes inaccessible without using Mission Control; only the main spaces can be moved through with the shortcut keys.\n\n*When moving between spaces, all easing is gone from the transition animations. The animation seems more like it was in Snow Leopard and prior.\n\n\nI really have no idea what could possibly cause this, and even though it's only happened to me four or five times, it's quite annoying since I use Spaces a lot. The only way I've found to resolve the problem was restarting the entire OS. Has anyone else had this happen to them? If so, do you know of a fix?\n\nA: I eventually managed to find the issue by poking around in console. I got the following error messages:\nDock: kCGErrorIllegalArgument: _CGSFindSharedWindow: WID 6963\nDock: kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSGetWindowTags: Invalid window 0x1b33\nDock: kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSGetWorkspaceWindowGroup\nDock: kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSGetWindowOwner\nDock: kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSGetWindowBounds\nDock: kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSSetWindowListSystemLevel: Failed\nDock: kCGErrorIllegalArgument: _CGSFindSharedWindow: WID 6963\nDock: kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSGetWindowTags: Invalid window 0x1b33\nDock: kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSGetWorkspaceWindowGroup\nDock: kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSGetWindowOwner\nDock: kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSGetWindowBounds\n\nWhile I'm not positive what causes these, sure enough, restarting the Dock using killall Dock did the trick.

Is it possible to set Spotify as the default program when the \"media\" keys (play, pause, previous, next, etc) are pressed on the Mac keyboard? \nFor the most part when Spotify is open, the \"media\" keys work fine. But every once and a while iTunes will pop up when you hit them. It'd be a lot nicer if you could just specify that Spotify is the default program when these keys are triggered, as oppose to iTunes.\nIf it matters, I'm using Mountain Lion.\n\nA: After looking around for a while I finally found https://github.com/zsszatmari/MagicKeys\nIt is not specific to Spotify but will let you select any application to launch when a media key is pressed.\nThere are only 2 small issues I see with it (and one is also an issue with the default iTunes behavior).\n\n\n*\n\n*It opens the application with any of the 3 media buttons. While this is what the original question requested, it is not the default behavior for iTunes. iTunes only opens when you press the play/pause button (not the back/forward buttons). Ideally this would be an option that the user could select.\n\n*It does not start the media playing after the application is launched. The same thing is also true with iTunes by default but it would be nice if you just had to press play once to open Spotify and start playing music rather than to press the key, wait for the app to start and then press the key again.\n\n\nA: The software Beardedspice provides a user-friendly approach to prioritizing Spotify for your media keys. It runs in the background and gives you a few simple settings in the Mac menu bar. It just works.\n\nDownload and installation\nIt can be downloaded and installed directly from the Beardedspice homepage, or by using e.g. Homebrew:\nbrew install --cask beardedspice\n\nNotes\n\n*\n\n*It is compatible with macOS Monterey.\n\n*Ensure the application is given sufficient privileges in Security & Privacy in the System Preferences.\n\n*Beardedspice supports controlling a vast amount of media players.

It will always play Spotify since it's open in the background and not itunes. \n\n\nA: Adding on to what @sjg said, you could have Spotify opened at startup (presuming that you don't care for iTunes to open at startup) so that you can have the media keys work with Spotify right from login. Again, this is only a workaround and not really a full solution, but if you want it to be opened at startup, go to Spotify>Preferences and scroll down to \"Open Spotify automatically after you login to the computer\" and select Open automatically.\n\nA: As suggested in the comment by Beau Smith, the app BeardedSpice do an amazing job! Not only for Spotify but also for a lot of other services (Netflix, Youtube, SoundCloud, etc.)\n\n\nBeardedSpice is a menubar application for Mac OSX that allows you to control web based media players and some native apps with the media keys found on Mac keyboards. It is an extensible application that works with Chrome (Canary, Yandex, Chromium) and Safari, and can control any tab with an applicable media player.\n\n\nA: I find this problem happens for me inconsistently, so I use this fairly destructive approach when it happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up \"Activity Monitor\", which can be found easily using Spotlight\n\n*Select either \"CPU\" or \"Memory\" from the pills at the top of the dialog\n\n*In the search box, top right, type: itunes\n\n*\"ituneshelper\" is what you're looking for. Find it, click on it, then select \"Force kill\"\n\n*Accept the confirmation\n\n\nSpotify also has a helper running. My guess is that it depends which one loads first. \n\nPermanent solution\nPer comment below – you can simply remove it from your login items: \n\n\n*\n\n*Search for 'Login Items' in System Preferences\n\n*Select itunes helper\n\n*Click [-] button\n\n*Restart your mac\n\n\nA: You can go to your Applications library and manually delete iTunes.app in the terminal using:\nsudo rm -rf /Applications/iTunes.app\nWon't automatically make Spotify your default media player but iTunes will no longer exist on your computer. \n\nA: Is better going to User (Settings ->Users and Groups) and then click on \"Startup items\" and disable ituneshelper. By this way you don't need to kill the process every time you switch on the device.\n\n\nA: a solution that worked for me for Mojave was to remove the execution bit from iTunes:\nsudo chmod -x /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS/iTunes\nand optionally add the media player in question under\nPreferences -> Security & privacy -> Accessibility\n\nA: Here's how this should work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pressing a media key on your keyboard should send a message to the currently-active application, if it's one that supports media keys\n\n*If not, the most recently-active media-key-supporting application should be sent the message\n\n*If no application is available, open the default media-key-supporting application (e.g. iTunes, but configurable)\n\n*Each media-key-supporting application should have an opt-out in its preferences\n\n\nIt doesn't seem that difficult to me, yet this is one of those small usability flaws of OSX that sits on a pile of things that just serves to make the overall experience sub-par.\n\nA: I've created an easier implementation of Per's answer with BetterTouchTool.\n\n*\n\n*Download BetterTouchTool (it has a 45 day free trial, afterwards its a one time purchase of $9).\n\n*Create a keyboard shortcut, bound to the Play/Pause key.\n\n*Optional: if you wish to open Spotify when its closed, add the following action (Apple Script (blocking)):\n\ntell application \"Spotify\"\n    if it is not running then launch\n    set frontmost to true\n    activate\nend tell\n\n\n\n*Add an Apple Script (async in background) action:\n\nusing terms from application \"Spotify\"\n    if player state of application \"Spotify\" is paused then\n        tell application \"Spotify\" to play\n    else\n        tell application \"Spotify\" to pause\n    end if\nend using terms from\n\n\nA: Lifehacker ran an article about this very problem a while back for Snow Leopard. http://lifehacker.com/5531707/free-your-macs-media-keys-from-itunes-grasp \n\nThe tricks we used before were far less than ideal, requiring you to start up QuickTime in the background, or do some serious hacking to system files within iTunes.app. NoMitsu has created a one-click installer that patches the remote control daemon, the app responsible for managing the media keys. Just download the patch and double-click on it. After entering your password, your media keys will be free from iTunes' grasp.\n\nI presume you have already tried this.  As I recall the media keys will control the last program that was active so if Spotify was the last media app you had open (and is currently open) then the media keys will control that.   Hope this helps you out.  \n\nA: I'v had this problem for years and in my case it goes beyond iTunes. When working in Keynote or another application that \"claims\" the media keys, controlling Spotify (or other music players) won't work.\nBut now I've finally solved it!\nQuite a long process but here goes.\nBinding Media keys to one Media player, and that player only:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to system preferences > Keyboard > and select \"Use all F1, F2, etc keys as standard function keys\". (this will disable all quick controls like brightness, and volume)\n(To enable those again:)\n\n*Download \"Karabiner\"\n\n*Choose \"Change F1..F19 Key & Function key...\" > \"Change F1..F19 Key\" > \"F1..F12 to Functional Key\"\n\n*Enable all but \"F7, F8, F9 to music Controls\" (unless you'd like to map any other keys to features of your choice) (now the brightness etc. should be working again)\n\n*Download and install FastScripts\n\n*Open Automator and create a new Service\n\n*Change \"service receives selected:\" [text] to [no input]\n\n*Add the \"run apple script\" action to the main screen\n\n*Enter and save the following three apple scripts (for Spotify, but I'm sure this works with some other media players to) to the folder [your user]/Library/Scripts:\n\n\n\ntry\ntell application \"Spotify\"\n    playpause\nend tell\nend try\nreturn\n\n\ntry\ntell application \"Spotify\"\n    previous track\nend tell\nend try\nreturn\n\n\ntry\ntell application \"Spotify\"\n    next track\nend tell\nend try\nreturn\n\n\n\n*\n\n*And finally in In FastScripts, go to \"Script Shortcuts\" and set F7, F8, and F9 as shortcuts for your scripts!\n\n\nEasy as that! =)\nEDIT: Karabiner does not yet work with Sierra, but a pre-release called \"Karabiner Elements\" does the trick.

They control the Music app instead.\n\nA: there is an option on the keyboard to either use the traditional F1, F2, etc keys, or the special features. Maybe you have selected the traditional mode.\n\nA: Something that works most of the time for me is simply rebooting the program in question.\nSay for instance Spotify is not playing nice with the media keys (i.e. they don't do anything when you have Spotify open). I usually quit Spotify and restart it and when it reopens the media keys automatically work again.\nObviously, this is less than ideal and definitely doesn't do anything to make Spotify the 'default' media key program, but it does act as a soft reset for the keys which can help until a better answer is created by Apple / Spotify.\n\nA: Posting this April 3rd, 2020. Working perfectly well for me.\n\nI am using shpotify with skhd. To install shpotify (command line interface for Spotify):\nbrew install shpotify\n\nNo need to worry about Spotify API if prompted - that is optional if you want to be able to choose tracks from the command line; play/pause, and volume settings work out of the box. Then installing skhd (amazing shortcut manager for OSX):\nbrew install koekeishiya/formulae/skhd\nbrew services start skhd\n\nThen head over to the file ~/.skhdrc which is the configuration file for skhd and add the following:\n# Spotify\nfn - f8 : spotify pause\nfn - f11 : spotify vol down\nfn - f12 : spotify vol up\n\nThis will map your FN+Play/Pause, FN+Volume Up, and FN+Volume Down to Spotify specifically. Pressing any of those keys while Spotify is closed will automatically open it.\nThe added benefit of using this method is that you can control Spotify when it's playing both on your computer or an external device (i.e. Google Home), and allows more flexibility when pausing Spotify (i.e. when you open a video on the browser and OSX automatically maps the Play/Pause to the video as opposed to music playing in the background by Spotify). \n", "Q: iTunes intermittent freeze/crash: how can I diagnose the problem? I have an ongoing but intermittent problem with iTunes. Sometimes after starting iTunes or after plugging in an iPhone, iTunes will cause my Mac to become unresponsive. I'm having trouble reproducing this problem, and it doesn't seem to leave any traces in the system log. How can I figure out what's causing this problem?\nHere are the symptoms: When I start iTunes, it loads and appears to be functioning normally for a few seconds, but then my Mac becomes unresponsive. The trackpad still moves the on-screen pointer, but input, as far as I can tell, is completely ignored. \nDoesn't work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Attempting to quit or force-quit. Nothing happens: keyboard input ignored.\n\n*Clicking on anything: clicks are ignored.\n\n*Removing the iPhone, when the freeze happens after plugging in the iPhone - the system does not react to the removal of the device, and it still appears in the iTunes sidebar.\n\n\nInteresting features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mouse/cursor still moves, but clicks just \"vanish\" - nothing happens on click.\n\n*If music or other media are still playing, they continue to play - sometimes to the end of the current track, sometimes for less (long tracks). \n\n*If an external monitor is in use when the freeze happens, and is unplugged after the freeze, the Mac doesn't do the fade-to-blue-and-redraw thing. It doesn't react to the monitor going away. \n\n\nWhat I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Removing iTunes library and rebuilding from the XML file does not fix the issue. \n\n*Making sure that I'm the owner of all of the relevant iTunes files (single-user computer) - no change.\n\n*Restarting computer: the problem never appears on the first launch of iTunes after a restart. \n\n\nWhat puzzles me: \n\n\n*\n\n*Sometimes it happens with just iTunes, sometimes it happens with the iTunes + plugged-in iPhone combination. \n\n*Why is mouse movement still visible even though the rest of the system has gone utterly brain-dead?\n\n*Why is there nothing in the system logs that I've been able to see?\n\n\nSetup details:\n\n\n*\n\n*Early 2011 Macbook Pro, Snow Leopard 10.6.8.\n\n*iTunes 10.6.3\n\n*iPhone 4, iOS 5.1.1\n\n*Music folder on an external hard drive (a few hundred gigs of music in the library, and the onboard hard drive is an 128GB SSD, so this is non-negotiable)\n\n\nCurrently, when I run into this problem, I have to reboot by holding down the power button until the Mac powers down, then start it again. This is deeply sub-optimal. Is this a known problem in disguise with a known fix? If not, how can I narrow down the problem, how I can I get more information about what's actually happening during the crash? The nature of the problem means that no crash report is generated, so that's a difficulty. I've tried watching top, ps, and lsof whilst trying to reproduce the problem, but since I don't know what I'm looking for, I can't really get any help from the information they provide. \n\nA: I would simply say that your Library is corrupt for some reason. As your library is a virtual reference lookup to your actual music files, if it has a problem it is possible that it will either give you issues at program startup or perhaps when you add something to your library as it will read the reference file and encounter issues when trying to add to it.\nI first of all tried all the obvious, Disk Utility repair, permissions, deleted and reloaded iTunes, etc. However all of that will still use the original Library file so it won't solve the issues so many are having with iTunes.\nThe simplest yet time related route is to rebuild your library. What this means is that you need to create a new one, and import all your content again. It may take you 30 minutes and for your computer 10 hours.\nAs it's your library that's corrupt and not the actual files/file structure that is the problem you will be able to import all of your music again together. About 95% of your albums will be kept together although in some occasions with downloaded albums their reference name will not match that of the official release so it may be separated and in need of the artwork but neither is a big take to sort out. It's the same deal with your movies.\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit iTunes\n\n*Hold Alt and click iTunes again\n\n*Select new Library (don't worry your old one is still there and will not be deleted)\n\n*Then you can start to rebuild. You can always go back to your old Library by closing iTunes, holding Alt and clicking on iTunes.\n\n\nTo select which library to open - you will see that in your Music/Itunes folder there are now two libraries and the xml library file is in the sub folder for each for you to select if you cant find it. Give yours a simple name when you create it such as 'ITunes Library 2' that way you can search for it too if you can't find it.\nThe only issue with this method is having to backup your iPhone/iPad or other device in your old Library as it can only be sync'd with one library. However, once you are happy with your new library you can Erase your device and sync it with your new Library.\nWhen you erase your iPhone for example, it will only wipe/erase the content (Music, Movies, etc.) it will not delete Apps, Messages, Bookmarks, Photos, etc.\nI hope this helps, as it not only sorted my iTunes issues for good but also made my iMac a lot faster in general as iTunes is not struggling and does not crash any more.\n\nA: If this issue occurs again, it should be reported to Apple for investigation.\n", "Q: How to decide what to store in iCloud For Mac OS X, what criteria should I use to decide whether to store a document or file in iCloud or on my local machine? What are the tradeoffs and considerations to be most aware of?\n\nA: iCloud document storage is best used for documents you're going to need to access for things that you're likely to need in a single application, but on multiple Macs. If you're likely to need to access a document from in multiple applications, or don't need it synced between multiple Macs, local storage makes more sense.\nThe documents you store in iCloud from a Mac are essentially tied to the application you save them with. For example, if you create an image in Photoshop and save it to iCloud, you won't be able to later view it in something like Preview without first opening it in Photoshop, then copying it to another location that Preview can access (either local storage or in Preview's iCloud storage).\nThe iCloud vs. Reality section of John Siracusa's Mountain Lion review on Ars Technica goes into good detail on this as well.\n", "Q: Can I get the original Mac font Chicago on a Mountain Lion Mac? I'm running Mountain Lion on a mid 2011 MacBook Air.\nI'd love to be able to set type in the oldest Macintosh system font, Chicago. Is this font included anywhere in OS X Mountain Lion? If not, what is the most recent Macintosh operating system to include the font, and can the font be purchased anywhere?\n\nA: Oddly, the Krungthep font currently supplied with OS X, while a Thai language font, has the latin characters drawn in Chicago.\nI found this out here while trying to figure out why the Krungthep chosen by a non-technical friend for the headings of her website design looked so familiar...\n\nA: An update for El Capitan:\nOS X 10.11 has a new Disk Utility that can't do what the current best answer suggests. We need to adjust what we do on Steps 3 and 5.\nOnce you've used Unarchiver to unpack the .bin file from Step 2, jump into Terminal (I'm going to assume basic familiarity with how to use the terminal) and issue the following the command:\nhdiutil convert System\\ 7.0.1.smi -format UDRO -o sys7.dmg\n\nThis will give you a mountable image for System 7 named sys7.dmg. Mount it and copy the Fonts.image out to, say, your desktop. We need to do the same thing again on this fonts file.\nhdiutil convert Fonts.image -format UDRO -o fonts.dmg\n\nVoilà! We now have a modern, mountable disk image called fonts.dmg. All System 7 fonts will be inside, including Chicago. Double click a font to install it on your computer.\n\nA: You can get a copy of a TrueType Chicago font here:\nhttp://www.fonts101.com/fonts/view/Standard/21727/Chicago\n\nA: The last version of the OS to use this font as default was System 7.\n\nFor Mac OS 8, Apple decided to discard this wonderful part of their\n  brand’s identity, and commissioned David Berlow of the Font Bureau to\n  design Charcoal.\n\nApple actually released System 7 for free download here. Conceivably you could load up System 7 in an emulator like Sheepshaver and get the font out somehow. Or unpack the system images provided by Apple, though I don't know which software you would need for that.\nApple abandoned Chicago as of OSX, as evidenced by the outrage here. Locally, I can buy an original iMac running OS 9 for 50 EUR. So you could buy one of those and transfer the font :-)\n\nUPDATE: extracting Chicago from System 7\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the System 7 disk image from Apple for free here\n\n*Unpack System 7.0.1.smi.bin with \"The Unarchiver.app\" (free on the App Store here)\n\n*Convert System 7.0.1.smi to a dmg image using Disk Utility using the menu item 'Images > Convert'\n\n*Open the resulting System 7.0.1.smi.dmg and get the Fonts.image inside\n\n*Convert Fonts.image to a dmg using Disk Utility\n\n*Open the resulting Fonts.image.dmg\n\n*Enjoy your retro goodness.\n\n\n\n", "Q: How do I enable PHP on Mountain Lion OS X 10.8?

I'd like to pin a URL to the Dock and have its icon be something meaningful or recognizable.\nBy default, the icon/shortcut is a generic spring icon, and in Yosemite it shows a globe.\n\n\nHow can I create or modify a docked URL shortcut to be the site's favicon or an image I choose?\n\nA: *\n\n*Move/drag the shortcut to the Desktop first\n\n*Find an image (on the web, etc.) Open it in Preview, Select All, and Copy.\n\n\n*Open Get Info on your shortcut on the Desktop. Select the current icon at the top left of this window.

Ever since I upgraded from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion, my MacBook Air doesn't wake from sleep when I touch my trackpad. I have to physically click it in order for it to wake up, which can be quite annoying sometimes since I'd rather not have to press the physical button underneath the trackpad (and it's easier to just tap it when your finger or move your finger on it, as if you're moving the cursor around on the screen).\nDoes anyone know why it doesn't work the way it did on Snow Leopard?\n\nA: In Mac OS X 10.7, aka Lion, Apple removed the ability to wake the Mac by moving the mouse. This stopped knocks to the table and pets moving the mouse accidentally from waking the Mac.\nBy clicking or pressing a key, you are being more deliberate about your intention to wake your Mac. Ideally it should help avoid waking your Mac accidentally and save a little power.\nAs ever, this improvement benefits some users more than others.\n\nA: I don't know if this is a setting which has changed, but my first thing to try with any hardware or sleep issues like this is to reset the System Management Controller (SMC). I find this usually fixes all sorts of sleep, boot and external monitor issues. \nOn my 2011 13\" MBP these happen at least once every couple of months.\n\nA: This has always been the behavior for me.  Sometimes even clicking doesn't do it, and I have to press the spacebar.  Note that tapping the trackpad is generally not considered a click in this context.  Even if the screensaver is running, tapping the trackpad just undims the screen, without closing the screensaver. \n", "Q: How to expand windows fully? When I click the green plus icon in any window, I would like it to expand to the full size of my monitor, instead of having to drag the corner of the screen.\nI have seen paid ($10+) tools that do this.\nIs there some sort of Terminal hack or free program that would do it?\n\nA: RightZoom is what you want (scroll down to the bottom of the page or use this MacUpdate link)\n\nThis free tool fixes an inconvenient behavior of green Zoom button in Mac OS X. It will always expand windows on a full screen instead of strange resizing.\n\nAnother one is BetterTouchTool. You might not think of BetterTouchTool as being a window manager, but it has window snapping (as seen in Windows 7). Take a look:\n\nCinch also does the same thing, but it costs $7.\n\nA: I might have found a solution for Sierra and higher:\n\"Hold Option and double-click on any window corner.\"\nCredits (which includes some other nice tricks): https://www.techradar.com/how-to/advanced-macos-sierra-windows-mangement-tips\n\nA: In OS X Yosemite, just click the green plus (+) icon while holding Shift (⇧) + Option (⌥) keys.\nOr double click on the window's title bar while holding Shift(⇧) key (this won't work if System Preferences > Dock > Double-click a window's title bar to minimize is checked).\nUPDATE\nHere are proofs for those who voted down my answer before even trying if it works:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.raymondcamden.com/2015/03/22/osx-yosemite-tip-maximizing-windows\n\nIf you Google for this, you’ll see lots of people recommending holding\n  alt-shift before clicking the green button.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Make the green full screen window icon on Yosemite maximize windows\n\nIn order to maximize the window so that it fills the visible window\n  content, use:\n⌥ + Click on green icon\nIn order to maximize the window both in width and height to the\n  current desktop for applications like Google Chrome use:\n⌥ + ⇧ + Click on green icon\n\n\n\n*\n\n*How to change the default behaviour of the fullscreen/maximize button?\n\n...by doing:\n⌥ + ⇧ + Click on green or outer right icon (plus\n  icon)\nI can maximize a window in both width and height to the current\n  screen.\n\nI tried it and it works on my MacBook Pro 13\" Retina with Mac OS X Yosemite.\nSUMMARY\nThere is no need to buy or hack something to do the following things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fullscreen mode: click on green icon\n\n*Resize window to it's content: ⌥ + click on green icon\n\n*Maximize window to screen size: ⌥ + ⇧ + click on green icon\n\n\nA: I use Divvy for this sort of window management, it was the one that closest fit my mental model. It uses shortcuts to allow changing window size and position and it allows you to resize to a grid using the mouse very quickly.\nYou can define system wide shortcuts, or shortcuts which are only available when the Divvy window is open.\nThere are a lot of alternatives to Divvy, most are also commercial, but ShiftIt is free and open source, but with a more limited set of features.\nWhat it does do is allow you to have a system wide shortcut for putting the window into a corner or vertical or horizontal halves or full screen. \nThe source is available on github, but if you aren't comfortable compiling the code yourself, or dont want to install the 4GB of Xcode needed to do so, I have uploaded my compiled version of ShiftIt to filedropper.com. \n(All the usual warnings and none of the guarantees apply. I have not tested this code, apart from running it for a few days to try it out for personal use. Please be careful when downloading software from random people on the internet. Look both ways when crossing the road.)\n\nA: I use Spectacle it's free and open-source. A compiled version is available from the AppStore, versions for OS X 10.6 and 10.7 can be downloaded from the Spectacle GitHub site. You can change the various keyboard shortcuts that allow you to snap the window to any side or corner of the screen as well as maximize the application window to fit your screen.\nThe default shortcuts are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Center / ⌘ + alt + C \n\n*Fullscreen / ⌘ + alt + F \n\n*Left Half / ⌘ + alt + ← \n\n*Right Half / ⌘ + alt + → \n\n*Top Half / ⌘ + alt + ↑\n\n*Bottom Half / ⌘+ alt + ↓ \n\n*Upper Left Corner / ⌘ + control + ← \n\n*Lower Left Corner / ⌘ + shift + control + ← \n\n*Upper Right Corner / ⌘ + control + →\n\n*Lower Right Corner / ⌘+ shift + control + → \n\n*Left Display / ⌘ + alt + control + ← \n\n*Right Display / ⌘+ alt + control + → \n\n*Top Display / ⌘ + alt + control + ↑ \n\n*Bottom Display / ⌘ + alt + control + ↓\n\nA: Well, I'm using Snow Leopard and to my knowledge there is no way to trigger a fullscreen mode with just the click of a button.  Unless something new has to come to light that I don't know of, you will simply have to drag the window and make it as large as you want by using the grabber on the bottom right of the screen.\nKeep in mind, though, that it depends on the application.  Some applications have  a full screen mode.\n\nA: To fully expand the window (both height and width): ⇧ Shift ⌥ Alt and click the green button on the top-left corner.\nTo maximize the window (only expand the height): pressing ⌥ Alt and click the green button on the top-left corner.\n\nA: ShiftIt will do this, with its Maximize feature:\nhttps://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt/issues/72#issuecomment-3727710\n(The version 1.6 binary linked to from this page is more reliable than the default build from the default git hub page, and has an additional feature: it will move windows between monitors.)\n\nA: In OSX Yosemite, you can achieve this by holding the ⌥ option and click the green (+).\n\nA: I have used Moom for a long time with much satisfaction. It is a paid application. It expands the green icon to allow for various window arrangements, and can be customised. It also will swap windows between displays. I wish I'd known about these free options before, though.\n\nA: On El Capitan on a 2015 Mac Book 13\" screen\nI clicked on green icon top left - work page becomes a little bigger.\nThen at bottom left selected 150% Size.

The product page for AirPlay states that advanced hardware acceleration is used to make mirroring to an Apple TV possible. The footnote shows that only Mid 2011 Macs and newer can use this function. The graphics capabilities of many recent Macs are very capable, so has anyone figured out what exactly is being done or required of the hardware to do this sort of network mirroring? (Might the GPU be handling the encryption for the OS or some other very new feature of a graphics system?)\n\nA: There's some misinformation going on at the moment on what exactly is needed for Macs to support AirPlay Mirroring. The cultofmac article correctly states direct access to the GPU for H264 encoding but this is supported on Macs older than the one's listed to support AirPlay Mirroring. So this isn't the main requirement.\nThe really important feature to make AirPlay Mirroring work is Intel's QuickSync baked into Sandy Bridge CPUs. And only the newer devices listed by Apple have that. So the main requirement for AirPlay Mirroring is a specific CPU feature, not GPU.\n\nA: From what I understood, it requires H264 encoding capability at hardware level.

In Mountain Lion, many of the day-to-day apps like Preview, TextEdit have been upgraded with some very useful features. (For instance, you can now insert a page into a PDF document using your scanner in Preview - see here, and pinch the trackpad for zooming in on to a document - see here). However, as far as I understand, these apps are free, and features like these are features of the app themselves, not the OS.\nIs there anyway in which I can replace/upgrade individual apps in Lion, without having to install it as a whole (preferably as a dual-boot config!) ?\n\nA: No.  Apple does not distribute these apps individually.\nEven if you copy them from one Mountain Lion system to a Lion machine, they are very likely to not work as they are relying on system level framework (or functions in these frameworks) that won't be available in OS X before ML\n", "Q: How to decrease the delay to drag and drop files into windows via Dock? The Dock (as of 10.7+) allows you to drag files over an application icon, invoking application exposé which allows you to drag the file over the window of choice and drop it in where you want.\nThe delays set for these actions are rather long for me.\nI already checked the Secrets prefpane, no luck.\nIs there a hidden preference to speed them up?\n\nA: In the Finder's preferences, there is an option at the bottom of the General pane for “Spring-loaded folders and windows” that seems to control this. You can adjust the delay using the slider there, and also (as it notes) press the spacebar when dragging an item to invoke Exposé immediately.\nIt's not a hidden preference (in the sense that you need defaults to get at it) so much as a preference in a somewhat unexpected place. ;)\n", "Q: How can I restart on a schedule, if network users are connected? I want to schedule a nightly restart of my OSX media server, but I routinely have other machines in the house connected to this machine remotely (since it's also our TimeMachine system, iTunes library, etc.)\nIt's trivial to set a scheduled restart, but it always fails if other users are connected, which in my case they always are.\nHow can I schedule a nightly restart of this machine, that will automatically kick any connected users, quit all apps, and restart?\nAlso, what effect will this have on the formerly-connected applications like iTunes, TimeMachine, etc.?  Will they simply see the machine again after restart and resume operations?  Or will it cause them to get into a bad state?\n\nA: You can use a third party tool like Power Manager to ensure the restart completes. The tool's web site includes has a recipe that shows how to schedule a restart.\n\nPower Manager will ensure your Mac restarts, even if other processes or applications try and block the process:\n\nPower Manager is multiple user savvy and first deals with the logged\n  in users. The following steps happen within each logged in user’s\n  session:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Running applications are sent a quit request.\n  \n*Running applications are given time to quit.\n  \n*If an application has not quit in time, the application is force quit.\n  \n*With all the applications quit, the user is logged out.\n  \n  \n  Once all the users are logged out, Power Manager then asks Mac OS X to\n  shut down. You can watch this sequence play out in the transcripts of\n  the Mac’s system.log file.\n\nWith regard to formerly-connected applications like iTunes, and Time Machine; these applications will be quit and no data will be lost. Time Machine will resume backing up where it was stopped - it was designed to be interrupted.\nAfter restarting, previously connected Macs will need to reconnect and be asked to resume playing any shared content. No harm will come to them.\nIf you are watching a streaming film while the media server restarts, the film will stop and you will probably need to resume the film playing. A smart player might seamlessly handle the dropped network connection but that is outside of the control of the media server.\nDisclosure: I created Power Manager.\n\nA: Well, you could use cron to submit a sudo shutdown -r now command, but it's hardly elegant. I am in the same position, with users with mapped drives stopping the server rebooting. \n\nA: The command syntax was provided in the previous answer, but was not quoted.  Here it is:\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\nHere's a recommended way to execute it periodically: Schedule a task in MacOS\nKeep in mind: sudo requires authority, and authenticating within a script is generally unsafe.  \nDo this instead: Using sudo in a batch script\n", "Q: Add attachments to Calendar Is it possible to add attachments (like photos) to Calendar events?\nFor example, I gathered the flyer of an event I want to attend.

It appears that attachments can be added to local calendars only. It may also be possible with calendars synced with remote servers, if the server supports it (but that's just a speculation, I don't know if such servers exist)\n\nA: Yes, just click on \"Add Attachement\" in the Calendar Entry Detail.\n\n", "Q: What techniques for disk, volume and file system management are possible with OS X, but troublesome within Disk Utility?

My internet service provider has its own broadband portal and the session lasts only 12 hours after which I need to relogin.  While relogging the download of the Mountain Lion gets interrupted because the connection resets.\nI'd like to take my Mac to my friend's house for increased net speed. Will the download be resumed or do I have to start downloading all the way from the beginning?\n\nA: I was just searching for that, and No, you can't, it has to be downloaded in one time only. If you paused; it'll restart from the beginning.\nThis is the source from Apple Discussions:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4139031\n\nA: First, I'd seriously consider getting a better connection if possible. I don't see how your provider gets away with calling something that can't download 4GB in 12 hours 'broadband'.\nMountain Lion downloads from the Mac App Store can't be resumed.\nAs such I see two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take your Mac to a store/friend and get them to download it for you.\n\n*As a last resort, download it from unofficial sources which support resuming.\n\n\nA: If it takes that long, ie; you probably live in a country with slow broadband connections, go to an Apple Store and they will download and install it for you.\n\nA: I accidentally hit pause on my Mac Mini and it did pick up from where it had paused, only about thirty seconds went by before I realized I had paused it, I was right in the middle of the download.\n", "Q: Will I be able to re-download Mountain Lion by using my redemption code in the future? Apple gives a free upgrade to Mountain Lion if a new Mac is purchased in a nearby time frame.\nI got a redemption code. \nWill I be able to download Mountain Lion again next time, for example in two months from now, will I need it?\n\nA: Once you have purchased something in the App Store, you can always download it again without paying (This is the same on the Mac App Store and iOS). You will see it in your 'purchases' tab in the Mac App Store.\nSo once you use your redemption code, you have 'purchased' it, and can install it whenever you need it.\n\nA: Yes, it just appears in \"Purchases\" tab of Mac app store so you can download it on any mac computer until you use the same Apple Id\n", "Q: AirPlay Mirroring shows scrambled output in guest account When using Mountain Lion's AirPlay Mirroring in the guest account, all I see on an Apple TV is some flickering scrambled image. \nSometimes I shortly recognize some text, but that seems to be from the screen of another account. However, I am only using Mirroring in one account at a time.\n\nHow can I use AirPlay Mirroring in the guest account?\n\nA: This is a bug in 10.8.\nTo be more precise: after using AirPlay Mirroring in one account, one needs to log out that account before one can use Mirroring in another account on that same Mac. The same applies if you happen to use Mirroring in the guest account first, and then leave that account logged in and try to use Mirroring in some regular account. \nAlso, any text you might recognize is not from the current screen of the other account, but from the last Mirroring session of that account. The current screen might already not show that text anymore.\n(It's fine to log in again right after logging out; apparently some cleaning up is done when logging out. I've reported it, but unfortunately used Apple's feedback form, rather than the developer Bug Reporting. Hence, I cannot see the status of my report.

Really, really 100% Flash free. This is fine for 99% of content out that I access, but sadly there are some videos that I still cannot get to without Flash.\nI do know about the popular post by Gruber, however I'm not interested in installing Chrome because (1) I hate the heavy handed way Google forces itself into your system with its hidden daemons etc. and (2) you're still installing a Flash client on your system. I don't want a Flash client, period.\nI see that such solutions do exist for iOS. To name a few:\n\n\n*\n\n*iSwifter\n\n*Cloud Browse\n\n*Skyfire\nBut sadly no such options appear to exist on the Mac :( In fact iSwifter was promised to the Mac earlier but there hasn't been a peep about this since.\nWhat I'm looking for is some kind of web-based service either with a native Mac client app or simply a webapp that would:\n\n\n*\n\n*Allow me to render the entire site server-side in Flash and send me the video feed in some decent app or webapp (ala iSwifter), or\n\n*Have some server side scraper of the swf file that finds the reference to the actual .mp4 and passes that along to you (ala Skyfire).\n\n\nSo far the closest thing I've found to this is ClipConverter, but sadly its supported list of services, though decent, is nowhere near extensive enough to cover all the obscure websites that I use which all roll their own crappy swf wrapper around the mp4/flv content.\nExamples\nSome people are suggesting client-side-only approaches like ClickToFlash. These are good but the problem is that any particular Flash based video service / wrapper needs to be explicitly supported by it so by definition cannot catch 100% of all content, only a dedicated server-based Flash renderer like iSwifter can do that. Here are some concrete example videos that require Flash which most solutions don't handle:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.destructoid.com/let-s-get-physical-with-quantum-conundrum-232175.phtml\n\n*http://www.gamespot.com/deadlight-2012/videos/video-review-deadlight-6389587/\n\n*http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/6083-Inversion (this one has an HTML5 link but you need to pay to get in.

Thanks!\n\nA: I use ClickToPlugin, which converts some Flash videos to HTML5 (this has the added benefit of letting you download them by right-clicking and choosing Download Video). It works for YouTube, at least, and for the videos on the second and third webpages you linked (though not the first).\n\nA: Have you tried ClickToFlash and HUDTube? HUDTube works with 99% of the videos on YouTube, even the ones C2F misses.\n\nA: If you truly want to go flash free, then use Safari, possibly in conjunction with an extension like Youtube5, which should handle some embeds that don't do html5 properly. However you're never going to get 100% of videos working. For one thing, while a majority of \"flash video\" is indeed a flash app playing h264 video, some of it is in other formats that Safari can't handle, including some wrapped in DRM.\nYou have to make a choice - do you want zero flash, or do you want a way to watch all videos?

I'm the only user of my MacBook Pro 5,3 (mid 2009, Core2Duo 2.66 GHz, 4 GB RAM).  \nIs it worthy to turn on File Vault 2?  Any performance penalties considering my hardware specification? \nI'm running Lion (upgraded from Snow Leopard) and considering upgrading to Mountain Lion. \nWhat about my Time Machine backups? Should I preconfigure any thing?\n\nA: Do you run the risk of loosing your computer? Is the information stored on your computer of high value to other persons?\nIf your answer is no to these questions you should not consider using FileVault 2 as it has some drawbacks:\n\n*\n\n*The encryption happens on the fly. As your C2D processor does not support hardware accelerated encryption, your CPU load will increase. Newer CPU's like the Sandy-Bridge processors support that Apple ships support AES-NI instructions for hardware accelerated encryption.\n\n*Your I/O tasks will become slower for the same reason. Even witth AES-NI support the performance slightly decreases. But in your case the effect should be a lot bigger.\n\n*Auto-login is not possible with Filevault 2 enabled.\n\nTime Machine\nTime Machine does not encrypt backups per default. Even with FileVault 2 enabled. You will need to enable encryption with Time Machine. In Lion, FileVault 2 did not support encrypted wireless backups but work-arounds were possible. Mountain Lion supports wireless encrypted backups to Time Capsule.\n\nA: It's worthy, especially for a portable device. In case of theft you don't have to worry about someone getting access to your files. Even if you don't carry around the machine there's still the possibility of theft from your home.\nThere're basically no performance penalties noticeable. This would only matter if you do something like live video editing of 4K video or something. But in normal operation it's not noticeable. And the process of first encryption has become really user friendly by making it on the fly, meaning you can continue work on your machine while it encrypts everything in the background.\nAs for Time Machine, you should additionally encrypt your Time Machine backups to be fully safe in the home theft case. You do that from the TimeMachine options for your backup drive where you'll find a checkbox labeled \"Encrypt Time Machine Backup\".\n", "Q: iTunes - what playing now notifications \nPossible Duplicate:\niTunes track notifications for Mountain Lion \n\nI want to turn on iTunes notifications on Mountain Lion?\nAnybody knows how I can do this?\nGrowl dosn't work :/\n\nA: Enable iTunes track notifications in the Dock\nIn the terminal type\ndefaults write com.apple.dock itunes-notifications -bool true\n\nReference (with a lot of other great terminal commands):: nerdlogger.com\n", "Q: Show speed in Finder Copy progress window Is there a way to show more details in the Finder copy window?

I could do this by holding down the \"2\" and \"3\" keys upon startup. This no longer works since I have upgraded to OS X 10.8.\nIs there still a way I can force Mountain Lion to boot in 32-bit mode? \n\nA: No,\nMountain Lion only boots using a 64-bit kernel which does not support loading 32-bit kernel extensions.\nvia Arstechnica\n\nA: As you have a definitive no - here is a workaround that most people are pursuing in this case. Run Lion in a virtualized environment on top of Mountain Lion. The commercial products like VMware Fusion, Parallels and VirtualBox all might assist you until those applications can be updated or replaced.\nOf course, you could dual boot most hardware but a virtual solution might work longer term if you choose to upgrade hardware.\n\nA: I found on MacRumors a solution to this but I don't know the exact commands add it.  The user said 'Just add arch=i386 in to boot.plist and reboot.'\nI'm also trying to find a solution and do not want to run a VM for this purpose.

Naturally, PHP was pushed back to 5.3 from 5.4 that I previously had installed when my MacBook Pro was running Lion. I ran through the process downloading PHP 5.4, unzipping it (tar xf php5.4), configuring it (./configure with and without options), making it (make), running the make test (make test), and installing the make (sudo make install). When I ran configuration with options it did not allow me to make and when I ran without configuration options it failed to pass make test a few times (when this occurred I sent the information to Zend). When it did pass make test though, it said that it installed successfully, but when I would check the version (php -v) it still comes up with PHP 5.3. I've done this almost nine times with restarts and re-downloading the package every time; no sauce. Does anyone have any ideas what could possibly be going wrong? Any help on this issue would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I strongly suggest you use the package installer or use a full stack of configuration options when compiling, including the --prefix option so you know where the binary gets installed to.\nI can only guess PHP 5.4 installed itself into /usr/local/bin or somewhere else and didn't just overwrite the default binary in /usr/bin. And you seem to have not modified your PATH variable to prioritise the bin directory of /usr/local with e.g. PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\" in your .bash_profile. So, it's expected running php will still use /usr/bin/php and not /usr/local/bin/php.\nAlternatively, you could just symlink the new php binary to /usr/bin/php, (delete or rename the default binary before that):\nln -s /usr/local/bin/php /usr/bin/php\n\n\nA: I've installed MAMP and everything works fine.\n\nA: Have you tried installing it via Homebrew?\nAlso just found a blog post (you have to scroll down a bit to the Homebrew section) which is saying that the problem with compiling PHP might be because ML doesn't come with X11, but there's a workaround.\nActually, here's the relevant bit from the blog post:\n\nApple removed support for X11 in Mountain Lion. This means that\nanything that was linking to a library that was supplied by X11 would\nnow complain and die. This meant our custom compiled version of PHP at\nwork. dylibs were missing which prevented PHP from running and header\nfiles could not be found which prevented an update to PHP from\ncompiling.\nThe Homebrew folks saw it coming a while back. There are pull requests\nand changes in branches that deal with this issue. However the best I\ncan tell not all of that has made it in to master and its still not\nready to go.\nThere is a work around, and it relies on installing XQuartz to provide\nthe required X11 libraries. This may not be required for everyone, but\nfor those of us that run specific versions of software it means a\nheadache. In our case, for PHP, it meant that libraries required for\nfont and image handling were missing. And these are just the errors\nthat came up first. I’m not sure how many other things that X11\nprovided were waiting to error out should we have tried to link in the\nparts as we found the errors.\nFirst, download and install XQuartz. After doing that symlink it in to\nwhere Homebrew expects X11 to be. We had folder there, presumably left\nover from the upgrade.\n$ cd /usr\n$ mv X11 X11.bak\n$ ln -s /opt/X11 X11\n\nNow, since this was an OS upgrade all of the config and ini files have\nbeen renamed and replaced. This means that the Apache conf and PHP ini\nfiles needed replacing. Fortunately for us we had a custom Homebrew\nFormula that handled this portion of the environment for us. So we\njust had to uninstall and reinstall that Formula to re-configure\nApache and PHP how we had it. Your setup will of course be different.\n\n", "Q: How do I transfer my RSS feeds from Safari, now that it no longer supports RSS? I have hundreds of RSS feeds saved as bookmarks in Safari, but the latest version (6.0) has disabled RSS feeds, and suggests getting a dedicated RSS reader from the App Store:\n\nIs there a simple general procedure for transferring all of my saved RSS feeds from Safari to a new reader?\n\nA: After installing an RSS reader, any attempt to open one of your existing feeds in Safari should open the RSS reader. For most readers, (e.g. Reeder) this will cause the app to ask if you want to subscribe to the just-opened feed. Once you've done that for a feed, you can delete it from Safari. \n", "Q: How can I bring a window to frontmost without focusing it using Applescript in OS X 10.8 I want to bring a window (QuickTime for example) to frontmost, without focusing it.

I have an old but perfectly usable iBook G4 (1.33 GHz, 512 MB RAM, 40 GB disk). I am currently running Mac OS X 10.4.11 but I'm wondering what sort of update should it take.\nWhat is the most recent and recommended version to install in it?\n\nA: Leopard, 10.5, had some interesting features but I wouldn't recommend upgrading if you're comfortable with your laptop as is. There's a good chance that your iBook won't run 10.5.8 as smoothly as it does run 10.4.11. As far as I can tell, this is your only choice to upgrade because your iBook won't run 10.6 (Snow Leopard).\nThe only reason I can personally imagine wanting to upgrade is to get any security updates that were issued for the last 10.5 release (10.5.8) but weren't for 10.4.11. There were roughly two years in between the last Tiger release and the last Leopard release, but I'm not sure whether or not any security updates were released in that time.\n\nA: Internet browser and quicktime limitations are the only reason I'm going to upgrade to Leopard. \n", "Q: How To Fresh Install ML I'm having some problems with entering sleep and wakening, so I'm considering making a fresh installation of Mountain Lion.

You would then boot from it by holding ALT (Option) while rebooting.  When you boot into the USB stick, use Disk Utility to delete both the Lion and Windows partitions from your drive.\nAs for clean reinstalling Lion, since it came pre-installed, you would have to backup your hard drive and 'erase' it which would then prompt you to reinstall the OS.\n\nA: Or, if you have working (bootable) OS X on external (USB) Hdd, simply:\n\n\n*\n\n*Time Machine!!!

Is it safe leaving one inside a dark part of a very hot car, think 32°C / 90°F ambient temperature, plus sun and car effects. \n\nA: Macworld did some tests back in 2008 with heat ranges of the Macbook Air, http://www.macworld.com/article/1132216/mbair_temp.html. I wouldn't risk it though. You never know what could happen.\n\nA: Yes, the Apple tech specs page lists:\n\nStorage temperature: -13° to 113°F (-24° to 45°C)\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, when the outside temperature is 80°F, a parked car can reach 114°F in 30 minutes.\n(Unrelated to the heat, most car insurance policies don't cover theft of items left in a car, so it's probably a bad idea even if the heat was OK.)\n\nA: It would be fine to LEAVE it in the car, so long as the Macbook wasn't in use.

If I attempt to delete the parent directory I get a \"Directory not empty message\"\n\nA: If you look at this answer from Stack Overflow, you will learn that filenames on HFS must be in fully decomposed form, in which an accent on a letter is encoded separately from the letter itselves (and after the letter). In your case, the filename has somehow been snuck onto the filesystem in composed form instead, which confuses the filesystem to the point where it can see that the file is there, but still cannot find it. If Disk Repair cannot find and fix the problem, I much doubt that there is much you can do. There is an ancient File Name Encoding Repair Utility out there, but as it officially supports OS X 10.1 and 10.2 only, I would be rather hesitant about running it on a modern OS X if I were you. So your best bet is to hide the problematic directory somewhere it won't bother you.\n\nA: I had the exact same problem. Had a directory (on NAS) with special characters and tried to delete in OSX. First using Finder, then in bash command line. ls seemed to know the directory was there, but would say \"No such file or directory\" instead of listing the details. rm -rf on the parent directory would return \"Directory not empty\"\nAfter much googling and messing around with no success, decided try another OS. Was able to see and delete the directory with no problems from my Windows laptop.\n", "Q: Reverse SSH tunnel on the iPad Is is possible to set up a reverse SSH tunnel on an iPad?  \nI'd like to be to do basic nmap TCP scans and use some other tools that the iPad doesn't have on remote networks.

The dictation in Mountain Lion on my iMac does not record many of the words I speak.\nI cannot get it to make a paragraph, either on my desktop, nor my MacBook Pro.\nWhy does dictation on my MacBook Pro records my words fine but not on my iMac?\n\nA: If it's different between two machines, the most likely issue is the microphone. Are you using the built in Mic on the iMac? If so, try an external one. Also take into account any noise sources around your iMac such as fans, air conditioners, etc.\nThe other possibility is that you're just getting bad luck with the dictation service. Because it's dependent on Apple's servers, the results can be spotty if load happens to be very high. But if it's happening at different times of the day, chances are it's a microphone issue.\n\nA: Dictation in Mountain Lion requires an active internet connection because OS X contacts Apple servers in the background (the same as Siri uses probably). Is the internet connection on the troublesome Mac up and running?\n", "Q: App Store doesn't show Mountain Lion as installed After downloading, and upgrading to OS X Mountain Lion, the Mac App Store shows a \"download\" link for it; it doesn't show \"installed.\" Secondly, although I have downloaded it twice, it does not show between my applications.\nWhy does this happen?\n\nA: When you purchase Mountain Lion in the App Store, it will first download an application called Install Mac OS X Mountain Lion.app to your /Applications directory. When the download is finished you're automatically prompted with the following window:\n\nAfter that Mountain Lion installs and reboots into your Mountain Lion install. The installer application will be automatically removed - because most users won't need it anymore.\nIf you open the App Store, you're offered you to re-download Mountain Lion (hence the button says \"download\"), which could be useful if you wanted to create an install USB with the .dmg image.\nYou can verify if you have installed Mountain Lion by going to the menubar and click: Apple icon → About this Mac.

Dictation in Mountain Lion is a nice little feature that works great for me. However I often need to switch between dictation languages, so going through the System Preferences is way too many clicks for me all the time. That's why I wrote a little utility that sits in the menu bar, which lets the user switch dictation languages. The problem is: it doesn't really work. At least not without logging out and back in. \nMy utility changes all the plist files that should be necessary to change, these are:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.speech.recognition.AppleSpeechRecognition.prefs.plist\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.assistant.plist\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.assistant.support.plist\n\n(the last one actually just contains a BOOL value to turn dictation on/off)\nAs far as I can tell (and trust me, I've looked into it thoroughly!) these are the only files that are changed when changing the dictation language in the dictation preference pane. However when I change the language setting in my utility, and then trigger dictation, it sticks with the previous setting. So I suppose the dictation daemon(s) are not loading the changed file. No big deal, right? Just need to find the right daemons. Well, there are three main processes that seem to belong to dictation:\ncom.apple.assistantd\n\n(this seems to be the actual dictation daemon, which will also spam the console)\ncom.apple.assistant_service\n\n(not sure what this one does)\nDictationIM.app\n\n(this one renders the GUI for the feature, the little grey popup with the microphone)\nHowever, killing these (or, in case of assistant_service/assistantd, stopping and restarting them with launchctl), doesn't do anything.\nThe changes that I make to the plist files are valid and good, because when I restart the computer or simply log out/back in, the new setting is used when triggering dictation.\nIs there anything I've overlooked? Any plist that saves the locale? Or some cache file that I didn't find? I don't think so, because I really turned the whole system upside down during the weekend looking for it.\nAny idea which (other) daemons are responsible and should be (re)started after making a change to the plist files?\nThanks for any pointers in the right direction!\nOh, and if I can get this thing to work, I'll release the utility as freeware.\nEDIT: As promised, I'm releasing the utility as freeware.

So this is useless.\nI'm currently annoyed by the fact that syncing with itunes will contanstantly remove contact photos from my iphone.\nWhat methods of sync will preserve contact photos and work with google's cloud services?\n\nA: The best way is to stop syncing contacts via iTunes and do it all over the air:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your Mac: go to Contacts.app (or Address Book.app if you're not on ML) > Preferences. Under Accounts tab, tick the checkbox \"Synchronize with Google\" and add your gmail info.\n\n*On your iPhone: setup a Google Exchange account in Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendards. Google has a good guide for that.\n\n\nAfter that all your contacts are synced over the air and iTunes will stop syncing those when you attach your iPhone.\n\nA: Google has made it easier to do this by implementing CardDAV for iOS5+.\nHere's the link: http://support.google.com/mail/answer/2753077?hl=en\nFor iOS 6 and prior: Basically, rather than setting up a Google Exchange account as described in kremalicious's step 2, you'll do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mail, Contacts, Calendars >>\n\n*Add Account... >>\n\n*Other >>\n\n*Contacts: Add CardDAV Account\n\n*Server = google.com; user name = [fullEmail]; pw = [gmailPw]; desc = [optional].\n\n\nIt worked great for me on an iPhone5 with iOS 6.1.2.\nFor iOS 7: Check the link above.

Open Console (under Applications/Utilities), select All Messages in the log list, and type \"backupd\" into the filter bar. If you scroll back up to the time of one of these full backups, there may be a log message explaining why it backed up so much.\n\nA: You could try using BackupLoupe to inspect exactly what has been copied in each backup. I find I have to exclude things like my web browser cache to keep the size of the backups down. \n\nA: I suppose that Time Machine keeps those backups longer, while the incremental backups are kept just for the last day; so TM doesn't have to consolidate hourly backups into a single one to keep a long history. But this is just a guess.\n", "Q: How do I do Time Machine backups for multiple computers? I have 4 Macs that need TimeMachine backups; they all run Snow Leopard, and it's unlikely that they will be upgraded to Lion/Mountain Lion anytime soon. \nCurrently, they are all backed up to a bunch of drives set up in a RAID array, but it causes me a fair amount of pain every time a drive fails (which happens somewhat frequently).\nIs there an easier way to do this? I'd prefer not to use a Time Capsule, since we need to have a NAS anyway, and I'd prefer to only have one set of technology to maintain.\n\nA: You question is a bit unclear. How do you back them up to the NAS currently?\nTime Machine can backup to network drives On supported NAS machines so you need to check with your NAS vendor for the particulars. The other option would be to have one of your Macs host all the Time Machine backups.\n\nA: You should be able to configure multiple computers on the same time machine following the Time Machine Preferences wizard. On the TimeCapsule/NAS, it keeps different folders with the host names of the backed up computers, so it won't mess up things. \n", "Q: Does Mountain Lion remove headers in /usr/include?

When I close the lid, instead of completely sleeping, it simply moves what I'm doing to the secondary screen.  Please explain?\n\nA: After Lion, closing the lid puts the machine straight into clamshell mode rather than putting it to sleep, if an external display is connected and the laptop is connected to AC power. I'm not aware of any way to change this.\nSee Apple's page on clamshell mode behaviour, comparing 10.6.8 and Lion: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3131\n\nA: Apparently, you can disable this by simply disconnecting the power cord. I was having the exact same issue, and I read the link provided about closed clamshell mode. It stated that a requirement was the power cable, I unplugged mine, and voila!\n\nA: That's the way it works (also on Lion); closing the lid means for your macbook, that you want to use the external monitor as primary screen. \nYou can press CMD+ALT+EJECT to trigger the sleep; or you can press CTRL+EJECT to display the dialog Restart/Sleep/Cancel/Shutdown.\nOr, you could try to assign the primary monitor to the external monitor following this guide.\nI didn't try that, but I suppose that being the external monitor the primary one, closing the lid may not been intended as \"use the external display as primary one\", since it is already; so I suppose, it should intend the message differently. Let me know, I can't try now since my macbook is running some updates :)\n", "Q: Equivalent for FinePrint FinePrint is a program that allows you to print multiple pages of a document's printout per physical sheet by shrinking the printouts, and merge several documents' printout into a single print job.\nIs there an equivalent for OS X?\nI asked this question on superuser three years ago: https://superuser.com/questions/17466/mac-equivalent-of-fineprints-ability-to-merge-print-jobs . w00t's answer of AppleScripting plus PDFLab sounded too complex. siva's answer of using the layout configuration doesn't address how to merge printouts together. My answer of using preview wasn't too bad, but it seems to be a little fiddly. You'd have to save each printout to a separate PDF, and then manually merge each document into a single document. By contrast, with FinePrint, each new printout is merged by default into a FinePrint file that you're working on.\nAre there any better alternatives?\n\nA: I use the standard print dialog: under Layout you can select how many pages you want on a sheet of paper, their order, and wether they are surrounded by a frame:\nhttp://content.screencast.com/users/vilmoskoerte/folders/Jing/media/e286324f-535f-4108-84f5-35b02090c598/00000151.png\nThis seems to serve at least one of the requirements you state above (\"print multiple pages of a document's printout per physical sheet\").

Only some things will interpret a tilde in the PATH. The which program does not expand the tilde, so which chmod told me that /bin/chmod was the chmod on the path, but bash does expand the tilde, so it tried to run the other chmod (which did nothing.) Meanwhile, sudo does not expand the tilde so it worked, and gave the impression of a permissions problem.\nResolution: when adding subdirectories of your home directory to your PATH, use $HOME instead of ~.\n", "Q: Can sudo's annoying message be removed from Mountain Lion 10.8.0?

I recently purchased a Crucial M4 SSD 256GB for my Macbook Pro Early 2011. I bought the transfer kit that includes the USB to SATA cable. After I initially format the new SSD to be Mac compatible, I will use SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner to clone my HDD to the new SSD. \nNow my question is before I install the SSD internally in my Macbook Pro, will SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner, clone everything I need for it to work?\nDo they copy the OS and literally everything my old HDD had?\n\nA: SuperDuper! doesn't create the Lion Recovery partition on the new disk so Carbon Copy Cloner is a better choice for cloning to an empty drive.\nIf you use SuperDuper, you'll need to reinstall Lion afterwards to create the recovery partition.  It's a non-destructive reinstall so all your data and applications are preserved (although it still sounds scary to me).\nhttp://www.shirt-pocket.com/forums/showthread.php?p=31750#post31750\n\nA: Yes, both SuperDuper and Carbon Copy Cloner are designed to make fully bootable clones. Like you, I've performed this procedure (with older versions of both apps) on MacBook Pros onto external SSDs, for use as replacement drives.\n\nA: I have used CarbonCopy for similar purpose and it worked fine. Just a note, maybe you should consider making a clean install if you  got the time, instead of cloning. Always good to make a clean start.\n", "Q: Will Mountain Lion make an older computer run faster or slower? Performance/responsiveness is a common concern with new software, especially on older machines. In general, upgrading from Snow Leopard (10.6) to Lion (10.7) wasn't too bad, but now Mountain Lion (10.8) is adding even more features such as Notification Center. \nWhat will be the performance impact of Mountain Lion on Macs which are nearing the lowest end of the system requirements?\n\nA: I have a MacBook that I bought in 2009 (2.4GHz Core 2 Duo, 4GB 1067 MHz DDR3), I started with Leopard and had the following experience with upgrades over the past 5 years:\n\n\n*\n\n*Snow Leopard - noticed a performance improvement\n\n*Lion - noticed significant slow down of all OS X features/applications, was seriously considering buying a new MacBook\n\n*Mountain Lion - massive speed improvements immediately after upgrade.  Start-up time for all applications has improved by a factor of 10, especially for Safari and iTunes.  I used to click an application icon and wait for 10 to 30 seconds, now it opens immediately.  Obviously, Apple OS X engineers have worked hard to tune and optimise 10.8 for all hardware, even the old the stuff.\n\n\nA: Anecdotally, Mountain Lion seems to actually be faster than Lion. There aren't that many new features in Mountain Lion, which means Apple's engineers had more time to analyze and tune its performance. We know, for example, that they specifically optimized Safari scrolling to make it smoother than it used to be. The Versions feature is also faster (or rather, it does more of its work invisibly in the background).\n\nA: Apple made some improvements to the graphics subsystem, including the OpenGL stuff that can boost performance by up to 10 percent, depending on what you're doing.\nSince Snow Leopard, Apple has been relying much more on using the graphics cards in non-traditional roles, including OpenCL, so this sort of performance boost won't just be limited to programs that render 3D. Any app that uses Core Image will get advantages from increased graphics performance, for example Pixelmator, which makes use of the GPU for image editing.\n\nA: I own a 20\" iMac early 2009 with 2 GB RAM and I noticed a significant increase in booting time from previous Snow Leopard.\n\nA: As a proud owner of one of the slowest Macs that are able to run Mountain Lion (I have an early 2009 model, 2 GB Ram, 2.24 GHz (?) Intel Core 2 Duo and a NVidia 9400M), I have to say that, in contradiction to what I expected, everything is faster, especially when switching desktops. Switching desktops would sometimes lead to some frame drops in Lion, but everything is pretty smooth in ML. \nThis also applies to other system animations, including the lock icon animation in system preferences, which I have had problems with since Snow Leopard. This might also apply to games, but I haven't really tested that yet. As said by almost everyone, Safari is notably faster to, no scrolling problems whatsoever. \nAnd last but not least is XCode, which builds faster than I remember and doesn't really seem to slow my Mac down anymore.\n\nA: On my 2010 MacBook Air, I never upgraded to Lion and went directly from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion, and speed/performance is pretty good. I don't see anything that is much faster (except Safari), but I don't see anything slower either. \nChrome lags scrolling sometimes but I guess that's just a Chrome issue. QuickTime makes my computer slow though when recording the screen (it didn't do that in Snow Leopard).\nSafari is a lot faster, especially with the scrolling.\nI don't think Mountain Lion would slow up your machine, and as others have said Apple has had more time to tune its performance so if anything it is probably faster than Lion. Animations are relatively faster/smoother too and I haven't seen anything laggy (except when using QuickTime's screen recorder). \nI was also worried that Mountain Lion would slow up  my computer, but it didn't. :)\n\nA: I have an early 2008 iMac with 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo and 4GB RAM.  I have been running lion since it was released last year. I upgraded to mountain lion yesterday and am very happy with the upgrade because, surprisingly, it has actually increased the speed and performance of my computer.  The speed I lost from Snow Leopard seems to have returned with Mountain lion.\n\nA: Faster - I have three macs and I've always found Lion to be quite a bit more resource heavy, hence slower, than snow leopard (enough to be annoying at least). But on installing ML I've found the two machines I've installed on are actually running better than on Snow Leopard.\n\nA: I have a 2010 MacBook Pro which I upgraded from Snow Leopard. Over the last month everything is running as fast as it was until I run iPhoto. Then the fan starts running overtime, the battery goes flat quickly and everything is slow to respond. I have to reboot before the computer recognizes that iPhoto is no longer running. It is also very hot at this time. iCloud on iPhoto is very slow and I have had to force quit more than once.\nOn my 2011 24inch Mac which I upgraded from Lion, it is running just as well as before, which was new.\n\nA: Faster. \nI have a Mid 2007 iMac 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo with 4GB RAM. This is the oldest iMac model that can officially run Mountain Lion (according to Apple's tech specs). \nI upgraded the first day and haven't noticed any slowdowns so far. Performance actually seems faster in Finder, Mail, Preview, etc. \nSafari stands out the most in terms of noticeable speed improvements.\n\nA: Faster.  I upgraded my work MacBook Pro 15\" Late 2011, 2.2GHz i7, 8GB RAM, 256GB factory SSD, from 10.6.8 to 10.8.2, and am very happy with overall performance.\nPhotoshop CS6 screams on this thing.\nRemember too that OS upgrades aren't irreversible; use the still-awesome Carbon Copy Cloner or similar to make a complete and bootable snapshot of your system as-is; upgrade; decide if you like the new features and performance..\n\nA: MacBookPro2,2 | Late 2006 | 15'' 2.16 Ghz Core2Duo (A1211)\n\n\n*\n\n*RAM upgraded to 2 GB,\n\n*HDD upgraded to 500 GB, WD Green WD5000BEVT-11ZAT0 (silent,green… slow!)\n\n\nPerformance & responsiveness:\n\n\n*\n\n*10.5 Okay\n\n*10.6 Improved clearly to predecessor, very performant! - Optimal OS for that machine.\n\n*10.7 Unresponsive, lots of beachballs, and 10-90 (!) seconds later you get the sudden accumulated UI feedback for the queued user interaction stack.\n\n*\n\n*Seems to be not a CPU issue, but rather too little RAM and the then stronger utilized virtual RAM on that slow HDD together being the performance bottleneck!\n\n*10.7 also uses more animations — of which many can be deactivated, btw — but they seem to be no problem for the GPU ATI Radeon X1600 128 MB in this machine, mostly fluent, a few frame drops every here and then, but not disturbing.\n\n*Particularly bad app example: Google Chrome is laggy as hell on 10.7. On 10.6 ~5 idle tabs consume about 1-3% CPU, switching is instant, whereas on 10.7 the same current Chrome, even with cleared caches/extensions/etc, lags as hell and utilizes about 30-50% CPU!\n\n\n\nUpgradability:\n\n\n*\n\n*RAM can be upgradeable to 3GB\n\n*A SSD could be added internally to the 1.5 Gbit SATA port\n\n*or into the ExpressCard slot (max capacities marketed are 256GB, and they have lower transfer rates than the current SATA SSDs).\n\n\nConclusion:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clearly virtual/physical RAM are the issues! With my slightly upgraded configuration (2GB RAM, 500GB HDD), the performance in 10.7 is miserable, I cannot recommend it!\n\n*Maybe with the maximum pimping possible for this machine (3GB RAM, fast internal SATA SSD), 10.7 could be performant. Any experiences? Appreciated!\n\n*For now, I will downgrade from 10.7.5 to 10.6.8\nagain.\n\n", "Q: How do I get rid of the clock in the menu-bar in Mac OSX? I want to get rid of the clock menu display in Mac OSX. How can this be done?\n\nA: Now it's in System Preferences -> Dock & Menu Bar -> Menu Bar Only (section) -> Clock\nHowever, as far as I can see, you cannot hide it anymore, that can be only done for the other items. What you can do, however, is to minimize to a small analogue watch, which takes minimum space\n\n\nA: Go to -\nSystem Preferences → Date & Time → Clock and Uncheck the show date and time in menu bar.\nDone.\n\nA: The easiest way is to hold down the ⌘ Command key on your keyboard and drag it out of the menu bar (you can also re-order the menu bar icons by holding the ⌘ Command key and dragging them around around, if you didn't know).\nBut, you can also go to   → System Preferences → Date & Time → Clock and uncheck \"Show date and time in menu bar\" if you'd rather do it that way.\n\n\nA: Hold ⌘ and drag it out of the menu. If date and weekday are shown, they will also be removed.\nAlternatively, you can disable and customize the clock in: System Preferences → Date & Time → Clock.\n", "Q: How can I enable Trackpad tap-to-click for the login window in OS X 10.8? In older OS X versions, this used to work just fine:\ndefaults write /Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences com.apple.mouse.tapBehavior -int 1\n\nIt would enable tap to click for built-in MacBook Trackpads for the root user, which would also affect the login screen. There are similar commands to enable it for Bluetooth-based Magic Trackpads as well.\nUnfortunately it doesn’t seem to work in OS X 10.8 anymore. Is there some other way of doing this in Mountain Lion?\n\nA: Turns out you can add this as a function in the Terminal:\nsudo defaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad Clicking -int 1\nThat worked for me, thanks to these guys - http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1218257\n\nA: I've had mixed results with enabling it for the login screen between my macs.\nHere's how I have gotten it to work:\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences (as an admin user) -> Users and Groups -> Login Options\n\n*Click the lock and enter your admin credentials\n\n*Next to Network Account Server click Edit (or add, what ever comes up if you don't have a server already set up) and then click \"Open Directory Utility\"\n\n*Click the lock again and reenter your credentials\n\n*In the menu bar, click edit and then click \"Enable Root User\"\n\n*Set up a password for the user, and then log out of your current user\n\n*At the login screen, you should have a \"Other...\" option next to your users.

It worked fine on my Mac Mini 2012, but it didn't seem to work on my MacBook Air 2011. The thing that I can think of primarily is that the MacBook Air's trackpad is built in and connected via USB, whereas the Mac Mini's trackpad is bluetooth.\nWhy does this matter, you ask? Did anyones else notice that the Terminal command that was used to change the system default to having Tap to Click on seems to store the setting in an entry that references AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad?\nIf thats the reason, then that would be why some people report the terminal command works and others say it makes no difference.\nI'm going to dig more in this, I wonder if there is a similar AppleUSBMultitouch.trackpad entry somewhere...\nEdits:\n\n*\n\n*Just confirming, I connected my Bluetooth Trackpad to my MacBook Air (it is surprisingly difficult to remove a trackpad from bluetooth preferences on a desktop mac by the way) and I can Tap to Click on the login screen with the bluetooth trackpad, but not the built in one.

I have retina MacBook Pro with 256GB and a 1TB external HD.\nThat external 1TB hard drive I want to use for several things, one of them is to backup my system.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to partition using Disk Utility the 1TB external HD, so that I can use the external HD for some other things?\n\n*If so, what is the size of the Time Machine partition I need to create?\n\n\nA: You can make the partitions any size you want. The larger you make it, the more backups you can save. TM deletes the oldest backups when it needs more space. You can also define what you backup in TM options. I don't like the methodology, but it takes the approach to back up everything. \nYou have to exclude things for which you don't need backups. For example, you may not want to back up the System itself. You may not want to backup some apps - where you can reload the installers. \nBasically, you want to backup only stuff that you don't want to lose. So documents, images, music, work, etc.\nIf you have a 100GB of that stuff, you may want to make a 200GB partition. Then, other than a full backup of this data, TM has 100GB to make incremental backups of things you create or change.\nI hope this helps. From your question, it appears that you know how to partition the disk so I did not go into that. Let us know if you need more on that.\n\nA: You don't need to partition it! Time machine will manage itself within its own folder, leaving the rest of the drive up to you to use, free of need for partitions! Seeing as your MacBook drive is only 250 GB, and probably even less of it is full, time machine won't take up much space on the back up drive.\n", "Q: How can I use my Apple earbud mic with the internal speakers on my Macbook Air? When I plug my iPhone headset into my Macbook Air, the operating system recognizes both the headphones and the microphone. As a \"side-effect\" it disables the internal speaker and microphone.\nIs there a way that it only disables the internal mic, but keeps the internal speakers functioning? What I would like to achieve is that the sound coming in from the external mic is played over the internal speakers. LineIn doesn't help me (yet), because the internal speaker gets disabled.\n\nA: You can solve this problem physically with an extension cable.\nCheck the tip of the extension cable (the male end) for the number of rings. If it only has 2, it is only recognized as a pair of headphones. The third ring carries microphone audio which you'll see on the end of the headset cable.\n\nA: Just a suggestion: If you use an external USB microphone instead, you don't have that problem (I know, it's not exactly an answer to your question).\n\nA: Press the Alt key while pressing the sound icon in your menubar.  From here, you can select the microphone and output devices separately.  You can also do this from the \"Sound\" setting in System Preferences.\n", "Q: spaces and dual monitor: separate setup for each monitor? I have two monitors and I would like to handle the virtual spaces separately on each. I.e. changing the space on one monitor shouldn't change the space on the other. (I wonder why this isn't even the default because it seems to me like it makes more sense.)\nIs there any way to do this?\n\nA: It's not the exact answer you were looking for in the Mac OS but it is an alternative. \nYou can try TotalSpaces at http://totalspaces.binaryage.com/\nIt's been the only thing close to what you are looking for.\n\nA: On Mavericks, you can go to System Preferences -> Mission Control and check \"Displays have separate spaces.\" This will accomplish what you want to do.\n", "Q: iCloud tasks do sync with Gmail I upgraded to Mountain Lion, use an iPad and iPhone. All syncs effortless over iCloud. Just bought an Android phone (Ic sandwich) and want to use Gmail for TASK syncing. But step 1 is iCloud to Gmail sync (and then Gmail to phone). Contacts and Calendar work well this way. In other posts about iPhone/Gmail syncing is mentioned that Task syncing does not work. Is that also true for iCloud/Gmail syncing? (all my switches are on in iCloud for Gmail syncing).\n\nA: This won't work at the moment. Problem is that Google doesn't expose the tasks calendar in their sync procedure since many years, neither over Exchange nor CalDAV. You can only sync tasks into Google's cloud by using an app which directly communicates with Google Tasks (i.e. gTasks for iOS, GTasks for Android). This is the only way to sync Google Tasks over different devices & systems.\nFurthermore, iCloud tasks can only be synced between the Mac & iOS versions of the Reminders.app at the moment so there is no other app which is able to communicate with these tasks. Therefore, it's not possible to get your tasks out of the Reminders.app, including syncing it to another service.\nFor now you would need to decide on one service and stick to it on all your devices. And this would be Google Tasks because you can't access iCloud reminders from Android.\nBut: in the future, it should be possible to sync iCloud reminders down to Android with SmoothSync for Cloud Calendar which says \"iCloud reminders are not synced yet\" in the current release notes.\n", "Q: How to enable remote (mobile) user at login time? I used to be able to login with my Active Directory Credentials at boot time.\nBut after the upgrade to Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) I can't see the remote login anymore. I have to log in with a local account and then logout in order to be able to log in against the AD.\nAny clue how can I make remote login available every time?\n\nA: I am seeing this issue after an upgrade today and adding the machine to Active Directory. It then occurred to me that my FileVault setup is causing this; FileVault 2 is full disk encryption, so the local account \"unlocks\" the drive and allows access to the configuration necessary to allow network users to log in.\nMy guess is this is part of the design/implementation of the encryption, if you have that enabled. Disabling FV2 may allow the login process to work with network users. I need to do more testing.\n", "Q: How to install Windows 7 Bootcamp using iso file (without USB/DVD)?

Actually just having Windows in a VM might be sufficient for you depending on your needs.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open the ISO File\n\n*Find the 'boot' file\n\n*Click the 'bcd' program\n\n*Wait 3-7 Seconds, A Window should appear.\n\n*Partion the Disk.\n\n*Complete!\n\n\nEnjoy Windows or Linux!\n\nA: Try erasing your main macintosh HD drive get a windows install disk install it onto the new empty drive.\n", "Q: How to write on FAT32 and NTFS from Mountain Lion? What is the best free software for OS X Mountain Lion for enabling write support for FAT32 and NTFS?\n\nA: At the moment, the only free way for NTFS write access without using abandoned software is using NTFS-3G along with FUSE for OS X. There's a guide for that in the FUSE for OS X wiki.\nIf you need NTFS writing a lot you might be better off using Tuxera or Paragon, both commercial but more faster and more bulletproof solutions.\nAs pointed out in the comments, there's no write restriction for FAT32 volumes in OS X.\n\nA: Try NTFS-FREE, works for me on ML:\nThis program allows MacOSX to access Microsoft NTFS formatted harddrives connected by USB port. A modified version of the original Linux code, this program is packaged as a easy-to-use installer so that normal users can install it without hassle\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/ntfsfree/\n\nA: Fuse4x + Ntfs-3g works on OS X Lion. All freeware.\n\n*\n\n*Install Homebrew.\n\n\n*In Terminal, type brew install Fuse4x.\n\n\n*Next, type brew install ntfs-3g.\n\n\n*Type brew info fuse4x-kext .

Enter the 2 lines of code separately after the line \"To replace the default Mac OSX automounter:\" .\n\n\n*A restart may be prompted.\n\n\n*Done.\nAll the best.\n\nA: As for me I use Paragon NTFS for Mac. Firstly, it is very fast, secondly, I can rely on it and I'm sure that it won't corrupt my files. Yes, it is commercial with 10-day trial but it is worth spending money. Moreover, it is cheaper than Tusera NTFS!\n", "Q: Why can't I control environment variables via /etc/environment? Google search reveals that \"/etc/environment\" can be used in OS X to set global environment variables (like JAVA_HOME etc, in key-value pairs).

There exist other options to accomplish similar results though.\nAdditional paths\nAdditional paths can be added in /etc/paths.d by creating a text file there listing one path component per line (e.g. sudo echo /usr/local/superbin > /etc/paths.d/superbin).\nOther environment variables\nAs more or less everything is controlled by launchd these days global environment variables can be specified directly in /etc/launchd.conf as described in this StackOverflow answer.\n\nA: Another solution for feeding launchd, and a discussion of the approaches in the StackOverflow answer mentioned, is provided at superuser by yours truly.\n\nA: You can use /etc/environment on OSX Yosemite, but you need to set up the daemons slurping the file into the environment at start up yourself.\nSee this stackoverflow answer for helpful and rather extensive details. \nWarning: In order to go with the answer above, your /etc/environment needs to look different to yours.

Speak Notifications is set to OFF but it still will break mid paragraph and say \"new notification from...\" or \"new text message from...\" then I have to start the reading all over again.\nThis seems like a bug to me. It's especially annoying when the block of text is huge and can only be voiced in entirety.\n\nA: I use Voice Over all the time and if I understand it correctly the setting for Speak notifications in the VO settings is just to speak the notificatons when the screen is locked. Unfortunately the only way to have it not speak individual notifications is to turn each one off as there is no way to all notifications on or off at once. Hopefully ios 6 might remedy this with the do not disturb setting that is supposed to be included.\n\nA: On an unmodified version iOS 5 you cannot set the voiceover function to have priority over notifications. \nIf you don't mind jailbreaking your phone, you may have some options to confiugure a \"do not disturb\" type functionality. This modification on cydia by Rob Melkhior seems to fit your needs, but I have no experience with it.\nHopefully your bounty will attract additional attention if someone has first-hand experience with this modification.\nShort of a jailbreak, your only \"out of the box\" option is to disable notifications either when you don't want to be interrupted or entirely.\n", "Q: What is the (external) keyboard shortcut to lock my screen with the screen save Which keys can I press to bring up the locked screen save while I walk away for a few minutes?\nI have an external keyboard (MS Comfort Curve 2000) thru a multi pc switcher box so I have ctrl-cmd-alt keys but no option key and everything I've tried so far doesn't work.\n\nA: Open System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> App Shortcuts.  Then click on the plus  sign under the white box that has the different options in there.  Name it 'Sleep' and give it the ⌘⌥F12 command (cmd + opt + F12).  You can set it to whatever you like but most keyboards already map F12 to the eject key so if you get a different keyboard it may work already by default.  Remember to also change your settings to require your password after a set time after going to sleep.  Hope this helps, I searched for awhile to find out how to do this and couldn't find any good answers.\n\nA: You can use Control + Shift + Eject to put your display to sleep but also to lock your screen. If you don't have an Eject key, you need to use an Automator based workaround to assign your own shortcut. Alternatively, you can set a Hot Corner for the screensaver to start in System Preferences.\nFor the locking to work, you have to tell OS X to require a password immediately after sleep in System Preferences > Security & Privacy:\n\nWhen this is set, the above key combo will lock your screen and a password is required to unlock it.\n\nA: If you're up for using an external program, Karabiner-elements makes this super simple. \nI've installed it and imported PC-Style Shortcuts, which maps it to Win+L. \nBig benefit of Karabiner is that it's flexible enough that you can enable/disable this on a per-keyboard basis (I keep the defaults for my Mac keyboard, and use PC style on my external \"Windows\" keyboard). Also, you can enable-disable individual rules, or create your own shortcut.\n\nA: A bit out of the box but this could work:\nIf you have an iPhone or iPad you could set up iCloud and find my mac, iPhone, iPad.\nboot up the find my iPhone app on your iDevice and lock your mac from there while you walk away.\nOr if your not afraid for some apple scripting and you have a bluetooth enabled mac you could use this script to lock your mac upon bluetooth disconnection. ( which also should work with an non apple phone ) more info about the scripting can be found here: Lock and unlock a Mac using Bluetooth detection\n\nA: Richi Jeffery provided a great answer to this, but that puts your computer to Sleep, which means it takes a few seconds to wake up when you return.  You can do the same but do a Lock Screen instead which wakes up instantly when you return.  Also on the laptop keyboard, the Lock Screen command is Ctrl+Shift+Power.  The closest to that on my Windows Keyboard is Windows+Shift+F12 so I've used that.\nHere's Richi's answer edited with the changes:\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts.\n\n*Click on the plus sign under the white box that has the different options in there.\n\n*Name it \"Lock Screen\" and give it the Cmd or Windows +F12.

One of the major features in Mountain Lion is the ability for almost all programs (certainly all the pre-installed ones and any newer MAS based apps) to store the files that they create and/or edit in iCloud.\nI think this is a great thing on the whole, and I will be using a lot for certain apps from now on.  Ignoring the argument about (for example) having a txt file that you can only open in Textedit because it is in the Textedit ubiquity container for example, I think it's a good system for those files that are not inherently truly portable between apps.\nAnyway, my question is that whilst I like the system, I cannot necessarily totally trust it (yet).  I am concerned about the following scenarios, some short, some possible longer term.\n\n\n*\n\n*What happens if my internet connection dies and I cannot contact iCloud\n\n*What happens is iCloud suffers an outage\n\n*What happens is iCloud loses or corrupts my documents\n\n*What happens if someone gains access to my account and deliberately deletes things\n\n\nThese are just some scenarios that could cause me to lose my data.  Previously with iDisk, at least you could keep a 1:1 local copy of all your stuff.\nNow, I am aware that cached copies of the documents are located at ~/Library/Mobile Documents/..., but from my understanding these files are just the latest versions that the computer knows about, and it's possible that other computers have more recent versions etc, and that also sometimes what you have is just the metadata, with the actual data waiting to be transferred.  I'm not sure it is safe to call that a canonical copy for backup purposes (or even that it's safe to open anything in there directly), and anyway it looks a horrible old mess in there and it's barely possible to work out what is what, made worse by the fact that you can see all your iCloud stuff in there on your Mac, even the iPad app data for which there is no Mac app version:\n\nIs there any way to do any or all of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Force iCloud to complete any downloads so that you can take a point in time backup\n\n*Backup those files (I am presuming that the above folder is not excluded by Time Machine, so this could be simple (but a specific 'certified' local copy like iDisk used to provide should be ok)\n\n*Safely navigate and use the files within the backup for emergency access to files and folders\n\n\nIn short, if I don't trust iCloud, what can I do to feel safe that my data is secure.\n\nA: I discovered recently that TimeMachine backs up all iCloud data. As long as you use TimeMachine, it is safe to use iCloud. If you want to recover your old (accidentally) deleted files, simply open Pages.app for example in the iCloud view. Then, you can just browse through your file history.\nE.g., if you deleted the file today, just go back to yesterday and recover the file in TimeMachine\n\n", "Q: Mouse scrolling by 'page' How can I configure OS X Mountain Lion to scroll one 'page' at a time?\nOS X's Scrolling Speed in Mouse preferences doesn't have the effect of what I'm looking for.\nThe default/current behavour is that the first few wheel scrolls is one 'line' at a time.

I would try checking the developer's websites for Mountain lion compatibility to be sure on your expensive mission critical apps before upgrading full time to Mountain Lion.  \n\nA: Yes, they do run. I have a number of Apps which come in 32 bit only (they do not have the \"run in 32 bit mode\" switch when you display the information panel) and they run fine.\n", "Q: Does iCloud use client-side encryption? I would like to know if iCloud uses client-side encryption i.e. all data is encrypted on client side and even Apple can't decrypt the data and read it.\nIs this true for iCloud?\n\nA: No.\nApple securely transmits and stores the data to the cloud by using secure tokens for authentication - as officially stated in the iCloud security and privacy overview1 and the iCloud design guide2.\nApple also states they they will \"never provide encryption keys to any third parties\", which of course is not entirely true due to the Patriot Act3.\nArsTechnica states that Apple holds a master encryption key4 and is able to unencrypt any personal data - i.e. also for government requests. \"This includes contacts, notes, unencrypted e-mails, application preferences, Safari bookmarks, calendars, and reminders.\" The data is only encrypted during transit and again when stored on Apple's servers. This is a necessity if Apple wants to provide browser access to iCloud data.\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation  notes5 that Apple is not inclined to be transparent about government requests.\nAs far as I understand the concept of client-side encryption, it suggests that all encryption must happen by the client as keys are not stored on the server (zero-knowledge policy).\nBecause Apple encrypts the data itself on the server for browser access it must store a key. Hence this is no client-side encryption.\n1 - http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4865\n2 - https://developer.apple.com/library/.../iCloudDesignGuide\n3 - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_act\n4 - http://arstechnica.com/...apple-holds-the-master-key.../\n5 - https://www.eff.org/pages/who-has-your-back/\n", "Q: How can I open a single app by an unidentified developer without allowing all I know to secure safety it is now not allowed anymore to open apps that were not downloaded from the mac app store.\nBut surely there is a workaround for this to open an app that you know is 'good' but just isn't in the app store.\nPreferably allowing only that app and not allowing all downloaded apps to be opened.\n\nHow do I open an app that is not downloaded from the app store in mountain lion?\n\nA: Disable gatekeeper just for one app:\nsudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/LockedApp.app\n\nDisable gatekeeper for all apps:\nsudo spctl --master-disable\n\nInstall your app, then enable it again:\nsudo spctl --master-enable\n\nYou can check assessments status by typing:\nsudo spctl --status\n\n\nA: You can ignore the gatekeeper restrictions on a per-app basis by right/control-clicking and selecting \"Open\". And because the check is done only on the first open, you can run it normally afterwards.\nMore details in: \n\n\n*\n\n*John Siracusa's review of Mountain Lion\n\n*Apple article HT5290, Mountain Lion: About Gatekeeper.\n\n\nA: To enable a single unsigned app that you know to be safe, follow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences, then Security and Privacy, then click \"Anywhere\"\n\n\n\n*Launch the app. This will remove the \"unsigned download\" warning status from the app.\n\n\n*Return to System Preferences and return the Gatekeeper settings to the level you want (default is \"Mac App Store and identified developers\")\nYour app should launch as desired, but future downloaded apps will be subject to Gatekeeper scrutiny.\n\nA: To enable the execution of an app against the policy that you have set in System Preferences, then you can simply right click on the app in question, and click open.  This will produce a further \"Are you sure?\" check, but will allow you to open an app and over-rule your app signature settings without you needing to go into System Preferences each time.  \n\nA: Although Ctrl+Right Click might work for some people, it didn't for me. They key to fix it is open Terminal.app (under /Applications/Utilities) and type in\nxattr -d com.apple.quarantine\n\nthen at the end press space and drag the application you are trying to open in there, so it should look like this (this is an example for Google Chrome):\nxattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Users/username/Desktop/Google\\ Chrome.app\n\n(here username refers to the user account name)\n", "Q: Will installing Mountain Lion require a complete refresh of my Time Machine backup? I currently have my Time Machine backup on my network and access it wirelessly.  This means a complete backup of half a terabyte of data can take a significant amount of time.  So, I'm concerned that when I upgrade to Mountain Lion, I will be forced to start from scratch on my backup. A secondary concern is the possible loss of previously backed up information.\n\nA: There is absolutely no requirement to start from scratch, the fact that a lot of OS files will have changed just means that the next run will be large, but the historical data you have already is good to stay around.\nIn fact, starting afresh is a really bad idea, because you will (assuming you use the same disk) lose all your historical files and the ability to revert to previous versions, or retrieve deleted files etc.\nAs things stand, keeping using the same store will allow you to even revert back to Lion if you so desired, the worst that can happen is the new OS install changes being large enough to fill your backup disk and force the removal of some of your older backups, but even so it's worth keeping with the same backup.\n\nA: Mountain Lion will change about 5G of data, not including the space to backup the installer if you save that onto Time Machine (and who wants to re-download that again, even on a screaming fast network).\nOther than that first backup where it moves the new files, there have been no reports of widespread issues with Time Machine behaving poorly with this upgrade. \nThat is not to say some people have other pre-existing corruption or unlucky failure at the same time as the upgrade and have had problems, but it's not the rule.\n", "Q: Configuring alot of iPhones? I configured a bunch of iPads at my previous job, and I had to do it one at a time.  Granted, there were only like 6 of them, but I am wondering what I would do if I needed to configure a whole bunch of iDevices.  I know at the Apple Store they apply updates on a bunch of them without taking them out of the package, so there must be some sort of way to do this.\n\nA: The Apple Configurator was made for this exact reason: easy deployment of iOS devices in large numbers.\n\nA: You would do some research on the various MDM solutions that exist and then decide whether you want to hire interns and employees to do the work manually or hire some software to allow one person to automate the parts of device management you care most about.\nHere's a nice place to start when you face this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.enterpriseios.com/wiki/Comparison_MDM_Providers\n", "Q: After upgrading Mac mini to Mountain Lion, the display is not working I had my Mac mini connected to a TV using VGA (with the mini DisplayPort-to-VGA adapter) running fine. After upgrading to Mountain Lion it simply doesn't work anymore.\nI wasn't using any software like screen res or so, just pure OS X. Any tips to get that back?\n\nA: Try logging into the machine with your display hooked up with HDMI (just so you can login), then switch over to VGA. Then try CMD + F2 (brightness up) to force detect displays and see if it switches over.\n\nA: Boot the Mac into the startup manager (hold the option key when you hear the chime as the system is booting). This removes the OS from the picture and lets the firmware drive the monitor and often can assist in knowing if the hardware has failed outright. You may not get a specific resolution in the startup menu, but enough video signal should be present on all video out from the Mac Mini to isolate the cause of the failure.\n", "Q: Alter inertia scrolling behaviour in Mountain Lion I like how with inertia scrolling you can swipe harder to scroll further down the page, but what I don't like is how the scrolling speeds up quite a bit as you scroll. This was not the behavior in Lion, and it is causing me headaches while scrolling around my text editor trying to edit code as it will consistently scroll right past where I'm trying to go. I can't find any settings for this, any ideas?\n\nA: There no official specific settings to this, although with command line changes you can turn inertial settings on and off full stop.  Unfortunately, especially if you like the inertial scrolling in part, the beth way forward for you is to understand how it works better.\nI've nicked this sentence from the ArsTechnica review, as there is no point in re-inventing the wheel:\n\nFinally, Apple has added iOS-style accelerated scrolling to Mountain Lion. The first three swipes on the trackpad scroll as they did in Lion, but on the fourth swipe, the distance traveled within the document greatly increases. This magnified ratio of finger movement to scrolling distance continues as long as the user keeps swiping repeatedly.\n\nIf you like inertial scrolling to a point, then perhaps a workaround is to only use it to a point.  Stopping after 3 scrolls will prevent you from triggering the increased scrolling acceleration.\nIt's not exactly what you want to hear, but sometimes you need to work within the confines of the system if you wish to pick and choose which bits of scrolling behaviour you wish to apply or not.  Perhaps further preference options will show up in the future (likely as command line changes), but overall you can probably imagine why they have made this change, because it's a good one for most (non-coding) users.\n\nA: I couldn't find it either and it is highly annoying with a trackpad, especially with webpages that use infinite scrolling (like Facebook). \nWhat I found to fix it - to a certain extend: \nSystem prefs > Accessibility > mouse & trackpad > mouse or trackpad options > scrolling speed > slow. (keep inertia on)\n\nA: I just found this fix on GitHub. I've tested it and it does indeed work. I still wish Apple would just add a switch into the preferences pane.\nhttps://github.com/davekeck/DisableExtremeScrollAcceleration\n\nA: There is a small tool (DisableExtremeScrollAcceleration) that (according to the author) switches this behavior off:\nAfter searching in the source code I think it should also be possible to just adjust the speed and thresholds without disabling it altogether.\n\nA: Take a look at USB Overdrive. With it help I've finally removed scroll acceleration and setup custom buttons on my Logitech m570.\n\n", "Q: How do you create an alias for iPhoto package folders in mountain lion? Has the ability to create aliases to folders inside the iPhoto package file been disabled or removed?\nI used to sync up my LightRoom library with iPhoto by using an alias to the Originals/Masters folder inside the iPhoto library package. But it now appears as disabled in the finder file menu and completely gone in the context menu and cannot figure out a way to create aliases to these type of folders. \nAm I going to have to ditch iPhoto completely or is there a workaround for this?\nEdit: Example of what I mean\n\nA: This still is possible via a work around.\nThe right-click contextual menu does not contain an option Make Alias for the Originals/Masters directories, but it does for subdirectories. The option Make Alias always shows in the menubar under File → Make Alias but is greyed out for the Originals/Masters directories.\nWorkaround\n\n*\n\n*Go to a subdirectory of Originals/Master in Finder.\n\n*Create your alias, ⌘+L.\n\n*Open the Info of the created alias folder, ⌘+I.\n\n*Click the button Select new Original\n\n*Press ⌘+⇧+G to enter a custom path.\n\n*Enter your path, e.g. /Users/my_name/Pictures/Aperture Library.aplibrary/Masters\n\n*Rename the Alias folder.\n\n \n", "Q: Keyboard Shortcut To Switch Between Opened Windows How do I switch between open windows?\nCommand+Tab switches between opened applications, but for example, when I open preferences-window of BetterTouchTool I don't get it shown via Command+Tab.\n\nA: Cmd+` will allow you to switch between the open windows of the current application. Very useful.\n\nA: By default (on a clean install of Mountain Lion), there is a keyboard shortcut \"Move focus to active or next window\", ^F4, which worked for activating the BetterSnapTool preference window (which is the same deal, activating a window in an app that doesn't have a dock icon).\n\nA: If you want to switch between windos within ONE application, you rather want to use the \"Move focus to next window\" command, 3 lines below the marked line in the screenshot above.\n\nA: Shortcut key to switch between opened windows is Alt+Tab\nRegards\nShefali\n", "Q: Microsoft Office 2004 reinstall? I bought a used iMac with OS 10.4.11 installed. It also has Microsoft Office 2004 on it.  I'd like to upgrade the OS to 10.6 but don't want to lose the Microsoft Office applications. I do not have the original disks or any codes, serial numbers, etc to reinstall Office 2004.  Is there any way I can accomplish the OS upgrade without losing Microsoft Office? I was hoping to transfer to an external HD and then transfer it back after I upgrade the OS.\n\nA: Make a good backup in case anything goes wrong, but if you install Mac OS X Snow Leopard using the default options, applications previously installed will remain in place with licenses intact.\nOne particular issue facing Microsoft Office 2004 under Snow Leopard is that Office 2004 is a PPC app, and thus requires Rosetta to run under Snow Leopard. Rosetta is not included by default in a Snow Leopard install, but rather needs to be included in the list of checkboxed items when you get the list of what components to install.\nFor more details about the Snow Leopard install process, you can read this article from Macworld.\n", "Q: How to disable animation while 3 finger swiping to desktop? If I use Ctrl + 2 to get into Desktop 2 it's much faster than swiping three fingers to that desktop.\nIs it possible to disable the animation with 3 finger swipe?\n\nA: The animation speed is proportional to the speed of the swipe. If you swipe fast enough, the animation will be even faster than the one used with Ctrl+2.\n", "Q: 15 inch Macbook Pro with Retina Display-dual Gateway monitors I am currently running dual monitors from a Gateway desktop. I would love to upgrade to a MacBook Pro, but would like to keep my two monitors. Is there an (easy) way to dual monitor non-Apple monitors from a MacBook Pro?\n\nA: Certainly. The Retina MacBook Pro has one HDMI output and two Thunderbolt ports, so you can run the internal display and three external monitors as long as you can accept HDMI on your third monitor (with or without an adapter/converter).\nAny mini-DisplayPort adapter from Apple will work from Thunderbolt in addition to adapters labeled as Thunderbolt.\n", "Q: Can OS X apps access my contacts even if I don't give them permission? After I upgraded to Mountain Lion, I noticed that apps have started asking for permission to access my contacts.  Very cool.\nWhen Skype initially asked for permission to access my contacts, I decided not to grant it.\nHowever, when I loaded Skype this morning, I noticed that my Skype contacts screen was still getting populated from my Address Book.\nI double-checked in the Security prefpane, and Skype still does not have permission to access my contacts.\nHow is Skype getting my contacts?  Can apps access my Address Book even if I have explicitly denied them permission?\n\nA: As this was an upgrade install, you had used Skype already for quite a while, right? I assume that Skype is simply displaying its own database which it build-up before Mountain Lion.\nI myself don't use Skype, so I just installed it and used my firewall to monitor what files Skype accesses:\n\nDuring the setup I was also prompted by Mountain Lion if I wanted to grant access to my contacts. I denied access. If I had granted access to my Contacts, the firewall would have intercepted as a second barrier (I've set it up this way). But this was not necessary.\nAfter several restarts Skype had written to ~/Library/Address Book Plug-Ins/, but your contacts are stored in ~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook. As you see in the first picture, Skype never gained access to my contacts.\nAnd indeed, there are no entries in Skype's own address book:\n\nSo what you have probably achieved now in Mountain Lion is that Skype will not gain access to any new Contacts that you add to your address book. When Skype had access to your contacts in Lion, it copied them already and there's nothing you can do to undo that.\n", "Q: Easy way to get *all* Notes to synchronize via iCloud? I have tons of notes on my iPhone. When iCloud came out, I created an account.\nNow I have the Notes App in Mountain Lion, but only notes added after the iCloud account creation date are showing there.\nIn my Notes iOS app I can see three 'Accounts': All Notes, On My iPhone (old unsynched notes) and iCloud (new synched notes).\nIs there an easy (or complicated but automated) way to get all notes from my iPhone on iCloud? I would like to avoid copy-pasting all of them into new notes, as I have tons of them.\n\nA: You need a 10.6/10.7 system handy as this doesn't work in 10.8. The method I've previously used is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug your iPhone into your Mac and go into iTunes -> Your Device -> Info tab and choose to Sync notes.\n\n*This should grab the notes out of the On my iPhone section and dump them into Mail.app.\n\n*Your notes should appear under the Notes section in Mail.app, but ideally filed under an On My Mac header.\n\n*Simply select all the notes from under On My Mac and drag them into the iCloud section. That should upload them all to iCloud and save you some time copying and pasting or fiddling with other software!\n\nA: This is actually amazingly simple in Mountain Lion.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Notes app.\n\n*You should have a list of notes folders on the left side.\n\n*Select the \"On My iPhone\" folder or whichever folder you want to move notes from.\n\n*Then select all the notes using Command+A.\n\n*Drag them to the Notes folder in iCloud.\nI literally just did this about 5 or so minutes ago.\nHope this helps.  :-)\n\nA: You can use a Mac app like PhoneView to access the notes on your iPhone. You will still have to copy and paste, but that can be a much faster process on the Mac—you have all sorts of options to speed things up, from keyboard shortcuts to AppleScript.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this is quite possible but try exporting your iPhone notes to your computer via this iPhone notes app. Then use the iCloud control panel on your computer to import the notes to iCloud. \nI am not sure if you could import Notes via the iCloud control panel on your computer but it is worth giving it a try.\n\nA: To do this on 10.9 open up Notes.app then select View -> Show Folders List\nYou should then be able to simple drag and drop notes from one folder to a different folder and also across folders on different accounts.\n", "Q: iPhone contacts off by one digit and/or swapped digits A few weeks ago, I erased and reinstalled my iPhone software (iOS 5.1).  I also decided to jailbreak it right around that time.\nSince then, I've noticed that several of my contacts have the wrong information in my phone.  Mobile numbers (and in one case an email address) are sometimes off by one digit/character, or two digits are swapped.\nFor example, if my contact's phone number is 555-0391, I will discover (after sending a few texts to a complete stranger) that her number is actually stored in my phone as 555-0319.  A few days after I've fixed the number and obsessively checked to make sure it's still correct, I notice that it has changed again, this time to 555-8391.\nI'm totally willing to accept that this is a case of user error, but I just want to check to make sure this isn't a known issue, being caused by a sync bug or malware, etc.\n\nA: I think it's most likely user error. I haven't heard of any bugs like this elsewhere, and it would be a particularly odd manifestation of data corruption. Keep an eye on it, but it probably just got incorrectly entered.\n", "Q: Will NTFS-3G and FUSE work out of the box if I upgrade from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion? On Snow Leopard I already have NTFS-3G (2010.10.2) and FUSE (MacFUSE Framework 2.2.1). I managed to install them and it works like a charm.\nIf I upgrade to Mountain Lion, does the operating system pick it up or I have to do it again from the scratch?\n\nA: Following that major upgrade of the operating system, you may find that some features of your product combination (NTFS-3G for Mac OS X, with a 2.2.1 version of the MacFUSE framework) are: \n\n\n*\n\n*usable, but unreliable, with a risk of kernel panics. \n\n\nRecommendation\nInstall FUSE for OS X 2.4.2 or greater, with its MacFUSE compatibility layer: \n\n\n*\n\n*before or soon after the upgrade of the operating system\n\n*certainly before you attempt to use NTFS-3G or any other software title that requires MacFUSE. \n\n\nBackground\nMaintenance of MacFUSE, in the Google Code area, ceased in 2009. \nSuccessors to MacFUSE include FUSE for OS X, also known as OSXFUSE. The first version with experimental support for OS X 10.8 was 2.4.0 (2012-05). \nIn my experience with OSXFUSE 2.3.8 and greater on multiple builds of Mountain Lion:  \n\n\n*\n\n*OSXFUSE 2.4.2 should be good for the vast majority of use cases with released Build 12A269 of the operating system\n\n*a delay-related alert may appear whenever an NTFS volume is mounted with NTFS-3G (2010.10.2) – this alert, not specific to Mountain Lion, may be dismissed. \n\nA: So at the end I upgraded to Mountain Lion, but for the moment I am still keeping with my versions of free MacFuse and NTFS-3g.\nI reinstalled them after upgrade and applied the patch for 15 seconds error found on this blog\nhttp://blog.nolar.info/ntfs-3g-in-mac-os-x-lion-10-7-with-read-write-support/\nFor now no r/w problems on my bootcamp partition but if you can suggest that I do a specific test to see if it is reliable enough, you are more than welcomed.\nNevertheless, if I encounter problems in the future I will pass to OSXFUSE.\nCheers\n", "Q: Why does QuickTime's screen recorder make my MacBook Air very slow while recording? On Snow Leopard (10.6), the screen recorder on QuickTime Player worked just fine. However, since I have upgraded to Mountain Lion (10.8) QuickTime screen recorder has been making my 2010 MacBook Air extremely slow/laggy while recording the screen but once I stop recording my computer is no longer slow/laggy.\nIs there a way to fix this annoying problem? My computer is pratically unusable while recording so I can't use QuickTime to record the screen until it is fixed.\n\nA: Not exactly a solution, but some observations that might provide a clue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Issue also seen on my Mac mini (Mid 2011 - 2.7GHz Intel Core i7 + 8 GB DDR3) after upgrading from Lion to Mountain Lion\n\n*QuickTime no longer saves the recording to ~/Movies/Screen Recording.mov, but instead saves it to some temp location and when done recording, you need to save/export it.\n\n*Downgrading quality to medium quality didn't help\n\n\n[Update 11/17]\nEven my new Macbook Pro Retina 15\" has this issue.\nI happened upon a tutorial that showed someone using VLC to screen capture on a Mac and decided to give it a try. It turns out that functionality was removed from VLC on Lion and Mountain Lion and the reason was provided in this this thread: Mac OS Lion, VLC screen capture does not work:\n\nApple completely removed the API to capture the screen and replaced it with something totally different. Until anyone steps up and implements the new one, this feature is not available to Lion users. It remains accessible to Snow Leopard and Leopard users of course.\n\nI'm not sure if this is also what's causing QuickTime on Lion+ to be super slow.\nI did find an alternative which is working out really well for me: Voila\nAvailable on the App store for $10 and records w/o performance issues. I was skeptical at first, so I downloaded its trial, and was extremely happy with the performance. $10 is definitely more than free, but depending on how often you need to record your screen, this is well worth the money in my opinion.\nIt supports both JPEG and H.264 encoding, but only records up to 25fps. For audio, it allows you to select which input and even allows you to use the computer audio (something QuickTime didn't allow and you had to use a separate utility like Soundflower).\n\nA: I believe that Apple has upgraded Quicktime's API's for high definition beyond 1080p etc. There is nothing wrong with quicktime per se. It's just laggy with older macs. Maybe faster SSD, more Ram might help?\nOr cheapest fix is install the correct OS that came with your mac. \nDowngrade one OS level greatly increases overall speed of system and \nbrings back Quicktime quickness.\n\nA: I recommend changing the setting \"Automatic Graphics switching\" in your system preferences to off. It helped me.\n", "Q: How to connect my macbook to a Wi-Fi network? \nUsing inSSider I see the eduroam network. Yet Wi-Fi doesn't detect it yet. Why could it be?\n\nA: It may be that the network doesn't broadcast it's SSID (tools like inSSider can pick up the name other ways). Try clicking Join Other Network and entering the details manually, see if that works.\n", "Q: Does Mail have to be open for Notification Center to work in Mountain Lion? I upgraded to Mountain Lion and thought the Notification Center would be quite handy, however I've had a look around the web and it seems to me that emails only appear in notification center while the Mail app is open, or after it has been opened. Is this true, and is there no way around it? Surely the notification center must be able to check for new emails on its own, otherwise would the mail feature not be near enough useless?\n\nA: The notifications that you receive for Mail within Notification Center are local notifications, not push notifications from some Apple server.  As such, the program has to be running in order for the action that will trigger a notification to be able to do so.\nNotification Center cannot check for new mails by itself, it has no in-built capabilities for polling/checking etc in order to create notifications, it merely receives them and displays them.\nIt is possible that in due course some email app will be made available that supports push notifications, but at present none do, including Apple's own.  The fact that you get such notifications on iOS is more a feature that the mail client is always running in order to check for new mail, and create the local notifications accordingly.  Leaving mail open all the time on your Mac isn't really an issue, it's hardly resource intensive, and if upon receiving a mail alert you wish to act upon it, then opening the alert will only open mail for you anyway.\nThe best way to summarise it is that NC just listens for alerts that other applications create, and displays them according to your preferences.  It takes no part in the creation of alerts.\n", "Q: Can I continue downloading Mountain Lion In Sleep Mode? I am downloading OSX Mountain Lion via the App Store however it is taking a while, will it continue downloading in sleep mode?\n\nA: No, however if you were already running ML, and you had a Flash-storage based Mac that supported PowerNap, then it would likely be able to do so as part of it's ability to automatically download updates etc (which are provided through the Mac App Store) when in sleep.\nBit of a self-fulfilling prophecy though ;)\n", "Q: Disable Specific USB Ports / Restrict Data Transfer from USB Ports In a work environment, I'm trying to \"lock down\" a mac computer so that files can't be transferred via USB storage device.\nProblem is, keybord and mouse are plugged in through USB, but I would still need those enabled, plus the keyboard has two more USB ports on either side.  I could use a bluetooth mouse and keyboard to get around that, but then how can I disable the USB ports (And later re-enable with admin access)?\nOr is there a way to limit the amount of data sent to/from as USB port? A keyboard and mouse wouldn't use that much, so then anything every X bytes/sec would get blocked?  I'm not sure what the solution is here.\n\nA: I think what you want to do is prevent the connection of USB Mass Storage Devices.\nI found this answer which is untested by me and not terribly recent, but I can see that the referenced kext is still in the location described:\n\na quote from the Leopard security configuration guide:\n48 Chapter 3 Protecting the System Through Hardware\nRemoving USB Support Software\nUse the following instructions to remove USB mass storage device input/output support such as USB Flash drives and external USB hard drives. \n  The removal of this kernel extension only affects USB mass storage devices.

However if you need to do this operation on multiple computers, it can take a lot of time to configure them. And you also have to make sure nothing else is affected besides the USB Mass Storage Devices.\nThe easiest way to go would be to use a software solution to control the removable devices connected to the Macs in your network. This should be a server-client solution, so you can manage everything centrally. Another important aspect to take into consideration is to be able to set allow/deny access on a device quickly in case of an emergency. Enforcing these device policies on Macs where the users have admin rights is also important.\nYou can take a look at Endpoint Protector by CoSoSys, which is considered the market leader for Device Control on Macs, but it works also on Windows and Linux machines.\n", "Q: How to remove Gmail from iPad mail?

I run Parallels with Windows 7, but I'm running out of disk space quickly.\nSo, I'm now considering moving the VM to an external hard drive. With that I want the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the external drive as backup location for my Mac with Time Machine.\n\n*Have the VM on the external hard drive and develop in Visual Studio. I think the speed of the drive is important since building applications can be resource-intensive for both memory and disk.\n\n*Have the disk encrypted so in case I lose the drive my data at least will not be accessible for other parties.\n\n\nI think a 100 GB - 500 GB drive will suffice.\nIs the above even possible and what interface would be recommended? Thunderbolt?\n\nA: Yes, all of this is relatively easily done, if you're using Mountain Lion (which is free for you if your MacBook didn't come with it pre-installed).\nWhat type of disk?\nSince the new MBA has USB 3, I'd recommend a USB 3 drive. USB 3 has more than enough bandwidth for any hard drive, and all but the fastest SSDs. There's a large selection of USB 3 drives, and they're far cheaper than Thunderbolt drives.\nHard drives will definitely be cheaper and offer far more capacity per dollar, but if VM performance is very important to you, an SSD may be worth looking at, and SSD prices have fallen sharply lately, below the $1/GB barrier. An SSD will have minimal benefits as a Time Machine drive however. Depending on your budget and performance tolerances, you may want to get a hard drive, see how performance is, and if you find it's not sufficient, get a small SSD for your VM and use the hard drive for your Time Machine.\nVMs and Time Machine on one disk\nTo set up one disk to use for your VMs and Time Machine, you'll need to partition it. Apple has a good guide on how to do this with Disk Utility. Make one partition with sufficient size for your VMs (you'll want to leave some room for expansion of course), then a second one with the remainder of your space for a Time Machine.\nOnce Disk Utility has partitioned these drives, it should mount them on your desktop and ask if you want to use them for Time Machine. Answer yes on whichever partition you intend to use for Time Machine (not both of course). There should be an encryption option during the setup process. If you're not prompted to use either partition for Time Machine, you can manually choose a disk in Time Machine preferences. See Apple's Mac 101: Time Machine article for more details.\nEncryption\nWhen you create a Time Machine backup, it will give you an option to encrypt the partition. However if you don't do that, or if you want to encrypt the other partition as well, you can do this directly from the Finder. Just right click on the drives you want to encrypt, and choose Encrypt from the context menu. It will prompt for a passphrase (don't forget it!), and encrypt in the background.\nI think that should cover everything.\n", "Q: Set keyboard shortcut for nested menu selection Say an application has a menu selection Export in the File menu.  On mouse over, a sub-menu extends with the export options.  Is there a way to make a keyboard shortcut for one of those nested selections?\nI've already tried implementing the keyboard shortcut for Export, setting it to Command-E.  However, this doesn't work, even though the Command symbol shows up next to Export.\nAny help is appreciated\n\nA: I realize this is an old thread but I was currently struggling with the same issue, in Filemaker Pro Advanced.\nIt turned out that if I put the shortcut in the \"All Applications\" section in System Preferences, instead of the Filemaker Pro Advanced section, it worked!!\nThis only applies to nested menu items. Non-nested works as they should (ie in the FM Pro Advanced section).\n\nA: Since Mountain Lion you can assign keyboard shortcuts to nested menu items using the following format:\nFile->Export->Sub-item\n\nI found the answer in this post on the Apple Support Communities by the user macNtouch.\nPlease notice:\n\n\n*\n\n*you have to insert the full path: partial paths will not work\n\n*you must not leave any space between the menu title and the arrow\n\n\nA: MacNTouch's answer still works perfectly on High Sierra and Mojave. I wanted to set up a shortcut for printing checks in QuickBooks 2019 Mac, but just creating a keyboard shortcut for the submenu Checks… would place the shortcut on File Import Checks…\nUsing the whole path, File->Print Forms->Checks… now puts my ^P on the correct Checks… submenu. You must use the whole path and the arrows must be a hyphen and greater than, all with no spaces.\n\nA: If you want to assign a shortcut to the submenu you can just use the name of the submenu as it appears. So if I wanted to assign a shortcut to the default encoding in Safari, using \"Default\" is enough. \nIf however you want to assign a shortcut to a submenu that occurs multiple times, such as \"My Folder\" you can use: >Move To>Notes, in Lion at least. This no longer works in Lion.\nYou could also try to assign a shortcut using apple script like this:\ntell app \"System Events\" to tell process \"Terminal\"\nclick menu bar 1's menu \"Shell\"'s menu item 1's menu \"New Window\"'s menu item \"Pro\" end tell\n\nand then use these steps to generate an automator action:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator and choose the Service template\n\n*Add a Run Shell Script or Run AppleScript action\n\n*Check that the values for accepted data types and application scope the are correct\n\n*Paste the script and save\n\n*Assign a shortcut in the Keyboard preference pane\n\n\nIf the shortcut for a service doesn't work at first, try running the service once by selecting it in the Services menu.\nCredit for the automator answer goes to Lori,\n\nA: Use \"->\" \nAnswered by MacNTouch at https://discussions.apple.com/message/20380162#20380162\n", "Q: Mountain Lion Messages Facebook Jabber connection problem This is a very weird problem I'm having with my Messages app on Mountain Lion. I have two accounts: a Google Talk and a Jabber account that is linked to my Facebook chat. Whenever I open my Messages app, my connection to Google Talk works just fine, but there is always a connection error with my Facebook account. But my Internet is working fine (like, I'm able to browse to www.facebook.com just fine). It's not an account authorization problem (incorrect username/password), trust me. To fix the problem, I need to go into Preferences -> delete my Facebook Jabber account -> recreate the account -> boom, connection is working fine again.\nBut, as soon as I log off from my Messages app (by closing it) and re-opening it, the problem re-emerges. Connection to Google Talk works fine, but a connection error with Facebook again. Perhaps this is an issue with Mountain Lion's implementation of Messages; because it is a newer app than the battle-tested iChat, there are still some rough edges needing to be sorted out.\nAnyone having any tips regarding this problem?\nPS: I did try to look at this question:  iChat + facebook disconnection\n\nA: These steps fixed the problem for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable the account.\n\n*Check 'Automatically find server and port'. \n\n*Enable the account again.\n\n\nA: To provide the solution I found:\nSign in to Facebook on your browser, go to Account Settings > Security > Generate App Password\nThis will create a unique random password for you to use.

If you know something we don't, then you tell us!\nAirplay Mirroring uses Intel Quick Sync Video, a hardware feature of newer Intel CPUs.  This consists of CPU support, and a separate ASIC on the motherboard, neither of which your 2008 Macbook has.\nIf you really needed to do it, my first thought would be to replace your motherboard and CPU with those from a newer Macbook, but generally they're designed specifically for their case, so I don't think this would be feasible.\nSlightly more realistically, you could reverse-engineer the Airplay Mirroring program, find the code that uses Intel Quick Sync, and write your own version that works without it, perhaps using the GPU (which would be 5-10 times slower but depending on the CPU and GPU could potentially work).\nThis would be exceptionally difficult, and of course far more expensive than simply buying a new Mac.\n\nA: As Ken pointed out, there are hardware limitations behind the machines Apple has enabled Airplay mirroring for.\nThat said, there's a 3rd party app, AirParrot, that has figured out the Airplay protocol, and can mirror your screen to an AppleTV on pretty much any Mac running Snow Leopard or higher (and there's a PC version for that matter).\n", "Q: Bootable Windows 7 USB won't boot I have used Boot Camp to create a bootable usb of Windows 7.

Am I doing something wrong?\n\nA: There is an alternative method to \n\n\n*\n\n*create a bootable USB of Windows 7 and \n\n*boot from it\n\n\nAssuming that you have the ISO handy (if you don't, there's Digital River links here), download Unetbootin.  \nUnetbootin allows you to create bootable USB drives from many Linux distributions and also ISO images. (note that Unetbootin requires admin privileges) The following image demonstrates how to manually select the ISO image. Click the \"...\" button to browse for your image.\n\nTo boot from your USB drive, I recommend rEFIt.  I use it myself to boot from an Ubuntu partition on my external hard drive that I use as a Time Machine on another partition.  It is useful for recognizing operating systems installed on your computer and devices connected to your computer (and their partitions).  I recommend simply burning rEFIt to a CD/DVD to boot to the Windows 7 install USB. Having had trouble trying to install it to the Mac itself (without the DVD), I usually boot to the rEFIt DVD, and continue to boot to my choice of operating system. \n(boot to a rEFIt DVD by holding down the C key [or the option key, as you stated] after you hear the chime of the startup)\nI know for a fact that Unetbootin works for creating bootable Windows  install USB's (I've run them before on PC's).  I will test booting from rEFIt and update this answer when I have.\n\nA: \"If you use Boot Camp, you may not be able to boot natively into supported versions of Microsoft Windows XP or Windows Vista operating systems installed on external USB hard drive.\" - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201663\n\nA: I ended up playing with the Superdrive a bit more, and eventually got it to read the DVD by laying the iMac down horizontally.

I have created a user called remotepair that I have logged into and verified I can use the Mac with. I have also added this user to the \"Remote Login\" service's allowed user list and turned on the service. This was all done in the \"Sharing\" control panel.\nI have gotten the public key of another computer and added it to the file /Users/remotepair/.ssh/authorized_keys. When the other computer attempts ssh remotepair@<my ip> I still get a password prompt.\nHow do I disable this password prompt?\n\nA: To update the answer for macOS Sierra (10.12.6 specifically),\nit appears the config file is now /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n2 lines must be uncommented+modified to fully disable password authentication: (These are lines 57 through 62, inclusive, in the default sshd_config file)\n# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!\nPasswordAuthentication no\n#PermitEmptyPasswords no\n\n# Change to no to disable s/key passwords\nChallengeResponseAuthentication no\n\nAs mentioned before, you may enable/disable ssh access from the System Preferences.app GUI, and no restart of the daemon is required between editing the configuration.\n\nA: To disable password authentication you need to edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config. In Terminal:\nsudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n\n(or replace with your favourite editor)\nLook for the line:\n#ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes\n\nAnd change it to:\nChallengeResponseAuthentication no\n\nThat is, remove the # at the beginning, and change yes to no.\nAll subsequent ssh logins will now REQUIRE you to use an ssh key and will not prompt for a password. Ensure your ssh key works before doing this if you have no local access! There's no need to restart the ssh daemon or anything because it is started on demand for each new incoming connection. Note that you may also see a PasswordAuthentication line, but that defaults to no already.\nIf your ssh keys aren't working then that's a separate issue really, but this answers the question as it is posed now :)\n\nA: You should check the permissions of the directories involved: /Users/remotepair/ and /Users/remotepair/.ssh, they must not allow write access by \"other\" users. My .ssh has access rights only for the owner. \nAlso, on the remote system, do a ssh -v remotepair@yoursystem to see which authorization methods are allowed and attempted. Lookout for  Authentications that can continue: publickey,password,keyboard-interactive. Maybe you must enable RSAAuthentication on your system. \n\nA: On a test system here, disabling the SSH prompt required the following two lines to be added to /etc/sshd_config:\nPasswordAuthentication no\nChallengeResponseAuthentication no\n\nThe comments in sshd_config also advise the following line be added:\nUsePAM no\n\n", "Q: I can't get my iPod classic 4th gen 20gb to turn on; what might be going wrong? A few months ago I bought an iPod classic 4th gen from Ebay. I did a factory reset on it (just to be safe) and it worked great. I used it a few times then set it aside for a while (while trying to find a car cable for it). The AC in my house died and it got pretty hot for 2 days while I waited for the repair guy.

Some things that could be happening, in order of probability:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your computer's innards could be dusty. This is the the most likely cause, and is easily remedied by unplugging your computer, taking it outside or into the garage,  and using a compressed air canister to blow out all of the dust in the vents. (If you have allergies or asthma, I suggest wearing safety goggles and/or a mask. Also, the can will get very cold, so wearing gloves is probably a good idea as well.)\n\n*A(n unrelated) background process could be taking up a lot of CPU. What was the CPU percentage? Did you check if any other processes were running? If this is happening often, it could be that some other program (Software Update, Finder, Skype, etc.) is trying to run in the background, and is experiencing errors that cause it to hog memory.\n\n*The game and/or media player you use may have recently undergone an update that consumes significantly more CPU and/or memory and/or disk usage that you are used to. If you ran a software update in the last two or three weeks, or if the game and/or media player performs automatic updates, this may explain the problem. (If this is the case, and the issue is very bothersome, you can probably contact the vendor to get the previous version.)\n\n*A government entity could be spying on you through your computer.\n\n", "Q: How to always show \"Library\" in the Finder its \"Go\"-Menu without holding a modifier key? I often use the \"Library\" folder in my home folder ~/.\nThe Library folder there (~/Library/) is shown (unhidden), and that is not the question.\nI would like to also always show the menu point \"Library\" in the Finder menu under the word \"Go\".\nNormally it only shows when I hold the Option ⌥ key the menu is open.\nI tried to assign \"Library\" to the shortcut for \"Downloads\" and gave Downloads another shortcut, like it worked for \"Save As…\". But it only shows up then holding down the Option ⌥ key.\nHow to always show the \"Library\" menu point under the Finder \"Go\" menu, without holding down a key?\nIn the screenshot I am holding down the Option ⌥ key:\n\n\nA: This isn't exactly what you've asked for, but it's as close as you can get for now. Open Terminal (in the Utilities folder) and type this command, and the Library folder will be visible in your home folder as it always was before Lion. The setting should stick until the next time you install an OS update, at which point Apple will \"fix\" the invisibility flag for you. Just do this again at that point, and all will be well.\nchflags nohidden ~/Library\n\n\nA: The method for doing this has changed beginning with macOS Sierra (10.12). chflags nohidden ~/Library no longer works.\nInstead, in Finder open up your home folder (Macintosh HD/Users/username), and once inside your home folder, press CmdJ to see the View Options for that folder.\nAt the bottom of that window, tick the option to Show Library Folder.\n\nSee this article if you want a more detailed explanation.\n\nA: There is no system-tweak-able setting (for now) that will change the \"Go\" menu behaviour. \nBasically, whether you have a shortcut defined to open Library or not, you'll have to hold \"Option\" to make Library visible in the menu.\nAlternatives from the comments for quick access to Library (as a workaround to it appearing) are to \n\n\n*\n\n*add ~/Library to your Finder toolbar\n\n*add ~/Library to your Finder sidebar\n\n*define a Finder keyboard shortcut\n\n*unhide the folder with chflags nohidden ~/Library\n\n*automate typing ~/Library and use Go To… Command-Shift-G\n\n*place the folder in the Dock or an alias to it on the Desktop (or elsewhere)\n\n\nA: This can only be fixed on Lion, not Mountain Lion:\nOpen System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts\nIn application shortcuts on the left, add an entry for Finder.app named Library (I used option+command+L) and you should see it in Library - again only for 10.7 Mac OS X Lion.\n", "Q: With a firmware password set on a Retina MacBook Pro, what are recovery options? I am considering setting a firmware password on my Retina MacBook Pro for security reasons. If I do this and later lose the password (or other such extenuating circumstances), how can the data be recovered? Is it even possible?\n\nA: It is possible for the lost firmware password to be reset, but not by a normal user.  As an Apple Certified Macintosh Technician working for a third-party service centre, if someone brings in a machine that has RAM soldered to the Logic Board and they have forgotten their firmware password, I can upload the serial number and request a firmware password reset.  We're then provided with a disk image that can reset the firmware on the machine with that specific serial number.  I believe, but can't confirm at this stage, that the utility on the disk image may expire after a certain length of time.\nFor all those concerned about privacy, any technician that requests a firmware password reset will have their details logged on Apple's end — so if it's reset for nefarious purposes, the details about which technician performed the reset can be tracked down quickly.  The reset also requires direct, physical access to the machine - the password cannot be reset remotely.\n", "Q: Where to find the build number INSIDE an install DVD of Mac OS X It's not written on the DVD itself and I don't have the DVD sleeve anymore.\n\nA: Check the SystemVersion.plist file that is on the Install Media.\nWithin the install media is the file containing the Build number, it is located at /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist\nThe string value for the Key ProductBuildVersion is the information you are looking for.\nNote: This tip is useful for getting the Build versions on any OS X bootable disk, regardless of install ability.\n\nA: Not exactly through the DVD as you asked, but Apple provides a list will all the build numbers for the Retail installation disks. \n\nOnce you've run the Installer, you could always go to the Apple Menu () and choose About this Installer, which should provide the build number. \n", "Q: How to reinstall Mac OS X built in Perl on Mountain Lion? I updated to Mountain Lion 4 days ago and then realised that my perl scripts did not work any longer. So I installed ActivePerl 5.14 (newest version) because I thought that perl has been deleted. After installing ActivePerl though my programmes still did not work:\nWarning message:\nrunning command 'perl calc.pl' had status 2 \nCan't locate Excel/Writer/XLSX.pm in @INC (@INC contains:    \n/Library/Perl/5.12/darwin-thread-multi-2level /Library/Perl/5.12 \n/Network/Library/Perl/5.12/darwin-thread-multi-2level /Network/Library/Perl/5.12 \n/Library/Perl/Updates/5.12.4 /System/Library/Perl/5.12/darwin-thread-multi-2level \n/System/Library/Perl/5.12 /System/Library/Perl/Extras/5.12/darwin-thread-multi-\n2level /System/Library/Perl/Extras/5.12 .) at test.pl line 3.\nBEGIN failed--compilation aborted at calc.pl line 3.\n\nIn the terminal when I type perl -v it shows that it uses the newly installed ActivePerl. I used sudo clan -> install Excel::Writer::XLSX to install the missing module. However, it does not install it for 5.12 but for ActivePerl 5.14.\nThe own Mac OS X Perl seams to be installed here:\nbash-3.2$ ls /Library/Perl/\n5.10    5.12    Updates\nbash-3.2$ ls /System/Library/Perl/\n5.10    5.12    Extras  lib\nbash-3.2$\n\nThere is also a version here:\nbash-3.2$ ls /opt/local/lib/perl5/\n5.12.4      site_perl   vendor_perl\n\nI thought best is to delete the ActivePerl by running its uninstaller. I did that and also removed the 5.12.4 as well as the site_perl directory in /opt/local/lib/perl5.\nThen I wanted to reinstall the XLSX::Writer module using cpan. I thought that it is then installed into the old perl directory. However running cpan now results in the following error:\nbash-3.2$ sudo cpan\nCan't locate strict.pm in @INC (@INC contains:    \n/opt/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.12.4/darwin-multi-2level \n/opt/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.12.4 \n/opt/local/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.12.4/darwin-multi-2level \n/opt/local/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.12.4 /opt/local/lib/perl5/5.12.4/darwin-multi-\n2level /opt/local/lib/perl5/5.12.4 /opt/local/lib/perl5/site_perl \n/opt/local/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.12.3/darwin-multi-2level \n/opt/local/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.12.3 /opt/local/lib/perl5/vendor_perl .) at \n/opt/local/bin/cpan line 5.\nBEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /opt/local/bin/cpan line 5.\n\nI don't know what to do now. I think the best I can do is probably reinstalling Mac OS X's own Perl, how to do that?\n\nA: I found on another website the following command\n$ sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'CPAN::Shell->notest(install => CPAN::Shell->r)'\nThis updated all my perl modules and all is back to normal.  Not sure why or what, but don't care that it is working now.\n\nA: For various and sundry reasons upgrading the OS requires one to separately upgrade/reinstall MacPorts. The developers have actually created a pretty nice Migration page that details the process necessary to get your ports environment working again after upgrading the OS.\nSummarized, the steps you need to follow are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install new Xcode.\n\n*Make sure command line (gcc, make, etc.) tools are installed. From within the Xcode application go to Preferences->Downloads and install them.\n\n*Download the MacPorts installer of choice for your OS version.\n\n*Install it.\n\n*Open your terminal of choice.\n\n*Run the command port -qv installed > myports.txt. This grabs a copy of all installed ports.\n\n*Uninstall all the ports: sudo port -f uninstall installed\n\n*Tidy up your play area: sudo port clean all\n\n*Go through the file myports.txt and reinstall the packages you actually want.\n\n\nI actually sped up my reinstall process by editing the myports.txt file, such that it contained the names (and only the names) of the packages I wanted with one package per line, and running the following command\ncat myports.txt | xargs -n1 port install\n\nWhat this does is go through that file and execute the command port install line for every line in the file. It is a useless use of cat, butwho cares, it's easier to read.\n", "Q: How to get the hand tool back in Preview.app in 10.8? In Mountain Lion's Preview.app the toolbar was changed quite drastically.\nWhile I can see why they did it, I found that it misses the Hand tool that one can use to move enlarged documents around with the mouse.\nHow to get it back?\n\nA: Here is the trick I use for large images. I select random rectangle than grab it and move selection to where I want my view span to be. Just like old hand mode. Works for me. \n\nA: Use the move tool by pressing ⌥ Option+Space. The cursor changes to the hand that allows you to scroll the content in all directions.\n\nA: When opening PDFs in Safari (in embedded mode), the hand tool is still available.\nYou could install Acrobat Reader and use this (instead of Preview) for PDF documents.\n\nA: You really can’t get it back…\nApple is emphasising the use of gestures for navigation a lot. Them removing the Pan tool is a step in that direction. I miss it too. You can pan around by moving two fingers on your trackpad or mouse.\n", "Q: Is a person fully able to make use of iCloud's ability to store and sync documents in the cloud if a person is not a die-hard iWork user? I see that if I use Preview.app its new method to move files to the cloud, I am not able to access it on my iPad or iPod.\nI have only one Mac, and an iPad and iPod touch. I use MS Word, Excel, etc., not iWork.\nGiven the above, am I right that iCloud does not really serve me, with regards to hoping to shift some of my documents and work into the cloud, for nicely synced access and consumption on other devices?\n(Note, I understand that iCloud's features syncing calendars and contacts work fine. I am talking about documents syncing and cloud storage features -- whether they do not serve my situation.)\n\nA: If you don't use iWork, iCloud will not help you very much for your documents and other files. On an iOS device, you can only open iWork files from iCloud. If you use any other file types, Dropbox would probably be the best alternative to iCloud.\nAlthough Mountain Lion allows you to store other kinds of files on iCloud, the only benefit you get from that is cloud backup of those files. However, if you want more than 5 GB of space, you have to pay for it, so it's likely not worth it.\nUpdate: I read that app developers now have the ability use iCloud to store files used by their apps. So, in the future, Microsoft could allow for you to have an iCloud library for MS Word files so that you could save them to iCloud on your Mac and then open them in your Microsoft Word application on your iPad (which doesn't exist). The catch is that the developer has to make the Mac app and the iOS app for this to be possible. So, as a counterexample, since Apple does not have a TextEdit app for the iPad, you can't open TextEdit files from iCloud on the iPad. Some company, though, could write a Mac app and an iOS app that allows you to edit text files from iCloud on any device.\n\nA: iCloud might work for your purposes.  Each application is given its own sandbox of storage to store documents.  An application's iCloud storage can only be accessed by that application.  So Preview can only see Preview's iCloud documents, while Notes can only see Notes' documents on iCloud, and so on.\nHow this works with iOS is that Mac App Store and iOS developers can have the same 'application' for their iOS and OS X applications.  This is how apps that have both iOS and OS X editions are able to sync via iCloud.  You can read more about it in Siracusa's Mountain Lion Review.\nThis brings us to your specific case.  If you don't have iWork on both your Mac and your iOS devices, then you can't use iCloud to sync those documents between iWork on your iOS devices and on your Mac as you're not using it on your Mac.  You could however, use iCloud and some 3rd party document applications to accomplish this, but offhand I don't know of any.\n", "Q: Why does iTunes Match hang on Step 3 on files it has already processed? I recently loaded a few hundred files into iTunes, and it's going through the paces of matching and/or uploading those files. But I've run into a problem, the process becomes stuck on Step 3 and never advances after hours of execution.\n\nAfter opening Activity Monitor, iTunes is taking anywhere from 300% - 400% CPU time, and an absurd amount of memory / active threads. Note that iTunes functions perfectly fine during this time, except for the iTunes Match process.\nWhen I ran into this problem previously, certain songs were having trouble uploading. I had resolved the problem by creating an AAC version via the right-click options and deleting the original version. In these cases, I think the files were ALWAYS mp3.\nHowever, the problem has resurfaced, but with a much more obnoxious issue. When iTunes Match appears stalled and exhibiting the same high-CPU issue, I open Activity Monitor, select iTunes and click 'Inspect'. Over on the Open Files and Ports tab, I see a number of sockets, network connections, and 3 open files. These files are not only m4a / AAC files, but have already been matched / uploaded.\nThese files will continue to show up each time I Force Quit and re-open iTunes, restarting the iTunes Match process. It isn't until I use the aforementioned workaround on the affected files that a new batch of files is shown, or I actually make some progress on the iTunes Match view. (At least until it hangs on another song...)\nWhy is iTunes opening, and more importantly hanging, on files it's already processed?\n\nA: Have you tried deleting the iTunes preferences files? You can find them on ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist and com.apple.iTunes.plist.lockfile\nErasing them will force iTunes to \"start fresh\" and hopefully fix the problems you have. It won't delete your data (songs, playlists, etc), so it's quite safe to try it.\n", "Q: How to prevent password reset using OS X installation disc? I want to set a master password for the whole machine, but it appears this can be easily bypassed.\nIt is possible to reset the Mac OS X Password using the OS X installation disk and Password Reset utility.\n\n\n*\n\n*Isn't this a security flaw?\n\n*Can this be stopped by other than encrypting the whole hard disk?\n\n\nA: Mac OS X (and now OS X) has always allowed the installation tools to reset administrator passwords.\nRather than locking the OS which can always be modified, you can either encrypt the OS image using File Vault or use a Firmware password to prevent other OS from booting. Many people use both tactics together for enhanced security.\nSetting a Firmware password is straightforward, documented in the system help and can be done via the installation disk or Recovery Partition.\n", "Q: How to revert Safari 6 Web Inspector? The new Safari 6 Web Inspector UI is a usability nightmare for me due to loads of tabs/panes with small icons and no labels.\nIt also seems to complicate common tasks like showing a list of XHR requests and their responses.\nIs there any way to revert the look and feel of the Web Inspector in Safari 6 to (more) how it was in previous versions?\n\nA: The new Web Inspector was made to be a bit closer to Xcode. \nThere is no direct way to get the old one back, without reverting to other means. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*running Lion in a VM (to run an older Safari).\n\n*Running a nightly build of WebKit - but this may only have the new inspector\n\n*Using Chrome (while still WebKit, it still uses something that seemed closer to me like the old inspector). \n\n\nSo no, at this time, it doesn't look like its possible to revert back to an 'older' version of the inspector. The best bet would be to submit bugs at http://bugreporter.apple.com. If it is missing features that the old one had, possibly future revisions would bring some of this back.\n\nA: just install the latest nightly build of safari: http://nightly.webkit.org/\nThen, you'll have the option to \"Use Webkit Web Inspector\". Yeah!\n\nA: There IS a way to have your old web inspector back.\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Safari (or other apps that use the web inspector)\n\n*Go to Finder, then hit \"CMD-Shift-G\". Alternatively, click \"Go\" from the menubar, then \"Go To Folder\".\n\n*Enter this and hit Enter:\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/WebInspector.framework/Versions/Current/Resources \nI recommend that you backup the contents of this folder before proceeding\n\n*Move contents of the folder \"inspector\" from the zip-file which you can download from the link below. Enter password if asked and replace already existing files.\nCopy the contents of the inspector-folder, not the folder itself.\n\n*Start Safari again and inspect away! :c)\nDownload the files here (Zip file).\nEverything you need is inside. Hope this helps!\n\nA: You can in fact switch to the \"old\" inspector.\nJust simply go to the Develop menu > Use WebKit Web Inspector\nBut there's a big UI bug with the traditional Inspector.\nEvery time you switch between the different panels the UI gets redrawn, creating multiple layers of the icons and search field.\nObviously something went wrong when they added the new Inspector.\n\nA: Here is a guide on how to revert Safari 6 to WebKit Web Inspector, if you don't want to run the nightly build.  I recommend using r121872, as suggested by jarek-foksa in the comments; that way you won't need to fix CSS and JS, and you get working Styles.\nThis even works with the iOS 6 Develop menu (the main reason I to use this method rather than the nightly build, which still uses the new Safari 6 Web Inspector for debugging iOS devices).\n", "Q: Can OS X be configured to only allow administrator users access to shutdown tools? Setting aside pushing a physical power button, can I prevent non-administrator users from initiating a software shutdown?\nIn Mac OS X Lion all users are allowed to shut down the workstation. How do I allow only the administrator to shut down the workstation?\n\nA: You can use Workgroup Manager and OS X's managed preferences (MCX) to restrict access to the Restart and Shut Down commands in the Finder:\n\n..then use the Accounts prefpane to show or hide the Restart, Sleep, and Shut Down buttons at the loginwindow:\n\n\nA: This seems drastic, and I wouldn't want to test it on my system, but if one were really determined to prevent non-administrative users from properly shutting down the system, one could rename /sbin/shutdown. The program /sbin/shutdown, run on its own, requires administrative privileges, but ordinary users can invoke it through the shutdown command in the GUI. The shutdown command in the GUI does depend on /sbin/shutdown, though, so if the program is not found where it is expected, the GUI shutdown sequence will not complete.\nIf an administrative user wants to shut down the system, they can invoke the renamed /sbin/shutdown from the command line using sudo.\nNote that none of this (or any other software solution) will prevent a user with physical access to the machine from pressing and holding the power button, simply pulling the power cord out of its outlet, tripping the circuit breaker for the circuit giving power to the computer, etc.\n", "Q: How does 'stuck' (in results of 'top') relate to 'not responding' (in Activity Monitor), 'spin' or 'hang'? In results of top commands, I sometimes see stuck. \nApple's top(1) OS X Manual Page does not explain this use of the word. \nHow, if it all, does stuck relate to the following? \n\n\n*\n\n*not responding – may be seen in Activity Monitor, in the Force Quit Applications dialogue of loginwindow, and so on\n\n*.hang files – may be present at /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports\n\n*.spin files – may be present at /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports\n\nThere's an an accepted answer for the first point. Answers relating to points 2 and 3 will be appreciated. \n\nA: There is usually no correlation between a stuck process of top and a non-responding application:\n\n\n*\n\n*stuck means that the process is currently un-interruptible which usually is the case if the process is waiting for a disk or network data block to be read (or similar low-level stuff). Technically speaking the process is executing in kernel space (aka Unix kernel) and can not be interrupted (so even a kill -9 wouldn't have any impact). Usually these stuck states only last milliseconds (as you can see in top as well because the number of stuck processes changes with every display cycle).\n\n*non-responding applications can be too busy to reply to any event OS X throws at them.\n\n\nI see one situation where a stuck process corresponds to a non-responding application: A process can be stuck for a very long time, perhaps stuck endlessly, without any possibility to kill it. This usually is the result of some programming error, e.g. improper disconnection from a networked device then the kernel keeps trying to read from it. In cases like this even a forced termination will not remove the process.\n\nA: Process state U, TH_STATE_UNINTERRUPTIBLE and Linux process state D\nSomeone else drew attention to MacOS top: “stuck” means “uninterruptible” | nelsonslog\n\n… TH_STATE_UNINTERRUPTIBLE, which I believe is\n  what ps reports as process state “U”. I’m guessing this is what Linux\n  calls “D” for “Device Wait”. In which case, in most cases the process\n  is fine, it’s waiting for some I/O to complete. …\n\nThe Ubuntu man page for ps confirms a process state code –\n\nD    Uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)\n\n– with no other mention of uninterruptible.\nIn FreeBSD/Linux Linux Kernel Cross-Reference: \n\n\n*\n\n*TH_STATE_UNINTERRUPTIBLE\nI found a 2002 discussion The Answer Gang 83: How to kill a process in uninterruptible sleep state? (highlights) that fits nicely with the observations made by @patrix. \nLast but not least, a 2004 post [X-Unix] PS and Stuck Processes (highlights) mentioning WindowServer, which fits nicely with the hang-related question that prompted me to post the question here: \n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro with Mountain Lion freezes frequently (full screen Flash in Chrome, Messages, HTC on USB)\n", "Q: Mountain Lion, System Preferences and App Store crash, Clean Install doesn't help Background - Mid-2010 MBP 13\", upgraded to 8 GB memory.

Anyone who can help is more than welcome! \n\nA: To answer the question in your update \"Can Time Machine do selective restoring?\", Migration Assistant (in /Applications/Utilities) can restore data from a Time Machine backup, with some control over what is restored.  See Apple's HT4889 for some details.\n\nYou also asked: \"If I restore my entire home folder, will I also be restoring the faulty settings related to the crashing apps?\", sadly, yes this is a possibility.\n\"Can I recover selective apps from Time Machine?\" I don't think so.\n", "Q: How can I view hidden files in the Finder? I noticed that whenever I add files and delete them, their physical space remains on the disk drive. I uninstalled NTFS Tuxera and I still have the same problem.\nSo I had to insert the disk under my other Windows laptop to locate the ./#### files and delete them. I was surprised that I couldn't locate those files in Finder, but windows allowed me to view them.\nIs there a way to have more control over what files are viewed in Finder?\nPlatform: retina MacBook Pro, Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8)\n\nA: Simple and faster:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder click on Go\n\n*Hold down Option key and hidden directories & files will appear.\n\n*Click on required directory or file.\n\n\nA: To enable the Finder to show all files (including \"hidden\" ones), you can type the following command in at the command prompt in Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool YES; killall -HUP Finder\nThe first part sets a hidden preference so the finder shows all files; the second part restarts the Finder so these preferences take effect (killall on its own tells a program to quit; the -HUP flag asks the program to restart).\nIf you want to reverse this so that the Finder now hides the files it normally hides, type this in Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool NO; killall -HUP Finder\nThat said, your actual problem of disk space not being freed up when you \"delete\" files is actually by design.\nTo permanently delete a file, you need to empty the Trash — Mac OS X doesn't delete files directly in the Finder; it first moves them to a temporary storage on their original volume, and then when you Empty Trash… in Finder, the files get deleted.\nSome users are reporting that defaults write com.apple.Finder is not working on their Mountain Lion systems but defaults write com.apple.finder (note the lower case) is working. On my system running Mountain Lion, I am finding that the command works as written, but if it doesn't for you, try lower-casing the F in Finder in defaults write statement.\n\nA: Run these commands to show hidden files\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool TRUE\nkillall Finder\n\nThese for hiding\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool FALSE\nkillall Finder\n\nNote: f in com.apple.finder is small & F in Finder is capital.\n\nA: Simpler, safer.\nIn the finder menu bar select \"Go/Go to folder...\". Type the path to the invisible folder, in this case the top directory first slash of /folderName/ and it will reveal all inside it without using the terminal.\n\nA: You can also create a service like this in Automator:\n\n[[ $(defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles) = 1 ]] && b=false || b=true\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool $b\nkillall Finder\nopen -a Finder\n\nThen give it a shortcut from System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services.\n\nA: For Open/Save dialogs, you can do CMD/shift/.(period)\nThis should toggle hidden files visibility.\n\nA: I have written a Mac OS X app \"Show Time\" to quickly hide and show hidden files from the menubar.\nIt is open source and available on GitHub.\nCheck out the source here and the release here.\n\nA: One simple way that no one seemed to mention here: press ⌘ + Shift + + while in Finder.\n\nA: There is also the option of using Mountain Tweaks.\nThis has a function that where you can simply turn on or off view invisible files, but it has a limitation and it will only show hidden files on the os you are currently booting from.\nSo for example you wish to copy a file from a hidden directory on your booted os to a connected disk and its hidden directory you will not see it on the \"targeted\" disk but you will see it on the one you are booting/working from.\nThis came up on me when I was transferring some mail files to a new hdd in my MBP that I was upgrading to.\nBut if you simply wish to see hidden files its a nice feature and the Mountain Tweaks app has some other very nice features as well, but it is a third party app and in my case the terminal way is an easier way.\n\nA: Do a Spotlight search for the file, when it is highlighted press and hold Cmd+Option and the path will appear at the bottom of the highlighted file.\n", "Q: How do I stop marking mail as read caused by looking at the preview pane? I use Mountain Lion.\nHow do I prevent Mail.app (6.0) from marking a message as read automatically, just because I have looked at it in the preview pane?\n\nA: You can change the mark as read delay to a great value, for example 30 seconds, by typing the following in the Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.Mail MarkAsReadDelay 30\n\n(NB: A value of -1 will disable marking as read from Preview if the preview window is hidden.  Tested on Mail 5.2/OSX 10.7.4)\n\nA: An other way to do do (without using the Terminal), is installing TruePreview. It's an 3th party app which allows you to do exactly what you expect. \n\nDo check for a recent version of TruePreview as older versions don't work well with Mountain lion.\n", "Q: Alternative to Tuxera NTFS and MacFUSE? Im trying to mount files to an NTFS format drive, I read on the internet that either Tuxera NTFS or MacFuse work for such things. However TuxeraNTFS filled my USB drive with space that should be free after file deletion, and I had to use windows to access the drive and delete the hidden folders created by Tuxera. MacFuse never installed correctly and states that \"MacFuse does not appear to be installed\"..\nIs there any other reliable program that 100% works with NTFS drives ?\nPlatform : rMBP Mountain Lion OSX 10.8\nThanks\n\nA: There are several programs that provide NTFS support. However, I would hesitate to claim that any of these programs can provide 100% compatibility and support. \nHere's a subset of the NTFS list in Richard Austin's Blog Champion's discussion of OS X file system choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tuxera - I've used this program with no issues in Lion and Mountain Lion\n\n*Paragon - site claims to support Mountain Lion, personally haven't used\n\n*OSX Fuse - a freeware successor, don't know if it works with Mountain Lion, personally haven't used\n\n\nI don't have a retina MBP to test with, but any of these should offer you a good starting point. Since you've already tried Tuxera, Paragon appears to be your best bet, while OSX Fuse would be a good option to try out.\n\nA: FUSE for OS X works just fine. I am currently using this in Mountain Lion.\nI tried this order and it worked fine.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install FUSE for OS X\n\n*Install NTFS-3G \nREBOOT\n\n*Install fuse_wait \nREBOOT\n(source http://i.vishalagarwal.com/)\n\nA: For 10.7 I used NTFS 3G with MacFUSE, everything was fine. Now with 10.8 I use Seagate free NTFS driver (the same as comercial Paragon NTFS for Mac), also works well. Great when purchasing an external HDD you get free driver for it!:)\n\nA: My recommendation is the arguably most expensive and least convenient, but also the most reliable and can either be one-time or for a permanent arrangement.\nShare the drive from a Windows machine capable of handling NTFS.  Read/write files using the SMB client built into OS X and not worry about native filesystem support compatibility issues.\n", "Q: How to detect spy/keylogger software? I have some serious suspition that my boss installed some kind of spy software. Maybe a keylogger, screen capture or something to know what I do when he's not at the office.\nI have nothing to hide so I don't know if he doesn't tell me anything because he didn't find anything out of place or because I'm being paranoid and he's not spying me.\nEither way I want to be sure if I'm being spied because:\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't want to work for someone he doesn't trust me me\n\n*It's illegal and I won't allow anyone to store my passwords (I do access my personal email, homebanking and Facebook account during lunch breaks) and personal information.\n\n\nSo... how can I detect spy software in a iMac running OS X 10.6.8? I have full admin permissions know it.\nI tried scanning all folders in my user's and system Library but nothing rang any bell but since I think any of this software would hide the folder (either by location or name)  I don't think I'll find a folder named Employeee Spy Data\nI also looked all the processes running at different moments with Activity Monitor but again... it's not like the process would be called SpyAgent Helper\nIs there a list of known possible folders / processes to look for?\nAny other way to detect?\n\nA: I'll make the hypothesis you have already thoroughly checked all the\nmost common RAT are off or dead (all sharings, ARD, Skype, VNC…).\n\n\n*\n\n*On an external and fully trustable Mac running also 10.6.8, install one (or both) of these 2 rootkits detectors:\n\n\n*\n\n*rkhunter\nthis is a traditionnal tgz to build & install\n\n*chkrootkit\nwhich you may install through brew or macports,\nfor example: \nport install chkrootkit\n\n\n*Test them on this trustable Mac.\n\n*Save them on an USB key.\n\n*Plug your key on your suspected system running in normal mode with\neverything as usual and run them.\n\nA: Any kind of rootkit worth its salt is going to be nearly undetectable on a running system because they hook into the kernel and/or replace system binaries to hide itself. Basically what you're seeing cannot be trusted because the system cannot be trusted. What you need to do is turn off the system, connect an external boot drive (don't connect it to the running system) and then boot the system from an external disk and look for suspicious programs.\n\nA: One definite way to see if anything suspicious is running is to open the Activity Monitor app, which you can open with Spotlight or go to Applications > Utilities > Activity Monitor. An app can hide from plain sight, but if it's running on the machine, it will definitely show up in Activity Monitor. Some things on there will have funny names, but they are supposed to be running; so if you aren't sure what it is, maybe Google it before you click Quit Process, or you could turn off something important.\n\nA: If you've been hacked, the keylogger has to report.  It can do this either immediately, or store locally and periodically spew it to some network destination.\nYour best bet is to scrounge an old laptop, ideally with 2 ethernet ports, or, failing that with a PCMCIA network card.  Install a BSD or Linux system on it. (I would recommend OpenBSD, then FreeBSD just because of easier management)  \nSet up the laptop to act as a bridge -- all packets are passed through.  Run tcpdump on the traffic back and forth.  Write everything to a flash drive.  Periodically change the drive, take the filled drive home and use ethereal or snort or similar to go through the dump file and see if you find anything odd.\nYou are looking for traffic to an unusual ip/port combination.  This is tough.  Don't know of any good tools to help winnow out the chaff.\nThere is a possibility that the spyware writes to the local disk covering its tracks.  You can check for this by booting from another machine, boot your mac in target mode (it acts like a firewire device) Scan the volume, grabbing all the detail you can. \nCompare two runs of this on separate days using diff.  This eliminates the file that are the same on both runs.  This won't find everything. E.g.  A Blackhat app can create a disk volume as a file.  This won't change much if the Black app can arrange for the dates to not change.\nSoftware can help:\nhttp://aide.sourceforge.net/  AIDE Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment.\nUseful for watching for changed files/permissions.  Aimed at *ix, not sure how it handles extended attributes.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: To detect and delete apps you can use any uninstall software for Macintosh (like CleanMyMac or MacKeeper).\n", "Q: Pointing devices not properly recognized and won't left/right click after upgrade to Mountain Lion Have loved my Magic Trackpad since it first came out. Since upgrading to Mountain Lion, the system fails to recognize the Trackpad after a reboot. I need to pull the batteries, reload them, and power the Trackpad on... then the Mac sees it. But even then, it won't accept any clicks, it just moves the cursor around. I also tried an old fashioned USB mouse... it needs to be unplugged and plugged back in, but like the Trackpad, that allows cursor movement, but it also won't accept clicks (which makes me believe it is not a Trackpad problem). The machine is a MacPro 3,1 dual quad-core (2008).\nMy workaround in the meantime is (I think) going to be to remove my wife's user account, then I don't need to click to choose the user. But it is extremely annoying. \nAnyone else come across this and have a fix?\n\nA: Go to System Preferences, then click on Trackpad.  You will have to add the use three fingers to swipe box, as well as unclicking the natural scroll box in the scroll/zoom tab.  Hopefully this helps.\n", "Q: How to quickly send new mail without opening mail application? I know Quicksilver has a plug in for quickly sending new mail messages without opening the Mail application.\nBut the Quicksilver plug in doesn't work under Mountain Lion.\nHow do you send a new mail message from Mail using Mountain Lion similar to the Quicksilver approach using preferably free application?\n\nA: Check out QuickMailer. It's similar to LaunchBar but I feel that it's easier to use. Here's a screenshot:\n\nIf you're a keyboard-junkie like me, it has shortcuts to compose mail and send mail (Compose: Ctrl + ⌥ + ⌘ + m, Send: ⇧ + ⌘ + d) to speed up the mailing process too!\nIt isn't free, but it's pretty cheap at 99 cents. I don't own it so I haven't tried it out, but I've heard great things about it.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: The Email Support plugin for Quicksilver was updated on 8/17/12 which enables you, once again, to quickly send new email messages. See the qsapp site for more but the updates include:\n\n\n*\n\n*works with Quicksilver in 64-bit mode\n\n*full documentation provided\n\n*visible notifications are shown when sending a message fails\n\n*Compose E-mail action now uses your selected client instead of the system default\n\n*icons for actions match the application that will perform those actions\n\n*improved preferences\n\n*direct sending updated to use MailCore (should support authentication, SSL, etc.)\n\n*enhancements to the QSMailMediator protocol\n\n\nAfter some experimenting I've been able to send messages through mail.app easily, but still trying to configure to send in the background and use other mail clients. I'm sure we'll see an article on the Love Quicksilver blog soon...\n\nA: You can use the very underestimated Services Menu. Just mark any text, a single letter is sufficient, and control-click to open the context menu. At the bottom you will find the item \"Send selection by mail\" or \"New mail with selection\" or something similar. \nIf you don't see it, open system settings -> keyboard -> shortcuts -> services -> text (or similar, my Mac talks German with me) and enable \"send selection by mail\". If you don't find \"send selection by mail\" just add it using the Automator. \nOnce setup (usually no setup is required, since it is enabled by default) is completed, this is the fastest way to get a New Mail window. \n\n", "Q: Can a Mac OS X DVD that came with a computer be used to upgrade another computer? I have two computers -- the newest, a MacBook Pro, came with OS X 10.6, and the oldest, an iMac, is running 10.5.8.\nIn order to upgrade from 10.5.8 to Mountain Lion, one has to first upgrade to 10.6, so I thought I could just try the DVD that I got with my other computer to get this first step done.  And it's not working (the installer says \"Mac OS X 10.6 cannot be installed on this computer\" although the computer appears to satisfy hardware all requirements--I wish this error message was a little more helpful).\nIs it because of restrictions of the Mac OS X DVD?  I suppose what I'm doing with it isn't exactly its intended use.\n\nA: Generally and legally no, since the installer on the DVD is checking for machine specific model identifier for the MacBook Pro that the DVD came with as shown in this workaround .\n\nOnce the file is opened, scroll down about ¾ of a page and you will come across a series of strings named hwbeSupportedMachines.\n\nNow, technically the DVD's that came with Macs included a standard Mac OS 10.x.x Install plus new drivers for hardware specific features for that new model, stuff that would not be known about or included in the 10.x retail install DVD Mac OS X versions (builds) for computers. Which means the OS that came with your Macbook Pro once its installed on the Mac Book Pro should include all it needs to run on the iMac too. You just have to get it there, which you could do via cloning a 10.6 install from the MacBook Pro to the iMac or maybe via installing OS X 10.6 on the iMac via the MacBook Pro using FireWire target disk mode.\nUntested Solution if you want go the Upgrade path of 10.5 to 10.8 wihout erasing the iMac\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup important Data on iMac\n\n*Boot the iMac into target disk mode, by holding down the T key while boot the iMac.\n\n*Connect iMac to the MacBook Pro via FireWire\n\n*Boot the MacBook Pro from its 10.6 Installer DVD\n\n*Try to select for installation of OS x 10.6 the hard drive with 10.5 installed on it in the iMac.\nNote: This is the untested part, the Restore / Install DVD may not allow upgrades from prior OS X versions.\n\n*Boot up the iMac and then upgrade to latest version of OS X 10.6\n\n*Install OS X 10.8\nRecommended Solution:\nThis will promote better performance via a clean install to a blank disk thus reducein legacy cruft and other left-overs from old OS X installs and old Applications, etc.\nFirst thing upgrade the MacBook Pro to Mountain Lion, if you have not done so already.\nNext back up all your files you want from the iMac, since OS X Lion / Mountain Lion will not be able to upgrade users from Mac OS X 10.5 to 10.8.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a boot able Mountain Lion install disk(using a hard drive or usb thumb drive) \n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Mac App Store, go to purchases and re-download the Install Mountain Lion Installer.\n\n*Create a boot able disk drive by extracting the InstallESD.dmg from it to a external drive or partition. See How to create a bootable, backup Mountain Lion install disk\n\n*Connect the external drive to the iMac\n\n*Start the iMac while holding down the option key. Select the MTN Lion installer to boot from.\n\n*Once the MTN Lion installer loads open Disk Utility and Erase the Hard drive in the iMac\n\n*Quit Disk Utility\n\n*Install OS X 10.8 by selecting Reinstall Mac OS X\n\nA: OS X is OS X is OS X. Yes, u can use the disk to upgrade your old machine, although not legally. There is no licensing to deal with, so it's rly easy and straight forward.\n", "Q: Is there a way to stick a window? Is it possible to choose a window and force it to be sticky (stay in front) if I switch to another application?\n\nA: There's no built-in functionality like this, but you could try something like Afloat, which adds this and some other window management options. However it does require SIMBL, which is a bit hacky, and can result in bugginess, especially on newly released OSes, where the developers may not have had as much time to test.\n", "Q: Migrating Mail.app rules from 10.6 to 10.8 I want to move my Mail.app filtering rules from my old 10.6 machine to a fresh 10.8 install. I've seen people talking about moving these by copying over  MessageRules.plist, but I haven't seen anyone address whether these are compatible between 10.6 and 10.8. Thanks!\n\nA: I copied all of the user-created <dict>...</dict> items from my old MessageRules.plist and added them to:\n~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/UnsyncedRules.plist\n\nWhen I launched Mail.app again, they were in my rules, but disabled. One click on each and they ran fine.\nNote: Simply replacing the entire set of <dict>...</dict> items in UnsyncedRules.plist will not work. You must add them into the current set of items in order for it to work properly.\n\nA: For all those who tried copying the MessageRules.plist file over from 10.6 to 10.8 and got nothing here's what I did to get them working. \nEssentially copy all the rules via copy/paste from  MessageRules.plist (10.6) to SyncedRules.plist (10.8) - use a text editor to copy and paste everything from the </array> tags in the old file to the new one. Then restart Mail.\nLonger version:\nCopy MessageRules.plist from Users>User>Library>Mail> on your 10.6 machine to anywhere your 10.8 machine. Open up the file in a text editor and copy everything between the <array></array> Tags. Then paste it all in the file SyncedRules.plist on your 10.8 machine in Library>Mail>V2>MailData inbetween the<array> tags. Restart the Mail app and all the rules should show up in preferences section.\nMail will slowly even create the folders/mailboxes to store the messages in folders that don't exist but are pointed too in your rules that you imported.\n", "Q: Time Machine question Is it possible to use Time Machine such that I can restore the machine to a specific date in time? By \"restore\" I mean fully restoring the exact same files system wide.\nFor instance, today I'm sure that my machine is clean and has only the must-have programs which cause no problem to the machine. Let's say that I'll be doing some system customization and install some unstable applications, which will cause problems to the system down the road. Will I be able to fully restore my machine using TimeMachine to a specific date which I know for sure worked perfectly?\n\nA: Apple's support page for Time Machine indicates in multiple places that you can restore individual files as well as perform a full system restoration.  The site specifically states that Time Machine \"...remembers how your system looked on any given day—so you can revisit your Mac as it appeared in the past.\"  Additionally, the support page also mentions being able to restore your entire machine by first booting to the recovery partition.  All of this would seem to indicate that, yes, you will be able to restore your machine to a specific date when your machine worked perfectly.\nThat said on older machines for which Time Machine was not available, I have had success using Carbon Copy Cloner to make an exact clone of my system drive at specific dates and times.  This would provide myself with a fully bootable backup drive that I could immediately swap into a machine for a minimum of downtime should I experience a drive failure.  This method, however, is more for the advanced user who has a Mac that is more easily serviced than many of the currently available Macs.\n", "Q: Broken keyboard: Apple store policy? One of the keys on my keyboard is non-responsive after cleaning it. I want to get the keyboard repaired rather than buy a new one. What is the Apple store policy for keyboard repairs? My iMac is out of warranty due to being 4+ years old.\n\nA: In a general sense, policy is how the employees handle your specific situation, but here is the legal description of what the hardware warranty policy is:\nhttp://www.apple.com/legal/\nAs regards to any company, they may go above the policy when it's the commonplace or expected thing to do so it never hurts to ask nicely if some accommodation could be made in a specific case.\n\nThis line of thinking has helped me in the past. Think of a warranty as a guideline for who pays for a repair. Within a warranty (or AppleCare), it is Apple's responsibility to pay for most repairs except for intentional misuse or accident.\nAfter the warranty period has passed, it's the consumer's responsibility to pay for most repairs except for the most unlikely event that there was a clear error on the manufacturer's part in making the product.\nI have found Apple to be very understanding of honest mistakes when attempting a normal consumer activity (changing RAM, cleaning, etc..) and covering things that might be considered consumer damage.\nIn this case, you could ask Apple to cover your keyboard, but it seems you should instead ask for a repair quote and expect to pay for a repaired keyboard. I believe a USB keyboard replacement (entire new keyboard) is in the $29 dollar range but you could reach out to Apple and get a quote for your specific location and part number before deciding what to do.\n\nA: I am at an Apple Store right now for a wired keyboard issue and the keyboard was over a year old. They did replace it for me with a brand new unit. That said, they do treat situation on a case by case basis.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Late-2011, Mountain Lion, when it sleeps, devices don't wake Made the upgrade to Mountain lion when it came out, but since the upgrade I have noticed something occurring when my laptop goes to sleep be it idling or me putting it in a sleep mode, when I go to wake the laptop almost every time anything hooked into the USB ports don't respond and remain dormant as if the laptop was still in a sleep mode.\nExample one of the places I hook my Mac up has a wired USB keyboard, and a USB to VGA monitor connector which doesn't respond when I wake the laptop. Or another place where I have 2 USB Monitor connections, a USB based harddrive toaster. All of which stop responding after the laptop sleeps. I have to pull the USB's out and plug them back in to make them work again and only after I wake the laptop.\nSo I am wondering is there some new power settings I am missing somewhere, that don't turn the USB on after idle? Everything worked just fine prior to the Mountain Lion Upgrade so I know its nothing to do with that.\n\nA: Maybe you already found this, but ....\nSystem Preferences/Energy Saver \nhas a checkbox \"Wake for network access'\nThe help says:\nSelect this option if you want other users to be able to access your computer’s shared resources, such as shared printers or iTunes playlists, even when your computer is in sleep mode.\n", "Q: Some SMB shares unavailable from Mountain Lion? I've recently upgraded one of the machines in our office to Mountain Lion.  Since doing so, when connecting to (or browsing to via Finder) our Windows 2008 R2 file server, some shares no longer appear in the list of available shares on that server.  Not all shares have disappeared, only five out of approximately fifteen shares are not visible.\nThis does not appear to be a user rights issue, as the shares do not appear for multiple administrator and non-administrator accounts.  Additionally, the shares were perfectly accessible from the machine pre-ML upgrade, as well as still being accessible from all other OSX machines in our environment.  In other words, the issue appears to be confined solely to our single machine that was upgraded to Moutain Lion.\nHas anybody discovered a solution?\nAdditional information:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro upgraded from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion\n\n*Server is a member of our AD domain\n\n*Machine is not a part of the Active Directory domain\n\n*Credentials used to connect to server include Domain Admin credentials, user account with domain admin rights, and multiple user accounts without admin credentials but with credentials to view the missing shares\n\n*Server is running Window Server 2008 R2\n\n*Machine has no trouble accessing files on our XServe running 10.5 Server\n\n*Essentially, all other variables seem to be constant with no known changes to the network and server infrastructure involved\n\n\nA: We faced the same issue. At the office you can't see the shares, but connect through smb. Through a VPN this ain't possible. The answer is in the length of the share-name. Mountain lion can only see them if the length of the sharename is 12 characters or less. Seems like a bug to me. Changing the sharenames is what we did to resolve this issue.\n\nA: Solution:  Join the Mountain Lion system to the Active Directory domain.  User can still log in with their local user name, but when connecting to smb://servername, OSX will stop defaulting to .local for credentials.  This is new to ML, and I think it is a bug, but this is the only solution that we have found.\n", "Q: Applescript won't play movie when waking from sleep I have the following AppleScript, which is triggered by iCal to act as my alarm clock:\nset musicPath to the path to me as text\nset musicPath to text items 1 thru -12 of musicPath as text\nset musicPath to musicPath & \"drumsolo.aif\"\n\nset volume output volume 90\n\ntell application \"QuickTime Player\"\n    run\n    open musicPath\n    tell document 1 --\n    play --\n    end tell --\nend tell\n\nI've also used 'play front document' and 'play document 1' for the block marked with dashes.\nThe problem is, System Preferences wakes up the computer on time (from sleep, 5 minutes before the script is triggered).

I understand that DHCP server features will be \"removed\" from OS X Server with Mountain Lion and that there will be no way to manage these using the only remaining app for managing server features (Server).\nHowever, I also gather that it is possible to not only preserve DHCP server settings, but continue to manage them under Mountain Lion Server, if one is careful to follow certain steps. But it's not entirely clear exactly what those steps are, and I don't want to undertake an upgrade at the risk of loosing (even for a second) critical settings and functionality (my entire network has static IP addresses assigned by Lion Server).\nHow can I ensure that I do not loose my DHCP server settings, and can continue to manage them, through an upgrade from Lion to Mountain Lion Server? In particular, what are the steps to save my existing settings in Lion and have them used throughout the upgrade process to Mountain Lion? \n\nA: The situation is actually simpler than some references make it seem. As Apple states:\n\nIf you enabled DHCP (only) in Server Admin in Lion Server, your configuration will be preserved when you upgrade or migrate to OS X Server (Mountain Lion).\n\nMoreover, the Server app now provides a (very limited, but sufficient) user interface for controlling DHCP.\n\nA: I'm confused.\n\nThis is from ML server.  Next, as I understand it, you CAN NOT run Internet sharing WITH DHCP turned on.  You do one or the other.  If you turn on Internet Sharing it will supersede the DHCP configuration.\n", "Q: Is it possible to remove/uninstall Quicktime Player 7? Is it possible to remove/uninstall Quicktime Player 7?  I installed it back when my system was running Snow Leopard and now I'm on Mountain Lion I no longer need it but I can't see a way to remove it.\n\nA: OS X seems to allow just moving it to the trash, which is probably the recommended way to remove it.\nIf you use an application like AppCleaner, check that it doesn't actually try to delete files for the new QuickTime Player:\n\nThe bundle identifiers of the old and new version are com.apple.QuickTimePlayer and com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX. The only files it found for the old version were:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Applications/Utilities/QuickTime Player 7.app/\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.quicktimeplayer.plist\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.quicktimeplayer.plist.lockfile\n\n*~/Library/Caches/com.apple.helpd/Generated/com.apple.QuickTimePlayer.help/\n", "Q: My keyboard stopped repeating - how to fix? I have both an internal and external keyboard but the key-repeat has stopped working.  I've tried changing both 'Key Repeat' and 'Delay Until Repeat' as shown below but no setting seems to be helping.\n\nThis is a brand new mac (5 weeks old).\n\nA: By default, on macOS (since at least OS X Lion), when you hold down a key, it will display a popup allowing you pick a special character if there are any assigned to that particular key:\n\nIf a key doesn’t have any special characters behind it and you hold it down, nothing will happen.\nAs stated in Apple's docs:\n\nYou can add accent marks and special characters to some letters. For example, click and hold the a key to type à, á, â or other characters.\nIf you set the Key Repeat slider to Off, special characters won’t appear when you hold down a key.\n\nSet how quickly a key repeats on Mac\nTo disable special characters popup and return traditional behaviour with key repeat, run following command in Terminal:\ndefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false\n\nThen restart applications (or computer) to update settings.\n\nA: Well it looks like there are a couple solutions:\nOption 1. Enter this in terminal: defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false. To disable repeating keys again, enter the same command except change the false to true.\nOption 2. Download Mountain Tweaks (I assume you're on Mountain Lion, if not, download Lion Tweaks) and click the \"Yes\" option for \"Enable Repeating Keys\":\n\n\nA: If running\ndefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false\n\nseems to have no effect, try a restart. This seems to be necessary in more recent versions of OS X.\n", "Q: How to fix iTunes/Skype where fonts all show up as boxes after Mountain Lion upgrade? When I login to iTunes or Skype the fonts all show up as boxes. \nNo fonts were removed on installed; none are disabled and all the normal ones show up. Doesn't happen on any web site; only seems to be locally installed programs.\nUninstalled and reinstalled and programs still don't work.\nExample Image\n\nA: This usually happens when you have Fonts Caches (or actual Fonts) that are corrupt. I would do the following, to not only clear the caches, but also to verify your Fonts.\nClearing the font cache - you have a few options (Onyx is just easier).\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a tool like Onyx, which can do this and many other maintenance tasks for you.\n\n*Manually remove the cache with the command line atsutil utility. You basically would do astutil databases -removeUser then sudo astutil databases -remove, then astutil server -shutdown, then astutil server -ping. I would recommend restarting after this.\n\n*Choose from various other utilities like Onyx that clear just the font cache. \n\n*Some people also recommend clearing out the /Library/Caches folder, but I am not sure how well this works. There also used to be some older ways to clear the cache but I cant find them (and I am pretty sure it was tools before Mac OS 10.5). \n\n\nVerifying Fonts\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up Font Book (in /Applications/)\n\n*Select All\n\n*Go to the File Menu and select Validate Fonts. \n\n*Resolve any issues this may present, but those may be specific to your machine.\n\n\n\nUsually clearing the Font Cache works. I used to see a similar problem all the time with Microsoft Office 2004, and it had its own cache that we even cleared weekly. I haven't seen the Mac OS mess its cache up that often, but when it does, usually a quick fix. I have even seen a reboot sometimes clear it up (in very minor cases).\n\nA: I think jmlumpkin nailed it with clearing the font cache.\nFor what it’s worth, there’s a much easier way to clear the font cache for many people that doesn’t involve the Terminal, and that is by using Safe Boot. Once booted to the login screen, you don’t even need to sign in — simply restart, and use the computer normally.\n", "Q: How can I disable search suggestions for Safari 6? I have a lot of bookmarks, and I'm used to navigating by typing in the first few letters of each bookmark and using the arrow keys to select the correct one. In Safari 6, however, only the first two results are bookmarks, then there are around 7 search suggestions, and then the rest of my bookmarks. Is there any way to disable these search suggestions?\n\nA: In the Privacy tab of Safari preferences, check the box to Prevent search engine from providing suggestions.\n\n", "Q: Can iPad/Safari Pretend to be a Different Browser to Avoid Nag Screens? I'm doing more and more of my web browsing on my iPad these days. One of the downsides is that many of the sites I frequent force me to click through a \"please install our iPad app\" nag screen before allowing me to visit the site. At first it was just a few sites. Now it's becoming almost intolerable.\nApps have their place. I love Pinball, Words with Friends, Pages, Mail, Angry Birds, and Sling Player as much as the next guy. But if I have to install an app for every site I visit on a regular basis, I'm going to have to install like a dozen apps. Is there a way to get the iPad version of Safari to hide the fact that it's an iPad when communicating with web servers so as to prevent these nag screens from showing? If not, I'm going to have to revert back to doing all (most) my browsing on my laptop and iMac.\n\nA: Try the Atomic Web browser, it's UI is a little shoddy and not iPad3 retina ready, but the features are great. It can change the user agent to pretend to be other browsers, download files and then save them to Dropbox, and has a full screen mode. \nYou might also try Google Chrome for iOS, but I'm not sure if what User Agent that sends, I know it uses Webkit for rendering.\n", "Q: How do I move all my account settings from an old Apple TV to a new one? I have an old Apple TV (\"2nd generation\") and have just purchased a new one as a replacement. How do I move all my settings from the old one to the new one?\n\nA: I'm not aware of any way to migrate account information from one Apple TV to another. \nYou'll have to set it up as new: sign into iCloud, download + sign into apps, etc. It is a bit of a hassle but it doesn't take too long. \nI suggest using the iPhone app \"Apple TV Remote\" which enables you to type passwords via the iPhone keyboard. Also, Apple now offers single sign on for certain cable providers, you'll find this in \"Settings\" under \"Accounts\" I believe.\n", "Q: Connecting USB devices wake Mac running Mountain Lion only temporarily On Snow Leopard (10.6), I could wake my Mac by connecting a USB device - in my case, switching on a USB external HDD.\nNow, after upgrading to Mountain Lion (10.8), when I connect the USB device, the Mac wakes up and then immediately goes back to sleep.\nIs this a bug? Is there a reason for this new behaviour?\n\nA: Siracusa's review mentions this behavior, and it's been evolving since Snow Leopard:\n\nDarkWake has actually been around since Snow Leopard, where it was used to periodically send out a network tickler to ensure that a sleeping Mac doesn't lose its DHCP lease. In Lion, plugging in or unplugging a USB device could briefly put a Mac into DarkWake to reconfigure the peripheral bus before going back to sleep. Mountain Lion does all of the above while also carving out some time to get real work done while the master is away.\n\nDarkWake is the state the system is in when Power Nap is running.  In Lion, it would enter DarkWake to deal with processing the USB connection, then it would go back to sleep.  In Mountain Lion, when a USB device is connected, the Mac enters DarkWake to deal with processing the USB connection and also uses this state to do the various Power Nap tasks.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure this is intended, mine has the same behavior when connecting an iPod. I think this may have been changed on purpose. I know for myself every time I connected my iPod it bothered me that it woke my Mac up since I really just wanted to charge the device.\nSo I doubt it's a bug but rather intentional.\n\nA: Waking only for a short period after connecting or disconnecting a USB device is deliberate. Mac OS X 10.8, Mountain Lion, wakes long enough to set up or remove the device before returning to sleep.\nYour Mac will only wake when user activity is detected or when previously scheduled to wake.\n", "Q: Virtualization of OSX: Read-only main VM, delta stored separately? I would like to have a (Mountain) Lion VM that I configure in a specific way, and store that in a particular place on the the system hard drive. This is simple enough.\nHowever, I would also like VMWare Fusion to not write to that VM disk (making it essentially read-only), but only store the delta of the changes in a particular file that I specify. I would be ok using Fusion's snapping functionality if it can provide this feature. I'd also be willing to look into other virtualization solution, but already own Fusion.\nMy ultimate goal for this is: I'd like to have the delta stored on a mounted ramdisk (tmpfs).\nIs this possible?\n\nA: Regarding the mounted ramdisk (tmpfs), it is possible, see some example:\n$ hdid -nomount ram://256000  # 256000 (sector) * 512 (bytes/sector)\n/dev/disk1\n$ newfs_hfs /dev/disk1\nInitialized /dev/rdisk1 as a 125 MB HFS Plus volume\n$ mkdir /tmp/space\n$ mount -t hfs /dev/disk1 /tmp/space\n...\n...\n$ umount /tmp/space/\n$ hdiutil detach /dev/disk1 \n\"disk1\" unmounted.\n\"disk1\" ejected.\n\n", "Q: My home folder opens up Photo Booth when clicked on For some reason when the icon for the home folder is clicked it opens up photo booth.

I'm planning to buy a new high-end macbook air and found that there're different part numbers for the same product: MD232LL/A and Z0ND0002Z. What is the difference between these two? Is it just about the released country or do they have different specs actually?  \nI appreciate your help in advance!\n\nA: The two model numbers don't seem to refer to the exact same configuration. Model MD232LL/A appears to reference to the base model (as noted in Apple's MBA Model Identifier KB). The KB also notes: \n\nIf you have a custom configuration the Model Number and Configuration\n  in the table may not match. Please use the Model Identifier to confirm\n  the model of MacBook Air for custom configurations.\n\nOne example from Amazon - the specs include:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*1.8 GHz Intel Core i5 Processor\n  \n*256 GB Flash Storage\n  \n*4 GB DDR3 RAM\n  \n\nIn the page from Decide.com, the specs for model Z0ND0002Z include:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Core i7 2 GHz \n  \n*8 GB RAM \n  \n*512 GB HDD\n  \n\nIt's probably that the Z0ND0002Z model is used by retailers that provide more customization, since Apple uses the MD232LL/A model in its online KB. The excerpt from the KB also supports this conclusion.\n", "Q: Can I connect a projector with HDMI to my Mac Pro's DVI connector using an adapter?

Currently I have no way to know if my machine is being remotely viewed by our tech support, and would prefer to know, given the massive privacy breach that would entail should this be happening.

IT logged in, moved my mouse, viewed a few things and I thought, \"hang on, there's no indicator at all this is happening...\"\nThe other answers seem correct, however I had an additional thought - this checkbox.\n\n3rd one down \"Show when being observed\". This was unchecked, presumably from when my machine was originally set up. \nMy machine is <1 month old, a replacement/upgrade, I have admin rights but still need IT for a range of things. I was/am spewing that this was the default setting.\n\nA: I came here because I noticed my mouse pointer moving around in a distinctly human way without me moving my mouse. I realize this isn't strictly an answer to your question but it may help someone:\nIt turned out that my office Mac had previously been owned by other people in my office, and was still paired with their Bluetooth mice. Their mice sometimes connected to my machine and then they were waving their mouse around trying to figure out why it wasn't controlling their own computers.\nYou can unpair mice by going to the mouse settings and clicking the \"set up Bluetooth mouse\" button, then clicking the \"X\" next to devices you don't recognize as your own.\n\nA: Usually, if your mac is being monitored, if will show this image in the top right hand corner near your time:\n\nWhen that symbol appears, or a symbol that looks very similar to it, like a screen with binoculars in it, it depends on your system , you will be able to tell if you are being monitored.

If both of these are off then you can not Remote Control/View the Mac over the network through VNC.\nI hope that this information helps you keep your privacy safe.\n\nA: I guess the problem with the other two answers is that you may not notice the icon in the top right corner of your screen. \nWhat you need is an app that alerts you about any new connections. Little Snitch does this. Whenever a new connection is trying to be made with your computer, little snitch pops up and asks you if you want to allow it or deny once or forever.

Here are a couple to get you started:\n\n\n*\n\n*dict.cc Dictionary Plugin (German-English) \n\n*English to Latin Dictionary and Latin to English Dictionary\n\n*French Dictionary\nHere's what you do once you've downloaded the dictionaries you want:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to /Library/Dictionaries by doing this: Finder -> Go -> Go To Folder -> /Library/Dictionaries\n\n*Move the dictionaries from your Downloads folder to /Library/Dictionaries\n\n*Open up Dictionary and go to Dictionary -> Preferences and select the dictionaries you just added.\nYou can check out a bunch more dictionaries at this link: http://speedofmac.com/adding_dictionaries.html. \nHope this helps!\n\nA: It is also possible to change dictionary priority by dragging your dictionary to the top.\nAnd if you need a dictionary not provided by Apple then you can convert other formats to AppleDict as described here.\n\nA: Whichever dictionaries you enable in the Dictionary app's preferences will be available in the dictionary popover. You could either change these whenever you want to switch, or perhaps just leave both languages enabled all the time.\n\n\n\n\nA: You can re-order the dictionaries by dragging.\n", "Q: (new) Compiler for (old) XCode My OS X does not allow me to update to current XCode software.\nWith the new XCode and iOS SDK, the sourcecode is compiled with a newer compiler which has some new syntax options which are missing on my old platform.\nThat's why I need your help to get the new compiler to run with my XCode if possible.?

I have an old AppleScript script which did something like the one below to change the text without changing the styling attributes by setting the “text” property of the “text” of the “solid”. The AppleScript dictionary of OmniGraffle Pro says that the “text” property of a “text” is the “The actual text content.”\ntell application \"OmniGraffle Professional 4\"\n    set text of text of first solid of first canvas of first document to \"Hello\"\nend tell\n\nI am sure this used to work, but I've gone through a few OS X upgrades and OmniGraffle updates since last running that script, and when I try it now, I get an error.

I'm from a Linux background trying to get used to the differences with Mac OS X.  I've gotten resigned to the fact that to switch from one window to another I first need to switch Apps via CMD+Tab and then windows via CMD+`.  This isn't too much of a problem as the majority of my windows are under X11 anyway.\nHowever, there's a big annoyance with the window-switching (which, as far as I can tell, doesn't happen with the app-switching).  When cycling through the open windows, each one is brought to the fore as I cycle past it.  So if I have a dozen or so windows open in X11 and want to continually switch between two of them, it's next to impossible due to the fact that every window gets raised as I cycle between the two that I want (moreover, there's no intelligent ordering: the cycling goes on what appears to be launch-time rather than last-access-time which would be more sensible).\nIs there any way to fix this so that window-cycling only raises the one that I want and not all the ones I have to step over on the way?\nI don't mind if the fix is only for X11 (I'm using XQuartz, in case that's relevant, and am still on Lion).\n\nA: To continually switch between two windows use Command` and, to go back to the previous window, ShiftCommand`. I tested it with XQuartz and worked as expected.\nOtherwise: Can't you select the window you wish to bring to the front from XQuartz's Window menu? \nOther possibility is to use Hot Corners (introduced in OS X 10.3 \"Panther\") to show all application windows, then choose the one you need. There are plenty of guides out there, for instance http://heresthethingblog.com/2012/02/06/mac-tip-control-desktop-hot-corners/.\nBasically (in 10.7 \"Lion\" and later), you have to open System Preferences, select Mission Control and press the button Hot Corners... in the bottom. Then you can select a corner for action Application Windows.\n", "Q: How to tell Google Chrome to use my Keychain Background: \nStory: A colleague of mine told me about 1Password and it seems good to me. I am always trying to use tools which Mac OS X itself gives me, so I've given the Keychain a try. It seems satisfying, but I don't know how to tell Google Chrome to use my specific keychain. I need it to separate saved stuff for work and for private (syncing private to work, but separated from work data).\nStuff:\n\n\n*\n\n*Google Chrome 21.0.1180.57 (Fully updated)\n\n*Mac OS X Lion (Fully updated)\n\n*OS X Mountain Lion (Fully updated)\n\n\nQuestion: \nHow do I tell to Chrome to use a specific keychain and to save data from/to this keychain?\n\nA: Since v. 45 of chrome passwords are not synced to the OSX keychain anymore, the support has been dropped completely.\nhttps://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=466638\n\nRemove OS X Keychain integration for saved passwords\nStarting in OS X 10.9, Apple introduced the iCloud Keychain. This manifests itself as the “Local Items” keychain in Keychain Access. Items in this keychain are only accessible to applications with the keychain-access-groups entitlement [1][2]. This, like other iCloud entitlements, is “available only to apps submitted to the App Store or to the Mac App Store” [3].\nThe effect of this is that on 10.9 and 10.10, passwords stored in Safari are not accessible to Chrome (but passwords originated in Chrome are still shared to Safari)\n\nLater in the doc:\n\nAll the changes hit the 45 release. The plan is to get rid of the complicated Keychain code, thereby improving the robustness of the Chrome Password manager.\n\n\nA: This answer is no longer correct: OS X Keychain support is being removed from Chrome 45. See @patte8's answer for more information.\n\nAs far as I can tell, Chrome uses the keychain automatically:\n\nGoogle Chrome can save your usernames and passwords for different websites. The browser can then automatically complete the sign-in fields for you when you next visit these websites.\nThese passwords are stored in the same system that contains your saved passwords from other browsers. On a Mac, Google Chrome uses the Keychain Access to store your login information.\nSource: https://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95606\n\n(I'll leave the bit about choosing a specific keychain for Chrome to someone else, I don't know if that can be done)\n\nA: I've created small tool to deliver your credentials from Chrome into macOS keychain.\nHere is a page on github\n\nA: You'd better create another user: for work and personal.\n\nA: Well if you created a new keychain one for work and one for personal that would make your answer of missing all the passwords for chrome, you can have multiple different name keychains but mainly only one can be use per profile.  \nAs for the keychains yes chrome is getting rid of it and using the Gmail account sync feature to remember all your passwords and login, bookmarks etc.\nAs for the app 1password I switched from roboform (6 years) to 1password (2nd year) and I love 1password I purchased the pro version and this allows me to have work, personal, family, friends with their own passwords and links and each group you can designate a separate password so friends or dog can't see cat passwords or use it.\nHope this helps \n", "Q: No sound from iPhone speakers when connected to a dock with line out I've bought a (very cheap) dock for my iPhone 4, the dock has a line out jack on the back.\nI have noticed that when the phone is in the dock, the sound comes out only from the line out and not from the internal speakers.\nThis makes impossible to use any third party alarm application because no sound plays without connecting some external speaker. Only the ringtones play, so the default Clock app works and plays the alarm sound.\nIs there any software option to force the iPhone to use the internal speakers also when connected to a dock with a line out?\n\nA: No, it is a feature.\nI'm not sure if there is a fix for jailbreaked iphones, but there isn't such an option.\n\nA: When docked your the doc connector, pin 21 is connected to a resistor to tell the phone what type of dock you are connected to.

Tap the Share Button and then select the pics you want to delete and then tap delete.\n", "Q: How can I temporarily suspend some users, hiding them from the login screen? I have to manage a shared OSX workstation that is used by a rotating cast of characters throughout the year. The login screen quickly becomes cumbersome when users that aren't even around for a while are listed and cluttering up the clumsy horizontal scroll.\nHow can I clean up the login screen without nuking accounts that would need to get re-created at a later time?\nAdditionally, when somebody is gone for an extended period I would like their account to be locked so it can't be used locally or remotely, but I don't want to nuke users passwords, when they come back a quick admin action should get them back into the system again?\n\nA: Caleb's answer is correct and hides these users from the login window.\nHowever, at least on my installation of OSX 10.9 Mavericks, those users also vanish from the system admin panel, making it impossible to click them back to life. Futhermore, using chsh as a workaround does not help either, since it is not available on 10.9. \nI was able to bring them back using:\nsudo chpass -s /bin/bash <username>\n\non the command line.\n\nA: This can be accomplished using a feature of the unix based login system that assigns a program to run on successfully login. Normally users in OSX have their shell defined as /bin/bash. The OS login window will actually make sure people have a usable shell before showing them on the login screen.\nYou can disable a user — revoking both their ability to login and their appearance in the login window user list — by changing the shell to /usr/bin/false.\nThe settings is found in System Preferences -> Users & Groups -> (Unlock the settings if necessary) -> Right click on a user -> Advanced options -> Login Shell.\nRe-enabling the user is as simple as setting this back to /bin/bash.\nAddendum: In later versions of OS-X, restoring users deactivated like this gets slightly more complicated.\n\n\n*\n\n*Starting in 10.7, the users don't show up in the admin panel by default either. You can restore them manually by using the setting their shell using the standard Unix chsh command in a terminal:\nsudo chsh <username> /bin/bash\n\n\n*Starting in 10.9, the chsh utility is also not available, but you can set the shell using the an OSX special utility in the terminal:\nsudo chpass -s /bin/bash <username>\n\n", "Q: How to repair documents that display the “The document xxx.pages could not be opened” error when opened in Pages? I recently did a clean Mountain Lion install, after which I restored some important Pages documents from a backup HD.\nNow, when I try to open these documents in Pages, I get the following error:\n\nSomeone in this old thread on the Apple support forum suggested to use Disk Utility to repair disk permissions, as well as the disk itself, but that doesn’t seem to help.\nThe weird thing is I can still open these documents using my girlfriend’s laptop just fine. I tried opening the file on her Mac, saving it, then transferring it back to my laptop, but no luck — it still shows the error message.\nAny other ideas as to how these documents can be repaired?\n\nA: I ended up buying and installing Pages from the App Store; I was using an old iWork copy before. Sucks that I bought the same product twice now, but at least I could open my files after that.\n", "Q: Wireless Headphones Launching iTunes I recently bought a set of Logitech H800 headphones for my Mac.  Any time I connect them via bluetooth, iTunes launches.  Is there a way to stop iTunes from launching just because I've connected a bluetooth device?\n\nA: According to a thread on superuser, in the system preferences, disable launching iTunes for audio CDs will stop that.\n\nA: In System Preferences, disable launching iTunes for audio CDs.\n", "Q: How do I enable the Debug menu in Calendar? The following command entered in Terminal will enable the Debug menu in iCal (Lion):\ndefaults write com.apple.iCal IncludeDebugMenu YES\nI would like to accomplish the same thing in Calendar (Mountain Lion).\n\nA: A menu is most desirable, so this is not a proper answer, but here goes …\nWithout the debug menu\nIt's possible to do at least some of the things that were possible with the menu.\nTop sekret\nSome of the things that were in the Top Sekret submenu of the Debug menu in iCal …\nDays in week view\n5 or 7 days: Use the General pane of Calendar preferences. \n14, 21 or 28 days:\ndefaults write com.apple.iCal \"n days of week\" 14\n\ndefaults write com.apple.iCal \"n days of week\" 21\n\ndefaults write com.apple.iCal \"n days of week\" 28\n\nThe change will be effective when you next switch to week view. \nNew calendar window\n⌘+L is not effective.

However same scan on calendar's file from 10.8 doesn't show any of them, as a matter of fact this version is lacking more then few 'debug' commands that until this release were only hidden but still accessible. \nMy worst nightmare is slowly coming true, OS X soon will be just as closed as iOS is already :/\n\nIn case someone with more time, skills or luck will read it, you can try find something on your own with help of this post. \n\nA: I had Debug enabled in Lion, showing 2 weeks in iCal.  Upgraded to Mountain Lion and could't get it back to one week view until I found Mountain Tweaks.\nUnder the Lion tab (not Mountain Lion) I clicked to disable iCal Debug and it worked.  It's a free download but I donated to the developer.\n\nA: The debug menu was great because it allowed you to display the CalDAV queue of events. Calendar under Mountain Lion is not fully compatible with MS Exchange and has a tendency to hang in \"Updating…\". \nWorse, it gets into a mode where it cannot update the Exchange calendar at all and you must choose from a very DOS style \"abort, retry, fail\" sort of dialog. Once in that mode, your calendar will not talk to Exchange until you delete the Calendar's cache file. This Cache file apparently becomes corrupt and causes a discord between Calendar and Exchange. \nDeleting the cache file is no issue as Calendar just rebuilds it when Calendar is launched again. Don't forget to Quit Calendar before deleting the cache file, then launch Calendar to have it automatically rebuild. No data is lost.\nThe Calendar cache file is located here:\n~/Library/Calendars/Calendar Cache\nThis happens once or twice a day to me so I keep that folder in my dock and I keep an alias to the Calendar app in that folder so I can launch calendar, quit calendar, delete the cache file, launch calendar.  Welcome to Mac OS X… (sigh)\n\nA: OnyX is a great little program, and has an option to enable the debug menu for calendar. \n Alternitively, you could try com.apple.Calendar IncludeDebugMenu YES in Terminal, although I’m not 100% sure it will work.\n\nA: This isn't the answer you want, but I think the Debug option has really been disabled. However, I have filed a RADR to reinstate it in an upcoming dot increment (hopefully .2 or .3). \n", "Q: How do I limit calendar notifications to certain calendars? In Calendar, I have a number of \"iCloud\" calendars that I share with my wife.  (\"Family\", \"Me\", \"Her\", etc.) so we can see when we're both free/busy.\nWhile I do want to see her whole schedule on my calender, I don't necessarily want a pop-up notification every time she has a surgery. (I'm not a bad husband; she's a surgeon.)\nIs there some way to set different notification settings for individual calendars within a calendar account (in this case, iCloud)?\n\nA: In Calendar.app, you can right-click on any calendar, and choose Get Info.

Over four pages of reports on discussions.apple.com and it seems that iCloud is broken for notifications in this manner on iOS.\nThe people it affect most is married couples.  Ha.  One possible solution involves calling Apple support.  If you read through you will see on Oct 17th the person who was having the issue got a call back from Apple and they reset their Apple account.

I work on a Mac, but most of my users are on Windows. What's an easy way to test my websites in IE 7, 8, & 9?  Wine seems kinda buggy and unfriendly.\n\nA: The age old question for web designers…\nVirtualBox is awesome, but a pain to have multiple versions of Windows taking up space on your hard drive. Another option is using VirtualBox and only installing and running an app like ietester which is only available for Windows but allows you to render multiple versions of IE in one window.\nFinally, my personal option of choice is a website called browserstack, You have to pay for it but it's really cheap and well worth it if this is how you make your living. I also own a Windows laptop just for doing thse kind of tests but more often than not use browserstack instead.\n\nA: I have the perfect solution! In 2013, Microsoft released a free officially-supported solution to help Mac developers test with Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 on Macs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/\n\n*Select your desired testing OS (\"Mac\")\n\n*Pick a virtualization platform from among VMWare, Parallels, and VirtualBox. If in doubt, choose VirtualBox (which you can download from the VirtualBox site)\n\n*Follow the directions to download VMs for the version of IE + Windows you want\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Virtualization is definitely the way to go. There's VirtualBox as mentioned above, which is a free open source project. There are also two commercial offerings, Parallels and VMWare Fusion. Both of those have free trials so you can evaluate what might work best.\nIf you're wondering why to pay when VirtualBox is free, Parallels and Fusion are both commercially developed and supported software. If you run into problems, you can get help, rather than spend time searching for answers yourself. Additionally, VirtualBox is cross-platform, so it has fewer Mac niceties, and it's more of a DIY product - no quick setup or anything.\nBut you can make the call for yourself. TidBITS has a fairly recent article comparing Parallels and Fusion, with a good section on VirtualBox as well, and Ars Technica has a pretty comprehensive comparison of the latest versions of Parallels and Fusion.\nHope that's useful for you!\n\nA: http://www.spoon.net is fantastic tool and the reason I prefer it is it installs just the browsers, and side-by-side with your other programs in task bar. It works like a charm, however it is commercial, $12 a month, $60 per year. They plan to publish the app. on Mac soon.\nIETester is OK for some basic testing, but it doesn’t handle scripts correctly and therefore is not a 100% reliable testing solution.\n\nA: Just thought I would add to this as I just found a great new free tool to view IE on a mac. Download \"Sauce\" from the mac app store. I have been using Virtualbox the last two years and this is much easier to install, doesn't have huge VM files, and the interface is much smoother. Sauce also has the ability to preview in IE 10 (which is complete crap). There is also another cloud based app called browser stack. Tried the free version and the interface is nice but it does cost some $$. \n\nA: In addition to virtualization there's Codeweaver's CrossOver\nhttp://www.codeweavers.com\n\nA: *\n\n*Download and Install the free Oracle Virtualbox Virtual Machine software\n\n\n*Utilize the scripts noted in the OS X Daily article Internet Explorer for Mac the Easy Way: Run IE 7, IE8, & IE9 Free in a Virtual Machine to download, convert and install Microsoft's free IE Testing VMs to be used on VirtualBox.\n\nWe’re going to walk you through how to install Internet Explorer 7, 8, or 9 in a virtual machine running Windows, directly in Mac OS X – for free. This is achieved by using the freely available VirtualBox software from Oracle, and combining that with free Internet Explorer testing virtual machines from Microsoft\n\nHere is the scripts presented in the Article:\n\n...\nInstall ALL versions of Internet Explorer: IE7, IE 8, and IE 9\n\ncurl -s https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh | bash\n\n\nInstall Internet Explorer 7 Only\n\ncurl -s https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh | IEVMS_VERSIONS=\"7\" bash\n\n\n...\n\n\nA: I don't have enough reputation to post a comment on @Anirvan's answer which helped me greatly. I'd just like to add that Rey Bango's blog which advocates for security reasons to set Windows Update to automatic causes a problem since IE gets auto-updated as well! MS has created separate auto-blockers for IE 9 through 11. I downloaded all the auto-blocker scripts and created a wrapper to call them on Dropbox. Extract the contents of the zip file and run IE9-11_blocker.cmd to block IE 9 through 11.\n\nA: Probably not as professional as the other answers, but if one just wants to see how IE is rendering the site, the following options are free and work without any heavy installation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Google Chrome Extension IE Tab (Windows only)\n\n*Google Chrome Extension IE-On-Chrome\n\n*https://netrenderer.com/\n\n*http://browsershots.org/\nNote that none of them work locally (i.e localhost or 127.0.0.1).\nSimilar questions were asked in SO (here and here), but they are pretty old and the topics are closed.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Safari and navigate to Safari > Preferences from the menu bar.\n\n*Click on the Advanced tab.\n\n*Check the \"Show Develop menu in menu bar\" setting, then close the Preferences window. \n\n*The Develop menu should now show in your menu bar.\n\n*Go to Develop > User Agent.\n\n*Here, you have to option to choose different browser options like Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. You can also choose Firefox and Chrome as the User Agent.\n\n\nSource: How to view websites on your Mac that require Internet Explorer (or a PC) \n\nA: You can go through these ways to test IE on Mac machine\nAlso, you can use online platforms like LambdaTest, Sauce Labs or Browserstack to access Internet Explorer using Mac machine.\nSome software from the above link:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remote IE \n\n*Cross browser testing tool\n\n*Oracle VM Virtual Box\n\nA: A new, better answer.\nFirst I used virtual box.\nThen I used browserstack\nNow I use parallels\nAround for a few years but lately made robust and even friendlier.\nIt's even easier than the others, setup is easier, saving state is easier, keyboard-mouse integration is better.\nGenerally its better.\nOnly item of note is that it cost about $80\nwhich should be petty change for most developer who are paid that in an hour or two.

I'm going on holiday and downloaded some offline maps app, I was just wondering if the location services (GPS?) work without any data i.e Wifi for 3G on the iPad 2?\n\nA: Location services are based on GPS, you don't need Internet connection. \nNote that wifi-only iPads don't have GPS.\n\nA: Granted you have an iPad with GPS chip, the location services do work, but the iPad may take a bit longer to acquire the correct position. Apple explains this in a nice support article.\n\nA: Location services will only work without a data connection on the iPad WiFi+3G model. The WiFi-only version doesn't include GPS, the user’s longitude and latitude are determined based on their proximity to known Wi-Fi networks on these devices. So, location services on this model depend on the connection to a WiFi network.\nThe WiFi+3G models have a GPS chip and therefore work without any 3G or WiFi connection but the initial locking can take much longer in this circumstance. This is why Apple uses Assisted GPS, which uses proximity to cellular towers and WiFi networks first to get the location locking faster.\n", "Q: How can I have a fixed size wastpaper basket? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs there a way to limit the size of the Trash?  \n\nI'd like to have a way to auto-deleted item in the basket, based upon the time they come in (oldest to be deleted first)...\n\nA: You may be able to do this with a Folder Action. \napple.blogoverflow.com/2012/06/folder-actions-tutorial-automation-meet-the-filesystem/\nwhen new item is added, count items in folder, if number of items is greater than threshhold, delete oldest one. \nThis requires some knowledge of how the trash works...Something about the .Trashes hidden folders. \n", "Q: Install Mountain Lion on different Macs with different Apple accounts I'm pretty sure that the title is unclear, I'm going to explain it:\nWe have to update 11 Macs, so we bought 11 copies of Mountain Lion (from the online store, not the App Store) and we received the Redeem codes.\nWe have just a little doubt, we don't know if we can download just one installer and use it for every Mac we have or we have to download the installer (via the app store, using the code) for every Mac.\nCan you let me know?\n\nA: If the machines are on different iTunes accounts then it is possible to do one download and install it on all of the machines.

You need the tkinter package for your version of python in order for IDLE to work. You probably want py27-tkinter and py32-tkinter. Unfortunately, you'll probably have to go with the default xll version, the +quartz variant is not well maintained upstream. It won't build in x64 on Lion+ or with Xcode 4.4+ because it uses deprecated QuickDraw APIs which don't exist in the 10.7+ SDKs.

When I run the strings command on the executable file in most OS X apps (•.app/Contents/MacOS/•), I get a list of routine names, possible hidden preferences, etc. When I run the command on the Dock executable, I get garbage. What makes the Dock executable different from most other Mac programs?\n\nA: This is because many OS X binaries are encrypted. They are decrypted in real time by the “Don’t Steal Mac OS X.kext” in your /System/Library/Extensions. I don’t know why Apple does it. The Get Info string of the file:\n\nThe purpose of this Apple software is to protect Apple copyrighted materials from unauthorized copying and use.

If you have obtained a copy of this Apple software and do not have a valid license from Apple to use it, please immediately destroy or delete it from your computer.\n\n\nA: It is very common to compress and strip down a program that is an essential part of the system and runs all the time.\nStrings are left in for ease of debugging, but take up extra space that the computer does not need when running. It always is a trade off to decide whether to strip debugging information from an executable but in this case (or in the kernel or other core functions) can serve to optimize the execution speed whether or not it makes it slightly harder to debug issues or poke at the innards of a program.\nWe likely won't know the reason why this was done, but it is common practice to sample apps over time and select the ones that use the most of the CPU time so that you only optimize code that requires it as opposed to optimizing it all.\n", "Q: Google Calendar Delegates?

I just want all my calendars to appear under one heading, the Google one (like the incoming payments calendar in the image below)\nI'm not sharing any calendars with any friends or family and I still just can't work this out. Please help me find out where I'm going wrong.\n\n\nA: I stopped using Google calendars when iCloud came out, but from what I remember, the delegates thing is just a side effect of how Google implements additional calendars in the CalDAV protocol. I don't think there's anything you can do about it. The upside is that it doesn't break any functionality, it's just a bit annoying in how iCal displays them.\n", "Q: Wireless headset audio input/output I recently bought a Logitech H800 headset, and I'm having an interesting issue using it as an audio device via bluetooth.  First of all, it creates two audio output devices:\n\nThe first H800 device doesn't actually output anything, but the second one (with \"Stereo\") does.  However, while using the second one, the system insists on using the laptop's built-in microphone:\n\nIf I switch to the headset microphone, it works.  However, it automatically switches to the first (non-working) headphones output.  So, no audio.  If I go switch that one, the input automatically switches back to the built-in microphone.\nIs there something wrong with Logitech's device in this case, or is there something I can do in the scope of Apple that can help with this issue?  I would think the bluetooth connectivity is pretty standard across the board, so I'm hoping for the latter.  Essentially I currently can use either input or output, but not both.  Is there a way to force the devices to not automatically change when I manually change the other devices?\nFor reference, the headset also has a USB receiver for RF connectivity.  That works correctly.  It's just the bluetooth connectivity that has this issue.\n\nA: The Bluetooth standard has two profiles for audio with computers, A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) and HSP (Headset Profile). Your headphones show up as two devices because of this. HSP is monaural, but includes microphone input. A2DP is stereo, but doesn’t have microphone input. Ideally, on phones, when you’re listening to music and a call comes in, the headphones immediately stop playback and switch to HSP. When you hang up, the ‘phones switch to A2DP and continue music playback. You unfortunately can’t use both profiles at the same time, at least not without modifying the drivers.\n", "Q: Is there an app that just posts to Twitter and Facebook? I'm looking for a Mac (and/or iPhone) app that allows me to post to both Twitter and Facebook in one action. The trick is that I only want the app to push data.

It's a sweet, sweet client and with TweetMarker support you can open it, tweet a new tweet, and then close it down and it doesn't lose your position. It even syncs the position other TweetMarker-enabled clients.\nIf you're not willing to run beta software try Twitterrific -- also has TweetMarker support and also doesn't lose your position if you open, tweet, and then close it down again.\nIf you use one of these Twitter clients and combine them with an IFTTT recipe that reposts and tweet you make with the #fb hashtag to Facebook you'll be all set. Here's the recipe I use.\n\nA: Drafts -app here\n\nIt tries to connect different apps together but I would not count too much on it: they have no goal to add OCR -support, support for natural hand-writing and usability things for Twitter such as the 140 limit-display.\nEven though my initial impression was very bad about the app and its future development, it is quite cool app: it connects to Appigo Todo and many other apps.\n\n", "Q: Can I make my bootcamp partition bigger without formatting it? Is it possible to increase the size of my Windows partition without having to wipe the entire thing?\n\nA: Not with the built in tools. Moving the start of a partition is no trivial task. Resizing your main Mac partition only grows/shrinks it, but because your bootcamp partition resides further on your disk, it needs to be moved up before it can be grown. This is not a trivial operation and is not supported out of the box in either OS X or Windows.\nYou will need a specialised 3rd party tool like iPartition, but use with care and triple check compatibility.\n", "Q: How to make external disks reappear on desktop in Mountain Lion? After upgrading from Lion to Mountain Lion, my MBP does not show icons for external drives on the desktop any more. In the Finder preferences, “External disks” is checked under “Show these items on the desktop”. Any ideas?\n\nA: Somehow, the upgrade to Mountain Lion enabled the hidden Finder setting that completely hides desktop icons. You can reenable it using\ndefaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool true\n\n\nA: There's a much easier way of doing this. Go to Finder-->Preferences and the select the items you want to show on the desktop. Options are hard disks, external disks, \"CDs, DVDs, and iPods,\" and Connected servers.\n\nA: Aha! Just after posting my own frustration with this problem, and how none of the solutions provided here were working for me, I noticed one stray white pixel at the top left of my screen. Turns out it was the edge of the text name of a missing drive icon.\nIt appears that some drives are mounting with their icon at the screen origin (or possibly even further offscreen).\nTry using \"Clean Up By Name\" to bring the drive icon back onto the screen. If that fails, this might work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click anywhere on the desktop.\n\n*Type the first few characters of the name of the missing drive.\n\n*Hold the Shift ⇧ key and click on another icon.\n\n*Drag the second icon around and see if the missing one is coming along for the ride.\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem. After upgrading to Mountain Lion on my iMac, Finder would display my external hard drive icons on the desktop, but would not list them in any Finder windows, including upload windows opened by websites (ie blogs, Facebook).\nAfter viewing Xavi's Youtube link (thank-you Xavi! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8tqZSBs-4k), I discovered that Mountain Lion hides a number of items from appearing in your Finder window and sidebar by default. \nJust go to Finder>Preferences>General and look for the 'New Finder Windows Show:' option, and choose 'All my Files'. \nAlso, you'll want to go to the Finder>Preferences>Sidebar tab and make sure that your external drives are check marked, not ticked (-). Hope this helps!\n", "Q: How do I turn off new mail notifications in Mountain Lion? After upgrading to Mountain Lion, I'm receiving new email notifications.  I previously turned these off in the Mail application.  How do I turn them off now?\n\nA: In Mountain Lion, this is done in the Notifications under System Preferences.  Open System Preferences, select Notifications, choose Mail in the left pane, and then select \"None\".\n", "Q: ML Messages not connecting automatically to some accounts I love the new Messages app in Mountain Lion, but there seems to be an issue while using it with a Yahoo account. My Yahoo account does not reconnect after the machine goes into standby or after a restart, I always have to manually connect that account, while other accounts work fine.\nDoes anyone know of a way of getting the Yahoo account to automatically reconnect? An AppleScript that tells Messages to connect the Yahoo account would be great too.\nEdit: this seems to happen with my Gmail account as well.\n\nA: I found a sort of solution to this bug. What I did is write an AppleScript which tells Messages to connect all accounts when one of the accounts successfully connects. I use Messages with Gmail, Yahoo and Bonjour, so when either of those connects, it \"tells\" all other accounts to connect. It's not failure-proof, but it seems to keep my accounts online properly so far.\nusing terms from application \"Messages\"\n    on login finished for theService\n        log in service \"Yahoo!\"\n        log in service \"Gmail\"\n        log in service \"Bonjour\"\n    end login finished\nend using terms from\n\nUsage instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the AppleScript above to include the services you are using\n\n*Save it using \"AppleScript Editor.app\" to a .scpt file\n\n*Open Messages > Preferences > Alerts\n\n*Set the script to run for the \"When I Log In\" event.\n\n\nN.B. \nFor the line containing log in service \"<service>\" you will need to replace <service> with the value you find in the Description field for that particular service in Messages’ account preferences.

Ditto for the other services. \n", "Q: How do I open the javascript console in Safari 6? I just got a new Mac and it comes with Safari 6 installed. I've opened up the Safari 6 web inspector tools and now I can't find some of the tools I used before in Safari 5. \nIn Safari 5 you can press esc and have the console pop up and type in javascript. In Safari 6 I can't find it.\n\nA: The console still exists, but it has moved.\nClick the speech bubble tab at the top of the sidebar on the left side of the screen and then click on the Current Log entry in the sidebar.\n\nThe keyboard shortcut to jump to this tab is cmd+opt+c.\nNote that the quick console is always available at the bottom of the screen and can be enlarged by dragging its top border upwards.\nI recommend giving the About Safari Web Inspector a good read to familiarize yourself with the new Dev Tools.\n\nA: Open Safari and choose Safari > Preferences > Advanced.

Except that Dock doesn’t really function as it is supposed to. It shows up, but when I launch an application from it, it does not recognize that the application is running. The only app that it recognizes as open is Finder. \nAlso (and I’m assuming that this is coming from the same problem), when I do ⌘ + tab it only shows Finder as an open application (like the Dock).\nIs there a way that I can maybe restart the dock?\nThanks, Asher\n\nA: Other than a reboot, you can try the following in Terminal.app\n\nkillall Dock\n\n\nA: Start Activity monitor, select Dock, in the upper left corner is a red symbol that looks like a stop sign and is labeled quit process click this and a window will come up with the options to force quit, cancel or quit.

The directory that was dragged will then open in the application it was dragged to (if the app accepts the path). What happens at the low level?\nHow does the application know it can open that path?\nHow does Finder provide the application with the path to open?\n\nA: At a low level, everything on the disk is a file. So a folder is a special file that contains directory information pointing to more files.\nThe application is told that the file should be opened - and it's up to the program to determine what type of file was passed and decide whether to recursively handle that file by reading the files contained in that folder or take some other action.\nSimilarly, you can select many items in Finder and drop them on an icon and the same sort of file open event is posted to the application so that it can process the files and do what needs to be done.\n", "Q: Why won't my AppleScript run as a Service?

Since I'm not on Mountain Lion and therefore don't have Notification Center, I won't be able to use these new features. However, I do have Growl, and was wondering if there is some tweak or hack that I could use to forward these notifications to Growl instead. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: For Mountain Lion\nHiss goes the other way (sends Growl notifications to the notification centre in Mountain Lion).\nGrowl 2.0 is on it's way and they've developed a new piece of code they call MIST which will send notifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*to Growl if it's available; or \n\n*to notification centre if you don't have Growl.\n\n\nThis means if app developers use this code instead then people still on lion won't be unsupported.\nRead more here http://www.macrumors.com/2012/06/13/next-version-of-growl-to-add-notification-center-support/\nUpdate to ML when you can, it's awesome.\nFor Lion\nI don't think there's anything (right now at least) to turn notification centre alerts into Growl alerts. \n\nA: Anecdotal answer, but in my experience the apps that are being updated to support Notification Center are the ones that have always found notifications to be a useful part of the app anyway, and as such they have often supported notifications via other methods, usually Growl.  It's pretty much the apps that always supported Growl that are being amended to support Notification Center, usually in addition, not as a replacement.\nI doubt very much that anyone will ever bother to write a hack to forward NC notifications to some other system, but there's no reason technically why is may not be possible, it's more financially would it be worth it?\n", "Q: AirFlick Error: VLC not found I'm trying to play videos from my Mac to my Apple TV and am getting the error \"cannot proceed. vlc not found\".

I have an iPad on which I would like to view these photos. So far I have not found an elegant way to do so.\nI'm open to using any combination of client / server solution but I do have some requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*The pictures should be accessed directly from the server. No manual downloading or syncing back and forth.\n\n*The client app on the iPad should be designed to work well with pictures. There are literally thousands of File browser / file manager / file viewer apps on the iPad supporting every protocol under the sun, however I haven't seen a single one that delivers a consistently good user experience when it comes to viewing photos, specifically:\n\n*\n\n*Photos should be displayed in a thumbnail grid with reasonable speed\n\n*Going to the next and previous photos at a reasonable speed should not trigger a loading screen (ie. needs to be prefetched)\n\n*Large photos should not crash the app\n\n\n*Client should be a native iPad app or webapp with touch support\n\n\nThese don't seem like unreasonable requirements for a photo viewing app, in fact they pretty much seem like pre-requisites for anything displaying photos but maddeningly nothing I've come across seems to do the job. Many great apps exist for online services like Picasa, Flickr, and the now defunct MobileMe gallery, however I'm not interested in hosting these photos in the cloud due to privacy, cost, speed, and storage space concerns. It also seems silly: Why do I have to put my pictures on the internet just to see them on my iPad?\nIn order to meet the points in requirement 2. above, I'm thinking I can't simply share these over FTP/SMB/WebDAV/etc. I would need something intelligent running server-side that can on-the-fly send over thumbnail-size and iPad resolution images.\nTo that, end DLNA seems like a good fit. I have found a pretty decent DLNA server for the Mac, but I've yet to come across a well-made DLNA client for iPad. I've tried so many, but they all seem more focused on video not photos. Every iPad DLNA client I've tested has failed the 3 points under requirement 2. :(\nSee comments below on which apps I have already tried.\n\nA: I have tried several apps/servers but most of them are either not user friendly or have limited functionality. \nAirPics (yellowbek.com/airpics-app/) is limited to stream iPhoto and Aperture.

If she reads a message on her computer, it doesn't show as read on her iDevice and vice versa. She's with Bell/Sympatico, and from what I understand, Bell uses POP3 for its incoming mail and POP3 doesn't sync across devices. Are we hosed, or is there a way around this?\n\nA: POP is a pretty limited protocol. It doesn't do much beyond getting messages from senders and presenting them to clients (i.e. the iPhone and iPad) as requested. There's no syncing of state (i.e. read messages). Bell, like many major ISPs, only provides POP access, so your options are rather limited.\nI would suggest signing your friend up for Gmail, which offers IMAP (and far more storage than Bell). Gmail can be set up check her Bell account, so that all messages to it will funnel into that account. It's even possible to set things up so that messages can be sent by the Bell account via the Gmail account, so that everything appears as it did before to the sender (although I would recommend using the new address as much as possible - it's beneficial to not have an account tied in to your service provider for flexibility).\n", "Q: I don't want to lose my data on my iPhone, can someone help?

It would be really helpful. \n\nA: Just open iTunes, sign into the store, and you can download purchases directly from the store from your new Mac. No need to plug the phone into the computer and no risk of erasing your phone.\n\nA: So long as you are using the same Apple ID on your Mac as you are using on your phone then anything you purchase through iTunes will be available on both devices.

However, having to leave Google Chrome open and logged into Gmail is getting in my way...\nI was wondering if anyone has a way to get these calls to go to a VOIP app that is installed on the computer. Does such software exist?\n\nA: Use Fluid to create a site specific browser, log into gmail/gtalk uisng the mailbox of your google voice account.  Then convert the SSB to a Menu item.  That way it stays active and you never lose track of the soft phone - It's always on the menu when you want to dial or answer a call.  Oh, you need to add your google chat as one of the phones you use with Google voice.\n\nA: The telephone app in the app store is a great one to use, i'm using it in mountain lion and it works perfectly, was by far the easiest softphone I've ever set up. http://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/telephone/id406825478?mt=12\n\nA: If you use Google's browser, Chrome, then you can install the \"Chat for Google\" extension.\nBeside installing the \"extension\" through the Google Chrome Web Store it requires no configuration because it automatically signs you in unless you're already signed into your Google Account.\nIt only runs while Chrome is running, which is disappointing, so if you close Chrome that service will quit as well. But if you use Chrome as your primary browser I suppose that doesn't matter.\nAlso, it displays a window of contacts from your Google account, acting as a chat service. You can close the contacts list, but I'm not sure if you can silent the incoming chats (which is desirable if you use Messages for your chat client).\nI happily receive and dial calls from the application though!\n\nA: The Telephone App for OS X does work with both Sipgate One and CallCentric.  http://www.tlphn.com/  or Via the Mac App Store.  You'll need to set your Google Voice number to forward to the SIP number you register with one of those SIP providers.  It is a very good lightweight VOIP (softphone) app and it is free.  Blink used to be free but now it is no longer.\nA separate but quality non-free notification ($4.99) utility for Google Voice and OS X is GrowlVoice, http://www.growlvoice.com/.  It is quite similar to what Google offers for Chrome as the GV Extension (on Chrome Store) but seems to play more seamlessly with OS X and Growl notifications.  And it has the added benefit of always running in the system bar, so if you close Chrome you'll still see SMS notifications.  Telephone.app doesn't to offer this though, which would be nice, as a sort of integrated system bar icon to know when your GV/SIP phone is ringing.\nA third alternative would be to pay Skype for incoming/outgoing forwarding.  Skype \"Premium\" is $30 per channel for unlimited calling (in/out) so a total of $60/year to use it in both directions.  Skype of course is a bit larger and more cumbersome of a program and also has pretty bad contact management integration in OS X.  \n", "Q: What is the format I should write the command to SSH into Linux VPS? I am trying to use SSH and log in from the terminal into a Linux VPS.\nI have tried a few variations around the following:\nssh [user]@[hostname].[my.ip.address.xx]:22\n\nand keep getting:\nssh: Could not resolve hostname [hostname].[ip address]:[port]: nodename nor servname provided, or not known\n\nI have verified that my VPS works fine logging in from Windows with Putty, so I am sure I have something mixed up.\nWhat is the format I should write this SSH command in?\n\nA: Use a hostname, or IP address. Not both.\nThe hostname will only work if there is a resolvable DNS entry.\nThe IP address should always work as long as you use a publicly routed or otherwise reachable one.\nYou don't have to specify port 22, it is the assumed default when otherwise unspecified.\n\nA: If you want to use both hostname and ip adress use -W argument to set the host (ssh ip -W host:port)\n", "Q: How can I find where an app's files are stored? Besides the app's package, is there a way to find where it stores its other files from during installation?  Are they only allowed to install into the \"Library\" folders, or are there other places?  I want to wipe my drive and do a fresh install when I upgrade to Mountain Lion.\n\nA: Deleting the files from an individual app and doing a clean install of Mountain Lion are two different things. As per mckeed's answer, you can use AppZapper to delete an individual app, other alternatives being AppDelete or Clean my mac, although the latter could be a bit overkill for what you want.\nFresh install for ML is a different story though, I did a fresh install the other day and I'm super glad I did - I'm one of those people who just collects apps and files they don't need and everything gets a bit clogged after a while. Simple instructions to do so are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start off by backing up whatever you need (I know this ones a bit\nobvious), save anything you want to keep to an external harddrive.\n\n*You'll need to get your hands on another external harddrive or usb stick at least 8gb, and it has to be empty as we're going to use this to make a mountain lion boot disk. If it's not empty, don't worry we'll erase it in step 7.\n\n*Download mountain lion from the app store, but don't install it otherwise the app disappears and you'll have to re download it.\n\n*Secondary click (right click, whatever you want to call it) the install icon and choose \"show package contents\" from the menu.\n\n*When the contents of the install file are displayed you'll see a folder called \"SharedSupport\", open this up and you'll find a file called \"installESD.dmg\". Copy this file somewhere so you know where to find it.\n\n*Open \"utilities\" in your applications folder and open \"Disk Utility\"\n\n*Plug in your blank USB drive from step 2. You'll now see it in the left pane of the disk utility window, click on it to select it. \n\n*Click on the \"Erase\" tab in the main disk utility pane. Change the \"format\" dropdown to MAC OS Extended (Journaled) and then name your disk something that makes sense to you like \"Mountain Lion Install\". Click erase.\n\n*Click on the \"Restore\" tab in the main disk utility pane. In the \"source\" section, you'll need to navigate to and select the \"InstallESD.dmg\" file we copied earlier. In the destination tab you'll need to select your now clean drive. Click Restore.\n\n\nThe drive and your mac will now make whirry and buzzy noises for a while. When it's done cooking it will tell you. You now have a Mountain Lion boot disk.\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your computer with the new Mountain Lion drive plugged in still and immediately hold down the option key when it starts back up. If you've done this right, instead of booting OSX you'll see a picture of your drive to select. Click on the disk you created earlier to boot from it.\n\n*Now the scary part. You don't want to install just yet, somewhere on the screen there is an option for utilities, I think from memory it's in the top bar. Click utilities and select \"disk utility\" which looks alot like (actually exactly like) the disk utility app you used to make the disk earlier. This time, select your macs harddrive in the left pane and click the erase tab, make sure the format is set to MAC OS Extended again and click erase.\n\n*You've now erased your harddrive. Close out of the utilities window and continue the installation as normal installing Mountain Lion onto your newly clean Harddrive!\n\n\nHope all this helps, best of luck!\n\nA: *\n\n*Search for the application's name or bundle identifier with mdfind\n\n*Open fseventer before installing an application or opening it for the first time\n\n*lsbom -fls /var/db/receipts/somefile.bom\n\n*Press command-I after opening a package file or look at the bom file inside it with lsbom\n\nA: Unfortunately there are many places apps typically put files, and there are no restrictions to where they can (other than folder permissions).\nThe easiest solution is the third-party uninstaller AppZapper, which searches for related files, though nothing would be guaranteed to find everything.\n", "Q: Any text editors that are emacs-like in extensibility but Apple-like in visual aesthetic and design? Basically I want a text editor that is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Simple in visual design and uncluttered (like Byword)\n\n*Powerful and extensible like emacs (with hooks, etc, so I can customize it to my needs). When I say \"extensible\", I mean the more the better. I don't have a particular hook/extension in mind, but basically the closer to emacs the better. (I think of emacs as being the pinnacle of extensibility.)\n\n\nI know there's Aquamacs (which meets 2), but Aquamacs looks really ugly and not at all appealing (so doesn't meet 1).\nPlease make answers detailed! Explain why the text editor you are recommending fits this question. In what ways is it extensible? What nice UI touches does it have?\nThe goal here isn't to build a list of text editors; it's to compile information about exactly how various text editors are both well-designed and extensible.\n\nA: This might be too obvious, but what about setting up a Terminal window with a font and color scheme you find attractive (some are suggested, but you can customize to your heart's content)\n\nand then run… emacs.\nIt clearly meets your second criterion (it, by definition, has all the power of emacs), and as for the first, here's a comparison:\n\n\nThey look pretty similar. Choose a different font for the Terminal window if you want a better match. The biggest distinction is that Byword allows fonts that are not monospaced, but emacs insists on monospaced fonts.\n\nA: My personal favourite is textmate, there are loads of websites out there that detail how to easily customize it, and it's actually very easy. You can download themes and install snippets for code editing in a variety of different languages and the interface is clean and beautiful.\n\nA: Sublime Text 2 is actually pretty damn good!\n\nA: In the App Store, you can search for \"Text Wrangler\": it's the free version of BBEdit.\n\nA: Chocolat clearly wins on the native UI front. It works a bit like Sublime Text 2 but blends in more beautifully in OS X.\nAnd it has a neat way of adding extras, called Truffles. Most of the extras come directly from github and can be listed and installed with a nice window:\n\nYou have to see if it's still powerful enough for your needs depending on what exactly you want a text editor to extend with.\n", "Q: Wifi doesn't stay connected with 2010 MacBook Pro after upgrade to Mountain Lion After upgrading from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion the Wi-Fi on my 2010 MBP basically stopped working. It would stay connected for a few minutes at a time and then drop the connection, connect, drop, etc.\nMy Wi-Fi access point continued to work with all other devices - it just stopped working on this one machine.\nIt appears that this issue is also in Lion - there are many threads on discussions.apple.com with users complaining about similar issues:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4144707?start=0&tstart=0\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3191630?start=0&tstart=0\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3235078?start=0&tstart=0\n\nA: The only solution I found that actually worked was to replace the Mountain Lion Wi-Fi drivers with the ones included in Snow Leopard.\nNOTE: This solution is not for the faint of heart and please ensure you've backed up your system - at worst this should only bork your Wi-Fi (which I'm assuming is already broken if you're trying these steps) but it's better to be safe than sorry.\nInsert the Snow Leopard DVD into your DVD drive.\nOpen a Terminal:\nsudo -s\ncd /System/Library/Extensions\nmv IO80211Family.kext /Users/<your acct>/Desktop \ncp -R /Volumes/Mac\\ OS\\ X\\ Install\\ DVD/System/Library/Extensions/IO80211Family.kext .\n\nRun Disk Utility and Repair Disk Permission on your system drive\nRebuild the kext cache:\nsudo touch /System/Library/Extensions\n\nWait a few minutes to ensure that the cache has been regenerated and then reboot.\n\nA: I tried all the tips imaginable. The only solution was to set the channel on the wireless router on channel 11.\nIt seems to me, the Mountain Lion has a problem when the channel the router is in automatic, then every time the channel is changed, the connection of the wifi card of Macbook disconnects and reconnects.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion Notification Center glitches I’m experiencing a number of issues with the Mountain Lion Notification Center and Dock. Just wanted to check whether anyone else is having similar problems.\n\n\n*\n\n*On my 2011 iMac, the Dock doesn’t show up immediately with the rest of the desktop UI on startup. Also, the icons sometimes “fall” from where they normally sit on the dock and appear jumping out from the bottom edge of the screen.\n\n*A more serious issue: on a 2009 iMac, the Notification Center sometimes stops working completely and freezes other parts of the OS UI when called. The Dock becomes irresponsive, Mission Control cannot be called, spaces do not switch, Cmd+Tab doesn’t work. Basically, I can only interact with the windows on the current space and the menubar. To “unfreeze” everything else, I have to “Force Quit” the Dock process in the Activity Monitor (killall Dock doesn’t seem to work). Though still after that, any attempt to call the Notification Center will result in another “freeze”.\nHas anyone experienced anything similar? If yes, did you manage to find any solution and/or the cause of these problems?\n\nA: I'm having the same issue as Arnold. The problem might even be slighty worse for me; opun freezing, I can only use keyboard input; mouse clicks aren't registered anymore. I use QuickSilver to launch a terminal and running \"killall -9 Dock\" two times kills the dock and releases the mouse. After a couple of minutes the dock is relaunched. Also sending the HUP or INT to Dock will kill it. Sending the TERM signal doesn't though.\nI found that the problem can be circumvented by rebooting the system and after reboot ensuring that the first thing you do is to open the notification center. I think that by sleeping your mac without having the notification center open before that is what makes it crash.\nSadly, I didn't find any way to check what's keeping the Dock process busy. It doesn't seem to be the notification centre itself that's crashing (it keeps responding to mouse clicks while nothing else does) but the Dock. So far the only thing I came up with is that this is a problem with launchd, but that doesn't help a lot because killing launchd will kill every application you have running.\n\nA: I don't have an answer, but I am having the same exact symptoms as part 2. Also a 2009 iMac. I just noticed it a couple of days ago - everything was fine. Now when I click the notification center icon, everything freezes like you describe.\nWaiting about a minute or two resets everything and I'm back in business. \nI see there's a system update 10.8.1 - will try that install and see if it fixes.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Retina running Bootcamp with 2 external 27\" monitors I am wanting to buy a MacBook Pro Retina but am currently really nervous about doing so. I've read that everything seems to run well on the Retina and is usable as long as you have the latest graphics drivers and you bump the font to 150%.\nAll this is fine, but I'm worried about what happens when I plug in my 2 external 27\" monitors. The main question I have is will Windows want to run those 2 monitors at 150% font as well or can you set it up so its only on the laptops monitor that the scaling will take place?\nAlso wondering if drivers improved with Mountain Lion?\n\nA: If your MacBook Retina is running in 150 DPI then your external screens will run in 150 DPI as well. This is a no go.\nYou can run your MacBook in eg. 1920x1200 (or any other resolution). But because this is not native resolution it is grainy. Even running with perfect pixel doubling like 1440x900 is blurry (http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/59283/why-is-a-retina-macbook-running-1440x900-grainy-under-boot-camp). Like going from none-retina to retina (just the other way).\nI have been running with the retina under Boot Camp for many weeks now, and I've given up. Yesterday I ordered a MacBook Air and I'm selling my retina on eBay (Denmark). I'm pretty tech savvy... And everybody who says retina and Windows are great lies!\nYou can try this on your own machine before buing a retina. Just change the DPI on your current laptop and attach an external screen and try changing the resolution to a none native resolution.\nIf Windows are your main OS, don't buy retina! Period.\n\nA: I have a 2 x 24\" setup at work and Windows 7 via Bootcamp. You can't have all three displays (2 external and 1 MBP) usable at the same time since Windows won't allow setting a different DPI on a per-display basis.\nWhat you can do, however, is set resolution and DPI to work for external displays and use MBP display as an auxiliary space, maybe to move windows out of the way or what have you. Everything will look tiny on it, but you could find some use for it.  \n\nA: I'm pretty sure Windows cannot do per-monitor DPI settings, unless Apple have modified some drivers for it (pretty unlikely).\nThis answer from a sister stackexchange site backs that up: https://superuser.com/questions/29796/dual-monitors-on-windows-7-how-do-i-set-a-different-dpi-or-text-size-on-each-m\n\nA: I'm able to have different monitors at different resolutions if I use Oracle Virtualbox.  The great thing is that I can access my main MacOS hard drive (not read only like Bootcamp), and access all my files.\nI just never see a need to personally use Bootcamp with Virtual box.  I'll be able to test bootcamp on Monday when I get home\n", "Q: HD accidentally reformatted to MBR, how to get back to GUID? So in trying to create an MBR partition of my hard drive which I could then use to boot a solaris-derivative OS using rEFIt, I messed up. Rather than a hard drive with a primary GUID partition map scheme to boot OS X 10.7 from, and an auxiliary partition with an MBR scheme for non-Mac OS's, I now have a hard drive that strangely enough, is formatted with an MBR scheme. Additionally, the very helpful recovery HD is gone, and I don't think i'll be able to reinstall it (http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/19145/how-can-i-create-or-recreate-a-lion-recovery-partition), without a normally formatted HD.\nIn Terminal:\ndiskutil list\n    /dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0\n   1:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            500.1 GB   disk0s1\n\nIn Disk Utility:\nDisk Description : APPLE HDD HTS547550A9E384 \nMedia Total Capacity : 500.11 GB (500,107,862,016 Bytes)\nConnection Bus : SATA\nWrite Status : Read/Write\nConnection Type : Internal\nS.M.A.R.T. Status : Verified\nPartition Map Scheme : Master Boot Record\n\nNot surprisingly, this initially caused some problems in that neither Macintosh HD nor the Recovery HD were being seen by EFI, but I was able to erase the hard drive, and restored my OS via Time Machine.\nThis leaves me in a tenuous situation. Messing with partitions and such is always risky business, and if anyone can come up with a reliable and trusted method for returning my HD to its native GUID'ness, it would be much appreciated! As I have a Time Machine, I'd be totally ok with completely erasing my HD and reinstalling lion. \nEDIT:\nsudo fdisk /dev/disk0\nDisk: /dev/disk0    geometry: 60801/255/63 [976773168 sectors]\nSignature: 0xAA55\n     Starting       Ending\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1: AF 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -  976773167] HFS+        \n 2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n 3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      \n 4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused\n\n\nA: As your Partition starts on sector 1, there is no space for a GUID partition table, which requires 2 sectors between the MBR (sector 0) and the start of the first partition as a minimum. You could try to move the partition with a specialist tool (the tools that come with OSX only let you change the size of a partition, not the starting position). \nHowever, as you're OK with re-installing the OS, I suggest you make sure everything is backed up via Time Machine, then boot from the OSX installation stick. Open up Disk Utility before starting the installation, select the whole drive and open the \"partition\" tab. Repartition it from scratch by selecting \"1 partition\" (or however many you want) from the \"partition layout\" dropdown. Before you apply the changes, click the \"Options...\" button and choose the GUID Partition Table scheme. Then apply the changes (obviously, this wipes the disk) and restore OSX to the newly created system partition. This will create the GPT, protective MBR and EFI System partition.\n", "Q: How to install Mountain Lion on a disk that cannot be formatted in recovery mode? I'm trying to do a clean install of Mountain Lion but I'm not being able to format my partition.\nI previously had Lion, encrypted the disk, then upgraded to Mountain Lion, then booted into recovery mode to format & reinstall Mountain Lion.\nOn recovery mode (Cmd+R), when I tried to format the encrypted partition I got an error saying something like \"not enough space on core something\". Now the partition doesn't show up on Disk Utility; only the disk, \"Macintosh HD\", but I am not able to repartition it.\nThe Mountain Lion installer doesn't find any disk to install itself on.\nI cannot boot the system either (without booting to recovery).\nIf I open the terminal and type diskutil list I can see that there's an Apple_CoreStorage on /dev/disk0s2, but I cannot reformat that volume (\"The disk is in use by Core Storage as a Physical Volume\").\nHow to format the disk and install Mountain Lion?\n\nA: You should be able to use dd to destroy the partition's header. You can then format (erase) it and run the install.\nFrom the installer run Terminal and type the following:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk0s2 bs=1024 count=1024\n\nDo be warned, this will irrecoverably destroy all data on that partition. But it looks like that's what you're expecting. Make sure you don't accidentally target the wrong thing.\nAlso note that I haven't done this, exactly. I've used this technique to destroy the entire partition table, not just a single partition. But I think it should work.\nWhen you're done quit Terminal and run Disk Utility. You won't get any complaints about Core Storage.\n\nA: When the Partition tab of Disk Utility in Mountain Lion can not manage a partition on a physical disk that uses Apple Core Storage:\nIgnore the Partition tab\nInstead of selecting the logical volume group (to the left): \n\n\n*\n\n*select the encrypted logical partition (to the right of, and below, the LVG)\n\n*use the Erase tab. \n\n\n\nWhat techniques for disk, volume and file system management are possible with OS X, but troublesome within Disk Utility?\nIn particular: \n\n\n*\n\n*a physical disk may be invisible.\n\n\nA: Without destroying all partitions/slices of the physical disk:\nUse the coreStorage verb of diskutil\nTo delete the logical volume group that is no longer required:\n\n*\n\n*get the UUID of the group\n\n*run a command based on the following format:\n\ndiskutil coreStorage delete lvgUUID\nIf a logical volume within the group is mounted, it may be necessary to unmount before attempting destruction. Also maybe necessary to use sudo … sorry I can't be more specific, it's a couple of weeks or so since I last performed an action of this type .\n\nA: Check out this solution: \nOS X Mountain Lion “clean” install gotcha: CoreStorage / Encrypted Disk issue\nBasically, you need to run diskutil CoreStorage list from Terminal. Identify the logical CoreStorage volume from that list and note the UUID string. \nThen type diskutil CoreStorage delete UUID where UUID is the string you identified. \nYou can then partition with Disk Utility and run a Mountain Lion install. \n", "Q: What's the difference between real memory and CPU, and what are there effects on the performance of my computer? In Activity Monitor, there are a couple fields: \"PID\", \"Process Name\", \"User\", \"%CPU\", \"Threads\", \"Real Mem\", and \"Kind\". I'm not familiar with the inner workings of computers and the related technical terms, but I've always thought the \"%CPU\" and \"Real Mem\" would be synonymous. However, when I look the running processes in Activity Monitor, I see this:\n \nEvident from the image, \"Real Mem\" and \"%CPU\" are not synonymous.\nWhat's the difference between real memory and CPU, and what are there effects on the performance of my computer?\n\nA: CPU is the Central Processing Unit. It's an Intel microprocessor. It performs calculations (or more precisely, computations).\nMemory is temporary data storage space used by active processes being executed by the CPU.\nIf we were talking about cars the CPU would be the engine and the memory would be the seats (or possibly the cup holder).\n\nA: To answer your question about performance, it really depends on what you're wanting to do. \nCPU: To put it simply, CPU speed defines how quickly your computer can process data. \nAs you're asking the question in a Mac forum I'll assume you want to by a mac. The most basic MacBook Air laptop has 1.7GHZ dual core processor, which means it has two 1.7GHZ processors. For basic computing this is more than enough, but if you wanted to do something a bit more labour intensive, say photo editing or graphic design or high end gaming, it'd probably be a bit slow. \nIf you look at the slightly more advanced machines apple has on offer like the macbook pros or the iMacs then the processors are more in the 2.5GHZ - 2.9GHZ range, this is plenty for most high end applications.\nFinally the top of the range machines are the Mac Pros. They have quad core, 8 core and 12 core options upward of 3.2GHZ. These are great machines if you have the money and will make photoshop run a little faster, but not really a necessity unless you want to do some really high end stuff like Animation or complex video editing.\nMemory: Memory consists of what can be considered your long term memory (your hard drive) which is sometimes called \"storage\" and your short term memory or RAM (stands for Random Access Memory if you're geeky enough to be interested) which is what the term \"memory\" is normally referring to.\nRam controls how much your computer can store in the short term to process. Most basic PC's and the most basic macbook airs come with 2 gigs of ram nowadays which is more than enough for basic applications. However, again if you're looking to do photo editing or graphic design or online gaming then you really should be looking at between 4g and 8g otherwise your computer won't have enough memory to process lots of different functions at the same time.\nAnd of course, if you're a budding Peter Jackson about to make the next lord of the rings film and you need to be able to render an army of mediaeval monstors, then the mac pro ranges from 16g to 64g of ram.\nHope this answers your question better.\n", "Q: Connect to MySql over Airport Wireless LAN I have installed MySql on a Mac Mini that I want to use as a dev database server.

I am using the root user with no security at all (hey, it's a toy database), but cannot connect as the Macbook is not allowed to connect.\nWhat do I need to do to configure my WLAN so that the client can see the server?\n\nA: *\n\n*Open terminal.\n\n*Type ifconfig\n\n*Find something like inet 192.168.1.100 netmask\n\n*192.168.1.100 is local ip of your machine in your WLAN.

I downloaded Mountain Lion from App Store and installed it.\nI have not set Time Machine and I installed Mountain Lion one hour ago (since posting this question).\nThe dmg file is not in Applications folder anymore.\nHow to recover Mountain Lion's dmg file after installation?\n\nA: After Mountain Lion is installed, your Mac auto-deletes \"Installer Mountain Lion.app\". So before installs or upgrades like that, you must make a backup (compress it and move file compressed to anywhere, where you put storage data).\nAnd now, you need to download \"Installer Mountain Lion.app\" again from the App Store.\n\nA: If you open the app store, you'll see the purchase button next to Mountain Lion now says \"Download\", or you can find it in the purchases section. You have to re-download it but at least you don't have to pay for it again ;-)\n\nA: Yere if you download the app its invisably stored into your MacBook\n", "Q: Why is Mountain Lion more security conscious? Whenever I open an application not downloaded from the App store (or a trusted vendor) I get a warning.\nThe warning reminds me a bit of the awful window popup that comes up every time you want to open an executable that says something to the effect \"are you really sure you want to open this?\".\nWhat else about Mountain Lion makes it more security conscious?\n\nA: Apple computers have long been considered \"virus free\" although Apple stopped pushing this as a selling point earlier this year in the wake of several Apple targeted viruses.\nThe truth is that a virus can be programmed for mac much like a software application can, the reason for the lack if infections on mac was merely the same as the reason for lack of some apps in the past, the relative unpopularity vs windows machines meant it was less practical to program for mac.\nWith macs now being more popular than ever before, Apple now has to implement strict measures to hold on to their clean, virus free image, hence Gatekeeper being added to Mountain Lion.\n\nA: The process which is checking for permission to run apps is called GateKeeper.\nAs per the following System Preferences screenshot, you are able to configure how it behaves.  You can allow it to allow anything to run, only MAS apps to run, or a mixture of MAS apps, and known developers:\n\nThe idea for increased security is obviously because security is very very important.  It's important for you, to know that you can trust the apps that you use, and it's important for Apple, to know that they can kill apps that they subsequently become aware are malicious or dangerous for users to run.\nOnce you accept an app to run, it's signature is added to an internal \"whitelist\" such that you only need to be asked once in order to allow an app to run.  If you use the default setting (as per screenshot) you can still run any app by right clicking on it's icon and clicking open.  This will require subsequent confirmation, but again once you have confirmed it once, you are good to go until such time as the apps signature changes (updates etc).\n\nA: Running applications from other sources is more dangerous.  It is natural to warn you about the risk of doing so.\nYou can change Mountain Lion's behavior when running apps from unidentified sources by using the Security & Privacy preferences; see this part of Ars Technica's monster review of Mountain Lion for more.  However, changing this setting may not be the wisest move, as it increases your risk exposure level.\n\nA: The vast majority of computer malware gets run when users are not aware they have allowed downloaded code to run, so Mountain Lion adds a second check to the first one that was added on Snow Leopard.\n\n\n*\n\n*GateKeeper - prevents non-signed and/or non-system apps from running\n\n*Launch Services Quarantine - prevents new apps from running until cleared\n\n\nIf you are OK with not being prompted when code that isn't signed, you can disable GateKeeper from it's preference pane.\n\nThe Launch Services quarantine warning can also be disabled with a short terminal command if you would rather not see that dialog:\ndefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSQuarantine -bool NO\n\nApple computers come with an implicit as well as explicit contract that Apple employees will help users with software problems (time and location limited of course), so adding features that help users not need malware removal help is clearly in Apple's interest even if you don't subscribe to the view that OS X is designed with the user's best interests to prevent malware or other surprises from getting a chance to run.\n", "Q: Is there an app for iPhone to record the audio output streaming of any other app ?

I can log into accounts 2 and 3, but only if I switch user whilst logged into account 1.\nAny ideas? Very confused and I don't know enough about how user profiles are built in osx to know what to look for.\n\nA: Your first triage step is to isolate software from hardware. You could install ML clean on an external drive and see how it works or just erase your Mac and reinstall. Once you've concluded the hardware and base OS is stable, you can try the migration / restore from backup again or start narrowing down software corruption as a cause.\nAssuming you can make the kernel panics happen - once you have 4 or 5, the stack trace should point to a pattern of where the system is having problems. If you can't reproduce the panic, then you may just need to clean up from a hard landing by restoring from a time before the unlucky crash.\n\nA: Some questions come to mind.\n\n\n*\n\n*Do any of the user accounts have FileVault enabled? Some FileVaulted user accounts may have been slightly damaged during the panic.\n\n*Have you tried\nto boot into Safe Mode?

Without purchasing it? I don't have a Lion license and I'm currently running Mac OS X 10.6.6 (Snow Leopard).\nIf I buy Mountain Lion, can I downgrade to Lion?\n\nA: If you buy Mountain Lion, your computer downloads an installer for Mountain Lion from the app store. If you were somehow able to buy a copy of Lion later on (which Apple does not seem to be selling in the App store), you could install it on your computer (\"downgrade to Lion\"), but buying Mountain Lion does not get you access to such an installer.\n\nA: No OS X Lion license if you don't already have a OS X Lion Purchased in the Mac App Store prior to the release of Mountain Lion.\nThat means that you can't buy OS X Lion now from the Mac App Store even if you really wanted to do so. So when you buy Mountain Lion, all you obtain is the Mountain Lion Installer and license. \nIf you must have Lion your only legal easy recourse is to try and find one of the official Apple Lion USB install media.\nAnother probably not so easy option is to contact Apple and see if they can work some magic to allow you to purchase Lion, but as far as it goes you would have to purchase Lion, your not going to be granted access to a prior releases based on purchasing the current release of OS X.\n", "Q: Is it possible to order a new Mac mini with an Nvidia graphics card?

After recently upgrading to Mountain Lion, I had no problems with my settings or personalization of my environment.  However, all of a sudden (yesterday) and for no reason I've been able to discern, Safari (and Safari alone) is now minimizing to the dock in a very different way.\nWhen the application is visible, there is no dock icon. And when it minimizes, it minimizes to the trash-side of the dock with a preview, instead of simply minimizing to a dock icon like everything else.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*What might have caused this?\n\n*And, more importantly, how can I set it back to behave like other applications?\n\n\nA: Minimising into the right hand side of the tray is pretty much the norm for so called \"document based applications\", whereby an open application may well have 1 or more windows (or \"documents\") open.  This allows each individual window to have it's own minimised icon, with a preview based icon to allow you to distinguish between them.\nApplications which are not multiple window based, things like say Disk Utility etc, usually minimise to the application icon instead, and even if (like Safari) they do have multiple windows, then clicking the dock app icon should take you to the most recent window if it's not merely the only one.\nEither way, your running applications icon for Safari should remain in the dock, although I have to admit that mine also went missing recently, although I can't recall if this was pre or post ML.\nA reboot should fix it, as it seem to me to be a transient fault, but if you are familiar with Terminal.app you can type the following in to restart the Dock process, which should clear out any such gremlins:\n\nkillall Dock\n\nYou can also force document based applications to only minimise to the dock icon and not produce per-window icons on the right hand side of the dock in System Preferences:\n\n", "Q: How to set screen resolution with a keyboard shortcut on Retina MBP?

Relaunching it wont prompt with the usual suspects: \"Ignore\" and \"Report to Apple\".\n\nA: A common reason for an application crash is a corrupt preference file. The first thing you'll want to try is backing up and deleting your preference file for Safari.\nClose Safari, and then you can find the preference file by going to ~/Library/Preferences and looking for the file called com.apple.Safari.plist. Once you've found the file, back it up by adding a tilde to the front of the file name so it becomes ~com.apple.Safari.plist. Once you restart Safari, it will generate a new .plist file.\nIf that doesn't work, the next step would be to do a permissions repair using Disk Utility, which you can find in /Applications/Utilities.\n\nA: Disappearance of Safari without a crash\nThe browser may disappear without crashing. \nFirst, for the time of the disappearance, seek a matching .crash file for Safari… or WebProcess… at the following path: \n~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports\nIf no .crash file around the time of the disappearance, then use Console to see whether the following line was logged a second or two before the disappearance: \nReceived an invalid message from the web process with message ID 323002f\n\n\nA: If you're using a proxy: this might be related to proxy settings in combination with WebSockets, as also noticed on Meta Stack Overflow. Though there it was reported for Mountain Lion, and it did show the option to send a crash report, and hence find some more details. Still then, maybe the symptoms are the same?\nThe blog post Networking Crashes In Mountain Lion and its comments blame crashes that refer to \"CoreSchedulingSet::copyWithUpdatesReleaseSelf\" to either the \"Auto Proxy Discovery\" and \"Automatic Proxy Configuration\" settings, or a VPN connection.\nSome more investigation on 10.8, with only \"Auto Proxy Discovery\" enabled, without restarting Safari:\n\n\n*\n\n*Safari 6 often crashes for Stack Overflow, but only when logged in. Super User crashes much less often, but also shows the issue. When not logged in, all is fine.\n\n*Going to websocketstest.com often (but not always) crashes Safari right away.\n\n*Going to the Echo Test on websocket.org seems less troublesome. Repeatedly connecting and disconnecting might not cause trouble, but it too will crash at some point.\n", "Q: How can I directly access apps with single hot-keys? How can I directly access apps with single hot-keys?\nPossible solutions which I don't get to work:\n(1) Having often used applications constantly kept in the dock, it would be useful to have hotkeys like Apple-1, Apple-2, Apple-3, etc to access the first, second or third icon in the dock.  I am aware of Crtl-F3, but it requires left and rights to get to the wanted icon.\n(2) I tried to define 'workflows' that launch apps and assign the corresponding services hotkeys, but that didn't work in all applications.\nI know Apple-Tab.  However, depending on the other opened programs the keys to press to get to a specific application is always different.\nAny solutions?\n\nA: There is Free app in the App Store, so far so good:\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/hotkey-app/id975890633?mt=12\nIt even has a super convenient Toggle visibility of application option\n\nA: I would highly recommend Alfred.  It is the best app launcher/spotlight replacement I have ever used. \nIt allows you to use GLOBAL HOTKEYS that can be programmed to do anything you could ever want, launch scripts, open apps, run apple/bash scripts, etc. These hotkeys work in most every application you are in because they will take precedence over other apps, just be sure not to assign a hotkey that everyone uses like Command + S.\n\nUsing the box above, you can set Command + Option + Control + S to open/toggle to Safari. And when you press it, its super fast and responsive, so you're not waiting for a workflow to execute and finally finish for anything to happen.\nIt is free to try out and only 25 buck to activate all the super advance features and it is highly customizable, you can even sync your launchers and scripts and hot-key preferences between computers using Dropbox.  That is what I do.\nThere are other pieces of software out there that do similar things and just hot-key stuff, but this package has it all and works really well in Snow Leopard, Lion, and Mountain Lion. It also has plenty of plug-ins and scripts that you can download that other people have made.  Worth checking out since its free to download from their websites to try.\nI hope that this helps you out.\n\nA: There are more than a few options out there, but I would recommend Keyboard Maestro. It's a pretty powerful program that allows you do do all sorts of different scripting and macro tasks, as well as configure hot keys. I use it to make more advanced hot keys configurations than System Preferences can do, as well as run scripts, handle my extra mouse buttons (I can configure them on a per-app basis without extra drivers).\nI suggest you download the trial and test it out. It will certainly do what you need, but you may find it useful for many other things.\nOne thing I do suggest when you try it out is to disable all the default macros, as they can be a bit confusing and override default system behaviour. Then take some time to figure out what it can do and what will be useful.\n", "Q: How can I get Network drive shortcuts added to the Finder sidebar in Mountain Lion?

If you eject the network folder then re-connect it will appear in the sidebar but next time you login it will be gone.\n\nA: Thanks for the answers. This is definitely a bug that hopefully Apple will fix!!\nThe solution that works for me (more of a workaround) is that you need to have a finder window opened before you mount any network shares. \n\n  \n*\n  \n*Drag your network shares to the 'Devices' section in the sidebar (they wont stick this is ok for now)\n  \n*Close all programs and windows\n  \n*Open a new Finder window ⌘N (doesnt matter where)\n  \n*Log off then log in again (you dont need to reboot)\n  \n*Viola!\n  \n\n(On some machines with lots of startup items, I dragged 'Macintosh HD' into the list before any items to mount shares.)\nThis has worked for me on multiple ML machines using regular SMB shares, and software managed shares (AvidISIS). \nUnfortunately you still do need to remember to keep a finder window open when you shutdown. But in our case most machines stay on, and if I have to reboot or i suffer a crash then it takes less than 20 seconds to open a finder, log off and log back on again.

Under \"Show these items on the Desktop,\"enable the option for \"Connected servers.\"\nConnect to the server volume(s) you would like to automatically mount at login.\nOpen System Preferences.\nSelect the Accounts preference pane\nUnder your user: Click the Login Items tab.\nDrag the volume(s) from the Finder into the Login Items list in the System Preferences window.\nLog out and log in again. Wait about 5-20 seconds for it to show up in the side bar.\nTaken from http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4011?viewlocale=en_en\n\nA: By default it doesnt mount any network drives or shared folders. Just add those drives or folders to your login items under users & groups.\n\nA: This can be easily achieved with the auto mounter. Try this http://www.dforge.net/2012/08/07/create-a-permanent-smb-mount-in-osx/\nand then after you have clicked on show connected servers in finder options/view options. you can drag the shortcut to the sidebar. Another solution would be to edit the sidebar.plist. Read this http://tim.lings.me.uk/tag/network-drives/\n\nA: You can't add a network share shortcut to the sidebar anymore. \nIn OS X 10.8 and up, network shares are listed by server connections. \nThis prevents the user from using different credentials on the same server which is not a good idea. \nIn finder preferences you may select the connected servers option to list connected servers.\n\nA: I am assuming this works in previous versions of OS X, but on macOS Sierra you can create an alias of the network drives and add the aliases to the sidebar. If the drive is not mounted, clicking it will also mount the drive. Since it is an alias, it should persist between reboots so long as you dont delete it from your local drive.\n", "Q: Where are Safari 6.0 passwords saved? Prior to version 6.0 Safari had no features for managing passwords distinct from the system wide support provided by Keychain:\n\nbut Safari 6.0 adds a new tab in its Preferences dialog for saving and managing passwords for websites:\n\nDoes this change correspond to a change in locations for storing or rules for managing the security of passwords? Are Safari passwords still stored securely in the Keychain or are they in a new, separate store? \nWhere are Safari 6.0 passwords saved?\n\nA: The passwords are still saved in the Keychain, and not a separate 'new' location. Safari 6 just includes a new front end for accessing them directly without having to go to the Keychain Access application.\n", "Q: Should iMessage not be silently updating my phone when I'm at my Mac? I've been using iMessage with a friend of mine over the past two days. When I get the message on my Mac, I also get the message on my phone. That's great, BUT why all the alerts and buzzes on my iPhone? It's very annoying.\nShould iMessage not see me receiving the message on my Mac and silently update my iPhone?\n\nA: No, it doesn't (yet) have any methods of muting alerts on other devices even when it has reason to know that the alert has been read etc.\nI'm sure that it will arrive soon, but as it stands every device is treated independent of each other with regards to notification settings, or to put it another way, notification are \"device independent\", and you are waiting for them to be treated as \"notification independant\", as it were.\n", "Q: How to allow users to reset passwords in Time Capsule accounts? I have a Time Capsule that I share with others in the office. I control the base station and create accounts for others to backup their machines with Time Machine i.e., using\nAirport Utility > Time Capsule > Disks> Secure Shared Disks — with accounts\n\nI create accounts and a password for them (or they're free to enter it on my machine), but I also keep getting requests for password resets or changing passwords, which makes it a pain — people need to come to my machine to do it. \nIs there a way to allow users to change their passwords whenever they choose from the convenience of their machine?\nI'm using the Time Capsule with Mountain Lion (as are most others, and some with Lion).\n\nA: No - this is a big admin bottleneck if you aren't going to set up a machine to re-share the disk or just share files and back up to the disk so you can have more of a server based permissions and account management toolset.\n\nA: I'm sure this is long-resolved, but you can use the Time Capsule setting \"Secure Shared Disks - With Disk Password\" instead of using Accounts.\" And Mike is right about Mac OS X Server and Access Control Levels for Users. Just remember, Passwords for anything should be changed on a regular basis.\n", "Q: Can we upgrade PowerPC Macs to OS X 10.7 now that 10.8 is out? I know that 10.8 is out now, but we have older Macs that will not work under 10.8, as they do not have Intel processors. Can we still buy and get 10.7, which I believe will support older CPUs? \n\nA: Although you can no longer buy Lion through the App Store or directly by SKU from the online store, you can still order Lion after Mountain Lion was released.\nI called 1-800-MY-APPLE, it took some time to get through but they told me that I would be able to purchase Lion, OS X 10.7 from them for $19.99.  They would send me the physical copy through the mail.\nBe careful to understand the return policy if you are not certain your Mac can run Lion. OS X Lion 10.7 is only supported on Intel Processors, Intel Core 2 Duo and higher and Lion will not work on PowerPC (PPC) Macs.\nI hope that my answer helps you out. Thanks for @DanielLawson for the push. \n\nA: Since this topic popped up again, several months later, I'll add a quick and impolite answer: \nNo, you cannot install 10.7 on any Mac that does not have an Intel processor.\nAll releases of OS X starting with 10.6 require Intel processors.\n\nA: If your attempting to upgrade a PowerPC Mac the most you can upgrade one of those is Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, since it was the last version of OS X to support PowerPC processors.\nSo the answer is no to upgrading to any OS beyond Mac OS X 10.5 if the Mac your trying to upgrade is has a PowerPC processor.\nIf you have an Intel Mac that support OS X Lion and you really want Lion or if Lion is the last version of OS X that your Mac can run, you will be able to contact Apple and arrange a way to purchase it via Apple's legacy products list as noted in the following MacWorld article: Apple pulls Lion from the Mac App Store\n\n...while Lion is no longer available for sale from the Mac App Store, customers can still purchase it from the legacy products list via Apple phone sales.\n\nSo if you really want lion contact Apple at 1-800-MY-APPLE and let them know you want to order OS X Lion.\n\nA: Sorry, meant to say: \"You can run PPC apps from Snow Leopard 10.6 actually with Rosetta\":\n\"Snow Leopard only supported machines with Intel CPUs, required at least 1 GB of RAM, and dropped default support for applications built for the PowerPC architecture (Rosetta could be installed as an additional component to retain support for PowerPC-only applications).[97]\"\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X#Version_10.5:_.22Leopard.22\n\nA: What good can the newest Mac OSX do if it can not be installed on a DuoCore Power PC with 16 GB of RAM. Apple is full of it....I won't spend a single dime on Apple products. I got robbed by Apple about $3000.00 a few years ago. I actually found an iPhone 4s and gave it away.\n", "Q: Is my private key available in the Time Machine backups? Where can I find it? I've used Time Machine on my Mac to perform backups of my Lion install. My SSD failed and I installed Mountain Lion on my machine.\nNow, I want to recover my private key from my backup so I can continue to sign my iOS apps without having to regenerate all of the certificates and provisioning profiles online. \nIs my private key available in the Time Machine backups? Where can I find it?\n\nA: Keychain keeps its files inside of ~/Library/Keychains.  In there is a \"login.keychain\" file that you can add to your current list of keychains in Keychain Access.\n", "Q: MacBook screen doesn't turn on My old, black (irony), pre-unibody (2009?) MacBook won't properly turn on. The screen just stays black. I can't hear the startup sound and the keyboard caps lock light won't shine, either. The power light, hard drive, and fans both start and work.\nI tried connecting it to TV (via mini-DVI to HDMI adapter) and I can't see anything, although TV thinks that there is some signal coming.\nIt didn't happen suddenly - previously it sometimes started, sometimes not. Once working it would work for weeks until switched off manually. Then one day it wouldn't start at all.\nI think that the motherboard could be near death, but the fact that some components work gives me hope.\nAny suggestions are welcome. I have a new Mac now and all data has been backed up so I can try pretty much anything.\n\nA: Try resetting the PRAM and SMC. \nHow to reset PRAM: restart or power up your Mac and immediately hold down the Command ⌘+Option ⌥+P+R keys all at the same time. Keep holding them down until the Mac resets. Also, on these old models you used to have to do it a few times: i.e., just keep holding down and let it reset a few times, before it would be completely clean.\nResetting the SMC is a bit more model-specific and I can't remember off the top of my head what you needed to do with your model, but you'll find instructions here, or you can Google your model number with \"reset SMC\".\n\nA: You can also try swapping RAM modules, you do this by turning off the Macbook, and removing one of the mac modules (Asumming you have two, if just one..you need to \"borrow\"/buy another module and try that one) and then turn it on. If the same issue happens, try the other module and turn it on, see what happens.\nIf any of that won't help, motherboard might be damaged.\n", "Q: Soundfonts in GarageBand: where can we select the .sf2 files? I am trying to use soundfonts with GarageBand '11 (version 6.0.5). I downloaded 2 files from HammerSound, I put them in Library > ...Banks, and, in GarageBand, I created a new project, went to the right side and set \"DLSMusicDevice\" below \"sound generator\". \nNow I don't see where I can find the sf2 files. If I click on a line in Effect, I can choose between Audio Unit Effects or Effects from GarageBand.\nWould anyone know something about this?\n\nA: Try double clicking the picture next to it.\nWhen you hover over the picture changes to three lines with dots on them so you know you're in the right place.\nThen a dialog opens, where you can change the sound bank.\nHowever, I'm having a problem at the moment that the latest soundfonts I downloaded are crashing GarageBand when I close the dialog, although one I already selected is OK. \n", "Q: How do I move my Amazon books to new iPad If I upgrade to a new iPad will all of my Amazon content be moved over?\n\nA: All Kindle content is ultimately stored in the cloud (with copies on each device). You should be able to easily download all of your content to your new iPad by logging into logging into your Amazon on a compatible app (the Kindle app is the only one I know of that does this).\n", "Q: How do I stop the play/pause keyboard buttons from launching iTunes on Mountain Lion? The play/pause keyboard buttons always launch iTunes. I want to use a Subsonic client, Thumper. The buttons control Thumper correctly, but I want to prevent iTunes launching.\nThere was a hacky solution available previously, but that no longer works.\nIs there a way to disable this iTunes behaviour?\n\nA: I searched everywhere for a clean solution. Many solutions that worked for Lion and below no longer worked for Mountain Lion. However, this works and it took me hours to find. Enjoy!\nhttp://gavinroy.com/posts/disabling-default-itunes-launch-behavior-with.html\nFrom the website:\n\nIn a search for a non-hacky way to disable direct mappings to iTunes for the play/pause/next/previous buttons in the keyboard in OSX, I stumbled across the \"Remote control daemon\" (rcd). As it turns out, disabling the iTunes launch behavior for these keys is as easy as unloading rcd with the following command:\n\nlaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rcd.plist\n\n\nA: If you press ⌘ command + shift + pause it doesn't open iTunes.\nAlso it sometimes works if you only press ⌘ command + pause or shift + pause\n", "Q: How can I prevent my Mac from periodically whooshing at me? Seemingly randomly throughout the day, my mac will \"whoosh\" at me.  I set up Messages, but whenever I switch to Messages after the whoosh, I don't have any new messages and usually my buddies are set to Away status anyway.\nNotification center is empty with \"No new notifications.\"\nI don't have the mail client set up or running, so it can't be that.  I do use Reminders and sometimes put things in the calendar, but I don't think those are whooshing at me.\nWhat is whooshing at me and how do I make it stop?\n\nA: Could it be the sound alerts Messages has configured by default? I'm particularly thinking about the sound when a contact comes online/goes offline, which sound like a \"whoosh\".\nYou can check and disable these sound alerts individually for each event in the Messages preferences.\n\n", "Q: Can an iPad (3rd gen) run solo with an Airport Express My folks are using a PC running WinXP to control a non-Apple wifi-router. The PC crashes often, bringing down with it the wifi network. They no longer actually use the PC, just the iPad, but they keep the PC to control the router.\nIf I replace their router with an Apple Airport Express, can I then discard the PC and control the router solely from the iPad? Could an iPad control a non-Apple wifi-router?\n\nA: Edited since I misread the question\nYou can definitely set up and control any Apple router that supports 802.11n from an iPad only. Apple has an iOS app just for that purpose.\nHowever if you want to save some money, or possible use the existing router, that may be an option too. Almost all routers these days have web interfaces, so an iPad can manage most routers. However there are some routers that require a PC app to manage, typically older ones.\nChances are they'll be fine, but you'll first want to check what kind of router it is, then have a quick look at the manufacturer's page to figure out if it has a web interface or not. If it does, you'll probably want to figure out the IP (typically 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1) and bookmark that for your parents.\nIt is a bit troubling that the router crashes when the PC crashes - sounds like something's not quite right there, so definitely check that out.\n\nA: Airport Express can be controlled from an iPad via Airport Utility. The functionality might be a bit less than the one offered by the PC/OS X version of the utility but should be good enough for a simple home network.\n", "Q: How do I reassign the F3 key to another application? I have a gesture for Exposé so I need another button (the F3) to do the same. I'd love to replace F3 to show/hide the MacBartender app. \n\nWould it be possible to reassign this key for such a use? I have KeyRemap4MacBook installed but it does not allow for changing individual keys (I either change all my function keys or none at all). \n\nA: FunctionFlip allows you to change the function keys individually.\n\nA: KeyRemap4MacBook does allow changing individual media keys.\nSave something like this as private.xml:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <item>\n    <name>Change Expose to F19</name>\n    <identifier>B83A0F12-896A-42C4-AE87-1F24EE0B989E</identifier>\n    <autogen>--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::EXPOSE_ALL, KeyCode::F19</autogen>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\nPress the ReloadXML button and enable the remapping in the first tab.\n", "Q: Is there any significance to the dimmed text in Safari 6? Text in the address bar of Safari 6.0 is displayed differently than in previous versions. Prior to 6.0, all text was black\n\nbut in 6.0, all text after the domain is grey:\n\nIs there any significance to this? Does it correspond to some new feature of Safari?\n\nA: The point of this is to make the domain of the site you're visiting blatantly obvious. Many phishing scams will use URLs that look very similar, but not exactly identical to the site they're trying to mimic (using things like, for example, paypal.com.mysupersketchydomain.ru), and this technique (now used in most modern browsers) helps to mitigate that risk even for non-tech-savvy users.\n", "Q: Pages \"Send via email\" doesn't work after upgrade I just upgraded to Mountain Lion. So far, so good. Great upgrade. I also upgraded to Pages '09 latest version: 4.2.\n\"Send via email\" option works on Pages if and only if Mail.app is not running. If Mail.app is already running, when I choose PDF, Word or Pages option to send the document to someone, it does nothing.\nIt's pretty annoying since it's a feature I used to use regularly.\nAnyone else with the same issue? Any suggestions?\n\nA: I've got the same problem. Postbox seems to be the answer. Removed it and now Send via Mail works again.\n", "Q: How does data get \"imported\" into ML's new features? I'm a little concerned about upgrading to Mountain Lion right now because I'm not sure how some of the data I have on my machine will get shoehorned into Mountain Lion's new apps and features.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does \"Notes\" start out clean? Does it import your To-Dos from Mail (the way Notes would sync before iOS 6/ML)? Or does it import notes from Stickies?\n\n*What happens to all of my Reminders in iCal? Do they automatically get imported into the Reminders app? Will I end up with duplicate Reminders resultant from iCloud issues?\n\n*I have the iChat setting turned on that saves all your chat logs. Will I still be able to open them in Messages? Will my iMessage conversations start to get saved in the same logs? (Is chat logging even still in the Messages app?)\n\n*I know Gatekeeper is enabled automatically, so what happens to always-running processes that I have set to start when my Mac turns on? I don't know if apps like Dropbox, LogMeIn, f.lux, or any of the others that start up as soon as I boot my machine, are signed with an Apple Developer ID, so will this cause big issues when I update and all of these unsigned apps try to run at once? (I plan to disable Gatekeeper minutes after upgrading, but I don't want it to cause issues that might keep my machine from booting up at all.)\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Notes will import from the Notes folder in Mail. They no longer appear in Mail, but are still an IMAP folder.\n\n*Reminders will import from the task calendars in iCal. They no longer appear in Calendar, but are still ical files.\n\n*Messages pretty much is iChat, with a different UI and an extra protocol (i.e., iMessage, which is really just XMPP). You can still save logs. You can still read your iChat logs. If you have iChat set to load old conversations when a window opens, the iChat conversations will appear in Messages when you open it the first time.\n\n*For Gatekeeper, most apps are signed already so you won't have to worry about it.\n\n\nA: The others I can only make educated guesses at, so I'll leave them for the moment, but Gatekeeper shouldn't cause any problems with existing programs. Gatekeeper doesn't check that an app has been signed properly on every launch, just the first launch, and then only if it's in the system's quarantine.\nFor more detail, check out the Gatekeeper section of the Ars Technica Mountain Lion review.\nYou may also want to consider keeping Gatekeeper on the default setting. You can ignore it on an individual basis by right-clicking and selecting Open. It does give you a bit of an extra margin for safety, just in case something goes awry.\n", "Q: How can I permanently disable the Mac keyboard backlight? I'm running Lion, soon to upgrade to Mountain Lion once I can ensure compatibility with installed apps, on an MBPR, and in the meantime I'm being driven crazy by the keyboard backlight. Here's the deal: you may have heard about people who have issues with an undersensitive ambient light sensor, viz.: people turn on \"automatically illuminate keyboard in low light\" in System Prefs -> Keyboard, and then find that the light comes on too frequently.\nThey are helpfully informed to disable the automatic illumination, and manually to turn the light off using the F5 and F6 keys (actually, technically, the keyboard light down and keyboard light up keys when not using fn modifier).\nHere's the funny thing: I have the \"automatically illuminate\" setting turned OFF, and I use the keyboard light keys to turn the keyboard light off.\nYet within a second, the light is back on.\nSeriously!\nProcedures to reproduce:\n\n\n*\n\n*Be doing anything\n\n*Keyboard light is on\n\n*Press keyboard light dim button -- but whatever is reporting the keyboard illumination level thinks the keyboard light is already off:\n\n\n*Press keyboard light increase button -- the light actually ends up dimmer, because it increases its illumination to one unit from what it thinks is 0 but is actually something higher.\n\n*Press keyboard light dim button again -- keyboard light switches off for a split second.\n\n*???\n\n*No profit. The keyboard demons switched the light back on during step 6, and now the light is on again.\n\n\nOnce again: I have automatic illumination DISABLED [please don't make me upload another screenshot to prove it:) ].\nFrankly, I don't need keyboard illumination. It's occasionally useful in pitch black, but I touch type anyway, so it is usually just an annoying distraction and waste of battery.\nSo, I'd like to just turn the darn thing off permanently. Terminal commands appreciated!\nAddendum:\nApparently, the behavior does not repeat when plugged into power.\nAddendum 2:\nApparently, the behavior does persist when plugged into power; it just takes longer for the computer to realize that it has stopped annoying me.\n\nA: I know this isn't the answer you're looking for, but have you tried resetting the pram and smc?

There is an iMac in our lab at university, running Mac OS X 10.7 Lion.\nIt is never used, so we have taken to using it to play music, as we can SSH to it, and it does not require any permissions to play music (using afplay).\nIs there any way to stream radio, or any other music stream from the command line?\n\nA: While not (strictly speaking) playing from the command line, you could use a set of AppleScripts (or AppleScript calls) wrapped in shell scripts to control a GUI player or website. In the likely case that the player or site doesn't directly support AppleScriptability, you can use AppleScript GUI scripting to control the mouse and keyboard. \nIf you're looking at a \"normal\" streaming radio station (i.e, one that has a downloadable file that specifies the stream), you can put that in iTunes and use its (relatively excellent) AppleScript dictionary to remotely control it.\nWith either option, if you want to get fancy, you can use remote scripting to send Apple Events from an arbitrary source machine to control your radio-iMac.\n\nA: You can run VLC to play a stream from the command line:\n/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC <address>\n\nFor example this (address from here) will play BBC Radio 3:\n/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC http://a.files.bbci.co.uk/media/live/manifesto/audio/simulcast/hls/uk/sbr_high/ak/bbc_radio_three.m3u8\n\nTo stop playing, press or send Ctrl+C.\nFor more information on the command line interface see here and the pages linked from it.\n\nA: I was interested to know the answer to this one myself, so I googled it.

In Lion I always used Control ⌃+Shift ⇧+Eject ⏏ to put my display to sleep when I walked away from my computer. The system would continue running and not go to sleep. \nNow in Mountain Lion when I put the display to sleep, the system sometimes decides to go to sleep as well. \nIt does not happen all of the time, it has been rather unpredictable. Some times I walk away for 2 minutes and come back and it went to sleep entirely. Other times I walk away for hours and come back and it did not go to sleep.\nVery odd. Any ideas?\nEDIT\nScreenshots for both Power Adaptor and Battery Energy Saver settings.\n\n\nAlso I just experienced the issue again. I walked away for about 3-4 minutes and came back and WiFi was disconnected so it does not seem like the Energy Saver settings are being respected. \nUnless... Energy Saver is considering the 15 minutes have elapsed being that my Display has gone to sleep and is therefore kicking in the computer sleep Energy Saver setting? I will up the Computer Sleep and see what happens.\n\nA: Realised I answered a dupe of this here: How can I download something with display turned off (Ctrl+Shift+Eject)?\nMy answer to that question below:\nI always use this combo as well, however this does not immediately sleep my machine in ML.\nI believe this is a separate issue at play here. According to Siracusa's ML review, unlike in previous OS X versions, in 10.8 your system is eligible for sleep immediately upon \"user inactivity\" (the inactivity delay being set in your energy saver settings) unless the currently running apps make \"power assertions\".\nIn this case, that key combo is signalling to the OS that \"user inactivity\" should be triggered right away. In such a case, if your particular app that's downloading stuff does not make power assertions, your system will sleep.\nI have come across the same issue generally (not necessarily related to triggering the screen sleep combo). See: Mountain Lion sleeps too aggressively\n\nA: I may not have entirely understood your question because I haven't used Mountain Lion yet.\nhttp://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/26234/sleep-display/\nThis app sleeps the screen while the system is still running. I'm not sure about Mountain Lion but according to the comments this will work on Lion at least. You could give it a try.\nI set it to a shortcut for when leaving my desk. I usually walk away while booting too so I also put it in my startup items.\n", "Q: Creating charging switch on iPhone charger I am attempting to create a switch on my iPhone charging wire so that I can use my device to test iOS applications I'm creating on my Mac without actually charging the device. When I'm working on an app my devices are often charged to 100% and have to be kept charging while I'm working, often for days on end.\nSo, in an effort to preserve my devices battery, I've split open one of my old iPhone chargers, and after looking up the USB wiring diagram put a toggle switch on the red +5V wire. (not the D+ or D- wires or ground)\nNow, the switch works just fine, but the problem is that when the switch is in the off state, not only does the iPhone stop charging (as it should) but the computer also detects that the device has been disconnected, which isn't very useful to me.\nAnybody have any thoughts on what could be done to make this work? I'm more of a software guy so I'm not all that familiar with what hardware wise would need to be modified to make this work. Or better yet, if theres anything that can be changed programmatically to make my Mac detect a device that isn't charing that would be awesome! Thanks for any input on this!\n\nA: There are these devices, but I'm not sure where you'll find one now. You could also use a non-powered USB hub.\nBut in all honesty, iPhone lithium ion batteries won't be too damaged by continual charging, it's not like to old days of NiCad (Nickel Cadmium) batteries.\n", "Q: Magic Window causes GfxCardStatus to switch to Discrete mode I was trying out the Magic Window timelapse wallpaper app and noticed that GfxCardStatus changed to discrete as soon as I loaded the application. It consumes 79.7mb of real memory. Does this mean there is a big impact on battery life ? How can I know for sure ?\nrMBP Mountain Lion OSX 10.8\n\nA: Yes, I'm afraid it will have an impact, but not necessarily a big one. I'm in a similar situation, a seemingly-benign app (Postbox, a mail client of all things) forces my discrete graphics on too (same model, MBP Retina).\nThe authors are fully aware of it but say there's nothing they can do - ultimately the choice about whether to enable discrete graphics is up to Apple, it gets turned on automatically if OSX detects that heavy graphics processing is taking place.\nApparently in the case of Postbox it's due to font rendering or something. I've just learnt to live with it - if I was really desperate I can force it back to onboard graphics using the very tool you mention anyway.\nHow big the effect is really depends on what the application is doing, and only you can determine it, by trying it with graphics first on discrete and observing estimated battery remaining, then again on integrated graphics. This should be a reasonable clue.\n", "Q: How to recover deleted data from erased hard drive? So last night my wifes laptop died big time. I could only boot up in safe mode and clearing pram / smc wasn't helping so I decided to wipe the hard drive and install Mountain Lion. I booted it in safe mode and copied any important files over. Then I wiped the drive and installed ML, which has now fixed the problem.\nOnly I made a mistake, the one thing I forgot to copy was the iPhoto library, which had all of our photos for the past 2 years on it. And it wasn't backed up. \nAny ideas on recovery methods?\n\nA: Okay, so I think I've solved the problem and thought I'd post this up just in case anyone runs into similar issues... \nI've downloaded a program Data Rescue 3, and I'm scanning the drive for deleted files. The program seems easy to use although I found that if you want to scan your internal drive (as in my case), you'll need to have another external drive plugged in as the software won't let you restore to the same drive you're recovering from. \nWhen you run the software, select your internal drive to scan off then select the deleted files scan. When prompted, select your external drive to work off.\nI'll post my results, success or failure, in the comments soon.\nScreenshot of results:\n", "Q: Is there an app that streams music and adds it to your library? I generally switch between my 4S and a Windows Phone; however, it isn't practical to have a Spotify paid account and a Zune Pass, although I much prefer the desktop software of the latter. I love the way a Zune Pass lets you download music and adds it to your phone library. Spotify (on ios and windows phone) keeps the music contained to your app and is way too playlist focused for my tastes. \nIs there anything for iOS that interfaces with your library?\n\nA: No. Apple currently does not allow third party applications to add music to your library, so it can only come from the iTunes store or your computer. Applications may let you choose music already in your library and let you control that music, but cannot add music directly.\n", "Q: Can you give me buying advice of a 6970 card in a 27\" iMac for just Photoshop, Lightroom, no video or games? Thinking of buying the 27\" iMac---I've given up waiting for the new desktop.  Only to be used for my images, files up to 1GB, no gaming, no video production.\nWill the 6970 card be worth the extra money?\n\nA: Well, it appears that some features of Photoshop CS5 may perform better with a good graphics card. One of these features that is particularly obvious is the new 3D functionality added to Photoshop. Also, there's an Adobe TV episode titled \"Photoshop's Graphics Card Power Helps You Save Time\". Here's a description of the episode:\n\nUse the power of your graphics card to navigate to any area of an image with new, ultra-smooth zooming and panning. Edit at the highest magnification and use the new Rotate View tool to smoothly turn your canvas for distortion-free viewing at any angle.\n\nIf you check out this Adobe Forums thread, they talk about the features that use the GPU (which can benefit from a better graphics card). Here are some of these features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mercury Graphics Engine: \"The Mercury Graphics Engine (MGE) represents features that use video card, or GPU, acceleration. In Photoshop CS6, this new engine delivers near-instant results when editing with key tools such as Liquify, Warp, Lighting Effects and the Oil Paint filter. The new MGE delivers unprecedented responsiveness for a fluid feel as you work.\"\n\n*Adapative Wide Angle Filter\n\n*Liquify\n\n*Oil Paint\n\n*Warp and Puppet Warp\n\n*Field Blur, Iris Blur, and Tilt/Shift\n\n*Lighting Effects Gallery\n\n\nAlso, Adobe posted a blog entry titled \"How to tune Photoshop CS5 for Peak Performance\", and in it they say this:\n\nPhotoshop is taking advantage of the powerful processor contained on these cards (called the graphics processing unit or GPU) to help speed up performance and activate a set of special GPU-accelerated features such as canvas rotation, panning and zooming, Adobe Repoussé, and Adobe Pixel Bender® filters.\n\nSo to sum it up, a better graphics card would greatly improve performance when doing 3D work with Repoussé and also with 2D work to an extent, but I guess you would have to determine for yourself if you're going to use Repoussé or the various filters that benefit from a better graphics card. In my opinion, if you can spare the money, then I would go for it, because you never know what you'll do in the future, but it's definitely not necessary to buy one.\n\nA: It depends, if you're a photographer or a professional photo retoucher who spends all day editing images in photoshop then it's definitely worth spending the extra money, you'll save yourself hours. If you're a hobbyist who spends a few hours of on photoshop once a month, then no, it's not worth the money.\n", "Q: How to move from text to text by keyboard in Powerpoint? How do I move from text item to text item using the keyboard in Powerpoint?

If a small business wanted to share a common database between all of its employees, is it possible to create a single iCloud account for a specific App rather than for all the iCloud related software on the iOS device?\n\nA: iOS and OS X only support a single account to access iCloud. It can't be done on a per-app basis.\nFurthermore, the iCloud syncing stuff isn't really designed for concurrent multi-user access, it's built for the sort of syncing that needs to happen for personal devices - i.e. that you're using only one device at a time. It's also worth noting that from a developer's standpoint, iCloud is far from perfect, particularly with regards to the Core Data (database schema) syncing and storage.\nYou don't say exactly what your needs are, but I strongly suspect you'd be better served looking somewhere else for a business-critical app.\n\nA: I would certainly be more inclined to look at Google Apps for this kind of task, and if you need a database program specifically they have cloud SQL\n\nA: I'm not a developer, but I play one --- oh wait, I am a developer. Serioussly, I really agree with CanuckSkier that iCloud is not ready for mainstream user development unfortunately, and that at present, it's not really used in multi-user applications.\nI haven't used Google Apps much (I will look at them!), but have been playing with both Dropbox and Parse. Parse (www.parse.com) seems ideal for sharing a multi-user database.\nBoth Parse and Dropbox have developer forum, have tons of documentation and sample code.\nThey are terrific to work with too. \nHope this helps.. \n\nA: Seems you had some vision Douglas. Apple finally did come out with CloudKit that allows multiple users. Apple CloudKit provides both a public and a private data store. \n", "Q: How can I use Regular Expressions in Spotlight on Mountain Lion? How can I use Regular Expressions in Spotlight on Mountain Lion?\nI want to use my knowledge of regular expressions to make my search results more exact.\n\nA: Apple's tools for accessing the Spotlight index (Spotlight itself and the mdfind command) don't offer any regex options, nor do I know of any 3rd party tools that offer that (I'm not actually sure Apple has APIs that would make that possible).\nHowever, the mdfind command does offer a much more powerful interface than the GUI Spotlight search. It offers proper binary operators and finer grained control over what metadata you search. Check out The Power of mdfind (via archive.org) for some good information, as well as the mdfind man page.\n\nA: I found a couple alternatives to Spotlight that allow for more control over your searches. Like the mdfind command the Canuck suggested, some of the tools enable you to use boolean operators.\n\nAlternative 1: Find Any File\n\nFind any file is very basic when you first look at it, but once you click the \"More Choices\" button, many more options pop up so you can refine the search by including more parameters like those seen in the image of a menu:\n\n\nAlternative 2: NotLight\n\nAlthough I prefer NotLight to Spotlight, it's search is not as powerful as that of Find Any File and you're not given as many parameters to search by. However, you can search within a specific folder, which is a useful feature.\n\nAlternative 3: EasyFind\n\nEasyFind is by far the most user friendly Spotlight alternative and has the nicest user interface. It is better then NotLight, but does lack some of the functionality of Find Any File. However, if you're the average user and are not looking for incredibly specific search capabilities, then this would probably be the best option.\n\nHope you found some of these tools useful!\n", "Q: How do I restore autoconf after Mountain Lion update? I upgraded my macbook to Mountain Lion today and found that I no longer have autoconf installed, is there a specific way to restore that or will I need to manually compile it etc? I have XCode 4.4 installed with Command Line Utilities downloaded and installed as well. Thanks for the information!\n\nA: It sounds like you're a developer. You should install Mac Ports. It's REALLY helpful and useful to have. You can use it to get command line tools such as autoconf. It's always useful to have if you work with command line a lot.\nJust install the .pkg from http://www.macports.org/install.php to install MacPorts.\nAfter so, in terminal, run:\nsudo port install autoconf\nMore info:\nhttp://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=library&substr=autoconf\n\nA: If you already have the latest XCode installed go to it's Preferences -> Downloads pane.\nYou can install the Command Line Tools there. You may need to reinstall Xcode and then install the Command Line Tools in the same way if that doesn't work.\nEither way, to solve this specific issue you don't 'need' Mac Ports as it is a known issue that can be solved as above.\n", "Q: Should I be worried about 98°C CPU temperature on MacbookAir? I'm a developer and often times I need to compile some packages or maybe even run some codes for couple of hours.\nRecently I have noticed that whenever I use Homebrew to install something, it defaults to source, and compilation causes my CPU temp to go around 98 Celsius . Some of the compiles are quite long, couple of minutes, and I'm worried this might harm my MacBookAir.\n\n\n*\n\n*Should I be worried about this 98°C CPU temperature on MacbookAir?\n\n*And if so, how can I fix that?\n\n\nA: Michiel's correct in that if the computer gets too hot, it'll shut down automatically. However, if you want to be on the safe side, you can check out smcFanControl and Fan Control.\nsmcFanControl:\n\nsmcFanControl lets the user set the minimum speed of the build in fans. So you can increase your minimum fan speed to make your Intel Mac run cooler. However in order not to damage your machines smcFanControl doesn't let you set a minimum speed to a value below Apple's defaults (MacUpdate).\n\nFan Control\n\nSome MacBooks and MacBook Pros are just to hot for daylong use. Fan Control adjusts the minimum fan speed depending on the current CPU temperature. For safety, it leaves the original automatic fan speed control intact (lobotomo).\n\nAnd remember, if your computer ever gets to 660.4°C, don't leave it on your lap, unless you want liquid aluminum all over you.\n\nUPDATE:\nI found another tool called CoolBook that\n\nlets you monitor the frequency, voltage and temperature of the CoreDuo / Core2Duo CPU. Registered users can also change the frequency and voltage of the processor.\n\nHere's a list of features that are listed on the site:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reduce heat (presumably by optimizing fan speed)\n\n*Reduce fan speed (presumably by lowering fan speed)\n\n*Extend battery life\n\n*Improve performance\n\n*Fine tune your CPU\n\n\nThis seems like a useful tool, but it does not support Lion and Mountain Lion, and does not work on Intel i3, i5, and i7 processors.\n\nA: A MacBook Air gets hot, just like any other laptop, although 100°C is relatively hot (if not, almost the maximum a Mac can handle).\nThere are reports where users complain about their MacBook Air temperature flirting with 100°C, so you're not alone. \nThings you can do to prevent getting the Mac too hot is making sure you haven't covered his ventilating holes. Place it on a flat, hard surface (no lap, pillow or blanket as developers tend to do. At least, that's what I do once in a while :-)).\nOther things you can do is make sure you don't run too much applications at the same time, or you could use a laptop stand to get extra fresh air under your Mac.  \nOr if it's really bothering you, you can always invest in a professional laptop cooler. \n\nWhat you should keep in mind is the MacBook Air will shut itself down when there is any chance of damage.  \nSo you've got nothing to worry about. Your Mac won't get harmed. \n\nA: Damage of the type that \"computer just burns\" is unlikely, as Macbooks have protections against overheating. What should be the concern is increasing aging rate. Computer parts have mean time between failures (MTBF) that often depends on temperature at which the part is being operated. So there is always \"a chance of damage\", which increases with the temperature, and it is manufacturer's choice which temperature to allow/disallow.\nAnother thing that is CPU temperature is 98 degrees, it is quite possible it has already thermal-throttled to avoid damage.\nI would take some action to cool it down - clear the insides, replace thermal paste.\nmore info: eeweb.com/demonstrated-mtbf-and-temperature\n\nA: Don't worry about the temperature of your macbook... use it without any thought.\n\nA: *\n\n*From my personal experience, there are risks with excessive heat. The CPU has relatively complete temperature control settings, such as frequency reduction, to protect it from burning out, but the motherboard does not have. And because the macbook fan is slow to respond to temperature increases, It is possible for the motherboard to burn out due to excessive temperature. Let me tell you something that happened to me.\nI never cared about macbook temperature before until the motherboard of my own macbook pro burned out. That day I put the computer on my stomach, laying in bed watching a movie, then for a split second the computer went black and I can't turn on it again. The next day I took it to the service center and the repairman told me the motherboard was broken. I used to expect it to at least automatically shut down when it got too hot, but it turns out that macbook pro does not have such a protection mechanisme. I think macbook air won't shut down with extreamly high temparature either.\n\n\n*If you want to reduce the temparature, it is recommended to use a fan control programs such as mac fan control(download link crystalidea.com/macs-fan-control) to increase the fan speed. It works fine so far. As I mentioned, the macbook fan is slow to respond to temperature increases. Fan control software can improve this problem by increasing the fan to high speed when the temperature is relatively high. But because I just tried one kind of fan control software(mac fan control), I cannot give more suggestions about how to choose a better fan control software.\n", "Q: How to make my workflows run again with Automator Runner after upgrading to Mountain Lion?

That was mostly for a one off time though versus ongoing.\nIf you have an ongoing job, like one that you would have scheduled through iCal, launchd will work nicely as well. \nBut if you want an outright replacement to something similar to what you did with iCal/Calendar, it sounds like this great writeup on the Apple Discussions board explains using Automator's 'Calendar Alarm'. One user even said that this new way is even easier to use. I personally think with the extra power of Automator, it also adds new power.\nFrom that site:\n\nHere's a solution that works for me:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*In Automator, create a Calendar Alarm\n  \n*Select Utilities from the library pane\n  \n*Select & drag Run AppleScript into the workflow area\n  \n*Copy/paste the AppleScript into the Run AppleScript box\n  \n*Save the newly created Calendar Alarm\n  \n*Open Calendar.app, create a new event\n  \n*Select the Automator calendar as your reference calendar\n  \n*Select Open File for the alert, and select the file you created in Automator. By default, iCal is the file that comes up when you select\n  Open File. \n  \n*Change that to the name of the Automator app you created. \n  \n*Select Other if the file name isn't shown.\n  \n\n\nThe user attached some screenshots to their post, as well, but I have included a screenshot of what needs to be selected in Automator. \n\nA: jmlumpkin's answer is spot-on, but you can make it even easier on yourself. As I described in a blog post, you don't need to copy and paste the script into the new workflow you create. You can call the original AppleScript from inside the workflow, instead:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    run script file \"Macintosh HD:Some Directory On Disk:a cool script.applescript\"\n\nend run\n\n", "Q: How to edit binary InfoPlist.strings in Mountain Lion (for Finder to display folders before files)?

It seems to be bad design that I can not just scroll down on the month view of Calendar, so that the grid just moves up.   Going prev/next through the months is very uncomfortable any time you are dealing with periods of time that span from one month to the next!\nAny method to get this function?  Calendar/iCal has been around a while, they should have built this in -- it is a common and convenient feature.\n\nA: iCal is limited to the view modes you see in the main window - Day, Week, Month and Year. It's not very customizable.\nHowever as an alternative, you might want to look at BusyCal. It's a pretty well regarded app. The two word pitch is \"iCal Pro\". It integrates with the system calendar, so all the built-in calendar based functions work fine, and in addition to iCloud sync, it has much better Google Calendar sync if that's a selling point. Most importantly for you it's more customizable in terms of views, and the month view scrolls by week.\nSorry there's nothing to be done with the existing app, but BusyCal is probably the best option to get what you want. There's a 30 day demo, so give it a try.\n\n", "Q: How to set the language of iCloud calendar reminder emails? Ever since iCloud Calendar became publicly available I have used it to arrange my schedule. I meet with people from other countries on a regular basis and I'd like the Calendar reminder emails I send to people when setting up a meeting to be in English. Unfortunately, that's not the case. iCloud always sends my meeting invites in my native language (the country my AppleID is assigned to).\nIt seems that iCloud is ignoring my OS and iCloud web interface language choice, as they're both set to English.\nIs there a way to change the default language of Calendar reminders somewhere?\n\nA: First visit Apple ID. Then click Mange your Apple ID, middle on the right of the page:\n\nLogin and then click Language and Contact Preferences.\n\nHere you can select English US or English UK.\n\nA: I had the same problem, and i finally solved it,\nGo to appleid.apple.com and set the preferred language for your account.\n", "Q: How do I sync notes between two macs with the new Notes.app in Mountain Lion?  I've tried the following to sync notes between two macs with the new notes.app in Mountain Lion:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > iCloud and check the \"document and date\" service.\n\n*System Preferences > Mail Calendar, select the iCloud account and check the sync notes box, then click add. It unchecked itself after I quit system preferences.\n\n*System Preferences > iCloud and check the sync notes box. It asked me to specify or create a @me.com account.\n\n\nHow do I sync notes between two macs with the new notes.app in Mountain Lion?\nIs the only way to do this is to create a @me.com account?\n\nA: Yes. You have to have an iCloud account for iCloud syncing to work.\n\nA: How this all works.\nNotes uses a subset of email technology to work, much like reminders. This is why both reminders and notes used to be part of the Mail app in previous versions, before they got their dedicated apps. Lets just say they are a \"special kind of email\" that doesen't get sent out to anyone, but is stored for your future reference. \nAs such you need an email account that both supports these features and that iCloud can access. You see, when you use your email to register to iCloud you are using it much like on Facebook: you are providing your email, and it will be your \"username\", but just like Facebook, iCloud doesen't have access to your mails. To do so you need to register your email under \"Mail, Contacts & Calendars\" in system preferences. \nI know it's a bit confusing, but think of it this way: when you register to anything else it asks for an username, a password and an email, no? Apple wants to make it easier for its users to remember their usernames so your email becomes your username. Your email account and iCloud are not linked in any way.\nSo what does this all mean?\nIt means that in order to sync your notes you must add your actual email account (gmail, yahoo, exchange, etc) under \"Mail, Contacts and Calendars\" to give Apple access or create a @me.com account to which Apple will have access. \nIf you choose the former method it will work given your email provider supports notes.Some users report problems when syncing to macs that are not running Mountain Lion. If both are on Mountain Lion it should be fine though.\nIf you choose the latter method you will have a new email account, and you will be able to log into iCloud using either your old email or the new one. \nHope it helps! Any questions (I know it can be a bit confusing) feel free to comment. \n", "Q: How to get Java applets working with Chrome?

I have a MacBook Retina running Windows 8 RP, with the driver that comes with Boot Camp.\nI understand why running in a none native resolution like 1920x1200 is grainy. But 1440x900 is exactly half resolution of the native 2880x1800 resolution, meaning that there are 4 pixels to paint 1 pixels (aka pixel doubling), and thus should look great.\nWhen running 1280x720 on my 27\" Cinema Display (exactly half of 1560x1440) the picture is sharp and crisp, so why is this a problem on the Retina display?\nPS: Running 150 DPI is not an option. Windows is really ugly when changing DPI and many applications have UI problems. Many Apps like Chrome and Skype does not support DPI but windows scales them so the look grainy. But worst of all, attaching an external screen forces this to run in 150DPI as well (turning my 27\" into an 18\"), and some programs like Remote Desktop are note scaled at all, so every thing is very small.\n\nA: This is because of how Retina is implemented on these new systems. In the Mac OS (and iOS for that matter), resources are doubled in size, therefore each point is roughly the 4 pixels. \nTo the system though, it still reports the 1440x900 size, even though the actual pixel count is 2880x1800. The Mac OS knows how to handle this looking for @2X resources or using native code to render things at a higher resolution offscreen before painting to the screen.\nWhile on Windows though, it is outright seeing the 1440x900. Since Windows doesn't really have a built in way to handle the 'Retina' feature that the Mac does, things would be grainy. You would see the same problem on a Mac App that doesn't use native text or image rendering, that hasn't been updated yet. \nSo the only way to make it look crisp on your Windows install would be to run at 2880x1800 - which would be hard to see, or a higher resolution than 1440x900 that you felt comfortable with depending on stretching/artifacts/etc. That is until Windows does have some possible feature like this and implemented in a similar way. \nWhen connected to your external display though, Windows is seeing the 1280x720 px, and rendering that correctly, but at whatever your native resolution is. Also, the pixel density on the larger display may be different. \nIt comes down to the easiest way to understand - the pixel doubling/retina features are an OS feature, not a hardware feature.\n\nA: I believe your problem with 1440x900 is not that image is \"grainy\", but that it is \"blurry\", because \"grainy\" (aka pixel-perfect 2x scaling) is expected and desired result, which is, unfortunately, cannot be achieved under Bootcamp.\nThe reason why Retina MacBook running 1440x900 under Boot Camp looks blurry is nVidia GeForce driver doing bilinear interpolation for any non-native resolution, which is totally fine for most cases, except for 1440x900, where nearest-neihbour interpolation should be more appropriate.\nThere is no known way to change this behavior.\nIt is worth noting that Parallels Desktop 8 was updated for Retina Desktop to support both nearest neighbor interpolation (it is called \"Scaled\" mode) and bilinear interpolation (\"Best for Retina\" and \"More Space\" modes). Using \"Scaled\" mode, you can run Windows 7 and Windows 8 at 2x pixel perfect scaling in virtual machine, both fullscreen (1440x900) and windowed. Disable Cleartype for best results (subpixel rendering doesn't work well in 2x mode)\n", "Q: How to style notifications in Mountain Lion? Growl notifications can be styled using css.\nHas anyone made any inroads on styling the notifications in Notification Center in Mountain Lion?\n\nA: Notification center, like most Apple standard features doesn't provide much in the way of customizable appearance. Even app developers don't have any control over the appearance of the notifications. The most you can do is choose between the Banner and Alert styles in Notificantion preferences:\n\nIf you need more styling options, you'll have to keep using Growl where you can.\n\nA: I found this little app called NCbackgrounder here:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/ncbackgrounder/\nor\nhttp://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/44252/ncbackgrounder/\nI think this is what you were looking for.

There's nothing in /Users/MyUserName/Library/Mail/Bundles that looks like the Unsubscribe plugin.\nHow to uninstall deprecated Unsubscribe plugin from Mail.app?\n\nA: UnsubMailPluginMail App for OS X is a leftover from a free program which later switched to become a user pay software.

I recently bought a MacBook Air with OS X Lion. I have an iPad (iOS 5) and my wife has a iPhone 4S. We each have our own iTunes accounts and that's the start of the problem!\nI successfully opened iTunes on my new Mac and pulled all my stuff down to my Mac (movies, music, etc). I set up another account on the Mac for my wife (a non-admin account if that makes any difference) and open iTunes while logged in as her. I tried to sync up with her iTunes account without luck.  \nI'm beginning to suspect that Apple only allows you to sync with one iTunes account. Is that true? It would seem crazy. The whole point of a desktop/laptop computer is to assign separate account for people and have them keep their own stuff (in this case iTunes movies and music).\nAny ideas on how I can see my iTunes account from my MacBook Air user account and my wife can see her iTunes account from her user account?\n\nA: Yes - make one user account for your iTunes library and a second user account for your wife. \nAs far as I see, this is no problem at all having two independent user accounts on one system, each using a separate Apple ID to login to the Cloud and iTunes. I tested it on my Mac (10.8) just now using my work Apple ID under a freshly created separate user account and found it to work.\nThis method has worked since OS X was first developed and it's unlikely to change anytime soon. You can search here for other questions that cover how to share some or all of the songs between separate accounts, but it's always easy to combine things later than it is to start mixed and separate things later.\n\nA: You can hold the ALT key before clicking on the iTunes icon to launch iTunes with the dialogue \"Choose Library\". This way you can use two separate libraries on the same user account in OSX. I've used this on Lion and Mountain Lion. \nIf you use iTunes Match then you can't use the same Match on both accounts.\n\nA: I don't understand what your problem is? You have two Mac account, two iTunes account, two iTunes library, and only one iPad, right? And you want to sync that iPad to two iTunes account, that means, two iTunes library, right?\nIf what I understand is true, then the thing here is that you tried to sync with two different iTunes library. The right way to do this is actually create a unified iTunes library, and use that to sync.\nThere are a few ways to do this. One is to have only one iTunes library for you and your wife, which means everything is mixed together. That's quite simple, I'm sure you can figure it out. It's just that the only iTunes library needs to be authorized with TWO iTunes account. Go to \"Store\" - \"Authorize this computer\" to do it. Also, remember to reauthorize old iTunes libraries.\nAnother cool way is to have another new library, and have that library access both your libraries. Meaning to have both you and your wife's song without copying them. Go to \"Preferences\" - \"Advanced\", and you will find option not to copy things when they're added to the library. The downside is that you still have to authorize both accounts for that library. Meaning, you have to authorize both accounts twice on the same computer.\n", "Q: NAS - \"there was a problem connecting to the server\" while on other networks On my home network, I have a NAS I regularly use for storage.\nI have set my Mac to automatically mount it via a login item to open the directory on the System Preferences/Users & Groups pane.\nI also use my Mac at work, though, where I can't access the NAS any more, because it's on a different network.\nThis means I get a ton of persistent \"There was a problem connecting to the server\" messages. I can close them, but they pop back up again.\nIs there a better way to do what I'm doing, or to disable those messages?\n\nA: What you need is a network location manager program, typically these allow you to perform certain actions (e.g. connect to a network drive) when the machine is on some networks and not on others. Several years ago I was using one, now defunct, so I can't recommend any from experience. What I found now are things like Sidekick ($29), Control Plane (free).  \nYou can also do this with a script (e.g. Login Item, if you log off or shutdown the machine when moving it from home to work or vice versa, or cron job) to determine the network the machine is on and depending on it to connect to the network drive (if not already connected) or not.\n\nA: I had the same problem and solved it this way. Go to SYSTEM PREFERENCES / USERS & GROUPS , there, select your user name and then click on LOGIN ITEMS. Check whether in this list there is a network drive, such as a share on your NAS. If yes, it means that your Mac is automatically trying to log on to that drive on starting up your computer.\nOn my Mac I had a connection to a network share on my NAS. After removing it, the \"There was a problem connecting to the server\" messages stopped immediately, even with the NAS switched off.\n", "Q: Has the Virtual Display screen sharing been removed in Mountain Lion? One of the great things about Lion was the Virtual Display, whereby when screen sharing you could login as a 2nd user rather than just take over the physical display.\nIn effect it was like turning your Mac into a (limited) multi user system, whereby 2 people could simultaneously login and use it.\nWhen using the Screen Sharing feature in Mountain Lion (to research whether there were any changes that might answer this question), I noticed it has seemingly been removed.\nIs there any official documentation showing it's removal, or is it still possible to achieve perhaps through other utilities, like Apple Remote Desktop?\nI should add that I am using ML at both ends of the screen sharing.\n\nA: OK, I sussed it out.  You can still do it, it's just that the way you do it is based on context rather than using the appropriate command.\nBasically, to use the virtual display, you need multiple user accounts on the target machine, and you need an account to be already logged into the target machine such that you can login a 2nd time using the virtual display.  Any account you wish to log into obviously needs the associated sharing rights enabled.  Then follow the following logic:\n\n\n*\n\n*If no one is logged into the target machine, you will always get the Hardware display showing the normal login screen, when you login from that screen you continue to use the hardware display.\n\n*If the user you try to login as is already logged in, then it will always switch to that user and continue to use the hardware display\n\n*If you login with a user who is not already logged in at the hardware display but someone else is (this is the key, the Hardware display needs to be in use by someone else), you get the following message and the ability to use the virtual display.\n\n\n\nIf you want to use the virtual display for privacy reasons, you cannot simply switch to it like you could in 10.7, but you could simply leave the target machine with Guest logged in on the Hardware display to allow you to login as your primary user on the Virtual one.\n\nA: It looks like Virtual Display support is still present according to OS X Mountain Lion: Share the screen of another computer\n\nIf someone else is already connected to the Mac as a remote user, a dialog asks if you want to share the display with the other remote user (“Share the display”), or set up your own screen (“Connect to a virtual display”). Choose the option you want.\n  If you choose “Connect to a virtual display,” you will share the Mac with the other remote user, but you won’t share the same screen.\n\n\nA: Functionality still seems to be present. With the following settings\n\nany user connecting from another Mac (or probably any VNC client) gets directly to the login screen and can select a local user there.\n", "Q: What does it mean when an iMessage doesn't say \"Delivered\" nor \"Not Delivered\"? I sent an iMessage to a friend, and at the bottom it doesn't say \"Delivered\" as it usually does. It doesn't say \"Not Delivered\" either, it just doesn't say anything at all.\nWhat does it mean when an iMessage doesn't say \"Delivered\" nor \"Not Delivered\"?\n\nA: I believe \"Not Delivered\" implies an error of some kind, whereas if nothing is displayed that just means the message is queued up to an inactive phone, or backed-up in transit over the network.\n\nA: It can mean a few things;\n\n\n*\n\n*The recipients' phone battery is low/dead\n\n*The recipients' phone is out of wifi range.\n\n*The recipient has you on block\n\n*The recipients' phone is off\n\n\nA: The receiving device is probably off, in sleep mode, out of cell reception, flat battery - something like that.\n\nA: It can mean you have been blocked. I attempted this with my number. I blocked my number send a text, didn't receive it and it never said delivered. I unblocked my number, sent text and it worked as it should by putting delivered under text and me receiving the text.\n\nA: It can also mean that the other individual has simply logged out of their account\n\nA: When it doesn't say Delivered, it means the other person is texting someone else or on the phone.  Once they stop texting or hang up the phone, you will see the text message has been delivered.\n\nA: It means that the message was not sent to their phone.\nTo resolve try the following \n\n\n*\n\n*in-activate the app\n\n*turn your phone off \n\n*turn wifi off then on\n\n*If none of this works contact your mobile provider or Apple\n\n\nA: From my understanding, when your message says delivered under it then the person received it.  If the word \"delivered\" dont show it means they are on the phone and it will say delivered once they hang up.  \n\nA: When It says “delivered” that means it has sent to your recipient and when it doesn't say delivered that means that either you don’t have  WiFi or their battery is dead so the message hasn't gone through I think. \n\nA: It could mean that they are in area with no cellular service, or they could have blocked you –accidentally or otherwise, or their phone might be flat or off.\nI texted my friend and it didn't send; it never said delivered but when I text some other friends it sends.\n\nA: If it doesn't say \"delivered\" within an hour or 2- u were blocked. No one is texting straight thru 2 hours or on the phone more than 2 hours. And I know personally that if I get text while on phone it still says delivered. Some peeps have there's said to \"read\" n others don't but \"delivered\" is blocked if never shows up. U can call n won't go straight vm but iMessage/text message will always confirm delivery\n\nA: My friend and I tested it and when someone has their phone off it will not report \"delivered\" or \"not delivered\" until the phone is turned on.

I modified the \"Recursive Image File Processing Droplet\" example provided from Apple in AppleScript Editor to rename any dropped file and move it to a custom folder. It worked seemingly flawlessly when I dropped images directly from iPhoto. Unfortunately I noticed now that the files where moved out of the iPhoto Library. So now the iPhoto Library is corrupted and iPhoto show the files I processe.\nFirst of all when I dropped the files on my droplet it showed reassuringly the green \"plus\" sign, so I thought it was actually providing the droplet a copy of the file. Isn't this a sign of bad user interface?\nNow, I'd like to know how to deal with the corrupted iPhoto Library and the missing pictures. So my real question is how to recover a corrupted iPhoto Library in the most painless way, when all happened is that some files where renamed and moved away. I wrote all the story as a warning for people who may do the same thing.\nMy system is OS X 10.7.4 and I am using iPhoto '09 8.1.2.\n\nA: Most painless way: Restore from back up.\nAssuming the photos haven't actually been deleted, but instead some form of database corruption:\nOption 1\nBack Up and try rebuild the library: hold down the command and option (or alt) keys while launching iPhoto. Use the resulting dialogue to rebuild. Choose to Repair Database. If that doesn't help, then try again, this time using Rebuild Database.\n \nIf that fails:\n \nOption 2\nDownload iPhoto Library Manager and use its rebuild function. (In Library Manager it's the FIle -> Rebuild command) \nThis will create an entirely new library. It will then copy (or try to) your photos and all the associated metadata and versions to this new Library, and arrange it as close as it can to what you had in the damaged Library. It does this based on information it finds in the iPhoto sharing mechanism - but that means that things not shared won't be there, so no slideshows, books or calendars, for instance - but it should get all your events, albums and keywords, faces and places back.\nBecause this process creates an entirely new library and leaves your old one untouched, it is non-destructive, and if you're not happy with the results you can simply return to your old one.   \nRegards\n \nTD \n", "Q: Why won't Time Machine work with a drive connected to an Airport Extreme? Is there any technical limitation or engineering reason that could possibly be behind the inability to RELIABLY use a connected USB drive with Airport Extreme for Time Machine?  \n\nA: I have had this working fine, just by initialising a backup over local USB, then moving the drive to the AE, and selecting a the same drive over the network location.  All worked fine.\n\nA: I've also heard it's unsafe, with the explanation of journaling, the \"log book\" for the hard drive. This journal contains the actions an operating system is \"about to do\", so the operating system knows what it was doing in a recovery after a write failure (for example, because of power loss). It's easy for a backup over a network share to be interrupted, for example, when the network temporarily falls away. Since a lot of caching is involved in network shares, including caching of the disk journal, you can't always be sure that the remote journal is updated, causing the physical on-disk journal to be out of sync with what the operating system thinks is in the journal.\nAll of this said, though, I still don't completely understand why it's not possible. Time Machine handles interruptions quite well as far as I know: until a backup is completed, it is in a separate place that doesn't confuse the software if it goes wrong. I.e. maybe the operating system can't fully recover all write problems but at least this can't mess up a backup. Only at the very end of the backup is the backup moved into place with a single, atomic operation. In my mind, the above explanation is a hint, but it isn't a complete answer...\n\nA: Not a complete answer, but this document might help: Time Machine Server Requirements\nTo be listed as a backup destination, the AFP server must advertise it with specific features and flags turned on. Airport Extreme storage doesn't show up because it's missing something from that list, but the question is what?\nI found a reference to the Extreme's AFP implementation lacking some caching capabilities (link) but I have no idea if that's true. It is plausible that it doesn't have the storage required for the replay cache.\nIt's also plausible that it does have all these features but Apple chose simply not to enable the Time Machine flag.\nNote that the newest generation (the big ones with 802.11ac) does now officially support Time Machine, so this doesn't seem to be an issue anymore. That's probably because they're now almost identical to the current Time Capsule inside.\n\nA: There's no technical limitation.  You simply need to plug the disk into your Mac and format it as \"Mac OSX Extended (Journaled)\", however, it's been reported to be unreliable.\nAirport Extreme + USB Drive vs Time Capsule\n\nA: Perhaps it's unreliable because there's no way to have the Airport unmount the disk, so there's no safe way to disconnect it.  In my case I have it on the same power bar with the Airport and cable modem, which I occasionally power-cycle for the modem.\nIt's possible the TimeCapsule could have a capacitor/small UPS that allows it to gracefully shut down whenever it's unplugged.\n", "Q: Is it possible to upgrade the drive in a Time Capsule? The Time Capsule has limited space, and the price difference from 2TB to 3TB is absurd: another $200 for a single additional terabyte.  (I'm sure they'll increase that with the next round of Time Capsules, whenever they release those, but I don't know when that'll be, and I'd rather vote with my wallet to tell Apple their Time Capsule is overpriced.)\nSo how hard would it be to crack open a Time Capsule and upgrade the drive to something a little larger?  \n\nA: By all means - vote with your wallet. It's trivial for a trained technician to replace the hard drive on a Time Capsule. Rather than put the rubber covering back on the base, you can use inexpensive silicone bumpers to raise the capsule up from it's shelf. Most feel iFixit has decent repair guides if you care to DIY.\n", "Q: Why is Airplay from my iPhone to my Apple TV so slow? I got the new Apple TV and noticed that it takes ages to stream a video from my iPhone.\nMoreover, streaming videos directly from youtube on my iphone over airplay may cause the video to be very blurry for a few secs and then back to normal (HD), this might be due to buffering but im not sure if the internet connection has an impact on that.\nIs there a way to improve the efficiency and speed of the device?\nI am using a Wireless N router. The Apple TV is connected via WIFI. The iPhone is connected wireless through airplay.\n\nA: The crucial issue is the speed of your router. Ideally you'd have the Apple TV connected to a router via an Ethernet cable using Gigabit Ethernet (1000/baseT) and your router would have WiFi N, not Wifi G (which is slower by a factor of about five), for the iPhone connection. Then you'd want to make sure that the WiFi N router was operating on a channel not subject to interference from other routers nearby, or from physical interference that would lead to signal attenuation.\nIt would be a good idea to try putting your WiFi router in the same room as your Apple TV and your iPhone and to see if video image quality improves. If so, this is an indication that you were experiencing WiFi signal attenuation due to interference caused by the materials used in the walls of the building.\nAlso, if this is the first time you've used an AppleTV, and the first time you've tried to watch HD video streaming over the Internet on your television, it may be that your Internet connection speed from your Internet service provider simply isn't fast enough to support HD video. If you have DSL, you may wish to consider upgrading to a cable modem or fiber-optic service with higher bandwidth. This year I found that AT&T had made their Uverse fiber-optic service available in my neighborhood. I upgraded to Uverse and got Internet service at four times the speed of my old AT&T DSL service for the same price I was paying for the slower DSL.\n\nA: This worked. After 3 days of going over the same posts and no clear answer, The problem is in the appleTV software. revert to version 5.1.1 and it works great. I'm tired of people posting the same answers like we don't know any better to check the wireless router etc... any ways. reset the Apple TV and make sure it does not update to new software.\nMy apple TV took upto 2 min to see the Ipad screen.\n", "Q: High fan speed and CPU temp with low CPU usage? I've been having intermittent fan speed and high CPU temperature when my CPU usage is nearly 0%. I don't run any weird apps. If I put my computer into sleep mode and wake it back up, this fixes the issue. I think this is an System Management Controller(SMC) issue, but I'm not sure. Anyone know how to fix this permanently?\n\nA: Try resetting the SMC as noted in the question for your MacBook Air and see if the problem persists.\nIf the problem does persist it may be a failing temperature sensor, resulting in the fans running faster than normal to worst case fail-safe full-speed state, your only option at that point would be to take it to Apple Support for repair / replacement.\n\nA: If its a laptop, spin it upside down and blast some air into the vents.

Kind is set to Any by default, and it wouldn't make sense to start searching for all files after adding a Kind filter.\nIf you actually want to create a smart search that displays (a large percentage of) all files, you could try setting File visibility to Visible or Invisible:\n\nIt took several minutes for Finder to search for all files, during which it used over 100% CPU.\nEven though system files are included, the results include less than half of all my files, which is probably at least partially because Spotlight doesn't index all files.\n", "Q: Temperature different of adapter since Mountain Lion (maybe only rMBP related) Since I've got ML (Mountain Lion) installed, I've got the feeling that my adapter (Magsafe-2) is not getting as hot as before? \nSince this is my first Macbook, I really wasn't familiar with the adapter's temperature. My rMBP's adapter seemed to get so extensively hot, that I could actually smell it when holding it somewhat close to my face and could almost not keep it for longer period of time in my hand. \nThough, since I've got ML installed, it seems my adapter is cooler through charging my Macbook then before. Still, ofcourse, it gets hot, but definitely not as hot as before. \nI wondered - though not getting anything worthy out of knowing - if you guys are experiencing this as well?\n\nA: That's interesting, I a have been running a non-Retina i7 for over a year, Lion OSX, and have found that CPU and GPU get drastically throttled as MagSafe-1 gets hotter and hotter. Nothing unusual I guess but I didn't expect it to impact the performance of the machine.\nI may just upgrade to Mountain Lion, hopefully that will fix the throttling!\n\nA: Ambidex,\nThe power usage in the rMBP is MUCH better under Mountain Lion than it was under Lion.  This causes less wear and tear on the Magsafe.  Depending on the amount of charge needed it's quite possible the device will work harder to power up from 20% battery than from 80%.  \nT\n", "Q: Missing 'man' entries after upgrade Having upgraded from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion a few days ago, I find that most of the 'man' entries from section 3 (programming functions) are missing.

I see my mac 10.12.6 (Sierra) does not have that variable set.  According to \"man man\"  output, it uses /etc/man.conf to know where the directories are. You can add missing paths into that file.  That file may be overwritten by an mac os x update, so you may have to do it again.  To find your missing man3 files, which are probably still on your disk, try \"locate \\*man3\"  and it should list every directory with a man3 folder in it.\nBoyd\n", "Q: Where can I download the iPad logo?

For instance, I frequently have to re-enter my password into the Mac App Store.  Are there any tools or tweaks to tell the system to remember my password (maybe in the keychain), or to make the system ask for my password less frequently in other situations?\n\nA: OS X Mountain Lion makes it impossible to do that, because of Security Reasons. You can’t store your Mac App Store password or iTunes Store password in the keychain. For everything else, there’s 1Password.\n", "Q: Are there any security risks with leaving guest account enabled? Mac OS X comes with a guest account enabled by default.  Are there any security risks with leaving it enabled?  Are there reasons to disable the account?\n\nA: I'm not a security expert, but just browsing the web, I came up with this:\n\nThere are, however, some system directories, such as the Unix /tmp directory, that the guest account can write data to that may or may not be deleted at logout (or forced restart). The guest also has access to any installed applications, which could be used to perform malicious actions from your computer. If you must use the guest account, limit its access using Parental Controls. (MacWorld)\n\nFollowing up on the /tmp directory vulnerability, I found this:\n\nAlmost every security professional known that /tmp is the first place that hacker will looking at to place their malicious software and scripts for further gaining root access. However, there several ways to protect system /tmp. In this article will show you a simple method making secure /tmp for Linux and Unix. (PatCup)\n\nIf you want some examples of how a malicious hacker could use the /tmp directory to their advantage, here you go:\n\nIt is a Unix tradition to use a directory called /tmp (or /var/tmp or even /dev/shm) to hold temporary files used by programs.  This prevents a user's home directory from getting full of old useless files.\nSince everyone may write files into the /tmp directory, naturally there are some security concerns.  One feature of /tmp is that is has the text (or sticky) bit set, which means only the owner (or root) can delete or rename files in that directory.  However if an evil hacker can predict your filenames, they can create that file first (a denial of service).  They can also read your files, if created using a default umask value of 022.  Even if you immediately change the permissions, there will be a window of opportunity to access the file (sometimes called a race condition). (http://content.hccfl.edu/pollock/ShScript/TempFile.htm)\n\nOnce again, I don't know much about security so some of the info from the quotes might be incorrect.\nMost of that was going over the vulnerabilities of the /tmp directory, but in the first quote it's implied that there are other System directories that could potentially be accessed from the Guest account. However, unless you have top secret government information, I doubt that it's too much of a risk to enable the guest account.\n", "Q: Removing duplicate application entries in context menus \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I remove duplicate “Open With” context menu items in Finder.app? \n\nI've installed Parallels Desktop 7 and I believe it's the reason I have duplicate application entries.

I'm planning to use it so that I can extend my desktop in my MacBook Pro.\nI have some reservations if it would work fine. I've heard others complaining that it doesn't work when they attach their VGA cords to the device. Do you think the cause of it is just their monitors or MacBooks not capable of supporting a the highest resolution?  The maximum resolution of my 13\" MBP is 1280x800. I'm quite sure that my 20\" monitor can handle this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Am I right with my hunch?\n\n*What's the issue why other monitors tend to not work at all when attached to the device?\n\n\nA: I have several aftermarket mini DisplayPort to VGA adapters (el-cheapo like Monoprice.com) to work perfectly with several Macs and various monitors and projectors.\nMoreover, I am ever pleased and surprised at how well VGA works considering the old tech.\nIt should \"just work\" for a 20\" VGA display. The Displays control panel will let you select resolutions up to the max supported by the display and extend the desktop from your MacBook. Performance should be excellent. \nI use a cheap mini DisplayPort adapter ($9) with 2008 and 2010 15\" MacBook Pros and various VGA displays and projectors and it has always worked with no fuss, even over way-too-long VGA cables (50') connected to a high-def projector.\nVGA is component video so signal integrity means a lot for image clarity. For a desktop 20\" LCD display on a normal cable, it will appear fine.\n\nA: Does your monitor have DVI? I strongly suggest against VGA when possible. It has inferior quality, resolution support, and manual shape/size adjustment of the image is a pain.\nMacBooks with mini DisplayPort or Thunderbolt have the graphical oomph to drive at least 2560x1600 via a Dual-Link DVI adapter.

Of course, you can also download the source and compile yourself or use homebrew as the accepted answer states.\n\nA: Here is the procedure I recommend, for those who are comfortable with the command-line and with Homebrew:\nInstall Homebrew.\nRun the following on the command line (in Terminal):\nbrew install macvim --with-override-system-vim\nbrew linkapps\n\nEdit your shell startup files to ensure that /usr/local/bin comes first in your $PATH.\nIf you use vim as $VISUAL or $EDITOR, add `export VISUAL='mvim -f' to your environment (details).\nCheck that you installed everything correctly by running\nbrew doctor\n\nNow, you can run the graphical MacVim on a file by running mvim foo.txt from the command-line.  Or, you can run the text-based editor by running vim foo.txt.  Also, if other programs (e.g., git) fork off a separate editor, they'll run the graphical MacVim.\nSee also How to run mvim (MacVim) from Terminal? and Set macvim as default application after homebrew installation.\n\nA: It's pretty straightforward, just download the latest snapshot from GitHub and follow the instructions in the readme.txt\n", "Q: suddenly key 'p' is doing strange things I have macbook pro early 2011 and i have upgraded the os to mountain lion.\nToday key 'p' is doing strange things. \np0p0p0\n--/p0p0\n-/-/p0\n\\p0\nabove things came when i am pressing 'p' key, onscreen it shows volume notification and reduces the volume. \nso now its working like F11 key and printing garbage things.\nHow can i trouble shoot this p key problem?\nNote: in this post i have used p using copy paste.\n\nA: You have spilt some (lots) water on your keyboard.

I already had windows xp installed as a bootcamp partition, and it seems os x copied windows font (tahoma, verdana, surely others...) to /Library/Fonts/\nThey now appear in webpages, and for example Tahoma does not look that good, and I'd like to this not happening.\nIs it safe to just delete them ? Do I need to rebuild the font cache after this ?\nI once remember that just after installing bootcamp + os x, os x asked me if it could copy those font, but it just did without asking me first.\n\nA: You can turn them off in Font Book without deleting. Open the Font Book app in your applications, scroll down until you find the troublesome font and right click/secondary click on it and select \"disable font\".\nAlternatively, problems can often arise if you have duplicate fonts like where osx has installed both the windows fonts and it's own fonts. In this case you could also try right clicking and selecting \"resolve duplicates\".\n", "Q: What is sound drift correction on OS X and how should I use it? On Audio MIDI Setup there is an option to to enable/disable audio drifting for any sound output device?\nWhat is this and how should I use it?\nI do want to enable sound output for multiple devices: HDI TV and normal jack as I do not always know which one is connected. \n\nA: *\n\n*Select your clock source at the top of the window. This is the audio interface who's wordclock will be used for the other audio interfaces in the created aggregate.\n\n*Select the Sample Rate, this is the sample rate that all the other audio interfaces will sample at. \n\n*Drift correction should not be checked on the interface select above. All other audio interfaces / devices should have the Drift Correction box checked. \nDrift Correction keeps these interfaces/devices in sync (in-time) with the primary interface from the drop-down menu at the top that you have chosen, which becomes the Master clock. \n\nA: (This is answering an old question, but since I was researching the topic...)\nIt's to do with keeping different hardware devices in sync.\nWhen you create an aggregate device, more than one piece of sound generation hardware may be required to operate concurrently. Even if these devices are running at the same sample rate, they're probably all using independent hardware clocks to send buffered audio through their DACs and actually generate sound. If these clocks get out of sync, the audio would drift out of sync too and eventually one or more of the hardware devices would start exhausting its data buffer before others had finished with theirs. In short, it'd get glitchy and break.\nSo for example, you might connect a TV via HDMI and use it as a second monitor to watch movies, but you might want both the TV speakers and your computer speakers to be used - maybe you've plugged in computer speakers with a subwoofer and you like the added bass that the TV speakers can't produce. So you use Audio MIDI Setup to add an aggregate device for both your computer and the TV. But the computer is sending digital audio over HDMI to the TV which independently decodes it - there needs to be some way to make sure both the computer and the TV decode at the same rate, without any clock drift over time screwing things up.\nOver digital links like SP/DIF, hardware devices can both transmit and receive a signal in addition to the audio data which is used to perform this kind of synchronisation. It's called word clock. It's really important when you're recording digital audio, so that the recording digital sink is kept rigidly in sync with the transmitting digital source. You can find out more about it here:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_clock\nIf your aggregate devices all support word clock, then you don't need software drift correction - the master will be used as a word clock source and the word clock data will be sent to the other devices. They'll all use that clock to keep themselves in sync. Otherwise, any devices except the master which don't support word click need the drift correction switch turning on. This uses some sort of software mechanism for trying to combat clock drift (I don't know how it actually achieves this, or how robust / reliable it is).\nIn the TV example, you'd set the computer as the master audio device and add in the TV audio output, enabling drift correction for the TV (but not for the master device as that wouldn't make sense - the TV audio clock is corrected using them master as the reference). For another example of how word clock and drift correction work together, see steps 11 and 12 here:\nhttp://www.absolutemusic.co.uk/community/entries/set-aggregate-audio-device-mac-os-lion\n", "Q: How to use Dropbox to share files in Finder by right click on Mac OS 10.8?

Is there a was in Apple Aperture to batch edit files?\n\nA: The easiest way to do it is make your edits to one photo, then save the adjustments (I think it's called save as preset in the menu), then select all your photos and apply your saved adjustments.\n\nA: Yes. In Aperture it's called lift and stamp. Apple have a video explaining how to do just that here.\n", "Q: How to re-encrypt a decrypted partition that says \"The Core Storage-targetvolume is already encrypted\"? I encrypted a Lion partition called \"Storage\" and it worked perfectly. I needed to decrypt it momentarily because I had some issues, but now I want to encrypt the same volume again and it says \"The Core Storage-targetvolume is already encrypted\".\nOther partitions work fine with decrypting and encrypting, just not this one. Perhaps it has something to do with my home-folder being on the \"Storage\" partition, but it is strange that encrypting worked the first time and now it doesn't anymore after I decrypted it.\n\nA: When you say you decrypted it momentarily, it can take from minutes to days depending on the size of the partition and data within it and the speed of your system. The same goes for encrypting. The amount of free space also impacts how long things will take as it needs to encrypt/decrypt files somewhere.\nIt could be the case that it hasn't finished decrypting it yet.\n", "Q: How do I batch set the files \"date modified\" to the \"date created\"?

I am trying to upgrade my mid 2009 13\" MacBook Pro with a Samsung 830 SSD but I am experiencing a lot of issues.\nThe issues starts at installation time, when I sometimes get a kernel panic when I try to setup the system with the SSD in pace of the original HDD.\nIf the installation succeeds, the game is not over. I can still reproduce I/O errors running BlackMagic Disk Test Speed.\nI never tried to go on since I feel that the system is unreliable for day to day usage.\nI did both PRAM and SMC reset, but none of them seems to be effective. My Mac and the SSD firmware are updated to the latest versions available.\nI also tried to replace the original SATA cable (Which works fine with the original HDD) with another SATA cable coming from another Mac but I get the same error again.\nI exclude RAM issues too. I tested with different RAM banks (All of them working perfectly) and the SSD problem is still there.\nThe very same SSD is working properly on a Windows machine and on another Mac, so I would exclude a disk failure and I guess that there is something wrong with my Mac. The SSD also works perfectly when used in a USB box.\nDo you have any suggestion on what should I do next?\n\nA: This is my 2 cents worth. I have no specific experience for Samsung SSDs but I do have a fair amount of experience with Mac Laptops and MacMinis with SSDs.\nI am post specifically because I have been fighting with an apparently \"similar issue\" and have come to the conclusion that SSDs are more tricky than hard drives fro a troubleshooting point of view. I have had to return a few SSDs to the manufacturer ( distributors ). In fact, I returned one to OWC just today that has resisted attempts to update it's firmware - twice over several months and began exhibiting poor performance and I was having kernal crashes that I believe were SSD related. I use a utility called \"Trim Enabler\" for two reasons: 1) I like to watch metrics that perhaps give insight on storage health - the observable health parameters of the SSD and a second Harddisk on my 2012 MacBook Pro and 2) because it turns on the Trim functionality which SOME SSDs like ( need ) or something....\nWhile OWC ( macsales.com ) is a Mac specialty supplier and appear to be experts and have been good to me over the years, but in this case of SSDs, they have failed to come up with a way that I have access to test my own SSDs or a surefire efficient way to identity if the SSD is the issue or if firmware update will help and thus I returned the SSD today and replaced it with a Crucial SSD which uses different firmware - Sandforce firmware. I have experience with the Crucial SSDs for almost 4 years on Mac's and they seem to work well. It was Crucial who told me to used the 3rd party software called Trim Enabler to \"enable trim\" after I experienced significant performance issues that Crucial tech support believed was because the SSD was not doing necessary maintenance on itself - i.e. Trim.\nNow with all that said, I believe there is still a bit of black magic going on - perhaps it is just marketing and/or marketing secrecy so that SSD makers secret sauce does leak out. Personally, I don't like the effects of the secret sauce on the end user's ability to get genuine information and tech support so they can make informed decision on their purchases of SSD.\nEven so, I might recommend you try a OWC or Crucial SSDs based on those companies recommendations and warrenty policies. I no long expect trouble free saling or perfect performance or zero maintenance for a busy SSD. I have never done firmware updates on hard disks but SSDs appear to need these firmware tweeks.\nI would love some genuine information at the global statistics level, so that I can better gauge my experience against what the global pool experience is showing.\n\nA: If your MBP has SATA II (assuming mid-2009 model), does your new SSD support SATA II? I have a similar problem. Having (MacBookPro7,1, mid 2010, 13″) with Samsung SSD 840 Evo 250GB, which supports both SATA II (3Gb/s) and SATA III (6GB/s).\nWhen installed SSD as the main drive had I/O Errors, even failed to boot completely. One SSD died completely, but was replaced. I tried to run SSD with and w/o TRIM, no difference - still I/O errors. With HDD all works fine. I haven't changed the SATA cable yet, but wonder if the whole problem is not just SSD that hardly can run at SATA II mode although it should.\n", "Q: How to recover accidentally deleted data? My data has been deleted accidentally don't know how it got deleted.\nYesterday when I left office the folders where at proper place and when today morning I opened my Mac OS Lion  10.7.4. I found some project files to be missing.\nHow can I recover back my all data?\n\nA: The only sure way is to restore from your latest backup, which is why Apple added Time Machine for easy use.\nIf you do not have that then the first thing to do is turn the machine off so that no more data is written to the disk. Then boot the machine off a recovery disk like Diskwarrior. If you are lucky then you can restore data if not the next step would be to send the disk to a specialist and pay them to see what they can get back. If you have a solid state disk then I think you are unlucky and even a specialist will have problems getting data back.\n", "Q: How do I remove Twitter and Facebook from Mountain Lion? I want to remove Twitter and Facebook (in the future) from Mountain Lion.\nIs it enough to simply remove Twitter.sharingservice from     \n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ShareKit.framework/Versions/A/Plugins\n\nWhat about all these other entries:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/Social.framework\n/System/Library/Accounts/Access\n/System/Library/Accounts/Authentication\n/System/Library/CoreServices/SocialPushAgent\n/System/Library/InternetAccounts/\n/System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.twitterd.plist\n/System/Library/Messages/Plugins/FaceTime.imservice\n/System/Library/SocialServices\n\n\nA: Honestly I don't see any benefit in removing the Twitter/Facebook libraries. It may break the installed version as well as lead to problems when upgrading to 10.8.1 etc.\nIf you want to be sure that nothing you do is ever ending up in Twitter or Facebook just don't log in to these services in Preferences.\n\nA: You can’t just remove it. It’s so tied into the OS that you can’t. If you remove some frameworks, it will cause some apps to crash. It’s better to just turn it off.\n\nA: You can remove anything you want from the ShareKit.framework folder. Keep the files you remove in a backup folder and replace them if there is a problem. You Mac won't break, the service that requires the particular framework just won't work. I've removed everything from there and my machine still booted and worked, just in a more limited way.\nDon't be afraid to experiment.\nUltimately, if you don't provide your social passwords to OS X, it can't operate on those accounts. I don't know if it can pull passwords from Safari's password storage service, so keep that in mind if you let Safari remember your FB/Twitter passwords.\n", "Q: How does Versions work with iCloud? Just wondering how, if at all, Versions on Pages for Mountain Lion (10.8) works with iCloud, specifically in relation to iOS 5 devices.\nMy own testing seems to indicate that a Pages document created on the Mac saves versions in iCloud that you can revert to but only on the Mac (can't find an iOS interface for Versions). However, if I create a document on Pages for iOS (forcing an upload to iCloud after each edit) I can't revert to previous versions made on iOS, even on the Mac. One time, when I tried to do this, I saw a message saying the file is stored on a volume which doesn't support permanent version storage. However I have been unable to reproduce this message.\nCan anyone enlighten me as to how Versions is supposed to work with iCloud? Is it a Mac-only feature, not available on iOS? If so, how best to guard against unwanted edits on iOS? Should I just prevent the doc from being uploaded to the cloud until I am happy with it, and use the undo / redo feature?\nAs I understand it, we only have Versions on the Mac because we also have Autosave. On iOS all saving (to the cloud) is done manually (the equivalent of the old command-s on Snow Leopard) thus eliminating the need for iOS versions. Have I got the correct picture here?\nSorry for the long post! I'd really appreciate any replies.\n\nA: iCloud itself does support document revisions, and my understanding is that it does the same job OS X does for versions stored locally (keeps track of all the small changes, and is in charge of assembling all the chunks into different versions). So any OS X app that supports versioning and iCloud storage should handle both together seamlessly, the same as if it's stored locally. It sounds like you're seeing the expected results in this case.\nOn iOS it's a bit more complicated - apps have access to other revisions of the document, but because there's no standard way for a user to see different versions (as in OS X), it's up to the app developer to deal with this. I believe the recommended practice for iOS apps is to only keep versions as necessary (for example, dealing with two conflicting versions).\nBased on my understanding, if you create a document on iOS, then edit it on OS X, you should be able to view the revisions on OS X, but iOS will only show the \"current\" one, and OS X will probably only include one iOS-edited version of the file, with whatever versions were edited on OS X. However, this all depends a lot on how the iOS developer implements iCloud storage, and based on my reading of the developer documentation, if an iOS app has what it can satisfactorily decide is the canonical up-to-date version of a document, it may discard all previous versions. That may be why you were running into issues with iOS-created Pages documents.\nUltimately, iCloud is a pretty complex thing, and while they go to great lengths to make it seem simple for the user, some of that complexity can get in the way.\nTL;DR version: using OS X only, versions should sync fine. Bringing iOS into the mix can change things depending on the developer's implementation.\n\nA: The iOS version of iWork is severely limited. Yeah, it does not support versioning, but changes do sync in under 5 seconds. Whenever you save an edit on iOS, the previous versions get overwritten. That’s very, very sad. I wish iWork on iOS was better. Your options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Forget that versioning exists and be happy that changes sync with 5 seconds.\n\n*Don’t use iWork on iOS or don’t use it for editing.\n\n*Switch to another Productivity suite (I can’t find anything comparable to iWork, so I won’t make suggestions)\n\n\nYou can also submit feedback to Apple about this.\n", "Q: How to create nested folders in iCloud Documents? I can’t create more than one level of folders in iCloud Documents from iWork. I really want to move my Documents folder (which is all iWork documents) to the cloud. It’s neatly arranged in folders on my disk, but I can’t just drag the folder to cloudify it. Is there any workaround to this problem?\n\nA: I'm afraid not. iCloud is designed for iOS devices without a user accessible file system. iCloud files are strictly associated with apps and only allow one level of folder nesting.\nIf you're not happy with this, you can send feedback to Apple about it here: http://www.apple.com/feedback/icloud.html\nYou could use Dropbox instead (https://www.dropbox.com/) which has more flexibility around file organisation. The downside is that you only get 2GB free but you can earn more free storage in various ways. Google Drive (https://drive.google.com/start#home) gives you 5GB free.\n\nA: You activate one of the iWorks applications, choose Open from the File menu, choose iCloud in the upper left of the dialog box. In here, you can drag and drop documents on each other just like you do on the iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch.\n\nA: I use a tag based filing system, so that I can group files from different applications into subjects.\nThe tags all have subject names and colours are only used to show them up.\n", "Q: How to partition an SSD that fails with error 69888 - couldn't unmount disk?

[n] y\n-bash-3.2# \n\n\nA: I can't test it but I think that if you erase the MBR (with dd instead of fdisk) and the partition table record you should be able to re-format you ssd.\nBoot from cd or external hd and open terminal\nthis code erase the MBR:\n# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk0 bs=446 count=1\n\nthis one erase the partition table also:\n# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk0 bs=512 count=1\n\nIf you erase just the mbr you could use testdisk to attempt to recover data (in case you don't have erased the disk label).\n\nA: I got the same \"error 6988 couldn't unmount disk\" message. It was due to unclosed references to the drive/partition - particularly I had a terminal window open and the PWD was on that volume. Close that window and close all Finder windows that has reference to that volume (or simply cd to a different directory outside of the mounted disk tree), redo the steps, it should work.\n\nA: You have to close all the Finder's instances pointing to the SSD/SD, same for the terminal windows etc. Don't forget to close cloud drive apps such as Dropbox if you are sharing folders that are stored on that SSD/SD drive. In case you have your Photo library on this drive, don't forget to kill the Photo analysis daemons (processes) - this was actually the last thing that prevented my SD to unmout before converting it to APFS. To kill those processes, you can open Activity Monitor app and type \"photo\" to the searchbox. You will see something like \"photolibraryd\" and \"photoanalysisd\". I had to kill these two in order to get the SD drive unlocked for unmounting.\n\nA: I was trying to format my second, data disk in my iMac 5K (128 blade as boot) many times and it failed with the same error.\nFinally, I switched to View > Show All Devices and performed the same operation again on my data volume. This time, it worked fine.\n\n", "Q: AirPlay option disappeared? I have the AppleTV connected via WiFi. I tried AirPlay via WiFi using my iPhone and it mirrored perfectly. The next day, the AppleTV was sleeping before I turned it on using the Apple Remote. However, the option to mirror my iPhone (or even my iPad and MacBook) is not there anymore! I tried using the AppleTV via the remote and works fine, it's just that the AirPlay option is gone.\nWhy is that?\nUnplugging the AppleTV from the power source and plugging it back in got the AirPlay option back. Is there a way to make sure this doesn't happen again ?\nEdit: Using an Ethernet cable fixes the problem, however I do not wish to keep it wired. Why would the AppleTV have problems only on wireless?\n\nA: It's hard to say for sure, but I'm guessing there was a problem with the network discovery service. Apple uses Bonjour to advertise various network services (iTunes sharing, file sharing, AirPlay support) without the need to manually input configuration data. Unfortunately it can be a bit prickly at times, so if somewhere along the way the \"Hey, I'm an Apple TV\" message got lost, didn't get sent or received by your iPhone or Mac, it won't show up as an available device.\nUnfortunately, the way Bonjour broadcasts the data seems to be a bit temperamental at times. I'm not aware of any real fix, but a restart almost always seems to fix it. If you're on a Mac, you can try restarting the daemon responsible by running the following two commands in Terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist\n\n*sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist\nBut that will only fix things if the problem is the Mac not receiving the messages properly - if it's on the Apple TV's end, then restarting that is the best fix.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I just turned Wi-Fi off and on again and the icon was back! Magic! \n\nA: When the AppleTV wakes up, the icon should show up again very quickly. \nIf you have a router with Bonjour Proxy (like Airport Extreme or Time Capsule) they remember the Bonjour announce even while the AppleTV sleeps and can wake it up when needed.\n\nA: Sadly using an ethernet cable did not really fix the problem !!\nThe way I managed to fix it is to get a new router with dual band signals. Having both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz supported devices around the house, the router managed their connections efficiently. Note that the iphones use 2.4Ghz and the AppleTV uses 5Ghz. So the solution that fixed MY problem regarding the airplay option is to get a new dual band router. \n\nA: I found when i changed router to an airport extreme it fixed the issue. I had airplay working fully on iphone 5 but nothing on my mac. \n\nA: if it's not an internal error, sometimes it's just a glitch. I usually just close the laptop and then open it again. This allows your computer another chance to look for devices and networks. \n\nA: It turns out that you can fix this problem by going to your Settings app and selecting General -> International -> Language.  Then change your language from whatever you are using now (such as English) to another language (I chose French).  Then switch it back to your original language.\nThat's it.  Now when you double-click and the Home button and then swipe twice from left to right, you should see the AirPlay icon.  \n\nA: I had the same problem. My iPhones streamed to Apple TV no problem but the AirPlay icon simply disappeared on the MacBook Pro with the settings saying that there was no device detected.\nFinally sorted it out: I had McAfee Firewall and as soon as I disabled the Firewall, the AirPlay icon appears again!\nNot sure if this applies to you.\n\nA: I'v found that sometimes when you leave a wifi network with an iPad and or iPhone that when you go back to that network it can join the Guest side if you have been logged in before, airplay needs the main system (that your main Mac is using ) to work.\n\nA: My airplay icon disappeared from my Mac Airbook during use.  Tried the suggested solutions, resetting etc, didn't work. Went to system preferences > display and then ticked box in bottom LH corner - \"show mirroring options in the menu bar when available\".  Icon re-appeared. Don't know why it disappeared in first place!\n\nA: I followed all the suggestions, restarted both Macbook and Apple TV, disconnected from Wi-Fi network and connected again, but it didn't work.\nI tried disconnecting my iPhone (Airplay was working on it) from the Wi-Fi network and then disconnecting and connecting Wi-Fi again on the Mac. It worked! I guess you it's network issues and you just have to be patient and not throw the Mac at your tv. \n\nA: try stopping any services that uses port 80 of your network. In simple terms disable anti virus firewall, Teamviewer and Skype. Restart the device and try again. This is a common problem. Hope this helps.\n\nA: The reason may be that after the Apple TV had its major update it turned Airplay off.  Just go to Settings>Airplay and turn it back on.\n", "Q: How to install ImageMagick on 10.6 (Snow Leopard) using a precompiled binary (without a package manager)?

I recently lost my iPhone 4 so I went and bought a new iPhone 4s. I set up my new phone with the same iTunes ID and password that I have always used. I soon realized that whatever songs I had bought on my old phone were not on my new phone. How do I get those songs back? I thought I had subscribed to the cloud but apparently that didn't include my music? All of my old contacts and pictures showed up on my phone but the only music I could get was what was on my computer. Help please! I have quit a few songs missing!\n\nA: I don't believe purchased music is automatically downloaded to a new device, since you might not want all of your music on all of your devices. On your new phone, just go to iTunes Store → More → Purchased → Music and you can re-download everything there.\n\n\n\nA: If you've purchased the songs through itunes they should still be available in your purchases. Try redownloading them on your computer and syncing them with your phone that way.\n\nA: If you have the songs downloaded on your PC you can re-add them to the iTunes library then sync them with your iPhone but if you don't have them just  go to iTunes and press on iStore go to your purchases and just download them again\n", "Q: Unable to upgrade iMac to Snow Leopard I am unable to upgrade my iMac to Snow Leopard even though it seems to meet all the requirements.

After upgrading to 10.6 (Snow Leopard) Adobe Photoshop gives an error message on every start of the application:\n\n\"One or more files in the Adobe Application Support folder, necessary\n  for running Photoshop, are missing. Please run the Phtoshop installer\n  and re-install Photoshop.\"\n\nHow to fix this Photoshop CS3 on every launch error \"One or more files in the Adobe Application Support folder\" message that start occurring after upgrading to 10.6?\n\nA: The problem is that /Library/ScriptingAdditions/Adobe Unit Types.osax isn’t loading. It’s possible the file is actually missing, but it’s more likely that you’ve upgraded to Snow Leopard.\nSnow Leopard requires 64-bit versions of every plug-in, including OSAXes. The versions of Adobe Unit Types that shipped with CS3 and CS4 are 32-bit.\nTo fix this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the 64-bit version of Adobe Unit Types.\n\n*Delete the old /Library/ScriptingAdditions/Adobe Unit Types file (when it's there).\n\n*Drag the downloaded Adobe Unit Types.osax file to your /Library/ScriptingAdditions/ folder.\n\n*Launch Photoshop.\n\n\nsources:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://paulschreiber.com/blog/2010/11/02/howto-fix-photoshops-missing-application-support-files-error/\n\n*http://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/kb/unit-type-conversion-error-applescript.html\n\nA: This has happened to me before when I reinstalled Leopard and upgraded to Snow Leopard 10.6. When I tried to double-click or drag and drop to Photoshop the files wouldn't open. I looked in the Library folder and there was no ScriptingAdditions folder. \nSo, I went to my Time Machine backup folders (on my external drive) and chose a backup folder  from 3 days ago. Opened Library and found ScriptingAdditions folder, which contained the Adobe Types Unit file. Dragged the ScriptingAdditions folder to my desktop and then put it in the upper level Library of my hard drive. Works every time. \n", "Q: Mountain Lion sometimes hangs when mouse enters Dock – pointer is movable, but the MacBook Air seems otherwise frozen I have a mid-2011 13\" MacBook Air (MacBookAir4,2 with Intel HD Graphics 3000).\nSince installing Mountain Lion I sometimes encounter a problem when I move the mouse cursor over the dock to click something.  \nSometimes I get pinwheeled, sometimes I don't. \nWhenever the problem occurs: \n\n\n*\n\n*there appears a 75% transparent label for a dock item\n\n*I can continue to move the mouse\n\n*the computer does not recover, I resort to a forced shutdown. \n\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any common denominators yet, other than it always happens as I mouse over the dock.\nIs there a log or anything I can look at to rectify the problem?\n\nA: Not a solution to the problem, but I found that closing the lid and waiting until the computer sleeps (status led pulsing) and opening it works.\nAt least its better than a forced shutdown right?\n\nA: Reading this question alongside an earlier comment from the opening poster …\nSuspect an issue affecting WindowServer\nDiagnosis by and of the system: \n\n\n*\n\n*long edition (an accepted answer)\n\n*brief edition for power users\n– in a case such as this, what's gathered by sysdiagnose is likely to include everything that's required for human analysis of the problem. \nFor a focused analysis, we need more detail in the question. I'll suggest an edition and maybe add a comment …\n\nA: It could be related to the system trying to zoom in on the nearest Dock icon to your mouse (is magnification on ?) or maybe the system crashes because it can't find the font used to display Dock items name.\nHave you tried to create a new user account and reproduce the issue there ?

With Safari 5 in Lion, I used the Activity window to save video files. \nSafari 6 has no Activity window. \nWith Mountain Lion, what is the best way to replicate what I could do before?\n\nA: The Activity Window is gone in Safari 6, but you can get most of the functionality with the Page Resources window of Web Inspector.\nTo enable that, go to Safari's preferences, and on the Advanced tab, check Show Develop menu in menu bar:\n\nThen you can view the page's resources by clicking Show Page Resources… in the Develop menu, or pressing ⌥⌘A.\nThat will give you a window with a sidebar similar to this one (which I took from a Youtube page):\n\nIt groups things a bit differently than the old activity window, but it should display all the same things. FLV files should be in the Other folder, and you can use the search bar at the bottom to filter for certain strings.\nAlternatively, you may be interested in the ClickToPlugin Safari extension, which can do HTML5 replacement of a lot of Flash web video, and in most cases gives you the option to download the file directly just by right-clicking on the video.\n\nA: *\n\n*Enable the develop menu from the advanced tab of the preferences window.\n\n*Press option-command-I and reload the page for the video.\n\n*Double-click the resource for the video:\n\n\n*Focus the location bar and press option-return. (Command-S doesn't save the complete file.)\nAnother way to download YouTube videos is to use youtube-dl:\nbrew install youtube-dl\nyoutube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=$id\n\nyoutube-dl includes the title and ID of the video in the filename by default. It also works with other video sharing sites, and for example it downloads all parts of videos at twitch.tv that are served as multiple resources.\n\nA: YouTube Options is a Safari extension that shows Download Options -- WebM, MP4, FLV, 3GP, 3D -- right beneath the video.\nAvailable for Chrome and Opera too.\n\nA: There's a great application called Jaksta that I use that makes it really easy to download all kinds of media from the web. All you have to do is open Jaksta, then go to Safari and play any video or music you want. Jaksta then downloads the file and converts it automatically. Here's a review of Jaksta from MacNews:\n\nJaksta supports just about all streaming formats and protocols (including FLV, HTTP, RTMP, IceCast, WMV, ASF, MP3, MP4, SWF, etc.), which means it can capture video from thousands of web sites including YouTube and Facebook. What's more, because of Jaksta’s powerful audio-capturing capabilities, customers can download streaming audio from their favorite music and radio sites.\nIn addition to allowing Mac users to save their favorite videos, songs, and radio programs, Jaksta can automatically convert the downloaded files to a variety of devices. For example, you can save files as QuickTime for the iPod, iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV, as well as import 'em into iTunes. A drop-down menu lets you choose the conversion method you want.\nJaksta can automatically convert captured media files to other formats. The default setting is Default Conversion. This is best if you’d like everything that you download to be easily playable on your Mac. For example, it converts downloaded FLV’s to .mov files that play perfectly in QuickTime.\n\nHere's a description from the Jaksta website:\n\nJaksta for Mac is easy to use: just open Jaksta, then play the video, music or audio you’d like to capture. You will find that your media is recorded up to ten times faster than playback speed, since Jaksta is grabbing files directly from the web site where they are hosted. This downloading technique means that the quality of the recorded files are perfect copies of the original.\n\nAnyway, I highly recommend Jaksta (and I'm not affiliated with them in any way).\n\nA: I use and like many of the Safari extensions for flv/youtube/html5 etc. But a more general solution for the missing activity monitor list is provided by hetima with SafariStand \n\nA: The easiest way to download flv files on most sites is to use click2plugin safari extension\n", "Q: How do I create a keyboard shortcut to go to a specific folder? I have a folder called ~/Documents/Work and I'd like to make the Finder shortcut cmd-shift-W go to that folder, similar to how cmd-shift-H goes to the Home folder (and the equivalent shortcuts for Applications, etc., all under the \"Go\" menu).\nIs it possible to do this? And if so, how can I do it?\n\nA: Try this AppleScript:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    set workFolder to (POSIX file \"/Users/yourname/Documents/Work\") as alias\n    reveal workFolder\nend tell\n\nFor some reason, the tilde doesn't work in the path, so you have to enter your home folder.

Quick scroll to top and bottom seems to work, at least in Firefox.\n\nA: I looked in System Preferences and didn't see any options for a three-finger swipe gesture. However, there are many applications that enable you to create custom gestures. Here are a couple (these two are both free):\n\n\n*\n\n*Better Touch Tool\nHere's a description from their download page:\n\nBetterTouchTool adds many new, fully customizable gestures to Magic Mouse, Macbook Touchpad and now even the Magic Trackpad!\n  \n  These gestures are customizable:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*three finger swipes (up/down/left/right)\n  \n*three finger tap\n  \n*three finger click\n  \n\nThere are many other gestures that are customizable, but you seem like you want some sort of three finger gesture so I listed those.\n\n\n*\n\n*MagicPrefs\n\nMac OS X-only: MagicPrefs lets you create custom gestures (and override existing ones) to provide new multitouch functionality to your Apple input devices. It's like the great Multiclutch, which serves a similar purpose, but with added power and precision that gives you serious control over even the nuances of your gestures.\n\n  You have five fingers and MagicPrefs recognizes that, letting you assign actions to taps and clicks based on the number of fingers present on the mouse. Additionally, it supports swiping, rotating, and pinching actions. You can make these actions do carry out tasks like zoom in and out of the screen, start Exposé or Dashboard, initiate Quicklook, and even run AppleScripts. If you find a gesture is too sensitive, or not sensitive enough, you can adjust that. You can even create presets for specific circumstances, so you can assign certain gestures for when you're working and others when you're gaming.\n\n\nA: In settings under \"More Gestures\" I changed the top 'Swipe between pages' setting to 'swipe with two or three fingers' and it's working great in Firefox and Safari. No more speed-scrolling for the fingers!\n\nA: I saw that this is a known issue. The workaround is to hold down the Option key and then do the three finger swipe. I miss my \"home\" and \"end\" scrolling, too!\n\nA: Under \"More Gestures\", \"Swipe between pages\", there are three options - choose \"Swipe with three fingers\" - quick scroll to top/bottom with three finger vertical swipe is back! (Firefox).  Note that under \"Point and Drag\", \"Three finger drag\" should be deselected.\n\nA: The fix is: Switch \"Mission Control\" to four fingers. Then when three fingers are used in a vertical direction, the page jumps to top or bottom of page.\nThis works!\n\nA: alt + three fingers up/down should do the trick.\n\nA: It may seem annoying to have to install a piece of software to accomplish this, but BetterTouchTool really is the best option because you can do so much with it - and it's free.  I have three finger scroll down set to take me to the end/bottom of the page and three fingers up takes me to the top.  I use both of these all the time.  In web browsers, I use three fingers left & right to switch from tab to tab, left & right. I'd go CRAZY without that feature now.  The possibilities are pretty much endless, and it is very easy to work with.  I have poor vision, so I use four finger scroll down to zoom in and four fingers up to zoom out.  It's so handy.  \nWith BetterTouchTool, you can also program keyboard hotkeys.  I have a bunch of custom hotkeys I use to do all sorts of things, including fire off various applescripts.  I mean, really...  who uses the brightness keyboard keys on a desktop?  Not me.  So, I reassigned them with BetterTouchTool.\nEven better still...  if you have an Apple Remote that you're not using, you can use BetterTouchTool to assign what you want the buttons to do.  \nBetterTouchTool will give you so much power over customizing how you interact with your Mac.  I've been using it for ages and I'd go crazy if I had to give it up.  Even if it cost a hundred dollars, I'd recommend it. I'm not kidding when I say it's literally THAT good.  And it's free.\n", "Q: Turn on automatic update I'd like my Mac OS X machine to automatically install updates for any software where it can, with no interaction from me.\nSystem updates, updates to applications, security patches -- I want them all.  I'd prefer to not have to do anything.  I'd like the machine to simply download and install them in the background, automatically, without requiring me to click anything, approve anything, or take any further action.\nIs there a way to do it, on Mountain Lion?\n\nA: OS X has some support for automatically installing updates, but it's limited to \"system data files and security updates\" - what exactly constitute system data files, I'm not sure, but presumably any drivers that are typically distributed through Software Update, but possibly OS X point updates as well. Apple's documentation isn't clear on this.\nYou can enable this in the Software Update pane of System Preferences:\n\nHowever this won't update any apps, and possibly not all OS X updates either (again, Apple's documentation isn't very clear on what counts as a \"system data file\").\nThe other solution you may be interested in is AppFresh, which claims to be a one-stop shop for all software updates, OS X or 3rd party. I haven't used it, but it seems to be able to integrate with and automatically install from Software Update (and they list Mountain Lion compatibility, so I'm assuming that includes updates through the App Store now), apps that use the fairly popular Sparkle updater, as well as Microsoft and Adobe updaters.\n\n\nA: All system updates and updates to apps from the Mac App Store are downloaded automatically. When they have finished downloading, a notification alert pops up, saying so. You just have to click on “Update” on that alert, and the update starts in the background.\n", "Q: Does FileVault prompt for passwords more often? If I enable FileVault on Mountain Lion, will it make my machine ask me for my password more often?\nFor example, right now I have my machine configured so that when it goes to sleep, if I wake it up within 15 minutes, I don't need to enter my password when I wake it up.  Can I still do that, if I enable FileVault?  Or will FileVault force me to enter my password every time I wake up my machine, period?\n\nA: No. It will not prompt you for your password when it wakes up unless you have that selected in the \"Security\" pane in System Preferences. I've had FileVault enabled for as long as I've had my Macbook, and I don't believe that it has asked me for my password once except for when I was first setting it up.\n", "Q: How to hit \"right-control\" in VirtualBox on a remote Linux system over RDP via CoRD? I'm connecting using CoRD to a remote Linux system running xrdp.  On that Linux system, I'm running VirtualBox.  To escape from Virtualbox, I need to hit a \"right control\" key.  Trouble is... I don't know how.\nAnyone have experience with this kind of arrangement?  Suggestions?\n\nA: I was able to reprogram the VirtualBox Host Key.  It seems to think my right-command key is a left alt, but the end result is the same, it works now.  \n\nA: This question seems to indicate there is an app called \"Karabiner\" that might be able to help you: https://superuser.com/questions/48362/emulating-the-right-ctrl-key-on-macbook-pro-keyboard-lacking-an-actual-right-ctr\n", "Q: Magic Trackpad gestures don't work A brand new Magic Trackpad has been paired to a 2011 Mac mini with OSX 10.8. This mini has no other bluetooth devices. OSX was upgraded in-place from Lion to Mountain Lion.\nThe trackpad doesn't perform the gestures. \nThe Bluetooth menu shows that there's a mysterious bluetooth mouse device still as of yet unconnected. Various attempts to have it connect are unsuccessful. I suspect this is the gestures functionality, but it may be a previously connected mouse (unsure).\nVarious fixes attempted:\n\n\n*\n\n*reset PRAM with Cmd-Option-P-R at boot.\n\n*reset SMC by pressing power when unplugged\n\n\nHow can I get this Magic Trackpad to be recognized by OSX Mountain Lion?\nI don't have another Mac to try to reproduce this problem on (trying to determine if the trackpad itself is bad). \n\n\n\nA: It's possible that the kernel extension for the trackpad isn't loading properly.\nTry these steps and see what happens.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal and type kextstat | grep AppleBluetoothMultitouch and hit enter.\n\n*\n\n*If nothing along the lines of 69    0 0x19d2000  0x3000     0x2000     com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch (160.7) <68 64 30 4 3>\n shows up, then the kext isn't loading.\n\n\n*If you did get text similar to that above, try unloading the driver with the command sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleBluetoothMultitouch.kext. There may be some error messages that spit out, you can ignore them for the moment.\n\n*Try reloading it with the command sudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleBluetoothMultitouch.kext\nIf after that it doesn't show up in Keyboard Preferences, I'm out of ideas - it may be time for an exchange or a trip to the Genius bar, as it's likely a hardware issue.\nIt may also be helpful for other's diagnostic purposes to amend your question with the output from the Bluetooth section of System Information (in the /Applications/Utilities folder).\n\nA: Your trackpad preference page is an earlier version than 10.8. I think 10.7 or before, so this is likely a software issue** The 10.8 page has changed a lot compared to your screenshot.\n\nIn the lower left it should say trackpad battery level and have battery icon with percentage. Having had some bluetooth problems in the past it should give you a battery level even if it is zero, unless the device is not completely paired, possible hardware issue.\nWith 10.8 under the Bluetooth preference page it will give you a list of all Bluetooth devices that have been paired with your machine, at the bottom below the devices should be a + - and a sprocket with a drop down menu that includes connect, rename, add to favorites, update name, update services, and show more info. The - will delete the selected device, I would suggest you delete the ghost mouse and maybe even the trackpad and try to pair the trackpad again. Also on the bluetooth page I have discoverable not selected. \nIf you are running 10.8 and you have Apple Care I would contact Apple as your screen shot is showing an earlier version than 10.8 as far as I can tell.\n\nA: I had an issue like this with a Magic Mouse because I hadn't uninstalled USB Overdrive properly so /System/Library/Extensions/USBOverdrive.kext was still loaded.\nUSB Overdrive's support page has a list of other kernel extensions related to input devices:\n\n\n*\n\n*KensingtonMouseDriver.kext\n\n*LCC.kext\n\n*LogitechHIDDevices.kext\n\n*LogitechUnifying.kext\n\n*LogitechUSBHIDevices.kext\n\n*MacallyKMDriver.kext\n\n*MicrosoftKeyboard.kext\n\n*MicrosoftMouse.kext\n\n*SteerMouse.kext\n\n\nIf you have any of those, try running the uninstallers for the drivers or applications.\n", "Q: Cannot connect to Apple file servers after upgrading to 10.8 Since I can't find thousands of other users reporting this I'm thinking it's got to be something wrong with my system, but after I updated to Mountain Lion I can't connect to Apple file servers anymore.\nNot even a Drobo FS.\nThe servers still show up in my sidebar but they never successfully connect.\nI tried creating a new user and connecting from that one, but still had the same problem.\nThe OSX servers are running 10.6 & 10.7.\nReally? No one else is having this problem?\n\nA: It seems that obsolete iDisk settings in OSX 10.8 may prevent you to connect to a file server.\nYou need to run those commands in Terminal \n\ndefaults delete -g iToolsMember\ndefaults delete -g iToolsMemberDomain\n\nto get rid of those settings.\nSource: http://derflounder.wordpress.com/2012/08/03/odd-afp-and-smb-connection-problem-caused-by-idisk-going-away/\n", "Q: Protect privacy on my Mac What is the best way to protect my privacy when using my Mac?\nAssume I am a privacy-sensitive user, with Mountain Lion.  What software configuration should I do, to protect my privacy?  Is there any software you would recommend to protect my privacy, e.g., when using the web or other applications?  Which web browser is best, and what extensions are available to protect privacy while browsing the web?\n\nA: \nWhat extensions are available to protect privacy while browsing the web?\n\nI'm using Safari and there are a number of useful extensions for security.\n\n\n*\n\n*Google SSL\nThis extension makes it so every time you use the search bar, instead of searching www.google.com, your search is redirected to the Google SSL encrypted search site.\n\n*Do Not Track Plus\nDo Not Track Plus blocks tracking technologies that advertisers and other companies use to track your browsing behavior. Easily see who is tracking you at each website you visit and block any or all of them.\n\n*Google Disconnect\nGoogle is notified whenever you visit one of the more than 25 percent of sites on the web that include Google widgets (see http://j.mp/dcdefcon). Google Disconnect blocks traffic from third-party sites to Google servers but still lets you access Google services.\n\n*TrafficLight\nTrafficLight is taking the security-while-browsing concept where it belongs: in the browser. This extension will add a strong layer of security over your browsing experience without inducing speed penalties or system resource consumption. Part of the processing is done in the cloud with some intelligent small engines that make various checks on pages you're visiting enabling you to have top notch antiphishing and antimalware protection.\nYou can check out some more security extensions here.\nDuckDuckGo\nGoogle is widely known to track and store personal data, so it's not a good search engine for maintaining anonymity and privacy. A good, secure alternative is the DuckDuckGo search engine. Here's a short comparison by AffiliatePrograms:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*DuckDuckGo strongly believes in privacy. Currently, the company does not record any user information. As you probably know, this is a sticking point with many people when it comes to Google. Company founder Gabriel Weinberg had this to say:\n  “By default, DuckDuckGo does not collect or share personal information. That is our privacy policy in a nutshell.”\n  \n*It is often times described as a “hybrid” search engine thanks to results that are pulled from multiple sources including: Yahoo Search, Wolfram Alpha, Wikipedia, and its own crawler.\n  \n\nIncognito\nIncognito is Safari web extension focused on Security. Here's a description from their site:\n\nWhen browsing the web, you are continuously being tracked. Not only by the websites you are visiting, but also by major companies that embed their 'content' into other websites through ads and analytics. As a result, companies like Google, Twitter and Facebook have an almost complete picture of your online activity.\nIncognito protects your privacy by blocking Google Adsense and Google Analytics on non-Google pages. In addition, it allows you to optionally block Facebook and Twitter content on third-party websites as well as embedded YouTube movies outside of the YouTube website.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: If you're really privacy conscious you might consider using browsers like TOR or  SRWare Iron.\nTOR\nTOR is available either as an extension for firefox or as a stand alone browser. It basically reroutes your internet traffic through their computers which are running all over the world in order to hide your traffic.\nSRWare Iron\nSRWare Iron is based off Chromium (the code base for google chrome) and is like Chrome but without all the reporting back to google. You can download it for OSX here.\nLittle Snitch\nFinally, you may also want to consider Little Snitch. It's not free but it's good. It lets you know about any connections to your computer, incoming or outgoing, and lets you approve or deny the connections. Check out all the features here.\n\nA: If you use Safari, go to Safari's Preferences, and under the Privacy tab, check \"Ask websites not to track me\".  (This may not help much, but it can't hurt.)  Also, make sure the \"Block cookies\" setting is set to \"From third parties and advertisers\" (this is the default).\nIf you use Safari, install the AdBlock extension.  Under its set of options, click on the Filter Lists tab, and enable the EasyPrivacy list.\nUnder System Preferences, Security & Privacy, in the Privacy tab, under Diagnostics and Usage, make sure that \"Send diagnostic & usage data tto Apple\" is unchecked.  (This is the default.)\nCut out a little piece from a sticky note and cover over the camera with it.  This way you can uncover the webcam when you want to use it, while ensuring it is not used when you don't.  (Just don't get the sticky, gluey part of the sticky-note on the camera lens: you want that to be beside or above the lens.)  Yes, there's a little LED that comes on whenever the camera is active, but this way you don't have to worry about failing to notice the LED.\n", "Q: How can I copy a Google search URL from Safari? When I google for images of \"apple sauce\" (without the quotes), Safari's location bar just displays \"apple sauce\" (without the quotes) rather than the URL leading to Google searching for apple sauce images.\nI want to send someone the search URL. How can I get it from Safari?\n\nA: It's not a very elegant solution, but you can make a bookmarklet that will open a pop-up dialog with a copiable version of the URL.\nTo do this, bookmark any page you happen to have handy, then open the Bookmarks manager (Bookmarks > Show All Bookmarks), and edit the address of that bookmark to be javascript:alert(location.href);. Change the name to whatever you want.\nThen when you click it, you should get a popup that looks like this:\n\n\nA: You could also drag the favicon to a plain text view.\nOr assign a shortcut to a script like this:\ntell application \"Safari\" to URL of document 1\nset the clipboard to result\n\n\nA: It's simple. Copy apple sauce or whatever you see in the address bar and paste it wherever you want to. You might feel stupid doing this, but the result will be the full URL, not the search term you saw before copying. This works for me in Safari 10.0.\n\nA: Like suggested elsewhere, you can drag the search text from the URL bar into some plain text view. However, one can also directly drag it into a (rich text) email or chat message. Or into Google's search field which is conveniently close to Safari's location bar:\n\n(In previous versions, you could drag the magnifying glass icon; in 2016 versions just drag the search text like shown above.)\nAfter dragging into Google's search field, the additional search text is already selected and focussed, ready for Command+C: \n\n(In earlier versions, Safari's location bar will still have focus, and the URL in Google's search input will be gray, not blue. In those versions one could first hit Tab after searching to go into Google's search field, hit Delete to clear it, and then drag the icon. After that, the search field is ready for Command+C as well.)\nThe Share button to the right of the location bar can also share the URL, but probably only when messaging has been configured:\n\nAs an aside: the Google URLs include a lot of irrelevant things, specific to your browser, language, etc. Often, it's enough to use www.google.com#q=elvis+is+alive, or for image search www.google.com#tbm=isch&q=elvis+is+alive, but then one needs to change the spaces into plus-characters to ensure it's clickable. (And one also needs to percent-encode other special characters.) It would be nice if Google would provide some bare sharing link on its own site.\n\nA: I've created a Safari Extension: Get URL that highlights the current URL. It's less invasive than a bookmarklet and it's pre-selected, too.\n"]
