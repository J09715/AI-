["Q: VirutalBox headless VM + 3D acceleration I have installed virtualbox on my Ubuntu 13.10 (desktop) host, configured windows 7 guest, added extension pack and guest additions. My intention is to work on windows 7 remotely, so I have configured rdp on win7 and init.d on the host to start VM at boot in headless mode.\nHowever, I've noticed that VM could not start with 3D acceleration in headless mode IF virtualbox GUI is not started (error). What is interesting, that it starts from ssh console in headless mode with 3D acceleration if virtualbox (with gui) already started on host.\nWhat I want to know is if there is an option to start VM in headless mode with 3D acceleration WITHOUT virtualbox GUI started?\nHere is my error:\nError: failed to start machine. Error message: This VM was configured to use 3D acceleration. However, the 3D support of the host is not working properly and the VM cannot be started. To fix this problem, either fix the host 3D support (update the host graphics driver?) or disable 3D acceleration in the VM settings (VERR_NOT_AVAILABLE)\n\n\nA: Alas, no. The 3D acceleration option pipes calls through to 3D APIs of the host OS. When you start in headless mode, you're not using the graphics card, so no 3D support.\nYou won't get working 3D acceleration across RDP anyway, so you may as well disable it.\n", "Q: LibreOffice problem while openning a document My problem is that when I try to open one specific .odt document, I can't move the page or do anything except moving the mouse, which is useless. Also, the mouse, when I'm on the document, is freaking out switching between mouse and loader couple of times per second. It also becomes dark when I click on the document like if it's not responding.\n\nA: *\n\n*Upload your .odt document to Google Drive. \n\n*Right-click on the .odt document and select Open with -> Google Docs. Google Docs will convert the .odt file to its own document format for editing in Google Docs. \n\n*From the open document in Google Docs select File -> Download as -> OpenDocument Format (.odt). Google Docs will convert the document back to .odt format.\n\n*Open the .odt document that you downloaded from Google Docs in LibreOffice.\n\n\nGoogle Docs does a good job of converting documents to .odt format. The two document conversions in Google Docs may remove whatever there is in your original .odt document that was causing the problem.  \n\nAlternate method\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a copy of the corrupted document and rename the copied document's extension to .zip.  \n\n*Open the .zip file in Archive Manager and extract the content.xml file and the images from the Pictures folder. \n\n*Open the content.xml file in a text editor and recover as much of the text as you can. The content.xml file may also contain some of the original document's formatting information, which can also be recovered. If the content.xml contains any formatting information, the best way to view it is by opening content.xml in a web browser. \n\n*Sometimes you can also recover a corrupted .odt document by creating a blank .odt document, renaming its extension to .zip, and replacing the content.xml file of the blank .odt document with the content.xml file which was extracted from the corrupted document.\n\nA: Consider attempting recovery, rebooting and giving Libre Office one more chance. In one case I received harsh messages such as\n\nGeneral error. General input/output error\n\nor after a few rounds of failed auto-recovery attempts\n\nThe file 'filename.ods' is corrupt and therefore cannot be opened. LibreOffice can try to repair the file. The corruption could be the result of document manipulation or of structural document damage due to data transmission. We recommend that you do not trust the content of the repaired document. Execution of macros is disabled for this document. Should LibreOffice repair the file?\n\nwhich failed too. \nHowever, after rebooting, I found that that the corrupted document was only being regarded as locked for editing by another user. I could then make a copy of it and start off from scratch. This may well be circumstantial but consider giving LO one more chance.\nMy situation: LibreOffice 4.2.8.2; Ubuntu 14.04 LTS; Linux kernel 3.13.0-101-generic\n", "Q: Asus F5RL - wifi cannot connect I am a newbie on Ubuntu. here are the details\nOutput of lspci:\n00:00.0 Host bridge: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

I have a computer hooked up to a television that I am using to show different data. I would like to setup some different programs on different workspaces and have it rotate the workspaces automatically on a timed basis. How would I make this happen?\n\nA: Yes, and it is very easy. You just need a tool to press the keys you would press to change the workspace. One of such tools is xdotool. To install it:\n $ sudo apt-get install xdotool\n\nThen you just need to create a script like this one (here I assume you only have 2 workspaces, and you use Ctrl+Alt+Left/Right to change between them, but you can easily extend it to match your needs):\n!/bin/bash\n\nTIME=10 # shifts workspace after 10 sec.\n\nwhile [ 1 ]; do\n        sleep $TIME\n        xdotool key ctrl+alt+Right\n        sleep $TIME\n        xdotool key ctrl+alt+Left\ndone\n\nDon't forget to make it executable. If you create it in /usr/local/bin/workspace_switcher you can do that using\n $ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/workspace_switcher\n\nThen to start it you just have to press Alt+F2 and type workspace_switcher. To stop it, you can use killall workspace_switcher\n\nA: If you use 4 workspaces as default in Ubuntu (and I suspect that this is your case because you said rotate the workspaces), you can use the following script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#check if xdotool is installed\nif [ ! -n \"$(dpkg -s xdotool 2>/dev/null | grep 'Status: install ok installed')\" ]; then\n    echo -e \"The package 'xdotool' must to be installed before to run $(basename $0)\\nUse 'sudo apt-get install xdotool' command in terminal to install it.\"\n    exit\nfi\n\ndelay=5 #change as you wish\n\necho \"Press Ctrl+C to finish\"\n\n#start with workspace 0 (top left)\nxdotool key Ctrl+Alt+Left\nxdotool key Ctrl+Alt+Up\n\n#switch workspaces \nwhile : ; do\n    workspace_nr=0\n    until [ $workspace_nr = 4 ]; do\n        sleep $delay\n        case $workspace_nr in \n            0) xdotool key Ctrl+Alt+Right ;;\n            1) xdotool key Ctrl+Alt+Down ;;\n            2) xdotool key Ctrl+Alt+Left ;;\n            3) xdotool key Ctrl+Alt+Up ;;\n        esac\n        ((workspace_nr++))\n    done\ndone\n\n", "Q: How will people upgrade from 12.10 to later releases after 13.04 is EOL? Looking at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases\n13.04 will reach EOL in January 2014, while 12.10 will reach EOL in April 2014, therefore if a 12.10 user hasn't upgraded to 13.04 and subsequently to 13.10, there will be a 3 month period where a 12.10 user has a supported version of Ubuntu, but will be unable to upgrade.\nI asked this question a number of months ago and the suggestion was that the hope was that there would be an upgrade path from 12.10 to 14.04.\nCould somebody confirm whether this is still the case, or if not what the plans are for 12.10 users after 13.04 becomes EOL.\nEdited for clarification\nThe particular issue I was concerned about is that once 13.04 goes EOL, a 12.10 user would in theory lose the ability to upgrade once the 13.04 repo's are removed from the normal release repository.  Using the old releases method would be a way around the issue, however would make it more complicated for a less experienced user.\nAn alternative could be for the 13.04 repo's to be left available for the 3 month interim period so that a 12.10 version could still be upgraded to 13.04 and subsequently onto 13.10, however that doesn't seem an optimal solution in that users may consider that it meant that support for 13.04 was being continued.\nIf a direct upgrade from 12.10 to 14.04 was to made available, this would only be available once 14.04 was released and still leaves the issue of the 3 months between January and April 2014 were there may be some confusion.\nI suspect that its not going to affect a significant number of users, if somebody has upgraded from 12.04LTS to 12.10, in all probability, they'll have continued to upgrade to 13.04 and upwards because they'd made the choice to use current rather than LTS releases.\nIt would just be useful to have some clarification of the situation which people can be referred to in advance of 13.04 going EOL rather than hitting the cut off point and it being too late for users to make the decision and being left in limbo.\n\nA: Yes, just as upgrades from LTS to LTS are supported, upgrades from an intermediate release to the next LTS are supported.  \nHistorically this is only supported by manually changing your apt sources, since update-manager / do-release-upgrade require you to go step by step.  \nBut since 13.04 will go end of life before 12.10, we will need to skip over 13.04 in the upgrade path.  This will be implemented on the server (and with an SRU of the update-manager package to 12.10) to show the direct upgrade as an available option.\n", "Q: Xmodmap configuration I am trying to configure my keyboard to be able to type German characters without trying to learn another completely different keyboard layout.

I am starting to run out of disk space.

To use it just search Disk Usage Analyzer on dash (note that your icons may be different)\n\nAnd then select the disk you want to scan.

I uninstalled some things and it became little bit faster but still wasn't fast. I did a fresh installed of Ubuntu 13.04 and formatted 12.10 then installed Ubuntu 13.04 since 12.10 was getting slow.  \n\nA: You should have a look to which programs you installed are running in the background after login, and remove the ones you don't need. The programs would be still installed, but won't run until you need them. In a terminal, type:\ngnome-session-properties\n\nYou'll see something like this:\n\nJust don't disable any program before knowing is safe (search the names in the web, to see what their function is).\nMore items you can disable, but this time services. In a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install rcconf\n\nsudo rcconf\n\nAgain, these are not programs but services (daemons in GNU/Linux) so search the web to see which ones you can disable safely. For instance, I don't have a printer nor a modem so I always disable CUPS and modem-manager.\nAnother thing, install preload, an utility that loads libraries into memory according to how often you use them:\nsudo apt-get install preload\n\nAnd that's it, the program will run in the background, you don't need to configure it or anything.\nHope it helps!\n", "Q: After last update Unity no longer works An hour ago I installed latest updates and now Unity doesn't work anyomore, I only see desktop with icons.

If not, boot up an Ubuntu disk in LiveCD mode so you can work on your system.\nI can't think of any reason why you should not be able to install any version from 12.04 to 13.10 and then mount /home on it.\nJust make sure you do not tell Ubuntu about the /home partition during the install.

I'm not sure why someone would recommend older releases.

How can you say that the oldest version is more user friendly and the latest is less? Since all the version is equally new to you it really doesn't matter :) Yes those who are using Ubuntu for a long time can say what new features are added to new releases and all. \nMy experience say Ubuntu has become more user friendly after time to time. New features are added after every release. Just chose any version of Ubuntu and get ready to enjoy it. I assure it you'll enjoy and learn very easily.\n", "Q: Change /home and other relevant locations On my laptop, I have Windows 8 installed (on the internal solid state drive). I have another external hard drive with an installation of Ubuntu (with the EFI, /, /home, and swap partitions located on it). \nAll of my data is located on my internal drive, because I don't bring my hard drive around with me everywhere. Thus, my /home folder (and all sub folders) don't really contain anything.\nThis isn't very major, but more of an inconvenience. To access any of my data, I have to manually select my internal drive, and go through a plethora of other folders. For example, most of my important data is located at /media/D0BC1650BC163208/Users/my_user_name/skydrive. \nOf course, I can create symbolic links to get everywhere I want to, but it would be nice if I could simply change the /home folder (to my_user_name), my documents folder, etc. \nOf course, I know I would have to make sure the internal drive always gets mounted first.\nIs there a simple way to do this?\nI think this might be the easiest way, but I'm not sure.\n\nA: It is technically possible to do this using a bind mount in your fstab. However, having your home directory on a Windows NTFS filesystem, as you are suggesting, will cause problems as NTFS doesn't support Unix permissions. (For instance, sshd checks the permissions in your ~/.ssh directory and refuses to start if they are too liberal.)\nChanging the document folder locations, as in the answer you linked, is a better solution. Well-behaved apps will default to the chosen location on your internal drive in their Save As dialogs, etc.; they will still store their configuration in your Linux home directory, avoiding permissions problems.\n\nA: I had the same task and I ran these comands (in 12.04LTS) to solve it, using the explanation of the URL: \nhttp://efectoreinaroja.wordpress.com/2009/01/25/cambiar-ubicacion-de-directorio-home/ (In Spanish) \nand it WORK PERFECTLY!:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a partition for Windows Data in ntfs: named /sda6 but you must use your ntfs partition)\nAtention this partition must not contain Windows OS!\nand you must have installed \"ntfs-3g\".\n\n*I Mount this partition in /media (but you can use /mnt too): \nsudo mkdir /media/whome\nsudo mount /dev/sda6 /media/whome\n\n*Now I copied the directory /home to the directory /media/whome (using cpio instead cp)\ncd /home/\nsudo find . -depth -print0 | cpio --null --sparse -pvd /media/whome/\n\n*Now I dismount the partition:\nsudo umount /media/whome\n\n*Now to prevent keep the old home in backup folder:\nsudo mv /home /respaldo\n\n*Now mount the new partition /home:\nsudo mkdir /home\nsudo mount /dev/sda6 /home\n\n*Now the most important, to mount this partition every boot system:\nsudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bk   (security backup)\nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\nand add this line at the end:\n/dev/sda6 /home  ntfs  nodev,nosuid  0  2\nand thats all\nIf all work well, then you can remove the backup home data:\n    rm -r /respaldo\n", "Q: Installing pagekite/owncloud remote access on Ubuntu server 12.04 Does anyone know the commands to install pagekite on Ubuntu server 12.04.

Here are my parts... \nhttp://pcpartpicker.com/user/jdabi13/saved/2AbA\nGigabyte, (the brand of my motherboard) says to find linux drivers from the chipset manufacturer, I cannot find the drivers on Intel's site (I have a Z77 chipset from Intel). Do I need to find drivers at all or do they come in the ubuntu kernel when I install it? I also have a Gigabyte brand graphics card made by NVIDIA, where do i find those drivers? Thanks if you can help\n\nA: Phoronix, a trusted source, indicated that the Z77 works without trouble in Linux.

I have a bluetooth mouse (Adesso iMouse S100).  Initially, the mouse works fine, but after a few minutes, it starts to lag a lot and it eventually disconnects.  And then, it takes forever to reconnect.\nThe mouse works fine on my win-7 issue (dual boot win-7/ubuntu).  So I know it's not an hardware issue\nAnyone has an idea?\n\nA: Sounds like an USB problem to me. Here is what you might try : A) Install a different kernel or B) Build you own kernel.\n.\nA) Install a different kernel, not build FOR Ubuntu. Cannonical may have done some mistakes on their kernels. Current Ubuntu 13.10's kernel is 3.11 but you can download recent version (today it's 13.12 the latest stable version) on http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/ . \nChoose the 2 packages for your architecture (64 bits = amd64, 32 bits = i386) and install them in this order : linux-image-XXX first, then linux-header-XXX second. \nYou can install the .deb packages with gdebi (sudo apt-get install gdebi) with visual interface by double-click on the .deb file, or you can use these commandline : \ncd path/to/file \n\n(replace path/to/file by the directory containing the .deb packages, default is ~/Downloads)\nsudo dpkg -i package_to_install\n\n(replace package_to_install by the name of the .deb file you want to install, here it should be something like linux-image-XXX-amd64.deb)\n.\nB) Build you own kernel with a modified hid.h value (usb2.0 driver), to allow the USB 2.0 to be more permissive. I used to do that until kernel 3.11 was out for my Perixx gaming mouse (wired mouse). This custom kernel is based on your system's current kernel, so it's guaranteed to be fully compatible with your Ubuntu. The steps are just below this paragraph.\nSee What is HID_MAX_USAGES for knowing a little more about HID.H and why recompiling kernel can be a solution for your bluetooth mouse. \n\nBuilding a new kernel with modifier hid.h value :\n1) Open a terminal (ctrl-alt-T)\n2) Launch the command :\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install fakeroot kernel-wedge build-essential makedumpfile kernel-package libncurses5 libncurses5-dev\nIt installs the requiered packages for the kernel building. You can apt-get remove <packages> afterwards to uninstall them if you wish. \n3) Enter the following commands to create a directory for the kernel sources : \n\n\n*\n\n*mkdir ~/source\n\n*cd ~/source\n\n*apt-get source linux-image-$(uname -r)\n4) Type :\n\n\n*\n\n*cd linux\nPress Tab to auto-fill the name, then press Enter.\n5) Launch :\n\n\n*\n\n*gedit include/linux/hid.h\nFind (Ctrl + F) the line #define HID_MAX_USAGES and change it's value to '64000'.\n6) Launch :\ncp -vi /boot/config-`uname -r` .config\n\nTo copy the configuration file of your current system.\n7) (Optionnal) To speed up the building process, you can adjust the concurrency level. Launch :\n\n\n*\n\n*export CONCURRENCY_LEVEL=#\nReplace # by the number of your CPU's cores + 1 (Dual-core will be \"3\", Quad-core \"5\", …)\n8) Launch :\n\n\n*\n\n*make-kpkg clean\nTo prepare the directory needed by the building process.\n9) Launch :\n\n\n*\n\n*fakeroot make-kpkg --initrd --append-to-version=-sk kernel-image kernel-headers\nThis will start the kernel building process. It can take a while (between 1h and 8h following your hardware). If the process is interrupted for some reason, you should launch the command rm ~/source and start over from step 3. The kernel binaries .deb will be placed in ~/source. \n\nTo install the new kernel :\n1) Open nautilus (file explorer) and go to /lib/modules.\n2) Open a Terminal and launch :\n\n\n*\n\n*cd ~/source\n3) Type the following commands and press **Tab to auto-fill the version of kernel, named here (KERNEL_VERSION) :**\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo dpkg -i linux-image-    \n\n*sudo dpkg -i linux-headers-\nBoth commands (once filled by Tab) must end by .deb\n4) Launch : \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo update-initramfs -c -k KERNEL_NAME\nYou have to replace KERNEL_NAME by the name used by the directory containing the modifier kernel (should end with \"-sk\" in nautilus).\n5) Launch :\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo update-grub\n(and also sudo update-burg if you use BURG).\n6) Restart the computer.\nYou now run a custom kernel ! Congrats' \n\nIf that doesn't work, the problem is NOT caused by HID (usb2.0 driver) and I have no idea how to help you :)\n\nA: This also looks like a \"Pooling\" problem to me..\nI found a similar problem, but only during gaming in ubuntu 12.04 on steam..!!\nMight be associated...might be not.\nIf you feel the lagging might be due to pooling interval you can decrease it..by the following, (basically its similar to what has already been suggested, use a new kernel)\nTry the following resource ..\nhttp://wiki.quakeworld.nu/Howto_customise_mouse_polling_rate\n", "Q: How backwards compatible will the Ubuntu SDK be? First let me say, by SDK I'm not actually referring to QT Creator, but Ubuntu's QML libraries, I'm actually using Geany for all my programming.\nWhen Ubuntu very first released the Ubuntu SDK I switched an app I was working on to QML, I'm using QML for the GUI and C for all the inner workings. After upgrading to 13.10 my app pretty much broke, it wasn't difficult for me to figure out what had changed with the Ubuntu SDK and make the appropriate changes, but now I am concerned about the SDK in general, did they only make such dramatic changes because their still working it out, or is every version of Ubuntu that comes out going to break compatibility with apps? In other words, once they get the Ubuntu SDK officially released is it going to be the same regardless what Ubuntu version people have?\nAnd is there any word on when the final version of the Ubuntu SDK will be released?\n\nA: The SDK was pretty fluid, since this was the initial development and we only reached our first \"stable\" state with the release of Ubuntu 13.10.  There should not be any breakage in the API from here on out without first going to a deprecation period.  If this is a concern to enough people, we can run a session at the upcoming UDS to discuss how to handle it.\n", "Q: Qt Creator and UbuntuSDK I am installing Ubuntu SDK with Qt Creator by following this link\nbut when I launch Qt Creator there is no option for Ubuntu's projects (Projects > Ubuntu > Simple Touch UI),only default console projects.\nHow can I add these solutions in Qt Creator?\nP.S.: Sorry, for my English\n\nA: That same problem has been bugging me for a while.

Do I have any other options for installation without having to pay for a floppy drive or a replacement CD drive?\nThe wiki pages mentions something about installation from within Windows.

This implies that shim is installed in /efi/Microsoft/Boot, presumably as bootmgfw.efi, and is being launched; however, your Boot Repair output shows no evidence of grubx64.efi being present there, as it must be. (Shim is hard-coded to launch grubx64.efi from the same directory in which it resides.)\nThis suggests an easy solution: Copy grubx64.efi from /efi/ubuntu to /efi/Microsoft/boot.

This is driving me up the wall, I absolutely despise the idea that files are being thrown around on the network and that other people's s*** is showing up on my computer, and that they may be able to see my files as well.\nThis is a very, very serious problem as far as I am concerned and I want to know how I can ensure that I am sharing nothing with the network in the way of files on my computer and that no one else's files are showing up on my computer.\n\nA: Rhythmbox has the ability to pick up files from several locations - both locally and \"sniffing\" out network locations.\nIf you look in your Rhythmbox plugins you have a plugin called DAAP - a protocol to look for a DAAP server.  It is likely your college friends are using such a server to distribute music.\n - untick the option shown to not use DAAP.\nIf you also look further down the list you have the MediaServer2 D-Bus Interface and the MRPIS D-Bus Interface.  Again, uncheck those if you are not using those interfaces to find music.\nUsing dconf-editor available if you install the dconf-tools package, you also have some likely candidate keys you can uncheck as well to further restrict sharing:\n - navigate org -> gnome -> rhythmbox -> sharing in the tree view and uncheck both enable-browsing and enable-sharing\n", "Q: apt-get not recognizing downloaded archives I installed Ubuntu Gnome 13.10. I previously had Ubuntu Gnome 13.04 and had all the archives in the /var/cache/apt/archives/ stored to a removable disk. After installing 13.10 I copied all my archives to the above mentioned path. When I run apt-get install it tries to fetch the archives\n\nalthough I have the archives.\n\nAlso if instead of apt-get install if I try to install individual .deb files using dpkg -i everything runs fine. These are the permissions of files:\n\nHow do I fix this. Previously copying archives like this worked fine and downloading duplicates the files.\n\nA: Ubuntu 13.04 and Ubuntu 13.10 have different versions of the Gimp and other packages. The versions the system knows about, as listed in its APT sources, are not the same ones you have in /var/cache/apt/archives. So it tries downloading the ones it needs.\nUsing apt-cache policy (e.g., \"apt-cache policy gimp\") can often shed light on this sort of issue. Or go to http://packages.ubuntu.com/ and enter a package name, to see which package versions are in which versions of the OS.\n", "Q: error in installation of xournal root@bt:~# sudo apt-get install xournal\n\nReading package lists...

The \"Startmedienersteller\" (sorry, German UI, may be start media creator in English) first failed several times but finally finished normally. Even then the USB stick does not boot on the MacBook Air (which the 13.04 version created on Windows machine did), but this is another story. \nWhen I now look into \"Sytemüberwachung\" in the tab \"file systems\" I now find a bunch of new, 100% full, filesystems\n/dev/loop0                    881M    881M     0  100% /tmp/tmp0hoyt9\n/dev/loop1                    881M    881M     0  100% /tmp/tmpl2btns\n/dev/loop2                    881M    881M     0  100% /tmp/tmpqk7r4b\n/dev/loop3                    881M    881M     0  100% /tmp/tmpn_38uh\n/dev/loop4                    881M    881M     0  100% /tmp/tmpre2ggl\n/dev/loop5                    881M    881M     0  100% /tmp/tmpdm2dh8\n\nmount tells me for each of these file systems\n/home/bier/Downloads/ubuntu-13.10-desktop-amd64+mac.iso on /tmp/tmpdm2dh8 type iso9660 (ro)\n\nso I guess the filesystems will not really use up any recognizable disk space. Nevertheless they are very disturbing in the \"Systemüberwachung\" so I would like to get rid of them. But how to do this?\n\nA: The \"Startup disk creator\" leaves with two devices being mounted: 1. the newly created stick, 2. the image (in my case ubuntu-13.10-desktop-amd64+mac.iso) from which the stick was created. The stick can be seen from the file manager and can be \"ejected\" from there. This was not the case with the image file. In the \"Disks\" application, however, the mountpoint is visible and can be unmounted.\n", "Q: Rotate Touch Input with touchscreen and/or touchpad So I just bought an Asus x202e, and have installed Xubuntu 13.04 on it. All working great.\nHowever, I want to be able to rotate the screen from landscape to portrait, and still use the touch. When I currently rotate it, the touch doesn't correspond with it.\nHow do I fix it?\n\nA: In the end, I found out how to do it, although it's a little tricky. Still, if a non-mega-Geek like me can do it, I'm sure most of you can too! :)\nFirstly, Go to Terminal, and type this to find the name of your touchscreen, and if you have one, your touchpad (say, if you have a laptop with a touchscreen):\nxinput -list\n\nThe names should be pretty obvious for each.\nNow, make two \"shell scripts\": these are little text documents that contain several commands, which are joined up in the document to be done together (effectively creating a little program). Make them using gedit, naming them \"portrait.sh\" and \"landscape.sh\" respectively. Save them in a new folder: /home/your username/Scripts/\nFor PORTRAIT, type this:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n#portrait (left)\n\nxrandr -o left\nxinput set-prop \"Your Touchscreen's Name\" --type=float \"Coordinate Transformation Matrix\" 0 -1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1\nxinput set-prop \"Your Touchpad's name, if applicable\" --type=float \"Coordinate Transformation Matrix\" 0 -1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1\n\nNext, for LANDSCAPE:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n#landscape (normal)\n\nxrandr -o normal\nxinput set-prop \"Your Touchscreen's Name\" --type=float \"Coordinate Transformation Matrix\" 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nxinput set-prop \"Your Touchpad's name, if applicable\" --type=float \"Coordinate Transformation Matrix\" 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nIf you don't have a touchpad, you can leave out that line of code for each shell script.\nAfterwards, I also made launchers to automatically run each shell script when I tapped on them (this is possible in Xubuntu, Ubuntu MATE, and many other Ubuntu flavours). To do so, go to your panel, right-click, click on \"add to panel\" (or equivalent, for all these subsequent commands, too), create a custom application launcher. For portrait's launcher, put in this command:\nsh /home/username/Scripts/portrait\n\nFor landscape's launcher, put in this command:\nsh /home/username/Scripts/landscape\n\nI also made a \"super+\" keyboard shortcut for each of them. Find your \"keyboard shortcuts\" settings program (under Settings in many flavours, or just search for it). Effectively, do the same thing as you did with the panel launchers: Add a new keyboard shortcut, Name it Portrait and give it the command, \"sh /home/username/Scripts/portrait\", and do the equivalent for Landscape. Then give each of them a keyboard shortcut (say Super+P and Super+L respectively... although be aware Super+P is sometimes the standard keyboard shortcut for your Display Settings).\nI STRONGLY recommend you make a keyboard shortcut for LANDSCAPE - that way, if your touch stops working, you can at least get out of Portrait, and back to Landscape successfully (VERY USEFUL).\nFor more information, go here. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1972447\n(This link - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/InputCoordinateTransformation - will also help you understand a little of the theory behind it...)\n\nA: I also wrote a little utility to handle this. Mine is a suite of lowly shell scripts, but they're interfaced and documented fairly well, so I'll add them to the list of solutions here.\nYou can find the source code here (docs here), and if you're on a Debian derivative, you can install them by adding my package repo here and running sudo apt update && sudo apt install ks-rotate-display.\n\nA: I've built a little GUI that can do that. Completely based on those open source scripts. Have a look at Screen Orientation Manager here.\n", "Q: How do I setup my wifi & pppoe and use them asus x550 I have an laptop asus x550 and want to connect to WiFi or pppoe but don't know anything about both of them and fully beginner and need help to step by step setup them.\nI use ubuntu 13 last version\nthanks \n\nA: This is a bug(Mark yourself affected) in the wifi driver, there are some workarounds. The one that worked for me:\necho \"options asus_nb_wmi wapf=1\" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/asus_nb_wmi.conf\n\nThis creates a file asus_nb_wmi.conf in /etc/modprobe.d that will load asus_nb_wmi, with the parameter wapf=1 that will be activated at next reboot. \nNote: Fn-F2 will not work\n\nThe following is excerpt from: [SOLVED] Fix : Asus WiFi Disabled (Hard-blocked), Fn+F2 won't work, just in case the aforementioned workaround does not work for you. \n\nUntil this issue is fixed with newer updates, you may use \"xbindkeys\"\n  tool to set a hotkey (can be a single key or a key-combination) of\n  your choice to toggle the WiFi enabled/disabled.\nThis is how -\nA. Create a Script to do it smartly :\n1) First, we create a script (for ease of use, and so that we can\n  toggle it on/off using the same hotkey) - Code:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n# Script to toggle the wireless blocked/unblocked\n\n# index no. of phy interface IFACE=`rfkill list all | grep phy | cut -c 1`\n\n# WiFi block state 0=active, 1=blocked BLOCKED=`rfkill list all | grep -iA1 phy | grep -ic soft.*yes`\n\nif [ $BLOCKED -eq 1 ]; then     rfkill unblock $IFACE\n\nelse    rfkill block $IFACE fi\n\n\nCopy-paste the contents of the above box in a text file and save this\n  file in your Home directory with the name - \"wifitoggle.sh\". Make sure\n  the first line is (without double quotes) \"#!/bin/bash\" and last one\n  is \"fi\".\n2) Make the script executable by running the following command in a\n  terminal - Code:\n\nchmod +x wifitoggle.sh\n\n\n3) Run the following command to Create a symlink to this script in\n  /bin directory - Code:\n\nsudo ln -s $HOME/wifitoggle.sh /bin\n\n\nNow proceed to binding it with a hotkey as follows -\nB. Bind the Script with a HotKey of your choice :\n1) Install xbindkeys-config (a GUI frontend to xbindkeys - the program\n  that captures and binds hotkeys with commands) - Code:\n\nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys-config\n\n\n2) Create a default config file for it (else it would crash on key\n  capture step) - Code:\n\nxbindkeys --defaults > ~/.xbindkeysrc\n\n\n3) Run the program from terminal or \"Alt+F2\" (because it does not\n  create a launcher in Unity dash) - Code:\n\nxbindkeys-config\n\n\nlet the terminal running in the background.. In the GUI box that\n  opens, 3 example shortcuts are already present. You may leave them.\n4) Click on \"New\" button at the bottom of the GUI.\n5) In the right hand pane of the GUI, fill in a suitable name in the\n  \"Name\" field, e.g. \"Toggle Wifi\"\n6) Click on \"Get Key\" button. This will open a tiny blank box doing\n  nothing but waiting for your input.\n7) Press the desired key (or key combination) that you want for\n  toggling Wifi on/off. For example, \"F3\" key (as it remains mostly\n  unused). The tiny box will disappear and the key will be recorded.\n8) In the \"Action\" field, type this - Code:\n\n/bin/bash /bin/wifitoggle.sh\n\n\n9) Click on \"Apply\" button and test the hotkey to see if it works as\n  expected.\n10) Click on \"Save & Apply & Exit\" to save the new hotkey to the\n  default file and exit.\nFrom now on, as soon as you will press this key or the\n  key-combination, the wifi will change its state from On to Off, or Off\n  to On.\nThe Fn key doesn't seem to be noticed by any key capture program I\n  could find (probably that's why it is considered \"Hardware Switch\"),\n  so it's not possible to use it yet.\nOnce more, I'd request anyone who needs this workaround to submit a\n  bug report against the problem, or add themselves to the \"Affects Me\"\n  list, and point to this thread as a possible workaround.\nThe stronger it gets reported, the sooner we'll get it fixed, thus not\n  requiring such crude workarounds.\n\n\nThansk to fossfreedom, and seth for the research!\nWorkaround(s)\n\n\n*\n\n*[SOLVED] Fix : Asus WiFi Disabled (Hard-blocked), Fn+F2 won't work\nBug\n\n\n*\n\n*Bug #971809 “168c:0032 Wifi connection unstable -- Atheros AR948...” : Bugs : “linux” package : Ubuntu\n\nA: If you can see a wifi symbol on the op panel on your desktop then click it and select the coonection you want to connect.

See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox for information about how to do it. But I recommend just installing Ubuntu as a second operating system, so you'll have a dual-boot system. That's more useful and possibly easier.\n\nA: yes,you can use ubuntu without partitioning the drives through virtualbox or vmware softwares.\n\nA: Best of all for complete and satisfying experience, download ubuntu iso file and ubuntu wubi installer to a same folder. Then execute wubi.exe.\nIt will install Ubuntu as an application in your Windows 7 and whenever you want to uninstall ubuntu, you can do it the same way you would uninstall any application from windows. Or you would again run the same wubi.exe and this time it will uninstall Ubuntu.\nYou can install Ubuntu using VirtualBox as mentioned in above answers but it will be hard on your resources( hardware).\nFor more info try the below link...\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wubi\n\nA: Easiest way to get started. \n\n\n*\n\n*Download VirtualPlayer from here and install it. \n\n*Download Ubuntu from here\n\n*Start Up Virtual Player. Click create new virtual machine. Then click the Ubuntu ISO that you downloaded. Follow the steps, give it maybe 10GB of space, it will only take up as much space as it's currently using even if you allow it to have 10GB, so it will probably be 5GB. \n\n*After following these steps you can start virtual player and it will be like running Ubuntu as an application in Windows.\n\nIn the future if you want to dual boot Windows and Ubuntu, which is nicer since there is probably less lag, you get better performance download and use Wubi. Note this doesn't need a flash drive or anything to work, just download wubi and Ubuntu and follow the steps. \nBonus:\n\nIf you feel like your an advanced computer user the best app around to make a bootable flash drive for Linux is Unetbootin (search Google for it). This will allow you to dual boot as Wubi but has some slight advantages that you may not notice. Wubi still connects the Linux install partially to your windows install.\n\n", "Q: Unsupported software?

One screen defaults to 60hz, the other to 75. I am able to change the refresh rates in the nvidia-settings and change them both from \"auto\" to 60hz (both monitors support this rate), however, upon restart they have reset back to their default setting of \"auto\"(auto being one at 60hz and the other at 75hz).\nPreviously, I had used a startup script that made ccsm force a 60hz rate(compiz also would reset to default upon restart) and this had fixed the issue.\nHowever, upon upgrading to 13.10 the refresh rate in CCSM is blank for me and shows nothing. If I enter anything into it, it will reset itself back to black upon hitting the back button.\nSo, essentially, at the moment, I cannot enter anything into ccsm for a refresh rate, and any settings I set in nvidia-settings don't stick at startup.\nXrandr does show that the 60hz is available for the second monitor, but I am unable to find a way to ensure that it starts with that rate.\nAnd, unless I'm reading it incorrectly, my xorg.conf does show a 60hz rate:\n# nvidia-settings: X configuration file generated by nvidia-settings\n# nvidia-settings:  version 331.17  (buildd@rhenium)  Sun Oct 27 00:28:28 UTC   2013\n\n\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"Layout0\"\n    Screen      0  \"Screen0\" 0 0\n    InputDevice    \"Keyboard0\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\n    InputDevice    \"Mouse0\" \"CorePointer\"\n    Option         \"Xinerama\" \"0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Files\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n\n    # generated from default\n    Identifier     \"Mouse0\"\n    Driver         \"mouse\"\n    Option         \"Protocol\" \"auto\"\n    Option         \"Device\" \"/dev/psaux\"\n    Option         \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"no\"\n    Option         \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n\n# generated from default\n    Identifier     \"Keyboard0\"\n    Driver         \"kbd\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier         \"Mouse Remap\"\n    MatchDevicePath    \"/dev/input/event*\"\n    Option         \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n\n    # HorizSync source: edid, VertRefresh source: edid\n    Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"AOC LM720BGE\"\n    HorizSync       30.0 - 83.0\n    VertRefresh     55.0 - 75.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device0\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"GeForce GTX 560 Ti\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen0\"\n    Device         \"Device0\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"Stereo\" \"0\"\n    Option         \"nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder\" \"DFP-0\"\n    Option         \"metamodes\" \"DVI-I-1: 1280x1024_60 +1920+56, DVI-I-2:  1920x1080_60 +0+0\"\n    Option         \"SLI\" \"Off\"\n    Option         \"MultiGPU\" \"Off\"\n    Option         \"BaseMosaic\" \"off\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n    Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nAnyhow, any advice or suggestions anybody has would be greatly appreciated.

So no video acceleration, no window decorations, and lots of other issues.\nI do know it's an obsolete unsupported card (see Which version of Ubuntu will work out of the box on Intel 82845G Board?) but I think I read somewhere that there had been progress as of late with the latest intel drivers.\nMy question is: is there anything I can currently do to make this card work or should I just give up on the idea and turn to lighter DE like LXDE or XFCE?\nThanks\n\nA: I realize that this thread is pretty much dead, but I found some information that may help any future visitors who come here as I did in a desperate search for answers. I have a circa-2004 Dell Dimension 2400 I really wanted to install Linux on for a client, and was about to give up - esp. after reading numerous posts like this - when I decided to give Lubuntu 14.04 a try.

I installed this patch which made it possible to switch layouts again.\nThe problem I'm facing now is that it is still impossible to switch keyboard layout when I lock (Ctrl+Alt+L) system and press Alt+Shift.

It seems the DNS servers which I get by DHCP (LAN) are not used.\nI could temporary solve the problem by adding nameserver 8.8.8.8 to /etc/resolv.conf. But then the intranet hosts still can not be resolved.\nWhen clicking on the Connection Information menu item on the network indicator, the Primary DNS and the Secondary DNS are set correctly. But my computer seams not to use them.\nSo my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What should I put into resolv.conf, if anything?\n\n*How to find out, which name servers my computer is querying?\n\n*Where to look next, to find out, why name servers received by DHCP are not used?\n\n\nA: First you need to know a bit about how name resolving works in Ubuntu since Ubuntu 12.04.\nStéphane Graber blogged some information about it last year here. The most important thing to know is that both Ubuntu Server and Ubuntu Desktop use resolvconf to manage the resolv.conf file. That means that you should no longer edit /etc/resolv.conf directly; instead you should configure your network interface configuration utility to provide the right information to resolvconf. For Ubuntu Server the network interface configuration utility is ifup and it is configured by the file /etc/network/interfaces. For Ubuntu Desktop the network interface configuration utility is NetworkManager. This is what you are using.\nNetworkManager is configured by means of Network indicator > Edit Connections. However, for network interfaces configured by DHCP it normally isn't necessary to change any settings manually. Normally what happens is that the (remote) DHCP server provides to NetworkManager both an IP address for the local interface and the address of a (remote) DNS nameserver to use. NetworkManager starts an instance of a forwarding nameserver that listens locally at 127.0.1.1. This address, 127.0.1.1, is sent to resolvconf which puts nameserver 127.0.1.1 in /etc/resolv.conf. NetworkManager also gives the (remote) IP address of the DHCP-provided DNS nameserver to the forwarding nameserver. Thus a program running on the local system asks the resolver to translate a host name into an IP address; the resolver queries the local forwarding nameserver at 127.0.1.1; the forwarding nameserver queries the remote nameserver(s) it has been told about, receives an answer and sends it back up the chain.\nNetworkManager communicates with the forwarding nameserver process over D-Bus. You can see what NetworkManager told the forwarding nameserver by running the command \nnmcli dev list iface eth0 | grep IP4.DNS\n\nUpdate arising from the comments:\nNote that resolvconf actually writes the file /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf to which /etc/resolv.conf is supposed to be a symbolic link. If /etc/resolv.conf is not a symbolic link then you need to recreate it. To do so you can run \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf\n\nor \nsudo ln -sf /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf        \n\n\nA: It's actually really easy.\njust open your interfaces conf file\n --> sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces\nand under your interface (probably eth0) you will see all the usual config.\naddress 192.168.22.71\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.22.1\n\nAfter gateway just add 'dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.8.9' or whatever nameserver you're going to use.\nSo your config should be:\naddress 192.168.22.71\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.22.1\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.8.9\n\nthen just do a 'sudo service networking restart' and you're good to go!\n\nA: I made the change suggested on the link below (disabling dnsmasq). Now everything works great!\nhttp://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-disable-dnsmasq-in-ubuntu-12-04precise.html\nOpen /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf file.\nsudo gedit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\nComment out line as:\n#dnsmasq deactivated\n#dns=dnsmasq\n\n\nA: EDIT 2: Previous post was rightfully deleted by the moderation, I'm posting what I have found to be a solution. Sorry for that.\nEDIT: I just found the answer and it's in this very page - sorry for my miopy. I posted my findings below, expanding the correct answer by Richard Lindstedt found in this page. I left my early rumbling for a bit of context. Please upvote Richard's answer, he deserves it.\n\nIt's actually really easy.\njust open your interfaces conf file --> sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces\n\nThat sure did not help the OP and doesn't help me now. We don't want static addresses, we want to use the ones the DHCP server sends us. NetworkManager seems to recognise them, but Ubuntu bluntly ignores them:\n# nmcli dev list iface wlan0 | grep IP4.DNS\nIP4.DNS[1]:          10.*.*.*\nIP4.DNS[2]:          10.*.*.*\nIP4.DNS[3]:          8.8.8.8\n\nBut...\n# dig microsoft.com\n; <<>> DiG 9.9.5-4.3-Ubuntu <<>> microsoft.com\n;; global options: cmd\n;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached\n\nAnd my /etc/network/interfaces is:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nwhich is a bit odd, I would expect all interfaces being declared here (or am I missing something?).\nSo, in short:\n\n*\n\n*I did not mess with any file to start with\n\n*I have already run dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf\n\n*The right symlink is in place\n\n*NetworkManager retrieves the correct DNS servers from DHCP\n\n*Ubuntu DOES NOT use such addresses\n\n*The workaround is to put fixed 8.8.8.8 on /etc/network/interfaces WHICH I DON'T WANT\n\n*I want to use the DHCP-provided DNS servers in any and all situations.\n\nNot opening another thread because it's the exact problem except I'm on 14.10 now (but this have been nagging me since de upgrade from 12.10 to 13.04).\nSOLUTION\nThat last phrase got me on the right track, and only then I noticed Richard's answer.\nThe problem seems to be related to the conflicting dnsmasq and resolvconf packages. Until 12.10, dnsmasq was used. From 13.04 onwards, Ubuntu seemed to switch to a dnsmasq/resolvconf hybrid, where you have installed the packages dnsmasq-base and resolvconf, but not dnsmasq itself.\nI can't say if it's a bug in the upgrade scripts for 13.04 or something else, because when upgrading (as in fresh installs) resolvconf is installed, dnsmasq-base is upgraded and dnsmasq is (correctly) uninstalled.\nThe catch is, the upgrade script fails to comment out the dns=dnsmasq line in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf. So, even though the dnsmasq daemon is not present anymore on the system, /etc/resolv.conf still expects it to be.\n\nA: I'm using Pop!OS, but I think my solution could be applicable to Ubuntu users as well.\nFor me 2 issues were involved.\nFirst, systemd-resolved was not configured to use mdns.\nSo this should be enabled by editing /etc/systemd/resolved.conf\nand enabling option\nMulticastDNS=yes\nafter that change systemd-resolved must be restarted.\nsystemctl restart systemd-resolved.service\n\nThen check if configuration was updated by\nsystemd-resolve --status\nIt should have\nGlobal\n       LLMNR setting: no\nMulticastDNS setting: yes\n\nbut if you check the particular interface, it will have multicast disabled.\n      Current Scopes: none\nDefaultRoute setting: no\n       LLMNR setting: yes\nMulticastDNS setting: no\n  DNSOverTLS setting: no\n      DNSSEC setting: no\n\nThe problem is that enabling MulticastDNS cannot be done from (at least mine) UI network interface configurator, so you have to do nmcli command line config.\nnmcli connection edit enp4s0\n\nyou are interested in property connection.mdns\nyou could get more info on that by\ndescribe connection.mdns   \n\nso\nset connection.mdns reslove (or what ever you prefer)\nthen\nsave persistent quit \nnow mdns should be operational\n\nA: Run:\nsudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches\n\n\nA: This issue can be related to systemd-resolve does not forward DNS requests to stated DNS server\nNewer systemd-resolved refuses to resolve simple names via DNS, i.e. myhost and will only resolve myhost.somedomain.com via DNS.\nThis change is by design. Bypass/remove systemd-resolved if you use simple hostnames. \nCreate a working /etc/resolv.conf and chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf so that systemd tools don't mess with it, optionally remove systemd-resolved with apt.\nThe reason is that systemd-resolved presumes your intranet's DNS server is on the Internet, and provides no mechanism to indicate that it is not.\n", "Q: How do I remap my Ubuntu keyboard shortcuts to match OSX? I'm using Ubuntu in VirtualBox on Mac. As I switch frequently, I would like to use the same shortcuts. Please, does anyone know how to have the same shortcuts on Ubuntu, as they are on Mac?\nSpecifically, I would like to Copy, Paste, Select All, ... work with Cmd+C, Cmd+V, Cmd+A, ... (even in terminal - no Ctrl+Shift, just Ctrl).\nI tried to change Keyboard Layout to Apple Laptop, but that didn't help.\n\nA: This is an updated answer for anyone struggling with this issue with more recent versions of Ubuntu. \nI have just installed Ubuntu 16.04.1 via VirtualBox and was unable to get the keyboard settings to match my MacBook. \nHere's what I did to fix it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to System Settings.\n\n*Select Text Entry (i.e. not Keyboard).\n\n*Underneath the list with the heading Input sources to use: there is a plus and a minus sign - click on the plus sign.\n\n*In the text box under Choose an input source type in the keyboard layout that you require (in my case I choose English (UK, macintosh).\n\n*Use the up arrow to make it your default keyboard layout on Ubuntu.\n\n*Remove the other keyboard layouts. It wasn't until I removed the other layouts that the changes took effect.\n\n\nA: I'm on Ubuntu 16.04, VirtualBox 5.1.22 and none of these answers worked for me - including David Brower's unfortunately.\nHere's what did to get my left OSX Command key working (persistently!):\n\n\n*\n\n*First you need to ensure VirtualBox isn't using Left ⌘ as the Host key\n\n\n*\n\n*In the top menu bar of your VM window select Input > Keyboard > Keyboard Settings..\n\n*In the list of settings, find Host Key Combination, and change shortcut to something other than Left  ⌘  (I just used Right ⌘ as I never use it).\n\n\n*Now that you can definitely use the Left ⌘ in within the VM environment, remap the keys with XKB:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open and (carefully) edit: /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc\n\n*I simply swapped <LCTL> and <LWIN> around, so it looks like this:\n\n*key <LCTL> {    [ Super_L       ]   };\n\n*key <LWIN> {    [ Control_L     ]   };\n\n\n*Now clear the old mappings from xkb cache:\n\n\n*\n\n*rm -rf /var/lib/xkb/*\n\n\n*Restart ubuntu for changes to take effect.\n\n\nWord of warning: I'd avoid making more than one change at a time via xkb unless you really know what you're doing, a couple of keys mapped incorrectly at the same time could be a real headache!\nFull Credit to Radu Cotescu for the xkb remapping instructions - they were for ubuntu 14.04, however they work fine for ubuntu 16.04.\n\nA: There's no need to use xbindkeys to achieve OSX-like keyboard mapping on Ubuntu. This is a built-in option:\n\n*\n\n*Go into your Ubuntu Settings\n\n*Navigate to Keyboard → Keyboard Layout Settings\n\n*add English (Macintosh)\n\nA: couldn't you add custom shortcuts?? If that wasn't possible or didn't work you might want to change the keybindings of your vmbox.\nYou'll need to do the following:\nInstall xbindkeys\nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys\n\nXbindkeys is a very versatile program that lets you remap keys very easily. It uses a config file, my default located in your home directory, to change key bindings into certain commands.\nTo create a default config file you use the command:\nxbindkeys --defaults\n\nWhich prints the default config file. So if you want to create the file containing the default values you would use:\nxbindkeys --defaults > $HOME/.xbindkeysrc\n\nWhich prints the default values into a hidden file named .xbindkeysrc located in home.\nNow to actually change the bindings of keys we first need to know what the name or keysym of those keys is. xbindkeys allows us to use the -k handle to find the name of a key or key combination. Run:\nxbindkeys -k\n\nNow press ctrl (of cmd) and check the output\nTry pressing ctrl + c (after disabling that shortcut in the terminal using the second part of this explination)\nIt will tell you the name of the key/key combination.\nNow we need to tell linux to call upon cmd when ctrl is pressed.\nfor this we will need an extra piece of software as xbindkeys does not support this on it's own. I know of two programs which we can use, xdotool and xte. I prefer xte so I'm going to use that. \nInstall it:\nsudo apt-get install xautomation\n\n(\nTo call a single key press: xte 'key keyName'\nTo call a key combination: xte 'keydown keyName' 'keydown secondKeyName' 'keyup keyName' 'keyup secondKeyName\nFor more info you can read the manual man xte\n)\nLets open up the config file you made earlier: (the one you made using xbindkeys --defaults > $HOME/.xbindkeysrc)\ngedit .xbindkeysrc  \nYou'll get something like this:\n#\n# A list of keys is in /usr/include/X11/keysym.h and in\n# /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h\n# The XK_ is not needed.\n#\n# List of modifier:\n#   Release, Control, Shift, Mod1 (Alt), Mod2 (NumLock),\n#   Mod3 (CapsLock), Mod4, Mod5 (Scroll). \n#\n\n# The release modifier is not a standard X modifier, but you can  \n# use it if you want to catch release events instead of press events\n\n# By defaults, xbindkeys does not pay attention with the modifiers\n# NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock.\n# Uncomment the lines above if you want to pay attention to them.\n\n#keystate_numlock = enable\n#keystate_capslock = enable\n#keystate_scrolllock= enable\n\n# Examples of commands:\n\nEarlier you extracted the key/key combination. now that you know the command for simulating key presses you can call it from your xbindkeys script, like this:\n\"xte 'ctrl'\"\nCmd (or something like this depended upon the name given to you by xbindkeys)\nAdd this to you're xbindkeys script and save it.\nYou'll notice that it doesn't work (yet). That's because xbindkeys isn't running yet. start it with the following command.\nxbindkeys\n\nYour commands should work now. If it doesn't work you might wanna try adding commands to your key-combinations like copy and paste. If that doesn't work either there is an alternative but that's quite a lot of writing. You could also try xmodmap or xkeycaps.\nI would like to note that xbindkeys and xte don't always work well together.\nAs for your terminal shortcuts: You can change them ALL by opening your terminal and clicking edit in the top bar.\nThen click keyboard shortcuts and change the value of copy and paste under the header \"edit\" into ctrl (or in your case cmd) + c and ctrl + v\n\nA: Searching in other questions I've found this tool to map the Ctrl to the Macbook key board CMD Left to do CMD + C or CMD + V or something else:\nInstall gnome-tweaks application:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweaks\nOpen the application Applications -> Gnome Tweaks and map the CTRL to WIN(Same as CMD in Mac) doing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keyboard and Mouse\n\n*Additional Layout Options(Left Super)\n\n*Alt/Win key Behavior\n\n*Ctrl is mapped to Win and the usual Ctrl keys`\n\n\nEnjoy the CMD + C or CMD + V in your OSX VirtualBox using ubuntu-18 VM.\n\nA: I'm still running Ubuntu 12.04 for various reasons, so I can't speak for later iterations, but try this:\nOkay, firstly, you might want to set your VB host key to something specific such as the right command or right alt key...something you don't use normally. I think the default is the left command key, which is going to interfere with most people's operations. \nThis can be done in the preferences for VirtualBox itself (rather than inside the guest machine or as any machine-specific setting). With the VB app open (not the VM window), choose VirtualBox->Preferences->Input, then select the host key at the head of the \"Virtual Machine\" field/mapping list.\nOkay, after that, inside the Ubuntu guest machine itself:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your system settings, and choose Keyboard Layout.\n\n*Open the Layouts tab.\n\n*You'll probably have only one entry - English (US) or somesuch. Highlight this and click the \"Options\" button in the lower right.\n\n*Open up the \"Alt/Win Key Behaviour\" expander.\n\n*Choose \"Control is mapped to Win keys (and the usual Ctrl keys)\".\n\n\nYou should find that your Mac command key now works as desired for command-C, command-V etc.\n\nA: In the case of Kubuntu 18.04 with Plasma 5, what worked for me was (In System Settings / Input Devices / Keyboards) setting the hardware  as '104-key generic' and the layout as 'english (macintosh)'\n\nA: For me, using Ubuntu 21.10 on a Macbook Pro the following worked:\nSettings -> Keyboard -> + (add input source) -> English ([your locale]) -> English (Macintosh).\nMake sure you remove all of the other keyboard \"input sources\" as mine didn't work until I removed those.\n\nA: By far the easiest and user friendly solution is to install Kinto, that was made exactly for this: https://github.com/rbreaves/kinto#What-does-this-do-exactly\nUnfortunately, several answers like the most upvoted from @boulder_ruby simply don't re-map any keys.\nI can confirm Kinto works with Ubuntu 20.04.\nWorks with both Mac and other keyboards, languages and even local / non local virtual machines!\n\nA: That will depend on the software you are using to run your virtual machine.\nFor exemple, I use VMWare Fusion to run Ubuntu on my Mac and to achieve what you want, I went to \"Settings\" of VMWare Fusion and setup the key-mapping I wanted inside that specific virtual machine (I can have multiple setups, one for each VM).\nI never used VirtualBox, but I'm pretty sure you can do that in the Settings of VirtualBox. \n", "Q: unable to Install Ubuntu Desktop 13.10 Good day,\nI am trying to perform a new install of Ubuntu-Desktop (ubuntu-13.10-desktop-i386.iso) using a USB. The machine boots into the USB however it starts alternating between a blank screen and a purple screen with the mouse cursor in the middle of the screen and eventually gives me the message/error below. When I hold down the shift key while its booting into the USB stick I get the menu with the options Try Ubuntu without installing, Install Ubuntu, Check disc for defects, Test Memory, Boot from first Hard disk. The only two options that perform the function it should are Check disc for defects and Test Memory. All other options alternate between a blank screen and purple screen and eventually the below message/error.\nI have read many pages on the below message/error but all seem to be related to a machine that is either been upgraded from another version with the OS on the HDD therefore enabling them to perform many of the given fixes. I don't have any OS on the system and am trying to install for the first time. This machine used to have Windows XP but that no longer works missing system files therefore I am trying to install ubuntu 13.10. I have also tried installing using a DVD and that does the same.\nI have downloaded a new copy of Ubuntu tested the checksum, tested the disk integrity all 100%. In the install menu I receive after pressing shift, I select nomodeset and have also tried to enter in the bottom line of text vga=771 but still nothing same as before.\nMESSAGE/ERROR: The system is running in low-graphics mode Your screen, graphics card, and input device settings could not be detected correctly. You will need to configure these yourself.\nAfter clicking OK I receive another menu but any option I choose there I get a grey screen and then nothing.\nI am installing on a Desktop PC System: Mecer Xtreme Pentium 4 3015MHz, 500MB DDR RAM\nRemember I have no working OS on the machine therefore I am not sure what to do, please assist.\n\nA: I'm by no means an expert, and my answer should really be in the comment area but I can't post there since I'm a guest. I would suggest trying the server iso as it uses a text based installer it should avoid any graphics issues, you can install the standard desktop experience to it once you have it up and running.\n2 Things to keep in mind when installing the server edition for desktop use are. 1 when the option to install packages come up during the installation use the down arrow to go to \"Manual Package Selection\" DO NOT SELECT THE OPTION THOUGH, just press return to continue with your installation, 2 when you have successfully installed the OS and boot it up you will just see a terminal screen, you will need to enter your \"username\" then \"password\", then type \"sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\" which will install your normal desktop interface found on the desktop version of ubuntu, alternatively if need be you can install a different desktop environment that is less demanding if needed such as \"xubuntu-desktop\".\nI do not know that this will help solve your issue, but it's where I would start. \n", "Q: How do I add the messaging menu to the xfce-panel 4.10?

Since then, at each login, a dialog window entitled Mail authentication request ... Please enter the password for account ...@gmail.com appears. I neither have any idea why my password (I checked it a hundred times) does not work (\"Password was incorrect\") nor why this dialog is displayed at all. As said, I never saw it before 13.10. I looked around in different forums and it seems (please correct me if I am wrong) that it stems from evolution server. I also deleted ~/.config/evolution/ entirely - without any effect.

I believe it was related to searching Google Docs in the dash.  \nYou might want to look at the answers to this question, which yours seems to duplicate. \n\nA: Your \"Password was incorrect\" problem is because GMail identifies Evolution as a less secure app, so doesn't provide authentication to the app.\nYou can change this feature if you want, see Google's documentation on less secure apps.\nBut if you don't want to allow your email access to evolution, you can remove your gmail account in evolution by following these steps\n\n\n*\n\n*Open \"Evolution\"\n\n*Edit\n\n*Preferences\n\n*Select your email account, then press \"delete\"\n\n\nThis should remove your email account from evolution and no more signing in troubles anymore.\n\nA: Remove the account from Online Accounts in settings.\n\nA: I had the same problem - pop-up window asking me for the password for \"personal\" account. I didn't even know what 'personal' account. What helped me was removing evolution folder from /home/.config rm -rf ~/.config/evolution or using gui - go to files>preferences>views and make sure the box show hidden and back up files is tick then navigate to /home/.config where you can locate and delete your evolution folder. Good luck! \n\nA: I opened Settings and the menu Online accounts and noticed that there was a message about expired credentials. Clicking that displayed a login for my google account and after inserting those the request is gone.\n\nA: I had the same problem. The problem was that evolution had an old password for Gmail. When I opened evolution, I got the same message, but put my proper gmail password in and saved it to the key-ring. That solved the problem.\n\nA: I've found that this issue for me was resolved by removing the Firewall Configuration application.\n", "Q: Shift and alt key?

I would recommend  just making a bash script with the rsync and a find and delete script or just a rm -r.\nSomething like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nrsync -avvru --delete-excluded /remote/location /local/location\n\nrm -rf /remote/location\n\n\nA: Use this:\nrsync -avvu --remove-source-files /remote/source /local/destination\nWhile this deletes successfully transferred files from the source, it does not delete directories.\nThe --delete-excluded option enables deletion of excluded files from destination, not from the source. To simplify, all --delete options delete files from destination, which you probably don't want.\nAlso, there is no need for -r in this case. The -a parameter implies it.\n", "Q: Can you Install/ Uninstall ubuntu packages too many times? A question i would like to ask is: what happens if I uninstall/install a package too many times in ubuntu? for example ejabberd.\n\nA: Standard Linux distribution packages are just a bunch of files in an archive that get extracted and configured during installation and partly or fully (with configuration files via --purge option) removed during uninstallation. That's why uninstallation is also called removal of packages.\nApart from ususal hard drive wearout and growing package manager log files, which are automatically compressed and deleted after some time (see Linux Log Files and logrotate), nothing happens.\nAfter all it seems only logical, that you can't break much by moving or deleting the same file repeatedly over and over again.\nWith the arrival of affordable consumer SSDs, delay in data retrieval or crippled performance and throughput caused by suboptimal data placement on platters also has become more trivial than before.\nOne thing that can break are dependencies, but that can also be fixed.\n\nA: there is no reason to think something will happen to your system!\nIf you use Ubuntu Software Center to (un-)install software, even your configurations are stored in your home folder.\nyou should be cautious when changing the source of the software you use.\n", "Q: Are Qt Quick Controls available on Ubuntu 13.10? I was looking to do UI development in QML, and I really want it to look native.

Consequently you cannot use Qt Quick Controls with the current version of Qt5 in Ubuntu repositories.\nIf you want to use them, you have got 3 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using official Qt Project packages for Linux. You can download them here.\n\n*Waiting a version of Ubuntu whose Qt5 version would be at least Qt 5.1. Trusty Tahr will likely have Qt 5.1 or Qt 5.2 in its repositories.\n\n*If you are developing something for Ubuntu, you can use the components which are in the Ubuntu SDK. Ubuntu.Components (it is their name) are not the real Qt Quick Controls but they are very similar and if you know how Ubuntu.Components work, you will know how Qt Quick Controls work. For further informations, have a look at the corresponding page on Ubuntu Developer.\n\n", "Q: Why is $0 set to -bash?

This means that I have to switch profiles, execute whatever commands I need with sudo through the admin profile and then go back to work.\nThis is rather uncomfortable, as sometimes I have got open web pages with the instructions of what I have to do on my work profile.\nIs there a way to use sudo with admin username/password while I am still logged in as 'work'?\nAre there any other alternatives?\n\nA: The most convenient way is to use the terminal where you can launch programs with admin privileges. There are 2 options:\n\n*\n\n*You can add your normal user to the group of sudoers:\nsudo adduser normal-username sudo\n\nSee Can I have a user execute sudo commands without being an administrator?\nNow you can execute commands in the terminal by writing sudo command\n\n\n*Use your admin profile:\nTo use your admin profile in the terminal, you can su to that user, like su admin-username and then enter the admin user's password.

On a personal note, I find youtube-dl very easy to use (I just type yo and Tab in terminal and it auto-completes it for me). It can also download every video by a specific channel and has a multitude of options.\nI believe you can set it to continue downloads with the -c option and if you do that for a channel, it should download only new ones if in the same directory as the others were downloaded to, but have not tried it in practice. If you can, then you can run youtube-dl on a script and it will only download the files when there are new ones.\n", "Q: lxc containers hangs after upgrade to 13.10 I have 3 lxc containers.

Any ideas why these containers are hanging?\n\nA: There are some new settings you need in fstab/config. Rather than paste them here, I'll put my general guide to fixing this problem when you upgrade lxc:\n\n\n*\n\n*Realize that LXC is broken in the new version, ugh\n\n*Create a new container from a default template, using e.g. lxc-create -t ubuntu -n CN\n\n*Run a diff between the new container's config and fstab files and modify your existing containers appropriately\n\n*Cross your fingers and try again\n\n\nThis methodology worked for me after upgrading to 13.10.\n", "Q: keyboard status leds not working Running Ubuntu 13.10 64bit\nThe status leds are not working correctly on my new keyboard under Ubuntu. Pressing Caps Lock and Num Lock do not cause the leds to turn on/off to reflect their status. Rather I have a num lock led stuck on, and a caps lock led that never turns on. The actual function of the caps lock and num lock is unaffected though, just the leds not working.\nI am able to use ¨setleds¨ to turn the leds on an off from a console session, so I don´t think there's any hardware problem. Also the keyboard does not have the same problem under windows 7.\nAnyone have any solutions?\nthanks!\nThe keyboard in question is a Monoprice mechanical gaming keyboard:\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0081TQ83K/ \nhttp://www.monoprice.com/Product?c_id=114&cp_id=11401&cs_id=1140102&p_id=9181&seq=1&format=2\nWhich itself seems to be an own branded Qpad MK-85\n\nA: I have a very similar keyboard (MaxKeyboard Nighthawk X8, looks identical to yours), and the following terminal command worked for me:\nsudo kbd_mode -u\n\nThis should fix the NumLock LED issue.  The CapsLock issue still eludes me, and I haven't been able to locate much regarding that myself.

Just earlier on today, I have uninstalled Ubuntu as I didn't like it that much, so I uninstalled it. Back on windows, I check my hard drive and it seems as there is about 5GB taken from something, I believe that uninstalling Ubuntu didn't get rid of all the files since the uninstaller was finished in about 2 seconds. Is there a manual way to get rid of those files or some alternative way? Thanks!\n\nA: From https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide#How_do_I_manually_uninstall_Wubi.3F\n\nHow do I manually uninstall Wubi?\nRemove C:\\ubuntu and C:\\wubildr*\nIn Windows XP you need to edit C:\\boot.ini and delete the Ubuntu/Wubi line. Alternatively you can modify the boot menu via Control Panel > System > Advanced > Startup and Recovery and pressing \"Edit\". For Windows 98 you have to edit C:\\config.sys and remove the Wubi block. For Windows Vista/7, you can use the built-in bcdedit command or install EasyBCD to edit the boot menu. To use bcdedit, run cmd.exe as an administrator, then enter bcdedit to show all boot entries, note the {GUID} specified for the Ubuntu entry, and then remove it: bcdedit /delete {GUID}\nTo remove Wubi from the add/remove list, delete the registry key: HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\Wubi\nAn easy method of removing this registry key is to paste the following text into a plain editor such as Notepad, close and save the file as something like removeWubiKey.reg (you may wish to go to Folder Options > View and disable the \"Hide file extensions for known file types\" option to check that the .reg extension has been applied correctly). Then you can perform the rest automatically by opening the file in the normal Windows manner, or choosing the \"Merge\" option from the right click context menu. Note: The formatting is rather strict, so copy the text exactly for best results. You may need to be logged in as the administrator to delete the key, depending on the version of Windows you are using. User Account Control in Vista may also ask for permission, in the typical fashion.\nREGEDIT4\n[-HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\Wubi]\nAfter deleting the registry key, Ubuntu may still appear in the program list.

Check out this link to shut down your windows 8 pc fully (link to another question click here for their tutorial they found to disable fast boot).\nRunning the command mount -t ntfs-3g -o ro /dev/sda1 /media/sd4 makes it read only hence the ro.

Ubuntu has a very cool notification system. Is there a way to make Ubuntu read out notifications when they appear?\nOr is it possible to link the text in notifications to espeak? \n\nA: This question is really interesting so as the answer.\ndbus-monitor when executed waits for the signal and when arrives it catches and gives the appropriate information about it. Similarly it can be executed to get the info about Notifications. When executed:\ndbus-monitor \"interface='org.freedesktop.Notifications'\" | grep --line-buffered \"member=Notify\\|string\"\n\nIt will wait for the notifications and when any notification arrives it gives the information of the notifications.\nFor example when sound is increased/decreased or any song track is changed or any other it gives the message. I'm manually creating a desktop notification using notify-send  command on any other terminal:\nnotify-send \"Hello How are you?\"\n\nThen the first terminal in which dbus-monitor command is executing will give message like:\nsaurav@saurav-P4I45Gx-PE:~$ dbus-monitor \"interface='org.freedesktop.Notifications'\" | grep --line-buffered \"member=Notify\\|string\"\n   string \":1.473\"\nmethod call sender=:1.474 -> dest=:1.475 serial=7    path=/org/freedesktop/Notifications; interface=org.freedesktop.Notifications;  member=Notify\n   string \"notify-send\"\n   string \"\"\n   string \"Hello How Are You?\"\n   string \"\"\n         string \"urgency\"\n\nNow above output can be easily passed to espeak to read message. \nFor example,\nReplacing the above dbus-monitor command with following will read the notification message:\nCheck, How does it work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Execute this command in a terminal and leave it running:\ndbus-monitor \"interface='org.freedesktop.Notifications'\" | grep --line-buffered \"string\" | grep --line-buffered -e method -e \":\" -e '\"\"' -e urgency -e notify -v | grep --line-buffered '.*(?=string)|(?<=string).*' -oPi | grep --line-buffered -v '^\\s*$' | xargs -I '{}' espeak {}\n\nI know it has become very long, but there is no other way to make it small because the filtering of actual notification made it lengthy.\n\n*Then run a desktop notification either the way I described above using notify-send or any thing else. I'm using notify-send. So executing following command in other terminal:\nnotify-send \"Hello! I am Saurav Kumar.\"\n\nAs soon as you execute the command it will speak(read) the notification. \nAlthough it ate my 4-5 hours, but I'm happy now to make it working.\nYou can also make your own command like saynoti and execute it every time you want a reading notification. By following these steps you can do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*First save the actual command to a file called saynoti. You can use any file name that will become your actual command name.\n\n*Then make the file executable and move or copy it to /bin:\nchmod +x saynoti\nsudo cp saynoti /bin\n\n\n*Now you can simply execute your new command to start Speaking Notification:\nsaynoti\n\n\n*To kill the running process you can execute this command:\npkill dbus-monitor\n\nor simply press Ctrl + C on the terminal where saynoti is running.\n\n*You can also run saynoti every time your system starts by making it a start-up application.\nI would like to say thank you for this question. Because of this question, I learned a lot of things. :)\nReply if you get any problem or need any further change/modification.

The variables are then initialised outside of the until loop, so they can be incremented as necessary in the loop using C style (( var++ )) notation.\nI then create another array for the question numbers, in this case for 19 questions I must include 0 - 18 inclusive:\nquestions_order=(15 4 1 10 8 3 13 0 11 16 2 7 5 17 6 9 14 18 12)\n\nand then shuffle it using shuf and create a new array and use that for this particular run of the script:\nshuffled_order=( $(shuf -n19 -e ${questions_order[@]}) )\n\nThis must be done outside of the loop, as I only want it executed once.\nIn short, the loop now runs until the current number of questions is equal to the \"${target_questions}\" variable, and then the results are given.\nWhen a user gives a response to a question it will be interpreted by the various conditions in the case statement. Non answers (blanks), wrong answers, correct answers, and passes are all detected and receive responses, and the various variables are all incremented (e.g. for a wrong answer, (( wrong++ ))).\nWhen the last question has been answered, the user's performance is evaluated where the number of right, wrong answers and passes (if any) are relayed and the time taken is also given.\nThis is a brief explanation, but the script itself has various comments that should make the workings clear(ish)! It could be adapted for any other type of quiz, say on capitals and countries. \nWhen you have copied the script into a file, make it executable (chmod u+x), and run it with ./scriptname or place it in your ~/bin folder and call it by name like any other program, assuming your ~/bin is in PATH.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n# by mik, aka Exactus29, https://github.com/Exactus29\n# \n#\n# This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n# it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n# the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n# (at your option) any later version.\n\n# This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n# but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n# MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It is instructions for creating a USB installer, but you can follow a link on the side for DVD instructions.\n\nA: You can download and burn an Ubuntu .ISO onto a DVD or use a USB installer as answered by iamwpj.\nIf you wish to burn it to disc then it must be a DVD, as current 700MB CD's will not fit all of the information upon it.\nUbuntu .ISO is 883MB, so it will not fit onto a standard Compact Disc.\nBurn the disc at the slowest speed possible to ensure that the image is of excellent quality.\n\nA: Once downloaded you get an image.

Is there another program that can be downloaded which does the same thing so I can re-install Windows and put it on a DVD?\n\nA: i dont realy get it Oo\nyou have a .ISO file to put on a DVD ?\nif yes here is the solution:\njust start your burning software (e.g.: Brasero) click on \"burn image\" choose your .ISO-file and insert a proper CD/DVD and start burning.\nIs that what you need ?\n", "Q: Laptop overheats when running Ubuntu 13.10 I've been away from Ubuntu since introduction of the Unity interface.  When 13.10 was released I figured I'd give it another shot and installed it on my HP G62.  This laptop has an AMD V120 cpu and a Gallium 0.4 on AMD RS880 gpu.  I've also got 6gb ram installed and am using the original HDD.\nMy laptop overheats so much, I have to regularly turn it off and wait for a while before continuing to use it. The bottom surface is so hot that I cannot let it touch my leg and the top surface is getting almost too hot to touch, too.  I even noticed that the laptop is now producing a very hot smell that is really concerning me.\nI've tried several things I've read here on AaskUbuntu like editing /etc/default/grub to use GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"acpi_osi=Linux quiet splash\".  I've installed FWTS along with a few other utilities to no avail.\nThis computer does not run very hot when using windows 7 or any other gnu/linux distros including Ubuntu derivatives.\nIf anybody could please suggest another option or inform me that I should use another OS, I'd appreciate it.\n\nA: How much resources do you use in system-monitor. i think the unity-surface is very high in consumption. perhaps thy same ubuntu with diffrent surface? (e.G. lxde? / Kde?)\n\nA: You can try indicator-cpufreq or TLP.  Should also install a temperature indicator like Xsensors.  I imagine that you have check your fans are working and have cleaned out the dust and dirt.  Indicator-cpufreq works similar to the jupiter applet.   \n", "Q: How to make Guake start at login? I had to reinstall Ubuntu and always used Guake Terminal and it was always starting when the desktop appeared and I only pressed F12 and it did everything I had to.\nBut now it doesn't start automatically. I was looking for an answer but nothing worked. Has anybody ideas how to solve it ? It would be really nice to use it as earlier ;)\n\nA: Goto Activities or to Show Applications menu and type Startup Applications.\n\nThe Startup Application Preferences window opens. Then, click in Add, give a name for the application in the Name field (\"Guake\" it's enough), and then type “guake” without quotes in the Command field and click Add. Then close the Startup Application Preferences window and restart the machine, now Guake should start automatically on login.\nSource\n\nA: Use this:\nsudo cp /usr/share/applications/guake.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/\n\n\nA: This helps for me:\nGuake Doesn't Start When Session Starts\nIn Guake's preferences just uncheck Enable notifications on startup, and add the full path (e.g. `/usr/bin/guake) to startup applications.\n\nA: Have you tried adding it to the startup applications (search \"startup applications\")\nIf you have, try adding a .desktop file to  /etc/xdg/autostart/\nYou can do this with the following command\nsudo ln -s /usr/share/applications/guake.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/\n\nThis is just an example, I don't know what the guake .desktop file is named but you can easily find out by having a look in the map: /usr/share/applications/ \nIf by chance that doesn't work as well then there is one other solution you could try adding the following command to the startup applications\nbash -c \"sleep 10 && guake\"\n\nIf it doesn't work try varying the sleep time because it depends on your system's speed but usually 10 seconds will work just fine.\n\nA: locate guake.desktop then do,\n$ cp /usr/share/applications/guake.desktop ~/.config/autostart/\n$ echo \"X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\" >> guake.desktop\n\n\nA: You may rather use guake --hide at startup for just opening the prgrm in background and not the terminal window until F12 is pressed.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 ethernet not working on an Desktop I am new to ubuntu and just wiped my harddrive to oinstall it on an old desktop.\nBut I cannot connect to the internet even though the cable is plugged in ( I checked the cable with my laptop and it works fine) Please help me thank you.\n\nA: As you said it is old desktop.\nBut even with old one Ethernet card should work.\nYou should check if LED near LAN connection flashes with green.\nIf so you probably need to detect connection settings.\n\n You should read about dhcp. It should connect automatically for you.\nUnless your ISP provides you with user and password so you need to type it with your IP adress in Network Connections window.\n   \n", "Q: How to change file managers \"files\" icon to nice \"nautilus shell\" icon in Ubuntu 12.04? I've attached Nautilus to Unity launcher in Ubuntu 12.04.\nIn Ubuntu 12.04 the default \"Files\" icon for Nautilus file manager is not as pretty as a \"Nautilus Shell\" icon. \nBut when I search in Dash for Nautilus it gives \"Files\" link to Nautilus, which has grey and quite plain file-cabinet icon. \nHow do I change this grey file cabinet icon to the Nautilus' shell icon, which suits well to my icon theme?\n\nA: From /usr/share/applications/ copy the files\n\n\n*\n\n*brasero-nautilus.desktop\n\n*nautilus.desktop\n\n*nautilus-folder-handler.desktop\nto ~/.local/share/applications/. Open them with gedit and change the Icon field.\nIf what you want is a standard icon, you can give the icon name (like system-file-manager for the file cabinet, vlc for vlc, etc).\nI don't think the nautilus shell falls under this category. If so, you can download the required icon onto your computer and provide the full path to it in the Icon field. Make sure there are no spaces in the file path.\n\nEDIT: How to find which files to copy\n\n\n*\n\n*Open /usr/share/applications/ in nautilus.\n\n*Wait for it load completely.\n\n*Copy the files with file cabinet icon to ~/.local/share/applications/.\n\n", "Q: Where can I fix control-clicking in Ubuntu?

However it will be too slow for practical purposes.\nNote that if you put Ubuntu on your HD, then there is no need for the kids to have a separate machine or disc. As long as you don't make them Administrators, there is nothing they can mess up apart from their own home directories.\n\nA: A true (practical usable) ubuntu install cannot be made on a flash drive (well it can but it's quite difficult to do properly and fully functional)\nYou can however install ubuntu on an external hard drive (you can buy those for like 25 dollars because the capacity doesn't have to be that big).\nFirst thing you do (optional but it might save you the trouble of having to fix your windows disk if you make a mistake) is disconnect your internal hard drive (it's not that hard, just take out the cable).\nNext is just plain installing ubuntu on the external hard drive.\nReconnect your internal hard drive.\nChange your boot setting so the usb has boot priority and you're done\nNow I do have to note that unless you have usb 3.0 or e-sata it might run a little sluggish but not so much as to make it unusable.

I'm using a Dell Inspiron N5110 laptop with Ubuntu 13 and I find that every time I plug the power in to charge, the screen brightness dims. If I go into the brightness settings window the brightness immediately goes back to full brightness (as they are set) without me changing anything. In order to keep the screen brightness on full I have to keep the brightness settings window open in the background. As soon as the battery is charged the brightness drops again until I unplug the power again. This happens every time and now I know how to get round it it's not a huge problem but still quite annoying. Any advice would be gratefully received. Let me know if you need any more info.\nI'm quite new to Ubuntu so if you can give me nice simple instructions that would be great :) \n\nA: Until someone comes up with an answer, here is at least a partial workaround that I use for the same problem (Dell Insprion 1525, 13.10).        \nI use \"Indicator Brightness\" http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/04/brightness-control-ubuntu which allows you to simply mouse over the indicator and roll the scroll wheel to increase the brightness.  If I am in a situation that makes it difficult to even see the indicator I will move the mouse, plug in the adapter, roll the wheel up, and bang you're back in business.    \nAs explained in the article...\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:indicator-brightness/ppa\n\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install indicator-brightness\n\n\nA: I'm experiencing this issue with my Dell Inspiron 15.

As long as this script runs, I'm protected.\nPro: It solves the problem. With this, I could always turn the brightness back up.\nCon: Also prevents extreme manual dimming. (But doesn't prevent turning the monitor off, so doesn't break ACPI).\n\nI put this in ~/bin/prevent_dimming.sh\nand then, in a terminal/screen/initialization script, keep this program running (as root!):\n$ sudo ~/bin/prevent_dimming.sh\n#!/bin/bash\nTHRESH=50\nwhile [ 1 == 1 ]; do\n    ME=$(cat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness)\n    if [ \"$ME\" -lt \"$THRESH\" ]; then\n        echo $THRESH > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n    fi\n    sleep 5\ndone\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem with a Dell Inspiron 1420, but was able to brighten the display using the Function key plus the up arrow (Fn+Up).\n", "Q: Is Ubuntu One a peer-to-peer application? What sort of technology does Ubuntu One use for file syncing? I was told by my school that Ubuntu One and http://one.ubuntu.com are blocked because it is a \"peer-to-peer application\", while they still allow Google Drive. Is this true? Or is it some sort of misunderstanding? I'm hoping for a response from someone who understands the technical details of how Ubuntu One works.\n\nA: Short Answer:\nNo, is a cloud/sever based file storage.\nLong Answer:\n\nWhat sort of technology does Ubuntu One use for file syncing?\n\nExcerp from Technical Details wiki:\n\nThis provides remotely accessible disk space stored on Amazon S3. Rather than using an existing protocol (eg. FTP, SFTP, NFS, Webdav) access to this remote disk space is via an invented-here communication protocol called \"ubuntuone-storageprotocol\" based on Google Protocol Buffers.\n\nExcerp of the README of the ubuntu-storage-protocol package (aka ubuntuone-storageprotocol):\n\nProtocol Overview:\nSince it is not well-documented elsewhere, I'll also give a very brief\n  outline of the protocol interactions here.\nMost client/server communication is in the form of client-initiated\n  requests.  Each message from the client initiating a request is given\n  a request ID which is intended to be unique for the lifetime of the\n  connection.\nThe actual method for generating request IDs doesn't matter as long as\n  they are even numbers (e.g. 0, 2, 4, ...) and aren't re-used by different\n  requests on the same connection (but note that some requests may involve\n  multiple messages).  Server responses to a client request will use the\n  client-supplied request ID, but server-originated messages will have a\n  server-assigned ID which is odd (e.g. 1, 3, 5, ...).  In effect, when the\n  low bit of the request ID is set, it indicates a server-initiated request.\nThe protocol is asynchronous in that multiple requests may be \"in flight\"\n  at once, their messages (if there are multiple messages in the\n  request) arbitrarily interleaved.\n[...]\nWhen downloading the content of a node, the client and server have a\n  brief exchange followed by a series of messages bearing data, all with\n  the same request id.  Uploads work similarly -- in both cases, the request\n  ID identifies a particular in-progress upload or download.\n\nProvided this, there is no way that the protocol can be seen as P2P connections. Peer-to-Peer implies several nodes/clients (but no servers holding files)  where each of them can share files/connections. In this case there's only a server and several clients that send/receives data using a structured transfer protocol. It's nowhere near BitTorrent, eDonkey, nor other P2P protocols.\nAs to establish the difference, let's define P2P:\n\nA peer-to-peer (P2P) network is a type of decentralized and distributed network architecture in which individual nodes in the network (called \"peers\") act as both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the centralized client–server model where client nodes request access to resources provided by central servers.\n\n", "Q: Any way to stop the Launcher from appearing when click-dragging a file? So when you click-drag a file, if the launcher is auto-hidden it'll appear for this, any way to stop that?\n\nJust wondering, ubuntu13.10  unity 7.1.2\n\nA: When you start dragging the file, the possible drop targets are automatically activated. Notice that the file manager, the drive and removable devices, and the trash are highlighted. This in turn causes the launcher to show itself. \nTo prevent this behavior, you would need to remove these icons from the launcher; but as far as I can tell, it is not possible to remove the trash icon. \nSo, no it is not possible to keep the launcher from showing itself when you drag files.\n", "Q: does Chrome in Ubuntu have \"Recent Tabs\"? Ubuntu 12, Chrome 30 \nAs noted here, Chrome has a Recent Tabs feature. But in Ubuntu I don't see that option. Do I need to turn it on or is it just not available? When I search in settings there's no results for \"recent\". \n\nA: Basically, no.\nThe update your article refers to is about the Windows version of Chrome, and the Linux version didn't get this. We still have the 'Recently Closed' menu on the New Tab page. Personally, I prefer it, but you might want to hunt around chrome://flags and see if you can find a setting.\nAs Saurav Kumar noted, pressing Ctrl+Shift+T will bring back the recently closed tabs with the most recently closed tab first, which is very similar to the Recent Tabs menu item. \n\nA: It seems that this is dependent on the \"Instant Extended API\" feature of Google Chrome which is not available on Linux yet.\nThe addition of the \"Recent Tabs\" menu entry was (I believe) to compensate for the loss of the \"Recently Closed\" entry in the old New Tab page which Linux still has, so, no \"Recent Tabs\" menu entry.\nNote: If you want the old New Tab page back on Windows (and the Recently Closed entry gone), disable \"Instant Extended API\" from here:\nchrome://flags/#enable-instant-extended-api\n", "Q: Torrentflux stopped working after upgrade to 13.10 Did a clean upgrade fom 13.4.

Considering that some systems have both Intel 4xxx and Nvidia/other graphics card, yet apparently it isn't easy to switch between them on Linux, is it really worth it getting the extra Nvidia card, like in the Bonobo Extreme laptop?\nIn terms of normal web browsing/ web development / programming /webGL use, does Ubuntu take advantage of a second graphics card, or use it for processing like Mac OS Grand Central?\n\nA: I have a Thinkpad W520 with both intel and nvidia graphics (via nvidia optimus). I very, very, rarely use the nvidia graphics card, and I think that if I were to buy it again, I would skip the extra card because of the extra hassle it brings.\nThe intel card is perfectly adequate for web browsing, programming, and even some light 3D things like the occasional google earth adventure. If you were to get a linux-optimized laptop with an nvidia card like the bonobo extreme, I would imagine that it would always use the nvidia card, which would severely cut battery life. Most of the time, I completely turn off my nvidia card to save power.\nIf you are thinking about getting a laptop designed for windows with nvidia optimus, be prepared to learn much more than you want to about the graphics systems. Since nvidia and the open source graphics community haven't been fully cooperating, getting things like extra monitors to work with optimus is very difficult on some models.\nI am not aware of any programs running on my machine that use the GPU for non-graphics processing, except for research codes that I have occasionally been involved with.\n", "Q: What to do with private bug reports on launchpad? Over time I gathered more than 10 launchpad bug reports that were reported with apport, initially marked as private and never responded to.\nThere was one I've discussed additionally on IRC and that's the only one I can remember being processed.\nWhat should I do with them? How can I make sure they don't contain anything really private before making those bugs public?\n\nA: As a member of Bug Control, I've had to work with these private bugs on occasion.  There is a specific policy on handling private bugs, and checking for specific information.\nFor crash bugs, the general thing you have to look for in the private bugs are core dumps and any stacktraces that may be on the bug.  If a core dump is attached, remove it.  If there's stacktraces attached, look through them and identify any possibly private data in the stack trace.  If there looks to be private data, then what you have to do is download the stacktrace, edit out the private data, upload the edited version, then remove the old version.\nAs well, find any other Personally Identifiable Information, or private information, such as social security numbers, account numbers, passwords, etc., and try and edit those out as well.\nFor other private bugs, it depends, since there are separate policies for private security bugs which I am not privy to as those are handled by the Security team, and it likely would only be \"Private Security\" marked if the bug was legitimately a security risk that they could not publicize the information for.\nThere can also be private bugs that are not against the Ubuntu packages but are against other projects on Launchpad (i.e. not the Ubuntu project or an Ubuntu package).  For those bugs, the managers of that project will be setting forth the policies for those bugs.\n\nAdditional information on how to triage Apport crash reports and other private bugs in Ubuntu can be found on the Ubuntu Wiki, in the How to Triage guide, as part of the Bug Squad's knowledge base.  The link will automatically point you to the \"Apport reports\" section, however for the most up to date information on triage guidelines you should refer to that wiki document.\n", "Q: Conky (or other apps) on Gnome-screensaver unlock screen I found this awesome theme for conky to make it look like google now but it really gets in the way on my desktop.

Everything was working fine in 13.04 and I could even play dota2 on steam.  Since upgrading to 13.10 it has been a nightmare.\nRadeon 7770 card gives a black screen of death when loading Ubuntu.  I am unable to get to a tty screen using the Radeon 7770 card and I have tried multiple kernels.\nTherefore, I was forced to used the inbuilt motherboard graphics card.  On first load, there was lots of error and Ubuntu had to run in low-res mode or some error like that appeared since the drivers installed was AMD catalyst and fglrx.  I removed them but I think it is incomplete and installed Xorg files.  So now, at least my Ubuntu starts up flawlessly if I used the inbuilt motherboard graphics with no errors at all.\nI have tried changing lightdm to gdm, adding sleep, trying nomodeset, etc everything but it always still get stuck at the load screen without ability to tty if I use my Radeon card.\nI am trying to install back my Radeon 7770 card now and install the drivers for it.  Since I cannot slot in the card and have the computer detect it and then install the drivers, I am trying to manually install the drivers before I slot in the card.\nI should have fglrx removed since there is no more fglrxinfo command.  I have removed all the extra ppas (I tried oibaf, etc before) from software updates.\nRight now, I have downloaded the latest AMD drivers and done a \nsudo sh amd-driver-installer-catalyst-13-4-x86.x86_64.run --buildpkg\n\ncommand and the deb files generate properly.

Am thinking of installing windows after all this frustration.\nThanks.\nEDIT ONE:\nOK I think I have partially solved the issue so if anyone is experiencing the same problems as me this might help.\nThe issue is that the drivers either work for my onboard card or my Radeon 7770 card.\nOriginally upgrading to 13.10 broke, so it was easier to fix the onboard card drivers first so that I can attempt to get to a terminal.  After that, I been trying to fix the Radeon 7770 card.\nWhat I did from the last portion is to \nsudo sh /usr/share/ati/fglrx-uninstall.sh -- force\n\nThis caused the onboard graphics card to break.  I would load into a black screen with just my X cursor.\nHowever, when I inserted my Radeon 7770 card now, it would at least also get me to the black screen with the X cursor.  Which is positive! (weirdly enough).  So now I could tty in with the Radeon Card installed.  I went to the deb files and could do a \nsudo dpkg -i fglrx*.deb\n\nI also reinstalled the unity desktop.\nOn reboot, I could see the screen now with my Radeon 7770! There is still lots of errors popping up and I have to scale the screen but seems positive.\nEdit Two\nSo I have been trying to install Steam after getting the Radeon 7770 card to work.

It was the button that used to be next to the time/calender button, left right side. Can it be configured or loaded?\n\nA: Like, Chih Ho mentioned this is a bug. I'd like to offer a work-arounds here. It may be useful for others in future as well, and I had a lot of fun while pondering this question, so might as well post this \"solution\".\nSo, you know how you can shutdown computer through bash, right? Well, it's also possible to log-out of the GUI through bash by entering gnome-session-quit (and don't worry about the whole gnome-session thing, it works regardless). What if you could make a script that brings up a terminal window and asks you to choose log-out or quit ? Well, here it is. \nBefore we even begin writing the script, open the file manager, go to Edit drop-down menu -> preferences -> Behavior, and check \"Run executable text files when they are opened.\" That will actually let you run a script from the Desktop.\n\nNow for the script itself. Open the terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), and type nano ~/Desktop/Logout_Script.sh . In this case I'm using nano text editor to create Logout_Script.sh on desktop, but that's a formality - you can choose whatever text editor you like.\nHere's the body of the script itself:\n#!/bin/bash\nxterm -hold -e \" echo  'Enter your password to shutdown, Ctrl+C to logout instead'; sudo shutdown -P +10 || gnome-session-quit --logout  \"\n\nLet's see what is actually going on here. xterm -hold -e \"  \" will open xterm window and hold it, and execute whatever set of command you place in between the quotation marks. In this case it will open xterm window and hold it, and echo a prompt for you to enter password to shutdown, or if you want to cancel to press Ctrl+C. What comes next is the actual shutdown command, which will ask you for password. The logical or (||) will evaluate if shutdown exits successfully or not. If you press Ctr+C at this stage, this will cancel shutdown, and execute next command , which is gnome-session-quit. That in turn, should bring up a transparent log-out prompt. Once you done writing, remember to modify the permissions of the script, so you can actually execute it. That is, \nsudo chmod 755 ~/Destop/Logout_Script.sh\n\nSo here's the xterm window that pops-up when I hit enter on the script(excuse the bright colors):\n\nNote, I mentioned that xterm -hold -e will hold xterm window until closed. That is, it will hold until you graphically close it, by pressing on the red x in the upper right corner, but if you plan to log out or shut down it won't be necessary, so we can ignore that. But what if you opened window, entered password, the system went for shutdown, and then half way you decided to cancel it? Then the window would hang around, and  you would have to kill it graphically. Why? Because shutdown command exited sucessfully, so logical or would not execute gnome-session-quit part of the script. Also, in the script I wrote sudo shutdown -P +10, which will shutdown computer within 10 minutes, but if you want immediate shutdown, you may want to write now instead of +10 . \nAnd one more thing: pay attention to the sequence of -hold and -e.

I have been trying to install CUDA. I installed it using:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-dev nvidia-cuda-doc nvidia-cuda-gdb nvidia-cuda-toolkit  \n\nWhat I want to know is what is the difference between installing it using the above command and the procedure given at the NVIDIA page here\n\nA: Mostly the version - Ubuntu's repository is a bit behind, as it prefers stability over cutting edge.\n\nA: It is recommended to install from 'apt-get'. Because .run file is intended to be an installer for all linux distributions, not only Ubuntu. The 'apt-get' version has been optimized so that it is compatible with Ubuntu distribution. The package may be, as explicitly stated by VincentSC, unstable and buggy.\n\nA: Realise this is a bit old now, but wanted to share my recent experience with Ubuntu 12.04 since it's relevant.\nUsing the package manager (i.e. running the commands listed in the OP), you are required to install package dependencies as usual.  These include the nvidia graphics drivers.  If you have already installed drivers using a .run file downloaded from nvidia, they will be overwritten.\nUsing the .run file to install cuda, you are given the option to install only cuda, leaving your pre-existing drivers intact.\nFor some reason, on my system the nvidia-331 module listed as a cuda dependency is broken.  Installing it leaves my system unable to boot.  Therefore, the option to install only cuda was very useful, because it meant I could source my own drivers from nvidia.\n\nA: While this post does answer a question I have, there are quite a few other questions I raised in a separate post that might interest any reader of this question. Here is the link to it: CUDA sample code did not get installed through sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit; any solutions?.\nOne big difference I have experienced is that the CUDA sample codes are missing when installing through apt-get; they will be obtained through the .run file (or so it is stated in Nvidia's docs). I hope that someone can answer my question; in my question, I also highlight an apparent difference which is that the location of the CUDA binaries will be different depending on which method you choose, which consequently affect your need of modifying your .bashrc file. \n", "Q: WOL doesn't wake PC (keyboard does).

It kept giving me \"Connection Failed: Stream setup failed\". I eventually figured out how to make it work like this.\n      You need to have pulseaudio installed, which you can check for in Synaptic Package Manager by typing pulseaudio into the search bar. You can install it from there if it isn't already installed.\n      Next, you need to install pavucontrol, either in Synaptic Package Manager, or by running this in the terminal.\n      Code:\n      sudo apt-get install pavucontrol\n      This is the unfortunate part. Every time you boot, you need to run this command in the terminal before any bluetooth devices attempt to connect.\n      Code:\n      pactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover\n      You can now go into the bluetooth manager and tell it to connect to the device as an A2DP audio sink.\n      Now, finally, if you go into the PulseAudio Volume Control, on the Playback tab, you can choose the option to send audio through the bluetooth device.\n      Good luck with this.\"\n\nI using this with Blueman (GTK+ Bluetooth Manager)\n\nA: I have been having similar problems.

And does anyone know the source of the more elaborate version?\n\nA: Depending on what source you use to install the program, there will be different versions, and sometimes on newer versions the maintainers update the manual for the application. I suppose the most accurate one is always the one you have installed, since is the manual for the exact same version in your system. If you search for help online, the parameters may be outdated (or too new). But sometimes online manuals are better because you may find more extensive explanations, and even examples of how to use the parameters, flags, etc.\n\nA: What you have found may be the man page of the sed utility on a Mac OS X system which is different from the sed utility you are using on Ubuntu. As far as I know while the sed utility on Mac OS X originates in BSD Unix, the sed utility on Ubuntu has been written by the GNU project.\nIf you need more detailed documentation about a GNU utility then it's worth opening its info document instead of its man page. In the GNU project, man pages are secondary. For example take a look at what you can find about the -i option in sed's info page: \n\n`-i[SUFFIX]'\n`--in-place[=SUFFIX]'\n\n   This option specifies that files are to be edited in-place.  GNU\n   `sed' does this by creating a temporary file and sending output to\n   this file rather than to the standard output.(1).\n\n   This option implies `-s'.\n\n   When the end of the file is reached, the temporary file is renamed\n   to the output file's original name.  The extension, if supplied,\n   is used to modify the name of the old file before renaming the\n   temporary file, thereby making a backup copy(2)).\n\n   This rule is followed: if the extension doesn't contain a `*',\n   then it is appended to the end of the current filename as a\n   suffix; if the extension does contain one or more `*' characters,\n   then _each_ asterisk is replaced with the current filename.  This\n   allows you to add a prefix to the backup file, instead of (or in\n   addition to) a suffix, or even to place backup copies of the\n   original files into another directory (provided the directory\n   already exists).\n\n   If no extension is supplied, the original file is overwritten\n   without making a backup.\n\n\n", "Q: How do I add more visualizations into VLC?

They use a swap file by default.\nOriginal Answer\nSome Basics\nUbuntu needs at least two partitions to work well. One is called the root partition denoted by / and is formatted ext4 and the other is called Swap with its own format. Windows does not understand these formats.\nSo you can't use Windows to create these partitions.\nWhat to do?\nThe partition you created in Windows is not suitable for Ubuntu. Delete the 100GB partition you have created and leave the space unallocated.\nWhen you install Ubuntu, it will find the unallocated space and create the partitions it needs automatically. The Swap will be a small partition (2-4 GB) used as virtual RAM and the rest of 100GB will be /.\nSee How do I install Ubuntu alongside a pre-installed Windows with UEFI?\nand Ubuntu installation on Windows7 with D partition for more details.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: How do I make krusader the default file manager?

I don't care if I mess up the system (which is likely if I do things like this), or the potential security issues that this could imply. Note, that I don't just want to \"enable root login?\", but run my GUI from bottom-up as root. I don't want to type my password for anything but just for login and have total control over it.\nOf course, I want any application running as root, like Firefox, LibreOffice, etc. without having to mess up with the terminal. So, how do I do this?\n\nThis question tries to address users that do not like the current permission system with root being separated from normal users. I do not endorse such behaviors, but if a user wants to, for whatever reason, this question should fit their corncerns.\n\nNot advisable for new users\n\nA: Read this before doing anything Why is it bad to log in as root?\nFirst of all, you must set root 's password.\nsudo passwd root\nEnter new UNIX password:\n\nNow you have root password. Now activate the root account:\nsudo usermod -U root\n\nThen you should allow lightdm, gdm or kdm to allow logging in as root.\nTo enable this:\nIn GDM\nEdit /etc/gdm/custom.conf file and include AllowRoot=true.\nAdditionally, in newer versions of Ubuntu, you need to edit  /etc/pam.d/gdm-password and comment out the line containing:\nauth required pam_succeed_if.so user != root quiet_success\n\nso that it looks like this:\n#auth required pam_succeed_if.so user != root quiet_success\n\nIn KDM\nEdit either /etc/sddm.conf or create the file /etc/sddm.conf.d/uid.conf and add/change MinimumUid for MinimumUid=0. It will show all users on the system including root.\nIn LightDM\nThis procedure enables the \"Other\" menu, so you can type the username root and login. You must edit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and add greeter-show-manual-login=true. Then reboot.\nOthers session managers have other methods to accomplish this.\nAs you have noticed I gave the instructions but by any circumstance you should not run the GUI as root. Murphy's Law says that it is likely that you mess up somehow and will be annoyed starting again.\nI played around enough, how do I go back?\nTo disable root login just type:\nsudo passwd -dl root\n\nThen revert the changes on the files above.

The directory /etc/kde4/ or any /etc/kde.../ does not exist in Kubuntu. /etc/pam.d/ exists, but the file you'll be editing is named sddm, not gdm-password\nThere's no such thing as /etc/kde/... :\n\nYou'll be editing one or both of the files under /etc/sddm/. Their contents are the same and so is the edit.\nPreview of the contents in /etc/sddm/ directory:\n\n\n*\n\n*The file ./wayland-session (To enable root login if you're logging in with Wayland session in the Desktop Environment)\n\n*The file ./Xsession (To enable root login if you're logging in with Xsession in the Desktop environment. This is usually the default when you install Kubuntu and most likely what you're using).\n\n*Or you can edit both files.\n\nUsing the Terminal/console, navigate to /etc/sddm/ and open one of the files (I'll be using Xsession) by running sudo nano Xsession\n(Alternatively, you can just run sudo nano /etc/sddm/Xsession from any terminal screen).\nPreview of the nano file editor commands and navigation commands:\n\nThe file opens. Using the arrow keys, carefully navigate to near the end of the text context (like the last 3 or 4 lines) just under;\nesac\n\nAdd the following text as one line and save the file/changes (using ^X [i.e. CtrlX] and saying 'Yes/Y').\nAllowRoot=true  \n\nPreview of the file ./Xsession after editing:\n\nThe steps are the same if you chose to edit the file ./wayland-session instead.\nThe last step is to navigate to directory /etc/pam.d/ in the Tterminal and opening the file ./sddm using the command: sudo nano sddm\n(Or just run command the single command sudo nano /etc/pam.d/sddm)\nPreview of contents in the directory /etc/pam.d/ showing ./sddm:\n\nIn the opened file (./sddm), near the top (like the first 3 lines or so) we'll add the \"#\" symbol in front of the line:\nauth    required        pam_succeed_if.so user != root quiet_success\n\nThis turns it into a comment so the computer ignores that line, so it becomes:\n#auth    required        pam_succeed_if.so user != root quiet_success\n\nAgain close/save the file (with ^X/CtrlX).\nfile ./sddm before edit:\n\nfile ./sddm after edit:\n\nNow go back to the lockscreen (log out or switch user) and log in as root.\nYou may have to manually type \"root\" as username and use the root password you set earlier.\nNow you're root.\nWhen you're done, it's highly recommended to undo the file changes you made and deactivate root user password by running sudo passwd -dl root.\n", "Q: Graphical mode not working properly after installing ATI properitary drivers It's my first question here, so please don't be harsh (I know you won't, just saying). ;)\nI'm working on Ubuntu 13.10 as I updated it from 12.04 recently.

In addition, Unity is sluggish just like in this recent question Compiz at 30% of CPU on Thinkpad T420. My PC is HP Compaq NX6310 and Compiz version is 0.9.10.2. First I had error message during boot, but did find solution for that (Bug #1014289) by updating the kernel to newer 3.11.4, it did not change the CPU usage. For the CPU problem I tried solution for Bug #1221837 by adding the line MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=1.4\nin the file /etc/environment - that did not help me, so my problem seems not to be the same bug. Any suggestions on how to resolve this issue?\n\nA: The high CPU use could be due to fallback to the software renderer. You can verify whether or not you're using the software renderer by executing the following command on the command-line:\n/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p\n\nIf the result is as follows:\nNot software rendered:    no\n\nThat indicates that the software renderer is being used (nice use of a double negative there). In that case, installing the latest version of the Intel graphics drivers, as recommended in another comment, should help. However, as of November 28, Ubuntu 13.10 is not yet supported by the Installer. It appears to be one of those \"any time now\" situations. \nIn the meantime, I was able to fix the problem on my system (ThinkPad T420S) by installing the drivers via the oibaf ppa which supports Ubuntu 13.10. unity_support_test now verifies that software rendering is disabled.

You might try with wine, but do not expect all software running smoothly.\nOn the other hand, you can try free linux software for CAD and graphics. You can also check out this directory of CAD linux software.\nCheck some of the alternatives or recommendations given, for example, in the following Q&A: How to get Autocad working with Wine?, What good CAD programs are available?, Is there any Ubuntu 12.04-compatible, open-source 3D modeling software capable of creating a 2D cross-section?.\nYou can find (probably a lot) more if you do a simple search in AskUbuntu.\n\nA: No CorelDraw in linux (yet). You'll have to live with Inkscape and GIMP. No Autodesk products working in linux, with one exception. Autodesk MAYA runs great in many linuxes. MAYA is pretty close to 3dsMax, perhaps even better.

I can not figure out how to get my particular model of laptop to boot from a USB and install Ubuntu, or even allow me to try it out without installing. Please Help?\n\nA: After all, you can edit your profile to know just a little more about you, its more personal, and friendly...\nOf course, there is a lot of instruction everywhere.\nCan you follow this instructions, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick\nAt end, there is a part, with a few lines for Windows users.\nYou can use 2 apps in this post, but I recomends you the last one!\nhttp://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/\nTake care.\n\nA: Since that laptop has uefi you should read this first the procedure is different than a old bios.\n\nA: Since you're using Windows 8.x, it is fairly safe to assume that you can and should use a 64-Bit version of Ubuntu. If your computer is protected by UEFI Secure Boot, then you have no choice at all. You have to use 64-bit Ubuntu. \nIt seems to me that you might be new to Ubuntu. In that case, I recommend that you install the newest LTS (long-term support) of Ubuntu, which is 12.04LTS. You can download the iso for that here: http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04.3/ubuntu-12.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso\nIf you want the newest release, even if you have to upgrade the OS in about 8 months, you can get Ubuntu 13.10 from here: http://releases.ubuntu.com/saucy/ubuntu-13.10-desktop-amd64.iso\nNow, on the Windows-side, in order to make a USB memory stick bootable, you should download a program called Unetbootin. You can get it from here: http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/unetbootin-windows-latest.exe\nIt's quite easy to use. You'll just select the iso-file and select the USB stick and that's mostly it. \n\nA: You can download the Ubuntu 13.10 ISO file then open it with WinRAR on windows. Click on WUBI inside the RAR file to start the installation. This automatically installs the latest distro on your PC but still preserve Windows 8.1 as the default OS. After Ubuntu finishes installing and you boot it up, you will see a blue boot selection menu after your PC starts, it usually gives you 10-30 seconds to select the OS you want to use.\nSource: This is how I installed Ubuntu alongside Windows 8.\n", "Q: Bad performance of open source graphics drivers (ATI Mobility Radeon) I have a performance problem with my Mobility Radeon HD 54__ graphics card using default open source drivers.\nI'm not talking about games but non-Full HD videos. Occasionally video freezes for a short while (sound remains unaffected) and then everything is fine for another while. Sorry for my explanation but I couldn't find words to describe that behaviour.\nI cannot install proprietary drivers, because they seem to crash Ubuntu (13.10).\n\nA: AMD writes pretty crappy drivers for linux. But if you want the official drivers, and can't get them through ubuntu, go to http://support.amd.com/en-us/download , and there you can specify your video card, then they give you a download for the drivers. \n", "Q: No Sound in HTML5 and Google Chrome after update to 13.10 After upgrading to Ubuntu 13.10 I have no sound for HTML5 players in Google Chrome Browser.\nFirefox works.\nFlash Players are working.\nNo sound on Youtube when using HTML5.

Specifying which you have is a good idea, for you could have four different versions running at 855MHz.  It could also be very useful to discover which network card you have with lshw while running from the Live disc.\nHowever, standard Ubuntu will run slowly on your machine, and therefore I suggest you consider using the Lubuntu or Xubuntu variants of Ubuntu as both have a lighter desktop and thereby will run faster, but will run the same apps as stock Ubuntu. \n", "Q: Cannot install vlc in ubuntu 13.10 for some reasons I cannot instal VLC media player on my Ubuntu Gnome 13.10 32bit.

Is it something with drivers or Ubuntu?? Also, will windows recognize all of my processing power? Thanks!\n(NOTE: My cpu doesn't have intigrated graphics\n\nA: What's being reported is the dynamic clock speed. Due to dynamic frequency scaling, your clock speed should only be at 3.8GHz under heavy load. Both Ubuntu and Windows will handle this similarly.\nNote that you should be able to set your idle clock speed in the BIOS, but 1800 MHz is a perfectly reasonable setting.\n", "Q: Unable to download Ubuntu SDK I am unable to download Ubuntu SDK .

Try it:\n$ mkdir 'I have spaces'\n$ ln -s 'I have spaces' test\n$ ls -log\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 4096 Oct 31 19:19 I have spaces\nlrwxrwxrwx 1   14 Oct 31 19:19 test -> I have spaces/\n$ rm -rf $(readlink test)\n$ ls -log\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 4096 Oct 31 19:19 I have spaces\nlrwxrwxrwx 1   14 Oct 31 19:19 test -> I have spaces/\n\nand is dangerous if the directories I, have and spaces already exist.\nAdding quotes helps:\n$ rm -rf \"$(readlink test)\"\n$ ls -log\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 14 Oct 31 19:19 test -> I have spaces/\n\n(shown in read, since the symlink now points to nothing).\nYet, there's still a case where this fails. Look\n$ mkdir $'a dir with a trailing newline\\n'\n$ ln -s $'a dir with a trailing newline\\n' test\n$ ls -log\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 4096 Oct 31 19:30 a dir with a trailing newline?\nlrwxrwxrwx  1   31 Oct 31 19:30 test -> a dir with a trailing new line?\n$ rm -rf \"$(readlink test)\"\n$ ls -log\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 4096 Oct 31 19:30 a dir with a trailing newline?\nlrwxrwxrwx  1   31 Oct 31 19:30 test -> a dir with a trailing new line?\n\nWhat??????\nSo, what can I do?\nIf you're using bash, a good strategy is the following: use cd with the -P option, to cd into the directory after all links have been dereferenced. Watch the difference:\n$ cd test\n$ pwd\n/home/gniourf/lalala/test\n$ cd ..\n$ cd -P test\n$ pwd\n/home/gniourf/lalala/a dir with a trailing newline\n\n$ # Cool!\n\nType help cd for more help about the cd bash builtin. You'll read that cd has another switch, namely -L which is the one used by default.\nNow what?\nWell, the strategy could be to cd -P into the directory, and use that. The problem is that I can't delete the directory I'm in (well, in fact I could, see the bottom of this post). Try it:\n$ rm -rf .\nrm: cannot remove directory: `.'\n\nAnd sudo will not help much here.\nSo I could cd -P in that directory, and save the working directory in a variable, and then come back to where I were. That's a beautiful idea! But how do you guys \"save the current the working directory in a variable\"? how do you tell what directory you're in? I'm sure you all know the pwd command. (Oh, I actually used it 2 minutes ago). But if I do:\n$ saved_dir=$(pwd)\n\nI'll run in the same trouble because of the trailing newline. Fortunately, Bash has the variable PWD that automagically contains the working directory (with the trailing newline, if necessary).\nOk, at this point there's something I'd like to tell you. How do you, for sure, know the exact content of a variable? echo is not enough. Look:\n$ a=\"lalala    \" # with 4 trailing spaces\n$ echo \"$a\"\nlalala\n$ # :(\n\nA trick is to use this:\n$ a=\"lalala    \"\n$ echo \"'$a'\"\n'lalala    '\n$ # :)\n\nCool. But sometimes you won't be able to see everything. A good strategy is to use bash's builtin printf together with its %q modifier. Look:\n$ a=\"lalala    \"\n$ printf '%q\\n' \"$a\"\nlalala\\ \\ \\ \\ \n$ # :)\n\nApplication:\n$ cd -P test\n$ pwd\na dir with a trailing newline\n\n$ printf '%q\\n' \"$PWD\"\n$'a dir with a trailing newline\\n'\n$ # :)\n$ cd .. # let's go back where we were\n\nAmazing!\nSo, a strategy to remove this dir is the following:\n$ cd -P test\n$ saved_dir=$PWD\n$ cd -\n/home/gniourf/lalala\n$ rm -rf \"$PWD\"\n$ ls -log\nlrwxrwxrwx 1   31 Oct 31 19:30 test -> a dir with a trailing new line?\n$ # :)\n\nDone!\nNow, wait, what was that cd -? Well, this just means: go back to where I were before cding here. :)\nYou want to put this in a function? Let's go:\nrm_where_this_points_to() {\n    cd -P -- \"$1\" || { echo >&2 \"Sorry, I couldn't go where \\`$1' points to.\"; return 1; }\n    local saved_dir=$PWD\n    cd -\n    if [[ $saved_dir = $PWD ]]; then\n        echo &>2 \"Oh dear, \\`$1' points here exactly.\"\n        return 1\n    fi\n    rm -rfv -- \"$saved_dir\"\n}\n\nDone!\nNotice how I'm using -- just in case the dir starts with a hyphen, so as to not confuse cd and rm. Or,\nrm_where_this_points_to() {\n    local here=$PWD\n    cd -P -- \"$1\" || { echo >&2 \"Sorry, I couldn't go where \\`$1' points to.\"; return 1; }\n    local saved_dir=$PWD\n    cd -- \"$here\"\n    if [[ \"$saved_dir\" = \"$PWD\" ]]; then\n        echo >&2 \"Oh dear, \\`$1' points here exactly.\"\n        return 1\n    fi\n    rm -rfv -- \"$saved_dir\"\n}\n\nif you don't want to use cd - inside the function. Even better, bash has this variable OLDPWD which contains the directory you where in before the last cd (this variable is used for cd -). Then, you could use it to avoid the uses of the variables to save the locations as in (but it's a bit confusing):\nrm_where_this_points_to() {\n    cd -P -- \"$1\" || { echo >&2 \"Sorry, I couldn't go where \\`$1' points to.\"; return 1; }\n    cd -- \"$OLDPWD\"\n    # At this point, OLDPWD is the directory to remove, not the one we're in!\n    if [[ \"$OLDPWD\" = \"$PWD\" ]]; then\n        echo >&2 \"Oh dear, \\`$1' points to here exactly.\"\n        return 1\n    fi\n    rm -rfv -- \"$OLDPWD\"\n}\n\nOne side effect of this method is that it will change your directory stack (so after executing this function, cd - will not quite work as you'd like).\n\nAlright, there's one more thing I'd like to tell you. It will actually use printf with its %q modifier, and also it will use the terrible, the evil eval command. Just because it's funny. This will have the advantage of not needing to cd back. We'll call cd from a subshell. Oh, you know subshells don't you? It's the cute little thing surrounded by parentheses. When something happens in a subshell, it's not seen by the parent shell. Look:\n$ a=1\n$ echo \"$a\"\n1\n$ ( a=42 ) # <--- in a subshell!\n$ echo \"$a\"\n1\n$ # :)\n\nNow this also works with cd:\n$ pwd\n/home/gniourf/lalala\n$ ( cd ~ ; pwd )\n/home/gniourf\n$ pwd\n/home/gniourf/lalala\n$ # :)\n\nThat's why, sometimes, in scripts, you will see stuff done in subshells, just so as to not mess around with the global state. For example when messing around with IFS. It's usually considered good practice.\nBack to our thing: how are we going to get back the value of PWD while inside a subshell, since I just showed you that variables set inside a subshell can't be seen by the parent shell. That's where we'll use printf with its %q modifier:\n$ ( cd test; printf '%q' \"$PWD\" )\n$'a dir with a trailing newline\\n'\n$ # :)\n\nNow, can we put the stdout of a subshell in a variable? Sure, just prepend the subshell by a $ as:\n$ labas=$(cd test; printf '%q' \"$PWD\")\n$ echo \"$labas\"\n$'a dir with a trailing newline\\n'\n$ # :)\n\n(là-bas means over there in French).\nBut what are we going to do with this silly string? Easy, we'll use the terrible, the evil eval. Really, do never, never, ever use eval. It's bad. God kills a kitten each time you use eval. Really, believe me. Unless you exactly know what you're doing, of course. Unless you're absolutely sure your data has been sanitized. (You know Bobby Tables?). But here, it's the case. printf's modifier %q just does that for us! Then:\nrm_where_this_points_to() {\n    local labas=$( cd -P -- \"$1\" && printf '%q' \"$PWD\" )\n    [[ -z \"$labas\" ]] && { echo >&2 \"Couldn't go where \\`$1' points to.\"; return 1; }\n    if [[ \"$labas\" = \"$(printf '%q' \"$PWD\")\" ]]; then\n        echo >&2 \"Oh dear, \\`$1' points here exactly.\"\n        return 1\n    fi\n    # eval and unquoted $labas, I know what I'm doing:\n    # $labas has been sanitized and comes directly from `printf '%q'`\n    eval \"rm -rfv -- $labas\"\n}\n\nLook, there's an unquoted $labal and an eval! You should feel really weird deep inside you when you see this! (that's my case). That's why I added the comment. So that later I'll realize it's fine.\n\nThere's a caveat, though. The part that checks that we're not deleting our current directory is flawed as shown by:\n$ ln -s . wtf\n$ rm_where_this_points_to wtf\nOh dear, `wtf' points here exactly.\n$ # Good :) but look:\n$ cd wtf\n$ rm_where_this_points_to wtf\n$ # Oh, it did it! :(\n\nTo fix this, we'll need to derefence the PWD, escape it with printf '%q' and compare this with the dereferenced and escaped thing we want to delete. It'll just make the code slightly more complex:\nrm_where_this_points_to() {\n    local labas=$( cd -P -- \"$1\" && printf '%q' \"$PWD\" )\n    local ici=$( cd -P . && printf '%q' \"$PWD\" )\n    [[ -z \"$labas\" ]] && { echo >&2 \"Couldn't go where \\`$1' points to.\"; return 1; }\n    [[ -z \"$ici\" ]] && { echo >&2 \"Something really weird happened: I can't dereference the current directory.\"; return 1; }\n    if [[ \"$labas\" = \"$ici\" ]]; then\n        echo >&2 \"Oh dear, \\`$1' points here exactly.\"\n        return 1\n    fi\n    # eval and unquoted $labas, I know what I'm doing:\n    # $labas has been sanitized and comes directly from `printf '%q'`\n    eval \"rm -rfv -- $labas\"\n}\n\n(ici means here in French).\nThis is the function I would use (until I find it still has some flaws... if you find any, please let me know in the comments).\n\nI said before that a cool solution would be to cd -P to the directory I want to remove, and remove if from there using rm -rf ., but this doesn't work. Well, a really dirty method would be to rm -rf -- \"$PWD\" instead. That's horribly dirty but a lot of fun:\nrm_where_this_points_to_dirty() {\n    ( cd -P -- \"$1\" && rm -rfv -- \"$PWD\" )\n}\n\nDone!\nUse at your own risks!!!\nCheers!\n\nIn this post you might have learned one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*To use more quotes!\n\n*To use more quotes!\n\n*cd -P v.s. cd -L.\n\n*that a trailing newline can be disastrous when using command substitution, i.e., $(...).\n\n*The variables PWD and OLDPWD.\n\n*To use $'...' to have some cool effects.\n\n*printf and its %q modifier.\n\n*To use --.\n\n*Subshells.\n\n*How to say over there and here in French.\n\n*To never use eval. Never.\n\n\nA: You can use the following command:\nrm -rf $(ls -l ~/temporary | awk '{print $NF}')\n\nIf you don't want to parse ls, then you can use:\nrm -rf $(file ~/temporary | awk '{print $NF}' | tr -d \"\\`\\',\")\n\nor simple:\nrm -rf $(readlink ~/temporary)\n\nTo take care of spaces both in the name of the directory that in the name of the link, you can modify the last command as follows\nrm -rf \"$(readlink ~/\"temporary with spaces\")\"\n\n", "Q: What is the simplest way to set up a mail server? The fact is: I need to get somehow an email adress like \"admin@exampledomain.net\"\nI tried a couple of tutorials that screwed my server and i had to reset it;\nSo: How to setup it in the simplest way?\nYes, i own a server (Ubuntu 13.04 x86_64)\nYes, i also own mydomain.net\n(Given that my domain is \"exampledomain.net\", my hostname is \"exampledomain\", will this give problems? cause it gave me lots)\n\nA: Your question is subjective, so I will propose some possible solutions based on a couple assumptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are trying to learn how to manage an email server to further your education. This is assumed because if you don't know how to set one up you probably don't know the long list of reasons why you probably shouldn't run your own mail server.\n\n*You are aware of services like G Suite, which are reliable, cost efficient and robust in terms of management tools and decided they don't meet your needs even though they cost less money to run than your own server.\n\n*You understand that there are different ways to setup mail servers, and those ways come with unique pros and cons. So while some methods are simpler than others, you ultimately need to consider the pros and cons before you can choose the simplest of those options.\n\n\nMy Preferred Method\nMy preferred method is to install Webmin & Virtualmin, which provide a GUI for email server management (among many other things) once they're installed. It's well documented, well maintained, allows you to use the GUI or CLI seamlessly and without repercussion. It installs all of the necessary software to run a basic web server and does a good job of guiding even the most novice through the process.\nOthers\nThere are many other ways, such as using pre-built servers via services from providers like Digital Ocean.\nAnd on the more complex side of things, you can use services like Vagrant and the respective Vagrant Playbooks that automatically deploy and configure such systems for you. But I suspect that's well beyond what you're looking for even though it definitely simplifies the process if you're running a professional email server.\n\nA: The simplest way to setup a fully working email server in Ubuntu, using sane defaults, is to install the mail-server task. This can be done using graphical tools, but none that come with Ubuntu by default. Synaptic has a way to do it, for instance, but it will take more time and is much more complicated to explain, so I'll simplify. \n\n\n*\n\n*If you're in Ubuntu desktop, open a terminal by pressing alt+ctrl+t\n\n*Install the tasksel package by entering sudo apt-get install tasksel\n\n*Install the mail server task by entering sudo tasksel install mail-server\nYou'll be guided through the install and it should be easy to follow the instructions. You will be asked to enter the domain you wish the mail server to handle, for instance. \n", "Q: Likewise, mount after login to domain I installed Likewise on my Ubuntu machine(12.04).\nI succeed to join the computer to the domain and make Ubuntu ask me for PAM and disable guest account.\nWhat I couldn't figure out is how to make the users get their mapping drives from the server(or manually). I have tried some solutions like adding the mount command to the /etc/fstab, but because I added myself to the UBUNTU, the path is changing from users to users.\nThe bottom line is, that I am trying to write down a login script that will map the drives by Group ID(GID).\nCan someone please send me a script template or suggest another solution?\n\nA: You can add pam_mount.so to your /etc/pam.d/lightdm or /etc/pam.d/gdm or whatever display manager you use. Configure pam_mount.so in /etc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml with content for example:\n<volume options=\"nobrl,file_mode=0600,user=%(USER),uid=%(USERUID),gid=%(USERGID)\"\n        fstype=\"cifs\"\n        server=\"servername\"\n        path=\"home$/%(USER)\"\n        mountpoint=\"/home/%(USER)\">\n        <sgrp>Student</sgrp>\n</volume>\n\nIn my case it was a cifs remote filesystem, that is mounted if the user is in the group \"Student\".\nTo execute loginscripts I use pam_exec.so in the coresponding pam-file (/etc/pam.d/*), notice, they will be execute with root-priviledges.\n", "Q: What is Ubuntu's policy on keeping old kernels I've just run out of disk space on /. Looking into the situation I realised that since first installing 12.04, Ubuntu has upgraded the kernel ~23 times and has kept every old kernel, binaries and header sources.\nI've just manually apt-get purge-ed all but the last couple, saving ~4Gb space (on a 20Gb partition, so that's v. significant). Why would Ubuntu want to keep all of those? Is it lack of a feature such as \"keep last 4\" or is there some other reason?\n\nA: Ubuntu used to keep the old kernels around for safety reasons, however it should be autocleaning old kernels now. \nThe system should be auto cleaning old kernels per this bug:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/+bug/923876\nSo you might want to ensure that your system is up to date and that you have apt (0.9.7.5ubuntu5.5) installed. If you're still getting the wrong behavior then please report a bug on the apt package. \nThis is also useful if you want to clean up stuff:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I remove old kernel versions to clean up the boot menu?\nYou don't need to manually purge each kernel package, doing a sudo apt-get autoremove every once in a while  will remove kernels you don't need anymore. However finding the root cause as to why your system isn't autocleaning old kernels is probably easier. \n", "Q: Nginx: Cant see index html I use Ubuntu 13.10 + nginx (from repos), but I have one problem: I cant see in browser my local index.hmtl (with help nginx).\nInstall:\nsudo apt-get install nginx\n\nMake dirs for my static files\nsudo mkdir /opt/nginx/files && sudo mkdir /opt/nginx/img\nsudo chown www-data:www-data /opt/nginx/\n\n/opt/nginx$ ls -la \ndrwxr-xr-x 4 www-data www-data 4096 oct.  31 19:57 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 8 www-data www-data 4096 oct.  31 19:57 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root     root     4096 oct.  31 20:02 files\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 root     root     4096 oct.  31 19:57 img\n\nin /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\nuser www-data;\nworker_processes auto;\npid /run/nginx.pid;\n\nevents {\n    worker_connections 768;\n    # multi_accept on;\n}\n\nhttp {\n\n    ##\n    # Basic Settings\n    ##\n\n    sendfile on;\n    tcp_nopush on;\n    tcp_nodelay on;\n    keepalive_timeout 65;\n    types_hash_max_size 2048;\n    # server_tokens off;\n\n    # server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;\n    # server_name_in_redirect off;\n\n    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;\n    default_type application/octet-stream;\n\n    ##\n    # Logging Settings\n    ##\n\n    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;\n    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;\n\n    ##\n    # Gzip Settings\n    ##\n\n    gzip on;\n    gzip_disable \"msie6\";\n\n    gzip_vary on;\n    # gzip_proxied any;\n    gzip_comp_level 6;\n    # gzip_buffers 16 8k;\n    gzip_http_version 1.1;\n    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/x-javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;\n\n    ##\n    # nginx-naxsi config\n    ##\n    # Uncomment it if you installed nginx-naxsi\n    ##\n\n    #include /etc/nginx/naxsi_core.rules;\n\n    ##\n    # nginx-passenger config\n    ##\n    # Uncomment it if you installed nginx-passenger\n    ##\n\n    #passenger_root /usr;\n    #passenger_ruby /usr/bin/ruby;\n\n    ##\n    # Virtual Host Configs\n    ##\n\n    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;\n    include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;\n\n    server {\n                listen       80;\n                server_name  filestorange;\n                error_page   404        /404.html;\n\n                #access_log  logs/localhost.access.log  main;\n\n                location / {\n                    root   /opt/nginx/files;\n                    index  index.html;\n                }\n                location /404.html {\n                root /opt/nginx/files;\n        } \n        }\n    }   \n\nThen I use\n    sudo nginx -s reload\n    sudo service nginx restart\n\nBut in localhost in browser I see: If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and working.

I tried to reinstall over it, but the system still behaves as described above\nWhat I should do to have my dual boot working well with both Windows and Ubuntu?\nNote: Ubuntu works perfectly from the LiveCD\n\nA: First, I recommend you disable Secure Boot. Although Ubuntu theoretically supports Secure Boot, in practice it sometimes causes problems. Given the way you installed, though, this step alone won't solve your problem. I have two recommendations for how to proceed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager. You should be able to boot from it, and with any luck it will give you an option to boot Linux via an entry whose description includes the string vmlinuz. If this works, install the Debian-package version of rEFInd, which should make it your default EFI boot manager. If you can't boot to Linux from the rEFInd USB flash drive or CD-R, you may still be able to use it (see below), but try this only if the next suggestion doesn't help.\n\n*Run the Boot Repair tool from an emergency disc. This often fixes the problem, but sometimes it doesn't do any good, and on occasion it can even make matters worse. If it doesn't help, and if rEFInd also doesn't help, post the URL that Boot Repair gives you; this will give us detailed diagnostic information about your system.\n\n\nIf an EFI-mode boot is impossible, you may be able to use rEFInd to manage a switch between EFI-mode and BIOS-mode booting. You can test this with the USB flash drive version of rEFInd: Mount it and open the EFI/BOOT/refind.conf file in a text editor. Locate the line that begins #scanfor. Uncomment it (by removing the lading #) and add hdbios to the options. When you restart with rEFInd, you should see a new option with a grayscale diamond-shaped icon. This should launch your BIOS-mode version of GRUB. If this works, you can install rEFInd on the hard disk from Windows and change the disk-based version of refind.conf to get it working.\n", "Q: Output from 'ls' differs when in root mode When I use the command sudo -i and input the password, and then input ls, I found that I can only see the Desktop folder and packages in terminal. \nBut when I came back to normal mode, all the folder showed up.\nI don't know what cause this problem...Can someone help me ? \n\nA: The sudo -i command gives you a shell as root, and you will be in the root user's home directory, not your own.

I am running Vista on the C:drive (320 GB) and am using dual boot to access either Ubuntu or Vista when I boot up. I have recently purchased a Windows 8 PC (Grrr!) but under the circumstancs do not want or need the VISTA operating system on the other PC. What I would like to do is the following: \n1. Transfer all my files to the Win 8 PC\n2. Switch the 160 GB drive to be my C:drive and the 320 GB Drive to be my d:drive\n3. install Ubuntu 12 on the 'new' c: drive and use the D: drive for files and programs\nOn the original install of Ubuntu, I partitioned the 160 GB drive for U9.04 but it is all tied to dual boot and was done through WUBI. I'm sure new versions of Ubuntu will require different partitioning setups anyway.If I could I would like to just clean everything out and start from scratch. I run free programs mostly, but anything I need like printers Web Cams, Router, etc. I have software for. As far as personal data I can save everything off to external drives and reload later as needed.\nI don't know if I can just wipe both hard drives clean, then reset my BIOS to recognize the 'new' drive setup, then start installing Ubuntu. Sounds too simple!\nPlease let me know the proper approach.\nThank you\n\nA: \nI don't know if I can just wipe both hard drives clean, then reset my BIOS to recognize the 'new' drive setup, then start installing Ubuntu. Sounds too simple!\n\nYes, you can, IF your BIOS supports reordering the hard drives; mine does. \n\nWhat I would like to do is the following: 1. Transfer all my files to the Win 8 PC 2. Switch the 160 GB drive to be my C:drive and the 320 GB Drive to be my d:drive 3. install Ubuntu 12 on the 'new' c: drive and use the D: drive for files and programs\n\nWhy make the 160GB the \"C\" drive? Is it faster?\nYou can do a custom install, reconfiguring your filesystem to put /home and /opt (for somoe post-install apps) on the 320GB HD, but the apps which come with Linux will install to the first drive, and getting them to install to the second drive would require a lot of work.\n", "Q: Problem playing some youtube videos I've recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 on some friend machine. He's migrating from Windows XP, and i'm his guide.\nRight now he's having a problem with some youtube videos. \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ABNUSndcnI\nAll the videos from that yt user seems to have the same trouble. \nProblem is, when going to full screen, my friend sees this:\n\nSo i try the video here, on my job's PC, were also have Ubuntu 12.04, and see it fine.\nI ask him about the browser. Google Chrome. Ask him then to try Firefox, and says that in Firefox it works fine. I'm on Firefox too.\nWhen i try the video on Chrome here on my job, i do see it ok in fullscreen, BUT, i notice that Chrome takes a few seconds to actually maximize it. That is, it's costly for Chrome to go fullcreen. Then try another video from another youtube user in Chrome, and it goes fullscreen fine.\nSo, something's wrong with those videos.\nAs i go everywhere installing Ubuntu, and have no idea of what is going on here, i would like to learn what is happening here.\nMy friend has a nVidia GEForce 9800 GT with 319 drivers. I have an old legacy ATI here on my job. \nAny clue?\n\nA: Finally, i've solved this.\nI have no idea yet what's so special about those videos. However, by trial and error, i tested on my friend's machine some other screen resolutions, and saw that the one he was using was the only one with this problem. That resolution was 1360x768.\nSo, searching about problems with that resolution, i've found a bizarre problem regarding that resolution, some standars, and nvidia. It seems that is a bogus resolution, and there's a problem between 1360x768 and 1366x768. nVidia gpus seems to detect 1360 but no 1366. So, i went to nvidia settings (not Ubuntu control center), and setted the resolution by hand at 1366 using \"advanced\" option in the resolution configuration. After that, the video displays fine on my friend's machine.\nOdd stuff. \n\nA: Im working with Adobe Flash Player Version 11.2.202.310 and test it in fullscreen and Its seems works fine!\nMay be He needs change and upgrade his version.\nCould you tellme about Flash Player embed version in Chrome?\nYou can know about it, just right click in video in somewhere.\nTake care.\n\nA: if you have trouble with youtube videos, try html5 player. \nbottom of youtube page. html5 player in beta ( experiment) link.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 not booting I cannot start Ubuntu 13.10 on my laptop!

For input devices we can define a timeout before a connection will be disconnected.

Why not just create a new service with relation to the master node?\nMySQL doesn't support multi-master node so adding units to one MySQL service doesn't make any sense. If I create a second service as a slave and add units to that to act as multiple slaves still doesn't make sense because if the primary slave server dies all the unites attached to it become useless as well.\nCan anyone explain why I should add units to MySQL?\n\nA: I will give it a try:\n\nMySQL doesn't support multi-master node so adding units to one MySQL\n  service doesn't make any sense.\n\nThat MySQL Community Server doesn't support multi-master node is correct. For multi-master node setup will you need MySQL Cluster or a fork. I can also confirm that at time of writing this answer did it not exist a Juju Charm for MySQL Cluster. But MySQL Community Serversupports other high-available opportunities thorough its replication. One of the most obvious one is Switching Masters During Failover.\nIf you have a closer look on the implementation of the MySQL Charm can we see under hooks\\ha* something I might think is a switch of master. Tho, i have not dived so deep that I can confirm it is that.\n\nWhy not just create a new service with relation to the master node?\n\nOn the first hand, if we keep the master switch in mind from the answer above, does it make sense to add units to the master MySQL Charm as it will give it a pool of replicas that could be switched to become new Masters on a failure. On the other hand, defining a new service as slave and give it a relation to the master will make them stay as slaves.\n\nif the primary slave server dies all the unites attached to it become useless as well\n\nThat is not exactly correct, as the slave servers will gladly be serving read requests. The MySQL replicas can also be 'forced' to serve write/update requests but that is strictly advise against as it comes with major complications for keeping semantics.\nAccording to answer of this question, by a \nDimiter Naydenov a member of Canonical Juju-core, is adding of more units to the MySQL Charm not creating replication slaves. \nIf the extra units nodes should be able to be promoted, to new master would that behavior be needed. So my best guess then, if his answer still hold ground, is that it is wasted units serving the purpose of inviting people to contribute on it.\nA project that you might find of interest or inspiring, could be this one.\nImprovements and corrections are welcomed.\n", "Q: Having trouble installing guest additions for a Xubuntu 13.10 guest OS in Virtualbox 4.2.10 I am using Ubuntu 13.04 64-BIT as my host operating system running Virtual Box 4.2.10.

I had hibernated my laptop using\nsudo pm-hibernate\n\nand then woke it up some hours later to quickly check a document. I re-entered the above command and it worked without requiring a password.

Is there a way to enforce the timeout to not carry over like this while the system is in hibernation?\n\nA: Run the command using the -k option:\nsudo -k pm-hibernate\n\nShort version: -k means sudo will prompt for the password again next time.\nFrom man sudo:\n-k [command]\nWhen used alone, the -k (kill) option to sudo invalidates the user's cached credentials. The next time sudo is run a password will be required. This option does not require a password and was added to allow a user to revoke sudo permissions from a .logout file. Not all security policies support credential caching.\n\nWhen used in conjunction with a command or an option that may require a password, the -k option will cause sudo to ignore the user's cached credentials. As a result, sudo will prompt for a password (if one is required by the security policy) and will not update the user's cached credentials. \n\n", "Q: What causes Ubuntu to become randomly laggy and not fix until I restart?

I am using the Tor bundle and its included browser to initiate torrent downloads with the Transmission client included with Lubuntu.\nClicking on a torrent link provides a warning message that external apps are NOT protected by Tor and clicking ok results in normal Transmission start and it begins the download.\nI have seen assertions in another post answer that Tor starts Transmission using a different profile than the normal $HOME/.config/transmission. However, I see no evidence of the referenced different profile on my system ( $HOME/tor-browser_en-US/.config/transmission). The normal privacy settings provided within Transmission seem inadequate for privacy according to what I have read. Has something changed in how Tor bundle browser (firefox) interacts with supporting apps like Transmission. Tor bundle otherwise seems to be operating correctly. I asked the question in the post but it was deleted by moderator for some reason not given\n\nA: TOR was not invented for file sharing applications like BitTorrent. (That may be why your question was deleted or because you already answered your question yourself when linking to the other question.)\nIf you want to protect your privacy when using BitTorrent use a VPN provider that provides BitTorrent support and configure your client accordingly, or use one of the less popular file sharing applications and clients that try to work around privacy concerns of public file sharing (see non-public file sharing).\n", "Q: Add/remove keyboard layout by console command After upgrading to 13.10 it looks like we have no more deal with XKB for layout settings and input language switching, so I have a question.\nSome times I need to add one ore two more input languages and remove them after little time.

(It would appear that from screenshots, BootRepair can create a seperate /boot for partition, however, the question arises, can BootRepair facilitate creation of a fresh /boot?)\n\n*What steps does one need to perform link the /boot to the cloned partition\n\n*What steps does one need to perform to add the newly cloned Ubuntu to grub2?\n\n*Is there an automated way to install grub2 to replace the windows bootloader, including performing the steps specified here: http://www.wensley.org.uk/gpt\n6. Is there a script to perform the above in an automated way with presumably the input being (cloned /, /boot and unallocated space) and the output being as specified?\n\n\n*\n\n*Is #6 reasonable doable as provided by the current APIs of BootRepair and clonezilla? Ie, perhaps I don't want to implement grub2 installation\n\n\nThe reason I ask #5 is because:\n\n\n*\n\n*I installed Ubuntu (/boot, swap, os) on unallocated space on a UEFI GPT windows system. However, it did not (appear to) install grub and switching between OS is performed by specifying the boot order in BIOS.\n\n*It is specified as a general instruction in the wiki to run BootRepair to presumably facilitate a fix to this but it is not explicitly specified if that is the problem at which the instructions are aimed at (ie the language is, running BootRepair solves most issues)\n\n*So does BootRepair perform #5 in a complete manner?\n\n*It is further specified in various instructions to boot relevant live cds with UEFI. In my bios, the boot order is specified by simply hitting enter on the menu phrase \"UEFI Boot\". Presumably, media booted in said boot order is booted with UEFI. Please confirm this is what the instruction specifies. \n\n\nA: I don't have a complete answer; however, before you proceed, I recommend you read up on EFI-mode booting. Some specific sites that should be of use to you include:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\n\n*http://www.rodsbooks.com/linux-uefi/\n\n*http://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/\nIn brief, on an EFI-based system, you do not install anything in the MBR; instead, you install a Linux EFI boot loader or boot manager in the EFI System Partition (ESP) and set it as the EFI's default boot program using a tool such as efibootmgr (in Linux), bcfg (in an EFI shell), bcdedit (in Windows), or the EFI's own user interface. See the rEFInd documentation on manual installation for the basics of most of these methods; but you may need to modify some details for whatever boot program you choose to use. Normally an Ubuntu installer will handle this for you, but in your cloning case, you'll need to do it manually, or possibly use a tool like Boot Repair.\nGRUB is likely to be a pain to set up manually. If Boot Repair can handle it automatically, then great; but if not, I strongly recommend using something else. (See the EFI boot loader page I referenced earlier for a rundown of what's available.) rEFInd is likely to be relatively easy to set up, but with a separate /boot partition, you'll need to manually create a /boot/refind_linux.conf file, as described toward the end of this page.\nIt's possible you'll need to generate a new initial RAM disk (initrd) file. I don't have any references on how to do this when cloning an Ubuntu system, unfortunately.\n", "Q: Xubuntu 13.10 And Ubuntu 13.10 both show WPA Supplicant error? Why am I getting this error.

So, my younger brother wanted my help today. Apparently, he was helping a friend install Ubuntu to his laptop, and midway through the install (on a filled hard-drive with Windows 8, from the liveusb thing):\n1) They realized that they had chosen \"Erase and install\" accidentally and decided the best course of action was to (in the middle of an install, remember)\n2) Force shutdown the computer.\nAfter I had replaced my eyeballs back into their sockets, my bro asked if I could do anything about his friend's data, which he wanted back. This, however, drifts out of my normal comfort zone. I know this about the install:\n1) It was on a fairly new Windows 8 laptop, so it had whatever filesystem it uses nowadays on the entire drive\n2) They didn't choose the \"zero out drive data\" option\n3) They stopped the install at some point (not sure if before or after wipe)\nI can imagine that it now has two corrupted filesystems on it (whatever Windows 8 was on and ext3) and that some of the data still exists (assuming it wasn't overwritten already). Is there anything that can be done for whatever data is left on the drive?\n\nA: Boot Ubuntu from a live CD, then sudo apt-get install testdisk.

Trying to start chrome yields in following error on the command line:\n/opt/google/chrome/chrome: error while loading shared libraries: libudev.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nThe error first appeared in Ubuntu 13.04, I tried purging and reinstalling Chrome. It persisted after upgrading to Ubuntu 13.10.\n\nA: As Gilles pointed out, this approach can lead to unwanted behaviour. Please try his solution first. If it doesn't work for you and you understand the implication that this may lead to silent data corruption, you may do the following:\nAssuming a 64-bit system, the missing symlink can be created via:\nsudo ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libudev.so.1.3.5 /usr/lib/libudev.so.0\n\nFor Ubuntu 18:\nsudo ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libudev.so.1.6.9 /usr/lib/libudev.so.0\n\nFor a 32-bit system:\nsudo ln -s /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libudev.so.1.3.5  /usr/lib/libudev.so.0\n\nYou may have to check your local version of libudev.\n\nA: If Chrome doesn't start after an Ubuntu upgrade from ≤12.10 to ≥13.04, open a terminal and run the following command:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure google-chrome-stable\n\nExplanations follow.\n\nAt least for Chrome versions form 28 to 37, the Chrome binary can use whichever of libudev.so.0 or libudev.so.1 is present on the system. With the fix to Chromium/Chrome Issue 226002 (which went into the unstable channel in April 2013), the installer determines which one to use. The binary references libudev.so.0; the installer creates a symbolic link from /opt/google/chrome/libudev.so.0 to the libudev.so.1 on the system if libudev.so.0 is not found.\nNote that it would be a bad idea to create one in /usr/lib. Major version numbers in libraries change when the newer version is incompatible. Creating this symbolic link works well for Chrome because it only uses features that are compatible between version 0 and version 1. Other applications might crash or produce corrupt data if you force them to run with the wrong version.\nThe method used by the Chrome package works well under most circumstances, but it's still a dirty hack, and it has a limitation. If the libudev0 package is uninstalled after Chrome is installed, which is likely to happen when you upgrade Ubuntu, then Chrome will still be set up to use libudev.so.0 but the file won't be available anymore. To fix this, cause the installation script to run again, and this time detect that libudev.so.0 is not available so it should create the symbolic link to use libudev.so.1 instead. You can re-run the installation script by running dpkg-reconfigure google-chrome-stable as root.\n", "Q: Low Disk Space message, but disk usage says 377GB available Ubuntu keeps popping up with a low disk space message\nBut when I click examine, it shows that I have 377GB available.\nI'm running a dual boot Ubuntu 12.04/Windows 7 machine.

I ask because I just installed Blender 2.69 and it constantly crashes on me; I then decided to just install 2.68a but found that it is IMPOSSIBLE to install an older version of software using the Ubuntu software center. \nI turned to possibly seeing if the PPA retained an older version but have found most PPA's remove older versions as they are designed to only offer the latest. How does this sound like a good idea? What if, for example, someone releases a version of their software that constantly crashes and the user wishes to get an older version but because the way PPA's are designed they cannot. Sounds familiar... To add insult to injury, I was easily able to role back Internet Explorer to version 9 on a machine at work today; that is just sad.\n\nA: A PPA is what it says it is a Personal Package Archive. Its a free service provided by Launchpad for people to distribute software and updates easily.\nThis also means that everybody can create and maintain a PPA. This could be\n\n\n*\n\n*Private users who want their additional software packages accessible all in one place.\n\n*Developers who want to distribute their software when it is not yet in the official repositories.\n\n*Developers who want people to have access to their alpha or beta releases for testing.\n\n*Institutions who want to maintain related software collections.\n\n*Enthusiasts who want to share everything they like.\n\n\n\nIt could be even you to create and maintain a PPA. \n\nWhich software version, and what Ubunutu release version will be supported is entirely up to the maintainers of a PPA. The only restriction there is is that the software needs to build on a supported Ubuntu release before we can upload it to our PPA.\nTherefore we always will have \n\n  \n*\n  \n*PPAs that contain software versions identical to those in the repositories.\n  \n*PPAs with newer stable versions build for older releases.\n  \n*PPAs with supposedly stable recent sub-versions not otherwise published.\n  \n*PPAs with bleeding edge unstable application releases.\n  \n*PPAs with entirely untested or brand new software.\n  \n\nOften we will find several PPAs for both, stable, and unstable releases of a software. It is our own responsibility to choose the appropriate PPA. It is expected that we will suffer from bugs in the unstable testing or development releases of a software.\nIRIE Shinsuke, the maintainer of the Blender PPA also provides a variety of other PPAs. In the Blender PPA we will at present also find an older version (2.4.). This may change any time if the maintainer decides to do so.\nIf you need an interim version to run you may have to download and compile this version by yourself.\nOften but not always we will have some information on the contents of a PPA from their description on the PPAs page on Launchpad. For the Blender PPA it says e.g.:\n\nBlender 2.6 package is (mostly) weekly trunk build. The build may be brought forward or be postponed when the trunk has some serious problem.\n\n\nA: That's the way Debian APT repository list system work. If you install Ubuntu 13.04 now, the package list won't offer you the entire list of package versions:\napt-cache policy linux-generic\nlinux-generic:\n  Installed: 3.8.0.32.50\n  Candidate: 3.8.0.32.50\n  Version table:\n *** 3.8.0.32.50 0\n        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring-updates/main amd64 Packages\n        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring-security/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     3.8.0.19.35 0\n        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ raring/main amd64 Packages\n\nAs you can see, my list jumps from 3.8.0.19.35 to 3.8.0.32.50, that is 23 minor versions of difference. If I had updated my package list since raring was released, I could assure you that more package versions would have shown.\nBTW, PPA's are never \"stable\" to be meant for production, if you need something \"stable\" go for the main repositories. Unless you have a strong reason to use the PPA just stay away of it.\n", "Q: How to disable tap to click in Lubuntu 13.10 Tap to click is usually the first thing I disable when I have installed a new OS, but this time I couldn't get rid of it. In earlier versions of Lubuntu, I was able to disable it by writing @synclient MaxTapTime=0 to /etc/xdg/lxsession/Lubuntu/autostart and save. But in Lubuntu 13.10 this method doesn't work any more. I can't find any solution on the internet either.\n(If there was a checkbox in \"mouse and keyboard\" preferences in LXDE to turn tap to click on/off permanently, like in Unity, that would make both lovers and haters of this divisive feature happy. I don't understand how this feature could be thought of as something everybody wants.)\n\nA: Click on the Menu icon in your panel.\nChoose Preferences in the dropdown and then choose Customize default applications for LXSession. This is a new feature in Lubuntu 13.10. There's no documentation that I know of as yet. \nA screen will open as shown below:  \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Autostart tab. You should see something like what is shown in the image.  \n\n*Ensure that config-only appears next to Disable autostarted applications.  \n\n*Under Manual autostarted applications and next to + Add, type in synclient MaxTapTime=0 \n\n*Close the Customize default applications for LXSession window.\n\n*Just to check, open ~/.config/lxsession/Lubuntu/autostart. You should see a line with synclient MaxTapTime=0. There's no need to do anything. Just close the file. \n\n*Log out.\n\n*Log in.  \n\n\nTap to click should be disabled now.

When I remove earphones, I hear a crack in the laptop speakers which is quite loud. If I mute the sound, the crack is audible, but at a lower level.\nIs there a simple way to diagnose and solve this problem ? The sound seems to be fully functional aside from that.\n\nA: That \"crack sound\" you hear is when you plug off the connector is the contact in the plug socket, that bridges the gap between the left and the right audio signal (for a really short time). This ends in some kind of back coupling of the signal: the weird crack sound.\nSo this cannot be avoided through software, because it's a hardware related idiosyncrasy of the jack connector.\n\n\nA: Problem disappear, and I do not know why. Maybe because of a kernel update, or because I installed something particular.\n", "Q: Grub2 cannot detect Windows 8 At installation it did not detect Windows. I mounted the Windows partition and have run os-prober with no results returning.\nI am able to boot Windows or Ubuntu by specifying the partition in UEFI boot order. The bios does not appear to allow booting with legacy. SecureBoot is on. \nThis is with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on a Inspiron 15. \nHere is the gdisk:\n   1            2048         1026047   500.0 MiB   EF00  EFI system partition\n   2         1026048         1107967   40.0 MiB    FFFF  Basic data partition\n   3         1107968         1370111   128.0 MiB   0C01  Microsoft reserved part\n   4         1370112         2394111   500.0 MiB   2700  Basic data partition\n   5         2394112       544743423   258.6 GiB   0700  Basic data partition\n   6       606183424       625140399   9.0 GiB     2700  Microsoft recovery part\n   7       544743424       545230847   238.0 MiB   0700  (/boot)\n   8       545230848       556949503   5.6 GiB     8200  (swap)\n   9       556949504       606181375   23.5 GiB    0700  (/)\n\nWhen installing ubuntu, I believe I specified that the bootloader be installed on /dev/sda. \nI added the following to /etc/grub.d/40_custom but booting ubuntu did not offer a grub menu:\nmenuentry \"Windows 8\" {\nset root = \"(hd0,4)\"\n\n  chainloader +1\n\n  }\n\nWhen booting I think I see \"EFI Disk error\" flash very quickly before Ubuntu starts booting. \n\nA: First, try disabling Secure Boot. Although Ubuntu theoretically supports Secure Boot, there are still a lot of problem reports concerning Secure Boot, particularly in dual-boot configurations. I think it's unlikely that disabling Secure Boot will immediately solve your problems, but it will make it more likely that any given thing you try to fix your problem will succeed.\nSecond, there are a number of things you can try to fix your boot problem, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install my rEFInd boot manager. Note that there are USB flash drive and CD-R images you can try before trying the whole thing; however, they won't boot your Linux kernels directly unless you hit F2 or Insert twice and add ro root=/dev/sda9. If you install the Debian package, you should no longer need to do this. The USB/CD-R images should also boot both Windows and Linux via GRUB successfully.\n\n*Run the Boot Repair tool. This program can fix a lot of boot problems, although it does sometimes fail, and on rare occasion it can actually make matters worse by rendering Ubuntu unbootable.\n\n*Create a proper /etc/grub.d/40_custom entry for Windows. The one in your original question might work on a BIOS-based system, but under EFI, it will fail. You'd want something that looks more like this:\n\n\n.\nmenuentry \"Windows\" {\n    insmod part_gpt\n    insmod chain\n    set root='(hd0,gpt1)'\n    chainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nNote that this exact 40_custom entry doesn't always work; you may need to tweak it for your system. (What works on one computer often fails miserably on another.)\n\nA: You might take the execute permission completely off the /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober, because even if it doesn't find anything, it sets the timeout to 0, so no grub screen seen.  Next, fix the chainloader command, the +1 is for an msdos partition disk, and you have a gpt partition disk, so it should look like:\nchainloader (${root})/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n\nThe update-grub will create a new grub.cfg file, but it puts in into /boot/grub.  You either need to copy it to /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu, or ensure the grub.cfg file in ...ubuntu is just a stub which pulls in the one in /boot/grub (I think the later releases do this by default, but 12.04 may not.)\nEven with the fixed chainloader, Windows may still not successfully boot (bug 1091464), so you may still have to boot Windows as the default or via the UEFI boot menu, like you do now.\nMake sure the boot flag is set on the EFI parition.  The bootloader location really is /EFI/ubuntu in the efi parition, even with just the disk selection.  The files there should be shim.efi, grubx64.efi (the signed version), grub.cfg  (and maybe gcdx64.efi).  They must be right for you to successfully boot with secure boot on from the UEFI menu.\n", "Q: Install ubuntu goes blank hp envy m7 touchsmart When installing from the cd it gives the option to try ubuntu or install.

Mozilla pushed back implementing Australis until next year! http://www.ghacks.net/2013/10/24/firefoxs-australis-design-wont-ship-march-2014/\n\nA: If you want a version different than offered then you should apt-get remove Ubuntu's Firefox and install Firefox ESR yourself, directly from mozilla, outside the package manager. There is no deb package yet for Ubuntu Firefox ESR. If Ubuntu still bothers you about Firefox updates then you need to apt-get remove more stuff.\nTo install just tar xjf the archive you downloaded, mv and ln -s as you desire (I suggest moving it to /opt/firefox24).\nYou must run this Firefox install as root to get updates for it. These updates will come directly from mozilla on the ESR channel. If you casually run sudo firefox then root will write into your default profile folder, making it unusable for your regular user until you chown/chmod it back. So make a separate profile for updates with firefox -P.\n\nA: I learned that the dreaded UI changes were delayed, and I was able to keep my system fully up to date through Firefox 28.\nBut now with the advent of Australis in Firefox 29, I had to find a simple answer to my question, and it is:\n        sudo apt-mark hold firefox firefox-locale-en\nIssuing that command from the terminal causes UBUNTU to maintain the current version of Firefox, while continuing the automatic updates for everything else.

It seems that modifications to my /etc/ssh/sshd_config file are not picked up by the SSH daemon.

But I still can ssh from remote.\nHow can I check that the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file gets read by sshd?\n\nA: If I am not sure if a program reads a specific config file (or in which order), I try to trace the open syscalls with strace. To do this stop the ssh daemon. Then start it manually in the terminal by:\nstrace -e open -ostrace.out /usr/sbin/sshd\n\nAfter it has started you should have a file in your current working directory called strace.out.

GPU acceleration is working fine, e.g. for Portal.\nDoes anyone know how to fix this?\n\nA: If You Must Use Flash\nGenerally speaking, my understanding is that Adobe no longer supports flash in Linux - but that the Google Chrome project has decided to integrate and support flash on their own.  So Google Chrome would be the only browser that you can use at the moment out of the box, so to speak.\nI have managed to get flash to work on other browsers from a recent install on an older 32 bit machine by using a flash-sse plugin (Shockwave Flash 11.1 r102).  This build is made for chips that do not have SSE support.  I don't know what machine you are using but this is important information.\nThis was not on an Ubuntu machine but an Arch Linux box running Gnome, but you should be able to find an older version of flash or flash-sse for Ubuntu.\nWhat will happen is that the newer versions of Firefox (I have v27) will block older flash versions automatically with a security warning.  You will have to click Activate ... and then Allow ... to view flash.  Personally I prefer this as I don't like flash adverts streaming to my machine and using bandwidth.\nThe security risk, if any, can be mitigated somewhat by sending file locations to &>/dev/null, so that all data streaming in will be shredded on arrival.\n[update] I have just installed Chromium v32+ and the above setup (Shockwave Flash 11.1 r102) works for Chromium too - without the grumbling that Firefox exhibits.\nFor Ubuntu you might be able to find a Debian package that will work.  A good link to follow is https://wiki.debian.org/FlashPlayer.  It seems that Flash 11 is the last version to work on Linux.\nOtherwise Use HTML5\nAlternatively, you can enable HTML5 instead of flash on any HTML5 capable browser (especially Chromium) by following this link https://www.youtube.com/html5 and clicking Request the HTML5 Player.  From this point forward your Youtube videos and some others will play on any HTML5 capable browser, but I found on my older machine this was too resource intensive. On newer machines I don't think this will be a problem.  This is where all streaming content is headed anyway and is why Adobe Flash will be phased out in the longer term.\n\nA: Unfortunately or fortunately Shockwave stopped support of Linux, currently latest version of it is 11.02 in Linux. Firefox is developing shumway but it's far from replacing flash for the time being. The only alternative or best solution is to use pipelight. It's running flash, shockwave, silverlight and unity player through wine http://fds-team.de/cms/pipelight-installation.html\nThough your problem seems to be related to vidoe module of your hardware you can give a shot to pipelight. I have been using it for months, it's seemlessly integrated in your browsers like chrome, firefox, opera.. all works well. It's using the latest version of flash.\n", "Q: Xubuntu - Apps loading at start up Every time I log into Xubuntu, apps like Libre Office and the web browser keep opening.

A graphical application, Oli? Are you mad?\nActually Inkscape can be run from the command line to do batch operations.

I know this is a common problem with this device, and I have tried everything I can think of to fix it, including using drivers from linux-backports; compiling and installing a custom firmware (following instructions on https://wiki.debian.org/ath9k_htc#fw-free) and (as a last resort) using ndiswrapper.\nWhen using ndiswrapper, the wifi adapter is stable and operates in g mode at 54Mb/s (whilst when using the default ath9k_htc module, the adapter connects in n mode and the bit rate fluctuates constantly).

There's patched firmware here that should work with kernel 3.2.0-55.85-generic and perhaps later kernels as well.\nQuoting befinitiv\nYou find a pre-compiled firmware that uses MCS3 (26mbit/s) as an injection rate under patches/AR9271/firmware/htc_9271.fw. Copy this file to /lib/firmware and re-insert the card to use the modified firmware. If you want to compile the firmware with a different injection rate you can take look at the patch that I supplied. The easiest way is to replace the first line in the list with a copy of the wanted injection rate. Instructions for compiling the firmware for Linux are given in the firmware repo.\nAfter installing the firmware, simply re-plug the USB Adapter to use it.\nSources:\nhttps://befinitiv.wordpress.com/2015/02/22/finding-the-right-wifi-dongle-and-patching-its-kernel-driver-and-firmware/\nhttps://github.com/qca/open-ath9k-htc-firmware/blob/master/README\nEdit: As @pandalion98 points out in this comment the patch under discussion can be found here.\n", "Q: Programs \"Auto-Locking\" to launcher I upgraded from 12.04 LTS to 13.10, with do-release-upgrade, and ever since then, I have had issues with programs staying in the launcher without locking them there. Is this intended? If so, how do I shut it off?\nThanks!\n\nA: This is the default behavior when moving the icon of a running application in the launcher. I guess the assumption is that if you care about where the icon is, you want to keep it there.\nAs far as I know there is no way to turn this feature off. If I'm correct, the only way to solve the problem is to not move around the icon.\n", "Q: Dual boot with windows I installed ubuntu 13.04 in my laptop previously,before upgrading to 13.10 with liveCD.I have also windows OS which is installed in another partion.\nBut when 13.10 was being installed,my sister switched off the computer.Due to this grub was broken.It showed me that a file having extension '.mod' was missing(Sorry I cant remember properly,but the file was in /boot or somewhere).\nBelow that I saw 'grub rescue>'.So I decided to reinstall 13.10 and I was successful.\nNow 'Grub 2' menu is working properly but it shows me only two options - ubuntu and advanced options for ubuntu.Options like windows7(loader),windows vista(loader) are missing which I was able to see when using 13.04.So, now I can't boot into windows 7.\nI also ran boot repair with recommended repair,but it did not work.\nThe boot repair paste can be found at http://paste.ubuntu.com/6339275/\nAlso I want to know if there is any option to set boot entries under Grub 2 manually.\n   And sorry for the grammatical error(s) in my lines.(if any).\n\nA: Boot using a windows 7 installation disk,goto repair windows 7 and then run diagnostics.\nThe 'boot repair' option might work,or run command prompt from the installation disk and run these two commands ->\n\nbootrec /fixmbr\nbootrec /fixboot\n\nThe problem caused here is that your new installation override the mbr as it cannot recognize any other installation,it just displays the ubuntu boot option.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Ubuntu live cd wont boot from OLD machine i trying to install ubuntu 12.04.3 on a (not super old) old laptop.

It would really be appreciative.\nThanks a lot in advance.  \n\nA: It seems that I got the correct answer, and in retrospect it may look silly why didn't I tried that. \nAnswer to above problem is :\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Network Connection  by clicking window button(or super which ever works) search for Network Connection open it.\n\n*Look for DSL tab at top right and click it. Choose the option add then again under DSL fill in the required detail about username and password provided by your ISP/ Before you do it please ask your ISP to reset the MAC filtering or ask him to add the one you are configuring(in my case I asked them to reset but they did not do it first time so one again when I tried on ubuntu I asked them to reset and this time it worked ).\nCheers!!!

How can I make my Mac OS partition smaller (just enough to keep iTunes + my 80gb of music + a little room to keep adding music) and dedicate the new free/unallocated space to my Ubuntu os? I am sure that you would use gpartition to do this, but I have NO IDEA how to do it. Nor do I want to do a fresh install, because it took a while to figure out which drivers I needed to get the Nvidia drivers to work; I have already set up my Ubuntu 12.04 and like my setup. Does anyone have a iPhone and manage the music successfully using Ubuntu?\nHopefully someone on here can help! Thanks!\n\nA: Boot a LiveUSB, use GParted to decrease the size of you Mac OS X partition and increase your Ubuntu partition. \nHere is a guide on resizing.\n\nA: Novine is correct in general; however, I want to point out one possible pitfall: If you've installed Linux to boot in BIOS mode via Boot Camp, resizing with GParted will cause the hybrid MBR to be replaced with a standard protective MBR. This in turn will cause the Mac's firmware to refuse to boot anything in BIOS mode. IMHO, the best long-term solution is to do away with the hybrid MBR and switch to EFI-mode booting. I've got a Web page describing this configuration, but it's a bit old and describes a lot of stuff you've already done. You basically just need to install rEFInd and an EFI filesystem driver for whatever filesystem holds your Linux kernel, and maybe a /boot/refind_linux.conf file. Alternatively, you can regenerate the hybrid MBR with gdisk (in OS X or Linux) or gptsync (launched from rEFIt or rEFInd).\n", "Q: reset or completely remove an installation/htop I usually use htop in tty when I need to kill a program... or whatever hangs or slows down my pc,now I screwed it up.\nI tried making changes in htop from the 'setup' option which is accessed by pressing F2 key,and by mistake filled the screen and now I can't see a single process and can't even delete the widget or the process viewer(whatever it is called) from the screen as my screen is filled and can't see any options to delete them.![This is how my screen looks now in fullscreen terminal window,can't be scrolled so can't view other options to delete them][1]\nHere's the screenshot : http://postimg.org/image/ez8k1f8c3/\nI've tried sudo apt-get remove --purge htop\nand sudo apt-get remove htop\nalso 'completely remove' from synaptic manager,but no success as the settings remain on the pc even after removing the package.\nAny way by which I could re-install it by completely removing it's whole settings or options by which I could remove those widgets off screen?\n\nA: htop stores its settings under ~/.config/.

I'm in the middle of doing an upgrade on a really slow machine. It's an Intel Atom that's a few years old. It's perfect for watching video and using XBMC but it really honks at decompressing hundreds of updates (like you do in a release upgrade). I've got another upgrade to do on this once this one completes.\nI mused to the General Chat room today that it would be cool if I could proxy those package downloads through a faster local server that could proxy the requests, decompress the packages and pass them on.\nSo still in planning, I have a few questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is is possible to have a deb package that isn't compressed?\n\n*How can I remove the compression from a deb?\n\n*Will removing the compression knacker the checksums and if so, how do I fix that?\n\n\nA: 1) Not really, no. You can theoretically use the lowest level compression at build-time of the debs, but the Ubuntu builders don't do this. The slow part is probably not the decompression, but the unpacking of files and writing them to disk. Several things can affect disk I/O times here, including BIOS settings, drive rotational speed, and drive type. You could theoretically have the data archive inside the deb be data.tar though it would still have slight compression (or inflation), and wouldn't help with the speed of writing to disk.\n2) See 1).\n3) Yes, it would, if you were to take a binary deb and replace the data.tar.gz inside it, the size, timestamp, etc… would change. To be able to do something, you'd need to do it at build time of the deb package.\nOn the other hand, as I said, the speed issue is probably writing to disk. You can check your BIOS to change some settings for the disk. If your using a SATA disk, and your BIOS is set to communicate with it as IDE/ATAPI, then read/write speed is going to be extremely slow. Change the setting to AHCI if avaialble. Another common issue is disk RPM if you're not using an SSD. You didn't specify what size or RPM disk you are using, but a 2.5\" 4500-5400 RPM disk is going to be slower than a 3.5\" disk that does anywhere between 7200-15000 RPM. And a SATA I (1.5Gbps) disk is going to be slower than a SATA II (3.0 Gbps) or III (6.0 Gbps) disk. Disk cache size also plays an important role here. You also didn't say which Atom you had, or how much RAM, but they aren't as slow as one might think. They aren't a top shelf i7, but the amount of compression used in deb packages is not generally a problem for them.\n\nA: For stripping the compression here's what I've come up with (this by no means answers anything else):\nar vx debianutils_4.3.4_amd64.deb\ngunzip data.tar.gz\nar d debianutils_4.3.4_amd64.deb data.tar.gz\nar q debianutils_4.3.4_amd64.deb data.tar\n\nThe package is bigger. The checksums are completely off... But it's still a valid package, sans compression.\n", "Q: How do I make Home and End work in PuTTY SSH with fish shell?

I am curious what computer:// is, in terms of its implementation on the file system/in the nautilus executable/as a configuration provided to nautilus?\n\n\n*\n\n*Perhaps it is a configurable group (of paths) for nautilus, configurable on a user basis. \n\n\nThe reason I ask is because it is not accessible with root's nautilus. If #1 is correct, how does one create computer:// and/or how does one create such path groups?\n\nA: Your assumption is not correct. I mean the fact that this kind of special URI is not configurable on a user basis. \ncomputer:// is a special URI like is recent://, trash://, burn://, ao.\n\nThe reason those URIs exist is because Nautilus uses a virtual file system called Gnome Virtual File System (gvfs) which is built on top of another virtual file system called FUSE. Specifically those URIs are configured in the /usr/lib/gvfs/ directory named gvfsd-*. These are binary files so don't try and edit them. - via Rothgar\n\nYou can get access to these special URIs as root by using dbus:\ngksu dbus-launch nautilus computer://\n\n", "Q: Cannot install minicom on 12.0.4 LTS I cannot install minicom on 12.0.4 LTS.

These are mostly from volunteers who have donated their time to package stuff up for themselves and other users.\nMore than that, testing the software also requires that the developer has also upgraded their local install.

When I shutdown my computer there is some annoying delay, it takes about 5-10 seconds in 13.10 when in the previous version it was almost instantaneous.  \nDuring shutdown I press escape to cancel the splash screen and can see that a big part of the delay is after \"Asking all remaining process to terminate...\", and then there is \"Killing all remaining processes\".

Search for the line #report_unkillable and uncomment it (i.e. remove the # tag). Save the file.\n\n*Make sure that apport is enabled: Edit the file /etc/default/apport so it reads enabled=1. (If it was enabled=0 then reboot, so apport can start.)\n\n*Shutdown.\n\n*Upon the next boot apport should come up with a message telling you that there was some kind of problem with a program. That is the one causing the delay. And there should be a crash report in /var/crash . (If apport doesn't report the name, then just look in the crash file, in the end of the file there will be something like Title: MISBEHAVING_PROGRAMNAME does not terminate at computer shutdown)\n\nA: Have you tried this? Open terminal and type\nsudo shutdown now\n\nThis might help.\n\nA: Is the shutdown always slow or can it vary? If the latter is the case, what did you do before shutting down? Did you do something that took a lot of disk-writes that perhaps need to end first before all processes can be terminated?\nyou could save a list of all processes before shutting down as per:\nps -A > processes.txt \nbefore you shutdown.\nYou could take a look at any errors that might have occurred after restart as per:\ndmesg |tail\nHope this helps\nFrank\n", "Q: Possibly to boot an already installed Ubuntu into windows? This may be answered elsewhere but most of the questions seem to concern a normal dual boot scenario. \nI have a standard windows 8/ubuntu 13.10 dual boot, I'm wondering if I can boot Ubuntu from inside Windows using a VM. I know I could install VM with Ubuntu on it, but since I already have ubuntu installed I'm wondering if it can simply boot that partition for me.\n\nA: You can boot physical partitions with virtual machines, but it is generally ill advised.\nWindows does not like to boot in a vitrual machine this way and will see booting in a virtual machine as a significant change in hard ware.  You can make changes to the system files with mixed results.\nLinux will boot using a raw partition or LVM fairly easily. It sort of makes managing partitions more difficult as gparted or similar tools can not manage the partition used by the machine.\nWithout getting overly technical, using a physical partition is possible, but requires a moderate amount of manual configuration.\nThere is little to no benefit beyond perhaps saving some disk space.\nIf you are interested, google search for the technical details.\nhttp://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch09.html#idp57532640\n\nWarning\nRaw hard disk access is for expert users only.

There is no reason for anyone to be using it.  0.22.0 is out, and there aren't any dependencies on newer software which should cause problems (IIRC our only real dependency is on glib >= 2.18 and I don't think that is any different than vala-0.15), so you should probably be using it.\nIf, for some reason, you need an older version of Vala then you should use a stable release.  If you can't build it post a complete log.  Also, running the unit tests aren't a requirement for installation.  If the problem only manifests itself when trying to run the unit tests, don't run them.  Nobody is going to bother backporting fixes to 0.15 or 0.16, so there isn't really much of a point.\n", "Q: Relinux No default or ui configuration problem I installed ubuntu 12.04 and make some customization.

I am using a friend keyboard currently and I want to know how to get the onscreen keyboard to appear on the login screen so I can use my laptop anywhere.\n\nA: Just click on Virtual Keyboard in the Universal Access indicator from the top-right of your screen: \n\n\nA: Lubuntu does not come with a screen keyboard installed, nor is the option enabled on the log-in screen by default or even after installing a virtual keyboard.\nSo first, install a screen keyboard. I recommend Onboard, the default in Ubuntu. Open a Terminal window and enter:\nsudo apt-get install onboard\n\nType your password and hit enter. When that's done processing, you need to enable it on the login screen. A simple matter of editing a config file to tell it you have a keyboard that it can use. Enter the following in your Terminal window:\nIn Lubuntu 14.04:\nsudo leafpad /etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf\n\nIn Lubuntu 15.10:\nsudo leafpad /etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf.d/30_lubuntu.conf\n\nYou can substitute \"leafpad\" (the default text editor in Lubuntu) with the editor of your choice. Scroll to the bottom and you should see a line like:\n#keyboard=\n\nYou just have to specify onboard and then un-comment the line by removing the hash symbol before \"keyboard\" like so:\nkeyboard=onboard\n\nNow save the file and close the editor. To test it, just log out. You'll be back at the login screen. Click the Universal Access icon (the little man), then On Screen Keyboard. If everything's set up right, onboard should now appear on your screen.\n\n\n\nA: To always enable the keyboard on start add the following into /etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf.d/30_lubuntu.conf\na11y-states=+keyboard\n\n", "Q: Why Ubuntu appears in boot options after I uninstall it?

To give you an idea of what this means it means you can use xdebug to profile your PHP scripts to see where they are eating up performance. Below, is how you might want to set this up.\nInstallation of xdebug\n\n\n*\n\n*Install using pecl: pecl install xdebug\n\n*Allow PHP to load the extension by adding to the php.ini or xdebug.ini (create it under php modules directory) zend_extension=\"/full/path/to/xdebug.so\"\n\n*Restart php (either through httpd or php-fpm) and check with php -m or phpinfo() to verify that xdebug is loaded.\n\n\nEnabling the Profiler\n\n\n*\n\n*xdebug.profiler_enable should be to set to 1 to start profiling.\n\n*\n\n*Cannot be enabled with ini_set(); has to be enabled in php.ini.\n\n*To selectively enable the profiler use xdebug.profiler_enable_trigger instead.\n\n\n*xdebug.profiler_output_dir is the directory where the debug file will be saved.\n\n*\n\n*Cannot be set using ini_set().\n\n\n*xdebug.profiler_enable_trigger to 1 to trigger profiler generation of files using the XDEBUG_PROFILE in GET/POST parameter to output directory.\n\n*\n\n*xdebug.profiler_output_dir can be changed to specify the output directory. The default is /tmp.\n\n*xdebug.profiler_output_name determines the name of the file that is used to dump traces into. It is by default cachegrind.out.%p (pid).\n\n*xdebug.profiler_enable to 0 in order to use this method.\n\n\n\nYou can then use KCacheGrind to read the debug output. You should hopefully be able to modify what I posted to put you in the right direction.\n\nA: I also had lots of problems in getting this to work. I wrote a small tutorial about this with the complete steps. Anyway, it boils down to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clone the two repositories if the plugins\ngit clone git://anongit.kde.org/kdev-executebrowser\ngit clone git://anongit.kde.org/kdev-xdebug\n\n*Cd into each of them, run \"cmake . && make && sudo make install\"\n\n*Add /usr/local to your KDEDIRS, if it is not already there (see here)\n\n*Run kbuildsycoca --noincremental\n\n*At this point, you should launch KDevelop, go to settings, then plugins, and you should see the two plugins just installer. \n\n*Configure the launches, as written here.\n\n", "Q: \"Property Boss\" runs into errors on Wine, is there a way to get it to work without errors?

Please see below screenshot. The spaces between letters are just messed, no matter what font or level of zoom I choose. When I change the zoom level, the spacing is actually changing but still looks very ugly.\nI have a pretty much default instalation of Ubuntu. I installed a couple of fonts (droid, mscorefonts). I did not change any font settings.\n\nFonts in other applications looks great. When I open the very same text in Google Docs or MS Web Word, it looks perfect.\nI would appreciate any help concerning this issue. Thanks!\n\nA: I answer this old thread because I experienced the same problem and I just solved it with a different method. I run Ubuntu 16.04 and LibreOffice 5.1.4.2. \nEssentially, I took the answer proposed by Fitoschido in this thread: https://ask.libreoffice.org/en/question/7127/calibri-font-not-rendering-correctly/\nIn short, one has to edit (or create) ~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf and add the following block:\n<match target=\"font\" >\n  <edit name=\"embeddedbitmap\" mode=\"assign\">\n    <bool>false</bool>\n  </edit>\n</match>\n\nThis has the effect of bypassing the bitmaps of the characters embedded in MS fonts and getting Ubuntu/Linux to apply anti-aliasing as I should. Now, MS fonts look much, much better in LibreOffice.\n\nA: This worked for me on Ubuntu 16.04 with KDE\nOpen KDE System Settings > Fonts > set Use anti-aliasing: field into Enabled > click Configure > dialog Configure Anti-Alias appears > set Sub-pixel rendering type: field into RGB > set Hinting style: field into Slight > press OK > press Apply > restart your programs (LibreOffice etc.).\nCredit goes to http://www.ubuntubuzz.com/2016/03/how-to-fix-ugly-libreoffice-font-rendering-kde.html\n\nA: If the bug is only with a single font:\nYou can find the fonts in /usr/share/fonts/truetype and edit them with any application you like.\nRemember that in the Ubuntu repository you can find alternative versions of almost any character; often, open versions are better than proprietary ones.\nIf the bug is with many fonts:\nA temporary solution is to use substitution table in character styles options to substitute the bad font with the good ones. You can also set the default fonts in the Writer options.\nAnother solution can be to tweak the characters options for the page: right click -> characters -> position -> distance. And make it fixed by disabling the default, it should be better.\nIf you can't solve, please consider of downgrading your libreoffice with Synaptics package manager (Menu -> Package -> Force version).\nHope you solve, my eyes would implode with a similar bug. :)\nEDIT: if one of the following solutions works try to tweak the font rendering configuration by editing the files in /etc/fonts/conf.d/; use sudo nano /etc/fonts/conf.d/FILENAME on a terminal to do it.\nFor example try to disable font antialiasing by editing 10-antialias.conf (replace true with false); the same for 10-hinting.conf. If nothing changes symply re-replace false with true.\nPlease note that you will disable these features for the whole system, so revert the changes if they doesn't help.\nThe last possible cause of your problem can be the graphic rendering of the driver itself. You can try to execute sudo nano /etc/libreoffice/soffice.sh and ENABLE/DISABLE the OpenGL support. Restart Libreoffice after each edit.\nIf you can't solve downgrade or use OpenOffice or an equivalent suite, for your eyes (I'm not kidding).\nI'm sorry if I wasn't of great help, but I don't know the source code of LibreOffice, I'm only trying various possibilities. :-)\nLet us know if you solve or if you discover interesting things.\n\nA: LibreOffice doesn't use anything but the freeware font engine so all MS and Monotype fonts will look bad as they are hinted or prepped for the Windows font engine.\nAlso, LibreOffice doesn't license any fonts from monotype so it's not the best solution if you create a document in Times New Roman in MS office, then open it up in LibreOffice - it will default to some random opensouce (typically poor quality) font. \n\nA: I want to share how I solved my problem with the ugly font rendering in LibreOffice. \nFirst of all, I have to point out that after a fresh OS reinstall, I usually don't install the whole office suite, but only the LibreOffice Writer. Then I open some document and the font rendering is ugly. But I noticed that when I install the whole LibreOffice suite this problem is not present - the fonts are looking fine.\nSo I concluded that the correct rendering depends on something that is excluded from the installed packages when you install the Writer only. I tried installing different packages and I found that this is the libreoffice-gtk package.\nSo, check out if it is installed on your system. I use Lubuntu 14.10 (GTK interface), so I suppose that's why this works for me.\n\nA: sudo apt-get install libreoffice-gtk3\n\n", "Q: No Tools for Kdenlive Hey guys I use kdenlive to edit videos and than upload them to youtube but recently I was exploring kdenlive, than somehow I don't know what I clicked that caused closing all the tools (like clip monitor).

I am brand new to the Ubuntu community and am already in trouble.  I recently purchased a new system76 ratel performance desktop with pre-loaded Ubuntu 13.10.  Upon first start of the system, no video output was displaying.  I turned the system off and tried again using a DVI cable and the video output came through perfectly.  However, rather than running me through the install menu, I was sent directly to the login screen.  I was never asked to create a username or password and can only log in as a guest.  How to I go back to the install 'wizard' and create a main user?  I would greatly appreciate your assistance as I am so stoked to get this thing working and my nerves are being overtaxed trying to figure this problem out.  Thank you in advance.\nAdam\n\nA: I am not sure if this will work, but you can give it a try:\nlog in under the guest account, now go to your system settings (the icon with a gear) and under System to 'User Accounts'. hit the + sign in the lower left to add a account. It should be an Administrator. Here is where it might go wrong, because I think it will ask for a password, and you probably don't have one. If not, you can add a password for the account by hitting the box next to password and than you are setup. \nIf this doesn't work and since you have nothing on your computer jet it might be easiest to reinstall Ubuntu, system 76 has instructions for that here. \n\nA: Sorry about this problem; it's caused by a bug with Ubuntu's OEM configuration and an interaction with plugging your monitor into the onboard (instead of Nvidia) ports.\nGo ahead and turn the computer off, then turn it back on. When you see the first purple screen, press the reset button on the front (the upside-down triangle). This will cause the system to reboot again. When it gets past the System76 logo, it should go to the GRUB menu. Choose \"Advanced Option for Ubuntu\", then select the first option with \"Recovery Mode\" listed in it and press enter.\nOnce the system starts up into the recovery menu, choose the Root Shell option, then enter in this command:\nmount -o remount,rw /\nNext, you can create a new user by entering this command:\nadduser name\nAnd filling out the information. Only the Full Name and Password fields are required; the rest are optional. Be sure to replace \"name\" with the username you want. \nNext enter these commands:\nadduser name adm\nadduser name sudo\nreboot\nAgain, replace \"name\" with the username you used for the first command. These will make your user an administrator, then reboot your system At this point you should be able to log in and use the System Settings panel to set up your timezone, keyboard layout, and language preferences. \n", "Q: Where or what are the instructions for installing FMOD Ex for Linux to use in g++?

How can I make Update Manager update all packages?\nUpdate-manager shows this:\n\nBut apt-get shows this:\n\nThanks!\n\nA: This appears to be part of the phasing of stable release updates that has been in place since 13.04.\n\nUsers of Ubuntu 13.04 who install updates with update-manager are automatically participating in this process.\n\nBasically, updates are released to 10% of users. Then an error report database looks for regressions or problems. If everything is ok, 6 hours later another 10% of users receive the updates. The phasing status tracker is automatically updated accordingly, and you can monitor the process there.\n\nOne can opt out of the Phased Update process by adding 'Update-Manager::Never-Include-Phased-Updates \"True\";' to the configuration file \"/etc/apt/apt.conf\".\n\nOn my system that file does not exist, so if you choose to opt-out, you may need to create it with sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf and add the needed line.\nOn Ubuntu releases 20.10 and earlier, apt-get will always show updates right away.

My client has me working on a project that I'm a little lost on in terms of any kind of sure-fire answer.\nHe uses Amazon EC2 to host his servers -- namely, he utilizes spot requests. If you've used EC2 spot requests before, you're aware that upon termination of an instance, its data is lost.\nTo solve this, he wants to attach and mount an external EBS volume. He provided a list of the directories that he wants to be persistent. He insists that I find a way to do this, but I'm nearly certain it is impossible.\nI was able to move a few of the root directories with no ill side effects (I moved them to the mounted EBS and created symbolic links pointing to the proper locations). /home is easy to move, as was /var, /usr, and a couple more. He insists, however, that /bin, /sbin, /lib, /lib64, and /etc must reside on the EBS volume.\nIt seems obvious to me that this won't work, as the EBS volume must be mounted at some point. The earliest point I'm able to mount it, as far as I know, is via /etc/fstab. If you store /etc on the external drive, then how are you going to mount it? If you can't mount it, how are you going to access /etc/fstab.... it's a paradox.\nSo, am I correct in my assumptions?

It sounds like the client doesn't understand how AMIs work.  The /bin, /sbin etc. directories won't be \"lost\" if they are baked into the AMI you launch with.\nThe right way to do it would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Build an AMI with the basic configuration that you need to run the app. \n\n*Add a script that attaches an EBS volume which has all the volatile data after bootup. If, for example, you need to have the /var partition persistent (for logs) you can make this soft link to the EBS volume.\n\n*Designate this AMI as the one to be launched for spot requests.\n\n\nYour app will, of course, have to be able to handle the fact that it can be terminated without notice at any time so it will need to have some kind of transaction checkpoints so it knows what was successfully written to the persistent EBS partition. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 on Asus EEE PC - Possible Issues?

In brief, either your partition table is damaged or there's leftover RAID data causing problems. In the first case, using FixParts can often (but not always) solve the problem. In the latter case, typing sudo dmraid -E -r /dev/sda should fix the problem -- but do this only if you're 100% positive that the disk is not legitimately configured for RAID.\n", "Q: Unable to change Brightness Ubuntu 13.04 Toshiba Satellite A105 I have a Toshiba Satellite A105 s4384 running Ubuntu 13.04 and for some reason I cannot change the brightness.\nNeither the function keys (Fn + F6/Fn + F7) nor the settings work, and it is really bothersome, as I would like to occasionally decrease the brightness (long car trips where my battery doesn't last, etc.)\nDoes anyone have any idea? Judging by the suggested questions this seems to be a rather prevalent issue, but none seem to have an answer! I had a similar problem with 12.04 LTS before I upgraded. \n\nA: Well, after quite a while BYEAskUbuntu's answer solved it for me as per his answer here: How to change LCD brightness from command line (or via script)? (scroll down to his answer.)\nI ran xrandr -q | grep \" connected\" and then xrandr --output LVDS1 --brightness [VALUE] and it worked!\nThanks to BYEAskUbuntu!\n\nA: Each time I log on I have to enter \"System Settings\" then \"Brightness and Lock\" and drag the slider over to the right.  However, this setting resets upon reboot/shutdown.\nIf you need something more permanent, try this way, copied from another post by Garry Cairns:\n\nOpen a terminal using Ctrl+Alt+t and type sudo apt-get install\n  xbacklight. That will install\n  xbacklight \n  if it isn't already there (I can't remember whether it's a default\n  package!). \nThen type xbacklight -set x replacing the x with a number between\n  1 and  99 to set the percentage brightness for your screen\n  backlight.

I'm really confused about these keywords used in Ubuntu. I've a little knowledge about suspend and hibernate in Ubuntu and how does it work. But I've no idea about what are the differences between sleep and standby. In result what are the differences between these four often used terms in Ubuntu?\nI searched in Google before asking here but didn't get any answer specific to Ubuntu.\nI'll be very happy to get a good definition, and appreciate for the time given to answer this question.\n\nA: Saurav. I am answering this under my  knowledge. Ubuntu dont have separate things suspend & sleep. When ever a Ubuntu system getting to be on suspend Ubuntu uses /etc/acpi/sleep.sh to enter/leave suspend mode. So that name indicating both suspend & sleep are calling the same script and they will have equal functionality.\nIf you want to know about what task will take care at the time of suspend/sleep means please read here : Wiki Ubuntu Community \nUsually Hibernation means we know that it will saves the current state of the system. \nOfficially \n\nWhen a computer hibernates, it will save its current state to the hard\n  disk and power down completely. When next the computer boots, the\n  prior state is restored just as you left it.\n\nFor more about Hibernation : Wiki Ubuntu Community \n\nA: What's the difference between sleep, suspend, and hibernate? \n\n\n*\n\n*Sleep (sometimes called Standby or “turn off display”) typically means that your computer and/or monitor are put into an idle, low power state. Depending on your operating system, sleep is sometimes used interchangeably with suspend (as is the case in Ubuntu based systems).  What sleep does on your system should be evaluated on a case by case basis.\n\n*Suspend saves its current state to your RAM and puts the computer and all peripherals on a low power consumption mode. If the battery runs out or the computer turns off for some reason, the current session and unsaved changes will be lost. \n\n*When a computer hibernates (sometimes called suspend to disk), it will save its current state to the hard disk and power down completely. When resuming, the saved state is restored to RAM.\n\n\nA: Hibernation stores all the necessary settings, registers, and RAM memory as a non-volatile magnetic trace to hard disk. The power can then be totally removed. {Plug withdrawn}. On restart everything is reset to how it was except the real-time. The software of some Apps may have to give special consideration to this.\nS/by - preserves low voltage power to the RAM and such other registers as will be needed to be preserved. Power to the discs is removed after they are parked. {+/-12V} The power saving is considerable typically 95%. So if your PC was running 100W normally it will consume 5W in S/by or  Sleep modes. In Hibernation mode it is (or can be) Zero.\nBjG\n", "Q: How to prevent GRUB from appearing after selecting Ubuntu from Windows' Dual Boot menu? I have Windows 7 and Ubuntu 13.10 dual-boot. I have been trying to figure out a way to make Windows boot menu the only boot menu that comes up. \nI used EasyBCD to add an option to boot into Ubuntu from the Windows boot menu, but I would like to make it so that the GRUB screen doesn't show up when I select the Ubuntu option. \nI couldn't get it to work using GRUB Customizer. Anything I can try using those two programs or anything else?\n\nA: Ok, I figured out my problem. Turns out I was clicking the \"Write MBR\" option every time I finished making changes in the GRUB Editor when all I had to do was click save so it did not overwrite the MBR but it did save my GRUB changes. Not sure what I did when editing the .cfg to make it overwrite the MBR but I'm sure it was my fault now, lol. Anyways, After using EasyBCD in Windows to add Ubuntu to the Dual Boot menu, clicking Write MBR, booting into Ubuntu and deselecting \"look for other operating systems\" and \"show menu\" in the general settings tab, and finally clicking Save (NOT Write MBR) I can avoid the GRUB menu when dual booting with Windows 7 and Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Can't connect to or search Wi-Fi I just installed the latest version of Ubuntu; I think it was 13 or something.

Is it normal for my Windows 7 partition to be completely visible from Ubuntu? When In Windows 7 it cannot see any of the Linux partition, just its own partition.\nI am a little worried something hasnt been set up correctly.\n\nA: Yes, that is normal.\nUbuntu recognizes an incredible lot of filesystems and can read them (mostly write them too).\nWindows recognizes only it's own FAT and NTFS, if we don't consider the filesystems of optical media.\nThat is the reason why Windows cannot read Ubuntu partitions, but that Ubuntu can read and write any Windows partition without any problem. There exist some projects like Ext2Fsd or zfs-win which bring partial support for some filesystems to Windows.\n\nA: It is fine. \nFrom Ubuntu you should be able to see your Windows partitions (if any).\nFrom Windows, you are not able to view Linux partitions (ext2 nor ext4) because Microsoft did not include support for these file systems.\n", "Q: Overscan issue on a CRT TV Ubuntu 12.04 I built a HTPC using an 8400gs S-Video port to display on my old RCA TV in my room.

What location to put bootloader, when running multiple drives and partition I have Win8 on my desktop, where a 120G SSD is used to run windows and some select applications, while I have a 2TB HDD to provide basic file storage and where possible, install applications instead of on the SSD.\nI want to install Ubuntu on a new partition of the HDD (I allocated 300GB, with 5GB swap file). \nI've used a USB to install the OS, which seemed to have done the job. However, after prompting for a restart, I can no longer boot to ubuntu.\nDuring instillation I was confused about where to install the \"boot loader instillation\". I ended up selecting \"/dev/stb\" because I figured I would be able to boot with BIOS by selecting the HDD drive as a priority over the SSD. \nThe bootloader is a large part of where I think I went wrong.\nMy partition system looked something like this:\n/dev/sta  ...               //SSD ~120 GB\n/dev/sta1 NTFS (350 MB)     //Win8System\n/dev/sta2 NTFS (118 GB)     //Win8C-Drive\n\n/dev/stb ...                //HDD ~2TB\n/dev/stb1 NTFS (1563 GB)    //FileStorage\n/dev/stb5 Free Space (300 GB)    //Space I want to use for Linux\n\n(NOTE: Created two partitions from the 300GB, ~5GB and 295GB. stb5,stb6.)\nIt'd be great if I could get an explanation of what drive you'd select for the boot loader and why, and what selections won't work with regards to the Boot Loader Instillation. I think I understand what Grub is, but I have no idea on how to use it, or play around with it.\nI seem to be able to get back into OS from my usb, however I believe it's just showing me a preview/trial of Ubuntu (ie, can't access any of the system NTFS drives). Note, if I try to install from the USB again, it will recognize that a version of Ubuntu 13.10 exists on the system.\nApologies in advance, have used windows all my life, don't really know to much about Linux at all. Did have a brief skim over some similar questions, didn't find anything too useful.\n - Where to install bootloader when installing Ubuntu as secondary OS?\n - ubuntu 12.10 dual boot with windows 8 on two hdds\n - Dual-boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu on two SSDs with UEFI\nEDIT: Found Solution\nTurns out, after I attempted to re-installing once more, that what was required was to create the root partition (~295GB) as a primary partition instead of the default selected Logical. It wouldn't recognize a logically formatted root partition.\nAll working now, I'm typing this from Ubuntu as we speak. (Yipeee!)\nEDIT: Clarification\nI still left the boot loader instillation specified to '/stb', and now I can use the BIOS to boot from the SSD or the HDD interchangeably. Very handy.\nI still require an explanation as to why:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using a Logical partition would not be recognised the system's BIOS (I have an ASUS H-87 Pro Mobo).\n\n*What would be different if I changed my boot loader instillation instead to '/sta'? Would I no longer directly boot into Windows, and instead use the Grub interface every time? \n\n*Is there a preferred place to install the boot loader instillation? Clarifying that specifying volumes such as '/sta1' or '/stb5' would not allow you to load the OS?\n\n\nA: While your Windows resides on sta and its partitions, it is perfectly fine to install Ubuntu on a stb partition and choose to install bootloader (which is GRUB by default) on stb. Ubuntu will otomatically find your Windows installation and add it to the bootloader menu. After this, go to your BIOS and choose the entry that corresponds to stb as the first boot option. \nWhen you boot your computer, you should first get the GRUB screen and be able to choose either Ubuntu or Windows.\n", "Q: problem with youtube to mp3 program I find in web this adress https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/saucy/youtube-to-mp3/  and there show when program is free, but in ubuntu software center i have to buy it. why?\n\nA: I'd recommend the easily usable and amazing youtube-dl.

Here is a step by step guide on how to get your example working.\n\n\n*\n\n*Type terminal in the hud (the ubuntu symbol at the top left side of your screen) and hit enter. This opens a terminal.\n\n*In the terminal type python. This opens an interactive programming shell for python.\n\n*Then type your code. You will get your output immediately. I think you are struggling with your code because you do not know what to do with the pos variable. In the following example I just type pos to get the value of pos. You could also type print pos.\nstrng = 'The time has come'\npos = strng.find('time')\npos \n\nThe sort of output you are supposed to see is\n>>> strng = 'the time has come'\n>>> pos = strng.find('time')\n>>> pos\n4\n>>> strng[4]\n't'\n>>> strng[4:]\n'time has come'\n\nIf you want to be able to run this as a file, you need to proceed as follows. \n\n\n*\n\n*In your terminal type which python.

On installing Ubuntu first through memory pen and later reinstalled by disk, by computer is really slow. You can se the process of a window closing in 10 secounds before its finished.\nI did top in terminal and saw that Compiz was taking all resources and I tried to mend that, but now think that the graphic card driver is a dead end. \nI saw later that there is something wrong in the partition and disk use.  In Gparted the whole disk is used, but not in real life(se picture)\nI am no able to resize the partitions and have no clue what to do.\nCan anybody point me in the right direction.\nthe image below shows the disk situation\n\nA: Your partition is lvm, this is why it is marked as fully used. As far as I know, GParted doesn't work to manage lvm partitions yet.\nYou need to use the lvm tools (pvs, lvs, lvdisplay, lvcreate and so on), parted in terminal (not sure if it works, as I never tried) or fdisk to work with lvm partitions.\n\nA: There's nothing wrong with your disk, and you've presented no evidence that a disk problem is causing your sluggish performance. As laurent says, GParted doesn't give you free-space estimates on LVM.\nYour speed problems are more likely being caused by Unity, which is Ubuntu's default desktop environment. Unfortunately, many newer desktop environments rely heavily on advanced GPU features, and older computers don't always have enough GPU power to keep up. Thus, you may need to switch to another desktop environment, as discussed in this question and its answers. Personally, I'd recommend LXDE or Xfce; I'd avoid Unity, GNOME 3, and KDE.\n\nA: You all are right, I have made a fresh reinstall and did not thick off on LVM. Repartitioned my disk, with no apparent perfomance result.\nI need to dig more in to the Unity lead\nThanks guys. \n", "Q: Displayport 1.2 MST/daisy chain - Dual Monitor setup - Intel graphics I am running ubuntu 13.10 on a desktop system and I have 2 monitors that I am trying to connect via Displayport's 1.2 multi-streaming support.\nThe system is equiped with an Intel Core i7-4770K processor and I'm using the displayport (1.2) output of the Intel HD Graphics 4600 to connect the computor to a Dell U2413 monitor. The second monitor (Dell U2412) is connected via a displayport 1.1 cable to the Dell U2413 monitor.\nUbuntu detects the U2413 monitor fine, but it doesn't detect the U2412 monitor. (The U2412 monitor is only recognised when I connect it directly to computor.) The daisy chain setup works fine under Windows 7 though ... Any ideas on how to get it working under ubuntu?\n\nA: MST is not implemented in Linux at this time nor is it implemented in Apple's OSX despite the fact that the hardware has supported it for several years but Apple will have it implemented sometime this year because it is required by the new 4K monitors that use DisplayPort 1.2 and Linux support will probably come around that time. The only OS that currently properly supports MST is Windows because the drivers on that platform have it implemented. Also, the 2412 monitor uses DP 1.1 which does not support MST, so you should replace the monitor with another 2413. \n\nA: David Airlie implemented MST support in the kernel and the xserver-xorg-video-intel driver.\nTo get it working on Ubuntu 14.04, you have to compile the linux kernel with his patch, as well as compile the intel X.org driver from git master.\nWith that, I got it working. My Thinkpad T440p's UltraDock has a display connected on DVI, one on DisplayPort and the laptop's own display running all at once:\n\nThe GitKernelBuild wiki page was helpful.\nDetailled build instructions can be found in my blog post.\n\nA: Good news everybody!\nYou don't have to manually build bleeding edge software any more. I have a Dell E7240 with Intel HD running dual monitors via dockstation right now.\nYou have to do either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade Ubuntu to a more recent release. 14.10/15.04+ appears to be supporting MST for Intel graphics out of the box.  \n\n*If you want to keep running the latest LTS 14.04 (Trusty), install a newer Linux kernel (3.17+) or the backports from Utopic (14.10) through the Hardware Enablement channel provided for LTS release some time after newer stable releases have happened. Several other ways exist too. For manual Xorg updates PPAs like the xorg-edgers PPA will probably work too.\n\nA: I've got a T540p notebook with docking station and Linux Mint 17 based on 14.04 LTS with 3.19 kernel and latest intel drivers together with an Asus 4k display which supports a resolution up to 3840x2160. \nIf the display is connected directly with the notebook via the mini DisplayPort connector all is working fine.\nIf the display is connected with the docking stations DisplayPort it is only detected with a max resolution up to 2560 x 1440. If 3840x2160 is selected the external display is not detected.\nThe Asus display needs two lanes for 4k support. The docking station also use several DP lanes to support the decoupling of DisplayPort and HDMI connections. Looks from a technically point of view like a DP hub (asus display) is connected with another DP hub (dock).\nIt seems to be that this special constellations (DP hub connected with another dp hub) currently aren't supported by the recent changes of the kernel and intel drivers.\n", "Q: How to add an audio file (aac or mp3) to a mp4 video file? I have an mp4 video file created from images and would like to add mp3 sound to it. I am not familiar with video editing at all, but read somewhwere that aac sound is preferred, so I got sound in aac form as well.\nThe preferred form of the result is also mp4 or flv. My Operating System is Ubuntu (Saucy Salamander).\nI have Googled a lot for avconv and mencoder trying to transform the found examples to my case without any success.\nWill you be kind enough any of you, experts, to drop me a command line example how can I do it?\n\nA: It depends a bit how your streams are mapped within the mp4 file.\nSomething like this should work:\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -i audio.aac -map 0:0 -map 1:0 -vcodec copy -acodec copy newvideo.mp4\n\nUsually the videostream is mapped as first stream in the container.\nIf it isn't mapped as first stream, change the mapping:\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -i audio.aac -map 0:1 -map 1:0 -vcodec copy -acodec copy newvideo.mp4\n\nTo find out how the streams in your video file actually were mapped in the first place you can use mediainfo which is in the standard Ubuntu repositories nowadays.\nIf we break down the commandline here it works like this:\n-i video.mp4  -> first media file\n-i audio.aac  -> second media file\n-map 0:1      -> use the second stream from the first mediafile\n-map 1:0      -> use the first stream from the second mediafile\n-vcodec copy  -> leave the video as is\n-acodec copy  -> leave the audio as is\nnewvideo      -> resulting videofile\n\nMake sure that the audiofile and the videofile have the same duration. Not every player is accepting tracks with huge duration differences.\nPlease be aware that avconv and ffmpeg are almost the same thing. In fact, this command using avconv also works like the same command using ffmpeg:\navconv -i video.mp4 -i audio.aac -map 0:0 -map 1:0 -vcodec copy -acodec copy newvideo.mp4  \n\navconv program belongs to the Libav project, a fork from the FFmpeg project. You also can safely ignore the following error message:\n*** THIS PROGRAM IS DEPRECATED ***\nThis program is only provided for compatibility and will be removed in a future release. Please use avconv instead.\n\nAn alternative for muxing files in MP4 format is MP4Box from the gpac package.\n", "Q: OpenVPN - Cannot browse ipv4 websites I have set up an openVPN tunnel on my VPS (OpenVZ - Ubuntu 12.04).\nThe problem is when I'm connected to the vpn, I can only browse websites which support ipv6 like google.

I use uefi secure boot.\n\nA: First of all, you'll need to find the device id using:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nLook for the one that's formatted as NTFS under System, and remember the device id (Should look something like /dev/sda2). Then create the mount directory and mount it.\nmkdir Windows\nsudo mount -o ro /dev/sdaX Windows\n\n(Replace X with your device id)\n\nA: I've found a way to mount a hibernated windows partition in read-only mode when any error occurs\nI hope it would work for you too. I'm describing below how to do it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open /etc/rc.local file with root privileges in any editor.\nsudo gedit /etc/rc.local\n\n\n*Now add following lines at last:\nsudo mount /dev/sda7 /media/Dane\nif [ $? -eq 14 ]\nthen\n  sudo mount -o ro /dev/sda7 /media/Dane\nfi\nexit 0\n\nIf exit 0 is already written then delete the duplicate. Be sure that /etc/sda7 is your windows partition that you're going to mount when error occurs and also there is already a directory, named Dane created in /media. If not then change /dev/sdaX accordingly and crate the directory.\n\n*Now update using following command:\nsudo update-rc.d -f /etc/rc.local\n\nI'm not sure whether this command is needed or not, but just execute it what every message it gives.\n\n*Now finally restart your system when Windows is hibernated.\nA little description:\nThe command written in file /etc/rc.local actually executes before and after system boots, thus acts as a startup. The first command in script will try to mount the partition and get the error code it returns. so $? is 14 when any error occurs. $? is 16 when partition is already mounted and trying to mount it again...\nReply if something goes wrong. I'll be waiting for your reply..\n\nA: This is my solution, it isn't the best one.\nI just add the second entry to the fstab with nobootwait option. If first entry doesn't work then second entry works and no message is reported by system. If first entry works then second entry doesn't work because of first entry. We'll see if it will work properly :D\n#/dev/sda7\nUUID=D0B43178B43161E0 /media/Dane           ntfs    defaults,nobootwait,errors=remount-ro 0        1\nUUID=D0B43178B43161E0 /media/Dane           ntfs   suid,dev,exec,auto,nouser,async,nobootwait,ro    0       2\n\n", "Q: No sound while \"listening\" to the radio Mplayer opens a link and it seems to be running smoothly.

What do I need to be aware of? How do I set up the partition structure?\nThank you in advance\n\nA: If you just want to try out the different distros I would advise to run them in a virtual machine (eg. virtualbox). you can install the os and try it out and when you don't need it just remove the machine and it is all gone. afterward you can always decide to install the distro on the hardware.\n\nA: First advice: don't use WUBI any more.\nTo set multiple Operative Systems in the same machine, you have to install them, one by one, there is no mystery here.\nAfter install all the hundreds of OS that you wanted, if you cannot boot in every one because you don't see them in a boot manager or if there is no boot manager at all, then you will need to repair it.\nThat's all.\nIn fact, there are plenty of questions here asking the same thing (how to do it? what will happen? etc.) and every one of them finish on the same subject, repairing the GRUB.\ne.g.\n\n\n*\n\n*Triple boot Win 7, Ubuntu 12.04, Fedora 16\n\n*How to set up GRUB to triple boot: Ubuntu, Windows 7 and Joli OS?\n\nTo address the part of your question about the \"Remix\" version...\nThe major difference between that and the vanilla Ubuntu it that the remix will save your Windows bootloader before it is overwritten by GRUB. \nIf you might want to make it a standard Windows install again you can just restore the bootloader file with the remix CD. If you have a Windows 7 install disc you can also use it(question here will tell you how to do it) so if you have the Windows CD or know that you will not need to restore the windows bootloader(this will make all other OS's unbootable BTW) then using the remix is really not needed but you can still use it if you want to. \nUsing the Remix will give you a Vanilla Ubuntu install plus a few other useful programs (boot-repair is one for example) but they are all available via the Software Center(or via ppa in the case of boot-repair) for install after you have installed Ubuntu.\n\nA: Well, dual booting is kind of pushing it already. You will find that over time you stop using all OSes but one.\nIf you REALLY want to have multiple OSes, VMs are the best way to go. You can install, uninstall, and trash them at will. =]\nIf you REALLY REALLY want to have more than 2 OSes that are NOT in a VM, just create a partition for each. Finally install something like GRUB or BURG.\n\nA: I did this recently.  I will endeavor to actually describe the process in some more detail than previous replies.\nThe equipment: DIY computer with Asus z170 motherboard, intel i7 quadcord CPU\ndrives: m.2 SSD, 640 gb 7200 rpm Seagate, 1 tb 7200 rpm Western Digital\nYou have to install Windows first.  I installed Windows 10 from a Microsoft thumb drive onto the m.2 SSD.\nNext I installed Ubuntu Studio from a live DVD.  I downloaded the ISO onto our iMac and burned the ISO onto a DVD using toast.\nWhen booting from live DVD, a crucial point, which may seem obvious to anyone else, but not to me, in BIOS I didn't notice at first, but I was given two different DVD boot options.  Only the second one, with \"UEFI\" in the name, would actually successfully install the darn thing, see below for why***.  My BIOS is UEFI.\nDuring this Linux install and subsequent ones, I generally do NOT select any additional options, for example, encrypt home, install third party, etc.  This seemed to hang the install.\nWhen the installer gave options to install alongside, or erase the detected OS, I choose \"Something else\" so that I could set aside hard drive space differently for each OS.  For example for Ubuntu Studio, I placed root, swap on the Seagate drive, but put home on the Western Digital Drive, which I actually partitioned into two, one for Windows and one for Linux.  The reason for this, I would be doing video editing with Ubuntu Studio, and it is considered better to keep your OS files on a different drive from your data, for better performance.\nI was generous, I gave 100 gb for the Ubuntu Studio root.\nI designed the boot loader to go onto the m.2 partition labeled UEFI, Windows Boot manager.  ***This is where you would go wrong if you didn't boot from the UEFI DVD option, because it wouldn't recognize the partition as UEFI Windows Boot manager.\nSo this was no problem.  Dual boot worked fine, other than some clock issues, which I will describe below.\nSo now, triple boot.  I used a MINT Live DVD created in a similar process as described above.  Again, select the UEFI option to boot from in BIOS.\nI put the root and swap and home all on the Seagate drive for this one, because I wasn't really concerned about performance or drive space for this particular OS.\nAgain, I selected the m.2 UEFI partition labeled Windows Boot manager for where to put the boot loader.  I have read elsewhere that it is possible to NOT install a second boot loader, but I didn't seem to have that option.  Also, it may be possible to put the second boot loader in a different partition?  IDK.  But, see below for what happened at the end of the quadruple boot****.\nThe install completed successfully and I booted into MINT no problem.  Then....\nI think I may have booted into Windows to make sure that would work.  After that the boot manager disappeared.\nSo I ran \"boot-repair\" from a CD.  At the end of the first repair attempt it mentioned creating a separate EFI partition using Gparted and to turn off Secure Boot.  So I ended up doing both of these because the first repair attempt didn't fix the boot manager.  (Actually, come to think of it, I may have used the Windows disk management to create the EFI partition.)\nSo I ran boot-repair again, advanced options, and selected the option for separate partition.  It didn't allow me to pick the new partition I created, only the original boot partition on the m.2.  But somehow this reappeared the boot manager.  But the boot manager was a total mess.  It listed like ten different boot options, some of which were redundant (\"Windows UEFI\" AND \"Windows boot manager\" on the same menu with the same function).\nSo I had a fully functional triple boot.  Getting to this point was a huge time suck frankly because it took me a while to figure out the UEFI DVD boot issue so I took some pause before I went for the quadruple boot.  But I wasn't pleased with the boot menu.  However, I felt more confident having on hand the boot repair, so went for the quadruple.\nSo I wanted to install Elementary OS because this appears to be most like the iMac OS; this would be the default OS that my fiancée could use if the iMac was unavailable to her.\nAgain, a live DVD, pick the UEFI boot DVD option from BIOS.  When it asked where to install the boot launcher I picked the Windows Boot Manager partition, not the newly created EFI partition I made earlier.\nThe install went well, and BONUS, ****the install cleaned up the boot manager list.  So something in the installer went ahead and repaired it.  Awesome.\nNow, the clock....\nApparently with multiple boot Windows and Linux, the BIOS clock will be set by the various OSes to the wrong time.  Others have brilliantly explained why this is.  The solutions vary.\n\n\n*\n\n*Pretend like you live in Iceland.  This means set your timezone to UTC+0.  If you do this, you'll want to set network time to \"off\" in Windows and Linux.  This seemed to work for dual-boot the clock was fine, but not for quadruple boot, not at all.\n\n*a solution posted by Muru.  This is a less common solution, but the only one that worked for me:\ntimedatectl | grep local\n\nThis command displays how the clock is currently set.\ntimedatectl set-local-rtc 1\n\nThis will make the clock use \"local time\".\n\n*the most common suggestion, but I couldn't get the commands to run at all.\n\n\n*\n\n*edit /etc/default/rcS\n\n*add or change the following section\n# set UTC=yes if your hardware clock is set to UTC (GMT)\nUTC-no\n\nHave fun!!!\n", "Q: VMware installed but cant open I installed the .bundle file via sudo sh VMware-Workstation-Full-9.0.2-1031769.x86_64.bundle\nhow do I open the file once I've installed it?\n\nA: See the \"Start Workstation\" chapter of the Getting Started with VMware Workstation documentation. \nThen keep reading.\nVMware Workstation is a fairly complicated system.

If you're using a \"live USB\" boot of Ubuntu, there's little reason to favor an EFI-mode boot over a BIOS-mode boot, so I'd just use the latter, which works. If you have some reason to favor an EFI-mode boot, I recommend you look into replacing GRUB on the USB drive with another boot loader. I know of no step-by-step procedure to do this with an Ubuntu live USB image, though.\n\nA: Grub EFI bootloader searches /.disk/info file to find the root filesystem of Ubuntu.\nJust create the corresponding file will be fine.\nNot sure what specification it follows though, maybe it's ubuntu-only approach.\n", "Q: Skype no sound on Kubuntu 13.10 I just performed a fresh install of Kubuntu 13.10 on my machine.

You could probably just restart the pulse audio daemon but I didn't try that.\nI find it really strange that Skype's deb package doesn't do this for you automatically.

These variables are set just in case you install Tomcat manually, using deb packages is an unnecessary step since they are already set by the init script. The reason why you don't find the variables set in your bash shell, is because they are managed internally by the user that runs tomcat. The only reason to set such variables is to tell where tomcat files are while you install tomcat manually.\n", "Q: HELP!

As you cannot create an object for an interface directly some class\n  implementing it is written and it's object is used. Manager is such a\n  class that does the thing.\nThere are several states in which a Player will be. They are\nUNREALIZED: Meaning, the player knows nothing about what it has to do (about the media)\nREALIZING: Meaning, the player is realizing it's world (determining resources) necessary to do the job (playing the file)\nREALIZED: Meaning, the player gets its resources to play the file and will also have some info about the type of the media etc.\nPREFETCHING: It's getting ready now, it is knowing how could it play the file.\nPREFETCHED: Now, it knows how to play the media. It can fire now.\nSTART: Start the music, starts playing the file.\nWe have created a realized player, it does not mean that the UNREALIZED, REALIZING steps are skipped instead they are automatically done. The method createRealizedPlayer(URL url) takes a URL which points to the media file. For getting the URL object from a File object, you can use toURL() method in the java.io.File class, as it is deprecated we've called toURI() method which returns java.net.URI object and then the toURL() method in it.The user also needs to stop the music, so input is taken from the user.\nOutput however cannot be shown, you'll have to try it, remember that when executing the program give the complete path of the audio file otherwise ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException will arise. The command might look like this:\n\njava AudioPlay \"Path/to/file.mp3\"\n\nCredit Goes to Java Demo\n", "Q: How to give USB access to VirtualBox when non-root I'm a member of vboxusers group.

After a bit of (re)search/reading I picked Ubuntu as my starting point.  \nAs I'm really a Pluralsight addict, preferring video courses as a starting point for learning new stuff, I wanted to ask if there are any decent video courses for Linux generally or Ubuntu focused ones?  \nBasically I'm searching for general explanation of OS structure, a bit of system administration, and maybe some considerations for development on Linux system.\n\nA: You may lose focus if you don't download the video tutorials so that you can watch them locally. YouTube has some good Ubuntu tutorial channels, this channel for example. What sets the videos in this channel apart from other YouTube tutorial videos, is that while the videos are not interactive, in order to get the full benefit of the videos you should try out the code and even change it in order to get your own customized output.\nIf you install the youtube-dl application from the Ubuntu Software Center you can batch download an entire series of video tutorials from YouTube with a single command in the terminal, and using the -c flag the download can be resumed in the same place it was stopped if it is paused or interrupted. Youtube-dl also lets you choose the format of the video that you want to download. I recommend selecting the 480p mp4 format if it is available. Less than 480p makes it difficult to read the text on the screen, and YouTube videos usually look OK in 480p.\n\nA: This is a difficult question to answer, I don't think you should look for an overall video series to teach you everything, as it likely doesn't exist.\nHowever there are few areas that you could look into (search youtube).\nTo get comfortable with Ubuntu as a dev, you should understand how apt-get works. You can download most things you will need, e.g. \"sudo apt-get install python-numpy\" installs the python module numpy.\nFor development environment, pretty much everything other than xcode and visual studio is available. So it's going to be specific to your preferences, e.g. do you want emacs or eclipse. Once again search youtube, and you will be able to install them using apt-get (\"sudo apt-get install eclipse emacs23\" will install them both).\nIf you are not familiar with the UNIX directory structure, that's very important and I wouldn't try looking for Ubuntu specific videos as any UNIX or LINUX system works mainly the same. I learnt from a written tutorial so I have no specific videos unfortunately.\nNow general linux/ubuntu stuff. There are a few youtube channels I like to watch to keep up to date on distros and can teach you some of the more obscure things you can do with your computer:\nNixie Pixel: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBE-FO9JUOghSysV9gjTeHw\nEspecially check out the earlier videos\nInfinitelyGalatic: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3jSNmKWYA04R47fDcc1ImA\nQuidsup: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0A3ldncnGQ1M_RU2Wb4L2A\n\nA: After a bit of search and peeking I decided to take a Pluralsight course: CompTIA Linux+ by Veronica Henry.\nThere are two parts: Part1 and Part2\nI'm almost done with Part2 and I'm pretty much satisfied with what I saw so far.\n", "Q: asus n550jv audio problem: no sound from notebook' speakers Ubuntu 13.10.\nThe problem is: the internal speakers don't work.

I have the following packages installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*gedit\n\n*gedit-common\n\n*gedit-plugins\nIn Ubuntu 12.04 with these packages installed all that was needed was to activate the terminal plugin and the press Ctrl+F9 to show the bottom panel. This isn't the case with Ubuntu 13.10 (Gedit 3.8.3) and I can't figure out how to do it.\n\nA: After you are sure that gedit-plugins is installed, (re)open gedit and navigate to Edit → Preferences and select Plugins tab. Here you must to tick Embedded Terminal. Then when you will press Ctrl+F9, a terminal will appear in bottom pane:\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Install gedit-plugins and gedit-developer-plugins from Ubuntu Software Center.\n\n\n*From within the Text Editor (gedit) application go to Edit → Preferences → Plugins → Embedded Terminal.\n\n\n*Restart gedit and after that just press Ctrl+F9 and you will get a terminal embedded in gedit.\nI tried this in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\n\nA: A more detailed answer from:\n\n*\n\n*How to debug c programs by gedit?\nGedit Plug-ins\nUse gedit external terminal plug-in\nYou can use gedit with terminal plugin. The steps are fairly straight-forward:\n\n*\n\n*Enable \"Universe\" repository\n\n*Install gedit-plugins\n\n*Activate \"Embedded Terminal\"\n\n*Use Ctrl+F9 to open terminal\n\n*Other gedit plug-ins\n\nStep 1. Enable \"Universe\" repository\nThe first step is to ensure Universe repository is activated from Settings->Software & Updates->Ubuntu Software and ensure the third option is checked:\n\nStep 2. Install gedit-plugins\nInstall gedit-plugs with the command:\nsudo apt install gedit-plugins\n\nStep 3. Activate \"Embedded Terminal\"\nOpen gedit (don't use sudo) and select Edit->Preferences->Plugins and check off Embedded Terminal:\n\nStep 4. Use Ctrl+F9 to open terminal\nIn the GIF below we use Ctrl+F9 to get a tiny window with the command prompt. Use the mouse to click and drag the dividing line up to reveal an approximate size of 24x80.\nThe colors are dreadful! (with default gedit color scheme). I was just learning this as creating the answer so my mouse movements are slow below...\n\nStep 5. Other gedit plug-ins\nAs mentioned in Step 4., you can grab the separator bar to make the terminal window bigger. Here's what it looks like in a normal picture ((not a GIF).\nThere are three other plug-ins I currently use in the gedit coding window:\n\n*\n\n*plug-in to display 80 character cut-off with different background color\n\n*plug-in to display entire document in thumbnail you can drag to quickly go to code section\n\n*Highlight matching brackets\n\nAdditionally there is an external add-on I'd like to install for shellcheck linter / checker that shows bash code errors. I haven't searched for a lint checker for other languages but obviously you can enter gcc and other commands directly into gedit terminal window.\n\nFor further reading please see:\n\n*\n\n*Code completion for gedit\n\n*Useful Gedit plugins for programmers - HowtoForge\n\n*gedit: Add Python / C++ Autocomplete Support - nixCraft\n\n*5 Must-Have Gedit Plugins for Programmers | Yaser Sulaiman's Blog\n\n*How to C program in gedit - Quora\n", "Q: Unable to locate package python-pipsudo I'm trying to install some packages: \nvagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-raring-64:~$ sudo apt-get install ipython ipython-notebook python-pipsudo apt-get install\nReading package lists...

I was able to 'rescue' the system with a combination of the steps below:\nYou may only need to issue this command to fix it:\n# dpkg --configure -a\n\n('#' means from a root prompt, which you get with 'sudo su')\nSee How to fix E: Internal Error, No file name for libc6\nBut it may be a little more involved than that.\nThis sequence should help towards reviving the system:\n# apt-get clean\n# apt-get install -fy\n  (ignore the error at the end)\n# dpkg -i /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb\n# dpkg --configure -a\n# apt-get install -fy\n\nIf the 'dpkg -i' command returns with errors, do the 'dpkg --configure -a', but then go back and repeat the 'dpkg -i', but with the 'E' option to speed it up a little:\n# dpkg -Ei /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb\n\nEventually, 'apt-get install -fy' should be able to run again, possibly even finish without errors, after which your system should be ok again. Do that cycle 'dpkg -i', 'dpkg --configure', 'apt-get install' a couple of times as long at it keeps making some progress.\nSee: 1 and 2\nIf the above doesn't work, then this may work:\n# dpkg -i /var/cache/apt/archives/*BLA*.deb\n\nfor 'BLA', replace with the last word of the error message 'E: Internal Error, No file name for BLA'.\nIf that command says something like 'cannot be configured because WOOPS:MEH is at a different version', then\n# dpkg --purge --force-all WOOPS:MEH\n\nAnd repeat the 'dpkg -i' command.\nAfter this, go back to the sequence with 'apt-get install -fy' above. You may have to come back to this section for another 'BLA' package, and repeat...\nAfter all this, I would suggest to do an 'apt-get dist-upgrade' again, and/or 'apt-get install ubuntu-desktop', etc to make sure all the needed packages are there. \nYou may actually finally need to iterate between 'apt-get install -fy' and 'apt-get dist-upgrade' a couple of times before you get a fully working setup again (stop if both commands finish without errors).\n\nA: You can try sudo apt-get install -f\n", "Q: Can't click allow or deny or even close on the flash \"____ is requesting permission to store data\" popup so im using goanimate on my ubuntu 12.10 quantal quetzal and whenever it autosaves flash asks for permission to store data and i cant click anything on the popup!\nit does this for webcam/microphone flash popups too,please help!\n\nA: I had the same problem once, I don't remember how I solved it but it might be the way described in this forum. the idea is to go to this site and set it to allow it to 'never ask again' (not ideal but well).

When I connect my LCD TV through HDMI nothing happens in first instance. Only when I go to my display settings (settings manager > display), select 'use this output' and 'Right of' (notebook screen - I want an expanded desktop rather than a clone), the TV screen gets activated.\nMy question: Is it possible to store this setting, so that when I plug in the HDMI cable the TV is automatically activated and set as secondary display / desktop extension? And when I plug out the cable, the secondary display is deactivated?\n\nA: I managed to make the expanded display setting persistent by using the following xrandr command:\n#!/bin/sh\nxrandr --output HDMI1 --mode 1280x720 --pos 1920x0 --rotate normal --output DP1 --off --output eDP1 --mode 1920x1080 --pos 0x0 --rotate normal --output VIRTUAL1 --off\n\n(My primary display has 1920x1080 resolution, my secondary display which is the one connected through HDMI has 1280x720)\nBut this does not automatically disactivate HDMI output when the HDMI cable is plugged out (which is a feature I wanted). Haven't found out how to do this yet.\nHowever I also found out about the minimalistic xfce4 display settings dialog, which I didn't know before. This is appears to be useful for quick extending to another screen or deactivating it. It's invoked as follows:\nxfce4-display-settings -m\n\nI found this command was already bound to shortcut (+p, same as in Windows). If that is not yet the case you can set this by going to Settings Manager > Keyboard > Application Shortcuts and assigning the shortcut there.\nFor me this is an equally satisfying solution.\n", "Q: How can I improve color saturation in Ubuntu?

Also I believe I executed this command in every possible way: with -ss and -t after -i, with -t specifying ending point, with mp3 files, with specifying audio codec, with ffmpeg. Am I doing it wrong?\nUPD Thanks to bodhi.zazen this works (I corrected the offset and duration reported by mp3splt-gtk, they were wrong for some reason or other, and the goal was to cut mp3 file)\navconv -i RR119Accessibility.mp3 -ss 00:52:08 -t 00:01:08 RR119Accessibility-2.mp3\n\nBut this doesn't:\navconv -ss 00:52:08 -t 00:01:08 -i RR119Accessibility.mp3 RR119Accessibility-2.mp3\n\nThe resulting file start at 00:52:08 and goes until the end of the original file. I thought -ss and -t are related to input file if specified before -i. And to output file otherwise. Could someone explain this?\n\nA: I think the original problem was with the formatting of your time stamp.\nThe format is HH:MM:SS\nI am not sure I am understanding your question about the order of the options. I do not think it matters as long as -i is followed by the input file name and -ss HH:MM:SS followed my -t HH:MM:SS\nThe -ss HH:MM:SS is the starting point, and -t HH:MM:SS is the duration\nso -ss 00:01:00 -t 00:05:00 would start at the one minute mark and run for 5 minutes.\nOn my system, using ffmpeg, order does not matter (you can specify time or input file in any order so long as -ss is followed by the duration (-t) )\n\nA: The problem comes from the different meaning of -ss depending upon where in the command line it is. It's a carry over from the days when avconv was still a part of ffmpeg project, and i believe it is being fixed in the newer versions.\nIn the olden days if you said something like\n ffmpeg -ss 5 -i input\n\nWhat you meant was \"skip to the 5 second mark in the file and begin to read there\".\nBut if you said\nffmpeg -i input -ss 5\n\nYou meant \"open the input file and skip all the data until the five second mark\".\nAs you can understand the first approach will actually fail quite often, because you are skipping in the file without reading it. It works well only on the files which have timestamps in them, allowing you to read the frame and know if you've gone too far already or not.\nBasically the way it worked in ffmpeg was \"Guess the bitrate by the first second, and then assume that all other seconds are the same\". But, of course, not all the seconds are the same, and if we are talking about a 52 hours of \"drift\" the error can be quite large.\nSo if you are using the early post-split version of avconv you should always put -ss after the file that is being read. But in the newer versions (to the best of my knowledge) this bug was fixed.\n\nA: Try:\navconv -i RR119Accessibility.wav -ss 52:13:49 -t 01:13:52 RR119Accessibility-2.wav\n\nThe options of ffmpeg and avconv are position sensitive.\nIn your example ffmpeg starts reading the file and starts outputting from timestamp -ss\n(which ffmpeg does well on my system and avconv does not, call it a regression of sorts).\nIn the example I have given here, avconv (or ffmpeg for that matter) seeks first to the right offset and then starts reading and outputting. This works for both.\nYou can find more documentation about avconv on http://libav.org\nthese guys have forked off ffmpeg and are also responsible for the extremely old ffmpeg version in Ubuntu.\nThe REAL ffmpeg is not in the ubuntu repositories but in a PPA:\nppa:jon-severinsson/ffmpeg\nYou can find more documentation about ffmpeg on http://ffmpeg.org\nConsider the man pages out of date \n", "Q: Geany permission denied I wanted to run a small test program, but if I execute it the terminal says:\n./geany_run_script.sh: 5: ./geany_run_script.sh: ./main: Permission denied\n\n\n------------------\n(program exited with code: 126)\nPress return to continue\n\n\nA: You call in your script another file/script - ./main.

I am currently re-partitioning the drives to remove Vista and the old Ubuntu and only have Ubuntu 12.04 on the PC. As I set up the 320 HDD to be a single partition with Ext4 as it's file system, I'm supposed to select a \"Mount Point\" before proceeding with the install or the partition will be ignored. I'm not sure which mount point to choose. /usr/local looks good but that's a wild guess on my part. Also when I set up the partitioning for the 160 GB HDD I had approx. 88 GB of free space left. Should that also be formatted as Ext4 and be given a Mount Point? \nPlease let me know as I'm on hold with the install right now\nThank you\n\nA: Your root (/) partition for the 160 GB is okay, leave the free space \"as is\" for the time being.\nIn your case I would partition the 320 GB drive as ext4 and with mountpoint /home\nTrust me, it will make your life easier.\nOther partitions can be done after the install. They don't matter much at this point\nGood luck :-)\n\nA: OK, my method may seem unconventional to some, but I've tried a lot of methods, and this one has really worked out well for me.\nI create a big partition for documents, pictures, music, etc.  For my own historical reasons, I labelled this partition \"shared\" (because it gets shared with any other OS I might install.  I mount this at /mnt/shared, and change the owner to myself (chown me:me /mnt/shared).\nIn this partition, I create directories such as \"Documents\", \"Pictures\", \"Downloads\", \"Music\", etc.  Once this is mounted correctly, I then make symbolic links of the well-known directories seen in \"Places\" in my home directory, and I delete each of the the still-empty directories in $HOME and immediately replace them with the symbolic links, named exactly the same as the original directories.  Doing this immediately allows them to obtain the special icons automatically.  If not done right  away, they need to be set by editing the file ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs, which isn't very hard, but it's an extra step.\nOnce this is done, they appear to be exactly like the original directories, and work the same.  But, they could be used for a different OS in the same way, even Windows, if needed.\nI think this is much easier than setting up a separate  $HOME mount, as you can't easily reuse the home directory for a new or different distro.  I've had many problems in the past trying to reuse my home directory; this is much easier, as it isolates almost all the files you want to save.  \nEdit for more elaboration as requested in comments\nI often like to try new distros, sometimes even off a live media.  In order to evaluate a system, it's nice to have your documents and other media files in order to actually use the system to do your normal work.  But you don't really want it to write a lot of files into your home directory, since you may decide to abandon it.  So I let it create a new home directory in a new partition, and mount the big media files that are separate, where you might even want to save files that you use on the new system.  \nAlso, when I install a new or different distro, I like to use the same username and password, so I don't want my working home directory to get screwed up by a possibly temporary system.  But I'd do it even if I used a new username just to keep things tidy.\nThe \"Places\" I mentioned is shown in Nautilus, on the left where it shows \"Places\", \"Devices\", \"Bookmarks\", and \"Network\".  I don't know if it's called \"Places\" for other file browsers or flavors.  Also, in the home directory, those folders have a special icon.\n\nA: First, you need to understand Linux/Unix mount points a bit better. I wrote this article on the topic a while back, so you might consult it for background information. I'm sure there are other tutorials on this topic you might consult, but I don't have any other URLs handy.\nOnce you've got a better understanding of mount points, you should realize that your disk sizes are a bit awkward. A complete Ubuntu installation takes about 5-8GiB, although it's common to create a root (/) filesystem in the 10-30GiB range to give some space for growth and temporary files, plus a separate /home partition (as thom suggested) for your user files. (/home is not used in a default Ubuntu installation, but IMHO it should be.) A separate swap partition as large as your RAM or a bit larger is also common. If you add up the needs of root (/) and swap, it's almost certain to be well under half the size of your smaller disk. If you mount your 320GB drive at /home, that means you'll have either a ridiculously oversized root (/) or you'll have unused space on the 160GB disk and no convenient place to mount it.\nSome people deal with this issue by using some of the storage space as a partition that will be auto-mounted somewhere under /media by Ubuntu. This is awkward, though, since your user files normally reside in /home, so you'll have to decide what goes where, and if you make bad decisions, you'll run out of space and have to spend time juggling files around to deal with it.\nA more sophisticated way to handle the problem is to use Logical Volume Management (LVM), which enables you to group together several partitions (physical volumes in LVM-speak) into a volume group, which you can then carve up into logical volumes that can be any size -- even larger than any given physical volume. Using LVM will therefore enable you to set up a /home partition that spans both your disks -- perhaps 400-450GB in size. The trouble with LVM is that Ubuntu's desktop editions provide poor support for it, so you'll need to jump through extra hoops to use it. (FWIW, Fedora provides much better out-of-box LVM support than Ubuntu.)\nI recommend you read a bit about LVM (at the link in the previous paragraph) before making any decision. You might decide that it's more hassle than it's worth, and just deal with your awkwardly-sized disks in some other way; or you might decide to take the plunge and set up an LVM for your computer. The point is to make an informed decision.\n\nA: Starting with Partions.\nStart with primary\n\n*\n\n*EFI partion: 200mb (This is not necessary. only if you dont have any OS in system)\n\n*Ext4 mount point / for Ubuntu : 30-100Gb, 40gb is enough\n\n*Ext4 mount point /home: Atleast minimum 100Gb and maximum 300gb is enough for your daily needs.Logical Partition\n\n*Create SWAP of 8GB, Logical Partition\n\n*Rest you can chose Ext4, or as per your need if you are using dual boot then ntfs.\n\nThen good to go for Installation\n", "Q: Creating a very simple upstart script So I've been attempting to create an incredibly simple upstart script.\nI started with:\nconsole output\n\nexec /srv/scripts/test.sh\n\nBut got this error:\nstart: Job failed to start\n\nSo I changed it to:\nconsole output\n\nscript\n   set -x\n   echo \"Hello world!\"\nend script\n\nThis seems to run just find and dandy, but I don't get any output anywhere, and I was told there would be something written to /var/log/upstart/test.log (my script is test.conf).

I have a Dell Studio XPS 1647 laptop that has a dual-core Intel Core i5 and an ATI Radeon 4670 GPU. It originally came with Windows 7 Home Premium installed, but I have since upgraded to Windows 8 (currently running the 8.1 Preview). For school, I have to have a working distribution of Linux on my machine. I tried Ubuntu first, at the time the latest version was 11.04. It ran, but it seemed that the fan was always on, got and stayed hot quickly, drained the battery quickly, and didn't seem to have nearly the performance that I did running Windows. This was mostly fixed when I realized I didn't have the ATI drivers installed for my GPU. I installed the fglrx drivers and the problem was mostly fixed.\nThat was my first install of Linux, by exploring and toying with things I ended up messing up my system and had to reinstall the OS. By this time, I had discovered GNOME 3 and was using it so I decided to download Ubuntu 12.10 GNOME Remix so I wouldn't have to install GNOME myself after Ubuntu. It installed and ran, but however I noticed that I could not get the fglrx drivers for my GPU to install successfully. I then took to the Internet and discovered, much to my chagrin, that it will not work because AMD is not supporting XServer 1.13. You can get more information from this bug report.\nThere is a workaround posted which involves downgrading XServer that has worked for some, but has also lead to unstable or crashing systems for others. I learned that there was an open source driver which could be used. Recently I tried to install Ubuntu GNOME 13.04 (Raring Ringtail) and the open source ATI driver. It worked, but I'm afraid it doesn't keep the system from getting too hot like the proprietary driver did. My system runs okay for a short time and then gets so hot that performance quickly degrades and after extended use the system will shut down automatically to prevent physical damage. When I have ran the sensors command I have gotten temperatures around 100-110 degrees Celsius on the card before the system shuts itself off. I am basically only able to use the system for about 30 minutes or so before it gets too hot.\nI am wondering if anyone has any advice for me as far as what I should run considering my hardware. Should I download and install the old version 11.04 that seemed to work okay before? Should I try the workaround downgrading XServer on the latest version. Is the open source driver my best option or should I just look at a different distribution of Linux since I can't get my hardware to work properly with Ubuntu?\n\nA: Ubuntu 11.04 came with kernel 2.6 and is no longer supported, I wouldn't go that route.\nUbuntu 12.04 is a Long Term Support (LTS) release that will be supported through 2017.

BUT if I run firefox from console as sudo, I can use it as usual. I can access Skype and pretty much any other network stuff (like installing software with apt-get etc.), also if I use Astrill VPN software I can access webpages even running without sudo. \nI haven't install any software or anything like that for several days = I have not a clue what could cause this.

I have no clue what happened that it works again...\n\nA: This is not a Firefox or Ubuntu specific problem. To me it seems to be a DNS problem. The information you provide assumes it is a software problem (which I think it is not). Since you use the abbreviation NB I guess you have a notebook and you have traveled between different networks... this can cause a change in the DNS resolving information. But to be sure, can you ping your router and/or an outside IP address?\nBTW, resolv.conf should contain your DNS information, not your local router (only if it runs a DNS caching daemon) or localhost:\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 8.8.4.4\nNote: you can add these entries, but they are not always optimal as these are provided by Google. Use the one provided by your ISP if possible.\nCould you try opening a page by using the IP address: e.g. 173.194.37.65 for one of Google. And if not, can you ping it at least. A traceroute would be better.\nNote:\nUser was able to connect to outside webpages using the IP address, so confirmed it was a DNS problem. Eventually adding the entries to DNS and a restart of the notebook made it work. I suspect he messed up his networkstack since he also used Astrill.

But the device does not appear on the Sound Settings, so I just can't select it as input/output device. \nIn other words, it's connected but \"useless\".\nSo, searching around for solutions, I found a software called stream2ip. With this I can connect the device and it appears on the Sound Settings, the sound plays on the device as well, but my microphone does not work, even when selected on the settings, also the A2DP option still not working.\nStream2ip isn't a solution at all, I mean everything was working without it in the previous Ubuntu version.\nMaybe I'm missing something, and I hope someone could give me any hint. \nHow can I get the A2DP output option and the input working again, on the Ubuntu 13.10? How to make the device to appear on the Sound Settings without have to use Stream2ip?\nThanks!\nEdit 1\nWhat I tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install bazaar fork related below.\n\n*Reinstall pulseaudio\n\n*Reinstall bluez\n\n*Change settings on /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf (Enable=Socket, Disable=Socket...)\n\n*Install all sort of packages like bluez-utils, bluez-audio, gstreamer0.10\n\n*Install pulseaudio volume control\n\n*Install blueman, bluetooth-suport, pulseaudio-module-bluetooth\n\n\nEdit 2 \nNow the microphone and a2dp are working (separately of course).\nTo do this, I have to connect the headset, start some music, pause it using the playback options of the headset, then change the output mode in the sound settings to A2DP (sometimes it does not work in the first try)\nIt's far from working like it was working on 13.04. But it's working, and I probably will have to deal with the stream2ip for while.\nBy the way, here is how I installed the strem2ip:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:takkat-nebuk/takkat\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade \nsudo apt-get install stream2ip-gtk3\n\nEdit 3\nInstead of using the stream2ip to make the headset appear on the sound settings, you can just use this command: pulseaudio -k\nNow the question is: How to make it automatically when I pair my device?\nWhat I got so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*All the headset stuff working. \n\n*A way to avoid using the stream2ip, but not the optimal way yet.\n\n\nEdit 4 \nWhen I disconnect my bluetooth device, the overall sound just crash, all the devices disappear from the sound settings (including the speakers). If open, the Rhythmbox also crashes and I don't have any other system sound as well.\nAny guess on how to solve this?\nAnd I'm still looking for ways to avoid using the pulseaudio -k command every time I connect my headset.\n\nA: I tried all the suggestions here to get my a2dp-mode with my bluetooth headphones to work in Ubuntu 13.10. After installation of Ubuntu 13.10 with kernel 3.12.rc4, the headphones were shown in sound-settings after pairing them and applying the command pulseaudio -k, which kills the pulseaudio-service. However, I still could not choose them and the sound kept playing over the internal speakers of the laptop.\nThis worked for me:  \n1) open configuration file\ngksudo gedit /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf\n\nand add under [General]: \n\nDisable=Socket\n\nI also uncommented the line (removing the #) that reads: \n\nAutoConnect=true\n\n2) reinstall pulseaudio and bluez, do NOT omit to install pulseaudio-module-bluetooth\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall pulseaudio pulseaudio-utils pulseaudio-module-bluetooth\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall bluez bluez-alsa bluez-audio bluez-gstreamer bluez-hcidump bluez-tools bluez-utils\n\nOnce I had done so, I restarted and connected by headphones using the bluetooth-settings, which worked fine. Still I did not see the headphones listed in sound-settings* in Unity. However, once I opened **pulseaudio-volume-control and selected the configuration-tab, I saw the headphones, but the associated profile was set to off. I changed that to A2DP and the headphones were listed in sound-settings. Since I done that, the headphones are shown in sound-settings immediately after connecting. \nNOTE: I had the bazaar fork installed as described above, but removing it once the headphones connected did work. \n\nA: Loading the bluetooth discovery module manually fixes the problem by now:\nsudo pactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover\n\nAfter loading the module everything works as expected.\n\nA: I've got exactly the same problem as you with my another a2dp compatible audio device for my car (it is a FM-transmitter that connects with the notebook/smartphone via bluetooth's a2dp).\nWhat finally worked for me is simple forcing the device into the A2DP profile. You should do the following (the commands should not be executed as root):\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the paired card with pactl list cards short. Each line of the output represents another possible audio device available to the PulseAudio. The first column represents the ID of the device as seen by the PulseAudio.

Immediately after issuing this command, you should have your bluetooth device available in the sound control panel. \n\n\nThe critical part is the have the device listed in step 1. If you don't, this answer doesn't apply to you.\n\nFor a convenience, you can get all this in one: \npactl set-card-profile $(pactl list cards short | awk '/bluez/{print $1}') a2dp\n\n\nA: Something to note about bluetooth, it has limited bandwidth and only operates according to specific schemas:\na2dp is stereo high quality audio playback only\nhsp/hfp is mono audio in full duplex which allows both a play and record.\na bluetooth audio device can do one connection at once so will be one or the other at a given time.\nI get round this by using A2DP for best quality listening (and less glitches on video confrencing) and an external usb condenser mic like the bheringer c1. \nFWIW bluetooth in 16.04 ubuntu is fully integrated and very easy to use so the only problems you will have with it these days is badly implemented chipsets or drivers.\n\nA: Maybe this helps\nI suspect your bluetooth not working on 13.10 can be attributed to a bug in the latest kernel.     \nIt can be fixed by installing a bazaar fork below:    \nhttps://code.launchpad.net/~robert-ancell/indicator-bluetooth/dont-hide-on-rfkill\nInstallation instructions are at:\nHow do I install a bazaar fork in 13.10?\nThe summary of commands to use:\nsudo apt-get install bzr build-essential \nsudo apt-get build-dep indicator-bluetooth  \nbzr branch lp:~robert-ancell/indicator-bluetooth/dont-hide-on-rfkill  \ncd dont-hide-on-rfkill  \ndpkg-buildpackage  \ncd  \nsudo dpkg -i indicator-bluetooth_0.0.6daily13.02.19-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb\n\nRestart the system.\nDetails are at Missing Bluetooth indicator\n", "Q: new installation appears to have got stuck I'm installing Ubuntu 13.10 on a new out-of-the-box PC that was preinstalled with FreeDOS, and it's been on stage nine of the install guide for seven hours now, titled \"Ubuntu One\".

Any window that I open is unresponsive or only starts responding after a very long time to mouse clicks. I just cannot use my mouse or touchpad at all and am having to navigate entirely with my keyboard. Even that stops working occasionally. Currently I'm using the older kernel 3.8 to get around my Wifi issues but the issue was present even in the 3.11 kernel. \nEDIT: I might add that the issue comes up gradually i.e. after I do a sudo service lightdm restart or right after initial login, the windows seem to work fine but after some time they stop responding completely to mouse events and sometimes to key presses as well.\nUPDATE: After a prolonged run without rebooting, I find that the computer is becoming unresponsive to key presses every 5-6 seconds and then resumes after another 5-6 seconds. Also, the screen locking seems to be delayed and happens after I return to work after leaving the machine idle for some time. Further, sometimes the title bar of a window does not respond to clicks while the window content does or vice versa (This is particularly the case with nautilus)\nAnother thing is that while I am using any browser, whether Chrome or Firefox, the window automatically navigates back periodically i.e. it behaves as if I had pressed the back button when I clearly have not done so.

For example, while I was typing this question, I kept getting popups telling me that I am in the middle of an edit and if I really wanted to navigate away from this page. I have tried clearing my browser cache and that has only made it a little less frequent.

(wifi works too!)\n", "Q: XF86 keybinds in Openbox Lubuntu uses Openbox as its window manager. ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml is a file that specifies, among other things, keybinds for various commands.\nMost of the keybinds in lubuntu-rc.xml use modifier keys such as Control, Shift, Alt, and Super.\nFor example, one way of opening a terminal window would be by pressing Control+Alt+T together:\n\n<!-- Launch a terminal on Ctrl + Alt + T-->\n<keybind key=\"C-A-T\">\n  <action name=\"Execute\">\n    <command>lxsession-default terminal</command>\n  </action>\n</keybind>\n\n\nBut there is also this:\n\n<!-- Keybinding for terminal button-->\n<keybind key=\"XF86WWW\">\n  <action name=\"Execute\">\n    <command>lxsession-default terminal</command>\n  </action>\n</keybind>\n<keybind key=\"XF86Terminal\">\n  <action name=\"Execute\">\n    <command>lxsession-default terminal</command>\n  </action>\n</keybind>\n\n\nWhat are keybind key=\"XF86WWW\" and  keybind key=\"XF86Terminal\"? How do I locate these keys on my laptop's keyboard? My laptop is a Dell Inspiron N 1545 from 2008.\n\nA: These keys are defined in /usr/include/X11/XF86keysym.h.\nPlease note that the X11 include files may not be installed on your system if you have not installed various dev packages or needed to install proprietary graphics drivers. You can also find XF86keysym.h online\nAccording to this header file, they are XFree86 vendor specific keysyms. \nIn other words, these keys are either part of a particular keyboard or they are not. If you don't see them, your keyboard does not have them.\nThese keys are pre-defined in desktop configuration files (you see them in Unity System Settings >> Keyboard >> Shortcuts as well, though Unity renames them slightly) as a convenience to users since otherwise it usually requires some scripting to attach actions to them.\nThe file also says:\nX.Org will not be adding to the XF86 set of keysyms, though they have \nbeen adopted and are considered a \"standard\" part of X keysym definitions.\nXFree86 never properly commented these keysyms, so we have done our\nbest to explain the semantic meaning of these keys.\n\nThere are two things to note here.\n\n\n*\n\n*These keysyms were an attempt to make XFree86/Xorg work with a wide range of hardware and some of the keysysms seem a little dated. For example, the calculator key is part of a group entitled:\nThese are sometimes found on PDA's (e.g. Palm, PocketPC or elsewhere)\n\n\n*These keysyms are standard. They are compiled into the various xkb-related libraries and are therefore automatically available to use, with or without the include files present on a system. But, of course, you need to have the key that emits the corresponding keycode already physically on the keyboard.\nIf you don't have the keys, you can of course map the actions to other key sequences. Because the keysyms are built into Xorg and the default actions are built into Ubuntu (through lubuntu-rc.xml, update-alternatives, and perhaps other ways), this is very easy to do. \nUbuntu, for example, uses these keysyms to offer the calculator key in both Unity and Lubuntu, even though it's extremely unlikely a standard desktop keyboard will have this key. \nI liked the idea of a calculator button, which I had never thought of until I saw the option in System Settings. \nIn Unity, I changed the shortcut key for the calculator to Ctrl+/. \nIn Lubuntu, which I also use, I changed\n<keybind key=\"XF86Calculator\">\n\nto\n<keybind key=\"C-slash\">\n\nYou can do the same for XF86WWW and XF86Terminal, although you can't assign a single key stroke to one of these keys (really, now just the concept of the key) unless you don't want to use the re-mapped key for it's original purpose, and you probably don't have many keys to spare.\nBut, as an example, I never use the menu key for a right-click. In Lubuntu, I can easily turn it into a terminal launcher by changing XF86Terminal to Menu. (The xml file uses the name of the key or the keycode. You can find these by using xev in a terminal, then pressing the key you want.)\nInterestingly enough, in Lubuntu the default action of the browser key is to also launch the terminal. To re-map XF86WWW, you would need to change the name of the key and the <command>... as well.\n", "Q: Problem with installing VBox guest additions in 13.10 (shared folders) I am using 13.10 for both the host and guest.

I guess I am wondering why not and if it is because it is running off a flash drive?\n\nA: Ubuntu cannot include support for MP3 or DVD video playback or recording. MP3 formats are patented, and the patent holders have not provided the necessary licenses. Ubuntu also excludes other multimedia software due to patent, copyright, or license restrictions, such as Adobe Flash Player and RealPlayer.\nThat doesn’t mean you can’t play .mp3 files in Ubuntu, it just takes a bit of work (not much).\nFirst enable the Multiverse repository.

I never wanted to stay with apt-get install to work with old nodejs so used the downloaded the latest stable code instead. \n\n*Now run which nodejs command and you would see\n/usr/bin/nodejs which automatically gets available under the environment path. \n\n*Return back to your coffeescript js file and change the command from\nnode to nodejs i.e. #!/usr/bin/env nodejs\nSave and tada.. \nRun your coffeescript with your actual hot coffee\n\nA: According to this coffeescript issue from 2010, a name conflict leads to the issue that the node ubuntu packet (not to be confused with the nodejs packet) takes the name node for itself, whereas Node.js only gets the nodejs command name. \nEntering coffee calls node and the expected node would be the executeable from Node.js, but it gets the wrong executeable. A workaround for this is removing the node packet from the system via the packet manager and symlinking node to nodejs:\nln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/local/bin/node\nln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/local/sbin/node\n\n", "Q: Reading mail from system user When I log into a server, I get You have mail.\nWith alpine and sudo alpine I've deleted all my and root's emails, but there is also a file /var/spool/mail/smmsp.

This isobviously because of dhcp failed. So now you can set your network manually or read dhclient man.\nOk manually:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set your interface ip an mask\nsudo ifconfig eth0 <ipinsideyournrtwork> 255.255.255.0\n\nip inside your network can be 10.0.0.4 or 192.168.0.4 .\n\n*Now you can set default route toyour gateway (router)\nBut you must get router ip first. Fortunately you set your interface ip and this is where your network address comes from (ip masked by netmask). To get your router ip requires change the address end .4 to some common number like 1 or 138 or 254. The router ip and client ip must belong to the same network to get ping functional.\nSo try: ping 10.0.0.1 first when you set your ip 10.0.0.4, etc.\nIf you can ping your router then set the default route:\nsudo route default add gw <yourrouterip> eth0\n\nCool you can check your default route with the route command.\n\n*The last step is set your dns server. But check your default route before, just try ping some ip outside your network, like google dns server 8.8.8.8 .\n\nA: it is not good idea to write answers on ubuntu touch and nexus7. sorry\nso last step, set dns server, just edit /etc/resolv.conf and add following line\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\nwhere the ip is your name server, which can be also different like 8.8.8.4 or 8.8\n8.1 or 212.47.1.4 or other public dns server.\nSo now you can ping google.com.\nGood luck, jaro123\n", "Q: How can i open SISX package?

There simply isn't a development release that's a target from 12.10. 13.04 is your only upgrade path and that's released.

In Ubuntu 13.04 there was an option to use the PPA by Relan in order to get ExFat functionality. Seeing that in Ubuntu this functionality is now available from the repositories without the PPA I tried this but failed to make it work.\nSo my question is how do I enable exfat support?\n\nA: I just did a successful install on 4/3/2014 with Ubuntu 13.10, fully updated, using only this command:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install exfat-utils\nNo restart required, and the drive auto-mounted with full read/write support.\n\nA: fuse-utils moved to fuse. fuse-utils has been a trasitionary metapackage (something that just depends on the new package name) since 12.04.\nThat doesn't help you much if you have something that has a package dependency on fuse-utils because you're right, the metapackage has been removed now. The simplest thing to do might be to just download the Raring version and install that. It shouldn't hurt anything as it makes no demands on which version of fuse to install, just that there's one installed.\n\nA: Turns out the packages from the official repositories do the trick. Just install exfat-utils and exfat-fuse packages using the package manager of your choice, or just using apt-get from the command line:\nsudo apt-get install exfat-utils exfat-fuse\n\nThis should delivery a working exfat file system (read and write support, but not formatting the drives with exfat via Gnome Disks and GParted).\nFrom 13.04+ it hasn't been necessary but if you're using 12.04 you might need to reboot your computer before you can mount your exfat partition. If it isn't working for you after installing the packages, try rebooting.\n\nA: Finally get it to work on my 13.10.\nI did:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:relan/exfat\nsudo apt-get install fuse  # (only fuse)\n\nand lastly\nsudo apt-get install exfat-fuse   # (instead of fuse-exfat)\n\nPlugged my External HD and it's working read/write.\n", "Q: CPU overheating.

There seems to be some change in 13.10 that makes recognizing key-combinations less sensitive. Does anyone know of where such a thing is configured?\nHere's the story, just until a few days ago, using 13.04, I have had no problem opening terminals (I'm a programmer, so that happens a lot) using Ctrl+Alt+T. The lightest press on the three keys (and quite fast) would get me a terminal. Ever since 13.10, it doesn't work the same way.\nNow I have to press the keys for a longer time for it to do something. It's quite annoying since I often open a terminal, write a command and close it and half of the times the terminal doesn't even open.\nSome other observations that I made:\n\n\n*\n\n*Trying with Ctrl+Shift+N (to open a new terminal), Ubuntu is quite snappy. Again, lightest press immediately gives a new terminal.\n\n*Running Ubuntu 12.04 in virtualbox (inside the same Ubuntu 13.10) doesn't have this issue. The virtual Ubuntu is snappy as always.\n\n\nFrom the second observation, I can surely tell that it's not a keyboard issue. If it was, my 12.04 would also have problems.\nThe first observation is confusing though. Any thoughts or settings I could look at?\n\nA: I saw this answer suggesting to set it in CCSM. I did so in General/Commands (enable it first) and add gnome-terminal for one of the command and give the keybinding you want under Key Binding tab.\nNote that Ubuntu's default settings overrides this, so you have to go to System Settings, Keyboard, Shortcuts, Launchers, Launch terminal and remove it. But wait, that setting can't be removed, so just change it to something you don't use, for example Super+T.\nHaving CCSM manage the key binding resulted in a very snappy CTRL+ALT+T again.\nNote: don't be warned by CCSM reading your CTRL as PRIMARY.

I updated /etc/environment file to make /home/pshizh/Desktop included in PATH. Then I ran command edit_envir in terminal, but it said \"dit_envir command not found. However, after I copied file edit_envir to /usr/bin/ and ran command edit_envir in terminal again, it worked. Why? I'd really appreciate your help.  \n\nA: Don't edit the /etc/environment file!!! revert the changes and put it back as it originally were. Your system is supposed to work with multiple users. Imagine you create another user, say johndoe. Then what will happen when he logs in? he'll have, in his PATH variable your directory /home/pshizd/Desktop. I'm sure he doesn't care about that!\nInstead, modify the PATH variable from within your own personal .bashrc file: add this snippet at the end of your .bashrc file:\nPATH=/home/pshizd/Desktop:$PATH\n\nNow wait, your own scripts are not supposed to be located on your Desktop. Instead, create a bin directory in your home directory, put your scripts there, and instead of the previous command in your .bashrc file, put this:\nPATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH\n\nIf you modify the file .bashrc, the changes will only take effect in new terminals.\n\nNow, if you want this script to be available to all users (e.g., you'll want johndoe to be able to execute it, yet he should not have access to your personal directory), the best place is to put the script in /usr/local/bin. This directory should already exist (create it if necessary), and should already be in every user's PATH. Check that by inspecting the /etc/profile file (but do not modify this file!); you could also grep PATH in there, as so (with some contextual lines):\ngrep -C4 PATH /etc/profile\n\nyou should see that /usr/local/bin is added to the user's PATH.\nBy the way, do not put your own commands in /usr/bin! This place is for your distribution's binaries, not your personal ones.\n\nRegarding why it didn't work after modifying /etc/environment: you need to open a new terminal for changes to take effect.\n\nA: After you edit /etc/environment file, if you want the change to take effect, you need to log out and log back in or to source that file in terminal as follow:\nsource /etc/environment\n\nAnyway, this is not an indicated method to add a directory to the PATH.

System Monitor is a very good task manager that, compared to Task Manager in Windows, uses much less system resources when it is running. This means that when an application has frozen, you can use the System Monitor to close it without using a lot of system resources which could cause your whole system to freeze. \nIn case your mouse is frozen too, you can still open the System Monitor from the keyboard if you assign a custom keyboard shortcut to the System Monitor in System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts tab. This answer has screenshots showing how to create a custom keyboard shortcut from the Keyboard -> Shortcuts tab.\n\nA: You can do a number of things :\n\n\n*\n\n*Search for the System Monitor in the Dash, de facto that's your task manager.\n\n*Type top in the terminal, you'll get a list of processes taking up memory\n\n*A more interactive and informative version can be obtained by installing htop.

Switched to Xubuntu 13.10. Default player is gmusicbrowser. Rhythmbox still available.\nI have previously, on rhythmbox, patiently rated much of my music collection, which allows to let it play automatically enjoyable yet varied songs. As expected I'd like to transfer ratings to gmusicbrowser.\nSearching before asking\nRhythmbox stores ratings in XML format ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/rhythmdb.xml.\nSeeing how the content of ~/.config/gmusicbrowser/gmbrc evolves with time shows that it contains all the data (music collection, metadata, ratings). It looks tab-separated.\nHas anyone made a script to transfer ratings from the former to the latter ? I could not find any.\nNotice that Transferring ratings and playlists from Rhythmbox to Clementine suggests exporting filtered playlists per rating and importing them to the new playser (Clementine in that case). This looks smart but makes assumptions about sending and receiving programs capabilities and tidyness.\nSpecific case\nThe solution mentioned above might work with gmusicbrowser. I'm just worried because my rhythmbox database is kind of \"dirty\". It has several occurrences of many songs (because is accessed them through different paths in its history and even lots of non-music files mentioned, making a 100MB rhythmdb.xml file, while the amount of actual music files mentioned in it is much much smaller than that...).\nA script that walks gmusicbrowser database and writes a modified copy with cherry-picked ratings from rhythmbox database sounds better.\nQuestions\n\n\n*\n\n*Has anyone done something similar ?\n\n*Any other hint ?\n\n\nRegards,\n\nA: Done for gmusicbrowser.\nHere's how I did it finally!\n\n\n*\n\n*first clean up rhythmbox database using custom written XSLT style sheets. I can provide additional information on request (off-topic in this question).\n\n*export playlists from rhythmbox (it happened to be pls format, others would have probably worked, too). I had playlists for \"rating >=3 stars\", same for 4 and 5.\n\n*launch gmusicbrowser\n\n*have it import all existing music, show it\n\n*click on one line in the grid showing titles, press Ctrl-A select all\n\n*right-click and choose \"Edit rating\" then choose a default rating (I set it to \"no star\")\n\n*import \"rating >=3 stars\" in gmusicbrowser\n\n*click on one line in the grid showing titles, press Ctrl-A select all\n\n*right-click and choose \"Edit rating\" then choose 3 stars rating\n\n*do the same for the playlists \"rating >=4 stars\" and 5.\nThen I recreated the filters and sort orders.\nThis uses the capability of gmusicbrowser to allow batch edit rating, something rhythmbox cannot do.\nI could not do that in Clementine.

So I have Ubuntu 13.10 on my Dell Inspiron 1564 which has VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller, and I'm not a gamer, but I want to play that old Start Wars games (The Old Republic, Galactic Empire, Jedi Academy).\nMy question is - should I use Wine OR VMware OR VirtualBox ? and WHY ?\n\nA: Wine or CrossOver. You will loose SO MUCH performance with VMs.\nTry:\n    http://www.codeweavers.com/products/ (I am not affiliated with them)\nor:\nsudo apt-get install wine\n\nIf you're trying wine, you might also want to check here to resolve winetrick dependency and specific wine versions working and others not issues.\n\nA: I can't say whether virtualization or Wine would function better, but I'd take a look at PlayOnLinux. It's a one-stop shop for installing a lot of software via Wine, including several games (including KOTR and Jedi Academy, but Galactic Empire isn't listed). It removes the sometimes painful process of setting up Wine to work with an application i.e. installing dependencies.\nOtherwise, bear in mind that to run Windows on a virtual machine, you'll need a licensed copy, and if you already have it installed in dual-boot I don't believe you are allowed to install it on a virtual drive as well.\n", "Q: Boot Ubuntu from a bootable USB hangs on purple screen I recently bought a laptop (Lenovo Y410P) with Windows 8 pre-installed and I'm trying to dual boot Windows 8 and Ubuntu 13.0.\nI created a bootable usb using Pendrive.

UPDATE (JAN-2017):\nThe following setup works fine since, approximately, July-2016:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows 10 64 on PC1,\n\n*Ubuntu 16.04 64 on PC2,\n\n*Mozilla Thunderbird and Firefox recent versions (fresh installs on Windows 10 PC1, updated on Ubuntu 16.04 PC2),\n\n*Shared Thunderbird and Firefox profiles between 2 PCs.\n\n\nWhen sharing through a cloud service and profile folders on PCs are going out of sync (when working simultaneously in rare cases - just for experiment) several IMAP folders (those with the highest traffic) get duplicated. These duplicates are removed automatically, when synchronization completes.\nORIGINAL QUESTION (NOV-2013):\nSoftware versions: Thunderbird (v.24), Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Windows 7\nI have the following setup:\nI use Ubuntu 12.04 LTS as a main working system (host) and Windows 7 running in VirtualBox as a secondary system (guest). I've created a profile in Mozilla Thunderbird (v.24) located in the folder accessible by both systems. Since VirtualBox uses the same user ID in the host system, there are no issues related to sharing the same folder between multiple users.\n\n\n*\n\n*I used Thunderbird running on guest OS (Windows) to create the profile and to setup the mail account inside the profile.\n\n*Then I created a new Thunderbird profile in Linux and linked it (through profiles.ini) to the folder with profile created at step 1.\n\n*I made corrections to the file prefs.js according to instructions here: http://web.archive.org/web/20050207141558/http://texturizer.net/thunderbird/share_mail.html (Replaced Windows-specific absolute path syntax with Linux-specific absolute path syntax, removed lines containing \"[ProfD]\").\n\n\nI used the following sources of information:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://kb.mozillazine.org/Sharing_a_profile_between_Windows_and_Linux;\n\n*the link mentioned in the previous section;\n\n*http:@@//ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=203524\n\n\nI tested this setup under Windows and Linux (I haven't tested them yet working simultaneously). Everything seems to work fine (currently I am keeping all my mail on the IMAP server, therefore all my inbox messages are not downloaded to the profile/account folder).\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*My sources of information seem to be rather outdated (see above). I am not sure whether editing prefs.js file was required.\n\n*It would be fine if someone who is engaged in development of Thunderbird could answer my question and tell the world what is the right procedure to organize the profile sharing between several instances of Thunderbird running on Windows and Linux (possibly, running simultaneously).\n\n*What if the mail is downloaded from the IMAP server and stored in the profile folder?\n\n*What if some instances of Thunderbird use extensions (Lightning) but the other don't?\n\n*What if some instances of Thunderbird are running under different user IDs (i.e. the profile folder is shared between several users on Linux systems)? What steps in terms of chmod / chown / chgrp are required in this case?\n\n\nIn my opinion all these questions need to be answered if we are going to use Ubuntu Touch with Thunderbird on a mobile device accessing Thunderbird profile stored in the cloud (Ubuntu One?)/ NAS server. (Please correct me if I am wrong)\nThank you.\n\nA: You don't. Thunderbird profiles are not meant to be shared across operating systems, or with other users.

My system is a Toshiba Satellite L75D-A7280, and I have tried two different files that I had downloaded from Ubuntu.com with no luck.\nMy laptop came with Windows 8 and following the dual-boot directions Ubuntu 12.04 was installed and worked perfect, except for completely obliterating Windows 8 and voiding my warranty, meaning neither Toshiba nor the retail center I bought my system from can help me legally, besides giving advice... nor can I return it to get a non-UEFI based system.\nI really need to figure this out, I am a student and need my laptop working properly with any OS I put on it.

From there, I installed normally.\nI did not immediately get the black screen, but my wifi didn't work while my ethernet did.\nTo fix the wifi problem, follow the checked answer from my question.\nNow, the only two things that're missing as far as I'm aware are the battery drivers and video drivers.\nUsing the technique described in the link above as well as this to make sure your boot mount isn't clogged, you want to to use at least kernel 3.10.10 to fix the battery issue (this also made most hotkeys work more correctly).\nTo install the video drivers, follow this answer, BUT FIRST BE SURE TO APPLY THE PATCH IN THE CHECKED ANSWER HERE!!!  I use Catalyst 13.8 BETA, but BETA2 is out; however, BETA2 still requires the patch.\nI haven't tried to upgrade to 13.10 myself because I'm running cinnamon, and I'd heard there were many problems, but my guess is that upgrading to 13.10 from 13.04 with only the changes above should be ok.\nIf not, I'm sure another answer can help with that part (or I'll be back when I have the time to attempt a failed upgrade reinstall).\n\nA: \nMy laptop came with Windows 8 and following the dual-boot directions Ubuntu 12.04 was installed and worked perfect, except for completely obliterating Windows 8 and voiding my warranty, meaning neither Toshiba nor the retail center I bought my system from can help me legally\n\nI wouldn't take any claim that installing Linux voids a warranty sitting down. At a minimum, I'd read the warranty myself, and possibly consult an attorney on the matter. On cursory inspection, the 1-year Toshiba warranty here does not cover software, but also does not explicitly say that use of third-party software voids any other aspect of the warranty. I am most definitely not an attorney, but I do know that there are laws that prohibit warranties from being voided for using third-party products (such as third-party oil filters in cars), and it's entirely possible that such a law would apply to third-party software in computers. Of course, you might not want to sue Toshiba over the matter, but if they're denying a warranty claim, the mere threat of a lawsuit might cause them to cave in. Furthermore, I've heard many tales of retail clerks who make ridiculous and erroneous claims to the effect that installing Software X will void a computer's warranty. When called on this, the clerks are invariably proven wrong by manufacturers' agents who actually know what they're talking about.\n\nnor can I return it to get a non-UEFI based system.\n\nThese days, there are few or no non-EFI systems being sold, so even if you return the computer, you'll have to exchange it for another EFI-based system.\nThe problem you're experiencing can almost certainly be resolved without resorting to the warranty; however, it's unclear precisely what your problem is. If Windows was truly overwritten, you'll need to obtain a Windows recovery disc -- at least, assuming you want Windows installed on the computer. You can probably buy such a disc from Toshiba. (Manufacturers have gotten extraordinarily cheap; they no longer ship recovery media with their computers.) Alternatively, see here for options on obtaining legal copies online.\nIt's entirely possible that Windows has not been overwritten, though; it could be that it's just a question of the Windows boot loader being overwritten or not being launched from GRUB. In this case, you might need to run a Windows recovery disc to restore the boot loader, or simply reconfigure GRUB.\nIf you don't care about Windows and just want to get Ubuntu up and running, there are numerous questions on this site that cover this topic, such as this one and this one. There are also lots of pages outside of this site that cover this topic, such as this one that I wrote.\nIn any event, more information is needed before more specific advice can be given. I recommend you run the Boot Info Script from Linux. (Use a live CD, if necessary.) This will produce a file called RESULTS.txt. Post it to a pastebin site and post the URL that it spits out here.

Is there any documentation available which explains what goes, and what doesn't go, into the 'persistence' area of a disk? In particular, I'm after knowing how to free space in the area as I'm forever getting 'space shortage' messages. \nThe context is that I've installed 12.04 LTS on a USB3 stick with 64Gb of space, using the Startup Disk Creator. I'm doing this because my hard disk boot sector is knackered, and I can't boot up Windoze, so I have to run Ubuntu from USB or DVD. I set the persistent area to its max size of 4Gb, and it's loaded as the volume /cow (which got me scratching my head as to the name). df reports that it's over 90% used. I've installed some 430Mb of updates, which I'd thought would write to the main system volume, but perhaps has gone into the persistent area. I've also installed a few utilities which almost certainly have gone into there. \nThe 'meta-context' is that I'm trying to gain control of Ubuntu after a couple of years away from Linux.\n\nA: Everything that you write/install goes to the persistent storage.  It's entire purpose for existing is to allow you to write files and keep them when you reboot, since otherwise they would be kept in ram and lost on shutdown.\n\nA: You can have persistence as a casper-rw file with max 4GB or a casper-rw partition with space only limited by the size of the drive, (Use ext filesysten).\nYou can also have persistence as a 4GB home-rw file or unlimited ext partition.\nThe same thing generally goes into casper-rw in a persistent install as goes into \"/\" partition in a Full install and into home-rw file as goes into \"/home\" partition in a Full install.\nI have tried but never succeeded in saving proprietary drivers, (Nvidia, ATI), (and something else, that I can't remember right now but will edit this post later).\nEdit:\nYou also can not save kernel updates with a persistent install.\n", "Q: Lost windows Partition Reinstalling Ubuntu I updated Ubuntu 13.10 and my wireless and ethernet connections stopped working.

Typing English uses the Dvorak layout as I expect.\nThis just worked for me in the past to the point where I stopped paying attention to what the underlying IME is and I don't recall any special steps other then choosing my keyboard layout and enabling Japanese.\nAny help would be appreciated!\n\nA: Here's how I fixed my problem:\nI looked in /usr/bin for all ibus related programs (ls /usr/bin/ibus*).\nI saw \"ibus-setup\" and ran it.\nIn the 詳細 tab under キーボードレイアウト I checked システムキーボードレイアウトを使用する。\n(Did I mention I installed Ubuntu localized for Japanese?)\nThere's nothing in the system settings that brings up this dialog, is it hidden somewhere or am I just missing something?\n", "Q: How to install or run Ubuntu on Windows 8 using WUBI? Okay, so I have a Windows 8.1 PC, an ASUS X202E-DB21T. It has 500 GB of HDD. I want to use Ubuntu so that I can build a Firefox OS build, but Windows is not supported. I don't want to install Ubuntu directly. Wubi might help but it says Win 8 is not compatible.\nHow can I do this? Also, if I do install it, can I use my tablet as a USB stick? I don't want to buy a USB Stick. I could erase all of the SDCard data and put the .iso file there and boot from there.\n\nA: Wubi is no longer supported. I would very much recomend that you not try that. \nA much better way is to install Virtual box (virtual machine software from Oracle which is free). That works really well in Windows. Then you can install Ubuntu on that.\nThat will give you the added benefit of making snapshots of your Ubuntu environment and roll back to those if you messed things up\nHope that helps\n", "Q: Can `add-apt` be used for Github repos? Can add-apt be used for Github repos?\nI know that this adds a ppa from launchpad:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js\n\nI would like to use a Github repository instead of launchpad. Is this possible?\nHow?\n\nA: Debian package repositories (which are what PPAs are, but with specific packages in them for Ubuntu releases, and not Debian itself) are not the same as git repos.  You can't use a git repo for an apt repository.\nThe main reason for this is because git uses a special server designed to work with source code, and not binary packages.  An apt repository server can be set up with a package manager backend and almost any web server, and is specifically designed to work with binary packages.\n\nA: You can create a Github repository to host your .deb packages and the accompanying files like Packages, Release, etc.\nYou create all the needed files locally, and then git push them to Github.\nThis page explains it in detail: Hosting your own PPA repository on GitHub\n", "Q: \"Failed to fetch\" 404 Not Found, why? hdaf@neoLaptop:~$ sudo apt-get update\n[sudo] password for hdaf: \nIgn http*//extras.ubuntu.com saucy InRelease\nIgn

Partitioning works perfectly with those tools also standard formatting work like a charm but for really advanced options you only have the commandline tools.\nStandard on Linux is mk2fs for building (formatting) ext2/3/4 filesystems.\nThe amount of options is quite large, including options for blocksize (AUS), journalling, inodesize, presets, superblocks, trim/discard etc. etc. etc.\nUse the command mkntfs for building (formatting) NTFS filesystem.\nAgain, a lot of options are possible here.\nType man mkntfs for an explanation how to use it.\n", "Q: Is this a b43 driver problem?

The two most general issues were that it cut my WiFi speed in half, giving me speed test results of 15Mbps when I should have 30Mbps. The second issue were that it took 30-50 seconds to connect after boot or suspend.\nBoth issues are resolved after installing the new bcmwl-kernel-source module.\nSo far the new module has worked perfectly!\n", "Q: Empty Disk when trying to install dual-boot system I recently purchased an SSD to speed up my computer experience. Before, I had Windows 7 and Ubuntu in a dual-boot system. The plan was to install Windows 8 on the SSD and then set aside ~30GB for the system files of Ubuntu.\nI installed Windows 8 just fine on the SSD, then I booted the Ubuntu install CD to make my partitions like always - but GParted tells me the entire SSD is unallocated. Now I am afraid I will lose my Windows installation if I try to do anything to it.\nWhy does GParted think there is no partition on the SSD? Shouldn't it be 4 Partitions, like the Windows installer told me?\nAnd is it possible to ignore this and install Ubuntu on the hard disk (where it, frankly, already is) and somehow make it possible to install GRUB on the SSD to revert my dual-boot system without damaging the installed Win8?\n\nA: This symptom is usually caused by one of two problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Leftover software RAID data -- If the disk had been (or is being) used with software RAID, leftover RAID data can confuse the Ubuntu installer. You can usually fix this problem by typing sudo dmraid -E -r /dev/sda; however, you should be very sure that you're not currently using software RAID. If you erase RAID data when the system is actually using RAID, the result can be problems accessing your disk at all.\n\n*A damaged partition table -- The libparted library (upon which the Ubuntu installer relies) is extremely sensitive to partition table problems. If any exist, it usually reports the disk as being empty. My FixParts program (part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu) will correct many of these problems in an automatic or semi-automatic mannger; see its Web page for details. Other problems may require more specialized and manual repairs. If you think this is the source of the problem and if FixParts can't fix it or if you're wary of using FixParts, post the output of sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda. (Add four spaces to the beginning of each line of that output to preserve columnar output.) If the disk uses GPT rather than MBR partitions, type sudo sgdisk -v /dev/sda and post the output here. (Both FixParts and sgdisk are part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu.)\n\n", "Q: No sound 12.04 (Dummy output) Its been weeks with no sound.

Now I have 64Bits Ubuntu 13.04 and I have Virtual Box with 13.04 32bits on the same machine. How reliable is the file produced by Virtuabox? Can it be uploaded for customers to use it?\nI currently have no other machine (its coming and so it will finally sort out, but meanwhile I need to get it sorted for now)\nHow reliable is Virtual machine binaries especially when run on native machine?\nI have posts like this to make me worry a bit! https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8916145/c-doubles-precision-virtual-machines-and-gcc\n\nA: Your concerns are overestimated:\n\nUpgrading virtualbox to version 4.1.8r75467 resolved the issue.\n\nUbuntu have more than 3 years and VirtualBox is 2 (3?) versions ahead. So, there shouldn't be problems.\n\nBTW, you don't need a 32-bit machine to compile 32-bits binaries, since Ubuntu supports multiarch, you only need to install the 32-bit counter-part of the libraries, example:\nYou need to compile something using openssl in 32 and 64 bits, you can use export CFLAGS=-m32 or -m32 (depends the compiler, I'm using gcc), but, what about the libraries? Install them using :i386 in apt\n sudo apt-get install openssl-dev:i386\n gcc -m32 -o program program.c\n\nThat will produce your 32-bit program in a 64-bit system.\nRelated:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/q/1272357/792066\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/a/359184/169736\n", "Q: How to change the framerate of a video without reencoding I'm trying to change the framerate of an MP4 video (it's a 120fps GoPro video, I want to play it back at 30fps for a slow-motion effect).\nI'm using avconv for this:\navconv -i SourceMovie.mp4 -vf setpts=4.0*PTS -r 30 DestMovie.mp4\n\nThat technically works, but it reencodes the movie. In addition to being slow, it's obviously a quality issue. Technically there should be a way to just set the fps in the header of video, how can I change that? (Any tool other than avconv would work too.)\n\nA: Changing framerate in the header of the video(container) has no effect on the videostream (or audiostream) itself. Reencoding is the only option.\nVideostreams have timestamps and in most video's the frames are interdependent to each other due to interframe compression. Some players can speed up and slow down the video but not by embedded commands or something. No player can change the framerate on the fly when a containercommand asks to do so. The videofile will end up out of specification (i.e. not following the standards) and 99.9% of the players will refuse to comply to it. It is quite impossible to do what you want without recoding. Of course you can wait with recoding until the last step in your editing.\n\nA: In the event that your major intent is to play it in slow motion, and not to keep the file as MP4, you can use MKVmerge GUI tool to remux it into a Matroska container which can easily change the framerate. Remuxing is much better than reencoding, because it only changes the metadata, and not the stream itself.\nFirst you install the package\nsudo apt-get install mkvtoolnix-gui\n\nThen you start MKVmerge GUI. You'll be faced with a window like this\n\nSimply press add button and select your file or even just drag-n-drop the file into \"Input files\" area. At this point you should be able to select the video stream in your video. You can also delete other streams, since they will just get in the way anyhow.\nAfter you've selected it you should see the bottom tabs becoming active:\n\nChange to \"Format specific actions\"\n\nYou can see that there is a field \"FPS\", where you can input the value of frames per second. It looked like you were planning to slow things down four times, so about 7 frames per second would be your goal. You can also use \"Stretch by\" option.\nAfter that you can just change the name of the output file (if you want) and press \"Start muxing\".\nThe program will run and you should have your file.\n\nA: I also wanted to lossless slow down of my 120 FPS movies to 30 FPS. I made script which does it by changing sound tempo and modifying FPS directly in MP4 container.

You can now create an mp4 file with whichever supported framerate you would like (30 in this example):\nMP4Box -add test_track1.h264:fps=30 -new DestMovie.mp4\n\nMP4Box is part of the gpac package, so make sure it's installed.\n", "Q: How to add the GRUB password protection to the OS load process instead of when editing boot options This is the current content of my grub.conf file.\n# grub.conf generated by anaconda\n#\n# Note that you do not have to rerun grub after making changes to this file\n# NOTICE:  You have a /boot partition.

(You'll probably need to install gdisk from a package of the same name.)\nAssuming that your Boot Repair log is accurate and up-to-date, my guess is that you've got a boot loader problem, not a partition problem. Your description of the nature of this problem is unclear, though. Broadly speaking, several solutions commonly work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Secure Boot -- You mentioned disabling \"safeboot\" in your question, so if you meant Secure Boot you've probably already done this. If not, though, see this brief description for some general information. Unfortunately, details vary greatly between computers.\n\n*Update your firmware -- Check with the manufacturer for any available firmware updates. These can fix bugs, which are rampant in the EFI world. I recommend doing this before trying the next two options; or if you put it off, try rEFInd and/or Boot Repair again after updating the firmware.\n\n*Test (and perhaps install) rEFInd -- My rEFInd boot manager can often help. You can try the USB flash drive or CD-R image (available from the rEFInd downloads page) without making any changes to your computer. If that boots both Linux and Windows, installing the Debian package in rEFInd should fix the problem. (A caveat, though: Some HPs have known EFI bugs that may require jumping through some extra hoops to get rEFInd to launch automatically. See here for details.)\n\n*Use Boot Repair -- Boot Repair can often fix boot problems; however, since you've already tried it and it didn't help, I wouldn't hold out too much hope. One additional thing is worth trying, though: Click the Advanced option and check the box to rename and replace the Windows boot loader file. This is helpful on buggy EFIs, such as some HPs are known to have, that refuse to launch boot loaders except from the filename that Windows uses for its boot loader.\n\n", "Q: Custom Russian Phonetic Keyboard I tried to custom Russian phonetic keyboard through Terminal.

How do I do it?  Thanks\n\nA: Although the answer from the original author is correct, I think it is better to explain why the mv command listed in the question does not work. \nThe problem is a basic misunderstanding on the way in which a Unix shell works --- which is quite different form DOS command line. The special characters (*, ?, etc.) which select multiple files (they are called 'glob') works at the level of the shell, not of the commands. So the first command is expanded by the shell to \nmv x54y56.dat x57y58.dat x59y60.dat \"some prefix - *\"\n\nI am supposing that in the directory you have just this three files for sake of simplicity, and that you have no file which matches the name of \"some prefix - \" pattern --- so that the shell will probably let it as is. (I am using the quotes to embed spaces, I find it more easily readable than backlashes, although the fine details are in the manual for your shell). \nNow, mv a b c d will try to move the files a, b, c to the directory d, and failing --- because d does not exist. \nThe rename solution, if you have the rename command, is the Right One. As the OP found, \nrename 's//some prefix - /' *.dat\n\nworks ok. In the old good days, you where supposed to do \nfor i in *.dat; do\n  mv \"$i\" \"some prefix - $i\"\ndone\n\nto just do one move at time. \n\nA: rename 's//some prefix - /' *.dat\n\nThis uses regex-type syntax to rename all files with the specified extension (.dat) in one line.  It handles spaces easily, as it takes any characters encapsulated by the /\n\nA: mv x54y65.dat \"some prefix - x54y65.dat\"\n\n", "Q: How to refresh display on Ubuntu 12.04 So does Ubuntu 12.04 have the windows equivalent to the \"connect to projector\" key functionality.

(also handbrake is a good one but i never came to terms with it )\n\nA: In case you are looking for something graphical, you can consider using mkvtoolnix-gui package. It actually depends on the command line utility, but it will execute the command with all the needed options for you.\n\nThe first thing that you'll need to do is to add the files containing all the needed streams. You do that (obviously) by pressing add button and selecting the file or by dragging your files into the \"Input files\" area. You should not use append button, unless your intention is to place the contents of one file after the contents of another (making the final file's duration the sum of all the appended ones).\nSince you are saying you are planning to just convert .avi files, then you should simply add one file at the time. Note that the first file that you will add will automatically set the name of the output file, it will match the input name, but the extension will be changed to .mkv. You can of course change that if you wish.\nAfter you add something you will be able to change the parameters of the streams (such as the assigned language, whether the track is \"on\" by default, and whether a user can chose to disable this stream all together if one wishes.\nYou can give the title for the stream. I suggest that if you have multi-audio video that you use that together with the language. For example you can have \"original\" or \"single-voice dub\" or \"director's commentary\" for the track names. Many players will show you these when you select the stream to play, and it is very useful. Try not to repeat the information there, however. There is no reason to write \"English language\" when you can just set the track's language code.\nThere are also some specific options, which will depend upon which stream you are working on.\n\nSometimes you may wish to add some attachments to your file. If you add an image, many file managers will display this picture as the icon for the final video file. If you are muxing some sort of film, and you happen to have the cover for it, it may be a good choice to put it in as the attachment.\n\nFinally in the Global tab you are able to set the metadata for the whole file. The most common thing is to set the title. It will be prefilled by the data taken from the first file that you have added to the \"Input files\".\nYou can also add chapter information. Mkvmerge is able to read ogm chapter file as well as xml chapters. It also allows you to edit chapter files, but keep in mind that this tab functions as a separate application, so you won't be editing chapters that are added to your output file, you will need to save them in that tab, and then add them as the input to the file you are now muxing.\nThe interesting feature of mkvmerge gui is the \"Copy to clipboard\" which copies the exact terminal command that the application is planning to run. If you intend to mux many files you can set one up, just the way you like it, then copy the command to clipboard and make a bash script that does all the files you want at once.\n\nA: Avidemux is a free video editor designed for simple cutting, filtering and encoding tasks.

No error or warning was shown.\nAm I missing something?\nNote : my gcc is the new one, it should has no problem. \n\nA: Here is the output, of your program:\n\nThe text from printf (\"test\"); is printed and you can see it before the line shubham@shubham-pc:~$\nSince there is no \\n in your program, a newline is not printed at end and hence the default line of console gets printed after it\nTo solve this your program should look like:\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n    printf(\"%s \\n\",\"test\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nThe thing I've done here is that, I used a format string (%s) to print test and added a newline (\\n) after it.\nHere is the output after the edits:\n\n", "Q: Media keys play/pause globally worked in 12.10, not in 13.10 Laptop media keys\nOn Asus n55sf laptop, there are a dedicated keys for volume up, volume down, mute, [play/pause], stop, launch (plus a dozen Fn-key combinations). \nIn 12.10 most worked.\n(Overall is seems unrelated to desktop environment used, stating it for the sake of completeness.)\nOn Ubuntu 12.10 under XFCE they just worked. That is: when a player like rhythmbox or totem was started, it would alternate between play and pause. \nInterestingly, if several were started, they would alternate independently. E.g. use mouse to pause rhythmbox, launch totem, and one hit on [play/pause] key would pause one and resume the other.\nKeys Next,Previous and Stop worked as expected in any program.\nIn 13.10 most still work, but play/skip related ignored.\nOn Xubuntu 13.10 (XFCE too) the volume keys work but the [play/pause], stop, next and prev are ignored. Not tried regular Ubuntu 13.10 (Unity).\nSearch before you ask\nHere are a few facts:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Hotkeys/Architecture is ummutable and mentions Ubuntu 9.10. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Hotkeys/Troubleshooting is also outdated as it mentions /usr/share/doc/udev/README.keymap.txt which no longer exists.\n\n*On 12.10 and 13.10 versions, at XFCE level (as visible by xfconf-query or using xfce4-settings-manager) there are a couple of shortcut for keys like XF86Calculator or XF86TouchpadToggle but nothing related to volume prev/next/play/stop, which is okay.\n\n*XF86Audio substring doesn't appear in /etc (which is normal)\n\n*Kernel-level test: \"showkey -s\" on console shows that keys Next,Play/Pause,Previous,Stop are keycodes 163,164,165,166. Nothing relevant in /etc about that.\n\n*Reports https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/udev/+bug/1072371 and https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd/+bug/1012365 suggest to adjust at udev level.\n\n*Alas, the udev tutorials I found ( e.g. https://wiki.debian.org/udev ) don't even mention keyboard.\n\n*A thread in french seems to deal with a similar issue: https://forum.ubuntu-fr.org/viewtopic.php?id=1395051. sudo evtest /dev/input/event3, in X as well as on plain console, reports events on key pressed and repeats, but nothing when pressing those media keys.

Something else ?\n\n*Any other hint ?\n\n\nA: Summary: sort-of solution.\nKeys and rhythmbox (default Ubuntu 13.10 music player)\nAs a workaround I was considering to manually set specific events using XFCE shortcut keys facility.\nSo, I tried rhythmbox-client and observed that it failed to remote control rhythmbox as described on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rhythmbox/+bug/950743 .\nAs indicated there, \"the problem was solved by enabling MPRIS D-Bus Interface plugin in rhythmbox\", which in practice boiled down to :\nsudo apt-get install rhythmbox-plugins\n\nand restarting rhythmbox.\nAnd then ... the four keys ([play/pause], stop, next and prev) that were ignored now just work.\nSo, the bug was not at lower levels but just the fact that the \"MPRIS D-Bus interface\" was unavailable.\nKeys and gmusicbrowser (default Xubuntu 13.10 music player)\nKeys did not work immediately with gmusicbrowser.\nThe symptoms are described on http://xubuntugeek.blogspot.com/2011/11/use-multimedia-keys-with-gmusicbrowser.html with a workaround.\nThey don't mix\nKeys work with rhythmbox. If launching gmusicbrowser, it does not receive events.\nQuitting rhythmbox allows gmusicbrowser to receive events.\nQuitting gmusicbrowser does not allow rhythmbox to receive events.\nSo, it now works for simple cases (one music player at a time).\n\nA: if you havent figured out by now (as i found this 3 months later) this might answer your question.\n\n\n*\n\n*go to system settings\n\n*go to keyboard\n\n*click on the shortcuts tab\n\n\ndown in the menu on the left it will say the different options for the different keyboard shortcuts settings there are and has a custom option as well\n\n\n*\n\n*make your selection on the left\n\n*click on what keyboard shortcut you want to make (on the right after you make your selection on the left)\n\n*press the key combination you would like to set\n\n*done\n\n\nlike stated in the answer above; sometimes these \"global\" (system wide) shortcuts do not work for certain things. i.e. maximizing certain media players after they have been launched while they are minimized, and things like vlc media player has its own way to set shortcuts in the settings as it will not work with the global media key shortcuts for some reason .\n", "Q: Is the search bar in desktop Unity 8 really going to be on the right side? I noticed that, at least in the tablet version of Unity 8, the search bar is on the right side of the screen. However, people keep telling that the desktop version will come afterwards, so I don't know if that's the intended place for it to be across versions. I hope not, because it's a major UI problem.\nThis is the way Windows 8 does it, and it's terrible, because as you type on it (on the right side), the results appear on the left side, so your eyes have to move across the screen all the time, especially if your screen is a large one.\nI know one can ask \"but isn't that where search bars have been all along? Firefox and Windows Explorer etc.\nWell, not quite. On these programs, it's intended that you finish your search key and then type Enter and only so look for the results. Unity's search bar, however, shows results dynamically, so you always want to look at the results, so you know if you can press Enter without having to write the whole sentence, and you also want to look at what you're typing, so you know there are no typos.\nThat being said, I wanted to know if this is really where the search bar will be and if it will not spread across the top part of the screen (that would be a good solution, since \"Home Scope\" and other scope titles don't need to be showing when you're typing). If that's final, then I will fill a bug.\n\nA: I think the idea is that Unity will adapt itself to the different sort of screen it is running on and will change the location of the search text area so it is different on a phone and a laptop.\n", "Q: How to change wireless password from text mode?

When you press only the the Fn key, this doesn't send any data to the computer and for this reason xev can't detect it.\nAccording with this post, in general there is no way to know that Fn was pressed and the keycode of key-combinations including Fn depends on the individual keyboard design.  \nSo unfortunately, you can't remap it to another key.\nMore about: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fn_key.\n", "Q: Creating File 1c9e:98ff for VKOM 3G Modem In order to install this i need to first create the above file, and well being new to Ubuntu, I do not know how, a step by step guide will be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: Presumably you need to create a file with additional content (see you installation guide for details). \nYou can easily do that by opening a text editor, which would be Gedit in you default installation.

Is there anyway to prevent a process from being killed no matter what? I know about nice but I'm not sure if giving a task such as a long running memory-intensive rake task the highest priority will prevent it from being killed off:\nnice -n -20 rake xyz\n\nEdit: The original poster most likely wants it to be high priority even if the server is low on resources as well, so much so that other processes get killed first.\n\nA: Why would it be killed off?\nBecause it's not automatic that something is killed. Once you answer that, and explain why something would be selected for destruction, you might be able to come up with a solution.\nGiven you're talking about Rails' rake command, I'm guessing that this is a process running on a server. That you're worried about it being killed suggests it's being killed by the server host for using too many resources. In cases like this, there aren't (nor should there be) ways of stopping your process for being killed.\nIf you have a resource-expensive task, buy more resources. Use your own server time. Or come to an arrangement with the host that allows you to run it on their dime.\n\nA: You can not prevent root from killing a process. Or for that matter: you can not prevent the server from killing a process that eats up all your resources.\nWhat you can do is fork the command so it restarts itself when killed.\nExample using code: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/a/6538718/2920227\n\nA: Now, I understand this is an old question, but since both answers ignore the obvious - or at best scratch the surface -, I felt prompted to write up my own. Given the wording of the question the very first thing that popped into my mind was \"the OOM killer!\". One of the other answers even makes the claim \"it's not automatic that something is killed\" which is preposterous from the user perspective. What is the OOM killer if not an automatism?\nThe OOM killer is your biggest enemy for scenarios like the one described, as the linked article will show.\nNow it depends what the exact scenario is (build machine, some server ...), but in general I do want my OS to use the resources of my machine to the extent possible. That's why I purchased those in the first place.\nYour question, broken down:\n\nIs there anyway to prevent a process from being killed no matter what?\n\nNo, fortunately not. For example the kernel will kill misbehaving processes (e.g. by sending SIGSEGV). This will also apply if your task misbehaves on account of running into resource limits (see limits.conf, getrlimit/setrlimit). That is, if something inside your rake task (which in all likelihood will use other processes to do some work) dereferences a null pointer, you're still out of luck and that part will fail, which subsequently may fail the task.\nRoot will also in all likelihood be able to send signals to your process. And even if you somehow managed to protect your process from anything related to userspace, root would still be able to load a kernel module and undermine those efforts from kernel (perhaps with the exception of an active kernel lockdown).\n\nI know about nice but I'm not sure if giving a task such as a long running memory-intensive rake task the highest priority will prevent it from being killed off: [...]\n\nIt won't prevent it, but it will be used as one of several heuristics for the OOM killer. So yeah, actually the nice value will help ... a bit. The LWN article which I already linked above gives the following heuristics:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*if the task has nice value above zero, its score doubles\n  \n*superuser or direct hardware access tasks (CAP_SYS_ADMIN, CAP_SYS_RESOURCE or\n  CAP_SYS_RAWIO) have their score divided by 4. This is cumulative,\n  i.e., a super-user task with hardware access would have its score\n  divided by 16.\n  \n*if OOM condition happened in one cpuset and checked\n  task does not belong to that set, its score is divided by 8.\n  \n*the resulting score is multiplied by two to the power of oom_adj (i.e.\n  points <<= oom_adj when it is positive and points >>= -(oom_adj)\n  otherwise)\n  \n\nAside from the nice value you can also go further by either running this as root (or with the given capabilities) or, if you are root, you could make sure your process won't be prone to being killed by the OOM killer by (the article has the full details) creating a cgroup:\n\n\n*\n\n*mount -t cgroup -o oom oom /mnt/oom-killer\n\n*mkdir /mnt/oom-killer/invincibles\n\n*echo 0 > /mnt/oom-killer/invincibles/oom.priority\n\n*echo <pid> > /mnt/oom-killer/invincibles/tasks, where <pid> is the process ID of your rake task ...\n\n\nSo there you go. You can make certain groups of processes exempt from the OOM killer's wrath.\nHowever, I am not sure this sledgehammer method is the first best thing to do. I think you should start by tinkering with oom_adj to see whether that helps your process survive the competition with other processes. Especially if this is a server, the overall service may be more important than a particular task which may not even be vital to the service. So use with caution. In addition you may want to monitor for memory hogs (sysstat and friends should help). If you do thta via a time series database and plot the graphs, you may even catch on to memory leaks.\nIf none of that works, you should head over to Brendan Gregg's website and start measuring different performance indicators; also see if you can grab one of his books. For example it's possible you do have something like a runaway situation in regards to memory allocations inside your rake task.

When connecting to the web interface, I followed the instructions:\n\n*\n\n*I created the superuser;\n\n*I clicked on the \"Import Boot Images\" of the cluster controller.\n\nNothing happened. So I logged on the Ubuntu server and ran the command maas-cli maas node-groups import-boot-images. Nothing happened (except a message saying that it started).\nBy nothing happened, I mean that several hours later, I still have the web interface telling me that there are no boot images. And no idea what happened because I have no idea where I could eventually find a log file/message.\nFrom a fresh Ubuntu 13.10 Server + MAAS install, I execute the following commands as specified in the manual:\n$ sudo maas createsuperuser\n$ maas-cli login maas http:///MAAS/api/1.0 4a7ehDMkZWStdmSCmX:KaYPpAuL5wWJmJtamr:A5JLyz8WLnwaHcPKGzJxqJ73mqYe5tns\nYou are now logged in to the MAAS server at ... blablabla...\n$ maas-cli maas node-groups import-boot-images\nImport of boot images started on all cluster controllers\n$ ps -ae | grep maas\n\nAnd there is nothing to see there... The MAAS page on the server still claims that there are no boot images imported.\n\nA: Take a look at /var/log/maas/celery.log to make sure the import task starts and does not immediately stop with an error of some kind. From my experience, import-boot-images won't succeed if the MAAS Cluster Controller does not have access to the Internet, or if the DHCP/DNS configuration on the VM network is not properly configured.\nOnce you see no errors after running maas-cli maas node-groups import-boot-images in the celery.log file, you can check with ps -ae | grep maas to see - the import process should be running.\n\nA: Not sure if you're still working on this. I am currently trying to figure maas out, and it's a pain in the ass.\nTo see if the download is still working, check the output of:\nps -ae | grep maas\n\nI got:\n2608 ?        00:01:36 maas-import-eph\n\nWhat this is doing is pulling from maas.ubuntu.com/images/ephemeral These images are about 300M and there are a couple of them for it to download. \nNot sure how many people have been having success setting this up completely.\n", "Q: Accidentally removed a drive shortcut from the Launcher.

Less than a month ago (in October 2013), there was a stable release (Saucy) and now there is one in active development immediately, why is that? Shouldn't development focus on the stable release or both branch/releases will provide the same amount of fixes? What will change in the new development release that can't be imported from the current stable release?\nI've seen a couple of questions, but they ask how to move from development to stable, not within the scope. I'd like an answer, like this one Will the alpha/beta ISO become official after Release?\n\nA: \nLess than a month ago, there was a stable release (Saucy) and right now there is one in active development immediately, why is that?\n\nBecause there's always a development version. As soon as the development version is frozen, people start work on the next version which then becomes the development version. It just ticks over like that every six months. \"+1\" simply refers to the \"next release\".\n\"+1\" is also used to refer to the +2 (etc) when the name isn't know, like \"Trusty+1\" to refer to 14.10.\n\nShouldn't development focus on the stable release or both branch/releases will provide the same amount of fixes?\n\nBut the stable release is released. By all intents, it's done. It's perfect. The only exceptions to this rule are:\n\n*\n\n*Security updates. This is the major cause for pulling back fixes.\n\n*Browser updates. These used to limited to backporting security fixes but it was deemed more beneficial to pull the entire browser forward.\n\n*Other Stable Release Upgrades where the significance of the fix is deemed worthwhile (and without damage).\n\n*LTS Hardware Enablement stacks. These are bundles of kernels, drivers and X builds that are brought up to the latest stable versions each release so that LTS users can stay mildly updated without changing the rest of the system. This is important given the speed of graphics improvements (and new hardware) these days.\n\nWhat you're describing is a rolling release where stable and development are practically the same thing. That's not how Ubuntu works.\n\nWhat will change in the new development release that can't be imported from the current stable release?\n\nAnything. Everything.\nWith the exception of the list above, nothing changes in a stable release. The idea is to keep a stable release stable and that's done by modifying it as little as possible.\n\nA: \n\"Why is that?\"\n\nThere's a clear difference between adding new features and fixing bugs. The first is \"development\" and the second applies to a \"stable\" release. The stable release wouldn't be very stable if all the development happening on e.g. Ubuntu Touch and Mir landed on users' installed systems.\nThat's why, once an Ubuntu version is released as \"stable\", it doesn't get many new features, instead focusing on fixing bugs on the existing packages without necessarily upgrading them to entirely new versions.\nAll new development happens in the \"development\" release, which users are of course free to try, with the warning that bleeding-edge software may appear at any time and possibly break expectations on how the system would behave.\n\nShouldn't development focus on the stable release\n\nQuite the contrary, see explanation above.\nor both branch/releases will provide the same amount of fixes?\n\nA stable release will get only fixes, whereas a development release will get both fixes and new versions/features. \nSee the procedure for accepting a Stable Release Update into the stable release, you will see that a requirement is to have a bug fixed in the development series first, before requesting it be applied to the stable release.

But if powerd is stopped, the device won't suspend using the power button.\nOr you can do this:\n    # Run this in another terminal window and leave it running to\n    # make sure display stays on for the tests:\n    adb shell powerd-cli display on bright\nfrom: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Testing\n\nA: Note: I only tried this in 14.10, but it might also work in previous versions.\nI had a closer look on powerd-cli and it seems that it has an option to disable powersaving:\nsudo powerd-cli active & (Run this command in the Terminal-app on the phone.)\nThis will prohibit that apps are stopped, but the screen can be turned off as usual. (The & is needed so that powerd-cli runs in the background - otherwise powerd-cli runs in the terminal and you couldn't enter any other commands.)\nTo re-enable powersaving enter the command fg and press Ctrl+C.\nFor 16.04 (ubports) repowerd-cli active & can be used.\n\nA: Ther is an app in the store called Active Screen which provides a workaround for these kind of issues. \nIt's nothing more than a switch, that you toggle to tell your screen to stay active.\n", "Q: Dual Boot 2 separate SSD drives?

This may result in device names like /dev/sda and /dev/sdb switching around on each boot, culminating in an unbootable system, kernel panic, or a block device disappearing. Persistent naming solves these issues. \n\nand Debian https://wiki.debian.org/Part-UUID\n\nIf you have more than one disk controller (IDE or especially SCSI/SATA), or even if you just have variable numbers of removable USB/firewire storage devices attached from day to day, the order in which they are detected may not be deterministic. The result is that device names like /dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1 may switch around randomly on each boot. Persistent naming allows you not to worry about this at all. \n\nFor file systems it's best to use UUID (/dev/disk/by-uuid/) or labels (/dev/disk/by-label/). For raw drives or unformatted partitions you can use IDs (/dev/disk/by-id/).\nTo identify your disk/partition, use blkid \nsudo blkid\n\nThe Ubuntu information is here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingUUID\nIt may be best to temporarily remove your windows hard drive while you install Ubuntu, then configure your windows partition(s) to mount post install. You can then select which OS to boot in your BIOS.\n\nA: I believe based on my research that the drive designation comes from the BIOS.  If you can modify your drive settings in the BIOS to change the drive from primary to secondary then you could change sda (primary) to sdb (secondary).  Someone with an Award BIOS that has this ability could confirm.  My install is on a Satellite U845t and modifying that setting isn't possible in the BIOS.  In the end, it doesn't matter if your install is on the primary or secondary drive except when the read/write speeds are considerably different.  I clean installed to /sdb, my SSD drive, and then utilized my platter drive on /sda for storage.\nI'm currently running Ubuntu 20.04 on /dev/sdb (SSD) with /home mounted on /dev/sda (HDD).  You can modify the /home mount point using the terminal but if you are clean installing, select \"Something Other\" and then select the mount points for the install on the desired partitions.\n", "Q: Can 100% root '/' usage affect on network speed? How to safely free space at root? I have ubuntu 12.10 server, used mostly as fileserver + router.

System is installed on software raid0, so, repartitioning will be very difficult, as I consider. \n\n\n*\n\n*Is it like a root of network problems?\n\n*What problems will I face if I tried to do smth like rsync /lib folder to /home/root/lib?\n\n*Can I merge /lib and /home/lib contents and then mount latter to /lib?\n\nP.S. I wonder, how it occured. When I'm partitioning my disk, I thought, that all programms will be instaled at /home, or at user folders, which i made big enought… Where can I read about what partitions are used for what programms? \nedited:\nAt site I found:\n\"The directories /bin, /lib, and /etc should never be separate partitions!  At boot time, only / is mounted initially.  The init program needs to access files in /etc and the bootup scripts need access to commands in /bin, which may depend on files in /lib.  Kernel modules required to complete the boot process are also kept in /lib.\n\"\nSo, i can't move /lib to another partition.\nCan I clear it or smth else?\n/lib/modules contains:\n3.5.0-17-generic  3.5.0-26-generic  3.5.0-30-generic  3.5.0-34-generic  3.5.0-40-generic\n3.5.0-23-generic  3.5.0-27-generic  3.5.0-31-generic  3.5.0-37-generic  3.5.0-41-generic\n3.5.0-25-generic  3.5.0-28-generic  3.5.0-32-generic  3.5.0-39-generic  3.5.0-42-generic\n\nDo I need all this files?\n\nA: It seems plausible that your fifteen installed kernels are consuming too much space on your root (/) filesystem. You can remove these with the dpkg command, at least assuming you can boot up and log in. Use the -P option, as in:\nsudo dpkg -P linux-image-3.5.0-17-generic\n\nRemove the oldest of your kernels (unless you're having problems with newer ones, in which case you should remove the least reliable ones).\nYou may also want to track down where space is being used via the du command, as in:\ndu -sx /* | sort -n\n\nNote that this will take a while to run, but it may generate some errors before it finishes. Ignore the errors. The command will generate a sorted list of directories according to how much space they consume, with the biggest ones at the bottom of the list. You can then move into the larger of those directories, as in:\ndu -sx /var/* | sort -n\n\nThis example will show subdirectories of /var according to disk space used. When you discover where you disk space is being consumed, research the directory or directories in question, or perhaps the individual files that are taking up so much space. Some might be legitimately consuming lots of space, such as a mail spool if the computer is functioning as a mail server. Others might be filled with temporary files (like most files in /tmp), or might have files that have grown too large (like bloated log files in /var/log). Each of these problems must be dealt with in its own way.\nBeyond this, your partitions are mis-sized. Linux places most program files in /usr, but this directory/partition seldom needs more than about 10GB of space, and often half or less of that. On most systems, these files seldom change, aside from during package updates or installations. Some other subdirectories of the root (/) partition, though, contain temporary or dynamic files, such as /tmp (used for temporary files, which can often be big) and log files in /var/log. Thus, it's often wise to create significant extra space in the root (/) partition. In fact, it's common to leave /usr as a regular subdirectory of the root (/) partition and make the latter something between 10-30GB.\nThe /home directory holds user files. It seldom holds program files, with the possible exception of software the individual users write themselves. On most desktop systems, /home will be relatively large, since it will hold digital photos, MP3s, MPEGs or other audio/video files, disk image files, and so on. These can all be quite large. Details vary from one computer to another, though.\n\nA: Your best bet for freeing up space is to remove old kernel versions that you no longer need.  To do so, follow this excellent and extensive guide in a previous answer (please visit and upvote):\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/100953/130555\nThis includes shell methods as well as graphical methods for removing the old versions.  Please be aware of the recommendation (which I agree with) to keep 2 or 3 of the older revisions around.  The updates are well tested, but you always want to be able to fall back to your previous running versions if something goes wrong.\n", "Q: LAMP Server with multiple PHP Versions I am looking for a way to install multiple versions of PHP on my notebook to work on different projects that require different versions of PHP.\nI have Ubuntu 13.10 and installed apache2, php5, mysql etc from the repository.

Halp?\n\nA: I'm about to sleep so I apologize in advance for jumping to a conclusion. But the impression I'm getting is that either you are having problems on where to install GRUB 2. Can't tell much, but could you boot your computer via a Linux Live USB (i.e. Ubuntu) and then run GParted, then take a screenshot?\nBelow is not a solution, but an advice to share a personal \"best practice\" when multi-booting:\n\n\n*\n\n*Order of install is all MS Windows OS first (oldest to newest, so in your case install XP first and then Windows 7).\n\n*Last will be your Linux Operating System/s.\n\n*If you are multi-booting, say two (2) MS Windows OS's and two (2) Linux OS's, install the MS Windows OS's as per #1. And then for the Linux OS's, just be reminded that the last Linux OS you install is the one that will take over the \"Bootloader\" (GRUB is an example of a \"bootloader\").\n\n*The best tip that I follow when multi-booting is to learn how to install GRUB 2 in a \"dedicated\" partition.\n\n\nThis way, you avoid the issue where your MS Windows OS \"magically disappeared\"...you can actually check if the MS Windows installation really disappeared or got deleted by booting a Linux Live USB of your choice and then try checking in the File Manager if the MS Windows partition is still there.\nAnd if it's still there, then it narrows down your problem to how the bootloader (i.e. GRUB 2 in Linux) got installed.\nWhen you opt to install GRUB 2 in a \"dedicated\" partition, it frees you from the worry of the bootloader being deleted along with the respective OS partition, or other complex scenarios. At least, the working OS that was installed will boot up properly.\n", "Q: Safe to remove entries in 12.04 sources.list? Recently, every time I have run sudo apt-get update with 12.04 Precise there have been two 404's (note: I don't have the rep to post more than 2 links, so I've removed the 'http://' from the URLs below for the sake of the question):\n\nErr archive.ubuntu.com hardy/universe Sources\n    404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.202 80]\n    Err archive.ubuntu.com hardy/universe i386 Packages\n    404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.92.202 80]\n\nWhen I run the update manager GUI, it always notified me that my last check was stale by X number of days (at the time of writing, the last check was stale by 57 days.  \nSo I commented out the last two entries in my /etc/apt/sources.list, which are:\n\n## For legacy gcc\n     deb archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ hardy universe\n     deb-src archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ hardy universe\n\n...and the updates run without any problems now (although there wasn't really any noticeable negative effects before-hand, just that the errors were concerning me. The red exclamation in the toolbar and associated error message were concerning me too).  \nSo my question is, am I missing out on something important and should I be replacing those hardy URLs I commented out with something else?\n\nA: You can safely remove or comment out (put a # in front of them) the hardy entries. Ubuntu Hardy is over four years old and not supported. So the archive isn't active anymore and thatswhy yu get an 404 error.\n", "Q: How do I see the DNS hint file (root name servers)? According to Wikipedia's article on the address resolution mechanism of DNS there should be a \"hint file\" in my OS somewhere, containing IP addresses of a few \"root name servers\". \nHow do I see this hint file on Ubuntu?\n\nA: You won't find this hint file on every computer. Usually this is only needed when you run a nameserver like BIND, Unbound etc. Those nameservers need the information about the root servers.\nIf you want to find out how such a hint file looks, you can go to ftp://ftp.rs.internic.net/domain/ and download the file db.cache. You also can enter the command\ndig . ns\n\nto get the contents of the hints file.\nWhen you do a DNS query your computer usually asks your /etc/hosts file first. If it doesn't find an answer there, it will ask the nameserver (see contents of /etc/resolv.conf) for an answer. The nameserver will then either have the answer in its cache or ask the root servers and later other nameservers until the right answer arrives. So there is no need for a hint file on your local computer.\n\nA: Most DNS servers are by default configured with a \"root file\" (a.k.a. \"hints file\") pointing to \"legacy root servers\" which are controlled by ICANN.\nThis gives you access to the \"legacy domain name space\" which includes .com, .net, .org, two letter country codes, etc.\nIf the DNS server does not know the address of the requested site, then it will forward the request to another DNS server. In order to do so, the DNS server must know of the IP address of another DNS server that it can forward the request to. This is the job of root hints. Root hints provides a list of IP addresses of DNS servers that are considered to be authoritative at the root level of the DNS hierarchy(also known as root name server).\nThe easiest way as qbi stated n his answer, is using dig. First run dig by itself, and you will get the root.hints according to your designated server. Then ask one of the listed root servers with dig @rootserver. You will note that the output looks similar to a root.hints file. Save it to a file (dig @a.public-root.net . ns >root.hints.new) and replace the old root.hints with it.\nIf you want to go back to the original file, just delete the current file and restart the DNS server. It will automatically regenerate the original.\nSource:Some of the info was obtained from DNS and BIND, 5th Edition\n", "Q: Keyboard layout changes in Ubuntu 13.10 I use a Norwegian keyboard layout in Ubuntu. I did a clean install on my Asus K52F. Every time I turn on the laptop, the layout is set to English (or some other language, I can't really tell). The same thing happens whenever the laptop goes into screensaver mode and I try to log in with my password when prompted. I've searched the forums and Askubuntu, but I haven't found a solution to this problem. Any ideas how to fix this?\n\nA: It could be related to this bug - https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/indicator-keyboard/+bug/1240198. I get similar with everything resetting to English (US) on boot.\nOne workaround appears to be to go into a different vterm and then back again (alt-ctrl-f1 then alt-ctrl-f7).

So I got VirtualBox just for Ubuntu Server, I'm currently Running Ubuntu 12.04 as my main OS. But when I got everything set up in Ubuntu Server 12.04, including my ports forwarded and a test Minecraft server up... I realized that nobody could join my public IP I sent out, not even me! I can connect to the ipv4 address. It acts like I didn't forward my ports. But I forwarded 25565 to Input and Output and they're both TCP and UDP. \n    Is this just a virtual box issue or am I doing something wrong?\n* Using Eth0 wired connection\n\nA: By default, a virtual machine will be set up to NAT networking. This means that VirtualBox acts as a \"virtual router\" that allows the VM to access the internet, but will not allow external users to access the VM properly.\nTo do what you want, you need to set your VM up to use \"bridged\" networking. This way, on the host computer, an interface will be created that will be \"bridged\" to the VM's network interface. Thus, the VM will act, for all intents and purposes, as if it were hooked up to the same network as the host system (down to you needing to configure its IP address as you did for the host system).\nRead here for the different VirtualBox networking modes and what each of them does. http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html.

But since the upgrade to 13.10, whoopsie has grown up quite chatty. I have literally hundreds of messages like that in my logs: \nSYS: Nov  4 14:40:48 samsung-romano whoopsie[1156]: online\nSYS: Nov  4 14:41:56  whoopsie[1156]: last message repeated 4 times\nSYS: Nov  4 14:42:56  whoopsie[1156]: last message repeated 2 times\nSYS: Nov  4 14:43:56  whoopsie[1156]: last message repeated 2 times\nSYS: Nov  4 14:44:56  whoopsie[1156]: last message repeated 2 times\n\n% zgrep whoopsie /var/log/syslog*gz   | wc -l\n773\n\nIs there a way to tell whoopsie to be less verbose? \n(the funny output format is from SLogger, a homemade program to  check system log files I wrote ages ago, but this is basically the content of /var/log/syslog file). \n\nA: Per sokai, there is no way to run whoopsie that prevents it from logging these \"online\" messages -- it's a bug. However, if you want to get them out of your logs, you can drop the following line into /etc/rsyslog.d/00-whoopsie.conf and the messages won't be logged anymore:\n  # whoopsie generates a lot of messages of \"online\"\n  # these are worthless and can be filtered\n  if $programname == 'whoopsie' and $msg == ' online' then ~\n\nThis is pretty specific, too.

After scanning hardware drivers,  I see hda driver with dkms , and it asks if I want to activate it.  I Googled it,  but I can only find a generic description having to do with audio.  Can anyone tell me what specifically it's for,  and if I should activate? \n\nA: The folowing text is mostly copied from:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Audio/UpgradingAlsa/DKMS\nHDA driver is the driver for internal \"HDA Intel\" sound cards (if your computer is from 2005 or newer, you almost certainly have a \"HDA Intel\" sound card for handling internal speakers, headphone jacks and microphones). USB or Bluetooth sound will not be affected.\nDKMS is a method to recompile kernel modules locally whenever the rest of the kernel changes. This means that you do not add a ppa: instead you download the package once and install it, confirm that it fixes your problem, and you're done. When you install a new kernel, as you regularly do if you have the updates repository enabled (this is recommended), DKMS will automatically recompile your existing DKMS package to fit the new kernel.\nYou can use this method if the latest ALSA snapshot works for you currently, and you just want the what's currently the latest (without having to stay updated with newer snapshots). \n\nA: The snd-hda-intel module (or just hda) is for modern onboard sound cards. If you plan on using your onboard audio controller, you should activate the driver. Otherwise, it is not desirable to.\nFrom the kernel docs:\n\nHD-audio is the new standard on-board audio component on modern PCs\n  after AC97.  Although Linux has been supporting HD-audio since long\n  time ago, there are often problems with new machines.  A part of the\n  problem is broken BIOS, and the rest is the driver implementation.\n  This document explains the brief trouble-shooting and debugging\n  methods for the HD-audio hardware.\n\nFurthermore:\n\nAlthough the driver name contains a word of a well-known hardware\n  vendor, it's not specific to it but for all controller chips by other\n  companies.  Since the HD-audio controllers are supposed to be\n  compatible, the single snd-hda-driver should work in most cases.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 - No sound - HELP!

Actually, performing a trim once a month on a regularly used SSD is probably often enough.\nThe need to use trim is much less often than you think.\nNo TRIM:\nIf you have a lot of big files (and very few small files) you might choose for a block size of 512kB (as big as one or several eraseblocks) therefore eliminating the need for trim altogether. As far as my knowledge about NTFS goes, NTFS can't be formatted with blocks larger than 64k but this should be practically sufficient in most cases.\nmkntfs:\nCommand in Ubuntu that can format NTFS with a blocksize that you can specify. As far as I know Windows can't do this but reads and writes happily from/to it.\nFormatting:\nImportant with SSD's is that the partition always begins on an erase block boundary.\nWhile normal read/write blocks are 4k, eraseblocks are often more like 128k 256k 512k. Rule of thumb is to leave a hole of 1MB counted from sector 0.\nPossibly you knew this already, but it might make you choises easier. I wrote this especially with your usage scenario in mind.\n", "Q: How to change the selected item color in Ubuntu 13.10? How do I change the default orange to something else?

I am a new ubuntu user and find it hard to delete fonts that I have installed.\nI anticipate that the problem might be installing font that turns my Firefox browser turned my mail fonts to bold. I experience the same view with firefox and chrome browser. Many of the fonts turned out to be bold.!\n\nA: An easy way to do that is using font manager.  Just press Ctrl+Alt+\nT on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install font-manager\n\nOnce installed, run the program, highlight the fonts that you don't like, and either disable or remove them.  See image below.\n \n\nA: Ubuntu 18\nLaunch a file manager as sugo (e.g. sudo nautilus) and navigate to /usr/share/fonts. Browse through the opentype and especially the truetype directory, and delete fonts you don't want. (If you really dislike the fonts, press Shift+Delete for extra effect :)\n\nAfter deleting, run this command to update the font cache:\n$ fc-cache -fv\n\n\nA: First, determine the font's name you want to delete, example 'Nimbus Sans L'\nThen run the following command in terminal to know where it is:\n$ fc-list \"Nimbus Sans L\"\n/usr/share/fonts/type1/gsfonts/n019063l.pfb: Nimbus Sans L:style=Regular Condensed Italic\n/usr/share/fonts/type1/gsfonts/n019064l.pfb: Nimbus Sans L:style=Bold Condensed Italic\n/usr/share/fonts/type1/gsfonts/n019043l.pfb: Nimbus Sans L:style=Regular Condensed\n/usr/share/fonts/type1/gsfonts/n019044l.pfb: Nimbus Sans L:style=Bold Condensed\n/usr/share/fonts/type1/gsfonts/n019023l.pfb: Nimbus Sans L:style=Regular Italic\n/usr/share/fonts/type1/gsfonts/n019024l.pfb: Nimbus Sans L:style=Bold Italic\n/usr/share/fonts/type1/gsfonts/n019004l.pfb: Nimbus Sans L:style=Bold\n/usr/share/fonts/type1/gsfonts/n019003l.pfb: Nimbus Sans L:style=Regular\n\nIn case you don't know the exact font name, just try fc-match -s Nimbus \nor fc-list |grep -i nimbus, those commands will give you a hint.\nSecond, delete what you wanna. Below, for example, should delete style Bold Condensed Italic of 'Nimbus Sans L':\n$ sudo rm /usr/share/fonts/type1/gsfonts/n019064l.pfb\n\nAfter deleting, type this command to update the font cache database:\n$ fc-cache -fv\n\nIf if doesn't effect, you need to reboot the system by:\n$ sudo reboot\n\n\nA: If you installed the fonts with apt then you can \nsudo apt remove fonts-<fontname>\n\nYou can see a list of all the fonts you installed with apt using\napt list --installed | grep ^fonts\n\nor to see all fonts available from apt do\napt search ^fonts-\n\n\nA: You can also delete them manually. \n(That can be useful in some cases, for example: if you want to use a program like conky with a thin font like Raleway Thin, but Raleway Regular was also installed, conky may sometime automatically use regular, while font-manager will not be able to tell the difference. So, the idea is to remove regular manually, etc.)\nIf installed with Font Viewer, they are in ~/.local/share/fonts.\nAlso look in ~/.fonts.\n", "Q: Grub does not see Windows 7 after being fixed After I installed Ubuntu on a separate HDD for someone, I was unable to boot into Windows or the Grub option without entering Grub rescue.

In the setup use the \"Something else\" option to set up exactly the partition you created/like the first setup did. Now make sure you choose the root drive with the MBR for the bootloader installation. This means NO partition like /dev/sda1 but /dev/sda!

How can I install Gnome 2 on Ubuntu 13.10 - Server X86-64?

Please don't suggest alternatives, I'm aware of them.\n\nA: There's no way to install GNOME 2. Gnome 2 depends heavily on GTK+2 which it's being depreciated in later versions of Ubuntu. If you somehow manage to \"install\" GNOME 2 you will get an unstable system. The only way is to get some fork of GNOME like MATE or Cinnamon. Otherwise, no.\n", "Q: 13.10 login loop, multiple solutions failed FIXED AT BOTTOM\nI just installed Ubuntu 13.10 from a live cd via Live Linux USB creator. It installed with no errors. I put an encryption password on the hard drive, then created my user account with a password. All of the installation was completed and the computer restarted. Back at the logon screen, I see \"NedryOS\", Guest, and Remote login. I click on NedryOS and enter my password and hit enter. In the space of less than a second the following happens: \n\n\n*\n\n*a loading circle appears in the password box. I assume this is normal.\n\n*the login screen disappears and goes black. I have no idea if this is normal\n\n*vertical white lines flash on the right side of the of the screen, about a third of the width of the screen then disappear\n\n*very small white dots, or perhaps <10 pixel wide lines (definitely smaller than the text entry line that appears on the console) flash across the whole screen, but not in any apparent pattern\n\n*the top two lines (character size lines i mean) appear with red lines across the width of the screen\n\n*there are two beeps, that are very freaking loud, by the way. they are the same that happen when the login screen first appears.\n\n*back to the logon screen.\n\n\nWell, crap. Things I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Guest session -- works normally, including internet access with firefox\n\n*putting in an obviously wrong password -- \"invalid password\" appears\n\n*restarting using this method (including remounting) setting the password to \"1\" -- same issue as before\n\n*reinstalling Ubuntu 13.10 from the same usb drive with no hdd password -- same issue as before\n\n\nThis is the computer I have, with no modifications, and prior to installing Ubuntu, I completely wiped the drive. I also have full power and it's plugged in, so that's not it either. I have been searching askubuntu for responses for the same issue, and have only found solutions for people who lost their password, which I obviously did not if I was able to change it. \nI will say that I am a first time user, so I've no idea if it's a pebkac error that is completely going over my head.\nThanks for any assistance you can provide.\n\nI found this solution and it cleared some of the graphical errors. It does still return to the login screen, but here's what happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*enter correct password\n\n*loading circle\n\n*black screen with mouse\n\n*black screen no mouse\n\n*black screen with mouse\n\n*login screen\n\n\nAgain, it takes only a few seconds, but there were no beeps this time. I will continue to search for solutions and update as I find them.\n\nThis solution also did not work for me. I performed both steps. I do not have a .Xauthority file, and my /tmp file now reads exactly as it says there. I am still experiencing the login loop.\n\nThis solution did not work.\nI do not have a .Xauthority file, so no solutions involving that will work either.\n\nFIXED HERE\nSo I'm not really sure this should really count as a fix, but whatever. I reinstalled Ubuntu 13.10 from the same disk and same file, but this time I checked one of the boxes that said login automatically. It logs in automatically now, and to make sure it worked completely, I locked it, and logged back in fine, then logged out and logged back in fine. I'm not really sure I won't have the issue again later.\nBased on the number of login loop posts, I would recommend trying all of the other solutions above before this, because in the long run, those should work while this might not.\n\nA: Maybe you changed permissions on your /home/user folder.

The only problem is I have 2 options when I reboot my PC: F9= boot device menu; F10= ROM based setup.  F9 does nothing but take me to another menu where my only 2 options both take me to the GNU GRUB screen- where my normal boot takes me anyway.   And F10 takes me to a menu that says Setup Password, which has not been set up and I cant find any evidence of a factory/default password. I have 3 attempts and I have no clue what to do about that.\nNow with B, when my laptop ran XP the wireless worked perfectly.

So you need to add sleep 3 (or another number, you need to find out yourself) at the beginning of you script.\nYou have to take care that the script isn't interrupted by a program that return's an error. Example: I can switch between two graphics-cards on my laptop (pre hybrid-graphicscard) and depending on which one is turned on I must use a different /sys/class/backlight/...-file to set its brightness.\nThe easiest thing is to set both. But to ensure that the non-existing one doesn't interrupt the /etc/rc.local-script I append || true at the end of each command.\nSo this is how my rc.local-script looks right now (sans the comments at the beginning):\nsleep 3\n\necho 2 > /sys/class/backlight/sony/brightness || true\necho 2 > /sys/class/backlight/nv_backlight/brightness || true\nrfkill block bluetooth\n\nexit 0\n\n", "Q: Regarding installing Ubuntu on macbook I have macbook with OS X 10.6.8, am a student and i want to install Ubuntu on my machine virtually using virtual box i don't have DVD option so want to do it with USB\nCan you please help .\nThank you\nVamshi\n\nA: You do not need to use USB to install with Virtual Box.  Download the version of Ubuntu you wish to use (the .iso file) to your hard disk and then mount that file as a virtual CD drive in your Virtual Box VM.  It will then boot from that virtual CD as if it were an actual disc - no CD/DVD drive required - and will guide you through the installation process.\nThis process is described in the first chapter manual:\nhttps://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#idp50988256\nVirtualBox is pretty nice in that if you name the machine appropriately it will try to guess the OS and architecture you are using.  For example, I usually call mine something like ubuntu-1204-64 (Version 12.04, 64 bit) so I can easily distinguish it from other versions and it will automatically select the correct OS, correct architecture.\n", "Q: Restarts to black screen after encountering unresponsive buttons in login UI with Ubuntu 13.10 I just tried to install Ubuntu 13.10 on my old laptop using a DVD.

When I request builds in this recipe it only creates 32 bit and 64 bit packages. How to create packages for armhf, arm64, or PowerPC?\n\nA: Python packages\nThere is no need to enable arm builds for packages built with python, as python source is interpreted, and is architecture independent. The architecture in debian/control should be all, and the PPA package will automatically work in all architectures (although Launchpad will only show it for amd64 or i386).\n\nOther packages\nFor other packages, the entry for architecture in debian/control should be any.\nTo enable ARM builds\nAs of 8 November 2016, enabling ARM builds is self-service: you can change an option in the PPA settings to get it to build for any of the following architectures automatically (documentation link):\n\n*\n\n*AMD x86-64 (amd64)\n\n*ARM ARMv8 (arm64)\n\n*ARM ARMv7 Soft Float (armel)\n\n*ARM ARMv7 Hard Float (armhf)\n\n*Intel x86 (i386)\n\n*PowerPC64 Little-Endian (ppc64el)\n\n*PowerPC\n\n*IBM System z\n\n\nLog in and select \"Change details\" in the upper right corner of your PPA page. At the bottom of the page that follows, you'll see the above options that can be enabled.\n\nTo rebuild already published packages for ARM\nOnce you have enabled ARM in the Launchpad PPA settings, click \"copy packages\", and copy the packages to the same PPA (click on \"copy existing binaries\", so that Launchpad will simply copy the already built packages for amd64 or i386, and will only build new packages for ARM).\nWhen the next version of your package is released, you won't have to repeat this procedure, Launchpad will automatically build it for all architectures you had selected.\n\nThe following entries are ones that only an administrator of Launchpad can enable for your account.\n\n*\n\n*Risk-V 64 bit\nFor it, you still request access on the forums, although searching the forum indicates that Canonical previously only did this under special circumstances (only if you're a Canonical employee or have a contract in place with Canonical). Another forum post suggests that powerpc and s390x builds should be available to all users by now, but I'm not sure if the security concerns of building your (possibly malicious) package on non-virtualized Canonical hardware have been resolved.\n\nA: As of November 2016, this answer is not applicable anymore.

I mean opening without nesessery to tipe F11 after opening. Can that be done?\n\nA: I found that this works. \nabiword & sleep && wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b add,fullscreen\n\nIt's quite similar to Radu's suggestion except it deals directly with the window manager. The sleep might not be required but in my experience, there's a short delay before Abiword takes focus. If your computer is really slow, you might need to extend the sleep to two or three seconds.\n\nA: There is not such an option for AbiWord. See man abiword in this sense. Using only abiword command you can start AbiWord maximized with the help of --geometry option (argument). For example if your screen resolution is 1366x768, then you can start AbiWord maximized using:\nabiword --geometry=1366x768\n\nAnyway, there could be a trick to start AbiWord in fullscreen mode using xdotool. To install it from terminal, use the following command:\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\nAfter is installed, you can start AbiWord in fullscreen as follow:\ngedit & sleep 2 && xdotool key F11\n\nIncrease or decrease the time (in seconds) for sleep if is necessary. This time should be a little bit bigger that the time it takes to open AbiWord.\nNow if you like it, you can add an alias for the above command, let say abiwordfs:\nalias abiwordfs=\"gedit & sleep 2 && xdotool key F11\"\n\nSee also: How to create a permanent \"alias\"?\n", "Q: How can I install VMware on Ubuntu 13.10?

One of the strengths is that it defines and separates the concepts of template and theme. A theme can be saved and contains fonts, colours, and a set of images that can be reused every time you create a new presentation. This ensures that everyone in your organization uses exactly the same colours and fonts all the time. Now I know that you can download templates for LibreOffice, but I have not seen anything similar to the theme concept. The file extensions used in MS office are the following for the two concepts mentioned:\n\n\n*\n\n*Example Powerpoint template file name: mytemplate.pptx\n\n*Example Powerpoint theme file name: mytheme.thmx\n\n\nNow back to my question: Do these concepts and their separation exist in LibreOffice or OpenOffice?

I successfully booted my VM from network through PXE but I can't use my log in username and password to login. Also, it changed to ubuntu login to node login.

Instead, a tool like Juju (or some other program) connects to the MaaS interface and manages the machine for you, including worrying about what the login should be.\nHowever, I believe if you go into the settings page in MaaS, you can set a SSH key for the machines to trust.

The update manager periodically checks for available updates for packages installed through the Ubuntu Software Center.

The version in the repositories is as is and will only get updated when a new Ubuntu is released. Updating has to be done by Microsoft.\nVirtualBox\nInstalling this: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads will not get updates from Ubuntu.\nVBox is in the repositories so use that one.\nOpera\n\n*\n\n*See: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OperaBrowser\n\nInstall opera for the shared version or opera-static for static version. The reason it's recommended is that when you update the rest of your packages (e.g. sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade), Opera will be updated too without having to tend to Opera specifically.\nThere is a generic Opera repository available at http://deb.opera.com (with full description of how to add it).\n\nThe recommended way for installing Opera also means it will get updated. Otherwise you need to take care of it.\nUbuntu is not about having the newest software as soon as possible so if you want bleeding edge you need to take care of your system yourself (or switch to another operating system).\n\nA: No any manually installed packages (from a .deb file) are not updated, since the Ubuntu Software Center (or apt-get) will not know where to get the updated version and if there is a newer version in the repository it will hold the package unless you mark it for update.\nHowever most programs such as Skype and Virtualbox are available from the Software Center and should not be manually installed if you want automatic updates.\n", "Q: How to customize lxpanel/menu on lubuntu?

After installing the NVIDIA driver 319 I used nvidia-settings to configure both displays to use TwinView and the correct native resolutions. I also stored this configuration in /etc/X11/xorg.conf. Right now when I login my display setup is \"loaded\" correctly.\nHowever, LightDM seems to ignore my setup: Each time the login screen is presented in clone mode instead of TwinView with a wrong-sized (too small) background image for the 24\" display.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nUpdate:\nI just noticed that LightDM uses the wrong display setup (i.e. clone mode) only when the laptop lid is closed in the docking station. When I keep the laptop lid open (even with laptop display disabled) LightDM behaves correctly and uses the exact display setup as I configured for my X session.\n\nSolutions for simular questions which involve using xrandr in a script and running it with the option \"display-setup-script\" or similar in the /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf don't work: My script (see below) is executed but the resolution won't change. When executed manually in an X session, the script works perfectly.\nProbably something is being overridden/enforced by the NVIDIA driver here?

Using its slightly mind-bending search syntax: \n~playlists=\"Iron Maiden\"\n\n...would return everything in an Iron Maiden playlist, but:\n~playlists=|(Long Songs, Short Songs, Party Favourites)\n\n...would return everything in any of those, and:\n&(artist=Iron Maiden,~playlists=\"Long Songs\")\n\n...would return everything by Iron Maiden featuring in the Long Songs playlist, but you could do this automatically by:\n&(artist=Iron Maiden, #(length > 300))\n\n...which returns all songs by Iron Maiden over 5 minutes (300 seconds) long. Magic!\n\nA: Banshee supports nested playlists, including nested smart / dynamic playlists. Unfortunately it is not longer actively maintained. Banshee also supports limiting how many songs are chosen. So you can, for example, have one dynamic playlist that chooses 50 songs of a certain type and another than chooses 200 of another, and the make a playlist that combines them, giving you a 4:1 mix of the two types of songs.\nQuod Libet allows allows the search syntax to reference playlists, but you can't reference other searches. Therefore nested smart playlists are not supported, as far as I can tell.\nClementine has not yet implemented nested playlists, unfortunately. They have moved their issue tracking to GitHub.

Will that be possible or would switching displays basically mean switching font sizes and such manually?\nThanks!\n\nA: I'm a happy owner of this laptop. I did the installation without issues using a 13.10 booted from the USB port. Screen is working at its native resolution 3200x1800 but icons and all the rest are far too small to be workable. I currently switched it to 1920x1200 which is very good in terms of readability - there is black spaces left on both side of the screen but I will be able to extend the horizontal resolution to a custom one.\nI didn't find a way to use the \"touch\" feature of the screen yet.\nI didn't test second display yet.\nRegards,\n[EDIT] Just another point regarding the touch feature: it works for very basic point / click / drag with a one-finger operation. That means you can simulate with one finger a mouse with one button (didn't find a way to operate a 'left-click') Anyway, this is quiet useless according to me since there's no management of gestures (for example to switch between virtual screens). I find out that support for gesture should be on the roadmap for Ubuntu 14.10 (Check Web8).\n\nA: I have the 9530 with two external monitors - 2560x1600 and 1920x1200.  It works flawlessly across all of them.  That being said there are a few drawbacks, Ubuntu hasn't been designed to run on hi-DPI screens.\nUpdate - High DPI support was added in 14.04 and works great.  You can scale up and down the font sizes for individual monitors, so they all look good.  \nYou can scale the icons on the left up to a reasonable size, so they're a little small on the laptop screen and a little large on external screens.  If you install Ubuntu Tweak (available from Software Center) you can modify the OS font size, which fixes a lot of the visibility issues.  What it doesn't fix is the size of the icons in the top menu bar, and the size of the close, minimize, and maximize buttons... which can be hard to see and click on.  \nThe 1920x1200 external screen I have is 24\" and a rather normal DPI, and you can tell that the font in the top bar is larger than normal, but it's not egregious (and you can tweak it to make the best balance for you of small font on laptop screen vs. large font on external screen).\nCanonical is pushing to get some fixes for high resolution screens into 14.04, but I'm not sure what the exact likelihood is of the fixes making it in, nor what specifically they're fixing.\nOne note is that Firefox is much better with scaling with the OS font than Chrome is.  Chrome's tabs don't use the scaled system font at all, so they have sort of ridiculously small text.  Firefox's tabs do scale with the OS font, so they look normal (though icons in the tabs are still pretty small).\nObviously, software support for hi-DPI screens is up to the individual application programmers, so you never know if one application will work better than the other... that beings said, Chrome is the only one I have used that is especially obviously broken.\n", "Q: How to install LaTeX packages for Tex Live?

Every TeXLive package belongs to one (and only one) collection, for example the package algorithm2e belongs to the collection science. For simplicity, most distributions, including Ubuntu, do not have a package for every individual TeXLive package, but group together all the TeXLive packages in a  given collection and distribute the entire collection as a single package.\nIn Ubuntu, the TeXLive collection foo is distributed as the Ubuntu package texlive-foo, so for example the collection science is distributed as the Ubuntu package texlive-science. Hence, the Ubuntu answer to your question about how to install the TeXLive package algorithm2e is that you need to install the Ubuntu package texlive-science. (Of course, a side effect is that it will also install all the other packages in the science collection.)\nThe standard way to determine which collection a TeXLive packages belongs to is to use tlmgr:\n$ tlmgr info algorithm2e\npackage:     algorithm2e\ncategory:    Package\nshortdesc:   Floating algorithm environment with algorithmic keywords.\nlongdesc:    Algorithm2e is an environment for writing algorithms.

For example I needed the package \"braket\", I just typed it in the software center, search result showed \"TeX Live: LaTeX additional packages\" which contains the \"braket\" package along with a bunch of other packages, I installed it and I am happy now.\nAlternatively:\nThe best way to get the best out of Texlive is to install Telxlive vanilla by following these instructions:\nhttps://tex.stackexchange.com/a/95373/63118\nThis will probably solve all problems related to packages and everything else. \n\nA: If you install TeXLive from the ubuntu repositories (Ubuntu software Center). Then tlmgr isn't installed, because all packages should use the system package management system 'apt-get'. Hence you get the error:\ntlmgr: command not found\n\nSo you will have to install the package manually:\nDownload algorithm2e.sty here\nThen, go to the folder ~/texmf or ~/.texmf it depends, if it doesn't exist create it:\nmkdir ~/texmf\n\nand copy algorithm2e.sty to it. Then run:\nsudo texhash\n\nput in root password when requested.\nunfortunately, the TexLive packages in Ubuntu are not very often updated so some errors might come up.\nThe alternative is manually installing the entire TexLive distribution and following the guide you posted.\nHope that helps\n", "Q: Proxy with terminal I've set a global proxy from Applications -> Network so firefox has access.\nI've followed 'apt-get' does not work with Proxy so apt-get also works.\nBut if I try other commands which require the internet, for example wget, I generally get errors to the effect of:\n\nfailed: Connection timed out.\n\nHow can I set EVERYTHING to use the proxy? There's no other way to connect.\nTried bash -c export http_proxy='proxy_ip:port/' from no internet for terminal- connect through a proxy but no joy.\n\nA: bash -c will not set http_proxy in your current environment. \n(btw no need to export it in the environment)\nSet it manually at the terminal prompt \n$ http_proxy=http://server:port\n$ wget ...\n\nIf you want to have it enabled each time you open a terminal, edit your .bashrc file  (located in the root of your home directory) and add the line at the end of the file : \n$ gedit $HOME/.bashrc\n ...\n http_proxy=http://server:port\n\n\nA: I've always edited the wgetrc file to use wget from behind a proxy. There are two wgetrc files. First of all there is /etc/wgetrc for global configuration and secondly there is ~/.wgetrc for user based configuration.\nIf you add the following line into wgetrc you can configure it to use a proxy:\nhttp_proxy=http://server:port\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: mount a disk as /mydisk and show it in file browser as devices My machine has 2 disk.\nthe second disk mounts ok in the file browser in the device section but its mount path is in /media/machine/mydisk which is a pain when one want to acces files within mydisk using command line. \nTo solve this I added an entry in fstab with a short path (/data/ leads to my disk).\n/dev/sda1    /data   ext4  rw,auto   0  2\n\nProblem is, after i did this, my disk doesn't appear anymore in my file browser (which is handy in mouse mode), and the only way to access it is through /data/\nQuestion is : how can I have my disk mounted in /data/ and apear in ubuntu file browser as a disk in the device section ?\n\nA: I think the easiest way is to bookmark this location. It will be accessible the same way, just placed in Bookmarks instead of Device section. \nThere is also easy way to put it in Places section if you would like to. Just edit ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs. \n", "Q: ubuntu 13.10 does not work how can I return to ubuntu 13.04? I recently intalled ubuntu 13.04, which I liked very much, and after a while a window appears asking to upgrade to ubuntu 13.10, which I did. After re-starting computer, ubuntu did not work! I would like to return to 13.04. How can I do that. I would like to remove ubuntu 13.10 from grub. \n\nA: Well, you could edit the /etc/default/grub file after sudo then run  sudo update-grub to update the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file to change things in GRUB2.\nBut, the Genie's out of the bottle, and once you upgrade, downgrading is Mission Impossible. I'm not sayin' that it could not be done, hypothetically, but it surely is a complicate process, and much more difficult than backing up the contents of $HOME and below, doing a clean reinstall of 13.04, and then reimporting your data back in and making it yours once more.\n", "Q: Is there any anti-theft / robber-spy application on Ubuntu Touch? theft application on Ubuntu Touch Saucy which could help protect my tablet/phone ?\nI mean an application running as daemon on back-end and waiting for remote activation.

How much memory is needed so the kernel can be loaded in the memory?\n\nA: Kernel modules are not particularly large.  Generally speaking, a kernel module occupies only the amount of physical RAM needed for it to load. \nLinux uses a \"slab-based\" memory allocation scheme in which pools of memory are set-aside for different-sized memory objects. The amount of physical memory allocated changes almost every second.  So how much RAM does the Kernel?  That depends.\nYou can use lsmod, which will show you information about the modules that are loaded in RAM. \n", "Q: How do I configure sound devices in Skype 4.2 on 12.04 x64? I got a new PC and installed the 64-bit version of Ubuntu 12.04 to utilize all of the 8GB of RAM and the APU to the max. So far everything works except sound in Skype 4.2. \n\nI can't snap the whole list of devices offered because both ScreenCloud and Ubuntu's screenshotter refuse to snap when the list is active, but I intentionally used different entries for the speakers and ringing devices. The others offered are on the same basis, all \"digital\" (unlike the analog choice I have for the microphone which I am pretty sure would work). It's a Realtek HD sound card, integrated, pretty common on today's MoBos.\nAnyone has a clue about what could be wrong? I'm pretty sure the Skype login sound was there two days ago, it's since this morning I noticed that it's gone.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I had this problem 5 days ago after reinstalling Ubuntu 13.10 64 bit. \nThe problem is the fact that Skype is a multi-arch program, so if I’m not wrong it uses a mix of 32 bit and 64 bit libraries. \nTo solve the sound issue I just installed libpulse0:i386 package\nsudo apt-get install libpulse0:i386\n\nthen reboot, and pulse-audio showed up in audio settings in skype.\n", "Q: Space (and pipe sign) works on occasion only I have an issue that when I try to write pipe sign \"|\" and space after that, I sometimes get wrong type of space (\\240) and my command fails.\nThis issue persists on different shells.\nHow could I fix this?\nI am using Finnish keyboard layout.\ntimo@timo-i7-ubuntu:~$ ps -ef | grep ruby\ntimo      7169  2633  0 12:12 pts/2    00:00:00 ruby1.9.1 /usr/local/bin/rails new admin4\ntimo      8736 26515  0 14:22 pts/4    00:00:00 grep --color=auto ruby\ntimo@timo-i7-ubuntu:~$ ps -ef | grep ruby\nNo command ' grep' found, did you mean:\n Command 'igrep' from package 'openimageio-tools' (universe)\n Command 'dgrep' from package 'debian-goodies' (main)\n Command 'rgrep' from package 'grep' (main)\n Command 'zgrep' from package 'gzip' (main)\n Command 'zgrep' from package 'zutils' (universe)\n Command 'sgrep' from package 'sgrep' (universe)\n Command 'lgrep' from package 'lv' (universe)\n Command 'egrep' from package 'grep' (main)\n Command 'ngrep' from package 'ngrep' (universe)\n Command 'grep' from package 'grep' (main)\n Command 'agrep' from package 'agrep' (multiverse)\n Command 'pgrep' from package 'procps' (main)\n Command 'xgrep' from package 'xgrep' (universe)\n Command 'vgrep' from package 'atfs' (universe)\n Command 'fgrep' from package 'grep' (main)\n grep: command not found\n\ntimo@timo-i7-ubuntu:~$ cat pipecom\nps -ef | grep rails\ntimo@timo-i7-ubuntu:~$ cat pipecom2\nps -ef | grep rails\ntimo@timo-i7-ubuntu:~$ ./pipecom\ntimo      7169  2633  0 12:12 pts/2    00:00:00 ruby1.9.1 /usr/local/bin/rails new admin4\ntimo      8777  8775  0 14:26 pts/4    00:00:00 grep rails\ntimo@timo-i7-ubuntu:~$ ./pipecom2\n./pipecom2: line 1: $'\\302\\240grep': command not found\ntimo@timo-i7-ubuntu:~$ diff -w pipecom pipecom2\n1c1\n< ps -ef | grep rails\n---\n> ps -ef | grep rails\n\n\nA: I found this link on a french site: http://forum.ubuntu-fr.org/viewtopic.php?id=65282 Now my french is bad but this link is also referred to on the Arch Linux forum (and that one is in english). This is probably the reason for your error too: \n\nWith some keyboard layouts, type [AltGr] + product space character\n  that appears as a space but is not interpreted as such by the shell.\nWhat's happening is that by typing the |, you stayed pressing the\n  [AltGr] typing space.

I wish that it would work for me. Running 13.10 x86, after I do the copy of the icons, in the folders are a bunch of links to .svg files not actual graphics files. It appear that the second copy actually went into /usr/share/icons/Humanity/mimes/... and replaced the links there with the renamed .png files.  I hope that nothing too weird happens as a result. I have rebooted a couple of times and nothing seems amiss, but no Firefox icons for the .htm files yet either.\n\nA: I use a program called AssoGiate.\nAssoGiate is an editor of the MIME file types database for GNOME.Ubuntu Apps\nTo install AssoGiate .\nOr\nJust press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo apt-get install assogiate\n\n\nA: You can simply replace the default icons for html files. Since mozilla has only 128 size icon, I'm going to replace with that. \n\n\n*\n\n*First make a copy of the default icons \nmkdir ~/icons\ncp -r /usr/share/icons/Humanity/mimes/* ~/icons -v\n\n\n*Then replace with the mozilla icons for all sizes\nsudo cp /usr/lib/firefox/browser/icons/mozicon128.png /usr/share/icons/Humanity/mimes/16/gnome-mime-text-html.svg\n\nsudo cp /usr/lib/firefox/browser/icons/mozicon128.png /usr/share/icons/Humanity/mimes/22/gnome-mime-text-html.svg\n\nsudo cp /usr/lib/firefox/browser/icons/mozicon128.png /usr/share/icons/Humanity/mimes/24/gnome-mime-text-html.svg\n\nsudo cp /usr/lib/firefox/browser/icons/mozicon128.png /usr/share/icons/Humanity/mimes/32/gnome-mime-text-html.svg\n\nsudo cp /usr/lib/firefox/browser/icons/mozicon128.png /usr/share/icons/Humanity/mimes/48/gnome-mime-text-html.svg\n\nsudo cp /usr/lib/firefox/browser/icons/mozicon128.png /usr/share/icons/Humanity/mimes/64/gnome-mime-text-html.svg\n\nsudo cp /usr/lib/firefox/browser/icons/mozicon128.png /usr/share/icons/Humanity/mimes/128/gnome-mime-text-html.svg \n\nsudo cp /usr/lib/firefox/browser/icons/mozicon128.png /usr/share/icons/Humanity/mimes/256/gnome-mime-text-html.svg \n\nThen enjoy!\n Here is a screenshot for you after changing the icons.

FailsafeX: \"Screen not found\" I made a regular update using update center yesterday on  My Samsung NP730U3E with Ubuntu gnome 13.10 and today it won't start. Or rather: it just gives me a black screen. On start up I get to enter my encryption password and everything seems fine.

If I head over to \"tty7\", where the graphical things usually are going on I just see this (and it's frozen):\n\nWhat to do?\n\nA: I had same problem today on Lenovo P50. The issue was that I switching to nvidia driver from stock open source driver. The display would go black when I boot and login gets stuck in loop when I go to recovery mode. When doing Ctrl+Alt+F1 and trying to startx I saw errors such as screen not found. The solution was simply to roll back to stock drives using this command line:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-*\n\nVoila! I'm back in but then xorg reported some error. So I did,\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n\nNow there are no issues.\nRefrences:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do you remove Nvidia's proprietary drivers?\n\n*startx doesn't work\n\n*X fails to load\n\n*Ubuntu gets stuck in a login loop\n\nA: Novine's comment on my question indirectly gave me the answer. When I booted into recovery mode, went on by \"resume normal boot\" and then logged in via tty1 I ran startx. This gave me an error saying there was a parse error in /etc/X11/xorg.conf. I then opened up that file and emptied that file from some unnecessary lines I had put in there a short while ago (I saved it all empty).\nThat made the trick, and everything is now working great! Big thanks to Novine! :)\n", "Q: Is it safe to format msftres, msftdata and hidden partitions? I have an acer V7 which came with a 1TB HDD, 24GB SSD and Windows 8 installed. I have installed Ubuntu onto the SSD and formatted the main partitions of the HDD. However, I also notice 3 other partitions on the HDD marked msftres, msftdata. Is it safe to format these also so that I have one contiguous drive partition or will I be wiping something important like boot or bios data? \n\nA: The \"flags\" shown in parted or GParted can refer to different things. Some of the common ones on GPT disks include:\n\n\n*\n\n*msftres -- This flag means \"Microsoft reserved.\" It's used as \"scratch space\" by certain Microsoft tools, so it should not be deleted or re-purposed unless you're deleting Windows. See the Wikipedia entry on this partition type for more information.\n\n*msftdata -- This flag identifies a Microsoft Basic Data partition. It normally holds a Microsoft filesystem, like FAT or NTFS, so such partitions will include your C: partition and perhaps recovery or data partitions. You should not delete or change them unless you understand precisely what type of data is on the partition and want to delete it. Note that Linux used to use the same type code for its own partitions, so you might see this flag on a Linux partition, too. Two years ago a new Linux-specific type code was created, and Linux partitions with that type code will show up as having no flag set. Versions of libparted that recognize the new Linux-specific type code are only just becoming available. The \"msftdata flag\" appeared with that same new version of libparted.\n\n*boot -- On a GPT disk, this flag identifies an EFI System Partition (ESP). You should definitely not mess with this partition unless you know what you're doing. Likewise, you should not set the \"boot flag\" on any other partition -- not even on a Linux /boot partition. Note that the \"boot flag\" has an entirely different meaning on MBR disks. On such disks, it's common to set the \"boot flag\" on a Linux /boot or / partition, although it's not usually required to do so.\n\n*bios_grub -- This flag identifies a BIOS Boot Partition, which BIOS-mode GRUB uses to store boot code. You don't normally need such a partition on an EFI-booting computer. If you've switched from a BIOS-mode to an EFI-mode installation, you can safely delete this partition, but because a BIOS Boot Partition is normally quite small (~1MiB), you won't recover much space.\n\n*legacy_boot -- Unlike all the flags I've just described, this one does not correspond to a type code; instead, it identifies a GPT attribute. This attribute is used by the GPT-aware version of SYSLINUX to identify a bootable partition. That is, its purpose is similar to that of the \"boot flag\" on an MBR disk. To most tools, this flag is irrelevant; it can be set or deleted as you see fit.\n\n*hidden -- Like \"legacy_boot,\" this flag is a GPT attribute, not a partition type code. It identifies partitions that the EFI should ignore. In my experience, though, most EFIs ignore this flag, so it's not really very useful. Some computers ship with this flag set on some partitions, though.\n\n\nYou can read about more about these, and other GPT type codes, in the Wikipedia entry on GPT. Note that the \"flag\" names assigned by parted and GParted are specific to libparted. Other tools, like GPT fdisk or the Windows partitioning tools, have other ways to refer to GPT type codes. (Few programs use the codes directly, since they're long and awkward hexadecimal numbers.)\nNote also that libparted uses the same \"flag\" concept to identify two entirely different data structures: partition type codes and partition attributes. Type codes are mutually exclusive; a partition can be an ESP or a Microsoft Basic Data partition, but not both. Thus, if you remove the \"boot flag\" on an ESP, it will likely pop up with an \"msftdata flag,\" since ESPs use FAT, and FAT partitions get the \"msftdata flag\" by default. (In older versions of libparted, the \"msftdata flag\" doesn't exist, so the partition would have no flag.) A partition can have multiple attributes, though, so it could have both the \"hidden flag\" and the \"legacy_boot\" flag set. It could also have a type-code flag set, like those two plus \"bios_grub\". This dual use of the \"flag\" concept is confusing. GPT fdisk (gdisk and related programs) separates these concepts, using two-byte hexadecimal codes (like EF00 or 8300) for type codes and reporting attributes as such.\n", "Q: How to start developing for Ubuntu I would like to learn how to develop a multi-clipboard application for Unity, similar to Diodon, for learning purposes.\nCan you give me a link or some direction to get started?\nI have generic programming skills but I think I can do it! :D\nHope you can help and that I'm not off topic.\n\nA: You might find this video useful: Creating Your First Ubuntu App. Enjoy! \n", "Q: How do I sort packages I'm trying to remove some packages that I installed a long time ago but don't need any more, when I type dpkg --get-selection I get a list of all the packages installed in my system, but I need to sort those packages, like this \"the packages needed by the system all together\", \"packages that can be removed all together\".  \nIs there any command that can sort them for me ??\n\nA: No, there is no such things as \"the packages needed by the system all together\" since the system has no way to determine which packages are required. Because it is you who directs the requirement.\nHowever, some packages might be installed together with other packages and if you removed those, the 'installed together' packages might not get removed. In this case, you can run this command to remove those unnecessary packages. \nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\n\nA: If you want to find packages that you don't use anymore, this should be done manually, since the system has no way to know if you still need them or not. Now for packages that were installed along something you needed, but you no longer needs and/or removed, you can try Anwar Shah answer or use deborphan:\nsudo apt-get install deborphan\ndeborphan\n\nThis will generate a list of no longer needed dependencies that you can uninstall/remove.\n\nA: You can also install synaptic which will provide you with more GUI information about installed and available packages.

I tried several times and it didn't automatically show up.\nIn order for me to see the GRUB menu I had to turn on my PC and on start had to press ESC to pause startup and press F9 to get boot options. Then from there I had to pick from OS Boot, Ubuntu, Ubuntu (Yes there were two Ubuntus available) and a default EFI file thingy. \nWhen I click the first Ubuntu I get the GRUB Menu (I was too scared to try the second in case I screwed my laptop up) and I can safely load Ubuntu from there and use it (although I do have to increase my brightness every time I load Ubuntu because it somehow reduces my brightness to complete darkness on boot)\nSo my problem here is why isn't my GRUB showing on boot, after it worked on the first day? \nMy laptop is a HP TouchSmart j-078CA.\nEDIT 1: FYI I just switched to Ubuntu LiveCD to check my Installation and found out that one of my partition is flagged as msftres. Here is a screenshot of my GParted on a LiveCD: \n\nA: If you are usinge Windows Power Shell, you have to use Quotemarks:  \nbcdedit /set \"{bootmgr}\" path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\n\nA: First, turn off the Windows 8 Fast Startup feature, as described here. That feature causes filesystem corruption, which can in turn cause odd boot issues. There's a good chance that this issue caused your problem initially. Disabling Fast Startup might or might not cause GRUB to reappear the next time you reboot.\nIf that doesn't fix the problem, you should try re-registering GRUB with your firmware's NVRAM. The way to do this that's most reliable is to use bcdedit in Windows. Open an Administrator Command Prompt window and type:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\nIf you're booting with Secure Boot active, change grubx64.efi to shim.efi (or maybe it's shimx64.efi; in Linux, check the contents of /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu to see what's there). Doing this in Windows is more reliable than other methods because some users have reported that some versions of Windows repeatedly re-register themselves as the default boot loader if the default is set outside of Windows. Although this is rare, it's consistent with what you're seeing, so using Windows for this task may be necessary.\nAn easier way to do it, but potentially less reliable in your case, is to use Boot Repair. This tool automatically fixes certain types of boot problems, and it's likely to work for you. The biggest risk is that if an overzealous Windows caused GRUB to become inaccessible to begin with, the Boot Repair change won't work.\nIf you continue to have problems, post back with details. (If necessary, edit your original post and comment on this one to alert me to the change.)\n\nA: I have one piece of advice. I followed the first answer process, but GRUB still was not showing up.\nI followed the Fast startup off and the bcedit command, but it doesn't work.\nI was ready to use Boot-Repair in a Linux live USB, booting from BIOS, and I noticed a feature in 'Boot Manager' options that still showed 'Fast Boot' enabled, even when Windows said it was not enabled. \nI turned it off, rebooted and there it is, as fast as always the GRUB interface!\nI hope it helps before someone tries to reinstall Ubuntu or use Boot-Repair.\nEdit 1: The 'Boot Manager' tab is the first tab in my BIOS, there is a list of devices from where I can choose to boot (hard drive, CD, USB...) Above that there are two options 'Fast Boot' and another that I don't remember. I hope it clarifies the ambiguous context of my answer.\n\nA: Most motherboard vendors should let you reset the boot order with efibootmgr (which grub uses when it is installed in UEFI mode). Deactivate Windows Boot Manager. Boot into Ubuntu from either the original install or a live Ubuntu USB/DVD) and run efibootmgr. If you installed it in UEFI mode, you'll get some information and a boot sequence list. You'll notice Windows bootloader/Windows Boot Manager and Ubuntu somewhere in the list. It's likely that Windows will have a higher boot priority (Windows boot entry is above Ubuntu in the boot sequence).\nThere are also asterisks* beside some, if not all, of the entries, marking them as active.\nLook at the 4-digit boot number next to the Windows entry and run:\nsudo efibootmgr --bootnum #### --inactive\n\nThis will deactivate the Windows entry. Also make sure that the now deactivated Windows has higher priority if it doesn't already:\nsudo efibootmgr --bootorder ####,$$$$,&&&&,%%%%\n\nwhere #### is the Windows boot number.\nIf you reboot now, you'll boot to grub if the Ubuntu option is enabled with the highest priority.\nNote that Windows doesn't seem to recognize that it's been deactivated, so this will not get reverted by booting into Windows or updating it.\nSource: revised from this answer\n\nIf that doesn't work try to change the boot manager in the BIOS/UEFI settings. Enter the BIOS setup utility -> select System Configuration tab -> OS Boot Manager -> Ubuntu -> press the appropriate key (e.g. F10 Save and Exit) to save the changed settings and exit.\n\n", "Q: port 25 smtp port connection refused I just settup my postfix on my VPS with the help of this guide: https://www.exratione.com/2012/05/a-mailserver-on-ubuntu-1204-postfix-dovecot-mysql/\nEverything works, can send mails, recive it, etc etc....on localhost.\nwhen i try to acces  it from my own computer, nothing happens, and when i try telnet mail.example.com smtp it says connection refused.\nevery config is just like in that guide.\n\nA: It is common for isp's to block port 25 or intercept all traffic on it to prevent spam.\nIn your case does it look like your isp is blocking the port on your local connection.

The basic decoration (red in my case) may look ugly, but you can find fancy Emerald themes by simply running a search on the net using your favorite search engine, this page -in example- contains cool windows decorations based on Emerald.\n\nThe Radiance_Suite by nale12 looks much like the effect you're after. But playing with the settings in the \"Edit Themes\" tab of the Emerald Themer you can create your own customized theme starting from an existing one.\n\nIn combination with a Chrome's Aero theme you may get the full effect you're looking for in Chrome, but Aero themes will require gtk2 so you may find a major problem to make Chrome's Aero themes transparent.\n\nDuring the process to get exactly what you wish you may find an issue or two, but it will be funny and illustrative, believe me.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How to carry audio over SSH? Is there a way to carry audio over ssh? \nSay after connecting to remote machine through ssh -X I opened a browser and want to watch a youtube video. Currently I could only able to watch the video without any audio. But I want to hear the audio too. How to do that?\n\nA: How to carry audio over SSH?\nStolen answer from grawity in SuperUsers:\n\nThe easy way: Run paprefs, go to Network Server and check Enable\nnetwork access to local sound devices.\n\nYou need to install it using\nsudo apt-get install paprefs\n\n\nWhenever you SSH with X11 forwarding enabled, PulseAudio programs use\nX11 to discover your sound server (use pax11publish or\n\n\nxprop -root PULSE_SERVER\n\nto see for yourself). Just tell PulseAudio to listen for\nnetwork connections (paprefs as described above), and all X11\nprograms will be able to use it.\n(Other users will not have access to your sound server, unless you\nallow it yourself in paprefs. The authentication data is carried\nover in the X11 PULSE_COOKIE property, or you can copy\n~/.config/pulse/cookie manually.)\nNote however, that the PulseAudio stream is not encrypted this way, so\nit is okay for use at home, but not over the Internet.\n\nThe slightly more complicated way: Enable network access as above, but\ntunnel PulseAudio over SSH TCP forwarding. Use pax11publish to\ndiscover your PulseAudio port (usually 4713), connect with\nssh -R 24713:localhost:4713\n\nthen run\nexport PULSE_SERVER=\"tcp:localhost:24713\"\n\nThis will be slightly slower due to SSH overhead, but is safe to use\nover the Internet.\n\n", "Q: ubuntu 12.04 on macbook pro 9,1.

It got an error 17. This happened right after I was messing around with files trying to get a game to run smoothly on it but that was when I knew nothing abou pc gaming and just expected any pc game to work on any computer. I think thats what caused the error. So recently my friend wiped my hard drive clean with dban and I'm thinking about doing a clean install of Ubuntu alone because I actually liked it for internet browsing and Libre word. Plus I don't have any money to get a new operating system right now. Someone told me to get an illegal version of windows xp or windows 7 but I'm paranoid about viruses and it not working properly. I'm just wondering if the grub errors are common with Ubuntu. I'm hoping that they're not common and easy to avoid. And I'm hoping that the last error was because I was screwing around with it. Because I don't want to deal with errors this second time I install it.\n\nA: GRUB2 (the current version of GRUB) is very stable, and very unlikely to cause trouble, unless you go trying to 'improve' it.

Although I will agree with the community that iOS 7 is not the most open platform release, it still is my desire to be able to grab Photos, Music, and Files off my Phone similar to what I would do to any other device.\nEvery time I connect my device to Ubuntu, I receive the following notification:\nThe device \"Justin's iPhone\" is locked. Enter the passcode on the device and click \"Try again\".\n\nOn my iPhone, I select the following\npermissions.\nUnfortunately, this is where problems start to arise. It appears that Ubuntu either does not recognize the permissions from my iPhone or the iPhone is not allowing itself to truly be unlocked. As we can see the permissions are denied.\nBrowsing askubuntu, I encountered the following suggestion.\nAfter running the code, I receive the following error:\njustin@justin-CT15:~$ idevicepair unpair && idevicepair pairERROR: Device d1fea2c56e51199f901eb34020a1581ea31a2a50 is not paired with this host\n\nIf I call the command again, i receive another error:\njustin@justin-CT15:~$ idevicepair pair\nERROR: Could not pair with the device because a passcode is set. Please enter the passcode on the device and retry.\n\nUltimately, I am stuck to experiment with solutions that end up not working.

When it asks to trust or not, don't tap anything and type:\nsudo idevicepair pair\n\nIf that doesn't work at first run:\nsudo idevicepair unpair\nsudo idevicepair pair\n\nIf that fails, tap trust or don't trust (try with both) and try the above again.  If that fails, then you might have to wait for libimobiledevice to fully update its iOS 7 support.\n\nA: As a work-around to this issue, I found that doing the following would allow me to browse the phone freely with nautilus:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power cycle phone but do not unlock it\n\n*Logout of Ubuntu desktop\n\n*Connect the phone to the PC\n\n*Log back in to Ubuntu desktop\n\n\nAt this point it seems I can freely browse the phone in nautilus. \n\nA: Same problem, different solution?\nWith 12.04 running I plug in the locked iPhone 5s (ios7),\nanswer \"trust\" or \"don't trust\" (choice doesn't seem to matter), \nthen ignore subsequent trust questions.\nIt soon stops asking. \nThe iPhone charges, and I can access/download my photos\nfrom \"home folder\".\nNot sure what other functions can be done from that point.\nNot sure this even qualifies as a solution as I don't really do anything technical!\nJust seems to work if I let it beep a couple of times.\nI came here searching for the answer, before I found this post it quit asking the trust question and all was good.

The instructions tell me this command is installed by \nsudo apt-get install postgresql\n\nso what's going on? I can make initdb available by installing postgres-xc, but I think postgres-xc is just some weird third party rubbish, and it's not detailed in the instructions. Any ideas?\n\nA: You will find initdb under /usr/lib/postgresql/x.y/bin/.  See also /usr/share/doc/postgresql-common/README.Debian.gz for more information on the setup on Debian and Ubuntu.\n\nA: initdb is not installed as user executable. Is only installed in /usr/lib/postgresql/X.X/bin/, because it always depends on the version. initdb can only be executed from that specific directory.\nAs mentioned in other answers, installation of postgres creates a default directory that may be in a limited partition. Users may want to change this, but it requires other steps also. see here.\n\nA: initdb is intended to be run under the postgres user account that is created during the install. After installing postgresql you can do:\nsudo su - postgres\nThen you should be able to run initdb.\n\nA: Follow the following steps with user root\n\n*\n\n*passwd postgres - your password\n\n*su postgres\n\n*psql\n\n*Create a user with your user name like CREATE USER SAM ;\n\n*create database sam; \n\n*Log out and type psql <your_user>\n", "Q: Disable Unity switch desktop notification overlay? When I switch desktops in Unity, a small expo appears as overlay. I remember I set its visibility to 1.5 seconds, but now can't remember where those settings are. \nHow can I disable it since it's making my Firefox fullscreen flicker as long as its visible?\nI can take a snapshot if you don't know what I am talking about. \n\nA: Open CompizConfig Settings Manager. If you do not have it installed, you can find it in the Software Center or type this into a terminal: sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\nIn the Desktop section, click on Desktop Wall (or just search for the latter). Under the first tab (Viewport Switch Preview), uncheck the box for Show Viewport Switcher Preview. The overlay should no longer appear.\n", "Q: How to restore Ubuntu login screen after lubuntu install? I have Ubuntu 13.10 installed. I then installed lubuntu 13.10 (sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop) too. As a result the login screen has changed and I can no longer get an on screen keyboard. \nHow can I restore the login screen to the original Ubuntu default?\n\nA: My login screen was changed after I installed KDE. Anyway, one possible solution (what worked for me because in my research I found others but they didn't work) was to uninstall and reinstall lightdm:\nsudo apt-get purge lightdm\nsudo apt-get install lightdm\n\nOf course, I had to specify what display manager I want (gdm, kdm or lightdm - after I broke my lightdm I used gdm as default). For this you have to run\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm\n\n\nA: Since the OP is a bit lazy(!), I'm going to post the answer myself. Most of the times, thesudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm solution doesn't work. You'll need to change the settings manually either by using lightdm-set-defaults or editing /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up lightdm.conf:\ngksudo gedit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n\n\n*You must have the following settings under [SeatDefaults]:\nuser-session=ubuntu \ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\n\n\n*Save and reboot.\n\nA: My login screen was also changed to KDM after installing the KDE desktop on my Ubuntu 13.10 installation. The quickest solution for me was to run the following command:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\nAnd then you can choose for lightdm as a default instead of KDM.\n\nA: NO need to sudo apt-get purge or reinstall..\nif this is after installing lubuntu just edit the lubuntu lubuntu.conf\ncd /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d\n\nsudo gedit 20-lubuntu.conf\n\nthen paste this to it:\nuser-session=ubuntu\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\n\n\nA: thats work very well, \nI read in this post: How To Install LightDM 1.7.0 On Ubuntu 13.10/13.04/12.10 And Linux Mint 16/15/14 and I ran:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:lightdm-gtk-greeter-team/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install lightdm-gtk-greeter\n\nbut I disliked it, so I can't solve to my display manager default for Ubuntu, and after I did this:\nOpen lightdm.conf for editing in nano text editor:\nsudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n\nYou must have the following settings under [SeatDefaults]:\nuser-session=ubuntu\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\n\nSave and reboot.\nIt's great, this works.

I tried to fix that Plymouth's problem with proprietary graphics driver using an old script I found on the internet (it was coded for Natty, now that I think about it I shouldn't have done it). I ran that script and rebooted my computer.\nFirst incorrect behaviour I noticed was that Plymouth only displayed its text splash only on 1/4th of the screen, though when I pressed Esc key the logs were displaying correctly.\nMain problem appeared when I logged in. All my desktop's windows lack menu bar, can't be closed with Alt-F4, and they don't appear on the taskbar.\nI tried fixing it by reinstalling GRUB a few times, purging /etc/grub.d and /boot/grub, but only the text splash issue was fixed. How can I fix that?\nThis is the script I used.\n\nA: I am not sure if this will fix it, but ...\nsudo apt-get purge v86d\n\nAs root, edit /etc/initramfs-tools/modules and remove the line \"uvesafb mode_option=$resolution mtrr=3 scroll=ywrap\"\nAs root, edit /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/splash and remove the line \"echo FRAMEBUFFER=y\"\nThen run \nsudo update-initramfs -u\nsudo update-grub2\n\nThat might fix the problem, assuming you purged and re-installed grub2 (looks if all the other files edited were grub files). \n\nA: You should read carefully what you are doing, that article is for Natty or 11.04 which is 2.5 releases from the one you are using.\nLet's dissect what the script did:\n\n\n*\n\n*It installed v86d and hwinfo packages. Both can be removed:\nsudo apt-get --purge autoremove v86d hwinfo\n\n\n*There are several lines added to several files around all the system.\nsudo sed -e 's/FRAMEBUFFER\\=y/d' /etc\\/initramfs-tools/conf.d/splash\nsudo sed -e 's/uvesafb/d\n\n*Then it modifies /etc/default/grub and /etc/grub.d/10_linux, you can recover the original files by reinstallation:\nsudo apt-get --purge autoremove grub-pc\nsudo apt-get install grub-pc\n\nDO NOT REBOOT THE SYSTEM\n\n*Run sudo update-grub2 and sudo update-initramfs -u\n", "Q: Nautilus exits unexpectedly If I unmount a drive using nautilus the nautilus-window closes - I don't know why. \nI think it's a bug, or is there a way to change this useless behaviour of the default gnome-file-manager. \n\nA: This is expected behavior.

For various reasons (mostly my own ignorance) I am on my third install of Ubuntu 12.04. I want to partition the hard drive to create a drive for data and personal files in case I ever have to install again. I have been struggling all afternoon to make a gparted live USB. Tuxboot looked like the answer but I get an error message when using it. So, I am asking for help. Ultimately, I want to partition the hard drive for data and personal files. What do you recommend?\n\nA: If your Ubuntu install is not using all your HDD space you can make a partition using the free space. If you used all the space for Ubuntu, you have to use a liveCD to partition the hard drive, because you can not resize an in use partition.\nA good and free partition editor is GParted, you can either use its liveCD and follow this guide to install it on USB: http://gparted.sourceforge.net/liveusb.php or use the Ubuntu live environment in which you will find GParted already installed and ready to be used. So, if you have any trouble with the GParted live you can use the Ubuntu live as well!\nAfter you start GParted, here you can find a nice guide to use it: http://gparted.sourceforge.net/display-doc.php?name=help-manual\nAnyway, re-sizing a partition is very easy:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click -> Resize/Move\n\n*Resize it using the \"slider\" (be careful: do not move the partition, just resize it!)\n\n\nAfter the resize, you will have to make a new partition for data:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the unallocated space on the disk device\n\n*Right click -> New\n\n\nNow check all the modification you made and confirm them by clicking the \"tick\" or Modify->Apply\nNow you can reboot. Remember that this partition won't be auto-mounted at the startup, in order to do this you have to modify the fstab file. This may help you: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab\nP.S.: Reading this article may help you during the resize operation: http://www.howtogeek.com/114503/how-to-resize-your-ubuntu-partitions/\n", "Q: Database for Ubuntu compatible with Microsoft Database? I am trying Ubuntu 12.04 booted from a DVD disk before I install it.  I currently have windows 8 (which I hate) and I have a couple of Data base programs with my movies, hundreds of movies, in them.   Is there a database available for Ubuntu that is compatible with Microsoft Database?  There are too much data in the current database file for me to have to rewrite the program.\nSo far, I love the Ubuntu 12.04.  I have been able to access my microsoft works spreadsheet files and documents with no problem.  And I like the thuderbird email and just about everything else about Ubuntu 12.04.  I just need to be able to access my database files and to write lables and envelopes.\n\nA: I assume that you mean Microsoft Access as the database.\nEasiest alternative to use on Ubuntu is LibreOffice Base. Your system probably already has LibreOffice, but you will probably have to add Base:\nsudo apt-get install libreoffice-base\n\nOnce installed, you should be able to open your Access file, but your mileage may vary, see here: Is it possible to open an Access 2010 database file without using Wine or VirtualBox?\n\nA: MySQL is a very widely used database system (not just on Ubuntu) (MariaDB is the open source clone of MySQL since MySQL got bought by Oracle).\nAny database can export to and import from text files so all you need to do is create the database and the tables. \nThere is an explanation on how to get data directly from Access to MySQL on the mysql site so you can if you want to.\n", "Q: Xubuntu - Apps Become Unresponsive Intermittently Possibly Relevant Information:\n\n\n*\n\n*XUbuntu 12.04 LTS (precise)\n\n*XFCE 4.8\n\n*AMD Graphics (Kernel driver in use: fglrx_pci, Kernel modules: fglrx, radeon)\n\n\nThe primary symptom of this issue has been my active rdesktop session to stop responding while everything else appears to work normally.  I have been killing rdesktop and re-launching it, with it freezing after a seemingly random time period.  The fastest was within seconds.  The longest was a couple hours, although it's usually within a few minutes.\nThat being said, I have occasionally seen the terminal and web browsers also become unresponsive to keyboard input.  They respond to clicks and will accept middle clicks (to paste text) without issue while remaining unresponsive to the keyboard input.\nI have been able to restore functionality, by switching workspaces and typing on the other workspace, then returning to the original workspace.  This work-around typically does not work for rdesktop, although it has fixed rdesktop's functionality twice.\nWhat is being reset when I do this?  What does this work-around/solution indicate may be the problem?\n\nA: It seems that this problem has been known for quite some time.  I found the following bug threads on Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rdesktop/+bug/217868\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rdesktop/+bug/218308\nIn my case, killing the cisco vpn agent solved the problem.

THE DHCP is working. \nHowever my only issue is that i can not get Ubuntu Server to recognize the CDROM to gain access to ONE file i need which is pxelinux.o \nIf you need more info let me know. \n\nA: In Linux, devices must be mounted to a location in the filesystem before they become accessible for reading or writing. In the case of Ubuntu desktop editions, CDROMs are typically automounted, but in the case of the server editions they must be mounted manually. The general format for that is\nmount [-fnrsvw] [-t vfstype] [-o options] device dir\n\nwhere device is the block device (typically /dev/cdrom for CDROM devices) and dir is the filesystem location where you want the device to be mounted (the mountpoint). In the case of CDROM devices, the vfstype (filesystem type) should be detected automatically, and other options are probably not needed, so it should be sufficient to do\nsudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom\n\nso long as the mountpoint /media/cdrom exists - if not you can create it with\nsudo mkdir -p /media/cdrom\n\nYou will then be able to access the CDROM contents by going to /media/cdrom i.e.\ncd /media/cdrom\n\nOf course you are free to mount at /cdrom instead of /media/cdrom if you prefer.\n", "Q: Ubuntu on an Asus Transformer Prime?

I would suggest that when you go into the livecd, to choose the option to install without trying it out, so that it goes directly into the installer. \nIf you are inside windows 7 that is something i am familiar with, when i tried double clicking the installer it would tell me that it was going to restart so i could go into the livecd. \nI have never tried to install actually from within windows 7, i choose to restart, but in that case Wubi seems to be the right path.\nDecide if you want to install from within windows 7 or through the live cd, and then proceed to download the appropiate installer X_x\n", "Q: Odd start up, blank then error, then quick boot 13.10 When I boot up sometimes I get:\nBIOS, blank purple screen for a bit, a black screen with printed on it:\n[      10.838171]  INFO 0w1_cfg80211_attach  :  Registered CFG80211 phy\n\nthen the orange dot ubuntu load screen that goes quickly.\nIs this normal?

This explains why you can not see the special adjust function of your \"special\" mouse or keyboard. \nThe best transparent KVM switch technology will be the \"DDM class\" basing on USB DDM technology which will map whatever USB keyboard and mouse to each of KVM channels to communicate with each connected system without disconnect them even you switching away to other channels. \nPlease google \"DDM KVM switch\", you will find KVM switches meet your configuration. \n\nA: Actually go to System setting - mouse and touchpad  and you will get a window like \nin this the middle option pointer speed the option for sensitivity .\n\nA: I can confirm this issue on 13.10 x64 with a Kensington Pro Fit wireless combo; only mouse options are for double click and primary/secondary button.

I have a DHCP static lease setup for my computer which dual boots Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.10.  When running Windows, there is no problem getting the IP address I assigned in the static lease.  However, when booting Ubuntu, it refuses to get the IP address I assigned and just gets the first available dhcp address.  Obviously the mac address is the same and the hostname is also set the same though I don't think hostname is used by the router.  This is not just isolated to one Ubuntu machine on my network.  My usual fix it to just configure the Ubuntu machine with a fixed ip address that matches the static lease address, but I found on this machine that is causing a problem with ssh connections dropping every few minutes (different issue, different question to come).\nSo, why does it seem every Ubuntu machine I have won't get the static lease address automatically and is there something I can do to fix it?\n\nA: Turns out there was a NAS box on my network that had it's dhcp server turned on.  My Ubuntu machines were getting their dhcp addresses from the NAS instaed of the router.\n", "Q: How to restart unity-panel-service Sometimes, the unity panel just stops working, meaning I can't access any menus for the programs I'm running.

You can add basically any script as custom sensor. The output it produces will then appear where you put its placeholder. I am using this to extract information from the output of sensors like this:\nsensors | grep temp1 | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/+//' \n\nto exctract the temperature or \nsensors | grep fan1 | awk '{print $2}'\n\nto extract the fan speed.\nJust click on New, enter a name and a description and the respective lines from above under Command as shown here:\n\nPS: After upgrading from Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04 the tool seemed to have problems to read the configuration file, resulting in a crash when I tried to add sensors.

I've been using 12.04LTS for over a week now. For 3 days it was great but now I'm having a number of problems. I'm using an Acer Aspire one D255 it has a 250GB HDD and a 1GB Memory. My browser is Firefox. Pages freeze occasionally and I wait for over 10 minutes and have to use the computer's 'off' button. Pages crash. On facebook some pictures don't load and I have to close down and restart a couple of times. Scrolling can sometimes be very jerky. Downloading software has become a problem and I have a 'no entry' sign in the top taskbar. I've looked at this page for some help but the words used and the explanations are not helpful to someone like me who has little knowledge of this. Please - 'Ubuntu for dummies'. I'd like to continue using Ubuntu but am close to giving up.\n\nA: Check if adobe-flashplugin and its dependencies are installed on your system. If not install the following two packages and restart system.\n\n\nA: As the Acer Aspire one D255 is a low end netbook, I am afraid that the default Ubuntu interface 'Unity' is to heavy for your pc. I would suggest installing a more lightweight version of Ubuntu such as Lubuntu and/or Kubuntu. This changes completely how Ubuntu looks, but it can be done without reinstalling the computer.\nIf you're sure you want this, you can install it in the following way:\nGo to the Ubuntu software center and search for Lubuntu-desktop if there are two you should install the one without the i386 label, which is the one for 64-bit systems like your laptop.\nRestart and it should either boot into Lubuntu directly or present you with a login screen, click on the ubuntu logo above the login field and select Lubuntu from there.\n", "Q: Samba shares won't automount on boot from fstab I have FSAT setup to mount a CIFs share, but on boot up the share never gets mounted.

You can do this using a windows 7 boot medium.\nIf you don't have one, i think there are some windows rescue images on the internet, which should work as well.\n", "Q: How to get a 'non-Screenlet' calculator in Compiz widget layer? I've currently set up the screenlet calculator but do not want to use it, as\n1) Screenlets are no longer in development, most do not work, and I intend to slowly migrate away from them.\n2) The existing Screenlet calculator looks very similar to the one in OSX, and IMHO it's not appealing.\nI prefer either galculator or gcaltool. Is there anyway to get these in the widget layer?\nI'm open to other options as well, but basically I'm looking for a 'non-screenlet' calculator to come up in the Compiz Widget Layer.\nThanks.\nSoftware Specs: Ubuntu 12.04 with Xubuntu desktop. Xfce upgraded to 4.10, and using Compiz.\n\nA: Just figured it out. But well worth it as it CAN BE APPLIED TO MAKE ANY PROGRAM WINDOW A WIDGET!!\n1) Finding Calculator Window Class: a) Load the calculator program. b) Then load a terminal window. c) To get the class of the calculator window, in terminal run \nxprop WM_CLASS | cut -d\\\" -f4\nYour mouse will now look like a cross-hair. d) Now click on the open calculator program you want to use in the widgets layer. The output class is displayed in terminal. e) Note it down. In my case its 'galculator'.\n2) Setting up Calculator in Compiz Widget Layer: Go to Menu\\Settings\\Compiz Config Manager\\Desktop\\Widget Layer\\ a) Enable the 'Widget Layer' Plugin. b) Within the Widget Layer Plugin section, go to Behaviour\\Widget Windows\\ and enter\n(class=Galculator)\nIf you require multiple widgets, then enter\n(class=Galculator) | (class=Screenlet)\n| is 'or' and in my case I'm allowing both Galculator + Screenlets on the widget layer.  NOTE: Brackets are essential, even for single class entries. Does not work if they are missing.\nYou're basically done! But if your looking for the complete deal...continue...\n3) Remove Calculator Window Decorations: Go to Menu\\Settings\\Compiz Config Manager\\Window Management\\Window Rules a) Enable the 'Window Rules' Plugin. You will be prompted to enable Regex Matching (if not already enabled) and enable that also. b) Then within the Windows Rules section, go to Matches and enter/copy+paste (class=Galculator) under EACH of the following headings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Skip Taskbar\n\n*Skip Pager\n\n*Above\n\n*Sticky\n\n*Non-resizable windows\n\n*Non-minimizable windows\n\n*Non-maximizable windows\n\n*Non-closable windows\n\n*No focus\n\n\nNow it looks like a true widget.\n5) Autostart Calculator to load in Compiz Widget Layer: In Menu\\Settings\\Settings Manager\\System\\Session & Startup\\Application Autostart\\ a) Click the 'add' button with the green cross. b) Enter name, description, and command for the calculator launcher and click 'Ok'. In my case its, Name: Galculator Description: Start Galculator Widget Command: galculator. c) Make sure its ticked in the 'Application Autostart' list.\n6) Logout & Login Voila!\n\nA: The most similar thing I've found is having a calculator in the unity dash.\nYou can install unity-lens-utilities:\nsudo apt-get install unity-lens-utilities\n\nThen when you open the dash and type an operation, it gives you the result as a preview. Also the preview is linked to the actual calculator so if you need to do more complex operations you can just click on it.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: LAN and wifi not detecting after upgrading to Ubuntu 13.10 Ubuntu is not detecting LAN sometimes.And 95 % of time it doesnot detect wifi.The network option says wifi are not in range even though they are\nIt usually happens when the ubuntu stays idle for long time.\nBut there are cases when I start my laptop and LAN is not detected.\nIt usually gets fixed when I reboot\nI tried to do both of these things:\nsoftware and updates->Additional Drivers->Mark and unmark wireless card.\nBut none of them worked\nEdit:\nlspci -nn | grep -e 0200 -e 0280 gives:\n04:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation BCM43224 802.11a/b/g/n [14e4:4353] (rev 01)\n09:00.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

I follow the instructions and in Synaptic, I locked all kernel and headers as well as all occurrences of xorg... however, after running the update and checking that no kernel or xorg package were going to be installed, I got a console only login... and the top line says 12.04.3 as Ubuntu version... so there was some upgrade that I did not want that still happened... There are so many packages that I don't know which one updated and cause the problem.\nThe issue is that I want to run Ubuntu for image analysis on an old system (at work, no choice and no upgrade coming soon) that need to run the AMD drivers to get the imaging software running properly. As AMD has stopped supporting the HD 3xxx series, I must stay with xorg 1.11 or 1.12 and kernel 3.4 max for the driver to run properly.\nAny help appreciated!\nRv\n\nA: There is no such package. The point releases are just to prevent people from downloading 6, 12, 18 months worth of updates each time they update Ubuntu. If you use a stock 12.04 LTS installation the upgrades will take you there. Point releases are only relevant from \"First Installation\" point of view, upgrading the system, there are no differences. So, what package you must hold to prevent updates? All of them. The only way to prevent the upgrades to packages you do not want is to hold them all. If you want a certain package installed, you must use the hold version function that comes with APT.\nI would suggest you to switch to radeon's drivers if the ATI's privatives do not work.

I don't want to log into text mode and 'start' the lightdm every time. So I tried replacing back the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"text\" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\", and did update-grub too, but something unexpected happened, an unbootable system! (probably the DM got meshed up) How do I fix this?\n\nA: Found the solution! So I'm posting it here myself...\nTo revert back to a graphical login and session (X session), GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"text\" in the /etc/default/grub file should be replaced by GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash reboot=bios\" (or GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash reboot=api\" for some Dell laptops). After having done this editing, save the file and run the update-grub command, and then reboot to see if the graphical login greeter appears. If it does, that's it... you can then log-in... \nBut if you still remain stuck with the problem (like I was..), you can try using gdm as your display-manager (DM) or you could also try reinstalling lightgdm. I uninstalled lightgdm and set gdm as the new manager with the command that follows:\nsudo stop lightdm\nsudo start gdm\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm \n\nand choose the DM you want so that it is set as the default option.\nIf your choice of DM was gdm, now you may uninstall lightdm, sudo apt-get remove lightdm, and sudo reboot. And there you are with our old gdm graphical display-manager.\nBut if you choose lightdm which if which crashed earlier like mine did, you'd like to do a reinstall of lightdm instead like described below:\nLog-in to a new tty (press Ctrl + Alt + F1) and enter the commands;\nsudo stop lightdm\nsudo apt-get purge lightdm\nsudo apt-get install lightdm \n\nand then set lightdm as the default manager and reboot to see it in effect.\n", "Q: LiveCD customization of Ubuntu 13.04/13.10: \"unable to find a medium containing a live file system\"\" Hello \nI've followed this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization and when I boot my iso it appears a BusyBox showing this message: \"unable to find a medium containing a live file system\"\" (/var/log/casper.log contains the same).

I have setup an intranet email system using postfix, dovecot and squirrel mail, Which is working fine, I can send and receive mail to all users on the system.  I presume that the issue is in the postfix configuration, because when I configure Thunderbird to send mail I am getting the following error:\nAn error occurred while sending mail. The mail server responded:  4.1.8 <user@intranetdomain.com>: Sender address rejected: Domain not found. Please check the message recipient support@intranetdomain.com and try again.\n\nAlso here is the relevant syslog entries:\nNOQUEUE: reject: RCPT from host1.intranetdomain.com [More Information] [192.168.11.1 [More Information] ]: 450 4.1.8 <user@intranetdomain.com>: Sender address rejected: Domain not found; from=<user@intranetdomain.com> to=<support@intranetdomain.com> proto=ESMTP helo=<[127.0.0.1 [More Information] ]> \n\nI have configured MX records on the DNS server and they respond appropriately when I query them for those MX records, so I do not think that is the issue.  I think that my issue is caused by the default configuration of:\nsmtpd_recipient_restrictions = reject_unknown_sender_domain, reject_unknown_recipient_domain, reject_unauth_pipelining, permit_mynetworks, permit_sasl_authenticated, reject_unauth_destination \nsmtpd_sender_restrictions = reject_unknown_sender_domain\n\nSince this is on an internal network and it will not be exposed to the internet as a whole which options can I remove safely?\n\nA: smtpd_sender_restrictions = reject_unknown_sender_domain\n\nDon't accept mail from domains that don't exist. (source)\n\nreject_unknown_recipient_domain\n\nReject the request when Postfix is not final destination for the recipient domain, and the RCPT TO domain has 1) no DNS A or MX record or 2) a malformed MX record such as a record with a zero-length MX hostname (Postfix version 2.3 and later) (source)\n\nIf you need to change both to make it work, will you have to fake the sender domains in your local DNS or add them to the /etc/hosts file on the server. From the explanation, postfix will reject it if it can't look up the domain.\nFor the second, should you be fine with adding the receiver domain in the servers /etc/hosts file. Explaination: Dovecot use virtual transport, and thus Postfix is, as i have understood it, not considered the final destination and you will need to have proper \"path\" to the destination. How? Add a DNS A record (to the servers host file) or a proper MX record to your local DNS.\n\nFor your question: Yes, you can remove safely, but that will turn off the filters refereed above.\n\nA: You have to add the line:\nmy_destination = intranetdomain.com, host1.intranetdomain.com, localhost\n\nand it will tell postfix that this machine is the responsible for handling e-mails sent to this domain/host.\nIf this is the only entry/exit point for the internal e-mails you are sending/receiving, it's all you will need.  On the other hand, it's always wise to properly set up your DNS servers, adding MX records for your domain and pointing them to your MTA.\nIt is advisable to keep localhost into the line above so it may handle internal e-mails, sent by other daemons to/from root.\n", "Q: Locate a user's bashrc file Really confused.\nUpon running \ncat etc/passwd\n\nI have found this:\npostgres:x:117:126:PostgreSQL administrator,,,:/var/lib/postgresql:/bin/bash\n\nmeaning I have a postgres user, right?\nI want to change the bashrc environment file of this user to make commands available to it.\n /var/lib/postgresql\n\ndoesn't contain a bashrc file, and \n/bin/bash\n\ndoesn't contain it either, so I don't really know what's going on.

More information on this is welcome, and filing a bug report is in order if it's a bug in a Linux tool. (Contact the software's publisher if it was a bug in OS X software that caused the problem.)\nAs to re-indexing partition numbers, the GPT fdisk (gdisk) program can do this.

I am running Ubuntu 12.04 on a 64-bit HP laptop with a 16 GB flash drive. I do not have a working hard drive right now. When I installed Ubuntu, I created a 2 GB swap partition on sdb1. I have since learned that swap partitions are generally a bad idea on flash drives, so I would like to use my swap space for my other partitions. You can see my partition scheme in the link below.\n\nI have read that I just have to comment sdb1 out of the fstab file, boot from a GParted live CD, select swapoff for sdb1, delete/merge with other partition, and everything's good.\nBut, I've also read that messing with sdb1 can change the UUID of sdb2 or sdb3 and cause problems. Is this true? Does initramfs use swap at all?\nAlso, when I get Ubuntu running on my laptop with an internal hard drive, does the swap partition help that much? I have 6 GB of DDR3. Does the rule of 1.5xActual RAM still apply? It seems like quite a bit to me.\nThanks for the help!\nUPDATE:\nI have removed swap. The process I followed is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click swap partition in GParted and selected swapoff.\n\n*Used # to comment the swap partition out of fstab.\n\n*I tried to boot from a live GParted CD, but I kept getting an error, so I ran GParted in Ubuntu.\n\n*Deleted swap partition in GParted.\n\n*Unmounted /windows.\n\n*Expanded /windows to take the remaining space.\n\n*Mounted /windows.\n\n\nThe / and /windows partitions each kept their own names and UUIDs, and everything is running fine.\nI have never seen any swap space being used before, and I don't intend to use the hibernate function, so I think removing swap was a good idea.\n\nA: Having a swap partition on any kind of flash storage (like USB drives) is, indeed, not such a good idea.\nIt should be safe to simply remove the swap partition. While I personally never bothered removing it from /etc/fstab, it most certainly won't hurt either.\nIf you have sufficient amounts of RAM, the size of the swap partition becomes less relevant (please do correct me if I'm wrong, someone). I usually create a 4GB swap partition, and so far I can't say I've had any problems with it.\nWhen the system is out of RAM (like, 0 bytes available), it will freeze. If it has a swap partition, it can move some data from RAM to swap to prevent the system from freezing. On the other hand, swap (HDD) is slower than RAM, so if it needs to fetch a lot of data from the swap partition, you're going to experience very noticable delays.\n\nA: Try to monitor your swap memory usage in a terminal with top or htop, which is more user friendly.  If you don't have htop installed, you can install it with:\nsudo apt-get install htop\n\nWith your amount of RAM, I would say that your swap usage is 0% a lot of time.\nIf you want to format your swap partition, first you have to disable the swap with the swapoff command.  Then format the partition with mkfs.ext4 or mkfs. After that you need to edit your /etc/fstab so that the system will mount your new partition at the boot time.\nYou can also use a graphical application like Disks, which ships with Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Using dpkg to install upgrade and dist-upgrade packages So I'm playing around with offline package installation on 12.04 Server, having downloaded packages by retrieving and wgetting their URIs using the instructions here: http://www.webupd8.org/2009/11/get-list-of-packages-and-dependencies.html\nI did this with apt-get upgrade and apt-get dist-upgrade, then went about installing the downloaded packages using dpkg -i.

Clicking the question mark next to \"Remote Login\" says that I need an Ubuntu Remote Login account, but then clicking \"Set up\" makes the screen go black for a second, then returns me to the login screen. \n\nA: One thing its Desktop Sharing, and another very different is Remote Login.\nIn Ubuntu you have Desktop Sharing while using a program and service called vnc server this program needs to be installed either with synaptic or with the ubuntu app market.\nOnce this application is installed you can share your Desktop and someone can connect to it from the local network in the current session.\nA Remote Login can be done installing a SSH Server, then from a remote terminal type :\n$ ssh -Y username@remote ip address\nIt will ask if you want to add the ssh key type (YES) then type the remote user password and then once logged in just type startx\n$ startx\n\nThis will initiate the default window manager (unity or gnome).\nOr from a linux desktop login choose REMOTE LOGIN then type the local IP of the machine that you need to use.\nYou may also initiate a separate session using VNC but the basic idea of VNC its to share the current live session instead of initiate a new one.\nA basic difference between SSH and VNC is that VNC does compress the video and images streamed to the client while SSH does not, but the image quality its very good\nOther advantages of VNC Clients is that they can be installed and executed in almost any device or OS, Google Chrome itself have one extension, Windows, MacOS X, iOS, and Android as well.\nBut in my own experience its easier and quicker to install TEAMVIEWER, it does work flawless in ubuntu and any other OS, and you can access your desktop from anywhere not only your local network, the only cons is that it can't open a separate session as SSH X or VNC.\n", "Q: I can't upgrade 13.10 because of broken pipe I try upgrading and this is what I get:\nchristopher@chris-computer:~$ sudo apt-get upgrade\n[sudo] password for christopher: \nReading package lists...

I know there might be a work in progress and I would appreciate any info regarding it's state and any possible solution :)\n\nA: Juju 1.16.0 has preliminary support for manual provisioning, and a manual provider. Unfortunately we found quite late (too late for inclusion in 1.16.0) that there were a number of bugs that made it quite difficult to use. For this reason, we've not announced this widely yet.\nIf you're going to try it, I'd suggest either waiting for 1.17.0 (or later), or if you're adventurous, build from source. There's only one known bug now (discounting those caused by it), and that's that you can't destroy the environment (uninstall the agents) via the juju tool.\nEverything in the docs is still true right now, but may change as we develop things.

Every script in [GROUP C] has been started with a &, and are running in the background. I am surprised that they are also killed by the stop [myscript] command. Why is this, and how to I prevent it from happening?\nEDIT: Basically [myscript] is as follows:\npre-start script\n          echo 'Starting myscript Daemon\\n'\nend script\n\nscript\n        exec /foo/bar/myscript-start.sh\nend script\n\npost-stop script\n        echo 'and apparently we are done....'\nend script\n\n\nA: Upstart kills the process group:\n\nThe signal specified by the kill signal stanza is sent to the process\n  group of the main process. (such that all processes belonging to the\n  jobs main process are killed). By default this signal is SIGTERM.\n\nTo avoid this, start the child processes in a new session with setsid, for example:\nsetsid top\n\nps (ps -eo '%c %a %p %P %r') will show that the process has a unique process group, and a parent pid of 1. \n\nA: Seems you don't understand how scripts stanzas works.\npre-start stanza\npre-start script\n          echo 'Starting myscript Daemon\\n'\nend script\n\nThis script start before your main scrips, if it fails, the start sequence will fails. This is normally used for some adhoc operations that will allow the first script to start, these are not daemon-like (continuously running at background). Example:\npre-start script\n    /lib/init/apparmor-profile-load usr.sbin.avahi-daemon\nend script\n\nscript\n    opts=\"-D\"\n    [ -e \"/etc/eucalyptus/avahi-daemon.conf\" ] && opts=\"${opts} -f /etc/eucalyptus/avahi-daemon.conf\"\n    exec avahi-daemon ${opts}\nend script\n\nAs you can see, the apparmor profile is first load from the DBus (yeah, kind of awkward if you don't know the backend of Ubuntu) then starts the service as intended. This operation is designed for process that die once executed.\nscript stanza\nscript\n        exec /foo/bar/myscript-start.sh\nend script\n\nThis is the only part of your program that needs to run continuously and upstart has to track it's PID. This process dies when you stop the script.\npost-stop stanza\npost-stop script\n        echo 'and apparently we are done....'\nend script\n\nThis stanzas are designed as a kind of a cleanup process. It will be executed once the main script dies gracefully. For example, apport:\npost-stop script\n    # Check for a hung resume.  If we find one try and grab everything\n    # we can to aid in its discovery\n    if [ -e /var/lib/pm-utils/status ]\n    then\n        ps -wwef > /var/lib/pm-utils/resume-hang.log\n    fi\n\n    if [ \"`dd if=/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern count=1 bs=1 2>/dev/null`\" != \"|\" ]\n    then\n        exit 1\n    else\n        echo 0 > /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable\n        echo \"core\" > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern\n    fi\nend script\n\nIt tries to detect a resume from sleep that was not successful and starts preparations for detect the next hang so it can produce a useful report (yeah, is complicated again, but that was the most simple script I found apart ufw which is oversimplified). As you can see each process dies by itself since it could block the shutdown of the system (in such cases there's also a script that sends TERM and KILL signals to hanged process).\nBottom line, what you are experiencing is perfectly normal and is the desired behavior of upstart.\n", "Q: HP Envy 6 ultrabook touchpad wont use the gestures I quit Windows 8 for Ubuntu on my HP Envy 6 Ultrabook, but the touchpad won't work properly (I can't zoom in/out).

How will I be able to view/test my site as I'm developing if I can't install a major browser, e.g Firefox, Chrome, IE, etc. Is the solution to use Ubuntu Desktop instead? thanks!\n\nA: Ubuntu Server is what it is advertised as - a Server. While you can develop using command line tools, it will be a major pain in the @$$. With that, you can install the Ubuntu Desktop version and install the LAMP or LEMP stack (whichever you prefer) after.\nBasically, you have two options.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have already installed Ubuntu Server, you can just add in the Ubuntu Desktop package by issuing the command sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop.\n\n*If you have Ubuntu Desktop installed, issue the following command on the terminal to install the LAMP Stack : sudo apt-get install tasksel && sudo tasksel. Once tasksel starts, you can install the LAMP Stack.\nI would however recommend you to try out LEMP (NGINX instead of Apache2).

If I suspend the computer in a graphical way (not closing the lid): gearwheel in top right of the screen -- suspend and wake it up/turning on, audio works with no issues. Ideas how to fix this?

Sadly my Ubuntu hard drive is 16 GB while my windows is 1 TB (way more than I need even for win 8), so my questions are...\nIs there anyway to partition part of the windows hard drive for Ubuntu use?\nI so, my current Ubuntu drive has different partitions for / and home; could I combine free space on the other hard drive with one of those so it could still be accessed in the same way but with more memory?\nShould I combine / and home since I am only running out of memory in / ?\nWould any partitioning affect the boot of windows since the boot loader is on that drive also?\n\nA: Wow ... Loads of questions there ...  Firstly whenever working with partitions PLEASE NOTE you could LOSE all your data.  So you need to be extra careful.  However after taking that warning into account this is possible.\n\nIs there anyway to partition part of the windows hard drive for Ubuntu use?\n\nYou can use GParted in Ubuntu to resize your windows partition.  Although you do not necessarily need to resize the partition to use it.  You could just mount it from inside Ubuntu and have access to it whenever you need it.  That way any data you add to that drive is available in Windows as well.  this is a good idea if you use this drive for data (documents, pictures etc).\n\ncould I combine free space on the other hard drive with one of those so it could still > be accessed in the same way but with more memory?\n\nAdding extra drive space to a partition has no effect on memory.  Perhaps you meant can you add space to e.g. /home so it is bigger and then can hold more data.  If that is the case then you can do this with some file systems (zfs) however I hate fiddling with file systems like this and typically start from scratch and just start with the partitions being the correct size.\n\nShould I combine / and home since I am only running out of memory in / ?\n\nAgain I assume that you are referring to disk space and not memory.  I would not combine / and /home as this has an impact especially if you want to re-install later ... with a separate \"/\" partition you can simply install Ubuntu and format / but you can keep your data safe in the /home partition.  Although if you are experiencing space issues then you may want to look into resizing your partitions using something like GParted.\n\nWould any partitioning affect the boot of windows since the boot loader is on that drive also?\n\nThat depends on what changes you make to the boot partition.  If you just resize it it will still boot as before.  however there are flags that can be changed that will effect if that drive is recognized as a bootable drive or not.  I wouldn't change anything like that though.\nIt sounds to me as though your system has grown over time and could probably benefit from re-installing both OS's but this time do some planning before hand and work out what space you will need for which partition.\n", "Q: Change a vps' welcome message When I log into my sudo user on an Ubuntu vps, this message appears:\n\nThere is a Quick installer available in /usr/sbin named\n  quickinstaller.sh.

So your 1st command fails because it needs to be ~/Downloads and you need to be the normal desktop user.

I have tried multiple times and ways. I am fairly new but from what I understand is ueif or such is different. What else do I need to do? Thanks. \n\nA: I agree with the comment.  If your system cannot see Ubuntu on a Windows 8 computer it's most likely because of UEFI.  You can disable UEFI by going Legacy Boot, but I don't think that's the right answer.  If it's not because of UEFI and it has to do with your USB key formatting... I apologize this answer will not help you, but UEFI seems to be the cause of this problem normally... and even if it's not understanding UEFI and Ubuntu is to install the two side by side.  Last little bit of info, I use LiLi USB creator and have no issues with Windows 8.\nTo really understand how UEFI and Secure Boot affects users and Ubuntu, I think it's helpful to understand what UEFI is and what it changes. Then discuss the features of secure boot, and how it may affect installs:\nUEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and firmware\nIt is designed to replace the BIOS.  The BIOS is old, and it was designed for older hardware.  It can only support a 16 bit processor mode, only 1MB Addressable space, only boot maximum of 2TiB drive, 4 Partitions, etc.  DOS and older OS's used to rely on the BIOS for basic I/O... but the boot loaders importance once an OS is running is greatly reduced today.  Realize many people will still refer to UEFI as the BIOS.\nSome major changes with UEFI are:\nProcessor independent architecture and drivers\nNetwork capability before the OS loads.\nSince UEFI can be 64 bit it allows it to read all memory which can be addressed by a 64 bit computer\na GUID Partition Table instead of a MBR which allows more than 4 partitions and over 2TiB from a boot drive (8ZiB)\nprovides runtime options for the OS such as getting date/time/NVRAM access\nUEFI allows for SECUREBOOT:\nSecure Boot stops drivers and OS loaders from being loaded by the firmware unless they are signed with a digital signature written to the firmware.  This can be very useful for stopping rootkits.  You can add more keys to allow other software to run in \"Custom\" mode.  \nThat being said, you can read lots of limitations about Secure Boot, how it can be used to allow one OS to dominate a system, etc. Because of this Windows 8 required SecureBoot to be able to enter custom mode or be disabled to be Windows 8 certified.  With it disabled, you lose all the benefits of secure-boot but you can still use UEFI.  With it in Custom Mode you can add public keys which do not match the private key in the system so that other software can run besides just those with the private key\nFor Ubuntu\nWhen you install Ubuntu, if your system is set to boot in UEFI, it will install as an EFI.  \nAs of Ubuntu 12.10 it has supported Secure Boot\nIf you are adding Ubuntu as a 2nd OS it's important to have the same type of OS as your boot loader (ie. 64 bit or 32 bit). So if you have a 64 bit Windows and you boot UEFI you should choose 64 bit Ubuntu.  If you do not, it will not load.  I tried to boot UEFI with a 32 bit Ubuntu (13.10) and couldn't even get it to read the USB until I disabled UEFI.  I installed the 32 bit version with it disabled.  When I realized my mistake, I reloaded the 64 bit Ubuntu to the key, enabled UEFI and it detected it great.  I then reinstalled.\nUsing UEFI allows you to have lots of primary partitions when you install, so don't worry about guides that make you start using logical after you have 4 partitions.\nEverything isn't perfect yet.  For example, GRUB has an issue booting Windows 8 with secure boot.  I can choose to boot from the Windows drive first, it works fine.  I can load GRUB first and boot Ubuntu under secure boot just fine.  But when GRUB loads, it will not load Windows 8 with secure boot.  Here is a good site about this issue, and at the bottom is the bug report which is confirmed: http://falstaff.agner.ch/2012/12/18/ubuntu-12-10-and-windows-8-with-secure-boot-mode/\n", "Q: my probleme about \"The installation or removal of a software package failed\" Recently, when I open Ubuntu software center, it ask me repair package\nThen I found this message .\ninstallArchives() failed: (Reading database ... \n(Reading database ... 5%\n(Reading database ... 10%\n(Reading database ... 15%\n(Reading database ... 20%\n(Reading database ... 25%\n(Reading database ... 30%\n(Reading database ... 35%\n(Reading database ... 40%\n(Reading database ... 45%\n(Reading database ... 50%\n(Reading database ... 55%\n(Reading database ... 60%\n(Reading database ... 65%\n(Reading database ... 70%\n(Reading database ... 75%\n(Reading database ... 80%\n(Reading database ... 85%\n(Reading database ... 90%\n(Reading database ... 95%\n(Reading database ... 100%\n(Reading database ... 569135 files and directories currently installed.)\nUnpacking linux-image-3.5.0-42-generic (from .../linux-image-3.5.0-42-generic_3.5.0-42.65~precise1_amd64.deb) ...\nDone.\ndpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/linux-image-3.5.0-42-generic_3.5.0-42.65~precise1_amd64.deb (--unpack):\n failed in write on buffer copy for backend dpkg-deb during `./boot/vmlinuz-3.5.0-42-generic': No space left on device\nNo apport report written because the error message indicates a disk full error\ndpkg-deb: error: subprocess paste was killed by signal (Broken pipe)\nExamining /etc/kernel/postrm.d .\nrun-parts: executing /etc/kernel/postrm.d/initramfs-tools 3.5.0-42-generic /boot/vmlinuz-3.5.0-42-generic\nrun-parts: executing /etc/kernel/postrm.d/zz-update-grub 3.5.0-42-generic /boot/vmlinuz-3.5.0-42-generic\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n /var/cache/apt/archives/linux-image-3.5.0-42-generic_3.5.0-42.65~precise1_amd64.deb\nError in function: \ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of linux-image-generic-lts-quantal:\n linux-image-generic-lts-quantal depends on linux-image-3.5.0-42-generic; however:\n  Package linux-image-3.5.0-42-generic is not installed.\ndpkg: error processing linux-image-generic-lts-quantal (--configure):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of linux-generic-lts-quantal:\n linux-generic-lts-quantal depends on linux-image-generic-lts-quantal; however:\n  Package linux-image-generic-lts-quantal is not configured yet.\ndpkg: error processing linux-generic-lts-quantal (--configure):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\n\n\nA: Try to install linux-image-3.5.0-42-generic by running the following command on terminal.\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-3.5.0-42-generic\n\nIt will solve the problem.\n", "Q: Execute command on time Shell Script I want to say I am a complete newbie but I want a shell script that will execute a command on a specific time for example on 6:45 am\nHow is this done, a full example would be very useful!

With the possibility to manage it through my MAC and iPhone? And if i disable anything, except the Airport and the Ubuntu machine, it still play's?\nThanks.\n\nA: It is technically possible to stream audio to an Airport Express device from a server but there are so many limitations that you probably dont want to go through the pain of installing this.\nThe recommended way to get audio streaming without issues is to have the media player (presumably iTunes) and the streaming running both on Apple systems. They do use a proprietary non-open streaming protocol which causes issues and makes things needlessly complicated, esp. when it comes to controlling from an iPhone or a Mac.\nThe way to acchieve this with least headaches is to have your Ubuntu as a file server for  audio files to be accessed from the MAC. Only then you will probably be able to get a smooth, uninterrupted and lagless streaming experience, fully controllable from the Mac.\n\nNevertheless here's a very basic outline of steps to take to stream audio to an Airport Express from an Ubuntu server:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install ALSA, and Pulse Audio including tools on the server.\n\n*Install and load the pulseaudio-module-raop.\n\n*Load your Airport Express to the RAOP module with the following command:\n pactl load-module module-raop-sink sink_name=RAOP sink_properties=device.description=\"AirportExpress\" server=<IP_of_AEX>:<Port>  \n\nReplace <IP_of_AEX> with the IP you assigned to the Airport Express, and optionally give a <Port> (defaults to 5000)\n\n*Make this sink your default:\npacmd set-default-sink RAOP\n\n\n*Run and control a command line media player through SSH from the MAC (or iPhone if you have an SSH client installed there).\nNote that when you do not run the server but a desktop flavour of Ubuntu your approach to this will be different:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I stream music to my AirTunes?\n", "Q: \"Error loading MySQLdb module\" when installing custom app I am installing a custom app that needs MySQL, which I already had working so I am a bit confused on what's going on.\nAnyways here is the error:\nError loading MySQLdb module: this is MySQLdb version (1, 2, 4, 'final', 1),\n  but _mysql is version (1, 2, 3, 'final', 0\n\nTried\nsudo pip uninstall MySQL-python\n\nthen\nsudo pip install MySQL-python\n\nwhich worked... \nSuccessfully installed MySQL-python\n\nstill the same error \nError loading MySQLdb module: this is MySQLdb version (1, 2, 4, 'final', 1), \n  but _mysql is version (1, 2, 3, 'final', 0\n\n\nA: It seems that apt-get and pip each installed their own version of the library.\nTry removing system MySQL with sudo apt-get remove python-mysqldb, and\nyou should have something like this:\nReading package lists...

Also, PBR_DRV seems to contain files for lenovo one-key recovery. \nWhen I request the file list of the partitions with [] next to them, they seem to list all the folders I had in them pre-disaster.\n\nA: If you proceeded with the full Ubuntu installation, chances are it's overwritten enough data on your Windows partition that you'll never be able to recover it to the point where it will boot. You might, however, be able to recover some user files from the disk. You're more likely to be able to succeed with this task by using PhotoRec than by using TestDisk; however, the last I heard, PhotoRec did a poor job at recovering filenames. I've heard that some Windows-specific recovery tools can do a better job at recovering filenames, but I don't have pointers to specific products.\nOnce you've recovered your files, if you want to boot Windows, you'll need to re-install it. Contact your manufacturer for a recovery disc set or check out this superuser.com question and answer for information on getting legal Windows 8 images online.

If so are indicators packaged separately and thus is there a way for me to look at the source of all my installed indicators or do they typically come packaged with their application?\n\nA: I'd suggest a two step process...\n1) Install indicator-sysmonitor and then write a shell script to call the remote service and display your data (the indicator will only display though).\n2) Any of the indicators listed in What Application Indicators are available? will give you an example of how to write indicators...that's how I learnt.\nFWIW, take a look at any of my indicators and use those as an example.

I had no problems with the previous version 13.04, but the first thing I noticed with this latest version is that the brightness OSD stays on the screen and even if I use the hotkeys to brighten or dim my screen, nothing happens with my display. Furthermore, the volume controls in my taskbar don't work either and some weird things are happening in the settings app, like flickering sliding bars. \nI found another post that says if you use the the code: killall /user/lib/notification-daemon/notification-daemon the notifications should work again. However, when I tried that command in my terminal, Xubuntu told me it found no such file or directory. \n\nA: Just upgraded to 13.10 myself on the same type of machine (at least an MSI Wind U100), and had the exact same problem. Tried all this acpi_backlight=vendor/acpi_osi=Linux grub stuff that I usually try when dealing with backlight issues but nothing worked. \nThen I found another thread with at guy writing about his U100 with backlight issues which he fixed with a BIOS update. I must admit I think it's drastic since it worked fine in 13.04 (so I guess something changed in between kernel 3.8->3.11)... I however didn't want to spend a lot of time on this if it would work so I downloaded the newest BIOS from MSI (1.10G) and used unetbootin to create a FreeDOS USB stick.

Is there any way to create a bootable Ubuntu USB flash drive from the terminal without using any third-party applications like YUMI, Unetbootin, Startup Disk Creator,  etc.\nI tried to create a bootable Ubuntu flash drive with dd method,\nsudo umount /dev/sdb\nsudo dd if=/path/to/ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=1M\n\nIt creates files on the USB disk, but when I try to boot the USB disk it shows an Operating System Not Found error.\n\nA: $ dd if=ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1MB\n\nDon't use the path to bit.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the cd command to get to the folder that contains the .iso file\n\n*use the command dd if=FILE NAME HERE.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1MB\n\n*Wait until the console output looks something like this:\n1028+1 records in\n1028+1 records out\n1028653056 bytes (1.0 GB) copied, 55.4844 s, 18.5 MB/s\n\n\n*Boot from the usb.\nNote: Make sure you write to the correct device a usb will not always be mounted at: dev/sdX where X can be any letter.\n\nA: You can use dd.\nsudo umount /dev/sd<?><?>  \n\nwhere <?><?> is a letter followed by a number, look it up by running lsblk.\nIt will look something like\nsdb      8:16   1  14.9G  0 disk \n├─sdb1   8:17   1   1.6G  0 part /media/username/usb volume name\n└─sdb2   8:18   1   2.4M  0 part \n\nI would dismount sdb1.\nThen, next (this is a destructive command and wipes the entire USB drive with the contents of the iso, so be careful):\nsudo dd bs=4M if=path/to/input.iso of=/dev/sd<?> conv=fdatasync  status=progress\n\nwhere input.iso is the input file, and /dev/sd<?> is the USB device you're writing to (run lsblk to see all drives to find out what <?> is for your USB).\nThis method is fast and has never failed me.\n\nEDIT: for those on a Mac ending up here, use lowercase for bs=4m:\nsudo dd if=inputfile.img of=/dev/disk<?> bs=4m && sync\n\n\nEDIT: If USB drive does not boot (this happened to me), it is because the target is a particular partition on the drive instead of the drive.

(Kubuntu, Lubuntu ... Xubuntu have the repository Universe activated automatically.)\nsudo add-apt-repository universe  # only for standard Ubuntu\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mkusb/ppa  # and press Enter\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install mkusb mkusb-nox usb-pack-efi\n\nInstalling this way will add not only mkusb but also some program packages that mkusb depends on.\n\n*If you want a small tool or if you don't like PPAs or don't want any extra program packages, you can use mkusb-min. This shellscript is very small compared to the other versions, yet it serves the purpose to wrap a safety belt around dd. \n$ wc mkusb-min\n 208  736 5435 mkusb-min\n\nIt should be rather easy to see what the shellscript is doing simply by reading it in a text editor.\nDownload mkusb-min from its Ubuntu help page. Run it locally or install it into a directory in PATH.\n\n*xorriso-dd-target is a new tool, intended to be uploaded to a Debian repository. The purpose is to make it very safe to create boot drives (USB pendrives or memory cards). A special feature is the plug-in method to identify the target device. The man page is available here. In January 2020 there is not yet any installer, but you can copy and paste from the links above and install the shellscript and man page manually.\n\n*Finally I want to mention bootiso which is described by its developer in another answer.\nQuestion\n\nIs there any way to create a bootable Ubuntu USB flash drive from the\n  terminal without using any third-party applications like YUMI,\n  Unetbootin, Startup Disk Creator, etc.\n\nIf we must look for text mode tools that are already installed in Ubuntu, I am afraid that there are no safe tools available. So in this case I can only suggest that you use dd or cp or cat according to many of the other answers here. But please check and double-check that you are really pointing to the intended target device before pressing the Enter key.\n(By the way, the Ubuntu Startup Disk Creator belongs to Ubuntu (is not third party), but it needs a graphical desktop environment or at least a graphical window manager.)\n\nA: If by \"third-party\" you mean \"GUI\", I suggest a lightweight script named bootiso after Avinash Raj answer, because dd does not always work. The big plus is it's very secure (performs many security checks not to mess up with the system), easy to install and portable.\nAlso, bootiso will inspect the ISO file to choose from two modes: \"image-copy\" (dd) when the ISO file is hybrid (implies: USB boot friendly). And \"mount-rsync\" mode when ISO file is non-hybrid, in which case a SYSLINUX bootloader will be automatically installed if supported [more details about install modes].\nHow to use it\nFirst option, just provide the ISO as first argument and you'll be prompted to select a drive amongst a list extracted from lsblk:\nbootiso myfile.iso\n\nOr provide explicitly the USB device:\nbootiso -d /dev/sde myfile.iso\n\nQuick install\ncurl -L https://git.io/bootiso -O\nchmod +x bootiso\nsudo apt install wimtools\n\nSee it in action\n\n\nA: You're almost there with dd, but you're missing a step.\nsudo umount /dev/sdX\nsudo dd if=/path/to/ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M && sync\n\nwhere sdX is your usb device (this can be verified with lsblk).\nThe sync bit is important as dd can return before the write operation finishes.\n\nA: Creating a bootable Ubuntu USB flash drive from terminal\n\n\n*\n\n*Place the ubuntu.iso file in any hard disk partition.\n\n*Then mount the ubuntu.iso file with the below commands in terminal:\nsudo mkdir /media/iso/\nsudo mount -o loop /path/to/ubuntu.iso /media/iso\n\n\n*Insert your USB flash drive. My drive is /dev/sdd. Here's a screenshot:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Your drive may be automatically mounted inside /media/. Let's assume that it was mounted in /media/xxx/.\n\n*Copy all files from /media/iso/ to your mounted USB flash drive by running the below command (make sure to include the dot):\ncp -a /media/iso/. /media/xxx/\n\n\n*Next, you need the ldlinux.sys file in your USB flash drive to make the USB bootable. My USB partition is /dev/sdd1; enter lsblk to see what's yours. Run the below commands:\nsudo apt-get install syslinux mtools\nsudo syslinux -s /dev/sdd1\n\n\n*Navigate to the /media/xxx mount folder and rename the isolinux directory to syslinux. Then go into the renamed folder and rename the file isolinux.cfg to syslinux.cfg.\n\n*Reboot your PC and change the boot order in BIOS to allow booting from a USB drive. Now your Ubuntu USB flash drive will boot and you can install it.\nThis method will work for any Linux distribution, not only Ubuntu.

Whatever choice I made, it seems that it stops working, I got a black screen, I could not hear the DVD turning, etc...\nI also tried to boot with a USB, same story. And I also tried to boot another computer from the DVD and this time I worked. So I don't think the CD wasn't burned correctly.\n\nA: The problems you experienced I have had many time over.

Am I supposes to type it in a notepad? Why does it not just have a .exe file where you just click it and it works? Why must Linux be so hard? Whats wrong with having a .exe file to install software? All I want to do is install VMware workstation 10.0, but Linux makes it impossible! Does anyone know a Linux distribution where if you want to install software all you have to do is double click it like in Windows, or is Linux just for intelligent people?  If someone can answer my questions that would be great. Thanks\n\nA: Most of the answers here assume you are comfortable with the terminal, however for ease of use there is a better way to run Executable code using just the graphical interface. Here's how you do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*First go to where the file has been downloaded.\n\n*Right-click on the file and select \"Properties\"\n\n*Click on the Permissions tab.\n\n\n*At the bottom you will see Allow executing file as program, make sure to tick this box (see picture below).\n\n\n*You can now click on Close and Double-Click on the file to run it.\nThe reason this isn't the default behaviour is for security reasons, to prevent people from running an application that could be untrustworthy. This technique will work on files that end with .run, .bundle, .sh and any file that appears to be a binary/installer.\nUbuntu's version of .exe is called .deb or \"Debian Package Files\". This will install similar to what you would expect in Windows, however not everyone (companies) packages installers in this way (as you have noticed). Most will however provide you with an option to download a .deb file though.\nDisclaimer: Always make sure you trust where you got the files from first before installing.\nAs a side note, you will notice that on the properties dialogue box in Windows also provides a tick box to mark an Executable as safe to run in newer versions of Windows. This option shows up on files that the OS has determined to be downloaded from the internet or from an unknown source.\n\nA: Try the following steps to install. First, download the correct architecture for your system, then just open terminal, by pressing and holding Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard. When the terminal window opens, execute the following:\nsudo chmod 755 VMware-Workstation-Full-10.0.1-1379776.i386.bundle\nsudo ./VMware-Workstation-Full-10.0.1-1379776.i386.bundle\n\nAnd that will start the installation.\n\nA: You have to change your directory to wherever you unpacked the VMware Workstation. After you have completed that, you need to follow the instructions that Mitch has put on this thread.\n\nA: If you see this error\nroot access is required for the operations you have chosen.\n\nThen you need to open a terminal and type in:\nsudo sh VMware-Workstation-10.0.1-1379776.i386.bundle\nYou need to make sure you have the file VMware-Workstation-10.0.1-1379776.i386.bundle in your home directory first.\nThis solved my problem.\n", "Q: Ubuntu works in try out but not when installed, how to fix? I've got quite a problem with it, perhaps the problem lies with me but I thought I fixed it, I believe the opposite now... Anyhow, I started off with a 64-Bit Windows 7 platform and I wanted something new then the same boring windows, I heard about Ubuntu before but I didn't see a reason to change it. Now I had found my reason, so what did I do was do the installation via an USB, I went \"try out before installation\" first and it worked perfectly, however... When I installed it, deleted my Window 7 and tried to reboot with my fresh oh-so-clean new OS, it didn't want to load. At a certain point it said to boot up from a bootable option or something like that. Where it came to was that I couldn't load it up. Now, I wanted to switch back to Windows 7 because it didn't work and now I can't switch back because my harddrive switched modus because of Linux files (From NTFS to 4ex or something, I forgot). I'm currently typing this in the try out version of Ubuntu since I can't switch back to either Windows 7 or to the installed version of Ubuntu. So, my question follows: Can I fix it by keeping Ubuntu? Because I like Ubuntu. \nAlso a side note: I'm a total noob when it comes down to this sort of things.\n\nA: I think a few youtube videos should help :\nWe all have been there at the newb stage, \njust watch guides and stuff lots of resources, i think you are screwing up at the installation of ubuntu from the USB drive, but that would be much clear after watching\nWatch Videos\n\nA: You can't go back to Windows 7, you deleted it!  You'd have to reinstall it, which you can do.  Your harddrive switching \"modes\" is just a different file system.  You are running EXT4.  If you boot off a CD and install Windows it will format it back to NTFS which Windows uses.  You can also set your harddrive to two separate modes (which I will call file systems for now on) by partitioning it into two logical drives.  \nSo, now we need more information to figure out why the install did not work.  If you have a USB key which is formatted to boot off of, I recommend running through the install again.  Boot off of the USB, choose to install instead of try, select the first option to Install Ubuntu on its own (since Windows is already deleted you said), and let it work its magic.  When you reboot, make sure the USB key is out and the only operating system your computer should be able to detect is Ubuntu.  \n", "Q: Upgrade Nag - Xubuntu 13.04 (XFCE) continually asks about updating to 13.10 I've just built a system with Xubuntu 13.04 and it's continually (~ every 15 minutes) asking if I want to upgrade to 13.10.

So adb shell has an annoying bug where it doesn't realize that your graphical terminal app is larger than 80x24, so when you try to run any kind of full-screen console apps like vi or emacs (or any ncurses app), it does not take up the full screen, only a small portion of it. Is there a way to fix this easily?\n\nA: UPDATE (Feb. 2015): By now, you can just use \"phablet-shell\". No need to fiddle around with self built scripts any more. That said, if you want to, they should still work.\n\nWhat I usually do is to use ssh instead of adb. That one configures the \nterminal properly (besides setting many other things up better than adb does).\nPut this into your ~/.bash_aliases (on the host computer, not the device)\nalias sd='adb shell start ssh; \\\n    adb forward tcp:2222 tcp:22; \\\n    ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts -R [localhost]:2222; \\\n    ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \\\n        phablet@localhost -p 2222'\n\nand close/reopen the terminal window.\nNow you can just do a \"sd\" (short for ssh device) and you'll be logged in as \nuser phablet on the phone, with a properly configured terminal and a properly \nset up user environment.\n\nA: It's not a bug in the terminal - the default setup of the shell on android is just not configured to handle changing window sizes.\nAfter you resize the actual terminal window, use the resize command - then use your fullscreen program.\n\nA: Building off of mzanetti's answer above, I've expanded it to have a couple advantages that I'm now using regularly:\nfunction adbshell {\n    adb shell start ssh\n    adb forward tcp:2222 tcp:22\n    ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts -R [localhost]:2222\n    ssh-copy-id -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \\\n        phablet@localhost -p 2222 2>/dev/null\n    scp -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \\\n        -q -P 2222 -r ~/.bash* ~/.profile* phablet@localhost:/home/phablet\n    ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \\\n        phablet@localhost -p 2222\n}\n\n\n\n*\n\n*It remembers your credentials so you don't have to type your password every time\n\n*It copies your bash config from the host to the device so you can use all your favorite aliases (and custom prompt config!)\n\nA: When I plan to be in {adb shell} for any length of time, I usually start off with\nstty columns 132\n\nI use it regularly on both rooted and un-rooted devices.\nAcknowledging that it's a manual command everytime you start a shell (and not automatic like the mzanetti/robru solution) it's simple and doesn't require a change to using SSH.\n", "Q: How to set up FQDN with Dynamic IP? Can I setup my www.example.com address when I have a dynamic external ip adress (no router) and if so whats needed to make it work?\nThe server is already installed with Ubuntu Server 12.04.3 and LAMP packages and works.\nI would like to use a domain name instead of the ip address since it changes.\n\nA: I use a dynamic dns provider such as dyndns* and then alias the fqdn to the name that is provided by the dynamic dns service.  For example dyndns provides a hostname such as myhouse.dyndns.org and then a simple cname alias is created pointing www.example.com to myhouse.dyndns.org and voila!\n\n\n*\n\n*this is not an endorsement for dyndns service, I am not associated with their service nor do I recommend it, but it is an example of how this can be done.\n\n\nA: Use a DNS hosting service that provides dynamic DNS services, and follow their instructions to configure your server. You'll likely be instructed to install a program like ddclient.\nRecommendations for DNS hosting services are beyond the scope of Ask Ubuntu.\n\nA: By the contents, this has more to do with your DNS provider then Ubuntu. If your server works using the IP, then the only thing that you need is a DNS provider that offers Dynamic DNS services (like DynDNS in your tags, or OpenDNS, etc....). You will need to pay both, the domain name (1 time pay) and the DNS to maintain it. Then configure Apache to resolve correctly the FQND and you are set.\n\nA: Adding to other answers:\nI'd recommend using a static IP since dynamic DNS inherently brings potential problems related to caching:  Even after the IP is updated, it can take tens of minutes before it propagates to most of the Internet.  And in some places it can be even worse since sadly not all local DNS servers / clients respect TTLs properly.\nCombined with how often IP changes and the costs for DDNS itself and costs of downtime, actually paying for the static IP might come cheaper.\n\nA: In order to use the dynamic DNS client, you first need to register at least one hostname (actually a fully qualified domain name—FQDN) with DynDNS.com.\nThe dynamic DNS client can work with the the Dynamic Hosts option, which is the option to use if you don't own a domain name, but you want to host a server on your network and have people reach it by entering a domain name.\nDynamic hosts are free to register with DynDNS.com, and allow you to associate a\ndynamic IP address with up to five of the static domain names that DynDNS.com provide.\nDynamic host IP associations require at least one update every 35 days to prevent them\nfrom expiring.\nSource:How to Configure DDNS\n", "Q: How do I submit a patch to a Launchpad project? With a Git/GitHub background and knowing very little about Bazaar VCS, I would like to occasionally report a bug to projects hosted on Launchpad, and even send a patch.  I'd like to do it in a \"proper\" way so that it's ready for merging or improvement while not getting in way.\nI can't seem to find a decent simple How-to suited for my needs.\nWhat I did so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have created a Launchpad account,\n\n*reported the bug,\n\n*installed Bazaar and setup SSH keys etc.\nNow if it was GitHub, I'd\n\n\n*\n\n*fork the repo,\n\n*clone the forked repo,\n\n*create a sanely named branch and do the work,\n\n*commit + push,\n\n*create a pull request using GitHub WUI.\nBut it's not GitHub, and both Launchpad and Bazaar architectures seem quite different from their GitHub/Git counterparts.\nSo could a kind soul save me from drowning in tons of documents and compile a straightforward step path, mainly the second part?  Possibly including relevant CLI commands when they are needed?\n\nEdit: It seems that I should clarify if I'm asking specifically about Ubuntu packages (whatever it means) or Launchpad projects.\nI don't really care much about distinction between Ubuntu packages and non-Ubuntu packages.  Any software could be in Ubuntu today and out of it tomorrow, or vice-versa.  The development is what matters much more than distribution.\nSo I was assuming that\n\n\n*\n\n*not every single package distributed in Ubuntu is hosted on Launchpad,\n\n*an \"official\" or \"default\" workflow for Launchpad exists (well if all devs can\nagree on using Bazaar, why couldn't most of them agree on a patching workflow?),\nso I'm asking about the Launchpad way, not the Ubuntu way.  And I chose AU because since the intersection is vast, I guess it's pretty on topic here.\n\nA: Intitial answer based on dobey's answer here and Jorge Castro's answer to a project-specific question. Edits/corrections/suggestions welcome.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a Launchpad account. This will include a Launchpad username (LP-USER)\n\n*Add your SSH key to launchpad at https://launchpad.net/~LP-USER/+editsshkeys\n\n*On Launchpad, note the project name (PROJECT-NAME).\n\n*Report the issue against the project. The issue will be assigned a bug number (000000).\n\n*Make sure Bazaar is installed dpkg-query -l bzr. You may want to read up on Bazaar/Launchpad integration.\n\n*Configure bzr with bzr whoami \"Your Name <name@example.com>\" and bzr launchpad-login LP-USER\n\n*On your machine, check out a local branch of the project\nbzr branch lp:PROJECT-NAME\n\n(This will create a folder called PROJECT-NAME containing the latest project code.)\n\n*Get the project running. Make changes. Test your changes. (These steps are project- and issue-specific.)\n\n*Commit your changes, including the bug number (000000).\nbzr commit --fixes=lp:000000\n\n\n*That will open a commit dialog where you can add a changelog entry explaining your changes.\n\n*Push your changes to Launchpad. (This will create a new remote branch associated with your account.)\nbzr push lp:~LP-USER/PROJECT-NAME/NEW-BRANCH-NAME\n\n(NEW-BRANCH-NAME should be a short descriptive name of the issue fixed / feature added)\n\n*Open branch in your browser with bzr lp-open or by going to https://code.launchpad.net/~LP-USER/PROJECT-NAME/NEW-BRANCH-NAME/\n\n*Propose a merge with bzr lp-propose or from the URL in the last step by selecting \"Propose for merging\", adding a description, paste in lp:PROJECT-NAME for the branch you want to propose into and click Submit. \n\nA: Is it a Launchpad project?\n(If you already know that it is a Launchpad project, you can skip this.)\nNot all projects found on Launchpad are actually hosted and developed there - some are mirrors of code hosted elsewhere (GitHub/Gitorious/etc), others come from Debian. These original sources are known as \"upstream\" projects, and it is usually best to submit patches at the source and let the changes arrive \"downstream\" in Ubuntu (usually in the next release).\nIt should be clearly indicated on the project page whether it is hosted elsewhere or on Launchpad. If not, just ask the project maintainers how they wish to receive changes. Some upstream projects prefer simple patch files, others prefer submissions/pushes via their respective hosts.\nAs a special note, official Ubuntu packages (software stored in the official Ubuntu repositories that you can install from the Software Center) have a few different ways to submit patches, as many of those packages come directly from Debian, and should ideally be fixed there rather than only in Ubuntu. (This is a whole other question.)\nHow to submit a patch\nThe general way to submit a patch is that you make your branch, commit to it locally and push it back to Launchpad:\nbzr push lp:~user/project/branch-name\n\nYou can then propose your branch to merge into the parent you branched from, either via the web site, or using the bzr lp-propose command.\nIf you've filed a bug, and your branch does fix it, be sure to do the following when committing, where 000000 is replaced with your bug number, assuming it is a bug reported on Launchpad, and not elsewhere instead.\nbzr commit --fixes=lp:000000\n\nA note on \"default\" workflow\nThis is pretty much the typical modern workflow, that you may compare to GitHub. Launchpad has been around a bit longer though, so this workflow evolved after the fact, rather than being built into the system from the beginning, so some older projects may rely on other methods of accepting patches. Most all newer projects rely on this workflow though, where on GitHub the \"pull requests\" have always been there, and people just default to using it because there was never a means to do something different on GitHub.\n", "Q: Attempt start postgres server fails and gives no response?

The CR character causes the cursor to move back to the beginning of the line after the shell prints the beginning of the message and so you only get to see the part after CR which ends the interpreter string that's part of the error message.\nRemove the CR: the shebang line needs to have a Unix line ending (linefeed only). Python itself allows CRLF line endings, so the CR characters on other lines don't hurt. Shell scripts on the other hand must be free of CR characters.\nTo remove the Windows line endings, you can use dos2unix:\nsudo dos2unix /usr/local/bin/casperjs\n\nor sed:\nsudo sed -i -e 's/\\r$//' /usr/local/bin/casperjs\n\nIf you must edit scripts under Windows, use an editor that copes with Unix line endings (i.e. something less brain-dead than Notepad) and make sure that it's configured to write Unix line endings (i.e. LF only) when editing a Unix file.\n\nA: I am using Visual Studio Code and am new to the text editor. I was receiving the same error and tried manually following steps in this post, it did not work for me. However, in Visual Studio Code bottom right corner provides an option to switch between CR and LF on the fly, problem solved. I am not sure if this applies but if you are programming in a text editor it may provide a simple answer by providing a button to switch.\n", "Q: ubuntu doesn't boot after installing quadro drivers so I installed a 2nd graphic card, installed the proprietary driver for it (nvidia quadro), but now when I boot the computer, the purple screen loads for a while and then all I get it's a black screen with a blinking cursor.\nI've taken the 2nd card out but it doesn't change anything.  \nI am preparing a usb stick to boot from it and try to access my system: is there anything I can do to fix this?\nit's a ubuntu 13.10 64 bits\n\nA: sorry, I found out shortly after posting, thanks to this answer:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/352099/16726\n\n\n*\n\n*enter recovery mode (keep left shift pressed, after BIOS is loaded, or ctrl+alt+F1 from black screen and sudo su)\n\n*apt-get remove --purge nvidia*\n\n*shutdown -r now\n", "Q: After installing NVIDIA drivers, I boot into a black screen [13.10] Edit: Trying solution after solution found on these forums with the bootloader has apparently corrupted the bootloader.

(I'm not a specialist but that's how I see it) I'm using Mac OS X 10.9 and I followed number of tutorials how to set up TFTP and DHCP server and I got PLOP here, but when I boot up with PXE it says that it found DHCP but TFTP timed out.\nAny help or alternative way of rescuing old laptop? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: I had an old laptop with a touchscreen, which I wanted to use for a project. It had a small (2GB) harddisk with Debian on it, which was missing some features I needed (missing drivers for the graphics adapter and no touch calibration tools)\nThe BIOS only supported booting from a floppy drive (with a special connector) or a CD-ROM drive (PCMCIA), neither of which i have, and finally, PXE boot.\nNot being able to boot from USB, and not having access to the proper hardware, what to do, when I wanted to install Ubuntu?\nTo solve this, I began searching for PXE articles. I ran across this article on PXE on Ubuntu 15.04 (note that articles for previous versions deviated very much from 15.04 configuration files, etc.)\nI decided to experiment, so i created a Virtual machine running with bridged networking, with a plain Ubuntu 15.04 server, configuring the server as stated, with apache2, tftpd-hpa, inetutils-inetd. I also made sure that I had the server-i386 flavor of the ISO, since the netboot file needed was not avaiable on the other ISOs.\nAn extra issue was that I have a router with DHCP already, and since the machine being installed on needs an IP from the server I had set up in order to get the required settings for the tftp server. My solution was to unplug my switch from my router, start up the laptop, let it get the ip address, and boot ubuntu load screen, and then replug the router, and pause the virtual machine running my PXE server. This is definitely an approach I would use in the future when installing Ubuntu on ancient hardware.\n\nA: You can move its HDD to another machine, install full system or just grub, then move it back. Linux have all drivers, so in most cases it will boot without any problem.\nAnother way, by using USB/IDE adapter, if you can't mount in the other machine or not allowed.\nWith Grub2 and enough RAM, you can setup Grub ISO Boot. So you can install new system without need of any external device. See Grub2/ISOBoot/Examples\nAdvice, better to make a separate /boot partition. If new system installation failed, you have a grub boot at least.\n", "Q: How to install boost 1.53 or 1.54 from terminal? I'd like to install boost 1.53 or 1.54 from terminal in Ubuntu 12.04.

I decided to dualboot my computer a few weeks ago and I've come across a few issues, this being the most important.\nIt works perfectly fine on my Windows 7 install, but not on Ubuntu.\nI'm using 13.04.\n\nA: I experienced a lot of problems also.  After I finally got it working it turns out the steps are:\n1) Install Wine (to extract the drivers from the manufacturer's download).  If you already have the drivers folder from a different installation you don't need to install Wine.\n2) Install the ndiswrapper modules (ndiswrapper-dkms ndisgtk ndiswrapper-common ndiswrapper-source ndiswrapper-utils-1.9).\n3) Grab the drivers folder (ie.

However my dell can now connect with the shared files of my laptop (after giving my password for these files) but my laptop can not connect with the shared files of my dell. \nIt does prompt me for a password though but I do not have any samba users setup since I can't start samba (it isn't even listed in the dash but it must have changed something since I can now access files on remote pc's). \nI disabled ufw on both computers so the install is a vanilla 13.10 besides for synergy and my laptop can access remote files on other computers and can be accessed by other computers.\nAnyone any idea how to fix this?\n\nA: Fixed it by installing ubuntu 13.04\nDidn't figure out why\n", "Q: What are socket files? Recently, I started using tmux; I'm trying to use the pair programming feature in that software.\nDuring the process a socket file was created.\nMy question is: what are socket files, how am I to open them on Ubuntu and how are they used?\n\nA: Sockets are a special file type, similar to TCP/IP sockets, providing inter-process networking protected by the file system's access control.\nFor example, when you open a listening socket in one terminal with netcat:\nnc -lU socket.sock\n\nthen send data from another terminal by:\necho mytext | nc -U socket.sock\n\nmytext appears on the first terminal.   \nBy default nc stops listening after an End-of-File character.\n\nA: A unix domain socket is a bidirectional pipe similar to a TCP/IP socket.  A server listens for and accepts connections from clients, and then can communicate with the client on the newly accepted connection.  What is special about unix domain sockets is that instead of having an IP address and port number, they have a file name as their address.  This allows other applications that know nothing about networking to be told to open the file and read or write and the data is sent to the server instead of to the disk.\n", "Q: Can't upgrade due to not enough space in /boot /boot$ ls\nabi-3.8.0-19-generic         initrd.img-3.8.0-29-generic\nabi-3.8.0-25-generic         lost+found\nabi-3.8.0-26-generic         memtest86+.bin\nabi-3.8.0-27-generic         memtest86+_multiboot.bin\nabi-3.8.0-29-generic         System.map-3.8.0-19-generic\nabi-3.8.0-30-generic         System.map-3.8.0-25-generic\nabi-3.8.0-31-generic         System.map-3.8.0-26-generic\nconfig-3.8.0-19-generic      System.map-3.8.0-27-generic\nconfig-3.8.0-25-generic      System.map-3.8.0-29-generic\nconfig-3.8.0-26-generic      System.map-3.8.0-30-generic\nconfig-3.8.0-27-generic      System.map-3.8.0-31-generic\nconfig-3.8.0-29-generic      vmlinuz-3.8.0-19-generic\nconfig-3.8.0-30-generic      vmlinuz-3.8.0-25-generic\nconfig-3.8.0-31-generic      vmlinuz-3.8.0-26-generic\ngrub                         vmlinuz-3.8.0-27-generic\ninitrd.img-3.8.0-19-generic  vmlinuz-3.8.0-29-generic\ninitrd.img-3.8.0-25-generic  vmlinuz-3.8.0-30-generic\ninitrd.img-3.8.0-26-generic  vmlinuz-3.8.0-31-generic\ninitrd.img-3.8.0-27-generic\n\nA: My advice is to install Ubuntu Tweak to remove old kernels if you are unhappy or unwilling to remove them via the Terminal.\n1 - Ubuntu Tweak Download\nOnce you have installed Ubuntu Tweak, open the application up.\n2 - Click on Start Janitor\n\nSelect Old Kernel & then click Clean\n\nEnter your password when asked, press enter and now only the old Linux Kernels will be removed.\n", "Q: Configure Ubuntu 13.10 to rotate display globally?

I've recently upgraded from 13.04 to 13.10 and realized my terminal bash history is not surviving reboots.\ncat ~/.bash_history gave me a permissions denied error.\nI, possibly unnecessarily or wrongly, issued a chmod 777 ~/.bash_history to see if that would help...and although I could then cat and read some contents it contained not much of anything as far as history.\nI also tried sudo rm ~/.bash_history after reading bash history not being preserved\nStrangely, after doing that, I typed a few test commands, ls, ls -lah ... and upon pressing the up arrow to go back through history it contained those two commands as well as the odd history from some far off time in the past but very few results and not the hundreds of commands I typed earlier in the day.\nIs there a new place bash history is stored? How can removing ~/.bash_history not get rid of the commands that are somehow lingering? I am not certain, but I believe my root bash history is acting normal. My user bash history is what's causing me trouble. Any help and guidance in tracking down and solving this problem is appreciated.\n\nA: Run:\nsudo chown bob:bob ~/.bash_history && chmod 660 ~/.bash_history\n\n\nA: the correct solution is to ensure correct permissions on your .bash_history file\n\n\n*\n\n*get your user and group information using the 'id' tool. output should look like: uid=1000(myuser) gid=1000(mygroup)\n\n*change ownership of the file: sudo chown myuser:mygroup ~/.bash_history\n\n*change permissions of the file: sudo chmod 0644 ~/.bash_history\noutside of /tmp there is NO problem that chmod 777 fixes. you should stop using that permission set, entirely, until you're fully aware of the implications.\n\nA: Even faster without having to fiddle with chown and chmod:\nLogged in as the user whose history is not saved:\nsudo rm ~/.bash_history\ntouch ~/.bash_history\n\nMake sure not to type any command between the 2 above\n\nA: As pathetic as it sounds, this resolved itself after a reboot. I'm not sure what that means and I hate offering a resolution with such a generic solution. Maybe a reboot is necessary after removing and recreating the ~/.bash_history I'm not sure why and nowhere did I read that was a requirement.

I've read dozens of posts but still have questions.  \nI have a work server whose traffic should never leave my house without encryption.  The VPN is PPTP.  Currently I have a cron job that checks the status of the ppp0 adapter each minute.  If the connection drops, which it does fairly often, it shuts key components down.\nIt's fairly easy to restart PPTP with \"nmcli con up id 'myVPNServer'\" but there's no assurance it will reconnect and I need a better way to stop traffic (other than killing apps) when ppp0 is down.  \nThe two options I've seen discussed are the firewall (UFW, Firestarter, IPTables) or the route tables.  I could be easily swayed to consider the firewall option but I focused on the route tables since no new function needs to be started.    \nMy questions involve the way the route tables change and then specifics on rules. \nWhen I start the PPTP VPN the route tables change.  That suggests that if the VPN drops, the table will change back, defeating my stated intent of preventing external traffic.  How can I make \"sticky\" changes to the route table that will persist even if the VPN connection drops?  Perhaps the check boxes \"Ignore automatically obtained routes\" or \"Use this connection only for resources on it's network\" (which are part of the VPN configuration options)?\nIt would seem that, if I can force the active VPN route table to stay in effect, even when the VPN drops, that this will effectively kill any external traffic should the VPN drop.  This will give me the latitude to run a routine to restart the VPN from the command line (assuming the route table rules don't prevent me re-establishing the connection).\nMy route table, with the VPN active is (ip route list):\nWhat process is modifying the route table (when I start the VPN)?\nAny comments on what 10.10.1.1 is?\n$ ip route list\ndefault dev ppp0  proto static \n10.10.1.1 dev ppp0  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.10.1.11 \nVPN_Server_IP_Address via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0  proto static \nVPN_Server_IP_Address via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0  src 192.168.1.60 \n169.254.0.0/16 dev eth0  scope link  metric 1000 \n192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.1.60  metric 1 \n\n\nA: Hope the example config can give you an idea to another approach. E.g: execute scripts to do whatever you would like on ppp0 \"up\\down..\" events. You can use the predown script to stop all your services, lockdown all the traffic in the firewall and flush the routing table.\n zcat /usr/share/doc/ifupdown/examples/network-interfaces.gz | less\n\n# /etc/network/interfaces -- configuration file for ifup(8), ifdown(8)\n##...\n# The \"pre-up\", \"up\", \"down\" and \"post-down\" options are valid for all\n# interfaces, and may be specified multiple times. All other options\n# may only be specified once.\n\nI assume it is the NetworkManager that is modifying your routing table. The configuration files for the NetworkManager can be found in /etc/NetworkManager/*\nAdd the following under [ipv4] for your (pptp) connecetion:\nignore-auto-routes=true\nignore-auto-dns=true\n\nI assume you need to restart the pptp connection for it to become active.

Or why my script stops after apt-get finished, and how to make it to continue?\n\nA: First off, you're not running a script. Pasting a series of commands doesn't make a script. As described in Jobin's answer, you would not have this problem if you were actually using a script.  \nThe problem is probably that you're overloading the input buffer with the commands and hoping that bash is the next process to read from the input buffer. There are a lot of reasons that apt-get would read from the input buffer instead, so nothing is left when it finishes and drops you back to bash.  \nIf you want, you can still paste a series of commands without going to the trouble of copying or writing a script file and making it executable. (Creating the script would be a waste of effort in many cases, for example a simple set of commands that you have to do on multiple machines and never twice on the same machine.)  \nIf you paste the series of commands separated by semicolons, the whole sequence gets fed to bash and will continue regardless of what apt does with the input buffer:\napt-get -y install gcc g++ make cmake perl; cd ~/; mkdir t1; cd t1\n\nA: You shouldn't be copy-pasting the commands in the script on the terminal, the script should be executed on the terminal. The problem with the first approach is, as soon as the first command get pasted along with the new-line at the end of it, apt-get begins executing which prevents further commands from being pasted on the terminal, so they won't be executing.\nTo execute a script, write the commands to a file run.sh(or any name you want) as follows:\n#!/bin/bash\napt-get -y install gcc g++ make cmake perl\n\ncd ~/\nmkdir t1\ncd t1\n\nand then to execute it on a terminal, type bash run.sh or bash filename (replace filename by the name you have given to the script). The first line of this script tells which shell to use in case you directly run the script(by first making it executable using chmod +x filename) and then running the script as /path/filename.\n\nA: I had the same problem but was not very happy with the solutions here or the solutions did not work for me.\nWhat I found out to get it running is to send a NULL input to apt-get, so that it continues to work.\nIt looks like this:\napt-get -y install gcc g++ make cmake perl  < \"/dev/null\"\n\ncd ~/\nmkdir t1\ncd t1\n\n#newline\n\nHope other people can use this too! Don't forget the newline so that the last command will also be executed\n\nA: apt-get sometimes exits with non-zero code even it installed successfully.\nAnd that makes script to halt. This is nonsense and ridiculous but I have to workaround this. I tried to force it to continue by wrapping apt-get block with sub-script so exit code to be ignored.\nset -e\n\nbash << +END\napt-get -y install gcc g++ make cmake perl\nexit 0\n+END\necho $?\n\ncd ~/\nmkdir t1\ncd t1\n\nActually I expected the inside bash would exit with non-zero code - so outside script would quit cascade - but it didn't and execution continued.\n", "Q: forbidden folder name in apache?

You have to look in your apache configuration /etc/apache2/apache2.conf or other files in the folder /etc/apache2/ to find out.\nIf it's not that please add to your question what /var/log/apache2/error.log says when you navigate to this folder via web browser.\n\nA: First, you have a folder \"Documents\" in your /home/$USER folder where you should be keeping your documents(not necessarily, but keeps thing organised).\nSecondly, there are no blacklisted folders on linux(let alone on Ubuntu), if they are created by you, you should have the access to it(because you are the owner). Are you sure you are looking at the right folder's permissions?\n", "Q: Installing FTP and adding user to FTP account I installed ftp on a ubuntu server and now want to add a user.

It works for me when when ran as sudo, but only as sudo. I have installed webupd8's Unity patched Nemo, but it has the same symptoms (preview of media files fail unless ran as sudo).\nI resolved this (rather worked around this bug) by running 'sudo chmod -R 777 /home/x/.cache/thumbnails/'. 777 is required (tried all other combos that make sense, but only 777 works).

As a result, the database can become out of sync with the filesystem for a time after you add or remove files.  The database is updated when the updatedb command is run, which is usually scheduled to be done once a day.  Hence, it is normal for locate to still show files immediately after you have removed them.\n\nA: Do the Command updatedb & , then Try to locate it Won't be there..\nThe Database have not updated So what it shows that file was there, Once the updatedb Done It will Not Show in locate ..\n", "Q: can't boot freeze at login I am trying login and my system just freezes.\nI was messing around with my Catalyst driver trying to get my dual 7950s into crossfire mode and it would work..so in my terminal I typed startx and then it locked up.

In my terminal prompt definition in my .bashrc file, among other things, I have this snippet of code:\n${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\n\nWhat does this do, and do I need it?\n\nA: Generally, ${var:+value} means:\nif $var is defined and not null; then use 'value'; else do nothing\n\nThe debian_chroot variable is defined in /etc/bash.bashrc file. It takes the content of /etc/debian_chroot file if this file exists and is readable. By default this file doesn't exists.\nFor more details, see:\n\n*\n\n*What is $debian_chroot in .bashrc?\n\n*Understand this .bashrc script (curly braces, eval, …)\nNow, to understand better what exactly it is happening there, do the following in terminal:\nradu@Radu:~$ PS1='${var:+($var)}\\u@\\h:\\w\\$ '\nradu@Radu:~$ var=\"test\"\n                  ----\n                   |\n  ------------------\n  |\n  V\n(test)radu@Radu:~$ var=\"\"\nradu@Radu:~$ var=\"and so on\"\n(and so on)radu@Radu:~$\n\nA: If the environment variable $debian_chroot exists and is not empty ${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)} is replaced by ($debian_chroot) (that is the value of $debian_chroot with parens around it).\n$debian_chroot is set in /etc/bash.bashrc to the contents of /etc/debian_chroot if that file exists (it doesn't by default) and $debian_chroot doesn't have a value yet.\n${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)} is usually used to define your Bash prompt, for example\nPS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h:\\w\\$ '\n\nAs the name suggests you can use this variable to indicate which chroot you are in by placing etc/debian_chroot into your chroot root folders. \nIf you don't know what a chroot is chances are you don't need that ;-) But you still may abuse it to include some other information into your Bash prompt\nBy default it doesn't do anything.\n\nA: The important part to answer this question is this snippet from /etc/bash.bashrc:\nif [ -z \"$debian_chroot\" ] && [ -r /etc/debian_chroot ]; then\n    debian_chroot=$(cat /etc/debian_chroot)\nfi\n\nIt means if the variable $debian_chroot is empty and the file /etc/debian_chroot exists and is readable the variable is set to the content of the file.\nNow what is this for? The file /etc/debian_chroot is when you have a chrooted debian system inside another debian system (ubuntu is based on debian). So this is for a better overview. To distinguish whether you are in the chroot or not.\nWhen you have a chroot of another system for example in /srv/nfs4/netboot/ you can set a name for this chroot in /srv/nfs4/netboot/etc/debian_chroot (in my case it's a nfs4 pxe netboot drive):\nuser@host:~# echo \"netboot\" >/srv/nfs4/netboot/etc/debian_chroot\n\nAnd then when you chroot inside:\nchroot /srv/nfs4/netboot/\n\nYour prompt looks like this:\n(netboot)user@host:~#\n\n\nA: If you never need to use debian_chroot then it's a handy place to put the time the command prompt was displayed by using:\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND='debian_chroot=$(date +%r)'\n\nType this in your terminal and watch your command prompt change with the time:\nrick@alien:~$ export PROMPT_COMMAND='debian_chroot=$(date +%r)'\n\n(09:14:59 PM)rick@alien:~$ \n\nAfter the time is set once, to get a running clock which updates every second use:\nwhile sleep 1;do tput sc;tput cup $(($(tput lines)-1)) 1;printf `date +%r`;tput rc;done &\n\n", "Q: How do keyboard shortcuts work in Ubuntu?

I checked for the libc version on my Ubuntu 64bit 12.10 machine by issuing the command ldd --version.\nI saw that Ubuntu uses eglibc instead of glibc. As egiblc is for embedded machines, Is there a specific reason why Ubuntu uses it instead of the standard glibc.\n\nA: Except they have now switched back:\nSince the beginning of 2014, the official homepage states that EGLIBC is no longer being developed, since its \"goals are now being addressed directly in GLIBC\", and Debian has switched back to glibc[4] for the Debian 8.0 (Jessie) release. -- Wikipedia\n\nA: Ubuntu is based on debian. This is an abridgment of Wikipedia:\n\nOn 6 May 2009, it was announced that Debian would move from the GNU C\n  Library to EGLIBC, citing problems with the development process of\n  glibc. Debian and several of its derivatives now ship EGLIBC\n  instead of glibc. EGLIBC is free software licensed under the GNU LGPL.\n\nThese are the reasons (form Debian is switching to EGLIBC):\n\nThe EGLIBC is a variant of the GLIBC which stays source and binary\n  compatible with the original GLIBC. While primarily targeted for\n  embedded architectures, it has some really nice points:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*More friendly upstream (especially with regard to embedded    architectures): “Encourage cooperation, communication, civility, and\n  respect among developers” (as opposed to this).\n  \n*Stable branch with fixes for important bugs (a real one, not like the GLIBC one which is left unchanged).\n  \n*Better support for embedded architectures.\n  \n*Support for different shells (GLIBC only supports bash).\n  \n*Support for building with -Os.\n  \n*Configurable components (do we really need NIS or RPC support in debian-installer?).\n  \n*Better testsuite for optimized or biarch packages.\n  \n\n", "Q: How to set Grub Password Red Hat Linux has grub-md5-crypt for setting up a grub password.

This means that your BIOS is set correctly. The problem could now lie in the installation media. I suggest remaking the USB drive with Universal USB Installer, or try a different USB drive. Make sure that the USB drive is formatted to FAT32. Also try to check your installation media, or just download the ISO again. If push comes to shove, you could always try burning the ISO to a CD or DVD and boot from there.

I often check for updates and there are times that Ubuntu downloads and installs an entry that is labeled generic. Every time this happens, a new GRUB boot entry is created. My question is, should I change the boot entry to the latest generic or should I leave it to the default 'Ubuntu' entry?\n\nA: When y new entry in grub appears this means that a new linux kernel is installed and you can boot this kernel. Ubuntu leaves the old kernel also in the grub configuration (and in the folder /boot/) that you can boot from the old kernel too, if everything went wrong.\nDifferent kernel variants:\n\n\n*\n\n*generic kernel - this is the stock kernel that is provided by default\nin Ubuntu.\n\n*preempt kernel - this kernel is based on the -generic\nkernel source tree but is built with different configurations\n(settings) to reduce latency. Also known as a soft real-time kernel.\n\n*rt kernel - is based on the Ubuntu kernel source tree with Ingo\nMolnar maintained PREEMPT_RT patch applied to it. Also know as a hard\nreal-time kernel.\n\n*lowlatency kernel - very similar to the -preempt\nkernel and based on the -generic kernel source tree, but uses a more\naggressive configuration to further reduce latency. Also know as a\nsoft real-time kernel.\n\n*realtime kernel - is based on the vanilla kernel source tree with Ingo Molnar maintained PREEMPT_RT patch applied to it. Also know as a hard real-time kernel. \n\n\nThe generic kernel is the default kernel of Ubuntu.\nSo your question:\nIt's up to you. I would recommend using the new generic kernel so you are always up to date. To estimate which kernel at the moment is running type this in the command line:\nuser@host:~# uname -r\n3.5.0-23-generic\n\n", "Q: bash: syntax error near unexpected token `(' I am trying to download flareget download manager via wget\nI get error\nwget  http://www.flareget.com/files/flareget/debs/amd64/flareget_2.3-24_amd64(stable)_deb.tar.gz\nbash: syntax error near unexpected token `('\n\nWhy is that error coming and what is the solution for that?\n\nA: Mine had nothing to do with un-escaped brackets and everything to do with an alias already being defined with the same name as the function.\nAlias in one file:\nalias foo=\"echo do something\"\n\nFunction in another:\nfoo() {\n    # Do something else\n}\n\nBoth of these files were sourced by my ~/.bashrc, giving me the unhelpful error message:\nsyntax error near unexpected token (\n\n\nA: You should use single quotes ' or double quotes \" around the URL in this case (and in general):\nwget  'http://www.flareget.com/files/flareget/debs/amd64/flareget_2.3-24_amd64(stable)_deb.tar.gz'\n\nFrom now, you should use this method in general when you use a string which contain parentheses as argument in a command. That is because parentheses are used for grouping by the shell such that they are not communicated in any way to a command. So, the bash shell will give you a syntax error:\n$ echo some (parentheses)\nbash: syntax error near unexpected token `('\n$ echo 'some (parentheses)'\nsome (parentheses)\n\n\nA: It's because of the brackets. You need to escape them like this:\nwget  http://www.flareget.com/files/flareget/debs/amd64/flareget_2.3-24_amd64\\(stable\\)_deb.tar.gz\n\nNow it should work.\n", "Q: Which user agent string does the Web browser on mobile devices have I'd like to know which User Agent string (UA) the Ubuntu Web Browser app on mobile devices has, and which implications does that have on existing web sites?\nE.g. will most sites behave correctly with it? Is there some kind of fallback UA in case some web sites wouldn't work with it? \n\nA: The current default UA string is of the following form:\nMozilla/5.0 (Ubuntu; <formFactor>) WebKit/<webkitVersion>\n\nwhere <formFactor> is one of Mobile, Tablet or Desktop, and <webkitVersion> is the version of WebKit rendering engine (currently 537.21).\nSo on a phone, the current default UA string is:\nMozilla/5.0 (Ubuntu; Mobile) WebKit/537.21\n\nThis default UA string is deliberately short, the rationale is based on Mozilla’s B2G UA string research.\nA number of websites and web applications are known not to play well with this default UA (web sites these days do a lot of crazily complicated server-side UA parsing to infer platform capabilities and serve customized content accordingly).\nTo overcome those issues, the Ubuntu Touch browser embeds an override mechanism that allows overriding the default UA for a given domain name (usually adding an Android token gets us the right content, although it often comes at the price of annoying prompts to install native android applications, which of course doesn’t apply to the platform).\nThis mechanism is a short-term workaround.\nThe proper long-term solution is evangelism, whereby users and developers get in touch with website authors to request that their pages and applications recognize our default UA string and serve adequate content.\nNote that in a near future we’ll be switching from QtWebKit to Oxide (a thin layer on top of the Chromium Content API) for the rendering engine, meaning the rendering and capabilities will be virtually the same as Chrome’s. To reflect this and to enhance compatibility with existing websites, we will need to update the default UA string (it will be closer to Chrome’s default UA on devices).\n\nA: The Ubuntu Touch UA is: Mozilla/5.0 (Ubuntu; $FormFactor) WebKit/$WebKitRev where the $FormFactor variable is \"Mobile\" OR \"Tablet\" and the $WebKitRev contains the WebKit engine's version. Also the major version \"5.0\" can change in the time.\nPlease note that a modern browser's UA can be changed by a plugin or by a simple reconfiguration; also you should know as a developer that the SEO don't like the content based on User Agent. If you need to recognize the User Agent don't do an exact match (\"A\"==\"A\") but do a substring search for the substrings Ubuntu AND (Mobile OR Tablet) to prevent compatibility problems with future versions of the mobile software.\nPlease note that the mobile browser of the Ubuntu Touch can change the UA in real-time to fix (obviously) some incompatibilities: another time, don't rely only on that mechanism.\nHave a nice day,\nlet us know if you have more questions.\n\nSource: daker.me\n\nA: There is a simpler way to check the user-agent string sent by any browser. You can simply visit http://www.murl.mobi/headers.php and this page extracts and displays the HTTP request headers. A recent post on user-agent analysis using python gives a programmatic approach to analyze the actual user-agent string seen by a web-sever.\n", "Q: undo: sudo update-rc.d -f ondemand remove As the question says, I issued sudo update-rc.d -f ondemand remove cause that's what an article on configuring TLP says... but after doing the \"configurations\" my graphics went back to crap.

So the daemon is no longer executed while switching to the configured runlevel (or at bootup).\nI looked at my machine what's the default configuration of this service:\nuser@host:~# find /etc/rc* -name \"*ondemand*\"\n/etc/rc2.d/S99ondemand\n/etc/rc3.d/S99ondemand\n/etc/rc4.d/S99ondemand\n/etc/rc5.d/S99ondemand\n\nSo, we see the daemon starts in runlevels 2, 3, 4 and 5 with start number 99. To set that back to this configuration type:\nuser@host:~# update-rc.d ondemand start 99 2 3 4 5 .\n Adding system startup for /etc/init.d/ondemand ...\n   /etc/rc2.d/S99ondemand -> ../init.d/ondemand\n   /etc/rc3.d/S99ondemand -> ../init.d/ondemand\n   /etc/rc4.d/S99ondemand -> ../init.d/ondemand\n   /etc/rc5.d/S99ondemand -> ../init.d/ondemand\n\nEdit\nAccording to the script /etc/init.d/ondemand the script sets every cpu governor to ondemand for every cpu that supports this setting.\n\n\n*\n\n*A (scaling-)governor manages how the cpufrequency is adjusted automatically.\n\n*ondemand means that the frequency is adjusted to the current needs. The frequency can so change rapidly up or down.\n\n\nYou can find out which governors are available for your cpus by:\nuser@host:~$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors\nuserspace powersave conservative ondemand performance\nuserspace powersave conservative ondemand performance\nuserspace powersave conservative ondemand performance\nuserspace powersave conservative ondemand performance\n\nSo yes it's the same configuration for all machines.\n", "Q: How to disable automatic copy when selecting text from the keyboard?

Is it possible to kill the GUI and end up with a CLI since the GUI runs on the top of the shell?\nI have check the question below\nHow to kill and to start the X server?\nMagic keys restarted the GUI and I ended up with the login menu but not a CLI\nI am using Ubuntu 12.04 , I dont want to use virtual terminal I just want to prove to myself that the GUI runs on top of the shell and I can always exit the GUI to the shell\nThanks \n\nA: To shut down your X session type in the command line:\nsudo service lightdm stop\n\nSo you will end up in the virtual terminal #7. You then can hit Ctrl+Alt+F1 - Ctrl+Alt+F6 to get a login prompt. For terminal #7 (Ctrl+Alt+F7) there is no tty started because it's meant for the x server.\nEdit:\nIf you want to end of in a shell, then create a file called /etc/init/tty7.conf with content:\n# tty7 - getty\n#\n# This service maintains a getty on tty7 from the point the system is\n# started until it is shut down again.\n\nstart on runlevel [23] and not-container\n\nstop on runlevel [!23]\n\nrespawn\nexec /sbin/getty -8 38400 tty7\n\nAfter creating this file reboot the system, and then when you perform sudo service lightdm stop you will end up in a login shell.\n\nA: That solution brings your \"GUI\" back because you have the lightdm service running. Run sudo stop lightdm. That command will stop your lightdm service, kill X server and bring the console.\nOnce in the console, if you want to start your X11 session again, run sudo start lightdm.\n", "Q: VirtualBox 4.3 Guest Additions on OSX guest Im running virtual box 4.3 on ubuntu 13.10, everything goes fine with windows guests but for Mac osx (Mountain Lyon) I just cant find how to install Guest additions.

How can I use both two finger scrolling and edge scrolling in Ubuntu 13.10 permanently  so that the setting won't reset even after I restart, shutdown or suspend my laptop?\n\nA: According with this answer, you can enable both two finger scrolling and edge scrolling using the following commands in terminal:\nsynclient VertEdgeScroll=1\nsynclient VertTwoFingerScroll=1\n\nThe problem is that these commands are not persistent after a system restart. To prevent this, let's put them to run at start up.\nFirst, make a new small bash script called scrolling with the following code inside:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsynclient VertEdgeScroll=1\nsynclient VertTwoFingerScroll=1\n\nSave it in your ~/bin directory, and don't forget to make it executable using the following command in terminal:\nchmod +x ~/bin/scrolling\n\nSecond, search for Startup Applications in Dash, and open it:\n\nThen add the script scrolling to run at startup:\n\n", "Q: Data doesn't get transferred correctly to USB, why?

I have tried to format the USB several times and send the data again, but it doesn't do anything, and sometimes it transfer the data perfect. So I don't know what exactly I should do? \nNote: I have tried many USB's \n\nA: It sounds like (given your description of fast transfers) that it's copying through a buffer but that hasn't been flushed to disk before you unplug it. This is fairly common.\nYou can force all your system disks to sync with their buffers by running sync. This is a blocking command so you won't be able to type while it's working.\n\"Safely Eject Device\" (or however that's worded) should be running a sync (that's what it means) but if you are using that, it sounds like that isn't working and you should report a bug.\n\nA: open your terminal and type as \nrsync -avviu /source/path /destination/path/of usb\n\nat the end of transmission it will display the errors if any.\n\nA: Run the below command to copy the files via terminal\ncp -Ri /path/to/source/folder1 /path/to/destination/folder2/\n\nfolder1 - folder consists of files which you are going to copy\nfolder2 - destination folder in which you are going to paste folder1\n", "Q: With which command in \"Terminal\" can I connect to internet?

But this time nothing seemed to work and I'm helpless.\nAs far as I have understood the problem of 'No boot loader is installed in the MBR of /dev/sda' is because it's somehow hidden by windows, so I need to make it visible for boot-repair?\nAnd this I don't know 'Syslinux MBR (4.04 and higher) is installed in the MBR of /dev/sdb'...\nI'm quite lost. Help appreciated here, thank you!\n\nA: First, the lack of GRUB in the MBR of the hard disk is not a problem, because you're booting in EFI mode, which doesn't use the MBR to store the boot loader. Instead, under EFI boot loaders are stored in the EFI System Partition (ESP), which is a FAT32 partition on which boot loaders are stored as files.\nThat said, your ESP is /dev/sda2, and according to your Boot Repair output, there's no sign of GRUB on that partition. My suspicion is that this problem results from the Windows Fast Startup feature, which turns shutdowns into suspend-to-disk operations. The result is that filesystems are not properly unmounted, and when they're accessed outside of Windows, filesystem damage can result. Thus, your first task is to disable Fast Startup, as described here (among many other places).\nIt's conceivable that disabling Fast Startup will fix your problem. If not, you'll need to re-install GRUB or install another boot loader in its place. You can try Boot Repair again for this, but if it fails, I recommend you try the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager. Given your configuration, booting from a rEFInd boot disk should enable you to boot either Windows or Linux. If this works, you can install the Debian-package version in Linux and it should take over from GRUB as your boot manager. If Boot Repair can't write to your ESP, though, it's quite possible that the rEFInd installer won't be able to, either. In this case, you could try following the instructions to install it from Windows -- but be sure to install the ext4fs driver, too. Alternatively, you could shrink a partition by about 550MiB and create a second ESP, unmount the original ESP, mount the new one at /boot/efi, and re-run Boot Repair or try re-installing rEFInd.\n\nA: I had the same problem after certain Windows updates: Ubuntu was still installed, but I couldn't boot into it.\nAnd when using Boot-Repair from within a Ubuntu Live USB (2nd option explained in the Boot-Repair wiki), I also got the error message \"Locked-ESP detected\").\nThe problem seemed to be that all my partitions were mounted by the Ubuntu Live USB. After starting gParted and unmounting them one by one (right-click -> unmount), Boot-Repair succeeded in repairing my system (using Recommended Repair).\nSee also this article.\n", "Q: Problem while upgrading from 13.04 to 13.10 version Hello i was trying to update my ubuntu version then i get this problem.\nAn unresolvable problem occurred while calculating the upgrade.\nThis can be caused by:\n * Upgrading to a pre-release version of Ubuntu\n * Running the current pre-release version of Ubuntu\n * Unofficial software packages not provided by Ubuntu\nCan somebody help me?\nThank You.\n\nA: As i am also one of the unfortunates to have constant upgrade problems in the previous years, i really warmly recommend doing a clean install from a USB stick or a CD.

As of right now, there's no .inputrc in the /home/user directory. \nThanks for any help you can give!\n\nA: Try this:\nsed -i -e 's/\\r$//' ~/.bashrc\n\nThis will remove Windows-style line endings (CR characters - \\r). Now, if you source ~/.bashrc you shouldn't get any error.\nNext, before to copy any content from other file, run the same command for that file:\nsed -i -e 's/\\r$//' /path/to/file_from_where_you_copy\n\n\nA: The error:\n\n$'\\r': command not found\n\nmeans that your file (.bashrc) somehow consist Windows line endings (CRLF) and bash doesn't recognise them, so it's failing. Maybe you edited that file in Windows?\nSo you've to convert your affected file back to use Unix-style line endings from CRLF into LF.\nThis can be achieved by: dos2unix command, e.g.\ndos2unix ~/.bashrc\n\nIf you don't have it, install via apt-get install tofrodos.\nOtherwise if you've Vim installed, try:\nex +'%!tr -d \"\\r\"' -scwq ~/.bashrc\n\nfor multiple files:\nex +'bufdo!%!tr -d \\r' -scxa ~/.bash*\n\nNote: The :bufdo command is not POSIX.\n\nIf you're using Vagrantfile by any chance and this happens as part of the provisioning script, you can set binary to true for your shell, e.g.\n# Shell provisioner, see: https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/provisioning/shell.html\nconfig.vm.provision \"shell\" do |s|\n  s.binary = true # Replace Windows line endings with Unix line endings.\n  s.path = \"script.sh\"\nend\n\n\nA: The file seems pretty messy.

Could the server be infected? How can we find out? The servers have postfix installed on them. The only open ports on these machines are smtp and pop3.\n\nA: UDP is used for a variety of services.   If you only have SMTP and POP3 open, you should have no UDP traffic.   I assume you also have DNS open on both TCP and UDP.   Massive amounts of traffic is a rather imprecise measurement.  Is it 1% of your traffic or bandwidth, or 90%.  \nIf you allow incoming email, I would assume you are also running some sort of mail scanning software.  This should generate a fair number of DNS lookups.  For this reason, it is recommend that you run a caching DNS server on the host.  UDP is also used by some other resources used to identify spam.  \nThe command sudo netstat -anp | grep udp | grep less will list connections using UDP and the associated program.  This may help identify the source of the traffic.  Repeating the command as sudo netstat -anp | grep udp | grep EST | less a few times could give you an idea if this is an ongoing connection.\nYou can use tcpdump to examine the traffic and determine what type of data is being passed.  This will give you an idea whether the traffic is legitmate.   \nAnother tool you could use is ntop which will summarize traffic by protocol and host.  It can give you and idea what traffic is passing. \nYou can insert a blocking rule in the iptables.   This can block traffic by IP address, protocol, or protocol and port.  Be prepared to remove the rule quickly in case the traffic is legitimate.  \n", "Q: 'sensors' command from lm-sensors keeps reporting the same temperature I've got a small cluster running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on all of the nodes.  I recently set up ganglia to monitor the cluster, and it's working beautifully except for one issue.  I wanted to add a CPU temperature metric to the monitor, so I created a 'temps' function in /usr/local/bin/ that consists of the following line:\nsensors|grep temp$1|awk '{print $2}'|grep -o '[0-9.]\\+'\n\nI then added the following lines to my crontab to update the temperature every 2 minutes:\n*/2 * * * * /usr/bin/gmetric --name temp1 --value `/usr/local/bin/temps 1` --type int16 --units Celcius\n*/2 * * * * /usr/bin/gmetric --name temp2 --value `/usr/local/bin/temps 2` --type int16 --units Celcius\n\nAfter setting this up, I noticed that the temperature isn't ever changing.  It reports 27.8 for temp1 and 29.8 for temp2 all of the time.  This is what 'sensors' is reporting regardless of the load on the machine.

So here it is again, reformulated.\nOn the lxml site they suggest that it is possible to have both lxml2 and the newest version of lxml on ubuntu:\n\nUsing lxml with python-libxml2\nIf you want to use lxml together with the official libxml2 Python\n  bindings (maybe because one of your dependencies uses it), you must\n  build lxml statically. Otherwise, the two packages will interfere in\n  places where the libxml2 library requires global configuration, which\n  can have any kind of effect from disappearing functionality to crashes\n  in either of the two. To get a static build, either pass the\n  --static-deps option to the setup.py script, or run pip with the STATIC_DEPS or STATICBUILD environment variable set to true, i.e.\n  STATIC_DEPS=true pip install lxml The STATICBUILD environment variable\n  is handled equivalently to the STATIC_DEPS variable, but is used by\n  some other extension packages, too.\n\nI am generally confused about how pip packages and ubuntu packages get along, so I hesitate to run STATIC_DEPS=true pip install lxml. Will it damage/confuse my installed lxml2 package? \nThe suggestion on SO was to install the new lxml in a virtualenv. That looks like the best way to go, but the lxml site is suggesting that a dual installation will work also. \nIn general: what happens if I use pip (to get a newer install) for a package that is already installed by apt-get? \n\nA: Ubuntu makes extensive use of Python in it's distributions. For this reason, my policy is to leave the Ubuntu supplied versions strictly alone and only update them via the update manager or apt-get. In this way I avoid the risk of de-stabilizing some piece of Ubuntu code that is dependent on a particular python package/module version.\nI do all my development work in virtualenv workspaces and configure my command line and Eclipse to use the appropriate workspace for whatever application I am working on. Thus I do not interfere with Ubuntu and Ubuntu does not interfere with me.\nIt is quite likely that a dual installation of lxml will \"work\" but the installation is likely to be fragile. Why take the risk?\n", "Q: Video playback works only as root using a Nvidia card That is, video playback with anything: chrome (html 5), firefox (flash), vlc, totem, smplayer... whatever.

This is my first post here, and I'm pretty new to Ubuntu/Linux. I currently have no other OS except for Ubuntu 13.10. (I used to have Windows 7 until i got a new Tera-byte hard drive).\nMy current PC build, if any of this helps:\nCPU: Intel i5 quad-core\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650\nRAM: 8 GB\nHDD: 1 TB SATA 3\nMotherboard: MSi Z77 A-G41\nOS: Ubuntu 13.10\nSo I recently installed Ubuntu 13.10 and put Steam on it, and I'm seeing that my games run a lot slower than they did when I had Windows 7. I figured it was a graphics problem, so I checked System Settings → Details → Overview. It says in \"Graphics\" that I have \"Gallium 0.4 on NVE7\" (don't really know what that is). Does this mean that Ubuntu is not using my graphics card?\nIn System Settings → Software & Updates → Additional Drivers, it clearly shows like this:\n\nNVIDIA Corporation: GK107 [GeForce GTX 650]\n  -This device is using an alternative driver\n\n(And then it shows a list of drivers that I can switch back and forth to)\nSo this is a bit confusing. In Software and Updates, it clearly shows that I have my NVIDIA card installed, and that I have a driver selected for it. But in System Settings, it shows I have some Gallium 0.4 thing. \nI had done a bit of research, and ended up typing command:\nlspci|grep VGA\n\nin the Terminal. It showed this in response:\nVGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GK107 [GeForce GTX 650] (rev a1)\n\nThe Terminal seems to recognize my graphics card. \nWhat it looks like to me, is that I don't have the proper driver, and I might be using my CPU's integrated graphics. When I switch around which driver I am using in that list, it still does not see my card in System Settings. Some of the drivers in the list give me some sort of OpenGL error when I try to run a game.\nIt might just be that my games are running slow because the game developers have not optimized it for Ubuntu that well. However, that still doesn't take away from the fact that System Settings is not showing my NVIDIA card.\nTL;DR Version:\nHow do I know if my video card is being recognized/used? If my video card is not being used, what is the best way fix that?\nPlease make your answers easy to understand. I do not mind wordy responses, as long as I can follow what you're saying.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!

That way I can keep a copy of the most important files on a different hard-drive.\n\nA: You need rsync my friend; check out the man page and do some research for some more information.

By the way, you are looking for a backup solution, not just a sync client.\n\nA: If you want syncing folders on different computers (either in local network or over internet) to back up, you can use Bittorrent Sync (http://www.bittorrent.com/sync). It uses bittorrent protocol, which allows syncing rather big files quickly. To use it for back up you should install it on both (or more) computers, choose a folder to back up and share it to other (others) computers like read only.

What I would do is firstly, a backup and then  try to force a check of the disk on the next reboot. \nNotice that it's very important to do a backup of all the data you have in the partition if you suspect that this could be a disk corruption.\nTo force a filesystem check for the next reboot, first identify the device; from the directory, df ., would say something like this: \n(0)samsung-romano:~% df .\nFilesystem     1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda6      503315720 140840260 336901780  30% /home\n\nSo the device is /dev/sda6. Now force a check in the next reboot. There are various way to do it, what I use normally is to force a high mount count on the device, like \nsudo tune2fs -c 100 /dev/sda6 \nsudo tune2fs -C 100 /dev/sda6 \n\nThe first one says to check the filesystem on the device once every 100 mount, and the second one set the mount-count to 100, so next boot it will be checked. \nThe most probable thing is that the check will detect it and remove it/move to the lost+found directory in the root of the filesystem (in my case it would be /home/lost+found/). From there it is normally possible to remove it. \n\nA: I would suggest try moving it to some different location.\nmv /path/to/filename /var/tmp/newname\n\nif this works i think you are done, and can remove it from there. \nalso try doing a \nfile /path/to/filename\n\nthis should tell you what kind of file it is. if nothing works. try\ncp /dev/null /path/to/filename\nrm /path/to/filename\n\nthis will make the file with 0 bytes and then you can eaisly remove it.\nto check why removing this file is crashing your terminal.\nlsof /path/to/filename\n\nthis will list all the processes on the systems using this file. you can stop those processes and remove then try deleting the file again.\n", "Q: Firefox can't access to the internet, but everything else can I don't see why I can't access the internet when I run Firefox in Ubuntu 13.10. \nI was previously able to until I resolved an issue where the software updater gave me a repository download error.

How can I get Django 1.6 installed?\nsudo apt-get install python-django\n\n\nA: While you can install it manually (setup.py), I recommend using the Python package manager as it is easier to install, maintain and upgrade.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Pip, the Python package manager.\nsudo apt-get install python-pip\n\n\n*Optionally, but recommended, upgrade pip, using itself:\nsudo pip install -U pip\n\n\n*Install the latest stable version of Django:\nsudo pip install Django\n\nThis installs 1.6.2 at the time of writing(check here the latest pypi version). \nTo install a specific version, add a requirement specifier like this:\nsudo pip install Django==1.6.2\n\nNote that APT, the Debian/Ubuntu package management will still report the older version installed and it is still installed as well. APT installs in dist-packages paths while Pip installs in the site-packages paths. The latter takes precedence, so that's locally installed packages will be chosen. See also: What's the difference between dist-packages and site-packages?\n\nA: First remove the previously installed django 1.3.1 version by deleting the django folder inside /usr/local/lib/pythonx.x/dist-packages(x.x denotes the version of python).Then follow the below steps,\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Django 1.6 from here.\n\n*Open the terminal and move to the directory where you placed the Django 1.6.\ncd path/to/driectory/which/contains/django1.6.tar.gz\n\n*Extract the django1.6.tar.gz by running the below command.\ntar -xzvf Django-1.6.tar.gz\n\n*Move to the Django-1.6 directory\ncd Django-1.6\n\n*Run the below command to install Django-1.6\nsudo python setup.py install\n", "Q: will ubuntu work on my ancient,pre-Pentium PowerMac G4 tower?

The gpt partitioning scheme can have 128 partitions inside and there are manual methods to get 145.\n\n\n*\n\n*Do not forget: Windows only boots from a primary partition.\n\n*See http://bootinfoscript.sourceforge.net/ To check your installation please follow the steps in the link and add the Results.txt to your question. This will show us how you installed your operating systems.\n\nEdit:\nWhat you have there is not going to work but it is MicroSoft that is the problem: they do not let you install 2 operating systems on the same disc. Linux does not have this as a restriction. Your results.txt shows this: \n\n\n*\n\n*sda1 = disc 1, partition 1. W7. \n\n*sda2 = disc 1, partition 2. XP.\n\n*sda3 = disc 1, partition 3. Linux.\n\n\nWindows can only be installed on a 'partition 1'. \nSo to use 2 windows in dual boot setting you need 2 hard discs (the 2nd being sda2 where you can use partition 1 for 1 of the 2 windows). \n\n\n*\n\n*You need to install Windows 7 after Windows XP. Windows XP does not support booting Windows 7.\n\n\n\nPossible workaround: install Windows XP in virtualBox from within Ubuntu. So you get 2 operating systems and after you started Ubuntu you can start XP (and use both at the same time).\n", "Q: quad boot, Windows 7,8, Ubuntu, Kali Linux, Partitioning scheme questions, which boot manager?,please help, lots of questions! thnx Dear Ubuntu Community,\nI have a question about how to partition my SSD in the new ultrabook i received. Please help me out so i can get started as soon as possible. (sorry for bad English).\nMy situation right now;\nWin8.1 UEFI boot,\nKali Linux only bootable when I change settings in bios to legacy.\n256gb splitted in a few recovery partitions, boot partition, win8, swap and kali Linux (ext4) partitionn. a\nMy plan is to install 4 operating systems; Win7, Win8.1, Ubuntu, and Kali Linux(debian).\nI want to be able to start up any one of the operating systems with one bootloader, either grub or maybe some alternative bootloader (rEFInd bootloader? someone told me thats good for this kind of situations)\nMy strategy is to first format the SSD and start from scratch. I will set my bios to \"legacy first\" since there is no legacy only option. After that I I will first install Win7, after that Win 8.1 (Will it install as non-uefi when I have bios set to legacy first? I hope so..) When win8.1 is installed, i will install either Kali Linux firs(debian) or Ubuntu first, and after that I will install the other one, so I will end up with; Win7 Win8, Kali and 8.1.\nMy questions; what kind of partition scheme do you guys recommend? (I mean about the primary/extended/active kind of thing. I dont really know what all these terms mean, and I want to do everything right the first time around. I think I will use gparted to set up my partitioning. The partition sizes are as follow; \nWin7: 40gb NTFS\nWin8: 60gb NTFS\nKali: Linux: 25gbext4?\nUbuntu: 25gb ext4?\nDATA partition: 100gb. This partition will be used by Win7 and Win8, so i guess it will be NTFS, right? I can store data from my Linux partitions as well to this disk, correct? Or is it not advised to store Linux data to a drive used by windows?\nare there any extra partitions that I am missing? Boot partition, for windows maybe? what about swap, I got 8gb of ram, and will not use hibernation, so is it recommended? or not really necessary? \nWhat would you guys recommend me to do? How should i let Gparted partition my ssd before installing everything? please be as detailed as possible. Is the order I will install my OS's in correct?\nWill the uefi windows 8.1 thing be any problem? remember; I have brand new laptop, with uefi enabled, and only \"legacy first boot\" option, in bios, and I want to be able to load all 4 OS's from one bootloader, without going into BIOS.\n(I have 8gb ram, so I dont know if I really need a swap partition?\nWell, I think these are all questions I can think of right now, I hope your answers will be enough to start as soon as possible. I have already made a backup of the laptop as is, so now its just waiting for your information before I can go on!\nThank you for participating in this great community. it has learned me allot already!\nThanks!!\n\n\n*\n\n*Bent\n\n\nA: Ok man, sorry for bad English, but at first quad boot with windows OS is not possible why? because windows 7 and 8 make/build an extra primary partition called RECOVERY. Do not forget that SSD does not support more than 4 lprimary partitions, so with Windows 8 and Windows 7 the four primary partition are already made. Second, windows 8 uses GPT instead of MBR disk format(i do not if this is correctly write/wrote) so you have to delete all GPT partition on your disk. Third, disable UEFI and Secure Boot from your BIOS. So, you can format your disk and delete windows 8 and GPT partitions, install Windows 7 or 8, then make two additional partition, and here be careful because you must install first windows and then kali linux and the last has to be ubuntu or debian. \nSi hablas español, espero ayudar, No puedes hacer un booteo con cuatro sistemas operativos si uno de ellos es windows, por que windows 7 y 8 utilizan una particion extra, una particion primaria para recuperar el boot si algo le pasa, y como sabes los discos duros hasta donde se, tambien los ssd, no soportan mas de 4 particiones primarias, esto limita tus opciones a tener tres sistemas operativos, claro si uno es windows y los otros son linux. si te animas igual debes formatear tu disco, borrar las particiones GPT(esto es importante) e instalar primero windows ya sea seven o windows 8 y luego kali linux y de ultimo debian, asi tendras menos errores de booteo.\n\nA: First, managing that many OSes in a multi-boot configuration can be a real pain. I strongly recommend you consider using virtual machines (via VirtualBox, VMware, or whatever) instead. If you need direct hardware access in multiple OSes, consider setting up just one of each type for dual-booting and then use virtual machines for the rest.\nSecond, if you must install that many OSes, I recommend using EFI-mode booting for all of them. The reason is threefold:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switching between BIOS-mode and EFI-mode booting is awkward on most computers, and impossible on a few. Thus, using just one mode (BIOS or EFI) is highly desirable.\n\n*EFI-mode booting will enable you to use the GUID Partition Table (GPT), which lacks the distinction between primary, extended, and logical partitions. This will simplify setting up and managing your partitions. (Note that you can boot Linux in BIOS mode from a GPT disk, but Windows requires EFI mode to boot from a GPT disk.)\n\n*EFI enables easier coexistence of multiple boot loaders. This feature can be very helpful in situations like yours, although it won't really do much good unless you understand the EFI boot process. See my page on EFI boot loaders for Linux for some background. (The \"EFI Boot Principles\" sub-page will be particularly helpful.)\n\n\nOTOH, there's a lot more documentation and online know-how for BIOS-mode multi-booting than for EFI-mode multi-booting. There are also EFI bugs and quirks that can complicate the matter under EFI. Still, EFI's advantages outweigh its drawbacks, IMHO, unless you happen to have a particularly buggy EFI.\nBeyond that, this page of mine provides tips for installing Linux on EFI-based systems. This Ubuntu-specific page may also be helpful. I don't have any URLs handy for Windows 7/8.1 dual-boot tips, but there are probably sites out there that describe this sort of thing. (Windows 7 and 8.1 will probably want to share a single entry in whatever top-level boot manager you use, though.)\n", "Q: Keep track of password in Ubuntu Is there a keychain-like program included with Ubuntu? Or is there something I can sudo apt-get ? I really liked dashlane on osx. What's the best software available that can keep track of passwords for websites, and also hold important information regarding logins? ssh addresses, things like that?\n\nA: See dash, password and keys.\n\nThe program is called seahorse and is already installed and active on your system. \nSeahorse - Encryption Made Easy\nSeahorse is a GNOME application for managing encryption keys. \nIt also integrates with nautilus, gedit and other places for encryption operations. \n\nWith seahorse you can...\nCreate and manage PGP keys\nCreate and manage SSH keys\nPublish and retrieve keys from key servers\nCache your passphrase so you don't have to keep typing it\nBackup your keys and keyring\nmore...\n\nPress the super key to go to dash and start typing password and it will be the 1st result.\n\nA: I would recommend 'Revelation', which is available from the Softwarecenter. A very usefull program, very good integration in gnome. Archive will be encrypted. Information is stored in folders, entries can be defined as Website, Email, etc.\n"]
