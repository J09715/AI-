["Q: Keyboard layout issues using Ubuntu 12.04 in ssh via X11 for mac I just upgraded from 10.04 LTS to 12.04 LTS on my server (DELL Intel XEON). By SSH login from my mac (OS X Lion) everything is fine (no issues with command lines) but when I open a window through X11, the keyboard layout is now completely messed up. As an owner of a french mac keyboard, I got used to such issues and could deal by guessing the \"QUERTY\" keys, but this time it's worse.\nTo fix it, I tried:\n1/\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration\n\n=> no effect\n2/\nsudo gnome-control-center\n\nthen change the keyboard settings, however adding a couple of keyboard layouts did not change anything.\nI feel there is something to do with the X11 forwarding.\nAny hints?\nThanks\n\nA: In my case, running Yosemite and the latest version of xquartz, going through ssh -X to CentOS 6.5 in VMWare Fusion, I could not resolve that problem with switching layouts. US and Russian layouts, in my case. When I started, for example, gnome-terminal, I just couldn't switch to my RU language, using any key combinations. So, after half a day of experimenting (I am not really a Linux geek, just kinda \"half-of-a-power\" user), I found a solution. \nYour mac ~/.profile should look like this:\nexport LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8\nexport LC_ALL=ru_RU.UTF-8\n\nIf you use another language, change LC_ALL= for your language in your MacOs. \nThen you need to add the following line at the end of your ~/.bash_profile on your ssh-connected machine (in my case - CentOS 6.5)\nsetxkbmap -rules evdev -model pc104 -layout us,ru\n\nThis goes correctly, especially for the Russian language. But I am sure your OS must have another collection of  layouts. And, at the end - ensure, than you enabled \"Follow system keyboard layout\" in X11->Preferences->Input tab.\nAfter these manipulations, forwarded through ssh-X11, the GUI of your application will be able to switch layouts, using your usual MacOS shortcut. In my case, Command+Space. Don't forget to restart X11.\nMaybe this will help someone ;-)\nP.S.: in this example, I worked only with the Russian layout and keymap, so, again, change parameters for your own! \n\nA: I eventually fixed my problem, what I did exactly is:\n\n\n*\n\n*in X11 preferences, I checked the \"Follow system keyboard layout\" and \"Enable key equivalent under X11\" items ;\n\n*quit X11. Once X11 reopened, the keyboard layout was properly handled.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to use Ash window manager from Chrome OS?

The following ways are not working:\navconv -i MOVIE.mkv | grep SOMETHING - Which should show only the lines from the avconv that have SOMETHING in them.\navconv -i MOVIE.mkv pipe: | grep SOMETHING - Which should show only the lines from the avconv that have SOMETHING in them.\navconv -i MOVIE.mkv pipe:1 | grep SOMETHING - Which should show only the lines from the avconv that have SOMETHING in them.\nHow can I output the information from avconv to pipe?\nWhy is it not working?\nPiping something like this works, but not the -i information parameter: avconv -codecs | grep \"264\"\nTested on 12.04 and 12.10\n\nA: I am one of the developers of Format Junkie, so I kind of know how avconv works, and I assure you that it sends all the important data to stderr. So, you need to grep from stderr. Actually, you redirect all the stderr to stdout and then grep:\nFor example:\navconv -i 111.avi 2>&1 | grep Duration\n\ncorrectly outputs:\n  Duration: 00:01:05.02, start: 0.000000, bitrate: 2910 kb/s\n\nThe reason why the grep works only in some of avconv's output is that this specific output is being given to stdout, not to stderr, and so it is successfully piped to grep.\nNormally stderr is used so as to output error messages and stdout so as to output normal informative messages.\nIt is not bad that both stderr and stdout exist, because you can filter the output the way you want. For example, consider the following:\ncommand > log.txt 2> error_log.txt\n\nThis will output all the normal output (stdout) to log.txt and all errors (stderr) to error_log.txt\nI don't know why avconv specifically uses stderr to display its messages, though.\n", "Q: LLVM-3.1 libLLVMSupport.a undefined reference to `dladdr' I'm trying to compile using the llvm-3.1 package.\nI'm running 12.04 x64 (3.2.0-26 kernel) && 12.10 (3.5.0-4) x64  backported llvm-3.1 from quantal, then debian experimental.\nNext I tried 12.10 with the native ubuntu llvm-3.1 package; this failed as well.\n\nuser@system:/tmp/llvm-test# make  \ncompiling cpp yacc file: decaf-llvm.y  \noutput file: decaf-llvm  \nbison -b decaf-llvm -d decaf-llvm.y  \n/bin/mv -f decaf-llvm.tab.c decaf-llvm.tab.cc  \nflex -odecaf-llvm.lex.cc decaf-llvm.lex  \ng++ -o ./decaf-llvm decaf-llvm.tab.cc decaf-llvm.lex.cc decaf-stdlib.c `llvm-config --cppflags --ldflags --libs core jit native` -ly -ll  \n/usr/lib/llvm-3.1/lib/libLLVMSupport.a(Signals.o): In function `PrintStackTrace(void*)':\n(.text+0x6c): undefined reference to `dladdr'  \n/usr/lib/llvm-3.1/lib/libLLVMSupport.a(Signals.o): In function `PrintStackTrace(void*)':\n(.text+0x18f): undefined reference to `dladdr'  \ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status  \nmake: *** [decaf-llvm] Error 1  \n\nI know the code works as I've run it in centos fine using llvm-3.1-6.fc18(rpm) \nGoogle was a bit helpful with this:  \n\n\"On some systems, incluning Ubuntu 11.10, linking may fail with message \nthat libLLVMSupport.a in function PrintStackTrace(void*) has undefined \nreference to dladdr.\"\n\n\n\"Workaround is to compile LLVM with cmake specifying the following\n  variable:\n  -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=-ldl\"\n\nhttp://svn.dsource.org/projects/bindings/trunk/llvm-3.0/Readme\nI double checked y ldflags and everything seems ok.\n\nuser@system:/llvm-config --ldflags\n-L/usr/lib/llvm-3.1/lib  -lpthread -lffi -ldl -lm\n\nI'm unclear of what to do next; any suggestions?\n\nA: I asked (and answered) a similar question on Stack Overflow.

This has been working fine for years.  This weekend, I got two new 2Tb internal drives, and decided it was time to re-install Ubuntu from scratch to clear out all the old cruft.\nAbout once a day since the re-install, the backup script hangs hard, usually in the \"rm -rf\" I do before the rsync.  By the time I notice the problem, my load average is in the stratosphere and climbing fast (one time, it was over 150), but anything that doesn't touch the drive seems to be running fine.  One thing that I find suspicious is that something, I don't know what, is doing a \"smartctl\" and a \"hdparm\" command on the USB drive.  I'm pretty sure smartctl isn't supposed to run on external drives.  I can't figure out what's doing it, either.  Here's part of ps auwwfx when it's hung:\nroot      7310  0.0  0.0   4248   352 ?        D    20:15   0:00 /sbin/hdparm -C /dev/sdd\nroot      7808  0.0  0.0  17372  1632 ?

The actual command syntax would use an integer in place of (uint id).\nPerhaps a better question to ask first might be \"How is a notification's DBus address found?\".\nNeither of these identify it correctly:\ngdbus monitor --session --dest org.freedesktop.Notifications\n\nreturns\nThe name org.freedesktop.Notifications is owned by :1.130\n...\n\nor  \ndbus-monitor \"interface='org.freedesktop.Notifications'\"\n\nreturns  \n... string \":1.340\" ...\n\nIn hindsight, the previous question \"How is the (uint id) for a notification found?\"is rhe torical given this previous answer to another question:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/186311/89468\nprovides details so either method below can be used:\ngdbus call --session --dest org.freedesktop.DBus                                   \\\n             --object-path /                                                       \\\n                   --method org.freedesktop.DBus.GetConnectionUnixProcessID :1.16\n\nreturning:\n(uint32 8957,)\n\nor \nqdbus --literal --session  org.freedesktop.DBus                                  \\\n                          /                                                      \\\n                           org.freedesktop.DBus.GetConnectionUnixProcessID :1.16\n\nreturning:\n8957\n\nThe pop-up notify-OSD graffit would be then defeated with:\n  qdbus    org.freedesktop.Notifications                             \\\n          /org/freedesktop/Notifications                             \\\n           org.freedesktop.Notifications.CloseNotification           \\\n  $(qdbus --literal --session                                        \\\n           org.freedesktop.DBus                                      \\\n          /                                                          \\\n           org.freedesktop.DBus.GetConnectionUnixProcessID :?.???  )\n\nThe \"trick\" is to find the :?.??? DBus address.\n\nA: How do you know what (UINT32 id) is or is not?\nGiven the statement You ... need a way to get that ID ... in this answer and the following empirical observations perhaps the title of the question should be changed to \"How can gdbus ... -m org.freedesktop.Notifications.CloseNotification ... close a notification?\"\nIs it by implication or process of elimination that the statement \"... it only states that the ID is to be unique, non-zero, and less than MAXINT ...\", found in the description of 9.1.2. org.freedesktop.Notifications.Notify, also applies to the CloseNotification parameter (UINT32 id)? The UINT32 by process of elimination is the only common factor as an attribute type in the documentation and there is the  implication that there must be some sort of common ID \"handle\" but ...\nThe details of the returned value of Notify and its parameter UINT32 replaces_id are quite explicit but it is not clear that CloseNotification's (UINT32 id) has anything to do with that as demonstrated with empirical testing below.\nQuoting 9.1.3. org.freedesktop.Notifications.CloseNotification in toto:\n9.1.3. org.freedesktop.Notifications.CloseNotification\n\nvoid org.freedesktop.Notifications.CloseNotification (UINT32 id);\n\nCauses a notification to be forcefully closed and removed from the user's view.\nIt can be used, for example, in the event that what the notification pertains to\nis no longer relevant, or to cancel a notification with no expiration time.\n\nThe NotificationClosed signal is emitted by this method.\n\nIf the notification no longer exists, an empty D-BUS Error message is sent back.\n\nThis does not characterize or explain the meaning of (UINT32 id).\nA glaring omission is the lack of a table to describe the NotificationClosed (UINT32 id) parameter.  All the other parameters for methods and signals are qualified with such tables.\nEmpirical tests show notifications do not close using Notify's return value: \n qdbus  org.freedesktop.Notifications                           \\\n       /org/freedesktop/Notifications                           \\\n        org.freedesktop.Notifications.CloseNotification         \\\n$(gdbus call --session                                          \\\n     -d org.freedesktop.Notifications                           \\\n    -o /org/freedesktop/Notifications                           \\\n     -m org.freedesktop.Notifications.Notify                    \\\n                     \"\" 0 \"\" \"sigma-ry\" \"corpus\" [] {} 200      \\\n | sed -e 's/(uint32\\(.*\\),)/\\1/g'                            )\n\nor\n qdbus  org.freedesktop.Notifications                           \\\n       /org/freedesktop/Notifications                           \\\n        org.freedesktop.Notifications.CloseNotification         \\\n$(gdbus call --session                                          \\\n    -d  org.freedesktop.Notifications                           \\\n    -o /org/freedesktop/Notifications                           \\\n    -m  org.freedesktop.Notifications.Notify                    \\\n                     \"\" 5 \"\" \"sigma-ry\" \"corpus\" [] {}  20      \\\n | sed -e 's/(uint32\\(.*\\),)/\\1/g'                            )\n\nThe notification does not close which would be the case if (UINT32 id) identified with the returned value of Notify.\nSome more tests:\n gdbus call --session                                           \\\n    -d  org.freedesktop.Notifications                           \\\n    -o /org/freedesktop/Notifications                           \\\n    -m  org.freedesktop.Notifications.CloseNotification         \\\n$(gdbus call --session                                          \\\n    -d  org.freedesktop.Notifications                           \\\n    -o /org/freedesktop/Notifications                           \\\n    -m  org.freedesktop.Notifications.Notify                    \\\n                     \"\" 0 \"\" \"sigma-ry\" \"corpus\" [] {}     0    \\\n | sed -e 's/(uint32\\(.*\\),)/\\1/g'                            )\n\nand even coercing a constant ID, by setting UINT32 replaces_id to 42 and expire_timeout to 0, it is seen that CloseNotification has no influence \n gdbus call --session                                           \\\n    -d  org.freedesktop.Notifications                           \\\n    -o /org/freedesktop/Notifications                           \\\n    -m  org.freedesktop.Notifications.CloseNotification         \\\n$(gdbus call --session                                          \\\n    -d  org.freedesktop.Notifications                           \\\n    -o /org/freedesktop/Notifications                           \\\n    -m  org.freedesktop.Notifications.Notify                    \\\n                     \"\" 42 \"\" \"sigma-ry\" \"corpus\" [] {}    0    \\\n | sed -e 's/(uint32\\(.*\\),)/\\1/g'                            )\n\nThe notification does not close even though the 42 makes the round trip throughout the methods as confirmed by\ndbus-monitor \"interface='org.freedesktop.Notifications'\"\n\nin the output\n\nmethod call sender=:1.332 -> dest=org.freedesktop.Notifications serial=3 path=/org/freedesktop/Notifications; interface=org.freedesktop.Notifications; member=Notify\n   string \"\"\n   uint32 42\n   string \"\"\n   string \"sigma-ry\"\n   string \"corpus\"\n   array [\n   ]\n   array [\n   ]\n   int32 0\nmethod call sender=:1.333 -> dest=org.freedesktop.Notifications serial=3 path=/org/freedesktop/Notifications; interface=org.freedesktop.Notifications; member=CloseNotification\n   uint32 42\n\nAlso note the notification failure of a -1 timeout (documentation is contradictory):\n  gdbus call --session                                          \\\n    -d  org.freedesktop.Notifications                           \\\n    -o /org/freedesktop/Notifications                           \\\n    -m  org.freedesktop.Notifications.Notify                    \\\n                     \"\" 42 \"\" \"sigma-ry\" \"corpus\" [] {}   -1\n\nthough this \"works\"\nnotify-send \"test\" -t -1\n\nref:\nWhat is the name of the program that displays the notifications?

I use PlayOnLinux, because it makes using WINE so much easier. If you don't have PlayOnLinux, install it from the Ubuntu Software Centre (if you want the latest version, go to the PlayOnLinux download page, click on \"Ubuntu\", and follow the instructions).\n\n\n*\n\n*Open PlayOnLinux.

It will prompt you to install updates; clear this check-box and press Next.\n\n\n*Wait a bit longer.\n\n*When prompted, select \"Restart now (recommended)\". This will not restart your computer; instead, PlayOnLinux will simulate a Windows restart.\n\n\nNow, you will have an Internet Explorer icon on your desktop and another within the PlayOnLinux window. You can double-click either of these to start IE8.\nNote that the display will not precisely match that on Windows for several reasons, but at least it will give you IE8 on Ubuntu!\n\nA: As of today (Sep 30, 2010 and Wine 1.3.3), IE 8 does not work in Wine.  It will install and load, but it won't connect or render a page and the window will have a lot of visible glitches.\nIf it ever does work in the future, you will need to use the Wine1.3 packages from the Wine PPA.\nTo Install it, the simplest method is to use winetricks.

Why is that? Where can I find documentation for all gvfs commands?\n\nA: As you may have noticed, these man pages were made by Sun for for Solaris, so Ubuntu cannot simply copy them due to copyright restrictions. The solution is for upstream (in this case, Gnome) to create the man pages themselves.\nAnd, as already pointed out in the comments, this was requested via bug reports in both Ubuntu and Debian circa 2008. There were also many bugs filed directly upstream about this issue.\nI personally filed a request to Gnome in 2011, and attached the *.1.gz man pages files from Solaris as a suggestion. They were not directly used (for technical reasons), but a few months later they created and included the man pages for all gvfs commands.\nThe upstream git commit including the man pages is quite recent, from June/2012 (and a few more included and then polished in August/2012), thus after Ubuntu 12.04 Precise was released.\nThen, both Ubuntu and Debian must wait for a new upstream version to be released after. That only happened in 2012-07-16 in gvfs 1.13.3 and 2012-08-12 in gvfs 1.13.5.\nBut gvfs in Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal is currently at 1.13.7, so the man pages are there in gvfs-common package\nSee, the system works ;-)\n", "Q: Ubuntu only working with second monitor I'm using the try ubuntu selection from my ubuntu cd.

However sometimes the live version may not have all the drivers required (for example: for the special keys)\n", "Q: Minimize window with Docky conflicts with Unity I'm seeing this unwanted behaviour eversince Unity came to Ubuntu. The Unity's Launcher randomly \"steals\" the endpoint for the minimizing animations from Docky. In other words, when I click on an icon in Docky to minimize a window, that window minimizes to Unity instead of Docky. That happens most of the time to all of the windows, although sometimes, also randomly, it happens that the windows minimize to Docky, but very rarely.\nHere's how it looks when I minimize a window:\n\nHere's how both animations should look: \n\n\nA: I tried looking up this problem in other forums but none helped. So I came up with my own alternative method. \n1) Change Unity Launcher's position to bottom\nThat can be done by running the following command in terminal\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Launcher launcher-position Bottom\n\n2) Make sure auto-hide is enabled for the unity launcher and set its sensitivity to the lowest\n(http://i.imgur.com/snzNQrA.png) \n3)Press super key and add random apps to the unity launcher until it line ups with the docky placement.\n(http://i.imgur.com/QbJc7Fu.png)\nAnd now it should work :) \nNote: If you open an app that you used as a random app in step 3, it may not minimize perfectly to docky \n\nA: I am having the same or a related problem trying to minimize windows only to docky.  I think I've found a solution. If you go to docky's settings and set the configuration to none then the window minimizing will only go to your dock. I am still playing with it to see if it will continue do this.\n\nA: Checking the animation settings in compizConfig might help.\n\nA: http://www.hackourlife.com/awn-vs-cairo-dock-vs-docky-mac-style-linux-docks-reviewed/\nhave you tried one of the alternatives? (ie. awn? / cairo?)\n*(i used to use awn and can speak for its ease on the old 10.10 environment, but haven't attempted since the changes went in to x in 11.04< ... but i'm it's still; stable at least.)\nwhile i know this isn't a direct fix to your problems, it may be a good temporary alternative. :D\n\nA: Well, the best thing you can do is to disable the Unity plugin using CCSM. This will remove the Unity launcher, but the upper panel would disappear too. Then, install gnome-panel:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-panel\n\nAnd add it to start-up applications. Log out andd then log back in. \nThat should solve your problem.\n\nA: What I noticed (in case someone is still wondering), when the app you are minimizing is already docked to unity launcher it no longer minimizes to the launcher but instead to the dock, so to fix it I docked every single program i ever opened to launcher to avoid it being minimized to the wrong place. Seems to stop working when you move the window of the application you launched, unity seems to take over control of the app again and minimizes to the wrong place again, so unless someone knows how to fix that then this only works partially, sorry\n", "Q: WIFI problem - it says firmware missing - Ubuntu version 12.04 desktop \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I get a Broadcom BCM43XX working? \n\nThe following is  the output of lspci from a terminal:\n00:00.0 Host bridge: NVIDIA Corporation MCP79 Host Bridge (rev b1)\n00:00.1 RAM memory: NVIDIA Corporation MCP79 Memory Controller (rev b1)\n00:03.0 ISA bridge: NVIDIA Corporation MCP79 LPC Bridge (rev b2)\n00:03.1 RAM memory: NVIDIA Corporation MCP79 Memory Controller (rev b1)\n00:03.2 SMBus: NVIDIA Corporation MCP79 SMBus (rev b1)\n00:03.3 RAM memory: NVIDIA Corporation MCP79 Memory Controller (rev b1)\n00:03.5 Co-processor: NVIDIA Corporation MCP79 Co-processor (rev b1)\n00:04.0 USB controller: NVIDIA Corporation MCP79 OHCI USB 1.1 Controller (rev b1)\n00:04.1 USB controller: NVIDIA Corporation MCP79 EHCI USB 2.0 Controller (rev b1)\n00:06.0 USB controller: NVIDIA Corporation MCP79 OHCI USB 1.1 Controller (rev b1)\n00:06.1 USB controller: NVIDIA Corporation MCP79 EHCI USB 2.0 Controller (rev b1)\n00:08.0 Audio device: NVIDIA Corporation MCP79 High Definition Audio (rev b1)\n00:09.0 PCI bridge: NVIDIA Corporation MCP79 PCI Bridge (rev b1)\n00:0a.0 Ethernet controller: NVIDIA Corporation MCP79 Ethernet (rev b1)\n00:0b.0 SATA controller: NVIDIA Corporation MCP79 AHCI Controller (rev b1)\n00:0c.0 PCI bridge: NVIDIA Corporation MCP79 PCI Express Bridge (rev b1)\n00:0d.0 PCI bridge: NVIDIA Corporation MCP79 PCI Express Bridge (rev b1)\n00:10.0 PCI bridge: NVIDIA Corporation MCP79 PCI Express Bridge (rev b1)\n00:15.0 PCI bridge: NVIDIA Corporation MCP79 PCI Express Bridge (rev b1)\n00:16.0 PCI bridge: NVIDIA Corporation MCP79 PCI Express Bridge (rev b1)\n00:17.0 PCI bridge: NVIDIA Corporation MCP79 PCI Express Bridge (rev b1)\n00:18.0 PCI bridge: NVIDIA Corporation MCP79 PCI Express Bridge (rev b1)\n01:07.0 FireWire (IEEE 1394): Ricoh Co Ltd R5C832 IEEE 1394 Controller (rev 05)\n01:07.1 SD Host controller: Ricoh Co Ltd R5C822 SD/SDIO/MMC/MS/MSPro Host Adapter (rev 22)\n01:07.2 System peripheral: Ricoh Co Ltd R5C592 Memory Stick Bus Host Adapter (rev 12)\n01:07.3 System peripheral: Ricoh Co Ltd xD-Picture Card Controller (rev 12)\n04:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation C79 [GeForce 9400M G] (rev b1)\n07:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4322 802.11a/b/g/n Wireless LAN Controller (rev 01)\n\n\nA: The solution is quite simple.

It comes with a Win7 Home basic and a 32GB SSD + 500GB HDD. \nI started to install ubuntu and in doing so went and deleted all the partitions on my HDD and recreated them the way I wanted. \nThen when I tried to install ubuntu it didn't recognize my HDD. To solve this i typed dmraid -E -r /dev/sdX where the 'X' was my SSD drive. After this ubuntu can install but windows for some reason does not install. Also the Intel Caching feature is lost and SSD is just sitting and doing nothing. \nI want to know how to solve this problem. Ideeally I would like to use the SSD for caching, either in windows or ubuntu. \nHow do I get the SSD back to working as an Intel rapid cache?\nHow do I get windows to install properly? It tell me that windows is unable to configure itself to my hardware, and my PC came with windows pre-installed so this is not possible. \nSorry for the long question and thanks for your answers! \nPS:\nAt one time when I booted I pressed Ctrl+i and went to the intel rapid cache menu. I think i screwed up something in here, because only after this the rapid cache stopped working, and each time I booted the PC thought the BIOS was my primary disk. \n\nA: I did a \ndmraid -E -r /dev/sda\ndmraid -E -r /dev/sdb    <-- ssd\n\nThen installed Linux onto the SSD, and used the 500GB(SDA) for my /home folder. It's not a perfect solution (not using caching), but at least using the SSD to startup super fast etc.\nIt's a step in the right direction at least!\n\nA: This is what worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off acceleration in the Intel Rapid Storage Tech. It will take a while.\n\n*Click reset to available (it will show up once you disable acceleration) which should remove the fake raid thing and free your SSD.\n\n*Use some disk utility such EaseUs, to turn your HP Recovery and HP_Tools partitions to logical. Now, you should have atmost 3 primary partitions. If not, then make sure that you don't have more than 3 by changing to logical/removing unnecessary partitions that you may have created. Create some unallocated space from one/more of the partitions. ~10GB is good. DO NOT CHANGE BOOT PARTITION TO LOGICAL.\n\n*Restart and enter BIOS, turn off the Intel Rapid Start Tech.\n\n*Install using live USB by selecting \"Something Else\" in the unallocated space.\n\n*Now, you may turn on Intel Rapid Storage and Intel Rapid Start. The exact same config in the Intel Rapid Storage cannot be restored so what you could do is make 18.6GB cache volume and the rest data volume. From that data volume, you could turn 4GB into hibernation partition using command prompt and use the rest for storing any files that you access frequently. Use enhanced mode now instead of the maximized mode, just to be safe. If Linux and Windows both use SSD for cache and you use maximized mode then you'd most likely have trouble.\n\n\nApparently, there is no way to put back the same config of 4GB data(hibernation) volume and 26GB cache volume.\nAll this may seem to be out of the blue and look like as if I am talking about random stuff but if you have googled enough, you'd know what I am talking about.\n\nA: I have the same laptop and the same problem. Presently after a lot of Rnd, I was able to partition the HDD and then load Windows. Remember not to format the SSD which has the OEM,  that is essential for backup and any OS loading. \nThe problem is that the default BIOS in the system is not complete, actually what is hidden is the uefi. Check this link.\nSo as it stands I am searching the net for a solution. Actually I even contacted HP. They said they will get back. Nothing as yet.\n", "Q: How to start gkrellm so that it shows up on all virtual desktops? I'd like to open the GKrellM system monitor so that it is present on all virtual desktops.

I'm not sure whether you use Compiz, if yes, you can set the rules in Compiz using the compiz settings manager (ccsm).

And I would prefer a full desktop operating system like Ubuntu rather than iOS or Android.\nWhat tablets , if any might Ubuntu and Unity run on?\nOr would it only run with laptop/tablets?\n\nA: You are very unlikely to find a \"cheap\" tablet to run unity, this is due to graphics I would think.\nWhile modern tabs are quad core the processor lacks high frequency, to clarify my PC has a clock speed of 3.0gz per core but even an expensive tab will likely only have 1gz this means they can multi task but are not great a intensive prossesing and the graphics chips are just rubbish, my pc has 512 dedicated mb for graphics, laptops will be less (look up intel integrated graphics) and tabs would be lucky to have half what thew laptop has.\nThe result of this is that the CPU must help the GPU slowing down graphic rendering and taking resources from the OS.\nI think you could easily get Ubuntu on to one but not with Unity or KDE, you would need X or L Ubuntu.\nAlternatively check out Fuduntu it uses the old Gnome 2 desktop which is fast and customizable but designed for less powerful (older) PC.\nAnother option is Bhodi linux with the Enlightenment desktop (E17) which has a special set up for touch devices and is still Ubuntu underneath.\nEDIT : You will be able to get one next year though Ubuntu 13.04 will (apparently) get a mobile version read THIS and THIS\n\nA: The Asus Nexus 7 is officially supported by Canonical as a developer platform only at this time.\nIt is not recommended for general users.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Nexus7\n", "Q: Connection to server failed error There is a website of a browser game Tanki Online.

Is there any way for doing this without posiblitiy of exposing source code. \nI can't just send archive to Ubuntu Software Center because they don't know where to put each file. \nSo can you help me with this.\n\nA: Building a binary package results in a .deb file. This usually does not contain source code, as build artefacts are binary.\nExceptions to this is software written in Python, PHP, and other interpreted languages. Because it's interpreted, you can't build without restricting the end users to change the environment (e.g. Python version). And yes, there are workarounds for this, but this is not recommended. The Debian policy for Python for example is to compile it at installation time (Debian wiki: Python/Policy).\nFeel free to inspect the contents of your package after building. Also see examples of open source software binary packages.\nEdit - Using PPAs:\nWhen uploading a package to your PPA, it will be a source package and built by Launchpad cloud servers to a binary package. Both will be published. There's no way build your packages locally and publish your binary-only packages to a PPA.

I have installed Nemo (a fork of Nautilus created by the Linux Mint Team) in my Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS with Gnome Shell 3.4.2. I followed the instructions DefaultFileManager on help.ubuntu.com, changing the \"inode\" and \"x-directory\" in the file \"defaults.list\", to make Nemo my default file manager. \nNow everything works perfectly, except for one thing: opening folders from desktop.\nI have set the option \"Have file manager handle the desktop\" on. Cool. The problem is that the desktop seems to be handled by Nautilus only, even if I have set another file manager as default. Every time I double click a folder on the desktop, it is opened by Nautilus, not Nemo. \nDoes anybody know how to fix this?\n\nA: Taken from this page:\nOpen up Terminal, and run the following commands (one-by-one):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-nightly\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nemo nemo-fileroller\n\nNote the following:\n\nInstalling Nemo will also install latest Cinnamon (currently Cinnamon\n  1.6) into your Ubuntu installation, but it won't replace your default Ubuntu session; it just add a new entry in login session\n  list).

I've installed Nemo thusly, and then used the xdg-mime command, with very satisfactory results -- removable media are now automatically opened in Nemo not Nautilus, with Tree View (which is what I wanted).\nADDED: While tinkering with the system when something is not broken is probably not recommended, for the curious, here is additional information on the creation and structure of Unity launchers that are involved in application integration with the Unity desktop.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UnityLaunchersAndDesktopFiles\nProceed only with extreme caution. \n\nA: After installing Nemo from the Cinnamon-PPA + setting it as default file manager with:\nxdg-mime default nemo.desktop inode/directory application/x-gnome-saved-search\n\n..you still would like to disable nautilus handling the desktop and instead use nemo. \nTo disable natuilus, do \ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons false\n\nBut then I'm not sure how to make Nemo handle it instead. \n\nA: Found a solution here: \nhttp://www.fandigital.com/2013/01/set-nemo-default-file-manager-ubuntu.html\nThe following command once typed into a terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) makes nemo default\nxdg-mime default nemo.desktop inode/directory application/x-gnome-saved-search\n\nHow to install Nemo without Cinnamon is answered here: \nHow do I install Nemo file manager?\n\nA: Nemo is set to handle the desktop by default but Nautilus overrides that so Add Nemo to the mime defaults and disable Nautilus\nxdg-mime default nemo.desktop inode/directory application/x-gnome-saved-search\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons false\n\n\nA: Also if you have nautilus and nemo both running then saves from applications like Libreoffice will take a long time. solution is to make nemo the default file manager and purge nautilus. Unfortunately sometimes upgrades will re-install nautilus and make it the default manager, then you have the same slow save problem until you again purge one or the other.

The thing is that after this operation, the grub is not showing at boot, so the computer is loaded directly into windows. The partitions available on my hdd look something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*ubuntu partition -> mounted /\n\n*swap area partition\n\n*ubuntu boot partition -> mounted /boot\n\n*windows partiton\n\n*windows system reserved partition (was created automatically)\n\n\nWhat should I do in order to have grub showing at boot ? I searched for this kind of issues on the internet (including this website) and found that I could boot using a live cd and install a program called Boot-Repair and try using it to fix the problem. I'm thinking also of booting using the live cd and from a terminal to reinstall grub using another partition (the main /dev/sda I suppose). \nWhat do you think ? What is the proper solution for this situation ? Perhaps editing the grub config file would be another option (I don't know exactly how, but it could work) ?\nEDIT:\nSince an internet connection wasn't available so I could install the Boot-Repair, what I did was the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Booted using a live CD and went to a terminal\n\n*mounted the ubuntu install partition, the initial separated /boot partition and also the /sys, /proc, /run, /dev\n\n*chrooted into the ubuntu install \n\n*reinstalled the grub using /dev/sda as location\n\n*updated grub\n\n\nAt this point the grub update said it detected two linux images, one free dos and another windows system. I thought everything was fine, so I restarted the computer. But when the grub shows up, there are only two options to select from, the free dos and the windows. \nWhat did I do wrong ?\n\nA: Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from an Ubuntu Live CD and go to terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.\n\n*Install GRUB specifying the boot partition like this:\nsudo mount /dev/sdaN /mnt\nsudo grub-install –boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sda\nassuming /dev/sda is your primary drive and N is the /boot partition number.\nIf it does not work try the boot-repair method listed elsewhere.\nHope this helps\n\nA: I finally succeeded repairing the boot using the Boot-Repair utility.\n\nA: \nI'm thinking also of booting using the live cd and from a terminal to\n  reinstall grub using another partition (the main /dev/sda I suppose).\n\nI believe you have answered your own question. /dev/sda is the Master Boot Record of your drive. If at install you chose to install GRUB to the /boot partition (/dev/sda?), then the Windows bootloader is still remaining on the MBR. This is why it just boots straight through to Windows. Which ever bootloader is installed to the MBR is the one that your bios will launch. Once you have installed GRUB to /dev/sda and run sudo update-grub all your installed OSes should be added to the GRUB menu. Then just reboot and your GRUB menu should pop up automatically.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use Nautilus Actions with Nemo file manager? I have installed Nemo (initially a Nautilus fork) in Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS.\nI used to use Nautilus actions with Nautilus. Now that I have installed Nemo, I can't use them anymore.\nI was wondering if there is any way to use Nautilus actions and the Configuration tool with Nemo - as it is a fork of Nautilus.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Can Nautilus actions be used in Nemo? How?\n\n*Is the Nautilus actions tool (editor) usable for Nemo?\n\nA: Found this on the Arch wiki - \n\n.nemo_action files can be used to create menu entries in the pop-up dialog that comes up since these files are read by nemo whenever you right click. You can invoke a script from these .nemo_action files that does your job, similar to what nautilus-actions does.\nYou can have a look at /usr/share/nemo/actions/sample.nemo_action and /usr/share/nemo/actions/myaction.py to get an idea of how it works. These files have detailed information on what each field in the action files indicates.\nYou can visit this website for an example.\nEdit :\nNemo actions are similar to nautilus actions in content but vary with respect to the extension name.\nIn nautilus, newly created actions and menus will be stored on the disk as .desktop files.\nThe nautilus-actions tool, a graphical editor for nautilus actions, will therefore not work with nemo because it looks for .desktop files, not .nemo_action files.\nSummary -\nNautilus scripts can be used if invoked by .nemo_action files, just like nautilus action .desktop files did, and these in turn can be adapted for that purpose. nautilus-actions tool is NOT usable for Nemo due to the difference in paths and extension names.\n\nA: I use Nemo without Cinnamon on Ubuntu 14.04 using a PPA.\nNemo is much more configurable then Nautilus. Whether or not that is \"better\" then Nautilus is a matter of taste IMHO.  I prefer complex things over simple ones… :-)\nThat being said, defining your personal Nemo actions or nemo scripts is very straightforward: scripts can be copied verbatim in 90+% of cases and actions can be defined yourself easily (I made my own \"Add to VLC\" and \"Open with BackInTime\" in 5 minutes flat by using the provided example)  You can also find tons of user-designed actions around the web.\nThere are tons of extensions readily available, so the need to define your own actions is hardly needed…\n\nA: Summing up what I have learned from the main answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Nemo or Nautilus actions are similar in content  and purpose (namely, adding menu items) but vary with respect to the extension name. (In nautilus, newly created actions and menus will be stored on the disk as .desktop files, In nemo as nemo_action files.) They invoke certain commands including scripts (which are in this sense called nautilus or nemo scripts). Therefore, nautilus scripts can be used if invoked by nemo_action files, just like nautilus actions did, and these can be adapted for that purpose\n\n*The nautilus-actions tool, a graphical editor for nautilus actions, will therefore not work with nemo because it looks for .desktop files, not .nemo_action files.\n\n", "Q: Search through a certain manpage-section in all man pages I would like to search through subsection FILES in all man pages.\nI have tried man -K FILES:resolv.conf and man -K -S FILES  resolv.conf in no way\nHow can I do that?\n\nA: The -S option selects a section of the manual, the manual being the whole collection of man pages. The manual section can be 1 (Executables), 2 (System calls) etc. Not the section of a single man page as such. So for example \nman -K -S 3 resolv.conf\n\nwill return the man page for res_init(3), a C library call that belongs into the section 3, Library calls, but not the man page for dig(1), which belongs to section 1 (executables).\nSince this is a brute text search anyways, I would probably make an ad hoc search script using zcat and sed, or maybe a simple perl script.\nEDIT: here is an example script, created as bash function.\nfunction mfind { find /usr/share/man/ -iname '*.gz' -exec zcat {} \\; | perl -ne '/.SH NAME/ and $n=<STDIN>;/.SH '$2'/ and $c=1;$c and /'$1'/ and $n and print \"$n\" and $n=\"\"' ; }\n\nUsage:\nmfind expression mansection\n\nfor example\nmfind utmp FILES\n\nBugs: does not consider /etc/manpath.config, uses /usr/share/man instead.

I don't promise to get around to implementing it any time soon (I'm man-db upstream), but it's an interesting feature in Solaris that I was unaware of and it would have occasional uses.\n\nA: I wouldn't say no options. I've been trying to put together a consolidated file in  .txt or .pdf format of the complete man resource. The option I opted for was  \nman -a /bin/* > manList.txt\n\n(still experimenting with it for improvement, obviously). I'm far from an expert, so it has its kinks(some groups of text have sections of characters not displayable, I assume something involving the encoding around the page-breaks, not sure.) However, in reference to your question, it seems feasible that  \nman -a 5 /bin/* /sbin/* > {your_output_file}\n\nwould be at least a workable option until you can find something better. I tested it, same encoding issue, but the data is there for access, just needs some TLC. Then you could search at your leisure with a txt editor.

I have Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 as dual-boot and on the same 500GB HDD.\nI have partitioned the drive into NTFS file system from Windows before I installed\nEdubuntu 12.04 in the remaining free space.\nNow, there is a drive(G:) accessible through Windows and has few folders.\n\n\n*\n\n*I boot into Edubuntu and create a folder \"LinTor\" and download movies and few software\nfrom torrentz. Before I download, it showed 49GB free out of 62GB. After all the downloads\nit showed 31GB free out of 62GB. \n\n*Then I boot into Windows and I couldn't find this \"LinTor\" folder. I wondered that might be happening as I hibernate Edubuntu (using sudo pm-hibernate) and then boot into Windows. I then create another folder in the same drive(G:) with the name \"001\" to check if this was accessible from Edubuntu.\n\n*Now I reboot into Edubuntu to find that \"LinTor\" folder has disappeared and \"001\" folder wasn't showing up either. Surprisingly, the drive size still shows 31GB free out of 62GB but when I check it from Windows, it shows 49GB free of 62GB.\nThere is one thing I would like to mention. When I was trying to unmount the NTFS drive(G:) from Edubuntu before booting into Windows, it prompted me with this message:\n\nDo you want to empty the trash before you unmount the drive? Once the trash is emptied the data is permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.\n\nPlease help me understand what could be the problem and how do I recover the missing folder?\n\nA: Before you reformat the drive there is a lot you can do to recover your data or attempt a repair. One option is to install testdisk from a Terminal with\nsudo apt-get install testdisk\n\nWith no other disk attached (including USB media) run it by typing\nsudo testdisk\n\nFrom the first screen choose the option to create a new log. From the next screen you should see just one disk - press enter to proceed. On the next screen, press enter to select an Intel partition table type. Choose analyze on the next screen. You may be asked it you want Testdisk to check for Windows created partitions - select yes if so.\nAt the next screen you should see a list of partitions - how many depends on how you installed Linux. You can choose each one in turn by highlighting the appropriate one and pressing \"P\" to list the files and from there you will get the option to press \"C\" to copy files and or directories. They will go, by default, to the directory you were in when you started Testdisk. Make sure you have enough space before you start (run du -h in another Terminal tab if you can't remember).\nAt this point you will have a copy of your data without changing anything on your disk - Testdisk can read partitons which Windows cannot see and Linux hasn't got mounted. If you start running anything that attempts to repair the partition table (for example) you risk losing access to the data. A Format is your data's tombstone for sure.\n\nA: If you have a ntfs partition you use in dual boot from both Linux and Windows ALWAYS shut down the one system if you want to boot the other. If you don't do so the partition will not be properly unmounted. If you use hibernate, a system remembers it's state and the usage flags for the partition are being held (I have to admit I'm not that much into the technical details here, maybe someone else can provide a more technical correct answer). As a consequence the other system (Windows) cannot access that partition properly. Even if you reboot and wake the previous system (Ubuntu) from hibernate Windows might have tried to access the partition in the meantime, so it's state changed. If you shutdown when changing systems you'll prevent those errors in the future.\nI have no idea how to recover the lost files though.

This is the \"old style\" X clipboard.\n\nA: A completely different approach would be to use a temporary file, like\nterminalA> pwd > /tmp/somepwd\n\nterminalB> cp * `cat /tmp/somepwd`\n\n\nA: There are many situations where copying and pasting from the terminal is useful. However, in the situation you cited, I believe there's a better way.\nYour situation involves operating on some path which was printed in another terminal window. You can copy and paste, but what if there are spaces in the name? Also, copying and pasting involves you moving your hand from the keyboard to the mouse to select the text, which is inefficient.\nIn your example, you wanted to work with /home/hooked/foo. I'm assumming that /home/hooked is your home directory, which is the value of the environment variable $HOME. So, you could refer to $HOME/foo instead. But, in bash and a number of other places, ~ is a shortcut for $HOME. Thus, you could refer instead to ~/foo.\nThen, there's tab completion. Suppose you had the following directory structure:\n/\n|-> home\n    |-> hooked\n        |-> foo\n        |-> bar\n        |-> buzz\n\nWhen you want to refer to ~/foo, you can type this: ~/fTAB. The tab key does autocompletion. Play with it to learn how it works, and you'll stop typing things in full now. Thanks to tab completion, I freely use long filenames with spaces and other special characters--sometimes even characters not present on my keyboard--without any inconvenience, because I never have to actually type them or waste time copying and pasting.\nIf you learn to use these tools (along with relative diretory paths if you don't already know about them), I predict you'll no longer find a need to copy and paste for filesystem operations.\n", "Q: What factors should be considered when installing packages manually? I have seen many packages' readme or install files on instructing how to install a package manually. But many times the results are erroneous.\nThey instruct us to do many thing with for example the configure file.\nBut many, many factors are involved in this procedure (dependencies, make, path variables and much more).\nI am yet able to install a single package manually.\nWhat are the common factors that should be considered with manual installations?\n\nA: I am answering this question under my knowledge .\nyou have to install build-essential to compile any package manually .\n     sudo apt-get install build-essential \n\nThen you can configure your package with ./configure \n   Then make and sudo make install \n But one more thing you have to remember is that package dependencies . If you are installing a package means those will obtained automatically ,if not \nsudo apt-get install -f will do the job .\nIn the case of No internet connection , you have to collect all of them and thats a risky job , my opinion . \nSo if you want to install a package manually then you have to take care of the compilation tools nothing but build essential and dependencies of that package . \nThe above explanation applicable for any source packages . \nBut if you got builded packages directly i mean .DEB files then simply you can install them with \nsudo dpkg -i filename.deb\n\nand here also if dependencies issue may raise and you can take care of them with sudo apt-get install -f \nIf you got that package as a script(.sh) or binary file (.bin )  , the you can install with \nchmod +x filenmae.sh\n./filename.sh\n\nfor binary\nchmod +x filename.bin\n./filename.bin\n\n", "Q: Installing Java Automatically (With Silent Option) I'm trying to install Java through apt-get. \nI found this PPA of Java Installers, however, when I add the repository, update and then issue the apt-get install -y command, the installer for java takes over and it pops up a configuration option. \nI'm hoping to be able to install it without any intervention or pressing of keyboards since I am creating build and deploy scripts for my EC2 instances which will automatically install all of the tagged packages that it needs. \nIs there any other options? \n\nA: Silent install Java 6/7/8/9 using WebUpd8 team's PPA\nsudo apt-get install -y python-software-properties debconf-utils\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:webupd8team/java\nsudo apt-get update\necho \"oracle-java8-installer shared/accepted-oracle-license-v1-1 select true\" | sudo debconf-set-selections\nsudo apt-get install -y oracle-java8-installer\n\n@gertvdijk answer did not work with me on Ubuntu 14.04 & 14.10\n\nA: For a silent java install you can try open-jdk:\n\nsudo apt-get install -y openjdk-7-jdk\n\nAlso try this for more open-jdk packages/extensions...\n\nsudo apt-cache search openjdk\n\n\nA: If OpenJDK/OpenJRE works fine for you, I recommend using that package instead as suggested by @SAM. However, some software really requires Oracle's JDK/JRE. This answer is how to silence the license question with the Oracle package from the PPA.\nFirst, let's recognize the question asked is a feature of the package, created by the developer.\n\noracle-java7-installer (7u7-0~webupd8~4) maverick; urgency=medium\n\n  * removed cookie file use or else the PPA stays disabled\n  * request the user to accept the Oracle license before installation\n -- Alin Andrei <webupd8@gmail.com>   Tue, 04 Sep 2012 14:18:29 +0200\n\n\nAs @Nate indicated in his answer, there should be a silent option. And there is. Do this before installing it:\n$ echo debconf shared/accepted-oracle-license-v1-1 select true | \\\n  sudo debconf-set-selections\n$ echo debconf shared/accepted-oracle-license-v1-1 seen true | \\\n  sudo debconf-set-selections\n\nThis sets the value of the debconf key to true, but also marks it as seen by the user. Now this question should not appear!\nHow did I find this?\nIn the source of the package, I tracked this down in the oracle-java7-installer.preinst file:\n\nlicense=oracle-license-v1-1\n\n# snip\n\ndb_get shared/accepted-$license\nif [ \"$RET\" = \"true\" ]; then\n    echo \"$license license has already been accepted\" >&2\n    exit 0\nfi\n\n\nApparantly, it uses debconf's value for the key shared/accepted-oracle-license-v1-1 to check whether the user has already accepted the license. If it is, the script will exit gracefully and allow the installation to continue without asking you the question. We should now just tell debconf you already accept the Oracle Licence 1.1.\nPlease refer to the manpage of debconf-set-selections on more details, but this is the example for your issue and works similar for other packages. What other keys do you have on your system in debconf's database? Install debconf-utils and do\n$ sudo debconf-get-selections\n\nThen grep for more keys you need to set in your automated installation. This is way more flexible than using -y with apt-get as it gives you the opportunity to set other than default settings on installation times.\n\nA: Supporting @gertvdijk answer is the description in the original blog post about webupd8's PPA.\n\nUpdate 2: the installer now requires you accept the Oracle license\n  before the installation begins. This is only required once. If for\n  some reason you need the installation to be automated, you can run the\n  following command to automatically accept the Oracle license:\nsudo echo oracle-java7-installer shared/accepted-oracle-license-v1-1 select true | \\\nsudo /usr/bin/debconf-set-selections\n\n\n\nA: I verified the following sentence work for me using docker ubuntu16.04LTS.\nRUN apt-get install -y software-properties-common\nRUN add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java && apt-get update\n\nRUN echo \"oracle-java8-installer shared/accepted-oracle-license-v1-1 select true\" | debconf-set-selections\nRUN echo \"oracle-java8-installer shared/accepted-oracle-license-v1-1 seen true\" | debconf-set-selections\n\nRUN apt-get install -y oracle-java8-installer\n\n\nA: Oracle java is no longer in the Ubuntu repos. \nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/12/java-to-be-removed-from-ubuntu-uninstalled-from-user-machines\nHere is how to install the Java JDK.

Since you're using LVM, the output you posted in fstab, mount, etc look fine.\nAnd the best way to free space in /boot is to remove old kernel versions. If you're new to this, I suggest using Software Center:\n\n\n*\n\n*Search for \"linux-image\". Take a note on the most recent one (your current kernel), and delete all the previous ones. Only remove the ones with version numbers like linux-image-3.2.0-xx-server, do not delete the \"main\" linux-image-server or linux-image. Be sure to keep your current version number.\n\n*Do the same with \"linux-headers\"\nYou're good to go!\nAlso, as a side-note... you may reconsider administering an Ubuntu Server if you still need tutorials for managing disk space and kernel versions. Have you tried Ubuntu Desktop?\n\nA: It seems you have two issues.\n\n\n*\n\n*Your /boot partition is full - this happens if you update the kernel enough times and don't remove the old ones. It's always a good idea to keep at least one old kernel in case you find something that doesn't work with an updated one, but you don't need more than three. Do you boot with GRUB? How many kernel options do you get?\n\n*There is no entry for your root (i.e. the top entry, \"/\") filesystem location. It shows that you have an 80GB partition but it doesn't show a mount point.

I've been using Ubuntu One for the last year or two to sync/backup specific important files and folders on my computer. Rather than just using it like \"Dropbox\" (i.e., putting files I want to sync in the specific \"ubuntu one\" folder), I am taking advantage of the total integration of Ubuntu One to sync the folders as they exist in my file tree. Recently, I decided that I needed to better organize that filetree (I'm a professor and a researcher, so I accrue a lot of files), including renaming and reorganizing many of the files/folders that I've been syncing to Ubuntu One. My question is this: what happens to the \"old\" versions of all these renamed files/folders up in the cloud? I know Ubuntu One keeps versioned editions of each file, and only keeps the changed parts in order to save space. But if I renamed the folder, and then re-synced it, I'm assuming that a brand new file is created, which is a complete duplicate of the old file. I checked the \"Cloud Folders\" tab in the Ubuntu One preferences dialog, and it does appear that every single one of my \"old\" fodlers/files is still there, but not actively being synced any more. Am I right to assume that these are taking up extra space in my Ubuntu One account? That these are, in fact, full duplicates of the \"new\" files?\nMy main question here is: Can I safely delete these once the \"new\" organization of my file tree has completely synced? I realize that I will loose the versioning saved by Ubuntu One in these \"old\" files, but I am sure that I don't need that info anymore (everything is exactly up to date). If this is okay, how, exactly can I remove these old versions? There does not seem to be a way to \"delete\" them from the Ubuntu One preferences dialog. \nThanks in advance...\n\nA: I 'm not sure to correctly understand your question. If you rename a file or folder you have only this one and not also the older one. So I assume that you have made a copy of your folder tree. In this case you have a double of your files that use a double of the U1 space. So I think that you have to simply delete the older version. \n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to lock screen stops working I've set the keyboard shortcut super+L to lock my screen.

I'd like an especially high repeat rate and low delay on my backspace key, but a regular delay and rate on every other key. This command works, but sets it for every key:\nxset r rate 120 30\n\nIs there a way to have different settings for individual keys?\n\nA: I think the answer to your question is no, there is no way to achieve this short of modyfying the X.org sources.\nHere is an explanation why xset won't work; I am creating an answer because it corresponds to comments found in both the OP and the answer above.\nxset r has several alternative ways of being called. Mutually exclusive, that is:\nxset r 22\n\n..will turn the repeating for keycode 22 (backspace) on, while xset -r 22 will turn it off.\nAlternatively, it is possible to specify keyboard rates, but only for all keys:\nxset r rate [num1 [num2]]\n\nYou cannot combine the two.\nAs for the 08 / 22 confusion: 08 is the ASCII code for the ASCII character backspace, and 22 is the X windows keycode for the particular physical key. \nUnfortunately, the two settings (rate / delay and per-key repeat on-off) are handled by two different X extensions:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"rate/delay\" is handled by the XF86Misc extension. xset changes the rate / delay using function XF86MiscGetKbdSettings( display, values ). The values XF86MiscKbdSettings structure contains only fields for repeat rate and delay (and two others of no importance here), and there is no way of applying it but general.\n\n*the \"per key on-off\" is controlled by the XKB extension. The XKB extension allows to control selected keys, but the structure that holds information on these keys only contains a field that can take one of three values: default, no repeat, repeat.\n\n\nIn short, this seems to be impossible to achieve in the current X.org setup.\n\nA: Try:\nxset r 8 rate 120 30\n\nThe the xset manpage at www.x.org gives some help on the command. I also found Keyboard Keys and Key Code Values, which is on Adobe's website but I think that the key codes should be correct.\n", "Q: DVD not detected?

If I press Ctrl-Alt-Delete when the Ubuntu VM is in focus, the Ubuntu system sees it and shuts down after 60 seconds.  This does not happen if the Ubuntu VM is not in focus.  I know I could just \"be careful\", but I'd like to avoid accidentally shutting down my Ubuntu system every time I lock my machine.  \nI found the following directions for disabling this behavior on Ubuntu:\n\nTo disable Ctrl+Alt+Del REBOOT edit\n  #sudo nano /etc/init/control-alt-delete.conf comment out:\n#start on control-alt-delete\n#task\n#exec shutdown -r now “Control-Alt-Delete pressed”\n\n\nI tried that, but it's not working (even after rebooting the system).  Considering how common this answer appeared to be, I'm a bit confused.  Any other ways to disable this behavior?  Thanks! \n\nA: Not sure if this works the same in 10.04, but in 12.04 this is controlled by keyboard shortcuts, and you can easily disable it using GUI:\n\nIs a similar dialog available in 10.04? (try in System > Preferences menu)\nAlso, as Ben pointed out, even if you prevent Ubuntu from Logging out / Rebooting / Shutting down etc, the simple fact of Ubuntu receiving the Ctrl+Alt+Del event from the VM software may prevent your host OS from acting upon it when Ubuntu has the focus.\nThat means you may fix the issue in Ubuntu side, but you would still need to make sure that this event is not captured by the client, even if it has the focus.\nIn VirtualBox, there's an \"Auto-Capture Keyboard\" option that controls this behaviour.\n\nA: There may be a chance that the VM software intercepts your pressing of Ctrl+Alt+Del and sends a \"reboot\" signal to the virtualized machine. \nLook at the VM soft properties regarding the interception of Ctrl+Alt+Del. If you're using VMWare, try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open config.ini file for VMware.\n\n*Append:\nmks.ctlAltDel.ignore = \"TRUE\"\n\n\n*Save the file.\nThis change also prevents VMWare from displaying a message about detecting Ctrl+Alt+Del\n", "Q: How to preserve/export my current Ubuntu installation after changing to a new SSD & installing Windows7? Ok, currently got set up: \n\n\n*\n\n*Puny little old 40GB hard drive  \n\n*AMD Athlon II X2 245 \n\n*4GB DDR3 RAM\n\n\nPlanning to upgrade to: \n\n\n*\n\n*120GB SSD hard drive (40GB is getting a little tight for me, but 120GB\nis plenty for my purposes and the speed boost would be nice)\n\n*AMD Athlon II X2 245 \n\n*4GB DDR3 RAM\n\n*Radeon HD7770 1GB DDR5 (going to start doing a bit of light gaming,\nis the only reason I use Windows at all!)\n\n\nMy question is how can I install Windows7 then Ubuntu on my new SSD and still preserve my settings/data I've currently got in Ubuntu? Such as the applications I've got installed already, files, passwords & bookmarks saved in various browsers, settings, etc \n(I don't care in the slightest however about what is currently on my Windows XP installation!)\nI forgot to mention an important point that I would have to reinstalled Ubuntu as originally I just installed it using a random Ubuntu Live CD 10.04 32-bit that I had at hand (and since upgraded to 12.04 32-bit via the automatic update), but I would like to change to 12.04 64-bit instead (just downloaded it last night, and I'll burn it to a DVD this evening).\n\nA: Are you able to physically connect both hard drives in the same machine? If so, great, the steps are easy. I'll outline each one, and you may ask for details for each if you are unsure about them.\n1 - Connect the new drive, disconnect the old one. Install Windows from DVD as you would in a clean, fresh machine.\n2 - Once Windows is installed and working fine, power off and connect the old hard drive.\n3 - Boot using Ubuntu Live CD\n4 - Start gparted, shrink the Windows partition to make room for Ubuntu. I suggest shrinking to the minimum size plus approx 15/20GB. Create an extended partition to take up the all the remaining space\n5 - Copy the Ubuntu partition from the old to the new drive, inside the extended partition. Copy the swap partition too, if you have one. Yes, gparted can copy and paste partitions from one drive to the other ;)\n6 - You may resize the Ubuntu partition a few gigs, but I suggest leaving room for a brand new NTFS \"data\" partition, which in the future can be used by both systems to store your music, videos, documents, downloads, etc. \n6.5 - Also, if you don't have a swap partition yet, create or leave room for one. Size should be at least equal to your RAM, to enable hibernation.\n7 - You now should have these partitions: 2 primary ones created by Windows (a 100MB one and the shrank one, ~30GB), an extended partition taking the rest of the disk, the Ubuntu logical partition inside it (~30GB too), the swap, and a lot of free space (or your newly-created NTFS \"data\" partition). Label those partitions accordingly, so it's easy to tell them apart.\n8 - Power off, disconnect the old hard drive, boot  again using the Ubuntu Live CD\n9 - Follow these instructions to reinstall grub and make Ubuntu boot again\n10 - Done! :-)\nA few remarks, taken from comments so they don't look like a chat window:\nIf instead of keeping the same install you want to change from 32 to 64 bits, within the same Ubuntu release, you may simply install the 64 Ubuntu on top of the 32 (just select the same partition), and the install will keep your /home, settings and packages. And you don't even need to backup: you already have your old drive as one ;)\nIf upgrading version, I would consider formatting the partition and forget about restoring settings and apps. Because settings from an older app may not apply to a newer version of the same app. Even software selection is fuzzy: some packages are deprecated / renamed / not necessary in newer releases, so not worth the trouble.

So the approaches I suggest you are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade your Catalyst to the latest version. IIRC, it's 12.6 now. I also have an ATI card, a Radeon HD 7770, and it works great with 12.6.\n\n*Try other versions too. 11.4, 12.4. Download package from ubuntu or build it yourself directly from AMD.\n\n*Or simply forget about FGLRX and go with the default, open-source, usually trouble-free drivers.

I would like to either share local mail folders between Thunderbird and Alpine mail client, or export a set of Thunderbird local mail folders that I can import into Alpine.\n\nA: While Alpine and Thunderbird can't share local folders, you can export any folder from Thunderbird and view the emails in Alpine if you export the folder in an mbox format. That is the only way Alpine will be able to read the data.\nHere is what you need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to install the ImportExportTools addon in Thunderbird, then restart the program and now any folder you right click will have the necessary export options (screenshot 1). \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Now choose your folder in Thunderbird and then right-click it and you must choose the first option 'export folder', and select the location it is to be saved in (i.e. your mail folder in your home folder). It will create by default a single mbox file of the folder and the file will take the name of that folder exported.\n\n*Now make sure that single exported file is in your mail folder that Alpine uses, and open Alpine and go to setup and then click lists (L), and then Add Collection (A). Now (see screenshot below) type any old nickname for the collection (the actual name will be the mbox file name, which is called important in my case). \n\n*Then fill in the 'path'- i.e. the location of the file; just leaving it mail/ is good enough for Alpine (see screenshot) if the new file is in the base of that directory, although for later folders you will need to use mail/local/, for example. But always specify them like this, without the actual name of the file, just the folder location. (see screenshot below). You can leave 'server' and 'view' blank. Save the changes and exit that menu. \n\nIf any of this sounds obscure, take a look at this useful Princeton guide.\n\n\n*\n\n*Now just go back to the main menu and select folder list and select the new folder list entry (whatever it is called- see screenshot 3), and then you should see your new folder  (see screenshot 4).\n\n\n\nHere's the screenshot (number 4) showing the newly imported mails (from another folder I created, called random):\n\nJust repeat this process for any other folders or when you want to update them.\n\nA: Meanwhile it is possible to change the default folder format of thunderbird to Maildir format as described here: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird/Maildir\nThis could make setting this up a lot easier.\n", "Q: How to connect to other Ubuntu machine as X Server?

with Windows 7? I bought a $600 laptop about a year ago with Windows 7 installed. I had Ubuntu on a previous computer, but I accidentally deleted Windows in the process on my old computer. I like Ubuntu but I still need Windows on this computer, and I'm afraid of messing up again, whether it be with partitions or with Grub.\nI really don't have any way of backing up my files at the moment other than a 4GB flash drive, and I need to know if it's safe to try and install Ubuntu alongside this Windows 7 without screwing over my computer. I had a problem with my last computer with partitions; it seems that if you mess up with your partitions, it's irreversible. \nAny tips on getting this to work out? The last thing I want is a repeat of what happened my last computer.\n\nA: If your computer has a DVD drive, I would suggest your backup your system with one of the many different programs available. I used the one delivered with my laptop.\nIf you don't want to touch partitions, then you're left with using a Wubi installation.\n", "Q: Can I switch between workspaces with middle click? I seem to remember that there was a way to hold down the middle mouse button and have it bring up the workplace switcher, then twitch the mouse in the direction of the workspace you wanted.  \nThe UI when the middle button was clicked was identical to the way Precise now performs CTRL+SHIFT+arrow moves, but using the mouse is quicker.  Is this still possible in Precise?\n\nA: I think you cannot do it using the mouse middle button.\nThe mouse middle button in Ubuntu 12.04 is used to switch between open applications.\nApplications such as compiz might give you the ability to accomplish this.\n", "Q: How do I force Wubi to install a 32-bit version? I'm using Windows 8 (32bit) customer preview and installing WUBI Ubuntu 12,04.1.\nI down loaded 32 bit installer from ubuntu dot com, The wubi installer says AMD 64 xt.\nI had a previous 12,04 install and in the terminal typed in uname -a, it say's 64 bit. \nI also opened detail from the system and it read 64 bit system. \nMy question is: how to ensure that a windows/wubi/ubuntu/installer is 32 bit or 64 bit BEFORE making a commitment to install from the wrong wubi install?\nAfter posting this I did another wubi installation. Signed into ubuntu, opened system settings, open Details: OS Type 64 Bit. Why is it doing this? I have a 32 Bit machine: Toshiba Satellite A-215 S5818 (previous Windows Vista)<--wiped clean. from an earlier installation of Ubuntu 10.10 which worked, in feb 2012 i installed Win8 Customer Preview Release (32Bit) which took over the BOOT order and 140 GB Hard Disk. I am trying patiently to install WUBI 32 BIT Ubuntu 12.04 Install, it keeps returning 64 BIT install.. Why??\nI should also mention that i was successful in a dual boot install ubuntu 10.04/win8 32 bit install and upgraded to 12.04 which is fine for now, but i want a win8/wubi/ubuntu12.04 32 bit working not 64 bit breaking what i have. \nthank you.\n\nA: Actually, WUBI knows it better than you do. Toshiba Satellite A-215 S581 comes with the  AMD Turion64 CPU, definitely a 64b processor.\nYou wouldn't be able to run the 64b OS on a 32b machine, but you are -- since you could run uname -a.\nIf you really want a choice, for whatever reason, then drop WUBI, install Ubuntu on a dedicated partition and use CD / USB stick image which you can choose to be 32b rather than 64b. In any case, what is wrong about having the 64b system?\n\nA: \nFrom the official WUBI guide\n\nCan I force Wubi to download and install a 32 bit version of Ubuntu?\nYes. Either pre-download the appropriate 32 bit ISO manually and place it in the same folder as Wubi.exe or start Wubi from the command prompt with the \"--32bit\" argument.\nTo modify arguments without using the command prompt, right-click Wubi.exe and select \"Create Shortcut\". Then right-click the shortcut, select Properties, and modify the Target line, for example: \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\<user>\\Desktop\\wubi.exe\" --32bit\n", "Q: Ubuntu can't get past splash screen \nPossible Duplicate:\nMy computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it? \n\nI installed Ubuntu 12.04 from a CD several weeks ago.

I tried a normal boot, and that just gave me a purple screen.\nI can boot into recovery mode but can't do much while there. I tried to fix issues but I think I may have made it worse because now I can't seem to get into the recovery menu/mode at all. \nI'm terrible new to computers/Linux, so please be explicit if you are gracious and kind enough to answer my question!\n\nA: If you are new to computers, I think the best way is to go easy, step by step.\nI would suggest you to boot with the live CD, then backup your data from it and reinstall; to make it easier, just backup your whole home folder.\nTry to grab the latest cd image before doing that. But older releases may work better too, like 10.04 that I still use at work!\nIf you want to learn more, try to get some logs to we analyze, like dmesg, /var/log/Xorg.0.log; there are more logs around but these may help a lot.

Emergency I don't know what to do, I was taking some space away from my linux partition and I rebooted and this happened I'm completely stuck is there anyway I can change it to boot with windows instead of grub menu stuff or whatever, idk what to do please help!\n\nA: You likely moved the partition slightly when you were resizing it.  If I am correct, you need to fix your grub and you should be able to boot normally.\nThe easiest way to fix your grub is to use Boot-Repair\nThe detailed instructions and more info is HERE but the quick instructions are:\nBoot into your LiveCD/USB and type the following into a terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\n\n\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nThis will install and then run boot-repair in your live environment(nothing will be installed to your hard drive)\nWhen the window pops up click Recommended Repair  this will scan your system for any OS's and then install grub with the correct information on the location of your Ubuntu partition and when you exit the live environment and reboot you should be able to load Ubuntu.\n\nWhen boot-repair runs it will create a file that will be uploaded to paste.ubuntu.com note the url that it gives you and you will be able to link to it to get more help.  More information on this can be found on the link I gave above and well as more detailed instructions and information on advanced options(advanced options are usually not needed in a normal install)\n\nA: you should create a partition exclusively to boot, so if something wrong happens to your linux partition, the boot partition is untouched!\nboot with ubuntu live cd and look at this file (if your partition is accessible): /boot/grub/grub.cfg; there must have a entry there to windows that you may be able to change, but without knowing more details its hard to guess..\nwhat you can do now? you mind reinstalling linux with the cdrom or pendrive? that way it will make available again your windows partition automatically (but you will loose your old linux partition data, unless you resize it without touching the area with data, so you can recover it later in some way).\nPs.: may be you can fix your partitions manually with fdisk using the ubuntu live cd, but requires: \"know what you are doing\" thing.. I myself havent done that, just a tip to be asked/researched; EDIT: I just remember, there is a flag you can set with fdisk to say the kind of filesystem, set it to ext4, there is a builtin help, do it slowly with care, read it all, list the types and choose the best matching to what you remember it was (probably ext4)\n", "Q: How can I install the Unity Photo Lens I can't install the Photo Lens.

Thank you very much.\n\nA: After a brief look at https://launchpad.net/~scopes-packagers/+archive/ppa?field.series_filter=, it seems that there is no package named unity-lens-photo. It looks like  unity-lens-photos, however is in the main archive for quantal (12.10) but not for precise (12.04).  \nIf you really want it in 12.04, you could update your unity to the quantal version with this ppa (https://launchpad.net/~benkai/+archive/precise-unity-backport) although that could be a bit risky as it is still in beta.\n\nA: For some reason, unity-lens-photos is not available in the scopes-packagers PPA.  However, you can download a .deb file containing unity-lens-photos from here.  Double click on the downloaded file to install the lens.  \nYou will still need to install the unity-scope-shotwell and unity-scope-flickr packages (from the PPA) in order to provide sources for the lens to search and log out and back in again in order to activate the lens.\n\nA: In order to install Unity Photo Lens on Ubuntu 12.04, I had to install the deb package found here. That solved the Flickr problem but not the Shotwell functionality.\n\nA: unity-lens-photo separately download the DEB package to install later, and at the end: \n sudo add- apt-repository ppa: scopes-packagers/ppa \n sudo apt-get update && sudo apt- get install unity-lens-photo unity-scope- Shotwell unity-scope- flickr \n for me it works \n P.S. \n Some of the packages that are needed and there is no time, unfortunately, is not easy to separately download:)? \n I greet\n", "Q: Font rendering problem after accidentally deleting font folder I accidentally deleted my fonts folder in home/usr/share, then I re-installed dejavu core fonts and ubuntu font family in order to be able to work with my ubuntu again.\nThen I started to install other necessary font packages.

Whenever I go to the Chrome web store to install an extension, I think it opens a window right under the Chrome Window and I'm unable to access it. So, I cannot install any extension on Google Chrome in Ubuntu.\nAnyone else has seen this? How do I check if there is a window under the browser window?\n\nA: If you have several windows open in google chrome you should see a small arrows next to the google chrome icon in the launcher.IN this example i have 2 windows open thus showing  2 arrows\n\nTo get a Quick view of all windows currently  open,  left click on the icon and you will see something like the below picture,which shows all current open windows.Click again to go back to original window or click on the window you wish to open. This also works for other programs for example having several gedit pages open.\n\nIf i go to google chrome settings/extensions/get extensions the chrome web store opens in another tab for me \n\nA: Thanks for the detailed answer; but it does not fix my problem. The Chrome browser seems to be creating a Dialog box under my browser window. And I cannot move the browser window to access it, since it is blocked for a response from the dialog box.\nThe Chrome icon on the Unity launcher does not show the multiple markers.\nThe short cut keys also do not get the Dialog box to the front.\nBTW, I'm able to go to the Chrome web store; the problem happens when I click to add some extension.\n(I'm using 12.04 in VirtualBox.)\n\nA: Unfortunately I think that it is how Ubuntu works with browser. We have very similar problems with our applets in firefox and ubuntu. Very often it loads java dailog window and immediately hides it under a browser. It's very confusing for our users because application is blocked by modal window (JDialog) and it is hidden underneath.

I would like /dev/sda2 to contain GRUB AND Ubuntu.  So ideally when I turn my computer on, BIOS would ask if I'd like to boot Windows 7 or Ubuntu(or Grub or partition 2), and I could choose either one.  But I would like Grub and Ubuntu to be on the same partition, so they will not interfere in any way with windows or window's boot loader/partition (sda3)\nHow can I do this?\nCatch: when formatting partitions, Ubuntu does not give me the option to make them virtual partitions, so that makes things harder.\nI tried: installing Ubuntu to /dev/sda2 (which I formatted as ext4) and then told the Ubuntu installer to install the bootloader to /dev/sda2.  But when I select \"Ubuntu\" from BIOS's boot selection, it loads a black screen and says \"invalid arch independent ELF magic\ngrub rescue> _\"  and allows me to input stuff.  How can I fix this, or tell my computer where Grub is?\n\nA: BIOS is not smart enough to ask you about partitions, in fact, it knows nothing about partitions. From the BIOS point of view, your disk is just a sequence of 512-byte sectors.\nWhen BIOS is ready to pass the control to the bootloader, it just reads the first 512 bytes from the disk and just blindly passes the control to whatever program is located at the predefined position in that data. It is the job of that program (MBR bootloader) to load the OS (this usually involves loading a more complex bootloader program from some other location on the disk).\nPoint is - it is your bootloader, stored in MBR, which is aware about partitions and stuff. You may have a Windows bootloader there or GRUB. If you find a way to configure the Windows bootloader to pass control to GRUB which is installed on /dev/sdaX then your schema would work although I never heard of anyone doing this. Windows is not very concerned about being able to load other OSes, you know.\nIt is possible to do what you want if you have two hard drives in your machine - just install Windows on one and Ubuntu on another, and switch between them in BIOS. Or, I don't know, maybe it is possible to put GRUB on a flash drive? That actually would be cool - if the drive is unplugged Windows would boot, if you plug the drive in then Ubuntu would boot (provided that \"boot from USB\" comes first in the list of boot devices) .\n\nA: I use a third party boot manager, which means I specifically want grub installed to a partition.  It's easy to take care of this during installation since Ubuntu lets you put grub wherever you like.  However, if you want to do it after the fact, it's as simple as:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda1 --force\nwhere sda1 is the partition where you'd like to put it.\n\nA: May I ask why you don't want to install GRUB in the MBR, thus replacing the Windows bootloader? \n\nInstalling GRUB in a partition is not recommended and generally considered to be a bad idea. One is usually better off letting Ubuntu install GRUB in the hard drive's MBR. \nGRUB can then take care of loading either Ubuntu or Windows. This is simple, harmless, and the recommended approach.\nThis process is also completely reversible, should you choose to return to Windows and use its bootloader exclusively.\n\nShould you decide to install GRUB in the MBR (as you should), Boot Repair is the way to go.\nInstall GRUB\nTo install the GRUB bootloader, follow these steps.\nOpen a terminal in Ubuntu, and run the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair\nboot-repair\n\nAfter a few seconds, Boot Repair's main window will open.\nClick on Recommended repair.\nYou're done!\nReboot to test everything out.\nHold down the Shift key as the computer boots to display the GRUB menu, which allows you to select which OS you'd like to boot. \n\nGlossary\n\nBootloader: a piece of code that runs before any operating system is running. A bootloader is used to boot other operating\n  systems. Each operating system usually has its own bootloader.\nGRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader): a bootloader package developed to support multiple operating systems and allow the user to select among them during boot-up. It is Ubuntu's default bootloader.\nCommand, command line: the traditional Unix environment , where you type commands to tell the computer what to do.\nTerminal: an application that allows you to access the command line. Open it by hitting its keyboard shortcut, Ctrl Alt T\n\n\nA: It's easy to do. Just download EasyBCD to edit the windows bootloader.\n", "Q: Grub messed up on dual boot machine - can't boot live usb I have a laptop on which I had Win 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 installed. The hdd has two partitions (one primary and one extended). Grub wasn't loaing initially so I ran  the boot disk repair tool which seemed to sort it out. However, I mistakenly removed python (long story) from the Ubuntu OS and this obviously messed up Ubuntu a lot. So I decided to reintsall both Win7 and Ubuntu 12.04 in an attempt to get things back fresh. Win 7 went fine, but now when I try and use the Live USB to install Ubuntu I get:\n\nerror: no such device: \ngrub rescue >\n\nI guess grub is still there despite the Win 7 reinstall and it can't find the partition for Ubuntu (which I deleted prior to the fresh install).\nI have tried fixmbr in windows console and the boot-repair-disk utility, but no joy. I cannot boot the live usb so no access to linux.\nA real mess.\nAny suggestions from the community?\n\nA: On one occasion I had Ubuntu installer to mistakingly install GRUB on the flash drive instead of the HDD - the machine only booted while the flash drive was plugged in. \nI would try booting to Windows and re-creating the LiveUSB to make sure you don't have GRUB installed on it by the previous install. \n", "Q: Programs become unresponsive I have changed from Mint 13 to Ubuntu, complete fresh install.

In fact, that's the point of them being hidden!  However, annoyingly, bash takes these directories into account when considering tab autocompletion.  \nThis is particularly annoying when I have the following scenario: a .svn foler along with a single folder that I want to traverse into by simply pushing tab.  (This typically comes up with deep Java packages...)  \nIs there any way to change the default behavior?  Worst case scenario I have to type '.' before tab, which seems like a no brainer for my usability.\n\nA: Just add this line to your ~/.bashrc (if you don't have one, create it):\nbind 'set match-hidden-files off'\n\nAnd bash-completion should behave the way you want.\nThere are also many other options you might want to tweak in bash-completion.

This is a pain as it cannot be automated (or can it?) on start up.\nWhat I would rather is some sort of X session emulator that pulls the console output of the program into the CLI so that I can automate server start ups.\nIs there any program or method that can do this?\n\nA: You can install the xvfb package, and use xvfb-run /usr/bin/program to run that program under a virtual X framebuffer session. You won't have any UI to poke at if you need to, though.\n\nA: You can use vncserver to run graphical programs from an init script.  \nI assume the program will load and do its thing without any user input.  If they do, you can connect via vnc and do what needs to be done.  The session will keep running when you are done.\nThis page shows now to make an init script which runs a graphical program.  Should be easily adapted to your needs: http://www.abdevelopment.ca/blog/start-vnc-server-ubuntu-boot \n\nA: I am not familiar with your particular use case but if you can run your application under an X session on both the client and the server machine, then you can use X11 forwarding over an SSH connection. You don’t need to execute the app on the client to use this feature -- but you must be able to do do so.\nYou can use both ssh -X or ssh -Y commands to achieve this. Take a look at this post about differences of the two.\nTo use this, establish an ssh connection to the server as you normally would from the client -- except add -X or -Y as option (note they are both capital). Then just execute your application. It will execute the application on the server but forward the UI to the client so you can interact with it.\n", "Q: Is there any way to see data coming from bluetooth?

It is now in a USB2 enclosure and I want to use it to back up my current laptop /home.\nTo do this I need to shrink the /home partition on the 1TB backup drive.  It only uses about 500GB so that shouldn't be a problem, I'll start the laptop with an Ubuntu live USB, plug in the 1TB drive, and use Gparted to shrink the 1TB /home partition to ~500GB.  \nThen I can create a second partition in the newly freed space, and cp -ax my laptop's /home over to it.\nUnfortuntely, Ubuntu Live USB can detect and mount the external hdd, and Gparted can see it's there, but Gparted can't read it and hence can't resize it.

I tried wget, Kget Uget and so many other download managers but no increase in speed.Also none of these was as user friendly or efficient as IDM like they don't give an option of downloading things on their own. Each time I  have to open the the application and manually type in the url. What are the options available for me?\n\nA: I used to use IDM in windows before I switched to Linux.  I missed it for a while, but found alternatives for where I needed it.\nThe problem is probably not, as mentioned in the comments, slow download speed, per se.  The problem I had was that some sites limit download speed per connection, so a download manager that makes several connections can make a dramatic improvement, sometimes 5 times faster, or more.\nI had no problems with sites that did not limit speeds, and would get the maximum speed from a single connection.\nThe best I've found for now is a Firefox addon, called DownthemAll!.  If you use Firefox, give it a try. It has several options, and took a little playing around to learn the best way to use it, but it can easily duplicate the normal downloading capabilities, and with a little creativity, it's easy to organize downloads on the fly.\n\nA: If the command line is your thing, try aria2.

The device won't work out of the box. Tried to go the NDISWrapper route, but using the GUI, received the following message:\nModule could not be loaded. Error was:\nFATAL: Module ndiswrapper not found.\nIs the ndiswrapper module installed?\n\nDespite the fact that it showed up listed in the GUI, the device still did not function properly.\nHow should I proceed from here?\n\nA: At this point, it looks like one solution is to build and install ndiswrapper from source.  I refer you to Brian Zier's \"Getting the Belkin N600 DB to work on Ubuntu\" guide:\n\nUninstall the built-in ndiswrapper and clean up any configuration you\n  previously had:\n\nsudo apt-get remove --purge ndiswrapper-common ndiswrapper-utils-1.9 ndisgtk\nsudo rm /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/ubuntu/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper.ko\nsudo rm /etc/modprobe.d/ndiswrapper.conf\nsudo rm -r /etc/ndiswrapper/*\n\n\nNext, build ndiswrapper from source:\n\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential\nwget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/ndiswrapper/stable/ndiswrapper-1.57.tar.gz\ntar -xvf ndiswrapper-1.57.tar.gz\ncd ndiswrapper-1.57\nmake\nsudo make install\nsudo depmod -a\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nThis also works with ndiswrapper-1.58\nDisclaimer: While the excerpt above has gotten me past the issues with ndiswrapper itself, I haven't yet been able to complete the whole guide as to get the N600 working properly with my own WiFi, which I suspect may be due to my router's configuration. Your mileage may vary.\n\nA: The Belkin F9L1101 is Based on the Realtek RTL8192 chipset, which has linux drivers available. So you can get this to install by downloading the RTL8192 driver source code and compiling.\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-generic git\n\ngit clone https://github.com/lwfinger/rtl8192du.git\ncd rtl8192du\n\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nmodprobe 8192du\n\nThis worked perfectly for me.

I haven't tested this on any version less than 14.04, so I can't assure it will work, but worse case, if this fails on an earlier version of Ubuntu, you have the option of upgrading to 14.04.\nIf you can't plug in to get the internet connection you need to download this, just clone that git repository (first step) on a computer that does have internet and then use a flash drive to copy the drivers over to your computer.

Please check your scanner is connected and powered on.\" The earliest version available from avasys seems to be 2.28 but these don't work either, giving the same result (no scanners detected error).\nA working fix was to run the following, in the order listed:\ndpkg -i iscan-data_1.8.0-0_all.deb\ndpkg -i iscan_2.26.2-1.ltdl7_i386.deb\ndpkg -i iscan-plugin-gt-f700_2.1.0-3_i386.deb\n\nI had these files saved from a couple of years ago - it seems they are no longer available on the web.\nHope this helps someone, even if only to save the time I wasted trying to get the current version and the oldest version available at avasys to work.\n\nA: You can find these deb packets on \nhttp://download.ebz.epson.net/dsc/search/01/search/searchModule\nJust write \"perfection v10\" or the version of your scanner and \"Linux\" in the operating system, and you will find them.\nI have installed the Epson Perfection v10 on Linux Mint 13 and works fine.\nThese deb will install \"Image Scan! for Linux\" which is similar than the Windows program you installed with Epson drivers. \n\nA: I have an Epson GT-S80 which I couldn't get to work.\nAfter going through a number of answers I've finally found a process that worked perfectly\nTry this....\nInstalling an Epson GT-S80 (I'm sure this would work for others)\n1 – Check whether computer is a 32 or 64 bit configuration\n(Terminal) $ uname -a <enter>\n\nx86 = 64b 1386 = 32 bit\n2 – make sure Scanner is attached to the pc & switched on\nLocate product id\n(Terminal) $ lsusb <Enter>\n\nProbable result = ID 04B8:0136\n3 – Ensure user is in scanner group\n(Terminal) $ id <Enter>\n\nYou are looking for 109 (Scanner).

Both work, and both open the same location.\nThis seems a bit redundant; what could be done about it?\nUpdate: Turning auto-hide on made it obvious that I have multiple Launchers showing. With auto-hide off, they simply overlap, making it look like there's a double trash icon, but with auto-hide enabled, I can display one Launcher (and therefore one trash icon) at a time. Still, two are running simultaneously.\nSecond update: This problem appears to be caused by the way Ubuntu handles multiple displays on my Asus UX32VD Ultrabook. Somehow, the laptop display cannot be used while my external display is connected. It is shown in the Displays list, but remains black no matter how I configure it.\nThe external display runs at 1920x1200, the laptop monitor should run at 1920x1080. It therefore becomes obvious that the Launcher that's supposed to run on the laptop display, is actually displayed on the external monitor.\nUsing nomodeset as a kernel parameter as indicated here makes the laptop display inaccessible altogether, detecting the external monitor as the laptop display and making resolutions other than 1920x1200 inaccessible. That is not an option.\nWithout nomodeset, the external monitor works as it should, but the laptop monitor stays black. When I disable the laptop monitor, the external display goes black, too.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*First check that the Ubuntu ISO is correct by checking the md5sum or sha1sum.\nTo check, run the following command on the terminal:\n\n    md5sum /path/to/ubuntu/image.iso\n\n          And make sure they match to the ones give on the release page.\n\n\n*\n\n*If they don't match, download the image again.\n\n\n*However, if they do match, this would be a bug.

No luck.\nIt's also keeping me from upgrading alle the other packages.\nWhat to do?\nUpdate\nAfter following instructions in the answer by @lpanebr, it is now stuck at the linux-firmware package. So, maybe it's a more general problem than being related to specific package(s)? Although it did download some packages without problems before getting stuck at linux-firmware.\n\nA: My problem was that I interrupted the download of an apt-package (here linux-firmware) behind a proxy which caused a partial downloaded (and damaged) file in the proxy cache. When I tried to upgrade, the download of this package started in the middle of the file over and over again.\nWhat I did was to download the file manually, put it into /var/cache/apt/archives. \n\nA: I never got back to reveal the reason for this weird behaviour.\nIt turned out to most likely be a network issue. I'm pretty sure it was due to some antivirus/firewall/malware installed somewhere between me and the internet.\nIf I tunnelled everything via SSH to exit to the rest of the internet from my home connection, there was no problem. Similarly, no problems if I used a mobile hotspot.\nThe file I got to download from the URL was simply mangled and useless if downloaded directly via the company network.\n\nA: I was having a very similar problem. My update manager would always report \"Not all updates could be installed\". Whenever I tried this:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nI got this:\nThe following packages have been kept back:\n  0ad 0ad-data ginn libgrip0 linux-generic linux-headers-generic linux-image-generic touchegg\n\nThen I did:\nsudo apt-get purge touchegg 0ad 0ad-data\n\nBecause I knew I didn't need those anyway.\nAfter that the command line was still giving me the same as above. Then, for no particular reason, I did System Settings > Details and clicked the Install updates button. For my surprise it installed all those packages without any issues..\nVery weird..  hope this helps.\n\nA: Have you tried sudo apt-get dist-upgrade. It should install all the packages, even those that are not being upgraded now.\nIn fact, it means a distribution update. For me it was useful when I had some problem during the updating process.\n\nA: I got stuck at the sudo do-dist-upgrade, which was very annoying.\nexchanging servers in /etc/apt/sources.list resolved the issue, I took a best looking server from here:\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors\nand exchanged the standard one from ubuntu.com\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nafterwards.\n\nA: decibyte, I do a lot of Ubuntu work at my school, and have run into all sorts of proxy server issues.  Are you behind a proxy server?  At my school, we are supposed to use an auto proxy .pac file, but this has issues with apt in Ubuntu.  I downloaded the .pac file, opened it in gedit, and just read it.  I saw that the .pac file directs toward an http proxy address, but directs ftp to direct connection.  So, I changed my settings in the network manager to manual, and put my http proxy address and port in for http and https, and left ftp blank.  Click \"Apply System Wide\" and enter my password, and presto!  The only issue left is that Firefox does not seem to like this, so I change my setting back to auto and put in the address of the .pac file and DO NOT click \"Apply System Wide\" and everything works!!!!!!\nNow, if the proxy server is not the issue, then try the following commands:\n\nsudo apt-get autoclean\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nBe sure to watch out for error messages as you enter each command.  I hope this helps!\n\nA: I was using an anonymizing VPN (Spotflux) on the host system when I encountered similar issues.  I disabled for the duration of my apt-get sessions and didn't have any issues.\n\nA: This also happened to me just now, on the quantal distro. (actually it had been happening for about a week, and I would just exit the terminal.) Now that I looked into it, the ppa causing the problem in my case was VLC's:\nIgn ftp://ftp.videolan.org ./ Release\nErr ftp://ftp.videolan.org ./ Packages                \n  Server closed the connection\nErr ftp://ftp.videolan.org ./ Translation-en_PH\n  Server closed the connection\nErr ftp://ftp.videolan.org ./ Translation-en\n  Server closed the connection\nFetched 898 kB in 17min 4s (876 B/s)\nW: Failed to fetch ftp://ftp.videolan.org/pub/debian/stable/./Release.gpg  Server     closed the connection\n\nW: Failed to fetch ftp://ftp.videolan.org/pub/debian/stable/./Packages  Server closed the connection\n\nW: Failed to fetch ftp://ftp.videolan.org/pub/debian/stable/./en_PH  Server closed the connection\n\nW: Failed to fetch ftp://ftp.videolan.org/pub/debian/stable/./en  Server closed the connection\n\nE: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.\n\nIt seems they've released a new update in the past week or so; it may be causing problems. Nonetheless, I disabled the VLC ppa in software sources in the meantime and it solved the problem.\n\nA: This happened to me as well while performing an apt-get update\nKali Linux locked out and stopped passing traffic, causing the flow timers to bug out.\nThis was fixed by running:\n^C # To cancel the update\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThe stale flow was flushed out and my update continued with no problem.\n", "Q: Installed 7zip. Not working. And when removing, it says to remove Fileroller as well I installed 7zip today from software centre but it won't showed up in launch bar (side bar). I did a lot but failed to open 7zip \"window\" from any where. I clicked it in dash but then I was sent to software center showing that it is installed. I just don't know how to start it. Nor it is showing in right-click menu.\nI actually wanted to open flareget which is in .tar.gz. Ubuntu's default archive opener isn't opening it and showing me this:\n\nAnd if I try to remove 7zip, it's saying file-roller should also be removed:\n\nWhat's going on and what's solution?\n\nA: First of all, p7zip that you have installed is a command line tool -- it has no reason to appear in the sidebar. You run it from command line. It is an obscure little tool and in the fifteen or so years I use Linux I never had the need to install it.\nSecond: you definitely do not need p7zip to open tar.gz files; this is the standard archive / compression in Unix, virtually any Unix comes with tools provided to open and handle that files. .tar is the archive that has been compressed with gzip to get the .tar.gz file.\nThe error message that you are getting indicates that your file is broken; it was not completely downloaded. This is why gzip complains. p7zip will not help you, you need to download the file again.\nThird, the problem with dependencies is another issue. I tried to repeat your procedure, and did not observe the same problem. However, if it is a matter of keeping p7zip (which is not large), I'd just keep it.\n\nA: 7z is just a plugin/addon for file-roller, when installed you can open most of the archives using file-roller. You can also install from cli like so sudo apt-get install p7zip-full\nwhen right clicked on a file you can choose to compress it and also choose which format\nfrom there you can choose 7z. When right clicked an archive file, just choose extract\n\nif you really want to remove 7zip run this in the gnome-terminal sudo apt-get remove p7zip-full. Via software-center down below you get a checkbox option, next to it should be file-roller, uncheck it, then only 7zip will be removed.\n", "Q: MacBookPro 5,4, brightness problem I installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my macbookPro 5,4 and it seems like everything is working well expect the brightness control.\nThe functions keys are working and when pressing it I see the brightness bar changing, but the brightness doesn't change.\nChanging the brightness from the settings tools doesn't work as well.\nAny idea?\n\nA: There are a multitude of reasons why the brightness won't work on the Macbook.\ndo you see any  backlight  device under /sys/class/backlight?\nif there is more than one folder there it possible that the backlight utility is trying to change the backligt on the improper device.

I use Band-in-a-box (\"BIAB\") to create backing tracks to practice my guitar-playing, and keep the source files (filetype .MGU) created by BIAB in the same folder as the MP3 files derived from them. Because I share this folder with colleagues via Dropbox, I'm not in a position to move the .MGU files elsewhere.\nEvery time I start Rhythmbox it checks my music folders, and reports \"Import Errors\" on all the .MGU files.\nRB apparently ignores a number of unplayable filetypes in music folders - is there a way of adding .MGU to this group?\nI know I can just ignore the Import Errors, but one of these days there will be an error I would have wanted to know about.\n\nA: Rhythmbox uses gstreamer to open files. So, if there is a plugin that supports this exotic file type, the problem might be solvable.\nIn 12.04, \nsudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-bad0.10-0\n\nwill install, among others, a plugin called WildMidi which allows gstreamer to play midi-files (mgu-files are a type of midi files). However, it's not guaranteed that WildMidi will be able to play those mgu-files. If they don't have to be mgu-files you might try to convert them to a midi-format that you and your friends can still use and which can also be read by rhythmbox. \nI've found no option in Rhythmbox that could do what you're looking for. Maybe a different player does the job?\nOtherwise, you might as well copy those files to a new folder and share this one with your friends too (I know this is not what you were looking for but mgu is an exotic file type and rhythmbox has no native support for file blacklisting).\n\nA: In RB 3.3 on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, manually adding the following lines in ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/rhythmdb.xml:\n  <entry type=\"ignore\">\n    <title></title>\n    <genre></genre>\n    <artist></artist>\n    <album></album>\n    <location>file:///media/sf_Aaron/Music/01_Music/Apologetix/Albums/EasterStandardTime/EasterStandardTime-lyrics.txt</location>\n    <mountpoint>file:///media/sf_Aaron</mountpoint>\n    <date>0</date>\n    <media-type>application/octet-stream</media-type>\n  </entry>\n\nfinally got it to ignore the lyrics file for Apologetix's \"Easter Standard Time\" album.  Don't know how much of that is actually necessary; I just copied one that was already there and modified it.\nIt took a while to manually type and correct all the variations for my 27 files that it initially refused to ignore, but each one did eventually work when I got it right.  (spaces need to be %20)  Of course, you can't copy from the Import Errors list; that would have been too easy.\nBe sure to wait a few seconds after closing RB before attempting to save your edits.  RB maintains that file while it's running, and it takes that long to fully close.\n\n(I'm using a virtual machine with the files actually stored on the host, so the /media/sf_Aaron path is to access the host's share.)\n", "Q: Package Manager cannot access repositories but internet is working I am currently at a conference in another country and my package manager cannot access repositories.

Both Percona and MariaDB are much better supported, especially on Ubuntu, than the Oracle MySQL distributions.  Going the Oracle route will lead to many incompatibilities with how software is being managed, configured, started/stopped, etc. on Ubuntu (or other debian derived distros).\n5.6 is very new (as of Feb 2013 the package minor is alpha-60) so the apt-get method is not yet fully supported (for server-5.6) by Percona, as far as I can tell.  You can however download the 5.6 *.deb packages for Ubuntu 12.04 from percona.com/downloads/ and then use 'sudo dpkg -i' locally to install them.\nI would strongly advise against installing RPM packages on Ubuntu/Debian due to many incompatibility issues that may arise.\nAnother alternative, and IMHO a better one, is to stay with 5.5 (latest is actually 5.5.29 so it already includes many of the goodies from 5.6) for a while longer, and switch to 5.6 (package name: percona-server-server) once it is out of alpha.

When an ssh server package is installed it generates a new fingerprint and installs it in /etc/ssh. Note that newer versions off ssh hash the hostnames/addresses.\n\n*If you were connecting to a new guest (at a new IP or name), or an old guest but at a new IP or name. While Kamil is using a bridged network, this problem can occur when default networking is used as the ssh command for various guests is directed to the host computer. The same is true for guests behind a NAT firewall where the source of the ssh is on the other side of the firewall. The solution is to use the hostkeyalias function of the client's ssh configuration files.\n\n*Something is deleting or modifying your ~/.ssh/known_hosts file in the account from which you are initiating ssh.\nSo either the guest fingerprints are changing or there is a change in the mapping of guest->name->IP address, or the account you are ssh'ing from is forgetting their fingerprints.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you connect to the same guest twice in a row seconds apart and the The authenticity of host 'samename.local (same ip adress)' can't be established.\nECDSA key fingerprint is xx:yy: ... message changes the fingerprint, and you can confirm that you reached the same guest by examining its contents (not by MAC address), you know the guest is changing its fingerprint. You should be able to confirm this by examining the times is ls -l of the guests /etc/ssh directory. If you were rebooting in between, and if it were from a CD (it's not) or an installation USB key or installation USB key image this would be understandable. You don't mention having to reboot these guests to get the error, either. So this possibility seems improbable.\n\n*If you can see that entering the same ssh command gets you to a new guest by examining the contents of the guest you know you have a problem in name->ip->guest mapping. There's lots to go wrong here. \n\n*If you see the same actual fingerprint over and over and see that the IP and name of the guest haven't changed you have a problem with your ssh client machine erasing all or part of the .ssh/known_host file. You can confirm that with the times in ls -l ~/.ssh/known_host. This seems improbable to me.\nIf you haven't disabled StrictHostKeyChecking on the ssh client it may help narrow this down, as well. That option, normally the default, will cause ssh to fail to connect if it goes to the same guest-guestname-guestip and the fingerprint has changed. I see that isn't the trouble you are having, which is confusing if you are connecting to the same place over and over.\nThe time I see this is when I ssh into my guests and they have been assigned new IP addresses or when I ssh into them from a different account. (Each account has its own known_hosts file--they are not computer-wide).\n\nA: My problem is solved. But I didn't have time to mention it. After removing my ~/.ssh/known_hosts from the client and re-initializing the connection it asked me for the fingerprint only one time. \nThen after rebooting the client it never asked me for the fingerprint again.

(Normally this is the only way for the system to spontaneously mark the file system as read-only, to prevent further damage.) Try running:\ndmesg | less\n\nAnd scroll to near the bottom to see if there are errors related to your file system and disk. Look for messages about uncorrectable read or write errors (probably on sda), or file system errors (e.g. messages about ext3 or ext4 errors).  then investigate whether the disk itself is failing (in which case you'll need to get a new one), or whether it's just a logical failure (in which case you can probably repair the file system with fsck to fix your problem).\nAnother issue:\nIf your filesystem supports journaling try to disable it and see.

I'm using a Logitech K750(keyboard) and M705(mouse) using the same (one!) unifying USB connector. I paired them with my mac, but use them on my desktop with Ubuntu 12.10. Works nice. Just a few adjustments I'd like to do.\nThis mouse allows to disable the \"steps\" of the scroll wheel easily, which enables me on the mac to scroll stepless like using a touchpad. I'm not talking about smooth scrolling but stepless scrolling! This does somehow not work on Ubuntu. Is there no possibility to do this? This mouse also supports horizontal scrolling (not stepless). Is there a way to adjust these features? Maybe in xorg.conf? Maybe someone has a mouse xorg.conf-section I can experiment with?\nxev | grep button tells me there's no difference between using the wheel with or without steps (Button 4 and 5). So the thing should just be a question of software interpretation. At least it's a question of making steps smaller (1 pixel?) and enable acceleration, I think.\n\nA: This is currently the best solution I found, although I think at this time, its smooth scrolling feature is not yet useable. In future, native, driver-based solutions have to be made to support mice and touchpads which support smooth scrolling. Especially on a desktop system like Ubuntu.\nSolaar\nThere is an application called Solaar which offers many possibilities to unifying-devices from Logitech, like battery status, pairing options (awesome!) and smooth scrolling. Unfortunately, smooth scrolling does not work that great; it does not scroll as smoothly as on OS X, and it only scrolls the last active window, not the mouse-overed window (tested on 13.04). But it's in every way a useful application and its smooth scrolling feature is something I hope gets improved with future updates.\nHomepage: http://pwr.github.io/Solaar/\nInstallation\nOpen a Terminal via the Unity dash or CTRL+ALT+T and paste in the following lines:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:daniel.pavel/solaar\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install solaar\n\nUsage\n\n\n*\n\n*Start Solaar via the Unity dash, for example.\n\n*If you see a popup recommending to replug the unifying-receiver, do it.\n\n*There should appear a tray icon looking like a battery.

Somehow after upgrading to 12.04, my virtual machines always boot with an attempt to boot from the network first. See this:\n\nwhile I don't have any PXE configuration set:\n\nI've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*to disable SPICE, by changing the emulator to /usr/bin/kvm from /usr/bin/kvm-spice by editing the XML.\n\n*Ctrl+B to configure the iPXE, but it doesn't let disable this as a boot option.\n\n*setting another type of NIC - not an option, I need virtio for performance reasons. However, e1000e doesn't work either.\n\n*removing the NIC: works. However, I need network.\n\n*Googling around. Hard. Lots of result is about failing configured PXE boots.\n\n\nNot a big issue, but it increases boot times by 50-100% here (booting from SSD), so it's relatively long and annoys me.\nHow can I disable this and boot from virtual hard disk directly?\n\nA: Short answer\nUpgrade to libvirt 0.9.10+ (available in Quantal) and add the <rom bar='off'/> option to the interface configuration of the machine's XML definition.\nLong answer\nNow that I'm actually using the iPXE boot option I see that the delay occurring in the SeaBIOS screen is not an actual boot attempt. It's just loading the Virtio network option ROM and that takes a few annoying seconds, i.e. it's not yet doing an iPXE boot attempt. This lead me to read the libvirt documentation again, and I made an interesting discovery.\nAs far as I could find, since libvirt 0.9.7 the behaviour has changed to load interface's option ROMs by default. Ubuntu 11.10 shipped with 0.9.2, Ubuntu 12.04 comes with 0.9.8. This definitely makes sense as to why I see this happening since the upgrade to 12.04.\nMoreover, this has become configurable in libvirt version 0.9.10 with the <rom bar='off'/> option in the XML! (see here) However, that version of libvirt is not available in Ubuntu 12.04 and I'll have to upgrade to 12.10 or backport it. This makes Ubuntu 12.04 fall between two stools. \nOther workarounds are removing the option ROM files as pointed out by @A.H.' and changing the SeaBIOS 'filesystem' as pointed out by @NlightNFotis. However, both ways will basically disable iPXE completely and it's not configurable (if sticking to virtio network devices only). As I have a mixed setup of iPXE machines and non-PXE machines, I really need this to be configurable.\n\nA: My experiments on the same issue gave me some hints:\nThe package kvm-ipxe installs several PXE option ROMs into /usr/share/qemu/: \npxe-e1000.rom\npxe-ne2k_isa.rom\npxe-pcnet32.rom\npxe-rtl8139.rom\npxe-virtio.rom\n\nSomehow these are automatically found and used by seabios when booting with one of these NICs. When I do a chmod a= pxe*.rom on these files and start the virtual machine I get the \"error\" message\nkvm: pci_add_option_rom: failed to find romfile \"pxe-rtl8139.rom\"\n\nbut it boots cleanly and without PXE.\n\nA: I was able to get around this in Ubuntu 12.04 by passing the following options to qemu-kvm on the command-line (setting the romfile to blank is the trick):\n-netdev user,id=hostnet0 -device virtio-net-pci,romfile=,netdev=hostnet0\n\n\nA: I was able to prevent this using \"-net none\":\n# qemu-system-i386 -net none\n\n\nA: From your pictures, I can see that most likely it has to do with the VM BIOS. The VM configuration must not overwrite SeaBIOS' settings, something which must be causing the VM to boot from PXE first.\nFor a first possible solution, try to see if you can enter the Virtual Machine's BIOS and edit the options prevalent there.\nNOTE: Will continue to update the answer while my research unveils more possible solutions or causes.\n[EDIT #1]: You can find information on how to set up the boot order in SeaBIOS here. That should solve the problem.\n", "Q: Can't adjust the brightness on a Toshiba C665 laptop I had installed Ubuntu 12.04 i my Toshiba Laptop Satellite C665-I5011 \nIn this I am not able to change the LCD brightness.

I have set up ldap on my local network following the Ubuntu Manual. \nFor some reason (after ldap setup, not before), it seems to have made a root entity in my ldap tree, which now allows for the availability of root logins. Why? I thought Ubuntu's whole deal was avoiding having a actual root login?\nI found it very surprising when I went to work and tried to ssh into my home machine with the root account and supplying it a password worked.\n\nA: To ensure that you really talking about root check the uid of the account.\nAfter login invoke id. The output should be:\nuid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)\n\nroot is just a name, the special rights belong to the uid 0.\nIf you have a 2nd account root with a \"normal\" uid different from 0 delete this bogus account.\nIf your root account has the uid 0 ensure that the sshd configuration deny root login.\nEnsure that /etc/ssh/sshd_config include the setting:\nPermitRootLogin no\n\nNote: Ubuntu has surely a root account.

Is it possible to extend thunderbird mail box size. My thunderbird mailbox size has touched the maximum and it is not able to receive new mails. I just want to know if it is possible to extend or we have to create a new mail box? What would be the best solution? Pls share your suggestions and fix as well.\nDetails:\n\n*\n\n*Am using Thunderbird 14.0\n\n*Inbox size is of 4.1 GB only.\n\n\n\nA: Making my answer more formal:\n\"Ubuntu file size limitations are dependent on the file system being used, but generally start at 2 terabytes.\"\nIf you are actually using that, you could try compressing it. Also you could move your mail to other folders, organize it, and then run the compaction on it again.\nShould help you.\nhttps://support.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/kb/compact-inbox-or-other-folder\n\nA: Grabbed from here\nReal fix\nIf the folder is severely corrupted, deleting the .msf file won't help much, and compacting the folder may just make things worse because Thunderbird can't reliably figure out where a message ends anymore. You'll typically run into this only with the Inbox folder. It's much more vulnerable to corruption because it frequently has both lots of messages and a high percentage of deleted (but not visible) messages. That's why it's recommended that you move messages you want to keep to other folders/child folders rather than keep storing them in the Inbox. You can fix the problem by replacing the corrupt folder with a new known good folder. These instructions assume the Inbox folder is corrupt but you can adapt them for any folder.\n\n\n*\n\n*Exit Thunderbird and backup your profile folder using something like MozBackup.\n\n*Start Thunderbird.\n\n*Move all of the messages in the Inbox to other folders/child folders. You can select all of the messages using Control-A. If you have problems moving all of the messages, do it in multiple steps, where you select only a few messages each time.\n\n*Verify that all of the messages have been moved.\n\n*Exit Thunderbird and delete BOTH the \"inbox.\" and \"inbox.msf\" files for that account. Leave \"Inbox.sbd\" alone. You can find where the Inbox folder is stored by looking at Tools -> Account Settings -> Server Settings -> Local Directory, or Tools -> Account Settings -> Local Folders -> Local Directory if you are using a Global Inbox. Its at the bottom of that pane, next to a Browse button.\n\n*Start Thunderbird. It will automatically create a new Inbox folder.\nWhile its possible to move the messages back to the (new) Inbox, its recommended you don't do that.\n\n", "Q: How to use xdg-desktop-icon? I am on Ubuntu 12.04 with KDE.

(Success.) But... I do not see any new icons on my desktop. Also not after reboot. How to use the xdg-desktop-icon tool correctly?\n\nA: This is perhaps on what is expected as a desktop icon. The answer for me was to install the menu:\n$ xdg-desktop-menu install --novendor test.desktop\n\nOnly after that xdg-desktop-menu command (and not the -icon command) the .desktop program appeared when searching it in the dash (a.k.a. the menu).\nA reboot was not necessary.\nTested on Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS.\n", "Q: Password problem after creating a new user  I created a new user account and when I try to login to that account by switching accounts it said wrong password.

It's saying there's no password set but when I'm clicking it it's asking for old password.\n\n\nA: I would suggest taking NlightNFotis' advice: open a terminal and type \nsudo passwd <user>\n\n", "Q: chmod u+s in /var/www i have a problem at granting the right rights for the right user...\ni want to run pootle with apache, so i downloaded pootle. Then i copied it to /var/www, installed it and gave the www-data user rights for the whole folder. As far as good... now i want to copy the translated files from and to the translation-directory (e.g. /var/www/pootle/po/project).\nSo i created a group (www) added me to the group and executed\n\nsudo chown -R :www /var/www/pootle\n\nok, so now i have rights to write files into the directory, however, when apache creates a file, its group is www-data...\n\nsudo chmod -R g+s /var/www/pootle\n\nok, now the group is always \"www\", as i wanted it to be... now here is the problem:\nWhen i write files to /var/www/pootle they are there, however, with my user as owner, and not, as i awaited, as www-data, although i executed the command:\n\nsudo chmod -R u+s /var/www/pootle\n\nis there a way that i can say that the user who created the file, even if its me, shall be www-data?\nthx in advance :)\n\nA: If you run chown without a preceding colon, you will change the owner. (With the preceding colon, you change the group, as you have demonstrated above, and you can also run chown -R new-owner:newgroup.) So if you just run\nsudo chown -R www-data /var/www/pootle\n\nyou will change the owner to www-data.\n\n\"....when apache creates a file, its group is www-data...\"\n\nCan you clarify what you mean by this? Apache serves files, it doesn't create them. PHP creates them - but they are created dynamically and served directly to web clients (browsers), they are not created and then saved by Apache.\nIt seems your problem is with file ownership. If so, a  more convenient approach might be to add pootle to the www group - as Apache (generally) needs htm(l) files to be owned by www to read them. Files then created by Pootle will have the same group ID and you won't need to run chown at all - Apache will have read access to Pootle's files. See http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/pootle/apache which says:\n You need to extract Pootle in a directory accessible to the apache user.\n\nMake sure Apache has read access to all of Pootle's files and write access to the dbs and po subdirectories.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Would it not be better to go:\nchown -R greenit:www-data /var/www/\nchmod -R 770 /var/www/pootle\n\nI would not recommend the next bit (you should ideally manually chmod or chown files you create yourself), but you could add yourself to the www-data group:\nusermod -a -G www-data greenit\n\nHowever, the ideal thing would be to find the setting in Pootle that specifies what user to run as, and change that to www-data.\n", "Q: ubuntu-overlay-scrollbars set to false shows no arrows in several cases I'm running 12.04, and prefer the more conservative style \"normal\" scrollbars over the overlay scrollbars. I have set them to false in the terminal:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface ubuntu-overlay-scrollbars false\n\nHowever after doing so, with some apps (e.g. Nautilus, Document Viewer) my scrollbars only view a vertical bar, but no arrows on the top and bottom to scroll up and down.\nWith some programs these are shown though, for instance Gummi and Texmaker.\nIt would make a big difference (for instance when having to scroll pdf documents containing several hundreds of pages) to have those arrows reinstated. Is there any way to make this work?\n\nA: You could try the methods outlined by Webupd8.\nMy favorite is the uninstallation option:\nsudo apt-get remove overlay-scrollbar liboverlay-scrollbar-0.2-0 liboverlay-scrollbar3-0.2-0\n\nBear in mind that Webupd8 says that this may cause dependency issues with metapackages, although in practice I haven't had this issue with 12.04.  If you do have dependency issues, I would advise against removing any metapackages and instead recommend that you use one of the other methods.\n", "Q: Is legal/ethical to obtain upload rigths to the Ubuntu archives to fund a support company? I live in Mexico city and in the time I've been involved with Ubuntu I've not seen any local company that offer professional support for Ubuntu.\nIs legal/ethical to try to obtain permissions to the Ubuntu archive to provide a better support service?, I have a friend who's trying to obtain upload rights to Debian too. \nThe idea is that we could provide a more close to Ubuntu/Canonical support for our future customers, however I'm not sure if that would be right.\n\nA: I believe ethically there is nothing wrong in your approach; you are simply attempting to be seen as a support partner. As to legality, if you were accepted as a support partner, you would be bound by their terms and conditions and that would therefore also state what permissions you would have (and thus how \"legal\" your work was.\nThe ethical and legal implications are essentially moot, what matters is whether Canonical accepts your application.

My question is a little bit different from others already asked, I guess. I've already searched for answers, but I didn't find anything related.\nFor example, I've always installed K3B via Terminal with the following command \"sudo apt-get install k3b\". It always worked, of course. One day, I decided to install it via Ubuntu Sofware Center and, to my surprise, there were a few Add-ons I didn't know about. I checked some of them to be installed as well because I found them useful.\nNow, here's my question: When we try to install a software via Terminal and this software has add-ons, how do we know that? And how do we install the add-ons via Terminal?\nI suppose we have to know the names of the add-ons first, and then install them one by one, once the main software has already been installed. But how do we get to know those names via Terminal? Using the Software Center is cool because it shows the add-ons, a brief description for each one and their names in brackets, right? How about that via Terminal?\nI had never paid attention to this until I used the Software Center. By the way, K3B was just an example, of course.\n\nA: Those addons are suggested packages which are meant to enhance your experience with k3b. But those are not essentials for k3b to work properly.\nIn terminal, you can know the add-on names (at least some of those) by using apt-cache depends k3b command. The add-on names will be shown under \"Suggest:\" section. For example:\napt-cache depends k3b | grep Suggests\nk3b\n  Suggests: k3b-extrathemes\n  Suggests: normalize-audio\n  Suggests: sox\n  Suggests: movixmaker-2\n  Suggests: libk3b6-extracodecs\n  Suggests: vcdimager\n\nPlease note that, suggested packages are not essentials. Also note, apt-get will install packages which are essential to run k3b (called dependency) and those packages which are recommended.\nYou may want to visit these link to get some info about this topic:\n\n*\n\n*Recommended and Suggested packages, Debian Faq\n\n*Debian policy, Debian Handbook\nAlso check this question on Superuser.com\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between recommended and suggested packages\nAs a summary:\n\n*\n\n*A depends packages in one, which is required to run the software\n\n*A recommended package in one, which is required for the software to be functional.\n\n*A suggested package in one, which can enhance the usability of the software.\n\nNote, Ubuntu install first two category of the software by default from both Software Center and from terminal. So, you are not loosing anything essential. But still you can install them. Also note, Software Center does not install them automatically.\nTo install suggested packages also from terminal\nIf you want to install suggested packages from terminal, you can use this command\n sudo apt-get --install-suggests install k3b\n\nThis command will install all the suggested packages as well as dependency and recommended packages.\nTo permanently configure apt to install suggested packages\nIf you want to configure apt-get permanently to automatically install suggested packages also, You can do this:\n\n*\n\n*Create a file in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d with name 99mysettings\n gksu gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99mysettings\n\n\n\n*Then add the configuration option in that file\n APT::Install-Suggests \"true\";     \n\n\n\n*Then save the file and exit gedit.\nFrom now, the suggested packages will also get installed automatically by apt-get.\nPlease note that, apt-get will only install those packages if it finds them in any repositories, Otherwise, it simply ignores them and proceed with installation.\n\nA: When you install a program through the terminal it will also tell you suggested packages (add-ons, etc). i.e.:\nsudo apt-get install k3b\nReading package lists...

Our five-year-old girl is enjoying Ubuntu at the moment - there are some great educational and entertainment applications available for kids. But a problem I have is that as she learns to use the mouse she has discovered the network-manager menu. As she is also learning to read at the moment, she is paying attention to new words. There is some pretty offensive stuff popping up from time-to-time and I would like a way to either:\na) Block one specific offensive SSID from appearing on the list of available (but secured) networks\nb) Automatically block any offensive entries by keyword.\nEventually, I think Ubuntu could really use something like this but in the mean-time - does anyone know how I could best achieve this effect without uninstalling network-manager?\n\nA: You can refer to this question about hiding the network manager: Show/Hide either top panel or NetworkManager Applet from command line\nMove the following file : /etc/xdg/autostart/nm-applet.desktop\n\nA: If your doughter users a separate user account, it would be possible to auto-kill the network manager applet only when she loggs in.

One way to quickly check to see if one of your plugins is problematic is to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rename “plugins” folder temporarily to something else.\n          Wordpress will automatically disable all the plugins.\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable all your plugins at once\n          Wordpress will enable only those plugins that don't crash and will disable any plugins that produce fatal errors.\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable plugins one at a time\n          Alternatively, you can enable one plugin at a time and observe which one leads to the crash.\nOnce you identify the problematic plugin or plugins, see if they have been updated. If they have, delete the ones on your server and replace with the newer versions. Hopefully that will work. Otherwise, just leave the bad plugins de-activated until they are updated.\n2.

The drive works fine on most laptops/computers I try: It does not want to start on my (favourite) Acer Aspire 5745 (Windows 7 64 bit). The opening screen has SYSLINUX 4.06 EDD 4.06-pre1 (...) and simply sits there. I was using Ubuntu 12.04.1 64 bit until I tried booting to the Acer this morning. I've tried booting to 10.04 as well (saw this as a fix on a discussion) with the same result.\nI really want to use the Acer for development and do not want to wipe my Windows 7 from the hard disk.\nAre there any solutions/answers?\nI was using a 16 GB Cruzer drive (I was \"playing\" until the two 32 GB Kingston drives arrived this morning from Staples). Although Cruzer drive worked fine on other laptops it did not want to work on the Acer. I formatted one of the 32 GB Kingston's and it fired up immediately. Lesson learned for the other poor souls I saw with the same issue. Thank you for the quick reply and tell your friends about the solution. Baffled me for a bit...\n\nA: Late getting around to writing this one up.\nPreamble\nThe problem appears to be an inconsistent partition table, often found on factory formatted USB thumb drives.  Something about the partition table makes it unsuitable to make a liveUSB.  \nThe Problem\nMy research into this seems to suggest the problem stems from a partition table written in a DOS 6.x format, a known buggy implementation. Here's explanation from the Linux cfdisk manual page (cfdisk is a text based utility for manipulating disk partition tables):\n\nDOS 6.x WARNING\n   The DOS 6.x FORMAT command looks for some information in the first sec‐\n   tor of the data area of the partition, and treats this  information  as\n   more  reliable than the information in the partition table.  DOS FORMAT\n   expects DOS FDISK to clear the first 512 bytes of the data  area  of  a\n   partition  whenever a size change occurs.  DOS FORMAT will look at this\n   extra information even if the /U flag is given -- we  consider  this  a\n   bug in DOS FORMAT and DOS FDISK.\n\n\nManifestations of this problem will often include some or all of the following symptoms:\n\n\n*\n\n*Testdisk and similar programs will identify the partition table as being made by DOS 5.x\n\n*The boot disk creator in Ubuntu will often refuse to use the USB thumbdrive because it can't find a valid partition table the error message does not state this clearly however. \n\n*Disk utility and Gparted can not delete the partition table because they don't recognise that there is one.  Conversely they can't make a partion table either, because they also recognise that there is something there.\n\n*Running fdisk -l on the thumbdrive will often declare that it has no partition table, even though you know there is one and can write data to it if it is still mounting OK.\n\n*Attempts to use the drive and put an ext type partition table on it if successful can sometimes result in inconsistencies - the drive can fail to work on other machines, or suddenly fail to mount on the machine it was formatted on.  These appears to be 'dead' USB thumbdrives as the device is firmware is recognised but it fails to mount and the partition table can not be read at all.  I suspect a few fairly new thumbdrives have been thrown away, including one of mine before I figured out what the problem was.\n\n\nAffected devices\nDevices that I know from personal experience that have this problem:\nVerbatim white 'Stor N Go' 4 and 8 GB devices \nMany Kingston 4Gb devices\nWoolworths \"essentials\" 4GB devices\nCommon factors with all of these devices is often that they claim Linux OS compatibility, and that they often include some Windows backup software for synchonising Windows data folders.\nI don't know why USB thumbdrive manufacturers are supplying devices with what appears to be a partition table format that had problems when it was released.  Any later format would probably work without any problems whatsoever, even though it might not be perfect by todays standards.\nThe Solution\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=512 count=1\n\nThis little line of code simply writes zeros over the top of the partition table on the device /dev/sdX\nYou will need to change sdX to the correct device for your faulty USB pendrive.  \nWarning: Using the incorrect device name will completely delete the partition table from whatever device you point it at - hard drive, external backup drive, anything.  This will result in the deletion of any and all partitions that might be on the drive, and cause you a great deal of grief if you don't have all your important data backed up.  You Have Been Warned\nOnce the partition table has been erased you will have to use a program like gparted to create a new one, and to add 1 or more partitions so that the device can be used.  In my experience this fix is fast, simple, and permanent.  I usually do it on all new USB pendrive devices that I purchase.\nIt's also possible use Linux command line utilities such as fdisk and extfs to create a new partition table.  I shall add some details on this as time allows.\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*Wikipedia\n\n*cfdisk manpage\n\nA: Another cause of this problem can apparently be the current going to the device. For me, like the common upvoted comment on the accepted answer, any command gave no medium found as output.\nI found this information here.\nSwitching to another USB port may help.\n", "Q: Can someone help me install wine?

I have an email account that has passed 60GB of emails, and currently I'm having a lot of trouble using an email client to archive emails of last year (2011).\nVia terminal, I am trying to use find to locate the files between 2011-01-01 and 2011-12-31, but no avail.\nHow can I find files between two dates?\nIf relevant, the end goal will be a batch that will move each file found, matching the date interval, to a folder.\n\nA: Bash find files between two dates:\nTested on GNU findutils 4.9.0 source via: https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/\nfind . -type f -newermt 2010-10-07 ! -newermt 2014-10-08\n\nReturns a list of files that have timestamps after 2010-10-07 and before 2014-10-08\nBash find files from 15 minutes ago until now:\nfind . -type f -mmin -15\n\nReturns a list of files that have timestamps after 15 minutes ago but before now.\nBash find files between two timestamps:\nfind . -type f -newermt \"2014-10-08 10:17:00\" ! -newermt \"2014-10-08 10:53:00\"\n\nReturns files with timestamps between 2014-10-08 10:17:00 and 2014-10-08 10:53:00\n\nA: You can use this script:\n#!/bin/bash\nfor i in $(find Your_Mail_Dir/ -newermt \"2011-01-01\" ! -newermt \"2011-12-31\"); do\n  mv $i /moved_emails_dir/\ndone\n\n\nA: Moving the files, and prompting the user when there are duplicate names:\nAs Subv3rsion's and Eric Leschinski's answers show, the -newermt predicate selects files modified more recently than the date (and optional time) specified as its operand. To find files\n\n*\n\n*anywhere in srcdir (i.e., including its subdirectories, their subdirectories, etc.)\n\n*last modified in (for example) September 2014\n\n*and move them to destdir\n...you can run:\nfind srcdir -type f -newermt 2014-08-31 ! -newermt 2014-09-30 -exec mv -i {} destdir/ \\;\nIn an -exec expression, find passes the filename found in place of {}. ; signifies to -exec that the command to be run, and its arguments, have all been provided (in case subsequent expressions are passed to find after that particular -exec predicate's arguments--see below for an example of this). ; must be escaped as \\; so it's not interpreted specially by the shell. (Without \\, ; would end the whole find command, working the same as a newline. Even though this find command has nothing after this -exec expression, failing to pass the ; argument is still a syntax error.)\nIf you just want to list the files--which is advisable if you're not sure how the old emails are stored or what other files may be present--omit -exec and everything to the right of it. (For email, often emails from different dates are stored in the same file; for someone in the situation described in the question here, I recommend investigating how they are stored before moving any files.) If you want to both print their names and move them, add -print before -exec.\nmv -i prompts anytime a file would be overwritten at the destination, such as would happen if:\n\n*\n\n*a file of the same name exists from a previous backup, or\n\n*a file of the same name but from a different subdirectory of srcdir has already been moved during the same find operation, or\n\n*(least likely) a file of the same name was created somewhere in srcdir during the same find operation, after the original was moved but soon enough to be found once find traverses a different subdirectory.\n\nOther ways to invoke mv:\nYou have other options for how to handle files with duplicate names.\n\n*\n\n*Without -i (i.e., mv {} destdir/), mv would not usually prompt for approval, but would do so if the destination file were read-only. (mv can even succeed at overwriting a read-only file sometimes, such as if the user running it owns the file.)\n\n*If you don't want even that degree of interactivity, and want mv always to  (attempt to) overwrite identically named files, use mv -f.\n\n*If, in contrast, you want to skip source files when there is already a destination file of the same name, use mv -n.\n\n*mv accepts the -b and --backup flags to automatically rename identically named files that already exist at the destination. By default ~ is added to produce the backup name, and if a file with the name and a file with the backup name already exist at the destination, the backup file is overwritten. This default can be overridden by options passed when invoking mv, and by environment variables. See man mv for details, and the example below.\n\nMoving the files and creating backups in case of duplicate names:\nTo move all files, back up files with duplicate names using a ~ suffix, and use numbered .~n~ suffixes when .~ files already exist (so as to avoid overwriting anything), run:\nfind srcdir -type f -newermt 2014-08-31 ! -newermt 2014-09-30 -exec mv --backup=existing {} destdir/ \\;\nIf you skipped files with duplicate names and want to know which ones:\nIf you use mv -n and want to know which files were not moved because there was another file with the same name, the best way is probably just to run the original find command again, without -exec and everything to the right of it. This will print their names.\nIt will also print the names of any matching files created since you ran the original find .... -exec ... command, but for this application there will typically be none since you're looking for files with old modification times. It's possible to give a file a modification timestamp older than its real age, with touch and other mechanisms, but that doesn't seem likely to occur in this case without your knowledge.\nKnowing immediately as files are skipped due to duplicate names:\nmv -n doesn't report, nor return any special exit code, when it refrains from moving a file. So if you want to be immediately informed of skipped files while find runs, you'll have to make a separate step for that. One way is:\nfind srcdir -type f -newermt 2014-08-31 ! -newermt 2014-09-30 -exec mv -n {} destdir/ \\; \\\n    -exec [ -f {} ] \\; -exec printf \"\\`%s' skipped (exists in \\`%s')\\\\n\" {} destdir \\; \nA few probably minor technical considerations: This warns incorrectly if mv fails to copy a file for a different reason than it existing at the destination and exits reporting success. That seems unlikely, but I'm not certain it's impossible. It also potentially suffers a race condition: it would warn when there is no real error at all, if a new file of the same name were created in the same place during the very short time after the old file was moved and before the check to see if it was removed. (Considering the application, I doubt either problem would ever actually occur.) It could be rewritten to check the destination before moving the file instead of after: then the race condition would relate to newly created destination files instead of source files. And while errors and warnings reported by find or mv (or [, though there shouldn't be any) will be written to standard error, our ...skipped (exists in... warning gets written to standard output. Normally both appear on your terminal, but this may matter if you're scripting.\nI've split that command onto two lines for easier reading. It can be run that way, or you can remove the \\ and the newline (i.e., the line break).\nHow does that find command work?\nfind predicates can be tests (like -type and -newermt), used for their return values, or actions (like -print and -exec), which are often used for their side effects.\nWhen no operator (like -a for and, -o for or) is supplied between expressions, -a is implied. find employs short-circuit evaluation for and and or. p q (i.e., p -a q) is true only if the p and q expressions are both true, so q needn't be evaluated if p is false. Though we often don't think of it in these terms, this is why tests have to be true for subsequent actions or tests to be evaluated. For example, suppose find comes upon a directory. It evaluates -type f to false, so it can skip everything afterwards.\nLike tests, actions evaluate to true or false as well. In this way, -exec reports if the executed command exited reporting success (true) or failure (false). We have this chain of -exec expressions connected with implicit and:\n-exec mv -n {} destdir/ \\; -exec [ -f {} ] \\; -exec printf \"\\`%s' skipped (exists in \\`%s')\\\\n\" {} destdir \\;\nThis tries to move the file, and if mv reports failure, stops. We don't want to warn about a correctly skipped file if some other problem was why it wasn't moved.\nBut if it succeeded, it then runs the [ command. Like find, [ supports its own kind of expressions passed as arguments. [ -f {} ] checks if the operand after -f (passed to it by find in place of {}) exists (and is a regular file), and returns either true/success or false/failure.\n(Many commands' exit statuses are best interpreted as signifying success or failure, but ['s exist status is usually best interpreted as true or false.)\nIf [ returned false, then the file is gone, so it was moved, so there's no need to do anything. But if [ returned false, the file is still there. Then find evaluates the next -exec expression, which prints the warning message.\nFurther Reading\n\n*\n\n*man find and the GNU Findutils reference manual\n\n*man mv and the GNU Coreutils reference manual (especially 11.4 mv: Move (rename) files)\n\n*man \\[ and 16.3 test: Check file types and compare values in the Coreutils docs\nThis (i.e., /usr/bin/[), and not the shell's [ builtin, is what find runs when you use -exec [.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu failed, now i have just a command line Last night I tried to install Ubuntu 12.04 from a USB (for which I had to use Bootice on Windows XP to install PLoP Boot Manager on the MDR, since I was unable to boot from USB and have no CD Rom).

I can make deb packages on my PC, and also Launchpad is able to make binary packages for 32-bit OS. \nI noticed a strange behavior of Launchpad. It makes both development (libfoo-dev) and shared library (libfoo) from the uploaded source code for i386 although it makes only binary package for amd64 from same code. Looking at i386 and amd64 build logs, I found that for amd64 debian/rules binary-arch is called instead of debian/rules binary. This causes my source not to generate a development package for amd64.\nHow can I solve this issue? Build logs and package sources are available in ppa:soroush-r/geopsy-deb in case you want to take a look.\n\nA: Architecture independent packages (where Architecture: all is set in debian/control) are only build on one architecture, which is i386 for Ubuntu. Only the architecture depending packages are build on all other architectures. That's why debian/rules binary is called on i386, but debian/rules binary-arch on amd64, armhf, and powerpc.\nYou set Architecture: all for your -dev packages. This is correct if the -dev package is identical on every architecture. You will see that the .deb package will end with _all.deb instead of _amd64.deb or _i386.deb. The _all.deb will be build on i386, but also used on amd64.\nYou should change the architecture of the -dev package to Architecture: any in debian/control if you need different content for the amd64 -dev package. If the -dev package should have the identical content on amd64 than on i386, everything is working correctly and you shouldn't encounter a problem.\n", "Q: how to setup nouveau driver at boot time in ubuntu 12.04?

You said \"Windows installer\" and \"select Ubuntu\", so it sounds like you're using the Wubi installer. Wubi is a great way to get started with Ubuntu, but I've experienced problem installs with it. The best thing to do since you're just getting started is to re-install.\nIMPORTANT: Use Add/Remove Programs to delete the Wubi install. If you just delete the Ubuntu folder, you may not be able to boot the machine. If that happens, don't panic since it's easy to fix. See http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/20340/how-to-restore-the-wubi-ubuntu-bootloader/\nBe sure you're using the same version (32 vs 64 bit) verion of Ubuntu that you have for Windows. Another problem with long-term use of Wubi is that the Ubuntu image is subject to fragmentation. It's easy to install (and remove if needed) Ubuntu into a partition alongside Windows. This is built into the Ubuntu installer and is self-explanatory. If you haven't defragged your Windows drive much, you may want to use the free (as in beer) MyDefrag to do that before installing Ubuntu, but it's not strictly needed. \n", "Q: How do I keep track of modifications to a new server? I purchased a server for the sole purpose of familiarizing myself with the CLI so I don't get royally screwed when I enter a real development environment. However, I have some questions.  \nI've managed to SSH into my server, all is fine and dandy, installed LAMP too which went flawlessly. Now I'm wondering, the more changes I do, the more cluttered my server will become. Can I revert changes? I don't want to keep customizing things and installing things and just having a cluttered server overall. Where can I track changes to my system?\n\nA: A couple of suggestions. I do the first for my home computers and another for a server I help out with. All but the first and last numbered item below are related to taking backups or snapshots of where you are at a particular point in time.\n\n\n*\n\n*Whenever I install a new release I keep notes in the cloud about what I did and what packages I installed (and obviously look at the last set of notes).\n\n*The server uses remarkably little disk space so I make more frequent backups when I'm busy making changes. This link has an approach similar to what I use. The basic approach has the advantage that it only uses disk space for changed files in the backups.\n\n*A general approach to take. You can, and should, use a revision control system like bazaar or git with directory trees of your own that you are updating. I don't think this would work with /etc or other system directory trees, however.\nSome ideas I haven't tried, the first two for taking snapshots of changes from all sources for your system:\n\n\n*\n\n*The LVM storage approach allows you to take live snapshots of disk storage at appropriate times.\n\n*Linux and Ubuntu support some change-on-write file systems that can also be used as a snapshot approach. In particular you can run virtualized servers against image files that support taking snapshots.\n\n*On a server you may be able to simplify the installation of services so there is less to remember or note by using Juju and Juju charms to install services.\nI assume that you know from your work so far that you can uninstall packages as easily as you can install them with apt-get, and that the purge option of apt-get can be used to remove those packages' configuration files. This askubuntu question contains a way to keep a list of the packages that are installed.\n", "Q: Problems reinstalling Windoxs XP instead Ubuntu I've installed Ubuntu in my netbook using all hard disk.

That starts running, but it is interrupted because \"it doesn't find any disk installed in my system\". It doesn't recognize my hard disk!

(How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?) \n\nI upgraded my laptop with an SSD, moving my old HDD to where the DVD-drive was, so that I could have speed and storage.\nNow, I have reinstalled Ubuntu on the SSD, deleting all the partitions on the old HDD to make space for a data partition. But now the laptop doesn't even get to GRUB 2 if the HDD is plugged in! If I take it out, everything works, but as soon as I plug it in and retry to boot, I won't find GRUB.\nAt first, I thought it was because of the boot order, but the order was OK: first the notebook hard drive (SSD) and then the CD/DVD drive (which in reality is the HDD).\nHow can I fix it?\nDoing a simple grub-install /dev/sda doesn't work..\nThe SSD is sda, and the HDD is sdb.\n\nA: The fact that the machine boots without the HDD plugged in suggests that GRUB is indeed installed correctly on your SSD and the problem is in the boot order, i.e. your HDD is probed first, BIOS finds (non-functional) GRUB there and passes control to it.\nPlease note that even if you installed the HDD into the bay where DVD drive used to be, it will still be seen as hard drive by BIOS. Some BIOSes have two separate menus for setting boot order - one where you choose between Hard Drive, CD/DVD and USB boot, and another separate menu where you can specify order of hard drives. \nI strongly suspect that you have Hard Drive on the top in the first menu, but in the second menu your HDD takes precedence over the SSD.\n\nIn the picture above, apart from making [Hard Drive] the Fist Boot Device, you also need to go into Hard Drive Boot Priority sub-menu and make sure your SSD takes priority over the HDD.\n\nA: I suggest you do a complete format to the HDD and then try again. It is possible that the partitions on the HDD still contain information that confuses the grub loader.\nIf that doesn't help you will HAVE to have the grub installed on the HDD, when both HDD and SSD are present (while the rest of the OS on the SSD). So, sudo grub-install /dev/sdb etc.\nIt is possible that although the SSD is sda and the HDD is sdb both are on the same SATA/IDE channel and the BIOS give priority by default to the HDD based on the device type.\nAnother option you can try is Grub Customizer first. It is a graphical tool for customizing grub. But since the grub itself is not the problem but getting to it is, it may be irrelevant. Here is the info anyway:\nInstallation of the graphical 'grub-customizer' tool:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\n\nA: Does the computer pass the boot-time hardware check when the HDD is plugged in?

I installed a fresh Ubuntu system.  Somehow - possibly through my own error - the backports repository got enabled.  Then I did several upgrades.  I noticed that this happened when networking suddenly stopped working, \"Network Settings\" now has an \"(alpha)\" in the title bar, \"System Settings\" → \"Network\" now displays an error dialog saying \"The system network services are not compatible with this version\".\nNow, I've disabled the backports repository, and I'd like to restore my system to its previously-functional state.  My question is twofold:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I determine which packages were installed from backports?\n\n*Can I automatically re-install all those packages (and purge their configuration) to get back to a sensible state?\n\n\nIf the answer to 2 is \"no\" I can probably manually purge some things and reinstall, but it would be nice to have it handled automatically.\nUpdate:\nIt wasn't an update that broke the network; it was apt-get install indicator-network, which installed something called \"connman\" and removed network-manager and network-manager-gnome.\nNevertheless I am leaving the question up, since I am still interested in how I can purge packages from a particular source after accidentally adding that source, and how I can determine which packages were installed from where.\n\nA: In case you've upgraded to Precise, it has the backport repository enabled by default, however, nothing should have been installed unless selected.\nFrom the Release Notes\n\nBackports are now more easily accessible -- to enable users to more easily receive new versions of software, the Ubuntu Backports repository is now enabled by default. Packages from backports will not be installed by default — they must explicitly be selected in package management software. However, once installed, packages from backports will automatically be upgraded to newer versions.\n\n", "Q: Need more RAM??

I have the same cam and it works out of the box with Chrome and with PulseAudio if you have sound issues. \n\nA: Before you're able to use your microphone and camera inputs in your browser, you need to explicitly allow it in the Flash Settings window. That, however, can turn out to be easier said than done, but I'll explain a workaround.\nOpen your browser, go to any page with Flash content. Right click on Flash content and select Settings from the menu. A small dialogue window will open, with tabs at the bottom. Click on the middle tab (third from left) which depicts a folder and a green arrow. Now, click on the 'Allow' option, with the green check icon. Finally, click Close button.\nThis won't work, if, after selecting 'Settings' from the drop-down menu Flash refuses to accept mouse clicks. Basically, you can't do anything else in that dialogue but stare at it. If that happens to you, here's what you can do. Log out from your account, then log in to Unity 2D. Do the same process under Unity 2D, then log out and log back in to Unity 3D.\n\nA: I used my webcam in the browser, when I was taking a coursera signature track course.

This is the file that handles automatically mounting drives. If you have no credentials set and don't care about security, you would need to add a line like this:\n//fileservername/path  /media/fileshare  cifs  username=guest,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777,nobootwait   0   0\n\nReplace fileservername/path with the hostname (or IP address) of the PC that is sharing the files, and the share name. /media/fileshare is where you want to mount the share locally. This directory must already exist. When you need to re-mount this drive, say after a connection loss, etc. use the following:\nsudo mount -a\n\nThat will attempt to remount any filesystems mentioned in fstab.\n", "Q: I continue to get this when trying to log into ubuntu one from the ubuntu desktop \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to recover/reset forgotten Gnome Keyring Password? \n\n **Enter password to unlock your login keyring**\n\nThe password that you use to log into your computer is no longer matches your log in keyring.\n\nA: Click Applications\nClick Accessories\nClick Passwords and Encryption Keys\n-or-\nPress ALT+F2\nThen type in seahorse\n-then-\nRight click Passwords: login\nSelect Change Password\n-then-\nChange the password to blank.

So, may be the problem is with LibreOffice.\nVery surprising and irritating issue indeed.\n\nA: I've found a solution for this problem. To do that you have to paste the fonts in the directory\n~/.local/share/fonts\n\nIt's important to mention here that, normally, you can't see the folders which started with a dot(.)(in ubuntu folders started with . are hidden folders).

I asked this question:\nAre Virus/rootkits via Ubuntu updates possible? [closed]\nIt was closed as a duplicate, but the supposed duplicates cover some quite different topics (like how cd/flashdrive autorun etc affects safety etc.). So I've reposted my specific question. How is the update process secured against a man in the middle attack?\nI feel this question is not really covered by:\n\n\n*\n\n*How is the system kept secure? (covers more the aspect of gaining root access)\n\n*What security policies exist in place for packages and scripts? (covers the aspect of deb safety files being autorun)\n\nA: Debian (antecedent of Ubuntu) already introduced SecureApt or apt-secure and Ubuntu implements this. As far as I understand, this SecureApt is a way to ensure package integrity using md5sum checking.\nWhen apt-get update is run a file called packages.gz that contains md5sum hashes of packages in the repository is downloaded (securely??) and then when installing a package from the repo the downloaded package is md5sum checked against the packages.gz md5sum and installed only if it matches. \nTherefore tampering or manipulation of a packaged should result in a \"no match\" md5sum comparison.\nThis does not explain how packages updates which cannot be known at the time of system install or \"package.gz\" file transmission will be verified, however.\nUpdate \nI found some more information here in the Ubuntu help page on SecureApt:\nAbout the updated process and its safety/security implications:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is a release file which contains the md5sums of packages (maybe this file is or contains the packages.gz mentioned earlier). \n\n*This release file is transmitted rather safely by using gpg key signing. \n\n*The release file is updated each time packages are updated. This explains how updates will be possible safely. (1. gpg signed release file transmitted with md5hashes of packages, 2.

Unlike what was suggested in a deleted comment, metacity is not responsible for Compiz window decoration, but a Compiz plugin called aptly \"Decorations\".\nIf, however, you log in using the \"Unity 2D\" option, you will be using a different window manager, called metacity.\n", "Q: Downloading takes hours: I have downloaded \"ubuntu-12.04.1-desktop-i386.iso\" and extracted it using magic ISO. There is a file wubi.exe is the extracted folder. To install ubuntu i double clicked it ( i am using windows 7); it asks the isntallaton folder and asks to create username and password. Then straight away it says it is downloading \"ubuntu-12.04.1-wubi-i386.tar.xz\". It it shows nearly seven hours of downloading time remaining (i have a slow internet connection). Can't i install ubuntu offline?\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: Since you already have the iso (you didn't have to, the wubi.exe installer can be downloaded independently), there is no need to download the installation package again.\nJust place the iso image in the same folder where the wubi.exe file is; start wubi.exe -- it should detect the iso file and run the installation offline. More on that here.\nAlternatively, you can use the iso to install Ubuntu on a separate partition.\n\nA: If you want to do a full install you will need to burn the iso to a CD and start your computer from it.

Would appreciate some direction.\nI recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. The OS is on a disk formatted as ext4. I added another disk to the system and formatted it as W95 FAT 32 (LBA) (0x0c). I did this because I am moving from Windows to Linux, will be needing to go back and forth with data for a while, and might need to move the disk to a Windows machine. There may have been a better format to use, but if so I didn't know any better.\nI was able to transfer data from an external drive to this FAT32 drive with no problem. Now, though, when I try to create a new folder or write a file to the disk I get a message that the disk is read-only.\nIf I go to the properties, permissions for the disk, for Folder Access it says 'create and delete files'. If I try to change File Access underneath to 'read and write', either nothing happens or I get a message it can't be done. \nThank you for any help.\n\nA: It's better to use ntfs than fat32 on modern linux distros.  \nI suspect your user isn't part of the fuse group, and it's getting automounted by fuse or similar. \nsometimes this type of error happens when you try to use non-default auto-login stuff like using the nopasswdlogin group\n", "Q: Virtualbox windows 7 guest - pressing windows key launches unity menu Running win7 as guest in full screen mode.

After setting, it should make unnamed and * registers same? \n\n\nA: *\n\n*Linux has two clipboards (called \"primary buffer\" and \"secondary buffer\"). One is used for mouse copy/paste and another is for Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V. So, if you select something (say, in order to delete it) the contents of what you put in clipboard using Ctrl-C are still there intact.\n\n*If you want to copy without yanking try to select your text desired to copy and press CTRL+SHIFT+C then CTRL+SHIFT+V to copy/paste it\nI hope this would help\n\nA: By default, the clipboard gets filled only if you do visual selection (using v, or, equivalently, your mouse). (In all the following, we are talking about the \"old\" X clipboard, the primary buffer). To affect the clipboard using \"y\" even without visual selection, you need to :set clipboard=unnamed. I do not know why, in your first example, the xclip -o shows no contents; it should. I have a hypothesis about that, however, see below.\nI have 10.04. I start vim.\n:set clipboard\nclipboard=autoselect,exclude:cons\\|linux\n\nI type some random text:\nasd fa sdf\nasdf\n\nNow I do ggVGy. In another terminal window, I type\nxclip -o\n\nxclip shows me, correctly, the contents of the file. I can paste it wherever with the middle mouse button, for example here:\nasd fa sdf\nasdf\n\nSame if I just start visual selection with \"v\", move around, and yank with \"y\".\nHowever, if I do \"yy\" (yank the current line, without visual selection), the clipboard is not updated. \nOK, now I do\n:set clipboard=unnamed\n\nI do ggyy (go to the first line, yank to unnamed register without using visual selection). Now xclip -o shows \"asd fa sdf\" and I can paste it with my middle mouse button; the X clipboard got filled in with the yank command.\nBottom line\nWithout touching vimperator, it works on my system as expected. Please repeat the above (without using vimperator, see below) to make sure that when you do ggVGy, xclip -o show the contents (unlike in your example).\nMy hypothesis is that vimperator, for some reason, resets the X clipboard. Try to separate the regular vim session from vimperator:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you select something in terminal with your mouse (left button, without Ctrl-Shift-C), can you paste it with middle button to vimperator?\n\n*If you visually select something with vi, can you paste it with middle mouse button in gedit (apparently you can) and see it with xclip -o (you say you can't, but I don't believe it :-); otherwise, middle mouse button would not work )?\n", "Q: Freshclam error After installing clamav and clamtk, when doing freshclam I receive this message:\nfreshclam\nERROR: Can't create temporary directory /var/lib/clamav/clamav-f52645d8e80b9b727228734e339d231d\nHint: The database directory must be writable for UID 1000 or GID 1000\n\nCould somebody help?\n\nA: I seem to remember getting this issue when I first started using clamav, going back through my notes I found I had written this:\nFirst find out my uid and gid by typing at the command prompt: id your_username\nShould give you a long line of text with a uid and gid in it somewhere, then type:\nsudo chown UID.GID /var/lib/clamav\nthen\nsudo chmod 755 /var/lib/clamav\nChange UID and GID with the values you got from the id Command above.\nhope that helps\n\nA: Yes, run freshclam with sudo:\nsudo freshclam\n\nA: http://www.iasptk.com/ubuntu/19931-ubuntu-1204-clamav-problem-with-updating\nIn Terminal:\nStop the updater:\nsudo /etc/init.d/clamav-freshclam stop\n\nUpdate:\nsudo freshclam -v\n\nStart the updater:\nsudo /etc/init.d/clamav-freshclam start\n\n\nA: I got the same error in a docker container and could resolve it by adding:\nAllowSupplementaryGroups true\n\nto /etc/clamav/clamd.conf\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Missed snapshot tab in virtualbox I have Ubuntu 12.04 and VirtualBox 4.1.12.

Drives should not be mounted. For your machine a command similar to this may be able to create an image of the memory stick:\nsudo ddrescue -f -n /dev/sdb /home/earthling/rescue.dd /home/earthling/logfile.dd\n\nAfter sucess we can now try to recover files from this image without any further damage or risk to the data that still reside untouched on your USB drive. \nWe may try to repair the filesystem with tools depending on the format we had there (ext4, NTFS, FAT32,...?).\nAlternatively photorec from the\ntestdisk \nsuite you obviously already had installed may be able to recover individual files (but not filenames) from such an image. See the nice PhotoRec Tutorial for details.\nphotorec /home/earthling/rescue.dd\n\n\nA: Try a program named r-linux. Download from here\n", "Q: Move along by word keyboard combination I'd like to change the default behaviour when editing text.\nBy default, to move one word along, one would press CTRL+→. This is useful for selecting portions of text quickly when in normal* text environments.\nWhere can I modify this to use a different modifier key (e.g. ALT)? I can't find it in the Keyboard Layout > Options or in the Keyboard > Shorcuts.\n*i.e. not Vim/other editor\n\nA: *\n\n*You can use xbindkeys to override certain keys on your keyboard. You can catch them with  bindkeys, and then emit new keypresses using xmacro\n\n\nsee the following howto\n\n\n*\n\n*It could be also a Compiz Setting. check if you have installed Compiz\n\n*Enter the following in your command-line, this should do the job\nbindkey '^[[5D' emacs-backward-word\nbindkey '^[[5C' emacs-forward-word\n\nA: That depends on which program you mean. Unfortunately, this is not a global shortcut, but every application decides on its own how to implement that. This is why it is not present in the global system shortcuts.\nWhat you can do is to catch the \"Alt-Right\" combination -- and xbindkeys here, as mentioned in another reply, a way to solve that -- and let it emit \"Ctrl-Right\". This will achieve using Alt-Right for jumping to the next word. But there is a downside: you will not be able to get rid of the \"Ctrl-Right\" combination doing the same.\nOK, so how exactly does the configuration with xbindkeys looks like. It is much less straightforward than it looks like at first. I tried to do it below, but it turned out to be next to impossible.\nFirst, install xmacro and xbindkeys, and create the rc file for xbindkeys.\nsudo apt-get install xmacro xbindkeys xbindkeys-config\nxkbindkeys -d > $HOME/.xbindkeysrc\n\nNext, enter the following two lines into the .xbindkeysrc file:\n\"{ echo KeyStrRelease Alt_L ; echo KeyStrRelease Alt_R ; echo KeyStrRelease  Right ; echo KeyStrPress Control_L ; echo KeyStrPress Right ; echo KeyStrRelease Right; echo KeyStrRelease Control_L ; } | xmacroplay -d 0 :0.0  } | xmacroplay -d 0 :0.0\"\n   Alt + Right\n\"{ echo KeyStrRelease Alt_L ; echo KeyStrRelease Alt_R ; echo KeyStrRelease Left ; echo KeyStrPress Control_L ; echo KeyStrPress Left ; echo KeyStrRelease Left ; echo KeyStrRelease Control_L ; } | xmacroplay -d 0 :0.0  } | xmacroplay -d 0 :0.0\"\n   Alt + Left\n\nWhat this will do: when you first press Alt-Right, xbindkeys will run the command; but beware! the keys alt and right are still pressed. We must \"unpress\" them first. The above works, but not perfectly, be warned. Most importantly, to jump two words, you have the press the combination, release it, and press again; with ctrl-right, you can press the combination, and then repeat the press on the right arrow as many times as needed.\n", "Q: How to make Ubuntu detect my system jack as speakers so I can have 5.1 sound? I have an Acer 5738G with Ubuntu 12.04, I modified the configurations to have 5.1 sound.

Machines are one at home (cable-modem internet) and the other at the office (several internet connections, load-balanced).\nProblem:\nRhythmbox refuses to stay connected to a radio. Anyone of the included radio lists, but I mostly \"tune it\" to Absolute Classic Rock. It starts playing for a couple of minutes, then cuts the audio, like it's buffering for a while, then resumes but at lower quality. Then, it cuts audio again and looks for a decoder. After a while searching an error box pops-up with the following text, no title:\nRequired plugin could not be found\n\nPython (v2.7) requires to install plugins to play media files of the following type: text/html decoder\n\nThe laptop had a clean reinstall; it had 10.04LTS (upgrade 10.04->12.04 gone awry) and its old Rhythmbox worked correctly. No cutouts at all, except under heavy network loads, but that was expected; and then it even tried two or three times at hi-quality (broadband) before going lo-quality (modem). Did not have the VM at the moment. In 12.04 it tries once, then steps quality down, then the plugin search, then the error appears.\nMeanwhile, at the office, ancient WinAMP 2.95 works flawlessly in the WinXP host when tuned to the same radio... At the same time!\nIs there a solution to this problem? Am I missing some very stupid config or setting? How can I debug where the problem is?\n\nA: There's a workaround described here:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/rhythmbox/+bug/1043039\n\"A workaround for this issue is to right-click the radio station, select properties, copy its URL, and then paste it back into a browser, download the playlist file, open it using a text editor, tweak it if desired, then open it using Rhythmbox -- a new radio station will appear, working this time.\"\n", "Q: Why I am getting Can't open /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions error?

I am wondering how is it possible somebody to make a non-free application under Ubuntu.\nBeing an open-source programmer, I've found that in order to make even the simplest program I use libraries that are Open Source and thus, I can legally use them only if my program is going to be free and open source.\nSo, I wonder, in order to develop a non-free application you require to write all the libraries you are going to use yourself and  you cannot have open source dependencies etc?\n\nA: This is not really true. Only the GPL license and a few related licenses are \"copyleft\", forcing you to opensource the software constructed based on the GPL software. However, you can freely use for example the LGPL libraries. In fact, the LGPL was created specifically with this goal in mind -- creating closed source applications with shared open source LGPL libraries. Moreover, under BSD or BSD-like license (for example, Python) allows you to essentially take as it is and do whatever you like with it.\nIn other words, open source does not enforce open source. Moreover, opensource does not mean \"free as in beer\". You are perfectly allowed to charge for open source programs, or create an open source program but ask for money when selling data (like media files or resources associated with that program).\nTo sum it up:\n\n\n*\n\n*BSD-like licenses allow you to freely modify and distribute the code as you see fit;\n\n*LGPL (lesser GNU public license) allows the creation of proprietary code linked to shared libraries which are open source. For example, the entire glibc is LGPL;\n\n*GPL license forces you to distribute any modifications to a GPL-program under GPL.\n\n\nThus, you can happily write your program, linking it to a broad range of libraries or even directly incorporating pieces of alien code, compile it and sell it as a proprietary, closed source program, as long as you do not distribute modified GPL'ed programs.\n", "Q: How to get videos on Yahoo finance to play Until a few months ago, these videos played ok in Firefox and Opera.\nThen they stopped playing in Firefox\nNow they don't play at all.

For more details, type man sudo in terminal.\nsudo apt-get install softwarename means you are giving root privileges to apt-get program to install software. apt-get (for more details type man apt-get in terminal) can't install software from source code. tar balls are usually source codes.\nFor installing software from tar ball, follow the instructions in the post:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install a .tar.gz (or .tar.bz2) file?\n\nA: Like January said if the file .tar.gz is owned by your user, you don't need sudo to extract the file.\nTo install some file *.tar.gz, you basically would do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a console, and go to the directory where the file is\n\n*Type: tar -zxvf file.tar.gz\n\n*Read the file INSTALL and/or README to know if you need some dependencies.\nMost of the times you only need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*type ./configure\n\n*make\n\n*sudo make install\n\nA: No need to use sudo to unpack the archive. Type this in a terminal:\ntar -xzf archive.tar.gz\n\nOr you can just double-click on the archive from Nautilus (the file manager) to see what's inside. No need for command line until now.\nIf this archive contains something to install in the system, then sudo would be useful at one point or another. Very often, such an archive contains software that must be compiled and then installed. Typically, what you then do is as follows:\ntar -xzf archive-name.tar.gz\ncd archive-name\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nAs you see, only the step actually installing the program requires superuser rights; everything else happens just in your home directory, which you own.

So, is there a Ubuntu version for my sound card driver?\n\nA: Open a terminal with Ctrl-Alt-T keyboard shortcut and type:    alsamixer\nUse the arrow keys to move around and when over S/PDIF press M to mute, this will turn the light OFF.  Hit the  escape key to leave or just close the terminal.\n\nA: Okay, so I followed Tenplus1's answer and it seemed to work. But it got restored after reboots. So I did some research and found a way. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal by Ctrl + Alt + T\n\n*Type in sudo alsamixer\n\n*Use the arrow keys to move around and when over S/PDIF press M to mute, this will turn the light OFF. \n\n*Hit the Escape key - DO NOT CLOSE TERMINAL\n\n*Type sudo alsactl store - This will make it persist across reboots\n\n*Close Terminal\n\n\nA: It did not work in my case but I found a \"trick\" that does the job, so maybe it will be useful for someone. Just type this in terminal:\necho \"1\" > /sys/module/snd_hda_intel/parameters/power_save\n\nIf it works, add it to your start-up scripts.\n", "Q: YELP does not work right When I click on DashHome then click on the questionmark, It brings up the help system. However when I enter a command to search on it tells me this does not exist. From what I understand the engine is YELP and is suppose to search everything including the man pages. However, I can't get it to find anything. I tried to install the yelp package but it tells me the one that is installed is the latest version. \nAm I doing something wrong?\nEverything I read says hitting the F1 key is suppose to bring up yelp but \nThanks in advance. \nDave\n\nA: Interesting. I think this is either a bug, or a mess up. Yelp is definitely able to bring up man pages if you start it from the terminal like this:\n yelp \"man:ls\"\n\nAlso, if you start yelp for example using F1, then choose Go -> all documents, and type anything in the search box, you will get an error. This seems to be a bug.\n", "Q: How to enable a startpage in Shotwell? How do I enable a startpage in shotwell. I don't like my photos to be shown when opening shotwell. I want it so show an image previously selected, and It should only shows my photos after clicking \"Library\".\n\nA: Unfortunately it's not possible to do this at the minute and there seems to be no hidden settings that come to light when using gsettings or dconf-editor to examine the available schemas and keys. However, to show the available schemas and keys, enter\ngsettings list-recursively | grep -i shotwell\n\nIt seems that Shotwell always loads the library as the first item; there is no way to workaround the feature at the moment.\nA new version of Shotwell (0.13) came out very recently, but there is no mention of this as a feature in the changelog or in any of the other previous release details.\nLooking through the feature requests, there is one similar request to yours from 2 years ago here at yorba.org, which proposed that Shotwell should 'show events on startup instead of photos'. There has been no action taken on the request, so I don't think it is a priority with the developers.\nAt the present minute there doesn't seem to be a way of doing it unfortunately, and one of the developers, Eric Yorba, is a member of this site, so he will probably confirm this.\n", "Q: Can I download music from itunes web site without itunes software? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I download iTunes podcasts with hpodder or other software? \n\nThere is a bunch of free courses available on the net. But a lot of them are available only through iTunes, even if they are free, including one that interests me. There is no way I install iTunes on my computer (not that I can't, but I won't). Is there a workaround (ex : user-agent?) to download the files anyway?\n\nA: *\n\n*Currently, iTunes will not work, not properly at least, with Wine or Playonlinux or Crossover (it used to work a while ago). What will work, though, is to install Windows in VirtualBox, and install iTunes on top of that installation. This is a bit of an overkill for iTunes, but if you have Windows installed in a vbox anyways then it does not cost you too much trouble.\n\n*iTunes is absolutely required to access iTunes if you want to buy music. No alternatives exist. However, as I was informed in a comment -- other software exists to access free contents.\n\n*For some type of the media, there are alternatives to iTunes. For example, you can buy music from Ubuntu One music store or Amazon. I am well aware that this will not replace iTunes Music Store, but you can get music from the Big Four in these stores as well.  \n", "Q: Clementine skips songs on ubuntu 12.04 So I've installed Clementine and it seems to be skipping songs with an error message \"Failed to parse stream\".

It just hangs at \"File Sync Starting\" everytime. I've used all the workaround terminal commands, but nothing works. Now I'm fed up with the desktop client.\nIs there any other way to use UbuntuOne without the default client?\nAny other new fix appriciated!\nThanks!\n\nA: Firstly, sorry to hear you're having problems. It would be worth contacting the U1 support team who are excellent because they may be able to help. However, there are other ways to access Ubuntu One. The U1 website is one of those ways: you can upload and download your files there. You may also find u1ftp (tutorial and instructions at http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2012/09/11/accessing-ubuntu-one-file-storage-via-ftp-from-any-os) an interesting approach if you're happy to access your data directly in your personal cloud without syncing. I'd recommend contacting the support team, though, if you could; we'd certainly like to fix your problem if we can, and it may help other users with similar problems if there are any.\n", "Q: Configure hosts file to use aliases I am running Ubuntu Desktop 12.04 and would like to be able to open a web browser (Firefox), type an alias into the address bar, hit enter, and have the browser take me to the site that the alias references. For instance, I'd like to be able to type in \"so\" and have it take me to http:www.stackoverflow.com, etc.\nI realize this is what \"Favorties\" or \"Bookmarks\" already do, however, this is like the text-only, command-line version of those tools.\nI suspect I have to configure something equivalent to a Windows HOST file, but since I'm so new to Linux/Ubuntu, I don't know what that equivalent is, or if this is even possible to do. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: If you did this with the hosts file, you would have to use the IP address of the websites in question, which would probably be a bad idea. IP addresses change, aand most larger sites use several different IPs in a round-robin/load-balancing configuration. At any rate, to do that, just edit the /etc/hosts file, and add lines similar to this:\n# alias for stackoverflow.com\n64.34.119.12    so\n\nThat first line is just a comment, so you know what it's doing there later.\nIf you just want to have aliases for Firefox, there is an add-on called URL Alias. Just search for it in the add-ons for Firefox. The Alias Links extension in Chrome will do the same thing.\n\nA: You can't do what you want using the /etc/hosts file, because it simply maps names to IP addresses. It does not perform HTTP redirects, which is what you are really after.\nWhile it may work for some sites, many others (e.g. sites hosted on a shared IP) will not.\nThis page has some good reading material regarding the hosts file.\n", "Q: Can't shutdown Ubuntu (Wubi Installation) I downloaded Ubuntu 12.04 using Wubi. The installation went correctly and everything was working fine until I tried to shutdown. \nI clicked shutdown and then Ubuntu started shutdown, but as soon as I saw the Ubuntu logo with blank dots under, it froze. I had to perform a hard shutdown. \nAfter booting my computer back and going into Ubuntu, I tried shutting it down again but this time it took me on a black page with lots and lots of log writing on the screen and after a little while, it stopped writing stuff. \nI was able to input characters using the keyboard and everything, but it never shutdown.

I checked and FGRLX was not there anymore. I went on AMD's website and selected the drivers I needed : Notebook Graphics -> Radeon HD Series -> Radeon HD 7xxxM Series -> Linux x86_64. Then i ran amd-driver-installer-8.982-x86.x86_64.run on a terminal and installed the drivers.

Recently Ubuntu updates the linux kernel very frequently. Most of the times it's actually the same version that is being installed (probably slightly different super minor version number).\nNormally, this should be a good thing, but for me, each kernel update means I have to drop to TTY, stop lightdm, rebuild my Nvidia driver, start lightdm again and login. Then I have to rebuild and reinstall my ndiswrapper module.\nIt's easy, but it's annoying.\nI know I can make updates less frequent in general, but I still want to get the other updates. I don't want to stop updating the kernel altogether either.\nI am looking for a way to tell ubuntu to update the linux kernel less frequently, or even better, to tell it to update the linux kernel only if the minor number of the version changed.\nIs this at all possible?\n\nA: As you have written yourself, your issues are caused by two other problems and not by the updated kernel package itself. It should be easier to fix those issues and have a normal Ubuntu running than applying some kludges that may not work in the next Ubuntu release.\nFinding the Nvidia driver version number\nThe version number of the driver is stored in meta data of the corresponding package.\n$ aptitude show nvidia-current-updates\nPackage: nvidia-current-updates          \nState: not installed\nVersion: 295.49-0ubuntu0.2\n...\n\nThis for instance shows that nvidia-current-updates contains version 295.49. Other Packages available in the repository are nvidia-96, nvidia-173 and nvidia-current as well as packages with the -updates suffix. The package names may change between releases. You can also get newer drivers from the X Updates PPA, if you need to. If you are more comfortable using a web interface instead of the command line that's also possible via Ubuntu's packet search web interface.\nChoosing a Ubuntu supported WiFi card\nYour DLink DWA-110 seems to be a WiFi G standard (54 MBit) USB dongle. Apart from being a bit dated and that a USB 3.0 port wouldn't improve its performance, the really bad thing is that it needs ndiswrapper to work. Getting WiFi to work on Linux did cost a lot of effort some years ago if you didn't get one of the few good cards, but Linux support for WiFi has improved and today it's even easier to get a card or dongle that works out of the box. Which is what everyone should be aiming for when buying hardware for Linux.\nMy advice: Go to your local computer store or electronics discounter, make a list of what's on the shelves or compare prices of online shops, then look up the exact model number (some vendors sold cards with minor model number changes with a completely different chipset) in the compatibility list. Avoid everything with ndiswrapper, cards using the ath9k driver should be a good choice. Also take care of the date in the last updated column, don't pick one that worked 3 years ago.\n", "Q: Can I install Ubuntu on the same hard drive I booted with? I booted Ubuntu using an external hard drive. Is it possible to install it on the same hard-drive without unplugging or turning it off?

The SSD seems to be used for hibernate/sleep in Win7, and that still works after removing the RAID info. \nIt might be possible to install ubuntu on the SSD (sdb), but I could not find the disk in the partition step during installation, so I installed on sda.\n\nA: Solution tl;dr: delete software RAID containers during manual partitioning (works in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS)\nI had a similar problem with a drive that had been part of a RAID array. It would not show up in the partitioner. I dropped into a recovery shell and deleted all its partitions and still it would not show up. Finally I tried the 'Configure software RAID' and destroyed the containers that it found (I was completely repurposing this drive so didn't care about any data left on it.) After dropping back to the 'detect hardware' stage, it picked up the drive and I was able to proceed normally.\nI would hazard a guess that completely zeroing out the drive would work too (i.e. dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1Muntil it runs out of space) but this is a lot slower.\n", "Q: Mismatch of packages to be updated between Update Manager (gui) and apt-get(cli) I noticed my system acting weird today. While the update manager (gui application) states that there are 14 updates selected, and 52 Mb will be downloaded, the apt-get upgrade command only informs me of 1 update to be downloaded and installed.\nThe Update Manager Gui (output) can be found here:\n\nand the cli apt-get upgrade output here:\nfokis@fokis-netbook:~$ sudo apt-get upgrade\nReading package lists...

While update-manager installs them by default, apt-get requires the dist-upgrade parameter to include such packages in its upgrades. \nTechnically, apt-get upgrade will not install any new packages, e.g. linux-image-..., while dist-upgrade will. For more information on the differences between upgrade and dist-upgrade see here.\n", "Q: How to convert AC3 to Flac and apply a delay? I have a MKV video file. The audio track is ac3. I extracted the AC3 and now want to convert it to Flac. But I need to add a delay/offset of 150ms. The offset should be permanent; the actual duration of the resulting Flac should be 150ms longer than the Ac3 input.\nWhat is the command line to do this?\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: I would do it with SoX (Sound eXchange) and ffmpeg (or avconv instead of ffmpeg). SoX is \"the Swiss Army knife of audio manipulation\", an effects and audio manupilation & generation tool for the command line.\nInstall both:\nsudo apt-get install sox ffmpeg\n\nConvert your ac3 file to a wave file. Since SoX cannot read ac3 files directly, this step is unfortunately required:\nffmpeg -i sound.ac3 sound.wav\n\nUse SoX with the pad switch to insert silence at the beginning:\nsox sound.wav sound.flac pad 0.150\n\nThis inserts 150ms of silence at the beginning of the audio file.\nLook at the SoX Manual for more infos.\nYou can also do this in a single line, without the need for creating an intermediate wav file, by using a pipe:\nffmpeg -i sound.ac3 -f wav - | sox - sound.flac pad 0.150\n\n\nA: MediaCoder should be able to handle that.\nDo you want to remux the FLAC into the MKV? Otherwise I don't understand why you'd be concerned about the delay.\n", "Q: Set default printer settings libreoffice Although I set the default printer settings through the \"printing\" manager to NoTumbleDuplex, the LibreOffice print dialog properties isn't defaulted as NoTumbleDuplex.

It is not automatic. Menu -> Log out -> save session must be checked.\n\nA: I also encountered this problem but in Ubuntu 14.04.3: right-click on desktop>change desktop settings>add own image using + and \"span\" it across my two monitors. After logging out, then logging in again, I saw that the background was saved but not after restarting the computer.\nI'm new in using Ubuntu but somehow know a bit about Linux and was able to set my first Ubuntu install yesterday (after deciding to leave Windows).\nSo, here's my guess: my wallpaper is not being found when I login because the image is in an internal hard disk drive that is probably not mounted upon login.\nI copied my wallpaper from the unmounted HDD to somewhere inside my home folder (e.g. ~\\Pictures\\wallpapers\\image.jpg) and set this image as my desktop background, and my problem was solved.\nI hope this helps someone similar to my case.

I downloaded the 12.04 ISO and burned to a DVD.  \nI want to install Ubuntu over Windows.  I have recovery CD's made in case Ubuntu isn't for me and my family.  During the install it says No root file system is defined please correct this from the partitioning table.  \nIn the box where I should be able to choose a partition, none are available to choose from, it is blank.  I know that HP has decided to use 4 partitions.  How do I go about deleting all the partitions using the LiveCD?  I've never used GParted before and am a bit lost when it comes to anything to do with partitions.\n\nAfter following your directions completely, when I choose to install, I still have the same problem.  No partitions show up to install from.  It's just a blank box and I still get the same error.\nIn Gparted it show:\nPartition     File System   Label     Size    Used     Unused     Flags\nunallocated    unallocated            698.64   -          - \n/dev/sda1      ext2          /        698.63   11.03GiB  687.60   boot\nunallocated    unallocated              2.49   -          -\nI close out Gparted and then click Install Ubuntu on the desktop.  It asks me to choose a language, make sure i'm connected to the net, download updates, install 3rd party software.  I click next.  Then the option to choose where to install it comes up, however there is nothing to choose from.  At the bottom it says /dev/sda.  I click install and it gives me the error \"No root partition is selected check your partition table\"  ???\n\nI am not getting an Installation Type choice on the third screen.  I do not know how to take screen shots of what I am doing either, so I am doing my best to spell out what is happening:\nOn the desktop I open the shortcut that says \"Install Ubuntun 12.04.1 LTS.\nThe first screen that appears says Welcome and it asks me to choose a language.  I select English and click Continue.\nScreen 2 says Preparing to Install Ubuntu.

Size, Used\nBelow that is a large empty space\nTowards the bottom there are buttons \"New Partition Table... Add... Change...\nBelow that it says Device for boot loader installation:\n/dev/sda\nThen on the bottom right of screen is Quit, Back, Install Now.\nThe first two buttons at bottom are obvious, but when I click \"Install Now\" I get the following error:\nNo Root file system is defined. Please correct this from the partitioning menu.\n\nA: If you want to get rid of Windows completely, then in the partitioner right-click each of the HP/Windows partitions and delete them. Next, create a new partition. Here is an image of what the options may look like:\nWhen presented with these options, choose \"Primary\" for the \"Create as:\" option.\nIn the section \"New size (in MB)\" put the amount of MB that equals the size of your hard drive - 1000mb. Set \"Filesystem\" as Ext 4.\nThere should be a section to define the partition. Set it as root, which is represented as \"/\"\nMake the second partition as \"swap.\" Make it the size of the remaining amount of unpartitioned space.\nI'm telling you to put such a small amount of swap assuming you have a relatively new computer (3-4 yrs?). Swap is hard drive space used in UNIX operating systems that gets used as RAM. You don't even need it really.\n/ represents your entire hard drive outside of swap. It is the equivalent of the \"C\" drive in Windows. Newbie distributions of Linux like Ubuntu use only / and swap to make partitioning easier. I run Arch and use four partitions: /boot, /, /home, and swap. This is not necessary is your are running ubuntu for the first time. You can get away with using only /.\nNOTE: For root /, be sure to mark it as bootable. If you fail to do so, your computer will not be able to boot. IIRC, you right click on that partition and toggle the \"bootable\" flag. It has been a while since I have played around with Ubuntu. Good luck!\n\nA: If you really want to completely replace Windows, just choose \"Erase disk and install Ubuntu\" on the third screen of the installation process as shown below. There is no need for you to delete existing partitions.\n\nAfter which you'll see the selected disk and partitioning scheme that will be used. You can click on the \"Select drive:\" box to change the selected drive. As you'll see Ubuntu will be installed on the entire drive with ext4 file system.\n\nThen click on \"Install Now\" to complete the installation process.\n", "Q: System Requirements for Ubuntu 12.0x? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat are the minimum system requirements for 12.04 LTS? \n\nI just want to know what are the minimum system requirements for Ubuntu 12.x in general!\nPlease help me a be specific, because other answer only pertain to other people's computer systems.\n\nA: 700 MHz processor (about Intel Celeron or better)\n512 MiB RAM (system memory)\n5 GB of hard-drive space (or USB stick, memory card or external drive but see LiveCD for an alternative approach)\nVGA capable of 1024x768 screen resolution\nReference: Ubuntu System Requirements\n", "Q: Updated version of Adobe Reader I'm not sure if this has been answered already...anyhow, I'm placing this question, so you could help.\nI've been a PC user for as long as I can remember, and I've just migrated to Ubuntu.

So I was running apt-get upgrade on a server when the router decided it had been too long since it last made me angry: It dropped all connection. Moral of the story is to use screen a lot when you're on a bum router.\nAnyway, I logged back in and found in htop that the process was still hanging there, still waiting for my Y/n to upgrade (hadn't hit it yet, luckily). Is there any way I can reattach to a session that had been broken off? I ended up just killing it since it wasn't in the middle of package management but it would be great to know for future reference.\n\nA: For running long lasting processes, I use screen, or byobu if you want a more friendly interface.\nFor screen, you can use:\nscreen [program] [args]\n\nThis will run [program] and its [args] inside a screen session. Once the program is finished, the session is automatically closed. If you wish to keep the session after your program runs, just run screen without any arguments and a new prompt will appear inside the session. CTRL+A+D detaches the terminal from the current session.\nTo re-attach to a previous session:\nscreen -r\n\nIf there is only one session open, it will reattach immediately. If multiple sessions are ongoing, it will ask you which one you want to attach to. If you know the session name, you can just add it as an argument to this command line.\nByobu is a nice improvement. It's based on screen, but provides a bar at the bottom that shows all current sessions as tabs and gives easier shortcuts to move around those. You can:\n\n\n*\n\n*F2 start a new session\n\n*F3 move to the next session tab on the left\n\n*F4 move to the next session tab on the right\n\n*F8 give a friendly name to the current session tab\n\n*F9 opens a options menu\n\n*CTRL+A+D detaches all sessions from the terminal.\n\n\nWORD OF ADVICE: avoid leaving a session opened with the user root. If anyone gains access to your terminal (locally or remotely), they can easily re-attach to an ongoing session and use your system as root. If needed, it's best to start a session using a common user and sudo indivudual command lines as necessary.\n\nA: While you can't reattach to a broken SSH session, you can reparent the process running inside SSH – functionally equivalent to what you want.\nInstructions\nIn your case, you would take over the apt-get process, with the goal to control it from a new SSH session, screen session or the like. My favourite for this is the reptyr command:\n$ sudo apt-get install reptyr\n$ ps ax | grep apt-get\n10626 pts/8   R+     0:32 apt-get upgrade\n\nThen, with the pid you found for your process:\n$ sudo reptyr -T 10626\n\nOr if that does not work, try:\n$ reptyr 10626\n\nAfter this stage, all your keyboard input goes to the program you took over. Unfortunately you will not see old output of the SSH session, such as the apt-get output asking you for confirmation.\nExplanations\nThere are multiple other tools that basically work the same as reptyr (that is, via ptrace debug attachment). See the following questions and answers where they are discussed:\n\n*\n\n*How can I disown a running process and associate it to a new screen shell?\n\n*Resume command running in dropped SSH session\nIn the instructions above, the reptyr 10626 uses ptrace debug attachment while the sudo reptyr -T 10626 command uses TTY stealing and is preferable (details).\nFinally, the reason why you can't take over a SSH session this way is because a sshd process is not controlled by a host terminal, instead it provides the slave part of a terminal – a pts device – while the master part controlling it resides on the client machine, here with a broken-down SSH session in between. When you force taking over such a sshd process with reptyr -s <pid>, your keyboard input goes to that process, not its active child process. So a \"Ctrl+Z\" will simply kill off that sshd.\n\nA: I was doing do-dist-upgrade via ssh from a laptop which went into suspend, hence Broken pipe. Upon going back into the machine I was seeing the upgrade-related processes still running, among which a whiptail asking me for input (which display manager to choose) and, relevantly, a root-owned SCREEN. I was able to do sudo su - and screen -r to attach to the session and, lo and behold, I have the whiptail dialog in front of me able to take input. I was able to resume the upgrade seamlessly.\nNote: this was an upgrade from Ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04.\n\nA: The answer to your proper question is: you can't. I think the main problem is that the authentication procedures will be out of sync. It Just Doesn't Work Like That.\nAs you have yourself noticed, the solution is to use screen when possible (by the way, tmux is an alternative to screen).\n", "Q: How do I access windows folder from ubuntu? \nPossible Duplicate:\nAccess Windows 7 Files from Ubuntu 12.04 \n\nI am using ubuntu 12.04 side by side with windows 7.

They are included in the C code such that you can use the functions defined there. Don't worry about them if you don't code.\n\nA: That folder includes the header files for C compilers. Such as \"stdio.h\", \"stdlib.h\" etc.\nWhen you type header information in the C source file such #include <stdio.h> the compiler will look for the file in /usr/include directory by default.\nbig_endian.h and little_endina.h files are included, because though your computer may be of only one kind, you can cross-develop application for both architecture.

In 12.04, the Appearance settings only contain a few stock themes, and other than the special purpose contrast ones they all have the overlay scroll bars. If I aptitude search gtk3 | grep theme I get no results so there appears to be no packaged alternative either.\nMost suggestions I've seen for disabling the overlay scroll bars involve uninstalling packages or editing files as root. I want to disable them just for the current user, not for everyone on the whole box; as should be the case for any theme/display setting.\nThere is a gsettings command that temporarily disables the overlay scrollbars just for the current user, but this has two problems of its own:\n\n\n*\n\n*The setting doesn't stick after log off.

I am going to install Glassfish, MySQL etc and I wonder if these should have their own users such as glassfish user, mysql user and so on? Or is it sufficient/better to just create a group and add my own nonroot account to it?  \n\nA: Glassfish or MySQL will create their own users and I think it's better to rely on them instead of creating a group and adding your non-root user to it.\n\nA: In Ubuntu, applications come in a form of packages which are stored in a package repository and installed using a package manager. A package normally comes with install scripts, config files and everything needed to run the particular software, including creating and configuring non-privileged user accounts. \nYou normally should not be concerned with creating user accounts for your MySQL server, manually compiling programs or even creating config files, especially if you're new to Linux.

My screen resolution was correct, but if the screensaver came on while I was switched over to the other machine, then when I returned to the Ubuntu machine and the screensaver switched off, the screen resolution was wrong.  I figured that something must have polled my monitor, and when it could not find it, it used default parameters.  I did 2 things.  I removed Gnome-Screensaver and the associated autostart program.  I am now using Xscreensaver.  I uninstalled the AMD drivers.  Now it is working properly.\n\nA: I've had a similar problem for years with a budget KVM switch that doesn't even have software or settings.  My solution probably isn't the right way, but it works and it's easier to understand than xorg.conf.\nDoing it this way, your desktop will technically start in the wrong resolution, but it'll change before it finishes initializing anyway.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you know your monitor's native resolution.  Mine is 1920x1080, so that's what I'll use here.\n\n\n*\n\n*See what choices xrandr says you have.  You probably won't find the right resolution there.  Just type xrandr with no arguments and it'll give you a list of the available modes.\n\n*Take a look at what xrandr calls your external monitor, too.  You'll need that later.  Mine is \"VGA-0\".  The display built into the laptop is usually something like \"LVDS-0\".\n\n\n*Generate a Modeline using cvt.  You should already have it because it comes with Xorg Core:\ncvt 1920 1080\nThe output will look something like this:\n# 1920x1080 59.96 Hz (CVT 2.07M9) hsync: 67.16 kHz; pclk: 173.00 MHz\nModeline \"1920x1080_60.00\"  173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync\n\nThere's no need to understand all of those numbers, just copy everything after \"Modeline\" on the second line.\n\n*Now, create a new mode with xrandr.  This is where you'll paste the stuff you copied from after the word \"Modeline\":\nxrandr --newmode \"1920x1080_60.00\" 173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync\n\nThat first part in the quotes is the name of your new mode.  You can change it if you want to.\n\n*Now, add the mode to your monitor:\nxrandr --addmode VGA-0 1920x1080_60.00\n\n\n*Now switch to the new mode:\n    xrandr --output VGA-0 --mode 1920x1080_60.00\nSwitch back and forth between modes a couple of times to see it work.\n\n*Add the newmode, addmode, and mode lines to a file named .xinitrc in your home directory using your favorite text editor.

I am using Ubuntu without installing it in my laptop. \nMy problem is that I don’t see the Windows partitions in Ubuntu 12.04.1, because of which I am unable to backup the data. Any suggestion in this regard would be very helpful. \nPS: I checked the SMART status of the HDD it says 2 Bad sectors, when I attempted an extended Self-Test, I get a Read Failed message, though the Short test goes through fine. \nThank You,\nSiva\n\nA: It seems most likely that the hard drive and the file system is damaged and it is not possible to mount the drive in the normal way.  The Ubuntu LiveCD will have no problems reading a good NTFS partition - it will be accessible through Nautilus File manager.\nIf the Windows file system does not show up in Nautilus, try mounting the drive as read only.  Open a terminal window and type:\nsudo mount -r -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\n(replace /sda1 by the name of your Windows partition, you can check it via 'sudo blkid' or 'sudo parted -l')\nIf this works with no errors you can then access your data in terminal or Nautilus under the directory /mnt, for example\ncd \"/mnt/Documents and Settings/yourusername/Documents\"\n\nand so on.  If you use terminal (bash) then be aware that Linux is case sensitive.  If you type 'documents' instead of 'Documents' it will not work.\nYou will not be able to modify anything on the hard drive because it will be mounted read only.  This is a good thing given the current state of the drive.  You will need another hard drive with enough capacity make your backup on.\nGood Luck!\nIf the mount works but the contents of /mnt don't look right, it might be because it's the wrong partition (the above assumes windows installed on the the first (sda1) partition.  If you can't find the correct partition then paste the output of the following bash command here:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nso that we can have a look.\n\nA: Windows 7 is using NTFS partition. By Default this kind of partitions are RECOGNIZED by ubuntu. If for anycase it doesn't recognize them You should try to install them if you can reach internet from ubuntu live cd using the following command:\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-config\nAnother solution is to download Gparted live cd or Hiren's Boot CD\n", "Q: Can not restart dnsmasq due to \" configuration syntax check   [fail]\" I restart dnsmasq and get \n$ sudo /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart\n * Restarting DNS forwarder and DHCP server configuration syntax check   [fail]\n\nFrom where and how can I troubleshooting?\n\nA: dnsmasq can be configured by editing the file\n /etc/dnsmasq.conf\n\ndhcp config file:\n/etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf\n\n\nA: I found this link to be very helpful.

Therefore I highly recommend that you revert any changes you have made in this directory. Creating a separate /boot/ partition won't help either (there's no evidence that you have a BIOS which can't properly handle large drives).\nUbuntu hides the grub menu by default unless it detects another OS, overriding the GRUB_TIMEOUT in /etc/default/grub, that's why you're not seeing a grub menu by default. This is Ubuntu specific, upstream grub does not do this.\nThe fact that you're also not seeing the grub menu when you hold shift suggests that grub isn't getting keypresses at all, and so even if the grub menu were shown you wouldn't be able to interact with it. If that's the case, there are ways that we can try to fix it, just don't be surprised if that happens.\nTo get grub to show the menu for 10 seconds (overriding Ubuntu's hiding of the menu, and any timeout settings in /etc/default/grub) create a file /boot/grub/custom.cfg with the contents timeout=10. This solution is safe, simple, easy to revert (delete the file) and should not cause any problems on upgrades.\n\nA: Try replacing the first section in /etc/default/grub file with this one\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=10\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nThen execute sudo update-grub in the terminal.

Is it possible to carry my desktop in my pendrive and use in my office computer and synchronize with my computer when I am back at home.\n\nA: I do something similar, and just use rsync to keep the pendrive up to date or to update one of the computers.  rsync works best because with the right switches it will back everything up without overwriting the same file each time, or overwriting newer files with an older version.\nTo backup (for example) your Documents directory to the Pendrive first give the pendrive a label (volume name) and make a target directory such as 'Documents' on it.  By giving the pendrive a label it will be easily found under the /media directory.  Next issue the following command:\nrsync -av ~/Documents/ /media/yourlabelname/Documents/\n\nThis command will backup up everything in your home Documents onto the pendrive.  To reverse the process and update the files on another comptuer, simply reverse the rsync command eg:\nrsync -av /media/yourlabelname/Documnets/ ~/Documents/\n\nIt's easy enough to put both of these commands into very short bash scripts and execute one each time by typing the name of the bash script.  If the scripts are in ~/bin then they will get included in the executable path.\nNote that if the USB drive is formatted FAT then the volume name is normally limited to capitals only, even if you typed the volume name in lowercase when you created it.  Because bash is completely case sensitive you must get the volume name and directory name exactly right or the rsync commands will fail to work.\n", "Q: Choppy and/or extremely fast video playback Tried Ubuntu, and now Mint, had the same issue on both and asked questions on both and didn't get an answer.

So, it is used by Ubuntu and now has a EXT4 filesystem. As Windows can't show ext4 partition, you can't see that drive.\nYou can still see that drive by going to the \"Disk management\" in Windows. That partition should have label \"unknown\".\nTo run Disk management, press Start menu and type diskmgmt.msc and Press and hold Shift key and then hit Enter.\n\nA: Ubuntu uses the ext4 file system which is a file system that Windows cannot see. When you boot into Ubuntu you can see your C: drive because it's formatted as NTFS, which Ubuntu (Linux) can recognize. Windows however cannot see, mount, or access an ext4 file system.\nSo, if you want to share files between the two installations, just keep all your stuff on your Windows installation and access them from your Ubuntu installation, since you can't do it the other way around.\n\nA: True is, you cannot access ext4 filesystem/partition by windows OS.\nmy solution is to reduce ubuntu partitions and create ntfs partition which will be shared among all the operating systems. after creating the parititon you can assign drive letter in windows and create a mountpoint in linux (directory which will be pointed to this partition).\nuse gparted to shrink ext4 partitions or diskmgmt.msc to shrink ntfs partitions (although gparted can handle NTFS partitions, diskmgmt is safer).\n(to install it - sudo apt-get install gparted)\nDO NOT change or move \"System Reserved\" partition (a 100MB partition, the first one) because it will ruin your boot process.\nalso, DO NOT move the partition which holds \"/boot\" mountpoint (if you chose the default, it's the \"/\" mountpoint.

When stdout is a terminal (rather than being redirected to a file or non-terminal device, or piped to another command), -C is implied. So running ls -C is the same as running ls. But they are not equivalent when ls is redirected or piped. For example:\nek@Kip:~/firefox$ ls\napplication.ini             libfreebl3.chk    libxpcom.so\nblocklist.xml               libfreebl3.so     libxul.so\nchrome                      libmozalloc.so    mozilla-xremote-client\nchrome.manifest             libmozsqlite3.so  omni.ja\ncomponents                  libnspr4.so       platform.ini\ncrashreporter               libnss3.so        plugin-container\n\n...\n\nek@Kip:~/firefox$ ls | less\n\napplication.ini\nblocklist.xml\nchrome\nchrome.manifest\ncomponents\ncrashreporter\n\n...\n\nIn contrast, ls -C (or -l) outputs in column form regardless of what kind of device stdout is. ls -C | less looks like the top output (but paged by less, of course).\n-F\nThe main visible difference between ls and l is due to the -F flag, which causes ls to append symbolic suffixes (called indicators) to the entries it displays. These indicators identify what kind of file or directory they are.\nCompare this to the output of the first ls command above:\nek@Kip:~/firefox$ ls -F\napplication.ini             libfreebl3.chk     libxpcom.so*\nblocklist.xml               libfreebl3.so*     libxul.so*\nchrome/                     libmozalloc.so*    mozilla-xremote-client*\nchrome.manifest             libmozsqlite3.so*  omni.ja\ncomponents/                 libnspr4.so*       platform.ini\ncrashreporter*              libnss3.so*        plugin-container*\n\n...\n\nHere:\n\n*\n\n*/ means the entry is a directory.\n\n** means the entry is a normal file and is executable (i.e., has executable permissions).\n\n*The absence of any indicator means the entry is a normal file that is not executable.\n\nThere are several other indicators:\n\n*\n\n*@ means the entry is a symbolic link (see also man symlink).\n\n*| means the entry is a FIFO device (remember, many resources in Unix-like OSes are represented by filesystem entries).\n\n*= means the entry is a socket.\n\n*> means the entry is a door.\n\nThe --classify flag and --indicator-style=classify are equivalent to -F.\nSource: GNU Coreutils manual, Section 10.1.5 General output formatting\nIn conclusion, l (ls -CF) is similar to but not the same as ls.\nIt's also good to keep in mind:\nThe same text can be both a regular command and an alias.\nThis is commonly used to specify options that are widely considered both highly useful and harmless, such as automatic colorization (where color is applied when stdout is unredirected or is a terminal, so the escape codes specifying colors are virtually guaranteed not to be misinterpreted).\nBy this principle, ls is itself an alias.\nek@Kip:/$ alias ls\nalias ls='ls --color=auto'\n\nSo what command really gets executed when you run l? This one:\n/bin/ls --color=auto -CF\n\n\n*\n\n*The shell (bash) resolves commands that don't contain a / to the first match appearing in PATH, which in Ubuntu for ls is /bin/ls.\n\n*Aliases can contain aliases. Alias resolution is not recursive (an alias cannot call itself, though it can call a regular command that has the same name). But it does support nesting.\n\nSo l resolves to ls -CF which resolves to ls --color=auto -CF.\nAliases can be changed.\nThese aliases exist because they're set up that way by default, but every user can change their aliases. See man alias, Chapter 25 and Appendix M in the Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide, and How save my \"alias\" entries forever.\nRelated: What do the different colors mean in ls?\n\nA: When in doubt, type l:\nl is aliased to `ls -alF'\n\n(see also What does the la command do)\n", "Q: Unable to switch to integrated GPU, using fglrx, Catalyst 12.6, Ubuntu 12.04 recently I installed proprietary drivers from ATI,\nbut I am unable to switch to integrated GPU\n\n\n*\n\n*using console\nsudo amdconfig --px-igpu\nsudo restart lightdm\n\ni am able to log in, but then system shows only background image\nand mouse cursor (which moves, but does not interact)\n\n*using Catalyst Control Center\nsystem hangs and mouse moves choppy\nMy system configuration:\nHP 4330s\nIntel i5 2410M\nATI Radeon HD 6490M\nCatalyst 12.6\nUbuntu 12.04\n\nA: This should be kind of fixed in Ubuntu 12.10.\nThere are a couple of other bugs, though, so you might want to follow the instructions here:\nCan't install ATI proprietary drivers in 12.10\n", "Q: How to reduce WUBI installed Ubuntu drive space? I originally gave Ubuntu 20 GB of my Windows space and realize that it's a lot more than it needs, especially since I only got it on Windows to explore the features. I don't want to delete Ubuntu, I just merely want to reclaim unneeded space from it.\n\nA: You can resize a Wubi install. Either by creating a new smaller root.disk and then deleting the old one: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ResizeandDuplicateWubiDisk \nor you can do an inplace resize, which will shrink the current root.disk, but this needs to be done from a live environment (CD/USB) not while running wubi: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ResizeWubiDisk (this may be your best option if you don't have enough space to duplicate your disk).\nThe only requirement is that you choose a new size that is big enough for your current files and also a free space buffer required for the operating system to run (and for new data/programs you may need). The script (first option) enforces a bare-minimum (requires about 500MB only), but not the direct resize. I'd recommend more than the minimum e.g. at least 3 GB free space, because if you try to upgrade a Wubi install with less it will likely fail.\n", "Q: System monitor in console mode Is there a way to start system monitor app, from the console ??\n I am not talking about terminal.\nI am talking about  Ctrl + Alt + F1 mode\n\nA: You can try the top command to have a system monitor in console.

(The computer exploded)\n\nSorry, but you cannot get your key back. This is by design.\nThe RSA (and DSA/ElGamal) algorithms are engineered so that the keys must be made at the same time. There are intermediate variables that are not stored as part of the either the private or public key. Because the public key is crafted to be made public, you cannot deduce the secret key from it, or there would be a giant security hole. The two primes are generated from random numbers.\nAlso, the key email/name/description have no bearing on the modulus(\"meaty\" data portion of the key). Therefore, you cannot recover your secret key without a backup, at least not without factoring large numbers which cannot be easily done right now. The passphrase is used to protect the key with another (symmetric) key generated from the passphrase, but neither this key nor the password affect the modulus in any way except a stray source of random data.\nWhat can I do?\nYou can go to Launchpad key management after logging in via username and password, revoke your old keys. and then make and publish new keys. There is no limit on the number of keys you can publish. Make a secure backup, and ensure nobody gets unauthorized access to the backup, and that the keys in the backup are protected by a passphrase.\n\nA: No, it is highly unprobable that you'd be able to generate the same key again.\nHowever, you can easily import/export keys following the steps below:\nImporting the keyring (all the keys)\nJust copy the ~/.gnupg directory from the source machine to the destination machine.\nImporting only a particular key\nSuppose the name of the key is ABCDFE01.\nExport the public and private keys to files named mygpgkey_pub.gpg and mygpgkey_sec.gpg respectively.\ngpg --output mygpgkey_pub.gpg --armor --export ABCDFE01\ngpg --output mygpgkey_sec.gpg --armor --export-secret-key ABCDFE01 \n\nThen, copy those files to the destination computer, and run:\ngpg --import ~/mygpgkey_pub.gpg\ngpg --allow-secret-key-import --import ~/mygpgkey_sec.gpg \n\nSource: http://www.ralree.com/2007/03/07/howto-export-and-import-private-gpg-keys/\n", "Q: Printer setup problem Using Ubuntu 12.04 on old used to be XP desktop now dedicated to Ubuntu.

These i386  error message always occurs when it is an architecture problem. In contrast, I successfully installed the same 32 bit deb on a 32 bit system today, so the issue is not due to a bad version of Chrome.\nThe architecture error is well known, as documented in a similar question at Superuser where similar dependency issues are discussed.

Sometimes it is still necessary to use the 64 bit version of the package. \nThere is no point in forcing the installation with something like sudo dpkg -i --force /location/of/deb, as that will not solve the dependency issues, so I should just remove the partial installation of Chrome with sudo apt-get install -f and install the 64 bit deb from the Google Chrome site with gdebi or Software Center, which will resolve the dependencies as well.\n\nA: This is caused by bug #992797.\nIt's not due to the version number but the lack of Multi-Arch support in the xdg-utils package. I was able to successfully install Chrome without --force-depends by adding Multi-Arch: foreign to the DEBIAN/control file for xdg-utils and rebuilding that package with dpkg-deb, but of course this still leaves apt-get dist-upgrade broken because the repositories have a broken version.\nUpdate: If you add an epoch to the version, it will fix apt-get.

Many people are complaining about the fact that even though the OSs are able to see the extra battery \"juice\" from the Battery Bay, after the main battery runs out of energy the computer shuts down. In most cases, this happens because they haven't set up the Lenovo Power Manager, according to other users in support forums.\nHas anyone tested this under Ubuntu 12.04 LTS to see whether it can recognize/manipulate/use the extra battery energy from the Ultrabay or not?\n\nA: I don't know for W520, but I am currently using a T430s with an ultrabay battery, under Quantal (just upgraded from 12.04). I had nothing to do to make it work, the laptop will first \"consume\" power from ultrabay, and then switch to main battery automatically.\nAll that is done at the bios level, so no special support is needed from Linux / Ubuntu.\nSome people want to interact with the way the batteries are used (priority, etc...), to enhance the battery lifespan essentially. To do so, you either need a special driver, or use ACPI, depending on your model and bios.\nYou should have a look at http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/How_to_use_UltraBay_batteries if not already done.\n", "Q: Wanting to install ati driver for duel graphics AMD8 with radeon 6470 With 11.10 I used to download the latest ati driver for my duel graphics Radeon card problem.\nWith 12.04 the graphics problem is resolved it seems.\nBut the Ubuntu driver on  my Laptop is burning.\nSo I wanted to install the ati driver to see if it would be better.\nIn the old days when the laptop would not run without the ati driver I simply ran recovery mode and it promoted me for my user and password.\nInstalling 12.04 I changed my user to user1.\nBut now in 12.04 it doesnt stop at the prompt for name and password but takes me to a window where I can drop to root etc.\nCan someone tell me how to input the command I tried terminal but it doesnt recognise my command cd /home/user1/Downloads\nShould I do it in recovery using root \nIf so what are the commands please\nOr better still tell me the fix to keep my graphics cool if I keep ubuntu driver.

I was running Firefox, two tabs one with Youtube and my system froze and required hard reboot.\nIs there a way to find the cause of the crash after a system reboot?\nDoes Ubuntu auto log crashes?\n\nA: There is possibly an answer in the syslog file.\nSearch for 'log' in the dash and 'log file viewer' should come up, I then usually comb over the log for anything that stands out, like look at the log and see what happened just before your computer rebooted, if it's got anything interesting like errors or crashes I usually google the line to see what other people are saying.\n", "Q: Terminal stuck in mirrored display mode (ctrl-alt-f1) I have a dual monitor setup.

Today I noticed that when I Ctrl+Alt+F1 to get a raw terminal, the terminal is in mirrored display mode.  I see it both on my primary display and on my secondary display.

The Ctrl-Alt-F1 virtual terminal is separate from X, and only one can be controlling the graphics card at a time.  Think about it this way: if you had X on one monitor and the VT on another, how would you switch focus between the two?  They don't interact (that's kind of the point).\n", "Q: How to fix the boot set up? I got two OSes in my PC, Ubuntu and Windows 7. \nUntil yesterday Windows 7 was on top of my dual-boot menu list, but I wanted to change it, so I went inside Windows configurations and put Ubuntu first, but I also set the time to 0 because I thought I could access Windows through Grub.\nBut what happens is that after I upgraded Ubuntu to 11.10, that screen with boot options don't show Windows 7 anymore.\nI went online searching for a solution to my problem, most of them told me to configure some Grub options and others to use programs to do it. I've done them all and still can't access Windows 7.\nJust in case my problem is not clear yet, this is how was my boot order before I messed it all up:\nWindows 7\nUbuntu\n\nwith a time of 10 secs to choose between both.\nThis is how I wanted it to be:\nUbuntu\nWindows 7\n\nwith 0 time to choose, but, inside Ubuntu I could access Windows through that Grub screen.\nBut this is what happens:\nUbuntu\nWindows 7\n\n0 time, so it don't let me choose anything and jumps inside Ubuntu then inside Ubuntu grub doesn't show up anymore (black screen) and it starts Ubuntu normally.\nI tried to fix this many times from different ways inside Ubuntu but nothing worked, also when I try do something and then upgrade my grub with sudo upgrade-grub it shows this message:\nGenerating grub.cfg ...\nFound Windows 7 (loader) on /dev/sda1\nSkipping Windows 7 (loader) on Wubi system\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.0.0-12-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.0.0-12-generic\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.38-12-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-2.6.38-12-generic\ndone\n\nThats why in the title I said it could probably be my WUBI messing all up.\nAnyone heave a solution for this?

I installed Berkeley's BOINC software in Windows and I loved it, however I'm having some problems using it in Ubuntu 12.04:\nOne of then is that the software doesn't appear in the systray, only in the Unity dock (left side), wich means that I can't see how it's working by passing the cursor over the icon on the systray like it's supposed to. Over that when BOINC is minimized on the unity Dock and I close the rest of the windows it automatically maximizes, wich is very annoying \nI hope this problems can be fixed, because I love to use this software, and knowing it's open-software it would be a shame it didn't run on Ubuntu like it should.\n\nA: Currently the official BOINC Manager does not have a systray icon under Linux. This is not Ubuntu's fault, Berkley itself simply does not provide such option. Years ago it had an -s option, for systray, but not anymore.\nYes, I also noticed the icon on Unity Launcher sometimes maximize itself. A bit annoying perhaps, but no big deal.\nA workaround, if you don't want the window to pop (or the icon on Launcher), is to exit the manager, while leaving the tasks running in background:\nBoinc Manager > File > Exit BOINC Manager (Ctrl+Q)\n\nIt will ask whether you want to also stop the tasks, and if you want to remember the decision. If you choose to leave the tasks running on background, they will show up if you run the Manager again.\nWarning: if you choose to stop the tasks when you exit the Manager, you will have to manually start the Boinc service before the Manager works again. You can simply reboot your PC or type in either terminal or Alt+F2:\ngksudo /etc/init.d/boinc-client start\n\nType in your password, and the Manager will work again.\nIf you set the Manager to remember the decision and you want to change it, you can do so by:\nBoinc Manager > Tools > Options > \"General\" tab \n\nAnd check \"Enable Manager exit dialog\"\nThis may mitigate any nuisances you may have with Boinc in Ubuntu.\nLast but not least, if you really want a systray icon, and you're felling adventurous, you can try this unofficial, unsupported and perhaps outdated systray app. You may also need to whitelist the icon. Of course, try at your own risk. \n", "Q: Can't use HG through a mounted directory I have a repository on my development server whose directory I have mounted using sshfs. I've synced up my uid/guid and seem to be able to execute/edit files as usual on said directory, as if I had just ssh'ed in. However, when I run a command like hg status, the process hangs and never returns to me the expected result. Is there any reason why mounting a directory like this would be much different than just sshing in and calling the same command?\nFor reference, the mounted filesystem is nfs, and the command I run is 'sshfs me@myserver:/home/me/repo /home/me/mnt/repo'\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Mercurial doesn't require any special form of access to the files, but (as you've found out), it will stat all the files when you run hg status. With a network filesystem this can take a long time.\nSince Mercurial is a distributed version control system, the basic assumption is that you'll be operation on a local repository, not a repository residing on a network filesytem. So you should always try to make a local clone and work on that.\n", "Q: How can I configure BOINC to start at startup? I can't get BOINC to start with the rest of the startup applications and the software itself doesn't have that option, I've been reading about it on Berkeley's forum but I can't get the answer, it appears the 12.04 version has a lot of errors that the previous version didn't. Is there a way to do it?\n\nA: I was wondering the same thing, but then yesterday used System Monitor, and there is a Process running (Einstein@Home IIRC, grinding away at some data), so the BOINC Manager doesn't have to be obviously running for BOINC to be happening. \nCheck that, you might be just fine!\n\nA: try with bum , a good startup manager .open your terminal and type this \nsudo apt-get install bum & sudo bum\n\nby selecting you can manage your startup services ,:D\nhope that helps\n", "Q: How exactly does Unity handle desktop files? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhere are the Unity Launcher .desktop files? \n\nI searched for a .desktop file for supermeatboy since it wasn't in /usr/share/applications/ .\nSo I used the Terminal:\nchocobai@desktoppc:/$ locate *.desktop | grep -iR \"meat\"\n/home/chocobai/.gnome/apps/supermeatboy_com-supermeatboy_1.desktop\n/home/chocobai/.local/share/applications/supermeatboy_com-supermeatboy_1.desktop\n/home/chocobai/.supermeatboygame/.mojosetup/supermeatboy_com-supermeatboy_1.desktop\n\nI guess the Installer did this because of backward compatibility.

But that never answered the question of how Unity handles (finds, searches) these files. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: \nwhich folders does it watch?\n\nUsually Unity searches  .desktop files in /usr/share/applications and ~/.local/share/applications. But there are other directories too containing .desktop files, such as /etc/xdg/autostart )\n\nWhy don't they need to be executeable?\n\nThose files need not to be executables because, those files contains instruction to execute other files. There is a line with Exec=..... to do the job.\n\nWhy isn't there only one folder like /usr/share/applications/ to hold .desktop files?\n\nBecause, it provide greater flexibility to seperate user programs and system programs. You can install softwares or have customized options for a specific software without harming all the other users or modifying default options.\nThe .desktop files in your home directory have higher priority than the files in system directories (such as /usr/share/applications). For this reason, if you customize a .desktop file to not to show in KDE menu creating a .desktop file in your home dir (~/.local/share/applications) with the same name, the option in your .desktop file will override the system option and that application won't be displayed on KDE menu.\n", "Q: Restore dnsmasq-base.

I have a machine with 4 partitions: \n\n\n*\n\n*sda1 - root\n\n*sda2 - swap\n\n*sda3 - tmp\n\n*sda4 - documents\n\n\nWhen I run the installation I don't want to repartition the disk. Now I read on http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/apbs01.html.en that it is not possible to use existing partitions. \nIf I can't, what do I have to state in the preseed file if I want to keep the sda4 partition because it contains personal data of the users? Any ideas? \n\nA: I had the same problem a while back and if you are also using the text based installer, \nlook at my post in the forums. \nThis solution will not work with the graphical installer.\nI explain how I managed to bypass partman during the installation by telling the installer to get a config file and my custom udeb that does the partitioning the way I want with only the disks I tell it to then continue with the rest of the installation.\nIn my case, one of the partitions is using LVM and the installer obtains the files from a usb disk.  I think getting them from a web server should be possible without too much work.   \nJust make sure you to backup your data before trying any of this.  \n\nA: I take it from the following statement:\nB.1.2. Limitations Although most questions used by debian-installer can be preseeded using this method, there are some notable exceptions. You must (re)partition an entire disk or use available free space on a disk; it is not possible to use existing partitions.\n...that the the preseed cannot pass arguments to the advanced partitioner.  In this case you would be better off just running the normal install from the LiveCD and when it asks how to install Ubuntu select \"other\" or \"do something else\".  This will take you to the advanced partitioner where you can select the install paritition for / (root filesystem).  If you don't do anything with the other partitions then the installer won't touch them - with the exception of swap.  If you don't set up the swap partition I think it will get set up in fstab anyway.\nIf this is a one-of there's really no need to use a preseed file.  Preseeding the installer is really for when you are doing many machines such as an Enterprise roll-out.  If this really is an enterprise roll-out then you would need to delete the partition on each machine that the root filesystem is on, so that you can preseed the correct value to use only available space.\n", "Q: sudo dpkg error - blank line in value of field 'Maintainer' I am running on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and am trying to install NX.

I need to know if there will be problems with installing it using Windows 8, and I need to know which installation size I should use? 4GB, 18GB, etc. \nAlso, is it possible to actually install it on a USB drive? The option was available in the installation, but I was not sure if it was safe or not. I would really appreciate some answers.\n\nA: The Wubi installer does not at this time support Windows 8.  Microsoft have changed the bootloader so it may take some time for the developers to change the Wubi installer.  They will certainly wait until after Windows 8 is released before they do much with it.\nBy all means do a full install onto a USB drive, as long as you can set the BIOS to boot off it.  Obviously, it's going to boot and run quite a bit slower than if it was on the SATA hard drive.\nYou could also set up a proper dual boot system, however the install will resize your Windows partition to make space for Ubuntu.  I strongly recommend that before you do this you defrag the NTFS partition and run chkdisk on it, and make a backup of all your important data. Resizing a partition and moving the data is never something you want to take lightly.\nAs far as the size is concerned, it really depends on what you want to do.  16Gb is more than enough to just try Ubuntu and do a bit of web browsing.  If you want to install lots of programmes and have a lot of data then 60+Gb would not be too unreasonable (but is getting a bit beyond what Wubi was intended for anyway).  If you want to edit movies or rip your DVD collection, then you are going to need hundreds of Gigabytes.\n", "Q: HDIO get identity failed for dev/sdb invalid argument This failure is on an external hard drive connected by USB.

It seems like all user input to the Dash home lens is send to Amazon by default in Ubuntu 12.10, is this correct? \n\nA: I do not believe Amazon will see every query in its original state since these queries are sent to productsearch.ubuntu.com and then continue on so your ip address is not reaching Amazon's API. However the other concern is how does Canonical handle these queries since they get them in the original form and have no issued a privacy policy explaining whether any search data is kept.\nIt is not unreasonable to think that Canonical keeps logs on all of its servers for some period of time and maybe even backups. \n\nA: Dash search terms are not sent to Amazon directly. They're sent to Canonical, which then sends them to Amazon. That means Amazon doesn't get your IP.\nHowever, as of the current implementation, thumbnail requests are directly sent to Amazon. So Amazon does get your IP in the end.\nMore details: https://perot.me/ubuntu-privacy-blunder-over-amazon-ads-continues\n\nA: They are proxying through productsearch.ubuntu.com with HTTPS encryption (though there's still a a heated bug discussion over whether the search should be included at all). Unfortunately, while no personally identifying information is sent to Amazon, the privacy policy for Ubuntu sharing information about proxied searches is still unclear.\nAlso, there are concerns that the image thumbnails of results that users download could allow Amazon to correlate queries to IP addresses.\nShuttleworth also wrote a blog post that tries to address the privacy issues with this feature.\n\nA: That is correct.

I am setting up a notebook for software demo purpose. The machine has a Intel Core i7 CPU,  8GB RAM, a 128GB SSD, and runs Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64bit desktop.  As it is, the SSD is configured to have a single volume group, with /boot, /swap, and / all in their respective logical volume. They collectively consume 30GB space.  I plan to use the remaining for logical volumes for KVM guests, all run Ubuntu 12.04 Server\nI would like to ensure that the SSD is utilized optimally.  Although on this site, there are some great info about setting up TRIM support for file system setups that do not involve LVM, I have not found explicit guide regarding my planned setup.  \nI did found this page which talks about adding issue_discards in /etc/lvm/lvm.conf. But in said file on my machine, I didn't find the cited content. I double-checked man lvm.conf(5), didn't see any mentioning of this option either. \nThus, I'm not sure what to do.  Furthermore, even say adding the option is the right thing to do, should I in my machine's /etc/fstab still add mount options such as noatime etc? \nAny tips, pointers, and/or further guidance are greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I backported LVM 2.02.95 to Ubuntu 12.04 and put it in a ppa.

The only effect is has is when you actually modify your LVM (e.g. shrinking or removing logical volumes). But regular users usually do not do this at all.\nThis setting is recommended for those who are for example provisioning virtual machines on LVM volume groups and delete them often. Otherwise you do not need that. For more info go to lvm.conf man page. This is from RHEL 6.2 LVM Administration Guide:\n\nThe Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 release supports the issue_discards\n  parameter in the lvm.conf configuration file.

I accidentally deleted everything in /usr/bin typing in the command rm -rf *. \nI don't know what is mounting and would like to learn but at this point I think the only way left for me is to re install everything. Please let me know the ways to re install everything now. It would be of great help to me. \n\nA: Since you just installed today, do the installation again. While you can recover from this, it'll be a lot more work than redoing the installation.\nTo recover from the deletion of /usr/bin, you would need to reinstall all the packages that have files in that directory. You can use this command to list the affected packages:\ncd /var/lib/dpkg/info\ngrep -l '^/usr/bin/' *.list | sed 's/\\.list$//'\n\nYou'll then need to find some way of downloading the packages without relying on any of the deleted programs. Since you've deleted dpkg, the low-level package installation utility, you'll need to obtain it from somewhere first. Grab it from some other machine running the same release Ubuntu, or download the dpkg package on another machine and extract the programs from it. You'll need not just /usr/bin/dpkg but also all the other programs in that package, including update-alternatives and all the programs named /usr/bin/dpkg-*. Again, copying might be tricky with so many programs deleted, so you may need to reboot to a rescue CD/USB to do it.\nOnce you have the dpkg suite, download at least the dpkg and apt package somehow, perhaps on another machine or in a still-running web browser.\nThen install apt manually with the command\ndpkg -i /path/to/apt_0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.2.deb\n\nIf you get errors about missing commands, reinstall the corresponding packages first. Then reinstall all the affected packages:\napt-get --reinstall install $(grep -l '^/usr/bin/' *.list | sed 's/\\.list$//')\n\nAgain, in your situation, just do a complete reinstallation.\n\nA: /usr/bin/ contains most of the programs that are installed on your system.\nJust installing Ubuntu again would be the easiest and fastest way to get a working system again.\n\nA: You could maybe export this directory from another computer through NFS? Yes, this is very ugly and you should just reinstall.\nAnyway:\nmount should still work, because\nls /usr/bin | grep mount\n\ndidn't give me anything besides grub-mount. So just copying relevant files from a mounted directory might work temporarily. Just remember, sudo will not work, use su.\n\nA: Nothing really hard if this is a vm:\n\n\n*\n\n*save the list of packages you had installed\ncd /var/lib/dpkg/info\ngrep -l '^/usr/bin/' *.list | sed 's/\\.list$//' > ~/packs.txt\n\n\n*Install the same OS version (i386 or amd64) on a new VM\n\n*On the fresh machine do\ncd /var/lib/dpkg/info\ngrep -l '^/usr/bin/' *.list | sed 's/\\.list$//' > ~/packs2.txt\n\n\n*copy the content of packs.txt on the new system and you can do:\ninstall=$(diff -c ~/packs2.txt ~/packs.txt | grep \"^- \" | cut -d' ' -f2 | xargs echo )\napt-get install -y --force-yes $install\nremove=$(diff -c ~/packs2.txt ~/packs.txt | grep \"^+ \" | cut -d' ' -f2 | xargs echo )\napt-get purge -y --force-yes $remove\n\n\n*Now the new system has the same content /usr/bin of your damaged machine\n\n*mount the disk of your broken machine into the new one and finally:\nrsync -av /usr/bin /mnt/usr/bin\n\nprofit\n\nA: Had the same foolish problem... here is what I have done to get everything working again:\n1. Like in the answer of @Gilles, make a list of your packages:\ncd /var/lib/dpkg/info\ngrep -l '^/usr/bin/' *.list | sed 's/\\.list$//' > ~/my_packages1.txt\n\n2. Insert a Live CD with the same Ubuntu version, boot from that and copy your /usr/bin directory. The partition with Ubuntu on my hard disk was mounted, so that is as easy as\ncp -R /usr/bin /media/something/usr/bin\n\n3. Now I couldn't use sudo or pkexec, because I got the error message must be owned by uid 0 and have the setuid bit set. So I had to change that, by booting from GRUB into a root shell. (See here how to do this and on this german site for some pics.)

I have a program which I am trying to run, however when I run it; it just complains that it can't find a particular file.\nHowever I have no idea which folder it is trying to find this particular file in. I have a copy of the required file, I just need to know which folder to copy it too.\nIs there any way to show in real time which files are being accessed or which files are trying and failing to be accessed?\nI am using Ext4 filesystem if that helps.\nThanks\n\nA: Easiest way to do this seems to be to run the program through strace and watch for stat64() calls (which get file info) or open() calls which open files.\nSo you do:\nstrace -e stat64 -e open [program name]\n\nAnd in the resulting output look for:\n(No such file or directory)\nThe path it was trying to open should be to the left of this error.\n\nA: (I first posted my answer at this askubuntu question, but removed it from there and posted it here, as it is more relevant.)\nThere are several ways you can investigate what files and libraries processes have opened; the main tools are lsof, strace and ltrace. Sometimes it is necesary to run them with sudo, so the program has access to everything it needs to gain an accurate snapshot of what a program is calling.\n1) With lsof you need to find the process id you want to query, so use, for example:\nlsof -c firefox\n\nwhich will list all the files firefox has open and all its calls to system shared libraries. (Firefox currently has a pid of 3310 on my system, so you could also use lsof -p 3310, but you would have had to look up the process id first with ps aux | grep [f]irefox\n ). More information on lsof is detailed in this useful IBM article.\n2) ltrace and strace have very similar functions and options, and are very useful for finding out detailed information about what calls a process is making. The main difference is that ltrace usually only traces library calls (although it can trace system calls with the -S option), while strace traces both library and other system calls. More information on tracing processes is available in this IBM article. Lsof is probably more useful for you if you want to examine an already running process but strace can also do this and monitor the calls in real time when given a process pid (sudo is always used when one attaches to a process): \nsudo strace -p 3310\n\nbut it is much more useful to launch the program with strace and see what was called, as in the following example:\nstrace -f -e trace=open /usr/bin/firefox\n\nYou can just run strace with the target process and no options, but the switches here mean that child processes are traced (-f) and that all open system calls are traced (-e trace=open) \nIf you want to save the output to file you can specify -o ~/firefox.trace before specifying /usr/bin/firefox.\nIf you want a summary list of library calls, for example, you could use\nltrace -c /usr/bin/leafpad\n\nand then exit the program and the list would be produced. Omit the -c option to view the calls in real time. \nThe results from strace and ltrace may not be greatly useful to you, as they are difficult to decipher unless you know what you are looking for, but lsof should provide some basic useful information. \n", "Q: Mouse permanently stuck on left side of screen One of my two monitors is died, so while my computer was turned off I unplugged the dead monitor then turned my computer back on.

I am looking at this: \nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu\nI need to create a boot disk to test Ubuntu to make sure it will run on a PC (Compaq Mini CQ10-120LA) I was given. I can create the boot disk off of a Mac (in English) or Windows (but Windows is in Spanish and foreign to me). \nQuestions:  \n\n\n*\n\n*What format do I choose for the USB stick? (I wish the instructions stated this).\n\n*What is Dash? (Will I know when I run the installer?)\n\n*Can I do this from a Mac or Windows computer? Or only from Ubuntu? \n\nA: Windows\nThe instructions for preparing an Ubuntu live USB on Windows are found at the official Ubuntu How to create a bootable USB stick... webpage (see the step-by-step instructions below). The USB flash drive that you use to make an Ubuntu live USB must be 2GB or larger. For Ubuntu 18.04 and later the USB flash drive should be 4GB or larger.\n\n*\n\n*Open Rufus and select your USB stick in the Device dropdown menu.\n\n\n\n*Click the CD-ROM icon next to the FreeDOS dropdown menu, then find your downloaded Ubuntu ISO and click Open and then Start.\n\n\n\n*Click Yes when it asks to download Syslinux software.\n\n\n\n*Click OK to write in ISO Image mode.\n\n\n\n*Confirm that your USB stick is selected and then click OK to continue. It is very important to verify that the device that you are installing the Ubuntu live USB to is indeed your flash drive, so that you don't overwrite any of your system or personal files which may make your operating system unbootable.\n\n\n\n*When it is finished, just restart your computer and start using Ubuntu, or you can install Ubuntu.\n\nIn order to enable your computer to boot from the USB flash drive, you must enter your BIOS/UEFI setup utility by pressing one of these keys: Delete, F2 or F10 as soon as the motherboard splash screen appears when the computer is booting. In the BIOS/UEFI menu, you need to change the boot order so that the USB flash drive, which is usually called USB-HDD in newer computers, is the first entry in the boot sequence, and then save your new settings and exit the setup utility.\nMac\n\n*\n\n*You will need:\n\n*\n\n*A 4GB or larger USB stick/flash drive\n\n*An Apple computer or laptop running macOS\n\n*An Ubuntu ISO file. See Get Ubuntu for download links\n\n\n\n*To ensure maximum compatibility with Apple hardware, first blank and reformat the USB stick using Apple's \"Disk Utility\", but this step can be skipped if you intend to use the USB stick with only generic PC hardware.\n\n*\n\n*Launch Disk Utility from Applications -> Utilities or Spotlight search.\n\n\n*Insert your USB stick and observe the new device added to Disk Utility.\n\n\n*Select the USB stick device (you may need to enable the option View -> Show All Devices) and select Erase from the toolbar (or right-click menu).\n\n\n*Set the format to MS-DOS (FAT) and the scheme to GUID Partition Map.\n\n\n*Check you've chosen the correct device and click Erase.\n\nWarning: Disk Utility needs to be used with caution as selecting the wrong device or partition can result in data loss.\n\n\n*Install and run Etcher\nTo write the ISO file to the USB stick, use a free and open source application called Etcher. After downloading this and clicking to mount the package, Etcher can either be run in place or dragged into your Applications folder.\nBy default, recent versions of macOS block the running of applications from unidentified developers. To side-step this issue, enable App Store and identified developers in the Security & Privacy pane -> General tab of System Preferences. If you are still warned against running the application, click Open Anyway in the same pane.\n\n\n\n*Etcher configuration\nEtcher will configure and write to your USB device in three stages, each of which needs to be selected in turn:\n\n*\n\n*Select image will open a file requester from which should navigate to and select the ISO file downloaded previously. By default, the ISO file will be in your Downloads folder.\n\n\n*Select drive, replaced by the name of your USB device if one is already attached, lets you select your target device. You will be warned if the storage space is too small for your selected ISO.\n\n\n*Flash! will activate when both the image and the drive have been selected. As with Disk Utility, Etcher needs low-level access to your storage hardware and will ask for your password after selection.\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n*Write to device\nAfter entering your password, Etcher will start writing the ISO file to your USB device.\nThe Flash stage of the process will show progress, writing speed and an estimated duration until completion. This will be followed by a validation stage that will ensure the contents of the USB device are identical to the source image.\nWhen everything has finished, Etcher will declare the process a success.\nCongratulations! You now have Ubuntu on a USB stick, bootable and ready to go.\n\nWarning: After the write process has completed, macOS may inform you that 'The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer'. Don't select Initialize. Instead, select Eject and remove the USB device.\n\n\n*Boot your Mac\nIf you want to use your USB stick with an Apple Mac, you will need to restart or power-on the Mac with the USB stick inserted while the Option/alt ⌥ key is pressed.\nThis will launch Apple's 'Startup Manager' which shows bootable devices connected to the machine. Your USB stick should appear as gold/yellow and labelled 'EFI Boot'. Selecting this will lead you to the standard Ubuntu boot menu.\n\nSource: Create a bootable USB stick on macOS\n\nA: You don't need a USB bootable to test if Ubuntu works on your PC. You can use a live cd for that.\nbut if you want to learn how to make bootable USB check these links:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nand yes you can do it in windows and in Mac\n\nA: The instruction on that page is for existing Ubuntu users. You can't do the same from Windows.\nIf you want to try Ubuntu for the first time, (No Ubuntu installed) you need to use a Windows tool to make your USB disk bootable with Ubuntu. See this section of the help page. It is for Windows users. If you are a MAC user, you should visit this page\n\n1) What format do I choose for the USB stick?\n\nAssuming you are referring the  filesystem type, I suggest using Fat or Fat32 filesystem. The Windows tool automatically uses this format.\n\n2) What is Dash? (Will I know when I run the installer?)\n\nDash is a modern and visually appealing replacement of traditional menu system. It is included in Unity. You can see this in action, if you \"Try Ubuntu\" before installation using the Live CD/USB.\n\n3) Can I do this from a Mac or Windows computer? Or only from Ubuntu? \n\nAssuming you are referring to make a bootable USB, You can do this from Mac or Windows. You don't need to have Ubuntu for trying Ubuntu. This doesn't make good sense.\nHope this answer will help.\nSee this links:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GraphicalInstall\n\n*Unity\n\n*Unity user interface - Wikipedia Article\n\nA: Etcher is a good cross Platform tool to burn .iso files to usb\nyou can download it from here good luck.\n\nA: I have the best solution for you:\nfast, easy and non-complicated\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the tool from:\nPen Drive Linux\n\n*Open it up, choose the ubuntu version, browse for the ISO file, choose you flash drive, and click GO\nAfter few seconds you will find your Flash Drive name has changed to PENDRIVE and it became bootable!!!\nJust boot from it and yay!\nIMPORTANT: PEN DRIVE LINUX DOES NOT REMOVE FILES IN FLASH DRIVE, BUT YOU SHOULD BACKUP!\n", "Q: How to allocate more ram to minecraft?

I want to clear all previous commands from the history of my server. I used history -c and it seems all things are cleared but when I ssh to the server, all the commands are still there.\nHow can I clear them permanently?\n\nA: execute the following commands to clear history forever\nhistory -c && history -w\n\ngood luck!\n\nA: rm ~/.bash_history; history -c; logout\n\nNow log back in and witness that your arrow-up doesn't give you anything.\n\nA: The file ~/.bash_history holds the history.\nTo clear the bash history completely on the server, open terminal and type\ncat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history\n\nOther alternate way is to link ~/.bash_history to /dev/null\nHowever,\nOne annoying side-effect is that the history entries has a copy in the memory and it will flush back to the file when you log out.\nTo workaround this, use the following command (worked for me):\ncat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history && history -c && exit\n\n\nA: What to do:\nIn every open bash shell (you may have multiple terminals open):\nhistory -c\nhistory -w\n\nWhy:\nAs noted above, history -c empties the file ~/.bash_history. It is important to note that bash shell does not immediately flush history to the bash_history file. So, it is important to (1) flush the history to the file, and (2) clear the history, in all terminals. That's what the commands above do.\nReference: http://www.giannistsakiris.com/index.php/2007/09/13/how-to-clear-bash-history-and-what-to-watch-out-for/\n\nA: There's another much simpler one: running history -c on the terminal prompt and gone are all entries in the bash_history file.\n\nA: Clear the current shell's history:\nhistory -c\n\nWhen you log out, your current shell's history is appended to ~/.bash_history, which is a cache of previous shells' histories, to a maximum number (see HISTFILESIZE in \"man bash\").\nIf you want to remove the history altogether, then you essentially have to empty out ~/.bash_history which many of the above entries have suggested.  Such as:\nhistory -c && history -w\n\nThis clears the current shell's history and then forces the current shell's history (empty) to overwrite ~/.bash_history....or to be more accurate, it forces it to overwrite HISTFILE (which defaults to ~/.bash_history).\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Another way to do this is deleting the ~/.bash_history file by using rm ~/.bash_history command. When you login another time, the .bash_history file will be automatically created.\n\nA: Try this one\nedit your .profile and add the line below at the end of the file\nrm -f .bash_history\n\nthis way, every time you login, it will delete your .bash_history file automatically for you. Adding the -r recursive remove option seems dangerous and not needed.\n\nA: If you want the history not to be saved in the first place, you should add this to your ~/.profile:\nunset HISTFILE\n\nThat's it.\nAll new invocations of bash (if you re-login) will not log anything. After that you can delete the old ~/.bash_history file as well if you want.\n", "Q: Recent update killed unity 3d launcher I am scratching my head on this one, a lot of things are still new to me.\nI updated 126 packages just now through the update manager, and upon reboot everything works fine except the unity launcher.

I want to know why to use workspaces. I have seen many people using it but I don't know why to use it. Can anyone tell me why?\n\nA: I use it when I want to see two windows together at time, then I put this two windows in one desktop and when I click one, I see both. For example, Skype, I need to see the chat window and the video window at the same time, so I don't click one and the another one after, just I go to that desktop.\n\nA: I'm sure everybody has their own ways of using workspaces. As for me, if I'm making a presentation or typing a document, I like to open documents/pictures in one workspace, play music through Banshee in another workspace, and have Chrome ready in a third workspace in case I need to look up some information. I felt that workspaces were useless/overkill for a long time, but once I started using them, I realised they're actually quite handy.\n\nA: I've been using workspaces since the mid 90s and I can tell you that if you are using them to simply separate different apps you are doing it wrong. You already have dock icons to switch between apps.\nWorkspaces are a killer features when you organise them by projects or tasks. Usually I keep the first workspace for Skype, e-mail and general web browsing. The other workspaces are used for one task or project each. I usually have a web browser window in each workspace containing all the browser tabs related to the task.  Along with this browser window there are the other apps such as development environment, text editors, nautilus folders and terminals related to the task.\nIf I'm doing some image editing for example, I open in a workspace, the image editing programs, nautilus folders and a web browser window containing tabs with research related to the artwork I'm making. If I need to switch to programming, I just change workspace and I get all my programming related apps and browser tabs. I can then come back to my image editing stuff by changing workspace again.\nSometimes I put a project aside for a few days and I keep all the related programs and browser tabs opened. If someone calls me to ask a question about the project I set aside, I can switch to its workspace, lookup some stuff for them, and go back to what I was doing before in a few seconds.\n\nA: I use them for switching from one application to another with shortcuts. Instead of scrolling through open apps with Alt+tab, I can just switch to the workspace where the desired app is supposed to be. For example, when I am working with the browser and want to write an e-mail, I know (or rather: my fingertips know, because it is hardly a cognitive process anymore) that my e-mail app is in the workspace on the left of the browser's so I just switch there.\nHowever, that would not seem advantageous to me if I used the default shortcut for switching workspaces (Ctrl+Alt+arrow) since I would have to use both hands for that. That is why I changed it to Ctrl+arrow. My right hand got so used to it that it moves me around the workspaces very fast.\n\nA: Workspaces help by uncluttering your main desktop and allowing you to run programs on each workspace instead...  Imagine web browsing on your main workspace while workspace 2 has your music player and workspace 3 has an important spreadsheet on screen ready for you...\n\nA: It is a great tool for multitasking\n", "Q: genisoimage and exec bit preservation Maybe I'm just not doing right, but I can't seem to get genisoimage to\nproduce a UDF image and preserve the exec bit.\n$ genisoimage --version\ngenisoimage 1.1.11 (Linux)\n\n$ echo \"echo 'Hello world'\" > script.sh\n\n$ chmod +x script.sh\n\n$ ./script.sh \nHello world\n\n$ genisoimage -input-charset utf-8 -r -udf -volid minimal -o minimal.iso script.sh \nTotal translation table size: 0\nTotal rockridge attributes bytes: 250\nTotal directory bytes: 0\nPath table size(bytes): 10\nMax brk space used 0\n420 extents written (0 MB)\n\n$ mkdir mount\n$ sudo mount minimal.iso $PWD/mount -o ro,loop -t udf\n\n$ ls -l script.sh mount/script.sh \n-r--r--r-- 1 root root 19 Sep 21 18:40 mount/script.sh\n-rwxrwxr-x 1 kip  kip  19 Sep 21 18:40 script.sh\n\nYou'll note in the last command that script.sh was executable at the\ntime it was injected into the image, but does not appear to be inside of\nthe mounted image.\nIs this a bug in genisoimage, a problem with the way I am mounting the\nimage, or a problem in my usage of genisoimage?\n\nA: One potential problem with your command line may be the -udf option. Here is what the manual says:\n\nInclude  UDF filesystem support in the generated filesystem image.  UDF support is currently in alpha status and for this reason, it is not possible to create UDF-only images.  UDF data structures are currently coupled to the Joliet structures, so  there  are  many pitfalls with the current implementation. There is no UID/GID support, there is no POSIX permission support, there is no support for symlinks.\n\nEDIT: this is definitely the problem. If the image is created with\ngenisoimage -input-charset utf-8 -r -volid minimal -o minimal.iso script.sh\n\nthen the script.sh is executable (actually even -r-xr-xr-x, because the -r option propagates the executable bit on files).

How does the ubuntu user on the AWS images for Ubuntu Server 12.04 have passwordless sudo for all commands when there is no configuration for it in /etc/sudoers?\nI'm using Ubuntu server 12.04 on Amazon. I want to add a new user that has the same behavior as the default Ubuntu user. Specifically I want passwordless sudo for this new user. \nSo I've added a new user and went to edit /etc/sudoers (using visudo of course). From reading that file it seemed like the default ubuntu user was getting it's passwordless sudo from being a member of the admin group. So I added my new user to that. Which didn't work. Then I tried adding the NOPASSWD directive to sudoers. Which also didn't work. \nAnyway, now I'm just curious. How does the ubuntu user get passwordless privileges if they aren't defined in /etc/sudoers. What is the mechanism that allows this?\n\nA: I would create my own file under /etc/sudoers.d/ directory - the file created by Amazon Cloud might be overwritten in case of any update. After creating your file in /etc/sudoers.d, add this entry,\n<your user name> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\n\nReboot the system and this will work.\n\nA: Short answer without using any editor (tested on bash, very risky to execute on remote hosts).\nConfigure sudo to work without a password for the current user:\necho \"$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\" | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers\n\nCheck the edit with:\nsudo visudo -c\n\nVerify if you can use sudo without a password:\nsudo cat /etc/sudoers | grep \"$USER\"\n\n...or simply try it with:\nsudo <anything>\n\nA: Okay, I have discovered the answer so may as well put it here for completeness. At the end of /etc/sudoers there is what I thought was just a comment:\n#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\n\nHowever this actually includes the contents of that directory. Inside of which is the file \n/etc/sudoers.d/90-cloudimg-ubuntu. Which has the expected contents\n# ubuntu user is default user in cloud-images.\n# It needs passwordless sudo functionality.\nubuntu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\n\nSo that is where the sudo configuration for the default ubuntu user lives.\nYou should edit this file using visudo. The following command will let you edit the correct file with visudo. \nsudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/90-cloudimg-ubuntu\n\nAnd add a line like:\naychedee ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\n\nAt the end.\n\nA: As I was researching this, I realized that there's a line in the /etc/sudoers file that is not a comment, but a directive that makes any file or folder under the directory /etc/sudoers/* override the contents of /etc/sudoers.\nThis is a sneaky little directive, as it appears to be a commented line upon first glance. It looks like this:\n#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\n\nThis is how I've implemented the non-root, passwordless user in an ephemeral Docker Image for use in a CICD pipeline with the base image of ubuntu:18.04:\nRUN \\\n  useradd -U foo -m -s /bin/bash -p foo -G sudo && passwd -d foo && passwd -d root && \\\n  sed -i /etc/sudoers -re 's/^%sudo.*/%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL/g' && \\\n  sed -i /etc/sudoers -re 's/^root.*/root ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL/g' && \\\n  sed -i /etc/sudoers -re 's/^#includedir.*/## Removed the #include directive! ##\"/g' && \\\n  echo \"Customized the sudoers file for passwordless access!\" && \\\n  echo \"foo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\" >> /etc/sudoers && \\\n  echo \"root ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\" >> /etc/sudoers && \\\n  echo \"foo user:\";  su foo -c 'whoami && id' && \\\n  echo \"root user:\"; su root -c 'whoami && id'\n\nWhat happens with the above code:\n\n\n*\n\n*The user and group foo is created.\n\n*The user foo is added to the both the foo and sudo group.\n\n*The home directory is set to /home/foo. \n\n*The shell is set to /bin/bash.\n\n*The passwords for both foo and root are deleted.\n\n*The sed command does inline updates to the /etc/sudoers file to allow foo and root users passwordless access to the sudo command.\n\n*The sed command disables the #includedir directive that would allow any files in subdirectories to override these inline updates. \n\n\nA: I found that the most straight forward thing to do, in order to easily replicate this behavior across multiple servers, was the following:\nsudo visudo\n\nChange this line:\n# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges\n%admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nto this line:\n# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges\n%admin  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\n\nAnd move it under this line:\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\nyou should now have this:\n# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.\n#\n# Please consider adding local content in /etc/sudoers.d/ instead of\n# directly modifying this file.\n#\n# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.\n#\n\nDefaults        env_reset\nDefaults        mail_badpass\nDefaults        secure_path=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\"\n\n# Host alias specification\n\n# User alias specification\n\n# Cmnd alias specification\n\n# User privilege specification\nroot    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges\n%admin  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\n\n# See sudoers(5) for more information on \"#include\" directives:\n\n#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\n\nthen for every user that needs sudo access WITH a password:\nsudo adduser <user> sudo\n\nand for every user that needs sudo access WITH NO password:\nsudo adduser <user> admin\n\n(on older versions of ubuntu, you may need to):\nsudo service sudo restart\n\nAnd that's it!\nEdit: You may have to add the admin group as I don't think it exists by default.\nsudo groupadd admin\n\nYou can also add the default AWS ubuntu user to the admin group via this command:\nsudo usermod ubuntu -g admin\n\nNote: As @hata mentioned, you may need to use adm as your admin group name, depending on which version of Ubuntu is being used.\n", "Q: Is there a way to disable a particular PCI port?

I want to know that what are differences in behavior of a daemon, process and service running in Ubuntu.\n\nA: *\n\n*A daemon is a background, non-interactive program. It is detached from the keyboard and display of any interactive user. The word daemon for denoting a background program is from the Unix culture; it is not universal.\n\n*A service is a program which responds to requests from other programs over some inter-process communication mechanism (usually over a network). A service is what a server provides. For example, the NFS port mapping service is provided as a separate portmap service, which is implemented as the portmapd daemon. \nA service doesn't have to be a daemon, but usually is.  A user application with a GUI could have a service built into it: for instance, a file-sharing application. Another example is the X Window service, which is anything but in the background: it takes over your screen, keyboard and pointing device. It is a service because it responds to requests from applications (to create and manipulate windows, et cetera), which can even be elsewhere on the network. But the X service also responds to your every keystroke and mouse movement.\n\n*A process is one or more threads of execution together with their shared set of resources, the most important of which are the address space and open file descriptors. A process creates an environment for these threads of execution which looks like they have an entire machine all to themselves: it is a virtual machine.\nInside a process, the resources of other processes, and of the kernel, are invisible and not directly accessible (at least not to a thread which is executing user-space code). For example, there is no way to refer to the open files of another process, or their memory space; it is as if those things do not even exist.  \nThe process, and its relation to the kernel and other processes, perhaps constitutes the most important abstraction in Unix-like operating systems. The resources of the system are compartmentalized into processes, and nearly everything is understood as happening inside one process or another.\n\nA: Daemons - Daemon does not stand for Disk and Execution Monitor (http://www.takeourword.com/TOW146/page4.html). They are the processes which run in the background and are not interactive. They have no controlling terminal. \nThey perform certain actions at predefined times or in response to certain events. In *NIX, the names of daemons end in d.\nServices - In Windows, daemons are called services.\nIf you're wondering why *NIX has a command named service, it is just used to run init scripts (shorthand for initialization scriptrunlevel).\nProcess - Process is a running program. At a particular instant of time, it can be either running, sleeping, or zombie (completed process, but waiting for it's parent process to pick up the return value).\nSources and further information:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.linfo.org/daemon.html\n\n*http://kb.iu.edu/data/aiau.html\n\n*http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/daemon.html\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_%28computing%29\n\n*http://www.linux-tutorial.info/modules.php?name=MContent&pageid=84\n", "Q: why does Chromium show version 18 even after an update? \nPossible Duplicate:\nDoes someone know why the Chromium daily package isn't build anymore? \n\nI updated Chromium in 12.04 with apt-get from the official repositories and chromium-browser --version say Chromium 20.0.1132.47 Ubuntu 12.04. but \"About Chromium\" from the browser itself say 18.0.1025.168 (Developer Build 134367 Linux) Ubuntu 12.04\nwhy is that ? \nhow can I update Chromium ?\n\nA: Try sudo apt-get purge chromium-browser then sudo apt-get install chromium-browser and then try again.\n", "Q: dist-update kernel failed?

I've wrote this command line: \"if [ \"$DESKTOP_SESSION\" == \"gnome-shell\" ]; then (unity-2d-shell) ; fi\". If I type it into a terminal then the 2D unity launcher would start and would work like a charm on top of the gnome-shell, however, if I add the line to the startup applications, it would have no effect. Is there something wrong with the command line? Or is it just impossible to run the launcher on startup?\n\nA: The line you have wrote is technically a shell script, not a single command. GNOME's startup applications list does not run a shell for each line item, it just invokes it as a single command. If you really want to run unity-2d over gnome-shell (which is basically not the best idea - see below) you have to make an executable script file out of your line, and run this script from startup applications.\nHowever, mixing these two puts you to a dangerous path. GNOME gets updated (unity-2d - not anymore, apparently), and the two shells may start interfering with each other at any upgrade even though now, according to your experience, they work great. One of possible problems I may imagine is that the two panels will start stacking unpredictably, or hide each other. Another is that some applications are also checking the desktop environment they are running in, and the presence of two shells may confuse them. Consider using GNOME extensions instead.\n", "Q: Icons don't display for some application launchers I am running Ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop for some time now.

Is there a way to encrypt a folder, which is not in Home (/home/user/) but even in a different partition, so only my user can access/read contained files?\nAlternatively, I would like to understand if it is possible to turn a complete ext4 partition into an encrypted volume, which would be mounted at user login.\nIf possible, I would like to make the change without reinstalling Ubuntu.\nMy PC has (mount output):\n/dev/sda1 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro)\n/dev/sda3 on /home type ext4 (rw)\n/dev/sda4 on /home/igor/Personale type ext4 (rw)\n\nsda4 is the partition containing folders I would like to protect.\n\nA: Sure. You can use enfcs, for example, to create an encrypted folder anywhere. Install encfs with sudo apt-get install encfs.\nmkdir /path/to/encrypted\nmkdir /path/do/decrypted\nencfs /path/to/encrypted /path/to/decrypted\n\nWhen run on a given encrypted directory for the first time, encfs will take you through setting the password and encryption options.\nTo unmount the encrypted folder, type\nfusermount -u /path/to/decrypted\n\nTo mount the encrypted directory again, type the same command you used to encrypt it:\nencfs /path/to/encrypted /path/to/decrypted\n\nNote that encryption is quite different from Unix permissions (\"only my user can access...\"). In short, any person and only a person with the credentials (password to the encrypted directory) can decrypt it. That is rather the point of it, because anyone with physical access to your machine can become root, and consequently -- also any user, including you. It is as simple as booting the computer with a live cd or taking out the drive and connecting it to another system.\n\nA: You can also use LUKS to make an encrypted container which can be used. This has the added effect of being more secure, only the passphrase will open the container. Here is an example:\n\nCreate crypto container, loop, and device\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*dd if=/dev/urandom of=/mnt/sdcard/loop1.img bs=1M count=128\n  \n*losetup /dev/block/loop1 /mnt/sdcard/loop1.img\n  \n*cryptsetup -c aes-plain luksFormat /dev/block/loop1\n  \n*cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/block/loop1 cpt1\n  \n*mkfs.ext2 /dev/mapper/cpt1\n  \n*mkdir /mnt/sdcard/safe\n  \n*mount /dev/mapper/cpt1 /mnt/sdcard/safe\n\n\nA: eCryptfs would be a good choice (Ubuntu encrypted home directory uses ecryptfs) if you want to encrypt /dev/sda4 which is mounted as /home/igor/Personale type ext4\nYou don't have to re-install anyway. ecryptfs is flexible (you can encrypt folders or partitions) and easy to use, it is layered on top of the current file system - ext4 in your case. Basically you have a partition/block device, create file system and mount it, then use ecryptfs to encrypt it. \nIn your case, it's /dev/sda4, to encrypt it\nNOTE: although this process retains existing data I strongly recommend backing up to a different partition or external HDD. Because later on we need to copy it back to get data encrypted (existing data won't get encrypted).\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*install ecryptfs-utils package 1st\nsudo apt-get install ecryptfs-utils\n\n\n*mount the destination directory as ecryptfs (suppose /dev/sda4 already mounted on /home/igor/Personale)\nmount -t ecryptfs /home/igor/Personale /home/igor/Personale\n\nNOTE: You will be prompted for pass phrase, cipher, key bytes, plaintext passthrough (y/n), filename encryption (y/n).\nDone. Existing data won't be encrypted anyway, you can delete existing data and copy if from backup (that's why I recommended backing up, a data swap is needed to activate encryption on existing files). Use rsync for backup/restore:\n    rsync -axHAX /backup /home/igor/Personale\n\nBTW: you can see the encrypted partition use findmnt or mount, e.g\n/home/terry/topsecret on /home/terry/topsecret type ecryptfs (rw,ecryptfs_sig=633937dbcf1fef34,ecryptfs_cipher=aes,ecryptfs_key_bytes=16,ecryptfs_unlink_sigs)\n", "Q: Disabling Auto/Dwell Click doesn't work in ubuntu 12.04 I have unchecked all the dwell click options in gconf (configuration editor) but still auto click is enabled, teasing me.

The problem is multifaceted.\nThe sane package has changed a lot. The lib location is changed.\nYou need to use dpkg -L to check if your package installed the libs into wrong places. For example /usr/lib/sane.  If this is true, cd to that location then:\n# ln -sfr /usr/lib/sane/libsane-epkowa* /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane\n\nSince the po's scanner still working under root, he should not had this problem.\nthe new ubuntu updated the scanner policy.\nNow a user need to be in saned and scanner group to use scanner. However, just add yourself to those group is not enough. Your scanner has to be properly owned by the scanner group. Otherwise, even you change the device permission to mode 777, it still need root to use scanner. Here is how you can automatically change the scanner's group during hotplugin.\nCreate a rule for the device\n/etc/udev/rules.d $ cat 80-scanner.rules \n# change device EPSON owner group\nATTRS{manufacturer}==\"EPSON\", DRIVERS==\"usb\", SUBSYSTEMS==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"04b8\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"0142\", GROUP=\"scanner\"\n\nTest the rule\nuse udevadm control –reload to load your rule.\nuse lsusb to find your device /dev path\nto check if your rule is functioning, test with the follow command:\n# udevadm test $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/bus/usb/<bus>/<device>) 2>&1 | grep -i group --color\n\nIf your rule is correct you should see the group changed to scanner from root.\nFinally, disconnect your scanner and reconnect it. Then try follow commands without sudo\n$ sane-find-scanner\n$ scanimage -L\n\nYour scanner should functioning correctly\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 installation stuck on 'where do you live' using CD I am trying to install my first linux software, Ubuntu 12.04. \nI got an iso image of Ubuntu 12.04 from a PC magazine DVD. I first burned it using ImgBurn on a clean new CD-RW. Then I deleted a 40 GB partition to make it free. I booted from the CD, Ubuntu came up, I selected the install option, followed by the install along windows 7 option.\nThe installer did not ask me to slide partitions. It said copying files and then showed me a screen where I can select my area of residence. I selected this area and pressed the continue button. after which the mouse icon keeps on spinning busy. It keeps spinning even after the copying files is completed and the same world map is displayed. I can move, do all other things on the ubuntu, like going to settings menu and so on, but this installation window doesn't seem to progress at all.\nThere is no need to wait to get the keyboard layout option more than 5 minutes, right? But I waited for about 1 hour. No progress. \nSo I selected shutdown and restarted without CD. I went to Windows 7 and saw that my 40 GB partition had been divided into two parts. I repeated the above process. Ubuntu detected its previous installation attempt and asked to reinstall as the first option. Again the same result.\nThen I even switched to DVD-RW, again the same results.\nWhat is the problem, and how can I fix it? Could it be the iso file itself?\nFor further detail:\nI'm using a Corsair 4 GB DDR3 RAM. So I guess that this doesnt have any role in this problem. The 40GB drive is actually a 160 GB HDD, split into 4 40gb partitions. The partition that I used had a Windows 8 developer version installed in the past. I didnt need it, so I just right clicked and made a quick format and it got cleaned.\nThen I went to the disk management in Windows 7 and right-clicked on the partion and selected delete option and then it became an unused free memory of 40 GB capacity. During Ubuntu installation, I selected the first option to install alongside Windows 7. Then it took me straight to copying files and I got stuck \"in the where are you\" window. After shutting down and getting back to Windows 7, in the disk management I saw that the Windows 7 was left untouched and I had two unnamed drives of basic type whose total capacity was 40 gb. This what I did. Is it ok?\nGeneral info: I am using a desktop PC. Processor: AMD Athlon x2 260 Motherboard: Asus m4a88tm HDD: 1 160 GB IDE and another 40 GB IDE. I used one of the 40 GB partitions on the 160 GB drive and not on the 40 GB HDD itself\n\nA: Do you have at least 512 MB of RAM?  That could be the problem.\nMy suspicion would be the .iso unless you were able to check its validity with an MD5sum or whatever the magazine provided.  Or ... when you booted the LiveCD, there should have been a menu entry to check the CD itself.  If that passes, the problem was not the .iso.\nYou did not say HOW you deleted the 40 GB partition and your result makes it look like the install thought it was all or part of Win7 so it split that into halves and used one half for Ubuntu.  That makes me think you MAY have deleted the contents of the partition but did not delete the partition itself.  That is very easy to do since partitioning tools have you specify WHAT you want them to do but do not do it until you separately tell them to do it and they confirm you mean it.  Basically, they may look like you have deleted before they actially have completed the deed.\n", "Q: LiveCD hangs when removing boot CD for burning another \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to get Ubuntu installed after deleting Windows and with no other OS present? \n\nI downloaded an image of 12.04 and I want to burn it onto a CD.\nApparently each time I boot to the 10.10 LiveCD and try to burn the image using the default application (Brasero disc burner), when I replace the LiveCD with the empty CD, the system freezes.\nWhat do I need to do so the system doesn't freeze and lets me burn my image? \n\nA: Tom is correct in that when using Ubuntu from a Live CD, you must keep the Ubuntu Live CD in the drive the entire time.  You basically have two options:\n1- If you have and can connect a second CD/DVD drive, you can run the Ubuntu Live CD from one drive and burn with the other.\n2- Create a Live USB (again, as Tom mentioned).\n\nA: There is a 3rd option, you could buy an official cd from Canonical http://shop.canonical.com/index.php?cPath=17\n\nA: You were running Live CD, so removing that CD means, you were telling your computer to run Ubuntu from nothing!!!, which your computer simply can't. It needs the data from the Live CD.\nThis situation is somewhat similar to removing Windows installation disk while installation is running. Of course, the installation will be stopped or hanged.\nMore technically, the contents of Live CD's are not fully mapped or loaded into the RAM or Main memory (which you may have been assuming). The contents are loaded into memory as per requirements. For example, Gparted program will not load into the memory until you start it from the Live CD. This type of loading is called dynaming  loading and is considered very essential. \nI suggest you to save the downloaded iso file in another directoy in your PC or in the USB drive. (If you are using Live Ubuntu from USB and your USB has more space, you can save the iso file in that USB drive too. Though you need to be root to copy it)\nThen transfer the file in another PC to burn the CD or if you have Windows, burn the CD with windows tools.\n", "Q: How to debug Ubuntu's booting errors? I downloaded Ubuntu 12.10 beta1 ISO and have been trying to boot from it using a USB stick.\nBut every time I try to boot it freezes and all I can see is the Ubuntu logo, which gives no idea about the cause of the freeze.\nI want to know if there is way such that instead of showing the Ubuntu logo, the installer would show me console output, so I could know what the actual problem is.\nI know its still a beta software, but I don't want my 750 MBs to go waste.\n\nA: As you are trying Ubuntu from USB, You can enable more verbose output during booting. Do these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the USB drive, their should be a folder named \"isolinux\". (it may be \"syslinux\" also). Go to that folder (from your Windows or existing Ubuntu)\n\n*Open txt.cfg file inside that folder with a text editor like gedit (in Ubuntu) or Notepad (in Windows)\n\n*Remove the quiet splash words with a blank. The lines will look like this\nappend  file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper initrd=/casper/initrd.lz quiet splash --\n\nAfter removing it should look like this\nappend  file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper initrd=/casper/initrd.lz  --\n\n\n*Then save the file and exit Text Editor.\nFrom now, If you boot Ubuntu from USB, you should have more verbose output showing you. Although those outputs are too fast, but can help you if booting stuck on a step.\nHope this answer  help in some degree. \n", "Q: Elevate user-permissions in Unity so I can move folders I'm switching from Windows 7 so please excuse my newbie question.\nIs it possible to elevate privileges of local user so it can access entire file system from Unity UI (even if it's very very bad thing to do:) ?\nFor example I downloaded IntelliJ IDEA tar. I unpacked it to ~/temp_idea and want to move it to /opt. But I can't. As soon as I try moving it in the UI I get \"Permission denied\" error.\nI can do it in terminal via sudo mv of course but it would be very nice to be able to do it in the UI.\n\nA: You can use gksu nautilus command in the Unity dash prompt ( Press Alt-F2 ). This will open the Nautilus file browser and then you can do the copy, move, delete stuff using UI.\nBe warned! Using nautilus with root privilege is very bad and you can do much harm to your PC with it, of course unintentionally.\n", "Q: wireless not working, tried to install drivers, did'nt work. what do I do? okay, here is the output of lspci. \n00:00.0 Host bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 760/M760 Host (rev 03)\n00:01.0 PCI bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] SG86C202\n00:02.0 ISA bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] SiS963 [MuTIOL Media IO] LPC Controller (rev 25)\n00:02.1 SMBus: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] SiS961/2/3 SMBus controller\n00:02.5 IDE interface: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 5513 IDE Controller\n00:02.6 Modem: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] AC'97 Modem Controller (rev a0)\n00:02.7 Multimedia audio controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] SiS7012 AC'97 Sound Controller (rev a0)\n00:03.0 USB controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] USB 1.1 Controller (rev 0f)\n00:03.1 USB controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] USB 1.1 Controller (rev 0f)\n00:03.3 USB controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] USB 2.0 Controller\n00:04.0 Ethernet controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] SiS900 PCI Fast Ethernet (rev 91)\n00:0a.0 CardBus bridge: ENE Technology Inc CB1410 Cardbus Controller (rev 01)\n00:0b.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4306 802.11b/g Wireless LAN Controller (rev 03)\n00:18.0 Host bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] K8 [Athlon64/Opteron] HyperTransport Technology Configuration\n00:18.1 Host bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] K8 [Athlon64/Opteron] Address Map\n00:18.2 Host bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] K8 [Athlon64/Opteron] DRAM Controller\n00:18.3 Host bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] K8 [Athlon64/Opteron] Miscellaneous Control\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 661/741/760 PCI/AGP or 662/761Gx PCIE VGA Display Adapter\n\n\nA: Run the following sudo command to insure the correct driver is installed:\n\nsudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer\n\n", "Q: How large is the storage space of ubuntu 1 free?

But take care to read by byte, not by line - because lines would be randomly separated by random newline bytes.\nSo, to read 30 random bytes into a file random.bytes, use:\nhead -c 30 /dev/urandom > random.bytes\n\nYou can read from it as a normal user.\nLeave alone /dev/random\nNormally, you want to use /dev/urandom, not /dev/random.\nThe problem is that /dev/random is hard to use in the right way - and easy to use in a wrong way. Using it wrong works at first, but creates strange - even random - performance problems later. Sometimes.\nWhen you use /dev/urandom, it makes use of /dev/random internally, taking care of the tricky parts.\n", "Q: Ubuntu server 12.04 can't connect home wireless network I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 (server) without GUI.\nI have Netgear wireless card ( model:wg311v3 ) that i have installed it through ndiswrapper driver wrapper to work with windows driver.\nI don't have dchp installed ( i want to have static ip so i can use router's port forwarding ).\nI don't have network-manager installed.\nI have googled a lot and haven't manage to connect to my home wireless network ( with encryption WPA/WPA2 PSK ).

The last time I installed KDE and Gnome on the same OS (Opensuse 12.1), GDM and KDM started conflicting and they both stopped working properly and I was plagued with applications from both environments till the point the applications overview in gnome was flooded with useless KDE trash. Moreover, I still had parts of the KDE desktop appearing when I'm running Gnome (such as the password manager and kde fonts and some apps refused to give up the oxygen theme). If I install the plasma-desktop package on Ubuntu, am I at risk of having such issues? I just want KDE with the bare minimum number of applications; just the necessary ones to make things work. I'd rather not have dolphin installed either. Also, is it all right to install the kde-standard pack? Or should I just stick to the plasma-desktop pack?\n\nA: I think it should work. You can try installing a package and if it doesn't work, you can remove the packages installed. Take a look at your APT log after you have installed it. All packages that were installed along with KDE will show up as one entry. To show it, just type this at the command line:\ncat /var/log/apt/history.log\n\nIf your desktop is broken, press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to login. You can then remove the installed packages with:\nsudo apt-get remove package1 package2 ...\n\nRemember, even if your desktop is broken you can still fix it from the command line.

I have 1TB HDD and I will use ubuntu and won't use dual boot with windows, any tips about partitions' size and how many partitions, can I have just 2 partitions?\nThe second question is about swap partition, do I have to make a separate partition for swap specially when I can use a file as a swap, is there any performance gain?\n\nA: You can make the swap partition at least 4 GB, and it is better than a swap file as the file may become fragmented under some conditions, especially while it is being made. It also helps hibernation.\nTherefore, a swap partition is better if you are not constrained with partition layout. \nYou can then use the rest of the disk as a / partition, or make another set to mount in /home so you can keep your home partition separate from any other files. However, 2 partitions (swap and /) are good, and the swap can be around 4GB, and the other partition can fill the rest of the disk.\n", "Q: Got problem with installation. \"No root file system is defined.\" I'm very new with Ubuntu and generally with linux.\nI saw ubuntu and it seems like this OS is really good and stable, and so I decided to install it alongside my windows 7 OS.\nI have a few problems with the installation.\nHere is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*I downloaded the 64bit version from Ubuntu official website, and burned it on a dvd.\n\n*I set the boot sequence to first load from my CD-Rom.\n\n*Ubuntu installation started, and I chose \"Install Ubuntu\" in the menu.

You need to convert the disk to a \"Basic disk\" in MS terminology before proceeding.\nUpdate: after some googling I see that Ubuntu installer should be aware of Dynamic disks and at least warn the user that it can't make modifications to the partition table. So the issue may be caused by something else. At any rate, you should not proceed until the installer sees all the partitions on the disk, forcing it to create new partitions on top will result in data loss.\n\nA: I saw this too\nsudo dmraid -rE\n\nfixed it for me, from this thread:\nWhy doesn't the installer see all of my hard drives?\nTh disk was messed up, and had some garbage metadata. \n", "Q: How to drag windows to another workspace from the spread view? How to drag windows to another workspace from the \"Spread view\"?\nEDIT: Seems to have created some misunderstandings by using the term \"Spread View\". I am referring to SUPER + W \" Spread windows view\" and not to SUPER + S \"Spread worksheet view\" aka \"Workspace Switcher\".\n\nA: From the spread view (SUPER + S) just grab the window and drop it on another workspace.\nP.S.: It seems as though there was a slight misunderstanding with what you regarded as the spread view.  You can always hold down SUPER to see all Unity shortcuts and their effects in a nifty overview.\n\nA: I don't know exactly what you mean by the \"spread view\". But if I have a window that is in focus, and I want to put it on another workspace, I usually do CtrlAltShiftRight (or Left).\n\nA: \nDisclaimer: This answer refers CCSM (compiz-config-settings-manager) which should be used with care. There is a probability of locking yourself out of Unity if handled improperly.\n\nSuper + W spreads all windows in the current workspace. I assume that is what you are referring to.\nIt is possible to bind these events to keyboard shortcuts or mouse clicks (with or without modifiers) Left click selects a window and can not be changed as far as I know.\n\n\n*\n\n*Zoom into a window, but do not select it\n\n*Close a window\n\n*Pull window\n\n\nThese features are handled by Scale Addons plugin in CCSM. The plugin does have an option to bind a shortcut to pull Window. Probably that does what you want. Screenshots are provided below for reference.\n\n\nThe problem is, I haven't yet figured how to spread all windows from all workspaces. No combination worked, yet. You can try various combinations in Scale plugin to see if you can achieve this. Once you spread all windows from all workspaces, the shortcut assigned to Pull window should do the trick.\n", "Q: krb5-multidev, libk5crypto3, libk5crypto3:i386 package dependency Using Ubuntu 12.04\nAsus U43F\nI can no longer update, install or remove packages via software center because of package dependency errors. \nsudo apt-get install -f reads the following:\n    Reading package lists...

I really love the concept of MAAS underlying an OpenStack implementation, but there are a few questions about MAAS that I am not entirely clear on.\n\n\n*\n\n*Should all hosts be set to network boot at all times or after they have been registered and allocated as a service, should they boot to disk?\n\n*\n\n*After juju bootstrap is executed, I turn on the machine that has been allocated (note WoL isn't working, I suspect it's being blocked on the network), the machine boot's up and then juju status executes correct, agent running and all that good stuff.\n\n*If I 'reboot' the machine (testing power failure/problem whatever), juju status comes back but the agent-state is no longer in running state, and so far I have to destroy the environment and restart.\n\n\n*In all cases I have never been able to deploy any services to any of the other nodes.  I deploy the service with juju, note which node it was assigned, and then start the system.  The system just boots up into a basic node.  If I SSH to it I have to enter password, so it's not setting up the ssh key or anything.\n\n\nThis is on Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS systems and HP GL360G7 hosts.  The MAAS management server is running as a VM but all on the same network.\nAt this point I am not sure if I am doing something wrong or if there is a problem somewhere else.  Is the idea that anytime a host is rebooted it should be rebuilt from the ground up, or is something else going on behind the scene to tell it to boot the local image.  If the latter, why doesn't the agent start on a system that has been successfully setup before (juju bootstrapped system)?\n\nA: You should leave PXE booting on at all times.  MAAS will tell the machine to local boot as appropriate depending on what state it is in.\nI don't know why your agent isn't restarting between reboots, it sounds like a juju bug but I am not a juju expert (I work on MAAS).  After you do a juju bootstrap, the node installs itself and you'll see it reboot at the end of that.  You should see messages going to the console saying the agent is starting up.  That reboot is no different to you rebooting it manually later so I suspect that something went wrong during installation and the installer didn't manage to tell MAAS to turn off the \"netboot\" flag.  Can you see any obvious errors on the console when it installs the node during deployment?\n", "Q: Access secondary hard disk from Virtual Machine I have a fairly specific question. \nI had Ubuntu on my Laptop (for years). For a variety of reasons, I've had to switch to Windows but the computer has two hard drives. The main drive was reformatted and I've installed windows. The second hard drive still has the Linux system disk format (not sure on type). Obviously, windows can't access it but can I access it from a Virtual machine (VirtualBox) or will I need to load up a Live-Session to access / move the contents? \nEdit: If this is possible, how would one proceed to mount the disk? \n\nA: Yes, of course it is possible to set up Virtual Box to have raw access to an attached hard drive.\n\nThis is dangerous because data can get lost \nWe do have to make sure that we never ever access this drive from both, the host OS, and the guest OS at any time.\n\nThere is a nice tutorial found in the Virtual Box Manual on how to achieve this.\nIn short summary (do take the time to read the manual) we need to create a .vmdk file pointing to our hard drive:\nVBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename /path/to/file.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/sda\n\nWe than may attach this file to our virtual machine\nVBoxManage storageattach <NameofVM> --storagectl \"IDE Controller\" --port 0 --device 0 --type hdd --medium /path/to/file.vmdk\n\n\nA: In all honesty, I do not think so.\nThe reason for this: \nDisclaimer: I loooove deductive reasoning. Brace yourself.\nLet's look at out information, shall we:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have 2 hard drives. One of them has windows installed, the other uses a (currently) unknown linux filesystem.\n\n*You want to create a Virtual machine. To do so, you need special software known as a Virtual Machine Hypervizor. An example of such software is VirtualBox.\n\n*Windows is unable to use the hard drive at its current format.\n\n*To create a virtual machine, you need to create a file that will act as a virtual hard drive. That file has to be stored somewhere.\n\n*Since windows can not access the hard drive as is, it is highly unlikely it can use it to provide services to software running on it, like a Hypervizor (e.g Storage)\n\n*So, the virtual machine will have to be stored on the hard drive that windows is installed on. =(\n\n*Unless you get very technical in virtual machines or are a highly skilled computer hacker, there is (very very ...) little chance that you can access the host (physical computer) from the guest (virtual machine)\nTL:DR: Theoretically anything that contains a virtual machine is highly unlikely to help.\nHowever, you might be able to use partitioning software to format the hard drive and make it available to Windows.\n", "Q: Problem installing UniversalIndentGUI I need a GUI beautifier for C code. I've found UniversalIndentGUI on sourceforge.

There are no longer any Amazon/web search results when you search in the Dash, but the Amazon icon remains in the launcher by default. It is part of the ubuntu-web-launchers package, which can be removed with:\nsudo apt-get remove ubuntu-web-launchers\n\nAt the time of this writing, Amazon appears to be the only thing in the package, so it should be fine to remove. Keep in mind that this might not be the case in the future, so it might be safer to just remove Amazon if you might want to keep other web launchers. Take a look at the list of files in the package and get rid of the Amazon ones:\nsudo rm /usr/share/applications/com.canonical.launcher.amazon.desktop\nsudo rm /usr/share/applications/ubuntu-amazon-default.desktop\n\n\nA: With Privacy Indicator you can quickly enable or disable online results:\n\n\nA: In addition to the other answers, you can also redirect the queries to another location by changing the URL it uses for the product search:\nsudo -s\necho 'OFFERS_URI=\"https://localhost:0/\"' >> /etc/environment\n\nAnd then restart your session.\n\nA: Or use old famous hack with hosts file.

Is there tool to see call-stack of running thread similar to Process Explorer by Sysinternals ?\nSo far I tried htop, qps and Linux Process Explorer. None of them can provide that information.\nThanks!\n\nA: Gdb, the GNU debugging utility, can provide such functionality, although only for selected programs or processes individually. There is not an easy way to do it and switch between the call-stacks of the processes running on the system like the Sysinternals program does on Windows. However, you could try pstack, but I have not had much success with it.\nYou also have to install the dbg packages (i.e. the symbol packages) so that any gdb call-stack backtrace will work. See the Ubuntu wiki for more information on these packages. Basically, the dbg version of the package is installed very like the normal one is. You run, for example, \nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-core-dbg\n\nYou can do a backtrace on a program by starting the program under gdb or you can do one on a program already running by attaching gdb to that process: please see here for further details.\nPlease see the official manual for more information on gdb and backtracing and  more generally useful information is here at the Ubuntu debugging page.\nAdditional ways of analysing running processes using strace,etc, which are of use to developers, etc, in analysing a process and its system calls, as opposed to stack calls, have been moved to this question here (as I thought they are now more relevant there):\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I know which file a program is trying to access?\n", "Q: tinyproxy install via apt-get failing to create config file I put together an ubuntu 12.04 server a couple of weeks ago and everything seemed fine until this morning.\nSuddenly, I'm having trouble installing new packages - at first I thought there was something wrong with tinyproxy and so I tried installing squid instead.

So I'm new to Linux but am basically blown away by Ubuntu 12.04 and could definitely see this becoming my main desktop over time\nOne small annoyance for me is a tendency for the global menu on the top bar to partially over-write the text description of the active window in the top panel.\ne.g. I focus on the \"Ubuntu Software Centre\" window which writes out that label in the leftmost corner of the top menu bar.  If I then move the cursor up to the top menu bar to access the \"file menu\", this will partially overwrite the window name leaving just \"Ubuntu\" visible.  \nThis is a little slice of ugliness I don't want to see every day!  Much easier on the eye for me would be to display the active window name at the centre of the top panel, using some of that free space and then have the global menu stay where it is, just to the right of the app launcher.\nI've found a solution to disable the global menu but I would prefer to keep it and instead move (or disable) the active window name in the top panel.  \nAny way to do this?\n\nA: I believe this is a bug that shows up in applications when the global menu is not fully integrated into the application.  For example, software center has a global menu however the close/minimise/maximise buttons still appear on the title bar instead of next to the global menu - example compare the Firefox global menu.\nWhat happens is, the global menu text is drawn on the top bar, but the space where the buttons should be is not drawn, leaving part of the title text showing though.\nBug or feature?  I don't know but I can't find a launchpad bug that deals with this.  Maybe start a new bug report and see how it flies?  Chris.\n", "Q: I uninstalled Ariya in Kubuntu, how do I install it again?

According to the documentation on their website there are several versions of 3.2 for Linux (CentOS, openSUSE, SLES) but none for Ubuntu, is there a way to install one of these and make it work?\nThen I was thinking about Wine, which I have never used but heard people mention. So I was wondering, can I run the Windows version of LS-PrePost 3.2 in Wine? Can you run all Windows programs in Wine or are there only specific programs you can run?\nMaybe there's another solution that works better. In any case I appreciate the response. \n\nA: Regarding your question #1, which version you should choose. The packages have been build for three distros, but as far as I can see not in their package manager format (RPM), which  means that you will not be able to convert it automagically to Ubuntu using alien.\nWhy are there different versions of the package for different systems? Well, the systems or different versions thereof can contain different sets and versions of libraries that the binaries have been build against. Without knowing, which libraries are these, there is no telling which version would run on Ubuntu.\nTherefore, I would do the following: download several versions of the package, unzip them (tar xzf) and try to run the binaries. Some of them will complain about missing libraries. If you are lucky, you will find a version that is happy with what is installed on your system. If not, you will have to manually install whatever is needed. If necessary, download all of the versions and go through them one by one, using apt-cache to find out what libraries you could provide easily, and which will be a pain in the neck to install.\nCome back to this forum with specifiic problems.\nRegarding your question #2: Wine does not run all of the Windows software. Some applications need trickery and magic to make them work. Others will not run whatsoever. There are also alternatives to Wine, however. First, there is Playonlinux (build on Wine). \nThen, my favorite solution to run MS Office at the odd times when I'm needing it: install virtualbox and a full Windows installation within that. Of course, if you spend more time working within that vbox installation then in Ubuntu, you got to ask yourself -- do I really need Ubuntu?\nIn your particular case, if attempts to install using OpenSuse or CentOS packages fail, you could install virtualbox with OpenSuse or Centos or SLES, and install your package within.\n", "Q: Ubuntu - Install Mate Desktop - Themes missing?

Is Google Chrome supported?\n\nA: By the momment Unity Webapps it is only avialable for Firefox  and Chromium . As Google Chrome is based on Chromium, it shouldn't be hard to export Webapps to it.\nRemeber this is preview software you should fully expect to encounter bugs.\n\nA: Google Chrome is not supported at the moment.\nThe issue with Google Chrome is that there are a few pieces missing that prevent us from having the complete \"WebApps\" experience:\n\n\n*\n\n*support for \"infobars\" extension cap is still missing and set as experimental (putting it out of experimental being postponed again and again due to some issues in MacOS),\n\n*support for some form of tld resolution (chrome.tld was proposed as an extension upstream w/o success, maybe I should go back at it),\n\n*no \"chromeless\" (although we could somehow come close with \"app mode\"),\n\n\nWe could have a limited (but acceptable) WebApps experience support for Chrome though,\n\nTo test out what does function, you must install chromium-browser and unity-chromium-extension then copy some files.\nCopy pmoflmbbcfgacopiikdcpmbiellfihdg from ~/.config/chromium/Default/Extensions/ to ~/.config/google-chrome/Default/Extensions/ and it should show up next time you launch Chrome.\n\nA: Unity Webapps work in Firefox and Chromium, and they could be made to work in other browsers as well.

Then, run startx, and switch back to a TTY. Run:\nexport DISPLAY=:0&&firefox\n\nNow, it will both use X, but not lightDM, and will run.\n\nA: The applications you want to open depend on having an X Window System server active to handle graphics drawing and user input, and passing it to the application. X applications can NOT work standalone which seems to be what you want to do.\nTo understand a bit more about this you should read up on the X window system's architecture. One possible place to do it is this howto (it's somewhat outdated but the architectural principle is still the same): http://tldp.org/HOWTO/XWindow-Overview-HOWTO/index.html\nIf you don't want to start the graphical environment when you boot up, disabling lightdm is the way to go, but you will still need to start it if you want a graphical application to run. You can do so manually by using the startx command.\nIf your concern is about the graphical environment consuming too many resources, what you should do instead is install a more lightweight environment (like xfce) and select xfce session on lightdm.\n", "Q: GUI Crashed when updating 10.04 to 12.04 using the update-manager \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat should I do when Ubuntu freezes? \n\nI was updating my Desktop from 10.04 to 12.04 and the server crashed before the update was done is there any way to fix this other than reinstalling the OS.\nIf not is there a way that I can back up by RAID configuration, Apache, php, sql, Python, ethernet connection, cron jobs, samba, LDAP, etc. and other useful apps, export a list of all of the things I have installed and config files automatically?\n\nA: Before you go any further I seriously recommend backing up all your data, and all the hidden dot files in your home directory.  To make a list of installed programs do:\ndpgk --get-selections | grep -v deinstall > ubuntu-files\n\nThis will make a file in the current directory called ubuntu-files which will contain a list of everything that is installed.  To restore this list to the system do the following:\n### Make sure the system is fully updated if it isn't already:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n### Install the dselect tool (probably depracated)\nsudo apt-get install dselect\n### Give the package list to dpkg so it knows what to install\nsudo dpkg --set-selections < ubuntu-files\n### Use dselect to initiate installation (option 'I' will do it)\nsudo dselect\n\nPlease note that this will install everything in the list you made in the first step.  If you're doing this after upgrading the release level then the results may not be ideal - for example open office will may installed when the default for 12.04 should actually be Libre Office and so on.\nTo try to kick the distribution upgrade off again do the following:\n### Make sure the package lists are up to date.\nsudo apt-get update\n### install update-manager-core if it is not already:\nsudo apt-get install update-manager-core\n### Kick the release upgrade off again...\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\n", "Q: Airmon-ng command not found In the terminal I get Command not found when I type:\nairmon-ng start wlan0\n\nWhat can I do to access the airmon-ng command?\n\nA: get THIS package and open that with Software center to install .

(Requires constant AC power.) \nI recently did an update that included a kernel. I ran the update and rebooted, and for some reason , grub couldn't find the kernel, and I was stuck there for awhile. Being a relatively inexperienced Linux user, I decided to load my live USB, copy over files I wanted to keep, and reinstall. Mid-copy , I bumped my power cable and unplugged the computer. When I booted back up, it loaded my hard disk install without problem.\nWhy did this happen in the first place, what fixed it, and how can I avoid this problem in the future?\n\nA: It seems that the install hadn't completed properly for some reason: specifically it had not updated the grub configuration to change the boot options.\nThis does not explain what fixed the problem, but it seem likely that a subsequent update finished the process. You could have run update grub to get it to update the list of kernels:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nA: You can check your kernel list. \nOpen terminal Ctrl + Alt + T and type this command :\ndpkg --list | grep linux-image \n\nNow check your current kernel:\nuname -r \n\nUpdate your grub to make your newest kernel on the list.\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: cp file in many subdirectories with * I want to copy a file \"test.sh\" in directories which have all a subdirectory 2_bas (ex. prod1/2_bas, prod2/2_bas, etc...)\nI tried: \ncp test */2_bas/\n\nbut I get the error message:\ncp: omitting directory `prod1/2_bas'\ncp: omitting directory `prod2/2_bas' \n\nA solution would be:\nfor dir in *; do [ -d \"$dir\" ] && cp test.sh \"$dir\"/2_bas ; done\n\nBut why does the first strategy not work?\n\nA: It's how the cp command is designed to work; it accepts multiple sources but only one destination. So your expansion looks like:\ncp test prod1/2_bas prod2/2_bas prod3/2_bas .... prodN/2_bas\n\nand what you're telling cp is to essentially copy everything into prodN/2bas (the last directory in the expansion). This is certainly not what you want. The error message you see is because you're telling cp to copy directories, and by default it refuses to do so (unless you specify, for instance, -r for recursive copying. Don't do it, though; it will still not do what you want).\nHave a look at cp man page, it states what the command does:\nCopy SOURCE to DEST, or multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.\n\nAnother solution:\nfind ./ -type -d exec cp test {} \\;\n\n", "Q: Problem installing Nvidia driver on Lenovo z570 I have a Lenovo z570, I found out that my laptop has two Graphic Card (Intel + Nvidia). When I tried to install Nvidia driver, I've got an error which says: \nThe graphics driver could not find compatible graphics hardware.\n\nWhat should I do to fix it? Does it mean my laptop really doesn't have that hardware?\n\nA: Your laptop came with nvidia-optimus technology. This should work in the following way: Most of the time, the system runs using the Intel graphics, which improves the battery life, and when you need to use more graphic power, it switches automatically to the nvidia card. The problem is that there is no official support of the optimus technology on linux. There are, however, some projects trying to solve the problem, see for example the hybrid graphics at launchpad https://launchpad.net/~hybrid-graphics-linux .\nSo don't worry, your laptop does have the nvidia card. It's just that it is either disabled in bios (and you can enable it), or your computer cannot see it. Anyway, if you want to use the card, you will have to install software enabling you to switch between the graphics cards.\n\nA: I have Lenovo Z570 and it comes with two graphics card.

You do not grep the files; you grep the output of ls, which happens to be a list of files.\n\"Recursive ls\" is called find :-)\nfind /mydata -type f | grep txt$\n\nor, better,\nfind /mydata -type f -name '*.txt'\n\n\nA: I actually solved it by using find . type -f instead of ls\n", "Q: Replacing Nautilus with Awesome Windows Manager on 12.04 Just like the title suggests, any idea on replacing nautilus with Awesome WM? \n\nA: I think you are confused. Awesome WM, as the name says, its a complete window manager. On its side, Nautilus is a file manager. Anyways, this can be what you are looking for.\n\nA: Windows managers are those programs which provide the windowing functionality, such as title bar, window border, moving, resizing etc. And Awesome is a window manager, which is lightweight in resource usage.\nOn the other hand, a File manager is a program which provides you facility to browse or navigate the file system, move, copy, create files etc. And Nautilus falls in the category of file managers, it's not a window manager. In fact, Nautilus is the most loved and used file manager in Linux desktops.\nThere cannot be any question of replacing a window manager with a file manager. But, yes, you could ask to replace Compiz (which is another window manager)  with awesome window manager or replace nautilus with another file manager such as Thunar.\n\nA: You can install and use other file manager such as PCManFM or Dolphin in Awesome WM. And there is also a file manager in terminal like Ranger.\n", "Q: Installation problems after broken installation of desktop4shared ranjith@NKR:~$ sudo apt-get install desktop4shared-1.3_1-all\nReading package lists...

I ask this as with the Unity Desktop running , when I try any games with my Ubuntu 12.04.1 I get so much frame rate drop with Unity and Compiz. If I switch to Gnome-Classic which uses mutter, I get a vast boost in performance.\nMy system is an 8 core AMD with a Nvidia 460 SE that can play anything I chuck at it in Windows and I'm using the latest Nvidia drivers, but even simple games like the humble bundle gets serious lag with Unity and the only cause of this can be compiz (what I can guess).\nWhen Steam come to Ubuntu, how will this performance loss be addressed?\n\nA: Try Unity 2D or Lubuntu. Both of them are here How can I reduce lagging with GUI/GPU stuff -- make Unity run smaller, quicker, faster?. Lubuntu is not Unity but is a lightweight alternative.\n\nA: This might be more of a comment than an answer, but it got too big.  My bad. :-(\nUnity was once based on Mutter, and gained in performance by switching to Compiz.  Look at the happy comments there. :-)  So I think it's not that simple; the situation has proved trickier than the way you're positing it.  \nWhen you say \"all I can think of is it must be Compiz\", it kinda sounds lke a presumpton.  Phoronix and others have written about much better performance from Compiz without Unity.  Unity makes high demands, whatever the backend.  That seems to be the biggest issue.\nA standalone rewrite might cost years of effort and then of optimizing.  (And definitely be pilloried for NIH syndrome.)  If you have particular ideas for implementing this, a demo in code would be best, 'cause imagined rewrites are usually chimerical.  'Start clean' isn't enough of a specification to create a different, better, OpenGL compositor and WM. :-/  There's a good Joel On Software article about the perils of starting from scratch, that could apply here.\nFor games, I think the Unity devs are still working out un-redirecting windows, that is, not passing them through Compiz, but bypassing that layer.  You might search Launchpad and Planet Ubuntu for 'unredirect'.  I don't know what the near future holds, but it seems to be one of their areas of focus right now.\n\nUpdate, 2014, since I happened to look back at this:\nSince 2013, the wheel has turned again on the whole graphics stack.

In the spirit of full disclosure, i just posted this question to the ubuntu forums, but i figure more heads working on it couldn't hurt.\nI have a multi-seat setup working quite well. Hot plugging input devices works as expected and such. The only issue I am still not able to resolve is getting the audio for each seat.\nHere is a summary of my attempts at getting audio to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make ~/.pulse/default.pa dynamically configured based on which $DISPLAY the user logs in at.\n\n\n*\n\n*See this pastebin for the details.\n\n\n*Load pulseaudio as a system-wide instance.\n\n\n*\n\n*Couldn't get this to work. None of the audio hardware was accessible to the users.\n\n\n*Use udev rules to mark seats in ConsoleKit. Following udev guidelines found here:  http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/multiseat\n\n\n*\n\n*I didn't think this would work, although it was \"guaranteed\" to work by someone in irc.freenode #pulseaudio\n\n\n\nNone of those attempts yielded success, which is why I now turn to the community for help. It is quite possible that the suggested methods work and I just messed some aspect of it up, idk. This is the last piece of the puzzle which is needed before I can go and update the MultiseatX page to include instructions for Ubuntu 12.04.\nMy understandings on the situation:\nAccess to pulseaudio is restricted to the active session as marked by ConsoleKit (something about an ACL). CK can only mark one session as active at a time. This simple little fact of life leads me to believe that the solution should involve pulseaudio being run as a system-wide instance. Each user should connect to the pulse server and be limited to a subset of all the hardware. Maybe each user connects to the pulse server via localhost, idk. I do know that regardless of my attempts and their failed results, I was always able to use sudo aplay -D plughw:0,0 /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav to play something to any of the hardware.\nI'm grasping at straws and am now down to the last few hairs i can pull out of my head. Please, help me figure this out so we can share the wealth. Any additional information needed will be provided at your request.\n\nA: I've spent many hours researching online, testing various setups and talking to Pulseaudio devs. The bottom line of it all is that running pulseaudio in normal user mode will allow only the active session as marked by ConsoleKit to access the audio hardware. Since current ConsoleKit is only able to mark one session as active at a time, this means that we must run a system-wide instance of pulseaudio. The upside: Each seat can have individual audio. The downside: ALL audio hardware is available to any user and can be manipulated AT WILL. This is not an ideal situation for an internet cafe or other public setting where security is a real concern. Keep this in mind when creating your site security policy. It might be prudent to restrict pavucontrol execution to admins only.\nAs always, make a backup of all of your default config files. If you have tinkered with your configs without backing up, you may retrieve the pulseaudio package with apt-get -d install pulseaudio. This will download the package (to /var/cache/archives/apt) only and you can extract the contents to retrieve the default configs. Be aware that client.conf is not included in there.\nTo run pulseaudio as a system-wide daemon, we need to edit a few files.\n1.) /etc/default/pulseaudio\n    PULSEAUDIO_SYSTEM_START=1\n\n2.) /etc/pulse/daemon.conf - See man pulse-daemon.conf for more\n    information.\n    daemonize = yes\n    local-server-type = system\n\n3.) /etc/pulse/client.conf\n    autospawn = no\n\nWe also need to add users to the pulse-access group.\nsudo usermod -a -G pulse-access <username>\n\nNow that all users are able to access the audio hardware, we need to select the hardware each user will use. This can be done using pavucontrol. Please be aware that the settings are stored PER USER and will not follow the seat. If users switch seats, you will need to re-select the desired audio hardware.\nAdditional Comments on Pulseaudio\nI had hoped that there would be a more elegant solution for getting per seat audio working. Using a systemwide Pulseaudio in multiseat has many drawbacks and is not entirely stable between reboots. I had attempted to start a systemwide instance and have user instances connect to it as a server via localhost. That doesn't seem to work since when pulseaudio --start is run it sources daemon.conf.\nRegarding ConsolKit\nThe issue we see when running a normal per-user pulseaudio is that one seat has access to the hardware and all others have Dummy Output. This is due to ConsoleKit not being entirely seat aware. CK considers all of our seats as sessions of seat1 and can only mark one session as active. This fact can be seen by running getfacl /dev/snd/*. The thought occurred to me that we might be able to edit the acl of the appropriate /dev/snd/ files based on which $DISPLAY a particular user is using. This is an option that I have not explored. Please consider contributing to the multiseat cause by exploring this hypothesis and editing the document with your findings.\nMultiseat branches for ConsoleKit, GDM-2.3 and GDM-3.x do exist which should provide for automatic multiseat functionality.\nAdditional Notes\n1.) It would be wise to also disallow users from loading modules DISALLOW_MODULE_LOADING=1.\n2.) autospawn = no is not entirely necessary as seen in my example file. It causes no issues. \n\nA: \nMy understandings on the situation: Access to pulseaudio is restricted to the active session as marked by ConsoleKit (something about an ACL). CK can only mark one session as active at a time.\n\nThere is a patch to ConsoleKit to add multiseat support; this will allow it to report all active seats as active.  Perhaps this will fix your problem.  It needs cooperation with the display manager, and there is a patch to old versions of GDM that adds this support.\nI got multiseat working in Natty (11.04) using modified ConsoleKit and GDM packages from a PPA.  I haven't upgraded from Natty yet -- it took me a long time to figure out how to get it to work, and I'm worried that LightDM won't work with the patched ConsoleKit.\nEDIT:  I should note that Fedora 17 has some impressive multiseat features, some of which will be in Quantal.  They have a wiki page describing their approach.  Ubuntu can't simply copy Fedora's approach because it would require significant changes; Fedora uses systemd and GDM while Ubuntu uses upstart and LightDM.\n\nA: I recently was trying to solve the issue with PulseAudio and Multiseat. Seeing that there was no elegant solution, my workaround was to use network.\nThis solution suits my scenario because I am the user which most often is in the machine and my seat is most often logged in. And my seat is left-handed configured and nobody else uses it.\nIn my ~/.config/pulse/default.pa I copied the system configuration of /etc/pulse/default.pa and added the following line:\nload-module module-native-protocol-tcp auth-anonymous=1 auth-ip-acl=127.0.0.1\n\nIn other users' pulseaudio settings, add a tunnel --or several ones, if that's what you need-- with something along:\nload-module module-tunnel-sink server=127.0.0.1 sink=alsa_output.pci-0000_00_XX.X.iec958-stereo\n\nChange the sink name to match the one in your machine. You can decide to configure a friendlier name --which means that you should configure that in your pulseaudio settings file-- but I just used the given name by looking it with pacmd list-sinks.\nIt's not an elegant solution, I will probably try to use a system-wide configuration as suggested by @Anthony in my next rig, but if you have a lot of cards and just want to share one or few sink/source, this is a more \"surgical\" solution.\n", "Q: Problem with `sudo halt` command  \nPossible Duplicate:\nDifference between “halt” and “shutdown now”? \n\nWhen you execute a command ( sudo halt ) Command System stops working \nSo you execute this command on another set of computers and the result was that the freeze system\n\nA: sudo halt will halt the machine, and on some hardware also power it down.  sudo halt -p will power off the system.  \n\nA: The shutdown command can be used to shutdown or reboot the system.

I thought that I had set syndaemon to disable the touchpad while I type, and for 0.8 seconds afterwards. In order to change the default touchpad delay of 2.0 seconds, which is hard-coded into the touchpad settings dialog, I unchecked \"Disable touchpad while typing\" and added \"syndaemon -i 0.8 -K -R -t\" to the list of startup applications. Most of the time now, the touchpad doesn't register taps while I type, as I want. However, sometimes while typing, the cursor still flicks to a random spot in the text box, even while I am in the middle of typing. I don't take anywhere near 0.8 seconds between keystrokes - what could be happening here?\nTo verify that syndaemon is running with the correct options when the unwanted behavior occurs, I run:\n$ ps -ef | grep syndaemon\nuser      1840  1747  0 Sep23 ?        00:00:00 syndaemon -i 0.8 -K -R -t\n\nEverything seems fine. What could the problem be? How do I go about finding out if syndaemon is to blame?\n\nA: \n-t  Only disable tapping and scrolling, not mouse movements, in response to keyboard activity.\n\nSee man syndaemon for more info.\nBasically, you've disabled tapping and scrolling, but not movement with that command. Try something like this instead:\nsyndaemon -i 0.8 -K -R\n\n\nA: The only way I've found to make syndaemon work in its current incarnation is to disable the XRecord support (it doesn't seem to work at all), and use -m 50 (that is, poll every 50 milliseconds).\nSo: \nsyndaemon -m 50\n\nHowever, this seems to make the keyboard lose keypresses and flip to \"shift always down\" modes and such instead, so essentially syndaemon seems to be useless.  The only way to use a touchpad is to manually disable the touchpad with a keyboard shortcut.\n\nA: I've been plagued with this problem for some time as well. I run in a terminal\nwhile true; do synclient|grep TouchpadOff; sleep 0.5; done\n\nThen type in a different window some keys.\nI noticed that it outputs TouchpaddOff=1 as soon as you type small letters, but capitals (Shift+letter) are NOT disabling keypad. Cursor and mouse always jump when using capital letters. I looked in the syndaemon source, and it seems the -k and -K options are the culprit. If you press Shift to use a capital, the touchpad can get re-enabled. It's a bug. But a workaround is to remove -k and -K\nI use\nsyndaemon -i 0.8 -d -R\n\nand everything works fine.\n", "Q: Update drivers for TL-WN851ND Today I bought a new PCI wireless card, TP-Link WN851ND, with Atheros AR9227 chipset.\nIt has 2 antennas and is compatible with Wifi N so I thought it would improve the quality of the signal. But after installing it on my computer, the result is the opposite to what was expected. It doesn't connect to my network, while my old Wifi BG card connect without problems, I created an access point from my SmartPhone to try the card, and it worked, but is very slow loading pages. In Windows 7, it works perfectly, so I think the problem is the driver. \nI have 12.04 with kernel 3.2.0.31, is there a way to update the driver or I can apply a patch to improve the performance of the card?\nOtherwise, anyone know if there is a work in progress to improve compatibility with this chipset, or is it better to change the card and buy one with better driver compatibility?\nAnd finally, which wireless N compatible chipsets have good support under Linux/Ubuntu?\n\nA: *\n\n*You can update your driver by installing the linux-backport-modules. Open a terminal with CtrlAltT paste the following command, press Enter and reboot.:\nsudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-cw-3.3-precise-generic\n\n\n*Furthermore, if the above doesn't work, you have the possibility to install an upstream mainline kernel.\n\n*You can also try the windows-driver with Ndiswrapper.\n\n*If that all doesn't fix your problem, you can post a new bug on launchpad.

I just install postfix and configured it for local email only as a way to have a sendmail program and test my PHP scripts. \nMy question is, how can I use an HTML capable email client like Thunderbird to read local (root email, etc.) emails?\n\nA: Try Edit-> Account Settings and under Account Actions choose \"Add Other Account.\"\nChoose \"Unix Mailspool (Movemail)\" from the list and continue the configuration with your name, account, other settings.\nWhen you \"Get Mail\" it should look in /var/spool/mail on your system (localhost) for your mail file.\n\nA: i find this so much easier:\nafter installing postfix, you just make a symlink to the local /var/mail/username file inside thunderbird folders.\nin short:\n\nCreate a subfolder in \"Local Folders/Inbox\" called \"System\", or whatever. \n  Exit Thunderbird, move into ~/.thunderbird/xxxx.default/Mail/Local\\ Folders/\n  find the text file called System. Replace it with a symbolic link to /var/mail/username\n\ncd /home/pepito/.mozilla-thunderbird/xxxx.default/Mail/Local\\ Folders/\nrm System\nln -s /var/mail/username System\n\n(personally, i don't need smtp - so i didn't dig into it.)\n\nA: (When I am discussing the setup below, I am using desktop Ubuntu 12.04)\nNow that you have installed postfix (it can be reconfigured with sudo dpkg-reconfigure postfix) and now there is a file called main.cf in /etc/postfix, Thunderbird can be set up to read any system emails. However, I have found that it often takes a bit more time than has been suggested if you want to both receive from and send messages to root@localhost. \nFirst, as recommended in this discussion what worked for me was to use postfix's aliases feature to allow mail to be redirected; edit the aliases file with sudo nano /etc/aliases so that it looks like this (replace my user name with your own): \npostmaster:    root\nroot:   mike \n\nThen run sudo newaliases so that the configuration is updated.\nAs also noted in the above link, you need to create a .forward file containing your username and localhost: e.g. mike@localhost so that root's mail will be forwarded to you. To do this, enter these commands:\nsudo touch /root/.forward\n\nand then run    \nsudo nano /root/.forward\n\nto place your user: e.g. mike@localhost in the file and save it.\nIn addition, I found it was necessary to add your user to the mail group so that Thunderbird could access the mail files:\nsudo adduser $USER mail\n\nand then logout and login for the changes to take effect. There is no need to chown or chmod any files, as some articles might suggest.\n\nNow for the Thunderbird configuration. Go to edit > account settings > account actions > add other account > select Unix spoolmail and in the next screen put your username in the first box and place yourusername@localhost in the second box.\n\n\nNow, go to your new account in account settings and select server settings and select the local directory as /var/mail or /var/mail/username (if setup), as in the screenshot below.\n\nAs per the instructions in this article you will need to configure the smtp server if you want to test the account by sending a mail to root@localhost and then clicking get mail in Thunderbird to receive it, as root's mail is being redirected to youruser@localhost. \nGo to account settings > outgoing server and choose to add a new one. The settings should be as in the screenshot below:\n\nNow, finally test your account by composing a mail to root@localhost and then a few seconds later clicking get mail on your account. You should see an email like this:\n\nSome programs or logs will need to be configured so that they send mail to root, but that can be decided as you find the need. This article should hopefully be useful as it is not always straightforward to set up Thunderbird to receive local mail.\n", "Q: Is there a tool to manage dash lenses?

On boot I get the GRUB rescue prompt and I have to go through the following steps in order to boot normally:\nset root=(hd0,msdos6)\nset prefix=(hd0,msdos6)/boot/grub\ninsmod normal\nnormal\n\n(Those steps were found on another post on here!).\nI'm very tired of repeating this on every boot, how do I permanently fix GRUB?\n\nA: I would try running update-grub in order to build grub.conf / grub.cfg again.\nYou can try also using grub-install, but I think this one won't help.\nIf you want to read more, check first which version you have (GRUB 1 or 2) by running:\ndpkg -l | grep grub\n\nIf you have GRUB 2, you can use the following tutorial: http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/grub-2.html\nOf course be careful dealing with GRUB as we are talking about the boot process, which is a  sensitive mechanism.\n\nA: Solve ultimate case of grub rescue failure:\nproblems: 1.i386-pc not found****normal mode not working cp not working search.file not working. All can be solved by the following commands, Works with Ubuntu 18.04 also.\nStep1: Find the root folder containing directory.\nls\n\nFor example, if the root folder is in (hd0, gpt4), then type\n\nls (hd0, 4)/\n\nYou will see some files or folders:\n\nNow if you are lucky then do the following:\nset root=(hd0, 4)\nset prefix=(hd0, 4)/boot/grub/\ninsmode normal\nnormal\n\nIf you are lucky then it will solve your problem.\nSometimes people have problems like cannot find 1386-pc folder. In that case you have to look where is your grub folder. If you have a problem like:\n\nIn this case, you need to find the folder grub2. If you have grub2 and inside that folder you could have your i386-pc folder. Then you need to type \nprefix=(hd0, 4)/grub2/\n\nit will work.\nIf you do not have grub2 and could not locate i386-pc folder then do the following:\ngrub rescue>set root=(hd0, 4)\ngrub rescue>set prefix=(hd0, 4)/usr/lib/grub\ngrub rescue>insmode normal\ngrub rescue>normal\n\nafter executing this command your grub rescue mode will go to grub menu.

From there you can choose from the several available recovery options.\nIf it does not help then you need to download an ubuntu os, for example ubuntu 18.04. You can download from the following link:\nubuntu link\nMake a bootable drive and open your computer with that live disk. It will not harm any of your documents. See a video on how to do that.\nNow you have to find your i386-pc folder.

If the cp command is working then you can do this from grub menu also.\n\nA: It seems to me that update-grub assembles the grub.cfg, but you also need to (re-)run grub-install (or grub-setup?) to update the MBR / boot sectors  with the basic info -- on which partition to find the grub.cfg file & apparently these modules.\n\nA: When you get a GRUB rescue prompt, it means that the GRUB bootloader cannot locate its modules from the partition that contains them in /boot/grub. The reason for this is that the code that fits in the drive MBR record is tiny, and so its main purpose is to locate and load the rest of the bootloader code. Once it's loaded its modules it can present the GRUB menu and handle the rest of the boot process. If it can't find the modules, it presents a very limited rescue prompt.\nSo, what you are seeing is totally normal if you repartitioned, thereby breaking the reference the bootloader had to the partition containing the boot modules.\nSince you can boot manually, the simplest fix is to manually boot and reinstall the bootloader in the MBR so that it has the correct reference to your partition. The way to do that is:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nThis assumes you boot from /dev/sda (most cases, but if not, replace it with the correct drive).\nThis solution is far simpler than using the boot-repair, but if you are unsure this may be more suitable.\n\nA: The simplest way would be:\nsudo apt-get purge grub-pc grub-pc-bin\n\nThen:\nsudo apt-get install grub-pc grub-pc-bin\n\n\nA: To fix grub rescue go with following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*First thing is we have to start our OS only then after we can fix\ngrub.\n#to start OS-->\nerror: unknown filesystem.\nEntering rescue mode...\ngrub rescue>\n\nWhen you see such an error first we have to check for “Filesystem” is ext2'\ngrub rescue> ls        # type 'ls' and hit enter to see drive partition.\n(hd0) (hd0,msdos6) (hd0,msdos5) (hd0,msdos4) ...   # you will see such things \n\nthis are our drives now we have to check which one is ext2.\ngrub rescue>ls (hd0,msdos6)\nerror: disk 'hd,msdos6' not found.\n\ngo for another drives until you get “Filesystem is ext2”.\ngrub rescue>ls (hd0,msdos5)\nerror: disk 'hd,msdos5' not found.\ngrub rescue>ls (hd0,msdos2)\n(hd0,msdos2): Filesystem is ext2        # this is what we want\n\nnow set the path\ngrub rescue>set boot=(hd0,msdos2)\ngrub rescue>set prefix=(hd0,msdos6)/boot/grub\ngrub rescue>insmod normal\ngrub rescue>normal\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Now just fix grub by following command on any Ubuntu\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nsudo apt-get update\n# to update grub\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nmake sure you must update grub after login into OS\n\nA: I just couldn't make it work only with grub instructions, even making it carefully.

This was adopted in 5.4.0-rc1, and remains in place in the Ubuntu Quantal (and likely later) packages (this was a package-only change, not an upstream one).\nThe solution (as outlined in my blog post on this matter) is to change where your proxy_pass points to, so that it points to unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock which is now the default location for php5-fpm to set its listener to (this apples to php5 package versions 5.4.0-rc1 and later in both Ubuntu and Debian at the time of this post, and only to the versions in the main repositories, and not PPAs).\nThis applies to Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal) and later!\n", "Q: Postfix + Dovecot - not receiving mail in vmail directory i have been spending countless hours on this and now i figured id come to the 'internet' for help.\nI have installed a new install of postfix + dovecot + mysql.\nRight now, i am able to receive email from my one mapped account 'sean@domain.com'\nbut for some reason all messages get inserted into /var/mail/sean\nthe expected location is: /var/vmail/domain.com/sean\nill list the key pieces of code ive used to get this working.\npostfix master.cf\ndovecot   unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe\nflags=DRhu user=vmail:mail argv=/usr/lib/dovecot/deliver -d ${recipient}\n\npostfix main.cf\nvirtual_transport = dovecot\ndovecot_destination_recipient_limit = 1\n\nDovecot 10-mail.conf\nmail_location = maildir:/var/vmail/%d/%n\nmail_uid = vmail\nmail_gid = mail\nfirst_valid_uid = 150\nlast_valid_uid = 150\n\nDovecot 10-auth.conf\ndisable_plaintext_auth = yes\n!include auth-sql.conf.ext\n\nDovecot auth-sql.conf.ext\npassdb {\ndriver = sql\nargs = /etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext\n}\nuserdb {\ndriver = sql\nargs = /etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext\n}\n\nDovecot dovecot-sql.conf.ext\ndriver = mysql\nconnect = host=localhost dbname=mail user=mail password=P@ssw0rd\ndefault_pass_scheme = MD5-CRYPT\n\npassword_query = \\\nSELECT username as user, password, '/var/vmail/%d/%n' as userdb_home, \\\n'maildir:/var/vmail/%d/%n' as userdb_mail, 150 as userdb_uid, 8 as userdb_gid \\\nFROM mailbox WHERE username = '%u' AND active = '1'\n\nuser_query = \\\nSELECT '/var/vmail/%d/%n' as home, 'maildir:/var/vmail/%d/%n' as mail, \\\n150 AS uid, 8 AS gid, concat('dirsize:storage=', quota) AS quota \\\nFROM mailbox WHERE username = '%u' AND active = '1'\n\nAnd that pretty much does it for the config part of what i'm trying to do.\nAny ideas of what i'm doing wrong? {  I should be bald by this time tomorrow  :)   }\n\nA: I guess you are confusing two categories of users.

Can I recover my home directory from /dev/null?\n\nA: The accepted existing answers are at least partially incorrect. /dev/null is a \"black hole\" but you can't move directories to it. The whole mv ~ /dev/null thing appears to be some sort of hoax. It looks really dangerous but it shouldn't actually work.\nStill, I wouldn't recommend testing it on a home directory with irreplaceable data. Here's a quick test harness with a new user called test. We'll ask them to move their home into the ether.\n$ sudo adduser test\n$ sudo usermod -aG sudo test\n\n$ sudo su test  # we are now running as test but let's check\n$ cd ~; pwd\n/home/test\n\n$ sudo mv ~ /dev/null \nmv: cannot overwrite non-directory ‘/dev/null’ with directory ‘/home/test’\n\nIf something you wanted does end up in /dev/null, the recovery procedure is the same as any other data loss (as if you typed rm). Ideally stop using that disk as quickly as possible and start using something like TestDisk to recover. Ourdata-recovery tag can be really helpful here.\n\nJust to clarify that you can sudo mv file /dev/null where file is a single file but this will not delete the file, it will replace /dev/null with that file. This has all sorts of fairly important ramifications because things rely on being able to redirect to /dev/null. Anyway, here's a simple proof of this as well as a fix in case you do end up moving a file over the top:\n$ echo \"this is my file\" > test\n$ cat test\nthis is my file\n\n$ sudo mv test /dev/null\n$ cat /dev/null\nthis is my file\n\n# Fix this!\n$ sudo rm /dev/null\n$ sudo mknod -m 0666 /dev/null c 1 3\n\nObviously if you want to rescue your file be quick and cp /dev/null ~/Desktop/file (or somesuch) before you replace it with the system definition of /dev/null.\n\nA: In such a case, the first thing to do is to stop the system. The hope is that the files are still somewhere on the hard disk; by stopping the system we want to avoid that they are overwritten (if removed, they are marked as free space).\nThe second thing to do is to read data recovery manual and follow the instructions therein. Unfortunately, this succeeds as often as not.\nThe third is to check your backups (there are two sorts of people: those who do backups and those who will; hope you are the former kind).\n", "Q: What's the difference in content between the Ubuntu and Lubuntu Software Centers?

If anybody has any ideas as to what is causing this or how to fix it I would appreciate it.\nSystem information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Computer: Toshiba Satellite L655-S5160 \n\n*Audio Driver: Conexant Audio Driver(v4.119.0.60; 07-14-2010; 41.89M)\n\n\nA: I was going to suggest updating your driver to the next version which could help, however I discussed your question with a more experienced Ask Ubuntu member on chat and this is what that member's opinion was on your question: \n\nI saw this one - no good idea. Looks like a looping system sound.\n  ALSA sound drivers reside in the kernel. It usually is hard stuff to replace these with proprietary ones.\n\nThe audio dev ppa was an idea suggested HOWEVER (BIG DISCLAIMER) more often than not this can cause serious problems with your system due to the fact that they are \"in development\" and not fully tested so if you do decide to try this, make sure you've got a full back-up and accept that things could break. \nIn short if this problem isn't causing you serious pain on the ears and I'd live with it until there is a major driver update which I'd install, however until then I personally wouldn't try the audio dev ppa as of yet as its quite risky. \nI'd suggest you get the next major driver update and put a bounty on your question afterwards if the problem persists and hopefully someone with more experience/knowledge about hardware and drivers will be able to help you out.\n", "Q: How do I make sure that Canonical get affiliate benefits when I buy from amazon? Ubuntu 12.10 has a new feature to search and buy from Amazon, either from the Dash, or from a unity WebApp. This is quite controversial, but for my part, I quite ok with it. So when I buy something from Amazon (which I did before, and I'll do tomorow), I'd like to make sure the affiliate revenue are really given to Ubuntu/Canonical: I would have bought anyway, so financing my prefered OS by doing so makes sense to me.\nHow does it work, and how can I know my order get accounted to Ubuntu/Canonical affiliate program ? What if I navigate the amazon site before I buy ? What if I login or logout from Amazon, does Ubuntu still benefit from my order ?\n\nA: First of all note that it's not just Amazon. It's a shopping lens, which can be used for numerous backend stores, of which Amazon is one.\nThe Amazon affiliate referral happens if you've arrived at the Amazon property via a 'tagged' link. Both links clicked via the dash which go to Amazon sites, and the shortcut in the launcher will add the tag. The tag adds a cookie which lasts for 24 hours. If you buy anything during that period, Canonical will get some affiliate revenue.\nPersonally I've just \"pinned\" a tab in my browser (i.e. opened whenever I open the browser) which goes to http://www.amazon.co.uk/?tag=u1webapp-uk-21 (which is right for the UK, but will differ for other territories) which ensures the cookie is always there for me. So even if I don't follow links via the dash or use the launcher, I still give revenue to Canonical (my employer ;) ).\n\n\n*\n\n*For the US: http://www.amazon.com/?tag=u1webapp-20\n\n*For Canada: http://www.amazon.ca/?tag=u1webapp-ca-20\n\n*For Germany: http://amazon.de/?tag=u1webapp-21\nI also do this on 12.04 where I don't have the shopping lens installed.\n", "Q: How to group icons based on category on the desktop?

I have MSI vr630x, but my panel with buttons for WiFi, camera and bluetooth are missing (it has been removed at all). \nIs there a way to turn devices on? I have these devices working, I just don't have buttons to turn them on.\n\nA: For Wifi you can use NetworkManager or Wicd or KnetworkManager or other tool.\nFor Bluetooth you can use blueman:\n\nBlueman is a GTK+ Bluetooth Manager. Blueman is designed to be simple and intuitive for everyday bluetooth tasks such as:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Connecting to 3G/EDGE/GPRS via DUN profile.\n  \n*Connecting to/Creating bluetooth networks\n  \n*Connecting to input devices\n  \n*Connecting to audio devices\n  \n*Sending/Receiving/Browsing files via OBEX\n  \n*Pairing\n  \n\nInstallation:\nsudo apt-get install blueman\n\nFor camera you can use Cheese.\nGreat site on setting up your camera here.\nJust search for a few tools and try them out, to see what you like the most.\n\nA: You can enable back your default indicator manually on your panel. \nOpen terminal Ctrl + Alt + T and run this command:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist \"['all']\" \n\n", "Q: Where does Nautilus store bookmark names?

When I use the brightness changing buttons Unity changes the brightness by two levels each time to create a nice effect.  However, I only have about 10 different brightness settings and so this effect has caused a reduction in brightness settings to 5.  I change my brightness regularly to suit the lighting in the room I'm in, but am unable to do this so effectively now that the number of levels has been reduced.\nIs there any way of turning off this brightness effect and controlling my brightness setting more sensitively?\nThank you for your time.\nEDIT: It may not be 2 levels it changes at a time but 3, I've worked this out as the brightness control panel allows you to set the brightness accurately and there seem to be a couple of settings that the button misses completely when I change the brightness with the buttons.\n\nA: You can use a brightness indicator applet to change the brighness:\n\nIt can be downloaded from here. It works with 11.04 and 11.10 and is said to work with 12.04.\n\nUpdate: You can try this but this will change your brightness hot keys:\n1. Install compizconfig-settings-manager and xbacklight.\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager xbacklight\n\n2. Run it and go to commands. Do as shown:\n\n3. Add key bindings:\n\n4.

The only time it is 'off' is when the GPU determines that it is not needed e.g Your web browsing and not playing games,\n", "Q: Using USB-to-Ethernet with Ubuntu 12.04 Being a newbie, please excuse if the technical jargon used is not a universally accepted one :)\nI have a particular device (say device A) whose USB2.0 driver is available from Linux community. Ubuntu 12.04 based PC is able to detect that device via the available driver.\nMy requirement is to ensure that PC can exchange the command as well as data with device A over TCP/IP packets (in other words, instead of just a USB based driver, there should be a TCP/IP wrapper over the device USB driver and still does the same job as the USB driver was doing before).\nBought an USB (Female) to RJ-45 adapter, connected Device A (male) USB to the USB Female end of the adapter and the Ethernet end connected to the router. PC also is connected to the same router so that both Device A and the PC have the IP address in the same subnet range. So the packets produced by the device A can be routed to the PC via some binding( not sure how I can achieve this, but conceptual idea). \nHere are the issues I can see as of now\n\n\n*\n\n*USB to RJ-45 is just a hardware signal conversion and not a NIC in itself and hence no MAC/IP ADDRESS assigned. Can we bind a virtual NIC created in PC with this connector?\n\n*Any available USB TO IP command as well as data translation wrappers available?\ne.g. command for the device A on Ethernet converted to command for the device A on USB which is then acted upon the device as a command from the USB driver\nThere is some missing link in my understanding and hence it would be of great help if you can bounce off some ideas on how I can take this forward so that Device A and PC exchange data over IP.\nDevice A is just a webcam type of device which will just stream out the video data.\n\nA: From your description, I understand you want to connect your usb webcam to other computer via an IP network. As John Siu wrote, they are two different protocols, both in physical part (electrical) and in the software part.\nYou will always need something who 'speak' both protocols and translate one in the other. Well, translate is not the better word, because what is normally done is grab the packet as is from one medium and transport it over the other medium as a payload.\nI've found this project googling a bit:\nhttp://usbip.sourceforge.net/\n\nUSB/IP Project aims to develop a general USB device sharing system over IP network. To share USB devices between computers with their full functionality, USB/IP encapsulates \"USB I/O messages\" into TCP/IP payloads and transmits them between computers.\n\nThis is only the software part, you also need some hardware, and for this you have the pocket size computers like BeagleBoard or Raspberry PI\nBut there are already assembled tools available in the market like this one:\nhttp://www.camsecure.co.uk/CamsecureUSBtoIP.html\nnote: I never use neither the usbip neither the CamsecureUSBtoIP. I just wrote this two links to help you in the investigation.\n\nA: Short answer\nIf the webcam is just a \"plain webcam\"(logitec or other common brand or no brand) for skype or computer live chat, the short answer is NO.\nLong Answer\n\n*\n\n*USB and Ethernet are two different things\nWhen something is plug into ethernet port, the ethernet card expect ethernet protocol handshaking. A plain USB device is not capable/program to do that. For a device able to do that, it is likely that it come with a usb-ethernet connector.\n\n\n*Power\nUSB device draw power from the usb connection. Some ethernet devices are able to use power from a specific type of network switch that support Power Over Ethernet(PoE). There are no(I never heard or come across) network card supporting that.\n\n\n*Theoretical Possibility\nWith all the above said, there are away the possibility that someone come up with a special driver that REPLACE the network card driver and make it talk USB protocol with the specific device. But a special cable(slice out power line pair and connect to a power adapter) will be needed to supply power.\nAlternative\n\n*\n\n*Just use a very long usb cable. If the webcam support USB 2.0, you can use a 5m cable.\n\n\n*There are existing webcam support IP networking in the market. Search for \"ip webcam\".

Thank you for the help.\n\nA: Most likely, there is a problem with the particular Ubuntu mirror you have selected as your software source.\nMaybe you should try changing it. Go to Ubuntu Software center, and from the \"Edit\" menu choose \"Software sources\". You will see a window like the one beneath; choose another \"Download from\" location and try to run the updates again.\n\n\nA: open the  /etc/apt/sources.list by your favorite text viewer then you can do one of the following:\nEither \nCorrect your software source list by adding /ubuntu to the entries that make the problem for you.\nOR\nYou can just remove those ppa's that make this problem if you dont want to use anymore \n", "Q: Unreal Torunament (UT99) no sound in 12.04? I've been trying to get sound working in Unreal Torunament for a couple of days now.\nI'm using the native Unreal Tournament version, not wine or something like that.\nI have sound in all other games and media applications that I have tried.\nIn older ubuntu versions it worked fine. I'm now using kubuntu 12.04, I have all the alsa-oss and oss-compat packages installed.\nI have followed most of the advice out there, and it all seems to fall on padsp and aoss.\nMy problem, however, is that even when trying to use padsp or aoss, I can't get any sound at all.\n(Note UT has two output modes: ALAudio and Generic(OSS), I have tried both).\nIs there some configuration required to use padsp or aoss correctly?\nI have ran it like padsp ./ut and aoss ./ut\nIf using the AL backend in UT I get (both aoss and padsp give this):\nBound to ALAudio.so\nopen /dev/dsp: Invalid argument\nAudio initialization failed.\nIf using the OSS backend in UT I get (both aoss and padsp give this):\nBound to Audio.so\nFailed to open audio device.\nAudio initialization failed.\nNote that so far, I have gotten absolutely no sound.\nThanks for any help!\n\nA: padsp did not work for me on XUbuntu 18.04 64-bit.  I got an error about ELF class:\n\nERROR: ld.so: object '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pulseaudio/libpulsedsp.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded (wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64): ignored.\n\nIf you look at the /usr/bin/padsp file (it's a BASH script) you will see that it specifically refers to the x86_64 library.  That link suggests creating a second padsp32 script, but since this is such a unique binary, I decided to copy and paste the relevant code into the script that calls ut-bin, with modifications to use i386.\nFirst, make sure you have the i386 version of libpulsedsp:\nsudo apt-get install libpulsedsp:i386\n\nThen edit the script you use to launch UT (mine is at /usr/local/games/ut/ut) and place these lines before the call to ut-bin (or in my case a variable that contains \"ut-bin\"):\nif [ x\"$LD_PRELOAD\" = x ] ; then\n   LD_PRELOAD=\"/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/pulseaudio/libpulsedsp.so\"\nelse\n   LD_PRELOAD=\"$LD_PRELOAD /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/pulseaudio/libpulsedsp.so\"\nfi\nexport LD_PRELOAD\n\nI should also mention that, while using ALAudioSubsystem causes a substantial delay in audio, when I try the GenericAudioSubsystem, the game crashes.  The best workaround I've found so far is to edit ~/.loki/ut/System/UnrealTournament.ini and, under [ALAudio.ALAudioSubsystem], replace Latency=40 with Latency=0.  This does not eliminate the audio delay, but significantly decreases it.\n\nA: Ok, after trying and failing a lot I finally have sound in Unreal Tournament. It also runs at the right speed, so no more problems! Here are the important things I did:\nIn ~/.loki/ut/System/UnrealTournament.ini :\n;AudioDevice=ALAudio.ALAudioSubsystem\nAudioDevice=Audio.GenericAudioSubsystem\n\nIn UnrealTournament/bin/x86/ut (note this file should be where you installed UT),\nline 84 should read:\nexec padsp \"./ut-bin\" -log $*\n\nThus running the executable with padsp, I have tried aoss here also, didn't work.\n\nI think though, after several upgrades of my ubuntu install. That my sound setup have completely borked itself.\nI followed this Ubuntu Forums post to delete all my pulseaduio configuration (or misconfiguration):\n$ rm -r ~/.pulse ~/.asound* ~/.pulse-cookie\nsudo rm /etc/asound.conf\n\nYou should probably make a backup of these files before attacking them. In addition, I reinstalled the pulseaudio packages and removed the alsa-oss package. Note however that this was probably not required.\nHope this can help someone else!\n\nA: Try to install osspd:\nsudo apt-get install osspd\n\nor from here.\nI had the same problem with Heroes 3 and Rune, and just find this package in synaptic. Now all sound related issues gone. You can run any older OSS app with it, and don't need to apply any file tweaks or command line option, just install it and run the application or game you want.\n", "Q: Problem with SNMP and MIBs I am installing Zabbix to monitor via snmp some devices from a machine running Ubuntu 12.04 server.\nThere is a problem with MIB definitions, since snmp commands do no properly translate some of the MIBs. I have already installed the \"snmp-mibs-downloader\" package, so the files containing the MIB descriptions are properly installed.\nThe MIB are only translated to obtain the numeric key (the MIB files are accessible to the snmp commands), but the results returned by the snmpget command do not properly  translate the key. The zabbix templates that I am using do expect the key translated (SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime.0) , so, the current results are not recognised and these are ignored.\nTest case:\n$ snmptranslate -On SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime.0\n.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0\n\n$ snmpget -v 2c -c public 192.168.1.1 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0\niso.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0 = Timeticks: (2911822510) 337 days, 0:23:45.10\n\nOn another machine (running a very old Red Hat based distribution), the snmp commands perform both, the direct and reverse traslation, as expected:\n# snmptranslate -On SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime.0\n.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0\n\n# snmpget -v 2c -c public 192.168.1.1 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0\nSNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks: (2911819485) 337 days, 0:23:14.85\n\nWhat is the problem on my Ubuntu box? Is there something I am missing?\n\nA: I find that the following works for me with snmp and snmpd installed on my system:\n\n$ snmpget -m SNMPv2-MIB -v 2c -c public 127.0.0.1 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0\nSNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks: (1422579) 3:57:05.79\n\nThere seem to be various overlapping MIBS, so I think it may be necessary to specify which module you want with the -m option.\nThe following also works:\n\n$ snmpget -v 2c -c public 127.0.0.1 SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime.0\nSNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks: (129146) 0:21:31.46\n\nSo it seems that if you specify a numeric OID  without specifying a MIB module snmpget returns a numeric display, but if you qualify the request with a symbolic reference to a particular MIB that MIB definition is used to interpret the response.\nSee also man snmp.conf\n", "Q: Virtualbox on Ubuntu Host: Access guests by hostname I have several VirtualBox appliances (Windows, Linux) each of them configured with two network adapters:\n\n\n*\n\n*NAT for accessing the internet\n\n*host-only for hosts <> hosts and hosts <> guest communication\n\n\nProblem is, I can only communicate by IP address. I want to communicate by hostname, ie. I want to be able to  reach any host from any other host (or guest) by using the hostname. Is this possible?\nI already have a host-only adapter (vboxnet0) on the host machine, and networking is fine, but I would like to avoid assigning static IPs to each appliance.\n\nA: I suggest you use Multicast DNS to fix this. \nUbuntu is using this by default via Avahi.\nThe Windows host needs an Avahi-client for it to discover other Avahi-services. If your host already uses some Apple software this is probably already there via a service called Bonjour. However, if this is not already installed then a small version of Bonjour is available for download here: Bonjour Print Services. After installation you should be able to access your guest via .local. \nNote: The mDNS system seem to use the .local postfix by default. So, if your hostname is \"dev.myapp.com\", then the actual hostname will be \"dev.myapp.com.local\". \nCopied from my own answer at superuser.com.\n\nA: According to the manual (slightly on a different topic):\n\nthere is no DNS resolver for internal networking\n\nTherefore you'll need to install one in either of your virtual hosts.\nRelated: VB Forum\n\nA: You need a DNS server to convert the ip to a hostname and vice versa and this unfortunetly this is not supported in Vbox \n\nA: TO ALLOW OTHERS (WINDOWS CLIENT, CONFIGURED LINUX CLIENTS) REACH YOUR HOST BY HOSTNAME:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install / configure / start nmbd service, provided by samba.\nnmbd  -  NetBIOS name server to provide NetBIOS over IP naming services\n   to clients\nTO ALLOW YOUR HOST TO REACH OTHERS (WINDOWS CLIENT, CONFIGURED LINUX CLIENTS) BY HOSTNAME:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/nsswitch.conf\nChange the line\nhosts: files dns\n\nto\nhosts: files dns wins\n\n\n\n*\n\n*install winbind\napt-get install winbind\n", "Q: How to integrate the Run command to be a Unity lens?

But modern versions of deja-dup (Ubuntu 12.04 or above) should not start a scheduled backup if it can't resolve the hostname.\n\nA: You can redirect standard output this way:\n<command> > <file>\n\nTo redirect standard error, use this:\n<command> 2> <file>\n\nTo redirect both, use this:\n<command> > <file> 2> <file>\n\nIf you don't want to actually save the file, you can redirect to /dev/null.

Screen sessions can be attached and detached, but are nominally meant only to be used by the same user, so if you want to share them between users.\nElse if you wish you can trace the process and see what it is doing with strace:\nstrace -e trace=open -p 22254 -s 80 -o output.txt\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-p PID: Attach to the process with the process ID PID and begin tracing.\n\n*-s SIZE: Specify the maximum string size to print (the default is 32).\n\n*-o filename: Write the trace output to the file filename rather than to screen (stderr).\n\n", "Q: How do I enable Backlit Keyboard on Asus N56VM I recently bought an ASUS N56VM which is suppose to ship with a backlit keyboard. However on startup and when dark there is no backlit keyboard. When pressing the Fn+F3/F4 buttons, the animation for increasing/decreasing the brightness of the keyboard does appear. How do I fix this problem. Its an ASUS N56VM-S4034V.\n\nA: I have recently corresponded with Asus Support on this subject and they have confirmed that\n\n“…there are no UK N56VM models that have a backlit keyboard. …” –\n  “…the backlight feature … is normally enabled by press FN + F$ to\n  illuminate. …” – “…the key will have an image of a keyboard and\n  sunlight … if it does not have that, then this unit will not have that\n  function. …”\n\nTrust that assists\n\nA: If your keyboard lights flash on when you turn it on, then there is a problem with the firmware. If you use Winflash to update to 214, you will lose the lights. To do it without losing the lights, make sure the keyboard lights are set to off and then update from inside the BIOS using EasyFlash.\n\nA: In Ubuntu, all keys are programmed and controlled by X windows, keyboard drivers, Window Managers etc.   So all functions keys which behaved in certain ways (eg, to dimmer the backlit) as documented for Windows OS, have to be reprogrammed for Ubuntu.\nReading this for details:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2185305\nExecuting this as root:\necho 3 > /sys/class/leds/asus::kbd_backlight/brightness\nI managed to get the keys all lighted up.   And here is to off the light completely:\necho 0 > /sys/class/leds/asus::kbd_backlight/brightness\nValues in between will have different brightness.\n", "Q: gedit snippets plugin not working for encodings other than UTF-8 I just ran into a problem with the snippets plugin of gedit 3.4.1 running on Ubuntu 12.04.  The problem is that the snippets plugin stops working (i. e., doesn't react to keyboard shortcuts and tab-completion) when a file has an encoding other than UTF-8, e. g. ISO-8859-1.

In the settings, you go to shared folders and add the directory you want to share (and the options - read only or read-write)\nAfter you boot your virtual machine, you can get to this shared folder using the Network Places icon and adding a new network place for this folder (will be in \\\\VBOXSVR\\the_name_you_gave).\nYou need the virtualbox guest additions installed in your guest machine to do this.

At the moment I can use the workaround to lock screen and I get a switch user button from there, but it would be nicer to have the menu option as I was used to.  \n\n\n\nA: Gnome 3 displays the Switch User option only when you have multiple normal user accounts on your system with a user id between 1000 and 29999 (Debian, Ubuntu). \nIf you want to switch to a user account within the reserved id range of your distribution, you can lock the screen with Super+L or Ctrl+Alt+L and click on Log in as another user below the login form.\n\nA: It's there for me in 12.04.

And also tell me how i can implement encryption and Decryption of files and folders in Ubuntu during Log in and Log off?\n\nA: In essence, you have three main options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Encrypt a whole drive\n\n*Encrypt your home directory (where your user-specific files are)\n\n*Encrypt a particular directory in your home directory (for example, if you want only to protect some sensitive data, but not everything).\n\n\nIf you did not choose option 1. or 2. during installation of Ubuntu, the simplest solution is to select option 3, or, which is far more complex, migrate your home to an encrypted directory (see this guide).\nOption 3, in a simple form, creates an encrypted folder called \".Private\" in your home directory, and while you are logged in, you can view your files in a decrypted form in a folder called \"Private\" (without a dot). To do that, open a terminal window (press CtrlAltT), and copy the following commands:\nsudo apt-get install ecryptfs-utils\necryptfs-setup-private\n\nYou will be asked first for your login password, and then for another password to encrypt the directory.\nAn alternative to the above is using encfs to encrypt just any directory on your disk; however, a little more command line will be necessary.\nsudo apt-get install encfs\n\nTo setup a directory encrypted in /path/to/encrypted and accessible in decrypted form in /path/to/decrypted, do\nmkdir -p /path/to/encrypted /path/to/decrypted\nencfs /path/to/encrypted /path/to/decrypted\n\nThe first time you run it for a given directory, you will be prompted for a password and a few setup options. To unmount it (such that no decrypted files are visible), type\nfusermount -u /path/to/decrypted\n\nTo mount it again (\"decrypt\" it), type again\nmkdir -p /path/to/encrypted /path/to/decrypted\n\n", "Q: Emacs package without GTK Is there, in the \"regular\" Debian/Ubuntu repositories, a package for emacs without GTK support?

The logout screen in Lubuntu 12.04 has several options. I'd like to remove or inactivate the \"suspend\" and \"hibernate\" options.

This damages them and reduces their lifespan. This is why some people take the battery out when using the laptop plugged in; but I don't want to do this, because then a power outage could cause data loss.\nOn the Samsung N150 netbook, there is a BIOS SETUP option to set the max battery charge level to 80%. Then you can leave the netbook plugged in, with the battery installed, and still preserve the battery's lifespan.\nI want to do it with my HP G42-230BR laptop, which does not have such a BIOS SETUP option.\nIt should still be possible with software, right?\nI have Googled and did not found how to do it:\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=ubuntu|linux+partial+charge|recharge+battery+life\nDo you know how to do it?\nThank you very much for your attention\n\nA: Slightly duplicate of How can I limit battery charging to 80% capacity?, but I won't mind. And for those that say the 80% thing is a myth, that's not what Jorge ask for; he wanted to know how to enable it, whether or not it's a myth...discuss that elsewhere.\nIf you don't have an option in your BIOS, it's difficult to impossible to override the hardware in your computer without the proprietary company that made your computer (HP) making a special script for you. Look for something like that, otherwise, it won't work.\nMaybe look in your BIOS again. Maybe also (if you are daring enough), to update your BIOS. This is tricky, but I will not explain it here. That MIGHT allow you enable this setting. I still think that it would be in your BIOS if anywhere, check over it again. If you do update your BIOS, ensure it's a newer version, AND that it includes the \"enable batter saver\" option that you want (you may have to read the update notes (bleah!)).\nHope this helps! If it does, +1 me :).\nZzzach...\n\nA: There is 80% charge and there is 80% charge.\nElectronic equipment (cell phones, laptops, etc) require a certain minimum voltage to be able to function.  Simpler devices, like flash lights, can function down to near zero charge (albeit whether usable is another question)\nWhen manufacturers state that a battery should not fall below 80%, they talk about the kind of depletion that you get when you use a battery till it is completely flat, eg due to a continuous drain, such as by flash light globe.\nA cellphone, or laptop however would cut out long before this... probably even before a battery reaches this 80% limit.  This is due to the internal resistance of the battery going up, which causes a voltage drop under load.  If the battery is near enough to fully charged, e.g above a certain threshold, this voltage drop doesn't show up when using a simple meter to test battery charge, as these meters does not put enough load on the battery to cause the internal resistance to have a real effect.\nCell phones and such have \"intelligent\" managed batteries to be able to report to you how long you can still use the battery, e.g before it reach the threshold where the internal resistance causes the supplied voltage to go too low to be able to power the device.\nSo there are two measures of battery charge:\n\n\n*\n\n*That reported by the battery indicator on the cellphone is \"time until battery reaches cut-off threshold\"\n\n*The actual amount of charge resident in the battery, regardless of whether it can be used by a specific device.\n\n\nThis complicates the whole situation:  How do you control the device to not use the battery below a certain threshold (Type 2 above), when that threshold is measured on a different scale compared to that reported by the battery level management circuitry (Type 1 above)\nI'm quite sure there is no way to do this, but in all likeliness your device will never deplete the battery to below the 80% manufacturer safety margin, so this is not a real issue.\n", "Q: My machine's information \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to list all installed packages?\nHow do I list installed software with the installed size? \n\nis there a way to know what are the packages installed on my machine, detailed information, like each software and its version?

As soon as I've removed bcm STA drivers, the adapter came back to life, finds my router, connects, fetches an IP address from the DHCP server (mikrotik) but no browsing. \nOn terminal, I've ping'd my router (192.168.88.1) and after a good amount of time, it starts answering \"unreachable\". Through cable everything seems fine. Other devices run fine under this same network (as this same netbook did before with the STA drivers).\nIs there a way I can run the previous driver (it fails with blacklist error on jockey log, even after I've put an # mark before the blacklist marking on the blacklist file) or are there any other options?\nUpdate: Yes, everything comes out fine from the DHCP server. When I try to PING the provided address from another station, it goes \"unreachable\". (that also happens after a good amount of time on the netbook, updated above) Setting all the IPv4 info manually, the same occurs. The addresses are on the accordingly range. \nI've posted the question as \"last resort\" since I've tried everything that I could found on web so far, even issues that weren't like mine but involved similar hardware. With ATI'ś proprietary graphics driver from AMD website I did not have such issues, since the STA driver worked flawlessly. But once MESA drivers were installed, I can't enable it anymore. I'd rather stick with the open source drivers, because the overall machine seems to run faster and there are no hibernation issues.\n\nA: Made it work. If you're an AspireOne 722 owner, the best thing to do is:\nFirst: follow the steps on the link below, be sure to install the open source video drivers, since it also installs drivers for several devices on your netbook:\nUBUNTU - INSTALLATION OF ACER ASPIRE ONE 722 (AO722)\nSecond: run those on terminal:\nsudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source broadcom-sta-common broadcom-sta-source\nsudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter firmware-b43-installer\n\nIf it does not work still, reset your router to factory settings. Running the code brought my broadcomm back to live. Before the factory reset, the router worked fine with wired and wireless connections BUT both the netbook and an iPad, connected fine but refused to browse.\n\nA: Does the DHCP set 192.168.88.1 as the gateway?\nIs the IP address that it gives you in the same range for example 192.168.88.something?\nCan you ping the IP assigned by the DHCP?\nHave you tried adding your network settings manually?\n", "Q: pulseaudio and alsa on ubuntu 12.04 server I am running ubuntu 12.04server, and trying to get pulseaudio working.

Therefore, I would say that would be the one to try. It is over 3 years old but I don't believe that Openbox has seen any major developments that would break it. Additionally, I have seen articles and forum posts from this year that indicate that it is still being used on current distros. \n", "Q: Is it possible to use the Volume Notifications from Gnome Shell in XFCE? I somehow had them working before in 11.10 but I don't really remember what did I do back then other than activating \"load Gnome components on start up\" in the XFCE's settings manager.\nI've tried the same in 12.04 but doesn't seem to do anything, I specifically ask for the Volume notifications as other notifications used notify-osd or xfce4-notifyd but the volume one was Gnome's (I found that later) As far as I know it uses notification-daemonbut installing it instead of the other two doesn't give me the correct notifications.\nI'm using XFCE 4.10\nThis is what I get from running gnome-settings-daemon in the Terminal.\n(gnome-settings-daemon:3841): Gtk-WARNING **: Theme parsing error: gtk-widgets.css:1137:14: Not using units is deprecated.

The notification-daemon is a program used to display the pop-up notification. You can use \"notification-daemon\" is a generic name for any daemon providing notification. For XFCE it is xfce4-notifyd.\nGnome-Shell uses gnome-shell-hotplug-sniffer program which resides in /usr/lib/gnome-shell/ to give the Volume notification. As this is a very internal component of gnome-shell (it runs automatically with gnome-shell) you cannot use it without installing gnome-shell or using it.\nTo see that this indeed is responsible for Volume notification, temporarily disable it by renaming it to gnome-shell-hotplug-sniffer.bak file\nsudo mv /usr/lib/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-hotplug-sniffer /usr/lib/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-hotplug-sniffer.back\n\nThen restart gnome-shell with the command gnome-shell --replace from Alt+F2 graphical command box. Try mounting a drive and you'll see there is no notification for mounted drive.\nTo restore back the file, use this command to rename it to original name\nsudo mv /usr/lib/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-hotplug-sniffer.bak /usr/lib/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-hotplug-sniffer\n\n\nA: Run gnome-settings-daemon in the background. It handles special keys, keyboard layouts, and the like. \nEDIT:\nShould've tested that before posting.\nYou can get gnome-settings-daemon running with:\n$ killall xfsettingsd && gnome-settings-daemon\n\nNote that this will set your GTK theme to the default old-school GNOME2 look. But you will have your GNOME-style volume pop-ups.\n", "Q: screen/text corruption Ubuntu always starts fine for me but after a while the text will start to corrupt to the point I cannot read it in the applications I am running and the purple background is pixelated into big squares.

I am running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and I've been following whoopsie with the top program and noticed something strange.\nIn the afternoon the daemon process was only using up to 2% of CPU power.\nBut during the evening this slowly increased to sometimes taking up to 40% of CPU power.\nI am running a 10 year old machine, but even VLC which is normally running OK was having problems running smoothly due to this increase in usage.\nSince i am running an old machine, should I just switch whoopsie off (as descrribed in What is the 'whoopsie' process and how can I remove it?) or is there a way to let whoopsie behave less CPU hungry? \n\nA: I've got an idea as to how you could fix your problem: as a temporary measure you could cap the CPU usage of 'whoopsie' by using a program called CPU Limit.\nYou can download it below:\n\nThis should ensure at least while watching movies that your film remains lag-free and once you've capped it, it shouldn't bother you until you next shutdown.I've found a well explained tutorial here if you need more information on how to install it and use it. \nHowever as this isn't a permanent cap you'd need to get your Ubuntu to run it at startup each time if you want it to be capped on a more permanent basis. I'm not an expert on what commands you'd need to run but I think it should be possible to get it to run and limit the process at startup (see this post if you don't know how to set apps/processes to run at startup). \nI'd suggest you try out CPU Limit and then if you're satisfied as to how well it copes with your problem and would like it to run at start-up you can use the instructions posted here by hhlp and by adding the following line:\ncpulimit -e whoopsie -l 3 &\n\nTo the /etc/rc.local file it will run properly on every startup with Whoopsie capped at 3% cpu usage.\nIdeally if it's a bug as commented it might be solved sometime soon, but until then this is the way I'd go about to stop the problem being an issue.\n", "Q: How do I switch channel in Me TV?

It has been working great, except that the backtick/tilde button sticks(not physically). \nWhen I hit the backtick button it keeps repeating until another input button is pressed.  So if I press the spacebar while the backtick is repeating, it stops, but if I press the shift while it is repeating, the backtick turns into a tilde, and the tilde keeps repeating until I release the shift key (at which point it's a backtick again and keeps repeating).\nThis sticking behavior only happens with the backtick key, and only in my Ubuntu virtualization, never in windows.\nI've tried both my laptop's keyboard and an external USB keyboard and the problem happens on both.  Both keyboards I've tried are Japanese 106/109 key layout, but I'm using them with a English(US) 101 profile.  When I refer to the backtick key above, I mean where it is on the US layout.  \nIf I use the Japanese profile, the key in that location (the US backtick location) still sticks, but its no longer mapped as the backtick key.\nAny thoughts as to what might be causing this and possible solutions?\nI've searched a lot, but have not found any help so far.  Any help is greatly appreciated.\nAdditional Info:\nI booted Linux from a USB key, and found it did not have this stuck key problem.  So it appears to be something with Virtual Box.\n\nA: I know about this problem. I have a Windows laptop bought in Japan and have run into the sticking tilde key issue.\nAs you know, the tilde key is used in Japanese windows for Japanese-oriented IME switching, and Japanese keyboards contain markings on the key to that effect. \nI have drilled into the issue somewhat, but lost motivation. A summary of my meagre findings is basically this:\n\n\n*\n\n*VirtualBox, in the virtual machine window, does not capture ordinary Windows WM_KEY events. Rather, it registers a low level keyboard hook. Look for occurences of LowLevelKeyboardProc in this VirtualBox source file.\n\n*I suspect that in Japanese Windows, due to its special role, the tilde key does not generate an up event when the key is released. Since VirtualBox needs to make a faithful simulation of scan codes to the virtualized system, it looks like tilde is being held down.\n\n*Though I've been able to monitor events flowing into VirtualBox windows using Spy++, the low level ones cannot be seen. The VirtualBox configuration UI has normal key events flowing into it, but the machine windows, absolutely nothing. Even the UI hot keys for VirtualBox itself (not destined for the machine) are all handled through that low level hook, it seems.\nSo testing this hypothesis would require writing a sample program which intercepts the keyboard events in the same way and shows that there is no matching \"up\" for a \"down\" for the tilde key.  Though I have Visual Studio kicking around, and it's not complicated, it's just too much effort for this silly problem.\nAnyway, in spite of the incomplete investigation, I place a low probability on the notion that this is an Ubuntu issue.\n", "Q: What do the terminologies related to AMD graphics and Ubuntu mean? I have an AMD Radeon HD 4850 graphics card, with the latest AMD Catalyst drivers installed.I would like to better understand how things work. What do the terminologies related to AMD graphics cards and Ubuntu mean?\nWhat do x.org, FGLRX and RandR mean?\nRelated to the Catalyst driver, why in the info section of the control centre it says Catalyst version is 12.6, but Catalyst control centre is 2.14? What is the difference between Catalyst and Catalyst control centre? Also, why is the Driver packaging version 8.98 while the Driver package says 12.6? As well as in the installer, what is the difference between choosing \"Install Driver 8.98 on X.Org 6.9 or later\" and \"Generate Distribution Specific Driver Package\"?\nI would like to understand what these things mean. Hopefully others can learn from this and better understand their graphics cards and Ubuntu.\n\nA: As stated before, be more precise with your questions, it helps us all :) From what I understand, you aren't having any problems, right? You are just curious to better understand how things work and what certain things are in relation to AMD graphics cards and drivers. You could easily find a great amount of documentation online, but I will try to answer your questions. \nA number in a box like this ex: {1} means to go look at that point.\n\n\n*\n\n*\nWhat is x.org?\n\nXorg is basically the X window system used in linux. What is the X Window System? It's the base of the graphical environment for your computer. In simple terms, it's what draws your Windows, menus and icons, and controls their placement.\n\n*\nWhat is FGLRX?\n\nFGLRX is the name of the AMD Catalyst driver used on Linux. It is special because it contains parts that are open source and parts that are proprietary (made by the community and made by AMD). So FGLRX stands for \"FireGL and Radeon for X\". As you  can see, it is designed for X Window System {1}. As we learned above, X Window system (or for short X.Org) draws the Windows and menus and all. FGLRX is the driver that allows your graphics card to communicate with X.org, giving it better and faster performance. A driver is a piece of software that allows you're OS (Ubuntu or Windows) to communicate with it's hardware (printers, graphics cards, webcams, etc.) \n\n*\nWhat is RandR? \n\nThe X Resize, Rotate and Reflect Extension (RandR) is a X.org {1} extension, which serves to dynamically change X screens, so as to resize and rotate windows on screen. In simple terms, allows for smooth resizing and moving windows.\n\n*\nWhat is the difference between Catalyst and Catalyst control centre?\n\nCatalyst is the name of the graphics card driver {2}, FGLRX is also called as AMD Catalyst Linux. On Windows OS, it is simply called AMD Catalyst. It is the name of the AMD graphics driver. Catalyst Control Centre is the name of the application used to change the settings of your AMD graphics card and driver. It's where you change the settings for the Catalyst graphics driver.\n\n*\nWhy is the Driver packaging version 8.98 while the Driver package says 12.6? \n\nI am not exactly sure what you mean by this. The current Catalyst driver version is 12.6. The 8.98 could be the version of the program you are using to install it.\n\n*\nWhat is the difference between choosing \"Install Driver 8.98 on X.Org 6.9 or later\" and \"Generate Distribution Specific Driver Package\"?\n\nI believe that \"Install Driver 8.98 on X.Org 6.9 or later\", means to install the driver that is included in the installer on to the version of X.org{1} you have installed. The second option, \"Generate Distribution Specific Driver Package\", means that the installer will try to install the driver including in Ubuntu's packages instead. \nI hope my long explanation has helped you better understand the basics of how the graphics system works in Ubuntu in relation to AMD graphics cards. It is basically the same with other graphics cards, with different names but the same terms. All this information was readily available in the Ubuntu forums and on Amd's website.Add stars and up vote my answer, thank you :)\n", "Q: \"Vidalia detected that the Tor software exited unexpectedly.\" I can start and kill tor via command line, but I want to control it with Vidalia.

See this article to read this interesting topic. The important point is\n\nWhat is an open file?\nAn open file is a file that is being used, or is it an open file descriptor? A file descriptor is a data structure used by a program to get a handle on a file, the most well known being 0,1,2 for standard in, standard out, and standard error. The file-max kernel parameter refers to open file descriptors, and file-nr gives us the current number of open file descriptors. But lsof lists all open files, including files which are not using file descriptors - such as current working directories, memory mapped library files, and executable text files. To illustrate, let's examine the difference between the output of lsof for a given pid and the file descriptors listed for that pid in /proc. \n\nAlso take a look at these links\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I change the number of open files limit in Linux?\n\n*How many open files\n\n*Ports and File descriptors\n", "Q: Libreoffice calc appears in launcher as a white icon When i try to open a .xls file sometimes appear a white icon on launcher instead of the green open office calc icon.\nBesides, when this problem happens, it doesnt allow me to open more than one file at a time and of course, the arrows next to the icon doesn't appear as well,\nWhat is happening? is there a way to solve this?\n\nA: It's a bug.

Is there any way i can do it without backing up the data that is there in my drive. I have been using 10.10 for a long time. And i like the new 12.04 LTS and have used it for a while on my friends laptop. Thank you.\n\nA: You can upgrade without updating it will not delete your data but maybe some of the your softwares that are not supported by 12.04 will be deleted. But, I advice you to backup and never think to upgrade without backup.\n\nA: I have been updating/re-installing Ubuntu without a backup for several releases now.\nMy method is to use 2 partitions and keep all the personal data on that 2nd disc away from your system. I have / and /home on 1 disc but my /home does not hold any personal data. So I can either format / and/or /home without loosing anything. All I do at the end of the re-install is remove all directories in home and point them to my 2nd harddisc (where the actual files are). And a F5 on the desktop gives me back my icons on the desktop.\nSo yes, it can be done but if you did not set this up yet then you probably are best of burning your stuff to a cd, dvd or to store it online. A backup is always adviced\n", "Q: How to get the hostname using  terminal command-line?

The canonical way would be to first install the new glibc, then desktop-file-utils, and then, at the very end, do make check.\nIn general, an error during check is a reason to worry, at least in a professional setting. Failure of a test may mean that some particular condition can bring the system to its knees, even if the system runs fine 99.99% of the time.\nIn this particular case, you can directly look into the source code of glib to understand what is happening. Here is the relevant function:\n/* test that thread creation fails as expected,\n * by setting RLIMIT_NPROC ridiculously low\n */\nstatic void\ntest_thread4 (void)\n{\n#ifdef HAVE_PRLIMIT\n  struct rlimit ol, nl;\n  GThread *thread;\n  GError *error;\n  gint ret;\n\n  getrlimit (RLIMIT_NPROC, &nl);\n  nl.rlim_cur = 1;\n\n  if ((ret = prlimit (getpid(), RLIMIT_NPROC, &nl, &ol)) != 0)\n    g_error (\"prlimit failed: %s\\n\", g_strerror (ret));\n\n  error = NULL;\n  thread = g_thread_try_new (\"a\", thread1_func, NULL, &error);\n  g_assert (thread == NULL);\n  g_assert_error (error, G_THREAD_ERROR, G_THREAD_ERROR_AGAIN);\n  g_error_free (error);\n\n  if ((ret = prlimit (getpid (), RLIMIT_NPROC, &ol, NULL)) != 0)\n    g_error (\"resetting RLIMIT_NPROC failed: %s\\n\", g_strerror (ret));\n#endif\n}\n\nThe error occurs ad the line \ng_assert( thread == NULL ) ;\n\nThe test function changes the RLIMIT_PROC to a value of 1 (nl.rlim_cur=1, which limits the number of threads the current process can have). With that setting, creation of a new thread (g_thread_try_new() call) should fail and return NULL. For some reason, this does not happen.\nEither there is a bug in the test suite, or a problem with glibc, or there was a problem correctly building glibc. In any case, incorrect return values from thread management library calls would make me very nervous.\n", "Q: How can I upgrade my server's kernel without rebooting? This is a loaded question because I'm already aware of, and am very interested in ksplice. The problem is that since they were bought by Oracle, they have been forced to pull numerous server distributions from the offerings. The answer isn't as simple as it once was.\nI noticed a question on Unix.SE that states:\n\nYou can build your own ksplice patches to dynamically load into your own kernel\n\nGreat! But how?!\nI've installed the free ksplice package in the repo on my desktop (not ksplice-uptrack which is non-free) and now want to generate and apply updates. What's the process? Are there any scripts out there to automate the process?\nMoreover, if all the machinery required for rebootless upgrades is sitting there in the kernel (and ksplice package), why on earth aren't we taking advantage of it by default?\n\nQuite recently kGraft was announced. It seems to be roughly the same result so if you have an answer that involves it, I'd be just as happy with that. It's currently a few months from being released though.\n\nNote 1: I am happy for a solution beside ksplice but it has to deliver the same thing: rolling updates to the kernel that can be applied without rebooting the server.\nNote 2: I'll say it again; the main ksplice \"service\" does not support Ubuntu Server. It used to but it doesn't any more. When I talk about wanting to use ksplice, I'm talking about the open source tools in the ksplice package. Any answer that talks about ksplice-uptrack is probably not what I'm after as this is the part that integrates directly with aforementioned \"service\".\n\nA: I don't know much about ksplice but thought I'd mention it - have you heard about kexec? This might be what you need.\nRegarding the question why haven't we adopted this as a default mechanism? Well, overwriting the memory of the current kernel while it's still running can cause potential issues. It also expects hardware devices to be in a well-defined state which isn't always possible.\nYou can take a look at the IBM developer works article about it to decide if it suits your needs.\n\nA: All the other answers here are great, but for Ubuntu specifically, Canonical now delivers this service on 16.04.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2016/10/canonical-livepatch.html\n\n*https://www.ubuntu.com/server/livepatch\nThis uses the live patching technology in the upstream Linux kernel since 4.0 was released.\n\nA: ksplice will allow kernel swap without needing reboot.  Uptrack works within ksplice and has a editable config file in /etc/uptrack/uptrack.conf\n\nA: There are a couple fully open-source alternatives to Ksplice that have both been submitted for inclusion in the mainline Linux kernel. It's too early to tell which will end up in the kernel, but you can still try them out if you're brave enough:\n\n\n*\n\n*kGraft, which you mentioned already. One of Ubuntu's kernel engineers has a blog post where he tried it out: using kgraft with ubuntu\n\n*kpatch, currently in development by Red Hat. Its github site has some instructions for trying it out on Ubuntu: https://github.com/dynup/kpatch#ubuntu-1404\nYou can read more about both of them here: SUSE Posts kGraft, Red Hat Posts Kpatch Patches\n\nA: The Arch Linux wiki had instructions: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ksplice\nThe only part that seems to be distro specific is how to install ksplice itself. Since you've already figured that out it seems, I think this should get you on your way.\n\nA: Since 16 July 2015 \"Oracle Ksplice is offered for free on Fedora and Ubuntu Desktop Editions.\", officially.\nJust install downloaded .deb file you can get here.\nIf you try sudo dpkg -i ksplice-uptrack.deb you might then have to fix dependencies with sudo apt-get install -f.\n", "Q: How to use the Adobe Source Code Pro font?

Therefore whenever I open or activate any other program I need to minimize that window in order to get to the calc window again.\nThe error might seam un-important, but I work a lot with csv files and the command line.

Just some (working) time by time workarounds.\nThe one that did work for me is to 'xkill' the launcher. Afterwards I have the calc icon.

I've installed PyDev in Eclipse and have configured my project so that the project lies under Workspace/Eclipse and the Quickly files lies under Workspace/Quickly. To connect the two I've linked the Quickly project by creating a new folder in Eclipse under the project and select the \"advanced option\" in the dialog to link a folder into the project. That way I don't need to have the Eclipse project files in my Quickly project.\nBut there is two issues that arises for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Eclipse I have to select a Python interpreter and I have no idea what to do. I've googled around for an answer but I can't find if Quickly uses Python 3 or 2.7. Can someone help me make an informed choice? (I'm new to developing Python, that's why I can't tell the difference by the syntax - if there even is a difference)\n\n*I can't press the \"Run\" button to launch the application. Must I initialize a program with quickly run? I want to be able to debug through Eclipse, how do I configure this?\n\n\nI'm using Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS and the Eclipse version from the repositories.\n\nA: So I to got interested in this after seeing your question, after a bit of goggling with out any interesting results I decided to try my self and see if i could figure something out. This is more of a workaround then an actual solution.\nI started by creating a test project using quickly:\nquickly create ubuntu-application foo\n\nThen i launched eclipse and created a new python project and imported the quickly project folder. Right-cklick on project->import\n\nThen I added the quickly-project path to the eclipse project: Right-click on project->properties\ngo to PyDev - PYTHONPATH-> add source folder, and select the root map of quickly project\n(This is not necessary but it removes those annoying read markings that complains about not finding imports)\n\nSo now the only thing left is to be able to launch the project from eclipse. To do that click on the run-menu at the top of eclipse->External tools->External tools configuration\nRight-click Program and select \"New\" Name it something like Run\n\n\n*\n\n*For location enter the path to quickly executeble (/usr/bin/quickly)\n\n*For working directory click on \"browse workspace\" and select the root foolder of the quickly project\n\n*For arguments typ run\n\n*Go to the tab common and under \"Display in favorite menu\" select External Tools\n\n\nCreate a new one and name it something like design, the only thing to change in this one would be to type \"design\" instead of \"run\" under argument.\nNow you can Run or launch glade to change design from the dropdown menu I'm trying to show on the last picture.\n\nFor the python question I would suggest that use Python3 because Ubuntu is aiming to only include python3 in Ubuntu 12.10 and forward. (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Python/3)\nAs for setting up python in eclipse: when you create a new pydev project, you should see an option to select python grammar version and interpreter. If you cant find the right python version under interpreter click on \"Click here to configure an interpeter not listed\"\nIn the new window click new and give it a name, then click on browse to /usr/bin and select the python version you like to add for example python3.2mu, then click apply and ok. now you should be able to select that version from the create new project window\n\nHope this helps you\n", "Q: Connecting a reliance zte AC2737 netconnect + modem I have a Reliance netconnect+ zte Ac2737. It has an allocated data of 5gb per month. The modem works fine only after the allocated data is over, for which i have to pay extra to the provider. I tried contacting the provider, but it was not of much help. The system detects the modem every time. I assume that it must be a possible problem with the provider, so is there any chance it is the problem of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64 bit itself as i have no other reason to think otherwise an it works fine every time on windows.\n\nA: Ubuntu has no knowledge of how much data balance you have left, so the problem is indeed with your provider.\n\nA: \nCheck these settings with your service provider like Reliance Card is CDMA or GSM.\nIf CDMA Card, number is different.

Select prefered option and procede.\n\n*I'm in.\n\n\nIf anyone following this thread comes up with a way for the Windows UEFI boot loader to recognize the /boot partition automatically, please share. The above method is not that much of a pain, but an automatic boot whence windows recognizes Ubuntu as a boot option would be a somewhat more elegant affair. Also, I would prefer to have Windows handle the primary boot sequence, and not grub, as a personal preference, so I can live with the above until other options are available.\n\nA: First suggestion ensure that you boot from the device in UEFI mode. With my system when I choose the boot device in BIOS for example via my SSD. The BIOS lists both the drive as port 0 or whatever it is, and then it also list it as Ubuntu. So I have to make sure I select Ubuntu as the boot device.\nAlso make sure that you have enable UEFI in BIOS. If I do a BIOS reset mine automatically defaults to legacy mode.\n\nA: Your problem is not related to UEFI, but to graphic drivers or kernel options.

I ran across an older toshiba laptop with a pentium 4 2.66 ghz cpu and 464 mg of ram.\nI thought i would try out Ubuntu 12.04 on it instead of running live on another computer to test it. So anyway I love the GUI but this computer just isn't fast enough to handle it for my taste at least. So I thought i would try the newer Lubuntu distro since it's a little lighter weight and I can't get the computer to boot from the install disk I burned. \nI followed all the instructions, I burned the image to the disk correctly even tried burning another copy to see if it was that. But it just goes straight to the menu where you select what version of Ubuntu you want to boot. I can get to a grub prompt from there but I don't know the command if there is one I can use to tell it to boot from disk? \nI tried going into BIOS to make sure disk drive it still first priority and the computer just freezes and sits there forever doing nothing. I also thought that it might have been a bad download so I tried a version of fedora on it that I know works and it still won't boot from CD. What should I do now?\n\nA: The settings from BIOS sould not interact with your HDD content. In English it means that if you set the CD as 1st boot device, it should boot from there. In some cases if the CD drive is not functioning properly (dirty lens, scratched disk, etc), then the computer will try to boot from the second device, in your case the HDD.\nThe GRUB doesn't have an option for booting from CD, by the way.  \nWhat I would do is to disable the 2nd boot device in BIOS, leaving just the CD, perhaps after a few attempts will manage to boot.\n\nA: First, check that your CD is not scratched \nSecond try booting just from CD so remove Hdd from booting menu\nThird,You can try with external CD/DVD ROM since it maybe a hardware problem\n", "Q: How to set and limit my resolution to 640x480 How can I set and limit the resolution in Ubuntu 12 to 640x480\nThere's not much in the xorg.conf file anymore, so I'm guessing this is no longer the place to do it? \nI can't do it using the GUI either because it doesn't show me the 640x480 option.\nWhile setting the resolution the computer is connected to a normal screen\nbut later it will be connected to a screen that only supports 640x480 and doesn't report its supported modes to the computer.\nThe only thing in my xorg.conf (by default) is this:\nSection \"Device\"\n        Identifier      \"Default Device\"\n        Option  \"NoLogo\"        \"True\"\nEndSection\n\nUpdate, in response to Kamil's answer:\nI do not have the gdm folder, but I get the idea\nHowever if I execute those commands I get the following\nxrandr --newmode \"640x480_60.00\"   23.75  640 664 720 800  480 483 487 500 -hsync +vsync\nxrandr: Failed to get size of gamma for output default\nX Error of failed request:  BadName (named color or font does not exist)\nMajor opcode of failed request:  153 (RANDR)\nMinor opcode of failed request:  16 (RRCreateMode)\nSerial number of failed request:  19\nCurrent serial number in output stream:  19\nroot@timothy-desktop:~# xrandr --addmode default 640x480_60.00\nxrandr: Failed to get size of gamma for output default\nroot@timothy-desktop:~# xrandr --output default --mode 640x480\nxrandr: Failed to get size of gamma for output default\n\nNote that VGA1 is default in my case.\n\nA: To set your resolution to 640x480.

W7 entry doesn't appear in GRUB After trying to install both OS during 2 days, I'm confused and getting mad...\nI have SSD 128 GB and HDD 500 GB both empty. My laptop is Asus K55VM. BIOS support UEFI.\nWhat I have done:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install new SSD (Samsung 830 128GB)\n\n*Use GParted on liveCD to create new table of partitions (GPT) and create 3 partitions (in the SSD) for different purposes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Partition 1: 80 GB (w7); \n\n*Partition 2: 30 GB (Ubuntu 12.04 -Just / -); \n\n*Partition 3: 10 GB unused (for future extesion of the other partitions)\n\n\n*Install Windows 7 (with UEFI) in Partition 1.

I have W7. Now I install Ubuntu 12.04 amd64 (with UEFI) as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install / in Partition 2 -> /dev/sda4 30 GB ext4, and in the hdd I install /home and swap.\n\n*I select bootloader in /dev/sda1 (where it's supposed to be the UEFI boot).\n\n*I install updates and reboot.\nProblem: Now just appears grub menu with Ubuntu entries and not Windows 7.\nAlternative solution found: When I turn on laptop, before loading GRUB I press ESC key and appear BIOS boot, so I can select to boot the Windows partition, Ubuntu partition, DVD, USB, etc... but I think is not the best way to boot different OS.\nI've tried: sudo update-grub2 with no success.\nWhat can I do??\n\nA: Find where the windows bootloader resides by mounting the efi partition:\nsudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdx1 /mnt/efi/\n\nAnd search for bootmgfw.efi.

I know of three EFI boot managers you can install:\n\n\n*\n\n*rEFIt, which is available in Ubuntu's repositories. Note that the version from rEFIt's site won't work on UEFI-based PCs, since it uses a Mac-specific file format. Even Ubuntu's version has a number of minor glitches on UEFI-based PCs. Ideally, rEFIt presents a pretty GUI boot menu (although it's also got a text mode).\n\n*rEFInd, which is an updated version of rEFIt with fixes for the various UEFI glitches and extensions to work with a 3.3.0 kernel's built-in EFI boot loader. Note that I forked/maintain rEFInd.\n\n*gummiboot, which is a text-only boot manager. (This site keeps forgetting who I am and refuses to let me post more than two hyperlinks as a result, or I would have provided one.)\n\n\nBoth rEFIt and rEFInd auto-detect other boot loaders, so once you've configured them, they should detect any OS's boot loader and give you a menu. I've not yet tried gummiboot, so I don't know how simple it is to set up, but it's similar conceptually to rEFIt/rEFInd. Using any of these programs adds complexity to the boot process, so if GRUB works and you're happy with it, there's little point to using any of these programs. They're most useful if GRUB is temperamental or just plain doesn't work, as is often the case with GRUB 2 on UEFI systems, in my experience. In such a situation, you can ditch GRUB 2 in favor of ELILO or a 3.3.0 or later kernel's EFI stub loader. These boot loaders can't redirect the boot process to Windows, making a separate boot manager very useful. With a distribution that uses a 3.3.0 or later kernel, rEFInd can be very easy to maintain, depending on the configuration details.\n\nA: PAY ATTENTION: for x64 only\ngrub-probe --target=fs_uuid /boot/efi/efi/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n\nAdd this to /etc/grub.d/40_custom:\nmenuentry \"Boot bootx64.efi, generated by Boot-Repair\" {\nsearch --fs-uuid --no-floppy --set=root UUID\n\n**chainloader (${root})/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi**\n}\n\nThe other code doesn't work.\nTested on ASUS N56V\n", "Q: I have just one working Wifi connection After configuring my Computer for PXE installation (as a Server).

If I understand correctly, duplicity is the command line tool for creating backups and can be used stand-alone (i.e. no DejaDup involved) for creating backups.\nIs it possible to set up multiple backup plans with different schedules and sources/targets?\nIn particular I would like to:\n\n\n*\n\n*regularly back up my complete home folder as I do now with deja-dup, i.e. whenever I connect my external drive and the backup is due.\n\n*back up different sets of folders to a remote server (Strato HiDrive, so ftp, smb or rsync) on a manual basis (ideally just a \"trigger\" command I issue) since I need to be in a place with fast internet connection to do this (I am speaking about ~200 GB here)\n\n\nI think this would just need some time setting up the different commands for the remote backup. The local backup could stay in DejaDup.\nBut will duplicity be able to handle this? Or will it get confused with the different backups?\nAlso: what will the performance for the remote backups be like?\nHow will the actual diff+copy mechanism work in the remote case?\nWhy I ask this is just that with DejaDup I only get one backup plan, Back in Time only supports local copies (so I would have to mount the ftp locally and diff there which seems a waste of bandwidth) and rsnapshot uses hardlinks and is thus required to run on the target). but duplicity seems to be able to do what I want...\n\nA: In general, the answer is yes. Duplicity is highly flexible and you can back up different portions of your system differently. It's all about mastering the duplicity command line, however.\n\nA: \nIs it possible to set up multiple backup plans with different schedules and sources/targets?\n\nYes. In Duplicity you would run one command for each schedule. Duplicity doesn't have a built in scheduler, instead you use Cron. In it's simplest form a Duplicity backup scheduled by Cron would look like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a bash script that contains the Duplicity command:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Filename: myBackup.sh\nduplicity --full-if-older-than 1M \\\n   --exclude-filelist excludeList.txt \\\n     / sftp://uid@other.host/some_dir\n\nThis script will make a full backup once every month. Otherwise it will make an incremental backup. It will make a backup of the root dir (/), but will exlude/ \ninclude according to the list below. It will save the backup at the sftp server (be sure to install ssh keys to make this work when the script is run by cron. If you run the script manually you have the choice to go without keys if you're prepared to enter your password each time you run it.\n\n*Make an exclude list (exludeList.txt):\n**[Cc]ache*\n**[Hh]istory*\n**[Ss]ocket*\n**[Tt]humb*\n**[Tt]rash*\n**.kvm\n**.local/share/icons\n**.rpmdb\n**.thumbnails\n**_NOBACKUP*\n/home/user/VirtualBox VMs/**\n/home/user/Downloads/**\n+ /home/user\n+ /var/www\n+ /root\n+ /etc\n**\n\nIn our Duplicity command we state that the source is /, and if you don't have an exclude file that means everything below the root dir is included in the backup.\nThe double asterisk ** substitutes for every file name or path. First we list the files we want to exclude. These will be excluded even if they are contained in any of the dirs that we tell Duplicity to include. Then we tell which dirs to include (lines starting with +). In the end we tell Duplicity to exclude everything that we didn't mentions before, that is **.\n\n*Schedule this with Cron by creating the following file in your /etc/cron.daily to run it once every day:\n#!/bin/bash\nmyBackup.sh\n\n\nregularly back up my complete home folder as I do now with deja-dup, i.e. whenever I connect my external drive and the backup is due.\n\nTweak the backup command to your liking. To perform the backup when the external drive is connected you could for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put a script in /etc/cron.hourly that checks the status of the backup (for example reads the date from a log file you create when you run your backup), if the backup has not been done today the script checks if the drive is mounted. If the drive is mounted backup is performed.\n\n*Write a service that runs when you plug your backup drive.\n\nback up different sets of folders to a remote server (Strato HiDrive, so ftp, smb or rsync) on a manual basis (ideally just a \"trigger\" command I issue) since I need to be in a place with fast internet connection to do this (I am speaking about ~200 GB here)\n\nThis one is easy: Just create a script that runs Duplicity and uses an exclude file as described above.\nGood luck! Duplicity is a very versatile and stable software. If you're not used to writing bash scripts, it can be a bit challenging to use but I would definitely say it's worth a try for your needs.\nLet me know if there's any info you need that's missing in this answer.\n", "Q: How to run Shell script from HTML? I'm somewhat new to Ubuntu Linux. \nI need to run the shell script from a html code.

It's running may be as a daemon.\nSo can any body help me how to make it visible?\n\nA: This is a totally wrong approach. The HTML file does nothing, it is a Markup language, that instructs a browser how to show you different elements. What you need it is a PHP, ASP, CGI, etc script that uses the system's shell to run arbitrary commands.\n\nA: When you run a shell script as CGI, which is what I believe you are doing (or trying to do), it is run from the apache or other web server daemon and its output isn't visible anywhere. You can redirect its output to a file, for example by replacing the original script with one that runs the script and saves the output:\n#!/bin/bash\n./original.sh | tee --append file-to-save-to\n\n(You should probably also update your question to show what your objective is, in addition to the problem you have encountered.)\n\nA: You can use perl-cgi do this. Take a look at \n\n\n*\n\n*Net::SSH \n\n*Net::Telnet\n\n*Net::SSH::Perl\nperl Packages. These modules will help you to make client connections.\nSample script using Net::telnet\nuse Net::Telnet ();\n$t = new Net::Telnet (Timeout => 10,\n                      Prompt => '/bash\\$ $/');\n$t->open(\"sparky\");\n$t->login($username, $passwd);\n@lines = $t->cmd(\"who\");\nprint @lines;\n\nYou can render the output of this program using cgi and display it in browser.\nBut the limitation of this would be like you cannot use a interactive shell to run your command.\n", "Q: GUI Tool to deny Standard users from Using CD-ROM and USBs?

Considerations?\n\nA: Setting up InfiniBand on 12.04 should be smooth (except for one minor thing, see below).  Most of the horror stories you read are about people that download OFED packages and mess up their systems running some random installer script that stomps all over their system and installs new kernel packages.  Don't do that -- just use what's already packaged in Ubuntu!\nFor IB hardware, really the only choice is Mellanox.  You might as well get the latest ConnectX-3 hardware if you are buying new; otherwise you can get some very cheap hardware on Ebay.\nBecause of older package versions in 12.04 (launchpad bug: ConnectX-3 not supported until 12.10) you'll want to use my PPA to get up-to-date libibverbs/libmlx4 packages if you are using ConnectX-3 adapters (the latest).

Other user-friendly options are PiTiVI and Kdenlive.  As far as I've used them, you can easily join clips, insert text and images and export videos to different formats.  There is a list of open-source editing software on Wikipedia.\nWithin a few months Lightworks, a very professional editor, should be available for Ubuntu.\nedit: Lightworks is now available for Ubuntu\n\nA: I would recommend OpenShot.

Check how long\n  you get DHCP leases for (this should appear in the system logs, I\n  think in /var/log/syslog).\nYou can use auditd  to find out what modifies the file. Start the\n  daemon (sudo service auditd start) and tell it to watch for\n  modifications to that file:\nsudo auditctl -w /etc/resolv.conf -p w\nAudit logs are in\n  /var/log/audit/audit.log.

Try bringing all network interfaces down, then\n  stop Network Manager (sudo service network-manager stop), then restart\n  it.\n\n\nA: I fix it by removing resolvconf.\n\nA: From the fact that you have no iface definitions in /etc/network/interfaces I infer that you are using NetworkManager to configure your interfaces.\nPossibly the original problem was misconfigured connections in NetworkManager, e.g., having selected \"Automatic (DHCP) addresses only\" instead of \"Automatic (DHCP)\" as the \"Method\".\nAlso consider the possibility that your symbolic link /etc/resolv.conf -> ../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf was missing for one reason or another. See bug #1000244. The fix for that would have been to run \"dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf\".\nRemoving resolvconf was not the best solution. By doing that you are relying upon legacy support in the DHCP client for directly futzing with /etc/resolv.conf. That may work for now, but resolvconf was introduced precisely in order to bring order to that kind of intervention.\n", "Q: having trouble instaling ubuntu using a usb boot on pc I want to instal ubuntu on my pc using a usb.\nI changed the bios option so now the boot is from the usb, but when I restart the computer it shows a black page with only this sighn \"_\" flashing in the top left corner, and nothing hapens when I press any key.\nwhat should I do to make it work?\n\nA: Format the USB disk and create a boot disk using unetbootin or any other software..

I know that just about any PDF editor will allow me to type text onto a form, but I'm looking for something that specifically will help me with the following two issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Aligning multiple form fields vertically (left edge, e.g.)\n\n*Helping me get all of the text to be the same distance from the \"line\" at the bottom of the form field.\n\n\n(also, if you know of webapps that would help with this, I will accept those answers as well.)\n\nA: I advise you to check all available PDF creators/editors for Linux:\nCreators\n\n\n*\n\n*OpenOffice.org: an open source office suite with built-in PDF creation.\n\n*LibreOffice.org: an open source office suite with built-in PDF creation.\n\n*Xournal: an open source program that creates PDFs.\n\n*Inkscape vector drawing program that imports and exports PDF files.\n\n*Scribus: an Open Source program for professional page layout.\n\n\nEditors\n\n\n*\n\n*PDFedit: an open source program for viewing or editing the internal structures of PDF documents\n\n*PDF Studio: proprietary software for viewing and editing PDF documents\n\n*Pdftk: can merge, split, en-/decrypt, watermark/stamp and manipulate PDF files\n\n\nand choose the one that fits into your problem\n\nA: *\n\n*install acroread. please follow this link. http://www.techheadz.co.uk/222.html\n\n*open the file using acroread and if there is any form, you'll automatically get a typewriter option\n\n\nP.S. Please excuse me for not posting an opensource solution, but this was really helpful.\n\nA: From your question I understand that you need to do it frequently or multiple times. I see the following solutions:\n(EDIT) Another solution: use Xournal. Xournal allows you to annotate a PDF and creates a gzipped XML file with these annotations. You can edit or process that file at will, and then use Xournal to create a composite PDF that contains both the original file and the annotations. This is probably the easiest solution.\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the PDF document in a PDF editor of your choice and insert the form fields yourself (they can be transparent, so that you will not change the looks of the form).\n\n*Write a program that modifies the PDF -- this would be suitable for filling out a large number of forms. Many programming languages have libraries that can directly manipulate PDF files. This requires knowledge of PDF and programming, however. \n\n*Another solution for generating the forms in a batch-like manner, one that seems complex, but might actually be quite simple. Use the pdftops program to convert pdf to postscript. A postscript file is simple text, and postscript is easy to learn. In other words, you can manipulate PS files with any script that can just insert a few commands at the end of the file.\n", "Q: Failure to Boot 12.04 on HP AMD Dual Core.

A minor number of times I get the HP logo with hash lines on screen and it just hangs... When it finally boots 95% it will run until I turn it off days later to see if any of the upgrades fixed the problem.  Currently, if it boots, it is random.. .left on over night .. 2 nights ago and came back to a HP logo with Hash Lines horizontal across the screen.. frozen.. rebooted back to black screen.. no HP logo...

Can you get into the BIOS? Maybe an update is in order (though I wouldn't count on that to fix, but it can't hurt to try), or quite possibly you have some bad memory.\n", "Q: Ubuntu keeps randomly switching disks It took me a while to notice, but here's what happens. I have 2 disks on my computer.\nOn startup, Ubuntu's Disk Utility tells me one is sda and the other sdb. On restart it switches them and on another restart, switches again. It's impossible for me to set my /etc/fstab with the OS randomly switching my disks. I am not changing any settings in BIOS.\nHow can I make this stop?\n\nA: Use the device mapper. Instead of mounting, say, /dev/sda1, mount by ID. This is how the respective line from fstab would look like:\nUUID=xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx  / ext3 relatime,error=remount-ro  0  1\n\nYou can find out what the id's are with blkid:\n/dev/sda3: UUID=\"xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx\" TYPE=\"ext3\"\n\nThe above UUID is what you should use in the fstab entry above.\nFrom the fstab man page:\n\nInstead of giving the device explicitly, one may indicate the (ext2 or xfs) filesystem that is to be mounted by its  UUID  or  volume  label  (cf.\n         e2label(8)  or  xfs_admin(8)), writing LABEL= or UUID=, e.g., 'LABEL=Boot' or 'UUID=3e6be9de-8139-11d1-9106-a43f08d823a6'.  This will\n         make the system more robust: adding or removing a SCSI disk changes the disk device name but not the filesystem volume label.\n\n\nA: This is why Grub uses UUID-s instead of old-fashion /dev/sd* reference. The UUID is unique, and it doesn't matter in which order is seeing the OS the disks. So, update your /etc/fstab to use UUID-s, and you sould not worry about it anymore. (More info here.)  \nThe reason for switching should be a BIOS error (this needs some more investigation).\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server 12.04 as a router. Problem with DNS?? Or Routing table? I have a virtualbox lab made up of 4 Windows 2008 R2 servers (DC/DNS,SQL,SHAREPOINT, EXCHANGE) that are configured with static ip addresses with NIC's attached to Internal network. Everything works.\nI had the requirement to execute some tests that also access external services available on the internet. \nTo keep things clean and similar to the production environment I have installed another VM, with Ubuntu Server 12.04 64 bit and configured (I hope) to work as a router like described on this post.\nThis VM has two network interfaces: first is Bridged with the host and is used as a WAN connection and the other one attached in the Internal Network with its own static IP address on the internal network subnet.\nBut actually the Windows servers does not connect to the internet while the unix one connects.\nI did a route command. this is the result:\nKernel IP Routing table\nDestination       Gateway        Genmask         Flags   Metric  Ref     Use   Iface\ndefault           10.69.121.1    0.0.0.0         UG      100     0         0   eth0\n10.69.121.0       *              255.255.255.0   U       0       0         0   eth0\n192.168.83.0      *              255.255.255.0   U       0       0         0   eth1\n\nCan somebody help me with this configuration? :)\nThanks!\nAddendum: I forgot to mention that one of the windows server hosts a DNS service for which I should maybe configure a forwarding server but I do not exactly know which server to forward on... :(\n\nA: I assume you are using bridged mode in the vbox adapter that you want to connect to internet in ubuntu server. And have ip_forward=1 set in your sysctl. \nProbably your ubuntu server isn't configured to do NAT and the gateway (10.69.121.1) doesn't have your internal network(192.168.83.0) in his routing table, so that's why, you send ping to internet but don't recieve. \nYou have two solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Configure route on your gateway to you internal network\n\n*Configure your ubuntu server to do NAT. \n\n\nI personally prefer the 2nd option. To do that, you need to use iptables. In your case you want to translate everything that comes out on interface eth0, so the command is:\n\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE. \n\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Ubuntu without formatting any partitions? Can I install Ubuntu without formatting any partitions on my hard drive?\nI am already running Windows 7 and I want to install Ubuntu as well without formatting any of the partitions I have already created.\n\nA: Of course you can. You just have to select the manual partitioning method and tell the installer not to format any partition you want to use.\nHowever you'll have to create at least an empty ext3/ext4 partition where to install Ubuntu (you can choose also to create another empty partition of about 2Gb to be used as swapspace). You can repartition your hard drive, for example, using GParted livecd.\nUbuntu will also install grub2 for you, detecting your other Windows installation.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Yes, you can install the Wubi version of Ubuntu, or you can install Ubuntu to a USB drive and boot off that instead.  \n\nA: yes sure, use wubi from ubuntu official site at the following link and that's a good tutorial step by step guide\n\nA: Then you can go with WUBI..\nPls find the following guides below,\n\n*\n\n*http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/wubi.html\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide\n\n*Can I install Ubuntu inside Windows?\n\n*How can I dual boot Windows and Ubuntu?\nNote:\n\n*\n\n*You can also use live cd if you want to test.\n\n*Or install virtualbox in windows and then install ubuntu in it.\n\n\nA: The best option here would be to go with the Windows installer for Ubuntu Desktop (WUBI).\nHere's a link where you can find the download and instructions:\nWindows Installer | Ubuntu\n\nA: You can install it with VMPlayer within windows 7.\n\nA: WUBI is a good method. First download from the links provided in above replies.\nThen you can either ask WUBI to download an .iso for you or you can download an Ubuntu .iso of your choice (this is if you want to test an older version of Ubuntu, cuz WUBI when prompted will download the latest version.)\nAfter that run WUBI, and all steps are simple. Allocate space for Ubuntu as you want and according to what you will use it for.\nCareful, at one step it will ask if you want to install Ubuntu \"alongside\" Windows or as an application.\nAlongside option will install Ubuntu as a complete separate OS, it will reset MBR to call GRUB at boot-up and will result in a dual-boot.\nInstall as application will just install Ubuntu as any normal software inside Windows which can be deleted later.\n\nA: I'm assuming you want to install Ubuntu on a physical disk (as opposed to the Wubi installation, which installs Ubuntu like a Windows software)\nIt depends on whether you have suitable Linux partitions (ext4, ext3, btrfs ..) on your computer already. If you have such partitions, you don't need to format that partition again. But also note, If the partition doesn't have enough free space, you have to delete some files from that partition to create room for Ubuntu installation. \nBut, if you want to install Ubuntu as like a Windows program, called Wubi method you don't need to format anything. But still you need to have enough room on the partition, you are going to install Ubuntu in.\n\n\n*\n\n*Take a look at the Wubi installation guide\n\n*A detailed article about Ubuntu's Wubi method, can be found in this Wikipedia article \nBut there are some limitations of this method, such as hibernation is not supported and slow disk performance etc.\n", "Q: Google Authenticator for Desktop (lightdm or gdm plugin) There has a been a similar question, but that's not exactly what I want.\nI'd like to know if there is a plugin, or add-on, for lightdm or gdm that allows me to authenticate using my password AND google authenticator. I'm talking about entering your GA code into the desktop login -- both GUI or command line, shell login -- in order to gain access to your local desktop.\n\nA: Take a look at this blog post titled: Google Two-Step Authentication On Your Desktop\nWhat is it?\nInstallation\nsudo apt-get install libpam-google-authenticator\n\nUsage\ngoogle-authenticator\n\n    \n                                                \nAccording to the blog post there's a version of lightdm-kde that has the 2 factor authentication included which can take advantage of Google Authenticator when you add the included PAM module into your environment.\nauth required pam_google_authenticator.so\n\nResulting in your GUI logins looking like this:\n\n\nsource here\n\nA: Using Two-Factor authentication on ssh configured like described above here previously still leaves your system open to possible brute force attacks on your password. That could compromise already the first factor: your password. So personally I decided to add the following line not on the bottom but at the top of the /etc/pam.d/sshd file as previously wasn't noted cleary:\nauth required pam_google_authenticator.so\n\nThat results in first a prompt for your verification code, then for your password (regardless if you entered the verification code correct). With this configuration, if you entered either the verification code or password incorrectly you have to enter them both again. I agree it's a bit more of a nuisance, but hey: you wanted security or just a sense of security?\n\nA: Installation\nInstall the Google Authenticator PAM-module like this:\nsudo apt-get install libpam-google-authenticator\n\nNow run google-authenticator (inside a terminal) for every user you want to use Google Authenticator with and follow the instructions. You will get a QR-Code to scan with your smartphone (or a link) and emergency-codes.\nConfiguration\nTo activate Google Authenticator look inside the directory /etc/pam.d/. There is a file for every way to authenticate with your computer. You need to edit the configuration files for every service you want to use with Google Authenticator with. If you want to use it with SSH, edit sshd, if you want to use it in LightDM, edit lightdm. In those files, add one of the following lines:\nauth required pam_google_authenticator.so nullok\nauth required pam_google_authenticator.so\n\nUse the first line, while you're still migrating your users to Google Authenticator. Users who don't have it configured can still log in. The second line will force the usage of Google Authenticator. Users who don't have it, can't log in anymore. For sshd it is quite crucial you put the line at the top of the file to prevent brute-force attacks on your password.\nTo add it to LightDM you could run this:\necho \"auth required pam_google_authenticator.so nullok\" | sudo tee -a /etc/pam.d/lightdm\n\nNow when you log in you will get seperately asked for your password and the 2-step authentication code.\nEncrypted home directories\nIf you use home-encryption (ecryptfs) the file $HOME/.google_authenticator will not be readable for the PAM-module (because it is still encrypted). In this case you need to move it somewhere else and tell PAM where to find it. A possible line could look like this:\nauth required pam_google_authenticator.so secret=/home/.ga/${USER}/.google_authenticator\n\nYou need to create a directory for every user in /home/.ga that has the users name and change the ownership of that directory to the user. Then the user can run google-authenticator and move the created .google-authenticator file to that directory. The user could run the following lines:\nsudo install -g $(id -rgn) -o $USER -m 700 -d /home/.ga/$USER\ngoogle-authenticator\nmv $HOME/.google_authenticator /home/.ga/$USER\n\nThis will allow the module to access the file.\nFor other options, check out the README.\n", "Q: Microphones Not Working with 12.04 Installed Ubuntu precise pangolin and everything is working fine except for my microphones (both internal and external).

It operates an Intel Sandy Bridge architecture. The main issue about this tablet is that it ships with an installed Windows 7 in (U)EFI mode (GPT partition table, etc.), so I'd like to get an EFI dual boot with Ubuntu.\nBut it seems I can't boot on the liveCD in EFI mode. It starts loading (up to initrd), but I then get a blank (black) screen. I've tried the nomodeset kernel option (as well as removing quiet and splash) with no luck.\n\n[2012-09-27]\nI have used the Ubuntu 12.04.1 Desktop ISO (I have read somewhere that it is the only one that can boot in EFI mode).\nI'd say this has something to do with UEFI since the LiveCD boots in bios mode but not in efi mode.\nBesides, I am not sure my boot info will help, since I can't boot the LiveCD in EFI mode. As a result I can't install ubuntu in EFI mode. So it would be the boot info from the liveCD boot in bios mode. This happens on a ubuntu-12.04.1-desktop-amd64 iso used on a LiveUSB. Live USB was created by dd'ing the iso onto the full disk device (i.e. /dev/sdx no number) of the Flash drive.\nI have also tried copying the LiveCD files on a primary GPT partition, but with no luck, I just get the grub shell, no menu, no install option.\n\n[2012-09-28]\nI tried today a flash drive created with Ubuntu's Startup Disk Creator and the alternate 12.04.1 64 bit ISO. I get a grub menu in text mode (which meens it did start in efi mode) with install options / test options. But when I start any of these, I simply get a black screen (no cursor, neither mouse nor text-mode cursor). I tried removing the 'quiet' option and adding nomodeset and acpi=off, but it didn't do any good.

Then I used boot-repair to try installing grub-efi and get a system that would boot in efi mode.

The following might still be involved in some way, so I'll leave it here for others to reference. But it turned out NOT to solve the problem. Neither did reverting to a 2.6.x kernel.\n\nMy system is using the r8169 driver for my Realtek 8168 chip Ethernet port (on the motherboard in my case. Note: 8168 -- not 8169!)\nI finally got onto this issue when I found this post. I quickly confirmed that my 8168 card was using the r8169 driver by running ... \nsudo lshw -class network\n\n..., which takes a while -- just be patient. :-)\nYou can see the driver being used in the configuration: line ... Example: ...\nconfiguration: autonegotiation=on broadcast=yes driver=r8168 driverversion=8.026.00-NAPI ...\n\nThen I mostly followed the instructions in this post to install and activate the correct driver, changing specific paths as required to match my system. Note that the driver download site does not mention the v3.x.x kernel (only 2.4.x and 2.6.x) But it works just fine anyway.\nIf you have only one network interface, then you should be all set by this stage.\nUnfortunately, it wasn't quite that simple for me, because I also had a second card installed, which did have an actual 8169 chip on it! :-/ So, I couldn't just leave the r8169 driver disabled. \nTo fix this, I renamed the /lib/module/your-kernel-version/drivers/net/r8169.bak file (the autorun.sh driver installer script renamed it) back to r8169.ko and edited /etc/modules as follows ...\n# /etc/modules: kernel modules to load at boot time.\n#\n# This file contains the names of kernel modules that should be loaded\n# at boot time, one per line. Lines beginning with \"#\" are ignored.\n\nloop\nlp\nr8168\nr8169\n\n...

I have to switch my BIOS to legacy mode in order to boot from CD. If I were to do a normal installation and remain in legacy mode, the BIOS will display \"operating system not found\". If I switch back then the BIOS just boots to windows.\nTo solve the problem, I tried following the steps in the previous two articles. My drive is partitioned as:\nsda1 FAT32 Location of Windows EFI files (flagged as boot in Ubuntu install)\nsda2 unknown\nsda3 NFTS Windows C:\nsda4 ext4 Ubuntu root\nsda5 swap\nsda6 ext4 Ubuntu home\nI was a little confused by the requirement in the second article to \"be careful to install Grub bootloader in /dev/sda3\"\nIn my case, the relevant partition is sda1. I have tried three things: setting the sda1 mount point as /boot, as /boot/efi, and as the special reserved grub partition. In each install I indicated that grub should be installed in sda1.\nAfter each install I reboot to the live CD and look in the sda1. I see EFI/Boot and EFI/Windows, but no EFI/Ubuntu and consequently no grubx64.efi.\nI understand the recommended procedure of moving grubx64.efi into the EFI/Boot directory and replacing the present bootx64.efi file, but I see no grubx64.efi and I don't know where it should be.\n\nA: Broadly speaking you have three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually install an EFI boot loader for Linux. This is the easiest solution in principle, but it can be tricky to get working in practice.\n\n*Re-install Ubuntu, but figure out how to get your computer to boot the installer in EFI mode rather than in BIOS mode. Chances are this can be done by fiddling with options in your firmware, but the details vary so much from one system to another that it's hard to give simple and definitive advice.\n\n*Wipe your hard disk, set your firmware to BIOS mode, and install both Windows and Linux in that mode. This will be a pain to do, but in some cases people in your situation end up resorting to it in the end.\n\n\nTo get started with the first option, I recommend using a USB flash drive. Partition it with GPT and create an EFI System Partition (ESP) on it. (An ESP has its \"boot flag\" set in GParted or has a partition type code of EF00 in gdisk. In either case, it uses a FAT filesystem -- preferably FAT32 -- and it's usually 100-500 MiB in size.) On the ESP, create an EFI/BOOT directory and place your boot loader program there with the name bootx64.efi. For instance, you could put ELILO there. In the case of ELILO, you'd also need to copy a Linux kernel and initial RAM disk to the drive and create a configuration file. The point of all this is that you can mess with the USB flash drive on another computer, stick it into your target system, and tell the firmware to boot from the USB drive in EFI mode. If it doesn't work, you can fiddle with it and try again. Repeat that until it does work. Once you get something that will boot your Linux installation, you can copy those files over to the ESP on your hard disk (/dev/sda1) and use the efibootmgr program to register the boot loader with your firmware.\n\nA: As you can see in my post: Booting the liveCD/USB in EFI mode fails on Samsung Tablet XE700T1A\nI am currently having hard times working with uefi. I think what I did today could solve your problem.\nYou will have to first install win7, then boot on ubuntu-secure-remix in BIOS mode.\nDuring install remember to select \"something else\" when asked about location. In the partition manager instruct installer to use /dev/sda1 as /boot/efi. And whatever other partitions you need (I didn't use a separate /boot partition, but it could work I think).\nSelect /dev/sda as grub device.\n\n\n*\n\n*At install end, tell that you want to \"keep trying ubuntu\".\n\n*Open a terminal and issue the command \"sudo boot-repair\".\n\n*Say yes when boot-repair wants to update to latest ppa version.\n\n*You should see a message \"EFI detected\", then you can go on.\n\n*Select advanced settings\n\n*Select reinstall grub\n\n*On grub tab, select 'use separate /boot/efi partition /dev/sda1'.\n\n*Boot-repair will ask you to issue some commands in the console, do as you are told to.\n\n*when boot repair exits it gives you an url for your boot-info, note it (and send it here)\n\n*Then you can reboot.\n\n\nThis may work for you.

I've been using it for a while with no major issues.\nFirst add the PPA to you software sources and update apt:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:rockclimb/gephi-daily\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen install gephi with:\nsudo apt-get install gephi\n\n\nA: For version 0.9.2 ; Working as of Jan 2020\nIf you are using Debian 10 or Ubuntu 18 or later, openjdk-8-jdk is not available in your sources, do the following to install openjdk-8: \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:openjdk-r/ppa\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk openjdk-8-jre\n\nNow, ensure your java version is 8 and do the following:\ncurl -L -o gephi.tar.gz https://github.com/gephi/gephi/releases/download/v0.9.2/gephi-0.9.2-linux.tar.gz\ntar xzvf gephi.tar.gz\n\nNow, you can run it as with the command bash $PWD/gephi-0.9.2/bin/gephi\n\nHowever, this is not an ideal solution and may not work in the future.\nAn alternative can be using a docker image like atb00ker/docker-turnkey:gephi. The  documentation for usage of this image can be found here:  https://github.com/atb00ker/docker-turnkey/tree/master/gephi \n\n\nA: For people landing here somewhat after 2012, when the question was asked:\nThe answer by rɑːdʒɑ failed for me, but this page here,  archived here, has instructions to solve the problem. You need version <= 8 of JDK.\n", "Q: Problems with upstart script in ~/.init I'm experimenting with running Sonar on my Linux desktop box.  I wanted to make it start up automatically on startup of the box, but it's ok for it to run as me.\nI created \"~/.init/sonar.conf\" with the following simple contents:\ndescription \"Sonar server\"\nstart on startup\nrespawn\nchdir ~/apps/sonar-3.2/bin\nexec ~/apps/sonar-3.2/bin/linux-x86-64/sonar.sh start\n\nI read that Upstart isn't configured for user jobs by default, so I edited \"/etc/dbus-1/system.d/Upstart.conf\", commenting out the existing \"\" element and replacing it with the following:\n<policy context=\"default\">\n  <allow send_destination=\"com.ubuntu.Upstart\" send_interface=\"org.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable\"/>\n  <allow send_destination=\"com.ubuntu.Upstart\" send_interface=\"org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties\"/>\n  <allow send_destination=\"com.ubuntu.Upstart\" send_interface=\"com.ubuntu.Upstart0_6\"/>\n  <allow send_destination=\"com.ubuntu.Upstart\" send_interface=\"com.ubuntu.Upstart0_6.Job\"/>\n  <allow send_destination=\"com.ubuntu.Upstart\" send_interface=\"com.ubuntu.Upstart0_6.Instance\"/>\n</policy>\n\nWhen I do \"start sonar\" I get \"start: Job failed to start\".  I also did \"initctl list | grep sonar\" and got \"sonar stop/waiting\".\nHow can I troubleshoot this further?\n\nA: Likely your issue is that what you think of as startup is not what upstart uses it for. Startup is one of the first events emitted during the system init script boot. So you may well be missing things like network stack and drivers, filesystems, almost everything really. Re-read the manpage carefully about the meaning of the startup event, and also what started means too.\nHere's the process I use to check and test upstart services.\nFirstly check your config:\n# silent if the config is valid    \ninitctl check-config sonar\n# reload the configuration to pick up latest changes\ninitctl reload-configuration\n\nI also add a script -- that does run on startup -- to switch upstart into debug logging mode:\nsudo -s\ncat <<EOCONF > /etc/init/upstart-debug.conf \ndescription \"enable debugging of upstart from within\"\nauthor      \"@dch__\"\nversion     \"0.1\"\n\nstart on startup\n\ntask\nexec initctl log-priority debug\n\nAs it's a task it runs just once. The result now is that you get a lot more detail in /var/log/dmesg - just | grep init: for the history.\nFor your specific upstart job I'd change the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*for normal user daemons I run start on started networking and filesystem which works successfully on Quantal and Precise, but probably not earlier versions.\n\n*use an absolute path rather than a relative one.\n\n*check to see if your sonar.sh script forks or daemonises, if so you will likely need to add expect fork or expect daemon as a stanza.\n\n*finally, sprinkle either emit ... stanzas, or shell echo here statements in your pre-exec and exec scripts and check for this output in the corresponding /var/log/upstart/sonar.log.\n\n\nA: For Upstart User Job\nfollowing Upstart.conf configuration change: https://gist.github.com/bradleyayers/1660182 worked for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*tested on Ubuntu 12.04\n\n*my (user) jobs are in ~/.init \n\n*no restart after saving Upstart.conf is needed\n\n\nRegarding your sonar.conf - start on startup is probably too early. start on desktop-session-start seems more appropriate for user jobs. \nEdit: user jobs are not respected by Ubuntu at startup as described in this Bug report - you can use following workaround.\n", "Q: Laptop power button not working I have a (seemingly rather exotic) Dell Latitude XT2 notebook running Lubuntu 12.04, fresh install.\nTried to get the power button to work as expected (opening the logout dialog lubuntu-logout), but no success: power button does nothing but forced power-off on long press.\nThe power button itself is detected and works. In xfce4-power-manager-settings, when I set the power button action from \"Ask\" (= open lubuntu-logout) to \"Shutdown\", the laptop shuts down successfully; pressing the power button is recognized and processed correctly.\nEdit: I removed a bunch of info from the question, as it seems not to be related to the problem.\n\nA: Install acpi and acpi-support, if not already installed.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to /etc/acpi/events.\n\n*There should be a file named powerbtn (if not, make it).

In xfce4-power-manager-settings, there are several actions to select for the Power Button being pressed. When you select \"Shut Down\", it works as expected, but when you select \"Ask\", nothing happens.\nA workaround is in the comment #10. It works for me. Seems there's an underlying problem between xfce4 and LXDE.\nYou can create the same behaviour with an (additional) acpi daemon, like green7 said. The version in his answer shuts down the PC w/o a dialog, but we discussed in chat that you can start lubuntu-logout from the script instead of simply shutting down the computer. This needs some work, though, as you have to start the logout application as a user who is allowed to connect to X, and provide the necessary environment variables (like $DISPLAY). As the env variables seem to vary between the distros, I think you had to look them up carefully for LXDE.\n\nThe workaround link was broken, but seems to be restored (although the site is slow). Here's the gist:\n\nlogin to your LXDE session (Lubuntu settings in the combo box)\nopen a terminal\nkill xfce4-power-manager: xfce4-power-manager -q\nopenbox --reconfigure\nstart xfce4-power-manager: xfce4-power-manager\n\n[...]\nMy opinion is there is a conflict between xfce4-power-manager and LXDE and order in which these applications start seems to be important... strange...\n\n", "Q: Link to directory in bash I'm using the ln command to create a symbolic link to a directory using bash, I went to the directory I wanted to make a link and used the following command:\nln -s C#/ ~/Projetos\n\nThis would create a link to ~/media/Projects/C# in  the ~/Projetos folder.\nBut once I cd to my home, the folder is displayed in red color and I can't access it, what's happening here?\n \n\nA: You can check the link using ls -l (which is usually aliased to just ll). You will see something like this:\n user42@localhost$ ll ~/Projetos\n lrwxrwxrwx 1 user42 user42    3 Sep 26 19:48 Projetos -> C#/\n\nthis means, that using the path /home/user42/Projetos will be substituted with /home/user42/C#. This path does not exist. \nYou probably wanted to use either\n\n\n*\n\n*a correct relative link like ln -s media/Projects/C# ~/Projetos\n\n*or an absolute link like in ln -s $PWD/C#/ ~/Projetos\n", "Q: Chrome keeps crashing after updates I'm a chrome user and an enthusiast but few days ago I made Ubuntu get some updates using Update Manager, then I turned off my notebook and when I restarted it, I tried to start Chrome which after a few seconds turned the screen completely black, and some errors appeared for few seconds and then I got logged off, and had to re-login,\nand when I opened Chrome again the same thing happened!\nI've uninstalled it with Synaptic and did complete cleanings before re-installing Chrome but nothing succeeded. Now I can't use either Chromium and Chrome, but Firefox works. It's a very strange thing, never happened to me before and I don't know what to do because I had all my bookmarks syncronized in Chrome!\nPlease help if you can :)\n\nA: If your bookmarks are the only thing you are worried about, you can recover them from \nthe terminal by running cp ~/.config/google-chrome/Default/Bookmarks* ~/. This will copy your Chrome bookmarks to your home folder directory. \nYou should sync Chrome through Google, it is one of the major selling points of chrome. http://www.guidingtech.com/3125/chrome-bookmarks-sync/ \nI also recommend you do the following: open the terminal and run \nChrome. It will crash but give you an output of what may have happened. \nYou can use the command \ntail -f /var/log/syslog\n\nto see what may have gone wrong. \nMy advice for you though is to make a new profile: Briefly, after backing up your data, open nautilus (home folder), press CtrlH to display hidden files,  navigate to .config/ and delete both chromium and google-chrome folders and start Chrome over. A totally clean profile will be recreated automatically. Let us know what happened, so I can improve my answer.\nThe official version on creating a new profile in Chrome is here: Create a new browser user profile.\n\nA: Same thing happened to me, and I found the following user who was able to resolve the issue:\nhttp://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/chrome/xcKqyLSij5A/OGSpv2FaLZoJ\nCould it be that in your case, as in mine and the above user's, you tried updating your NVIDIA drivers and something went wrong?

The problem is routing.  I can't assign 2 default gateways.. one to eth0 and one to eth3.  Right now I only have a default gateway on eth0.  My 192.1.1.0 network has internet access, eth1 talks to eth0 which has a default gateway to the internet.  My 10.1.1.0 network does not have internet, eth2 is either talking to eth3 which has no default gateway OR eth2 is trying to talk to eth0 which is forbidden by my iptables.  How can I go about adding 2 default gateways or go about solving this problem?\n\nA: Sounds like he wants to route lan1 via wan1 and lan2 via wan2.\nGet a cisco router <- much easier to implement.\n", "Q: Is my kernel version OK or I have to update it?

3.2.0-31-generic. This means your kernel is indeed fairly outdated. Best practice is to always keep your computer as up to date as possible and Ubuntu is no exception.\nYou can update the kernel on a desktop system by using the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic linux-headers-generic linux-image-generic\n\nIf you also want to update all other software this can be done by issuing the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nBe warned that these commands do require sudo (admin) privileges and you have to reboot afterwards.\nSimpler is to use the update manager to check for updates and install them:\n\n\nA: You have the old grub. Updating grub will solve the problem as the new grub is better at keeping track of kernels and other OSs in the hard drives. \nFollow this how to: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Upgrading \nThanks to  user68186\n\nA: In my case I had to upgrade the Hardware Enablement Stack HWE, in order to receive the latest kernel.\n", "Q: I want to be asked for password for mounting drives In earlier Ubuntu releases (As far as I remember Natty had it) we were asked for password while trying to mount the drive using Nautilus.

But I want to re-enable that feature.\nQuestion is: How can I re-enable that feature i.e being asked for mounting drive?\n\nA: To re-enable that feature, you have to change the default policy.

Not what I would have wanted, but hopefully this will be fixed in the next version of Ubuntu.\nI someone else has the same problem here is what worked for me:\nInstall build-essentials\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nDownload the driver from Asus. I found them here: http://www.asus.com/Networks/Wireless_Adapters/PCEN53/\nUnpack the downloaded .zip file. The download comes with a lot of instructions for what you need to do. Most of them turn out to not be required.\nEnter the directory where you unpacked the zip and unpack the driver code.\ntar -jxvf DPO_GPL_RT5592STA_LinuxSTA_v2.6.0.0_20120326.tar.bz2\n\nEnter the new directory and start make\nmake\n\nThis runs for a while and then fails due to a missing /tftpboot directory. This does not seem to be relevant since the correct file is made anyway.\nNow install the driver.\nsudo make install\n\nThe installation instructions tells you to edit a /etc/rc.d/rc.local file. Since I didn't have neither the file or directory I just skipped this step and rebooted.\nAfter the reboot everything seems to work. Ubuntu automatically found the card and it is what I am using now. Since I have only been using it for 10 minutes I don't know how stable it is but hopefully it will be ok.\nNote: I found that I had to have my Ethernet unplugged and then restart Ubuntu for this to take. Otherwise works great.\n\nA: I was having the same problem and emailed Asus about the should support the 3.x kernel and they wrote back saying that they have forwarded the email the their tech team.\nAnyway I was doing a bit more research into the matter and found a post on the Arch Linux forums. A user there posted a patch to get it working on a 3.x Linux kernel, I have tested it and so far all is functional with a couple of hours of light usage.\nHere is the link to the patch file, just apply it to the Linux drivers from the Asus website.\n\nA: When I followed the instructions here, the driver installed and allowed me to connect to my router for about two seconds then I got a kernel panic and had to do a hard reset to recover.\nHere are the differences in the steps that I took and it worked like a charm:\nDownloaded the drivers from ASUS's website (did not use from CD) even though it looked like the same version.\nI used sudo make (instead of just make) and it compiled without the errors mentioned above. (not sure if this matters but when I ran just make, it error-ed out at the end. I ran sudo make and it completed.\nI then ran sudo make install. After that completed, I rebooted and it's been stable after a few reboots.\nHope this helps any in the same situation.\n\nA: This worked and was an excellent guide when I was running 11.10. But now that I've upgraded to 12.10, activating the card leads to a complete lock-up within seconds. \n$ uname -a\nLinux Zubzero 3.5.0-18-generic #29-Ubuntu SMP Fri Oct 19 10:26:51 UTC 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n$ lsb_release -a\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 12.10\nRelease:    12.10\nCodename:   quantal\n\nlshw output:\n *-network\n       description: Trådlöst gränssnitt\n       product: Ralink corp.\n       vendor: Ralink corp.\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:09:00.0\n       logical name: ra0\n       version: 00\n       serialnumber: 10:bf:48:xx:xx:xx\n       width: 32 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless\n       configuration: broadcast=yes driver=RALINK WLAN latency=0 multicast=yes wireless=Ralink STA\n       resources: irq:16 memory:f4400000-f440ffff\n\n\nA: I was able to get the driver working on Ubuntu 13.10 by following the directions at this link.\nThe essential parts that I found to get it working required\n\n\n*\n\n*patching the driver code to compile on a 3.x kernel (specifically 3.11.x )\n\n*use sudo make instead of make\n\n*(optional) sudo modprobe rt5592sta to load the driver without the need for a reboot.\n\n", "Q: How to copy playlist from Banshee to MP3 player? I have an Android phone which I use as a music player, and I use Banshee to manage the music on my computer. I can copy music fairly easily from Banshee to the phone, I can even copy the music (MP3s) contained in a playlist.\nWhat I would like to do is copy the playlist itself, but that is apparently not so straightforward. What I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag and drop the playlist from the computer to the phone (under Devices). This copies all the MP3 files across.\n\n*Right-click on the device and select 'New playlist'. Then tried dragging and dropping the contents of the playlist on my computer into the playlist on the phone. It would not let me.\n\n*Right-click on the playlist on the computer and 'Export playlist', then save it to the Android phone. This came close, but the folder structure was all wrong, so it couldn't find the music.\n\n\nThis seems like it should be a pretty straightforward process - is there a way to do it, or are there extensions that will let me do it? If necessary, I could use Rhythmbox instead, but it seems that is equally unable to do this.\n\nA: I'm a little late to the party, but better late than never right?\nI think I have a better solution.  After much reading of forums and gnashing of teeth, I figured out how to get banshee to sync playlists to an sd-card.  I read lots of instructions on different forums/mailing lists, some gave only part of the information you need, some simply gave bad info (for example several posts showed the .is_audio_player file with a line \"playlist_format\" instead of \"playlist_formats\".  That \"s\" makes all the difference!)\nAnyway, \nAdd a file .is_audio_player to the root directory of your sdcard or android device's main memory.  \nOpen the file and add these lines:\nname=\"name you want banshee to call your phone\"\naudio_folders=Music/\noutput_formats=audio/mpeg,audio/x-ms-wma,application/ogg\nplaylist_formats=audio/x-mpegurl,audio/mpeg-url\nplaylist_path=Playlists/\n\nendoffile=PlaceThisHereToEnsureThereIsABlankSpaceBeforeTheLastLineOfTheFile\n\n(there are other lines you can add, just google for .is_audio_player for more info.  That last line comes for a post left by one of the developers of banshee noting that banshee won't pick up the last line in the file without a hard return at the end)\nThen load banshee, your sd card will now show that it supports playlists, and the sync function will work for music and playlists.  \nPro-tip, you can create a smart playists to act as a meta-playlist for all the playlists you want to transfer over. Your media player on the phone should now pick up all your music and all your playlists (only checked by me with the google play music app).\\\nhope this helps somebody...\n\nA: ok, the following seemed to me, that it was a studpid answer, and I couldn't believe it, when I read it the first time, but it works.\nfound on: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1693031.html\nthe first thing you have to do ist to use a .is_audio_player file, no way else.\nthen \n1. Create a Smart Playlist (f.e. XYZ)\n2. Set the conditions of the smart playlists to \"Playlist\" and \"is\" and select the playlists you want on your media player.\n3. Sync the smart playlist (XYZ) with your media player by the menu on the device shwon in banshee.\n4. It will copy all the files, and populate your playlists - on the player - automatically at the end.\n\nA: Well, this is the way I found to do it in the end:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the playlist contents across to the external player by dragging the playlist from under Music in the left pane down onto the player entry under Devices. This copies the files across, but not the playlist.\n\n*Right-click on the playlist and select \"Export Playlist...\" Save it to the base music directory on your computer (e.g. ~/Music).\n\n*Copy the playlist file (.m3u in my case) to the base music directory on the external device.\n\n*Use listFix() to re-link the playlist entries to the correct files on the external device. At least in Android, the player will locate the playlist and index all the music files correctly.\n\n\nPerhaps there's a more straighforward way than this, that doesn't require external tools...\n", "Q: VSFTPD: default to local user subdirectory The goal: when a local user logs in to ftp, the user is directed to /home/{username}/htdocs.

When I got the OOPS message about a writable root I made the user's home directory not writable, etc., ending up with the situation described above.  Further research had me read more closely the commentary on solving the OOPS problem.  One correspondent pointed out that the previous version of vsftpd did not have the constraint on writable roots.  So I dug into the history files to find version 2.3.2.  That version gives me the results I was looking for.\nbtw, I did try installing version 3.0.2 of vsftpd on my 32-bit virtual machine installation and got an error related to not finding 'crypt'.  Since I was already in way over my head I did not try to resolve that error.

Since the vmware virtual machine drivers are pretty standard I don't see any technical reason for a preinstalled image not to be portable.\nAlthough the above situation is obvious, I didn't find any preinstalled vmware image for Ubuntu.\nIs there a trusted free vmware image or an OVF image with Ubuntu preinstalled? \nNote: OVF image works with most of the players!\n\nA: Hyper V has some Ubuntu presets see Run Ubuntu virtual machines made even easier with Hyper-V Quick Create\n\nA: There is an official place where ubuntu distributes it's cloud images (including ovf format):\nhttps://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/\nEx, for 14.04 (scroll to page bottom): \nhttps://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/trusty/current/\n\nA: The VMWare tools for Fusion-5 doesn't work on Ubuntu 14.04LTS. VMware is recommending using Fusion-6 to build a Ubuntu 14.04 image and using it on Fusion-5. Hence finding a pre-built image with VMware tools installed would be great. \nI found one, which seems to be working: http://www.trendsigma.net/vmware/ubuntu1404t.html\nI'm just not sure of the source.\n\nA: Seems the same question's already been asked on SuperUser - Where can I find Ubuntu Desktop releases on a vmdk\nThe following is the accepted answer:\n\nI have not found any official ubuntu website distributing vmdk's.\nAccording to   http://www.vmware.com/appliances/directory/\nvery few suppliers of ubuntu desktop on vmdk exist (3 to be exact).\nThis seems to be focused on vm creation and distribution, and for now\n  I consider this the de-facto website to go to for ubuntu desktop\n  vmdk's:   http://vmplanet.net/\nThese guys seem to have vm creation and distribution as a side-project\n  to their main line of business:   http://www.quotrader.com/\nhttp://www.bitconstructor.com/\n\nbut the highest-voted answer is as follows:\n\nYou can find many VMs on VMware's site.\nOpen the site and go to \"Virtual Appliances\"; Ubuntu LTS 11.4 is one\n  of the many images there.\n\nThe newest Ubuntu 11.04 VMware appliance starts out of the box with a\n    desktop looking like Gnome 2.x, but can be transformed to start the\n    Unity desktop from Ubuntu. Contrary to the basic Ubuntu 11.04 image\n    this one has the latest VMware Tools installed.\n\n\nNote: The VMware's site also seems to have Ubuntu 12.04, both desktop and server versions but it's the VMWare store and you have to buy it.\nThe OP also adds:\n\njust make sure you have installed the latest vmware player so you\n  don't have problems like I had with vmplayer not being able to run an\n  virtual image made with a newer version.\n\n\nA: If you determine that a ready-made image is not available, installing either the server or desktop iso in VMWare Player is exceptionally easy, at least from my limited experience.  On a Win7 Pro, 32-bit, laptop  the Easy Install (most likely a part of VMWare tools) made the installation happen with minimal keyboard work on my part.

It is (seemingly) obviously an issue with Ubuntu (or perhaps Gnome?).\nHas anyone else experienced this?\n\nA: Why must this be an issue with Byobu, Gnome or Ubuntu? When I do a little investigation I see a lot of people having similar problems that are using Windows. The problem seems to be caused by the motherboard or the CPU itself.\nWhat kind of benefit do you have when overclocking? Sure stressing operations like video encoding finish a few seconds or minutes earlier at the cost of being unstable and producing corrupt results. Also the hardware wears out faster and that configuration isn't supported by the manufacturer. Everyone wants that of course. And why do you need to monitor your CPU temperature? Sure I did kind of like this stuff 5 years back on Windows with Samurize. But why? If your CPU gets to hot it will either clock down preemptively (bye bye overclocking benefits, we know that since the Prescott days) or the BIOS/EFI will warn you at a specified threshold and will shutdown when passing the second specified threshold. If you're running that box remotely in a datacenter as a server, I hope people like you get extra charged for the amout of additional cooling needed. Just because of urban legends like \"yeah compiled my realtime kernel with this special patchset, now our $InsertRandomMultiplayerShooterHere server runs 3 % faster\". Absolutely. And if something goes wrong always blame other people, always.\nStandard of the shelf hardware with standard configuration doesn't seem to have enough issues these days.\n", "Q: Touchpad right-click doesn't work on my Asus notebook I just installed 12.04 and I noticed that my Touchpad's right-click isn't working at all.

How can I determine if a package is a meta-package from the command line, possibly via apt-get, aptitude or apt-cache?\nI have tried:\napt-cache show texlive-full\napt-cache showpkg texlive-full\n\nbut the only way I can tell this package is meta is by reading the \"en-description\" field.\nIs there a more automatic way of doing this, that will give me a yes/no response, or at least have a field such as then \"en-description\" dedicated to this?\n\nA: There is no formal definition of a metapackage. The informal definition is that a metapackage is one that is only intended to be installed for its dependencies and contains no useful file of its own.\nYou can define a metapackage as a package that contains no file. There is no way to determine this from the package database. You can use the file database and check that the package contains only directories (many such packages contain a few directories). In fact, most metapackages contain a few files in /usr/share/doc/<package name>: a copyright file, a changelog, sometimes a few more. Here's an approximation that defines a metapackage as containing only files in /usr/share/doc/<some directory> (not in subdirectories of that) and the leading directories:\nif ! apt-file -F list $package | grep -qvE '^/(usr(/share(/doc(/[^/]*(/[^/]*)?)?)?)?)?$'; then\n  echo \"$package looks like a metapackage\"\nfi\n\nAnother approach is to look for a package tag with debtags. There are several tags that are commonly used on metapackages.\ndebtags tag ls $package | grep -x -e 'role::metapackage' -e 'role::dummy' -e 'special::meta'\n\nAnother approach is to look for packages with a small size. Each directory counts as 4 kB, so plan accordingly when picking a threshold (again, this is an approximation).\naptitude -F '%I %p' search \"~n^$package\\$\"\n\n\nUpon reflection, I wonder if you mean virtual packages rather than metapackages. Virtual packages are actually not packages but package names used in Provides: fields. You can list them with aptitude search '~v'. Running apt-cache show on one displays “Can't select versions from package 'zcav' as it is purely virtual”. Running aptitude show lists the packages that provide it. A convenient way to show virtual packages is with apt-cache: this prints one line for a non-virtual package and potentially multiple lines (one for each provider) for a virtual package — you can tell if the package is virtual even if there is a single provider because the name of the provider is different.\napt-cache -n search \"^$package\\$\"\n\n\nA: You could try entering\napt-cache search 'metapackage | meta-package'\n\nwhich will give you a long list, and then use grep to, say show all science related metapackages with\napt-cache search 'metapackage | meta-package' | grep -i science\n\nThis will return a long list (I have shortened it here)\nscience-astronomy - Debian Science Astronomy packages\nscience-astronomy-dev - Debian Science Astronomy-dev packages\nscience-biology - Debian Science Biology packages\nscience-chemistry - Debian Science Chemistry packages\nscience-dataacquisition - Debian Science data acquisition packages\nscience-dataacquisition-dev - Debian Science data acquisition development packages\nscience-distributedcomputing - Debian Science Distributed Computing packages\nscience-electronics - Debian Science Electronics packages\nscience-electrophysiology - Debian Science packages for Electrophysiology\nscience-engineering - Debian Science Engineering packages\nscience-engineering-dev - Debian Science Engineering-dev packages\nscience-geography - Debian Science Geography packages\nscience-highenergy-physics - Debian Science High Energy Physics packages\n\nYou can use any number of alternatives for science, such as KDE to find all the KDE metapackages. \nThis is probably about the best you can do with apt-cache, but it should quickly locate most of the metapackages you want to find. If it doesn't find exactly everything you were looking for, the simplest thing is to look in the metapackage section in Synaptic.\n", "Q: How to Clean Install on reformated disc?

I could run RDP through an SSH tunnel and all was well.\nThen it stopped working.  I can get as far as the password dialog for my work machine, but then it just says Cannot connect to RDP server localhost.\nI can't even find any logs that look interesting.  I've re-installed remmina, cleared my .remmina directory, restarted my machine, and even restarted my gateway.  \nJust to make it really weird, my laptop (which has the same setup -- latest Ubuntu and Remmina) can make the connection just fine.  It is even going through the same router, albeit wirelessly.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: I have no idea why it worked, but I started changing settings one at a time.  When I edited the connection properties, I looked on the \"advanced\" tab and changed the security from \"negotiate\" to \"TLS\", and voila, everything works.  \nStrangely, \"negotiate\" still works on the laptop, but at least I'm back in business with my bigger monitor :)\n\nA: This happened to me when I copied my remmina configuration (under ~/.remmina) from one machine to another.  Perhaps the remmina versions were different; changing security did not help but deleting and recreating the connection did.\n\nA: This just happened to me, and I found this Stack Overflow answer by Alejandro Sanchez (archived), which resolved the issue. Just run rm ~/.freerdp/known_hosts and try again.\nApparently this happens when the keys on the tunnel server change. See Launchpad Bug #944040: Cannot connect to RDP if host fingerprint changes.\nUpdate\nThe first link now points to an answer that was deleted and may not be archived completely. Here's some of the additional info from that link:\n\n\n*\n\n*It seems that the \"known_hosts\" file contains some routing data for each server, that data becomes outdated sometimes, and when Remmina\ntries to connect using the outdated data, it fails. Deleting the\nknown_hosts file solves this problem. – Erel Segal-Halevi Dec 13 '12\nat 10:06\n\n\n*FWIW, my problem had nothing to do with known_hosts (as explained bellow), but everything to do with security settings: see\nhttp://www.bauer-power.net/2013/10/unable-to-connect-to-rdp-server-in.html\nfor details. – Tomislav Nakic-Alfirevic Apr 24 '14 at 10:58\n\n\n*Totally worked, I was wondering where the certs were being stored. I had same issue for most part, was using Remmina to RDP to a certain\nmachine, then one day it stopped working (nothing on the remote\nmachine changed). Other RDP connections I had saved still worked,\nexcept for this one machine. It did happen to use NLA auth, which\nseems to be part of the problem with the newest Remmina not saving\ncerts. – Nicholi Apr 26 '13 at 20:26\n\n\n*thanks , it used to connect perfectly then i reformatted the server and it stopped working , deleting the line for this host worked . –\nBor691 Jan 15 '14 at 8:50\n\n\n*I need to use two services on same address but different ports and using this repeatedly is the only way I could connect to both. –\nGringo Suave Oct 13 '14 at 18:55\n\n\nA: Probably stupid answer, but the problem for me was that I tried connecting through an open Wi-Fi network (unencrypted) and remmina wouldn't allow that. Once I connected to a secure network everything worked as planned again.\n\nA: It worked for me by changing security to NLA for some unknown reason.\n\nA: Today had the same problem with remmina 1.4.8, which I installed from flatpak. I tried all solutions, mentioned above, and none of them was working. I have two laptops, and on one remmina was working, but on new laptop with fresh installation it did not work. So only solution, that was working for me, was uninstalling flatpak version and installing deb version 1.4.2. And it works without any issue.\n\nA: Just to add to itsadok's answer\nHad this same issue when trying to RDP into a Windows server. To confirm that the issue is not related to an incorrect password, I tried to SSH into an Ubuntu server and it worked fine.\nHere's how I fixed it:\nFirst, we need to delete the known_host/known_hosts/known_hosts2 file that Remmina uses:\nIf you installed Remmina as a snap package then run the command below to delete the known_host/known_hosts/known_hosts2 file:\nsudo rm -rf ~/snap/remmina/current/.config/freerdp/known_hosts2\n\nOR\nsudo rm -rf ~/snap/remmina/current/.config/freerdp/known_hosts \n\nOR\nsudo rm -rf ~/snap/remmina/current/.config/freerdp/known_host\n\nIf you installed Remmina as an apt package then run:\nsudo rm -rf ~/.config/freerdp/known_host\n\nNext, fully stop Remmina. To do so open the Remmina app and then run the command below to stop the Reminna process from the command line:\npgrep remmina | xargs sudo kill -9\n\nYou can then start the Remmina application again, this time everything should work fine.\nThat's all.\nI hope this helps\n\nA: The problem is with the viewmode=1 setting in the saved conf file. \nIf you resize the window it should refresh and start showing the session.\nChanging this boolean to 0 will force the window to defaults and it'll refresh on load.\nThe problem is if you resize the window after the session has started, remmina will change this setting back.\nA work around would be to set the window_maximize=0 to true and then just click/press the maximize button/shortcut to bring it back to your settings. \nwindow_maximize=1 \nwindow_height=960 \nviewmode=1 \nWindow_width=1440\n\n\nA: It could also be an issue with the certificate verification, To test if this is the problem go to:\nAdvanced -> check \"Ignore certificate\"\nBe careful, with this check disabled, you may be open to man in the middle attacks. But should be fine connecting on internal networks.\n\nA: It appears to be a permission problem. Try:\nsudo chattr -i ~/.local/share/remmina/RDP/known_hosts2\n\nNote: Your known_hosts2 file location might differ based on your distro.\n\nA: Remove the known_host file in ~/.config.\nRun this command:\nrm ~/.config/freerdp/known_host\n\n\nA: Had the same issue using a RDP connection with an SSH tunnel. The solution was to switch to \"Tunnel via loopback address\" in the SSH Tunnel settings.\nAttempted all choices \"Security Protocol Negotiation\" and \"Gateway Transport Type\" with no success.\n\nA: Note: xrdp service may have stopped in your remote service.\nAs root:\n\n*\n\n*Confirm RDP port 3389 on remote system is listening.\nuse: { $ netstat -tulpn }\n\n*If port 3389 is closed verify xdrp is active\nuse: { $ service xdrp status }\n\n*If inactive...start it up\nuse: { $ service xdrp start }\n\n*To have xrdp service start automatically whenever system is power cycled\nuse: { $ systemctl enable xdrp }\n\n\nA: There are 2 connections. After upgrading to Ubuntu 22.04, one connection works, the other doesn't.\nAn attempt to delete known_host: on the first connection it asks about the certificate, on the second it does not ask - it gives an error.\nSolved switching security to RDP.\n\nA: In my case, I was getting the error:\n\nCould not connect to the RDP server \"192.168.X.X\" via TLS. See the\nDEBUG traces from a terminal for more information.\n\nHappened after the latest remmina update in snap store May 19th 2022 (today), it was working on May 17th, two days ago before the update.\nTurned out I was seeing a lot of \"permission denied\" errors inside the /home/username/snap/remmina directory.\nI uninstalled and re-installed remmina from the snap store, and all started working again. Nothing about TLS or security or whatsoever.\nLooks like permissions messed themselves up in /home/username/snap/remmina folder.\nUpdate: happened again 15 days later.\nSolution:\nI uninstalled the snap version, and installed it from repository, and all is good.\n\nA: I changed \"Security protocol negotiation\" from \"TLS protocol security\" to \"RDP protocol security\" in \"Advanced\" properties of \"Remote Connection Profile\" and it works.\n\nA: So far, connections through bastion works when it wants with Remmina. I ended up by opening an SSH Tunnel from terminal like:\nssh -L 2000:<ip of windows machine>:3389 bastion\n\nThen I configure Remmina to connect with RDP only at localhost:2000.\nI know this looks ugly, but it's also rock solid. And if none of the tricks explained in this post (Like TLS, NLA, RDP in advanced for example), that one at launching an SSH tunnel will bypass all troubles related to Remmina and libssh.\n\nA: I had to change the Security protocol negociation to RDP protocol security in Advanced tab in order to be able to connect to a Windows Server R2 from Ubuntu 22.04 with Remmina 1.4.25.\n", "Q: Wine / PlayOnLinux dependency issues when trying to install I am curious as to why installing PlayOnLinux entails removing seemingly unrelated packages like google-earth-stable.

After the user selects either Chinese or Japanese and my installer sets the LANG=zh_CN.utf8 and LANG=ja_JP.utf8, the output characters turn all to diamonds.  \nI figured that I needed to run setfont to one of the fonts in /usr/share/consolefonts but examining the fonts there, I do not find one that looks chinese or japanese.  A few google searches have let me to pages which indicate the Linux's console does not support these languages and that I would need another console program to gain that capability.\n1) Is it true that the default Linux console does not provide support for japanese or chinese?\n2) If it does have support, what do I need to do in order to enable it?  If fonts are required, what would their names be or where can they be obtained as an ubuntu package?\n3) If it does not have support, does another console (zhcon or chdrv) provide such support?  Will they work in VT mode (I have up to 8 virtual terminals running)?  What is the process for installing and using such a console?\n4) Can a replacement console be used for all my other languages?  That is, do console replacements like chrdrv support the ability to display the characters for all the other languages?\nThanks in advance.\nRoger R. Cruz\n\nA: I don't think it's possible.  There is only room for a few hundred chars in the standard vga/console.  Perhaps one of the Japanese alphabets would technically be possible, but not Chinese.  A few more details are here: https://askubuntu.com/a/98750/116108\nWhat I would suggest is to try fbterm:\nsudo apt-get install fbterm\n\nIt can display a much wider range of UTF-8, so there is a decent chance it will support Chinese if the default font does.  Perhaps that can be changed too.\nAnother choice of last resort might be Pinyin, though I have no idea if significant number of Chinese understand it.\n", "Q: Problems in LibreOffice Writer when saving as .docx I used LibreOffice for a really important task and now I am going nuts. \nI check if everything is OK before closing LibreOffice, nothing seems wrong. But when I reopen the document, I noticed that some of the photos shifted to right and the page numbers' colors have changed. (Also some spaces are changed.) \nWhat can be the reason for that? (I am saving the documents as .docx)\n\nA: LibreOffice Writer is compatible with MS Word, but don't expect that every format you applied in Word will be the same if you open the file in Writer and vice versa. No such thing as 100% compatibility.\nI have been creating documents with MS Word at work and modifies it at home with LibreOffice Writer, and although they are compatible, there are visible changes in the document's formatting such as spacing, font, header and footer, and yes alignment of images as well.\nI'd suggest that if you don't need to open it with Word, stick to the default .odt file format. \nIf you do need to access the file with MS Word, then I'd recommended to save it as .doc and not as .docx. Saving it in older doc version will guarantee (most of the time) to open it in the original document formatting.\nFor more assistance, please see How to maintain document compatibility between LibreOffice and other office suites?\n\nA: Do not save using .docx. The resulting document may be incompatible with Word 2010, and you are seeing that it is not even compatible with Libreoffice's import procedure. \nI have a document that Word 2010 can open when I save it (with Libreoffice 3.6.2) as .doc, but if I save it as .docx, the document cannot be opened at all in Word (there is an error message). This is consistent (as is your experience) with the hypothesis that LO does not properly write .docx. \nAnecdotally, I have had good experience with .doc. But if you are not collaborating with Word users, I see no reason to use anything other than .odt.\n\nA: Its better to save as the libreoffice writer defualt extension (.odt)\n", "Q: Error in running Ubuntu from my USB.

I was wondering if it was possible to add timestamps to terminal prompts, and if so, how could I achieve this?\n\nA: Since I don't have enough reputation points to add a comment to the answer to improve it. It would seem that the only way I can add information is to create a second answer. So, I will repeat what was said as the answer and build on that.\nEdit the .bashrc file for the user that you want to have the date stamp modified for.\nIf you see \"user@host:~$\" you're in your current user's home directory. The .bashrc file is a hidden file since it is prefixed with the dot \".\". To see it in a list you will need to use a long listing.\nYou can use \"ls -a\" and you should then see the \".bashrc\" file.\nEdit the file with a text editor. For exmaple, \"nano .bashrc\", \"vim .bashrc\", \"vi .bashrc\", \"pico .bashrc\" or whatever editor you wish to use.\nIf you want to script this and plan on adding it to many shells for many users it may be beneficial to use the \"echo\" command in conjunction with the append \">>\" operator. For example, \necho \"export PROMPT_COMMAND=\"echo -n \\[\\$(date +%H:%M:%S)\\]\\\\\"\" >> .bashrc\n\nIf you use that method be sure that you are in the current working directory of the user that you wish to modify it for. To check this you can use the \"pwd\" or print working directory command.\nIf you don't like the extra space between the \"]\" end bracket and the username just use this very slightly modified regex:\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND=\"echo -n \\[\\$(date +%H:%M:%S)\\]\\\\\"\n\nUse this if you're directly editing the file.\n\nA: The easiest syntax to show a timestamp in a command prompt would probably be:\n    PS1='\\D{%F} \\t $...'\n\nwhere\n\\D{format} is date formatted (see man bash, PROMPTING section) as\n%F full date; same as %Y-%m-%d (see man date, FORMAT section), and\n\\t is the current time in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format (see man bash, PROMPTING section)\nnano ~/.bashrc\n\nmake changes to PS1 variables as shown above\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\n\nA: My solution was to use http://bashrcgenerator.com/ to generate this PS1 line to put in .bashrc:\nexport PS1=\"\\t [\\u@\\h \\W]\\\\$ \\[$(tput sgr0)\\]\"\n\nWhich will look like\n13:05:54 [chad@work-laptop:~/Downloads]$ ls -al\n\nUsing PROMPT_COMMAND messes up the history for me. When a longer line comes up while cycling through the history, it cuts off the end of the prompt by the same number of characters as the timestamp that was added to the front. e.g. \n13:14:38 [chad@work-laptop:~/Doexport PROMPT_COMMAND=\"echo -n \\[\\$(date +%H:%M:%S)\\\\] \"\n\nAnd this line can't be edited because it does not display the characters in the right place, as in you aren't typing where it looks like you're typing.\nI'm guessing it could be done with PROMPT_COMMAND, maybe by using that [$(tput sgr0)] part, but PS1 works.\n\nA: export PROMPT_COMMAND=date\n\nprints the date before issuing each prompt.\n\nA: Open your .bashrc via\nvim ~/.bashrc\n\nand then add in the following to .bashrc:\n#PS1=\"[\\A \\u@\\h \\W\\a]$\" \n\nwhere \\A is for time (\\W for only end of path, remove if you want the entire current working directory path).\nThen type \nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nYou will see something like this:\n[16:04 trwood@cobalt04 ~/MCEq_dev]$\n\n\nA: Instead of adding the date to the prompt itself, you could add the date just before your prompt by placing the following line at the top of your .bashrc. For it work you will also need to install cowsay. It's a fun way of displaying the date while keeping a short prompt: \ncowsay \"Welcome $USER! It's now $(date '+%A %B %d %Y %r')\"\n\nIn its current form it will work on anyone's system without amendment as it reads the $USER and the date variable from the current environment.\n\n\nA: Add this line to the ~/.bashrc file:\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND=\"echo -n \\[\\$(date +%H:%M:%S)\\]\\ \"\n\nSo the output will be something like:\n[07:00:31] user@name:~$\n\n\nA: export PROMPT_COMMAND=\"echo -n \\[\\$(date +%F-%T)\\]\\ \"\nexport HISTTIMEFORMAT=\"%F-%T \"\n\nat least looks handy for me.\n\nA: Just to add to @devav2 's answer:\nAn easier-to-read echo command for newbies would be:\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -n \"$(date +%H:%M:%S) \"'\nInstead of\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND=\"echo -n \\[\\$(date +%H:%M:%S)\\]\\ \"\nBecasue the echo command is not meant to be evaluated at the time of the export, it makes more sense to use single quotes for literal quoting rather than double quotes. Using single quotes to quote the entire command then allows you to use double quotes to quote the arguement to the echo command, eliminating the need to escape special characters like , [ and $\n\nA: I think the correct way to proceed is to locate in $HOME/.bashrc the codes that sets PS1, comment them and add the personal ones. This is my block for example:\nPS1_DATE=\"\\D{%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S}\"\n\nif [ \"$color_prompt\" = yes ]; then\n    PS1=\"[$PS1_DATE \\[\\e]0; \\w\\a\\]${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\[\\033[00m\\]\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\w \\[\\033[00m\\]\\$] \"\n    #PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\u@\\h\\[\\033[00m\\]:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\w\\[\\033[00m\\]\\$ '\nelse\n    PS1='[$PS1_DATE ${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\w \\$] '\n    #PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h:\\w\\$ '\nfi\n\nOutput:\n[2019-06-18 15:54:29 ~/Desktop $] echo \"It's late!\"\n\n\nA: My time is similar to the cowsay answer above. You need to put now your ~/.bashrc but you can also call it from the terminal by typing now.\nHere's a screenshot:\n\nThe bash code is posted in this very detailed answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Terminal splash screen with Weather, Calendar, Time & Sysinfo?\n", "Q: multiple preinstalled programs with similar jobs I have unity, gnome-shell and xubuntu on my laptop. They all have their favorite preinstalled programs it seems. Do I really need three text editors for example? Could I remove two and just have the other desktops use the one I keep? It seems as though I could get rid of all video playback programs as well and just use vlc for example. Am I going to mess something up? I am new to all this. \n\nA: I would be careful with removing seemingly superfluous programs. Other packages, even unrelated ones coming with the DE might depend on them. On LXDE for instance you can't remove lxterminal (≙ gnome-terminal) or leafpad (≙ gedit) without deleting essential packages such as lxrandr, lxinput and other ones.\nSave for these dependency issues there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to remove  duplicate applications. Just make sure that you can configure the DE to use a replacement of your choice, e.g. gnome-calculator instead of galculator.\nIf it's not the wasted disk space that bothers you, but clutter in the respective DEs menus, you can always add the OnlyShowIn= parameter to the application launchers in question.

Add -H to your rsync options to avoid that.\n\n*Your command adresses each subdirectory of / separately, and syncs it to the target directory, effectively joining a system that may reside on separate partitions into one big partition. (if your /home is on a separate partitoin by design, on your backup it will be stuffed into the same partition as everything else. In any case, should you ever need to boot from that backup, you will need to adapt the fstab on the copy.  \n\n*Possible recursion: If your exclude pattern fails, you will sync /media/mirror into itself, creating /media/mirror/media/mirror/.. \n\n*You probably want to replicate the original filesysten 1:1 in the copy. Since according to your call it's also your currently active root file system, it will be very much alive and being written to. Preferably you would boot from another filesystem (be it from net, alternate root partition, live-CD, USB stick, whatever works for you) in order to replicate a quiescent file system.\n\n\nA: It seems to be a bug according to https://bugzilla.samba.org/\nsee this \n\nA: I was having similar issues:\nTo solve I added to rsync \n--exclude-from \"/home/<username>/exclude.txt\"\n\nWhere exclude.txt was : \n /dev/*\n /proc/*\n /sys/*\n /tmp/*\n /run/*\n /mnt/*\n /media/*\n /lost+found\n /home/*/.thumbnails/*\n /home/*/.cache/mozilla/*\n /home/*/.cache/chromium/*\n /home/*/.local/share/Trash/*\n\nFinally before the actual backup I removed from the destination all the directories such as /proc that were created before I properly set up the exclusion rule.\nAlso the official guide was quite helpful.\n", "Q: Writable permission is not writable I am running Ubuntu 12.04 x64 server on ext4 partition.\nI set a directory's permission to '766' as below.\nsudo chmod 766 /archive\ndrwxrw-rw-  3 root root  4096 Sep 27 10:50 archive/ \nBut, when I tried to create new file through vi editor, permission error has occured.\nvi /archive/test.txt \n    -------- > \"/archive/test.txt\" [Permission Denied]  \n\nI thought I had \"write\" permission.\nCould anyone help me what is the problem?\n\nA: I guess that the directory /archive already contains a file called test.txt, maybe created previously by the root.

I recently installed a 2nd hdd into my ubuntu box. Have one of about 160g which runs ubuntu 12.04. And the new hdd was 1 tb, used for holding videos. I had set up 2nd drive as ext3 I believe. And set up folders on it to hold the videos. Worked great.\nAlso thought I had set it up for auto mount. I was able to read and write on it. Etc. Computer froze, so had to reboot it. When I did, system would not reboot: hung on the Ubuntu screen with 5 dots. I hit a few buttons and the command screen showed up, indicating that my 2nd hdd would not mount. Stopped up whole system. Tried rebooting, no go.\nHad to reinstall ubuntu on the 1st hdd. Did not apparently touch the 2nd one. Well, when I got it up and running, my 2nd hdd mounted automatically (yeah!), but now I cannot find my videos I already had on it. I had not put any more than about 30g of videos on it, but now when I read its Properties, it says I'm using about 50g. So, I'm wondering if somewhere in that, buried, are my 17 videos.\nAny help in recovering this? Thanks!\n\nA: There are some paid recovery tools such as R-studio for linux would be perfect.

More information can be found on wiki.\nWhat it basically do is to let you use one physical core as two logical ones. For example if you have a quad-core processor with hyper-threading technology it will let you to have 8 logical cores from 4 physical cores.\nIntel did a nice job using this technology by allowing you to have double the threads that you would have without hyper-threading.\nAlso, seems that only Intel chips seems to use such technology, other chip manufactures focus on creating more physical cores instead of hyper-threading. My guess is that physical cores > logical cores :)\n\nA: It is because of hyper-threading, where each core can (put simply) execute two threads simultaneously Which is why you see 4 threads, 4 threads == 4 'cpus'.\nQuoted from wikipedia:\n\nHyper-threading works by duplicating certain sections of the processor—those that store the architectural state—but not duplicating the main execution resources. This allows a hyper-threading processor to appear as two \"logical\" processors to the host operating system, allowing the operating system to schedule two threads or processes simultaneously.\n\n", "Q: Fallback Mode on Intel HD 4000 on Ubuntu 12.04.1?

It's for 12.04 but i think it will work fine for 12.10\n\nA: The GNOME desktop used to use the package gnome-screensaver for screensavers.\nThe thing is, gnome-screensaver became not just responsible for screensavers, but also for the system lock screen.\nIn a possibly surprising twist of fate, it has now removed the screensavers!  So despite it still being called gnome-screensaver, all it does now is suspect/wake the screen and act as a lock screen.\nWhy remove screensavers?\n\n\n*\n\n*They work contrary to modern power saving, where the approach is to put the screen into sleep mode and let the CPU/GPU idle.  A screensaver keeps the screen on and keep the CPU and/or GPU doing a small amount of work.  This will use more power, generate more heat, etc.  This is particular important on battery powered devices like laptops and tablets.\n\n*They don't really do all that much to save screens anymore.  Modern screens aren't really as susceptible to screen burn-in as older screens.  A lot of us now use screens at work for 8+ hours a day with taskbars, etc constantly visible, and yet it doesn't really cause much noticeable burn-in.\nThat said, some people still want screensavers for the same reason they've always wanted them - they look pretty (and they use a desktop or something where they don't care about energy use).\nThankfully the xscreensaver package still contains screensavers, though with some differences.  If you also install xscreensaver-data-extra and xscreensaver-gl-extra then you'll get even more screensaver options.  Once installed you can configure screensavers from the GUI (search for \"screensaver\").\nNote however: this will effectively disable gnome-screensaver, so you will no longer see gnome-screensaver's lock screen but xscreensaver's lock screen, which will look and behave differently.\n", "Q: Rhythmbox can't organize artist/title from file names I can't seem to get rhythmbox to detect artist, title, and album names from my file system.

But still having the same problem.\nHow to fix this issue?\n\nA: As an alternate answer, you could possibly use the built-in graphic repository manager.\nDo this by:\n Firstly, Open the Ubuntu Software Center: \nDo this by clicking on the link on your Launcher.  \nOr, if you have removed it from the launcher, you can search for it via the dash.\n\n\n\nSecondly,Open the Software Sources menu:\nDo this by locating the Edit menu and selecting 'Software Sources...'\nthen once the window has opened, move to the 'Other Sources' tab. \n\nLastly,Add the PPA via the window:\nBelow your list of current PPAs, click the 'Add' button.\n\nAnd when the window appears, enter the PPA address, which in your case is deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-toolchain-r/test/ubuntu precise main and deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-toolchain-r/test/ubuntu precise main \n\n\nAnd click 'Add Source'.\n\n\nYou may also need to provide authentication by entering your user password.\n\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nEven if this doesn't work, the Software Centre may come up with a window with an error message, and most likely how to fix it.

When I use command:\ngcc --version\n\nIt tells me it is 4.6.3 to be exact.\nI have no idea of how to launch the 4.7 compiler. In fact, I wouldn't mind erasing the former version and stay with 4.7 only (I guess that wouldn't be a problem).\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: Use update-alternatives (from CLI) or galternatives (from GUI) to set the default for gcc.   \nIf you don't have them, install with: sudo apt-get install galternatives.\nI would use the GUI version, it is more simple for a beginner.\nFrom CLI:\n\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /path/to/newer/gcc 40\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /path/to/older/gcc 30\nsudo update-alternatives --config gcc\n\n\nA: There are mechanisms in place to switch the version of gcc (and other tools) you get with using their name (gcc), See the update-alternatives man page, but there are recommendations that changing the system-wide gcc default is a bad thing. The existing programs have been successfully compiled and tested with the default compiler, and while it would be hoped that a newer compiler would still produce acceptable results, there are no guarantees.  Things that are deprecated in a compiler may be removed in the next version. New bugs may be introduced.  There's a reason a distribution uses a particular compiler version -- the programs they provide all work with that version, and some probably do not work with a later version.\n  For you own use, choose the compiler you want (gcc-8 in the below example) without altering the system-wide defaults by adding the gcc ( and ar, nm, ranlib) links to the desired version into your own ~/bin directory:  \nln -s ~/bin/gcc -> /usr/bin/gcc-8  \nln -s ~/bin/ar -> /usr/bin/gcc-ar-8  \nln -s ~/bin/ranlib -> /usr/bin/gcc-ranlib-8  \nln -s ~/bin/nm -> /usr/bin/gcc-nm-8  \n\nIf your ~/bin directory does not exist, make it:  \nmkdir ~/bin\n\nYour ~/bin will be picked up and added to the beginning of your PATH environment variable, so that the gcc command will be found there and used, instead of the system default in /usr/bin.  \nThis technique may be applied to applications which need specific compiler versions (CUDA for example).  Links to the selected compiler version may be put into the application bin directory, and that location may be added first to your PATH (in .profile for bash shell users).  \n", "Q: Remove KILE and other KDE dependencies I am using Ubuntu 12.04. I found my root directory full so thought to free up some space.\nIn this regard I opt for removing KILE. But the base package KILE is only 4.4 MB.\nHow can I remove its related libraries (nearly 300MB) which were installed with it?\n\nA: Try \nsudo apt-get remove --purge kile\n\nand\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge\n\nThis should remove any leftover KDE dependencies (as long as there is no other KDE program installed, that depends on them)\n\nA: You can list the kde-depencies with dpkg -l | grep kde. Output is something like this:\nrc  kdebase-bin              4:4.6.5-0ubuntu1    core binaries for the KDE base applications\nrc  kdebase-workspace-bin    4:4.6.5-0ubuntu1    core binaries for the KDE Plasma Workspace\n\nNow you can manually remove all unwanted kde packages, but be careful if there are packages that not belongs to kde. If you use other kde applications, then those applications need kde-depencies.\nSee: What do the various dpkg flags like 'ii' 'rc' mean?\n\nA: To remove KDE libraries, use command below. Open terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) then type:\nsudo apt-get remove kubuntu-desktop --purge  \nsudo apt-get remove kde-base --purge\n\nThen restart your computer.

This is using both WiFi and a HomePlug connection.\nUntil I started transferring files sized in gigs, this was (of course) never a problem!\n\nA: Samba can be slow in some scenarios, in my experience. Most likely due to bugs that only show themselves in some cases. I dropped it for NFS (which won't be an option for you) but you can look at things like HTTP, FTP or even bittorrent.

Possibly, this occurs occasionally on applications. If someone finds one, please leave a comment.\n\nScript to remember and restore the window arrangement and their corresponding applications.\nThe script below can be run with two options. Let's say you have the window arrangement as below:\n\nTo read (remember) the current window arrangement and their applications, run the script with the option:\n<script> -read\n\nThen close all windows:\n\nThen to set up the last remembered window arrangement, run it with the option:\n<script> -run\n\nand the last remembered window arrangement will be restored:\n\nThis will also work after a restart.\nPutting the two commands under two different shortcut keys, you can \"record\" your window arrangement, shutdown your computer and recall the same window arrangement after (e.g.) a restart.\nWhat the script does, and what it does not\nRun with the option -read\n\n\n*\n\n*The script uses wmctrl to list all windows, across all workspaces, their positions, their sizes, the applications they belong to\n\n*The script then \"converts\" the window positions from relative (to the current workspace, as in the output of wmctrl) to absolute positions, on your spanning workspaces. Therefore it does not matter if the windows you want to remember are on only one workspace or spread over different workspaces.\n\n*The script then \"remembers\" the current window arrangement, writing it into an invisible file in your home directory.\n\n\nRun with the option -run\n\n\n*\n\n*the script reads the last remembered window arrangement; it starts the corresponding applications, moves the windows to the remembered positions, also with the help of wmctrl\nThe script does not remember the files that possibly might be opened in the windows, nor (e.g.) the websites that were opened in a browser window.\nIssues\nThe combination of wmctrl and Unity has some bugs, a few examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*the window coordinates, as read by wmctrl differs slightly form the command to position the windows, as mentioned here. Therefore the recalled window positions might slightly differ from the original position.\n\n*The wmctrl commands works a bit unpredictable if the edge of the window is very near either the Unity Launcher or the panel.\n\n*The \"remembered\" windows need to be completely inside a workspace borders for the wmctrl placement command to work well.\n\n\nSome applications open new windows by default in the same window in a new tab (like gedit).

After switching sound cards, I had [much better] sound but my sound output choices (System Settings : Sound) disappeared.  I needed that to switch to S/PDIF output.  After much monkeying around without success, including all of the above suggestions and more, nothing worked.  For no particular reason, I logged into a 2nd user account, where I found the new output choices did indeed appear.  I'd discovered that the settings were user-account specific.  So, while I was there, I looked in .config and found a pulse directory.  I copied that directory to the network, then switched back to the primary account.  I found my .config/pulse directory (which had several additional files in it) and renamed it to pulse.orig in preparation to copy/paste the 2nd account's pulse directory from the network.  But even as I switched directories to copy, then back to my .config directory, a new pulse directory had appeared, with the proper number of files in it.  I checked System Settings / Sound, and my new sound devices were available for selection.\nLong Story Short: Maybe find your [/home/userid]/.config/pulse directory and rename it (so a new default copy can appear). \n\nA: Try these commands:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge alsa-base  \nsudo apt-get remove --purge pulseaudio  \nsudo apt-get install alsa-base  \nsudo apt-get install pulseaudio  \nsudo alsa force-reload\n\n\nA: In my case I had a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04, so reinstalling pulseaudio and alsa would be pointless.\nHowever, running sudo alsa force-reload as in user91632's anwser did the trick.\n\nA: Open the terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T and install pulseaudio with this command:\nsudo apt-get install pulseaudio gstreamer0.10-pulseaudio indicator-sound\n\n\nA: I had the exactly same problem which occurred after ubuntu upgrade. The following command fixed that for me (adding your system user account into group audio):\nsudo adduser my-login-name audio\n\n\nA: In my case I kept the home directory from the previous install so during the install/transfer some of the folders were not owned by me pulse config folder was one of them.  \nWhat I had to do was chown -R my_user_name:my_user_name /home/my_user_name/*.\nTo check if this is your issues just check the owner of /home/your_user_name/.config/pulse.\nOnce I fixed that the applet started working as expected.\nI should say this was on Ubuntu 14.04x64\n", "Q: Correct way to create a Desktop Entry file of Directory type?

I read that you need a config file on ubuntu, but I don't have a config file.\nHow can I connect to my openvpn server using credentials?\n\nA: Yes it's possible.\nTo do this, you have already an OpenVPN server installed, and the user created in the server.\nThe easiest openvpn client is network-manager.

Not that I mind or anything, just out of curiosity. But I noticed today that the Software Center in Ubuntu is actually an upstream package?. \nIn the description it says \n\nTo install or remove software using USC, you need administrator access on the computer. \n\nSo, it is referred to Ubuntu Software Center and the screen-shot on the right is taken from Ubuntu.\nSo, why would it be available in the Debian repositories, what is its use there?\n\nA: As you may know, Ubuntu is built upon Debian. LTS releases are based on Debian Testing, while regular releases are based on Debian Unstable. Ubuntu packages are therefore almost always compatible with the respective Debian release.\nUbuntu Software Center is a nice front-end for browsing and searching for packages, and it uses standard .deb downloads/installation on the back-end. It works just as well on Debian as on Ubuntu, and is there as an alternative to Synaptic, etc. for Debian users.\n\nNote: technically, the Debian USC is not an upstream package. In fact, as the filename software-center_5.1.2debian2.1 suggests, it's the Ubuntu (Launchpad) package which is the upstream here!\n\n\nA: The software center is actually available in Debian. In fact, I used it yesterday on Debian Squeeze. The package for debian can be viewed here:\nhttp://packages.debian.org/sid/software-center\n\nA: That's normal, usc is opensource and build as .deb to be installed on all debian distributions (ubuntu is one of them)\n", "Q: Xournal bug while attempt to open file \"could not open background\" I use Xournal 0.4.5 for work with pdfs: adding comments, ticking, etc.\nI save files as pdf.xoj - standard Xournal format. There was no any problems with opening it and editing again.\nMy problem is that, yesterday I save one .xoj file [everything as usual] and now I can't open it because there is only message \"Could not open background\". I can open others files, but in the case of this one there is no such possibility.\nI am trying with preferences editing, ticking and unticking various options but there is still the same.\nMaybe anyone have any idea how to fix it?\n\nA: The \"background\" is your original PDF file that you have used to annotate with Xournal. The xoj file does not contain that file, but merely your \"additions\" (notes, handwritten text etc.). Therefore, to open it again properly, you need to have the original PDF file.\nYou can take a look at the xoj files -- they are plain XML, compressed with gzip:\n cp file.pdf.xoj file.xml.gz\n gunzip file.xml.gz\n gedit file.xml\n\nThere will be a line containing something like\n <background type=\"pdf\" domain=\"absolute\" filename=\"/home/username/xxxxx.pdf\" pageno=\"1\" />\n\nMake sure that this file is present at the location in the above tag. You can also modify the xoj to point it to new location, save it and do\n gzip file.xml\n mv file.xml.gz newfile.pdf.xoj\n\n", "Q: How Can I Publish Addons on the Ubuntu Software Center I have a commercial app, and according to the FAQ on http://developer.ubuntu.com, there is a way for me to publish add-ons as seen with many open source applications such as Thunderbird mail.\nI am wondering how that is done. If anyone could point me in the right direction I'd appreciate it.\n\nA: The \"best\" way would be for the original app to look for \"add-on\" data in a predetermined spot.  \nThen when you make an addon 'myapp-contentpack-a' it should have a dependency on 'myapp'.  \nFinally, when you start myapp it should just work.\nExample:\nFlashcardEngine installs to /opt/com.aking1012/flashcardsEngine with a subdirectory ./data/decks.  A content pack would add decks in the ./data/decks directory.  \nA more complex example is if you wanted to add a feature.  I'ld put that in the base package, but not have it \"activate\" unless another package is present.  \nNot the official answer, but it IS how I would do it\n", "Q: Skype crashes when selecting photo for avatar I have a problem with Skype.

This is a follow-up to this question.\nI have the possibility to use rsync, ftp, cifs or ftp for my remote backups, provided I can get them to work with the duplicity command line, of course.\nWill duplicity leverage any advantages of the protocol in use?\nIf so, which will perform best on big sets (~100 GB) of data?\n\nA: referred to the following test rsync is the best \n\nA: rsync is generally perceived to be the fastest of these options, the main reason being that the data is split in chunks and only the new chunks are actually transferred (for example, in a large file of which only small fragment has been modified).\nRsync can also compress data on the fly (just like scp does it); moreover, rsync uses ssh behind the scenes (yes, it can also use ftp: for example, mount the ftp server locally over fuse and use rsync to synchronize the data), so with the exception of compression and the above algorithm, rsync will not be greatly faster than scp.\nUnfortunately, that all depends on how duplicity is using rsync. Duplicity files are compressed, so compression will not change much.\nIf I were you, I would test the different combinations myself before deciding upon one of them.\n", "Q: More helpful network error In Ubuntu, when my network fails to connect, it just says \"network not connected / disconnected\", without providing any helpful error message. On the contrary, Windows gives an error code plus a one or two line spanning error message that pinpoints what error occurred during a connection attempt.

Then when you login to another device that is in sync with Ubuntu One, the same information is passed on to that device and the folder is deleted as well.\nHowever, when you format a partition containing Ubuntu One installation and your synced data from a LiveCD or USB, the Ubuntu One client software gets erased and cannot run. Thus, the server doesn't know what has happened to your folder and won't delete it until you reinstall Ubuntu and Ubuntu One and login to your Ubuntu One account. At that point the server may treat your newly formatted computer to be a new computer and Ubuntu One will download all the synced folders and files.\n\nA: If you delete the folder while ubuntu one process is running, then yes, the data will be deleted.\nBut if you delete the folder from outside of UBUNTU  then the data will not be deleted. Such as from another Linux system.  \nThis is because when you delete a folder from Ubuntu (while the process which is communicating with the server is running) a message passed from your system to the server telling it to delete the folder there. But this isn't the case while formatting. Because you can't format a running system's partition and doing that from outside  has the absence of the ubuntu one process\n\nA: you can get your folder from ubuntuone online again\n\nA: UbuntuOne is a cloud service. Changes done within the folder will affect the computers associated with your account. The way this works is that when files within your folder are deleted, added, changed locally, they are uploaded to the cloud server and then redownloaded/updated on your other computers when possible.\nFurther explanation and possibly off-topic, I need confirmation on this statement, but I'd think this is fact: Deleting files INSIDE UbuntuOne updates your cloud filesystem, deleting the entire UbuntuOne folder (in /home/accountname) will not delete the filesystem (when the OS and background service is running). Firstly when formatting, the OS and background service is not running, which means no deleting files. \n", "Q: Symbolic Link: No such file or directory I created a symbolic Link from a File at \"/opt/bladir/bla\" to \"bla\". So \"bla\" is now in \"/usr/bin/bla\". But if I want to call \"bla\" at terminal, there comes the no such file or directory error. I looked up at \"/usr/bin/bla\" and the file is linking correctly at \"/opt/bladir/bla\".\nWhat can be the error?\nP.S. here is my terminal \"entry\":  sudo ln -s /opt/bladir/bla bla\nThanks!\n€: Problem solved. According to the Feature List, 12.04 should have Multiarch support... 'should'. I got the ia32-libs from synaptic and now the program wents just fine. As it looks, my symbolic links where correct.\nThank you for all the answers!\n\nA: EDIT: the solution below does not work. It is apparent that the symbolic link is broken, because file -L cannot open the symbolic link /usr/bin/bla. In this case, do the following:\nsudo ln -sf /opt/bladir/bla /usr/bin/bla\n\nusing full paths (-f is to force overwriting the previous symbolic link, if there is one).\nHm. I think that the program \"bla\" may be looking for things that are installed in /opt/bladir and cannot find them. For example, it can be a shell script wrapper around a Java executable, with path relative to current directory: but your current directory is /usr/bin/, and not /opt/bladir/. \nIf the following works\nfile -L /usr/bin/bla\n\n...then it is definitely not a problem with your symbolic link.\nCheck whether \"bla\" is a shell script that you can modify, take a look inside -- maybe you will find the problem. Possibly, adding /opt/bladir to your PATH would be a better solution.\n\nA: Seems that you had a different problem than me since you said,\n\"I looked up at \"/usr/bin/bla\" and the file is linking correctly at \"/opt/bladir/bla\".\"\nHowever, for others coming here, I wanted to put ~/julia-1.5.3/bin/julia on PATH via symlink, so I basically did cd /home/username/ and then sudo ln -s julia-1.5.3/bin/julia /usr/local/bin/julia. When I typed julia, it said bash: /usr/local/bin/julia: No such file or directory. When I did ls -all /usr/local/bin, I found the issue; it was linking to the dangling relative directory: julia -> julia-1.5.3/bin/julia.\nAnyway, I just had to redo it with the absolute path, and it worked:\nsudo ln -sf /home/username/julia-1.5.3/bin/julia /usr/local/bin/julia\n\nA: Often this type of error message is shown, if you don't have execution bit enabled. Check whether the main file as well as the link is given execution permission.\nI'm suspecting your /opt may be mounted from a separate partition and it isn't mounted with exec mount option\n\nA: This isn't the case for this question, but another situation where this error could happen is if one of the directories has a space in it and isn't surrounded in quotation marks. for example:\nln -s my home/username/myfolder/a file.txt file.txt\n\nwill cause an error. but\nln -s my \"home/username/myfolder/a file.txt\" file.txt\n\nwill not.\n", "Q: How do I get an Airtel Dongle working?

I'm using an old laptop, so NANO it's fast, lightweight, and saves me battery. The only problem is the fact i can't use Special Characters and accents.\nFor example, as i am from Brazil, i need to use some everyday-accentued-portuguese-characters: à, á, Ç, ç, ó, ô, õ, ã, â...\nIs there any way i can enable it?\nTo make õ be printed if '~' + 'o' is pressed, or ü if '¨' + 'u' is pressed...\nThank you :)\n\nA: Check you keyboard layout, maybe with the help of right-alt you have the characters.\nHere are tips from about.com: http://spanish.about.com/od/writtenspanish/a/dia_ubuntu.htm\n\nA: If you're just using a terminal emulator (terminator/gnome-terminal/etc) you can still use the Compose-Key combinations.\nAnd/or if you're using a TTY and these keys are keys you have on your keyboard, you might just need to set your keyboard up correctly:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration\n\n\nA: While compose keys should work (I understand they're not working for you), there are other ways.\nYou can try pressing shift+ctrl+u and then typing the code for the Unicode character.\nAlternatively, you may be interested to know that there are some special combining Unicode characters that act kind of like compose keys in and of themselves (with no special software requirement, other than Unicode). So, if Unicode works on your version of Nano, all you have to do is insert one of those characters in Nano, and use it according to your desires.\nSo, for example, you might go in your ~/.nanorc file and create keybindings for those special characters.\nFor example, if you put this line in your .nanorc file, you can type a vowel and then press F2 to put a macron on the vowel (I tested it on Nano 6.4 and it worked):\nbind F2 \"̄\"\n\nHere are the codes for some of the combining characters that you probably want (look them up on a character map or make them with shift+ctrl+u and typing the code):\n\n*\n\n*U+0300 (Grave accent)\n\n*U+0301 (Accute accent)\n\n*U+0302 (circumflex accent)\n\n*U+0303 (tilde)\n\n*U+0304 (macron)\n\n*U+0305 (overline)\n\n*U+306 (breve)\n\n*U+0307 (puts a dot on top)\n\n*U+0308 (diaresis/umlaut)\n\n*U+030A (ring above)\n\n*U+3011 (inverted breve)\n\nYou might not be satisfied with F2, so you should probably look at how to rebind keys yourself in the Nano documentation:\nhttps://nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nanorc.5.html#REBINDING%20KEYS\nI recommend updating your Nano version, if it's old. To do that, you can compile it yourself pretty easily. Enable the source code repositories for Ubuntu in your software settings. Then type sudo apt build-dep nano. Then download the Nano source code from nano-editor.org. Then it should compile without problems, according to the instructions in the readme found in the source code.\n", "Q: Which Ubuntu to use for Dell N5110 I have Dell N5110 laptop.

There was a platform to simulate robot, one of this mystic platforms for real geeks. The platform worked very well on linux and nearly not at all on windows. \nI switched to ubuntu and started to 'fight' with it, but.. I found that you can do a lot of stuff and have a lot of access to knowledge if you in Linux/openSource. After years of asking myself, why I am doing all this difficult way, I can say that this way can have you mastering of your computer's interaction.\nSo to make the answer:\nYou should use ubuntu because one day you will know or can do something, what your colleagues form window's world will have no idea about. And this will give you huge advantage.\nApart of this you can use ubuntu for everything the same you using windows\n\nA: Well You should use Ubuntu to get a deeper knowledge of the underlying system which providing the environment for you to use various softwares and programs.\nBut, here is my suggestions: If you must professionally use Adobe tools for graphics design, I would not recommend Ubuntu for this. Because despite it's awesomeness gimp still isn't as good as Adobe tools. Also some working environments strictly require the work from an Adobe tool.\nBut, if you are a programmer, not matter what type of program it is, such as developing web applications, softwares for PCs, Ubuntu is the perfect choice for you. Historically Linux has very solid background on this side.\nHere is my recommendation, Use Ubuntu as a dual boot system.  When you have to work for graphics, use the Windows system. When doing developing softs, switch to Ubuntu. Also use it for other activities as this will greatly enrich your knowledge about the operation of Operating systems.\n\nA: *\n\n*install ubuntu from wubi alongside windows 7\n\n*use ubuntu for Security and virus-free environment, Multimedia, desktop, free, more than 40,000 free app in software center ...\n\nA: This is actually a bit of an off-topic question here (see the FAQ), but here I try.\nFor website development, Ubuntu might be great -- when it comes to the technicalities behind the scenes. Web servers, scripting languages. CGIs, databases, code editors -- Ubuntu is a developers dream come true, everything is comparatively easy to install and manage. Learning a computer language is much easier if installing the environment is simple, and if it is open source (so you can look inside of the mechanics to see how things actually work) and well documented.\nWhen it comes to graphic design -- it sucks. Yes, you have nice amateurish tools like gimp for photo editing and inkscape for vector graphics, but that is not the same level with what the professionals use. Certainly not on par with the top shelf Adobe products (monitor color calibration profiles anyone?).\n", "Q: Howto have thunderbird/lightning open ics files Some websites offer .ics files, calendar files.

There are discussions on minimize button icon recently: since the launcher is on the left where minimized window goes, should Ubuntu minimize button be vertical? There are many different suggestions, such as a dot, an arrow, etc., but I think a single left-pointing arrow is the best.\nWhether this is right or not, how to change minimize button to a left-pointing arrow?\n\nA: Well, window button icons are defined through PNGs in unity and metacity-1 folders in every theme, so replacing those PNGs easily results in changing the icons. If you are interested, I'll share my experience here.\nYou can find the default ones for Ambiance theme here:\n/usr/share/themes/Ambiance/unity/\n/usr/share/themes/Ambiance/metacity-1/\nSince there are different modes for a window button, such as prelight, pressed, focused, you should have different shades for a single button; for example there are 7 PNGs in unity folder for different modes of minimize button.

After you will extract the file, put two folders Ambiance and Radiance (or each you want) under the path: \n~/.themes/ \n– if it doesn't exist, simply create it (\"~\" stands for your home folder as you may know).\nThis alternative doesn't need a root access.\nSVG’s for Unity 7 (14.04)\nSupporting displays with higher resolutions, Unity 7 have SVG’s for window buttons.

I am using Ubuntu 12.04.\nWhile seeing around here i have gone through this  But it didnt seems to be work with me . Here is my trail .\nraja@badfox:~$ mplayer www.live365.com\nMPlayer svn r34540 (Ubuntu), built with gcc-4.6 (C) 2000-2012 MPlayer Team\nmplayer: could not connect to socket\nmplayer: No such file or directory\nFailed to open LIRC support. You will not be able to use your remote control.\n\nPlaying www.live365.com.\nFile not found: 'www.live365.com'\nFailed to open www.live365.com.\n\n\nExiting... (End of file)\n\nIts looks like some background work needed . \n\nA: There is indeed some \"background work\" to be done.\nFirst of all, you will need to get hold of a URL that points to a real stream and not just a site that offers internet radio listening. This is probably the hardest part. You can search the station's website or google if there are any streams for that particular station. The stream URL is not the URL of a player on the station's website.\nA URL might look like this: http://bbc.co.uk/radio/listen/live/r1.asx (BBC Radio 1) or http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/listen/live/r1_aaclca.pls (BBC Radio 1, but a different URL) or http://www.ndr.de/resources/metadaten/audio/m3u/ndrloop5.m3u (N-Joy); it will (very likely) not look like www.live365.com.\nAll of the above may be played back easily using mplayer -playlist \"<your url>\", if that does not work with your stream, you can try mplayer \"<your url>\".\n\nA: You can try moc.  MOC (music on console) is a console audio player for LINUX/UNIX designed to be powerful and easy to use.\n\nA: First, if you do not include \"http://\", then mplayer will try to open a file called \"www.live365.com\".\nmplayer http://www.live365.com\n\nThis, however, will fail as well, since http://www.live365.com is not an address of a stream that mplayer could play, but of a web page. With a flash player.\nShort answer -- open the website in firefox or another browser and click on \"play\".\n\nA: mplayer\nTry this.\nmplayer http://80.237.154.83:8120\n\nThe IP-address of an online radio station can be found over at Xat radio search.\nMy result :\n\nmplayer in IPv4 networks\nIf your router only works with IPv4, you will need to add the option -prefer-ipv4.

More recent mplayer versions require this.\nmplayer -prefer-ipv4 http://80.237.154.83:8120\n\nSee below to read how to use mplayer with .m3u and .pls streams.\ncmus also opens .m3u and .pls streams\nUnlike mplayer, cmus also knows to open .m3u and .pls streams. This means less digging or \"background work\" to extract the stream URL from those files.\nFurthermore, cmus looks nice and offers several views, a file browser and many configuration settings. cmus is available from the standard Ubuntu repositories. To get up to speed with cmus, first read the tutorial by typing the following command:\n$ man cmus-tutorial\n\n\nOpen .m3u and .pls streams anyhow with mplayer\nIf you do not like cmus, or it is unavailable, mplayer can be made to do the same. For that purpose, I wrote the following mplay script:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nURL=$(grep -m 1 --null http \"$1\" |sed s/^.*http/http/ |tr -d '\\r')\nmplayer -prefer-ipv4 \"$URL\"\n\nTo navigate between directories of .m3u and .pls files, one could use the CLI file browser ranger, configured to call the above script for these file types. The struggle of setting this up pays itself back by being the fastest access method. This is what I personally use in a daily setting.\n\npyradio\nHere is a nice write-up describing pyradio\nNote that pyradio can also be installed and found as follows:\n$ pip3 install pyradio\n$ sudo find / -iname pyradio\n$ ~/.local/bin/pyradio\n\nmoc\nThen there is also moc.\nMOC (music on console) is a full-screen ncurses based console audio player.\n\nSelect a file from some directory using a menu similar to Midnight Commander, and MOC will start playing all files in this directory beginning from the chosen file. There is no need to create any playlists, even though MOC handles these as well.\nmp3blaster\nMore details about yet another CLI music player, mp3blaster can be found here\n$ sudo apt install mp3blaster\n\n\n\nA: I had the same problem.   What I've done to get access to streams via command line is use the 'view source' to get the url of the stream.\nFor example, http://www.francebleu.fr/player opens in a browser and has buttons to play and stop etc.  Then I right-click and select 'view source' and another page opens.  I searched for mp3, (or you can search for \"http://\"), somewhere in there you'll find the link that is actually being used.  In the example here, it turned out to be sort of hidden...\n{\"mp3\":\"http://mp3.live.tv-radio.com/fbidf/all/fbidfhautdebit.mp3\"}\nBut from that I got the link by removing the forward slashes. Thus finally, from the command line I execute \"mplayer http://mp3.live.tv-radio.com/fbidf/all/fbidfhautdebit.mp3\" and mplayer can process that stream.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Today I as looking for the same thing as the OP, and found an option I cannot believe is not listed here. If you're interested in a music player server which can run on the background and receive commands from any of many compatible clients, you could be interested in\nmpd\nWith an incredibly generic name, Music Player Daemon (mpd) is a server (so it runs in the background) that takes commands from client applications like the analogously named mpc. Both mpd and mpc are exclusively command line applications, but if you like a little GUI to go with your CLI, you can use clients for mpd such as Ario.\nPersonally, I host an instance of MPD on a Raspberry Pi on my LAN, I connect a speaker to it, and I can SSH into it to control my music or use a  client like Ario from my PC to control it (also remotely).\nI only discovered this today so pardon if this answer lacks depth. The Arch Wiki page I linked will do a much better job than me in answering your questions about mpd though.\n\nA: www.live365.com is not the correct address of the radio stream, it is just an website address.\nwww.live365.com doesn't provide such addresses, radios there are meant to be played in the internet browser.\nThere are different ways to get the proper radio stream address. - Some radios stations list them themselves - like FIP.\nBut once you have chosen your preferred radio you need to get its streaming address. How to do that cannot be answered but on a per-case basis. There are websites that list radio stations and provide their streaming address, sometimes as a playlist file, for example http://www.listenlive.eu/. The playlist file contains links to the actual stream.

I'd rather install those packages as part of a maintenance regiment that would also reboot the machines.\nRight now we run automatic upgrades, but the machines keep reporting a need to be rebooted.\nAny guide would be appreciated.\n\nA: The problem with pinning packages to prevent them from upgrading is that to upgrade them you need to unpin them again.\nThe file /var/run/reboot-required.pkgs contains a list of packages that trigger the request for a reboot after unattended-upgrade has run.\nInside the configuration file for unattended-upgrades in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades there is a section dedicated to preventing some packages from being upgraded automatically that looks like this\nUnattended-Upgrade::Package-Blacklist{\n    foo_package1;\n    foo_package2;\n    foo_package3;\n}\n\nEdit the list to prevent those packages from being upgraded automatically.\nI would start by blacklisting the usual suspects: kernel, libc, gcc, etc and every time you see the computer is asking for a reboot check /var/run/reboot-required.pkgs and add those packages to the unattended upgrades blacklist.\n\nA: I've only seen this happen when I update the kernel. If you can identify which packages cause a need to reboot, you can put these packages on hold. This will prevent them from being updated automatically or by a regular update command.\nThere is information about holding packages in the Ubuntu Documentation.

Often I have multiple Terminal windows, and I prefer navigating to them via keyboard. Here are the different options I have found, and the problems I have with each of them:\nAlt-Tab: Needs more key strokes to show all icons and to navigate through them.\nSuper-W: Shows all windows, but key navigation (arrow keys) doesn't work.\nIs there any upcoming resolution?\nThanks\n\nA: Pressing Alt+` (the key above tab) will switch between windows of the current application in a way similar to how Alt+Tab switches between applications.\n\nA: i would recommend to try managing workspaces edges in ubuntu tweak programm go to settings and search for it . Just manage  to show windows on mouse pointing to needed corner on your screen.In 12.10 release you can even close windows in this mode.You can also view desktop & workspaces by moving mouse to  corners \n\nA: The exact functionality you're after can be found by using the Shift Switcher, Ring Switcher or Static Application Switcher functions in CompizConfig Settings Manager (CCSM). \n(If you need install instructions for CCSM, let me know in the comments)\nShift Switcher\nUsing CCSM enable Shift Switcher under the Window Management section.\nYou will need to disable your current Alt-Tab keybinding, and rebind Alt-Tab to Initiate Key or Initiate Key (All Workspaces). \nTake care using CCSM, while Ubuntu is more stable than in the past, fiddling with the wrong settings can cause crashes.\n\nShift Switcher also comes with 2 different Shift Modes, Cover and Flip - these modes change the visualization, but the basic functionality remains.\nSetting the Initiate Key key bind brings up the switcher, and you can freely navigate between your windows with the left and right keys. To bring the selected window to focus, you must select it with the Enter key. This is different functionality to the other switchers.\nAll the settings can be altered to change the visual effects of the switcher.\nRing Switcher\nSame as above, Enable Ring Switcher in CCSM, and set the Next Window Key (All Workspaces) key bind to Alt-Tab.\nThe difference in functionality between this (and the below) switcher, and the Shift Switcher is that to navigate between windows you must hold down the Alt key for these switchers. As soon as you release the Alt key, the switcher focuses to the current window.\nYou can play with the settings through the tabs for Ring Switcher.\nStatic Application Switcher\nThis is the least graphical of the 3 switchers, it is like your old-school Alt-Tab from Windows 95 days. To get it working exactly the way you want you need to set the following key binds:\n\n\n*\n\n*Next Window - Alt-Tab\n\n*Prev Window - Shift-Alt-Tab\n\n*Next Panel - Alt-Right\n\n*Prev Panel - Alt-Left\n\n\nApplication Switcher\nThis is another switcher setting under Window Management but I didn't test it as it bugged out for me - so I'm not sure whether this is just the default switcher, or some different one.\n", "Q: How can I convert a coloured icon to a monochrome one?

Stable Ubuntu releases are supposed to change at little as possible, hence they only get critical bug and security fixes. New and potentially unstable features are limited to tesing and non-LTS releases.\n\nA: mikewhatever is right.\nHowever if the LTS warranty is not a criteria for you there is various \"backport\" repositories.\nusing those void the LTS warranty like mikewhatever pointed out.\nBackports are mainly maintained by volunteers and you can have no updates from one day to another and security is not granted.\nThe LTS is more like the Debian way : Secure and stable operating system. This means that you'll not have latest features (witch are exactly the opposite).\nbackports can easily be found for the kernel, multimedia packages, xorg, various famous programs (gimp, libreoffice, ...).\nUsing them is always at your own risks.\n", "Q: PHP may be executing as a \"privileged\" group and user, which could be a serious security vulnerability I ran some security tests on a Ubuntu 12.04 Server, and I've got these warnings :\nPHP may be executing as a \"privileged\" group, which could be a serious security vulnerability.\nPHP may be executing as a \"privileged\" user, which could be a serious security vulnerability.\n\nIn /etc/apache2/envvars, I have this:\nexport APACHE_RUN_USER=www-data\nexport APACHE_RUN_GROUP=www-data\n\nAnd all files in /var/www are having these user/group: www-data:www-data\nAm I setting this correctly? What should I do to fix this problem?\n\nA: The privileged user in this case is www-data. You see, PHP will run always with the www-data:www-data permissions, which can be detrimental if the environment is shared between many users / projects, since PHP can overwrite or modify any file that belongs to www-data, irrespective of the user who created the script.\nOf course, this is not a problem if you are the only user creating PHP scripts on your machine, is it.\nAlso, the UID / GID of www-data might be below 100; since some policies grant special privileges to users with low UIDs, that may be a reason your software is complaining.\nIf you are worried, read this.\n", "Q: Error when Installing From LiveCD - unable to find a medium containing a live file system” I have read the other post but seems like they did not help my problem...So im getting unable to find a medium containing a live file system” error when installing it gets to a certin line in the command line then errors out with that message.

I have capped data which is essentially free between midnight and 5am. As a result, I would like to set Ubuntu to automatically download updates over that time.

Can anyone tell me how to use it to schedule downloads?\nIt can install the updates at the same time as far as I'm concerned, but that's not such a big issue - I can run those at a later stage.\n\nA: Actually the documentation of cron-apt is pretty thorough. You can find the documentation and examples in /usr/share/doc/cron-apt. If you don't intent to read it, you can easily just set up a root cronjob yourself (without using cron-apt).\nYou can open the crontab of the root-user with sudo crontab -e. Now just add something like this:\n# m h  dom mon dow   command\n0   1  *   *   *     /usr/bin/apt-get update && /usr/bin/apt-get -y dist-upgrade\n\nMake sure there is an empty line at the end of the file and save it. The dist-upgrade makes sure, that upgrade go through, even packages need to be removed to install upgrades to other packages. If you don't want to risk that, leave it at upgrade. If you add the -d option to the upgrade command, packages will only be downloaded and not installed. Check out man apt-get for more options.\n", "Q: all sound missing! EDD information missing!

The web page, which is near the copy-control logo is not accessible any more.\n\nA: In my case it worked with the command line tool \"abcde\".\nIf your system starts an application (banshee) automatically if an audio cd is inserted, then you need to wait until this application opens. In my case this needs some minutes. Then close the application, this will release the dbus lock on the device. After that \"abcde\" can read the CD. \nMetadata (singer, title, ...) are added by the tool. Works nice, I am happy.\n\nA: This will not really help you by what you are doing but it still might help you in creating a copy of a copy protected music CD.\n[And just for the protocol: Everybody should have the right to create a backup copy of any CD bought. I myself do have a car CD player that \"eaty\" my CDs after a while. So if I do not have a copy - shall I always buy a new one???]\nMy solution:\nI just take the output of a sound CD and record it with audacity.

The file contents is only read from the disk if you need it: that is, if you scroll or search inside the file.\nIs there an alternative app for Linux/Ubuntu that will do the same, but from the console? Being a \"console\" app is essential, otherwise there are plenty of Total Commander alternatives that I know of having a \"View\"/F3 option.\n\nA: There is a built-in file viewer for the console called \"less\", which is an enhanced version of the older Unix/Linux viewer \"more\" (which is also available).  It is the same as the pager used for man, or the option --help.\nwith less, you can view a file one page at a time.

Fresh from terminal after installing ubuntu 12.04? From scratch without ubuntu 12.04? If that is possible. \nShould I get lxde or lubuntu? \n\nA: LXDE comes only with the essential packages needed to run that desktop environment. And even then there are still packages that are duplicates of their stock Unity counterparts.\nLubuntu on the other hand is a full-blown distribution with its own selection of default programs for different use cases. If you install this on a machine that's already running Ubuntu, you will be left with a whole lot more duplicate applications. On the flip-side, the user experience on Lubuntu will probably feel more coherent than on bare LXDE.\nYour choice.\n\nA: *\n\n*LXDE+Ubuntu = Lubuntu\n\n*XFCE+Ubuntu = Xubuntu\n\n*KDE +Ubuntu = Kubuntu\n\n*Unity+Ubuntu = Ubuntu\n\n*GNOME + Ubuntu = Ubuntu GNOME\nAll of these desktop environments are implementation of X11 specifications.\nFull fledged Linux system is a combination of different kinds of software working together.So in case of Lubuntu what you see is an amalgamation of Linux kernel+Login Manager+Light weight X11 Desktop Environment(LXDE)\nComponents that makes LXDE are Display Manager(LXDM),Window manager(Openbox),PcMan FileManager and other stuff.\nSo what you should do is download Lubuntu ISO.\n\nA: LXDE is a Desktop Environment, in other words, a collection of specific programs and tools like OpenBox window manager, Pcmanfm file browser, lxpanel, etc. You can have it anywhere (in fact, you actually do), for example, on Debian, Suse, Fedora, PCLinux, etc. \nLubuntu is a distro, in other words, a *buntu base with LXDE on top, instead of Gnome, Unity and other stuff specific to Ubuntu. (Note, LXDE on Debian is not Lubuntu).\nSince you want Lubuntu installed, there is no reason to install Ubuntu first. Download an ISO of Lubuntu, make a CD/USB, run in Live mode, and if you like it, proceed installing.\n", "Q: My minitube stopped playing, any suggestions why? My minitube program suddenly stopped playing, frozen sound and video. Any suggestions why this happened. I am using Ubuntu 11.10. I uninstalled and reinstalled minitube, but still the same.\n\nA: This is a well-known bug. A new version is on its way.\nEdit: Minitube 1.9 has already been pushed out on the webupd8 test ppa. Shouldn't been long before its available from the main webupd8.org PPA. \nRelated questions you should read before installing from a PPA:\nWhat are PPAs and how do I use them?\nAre PPA's safe to add to my system and what are some \"red flags\" to watch out for?\n", "Q: Creating flash drive from OS X broke my USB? I downloaded Ubuntu .iso file from ubuntu.com and wanted to make a bootable USB stick from my MacBook Pro, I use OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion).\nI followed instructions from here. \nWhen I did do the sudo dd if=/path/to/downloaded.img of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m command, in 88 seconds it said:\n\nThe disk you inserted was not readable by this computer.\n\nwhere I see \"Initialize...\", \"Ignore\" and \"Eject\" buttons\nand the Terminal gave me following message:\n694+1 records in\n694+1 records out\n728018944 bytes transferred in 88.467946 secs (8229183 bytes/sec)\n\nMy question is NOT how do I install Ubuntu after this, my question is how do I \"recover\" my USB stick?

I will try again one day..\nMy guess is that you should format the USB to the appropriate format using the disk utility.\n", "Q: Can't boot Windows XP after installing Ubuntu 12.04 So I installed Ubuntu 12.04 alongside Windows XP, and I played with it for a like an hour. When I wanted to go back to Windows, I chose the Windows option in the GRUB screen. It just gives a black screen and goes back to grub. I tried boot-repair as I've seen in some other post that it could resolve the problem, but it's all the same. Nothing changed. I can use Ubuntu but not Windows. Can someone please tell me how I can solve this? Thanks.\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/1231432/\n\nA: Boot from a Windows XP CD and got o recovery mode and in the command line write the command fixboot then restart\n\nA: Step 1: backup the current boot record from within Ubuntu using dd if=/dev/sda of=/ubuntu.bin bs=446 count=1. Copy ubuntu.bin to c:\\ubuntu of your Windows partition, you should be able to mount it by simply starting the file manager within Ubuntu and mounting the Windows XP partition.  You may also accomplish this by copying /boot/grub/boot.img to c:\\ubuntu\\ubuntu.bin.\nstep 2: boot from your Windows XP CD. Go to recovery mode and at the command line type fixboot then restart.\nstep 3: add and entry for Ubuntu into the boot.ini, C:\\ubuntu\\ubuntu.bin=\"Ubuntu 12.04\".  You should then be able to boot both operating systems.\n", "Q: Permission to run telnet from a webpage I'm trying to run telnet:localhost:2017 from a firefox webpage in ubuntu 10.10.  I have created the necessary file association within firefox to launch telnet, but I think I need to give apache the permissions to run that file. \nAny ideas??\n\nA: The web server does not care what the browser does with regards to handling URIs, since the web server is not involved in the handling, only with responding to HTTP or HTTPS requests. Your problem lies elsewhere.\n", "Q: Can I create a proprietary application using Qt? I am using Qt4 to build an application and for some reason I want to keep it proprietary. Qt4 is released under LGPL, does that force me to release the code to my application. I ask this question because I am finding it difficult to understand the LGPL license.\n\nA: Yes.\n\"The main difference between the GPL and the LGPL is that the latter allows the work to be linked with (in the case of a library, 'used by') a non-(L)GPLed program, regardless of whether it is free software or proprietary software.\nSource:Wikipedia\n\nA: In addition to @user64152's answer I have to add one more thing. If along with proprietary you also intend to make a commercial product and modify the Qt libraries, you have to buy the Qt Commercial License in order to be able to sell your product.\n", "Q: Script to recursively grep data from certain files in the directory I am making a simple shell script which will minimize the time I spend in searching all directories under a parent directory and grep some things inside some files. Here's my script.\n#!/bin/sh\nMainDir=/var/opt/database/1227-1239/\n\ncd \"$MainDir\"\n\nfor dir in $(ls); do\n\ngrep -i \"STAGE,te_start_seq Starting\" \"$dir\"/his_file | tail -1 >> /home/xtee/sst-logs.out\n\nif [ -f \"$dir\"/sysconfig.out];\nthen\n    grep -A 1 \"Drive Model\" \"$dir\"/sysconfig.out | tail -1 >> /home/xtee/sst-logs.out\nelse\n    grep -m 1 \"Physical memory size\" \"$dir\"/node0/setupsys.out | tail -1 >> /home/xtee/sst-logs.out\nfi\n\ndone\n\nThe script is supposed to grep the string STAGE,te_start_seq Starting under the file his_file then dump it sst-logs.out which it does. My problem though is the part in the if statement. The script should check the current directory for sysconfig.out, grep drive model and dump it to sst-logs.out if it exists, otherwise, change directory to node0 then grep physical memory size from setupsys.out and dump it to sst-logs.out. My problem is, it seems the if then else statement seems not to work as it doesn`t dump any data at all but if i execute grep manually, i do have data.\nWhat is wrong with my shell script? Is there any more efficient way in doing this?\n\nA: There is at least one syntax error; you are missing a space before the ] of the if statement. The line should be\nif [ -f \"$dir\"/sysconfig.out ] ;\n\nStrange that your script does not report that. Do you run it from cron? Before you start your script automatically, first make it sure that it works correctly. Add echo statements to debug your program:\nif [ -f \"$dir/sysconfig.out\" ] ; then\n  echo \"$dir/sysconfig.out present\"\n  echo running grep -A 1 \"Drive Model\" \"$dir\"/sysconfig.out\n  grep -A 1 \"Drive Model\" \"$dir\"/sysconfig.out | tail -1 >> /home/xtee/sst-logs.out\nelse\n  echo \"$dir/sysconfig.out absent\"\n  echo running rep -m 1 \"Physical memory size\" \"$dir\"/node0/setupsys.out\n  grep -m 1 \"Physical memory size\" \"$dir\"/node0/setupsys.out | tail -1 >> /home/xtee/sst-logs.out\nfi\n\n", "Q: Filesystem that gives an encrypted view of a directory—the inverse of EncFS Currently I'm using EncFS to encrypt my directory \"confidential\" to \".encconfidential\" and sync that encrypted directory using an online service (e.g. Dropbox, UbuntuOne etc). However my entire disk is already LUKS encrypted, so the double encryption takes a toll on performance.\nI wonder is there an \"inverted\" EncFS option? An unencrypted directory gets mounted and in the mounted directory you only see encrypted files. So I could work with the unencrypted documents while the sync tool sees and read/writes the encrypted files only.\nClarification: My primary use case is sync not backup. I want to be able to securely keep machines in sync without the double encryption penalty when operating local (I have to wait when I hit save, compared to transmission time an encrypted operation is a minimal increment in time - and it is background time, not user time)\n\nA: Now for how to do exactly what you specify:\nWhat you're asking for is a read-only filesystem view that automatically encrypts any file that is read through it:\n~/\n    confidential/\n        secret_file.txt      # Stored unencrypted\n    .enc_confidential/       # Read-only view of files in confidential/\n        secret_file.txt      # Encrypted view of corresponding file\n\nThe standard way to do this is to use FUSE (Filesystem in User-space).\nFor your use case, there already exists a FUSE filesystem that can do what you want, fuseflt. fuseflt gives a read-only view of a filesystem with arbitrary user-specified filters applied to each file that is read.\nIn your case, the filter you want is an encryption program like gpg.\nSee the documentation for how to write your config file. Basically, use flt_cmd = gpg --encrypt [... your chosen encryption settings] as the filter command.\nBe careful; if you mess up your configuration it might expose plaintext data to your Internet service. I would recommend my other answer for general use.\n\nSince you also need write support for syncing to work, it looks like you'll have to write your own FUSE filesystem. It probably won't be hard to modify the fuseflt sources to add write support; just fill in the write functions that aren't implemented. This would work the same way as the read support, calling a decryption filter instead of the encryption one.\nFor writing your FUSE filesystem, several tutorials are available. Also see the FUSE wiki for more documentation.\nOnce you do this, add your FUSE filesystem mount command to your .profile so that it mounts automatically on login.\n\nA: There actually is an Encfs \"inverted\" option. From the Encfs man page:\n   --reverse\n       Normally EncFS provides a plaintext view of data on demand.  Normally it stores enciphered data and displays plaintext data.  With --reverse it\n       takes as source plaintext data and produces enciphered data on-demand.  This can be useful for creating remote encrypted backups, where you do\n       not wish to keep the local files unencrypted.\n\n       For example, the following would create an encrypted view in /tmp/crypt-view.\n\n           encfs --reverse /home/me /tmp/crypt-view\n\n       You could then copy the /tmp/crypt-view directory in order to have a copy of the encrypted data.  You must also keep a copy of the file\n       /home/me/.encfs5 which contains the filesystem information.  Together, the two can be used to reproduce the unencrypted data:\n\n           ENCFS5_CONFIG=/home/me/.encfs5 encfs /tmp/crypt-view /tmp/plain-view\n\n       Now /tmp/plain-view contains the same data as /home/me\n\n       Note that --reverse mode only works with limited configuration options, so many settings may be disabled when used.\n\nI have not tried it for syncing, but I think it would work as long as you use the same .encfs5 config folder at the other end.\n\nA: It's possible in principle (using a FUSE filesystem), but a simpler option is to use a ready-made encrypted backup program using your online service as as the backup target.\nThere are 2 suitable backup programs I know of. Both of these also give you the complete history of your files.\nDuplicity / Deja-Dup\nDuplicity (Ubuntu package) is a backup program that efficiently writes compressed, encrypted incremental backups to a remote location. The incremental backups are space-efficient because it uses the rsync algorithm to produce binary diffs.\nYou can also use the Deja-Dup front-end, which is included by default in recent Ubuntu versions.\nDuplicity supports writing to many remote locations, or backends. In particular, Duplicity has an Ubuntu One backend. I don't think it directly supports Dropbox, but you can tell it to back up to the local directory that Dropbox syncs.\nIf you're backing up large quantities of data, Duplicity is not suitable. Due to limitations in how it stores incremental backups, it requires periodically running a full backup, which entails uploading all your data.\nObnam\nFor larger backups, look at Obnam. It stores encrypted data deduplicated in a backup repository. To use it with a remote storage service, tell Obnam to back up to a repository in a location that Dropbox/Ubuntu One will sync. Since Obnam uses a B-tree-based repository format that only needs to write new/changed data to the repository, syncing should be fast.\nThe disadvantage is that it requires storing 2 copies of your data on your hard disk (the canonical copy, and the copy in the backup repository).\nUbuntu package link. There is also a PPA.\n\nA: Another ready-made sync tool is Seafile. It is a one server multiple clients solution like dropbox. In the latest version there is an option to share encrypted folders in a way that the server won't know the key. \nSee Seafile security features\nHint: Seafile calls a shared folder a \"Library\", for better understanding of the documentation.\n", "Q: Can't run Eclipse after installing ADT Plugin So, I've installed the ADT Plugin, run a HelloWorld, restart my computer and after that the Eclipse can't run.

has appeared... if anyone knows how to solve this, I'll appreciate!\nThank you for all your answers!\nBest regards,\nAlexandre Ferreira.\n\nA: It's just move the folders with java codes on windows to another folder and then start eclipse again. Everything works fine. :)\n\nA: Follow this link to help you in your problem\n", "Q: Can not mount /dev/loop0 (/cdrom/casper/filesystem.squashfs) I downloaded 12.04.1 and md5 sum checked them and everything is good. \nMade a live usb and booted up...\nJust gets to where its about to start with the purple ubuntu loading screen then it goes back to text and gives this message:\n\nBusyBox v1.18.5 (Ubuntu 1:1.18.5-1ubuntu4) built-in shell (ash) Enter\n  'help' for a list of built-in commands.\n(initramfs) mount: mounting /dev/loop0 on ///filesystem.squashfs\n  failed: Input/output error Can not mount /dev/loop0\n  (/cdrom/casper/filesystem.squashfs) on //filesystem.squashfs\n\nThis happens in the live option, or persistent even the file checking one doesn't work\nAlso I've tried a few different F6 options to no avail.\nI used 'LiLi USB creator' and 'unetbootin' and also 'Universal USB Installer,' all with the same results. I've also tried using a VM and it showed the same. That is when I figured I had a corrupt .iso so I downloaded it again checked the MD5: e235b63c02644e219b7bf3668f479c9e. Only I'm having the same problem.\nI'm just about ready to give up on 12.04.1 and just go back to 10.04 utill the next LTS comes out.\nI've got a dell mini 10 btw.\nThanks for your time.\n\nA: Your computer may not have enough RAM to use the Desktop CD.

Copying file from other user's directory with '-p' switch should reserve the permission as per the man page. \nI am copying /etc/passwd to my home directory with -p switch but the permissions aren't preserved as follows:-\nijoin@stream:~$ ls -l /etc/passwd\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1813 Sep 25 08:58 /etc/passwd\nijoin@stream:~$ cp --preserve /etc/passwd .\nijoin@stream:~$ ls -l passwd \n-rw-r--r-- 1 ijoin ijoin 1813 Sep 25 08:58 passwd\n\nI am doing something wrong?\n\nA: You're logged in as ijohn and copying a file owned by root. cp command can not work around Linux's security machinery - your user is not allowed to create files owned by root or change ownersip of files to root. Doing so would be a security problem.\nIf you need to copy files owned by other users, do so using sudo:\nsudo cp --preserve /etc/passwd\n\nHere's a good explanation I found on linuxquestions.org:\n\nthe -p argument works for all users in the constraint of that users\n  abilities on the system. generally non-root users will be able to\n  preserve ownership of their files that they own and are owned by a\n  group that the specific non-root user belongs to. they cannot preserve\n  ownership of files owned by other users (albeit, there may be ways\n  around this depending on the suid, guid, and sticky bits). root can\n  preserve the ownership of files owned by different users, because root\n  has full system priveledges. but joe_schmoe can not preserve the\n  ownership of files owned by root or files owned by billy, etc.\n  depending on where the file will be copied to, joe_schmoe can only\n  preserve file ownership of files owned by joe_schmoe and owned by a\n  group joe_schmoe belongs to.\n\n", "Q: user config to limit application access I want to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS in a work/office environment. The requirements are:\nAs a Desktop/workstation. I need 1 admin user of type Administrator, with accessed to all apps, and the normal ability to install new apps. Followed by 1 or more standard users. Initially the standards users will/must be confined to one email application (Thunderbird) only. No Web, or anything else.\nSo the problem with unity is \"Dash Home\", by simply pressing the \"Dash Home\" button the standard user can find and run (for example) the web browser, and any other app. I give Ubuntu an A+ for easy access, but that is the problem.\nSo, I could put the Administrative user into a new group, that is allow to run apps, chown all apps to that group, chmod apps so only this group can execute them, lots of on going work to maintain. Always the possibility of missing an app or two.\nIf I could just get rid of the \"Dash Home\" button for all standard users, and remove all default apps from the launcher for each standard user.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Make a Thunderbird kiosk - use Thunderbird as the only available session type; no window manager, nothing else. Take a look at /usr/share/xsessions/. Ccreate a session file called thunderbird.desktop which contains the following:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=thunderbird\nComment=This session only allows to check your e-mail\nExec=/usr/bin/thunderbird\nIcon=\nType=Application\nX-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=gnome-session-3.0\n\nConfigure /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf respectively. Now, when the user logs in, only Thunderbird is started (check for options to start it in maximized mode). When Thunderbird finishes, the session exits.\nDon't forget to put \"exit\" in the users .profile, otherwise they will be able to change to console (ctrl-alt-f1) and log in to a text terminal.\n", "Q: How to install Trinity on 12.04?

Customize a fresh clean install of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on to my hard drive.\n2.) I have 2x120gig ssd hard drives, I want one of those hard drives to be partitioned into SDA1 where the core Ubuntu files will be located (about 10 gigs) and then SDA2 where some 12 gigs will be dedicated to swapping and the rest would utilities like video players, system tools and such\n3.)

The other partition I make /home.  you can read more about partitioning here Linux Tips\nDisk Partitioning\nWhen your installing you can use the gparted program to partition your drive the way you like.  You can do what I described or you can use the suggestion in the linux tips on Disk partitioning.  I would recommend watching what drive grub will be on it should be on the root drive.  I made the mistake of not watching and put it on the other drive and couldn't boot.  I could have fixed it I just reinstalled.  \nThe nice thing about have /home on another partition is you can installed something like kubuntu and keep /home.

[EDIT]: Actually this suggests that it is usable, marking it with a Silver rating, however I wouldn't take it's word for working professionally with it. \nIf I were in your shoes, I would keep a Windows machine, or (as @January suggested) if I couldn't spare one, I would use a  virtual machine. Please keep in mind that a virtual machine will have a great performance hit when you compare it with a physical machine, especially when workloads involve heavy GPU usage.\n[EDIT #2]: To be more accurate as why you will have a performance hit using a virtual machine, first of all you have to note that the virtual device emulating the GPU is never able to emulate the GPU on its full potential, meaning you only get a fragment of its power. Additionally, the virtual device can use only a percentage of the GPU's RAM so, this is not going to help you with applications that do heavy usage of the GPU's RAM.\n", "Q: Internet Connectivity Indicator on Unity How can I check whether my internet connection is active on Ubuntu.

Since you are running 12.04, this is presumably a GTK3 file chooser dialog.\nThe GTK3 global settings (/etc/gtk-3.0/settings.ini or $HOME/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini) should understand keys gtk-recent-files-limit and gtk-recent-files-max-age, which will allow you to empty the list (but this will only empty the list, not remove it as you ask for).\nGedit has a gsettings key org.gnome.gedit.preferences.ui max-recents but I think this only controls the number of recent files in the File menu. The gsettings schema for the GTK file dialog does not appear to contain any useful option.\nThe same issue is discussed here, which suggests recompiling GTK (note this is for GTK2 and might be a bit different for GTK3) with the behaviour disabled - I can't find any simpler solution for the moment.\n", "Q: Specify initial geometry for any window with Gnome 3 I would like to open one or more Nautilus windows from the command line or a script at certain positions on my screen/desktop while in Gnome 3.

The BIOS of my motherboard (an Asus Crosshair 990FX) is strictly UEFI -- there is no legacy support mode available.  I've been reading up on how to get Kubuntu installed in UEFI mode but no matter what I try I cannot seem to even boot into my install CD/USB key properly.\nI can get as far as the selection screen (\"Try Kubuntu\", \"Install Kubuntu\"...) but this screen starts off not appearing correctly.  If I try moving the cursor around it sometimes seems to correct itself and show me my choices.  But once I select \"Try Kubuntu\" it starts loading, the screen goes black and then proceeds to flicker -- about once every 5-10 seconds or so.  This continues indefinitely.\nI've tried this with both Kubuntu & Ubuntu installation media, even the AMD64+Mac Ubuntu variety that is supposed to be a lot more flexible w.r.t. UEFI.  The only hint I've had that the system might have booted correctly is a little drum sound that plays when booting from the Ubuntu install disk.  Well, that and the fact that when I hit my system's power button it seems to shut down correctly, even ejecting the CD at the end.\nThis might be a video driver issue; my system has two nVidia 550's, one of which is attached to my primary monitor.  (The secondary isn't hooked up yet.)  I'll keep looking over similar questions but any advice would be greatly appreciated.\nUPDATE:  I've tried booting into my 12.04 install CD twice now, each time using two different options supplied by my BIOS.  One seemed to offer the ability to boot into my CD under UEFI mode -- this didn't even produce the initial boot menu.  The other method offers the ability to boot into my CD NOT under UEFI mode.  This DOES produce the boot menu, but after this point it seems I still cannot get to a proper video mode to see what's going on.\n\nA: Just an update:  I was able to get video by supplying \"noacpi\" and a VGA mode; one of the numerous Ubuntu articles about UEFI was helpful here, though the specific paragraph about trying out various parameters seems to have been edited out.\nMy Origin system appears to use different verbiage to indicate whether to boot from USB using legacy or UEFI; in my case \"legacy\" was indicated by \"PMAP\".\n\nA: The drum sound you mention indicates that Ubuntu successfully booted; that's the standard login sound. This means that your problem is definitely one with the video support. \nThe solution might be hardware-specific or it might be more generic, such as adding the nomodeset kernel parameter to the boot loader options. (I don't recall precisely how to do this with the Ubuntu install CD, though; maybe somebody else can post that information, or you could try Googling it.) \nAnother option is to try another distribution; sometimes one runs into video problems and another doesn't.\n", "Q: How can I use Work-space edge settings on Gnome-Classic I am using Ubuntu 12.04 with Gnome-Classic and I need to configure Work-space edge settings.

But the decription from that package apt-cache show ubuntu-desktop says:\nDescription-en: The Ubuntu desktop system\n This package depends on all of the packages in the Ubuntu desktop system\n .\n It is also used to help ensure proper upgrades, so it is recommended that\n it not be removed.\n\nthat it should not be removed, because it is needed to ensure a successful system-update.\nHow can I remove Unity-2D without removing Ubuntu-Desktop?\n\nA: It is perfectly okay to remove ubuntu-desktop package if you want to remove Unity and Unity-2D. Because ubuntu-desktop is a meta package and used to pull the standard packages in an Ubuntu Desktop installation. Since you are removing a dependency of Ubuntu-Desktop package, it will be removed too. \nBut, you don't need to worry. You won't lose anything by removing it. You might take a look at this question. \nFor the specific query: \n\nHow can I remove Unity-2D without removing Ubuntu-Desktop?\n\nYou just cannot. There is no way to have Ubuntu-Desktop package with Unity-2D removed without being please with a broken package system.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why removing gnome-core does not remove all of it's dependencies?\n\nA: Remove or modify the file /usr/share/xsessions/ubuntu-2d.desktop. For example, do\nsudo mv /usr/share/xsessions/ubuntu-2d.desktop /root/ubuntu-2d.desktop.backup\n\nUnfortunately, you cannot selectively remove the 2D libraries from the system without breaking the dependencies, because the authors of Ubuntu decided that 2D is mandatory for Ubuntu.\nEDIT: If you want to remove Unity-2D (but only Unity-2D, not anything else), there are two strategies:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go with loosing Unity-Desktop. This will not remove the other unity libraries, as Unity-Desktop is just a meta-package, it's purpose is to depend on a large number of other packages such that by installing this single package, you also install all these dependencies.\n\n*(much, much harder) Create a dummy meta-package that provides the Unity-2D package, but does not install any files.\n", "Q: Computer (Amd64 Turion processor) not booting after instalition I have a machine running windows 7, and a laptop with a Amd 64 - Turion processor running Vista.

The laptop has a hardware WLAN switch.\nI have problems activating the WLAN when booting with the hardware switch set to \"off\". The situation is a bit confusing, unfortunately.\nrfkill lists two WLAN devices (though lspci only shows the Intel one). This is the situation when booting with the hardware switch set to \"Off\":\n0: dell-wifi: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: yes\n    Hard blocked: yes\n1: dell-bluetooth: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: yes\n    Hard blocked: yes\n2: phy0: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: yes\n    Hard blocked: yes\n\nFrom some tests, I conclude WLAN is only activated when both, the dell-wifi and phy0, are unblocked by soft- and hardware. But I can only unblock dell-wifi after the hardware switch is set to \"on\".\nProcedure right from boot with hardware switch set to \"Off\":\n\n\n*\n\n*Soft-unblocking phy0 works as expected. Could be done by start-up script.\n\n*sudo rfkill unblock 0: nothing happens. Soft block of dell-wifi not removed.\n\n*Set the hardware switch to \"on\": phy0 gets its hard block removed. Still no WLAN.\n\n*sudo rfkill unblock 0: both the soft and hard lock of dell-wifi are removed. WLAN is now active and works.\n\n*sudo rfkill block 0: only adds the soft block as expected. WLAN goes off again.\n\n\nSo, in order to activate WLAN, I have to use the hardware switch and afterwards (manually) run a script - that's a bit inconvenient.\nDoes someone know a better solution? Maybe a daemon could help that listens to rfkill events to unblock dell-wifi after I have set the hardware switch to \"on\"? (sounds like another workaround)\nWhen booting with the hardware switch set to \"On\", nothing is blocked neither hard nor soft.\n\nA: There's already a daemon you can use for this purpose: udevd\nYou can create a rules file for it to listen to rfkill events, see this unix.stackexchange.com answer.

The only difference from that question is that when I run env | grep TERM I get TERM=xterm instead of TERM=xterm-color.

You can find further documentations in the /usr/share/doc/relinux/README file.\n\n*Install Software\nTo create yourself a unique distributable Ubuntu DVD you need to install the software you want on it on your current system. Do this by opening Synaptic Package Manager and use the search bar to find the packages you want to install.  Click the checkbox right next to the package and select  Mark for Installation.\nMost packages will need to install more packages they're dependent on, you will need to Mark those too.\nAfter you have selected all the packages you want, click the Apply button.\nAll software you have installed on your current system will later automatically be transferred to the iso-image of you DVD. Make sure that the content you want on your DVD does not exceed the size of 4GB! Otherwise Relinux will not produce an .iso file out of the filesystem\n\n*Use Relinux\nRelinux uses a config file for every command which you better edit before you use the program for the first time. Leave the original config as backup and create a new one in a specified location (I'll do it in my personal folder):\ncd /home/MYUSER\ncp /etc/relinux/relinux.conf ./relinux.conf\n\n*Next direct Relinux to the new configuration file:\nsed -i 's:EXCLUDES=\"\\(.*\\)\":EXCLUDES=\"\\1 'readlink -f ./relinux.conf'\":g' ./relinux.conf\nIt is highly recommended to have a look at all the options in the config file and adjust them to your liking. If you do not exclude enough files to bring the squashed file system to a maximum of 4 GB, Relinux will not create an image out of it. Additionally there are other helpful options like the choice of a boot splash screen or the naming of the actual image.\nRelinux' actual control is only possible through the command line. It generally has the same options as Remastersys at the moment except for the lack of an explicit backup command, which however can be accomplished by not excluding the home folder:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo relinux clean [configfile] - Cleans the working directory of unimportant process stuff\n\n*sudo relinux fullclean [configfile] - Cleans the working directory completely, including the .iso image, the checksum and all other files  \n\n*sudo relinux squashfs [configfile] - Creates the squashed file system to build the iso-image out of. This is the necessary step to take before actually creating an iso-image. This can also be used to retroactively add files to the file system before creating the images  \n\n*sudo relinux onlyiso [configfile] - Creates the actual iso-image which can be used in a virtual machine or burned on a CD to boot your custom system from (before choosing this option a file system must have been created using squashfs)  \n\n*sudo relinux iso [configfile] - Creates the squashed file system and the .iso image in one command  \n\n\nSince you most likely want to use the image you create for burning it on a DVD you should pay attention to the summed size of software and files you add to it.\nEvery file created with Relinux will be placed in its temporary directory, which by default is /home/relinux. That counts for filesystems as well as for images (e.g. custom.iso by default). Be sure you move your image to some other place since this temporary folder will be emptied on the use of fullclean. \n\n*Add Files to a Non-Backup Filesystem Without home-folder\nIf you have a home folder that is to large to put it on a DVD but still have files that need to be on the image, there are two ways you can put them on it; one has to be dealt with before you create the file system and one that can also be done after it has been created.\na. /etc/Skel Folder\nTo add files to your non-backup image before you create the file system, just put them into the /etc/Skel folder to let the files appear in your home folder on the image afterwards. The /etc/Skel folder is responsible for populating the home folder on every installation and every adding of a new user.\nb. Squashfs-tools\nSquashfs-tools is package that allows you to build and uncompress but also to add files to squashed filesystems, which are also used to build the filesystem on Remastersys and Relinux. They can be used to append files to already created filesystems. Install them by entering the following into a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install squashfs-tools\nThe squashfs-tools offer two commands to use, one to create filesystems or add files to existing and one to uncompress them. The first one is\nmksquashfs\nAnd its basic structure is the command followed by one or more source files or folders and the path to the squashed file (e.g. mksquashfs /home/MYUSER/Desktop/bla /home/MYUSER/Desktop/ultimate.squashfs).   \nThe last folder in the path of the source file will be the root of the squash filesystem unless you specify otherwise with an option, meaning it will not be directly displayed itself.   \nThe same command is also used to append files to existing squash filesystems, which is what we basically want.   \nTo do so, just pick the existing filesystem as the filesystem to create and the files to append in the input files' path.   \nUnfortunately, it is not possible to merge the two filesystems, which is why we circumvent this problem by creating a folder called extrafiles (could be any name) in any folder and choose this upper folder as the one to add to the system (it will become the root folder and the folder inside, the one we want, will be displayed along the files in the filesystem's root folder).    \nAdd the files you want on your DVD to the extrafiles folder. Following would be a possible way to add files to the filesystem:\nmksquashfs /home/MYUSER/Desktop/bla /home/remastersys/remastersys/ISOTMP/casper/filesystem.squashfs\nIn this example the folder bla is the one containing the extrafiles folder.\nSee the man page for further switches and options.\nTo uncompress a squash filesystem, use following command:\nunsquashfs\nThe most common way to use this command should be combined with the destination switch. Make sure to choose an unexisting directory as destination since it will give you an error otherwise.\nunsquashfs -d /home/MYUSER/Desktop/unexistingdirectory /home/remastersys/remastersys/ISOTMP/casper/filesystem.squashfs\n\nA: OK after searching through the Linux file system, i found few files (logos) which can be replaced to prevent copyright violation.\nAll the files resides in\n    /usr/share/icons &\n    /usr/share/pixmaps\n\nFile names to replace are (All files are in png or svg file format)\n    start-here \n    distributor-logo\n    ubuntu-logo \n\nI will add more names if i will find in future.

If that doesn't work it definitely has nothing to do with Ubuntu.\nDon't know how it is in Brazil but I would say they can't force you to have Windows installed to replace obviously broken hardware and refusing to do so doesn't sound like Lenovo at all. You should insist on them to fix this. If they need Windows to fix it, I think it's their job to swap the hard drive and install it themselves.\n\nA: I have had the same issue. After much fooling around, I discovered that the problem seems to be in a faulty locking switch. At times the problem is solved when I take the battery out and sharply close the locking switch. Other times in the battery component of Lenovo, it means resetting the battery under Battery Management.\n", "Q: Transmission dependencies are not in repository I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 using Gnome3 through their ppa in launchpad. Went good until now. Today Ubuntu wanted to make some updates and I thought okay. But it didn't want to install all of them. Turned out there were not all dependencies in the ppa. Before I noticed that, I (noob :D) uninstalled (apt-get purge) Transmission in order to reinstall it. Bad Idea, because now I can't install it, even using synaptics.\nThe problem: It seems like the only ppas that have transmission in it are the one from gnome3 team (not all packages included according to synaptics, v2.71) and the official (transmission-common missing, v2.61). So when I try to install a package it says that transmission-common is too new. I can't even find the version that should be somewhere in the official standard Ubuntu ppa. Installing from the Software center doesn't work either.\nWhy aren't all dependencies in the ppas or why can't I see them? How can I install Transmission (stable, newest version) again? And why has the gnome3 team a newer version as the stable ppa of transmission? Are they including beta software?\nIf you need any additional information just tell me. Sorry I think it's quiet confusing what I did there. Thanks in advance.\nEDIT1\nOkay sorry, I should have explained better. When I try to install it tells me something of dependency problems.\nWhen I try\n    sudo apt-get install ...\nit says:\n\n\nDie folgenden Pakete haben unerfüllte Abhängigkeiten:\n     transmission-cli : Hängt ab von: transmission-common (= 2.61-0ubuntu0.12.04.1) aber 2.71-0ubuntu1~precise1 soll installiert werden\n     transmission-daemon : Hängt ab von: transmission-common (= 2.61-0ubuntu0.12.04.1) aber 2.71-0ubuntu1~precise1 soll installiert werden\n     transmission-gtk : Hängt ab von: transmission-common (= 2.61-0ubuntu0.12.04.1) aber 2.71-0ubuntu1~precise1 soll installiert werden\n    E: Probleme können nicht korrigiert werden, Sie haben zurückgehaltene defekte Pakete.\n\n\nUnfortunately I'm using Ubuntu in German.\nHere a picture of synaptics (I didn't know how to show better):\nhttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/8240739/Synaptic-Paketverwaltung%20_002.png\nMaybe it helps.\n\nA: Step 1: Add Transmission PPA Repository\nTransmission is readily available in Ubuntu repository. However, Ubuntu repository is usually a bit slow on updating versions. So if you are like me and would like to have the latest version as soon as possible, then add the PPA repository as described below. If not proceed to step 2.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:transmissionbt/ppa\n\nStep 2: Install Transmission Web Interface\nThen update packages list and install Transmission:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install transmission-cli transmission-common transmission-daemon\n\nIf you want the full desktop gui software then use:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install transmission-gtk transmission-cli transmission-common transmission-daemon\n\nStep 3: Configure Users and Permissions\nIt is recommended that Transmission runs under it’s own username for security reasons. This creates a few issues with file and folder access by Transmission as well as your account (let us assume it is user). You will have to create a new set of folders for Transmission to read/write/execute (example: transmission folder containing these subfolders: completed, incomplete, and torrents). The account user also needs full control over these folders and their contents. I recommend reading this post to familiarize yourself with safely changing user groups and permissions.\nFirst, cd to the desired folder and create a folder for Transmission to use:\ncd /home/user/Downloads\nmkdir transmission\ncd transmission\nmkdir completed incomplete torrents\n\nThen, add the username user to the group debian-transmission:\nsudo usermod -a -G debian-transmission user\nThis will add debian-transmission as a secondary group to the account user, resulting in access to both Transmission and user. Then, change the ownership of the Transmission download folders to the group debian-transmission:\nsudo chgrp -R debian-transmission /home/user/Downloads/transmission\n\nNext, change the permissions for the transmission download folders to allow read, write, and execute for Transmission and user:\nsudo chmod -R 775 /home/user/Downloads/transmission\n\nThis gives the group debian-transmission, of which both Transmission and user are members of, full access while others get only read and execute permissions. If you want to further restrict access for others you could use 774 (read only) or 770 (no access). \n", "Q: Setting Default Ubuntu eth port Background:\nI have a desktop computer running Ubuntu 12.04.\nI have installed DRBL to handle DHCP server and Clonezilla Server.\nI have a network card in my desktop with 2 ports in it.\nThese 2 ports are bonded together and are used by DRBL.\nThere is a 3rd port integrated in the motherboard.\nI want to use this 3rd port for internet.\nDRBL knows that this is set for internet.\nEDIT: \"Ubuntu Network-Manager has stopped recognising the connections (device not managed).\" - I have now uninstalled Network-Manager.\nIt use to say that eth1 was default (first port in the network card)\nI want eth0 to be default as that is the Internet port.\nQuestion:\nHow do I make eth0 as the default port without using Network-Manager?\n\nA: The way to use network manager for default network assignment is by checking the 'Use this connection only for resources on its network' option in editing IPv4 routes on all connections you do NOT want to be the default.\nTo do this without Network manager simply edit connections that you don't want to be default and add the following at the end of each corresponding file in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/YourConnection\nnever-default=true\n\nthis line should be added under IPv4 section.\nNOTE: Replace YourConnection with the corresponding Connection name.

Represented in the PEM format, these keys have the more generic -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- header, which doesn't tell you what kind (RSA, DSA, EC) key it is.\nPreviously, with OpenSSL 0.9.8, keys were always in a format called PKCS #1, which represented as PEM, had the header -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----.\nBecause of this you cannot simply change the header and footer from:\n-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n\nto\n-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`\n\nIt's not the same thing and it won't work.  Instead you need to convert the key to the old format using openssl rsa.  Like this:\nopenssl rsa -in key_in_pkcs1_or_pkcs8.pem -out key_in_pkcs1.pem\n\nMySQL (v5.5.35) on Ubuntu 12.04 is using an SSL implementation called yaSSL (v2.2.2).  It expect keys to be in the PKCS #1 format and doesn't support the PKCS #8 format used by OpenSSL 1.0 and newer.  If you simply change the header and footer, as suggested by other posts in this thread, MySQL/yaSSL won't complain, but you'll be unable to connect and instead end up with an error like this:\nERROR 2026 (HY000): SSL connection error: protocol version mismatch\n\nUbuntu 14.04 comes with OpenSSL 1.0.1f and new settings.  Among other things, it will generate certificates with SHA256 digests instead of SHA1, which was used in earlier versions.  Incidentially, the yaSSL version bundled with MySQL doesn't support this either.\nIf you're generating certificates for use with MySQL, remember to make sure the RSA keys are converted to the traditional PKCS #1 PEM format and that certificates are using SHA1 digests.\nHere's an example of how to generate your own CA, a server certificate and a client certificate.\n# Generate a CA key and certificate with SHA1 digest\nopenssl genrsa 2048 > ca-key.pem\nopenssl req -sha1 -new -x509 -nodes -days 3650 -key ca-key.pem > ca-cert.pem\n\n# Create server key and certficate with SHA1 digest, sign it and convert\n# the RSA key from PKCS #8 (OpenSSL 1.0 and newer) to the old PKCS #1 format\nopenssl req -sha1 -newkey rsa:2048 -days 730 -nodes -keyout server-key.pem > server-req.pem\nopenssl x509 -sha1 -req -in server-req.pem -days 730  -CA ca-cert.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -set_serial 01 > server-cert.pem\nopenssl rsa -in server-key.pem -out server-key.pem\n\n# Create client key and certificate with SHA digest, sign it and convert\n# the RSA key from PKCS #8 (OpenSSL 1.0 and newer) to the old PKCS #1 format\nopenssl req -sha1 -newkey rsa:2048 -days 730 -nodes -keyout client-key.pem > client-req.pem\nopenssl x509 -sha1 -req -in client-req.pem -days 730 -CA ca-cert.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -set_serial 01 > client-cert.pem\nopenssl rsa -in client-key.pem -out client-key.pem\n\n\nA: I had the same troubles on 12.04 but it was in fact apparmor that caused the problems.\nI found a solution at the Ubuntu Forums, moving .pem files in /etc/mysql resolved it.\nYou can also change the apparmor configuration in /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld.\n\nA: Make sure that the user running the mysqld process has read access to the keys and certificate files.

I presume you instead have libnotify4 and libnm-glib4 installed.\nThose packages provide the library binaries for installed programs to use, but they do not provide the header files necessary to build programs from source code that use the libraries. Header files are provided by packages whose names end in -dev. In particular, the packages you need to build programs that use those two libraries are called libnotify-dev and libnm-glib-dev. Note that while the binary package have major version numbers in their names (4 at the end), these -dev packages do not.\nThat should enable you to build tsclient from source if you wish to do so, or at least should overcome those particular errors in the build process.\n", "Q: Recovering data from / I accidentally installed Ubuntu to one of my data drives from Windows.

Everything went smoothly until I scanned my music files in some of the Ubuntu players...\nAll of my ratings added in Windows, using Mediamonkey, were out-of-five-stars (some with a half-star precision) - but when imported into RhythmBox, Banshee and Quod Libet, they all changed to a out-of-four-stars rating, with no five-star songs and no indication of how the old ratings were mapped into the new system.\nDoes anyone know how to fix this? Even getting to know which way the ratings were mapped from 5-star system (with a half-star increment) to a 4-star basis will be very helpful.\nThank you!\n\nA: I can only answer for Quod Libet, but like many others, this uses a decimal 0.0 - 1.0 rating system. In the user interface this appears as \"stars\" (now any symbol actually). The original value is rounded to the nearest number of stars configured (4 by default), i.e 0.5 = 2 stars. You can even search by ratings, e.g. #(rating>=0.8)\nNote that this number of stars is itself configurable, so you see your 10 (5 and 5 halves) distinct ratings (See Can I show more than 0 to 4 notes when rating songs?). I'm not sure how MM stores them though (I seem to remember QL does understand them though). If you're seeing roughly the correct ratings already, it should work at the higher accuracy too.\nNote there's some discussion about potential improvements to the interface and configurability for all this.\n", "Q: Gnome Classic's clock on Unity I really like the Gnome Classic's clock indicator.

I remember seeing reference to a settings file where I would be able to choose how long the drive can sit idle for before spinning down, but I don't know where it was.\nAdditionally, if the drive uses an NTFS file system, will the system write or read anything from the drive by itself which could prevent the spin-down from happening? I was intending to permanently mount it using the installer to /windows, but would be open to any better methods if this would cause a problem.\nThanks for any assistance.\n\nA: To put your second HDD (I suppose /dev/sdb) to standby immediately, you can use\nsudo hdparm -y /dev/sdb\n\nTo put it to standby after a minute of inactivity, you can use\nsudo hdparm -S 12 /dev/sdc\n\n(time is counted in 5s for 5s to 20min)\nTo make this setting permanent, you can write it in /etc/hdparm.conf:\nsudo gedit /etc/hdparm.conf\n\nand there:\n[...]\n/dev/sdb {\n    spindown_time = 12\n}\n\n\nA: You could also try to enabled Aggressive Link Power Management (ALPM).  Aggressive Link Power Management (ALPM) is a mechanism where a SATA AHCI controller can put the SATA link that connects to the disk into a very low power mode during periods of zero I/O activity and into an active power state when work needs to be done. Tests show that this can save around 0.5-2 Watts of power on a typical system.\nALPM is now available in several SATA controllers that use the Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI). However, there is evidence that some controllers may go into a low power state incorrectly and this ends up causing data loss. Ubuntu has the ability to use ALPM but it it disabled by default since it can cause data loss on some machines. Since there is a chance that this can cause data loss do not enable it unless you have backups of your data and are willing to take the risk.\nTo enable ALPM:\necho SATA_ALPM_ENABLE=true | sudo tee /etc/pm/config.d/sata_alpm\n\n", "Q: How do I add the \"user and groups\" application? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to manage users and groups? \n\nI once installed this (gnome thing?) wich gave me an easy access to users groups and advanced settings.

When it opens, run the command below.\nsudo apt-get install gnome-system-tools\n\n", "Q: How save my \"alias\" entries forever I want to save my alias commands forever like the default ones when I type \"alias\" so I don't retype them every time I leave my bash \n\nA: In Ubuntu, the default .bashrc skeleton file looks for a .bash_aliases file in your home directory when you log in and sources it.  So if you just create a .bash_aliases file and put any aliases you want in it, it should be sourced automatically when you open a new bash shell (no need to log out of desktop and back in, just open a new terminal).  Here's the relevant part in the default .bashrc file:\n# Alias definitions.\n# You may want to put all your additions into a separate file like\n# ~/.bash_aliases, instead of adding them here directly.\n# See /usr/share/doc/bash-doc/examples in the bash-doc package.\n\nif [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then\n    . ~/.bash_aliases\nfi\n\n\nA: First copy all your existing aliases to a new file, e.g. ~/.bash_aliases. The simplest way to do this is to execute alias > ~/.bash_aliases. You then remove them from ~/.bashrc and replace by a call to your new file (. ~/.bash_aliases). If fact, you may find that there's a commented section to do this already; just uncomment it.\nYou then need to create (or edit) the file bash executes when it logs out, i.e. ~/.bash_logout and simply put the command alias > ~/.bash_aliases in it. This will overwrite your old set of aliases with the currently defined set ready for your next login each time you logout.\nOf course, if you open multiple sessions and define different aliases in each, then you will need something more complicated to handle this.\n\nA: You have to save your alias's at .bashrc file in your home directory.\nOpen your terminal and type this \ngedit .bashrc\n\nit will open a text file and in that text file place your alias command at the last line and save it and close . \nLogout and login to apply changes and check .\nedit :Also, instead of a logout/login, you may run source ~/.bashrc to immediately apply the new .bashrc file\nHope that helps .\n\nA: Create a file called something like runthisstuff\nIn this file, stick a bunch of commands:\nalias doc='cd ~/Documents/'\nalias ps='ps aux'\ndate\n\nNow run the file like so:\n$ source runthisstuff\n\nIt will print the date, and you can now use the aliases. The date command is just to show you that you can pretty much stick anything you want in there, and it will run.\nNow you still have to manually source this file, which isn't so convenient. Luckily, when you start up a new shell, there are a few files like this that are automatically called. Since you're using a bash shell, ~/.bashrc is automatically sourced. As Ian B. pointed out, in the default .bashrc there's already a part that checks to see if a file called ~/.bash_aliases exists, and sources it if it does. \nSo, you might as well stick your aliases in ~/.bash_aliases\nIf you want your aliases to be extra permanent, you can always create a .bash_aliases file in a Dropbox folder or the like, and create a symlink to that file:\nln -s ~/Path-to-dropbox-aliases/.bash_aliases ~/.bash_aliases\n\nThis will let you easily share them across machines.\n", "Q: How can I get a gnome environment in my VNC session? When I start VNC I have an empty desktop without the ability to manage windows or start apps etc). I'd like to have a desktop environment to be able to basic desktop things (someone asked me why I wanted this - I can't really say except that I would like my computer to be useful).\nMy focus at the moment is basically having a working environment with as little time/effort expenditure as possible, as opposed to spending a full-time week learning the most trivial and arcane details of x, vnc, gnome or whatever passes for the current desktop architecture standard of the hour. \nWhat command or series of hoops do I have to jump to to achieve this? I have tried running gnome-session but it looks like it is attempting to run compiz and fails spectacularly.\nI've also tried running metacity but this simply gives me a titlebars to my windows (this is great! But I'd also like the taskbar and other stuff).\nI considered trying to start gnome-session in a way that it uses metacity instead of compiz. But I don't know how to do this. Tutorials on the net exist for changing to metacity - once you already have compiz running. Not so useful if compiz does not run.\n\nA: Install gnome-session-fallback , by clicking that installation link or by running these commands in a Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T):\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback\n\n", "Q: Run script at user login as root, with a catch I'm trying to run a PHP script as root on user login.  The PHP script adds a Samba share to the Samba config, thus the need for root privileges.  The only issue here, is that the user doesn't exist yet.  This system is integrated with active directory.  So when a user logs in for the first time, a home directory for them is created under /home/DOMAIN/username.  \nI've found this question and that seems like the correct way to get what I want, but I'm having trouble with the syntax since I don't know the user's name.\nWould it be something like: \nALL     ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /home/DOMAIN/*/createSambaShare.php\nThis doesn't seem to work as it is currently.  Anyone have any ideas or a \"scripted\" way to add a Samba share on user login?\nSince I've made other changes to /etc/skel, I just added the bash necessary to run the PHP script in .profile in there.  This then gets copied to the \"new\" user's home and it tries to run the PHP script.  But it fails, because these are not privileged users.\nChanging permissions on the PHP script will not help.  It needs to be run as sudo because it opens the Samba config file for writing.  Letting any user run the PHP script would result in a PHP error.\nThe homes Samba directive doesn't work for my use case.  I need the Samba share to exist once they exist on the server, even when they're not logged in.\n\nA: Do not put the script in the user's home directory. Instead, put it in a fixed location. If the script needs some user-dependent arguments, make the script read that from a file — but you don't even need that since you're copying the script from /etc/skel anyway.\nIf you allow a user to run a script in their home directory with elevated privileges, then they can replace the script by another script. So your proposed rule would be equivalent from a security point of view to\nALL ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /etc/skel/createSambaShare.php\nMANY ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nwhere MANY is any user whose home directory is under /home/DOMAIN. (Ok, unless a user's home directory is owned by root, not writable to the user, and the script is not writable by or owned by the user either. But that would be pretty unusual.)\nAlso, I recommend not using ALL in a User specification. Restrict the rule to a group.\n%sambasharers ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/createSambaShare.php\n\n\nA: *\n\n*You can put it in /etc/profile and it should execute at any successful login.\n\n*Add execution privilege to all users for that script file.

I am making a script and I am looking for a way to get the variable names for Desktop, Music, Documents, Pictures and others Folders. Depending on the language they change. For example Desktop in Spanish is Escritorio. So how can I get the folder directory without needing to find out what language the user is using or having to make several IF statements for each language.\n\nA: The common folder names are as follows. Just extracted from a file in home directory.\nXDG_DESKTOP_DIR=\"$HOME/Desktop\"\nXDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR=\"$HOME/Downloads\"\nXDG_TEMPLATES_DIR=\"$HOME/Templates\"\nXDG_PUBLICSHARE_DIR=\"$HOME/Public\"\nXDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR=\"$HOME/Documents\"\nXDG_MUSIC_DIR=\"$HOME/Music\"\nXDG_PICTURES_DIR=\"$HOME/\"\nXDG_VIDEOS_DIR=\"$HOME/Videos\"\n\nOf course, you are only interested in the variable name. So there are XDG_DESKTOP_DIR, XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR, .... etc.\nRelated question: How can I change the default location of content directories (eg Pictures, Templates, Music)  in my home folder?\nHope this will help. \n\nA: There is a tool called xdg-user-dir that retrieves user directories paths\ndocuments_path=$(xdg-user-dir DOCUMENTS)\necho $documents_path\n\nFrom the docs:\n\nxdg-user-dir looks up the current path for one of the special XDG user dirs.\nThis command expects the name of an XDG user dir as argument.

Yet again I am to turn to this wonderful resource available to me and ask, how do I install the latest version of GNU Octave (not Octave 3.2.4 -- the one available in the software centre)?\n\nA: You can add the ppa:devacom/science PPA to install the latest version of Octave (6.4.0, as of January 2021) in Ubuntu 20.04.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:devacom/science\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt install octave\n\n\nAlternatively, you can use flatpak to install the latest version of Octave in Ubuntu 18.04+.\nsudo apt install flatpak\nflatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo\nflatpak install flathub org.octave.Octave\n\nThen you can run it from the terminal with the command flatpak run org.octave.Octave (the GUI version is available too).\nSee this question to create a wrapper script octave, if you don't want to execute the long command flatpak run org.octave.Octave again and again.\n\nThe PPA mentioned in this part of answer is inactive since 2018, and it is kept for historical purposes.\nYou can install the latest stable version of GNU Octave for any supported Ubuntu release:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:octave/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install octave\n\nThis PPA is maintained and supported by several Octave developers.\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.04.3 and Octave 3.8.0 with statistics\nwget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/octave/octave-3.8.0.tar.bz2\ntar -xvf octave-3.8.0.tar.bz2\ncd octave-3.8.0\nsudo apt-get build-dep octave\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nsudo apt-get install octave-statistics\noctave\npkg install -forge io\npkg install -forge statistics\npkg load statistics\n\n\nA: For octave 3.6.1    \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:picaso/octave\nsudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install octave\n\nYes you can get octave-3.6.3 , open your terminal and paste this \nwget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/octave/octave-3.6.3.tar.bz2\ntar -xvf octave-3.6.3.tar.bz2\ncd octave-3.6.3\n./configure\n make\n sudo make install \n\nHope that helps :D\n\nA: Additionally now I know you can copy the following into the terminal:\nwget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/octave/octave-version#.tar.gz\ntar -xvf /home/username/octave-version#.tar.gz\nsudo rm /home/username/octave-version#.tar.gz\ncd /home/username/octave-version#\n./configure\nmake\nln -s /home/username/octave-version#/run-octave /usr/local/bin/octave\n\n", "Q: History | grep \"keyword2find\" does not gives unlimited history The command \nhistory | grep \"keyword2find\"\n\ndoes not gives unlimited history that i typed in the terminal onwards i installed ubuntu. I want to see all of them without a time span. \n\nA: Use history number | grep keyword the number here refers to how many previous history should be fetched. Example: history 500 will fetch last 500 command of your bash history.\nTo extend your bash history recording add the below lines to your .bashrc file.\nexport HISTSIZE=9000\nexport HISTCONTROL=erasedups\n\nFirst line tells how many history lines should be recorded.\nBy using the second line you can avoid duplicate history lines.\nAlso, to search the history easily you can use Ctrl+R which give a prompt like ! Where in you can type the keyword which you would like to search.\nHow this helps.\n\nA: By default history command, which uses ~/.bash_history file to store command, store only last 2000 commands. So, It doesn't give you unlimited result. \nTo increase the size, open .bashrc file with this command gedit ~/.bashrc and change the line to increase value\nHISTSIZE=1000\nHISTFILESIZE=2000\n\nHISTSIZE refers to the number of commands stored.\nHISTFILESIZE refers to the number of line contained in the history file. \n", "Q: How to install vst plugins with wine I have FL studio 10 installed on my PC through wine and it works perfect. The pre-installed vst's work but any I install (sylenth1, nexus2 and pianoteq) don't work. I have massive installed and it works. I am a little new to Linux but know the basics.\n\nA: I installed them with the .exe and then moved the .dll to the specified folders. FL recognizes them, it just shows a grey box saying \"loading plugin\" and I can choose my preset sounds but the GUI doesn't work i.e. can't play keys on piano, knobs wont move.\n\nA: I've been marginally successful in using Reaper under wine. Their website even states \n\nThe Windows version also works well with WINE. \n\nAfter an install of Reaper, I've copied expanded VST folders into a folder mentioned in it's VST path options. It seems to pick most of them up well. I'm was pretty impressed with the outcome. \nNow there is also a project, I've not used but have been really curious about called Juce. From reading about it, it appears to be a stand alone utility to host native (no emulation) VST instruments. \nI've also read another SE answer, that talks about building Ardour with VST support. \n", "Q: Prizes for App Showdown winners I'm the winner of App Showdown community vote.

The graphics aren't working (choppy effects, bad resolution) and the keyboard and mouse inputs are even laggy and unreliable (skips keystrokes). I'm not sure what the problem is or what I can do to fix it.\nI tried sudo apt-get install mesa-utils but nothing changed. I've also messed around in the BIOS but no luck there either. \nAny ideas? Could it possibly be a hardware issue?\n\nA: If you get an error message during boot about turning on irqpoll, it's the firewire port.\nYou should disable firewire in the BIOS and it will run like a champ.\n", "Q: Ubuntu start up screen broken I set up dual boot on my extra pc last night. \nFirst installed windows 7 and that  went just fine.\nDownloaded Ubuntu and then did the MD5SUM and did not get a correct return that were listed on the site. \nI forgot to do that before I burnt the image to a disc, so I booted from the disc anyway to do the intergrity check and no errors were found. \nI then installed and everything seems fine except when it's booting, the purple screen is broken. should I try to redownload and re install?\n\nA: When you see the Grub menu, hit the e key. \n\nThis special mode of Grub allows you to temporarily modify Ubuntu's boot parameters.\n\nAdd to the end of the line: \nacpi=off\n\n\nIf this worked, do the following once Ubuntu is loaded to make the change permanent:\ngksu nano /etc/default/grub\n\nChange the line that looks like:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nSo that it now reads:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi=off\"\n\nSave the file, then run:\nsudo update-grub\n\n\nA: The difference in the md5sum that you see is telling you that you have a download that was corrupted in some way.  There's a difference in the iso file that may, and probably has, caused you problems.\nThe Integrity check only tests to see if the disk is 100% readable, it does not mean that the iso was not corrupted during download.\nYou will need to get the iso again.  If you have a problem downloading reliably then you should use one of the torrent downloads since torrents have built-in block testing and recovery in case of corruption.  I've had one or two corrupted iso files from normal downloads over the years, but not one since I started using torrents for downloading them.\n", "Q: Does changing my Launchpad GPG key require any changes to my PPAs?

Actually it looks like wine can handle Picasa on my windows partition, but is there any disadvantage in doing that?\n\nA: Picasa is no longer supported by Google for the Linux Platform... Which is a shame but it is what it is... That doesn't mean that it can't be installed if you can find old .deb files.... Just keep in mind that you won't get any updates or new features that the Windows version might receive...\nAlso you might be able to successfully install it using WINE, but I am not overly familiar with working with WINE.\n\nA: You'll need to install Picasa on Ubuntu using wine and there by can control all your files on your windows partition by mounting it on ubuntu.\n", "Q: mic on cam don't work the cam works.

I'm afraid that's where my knowledge ends; never had to bridge wireless to wired, just wired to KVM virtual network.\nOh, and you'll need the bridge-utils package.\n", "Q: How to avoid upgrade restart How can I avoid having to restart after an upgrade?\nI usually lock kernel upgrades as well as all libc packages. However, from time to time, after an upgrade I still am requested to reboot so that upgrades are completed. So my question is: what packages do I have to lock in order to avoid an upgrade restart?\n\nA: I think GUI packages like GNOME, Cinnamon require restart too\n\nA: The only upgrade that requires a restart is the kernel. Even then, you don't have to restart as long as you're happy to still run the old kernel. However, you might be unable to load any more modules if the upgrade has changed binary compatibility of the kernel (which might have happened if the new kernel package has a different version, even if it's the minor version that indicates that only the Ubuntu patch has changed).\nYou do need to restart any programs you've upgraded if you want to run the new version. For your desktop environment, that might mean logging out and back in (system services, on the other hand, can just be restarted in the background). You also need to restart programs that use a library or data file that has been upgraded. Again, this is only if you want to be running the new version: if you're happy to keep running the old version, just don't reboot.\n", "Q: How can I connect 12.4 to the Internet with WEP key? I have Ubuntu and I want to know how can I connect to the Internet using my WEP key for my wireless. \nI tried too many times but it doesn't work. I have my wireless password but it doesn't work too.\nCan somebody help me?\n\nA: I'm a little confused.  A WEP key is a security code used on some Wi-Fi networks.  It is usually  a set of hex numbers 10 or 26 digits long.  A \"wireless password\" might mean you are using WPA encryption.  check out how to reset your router from the manual that came with it.  Usually this involves pressing a small button on the back of the router labeled \"RESET\" for several seconds then using the default password and username to set up your security--good luck!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 transmission-daemon and zfsonlinux: bad file descriptor and corrupt pieces I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 with zfsonlinux and transmission-daemon. \nThe issues: \n\nsporadic Bad File Descriptor and Piece #xxx is corrupt errors.\n\nAfter I recheck the torrent, everything seems fine. That happens only when downloading: once it's in seeding mode. This only happens after the torrent client has been running for some time.\nI installed zfsonlinux from the official stable PPA. I previously tried running transmission-daemon from the Ubuntu repository, but since I've switched to building the latest transmission from source with the latest libevent (all stable) - same thing.\nI've seen bug reports for that issue, but none of them seem to have a solution.\nHow can I fix these errors or at least understand where they come from and what I can do to rectify the issue?\n\nA: It turned out transmission-daemon has a bug, after verify it can show a torrent as 100%, but still fail when trying to read it. What makes the issue worse is that it reports Bad file descriptor on downloading torrents, not the bad one. After strace-ing it, I figured I always got bad file descriptor on the same file, no matter what it reported, so I removed that torrent and everything works fine. There's more information on the transmission trac page.\n", "Q: Will my existing operating system be deleted? Or will Ubuntu be installed alongside Mac OS X? Is Ubuntu safe to install? Will my existing operating system be deleted? Or will Ubuntu be installed alongside Mac OS X?\nDoes the installer automatically start when I reboot? I read on another website that a user's PC didn't run when he rebooted.\n\nA: Yes, Ubuntu is safe to install. When you put your installation media in, you may have to choose to boot from that drive. Since I don't use a mac, I am not entirely sure how to do that on a mac, but here is a link that should show you how to do that.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1948\nthis link might provide an even simpler solution (I think all you have to do is hold down \"C\" during startup):\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1533\nOnce you successfully boot from your Ubuntu installation media, the installation process is very easy. You can choose to install Ubuntu on a separate partition from your OS X partition. That way you will still have Mac OS on your computer, but you will also have Ubuntu. Just follow the on-screen instructions during installation and you will easily be able to set this up.\nAfter you successfully install Ubuntu, every time you boot up, the GRUB boot loader will come up first. From this screen, you will be able to choose which operating system to load. If you don't choose one within 10 seconds or so, the default option will be chosen. This option will most likely be Ubuntu, so every time you want to boot into OS X, you will have to arrow down to it. \nUbuntu is a very safe operating system, and it is very easy to work with. I'm sure you will find the installation process to be simple. I hope you enjoy your experience with it. Best of luck!\n\nA: Ubuntu will boil your dog and skin your cat, so I would suggest you throw the CD as far away as you can and hide in a locked closet!!!\nAll jokes aside, Ubuntu is completely safe to install, will install alongside any detected Operating System including Mac OS X, and will start when you reboot the computer (on most systems). You will need to choose to boot from the CD on Mac systems.\n\nA: Sometimes, whenever you install Ubuntu along another operating system, the bootloader can get a little funny. However, this is uncommon and there IS a fix. It is absolutely safe to install Ubuntu on your computer. Be sure to look for a guide on dual booting OS X and Ubuntu 12.04 in your case. As I said before, if it does mess up, which is unlikely, you can fix it, no problem. We are here to help! :)\n", "Q: Benefits of installing compat-wireless? Last week I had problems installing a wireless network adapter in Ubuntu 12.04, and searching at Google many people recommend installing compat-wireless to solve problems of this type. My question is:\nWhat exactly is compat-wireless and what benefits brings?\nAre there other options for solving problems with wireless network adapters on Ubuntu?\n\nA: Compat-wireless, now just called compat-drivers is a set of backported kernel drivers. That means, installing the compat drivers gives you drivers that are newer than the ones included in Ubuntu. So if the problem you're having has been addressed in a newer driver version, installing the compat drivers will help you.\nYou can find compat repositories for Ubuntu here. \n\nA: compat-wireless has been recently renamed to compat-drivers, according to Linux Wireless\nyou can find more info concerning compat-drivers here\n", "Q: How do I change the line spacing in Terminal? Is it possible to change the line spacing in Terminal, or is there some other app that allows it?  I'm moving from the Mac, and its terminal app has this feature which allows line spacing to be changed independent of the font size. \nE.g., here's Monaco on the Mac at 17pt, without any adjustments. My issue with it is that it's a jumble of text - the eye is drawn vertically as much as it is horizontally:\n\nAnd with \"1.1\" line spacing and slightly tighter character spacing. I do this so that my eye follows lines easier. It's a general rule of thumb in layout that space between lines should be larger than the space between words. This gets a little closer to that ideal:\n\nI'm wondering how to achieve this with Ubuntu. For now, my best workaround is to use Source Code Pro, which is designed with these ideas in mind, apparently:\n\n\nA: There is one terminal emulator that has this feature.\nurxvt\n\nfrom man urxvt:\n-lsp number\nCompile frills: Lines (pixel height) to insert between each row of the display.      \nUseful to work around font rendering problems; resource lineSpace.\n\nurxvt is avalable in thease packages:\nrxvt-unicode\nrxvt-unicode-256color\nrxvt-unicode-lite\n\nA: This feature is available in GNOME Terminal version 3.28 (VTE terminal emulation library version 0.52).\n\nA: Konsole has this feature.  You'll find it under profile settings in the rightmost tab.  Konsole is a KDE application, but it has relatively few dependencies and seems to work well without KDE.\nThe mac terminal supports this for a good reason.  Atom (editor) supports it too.  To me it's indispensable.  I imagine, many people prefer a little more line spacing/ line height.\nurxvt seems a little antiquated to me.\n\nA: To my knowledge this is not directly achievable.  Nor would you want it to be. Having a space between lines would really mess up \"text ui\" based programs like nano, mail, and that little dialog that pops up when you run apt from the command line.\nHowever, there is good news. You can just change the font.  Some fonts have a kind of \"padding\" that will give you the same effect. \nI recommend that you use Source Code Pro it's very readable, though it honestly doesn't give as much padding as you want.\nKeep in mind that on Linux the terminal is different concept then it is on OS X. As someone that is migrating myself, I think the best advice I can give is to just use the defaults for a while then make a decision.\n\nA: This isn't really a fix but you can add a blank line after every command with:\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND=\"echo\"\n\n\nA: \nspace between lines should be larger than the space between words\n\nI had the same requirement, and I use mobaxterm.\nI do not want to use a new terminal just for such detail.\nI find that just changing the font to cascadia mono or source code pro makes the screen enjoyable.\nmine\n", "Q: Can't install 12.04 inside Windows 7 using WUBI I've tried to install Ubuntu inside Windows 7 so many times, as the installation is done, a window pops up:\nAn error occurred:\nNoneType' object has no attribute 'get_info'\nFor more information please see the log file\n\nHere is my log:\nhttp://pastebin.com/knwT92E6\nPlease help me.\n\nA: This is a bug - remove the CD and run Wubi standalone again.

When I attempt to boot from the USB, however, Ubuntu will not fully run. \nI am able to get a plain purple screen with the word Ubuntu in orange centered on the screen. Have I missed a step or have I done something wrong?\n\nA: There is a lot that might be wrong if it just freezes there. One thing you might try is to use Ubuntu in its fail-safe mode. You can do so (from last I remember) by hitting F4 on the Ubuntu menu, and selecting fail-safe mode. This will run the live CD in \"safe graphics\" mode which is generally the problem with Live CD environments.\nOne thing you can do to troubleshoot this problem is to press F8 when the purple screen appears.

I am really new to Ubuntu and I'm so confused, so please excuse my ignorance.  \nI have two drives on my computer an 80gig and 500gb.  I have Ubuntu installed on the 80gb drive but have all my media on the 500gb drive. I have changed the directory setting for my music and video files to look at the 500gb harddrive instead of the original default folder on the drive that Ubuntu is installed on.  However, when I tried to add files to my music and video folders on the larger drive I apparently do not have permission to do that or modify the folder in any way at all since it is owned by root.  \nI have tried a couple of suggestions posted in this forum but I can't seem to find anything that works and I keep getting operation not permitted.  Can someone please provide me with a step by step idiot's guide to changing my permissions? Maybe I have even set everything up incorrectly.  I am willing to remount the drive or anything that's necessary (I have everything backed up on an external drive).\n\nA: To change ownership of your files and folders in your hard drive\nsudo chown -Rv username /path-to-your-secong(500GB)-hdd\n\nR stands for recursive & v to verbose the output\nHere a simple tutorial about chown\n< chown - change the owner of a file >\nYou can change the owner and group of a file or a directory with the chown command. Please, keep in mind you can do this only if you are the root user or the owner of the file.\nSet the file's owner:\nchown username somefile\n\nAfter giving this command, the new owner of a file called somefile will be the user username. The file's group owner will not change. Instead of a user name, you can also give the user's numeric ID here if you want.\nYou can also set the file's group at the same time. If the user name is followed by a colon and a group name, the file's group will be changed as well.\nchown username:usergroup somefile\n\nAfter giving this command, somefile's new owner would be user username and the group usergroup.\nYou can set the owner of a directory exactly the same way you set the owner of a file:\nchown username somedir\n\nNote that after giving this command, only the owner of the directory will change. The owner of the files inside of the directory won't change.\nIn order to set the ownership of a directory and all the files in that directory, you'll need the -R option:\nchown -R username somedir\n\nHere, R stands for recursive because this command will recursively change the ownership of directories and their contents. After issuing this example command, the user username will be the owner of the directory somedir, as well as every file in that directory.\nTell what happens:\nchown -v username somefile\n\nOutput is:\nchanged ownership of 'somefile' to username\n\nHere, v stands for verbose. If you use the -v option, chown will list what it did (or didn't do) to the file.\nThe verbose mode is especially useful if you change the ownership of several files at once. For example, this could happen when you do it recursively:\nsudo chown -Rv username somedir\n\nOutput is:\nchanged ownership of 'somedir/' to username \nchanged ownership of 'somedir/boringfile' to username \nchanged ownership of 'somedir/somefile' to username\n\n\nA: I would be curious to see how you mounted the 500GB drive. Whenever I ran into this issue myself it would always be that I placed the incorrect permissions on the drive.\nWhile 777-ing the directory structure will work, it is not exactly the most secure way of solving the problem.\nTo try and the solve this problem I would take a closer look at how you mounted the drive.\nThis might be a good guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions#Systemwide_Mounts\n\nA: You can do man chown at any time and it will give a synopsis of the general look to the command\nSYNOPSIS\n       chown [OPTION]... [OWNER][:[GROUP]] FILE...\n\nchown user:users gives ownership to the user and to group users\nand you can add the options too, R or v\nR is recursive when using this command in a folder\nv is for verbose output\nIf you know the synopsis of the command you can reference the options in the Manual\n", "Q: I installed Ubuntu alongside Windows but I can't see it in Windows' boot menu I have a second machine where Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Debian Squeeze are installed on the same HD and when I boot, I have this grub menu where I can choose which partition I will used.

Somehow, in my bios (or cmos) option, i have a boot option when i start my pc (before having the windows menu) and i can press F## to enter what it is called \"boot option menu\" and it lead me to my HD, and also to my usb drives. So i select my second HD, and i had the proper menu of Ubuntu including Windows, where now i can select Ubuntu and starting it properly.  \n\nA: I believe you can chainload the GRUB bootloader with EasyBCD, try finding a option that says chainload, or make a Linux Entry that points to your second HD.\n\nA: Run a Live Session of Ubuntu (from cd or usb).

Would choosing \"Erase and use the entire disc\" convert the filesystem to ext4 automatically?\n\nA: *\n\n*Linux does  not run on an ntfs filesystem. You will need to select another filesystem like ext4.\n\n*Think about partitioning the disk first.  For instance, two 25G partitions for system installations (one for trying out new releases, one stable one you use until you like a new one better), a swap partition (two times the memory size is the standard for swap size), and a big partition you can use for your files, which you can mount in your home directories.  The system and data partition should be ext4.  \n\n*partition and select the filesystems and mount points during installation, select \"do something else\" instead of using whole disk. Really, only a / and swap need be initially defined at this time.\n\n*Erase and use whole disk would work, but see #2 for other options.\n\n*I always check the size of the disk being used for installation.  /dev/sda is usually the internal hard disk, but check anyway.\n\n", "Q: Internal microphone doesn't work on an Acer Aspire 1410 Ubuntu 12.04 32bit\nACER Aspire 1410\nThe built in microphone will not pic up sound.\nI have tried adjusting in pavucontrol, alsa mixer, and alsa-base.conf with various options:\noptions snd-hda-intel model= <-- \"laptop\" \"acer\" etc.\nBut...no luck!\nThe computer was previously running netbook remix.

(with end result: installation failed)\nOtherwise is it normal that while the system is doing some installation,extracting packs and so on, other applications often become unresponsive? \nSidenote: I don't care about fancy desktop effects, I installed ubuntu to go on and experiment with web servers, memcache, Varnish and git/svn. So basically I plan to do lots of console-only operations. \nMy surprise was also the difference of stability compared to an old FreeBSD installation I had on a dinosaur P3 550Mhz :) \n(I am on a SONY VPCCW2S1E) (I guess it might have to do something with my problems?)\nI noticed when doing 'top' that the process that is taking most of the CPU time, and that is pumping up randomly, is mount.ntfs. \n\nA: No, it is not normal - according to the specs I looked at your machine is an i3 processor and only a few years old.  It should be running much better than this EeePC 900SD I am on at the moment which has no problem installing Chrome or anything else with it's 900Mhz Celeron.\nMake sure you've run all the updates, and they any required third party drivers are loaded - video, network etc.\nThe first step in debugging this is finding out where the bottle neck really is.  Install and run top in command line to see what processes are are taking all of the cpu time.

During an installation, as usual, we create our main user account, and then we can do sudo commands with it without problem.\nNow, when I created another account, and I wanted to do sudo, it gave me error that the account is not in the sudoers file. In that file I found out that users in %admin and %sudo groups can gain root privileges. But my main account is not in neither one of those groups and I can do sudo with it without problem, but with the other account I can't.\nIs there something besides sudoers that I should know about? Thanks\n\nA: The admin and sudoer groups should give the user the access needed.  You will have to log the user out and back in again for the changes to take effect.  Have a look at these answers for some pretty good instructions:\nHow can I create an administrator user from the command line?\n\nA: To answer the general question some programs use mechanisms that use polkit to screen for root privileges rather than using the /etc/sudoers approach. (For example, gparted, as I recall). The sudo command uses /etc/sudo and/etc/sudoers.d/* so be sure to check each file. LDAP can conceivably be used to source information, by the way.\nMy system is 12.04 and my sudo-capable accounts are in the sudo group. My pertinent polkit files are /etc/polkit-1/localauthority.conf.d/50-localauthority.conf and /etc/polkit-1/localauthority.conf.d/51-ubuntu-admin.conf. Yours may be different.\n\nI assume you realize that if the sudoers file says %sudo that means user must be in the sudo group. I assume, but don't know, that a long lasting credential might persist after a policy (or group) change. I would think you would know if this had been done, however.\nTo pursue further I suggest that you post the contents of the /etc/sudoers and the files in /etc/sudoers.d/ and under the tree /etc/polkit-1/ and tell us what groups the two userids are added to. I don't believe there are any passwords or hashes in the files I'm mentioning.\n", "Q: How can I check disk usage using ssh? We have an ssh server on Ubuntu and we want a disk usage report using ssh of whole network.Is there any utility, command, or script available to accomplish this?\n\nA: You can use df -h to see the free space, used space, and total space of all partitions on the system.\n\nA: Are you wanting to see the disk usage on the SSH remotely? As in, \"log in to SSH server and then show the disk usage\"?\nIf so...\nssh user@host \"df -h\"\n\nThat's assuming you have key logins enabled so it doesn't prompt you for a password.\n\nA: ssh to your  host then:\nto show all folder sizes for the current directory recursively, with their sizes:\ndu -h\n\nIf you run this from a high-level directory, it can take a while to complete.\nShow a disk use summary for the current directory:\ndu -sh\n\nAgain, this can take a little while if you're running it in a high-level directory.\n", "Q: Is Ubuntu elder-friendly? My parents HDD in their laptop broke so i decided to change it. The laptop won't somehow install the original OS even though I have the disk. So I want to know if Ubuntu is elder-friendly since it is my parents that will use the laptop most.\nPS. my parents are quicklearners :)\nThanks.\n\nA: Ubuntu is believed to be one of the most user friendly debian distro of Linux (of course people might debate that Linux Mint is friendlier).  Still Linux avoiders argue that it is still no way closer to Windows in terms of user friendliness. People often misinterpret the term user friendly with user familiarity.\nIn Ubuntu all the applications are integrated seamlessly as if they are one unit. Everything can be connected inside Ubuntu. They’re stable, lightweight, and almost infinitely customizable. Ubuntu has a rich GUI ( compiz package). In addition to this there are two tools to work with the command line and the GUI.\nAutomatic update of all the software, more support through the Ubuntu Forums (with around 600,000 members and the default chat room generally having about 1500 people), automatic defragging in the background and ram caching, multiple workspaces, operation almost exactly like XP, Vista or Mac (as per user choice), easy installation and special effects like wobbly windows, 3D cubes etc make Ubuntu more friendlier than ever.\nHowever Ubuntu’s own repository for most of the software you will need, drivers for almost any kind of device from many vendor, excellent crash recovery, support to read and write NTFS drives, full support for MS office files including docx are some points which suggest that we ought to give Ubuntu a try. \nAs, a conclusion i cany say yes it's elder-friendly and it deserver to learn and try\n\nA: Yes it is.\nI can tell from my own experience having installed Ubuntu 10.04 on my mother's (age 75) laptop 2 years ago. She did not have any computer experience before - this might have been an advantage here. She now is able to write E-mails, surf the Internet, write letters, manage pictures from her digital camera. She doesn't do much more.\nSteps I did to make sure I was not lost when helping:\n\n*\n\n*Made the PC accessible remotely. This involved setting up a Dyndns account on her router, installing open-ssh server to give me remote access for support, and a remote desktop application (here x11vnc but Teamviewer will do that too).\n\n\n*Made sure security backups install in the background.\n\n\n*Set up a browser-based e-mail account to avoid disadvantages that may arise from an additional e-mail client.\nIn the first months I had to log me in every now then to show her how to do things but now I haven't for a long time.\n", "Q: Install OpenOffice for headless use The question very simple and short.

Here is an answer I posted that details how to do that: Share Ext4 Partition Over Network\nOnce configured, you should be able to connect to your Samba share from Windows 7 by opening a file explorer window and typing the following into the address bar:\n\\\\192.168.0.101\\myShareName\n\nObviously, replace the 192.168.0.101 with the (internal) IP address of your Ubuntu machine.  Also replace myShareName with the name of the share you have configured in Samba.\nNow that Samba is configured and reachable, download and install the Ubuntu One Windows client.  If you don't have an Ubuntu One account, you can create one during the installation process or by following this link: Ubuntu One - Create Account.  Once the client is installed and has connected to the Ubuntu One cloud, open it and you should see something similar to this:\n\nNote that you can see the file explorer for my Samba share in the background.\nBy default, Ubuntu One will create a sync'd directory in the following location on your windows drive (represented here as \"x:\").  Unless your Windows installation is configured otherwise, it will probably be \"c:\".\nx:\\Users\\%username%\\Ubuntu One\n\nNow, anything you copy down from your Ubuntu server (via your Samba share) to your Ubuntu One directory will be replicated to the Ubuntu One cloud.  If you wish, you can also configure the Ubuntu One client to sync additional directories.  This data will be replicated to all machines running an Ubuntu One client that are connected to your account.\n", "Q: i cant find grub page in my laptop \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I repair grub?

In the default configuration the standalone dnsmasq will forward queries to NM-dnsmasq which forwards queries off-machine, as determined by NetworkManager.\nThe answer to the question \"How can I change the dnsmasq or network manager...\" is that you can't make the desired change in Precise without recompiling NetworkManager. In Quantal, the NetworkManager-controlled dnsmasq can be configured via files in /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/.\n", "Q: How do I install and use voice commands?

I would like to use a script to find out the username - of the user who is currently on the physical console (who has command of the keyboard, mouse and graphical display)? \nI do not just want to know who runs X (as the current console can be switched to another terminal and another user).\n\nTo clarify:\nCommands like w, who etc. show who is logged at which terminal. This is simple. I would like to know, however, who owns currently the physical console (display, keyboard etc.). For example, if two users run displays :0 and :1, and I can switch between the displays with ctrl+alt+7 and ctrl+alt+8, I would like to know which user currently has the connection between his or her display and the actual, physical screen.\n\nOne more clarification:\n I am not interested in knowing my own username. I have a script, running as another user or root, that needs to know who uses the physical display. There can be several X sessions running by different users, some of them virtualized, some of them connected to a remote X server, but I am only interested in the one that is actually displaying output on the monitor.\n\nYet another clarification:\n Whatever the command is, the output must be different after pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 (switching to another virtual console).\n\nA: I'm afraid I can't give you a specific answer (because I don't know the tech well), but I believe you can find it out using D-Bus and ConsoleKit.\nFor example, when I switch from X to a VT and back, I get this listening on dbus-monitor:\n$ dbus-monitor --system | grep ConsoleKit\nsignal sender=:1.16 -> dest=(null destination) serial=19039 path=/org/freedesktop/ConsoleKit/Session2; interface=org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit.Session; member=ActiveChanged\nsignal sender=:1.16 -> dest=(null destination) serial=19040 path=/org/freedesktop/ConsoleKit/Seat1; interface=org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit.Seat; member=ActiveSessionChanged\nsignal sender=:1.16 -> dest=(null destination) serial=19041 path=/org/freedesktop/ConsoleKit/Session2; interface=org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit.Session; member=ActiveChanged\nsignal sender=:1.16 -> dest=(null destination) serial=19042 path=/org/freedesktop/ConsoleKit/Seat1; interface=org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit.Seat; member=ActiveSessionChanged\n   string \"/org/freedesktop/ConsoleKit/Session2\"\n\nSpecifically, you could use the GetActiveSession method.  Here's how with dbus-send (may require sudo):\n$ dbus-send --system --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit /org/freedesktop/ConsoleKit/Seat1 org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit.Seat.GetActiveSession\n\nThen, depending on your application, you'll want to check out the returned object's properties, which should be an object path to a Session.\n\nA: [geek@atremis ~]$ w\n\n 20:02:02 up 2 days,  8:37,  3 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.00\n\nUSER     TTY      FROM              LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT\n\ngeek     tty1     :0               Thu11    2days 35.11s  0.18s pam: gdm-passwo\n\ngeek     pts/0    athena           Fri22   21:04m  0.03s  0.03s -bash\n\ngeek     pts/1    blackbeauty      20:02    0.00s  0.14s  0.10s w\n\n[geek@atremis ~]$\n\nYou can use the w command to see who is logged on.

I am trying to move my PPPoE dialling from my router to two machines on that router, a Windows 7 and an Ubuntu 12.04 machine. (Actually one machine with dual boot for now).\nI set up a DSL (PPPoE) connection using the Edit Connections dialogue, and while I am connected to the router via cable, the DSL connection is available and works, but as soon as I disconnect the cable, and connect to the wlan (the wifi AP is part of the router), the DSL connection is no longer visible. I need to dial the PPPoE using the wifi to connect my PC to the router. How should I do this?\nMy router is a a Billion 400G, set to Full Bridge. My Windows PPPoE connection works fine, cable or wifi, so the device is capable. This video - suggests I need to use pppoeconf to create the DSL connection while connected over wifi. I'll try that asap. \n\nA: Obviously, it is at least funny question if I right understand where this intended :)\nIt can be missed LAN cord for example ... ok.\nI suggest to clear your DSL(PPPoE) settings which you created through Edit Connections dialogue. Then reset your DSL router, and connect to him through your Ubuntu Wireless like to the default Wireless Network, by default IP. Next, just you will need configure your router through router's interface.\nDefaults, like the default wireless network SSID for your router you can find at official website.

I connected an external monitor as a second display. The laptop stands under the external screen. The laptop has a native resolution of 1440x900 (16:10), the external monitor 1280x1024 (5:4). There are two graphic adapters: one internal Intel GMA 4500 MHD and an discrete ATI card. Currently, the integrated Intel is enabled.  \nI use the Displays application to arrange the position of the monitors so it look like this:\n\nThe problem:\nWhenever I restart my computer the configuration gets lost. First, the displays are mirrored instead of extended. I have to press Fn + F7 two times to switch to extended mode. Second, the Displays settings still look like this:\n\nI know this worked once when I was running Ubuntu 10.10. I cannot tell since when it does not work. Do you know how I can permanently store the settings?\n\nSometimes when I start Ubuntu and press Fn + F7 nothing happens. When I open Displays I and position the external screen above and press the \"Apply\" button nothing happens. Then, after a minute or so the settings apply suddenly. Do you know if there is a log file which could help to analyse the behavior?\n\nA: There are 2 basic approaches you can take. The first is to utilize randr which will allow you to create one large virtual display in which you can position your monitors. The second is to utilize xinerama which will allow you to have 2 separate X screens which will function as one large display. I will cover both here and you can decide which is more appropriate for your needs.\n\n\n\nRandR - Resize and Rotate\nYou can dynamically enable dual head by using XRandR\nxrandr --output foo --above bar\n\nThere is also a gui frontend for this called arandr which is in the 12.04 repos, but it would seem that you want a more static configuration.\nIt could be as simple as creating /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-monitor.conf with the contents:\nSection \"Monitor\"\n  Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n  Identifier     \"Monitor1\"\n  Option         \"Above\" \"Monitor0\" \nEndSection\n\nThis method implies an randr setup. There are some notable drawbacks if using xrandr with monitors of different resolutions. Windows may be improperly placed, there may be black areas on one screen, etc..\nWhen you run xrandr without command line options you can find out which Identifier you need to use in your 10-monitor.conf. Then restart Ubuntu to see if the settings are loaded.\n\n\nXinerama\nTo enable xinerama you need to modify /etc/X11/xorg.conf:\n\nSection \"ServerFlags\"\n  Option    \"Xinerama\" \"true\"\nEndSection\n\nIt might be as simple as that as X is pretty good about automagically configuring things based on hardware detection. But, if simply turning the xinerama extension on does not provide the functionality you desire, you may opt to fully configure X to use xinerama. There are a few ways to configure X. You could have multiple files in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/, some for your monitors, some for the devices, etc. I will cover having a single xorg.conf file that contains all the settings using a modified version of my current setup.\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"DualHead\"\n    Screen      0  \"Screen0\" 0 0\n    Screen      1  \"Screen1\" Above \"Screen0\"\n    Option         \"Xinerama\" \"1\"                # You can specify xinerama here\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device0\"                     # A Device section for each monitor\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"                      # Specify the driver to use\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"GeForce GT 430\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:1:0:0\"                   # Use lspci | grep VGA to find BusID\n    Screen          0                            # Do note the screen number\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device1\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"GeForce GT 430\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:1:0:0\"\n    Screen          1                            # Do note the screen number\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"Gateway HX2000\"\n    HorizSync       31.0 - 83.0\n    VertRefresh     56.0 - 76.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"Monitor1\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"DELL 1907FPV\"\n    HorizSync       30.0 - 81.0\n    VertRefresh     56.0 - 76.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen0\"\n    Device         \"Device0\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen1\"\n    Device         \"Device1\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor1\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\nEndSection\n\nObviously you will need to modify this to suit your hardware, but the basic skeleton is there for you.\nDo note that I have recently read that Intel might have issues with xinerama. You may find yourself needing to utilize your discrete graphics card.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this will work but it's worth a try: Disable the intel; enable the ati; install proprietary ati/amd drivers; configure the dual-monitor desktop how you want it; verify the configuration in the amd catalyst software (admin); check that your setup is now persistent.  I have a desktop, but using the catalyst tool was the only way I was able to keep my dual-monitor setup persistent.\n\nA: You can manually set the multiple monitor setting in ~/.xprofile.\nFor example, to set permanently extra monitor to the left side of main monitor I type in my ~/.xprofile as follows:\nxrandr --output VGA1 --left-of LVDS1\n\nAll information is provided from the Ubuntu wiki here:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution\n", "Q: Damaged external NTFS hard disk A few days ago, I used my external hard disk (a 2TB Seagate) in order to transfer some files on Windows Vista.

I was afraid, but I tried to access my files and it seemed to be working. I tried to open a movie (from the external disk) but it couldn't load. I thought of restarting, but this took sooo long...

I'm trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 with full hard disk encryption.\nAfter downloading and installing the Ubuntu live CD, I learned that truecrypt doesn't support full disk encryption on Linux. I also learned that the best way to get \"nearly full disk encryption\" on Ubuntu is by installing it from the alternate install CD.\nI tried that, but something is wrong with my CD reader/burner so it doesnt boot up when i insert the cd.\nMy thought here was to take the .iso that I downloaded on my unencrypted Ubuntu system, use Unetbootin to make the usb drive.\nThe usb drive used for this is exactly the same brand as one that I know has worked with a previous ubuntu live system on the same computer. I also used unetbootin for that usb, but I created it from windows that time.\nThe usb stick boots up fine and i get through the first couple of steps in the installation process. However, After a while I get a \"box\" with the following error message\n\n\"Load Installer components from CD\"\nThere was a problem reading data from the CD-ROM. Please make sure it is in the drive. If retrying does not work, you should check the integrity of your CD-ROM.\n\"Failed to copy file from CD-ROM. Retry?\"\n\nThen I can't get any further.\nI googled a lot and found this page which seems to tackle this very problem:\nI tried to do what it said. After pressing TAB, I wrote:\ncdrom-detect/try-usb=true\n\nwithout quotes because that's what I think is right.\nWhen I press TAB, there already is a text saying:\n/ubnkern initrd=/ubninit vga=788 -- quiet\n\nwhich can be removed. I have tried to both delete the text before the -- and just inserting cdrom-detect/try-usb=true before it.\nAny idea of what can be wrong? I would like to do a full system encryption, or as full as it is possible. I don't want to just encrypt my /home folder. Maybe this isn't the easiest way.\nI use SanDisk usb sticks. I know there is a problem with U3 launcher on some SanDisks, but I never had to remove U3 before from similar disks, and the alternate install does boot up, so I dont think using U3 removal would help me.\nAny help or indication to an easier way to do this would be appreciated.\n\nA: If you are writing the iso from Windows I have found that using Win32 Disk Imager instead of Universal-USB-Installer avoids the cdrom not detected issue. \nIf you don't do it that way then this workaround works: http://www.mattkowalczyk.com/blog/?p=169\n\nA: I had a similar issue when installing Ubuntu server from usb where the installation couldn't mount the CD-ROM to install files. The fix that worked for me was as follows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal\n\n*Plug your usb drive into your pc.\n\n*Type sudo fdisk -l\n\n*Make note of the usb drive mount point.\n\n*Sudo umount (usb drive partition, I.E. /dev/sdb1, /dev/sdc1, etc)\n\n*Run sudo dd if=(Img file location) of=(usb drive location, /dev/sdb, do no include the partition number.\nThen reboot and boot off the media. You should have no issues.\n\nA: I believe you should have merged the extra text with the existing line rather than replacing it. So, in the end you would have:\n/ubnkern initrd=/ubninit vga=788 cdrom-detect/try-usb=true -- quiet\n\nNote that on my machine, the line looked quite different:\n/install/vmlinuz initrd=/install/initrd.gz file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.see vga=788  cdrom-detect/try-usb=true quiet --\n\n\nA: Try checking this link on post #2 by spin-dizzy. To get the sd[abcd] of the USB stick, unplug it and re-plug it right before looking at the syslog.\nIt worked for me after the cdrom-detect/try-usb=true thing didn't.\n\nA: Check http://cirrus.ucsd.edu/~pierce/fix_ubuntu_usb/.\nThere is a script that fixes truncated names in the USB.\n", "Q: How to find what program woke the computer up? Something is waking my computer automatically from hibernate every morning. How can I find what program that is? Alternatively, how can I disable/prohibit all such wakeups?\n(I presume it's through rtcwake or a similar mechanism.)\n\nA: Nothing is automatically waking your computer up from hibernate. If your computer is in the hibernate state, it is actually powered off. The only way to turn it back on, is to push the power button.\nIf you mean from suspend, then most likely it is a configuration in your BIOS. There are no active programs running while the computer is in suspend mode. It's possible though, that your BIOS is configured to wake on LAN activity as well as keyboard or other events, and possibly something is making a network request to your computer, dialing the modem, or your cat is jumping onto the keyboard.\n", "Q: How can I find the binary that is executed when entering a command?

I used WUBI. Its installed in a partition of a drive that mainly has a Windows 7 install.\nAfter several problems I realized mount.ntfs was often taking above 90% of the CPU which caused the system to hang / become unresponsive etc. \nI did some research and I saw that the ntfs-3g driver has some bugs. I also read that WUBI was not a good medium to install ubuntu.\nMy questions are:\n1) if wubi is not reliable why is it promoted so heavily on the website?\n2) Would installing another distribution or even FreeBSD work better?\n3) Would installing Ubuntu on an external drive of the file system type that Linux works with solve the problem? \n\nA: Regarding wubi itself is not a problem, and installation is not a problem, reason behind the wubi to under perform is that when you had windows and started installing ubuntu from windows, you will store it on ntfs drive which is windows file system where ubuntu has different type of filesystem, so converting the file system form ntfs to ext4 filesystem takes processing power therefore mount.ntfs takes up that CPU power. if you had installed ubuntu normally you would not have mount.ntfs at all and normal system behavior.  wubi was designed for people that want to start experimenting ubuntu while keeping windows OS data untouched. \n\n\n*\n\n*wubi is reliable when you think of it, it did its job, it installed\nubuntu with windows and  configured grup so that you choose between\nOS, and note that wubi will be discontinued in future releases.\n\n*installing another Linux system you would need to delete\npartition/shrink partition  from windows then install the linux\ndistribution on it.\n\n*installing it on external drive would make it slower, reason is the\ni/o r/w operations will go trough USB/Network which is slower.\n\n\nThat said, its up to you to choose what you need best.\n", "Q: youtube-dl is not working I am using youtube-dl to download some videos from youtube.

Use the following to update youtube-dl until the package system gets the updated version:\nsudo youtube-dl -U\n\nUpdate\nAs noted by sup in the comments youtube-dl is patched in Ubuntu to disable the --update option because of security concerns (the bugreport is here). It is also argued in the bugreport that youtube-dl is a moving target, so the version in the repositories is often out of date. This makes easy upgrade a necessity.\nEasy upgrade is still possible with e.g. pip.

I think the main difference is the buffer size. By CIFS I use 1MB buffer size, by GVFS you cannot set the buffer size as far as I know. I checked the code https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/gvfs, but I am not a C expert. According to it the max is 64KB buffer size the GVFS SMB implementation can handle. By the copy from SMB to the same SMB drive the buffer size was given manually and it was only 4KB. By the other parts it was injected from an upper abstraction level I did not check. It is a big lib. I suspect that GVFS uses only 4KB buffer size by default. I tried a CIFS mount with 64KB buffer size and it had the same speed as with the 1MB buffer size. I wait for the Gnome guys to confirm this and/or fix it somehow.

Also, it would be very nice to prevent any window, even those not maximized from entering this part of the screen. \nIf anyone knows how to make this happen, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nA: Parts of this answer comes from: I'd like to prevent maximize from covering one third of the screen\n\nMaximumize may be useful for that case instead of Maximize. Which is\n  included in the CompizConfig Settings Manager and will \"Maximumize\n  windows (resize them to fit the available screenspace)\"\nIn your case, Maximumize will fit the window's size in order to use\n  the maximum available screen space in the active work space and this\n  way, windows in screen containing the pidgin, conky, and other\n  window-like applications will be dodged by the Maximumized window.\n\nMaximumize comes from the compiz-fusion-plugins-extra package.\nGood luck!\nBTW: You may need to set your own key bindings in order to make this work. I used [Alt]+M and it works fine for me.\n\n\n\nA: You can enable Window rules plugin in CCSM\n\nIn the 'Above' match add the terminal application you are using \n\nThis will keep the terminal always on top of any other window.

There is not even a shadow along the left side of the screen when I move my mouse there.\nHow can I fix it? I have to go into ccsm and change the launcher to \"never\" hide, to bring the launcher back.\n\nA: Open the Unity Dash (maybe by pressing the super (Windows) key, since your launcher is broken) and search \"appearance.\" Open that up and go to the tab that is labelled \"Behavior\" and put the reveal sensitivity all the way to the right (high).

Everything but the rails s in a terminal, perhaps?\nI've looked at Startup Applications, and my postgresql command (including 'sudo') is in there, but I still have to manually start the postgresql server, so I'm not sure how/if that tool works.\nThanks!\n\nA: I'm not great at such things, but here are some ideas on where to start looking.\nMost of this is probably overkill for your situation, so concentrate on suggestions #2 and #4.  This is especially important if you need something running in the foreground, because the other two suggestions don't have an associated foreground.\nSince you did mention the magic word, \"server\", the other two options may be worth considering as well.\n1) When Linux boots it goes through one or more run levels to get running.  (What run level does what varies a bit from distro to distro.)  Each run level has a set of scripts that are executed when the run level starts.  The scripts themselves live in /etc/init.d.  Each run level has a directory /etc/rcx.d where x is the run level 0 - 6.  I think 3 is for normal up and running, but you'll have to check.\nIn each of these directories, you put symlinks to your scripts that are in /etc/init.d and you name them starting with a two digit number prefix.  When the run level starts, all the scripts in its directory are executed in order by the prefix numbers so that things happen in a predictable, orderly manner.  Add a link (with a high number prefix so it gets executed after everything else that's already there) to your script into rc3.d (or whatever the right run level is for your system).\nIf you want to get fancy, there's a file called skeleton in /etc/init.d that show you a bit about all the bells and whistles that are available. E.g.  You can write you script as a big case statement with a case for START, STOP, etc. and symlink it in the appropriate run levels to start your program and then shut it down when the system is shutting down.  If you do this, the symlink you add to the shutdown run levels should have a low numeric prefix so it gets done before everything else it may need has been shut down.\nLook at the PATH notes in skeleton.  The paths you have available during run level changes are very restricted, so you don't have access to everything.\nIf you go this route, make backups and have a live CD, etc. ready in case you do something that breaks the boot sequence.\n2) When bash starts up on your user (usually, once per session), it runs ~/.profile which is itself a bash script that can run whatever you want for your particular user.\nWhen an individual bash shell is started (can happen many times per session), another script, ~/.bashrc is also executed.  You can run your script from either of these as appropriate.  It's a lot closer to what you normally would do in a terminal, so it's a lot easier and safer to do.\nSince things run this way are associated with your user, they will terminate when you log out unless you do special things like using nohup in your scripts.\n3) You can store your script somewhere in system land like /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin and set up cron to run it by adding an entry into either the system crontab or your user's crontab.\nIf your system stays up a lot, you should add a check in your script so it doesn't do anything extra if another instance of it is already running or has run since the last boot.\nIf you use a notebook or other system that gets turned off frequently, make sure anacron is installed and working.  Shortly after boot, it (over simplified) looks at cron activities to see if any were missed while the system was off and runs them.  Usually, scheduling things to run shortly after midnight simplifies things so that it's less likely something will get run twice in the same day.\n4) If you use a gui desktop like kde or gnome, they have startup script utilities that will run things for you.  kde puts them in $HOME/.kde/Autostart.  You can put your script there.  \nThe same considerations apply that were noted in suggestion #2.\n\nA: Create your own shell script file and paste your startup code (which you always write on terminal) to your shell script file source code:\n#!/bin/sh\nsudo /etc/init.d/postgresql start \nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start\ncd sites/name_of_rails_app\nbundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start\nbundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start RAILS_ENV=test\nrails s\n\nAnd then put this shell script somewhere and add its filepath to your $PATH. And then open your Terminal and write your shell script's filename and press ENTER.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 hotkeys not working properly A couple of weeks ago, I ran a distribution upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10. Unfortunately, something has seemed to happen with the hotkeys on the system. At first, I thought that maybe this was just a glitch with the global hotkeys. That didn't turn out to be the case, as the custom hotkey I added into the Ubuntu settings works for my editor.\nThe only default hotkey that seems to have a problem launching is CTRL+ALT+T (Terminal). This wasn't such a big issue to begin with, because I can always just drag the Terminal to my launcher and launch it from there. However, I was on Chrome earlier and tried to do SHIFT+CTRL+DEL to clear the history and it failed. I then tried to do SHIFT+ESC, just to see if the hotkey for the task manager would work.. and it did.\nI also thought it could be something with the \"CTRL\" key, since SHIFT+ESC works, but SHIFT+CTRL+DEL doesn't. That didn't turn out to be the case either, as keys like CTRL+ALT+DEL (logout) work perfectly fine.\nNot quite sure how to go about this, and I haven't found any errors in any of /var/log that raises any suspicion.\n\nA: This is a known problem in 12.10. I made a bug report here:   \nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/1058486\nwhich talks about the problem but this is still a development version of Ubuntu so we need to wait until the final release to see if this issue is solved.\n", "Q: How do I install GNU Readline?

It seems redshift doesn't run without an active internet connection. If so, is there some way it could be run when there's no connection to the Internet?\n\nA: The answer is yes. Redshift requires active Internet connection. It depends on libgeoclue0 package which fetch geo location from Internet.\n$ apt-cache depends redshift \nredshift\n  Depends: libc6\n  Depends: libgconf2-4\n  Depends: libgeoclue0\n  Depends: libglib2.0-0\n  Depends: libx11-6\n  Depends: libxcb-randr0\n  Depends: libxcb1\n  Depends: libxxf86vm1\n\nYou can also verify this by running redshift from terminal. The terminal will display messages like \nStarted Geoclue provider `Geoclue Master'.\nUsing provider `geoclue'.\nAccording to the geoclue provider we're at: 22.36, 91.80\nUsing method `randr'.\n\nWhich suggests,  it is using Internet.\nBut, if you start redshift from terminal without Internet connection, the terminal will display these kinds of messages:\nStarted Geoclue provider `Geoclue Master'.\nUsing provider `geoclue'.\nCould not get location (3 retries left): Geoclue master client has no usable Position providers.\nUnable to get location from provider.\n\n\nA: Update: Please note that a fix is now on its way. You can either wait until it arrives in the official repositories or apply it yourself by following the advice in post #53 and on in the bug report. \n\nAs Anwar pointed out, Redshift fetches its geolocation data online by default. There is a workaround, though:\nManual configuration of geolocation data\n\na.) Using a config file\nFrom the project's homepage:\n\nRedshift will look for a configuration file in “~/.config/redshift.conf”.

To be more specific, instead of working as a right click it works like a normal left click.\nI did already find a solution for the Lenovo U310 by creating a 51-synaptics.conf file in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d which looks as follows:\nSection \"InputClass\"\nIdentifier \"Default clickpad buttons\"\nMatchDriver \"synaptics\"\nOption \"SoftButtonAreas\" \"50% 0 82% 0 0 0 0 0\"\n\nOption \"LockedDrags\" \"1\"\nOption \"BottomEdge\" \"4000\"\nOption \"AreaBottomEdge\" \"4445\"\n\nEndSection\n\nThe solution has been found over at the Ubuntuforums\nUsing that code however led to the right-click working only when clicking the touchpad at a very specific spot which was too small to hit reliably.\nI am fairly sure that the config file merely needs a little tweaking, however I have no idea on what to do, so any suggestions or solutions would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Try changing the value\nOption \"SoftButtonAreas\" \"50% 0 82% 0 0 0 0 0\"\nto \nOption \"SoftButtonAreas\" \"50% 100% 82% 0 0 0 0 0\"\nThis should make the whole bottom right half act as the right button.\n", "Q: Prevent Encfs reverse mode from including other filesystems? I would like to use Encfs to encrypt a copy of / for a backup by using the reverse option and then running my backup tool on the virtual, encrypted filesystem. Whenever I back up  through other tools (rsync for example), they have an option to not cross filesystem boundaries. \nIs there an equivalent option in Encfs? Or would such attributes pass through to the encrypted version, and I should just run my backup tool with the one filesystem option?\n\nA: I have been looking for an answer to the same question, and I am afraid the answer is nope, this is not (yet) possible with encfs.\nThe closest I found was this bug report: https://code.google.com/p/encfs/issues/detail?id=9\nencfsctl encode is also capable of encrypting single files, but that's an overkill for excluding other filesystems (or even single files).\n\nA: I think you can remount root, somewhere else (with out its sub-mounts. Then run encfs on that. \nsudo mount --bind / root\n\nwill mount / onto directory root, with no sub-mounts. You can then use encfs in reverse mode to do what you want.\nNote however that it is a lot of effort to encrypt and backup the files that are in your distros repositories. You could consider other alternatives: back up etc (use etc-keeper and backup the repo). Look into good backup policies for backing up Unix machines, there is good separation between what needs backing up, and what you can get from your distributor's CDs, and what changes so frequently that a backup will be out of date (so other measures are needed).\n", "Q: Problems installing on Pentium 4 I'm trying to load Ubuntu onto an old pentium 4 pc.

Any unknown MAC addresses which attempt to get an address via DHCP will be logged as denied.\nYou can specify a dynamic address range to allocate to unknown addresses. These won't be static though, so any MAC which connects multiple times won't necessarily have the same IP. However, simply not allowing dynamic IP allocation, and only using static IPs for known MAC addresses is the easiest/best solution to what (I think) you are asking.\nIf it is WiFi, look into using the built-in MAC filtering on your access points or routers. If it is for wired ethernet, then you'll need to build a bit more complex firewall rules to deal with it. Though, for some things, these too can simply be subverted.\n\nA: You probably want to have a firewall filter to only allow specific internet access. something like this:\n\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m mac --mac-source \"Mac_address\" -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -m mac --mac-source \"Mac_address\" -j ACCEPT\nsudo iptables -A INPUT -j DROP\n\nOrder matters above. Allow before to deny.\nThis was taken and modified from the following: filtering MAC address in ufw and also: IptablesHowTo. Please read these websites.\nYour DHCP server is not a firewall and mostly manages how to hand out IP info, it's related information, and supplemental path to clients if they want it. Thank you.

I'm trying to dual boot Ubuntu 12.04 on my MacBook (which is a Mid 2007 model with Intel Core 2 dual and currently running Lion). \nI've burned the Ubuntu desktop ISO file to a 4.7GB DVD, installed rEFIt, and partitioned my hard disk to make room for Ubuntu, but when I put in the DVD and then reboot, the rEFIt menu shows only the \"boot from Mac OS X\" option instead of asking me whether to boot from CD. Holding down the key \"C\" or the option key doesn't help either. \nCould you explain how to fix this problem and get the laptop to boot from the DVD properly?\n\nA: My understanding is that the standard Ubuntu install disc has problems booting on Macs. The easiest solution is to try a Mac-specific variant, which ironically only boots in BIOS mode. (Intel-based Macs use EFI firmware with a BIOS emulation layer, and Linux has long supported EFI booting.) The result will be an installation that will have to boot in BIOS mode unless and until you change that.\nAnother option is to force the issue by fiddling around with boot managers and boot loaders. It's possible that installing the ISO-9660 driver from rEFInd so that rEFIt can read it will do the trick; in theory, that should make Ubuntu's on-CD boot loader visible to rEFIt. (You could optionally replace rEFIt with rEFInd, too, but that's not required.) If this doesn't work, then forcing an EFI-mode boot is likely to be much more complicated, and I don't have step-by-step instructions handy.\n", "Q: Info on installing \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I install software or packages without Internet (offline)? \n\nI was thinking of installing Ubuntu on one of my computers for a test run to see how I like it, but the problem I face is that the one computer I wish to install it on isn't network ready. \nThere's no network card installed and I keep that computer as a safe computer away from any network connections. \nThe question I have is that is there an ISO I could download that contains all the necessary files for upgrading it to current, similar to the way one would download and install Windows Services Packs offline? \nI realize the convenience of doing this online, but what would one do if they don't have an Internet connection \n\nA: Since Ubuntu 12.04.1 was recently released, it will contain most of the updates.

I am in a research and a step of it is to create a ppa to add academic files. Due the very low speed internet and the impossibility of transforming ppas hosted in launchpad into public, it must be hosted in the local server. I have tried to follow a tutorial from 2009, but no success. Can someone help me on it?\n\nA: This is not going to be easy.\nAs far as I can tell the usage of PPA's is launchpad.net only. So there is no PPA server.\nFrom: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas\n\nPersonal Package Archives (PPA) allow you to upload Ubuntu source packages to be built and published as an apt repository by Launchpad. You can find out more about PPAs and how to use them in our help page.\n\nSo to answer your question: you will need to run your own Launchpad instance. Lucky for your there is a very lengthy article on this here.\nFrom the link some important notes:\n\nBuilding and running Launchpad requires a computer running Ubuntu. The production Launchpad.net site runs on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. Developers mostly run 10.04 LTS, 11.10 or 12.04 LTS, but others may work.\nThe recommended development configuration is Ubuntu 12.04 LTS or later running Launchpad in an LXC container to minimise its impact on the wider system.\nNote: the changes introduced by the install script may break your current web development setup, so it is advisable to try Launchpad in a virtual machine or an LXC container, as described above.\n\n\nAlso have a look at Does anyone have experience with a private Launchpad instance?\n\nA: A ppa repository is simply (approximately) a APT repository that is managed by launchpad server.\nAs an alternative, if you don't want to set up a launchpad server (that isn't easy), you could simply make an apt repository, that is more easy and permit you to distribute your packages privately.\nYou can see other questions about that in askubuntu - How to set up an apt repository.\nAnd from that question, you can follow this guide on how to make a repository. See that you have two options, a simple (easy to follow but no so automatic for users) and an advanced (complex but easy to use for users).\n", "Q: How to highlight items on Desktop using xfce? Im using xfce but the text of the symbols on my desktop are not underlined by a colour, which means I can rarely see them (Black on dark-blue).\n-> like home and trash\nHow to enable the background of the text?\n\nA: You can consult this link: Hidden Options and look at the section reproduced below:\nThe colors of the icon text and the icon text background, as well as the\nopacity of the icon text background, can be customized by putting directives\nsimilar to the following in your ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file:\n\n\nstyle \"xfdesktop-icon-view\" {\n\n    XfdesktopIconView::label-alpha = 75\n    base[NORMAL] = \"#00ff00\"\n    base[SELECTED] = \"#5050ff\"\n    base[ACTIVE] = \"#0000ff\"\n\n    fg[NORMAL] = \"#ff0000\"\n    fg[SELECTED] = \"#ff0000\"\n    fg[ACTIVE] = \"#ff0000\"\n}\nwidget_class \"*XfdesktopIconView*\" style \"xfdesktop-icon-view\"\n\n\nThe first entry sets the opacity of the rounded text background. The three \n“base” entries set the text background color, and the three “fg” entries \nset the text color.\n\nThe “NORMAL” entries set the color for the regular, unselected state. The \n“SELECTED” entries set the color for when the icon is selected, and the\ndesktop has keyboard focus. The “ACTIVE” entries set the color for when \nthe icon is selected, but the desktop does not have keyboard focus. \n\n(If you don't have a hidden text file called .gtkrc-2.0 in your home folder, create it with a text editor and put what is recommended above in there. Obviously, you will have to choose colors of background and text that are compatible with your wallpaper, if any. Most operating systems come with a color chooser. I use gcolor2 from the Ubuntu Software Center.)\n\nRecent versions of Greybird, which I think is the default theme in Xubuntu, now have a section in /usr/share/themes/Greybird/gtk-2.0/gtkrc which can be tweaked instead of ~/.gtkrc-2.0. Just search for  style \"xfdesktop-icon-view\". (Greybird is included in shimmer-themes.) \n", "Q: Error Message when starting Update: Failed to load the package list Message says:  \nFailed to load the package list\n\nThis is a serious problem.

I unfortunately can't, since the update manager closes each time I get the error. \nAny other way to remove that package?\n\nA: Open update manager, click on settings, open the \"other software\" tab, delete the ppa.launchpad.net/madman2k/ubuntu entry.  Try again.\nThis usually happens when the ppa is no longer required and has been removed, or if it not available or required for a new Ubuntu release.\n\nA: This problem is caused because the madman2k user's repositories have been removed from the PPA system. Try vising http://ppa.launchpad.net/madman2k/.\nAll you need to do is remove the line(s) for this PPA in your /etc/apt/sources.list.\nAlso, use sudo apt-add-repository in the future, so that your repositories are added into /etc/apt/sources.d/. This way, you can remove an invalid repository such as this one with just sudo apt-add-repository -r ppa:madman2k/ubuntu.\n", "Q: Difference between using `add-apt-repository` and adding a link to the sources.list From a user's point of view, they seem equivalent. \nSome programs can be installed via apt-get install after adding a link to the sources.list. \nOthers have to be installed by adding a ppa though command line, and as far as I can see, this method doesn't create an entry in the sources.list.\nSo there must be a technical difference? And, if at all, what is the difference between a PPA and a repository?\n\nA: Adding via PPA does add a list. file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d, which is sourced by apt so there is a repository there.\nThe convenience that add-apt-repository provides is that it not only adds the source, it adds the GPG key of the repository so you don't have to do that manually. \n\nA: Adding a PPA through command line does create an entry.\nCommand line:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/jupiter\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install jupiter\n\nAfter adding the repository it shows up in Ubuntu Software Center:\n\n", "Q: Added a bridge for VM guest, now the host can't access the internet I've installed KVM and set up bridged networking as per the instructions in this user guide.\nThe guest on the VM seems to be working fine.

Network manager says \"device not managed\"\nSo now the wired connection is managed and the network manager even says that it is connected but it doesn't actually have access to the internet. \n\nA: I figured out the problem. The example in the instructions for setting up the bridge included adding these lines to the /etc/networking/interfaces file: \nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet manual\n\nAfter I changed it to dhcp things started working again.\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\n", "Q: How to enable my WiFi in DELL vostro 1500?

I get an error relating to the webcam it seems when I look in the /var/log/syslogs. I am able to boot from the disc no problem.\nI have seen several suggestions here and elsewhere to use the alternate installer. It appears that the alternate installer does not load up the drivers for secondary monitors, so I am unable to see if any progress is being made or not. Is there a link that contains the steps that the alternate installer goes through ? Or a way to get that installer to load the second screen as well ?\nIt looks like this bug:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/1021449\n\nA: Enter BIOS settings for the Vaio and turn the web cam off.  When you get to the section in the install to select the Avatar, simply click on one of the alternate avatars to the right and continue with the installation.\nSince you don't appear to be able to turn the camera off in BIOS, we could try removing the module for it before you start the install.  Boot up the LiveCD or LiveUSB and select \"try Ubuntu\"  When you get to the desktop open a terminal window and type:\nsudo modprobe -r uvcvideo\n\nThen click \"install\".\nRemoving the generic USB webcam device module should prevent the  install program from trying to use the camera when it gets to the avatar setup page. \n", "Q: music player with audiobook support Hello I'm looking for a nice audio player with audio-book and network support.

I tried to setup iSCSI target and defined root partition as target (that was wrong I know). \nI didn't format the iSCSI device; is it possible to get back the data from this partition? System does not boot at the moment.\n\nA: In theory you could establish a root filesystem in an iSCSI target but you would need to do a good number of things to make that possible.  It seems like you were using the blockio method (raw filesystem).  I suggest you look-up the fileio method as it will be a little safer for you relative to your experience (no offense intended).\nTo get the data back from a raw filesystem (used by iSCSI) you would need to move the disk to a working system, establish an iSCSI target for that partition and then connect to it from any initiator.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 64bit on Acer netbook causes black screen.

If there are brnefits, please elaborate.\n\nA: You will have no real benefits of re-building a kernel, unless there are patches in a newer kernel version which are needed for your hardware, that aren't included in the version you have installed. But in general, there is no good reason to recompile a kernel from what is shipped in the distro.\n\nA: For x86 architectures the kernel provides some CPU specific processor family options, for example for 64 bit builds it provides:\n\n\n*\n\n*Opteron/Athlon64/Hammer/K8\n\n*Intel P4 / older Netburst based Xeon\n\n*Core 2/newer Xeon\n\n*Intel Atom\n\n*Generic-x86-64\n\n\n..so one can select the more appropriate build option if you so desire. For ubuntu, the kernel team uses the generic option.\nIt also depends on which version of GCC you use to build the kernel.  Newer versions of GCC should in theory produce better code than older versions but your mileage may vary.\n", "Q: How to reset darktable I need a way of reseting darktable to its factory settings. \nWith shotwell it is simply a case of deleting the home directory for shotwell, but there doesn't appear to be one for DT under the Darktable name.\n\nA: I believe that the config files for darktable are under ~/.config/darktable.  Usually, deleting the config files will cause them to be regenerated at the next startup.  Any changes you made to the default settings will be lost.\nBefore deleting your config files, though, delete just the Darktable library file (~/.config/darktable/library.db).  This is where Darktable saves information about the images you've imported.  After you delete the library file, Darktable won't know anything about your image collection (and should stop crashing).  You'll have to re-import the photos you want to work with, but happily, the library file is mostly just a cache that speeds up various operations within Darktable.  Darktable saves all important image metadata (including tags, edit history, etc.) in XMP \"sidecar\" files alongside the images themselves.  Hopefully, all you'll lose is a bit of time.\nAlways make a backup of any files you intend to experiment with.\n", "Q: Lugaru HD - sound problems I had purchased Lugaru HD via one of the Humble Bundle deals, but have only just tried to play it.

I need to wait for a specific condition to be met a network interface is considered \"up\". Upstart is sending its net-device-up signal before this condition is met, which cases the scripts that depend on this condition to fail. How do I delay Upstart's net-device-up signal until a condition is met?\n\nA: One solution is to put a script in /etc/network/if-up.d/ that executes before any other if-up.d script and waits for a specific condition to be met or a timeout occurs. For example, here's a script to wait for an non-link-local IPv6 address on an IPv6 interface configured with the \"auto\" method:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nLOG_FILE=\"/tmp/autoipv6.log\"\n\nif [ \"$ADDRFAM\" = \"inet6\" -a \"$METHOD\" = \"auto\" ]; then\n        echo \"Auto method detected, waiting for IP address\" >> $LOG_FILE\n\n        #wait until we have an IP address, or a timeout occurs\n        TIMEOUT=50 #5 second timeout--each iteration sleeps for 1/10th of a second\n        #get the number of addresses, excluding link-local addresses\n        ADDRESS_COUNT=`ip addr show dev eth0 | grep inet6 | grep -v fe80 | wc -l`\n\n        until [ $TIMEOUT -eq 0 ]; do\n                NEW_ADDRESS_COUNT=`ip addr show dev eth0 | grep inet6 | grep -v fe80 | wc -l`\n\n                # break out of the loop if more IPv6 addresses have been assigned\n                # this is implementation is naive: no guarantee is given that the new addresses\n                # are the result of the autoconfiguration request\n                if [ \"$NEW_ADDRESS_COUNT\" -gt \"$ADDRESS_COUNT\" ]; then\n                        echo \"Detected new IP address, exiting\" >> $LOG_FILE\n                        ifconfig >> $LOG_FILE\n                        exit 0;\n                fi\n\n                TIMEOUT=$((TIMEOUT-1))\n                sleep .1\n        done\n\n        echo \"Timeout waiting for IP address\" >> $LOG_FILE\n        exit 1;\nfi\n\nIt's important this \"wait-for-condition\" script run before the if-up.d Upstart script runs (the Upstart if-up.d script is where the net-device-up signals are generated). The if-up.d scripts are executed by run-parts in lexical sort order (the same order as the default output of the ls command), so a simple technique for guaranteeing order is to name the script \"000wait-for-condition\".\n", "Q: Problem with HeeksCAD I cannot make it work, I have no more ideas.

I usually use apt-get update && apt-get upgrade to run my updates and upgrades instead of the GUI because it seems to run more quickly. \nHowever, I've noticed lately that I often get a message that one of my upgrades was held back. I then usually run dist-upgrade to run it through and it works fine. As far as I can tell after reading this question and its answers, dist-upgrade does all the same things and then some. \nSo, my question is: Why use apt-get upgrade at all? Why not use apt-get dist-upgrade all the time? Why does apt-get upgrade even exist?\n\nA: I typically upgrade my machines with:\nsudo apt-get update && time sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nBelow is an excerpt from man apt-get. Using upgrade keeps to the rule: under no circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages not already installed retrieved and installed. If that's important to you, use apt-get upgrade. If you want things to \"just work\", you probably want apt-get dist-upgrade to ensure dependencies are resolved.\nTo expand on why you'd want upgrade instead of dist-upgrade, if you are a systems administrator, you need predictability. You might be using advanced features like apt pinning or pulling from a collection of PPAs (perhaps you have an in-house PPA), with various automations in place to inspect your system and available upgrades instead of always eagerly upgrading all available packages. You would get very frustrated when apt performs unscripted behavior, particularly if this leads to downtime of a production service.\nupgrade\n    upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages\n    currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in\n    /etc/apt/sources.list. Packages currently installed with new\n    versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no\n    circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages\n    not already installed retrieved and installed. New versions of\n    currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without\n    changing the install status of another package will be left at\n    their current version. An update must be performed first so that\n    apt-get knows that new versions of packages are available.\n\ndist-upgrade\n    dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade,\n    also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions\n    of packages; apt-get has a \"smart\" conflict resolution system, and\n    it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the\n    expense of less important ones if necessary. So, dist-upgrade\n    command may remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list file\n    contains a list of locations from which to retrieve desired package\n    files. See also apt_preferences(5) for a mechanism for overriding\n    the general settings for individual packages.\n\n\nA: Users might have come to rely on packages that were installed implicitly because of other (explicitly installed) packages' dependency on them.  Thus the packaging system cannot be aware of a user/administrator desire to retain certain functionality that might otherwise be removed via dist-upgrade.\n\nA: I know this question has been answered and is a year old, but I feel this needs to be said. Ubuntu 14.04 and later (and Debian Jessie and later, for those finding this from Google) uses APT 1.0, which allows the command apt instead of apt-get and apt-cache for some operations. \n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get upgrade will not change what is installed (only versions), \n\n*apt-get dist-upgrade will install or remove packages as necessary to complete the upgrade, \n\n*apt upgrade will automatically install but not remove packages.\n\n*apt full-upgrade performs the same function as apt-get dist-upgrade.\n\n\nA: The upgrade option only installs new version of the packages that are already installed on the system (and yes, kernel updates belong to them).\nHowever, sometimes the updates change dependencies: for example, a new version of a package will no longer depend on a library that you have installed, or will require installation of additional libraries. The upgrade option will never remove installed packages that you no longer actually need.\nHowever, the dist-upgrade option can \"intelligently\" handle changes in the dependencies system. This includes removing packages that are no longer necessary or resolve conflicts between packages that arose because of changes in the dependencies.\n", "Q: It appears you are running a x server NVIDIA Drivers 304.02 Ubuntu 12.04 \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to install NVIDIA.run? \n\nSo I went to NVIDIA's site and I saw they had a version with a lot of bug fixes. http://www.geforce.com/drivers/results/49073\nand I downloaded it, I ran the .run file rooted.

It allows me to continue using. So is it okay to use the unlimited trial version?\nNeed advice from AskUbuntu experts.\nThanks\n\nA: Sublime is provided as freeware to a certain degree. If you want nightly builds, and the ability to get support from the developer to incorporate your requests into Sublime, then you would need to purchase a license for it. The beta builds of Sublime are usually not far behind the licensed version, so there's really no point in buying a license for it unless you want to use it without breaking usage terms, need the support, nightly builds, or the dialog is just simply annoying.\nNote that if you have already decided you are going to use it, and have moved from evaluating it to using it, then you've broken the usage terms. It is likely to be illegal or at least unethical.\n\nA: \"Okay\" in what sense? Are you \"evaluating\" the software? If so, then carry on evaluating until you can make a decision on whether to use it or not. If you have already decided you are going to use it, and have moved from evaluating it to using it, then you've broken the usage terms and you are a bad boy or girl and will go to whatever place of damnation awaits you according to your belief system.\nYou can prevent that eternal damnation by shelling out $59 - sounds like a good deal to me.\n", "Q: I shut my lid on system updates It wasn't an upgrade, i just shut the lid like an idiot.

I'm using 12.04 on a Dell latitude D600, 2 gigs of RAM, 250 Gig hard drive. \n\nA: See this tutorial to resize wubi  \n\nClick here\n\n\nA: You can, but it's pretty hair raising, but no worse that say shrinking your NTFS partition to make room for a real Ubuntu install on its own partition.  You should back up any important data on both the wubi disk and the NTFS partition just in case.  Also make quite certain that there is plenty of room on the NTFS partition for the changes you are about to make.  Resizing the wubi partition to something larger (or even close to) than the available free space may stop Windows from booting, and the resulting crash might also break the wubi install.\nThe first thing you need to do is boot off the LiveCD or LiveDVD.  This method uses Linux tools, and you can't do it from within Ubuntu on the virtual disk you are resizing. Select \"try Ubuntu\" when prompted.  Wait for the desktop to load up.\nNext, open a terminal window with ctrlaltt\nWe need to find out which partition Windows is on so that we can mount it at a known location and resize the wubi disk.  In the terminal windows type\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nYou will be looking for the NTFS partition of the right size.  Most likely it will be /dev/sda1 or /dev/sda2 if there is a recovery partition or a windows bootloader on the drive.  Do not proceed with these instructions if you are not sure, ask for further help by posting the results of the fdisk command into your question.\nNext, we will mount the NTFS partition to get access to the wubi drive.  In my examples I will use /dev/sdaX but you should changed this to the correct drive as determined in the previous step.\nWe are not ready to mount the NTFS partition:\nsudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt\n\nNext, run a check on the filesystem on the wubi drive:\nfsck -f /mnt/ubuntu/disks/root.disk\n\nIf you get errors do not proceed until they are all resolved and the fsck gives a clean result.\nLastly, resize the wubi virtual drive!\nresize2fs /mnt/ubuntu/disks/root.disk 30G\n\nwhich will resize the virtual disk to 30Gb\n", "Q: Ugly fonts in 12.10 even with antialiasing turned on I'm feeling like there's something wrong with font rendering because it looked a lot nicer last time I had Ubuntu running on the same PC (or even from a Live CD). \n\n\nIs it something wrong with my configuration?\n\nA: Make sure you have the ubuntu-desktop package installed.

So, as a first step, you need to save the build log in a file.\n  You can do that by piping the output of your build command through\n  tee, for example:\ndpkg-buildpackage -j4 | tee buildlog \nIn case you forgot to pipe the\n  output and you want to avoid rebuilding, you can also copy-paste the\n  part of the output that contains the diff in new file.\nAfter saving the diff in a file, you can patch the symbols file by\n  executing:\npkgkde-symbolshelper patch -p libfoo1 -v 1.8 < buildlog\nHere we suppose that your libfoo1 package was updated to version 1.8, so \"-v\n  1.8\" in the command is the switch to specify the new version.\n\nYou'll need to install pkg-kde-tools \n", "Q: Make wmctrl ignore other-than-current workspace's windows I rely on wmctrl a lot to switch between windows, basically to avoid typing alt-tab many times. I've always used one workspace but now I want to begin using more than one.\nI was wondering if it is possible to modify the context of wmctrl so that when I type wmctrl -l, only windows from the current workspace are shown, instead of all windows from all workspaces.\nFor example, assuming I have a Firefox window opened in workspace 1. I have a keyboard shortcut on ctrl+alt+f that executes wmctrl -a firefox, which switches to Firefox. If I open a new Firefox window on workspace 2 and type ctrl+alt+f, it will switch to the window at workspace 1, which is not what I want.\nAny suggestions/ideas on how to solve this?\nEDIT: I'm using compiz (Unity)\n\nA: If you're using Compiz (run wmctrl -m if not sure), wmctrl only sees 1 desktop (2nd field of wmctrl -l, ie 0) but you can use the geometry (-G) option to know what window is on what virtual desktop. All windows in your current desktop will have an x-position between 0 and your screen's width. Same for the y-position between 0 and your screen's height.\nSo you can use something like that \n#!/bin/bash\n\nSCREEN_W=$(xwininfo -root | sed -n 's/^  Width: \\(.*\\)$/\\1/p')\nSCREEN_H=$(xwininfo -root | sed -n 's/^  Height: \\(.*\\)$/\\1/p')\n\nNAME='Navigator.Firefox'\n\nwmctrl -xlG | awk -v W=\"$SCREEN_W\" -v H=\"$SCREEN_H\" -v NAME=\"$NAME\" '$7==NAME && $3>=0 && $3<W && $4>=0 && $4<H {print $1}' | while read WINS; do wmctrl -ia \"$WINS\"; done\n\nexit 0\n\nYou can hardcode your screen's width and height if you will, and NAME if you want a one-liner.\nIm not sure how you want to handle multiple windows matching NAME.

The website suggested the\nDirectDownloader program to be installed to be able to download this gallery.\nI could install the DirectDownloader (DD) but it seems to be a kind of a bug. There is no use  for this program, only big  problems arises because it cannot run on Ubuntu. Also the Software Center does not work anymore, a blank window comes up whenever I try to launch it.\nHow can I\n\n\n*\n\n*Get rid of DirectDownloader? \n\n*Activate Software Center again?\n\n\nPlease help.\n\nA: Since I only find a Windows version on that site, I assume you used wine to install it. You can try to use the wine uninstaller, by running (in a terminal emulator or in the run-dialogue - ALT+F2)\nwine uninstaller\n\nThat should bring up a dialogue similar to the one used uninstall software in older versions of Windows. You should be able to uninstall the program that way. This will probably not remove the icons from the menus though, nevertheless they should stop working after uninstalling direcdownloader. For me, to remove the icons, it was enough to try to start direct downloader after uninstalling it. If that doesn't work for you, you can remove them manually. You can either use a program named alacarte (in the menus it's listed as Gnome-Main-Menu or something like that, if it's not installed, you can find it in software center by searching for alacarte.), or navigate to the hidden folder .local/share/applications in your home-directory and look for files named wine-Programs-DirectDownloader-DirectDownloader.desktop or similar and check the wine subdirectory.\nIf this however does not work for you and you are certain that you used wine to install directdownloader, you can try to delete all installed windows programs by deleting the hidden .wine-folder in you home directory. As said, this will remove all windows programs, so I'd only consider it a last resort, as long as any other windows-software additional to directdownloader is installed. Also, this will not remove the icons from the menus, you'll have to delete them manually (see above).\nI must confess that I only tried this partially, for I'm not using the default desktop and therefore don't know how exactly it affects Ubuntu. If it also puts itself in autostart, the default directory for this would be the hidden .config/autostart-folder in your home directory.\n", "Q: Mount drive on remote machine My current set up is: \n\n\n*\n\n*I have my main machine (Darkseid) upstairs which has a drive with all my films on it, which I don't keep mounted.\n\n*Downstairs, next to the tv, I have a htpc (Archangel) which has xbmc installed on it, which points to a samba share on the main machine.\nEverything works fine when the drive is mounted, but is there a script I can write to send a command to the upstairs machine from the downstairs machine to mount the drive to save the walk upstairs? #lazy\nBoth machines are Ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: The way to do this would be to establish a remote connection to your server upstairs by using SSH. \nBy this you are able to remotely mount or unmount drives and you can even mount a remote directory on your local mythubuntu machine.\nRelated questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to use SSH (ssh & rsync commands)?\n\n*How can I set up password-less SSH login?\n\n*Is there a GUI utility to mount remote filesystems over SSH?\n\nA: Not a script, but you can do something on boot for your machine, I did this on my server this morning, nothing wrong with a bit of laziness :)\nAutomaticallyMountPartitions\nOnce you have worked out the terminal command to mount the drive;\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Start-up applications (search start-up in dash/click top right > Start-up Applications)\n\n*Click Add\n\n*Name is Whatever you want\n\n*Command is the command you used in terminal (CTRL SHIFT C to copy)\n\n", "Q: I have an apache process that takes 98% CPU.

I gather it takes care of the 1. above but I am not sure about the 2.\nThe other questions about automated Samba mounts, i.e. How to mount a samba share permanently?, do not seem to address automatic remounts/unmounts, so I think this is not a duplicate.\nThanks.\n\nA: Write the scripts to mount and to unmount the share.\nPlace them in \"/etc/network/if-up.d\" and in \"/etc/network/if-down.d\" respectively. These are the locations for scripts that are run when the network connection is established or closed.\nHowever, if you are looking for a particular server to come up or down online, the only solution I see is to make a cron job that checks the server connection periodically, keeps the state and runs the scripts accordingly.\n\nA: Mounting Samba shares with CIFS:\nEdit your /etc/fstab file to automatically mount your Samba shares:\n//<server>/<share> <mount point> cifs rw,_netdev,user=<username>,password=<password>,uid=<uid>,gid=<gid> 0 0\n\nNotice the _netdev option:\nCIFS doesn't know about this option and will throw a warning about it, but you should leave it in. \nThis option ensures that the drives won't get mounted if you have no network or if you are on the wrong network. \nIt also makes sure your shares get mounted/unmounted when you switch networks. That's because Debian's if* scripts are triggered when your network configuration changes, and they watch all the filesystems with the _netdev option and do the right thing automagically.\nSource\nyou can check man mount for more information about _netdev\nTo install the CIFS tools\nsudo apt-get install cifs-utils\n\n\nA: AutoFS will work fine. It will auto mount when you access the share, remount if dropped and unmount when idle. When you log off and your processes are all terminated (due to log off) then the mount will fall after being idle for some time. You can configure the idle time.\nSee this how-to: http://www.howtoforge.com/accessing_windows_or_samba_shares_using_autofs\n\nA: The mount will always try to re-connect when you access the resource. If you are network hopping then it will depend if you have a route to the host or not. But, AutoFS will keep trying. There are parameters you can configure (timeouts, retries, etc). \n", "Q: Realtek NICs won't operate at 1000BaseT I have tried a Realtek 8139 and Realtek 8111 NIC on my 12.04 Ubuntu desktop machine.

I usually log in to webmin the server IP address and port 10000 but now I cannot. \nAny help to go back to my previous state?\n\nA: I think you should not use addresses out of range: address 10.100.200.300 is not valid, every octet can be in range 0 to 255 only. \n\nA: Webmin is a great tool, if you know what you're doing.  It's a handy way to manage one, or many linux boxes without having to know how to format and where each config file is.  It's a powerful tool for system administration. \nLike any tool, if you don't know how to use it, you're going to muck things up, and because it's meant for server administration, you can muck things up badly, quickly.  \nWith that said, when used correctly, webmin can reduce the time you spend doing redundant tasks, and can help you quickly find and change a configuration.  I manage 20-30 linux servers and VM's, I understand the command line, the configuration files, and how to manage a server.  I have webmin installed on all our linux servers, (no gui on any of them). \nIt's not reasonable to bash a tool because someone isn't using it correctly, or simply doesn't know how to use it.  It is valuable to understand basic networking before conquering DNS, but it's commendable that people are trying, asking, researching, and correcting their errors.\nIsn't that how we all learned this stuff.  \n\nA: The problem you are having is that 300 is not a valid number. You must use 0 though 255 in each of the four \"octets\". Also, by using 10.100.200.# you are probably on a different network that your client device.  \nYou need to take a look at what the ip address and subnet mask on your client machine is. This should let you know what a usable address on this network should look like.  \nWithout going into a full TCP/IP class, if your subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 then the first three \"octets\" should match. For example:  \nClient IP address: 10.0.10.5\nClient Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0  \nThe Server should have an IP address of 10.0.10.1 through 10.0.10.254, with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. You would also want to check your router to make sure you don't create an IP address conflict by assigning an address that's already been assigned.  \nAlso, you said you changed the DNS address. Do you mean you changed the IP address? Or, did you actually change the DNS address? If you changed the DNS address, what was the previous IP address you accessed the server with? Try the \"old\" IP address when you ping and SSH, and let me know what your results were.\n\nA: you should not use webmin. It is well known to break easily systems. For instance, \"in one clic\" webmin blasted your network configuration.

Cheers\n\nA: I'm going to assume you want to install Ubuntu only on the (formerly) Windows machine. If you want to keep Windows edit your question, as this changes things completely. Either way, I hope you backed up your data prior to the machine crashing.  \nFrom your Mac, you need to make a LiveCD or a Live USB to use to install Ubuntu on the other machine. Official, comprehensive instructions are at those links.  \nOnce you have a Live CD or Live USB, go ahead with a standard Ubuntu install on the second computer. This is pretty straightforward and the Ubuntu.com site has instructions here.  \nThis won't be too complicated so don't worry. If you get stuck, keep notes on what step you are stuck at and edit your question with the new details. Good luck.\n\nA: Path of least resistance is to burn the .iso from your Mac to a CD or DVD. Do you know how to do that? This will show you how. If you have an available USB drive (that you can completely overwrite), you can also burn the image to it using UNetbootin (which has a Mac version).\nEither way (CD/DVD or USB), you may need to change the boot order in your Window's machine's BIOS (specific to your computer).\n", "Q: Cannot install shell-themes using gnome-tweak-tool How do I fix this?

We have configured samba with password protected share folders. The problem what we are facing is, multiple users were allowed to use the same system.

Any way to fix this issue?\nNote:\n\n*\n\n*I know this happens because of persistent connections. But any way to control persistent connections from samba server itself?\n\n*Possible to make samba server to ask password on every access by disabling persistent connections??\n\nI hope there is some possible way, but i have not got one. I have already tried the deadtime parameter but that simply closes the idle connections and makes the resource free. i.e if the new user comes and access the samba share and then it wont prompt for username & password.\nUpdates:\n\n*\n\n*Using both ubuntu and windows and samba share is running on ubuntu server 12.04.\n\n\n*On accessing samba share from ubuntu i dont face any problems.

And to avoid this, you'll have to tweak your clients. Quoting directly from this page:\n\nSamba does not control client-side password caching.\nCaching of domain logon credentials is a client-side activity. There\n  are  registry settings on the Windows 2000 Professional and Windows XP\n  Profesional  clients that control logon credential caching.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Click Start >Run >type gpedit.msc\n  \n*Check Computer Configuration\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local  Policies\\Security Options\n  \n*Check \"Interactive Logon: Number of Previous Logins To Cache\" (if value is  set to 0 then cached credentials is disabled)\n  \n  \n  Also check....\n  - Computer Configuration\\Administrative Templates\\System\\Logon\n  - Check \"Always wait for the network at computer startup and logon\" (make sure  that this is either not configured or disabled)\nIf you are however using winbind, you may also want to turn off\n  winbind offline logon by adding to your smb.conf:\nwinbind offline logon = false\n\nEDIT:\nI've also found this interesting question. You could try to put a few:\nnet use \\\\yourserver\\oneofyourshares /delete\n\ninto your user's autostart on the clients, so that credential are deleted whenever any user performs a login. Take also a look to this answer. It seems that it's possible to stop Windows caching credentials on a per-share basis in this way:\nnet use \\\\a.b.c.d\\sharename /user:domain\\otheruser /persistent:no\n\nBut probably for your task it's sufficient something like:\nnet use \\\\yourserver\\yourshare /persistent:no\n\nor even:\nnet use /persistent:no\n\nFind the one that best suits your needs and try to put it into autostart (or in the registry run entries).\n\nA: Your problem is that USER A and USER B are using the same username in S1!\nBecause if they were using different usernames, they would have definitely been asked for a pasword prompt.\n\n\n*\n\n*Anyway, a workaround for your situation is to unmount samba share after having work done with it.

I am going to have three partitions: win7/lubuntu/shared ntfs. Could I even get a third partition with the alongside method? I know easybcd works, but would prefer to use the tools given from the OS provider if possible. \n\nA: It depends on the order you install in. Windows will remove GRUB and prevent Linux from booting if installed after Linux, so you are probably better off with easyBSD in that case.\nIf Windows is already installed, the Linux OS will usually install GRUB with references to all of the existing OSes. Ubuntu does a very good job of this, and I assume Lubuntu works similarly.\nI haven't found any negatives to easyBSD except for a slightly longer boot process since you have to go through the Windows boot menu.\nYou should be able to add a third partition the same way as you add the second if you have enough hard drive space.\n", "Q: Installation problem Ubuntu 12.04 Crashing hardware error \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat should I do when Ubuntu freezes? \n\nI am running on Ubuntu 8.04 for quite some time without many problems.

This is a non-standard meta-partitioning scheme conceptually similar to Linux's Logical Volume Manager (LVM). Installing Linux to an LDM disk is difficult at best. Your best bet is to convert your LDM configuration to a more conventional partition scheme. This can be done with some Windows tools, such as EaseUS Partition Master and perhaps one or two others. Note that this has nothing to do with GPT; your disk is definitely not in GPT format, and there's no evidence of stray GPT data from your fdisk output.\n", "Q: Where do I set the Caps Lock key behaviour?

This is not a Linux issue, it is the PC architecture. \nWhat you can do, however, is to migrate temporarily the data from one of your partitions either to another one or a second hard drive, delete this partition, create an extended partition in its place and divide it into logical partitions. \n\nThe total data storage space of a PC hard disk can be divided into at most four primary partitions, or alternatively three primary partitions and an extended partition. These partitions are described by 16-byte entries that constitute the Partition Table, located in the master boot record.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nA: I believe the short answer is you can't - it's not possible with an \"MBR formatted\" disk and there is no workaround for its four-partition limit. \nGiven that, the option of a second hard disk is one resolution. \nBe aware that extended partitions, and logical partitions inside an extended partition, are not bootable; an operating system can only be installed on a primary partition and I believe all of the listed partitions have to be bootable ergo, be a primary partition types as opposed to extended/logical.  \nI've included some reading on MBR {disks} and GPT {disks} from Microsoft and Wikipedia simply because they're good-to-know things and not to suggest using a GPT-formatted disk as an option to your dilemma.  \nRef 1: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/gg463525.aspx\nRef 2: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table\nLeland \n", "Q: Can I trust the updates offered in the Update Manager? Is it wise to trust the system as far as accepting and installing updates that appear in the Update Manager?  After I updated to kernel 3.4 it now reports about 850 updates at about 400mb, which would take all day on a usb tethered connection.\n\nA: The answer is Yes as long as you can trust the sources. It is perfectly Okay to download and install the updates that appear in the update manager if you use only the standard Ubuntu software sources.  \nBut, if you added PPAs to your software source list, You will receive updates from those PPAs too. So, in that situation your trust level depends on the trust you have on those PPAs. Though you can update your system with PPAs enabled, I strongly recommend to disable PPAs before doing updates. This will help you to have much error free system, because installing updates from PPAs can arise many issues in future.\nSee this questions\n\n\n*\n\n*Are PPA's safe to add to my system and what are some \"red flags\" to watch out for?\n\n*What are PPAs and how do I use them?\n", "Q: Wine right click open is different to terminal \"wine appname\" I have an application (Star Trek Bridge Commander) which runs fine on Wine when I navigate to its directory and 'open with -> Wine Windows Program Loader' from the right click menu.

After that the machine won't boot.  Gives me grub-rescue> prompt.  \nTried boot-repair and Advanced Options but it did not work. The only thing that worked was MBR Option.  \nMy Windows is on sdb2 and Ubuntu on sdb3.  I have an sda disk as well.  I restored MBR of sdb.  My grub was originally set to Windows as a default OS.  That's where it now goes, no matter whether sda or sdb MBR is restored.\ngrub.cfg shows 30 seconds time delay; but the grub menu never displays.  So the only way I can get into Ubuntu is by booting to Live CD and choosing to boot an existing Ubuntu installation.  \nMy boot config is posted at here.\nWill appreciate your help in restoring grub menu if possible.\n\nA: Diagnosis\nThe bootinfo script isn't reporting some important details, maybe because you have installed syslinux MBR's rather than grub ones. If you are getting grub-rescue that may not be an operational problem, but it hinders diagnosing this problem. \nIn particular, under these circumstances, it would be handy to get grub to tell us the root and prefix settings it is using with the set command and to learn grub's view of which drive is which by using ls from the grub-rescue prompt and seeing which hard disk it describes. (Since you are eventually booting Windows, and Windows is on disk 2, that may be a signal that the way you are booting is telling grub that your disk 2 is hd0.) In any case I think there is a mismatch between the prefix and grub's understanding of which drive is which.\nI've also had trouble with putting grub on drive b--it's a bit tricky.\nI believe that seeing the grub-rescue prompt is a sign that the MBR is loading the next sector of grub, and that sector is loading the grub core.img.\nThe next, and failing, step would be to load the menu, environment, and modules from the directory described by the prefix setting. If the prefix is wrong, or if what grub thinks is hd0 and hd1 doesn't match grub's assumptions when assigning the prefix I believe you will get the problem you are seeing. With my BIOS whatever disk I boot from becomes my grub hd0. Perhaps upgrading your BIOS affected this one way or the other.\nRepair\nThe repair, however, would be to boot your Ubuntu using the live CD, and, while running your Ubuntu system, reinstall grub, installing it to the drive you want to use for booting. Be careful about where grub installs its working directory (usually /boot/grub).\nBefore booting run the bootinfoscript to print out the prefix and other information in case there is still a mismatch between drive order and the prefix. There can be a device.map file that can either help or cause problems.\nOnce you get past this point grub now uses UUID's to find partitions, so which drive is which is no longer relevant.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 won't boot, only shows a blinking white line \nPossible Duplicate:\nMy computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it? \n\nI am trying to turn on my computer (Dell Mini 910 netbook) and after the BIOS setup screen it just shows a blinking white line.

Do I have to reboot (or is rebooting recommended)?\n\nA: über-readahead is used during boot to read files in advance of when they are needed such that they are already in the page cache, improving boot performance.\nIts data files are regenerated on the first boot after install, and either monthly thereafter or when packages with init scripts or configs are installed or updated. You can refer to https://launchpad.net/ureadahead for more information.\nNow, as mentioned above, ureadhead files needs to be updated when packages with init scripts or configs are installed or updated. In your case, I guess the same has happened while removing the files. So ureadahead will regenerate its data files based on this removal operation.\n\nA: There is no need to reboot or worry.\nUreadahead, actually called über-readahead, is a system to speed up boot times by preloading boot files into pages and memory so they are ready immediately while called upon, via pack files which are already pre-packed into memory-friendly pages. It will generate a plan for preload monthly, and when files related to boot are modified, added, or removed. Since it only affects boot performance, it is not necessary to reboot since ureadahead only applies during boot, and the boot packing will be done on next boot anyway. However, it will sometimes run even when boot files or the monthly cycle don't apply.\nHow it actually works:\nureadahead is an executable that will trace the boot process, and then generate pack files. When run without arguments, this executable checks /var/lib/ureadahead for packfiles and if they are old enough, or don't exist, it begins tracing forever. It can then be given a SIGTERM with Ctrl+C, at which time it will save any packfiles. It can also be run with --timeout to make it automatically stop and save its packfiles.\nRef: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Ureadahead\n", "Q: What do these hard disk errors \"Test WP failed, assume Write Enabled\" mean?

Obviously, most of what is there is not an error; I would assume these are simply status messages output during normal operation.  The process seems to be saying that it checked to see if Write Protect was enabled, and did not find any indication that it was, so it is assuming not (Write Enabled), and therefore it is OK to write to the device (sdb).\nIf there was an error, it would have said so.\n\nA: I had same problem on my laptop and I was surprised because i do not have any additional disks USB or any thing\nafter checking the pc i found that I was connecting the empty SD-MEM converter to SD reader I just unplugged it the error disappeared\n\nA: I had this same problem.

What am I missing?\n\nA: Installing the PAE kernel is only part of it - you also have to update grub.  Try running \nsudo update-grub\n\nand reboot to see if the PAE kernels show up on the grub menu.\nAlternatively, you could reinstall with the 64 bit release.  I also note that 3.4.0 is not a normal kernel release for 12.04.  It should be 3.2.0-31-generic-pae\nThe normal generic kernels were removed from Ubuntu 12.04 some time after the initial release - the pae kernels are now the default.  Generic kernels are still used for some releases such as Lubuntu.\n\n\nA: The Asus Eee PC 1025C does NOT support either 64 bit processing or PAE.  The Asus Eee PC 1025C contains a $42 CPU (Intel N2600 - AKA 'Cedar Trail').  In order to keep the retail price of their netbook low (and therefore, competitive) Asus did not want to pay full price for the CPU, so it negotiated with Intel, who agreed to lower the price of the CPU. However, in return for the price reduction, Intel disabled both 64 bit computing AND PAE. \nTo add insult to injury, the Asus Eee PC 1025C has a sticker on its keyboard that reads: \"Dual Core CPU'.  This statement is simply untrue.  It should read: \"We were too cheap to pay full price for this dual core CPU, so we had Intel disable the 64 bit core, and then lied to our customers\".\n", "Q: How do I turn Ubuntu 12.04 server into an open SOCKS5 proxy?

In what file can I find information about which movies were not correctly read so I can check for format, coder and other video details. All movies for what I can see I have 4 container formats: 606 Movies in AVI, 3 in M4A, 105 in MKV and 310 MP4.\n\nA: If I understood you correctly there were some movies that xbmc looked at, but did not understand well enough to put them into your movie library.\nBasically you have to use the \"files\" view. The problem is finding it. It is annoyingly well hidden, despite being an incredibly useful feature. It's location depends a bit on which xbmc skin/settings you are using, but there may be a \"files\" tab under \"videos\" or \"movies\" in the main menu. If not, go to your movie library and to the \"..\" (parent directory) twice. \nAs far as I understand, the (internal) video menu system in xbmc works like this:\nTop level menu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Movies\n\n*Recently added movies\n\n*Files (the one you want)\n\n*Playlists\n\n*Video add-ons\n\n\nIf you select the Movies menu item you get:\n\n\n*\n\n*Genres\n\n*Title\n\n*Year\n..etc\n\n\nIf you select the Title menu item, you will see your normal movie library. \nSo, it seems the \"movies\" menu item on the xbmc main menu really is a link to an internal submenu that is two levels further down from the root menu. And it is the root menu you want, in order to find the magic and elusive \"files\" view.\nOnce you find it, you should see a list of ALL your movies, where in your case a few of them are displayed by filename instead of the movie name. If the movies have their own subdirs you will have to enter the subdir to see if the movie title was detected or not. Normally some movies are not detected because xbmc doesn't understand their file name.\nOnce you have highlighted one of your missing movies, hit C on the keyboard to access the context menu. Then select movie information, and you should be able to enter a new title for the movie. Play around with that until the internet scraper finds your movie, and voila!, it's finally loaded into the library.\nPhew.\nFinal note: If you have movies that do not exist in the lists of the internet scraper, it is possible to manually create movie meta data on the file system that xbmc can read instead. See here: XBMC Wiki\n\nA: Most likely the filename of your movie file is not enough for xbmc to determine the corresponding movie. The answer by Yngvefaen is good, but searching for the missing movies manually can take a lot of time.\nInstead you can also install filebot (http://filebot.sourceforge.net/), you can use it to rename your movie files using information from for example themoviedb or imdb.\nIt works very well and after that xbmc will pick them up without problems. I suggested using the command line mode since it will let you do the process recursively.\n\nA: If you use...and ...instead of & for a movie that requirs & your movie will not be found.\nIf you have the wrong year associated with your movie it may not be found.\nIf you have any spelling errors in your movie title it may not be found.\nIf you use a -  (dash) in your title it may not be found ect.\nIf you have dvd title sometimes it looks for ....Video and comes up with Videodrome??\ngood luck.\n", "Q: Ubuntu software center stuck in applying/canceling/searcing I can't install anything from software center because it is stuck at applying/searching, when i cancel it, it is stuck at canceling.

Adding making -d -d1 says it is turning it on, but I suspect the messages tells us it isn't really effective. \nI'm getting good disk access, however.\nI once had trouble with slow disk response and, if I recall correctly, it was because DMA wasn't working. The cause was a bad ribbon cable that had been manipulated one time too many so it had a broken control lead used for DMA. Replacing the ribbon cable greatly increased performance.\nIn my case I saw a warning message at boot time that went away once I replaced the cable.

The\n  apt command provides a convenient subset of the functionality of\n  various other apt- commands (e.g., apt-get, apt-cache), with\n  colorized display and progress bars. Although the apt command does\n  not support all the same actions and options as apt-get, it may often be used in place of apt-get. See Fsando's answer for\n  details.\n\nAPT is a suite of utilities, including a database of information about what packages are available from where.\nAPT is not a single command. Rather, it provides several commands.\nThe most commonly used APT command is apt-get. That's what you should probably be using.\nTo update information about what packages are available and from where (which you should do before attempting to upgrade or install any packages with apt-get), run:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nTo upgrade packages (i.e., \"update your system\"), run:\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nTo upgrade packages, including packages that require uninstalled packages to be installed, or installed packages to be removed, run this (but be careful--it's best to pay attention to what will be added or removed):\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nTo install one or more packages, run this, replacing ... with the list of packages you want to install (if you want to install more than one package, put spaces between the package names):\nsudo apt-get install ...\n\nTo remove one or more packages (i.e., to uninstall it), run:\nsudo apt-get remove ...\n\nTo remove a package and also remove its systemwide configuration files (but not its per-user configuration files, which reside in users' home directories), run:\nsudo apt-get purge ...\n\nTo remove packages that were installed automatically because other packages needed them, but which now are no longer needed, run:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nTo do that, and also remove their global configuration files\"\nsudo apt-get --purge autoremove\n\nTo reinstall a package, run:\nsudo apt-get --reinstall install ...\n\nTo reinstall a package and delete its systemwide configuration files while doing so:\nsudo apt-get --purge --reinstall install ...\n\nTo delete cached package installer (.deb) files (which does not remove any packages, but will make it so they have to be fetched over the network again to be reinstalled):\nsudo apt-get clean\n\nTo deleted cached package installer files, but only for packages that are unlikely to be needed again (i.e., those that are so old they've been removed from the servers, as of last time sudo apt-get update was run):\nsudo apt-get autoclean\n\nThat was just a brief overview. It does not capture all possible uses of apt-get, plus there are a number of other utilities provided in the APT suite, such as apt-cache for examining information about installed and available packages.\nYou can learn more by reading the apt-get and apt manual pages.\n\nA: Are you trying to run apt-get?\nTry running\nsudo apt-get update\n\nLet me know how that works.\n", "Q: How to convert WinWord files to open in gedit? I finally installed Ubuntu in my desktop, but now, when I open Winword files with the text editor, it opens but all the formatting is off. How can I open the file properly?\n\nA: Try the MS Word replacement, LibreOffice Writer.  There are a whole group of open office application to replace MS Office apps.\nA text editor such as GEdit is, by definition, only a plain text editor, not a \"rich text\" editor.  Formatting is not desired, since these editors are used for editing plain text configuration files.\n\nA: A text Editor can and should only be used to open and edit text file. Text file means files which contain only text or characters. Winword files are not text files, because they contains text as well as formatting information, color etc. These are called Word processor file or document file.\nWhat you were doing is, trying to open an word file with a text editor. It is like trying to open word file with Notepad. Some text editors are smart enough to show only the text from an word file. But it is not always the case, most of the text editor won't open the file. \nUse LibreOffice which is included in Ubuntu by default. It should also be opened by default if you try to open an Word file. There are other alternative too, such as Abiword, OpenOffice etc.\nAs the answer of the title of the question, I would say, No, you cannot without clearing all formatting from the file, i.e making it a text file.\nIf you want to really convert the word file to text file, open it with Gedit and From menu, select File → Save as and give it a name. The file will be saved as a text file.\nThis link can be helpful:\n\n\n*\n\n*Text Editor vs Word processor files - Wikipedia Article\n\nA: Besides the difference pointed out in the other answers between plain/rich text, there is also antiword to convert from .doc to .txt\nAntiword is a free MS-Word reader for Linux, RISC OS, and DOS.

Does this mean all of my data is lost????????\nAppreciate ANY input!\n\nA: I found the solution, and feel kind of foolish for missing this. Thank you guys so much for your responses! \nI checked the image for errors and then it mounted with no problem! \nsudo fsck -y /dev/sda2/backup.img\n\nIt fixed the errrors then it mounted no problem with:\nsudo mount /dev/sda2/backup.img /mnt/recoverydata\n\n\nA: The image you created will contain all the faults your original disk has. Therefore you likely can't mount or read it. The way to proceed is to load this image into your favourite data recovery tool. \nWe have good experience with Testdisk/PhotoRec but there are other tools worth mentioning, e.g. Foremost.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to recover deleted files?\n\n*Testdisk guide\n\n*PhotoRec guide\n\nA: Here's what I had to do in a similar situation - in case someone stumbles upon this question like I did.\nMy image also wouldn't mount, generating the same error (bad superblock). However, fsck also failed with the following error:\nfsck from util-linux 2.20.1\ne2fsck 1.42 (29-Nov-2011)\nfsck.ext2: Superblock invalid, trying backup blocks...\nfsck.ext2: Bad magic number in super-block while trying to open /mnt/download/rescue.img\n\nThe superblock could not be read or does not describe a correct ext2\nfilesystem.  If the device is valid and it really contains an ext2\nfilesystem (and not swap or ufs or something else), then the superblock\nis corrupt, and you might try running e2fsck with an alternate superblock:\n    e2fsck -b 8193 <device>\n\nAfter reading through DataRecovery (link provided by Takkat, thanks!), I tried the following and it worked:\napt-get install sleuthkit\nmmls /path/to/image\n\nThis produced the following output:\nDOS Partition Table\nOffset Sector: 0\nUnits are in 512-byte sectors\n\n     Slot    Start        End          Length       Description\n00:  Meta    0000000000   0000000000   0000000001   Primary Table (#0)\n01:  -----   0000000000   0000000062   0000000063   Unallocated\n02:  00:00   0000000063   2930272064   2930272002   Linux (0x83)\n03:  -----   2930272065   2930277167   0000005103   Unallocated\n\nI then multiplied 63 by 512 to get 32256 and mounted the image like this:\nmount -o loop,offset=32256 /path/to/image /mnt/temp\n\nI hope this helps someone else too.\n\nA: In addition to Takkat's answer, I'd like to suggest another possible approach. Considering that your image is almost certainly damaged, there may be some data that data recovery tools can't adequately recover.\nSpinRite addresses this problem in a different way. Rather than operating off an image, it exercises the disk in order to get more data off it than normal tools can recover. I've used it to significantly increase the amount of recoverable data. If you're lucky, you'll be able to mount your disk normally afterward for long enough to make a proper backup.\nSpinRite does come with a major disadvantage, though. It costs a fair amount of money. If the other tools work for you, than save your money. But if you need more, SpinRite is definitely worth a try.\n", "Q: I keep losing connectivity with an RTL8723E wireless card (12.04) I have a realtek RTL8723E network card. It connects for about 3 minutes, but then suddenly disconnects and then reconnects after about a minute. This really hinders my ability to use Ubuntu, as I want to learn to use it but without the internet it is basically pointless.\nI know it's the correct driver, but maybe there is some package that magically fixes problems like this. A man can dream. Also, it isn't the router settings.\nThanks.\n\nA: I would suggest you to install both drivers from this page even if you don't need/have bluetooth. That worked for me.

Before I switched from Windows to Ubuntu for my daily computing, I used Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom for processing photos from my DSLR. Adobe made it really straightforward to batch convert from proprietary camera raw files (in my case, .NEF) to DNG. I haven't found any way to convert NEF to DNG in Ubuntu yet. Most photography programs do process NEFs to JPG/TIFF/PNG/etc., but I'm looking for a converter for archival purposes.\nAre there any tools available, either standalone or built into another app, that can losslessly batch convert from NEF to DNG?\nEDIT: fabricator4 answered the question, but I have since realized that the question itself might not be a good one. There are a few problems with the DNG format that don't necessarily show up in a purely Adobe workflow, but become noticeable when working in a FOSS workflow.\n\nA: There is an batch converter called DNGconverter.  Parts of KDE might be dependencies but it's in the Software Center for installation so that will be taken care of.\nSome of the comments on it in software center are saying there's a problem with a work around, you might want to investigate this.  There are a few applications like UFRaw that handle raw files very well, you might want to see if there's batch processing capabilities with that one.\n", "Q: Changing Disk Allocation for Ubuntu on Dual-Boot System When I first installed Ubuntu, I had a new PC with Windows 7 installed.  It was my first installation of Ubuntu so I only allocated 45% of the disk for Ubuntu.  Now I find that I have been using Ubuntu exclusively so I would like to change the allocation of the disk so Ubuntu has say 75% of the disk and Win. 7 25%.  Is there a way to do this without reformatting the disk.  I am using Ubuntu 11.10 with Gnome.\nThanks,\nPeter\n\nA: You can do this by downloading the GParted Live CD or USB.\nBoot into GParted and resize your Ubuntu partition however you see fit.\n", "Q: Music Manager that can properly see ID3 ratings tags and synchronize with Android From my Windows music manager programs (either MediaMonkey or Windows Media Player) I could set song ratings in a way that the ratings set from either program could be also read from the other one. Additionally, song ratings were visible and updated in my iPod Touch when I synch'ed my music (either manually or using iTunes). To sum up, it seems that MediaMonkey, WMP, and the iPod device use standard mp3 metadata tag for ratings.\nNow, using Ubuntu 12.04, and now with an Android device:\n\n*\n\n*Rhythmbox can't see the song rates, despite those ratings can be\nseen by MediaMonkey and MS Music Player when I boot with Win7. Is\nthis an issue I can fix with some setting? Is there any program I\ncan use to accomplish this?\n\n\n*What do you recommend to sync my music\nwith Android (4.0, Galaxy s2), also keeping the song ratings\ninformation updated between Android and my PC?\n\nA: Amarok supports the FMPS_Rating tags which Nick B refers to (and has for a while I think). Settings > Configure Amarok > Collection > Write statistics to file.\nIf you examine those files with kid3, you'll see the tags. I've only recently begun using it.\n\nA: OK, this is how I decided to solve this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Desktop side: use MediaMonkey in Win and gMusicBrowser in Linux. I really enjoy the latter because you can customize how the information is displayed in several ways. It is not fancy (no super-UI, controls, etc.), but I care more about the features, not the details in the UI. You can also set smart lists based on almost any criteria. Really nice product.\n\n*Android: I have bought Poweramp, the highest rated player in the store. Another very solid product, extremely cheap considering the features you get. It does not read ratings from tags, BUT I have exchanged emails with its author and this feature is scheduled for the next release (no ETA, though..). The prayer is so good that I have bought now (and I will patiently wait for the upcoming release).\n\n*Synch: solved mounting the SD card and running rsync (one script for Desktop -> Android, another for Android -> Desktop). I need manually run it depending on where I did my latest change, but I can live with that.\n\n\nThanks,\n\nA: My default ICS music player (which i rarely use) doesn't seem to show ratings, so it's hard to say. \nAs you've no doubt realised the only practical way around this problem is using ratings in tags. This won't work with iTunes AFAIK. However the problem is that for MP3 in particular, there is no universal ratings system for ID3. That said, \n\n\n*\n\n*Various music players, including Quod Libet (I'm one of\nthe devs) should be able to read these ratings formats for MP3.\nThere are further subtleties about the scale used by WMP vs MM so your ratings may not be exactly the same, especially at the lower end of the scale.\nThere is also discussion about adapting to fully support the\nnew(ish) FMPS specs, which one day might solve this (but maybe\nnot).\n\n*Once you've solved this, to keep the changes in sync across devices you're back to a much more familiar file synchronisation problem; there are many solutions to this. I'd\nrecommend mounting the android disk locally then using something\nlike Unison,but there are lots of file synchronisation alternatives.\nHTH\n", "Q: installArchives() failed: perl: warning: Setting locale failed.

I am using Ubuntu 12.04. I know two methods to access the web-pages through terminal. They are lynx and  elinks. When I tried to use them to access web-pages from terminal, I didn't seem to get any improvements on browsing speed. I am not sure whether it's just normal or my Internet speed is slow. \nSo what is the best way to access the web-page? Through terminal browsers or GUI browsers?\nAnd what are the benefits and limitations of using text based terminal browsers?\n\nA: Yes, of course using a text browser will increase your browsing speed. It makes sense because text browsers don't have image, flash and other graphics objects so they don't load on them.\n\nWhat is the best way to access web-page?\n\nIt depends on the situation. In normal scenario, Using a traditional graphical browser is best. But if you have very low speed Internet connection or a limit on monthly usage, you may want to cut your usage and hence may want to use text browser.\nBenefits and Limitations\nThe benefits are high speed browsing, less data usage.\nThe Limitations are you can't see the image, sometimes it is essential such as for capcha, can't play video and miss usability or productivity a bit.

My system specifications are: Ubuntu 12.04, 64-bit, Acer Aspire One D270, Intel Atom CPU\nThe usual brightness increase/decrease key combination using Fn key doesn't work in Ubuntu as many pointed out.\nI had found two solutions on this forum to set the screen brightness.\nOne was to make the usual key combination work answer is given here:\nIs there a way to set a hotkey to change screen brightness?\nand the other is using the command\nsudo setpci -s \"00:02.0\" F4.B=20\n\nwhere the 20 is a hexadecimal number representing brightness.\nIt's only the latter that worked in my case.\nI observe that the original brightness setting is restored after resumption from sleep mode.\nAll I want is to keep my brightness setting permanent. How do I do that?\nTry 1: Tried Alok's suggestion. It just sits there as a startup application. Doesn't figure as an icon on the topbar of the screen, like the dropbox icon (my dropbox account it is linked to ubuntu) so that I can conveniently change the brightness.\nTry 2: Also I must add, that the method System Settings -> Additional Drivers gives an empty list. In my earlier install (which I had to overwrite-reinstall :-(), the list had (I think) Intel Cedarview Graphics Driver. So must I install before trying the methods in any of the answers below?\nUpdate: I read somewhere Intel CedarView is only for 32-bit OS!\nTry 3: Just tried the quiet_splash etc that I had to add to /etc/default/grub, even read the thread given in one of the answers below!\nTemporarily settled myself with this method:\n\n* Pasted the setpci brightness command in a bash file brightness.sh\n\n* Created a .desktop file for the command bash brightness.sh\n\n* Made it an executable file.\nTry 4a: I created an environment variable BRI ensured using env it's there in the list, and tried using it, here's the bash file brightness.sh\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"Set Brightness (Values 00-FF): \"\nread s\nsudo setpci -s \"00:02.0\" F4.B=$s\nexport BRI=s\n\nHowever I have to give the administrative password, and have yet not succeeded in making it a permanent setting and am working on these aspects!\nTry 4b: I even tried (in vain)\n\n*pasting the export BRI into /etc/default/grub and /etc/grub.conf\n\n*appending the same to ~/.bashrc and to /etc/bash.bashrc through the shell script brightness.sh that I made\nas I in each case restart and find BRI to still have its old value, and not the one given by executing brightness.sh via the launcher!\n\nA: Possibly, the second solution posted in this thread applies to your laptop as well: passing the options acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor to grub. Try to edit the line starting with \"GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX\" in the file /etc/default/grub to:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor\"\n\nand then run\nsudo update-grub\n\nMaybe this will help.\n\nA: Optionally you can install XBACKLIGHT\nXBACKLIGHT \nThe review :\n\"For those of you whos laptop starts up with the screen brighter than the surface of the sun, this one is it. You can easily set this terminal program to stop your eyes from being bleeched by your laptop's screen brightness. Download the app, then go to the system tab, which is the cog shaped thing in the top right corner of your screen. Go to startup applications, and then set the command line to \"xbacklight -set 0\" (or whatever percentage you want your backlight to snap to on start up) and obviously, remove the quotes from that command. Wallah, that should straighten all of those pesky backlight problems out. Tell your friends, because this one is a keeper\"\nEdit: The following solution seems to work for some Acer Computers.\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=Linux i915.i915_enable_rc6=1\"\nin /etc/default/grub (and then updating with sudo update-grub) [the first option enables hardware control of backlight, the second implements a workaround for Intel graphics]\nSource : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1850190\n\nA: I've kept this thread bookmarked and I check it from time to time. I finally found a way to solve this problem (for my hardware), so I'm writing this answer for archive and hopefully help someone else.\nI've been struggling with the same problem for nearly a year and a half. I have an Acer Aspire 5750G running Ubuntu 12.04.04 (64 bits), Debian Wheezy (64 bits) and Windows 7 Ultimate.\nThe problem with the backlight sliding bar that should appear when hitting Fn+Left/Right arrow keys never worked for me except in Windows (I had to install Acer drivers after a fresh reinstall). I've put together something that seems to work using things I found here and in other places.\nFirst: get the widget to show up\nThis method worked both in Debian Wheezy and Ubuntu 12.04 \nEdit /etc/default/grub and add at the end of the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX line acpi_backlight=vendor, and then run sudo update-grub2 (please notice the 2 at the end, since I'm using GRUB2). And this should work after next boot.\nSecond: preserve backlight\nMake sure there's something in /sys/class/backlight. I have there a symlink intel_backlight that points to ../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.0/drm/card0/card0-LVDS-1/intel_backlight\nThis folder has some files in it:\n$ cd /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight\n$ ls\nactual_brightness  bl_power  brightness  device  max_brightness  power  subsystem  type  uevent\n\nWhen I dim the brightness, the value in file actual_brightness decreases\n$ cat  actual_brightness\n976\n$ cat  actual_brightness\n304\n$ cat  actual_brightness\n160\n\n976 is the value in max_brightness, and it's the max allowed value, so it won't go any further.\nI made a little script and tried to set it up as a cron job. It stored the value as it was supposed to but was unable to restore it on boot.\nA few days ago I found this book: Upstart Intro, Cookbook and Best Practices\nSo I made two upstart jobs to save and restore the value of the screen brightness.\nUpstart is packaged on Ubuntu since version 6.10 (I think) and is an option on Debian.\nCheck you have upstart and its version:\n$ sudo initctl --version\ninitctl (upstart 1.5)\nCopyright (C) 2012 Scott James Remnant, Canonical Ltd.\n\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO warranty; not even for     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.\n\nYou can call it anything you like: anything.conf and it must be placed in /etc/init/\nThis job is triggered when the computer is shutting down or rebooting and copies the file /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/actual_brightness to /var/backups/actualb (this too can be changed to whatever you like, but on the second job it has to be same).\n# upstart job to save the actual screen brightness on shutdown\n# file: /etc/init/backlightsave.conf\n\nstart on runlevel [!2345]\n\nscript\n    cp /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/actual_brightness /var/backups/actualb\nend script\n\nThis job loads the value that has been stored and sets the screen backlight according to it. You can call it whatever.conf and place it in /etc/init/ too.\n# upstart job to restore the screen brightness on boot\n# file: /etc/init/backlightrestore.conf   \n\nstart on runlevel [2345]\n\nscript\n    read brightness < \"/var/backups/actualb\"\n    pkexec /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/gsd-backlight-helper --set-brightness $brightness\nend script\n\nYou can test the jobs by typing in a terminal:\n$ sudo initctl name_of_the_job\n\nNow everything works fine for me, the screen backlight is restored even before the login screen shows up.\nHope this helps\n\nA: If you have Samsung in addition to acpi_backlight=vendor look at https://launchpad.net/~voria/+archive/ppa and install samsung-tools and samsung-backlight.\nAlso no need to add acpi_osi=Linux.\n\nA: I myself made a geeky solutions for \"brightness restoration\" problem on my Acer 5755......\npaste the following code in text file, make it executable, & add to startup applications....done\npkexec /usr/lib/gnome-settings-daemon/gsd-backlight-helper --set-brightness 800\n\nYour display brightness now set on startup, change \"800\" as per Your requirement.\n\nA: as the brightness is moving all around, there is directory in /sys/class/backlight giving you semi-direct control of your devices. go to the one with your monitor name and you will find the file brightness. change the value in it...\nin some cases linux cant change it on one device, so just go out and into another directory in /sys/class/backlight in order monitor, graphics, Xorg.

I have a few books as PDFs, and I'd like to split them by chapter for easier consumption on a mobile phone.  Is there any tool (or sequence of tools) I can use to easily split the book into different PDF files by chapter?\n\nA: This would be hard to do automatically, as there is no standard chapter label in a PDF file. However, if you do not mind some manual work, write down the pages for each chapter, and use pdftk to select the pages and save them into a new pdf file. For example, if chapter 2 is pages 23-45, do\npdftk A=input.pdf cat A23-45 output chapter_2.pdf\n\nYou need to install pdftk first:\nsudo apt-get install pdftk\n\nYou can also use ghostscript (which comes preinstalled) directly:\ngs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -dSAFER -dFirstPage=23 -dLastPage=45 -sOutputFile=chapter_2.pdf input.pdf\n\nThis is quite easy to convert a script that runs things semi-automatically.

After hours of searching I found the solution: One can use \"complex prefix(es)\" as described here. This solved all of my problems and should help you as well.\n\nA: You could try pdfsam (pdf-split-and-merge) but you have to manually select the beginning of each chapter.\n", "Q: Can I install Ubuntu/Lubuntu on a pc with a video card that is not supported if I add `nomodeset` in using the live cd/usb? I have a computer with a video card that has no Linux support.  I discovered this issue while trying to use a persistent usb to boot from. \nI found that I can boot like that if I change options and edit so as to add nomodeset there (see question and answer).\nAlso, editing the syslinux.cfg file from my live persistent USB and adding nomodeset in a line there made this setting automatic for booting from the persistent USB.\nCan I make a similar edit for proper install from the same live USB?\nIs it possible to edit something on the live USB in order to install the SO from it,  -- that is: having automatically the nomodeset setting already there when the installation starts?\nMy problem is that in order to install I think I already have to have added nomodeset or I'll see nothing on my display. I need a way to be sure that nomodeset it's permanent from the start.\n\nA: Yes, absolutely you can make it work with a full install.  To make the change permanent in your installed Ubuntu you will need to edit the grub configuration file and add the nomodeset option so that it loads each time Ubuntu boots.  It's more complicated to set it to install this way automatically, and it's probably not normally desirable to do so.  If you want an easy way to do this I suggest you edit the config file as per the following instructions and simply copy this file to the correct location during installation.\nTo add nomodeset to the grub config do the following\n1) Press CtrlAltF1 to open the console\n2) Log in to the console using the username and password you entered during the install\n3) Start editing the /etc/default/grub file with\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\n4) Find the line that reads:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nand change it to read:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset\"\n\n5) To save the file press Ctrlo then exit the editor with Ctrlx\n6) You'll need to update grub with the new default config\n sudo update-grub\n\n7) Reboot and marvel at your wonderful new Ubuntu system!\nsudo reboot\n\n\nOptional:\nIf you want to change the grub configuration during the install before it completes, the file you will need to change will be /target/etc/default/grub because that is where the root filesystem is mounted during installation.  As long as you do this before grub is configured then it will be affective from the first boot of the new installation.\nReferences\nUbuntu Forums\nUbuntu Wiki\n", "Q: How can I use a script to control a VirtualBox guest?

It seems to happen at points in songs where the music suddenly becomes louder or the bass becomes more prevalent.\nI checked connections and the same setup works fine in Windows 7. If there is any kind of tweaking I can do with my settings to fix this problem please let me know. \nThanks,\nMD\n\nA: I have a similar problem with the Presonus Audiobox 1818.  With Ubuntu 12.10 I had the issue appear often, but turning the card off and on (often a few times) would eventually fix it.  With Ubuntu 13.04 I found no way of doing this.  I installed Ubuntu 12.04.2 and it seems to work well all the time.  I don't know exactly what the problem is with later versions.\nOther things which may be affecting the behaviour of your card:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Ivy Bridge machines, try using a USB 2.0 port, if available, instead of a USB 3.0 port.  Your computer may have an option in the BIOS to switch the ports to USB 2.0 compatibility mode, which should do the trick too.\n\n*There are reports of Wi-Fi cards and other USB devices causing crackling in USB audio devices, so you may want to disable them temporarily to diagnose the problem.\n\n*There are reports that disabling Pulseaudio may work around crackling problems with USB audio.\n\n*Some bits of the set-up for real-time sound recording may be applicable here.\n\n\nAs for the driver stuff you mention in the comments: the Audiobox is a class-compliant USB audio device, which the Linux kernel supports without the need for any third-party drivers. Bear in mind that there are several reports of crackling problems with USB soundcards in the Presonus forums, even with Windows and OS X, so this issue is likely to be hardware-related in some obscure way.\n\nA: I've had the same problem with my 44VSL. I spent hours uninstalling, reinstalling, trying legacy drivers. Always a crackle, then someone suggested I try a different USB cable in a different port.\nYou'd be surprised. Just by swapping out the cable and plugging it into a USB 3.0 port (even though the Audiobox is only USB 2.0, the USB 3.0 ports on my PC have USB 2.0 speed boost), I now get a crisp sound from my digital piano, no matter how loud I turn it up.\nIt might not work for you, but it's worth a shot. The Audiobox does seem to be very picky on it's connection to the PC.\n\nA: Presonus Audiobox must be connected to an USB 1.0 or 2.0 port on linux. If you have USB 3.0 ports, you must disable XHCI on BIOS. If you can't disable 3.0 ports,  try with an USB 2.0 HUB.\nAlso, if you have audio glitches only when you turn on Phantom Power, you must set an external power source to your usb port, or connecting the device with a dual power usb cable to solve this issue.\nI have an Presonus Audiobox 2x2 connected to an old usb 2.0 HUB with external power and everything works fine.

However, there are two problems with that:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is not straightforward and cannot be done with the debian packages, since using apt-get requires root.\n\n*You will need to compile the extensions yourself, since this option is by default disabled at compile time, and for that you need the whole mono development environment, and to install that you also need root, so back to square 1.\n\nA: The simple answer: No.\nBanshee uses the /usr/bin, /usr/lib, and /usr/share folders. These folders are created and owned by root when the system is installed. Unless you've ran chown on these folders (or on the Banshee directory/files within each folder), you'll have to run sudo, be logged in as root, or try maythux's suggestion to install it.\n\nNotes from the comments:\napt-get will always require root.\nIt is not recommended to change the owner of the /usr/bin, /usr/lib, and\n  /usr/share folders.\n\n\nA: Since many player support adding visualizations directly from their menu, you may be interested to know whether such options are available in banshee too (In these cases, the plugins are stored in user's home folder, such as adding plugin in Firefox etc) \nThe answer is No, You cannot add visualization in such way in banshee like other player\n", "Q: Installed kubuntu-desktop over Ubuntu and upgraded, what is the distribution now? I am curious to know how Ubuntu will handle later updates if I install other *-desktop metapackages such as kubuntu-desktop, lubuntu-desktop etc on a default Ubuntu installation. \nAs dist-upgrade command upgrade the distribution, what will be my final distribution. This question is important because dist-upgrade can install and remove packages to satisfy dependencies, so it may remove some packages say for example, dependency of ubuntu-desktop to satisfy dependency of kubuntu-desktop \n\nA: A 'metapackage' is no more than a simple way to install a bunch of packages at once. It will be no different from how it would deal with an individual package. apt-get upgrade will update each individual package and its dependencies. Referencing an older question it will install any necessary dependancies, even once you explicitly removed, and remove any obsolete files.\nIt however has nothing to do with upgrading your release. You will be on the same version of ubuntu (say dist-upgrade on 12.04 will give you 12.04.. with newer packages).\nFor getting a new version of ubuntu on release the command will bedo-release-upgrade-d\n\nA: We can handle one or two desktop environment with a single system.

In case of Thunderbird, this is most pronounced with the wait time of up to a minute.\nMemory status checked with free indicates around 500MB of free memory on such occasions. The OS is stable and I can switch to a different work-space, etc.\nWhat could this be? Is this something normal?\n\nA: Why dimming?\nThe window dims because of a compiz setting , which dims the windows of programs which are not responding.\nYou can change the setting, if you have compizconfig-settings-manager installed.\nOpen it and go to Fading Window plugin. There is a settings named Dim unresponsive windows. Uncheck the setting if you don't want the dimming. But I don't recommend it, since it tells you which program is not responding.\n\nWhy Not responding?\nThe application may seem to be not responding while starting up sometimes. Mostly it happens when it does some background activities, such as fetching settings, loading files and trying to connect to the Internet etc.\nI think, the most likely cause in your case is, You get large number of new messages in your email account everyday and thunderbird was trying to fetch those emails. But It is not a big problem since it quickly becomes responsive after the operation. It may also related with your Internet connection speed, which may be slowing down fetching and syncing information with your email account.\n\nA: Applications \"dim\" when they are busy like loading from disk. This is common on slower computers where applications might be competing for resources, or launching a bunch of applications at once.\nThis is normal on lower performance Notebooks.

Sometimes these don't go very well as the config of the old version might not suit the new one.\nGo to home directory and ensure you are showing hidden files in dolphin (view/show hidden files). open .kde/share/config and rename all the files that begin with plasma. \nReboot and you should be presented with a clean desktop that will hopefully be running properly.

Are the files corrupted (they play on the TV) or do Sharp have a unique file structure? \nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: For what I've heard, those files are not meant to be played on other system, than the TV.\nIt looks like there's an encription on them, that makes converting it to other formats rather difficult.\n\nThe recordings are not intended to be portable. They are just supposed\n  to allow people to watch the recorded TV programs on their TV at a\n  more convenient time, or pause and resume the show as necessary.

You have to pass an option for that:\n\"Path/to/VLC\" --demux ffmpeg\n\nAnswer from this VideoLan discussion thread\n\nA: TS files are MPEG-2 video files (TS == Transport Stream), recordings of television broadcasts (in high definition).\nVLC can play .ts files\nhttp://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html\nThere is also a similar question here.\nHow to play .ts files? (and other unusual formats)\n\nA: I know this is an old thread, but in case anybody else, like me comes across it here's the gen; Sharp, and other TV manufacturers have their own proprietary video encryption for recordings. This is because pay for channels (and other channels) don't want their content copied. Because they are proprietary and each manufacturer, and often TV models have different encryption, unlike DVD's that use a standard encryption nobody has gone to the effort of cracking the decryption and making an application or codec to do this because you'd need a different codec for each manufacturer and possibly each model. \nSo basically, it can't be done unless you can crack the encryption write a codec yourself.\n\nA: I hope the following could help.\n.ts files are recognized by the system but can be played on your linux box, you have to right-click with the mouse on your file , and then select open with ....

How can I install Visual Studio?  \nI'd prefer to use it in Wine or PlayOnLinux if possible.\n\nA: Visual Studio is tightly integrated with Windows and Developing a .NET application using any language (C# or VB) takes more than just having Wine, and since Wine is not capable enough to provide complete development runtime as .NET in Linux.\nIf you want to develop software specifically in C#, on Linux, you can use MonoDevelop\nSince, you're asking for Visual Studio 2010 (.NET 4.0), with MonoDevelop, you'll not be able to develop an app that particularly uses .NET 4, as of now MonoDevelop is in version 3.0.2 (somewhat equivalent to .NET 3.0).\nYou can still use Windows virtually within Ubuntu, using VirtualBox. And then install Visual Studio there, but still a serious app development is not recommended to be done in Virtualized environment.\n\nA: You can try Wine, but per the Wine application database, Visual Studio generally works poorly under Wine:\nFrom this Wine site page:\n\nWhat works\n  nothing, install fails\nWhat does not\n  n/a\nWhat was not tested\n  n/a\n\nhttp://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=892\n\nA: You'll need to run a virtual machine.  Wine won't be able to handle it.  Look into install VirtualBox (not necessarily the best but easier).  You'll need to create a windows VM and then once you have windows installed install Visual Studio.\nIf you're looking at equivalent IDEs.  Qt Creator, Eclipse, KDevelop, Anjuta, Intellij can all act as possible alternatives depending on the language you wish you develop in.\nPossibly useful link on how install windows on VirtualBox:  http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Windows-XP-on-Ubuntu-with-VirtualBox\n\nA: You could try MonoDevelop, which is a clone of VisualStudio, but it hasn't as much features. MonoDevelop uses the Mono framework, a platform-independent implementation of C# and the CLI, but it's not fully compatible with .NET. You will have to port your .NET applications to Mono. At least you have to rewrite the UI, WPF isn't included in Mono and Winforms is crappy on Linux.\nAlthough there are some Linux applications written in C# (Banshee, Tomboy, Pinta, PDFMod, Smuxi), .NET/Mono isn't very popular on Linux. It's not officially supported by Microsoft, and the developers of Mono (Xamarin) are actually focusing on mobile devices (Android, iOS) and not the Linux desktop. I recommend you to switch to another IDE and programming language that is fully supported on Linux. If you really can't live without .NET (e.g because you make your living writing .NET programs), you have to keep using Windows, because that's the only platform it supports.\n\nA: Now Microsoft offer a cross platform version of visual studio. It's Not feature rich as Visual Studio Windows Edition.\nFollow the white rabbit :) \nhttps://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/code-vs.aspx\n\nA: You can use the Mono Development IDE to write .NET code in Ubuntu, rather than trying to use a Microsoft product in a non-Microsoft OS (which others have rightly pointed out is never going to be supported, easy, or in MS' best interests). \nIt has most of the features of Visual Studio, and will run faster and be more stable. \nTo install monodevelop, use this command in a terminal:\nsudo apt-get install monodevelop\n\nMonodevelop Home page: http://monodevelop.com/\n\nA: Sorry to give you the wrong answer, but I really doubt this will ever be truly supported.\nSome people might actually get it working someday, but Microsoft will most certainly never support this officially; or even make things easy for the community, for that matter. From what I know, running the MS Office suite itself is horribly painful, it becomes more difficult with each new version.\nDon't take it personally. Business is business. And their share on development is not on supporting the opensource community. For all they care, they strive on making their tools less and less compatible overtime.\nIf you really need this inside Linux, the best choice would be to have Windows in a Virtual Machine.\n\nA: As another option all the Jetbrains IDEs are in Java, have installers for Linux, and are excellent.  They are also free if you are a student or teacher.\n(Its ironic how much of a boon to Linux java has been given all the hate directed at it by Linux C snobs back in the day.)\nI use Rider for C# and Webstorm for all the Web stuff including TypeScript, and vastly prefer them to the bloated mess that is VS.\n", "Q: How do I run \"HP Support Assistant\"? Battery performance on my hp-laptop has degraded in a disastrous way. \nHP will only replace the battery if I give them the result from their \"HP support Assistant \" software. I downloaded the software and tried to run the same with \"Wine\". Neither didn't it got installed nor did it throw any exception. \nUbuntu Software center doesn't have the software, is there a way to convert the software into deb format for install on ubuntu.\n\nEdit 1:- On installing with wine, i get the following error:-\nankit@stream:~/.wine/drive_c/swsetup/SP54620$ wine  msiinstaller.exe \nfixme:storage:create_storagefile Storage share mode not implemented.\nfixme:apphelp:ApphelpCheckInstallShieldPackage stub: 0x32d5fc L\"C:\\\\users\\\\Public\\\\Application Data\\\\{A8DA1505-E615-42BB-BB77-74D5CC91FE7E}\\\\HP Support Assistant.msi\"\nankit@stream:~/.wine/drive_c/swsetup/SP54620$ \n\n\nA: You cannot convert .exe to .deb. It's two completely different things. I don't think running it in Wine will work either. If the so-called support assistant is going to check the battery, it will need to access some things close to the hardware, which would be specific to Windows and your particular computer model.\nYou could run Windows in a virtual machine, but that wouldn't allow the program to check your battery.\nWhat you really need to do is install Windows on a separate partition or something, which should allow the program to work.\n\nA: I think only option to run a .exe in a linux machine is by using WINE. You cannot convert a exe to deb.\nIf you know the complete code of exe program, you can rewrite it for Linux. \nI would suggest you to first understand the output of \"HP support Assistant\" and what data is needed for the support guys at HP to replace your laptop battery.\nThere are wonderful apps in ubuntu to get all the stats of your computer. which would provide the same results as \"HP Support Assistant\"\n\nA: *\n\n*use wine from old post \n\n*use hiren's boot cd and run minimal windows live cd then execute your exe file from there\n\n*install virtualbox and run windows from it then run your exe\n\nA: A .EXE file is a Windows Executable Application, which basically means it's a program. A .DEB file, used in Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions of Linux, is an installer containing the source code of a program, and is not actually the program by itself (the code is, a deb isn't). You can't actually withdraw code from an .EXE once it's become such a format, however, so it would quite technically be impossible to convert such a file to a .deb.\n\nA: That would involve the makers of the EXE file to either open source their program and have it in a source format like a compressed tar.gz or make them the .deb format. The only way right now is to run it with Wine. In this case, since this is the HP Support Assitant\n\nA: You can't convert an Exe to a Deb file as an Exe is a compiled program designed to run on Windows and a Deb is an archive that holds files that will be installed on a system that supports Debian's packages management scheme.\nThe closest solution you will reach given the Wine errors is to run it in a Virtualbox Virtual Machine. This may be enough to \"fool\" (see next paragraph) the HP techs.\nI should also say that having installed Ubuntu you are more than likely violating the terms of the agreement that would provide you with a new battery and even if you do manage to run the software you may already be beyond complying with the exchange agreement.\n", "Q: image format for Screenshot In 12.04, can the image format for Screenshot be jpeg?

Starting and stopping Tomcat should be as easy as\n/etc/init.d/tomcat5.5 start\n/etc/init.d/tomcat5.5 stop\n\nMaybe 5.5 needs to be replaced by the version you are using.\nIf you just downloaded tomcat and are running from your custom unzipped directory, the startup and shutdown scripts provided by Apache should work. Assuming your tomcat is in $TOMCAT_HOME:\n$TOMCAT_HOME/bin/startup.sh\n$TOMCAT_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh\n\nIf all fails, you can always manually kill all java processes\nkillall java\n\nor, if something is REALLY stuck\nkillall -9 java\n\nThese last ones will kill ALL java processes currently running.\n\nA: ps -ef |grep 'catalina'\n\nthen take that pid\nkill -9 $pid\n\nalternatively if you want to free 8080 port \nChange your tomcat port to other than 8080\nvi $CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml\n\nsearch for the following section and then change port number to any thing of you choice.\n<Connector port=\"8080\" protocol=\"HTTP/1.1\"\n           connectionTimeout=\"20000\"\n           redirectPort=\"8443\" />\n\nsave the changes and restart the tomcat.

The title is the question. These tool tips stay until I try to click past them. They're annoying since they constantly pop up and block the view of what I'm trying to do.

How do I disable them?\nI'd post an image as an example, but this site will not let me.\nUPDATE:\nunity 5.16.0\nUPDATE 2: I discovered that this may only be a problem with users who run Ubuntu on a full screen VMware console that is situated on the right monitor.
