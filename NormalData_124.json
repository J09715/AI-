["Q: Live USB ignored during startup I created a live USB using pendrive, but when I start my computer it simply ignores the drive. It tells me \"No bootable device\" (This is normal, there is no OS on the computer), but even when the USB is plugged in. I've tried reinstalling on the drive (no luck), and it won't boot to the drive even when the USB is manually selected from the BIOS menu. \nStrangely enough, on another computer if I open the flash drive on windows and open \"wubi.exe\", then select to restart the computer, it boots from the drive normally.\nAny idea how to fix this?\n\nA: On some computers you have to press a key or key combination on startup to boot from CD or USB. On my Dell I have to press F12 to get a boot menu\n\nA: I'm not sure which method you used to create the bootable USB drive. I have a positive experience with UNetbootin in windows and with Startup Disk Creator in Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Is it safe to delete the .jpg images in my music folder? I'm new to Ubuntu and have used Windows all my life so I don't really know what is normal and what is not. \nWhen I put my music on a flash drive to copy over to Ubuntu from Windows, a huge number of .jpg images come with them but you can only see them in Ubuntu. I was wondering if those where like my album pictures that are on the music, or is it safe to delete them?\nThey are really bothering me but since I don't know how things work outside of Windows I don't know what's safe and what's not. I would really like to delete them, but not if it means removing my cover art from my music.\n\nA: I would suggest to first move the files to some other location and observe if something is unusable. If nothing notable happens for quite a time, you can delete them permanently. Otherwise just restore the files.\nAlthough, this approach is not always good, it works sometimes.\n", "Q: How can I debug what's slowing down new session logins? For a while, I've had an issue whereby it takes up to 5 minutes from the moment I enter my password in Lightdm's login screen until I can do anything with my computer. That's on Ubuntu 12.04.\nDuring that time, I see there is disk activity, but I'm not sure how to figure out what's causing it and whether that is the real cause.\nI've played around with Bootchart unsuccessfully. Any ideas on what the best way to debug this issue is?\n\nA: What I would try is to press Alt-Ctrl-F1 to switch to a text console, log in there and run top in the console. Then switch to the login screen again using Alt-Ctrl-F7, enter your login/password and while it tries to log you in switch back to the text console to see if you can spot any processes which cause the problem.\n\nA: To see what processes are accessing the disk run:\nsudo iotop -o\n\nTo stop the output disappearing after each access and to make the disk I/O cumulative (more useful in my opinion) run:\nsudo iotop -oa\n\nPlay with the options (iotop -h) as required.\nAs I recall iotop needs to be installed with:\nsudo apt-get install iotop.\n\n", "Q: Why can't I install the Pino twitter client in 12.04? I did a search for Pino the twitter client and it comes up but when I click more info it says here is a screen shot of it here:\n\n\nA: It looks like Pino hasn't been updated in almost two years (since January 2011). It was only officially available in Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric., and is not included in 12.04. That's why you get the \"not found\" error.\nYou can install it from this PPA:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal with Ctrl-Alt-T\n\n*Type/paste: sudo apt-add-repository ppa:fabriziosm/ppa-testing\n\n*Then type/paste: sudo apt-get update\n\n*Close the terminal.\n\n\nNow open Software Center, and search for Pino. You should now see an Install button. Install Pino; I tried it on 12.04 and it appears to work.\n\nRelated: Are PPA's safe to add to my system and what are some \"red flags\" to watch out for?\n\n", "Q: Which user is running tomcat? I have a Tomcat 7 server running on Amazon EC2 (OS - Ubuntu 12 LTS). How can I find out which user is running Tomcat on Amazon EC2?\n\nA: Run following command to find out the tomcat process\nps auxwww | grep -v grep | grep tomcat \n\nFrom there you will find out the tomcat process and from there you can see which user is starting this.\nFor eg see the following output\nvidyadhar@ubuntu:~$ ps auxwww | grep -v grep | grep tomcat\nroot      1941  0.2  1.7 419224 35208 ?

I installed Ubuntu with the same partition (c:\\) with Windows 7. \nWhen I boot my computer, the boot manager does not come out and it directly boots into 12.04. So I cannot boot into Windows.\nHow can I make the boot manager come out to choose my boot option?\n\nA: *\n\n*Open a terminal, update the grub by command :\nsudo update-grub\n\n*Reboot the computer and go into BIOS setting (mostly is the delete button)\nchoose the hard-disk as primary boot device\n\n*Save the setting and exit \n\n*The computer will be booted again, and you will find the booting manager comes out \n\n", "Q: Can I remove Compiz and still run Gnome desktop? I just installed Ubuntu 12.04 onto a fairly old desktop machine. I installed Gnome desktop without problem. Nothing else was installed other than g++ and Eclipse. \nI don't know what Compiz is, but I keep getting Compiz crash reports at login now (with gnome classic option). \nIt doesn't seem critical and doesn't effect the running of the machine, at least in an obvious way.\nThe errors seemed to start happening after installing the gnome desktop. Can I ignore this crash report or is it something to be worried about?  Can I remove Compiz or is it crucial to Ubuntu running? \n\nA: Compiz is a compositing window manager for the X Window System, using 3D graphics hardware to create fast compositing desktop effects for window management. \nIt's not crucial to have for Ubuntu to run if you plan on using gnome-classic.\n", "Q: How to adjust monitor color balance with open source radeon drivers? My display is too blueish, I would like to adjust its color balance.\n\nA: Try adjusting it with the xrandr command.\nFirst find your device name by entering:\nxrandr\n\nThere's an output line like:\nLVDS connected 1440x900+0+0 (normal left inverted right x-axis y-axis) 367 mm x 230 mm\n\nThen enter a command like (substituting for your device LVDS):\nxrandr --output LVDS --verbose --gamma 1.0:1.0:1.5\n\nExperiment with value, particularly the last, blue, value, until you like the results.

I have a few launchers in Unity that I might want to run as sudo once or twice, but I have no idea what to type into the terminal.\nAt the moment, crazily, I have to run the app, then search for likely candidates in System Monitor! I don't think the Unity Design team intend, ever, to give us a right-click action on the Dash, or a \"Details\" option if I right-click on a Launcher, so... how do I figure out what's actually being executed when I run a Launcher?\n(for the curious, what I'm struggling with is Desura - it's not in the system path, so I can't just whereis desura, assuming desura is what's actually being run - I'd be guessing)\n[EDIT : using the method I marked as the answer, I can see that Desura installs in my home directory and as it's a non-root install, it doesn't update the system path.]\n\nA: To read the contents of the launcher file you can open gedit and drag&drop a launcher icon from the dash into it. \nGedit will then display the .desktop file for that launcher which is by the way stored in \n/usr/share/applications\n\nin my case for example\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=Desura\nGenericName=Game Manager\nComment=Download and play the best games\nExec=/home/daniel/desura/desura %U\nTryExec=/home/daniel/desura/bin/desura\nPath=/home/daniel/desura\nMimeType=x-scheme-handler/desura;\nIcon=/home/daniel/desura/data/desura.png\nTerminal=false\nCategories=Game;\nStartupNotify=false\n\nNow just look at the 'Exec=' line in that document in my case\nExec=/home/daniel/desura/desura %U\n\nThis will point you to where the executable is stored and tell you the name (desura).\nBy the way...normally it is neither necessary nor a good idea to run desura in root mode.\n\nA: Use the starter file properties\nDrag the icon onto the desktop, right click on it and select \"Proprerties\".

I'm trying to configure all the hardware and make sure that everything is working on an Asus N56VM-S4060x. I've made some progress based on other answers, but there are still a number of things that aren't working.\nFrom a fresh install I have done the following,\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed kernel 3.5 (following these instructions, based on this answer\n\n*Installed asus-wmi (not sure if this is necessary though)\n\n*Installed asus-wmi V999.01\n\n*Installed bumblebee\n\n*Tried to compile the alx module for Ethernet (failed)\n\n\nAfter I installed kernel 3.5 the touchpad right click worked.

Start programs that you want to run with the Geforce card with: optirun program\nYou can test it with glxspheres vs. optirun glxspheres.\nSee here.\nIt worked for me with Asus N76VM and Ubuntu 12.10.

Followed the instructions just as the ReadMe file suggests (navigate to the extracted folder from Terminal, and type \"sudo dpkg -i *.deb\"), but halfway through the installation, I get this error:\nSetting up libreoffice3.6-calc (3.6.0.4-104) ...\nProcessing triggers for menu ...\nIn file \"/usr/share/menu/introduceppa\", at (or in the definition that ends at) line 4:\n?package(introduceppa):needs=\"X11\" section \"Applications/File Management\" title=\"Introduce PPA\" command=\"/usr/bin/introduceppa.gambas\" icon=\"/usr/share/pixmaps/introduceppa.png\"\n                                           ^\nExpected: \"=\"\nSkipping file because of errors...\nWhat does it mean?

I'm about to reinstall Ubuntu on a netbook with a tiny disk. Because of the tiny disk size, I'd strongly prefer to have a swap file than a swap partition. However, I want to be able to hibernate.\nI know that hibernation needs to be manually enabled. I also know that hibernation to a swap file works on the old Eeebuntu that I'll be replacing, so hardware support is not a concern.\nDoes the precise kernel support hibernation to a swap file? What if anything do I need to configure?\nPlease note that I'm looking for reliable, up-to-date information. I don't mind if hibernation isn't supported out-of-the-box, but I'd prefer not to have to recompile a kernel if I can do without. I'll balk at patching the kernel for that machine.\n\nA: As far as I know the file /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume has the parameter from where to fetch the hibernation data and it was originally a device, but in (many) recent versions uses UUID. It defaults to the swap partition you installed and I know this because if you by some chance change your swap partition or UUID you need to update it there and run sudo update-initramfs -u for hibernation to work again. This is true for at least Quantal, Precise and Lucid so I guess its true for current supported versions too.\nThe swap partition must be at least as large as your total memory.\nBe aware that hibernating to swap can be a (physical) security risk if you don't use full disk encryption (LUKS via the alternative install cd). It's possible to use the data on the swap to find the vectors to decrypt your gnome keyring passwords.\n\nA: I did not try to use it, but I found the following HOWTO:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1042946\nThis seems to explain quite nicely how to create the swap file and prepare it to use with hibernation. Hope that helps.\n\nA: It's not recommended.  From the Community documentation at: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq/\n\n\"The advantages of a swap file are many, but it is problematic for using the default \"swsusp\" hibernation method for powerless sleep.\"\n\nNow \"problematic\" does not mean impossible but in the context of your original question I'd have to say that no, it is not supported, and is not available out of the box.\n", "Q: How to get breadcrumbs in nautilus?

It worked fine under Debian, but I disliked the GUI, so I decided to give Ubuntu a try.\nI downloaded a copy of the PowerPC Desktop ISO, but the GUI was messed up: most of the screen was taken up by a large white rectangle, which was presumably supposed to be a window, but didn't load properly. Nothing happened when I clicked on the menus at the top, except for the one in the top-right corner that has shutdown options. I tried to restart it using that, but I didn't get a dialog or anything, so I finally ended up using control-command-power to force a reboot.\nI then tried the alternate ISO to see if I could just use the textual installer. That worked, and I don't remember having any problems with the login screen, but after that, I had the same problems as with the live disc. I had no problems using the tty's, though, which is mostly what I did under Debian.\nI later found that if you want full-disk encryption, you must set it up at install time. So I rebooted to the alternate disc and wiped the entire hard disk again, choosing the entire hard disk with encrypted LVM option during partitioning. The installation completed successfully, but now when I try to boot, I get just a black screen after the yaboot menus, no password prompt or anything.

I have old P4 Computer that I've installed Ubuntu 12.04 on, and it works fine when connected to a monitor using VGA to VGA connection.\nI tried connecting the PC to my 44inch television using a VGA (from PC) to RCA Component cord (Red, Green Blue). \nI've connected the sound card of the PC to the Composite RCA (Red, White, Yellow). \nNothing shows up on the television. It's just black. Not even the booting shows up. I disconnected the composite and left only the component connected. Still nothing.\nShould I change something in the Ubuntu settings prior to connecting it to the television, or am I trying to perform something that is impossible? \nShould I be using a VGA to Composite instead?\n\nA: Good question. You will need 2 cables, one for sound and one for video.\nFor Video you will need a VGA to whatever is supported on your TV's end. For example a VGA to RCA cable, a VGA to Composite Cable, VGA to DVI, VGA to S-Video, etc..\nI can confirm in my case that VGA to RCA works with Ubuntu using an Nvidia or Intel card. If you have an Nvidia card you need to open nvidia-settings and go to the option that searches for new devices. If you have an Intel card, you just need to plug it in and you are done. VGA to DVI and VGA to S-Video also work.\nWith the sound is easier. I haven't found yet a combination that does not work. Most of the problems are related to VGA to X cable. The only issues you should know is a direct HDMI to VGA will not work. This is because HDMI is Digital and VGA is analog. The only way this will work directly (With the same cable) is if your video cards supports digital output through a VGA port. In any other case you will need a VGA to HDMI converter.\n", "Q: HDMI initially worked, no more and screen issues when try Connected my System76 Lemur Ultra (Intel i5 3210M + Intel HD 4000) to my television.

How do you configure proxy settings in the Ubuntu Server or Minimal (CLI) versions using the terminal?\n\nA: System-wide proxies in CLI Ubuntu/Server must be set as environment variables.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the /etc/environment file with vi (or your favorite editor). This file stores the system-wide variables initialized upon boot.\n\n*Add the following lines, modifying appropriately. You must duplicate in both upper-case and lower-case because (unfortunately) some programs only look for one or the other:\n\nhttp_proxy=\"http://myproxy.server.com:8080/\"\nhttps_proxy=\"http://myproxy.server.com:8080/\"\nftp_proxy=\"http://myproxy.server.com:8080/\"\nno_proxy=\"localhost,127.0.0.1,localaddress,.localdomain.com\"\nHTTP_PROXY=\"http://myproxy.server.com:8080/\"\nHTTPS_PROXY=\"http://myproxy.server.com:8080/\"\nFTP_PROXY=\"http://myproxy.server.com:8080/\"\nNO_PROXY=\"localhost,127.0.0.1,localaddress,.localdomain.com\"\n\n\n*apt-get, aptitude, etc. will not obey the environment variables when used normally with sudo. So separately configure them; create a file called 95proxies in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/, and include the following:\n\nAcquire::http::proxy \"http://myproxy.server.com:8080/\";\nAcquire::ftp::proxy \"ftp://myproxy.server.com:8080/\";\nAcquire::https::proxy \"https://myproxy.server.com:8080/\";\n\nFinally, logout and reboot to make sure the changes take effect.\n\nSources: 1, 2.

But that doesnt work either. Could someone please tell ,me how to resize my /dev/sda1 partition.\n\n\nA: Simplified answer from the previous post article:\nIn gparted:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open sda2and resize it to fit all the unallocated space.\n\n*Open sda5 and move linux-swap all the way to the right, at the end of the disk.\n\n*Open sda2 again and resize it with the left handle to fit only sda5 size on right corner, leaving unnalocated space to the left.\n\n\n\n\n\n*gparted will then allow you to resize sda1 and increase its size, and apply changes.\n\n\n\n\nA: The extended sda2 partition is in the way. Do one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*If Gparted allows, move sda2 to the very right, and then you'll be able to expand sda1.\n\n*Alternatively, delete sda2, expand sda1 by 2GB and then recreated your swap partition (an extended partition isn't required if you have 4 or less primary partitions).\n\n\nA: To expand sda1 I booted into a gparted live disc and then I deleted the sda2 and extended the sda1. Gparted left 1mb over. When I booted it was alright. (Tip: when you close gparted you have to double click on exit)(Tip: do a backup - at one stage I did lose everything! luckily I had a backup)\n\nA: I had this trouble and the blog post by: JOCHEN HEBBRECHT worked really well for me! It describes how to delete the annoying partitions and resize the repartition you want to.\nThe essential solution:\nusing gParted\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on the partitions you dont want and select swapoff\n\n*Right-click on it again and select delete\n\n*Ignore the warnings\n\n*Resize and apply\n\n*Restart VM/machine\n\nThis worked for me and didnt corrupt what I already had installed.

I am unable to install Ubuntu alongside Windows, so I am considering replacing Windows completely. \nBut since I have not been given a wWindows installation CD, I am concerned that Ubuntu may give me the following trouble that it is giving when I select \"Try Ubuntu\" during installation: All versions of Ubuntu that I tried (10.10, 11.04, and 12.04) would either freeze to the purple Ubuntu background, or as in 12.04, to a blank screen. \nI corrected the blank screen by selecting nomodeset in the beginning. But when I try to shutdown or quit an installation, it does not turn off my laptop completely, but freezes to the purple screen. I am forced to shutdown the laptop by keeping the power button pressed, once I hear that the CD has stopped spinning. \nI do not want to install Ubuntu, replace windows, and then find that I can use neither. \nI am not sure if this is relevant, but the installation usually gives a message like failed to enable MSI-X, but then proceeds with it. \n\nA: I am having similar problems with my m6 1045dx.

I get this error when I try do sudo su\nreputa@reputa:~$ sudo su\nCannot execute csh: No such file or directory\n\nsudo -i is working fine but I want to use sudo su. How do I make it happen?\n\nA: Your root's (su) profile is set to use csh instead of the usual bash.\nRun sudo apt-get install tcsh to install it, and your problem should be solved.\n\nA: It seems you are using csh shell as your root login shell. So you can either install the missing shell using @izx answer. Or just change the default login shell of your root to a valid, installed login shell.\nYou can change the login shell of the root with command:\nsudo chsh -s /bin/bash root\n\nSo now bash will become the login shell of root.

This makes the Ubuntu project seem somewhat out of date?\n\nA: \nwhy do some releases of programs take such a long time to load where\n  others do not\n\nSince most programs are based on either GTK+ or Qt library, only one of these will perform efficiently depending on whether your desktop is GTK+ or Qt based. The reason for extra load is the overhead that is involved in loading the other libraries that are not native. In your case, Firefox is GTK+ that opens quickly since Ubuntu is also GTK+ based, whereas Skype is Qt based, which will perform better on a KDE based desktop such as Kubuntu, and not Ubuntu.\n\nWhose responsibility is it to load new software and why isn't the\n  Ubuntu Center one of the first point of calls for such uploads.\n\nFrom what I understand of your question, you are trying to install new packages from the Ubuntu Software Centre. Personally, I've never liked the clunkiness of this application, and I use Synaptics package manager instead, that gives more control on what packages are installed and is transparent about the dependencies, repositories, etc. which is not the case with the Software Centre.

I just installed 12.04 (WUBI actually) and I wanted to learn a bit about buffer overflow. Unfortunately when I try to use a function like puts() and gets() in an incorrect manner (that is, to cause a buffer overflow), gcc tells me that it detected smashing the stack and terminate my program. \nHow do I enable stack overflow?  \nFor more clarity, This is the program:  \n#include<stdio.h>\n\nCanNeverExecute()\n{\n    printf(\"I can never execute\\n\");\n    exit(0);\n}\n\nGetInput()\n{\n    char buffer[8];\n\n    gets(buffer);\n    puts(buffer);\n}\n\nmain()\n{\n    GetInput();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nA: I don't think what you are doing is a stack overflow. That is what happens when you recurse too deeply into a function, causing you to run out of stack frames.\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n    return main(argc, argv);\n}\n\nWhat you are trying to achieve is a buffer overflow on the stack. I think you are hoping to write to the return address and then make it call CanNeverExecute.\nThen you get stack smashing detected, from gcc's stack protector. You can disable it using gcc -fno-stack-protector. Of course, don't ever do that with programs you intend on running for production.\n\nA: First of all, using any function in an incorrect manner is not recommended. Even if you do so, most of the times the code will not work.\nAlso, as far as I know \"Stack Overflow\" is a runtime error, which usually occurs when you try to store something which has a size larger than the size of the allotted stack.\n\nA: You can not \"enable stack overflow\" - this is a name of a class of errors which can happen in C and other languages. See Wikipedia article for details.\nSo, basically, stack overflow is what's happening with your program and what makes the program to terminate.\nIn a simple program, either staring at the code long enough until you see the error or using a debugger (called gdb) to go through the program step by step should help you to find the problem.\n\nA: This question on Stack Overflow lists almost all possible ways to cause Stack overflows in many languages.\n", "Q: How do I replace a directory with a symlink and retain the folder emblem? I want to replace the folders in my home/ directory with symlinks to folders in another location, but I want to retain the folder emblems without having to go searching for them.

Luckily, if you delete the home folder sub-directories (documents, downloads, etc.) and replace them with symlinks, the icons will automatically reappear if the names are the same.\nPrior to Ubuntu 18.04:\nThis can be done using the \"merge folder\" functionality of Nautilus (the default file browser in Ubuntu).\nSimply create the symlink in another location with the same name as the folder you want to replace, then copy and paste it into your home folder.\nA dialog will appear asking if you want to merge the folders and you should click the Merge button and you will now have a new symlink with name and folder emblems of the old folder.\nWARNING: From my testing, this doesn't appear to be a true 'merge' (it's more like a useful--albeit potentially dangerous--bug), any files or subdirectories in the folder you are replacing with the symlink appear to be deleted (aka, only replace empty folders if you don't want to lose files). Proceed with caution!\nWARNING: Also, absolutely do not replace a folder that itself contains symlinks or it will follow the symlinks and recursively delete everything in the target directories.\n\nThis gets the job done, but if someone knew a command line alternative with the same results I would be very happy.\n", "Q: Quickly, setup.py, long_description - how to make them generate a multi-paragraph description in the debian control file? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to define multiline long_description in quickly's setup.py? \n\nHow can I make Quickly convert the long_description in setup.py into several paragraphs in the debian control file? \nQuickly throws the error below if I put \"\\n\" in the text, and every other way I try just leads to one long one-paragraph description (i.e. everything concatenated in a single paragraph).\nGenerally - can we use any type of markup - bullets, etc.?

Theoretically, if other media players followed the same specification, they would also have access to the same album art, but as far as I know, Banshee is the only media player that has implemented support for this spec.\nInstead, you may wish to use one of Banshee's Community Extensions, banshee-extension-albumartwriter, which allows you to save the album art as a cover.jpg file inside the folder containing the audio file. This isn't quite what you're asking for, but it's much more widely supported by other music players, and it has the benefit of not duplicating the image file inside each individual track.\nIf this solution doesn't meet your needs, your only option may be to use another tool to do the job.\n", "Q: Ubuntu - Patch Diff merge issue i have two text files test1.txt and test2.txt with content as\n test1.txt\n 1\n 2\n\n test2.txt\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4 \n\nwhat i have achieved with the txt files is a difference of both files in a third file as\n\ndiff test2.txt test1.txt > test.patch\npatch test.txt < test.patch\n\nin text.txt i have the resultant difference of both files.\nNow i am doing the same with CSV files.\nThe format for CSV files is like\nHENRY CONSTANTINE | 02256 | MEDICAL | Speciality\n\ndiff small2.csv small1.csv > small.patch\npatch small.csv < small.patch\n\n*Note: I have created the small.csv file manually.\nBut i get the following error when i run the patch\npatching file small.csv\nHunk #1 FAILED at 1.\n1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file small.csv.rej\n\nDoes anyone have any idea of how to achieve the above Difference file for CSV files.\n\nA: If you want to include the file name information, use -u option:\ndiff -u test2.txt test1.txt > test.patch\n\nIn this case, you can use the below command:\npatch -o test.txt < test.patch\n\nIf you return to the original contents, you can use the below command:\npatch -R test.txt < test.patch\n\n", "Q: How to automatically boot without asking for username and password?

Adding the -a option tells getty to call the login program with the -f option to sign that user in, bypassing the user prompt from getty and the password prompt from login.\nUpstart is the Ubuntu system that operates as the kernel init process (process 1).\nI tested this on my tty6 and it worked great. Because of the upstart respawn line if you exit the shell it will start back up again automatically.\nSystemd Versions of Ubuntu\nNewer versions of Ubuntu use mostly systemd to manage system processes. Therefore there are new ways of doing things.\nsystemd tty usage is also a little different with graphics terminals possibly running on the first few virtual terminals. tty6 is reserved to be a text virtual terminal with systemd and there will probably be others as well.\nTo have tty6 come up signed on as you enter:\nsudo systemctl edit getty@tty6\n\nA nano editor will come up in a temporary file. Enter the following into that editor:\n [Service]\n ExecStart=\n ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty -o '-p -f gruber' -a gruber --noclear %I $TERM\n\nExit the editor.\nPutting in the extra ExecStart= line is not a typo. it's very important as it tells systemd to forget about the original ExecStart parameter it already knows about (from /lib/systemd/system/getty@.service) so you can replace ExecStart.\nYou can check the results with the following command:\n systemd-analyze verify getty@tty6.service\n\nI see some warnings there when I try this, but not about what we are doing here.\nIf there is already a tty process going on tty6 you'll have to restart it to see the results.\n\nTo figure this out I referred to the excellent answer at https://askubuntu.com/a/659268/63886. There Muru happened to use the same goal as an example on how to tailor systemd. His ExecStart line is:\n ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty -a muru --noclear %I $TERM\n\nThe difference appears to be a couple more systemd related environmental variables appear in my version.\nThe end result of the above edit is the creation of a file called override.conf in /etc/systemd/system/getty@tty6.service.d/ containing just what you typed above. If you were to create such a file yourself you would need to run the systemctl daemon-reload command to get systemd to recognize it, and again then possibly restarting any existing agetty process on that virtual console. systemctl --edit takes care of the daemon-reload for you.\n\nA: sudo gedit etc/default/grub\nand replace \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nto \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"text\"\nAlso comment GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0 This line is for unhiding the GRUB menu \n(comment is to put \"#\" in the line ) \nsudo update-grub\nand to start the x just type\nstartx\n\nA: sudo update-rc.d -f gdm remove\n\nIf you use Kubuntu, replace gdm with kdm in the command above.\nif it still does the graphical boot/shutdown, but it will drop you at the command line after boot.

When you need to update, it is basically comparing the vesrion of the package you have installed and the version of the package in the repositories. So in short, apt-get update and apt-get upgrade will upgrade the package as long as the package is in the repositories installed on the second machine.\n\nA: Assuming you use apt-get download to download the packages, copy them to the \"isolated\" machine and install with sudo dpkg -i *.deb (or similar), then yes, apt-get will know that these packages/versions have been installed and will upgrade them if necessary.\n\nA: It depends on the type of Package installation you do. If you install packages VIA officially provided .deb package then you don't have to worry .\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade will work flawlessly , even if you are doing an offline update and connect it to Internet sometime later , it will work.\n\nA: In cases where .deb files are not available you can also download the source and build it yourself.

Please provide solutions with no need to install new stuff.  \nThanks in advance\n\nA: There is a command called (in an excess of originality) rename, that allows you to rename files using regular expressions.\nIn this case, you probably want to do:\nrename 's/\\*//' files...\n\nWhich will remove the first * character found in each filename.\nYou can use rename -n to list the renames that will be performed without actually doing them if you're worried about the regex not being correct.\n\nA: Ubuntu comes with the rename command which can rename files by regular expressions.\nIf all your files are located in the same folder, you can simply do the following:\nrename s/\\\\*$// *\n\n(\\\\* is an escaped *, $ is the end of the file name. A match will be replaced with nothing.)\nIf all your files are in a directory structure, you can use find:\nfind / -exec rename s/\\\\*$// {} \\;\n\nWhich executes rename /\\\\*$// on every file and directory on you system.

All instructions available here\n\nA: I find Burp Suite really handy. It is not Open Source but it is written in Java (works everywhere) and it has community edition. Supports HTTPS, other features are called Essential manual tools\n\nA: You can try Charles Proxy.\nI've been using it a while and it works well.\n\nA: NetTool is one the best tools as Suggested by Mitch\nYou should also try out Webscarab. WebScarab is a framework for analysing applications that communicate using the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.\n\nA: \nNetTool is a developer tool for monitoring and manipulating\n  application-level network messages, particularly useful for debugging\n  web applications and web services. There are two components to\n  NetTool: the HTTP Client, and the TCP Tunnel.1\nParos is for web application security assessment.  It is free of\n  charge and completely written in Java. Through Paros's proxy nature,\n  all HTTP and HTTPS data between server and client, including cookies\n  and form fields, can be intercepted and modified.2\n\n1Source:Sourceforge\n1Source:Paroproxy\n\nA: I used the free tool wire shark. https://www.wireshark.org/.

Easiest way of control this is to set up the IPv6 network yourself, then your MS Windows machines will not start the tunnel.\nAnd yes, all modern OS:es, even MS Windows Vista, generates link local IPv6 addresses automatically, dhcpd or not. That is part of being IPv6 compliant.  So, what addresses are your clients and Ubuntu server getting? Only need to see the net prefix, which is at most the first 64 bits of the IPv6 address. The last 64 bits can be built based on the computers MAC address, so if you are paranoid, replace them with x:es.\nYou should/could install Wireshark in the Ubuntu server which runs the dhcpd server and collect all traffic to/from your dhcpd server ports (there are two of them) .  Then you can see what the dhcpd server actually send to your MS Windows machines.  \nIf you want to change start settings for a server in your Ubuntu/Debian machine, look in the directory /etc/defaults for a suitable file.  Also check the man pages for options you want to send to the server when it starts.\n\nA: Run sudo netstat -lnp | fgrep :547 and make sure something is running on this port. If not you are not serving IPV6 addresses from anywhere on the computer you are looking at. \nIf something is running on that port and you can't figure out how to stop it you can try  to change /etc/services and change the four dhcpv6 entries to an unused port number and restart the program in question. Programs which properly call getservbyname() will use the port specified. A dhcp server operating on the wrong port won't serve anyone.\n\nAnders correctly points out that computers can assign their own link-level addresses. I don't have a IPV6 dhcp service on my network and yet I have such addresses. \nwlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:21:63:6d:2e:97  \n          inet addr:192.168.1.34  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::221:63ff:fe6d:2e97/64 Scope:Link\nNote that the link address begins with fe80 and contains, with an addition in the middle, the hardware address from the first line, the rest is zeros.\nIf you want to trace down what might trigger the windows behaviour you can use a sniffer like Wireshark to compare the packets sent by the two dhcp servers. The dhcp3 server in question also has a -tf option that should save its dhcp traffic to a file.\n", "Q: Is my Amazon EC 2 running Amazon Linux or Ubuntu? I am a little confused here.

Is it so? Are there any solutions to this problem?\n\nA: Yes, installing Wine itself is safe; it's installing/running Windows programs with Wine that you have to be careful of.\nregedit.exe is a valid utility and it's not going to make Wine or Ubuntu vulnerable on its own.\nJust like Windows, you should only download/run legitimate programs, etc., never run Wine with sudo privileges, make sure Wine doesn't have write access to any other important data like your home, Windows drives, etc.\nAlso try installing the ClamAV antivirus which is available in Ubuntu.\n\nA: Install wine is totally safe. About the possibility of being infected while running some program in Wine, it depends. But the chances are very, very small.\nA lot of viruses works using some kernel or Windows API vulnerability. But Wine doesn't implement a kernel and doesn't use the Windows API, but reimplements it. The viruses that works this way can't infect a Linux computer with Wine installed.\nThe only concern are some Windows programs that access the Internet and can have some vulnerability. If a virus works infecting this kind of program, then perhaps it can infect them when running under Wine.\nBut even if you run this kind of program, the virus wouldn't be able to spread to your Linux installation. And it would run only during the infected app execution, wouldn't be able to autorun automaticly in your system and could be easily wiped out cleaning the .wine directory. This kind of infection is very unlikely.\n\nA: From Wine wiki \n\nSecurity\nBecause of Wine's ability to run Windows binary code, concerns have\n  been raised over native Windows viruses and malware affecting\n  Unix-like operating systems Wine can run much malware, but\n  programs running in Wine are confined to the Current user's\n  Privileges, restricting some undesirable consequences. This is one\n  reason Wine should never be run as the superuser.\n\nWhich basically means , you should never run wine with su or Sudo privileges . And rest assured , you  are safe from  Windows Malware , since it mostly runs as Compatibility layer more or less like emulator but not entirely i guess.\n\nA: Yes wine is tottally safe to install. Even if you (somehow) managed to get a virus on a wine drive it is trivial to wipe it and start again. Furthermore few viruses work on wine. \nOn a related not I would recommend using PlayOnLinux if you want to use wine. It makes it so much easier to manage everything.\n", "Q: swapon --all --verbose : 'read swap header failed: Invalid argument' Recently ran through EnableHibernateWithEncryptedSwap and ran the following command: swapon --all --verbose and received: 'read swap header failed: Invalid argument'\nHow do I fix this?

AFAIK, I'm running the out-of-the-box window config: GNOME3, Compiz, Metacity, Unity.  \nBoth Compiz and Metacity bind Ctrl+Alt+S, which REALLY threw me because I kept trying to edit the keybinding for compiz as a number of posts indicate (or rather org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings).  But this changed nothing that I could see, even after restarting X.\nIn frustration I tried to edit the Metacity keybindings, which succeeded immediately (no need to restart unity, compiz or X.)  Here's the command line:\ngconftool-2 --unset /apps/metacity/window_keybindings/toggle_shaded\n\nCheck $HOME/.gconf/apps/metacity/window_keybindings/%gconf.xml for the changes.  \nI monitored changes to all files in my $HOME via man:find while trying the various config editors: gnome-control-center, ccsm, dconf-editor, gconftool-2 to see what changed.\ndconf-editor worked well for compiz.  My understanding is compiz and metacity work together to render the display but I don't know how.  And I think there are a number of pluggable window managers that work with compiz, so that may further complicate the issue.\n\nA: Also don't forget to check if you've activated the Screenshot Window Sizer extension in GNOME Tweak Tool. It maps the Ctrl+Alt+S to resize gnome windows in various 16:9 formats.\n\nA: I figured out that the following worked in my case. First, instead of trying to disable the shortcut, give it a new key combination. I did this in System Settings -> Keyboard Layout -> Layouts -> Options..., but it's a known bug that these settings are not respected in Gnome Shell.\nAdditionally, use dconf-editor to give it the same key combination:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open dconf-editor (Alt-F2, enter dconf-editor)\n\n*Expand until the element: org → gnome → desktop → wm → keybindings.\n\n*Change the value for the correct key (in your case, this should be show-desktop).\n\n\nIn my case, I wanted C-M-s be respected in Emacs, and not roll up the current window. So instead of trying to disable the shortcut by using brackets in dconf-editor, I gave toggle-shaded a new key combination: ['<Control><Super>s']. And suddenly, C-M-s was available in Emacs. Hope this helps for you, too.\n", "Q: Where is Ubuntu installed? I installed Ubuntu 12.04 along with Windows XP. But now on the boot menu Ubuntu doesn't show up. I checked the drive in wich i installed Ubuntu, and that drive is also empty.. What do i do now?\n\nA: Windows cannot see the contents of your Ubuntu partition\nUbuntu uses the Ext filesystem by default. Windows doesn't know what this filesystem is, so unless you specifically told Ubuntu to format its partition using NTFS (the Windows filesystem), Windows will see it as empty.\nTo see if the partition is actually empty, boot into your live CD again and see if it can see the contents of your Ubuntu partition. Chances are, it will. If not, then something did, in fact, go wrong with your installation and you should try again.\nGrub is probably not loading right for some reason\nSometimes, Grub, the little program that allows you to choose which operating system, doesn't get installed quite right. (Sometimes, it conflicts with the Windows loader, which serves the same purpose.) There are a couple of things you can do to fix it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu again. This is kind of a nuclear option, but if it's a fresh install, anyway, it won't hurt anything. It would probably be a good idea to check the disk for errors before installing (you can find that option on the disk's initial menu).\n\n*Update/repair Grub. If you are comfortable, and can drop into a Linux terminal/command line environment, either through your boot menu, or through the Live CD, you may be able to update grub with sudo update-grub. Here's a similar AskUbuntu answer with step-by-step instructions on how to do this. This should fix any errors or conflicts encountered and re-establish Grub as the bootloader.\nIt could be some other edge-case problem\nIf you do one of the two options in the \"Grub is not loading right\" section and you're still not getting anywhere, it might be something like this problem, where OS Prober got disabled somehow.\nAnother possibility is that Ubuntu somehow didn't get added to Grub's menu list. This post explains how you can temporarily edit the command that Grub runs, which may allow you to boot into your Ubuntu install. From there, you can install a Grub customizer to edit your Grub list. This is a rather advanced option and so should probably not be used unless you've tried the above and are comfortable with the command line.\nIf none of these things work, then you'll probably need to post more information to this question so that we can better determine the underlying cause of the problem you're having.\n", "Q: How to get an Ubuntu system that boots to the command line to start the GUI?

How do I in general find out, what the very nice \"System Settings GUI\" in Ubuntu (say 12.04) does and how to replicate the changes in command line?\nMany people ask questions like \"how to change the keyboard rate using command line\", and often the answers do not help and are hard to find.\nWhat is the easiest way to find out, what the GUI is actually changing (for various types of settings. I.e. keyboard layout, rate, mouse, network, ...)\n\nA: Not sure if this will answer your question because I don't use GNOME, but you can try running\ndconf watch /\n\nand see if it lists anything while you change the settings.\n\nA: There is no general way to do this.\nMost Gnome programs do not use command line programs as slaves to set up things. \nSometimes a useful command line program is apropos which searches the headlines of man pages for keywords.

If so, that should be fixed by:\nsudo apt-get install linux\n\nFurther explanation:\nBecause of technical reasons it's not wise for the kernels to be upgraded and replaced with the new one (i.e. let's say if the new one fails you may still boot into the old one).\nThus they are packaged under the names like linux-image-3.2.0-24-generic.\nSo, if you upgrade the system, technically there is no update to this version! Unless you install the linux metapackage which always depends on the latest kernel, meaning that whenever an update to the kernel is available, linux will change version, and it will depend on the newer kernel, and thus the new kernel will be automatically installed.\nRemember that your older kernel won't be removed this way, which is a good thing.

I wish to use mplayer to generate thumbnails for nautilus, so I wrote a perl script as the thumbnailer named \"gnome_thumbnailer_with_mplayer\", and wrote a description in /usr/share/thumbnailers to tell the system to find the thumbnailer. \nAt the beginning, the description is:\n[Thumbnailer Entry]\nTryExec=/home/allfox/programs/gnome_thumbnailer_with_mplayer\nExec=/home/allfox/programs/gnome_thumbnailer_with_mplayer %u %o %s\nMimeType=application/vnd.rn-realmedia;application/mxf;application/ogg;application/ram;application/sdp;application/vnd.ms-wpl;application/x-extension-m4a;application/x-extension-mp4;application/x-flash-video;application/x-matroska;application/x-netshow-channel;application/x-ogg;application/x-quicktimeplayer;application/x-shorten;image/vnd.rn-realpix;image/x-pict;misc/ultravox;text/x-google-video-pointer;video/3gpp;video/dv;video/fli;video/flv;video/mp2t;video/mp4;video/mp4v-es;video/mpeg;video/msvideo;video/ogg;video/quicktime;video/vivo;video/vnd.divx;video/vnd.rn-realvideo;video/vnd.vivo;video/webm;video/x-anim;video/x-avi;video/x-flc;video/x-fli;video/x-flic;video/x-flv;video/x-m4v;video/x-matroska;video/x-mpeg;video/x-ms-asf;video/x-ms-asx;video/x-msvideo;video/x-ms-wm;video/x-ms-wmv;video/x-ms-wmx;video/x-ms-wvx;video/x-nsv;video/x-ogm+ogg;video/x-theora+ogg;video/x-totem-stream;audio/x-pn-realaudio;audio/3gpp;audio/ac3;audio/AMR;audio/AMR-WB;audio/basic;audio/midi;audio/mp2;audio/mp4;audio/mpeg;audio/ogg;audio/prs.sid;audio/vnd.rn-realaudio;audio/x-aiff;audio/x-ape;audio/x-flac;audio/x-gsm;audio/x-it;audio/x-m4a;audio/x-matroska;audio/x-mod;audio/x-mp3;audio/x-mpeg;audio/x-ms-asf;audio/x-ms-asx;audio/x-ms-wax;audio/x-ms-wma;audio/x-musepack;audio/x-pn-aiff;audio/x-pn-au;audio/x-pn-wav;audio/x-pn-windows-acm;audio/x-realaudio;audio/x-real-audio;audio/x-sbc;audio/x-speex;audio/x-tta;audio/x-wav;audio/x-wavpack;audio/x-vorbis;audio/x-vorbis+ogg;audio/x-xm;application/x-flac;\n\nEverything works.

I thought the only change I made is the TryExec and Exec path, and the new path contains a space, this maybe the problem, how can I fix it?\nI'm using 12.04 LTS.\n\nA: For the record, you can also synchronize other folders in your home directory with Ubuntu One, rather than simply copying all the files you want synchronized into ~/Ubuntu One.\nAlso, you can use quotes in the Exec line (not sure about TryExec). So Exec=\"/home/allfox/Ubuntu One/fun_goods/thumbnailer/gnome_thumbnailer_with_mplayer\" %u %o %s should work. You can try using the quotes in TryExec as well. If the quotes don't work there, you can also probably just remove the TryExec line, and it should work.\nAlso of note, is that Ubuntu One does not preserve permissions bits, so the executable bit on the script may have been lost, and thus the script would fail to execute as a result.\n\nA: Thanks for dobey's direction! It is a quoting problem.\nI read a document here: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html\nThere are two rules: 1-We should use \\s to represent space in normal lines; 2-The Exec line is special, if there is space in any part of it, we have to quote that part.\nFor the TryExec line, it is a normal line, so I should write TryExec=/home/allfox/Ubuntu\\sOne/fun_goods/thumbnailer/gnome_thumbnailer_with_mplayer.\nFor the Exec line, I should write Exec=\"/home/allfox/Ubuntu One/fun_goods/thumbnailer/gnome_thumbnailer_with_mplayer\" %u %o %s.\nNow, it is working ;)\nWhy those specifications do not use the same rule on all lines?

The log file should show MongoDB attempting to start and report an error message if it fails.\nRepair\nIf the logs indicate that you need to repair your database, there are two points to bear in  mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*By default, mongod expects the database files to be in /data/db/, but the Ubuntu packages configure it to look in /var/lib/mongodb/. So if you run mongod directly rather than using the upstart scripts, you need to tell it where your database files are by adding a --dbpath argument.\n\n*When running mongod using upstart, it will run as the mongodb user which is the user that owns the database files. If you run mongod using sudo without specifying a user then you will end up with database files owned by root. So you need to add a -u argument to sudo.\n\n\nIf your database files are currently owned by root you will need to change their ownership back to mongodb before MongoDB can use them again:\nsudo chown -R mongodb:mongodb /var/lib/mongodb/\n\nTL;DR\nTo run a repair on MongoDB when using the packaged distribution, you need to run:\nsudo -u mongodb mongod --repair --dbpath /var/lib/mongodb/\n\n\nA: I also had similar problem of starting mongod.exe in my machine (Windows installation).  The was a .lock file in C:\\data\\db which was causing the problem.  I deleted that file and the issue got resolved. \n\nA: Had a similar problem, cause was kinda stupid; I was out of disk space.\nChecking the logs at /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log I spotted the following line:\n2015-04-13T10:56:37.132+0200 [initandlisten] ERROR: Insufficient free space for journal files\n\nHoping this saves somebody half an hour of their life.\n", "Q: How can I get python stack trace information using GDB?

It turns out that py-spy (https://github.com/benfred/py-spy) has a more robust implementation of Python backtrace dumping that doesn't rely on having accurate debug symbols available. However, as it also uses ptrace, you will have to detach gdb first. Here's how to make it work:\n\n*\n\n*Do your thing in gdb, getting to the breakpoint you want to get the Python backtrace for.\n\n*Make gdb pass through SIGSTOP with handle SIGSTOP noprint nostop pass\n\n*Pause the process with signal SIGSTOP\n\n*Detach gdb with detach. Note the PID\n\n*Run py-spy dump --pid $PID in another terminal. This gives you your backtrace.\n\n*You can keep running gdb with attach $PID. Note that you can continue the process even if it is SIGSTOP'ed and it will run as normal, and will continue to be paused if you detach again\n\n\nA: Here's the problem: to have access to debugging symbols in GDB, you must invoke a different binary: \"python-dbg\" instead of \"python\" (found this in /usr/share/doc/python2.7-dbg/README.debug).\n\nA: Maybe this helps someone: The binary is named python2.7-dbg on my Debian system, coming from the python2.7-dbg package. I also installed the python2.7-dev package and apt-get source python2.7-dbg, so that gdb could find the source files to the Python interpreter.\nWith all this in place, I managed to debug the SIGSEGV I was running into: https://bugs.python.org/issue34870\n", "Q: High RAM eaters in Ubuntu servers actually what are the High RAM eaters in Ubuntu server , is there any such things ? \nI just want to know .

From within top, press O (that's shift + the letter o), then n, then press Enter - it will now be sorted by memory usage\n\nA: It usually depends on what you are running exactly. Basic apache, postgres, or other services don't really use a lot of RAM not doing anything. But if you have very large databases, and poorly written/designed web pages, which are getting loaded constantly, then those services can start consuming more and more resources.\n", "Q: Why \"fdisk -l\" does not give any output in terminal? When I do fdisk -l in terminal there is no output? What can be the probable reason? How to fix it?\n\nA: You need to prefix the command with sudo, then enter your password.  \nsudo fdisk -l\n\n\nA: Because fdisk is a menu-driven program for creation and manipulation of partition tables. Therefore it requires sudoers or root access \ntry using \nsudo fdisk -l.\n\nA: You need to do a sudo fdisk -l  or first sudo su then fdisk -l.\n", "Q: Second HDD not booting Ubuntu 12.04 I have 2 HDDs.

After sometime, Kernel Panic: vfs: Not Syncing error. I can't boot into Ubuntu in any way. Help please.\n\nA: I found the alternative to this problem.\nI first booted into XP, and through Components services, I freed the memory allocated to Ubuntu, and reallocated it to the partition to which it belonged.\nI then Booted into Ubuntu LiveCD, and selected Install Alongside Windows. After that, Ubuntu installer automatically selected the Second HDD in which I previously installed it. Then I allocated the desired space for Ubuntu and successfully installed.\nThen I restarted, gone into Boot Menu and made Hard Drive the 1st boot device, and the Second HDD as Primary Boot Drive. then I booted into XP and found that the Space allocated to Ubuntu was from the very Partition which I was trying to take.\nUnfortunately, the Manual Partition didn't worked out for me, but this alternative got me XP and Ubuntu installed in two different Drives just the way I wanted.

If it is under warranty (as it should be), you should be able to replace it for almost free (may need to pay shipping), by getting an RMA from the manufacturer of it. You'll have to contact their support and do that.\nOr you can use the opportunity to upgrade to better quality, faster, or more RAM, if your system isn't maxed out already in that respect.\n\nA: I know grub has configuration options for bad ram, take a look at /etc/default/grub. However you might want to consult grubs documentation as this might only apply on grub, and not on the booting kernel. \n", "Q: Why few commands (eg: fdisk -l) do not inform user \"you do not have privilege\"? Few commands that need to do sudo remind you that \"You do not have the privilege\" or \"Are you  root?\" etc. \nwhile a few commands do not give such message. For example, if you do fdisk -l instead of sudo fdisk -l ubuntu does not give any message. This is particularly confusing for people who come from different linux distro (eg: CentOS, RHEL etc.).\nWouldn't it be a good idea to notify user each time he commits such mistake, that he/she must be a sudoer to execute that particular command. \n\nA: Many of these commands are old, and for historical reasons, have been available to only systems administrators. While it is a good idea to use sudo over logging as root, many old applications that are not specifically made for just Ubuntu/Debian are not made aware of there being a sudo functionality. While it would be trivial to make such a change, it would require quite a bit of work for many programs, some very obscure or forgotten.

Actually if we suspend any application installing in middle or suspending updates then automatically while resuming we will get some problems like \nE: Could not get lock /var/cache/apt/archives/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)\nE: Unable to lock directory /var/cache/apt/archives/\n\nE: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?\n\nI know how to solve these things by removing lock . but i want to know why there is going to be a lock while performing updates/installation . \n\nA: Quite simply, locks are used for their original intention: To keep other processes from mucking around with installations. Imagine the following scenario:\n\n\n*\n\n*Process1 is started to install basex, which depends on default-jre\n\n*Process2 begins to remove default-jre. basex is already in progress so it cannot be informed of this removal.\n\n*Process2 finishes.\n\n*Process1 finishes. A nonworking system exists. This is worse if the same package is installed, then removed simultaneously.\nWhile this may be resolved by holding a per-package lock held for the package and any packages that must exist(Dependencies), I don't know why this is not done.\nA similar issue can occur if there are packages that conflict. For example, one package might be installed, and another conflicting one could be installed simultaneously(as a dependency or otherwise).\n", "Q: Redirect Sound output to a specific port...Realtek?

I've PPTP on Ubuntu, and want to change the default listening port, but apparently there's no option to do this.  Is there another VPN service that i can install and configure and change to any port i want?\n\nA: OpenVPN will let you change ports on server side and if you want on client side too (not very used).\nIn this example config file you can see the port 1194 line and you can define the port you want instead.\nProbably other VPN servers too but I don't know any of them sufficient to answer that.\n\nA: As long as what matters is that the control connections are received on a different port, and not that you need to have something else listening on port 1723, you can redirect incoming connections from another port.\niptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 31723 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 1723\n\nHowever, if you need to change the port, PPTP may not be the best tunnel for you. PPTP can be tricky to get through firewalls, if that's your problem. PPTP itself does not deal with authentication or encryption, so if you want any form of security (controlling who uses the VPN, protecting against eavesdroppers and hijackers), you'll need to set it up either through a PPTP extension or at some other layer of the network stack.\nA popular choice for VPNs over the Internet is OpenVPN . It is fairly easy to set up, even under Windows, and you can configure it to listen over UDP for performance or over TCP for firewall friendliness. You can even share port 443 between OpenVPN and a web server.\n", "Q: hwclock, not in sync with system clock My hardware clock keeps going out of sync. I set it to system time a few times, but it keeps going back to a 5hrs ahead state.\nIs this normal? Could it make trouble? How come my system clock is functioning properly when my hardware clock isn't?\n\nA: The system clock gets set to either UTC or Local based on the last option used when the hwclock function was run.  If you run:\nhwclock -w --localtime\n\nThis should write your system clock to local time instead of UTC and should subsequently set it and read it at boot using local time.  If you manually set your system clock and the hwclock was last specified with UTC then it will automatically set it back to UTC.\n\nA: I do not know if it is normal, or not, because I do not know why the hardware clock should go crazy.  If it's a hardware issue, you could use a software workaround until you fix it.\nThehwclock command should do what you need. You can use it in the terminal, as root, in order to set the system clock from the hardware clock, or to set the hardware clock from the system clock (depending on which one is more reliable):\nhwclock --hctosys   or\nhwclock --systohc \nFrom the hwclock man page: \n   -s, --hctosys\n              Set the System Time from the Hardware Clock.\n\n              [...] This  is  a  good  option  to  use  in one of the system startup\n              scripts.\n\n       -w, --systohc\n              Set the Hardware Clock to the current System Time.\n\n\nA: If it is always exactly 5 hours ahead it sounds like a timezone issue. In which case, it's likely that your hardware clock is set to local time, while the Linux system time is always set to UTC. If your timezone is 5 hours off of UTC, that would be the 5 hours.\nIn which case, in addition to the \"--systohc\" options for \"hwclock\" you should look into the \"--localtime\" and \"--utc\" options.\n", "Q: Plex Media Manager won't find /media/Movies or /media/TV internal HDD When I do a search for media in each of these drives (which are loaded with movies and TV shows), Plex doesn't find anything.

I am using Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit. \n\nA: I had that at first, it was erratic.\nThen I found that you have to follow their naming conventions (ish)\nPlex Media Naming Guide\nMostly it's this:\nMovies\\\n    MovieName (YEAR).extention\n    MovieName (YEAR).extention\n\nTV Shows\\\n    ShowName\\\n       Season 1\\\n          ShowName S01EXX.extention\n\nUsually then it's easier to just delete the section out of Plex and re-add it.\nIf you want to force it to re-do just one show, go to the show in plexweb and click the Unmatch link then re-scan, that seems to (eventually) sort itself out.\n\nA: Try adding Plex to the plugdev group.\nOpen a terminal (Press ControlAltT) and enter \nsudo gpasswd -a plex plugdev\nVerify that plex was added to the plugdev group by entering:\ngroups plex\nwhich should display what groups plex belongs too. Next, reboot the computer and start plex to verify this corrected the problem.\n\nA: I had this problem as well. I am using Ubuntu 13.10 and Plex MediaServer 0.9.1107.\nIt was a problem with the permissions on the files and folders I copied across to the system. So if you right click on the folder (e.g. Movies) left click on properties. Select the permissions tab. And make sure the 3 drop down menus are set to read/write or read.\nThen update the media server again. It should find the files (As long as they are named correctly).\n\nA: I had the same problem but I followed anonynous's instructions here.\nAfter this and making sure that all files that I wanted Plex to see were owned by my UserID and adding Plex to my Users Group I was good to go.\n\nA: You also need to make sure that ALL of the files, songs and movies have their permissions set as shared to read and write\n\nA: Here is a solution i tried: re-install linux (I use linux Mint) and when it gets to the naming part just name it \"Plex\" --- permissions problem solved (well for me it worked) and I am a noob to linux but really like the advances since my first exposure to linux.

The Spotify indicator icon clashes with the native Unity theme, and is redundant, since it is already listed in the Sound indicator menu. Is there a way to remove or disable the Spotify indicator? Or at least to change the icon (couldn't grep it on my filesystem). I am using the Spotify \"preview\" with 12.04. Thanks!\n\nA: For Spotify version 0.8.8 and earlier\nThe best way to do this is to remove the icon used by spotify to display the indicator. This can be done by executing the following command in the terminal,\nsudo mv /usr/share/spotify/theme/other/_linux/icon.ico /home/user_name/icon.ico\n\nReplace user_name with your user name. This should effectively disable the spotify indicator. Exit spotify and restart spotify to notice the change.\nFor versions higher than 0.8.8\nopen up a terminal and open the zip file as root:\ngksu file-roller /opt/spotify/spotify-client/Data/resources.zip\n\nThen, inside the zip file, navigate to the _linux subfolder and delete the .ico files inside it. That's it.\n\nA: It could be worth trying to use apparmor to prevent spotify from loading the icon. \n/etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.spotify\n\n/usr/bin/spotify {\n\n  # deny read access to the icon\n  deny /usr/share/spotify/theme/other/_linux/icon.ico r,\n}\n\nsudo /etc/init.d/apparmor reload \nWait for a few seconds and try running spotify again.\n\nA: For more recent versions of Spotify the solution proposed by Nik no longer works. This is because the config files have been put inside a zip file, which is located at /opt/spotify/spotify-client/Data/resources.zip.\nYou could do essentially the same as Nik proposed. First, open up a terminal and open the zip file as root:\ngksu file-roller /opt/spotify/spotify-client/Data/resources.zip\n\nThen, inside the zip file, navigate to the _linux subfolder and delete the .ico files inside it.

Problem is; there is no uninstall.exe to be found, I have fully converted the harddrive any idea how to revert back to windows 7?\nI have a broken dvd driver aswell =/ so anything cd wise wouldnt help\n\nA: Jason, if your question accurately describes the situation, then you simply installed the Ubuntu One Application for Windows into your windows 7 and you should still be booting into windows.  Whether or not you remove the application really should be fairly immaterial.  If you do not see it listed in the control panel app for uninstalling programs, you might need to remove it a different way or just ignore it.\nIf what you installed was actually Ubuntu (the OS), then how you answered questions during the install determined how it was loaded on the machine and whether it lives WITH your Windows or whether you wiped out the Windows system.\nIn other words, more details would be needed to give you a useful answer.\n\nA: If the hard drive has been formatted, then Windows 7 is gone. There is no way of getting your old Windows installation back. However, you can install a new one. Usually, that would be done with an installation CD.

I'm new to Ubuntu and Linux and I just downloaded mupen64plus 1.99.5 and it came as a *.tar.gz file. I found some guides about how to install a .tar.gz file with the terminal but it doesn't work. How can I install it?\n\nA: You can install it from the Ubuntu Software Center by clicking the button below:\n\nYou can then open a terminal via Ctrl-Alt-T and run it by typing mupen64plus and then the name of the ROM you want to run. See the manpage for the instructions.\n\nA: To complete Jorge's answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*with Ubuntu 10.10, installing from Ubuntu Software Center, we got Mupen64 v1.5\nthis version contains a nice Graphic User interface.\n\n*with Ubuntu 12.04, installing from Ubuntu Software Center, now we get Mupen64 v1.99\nthis version does not get Graphic User Interface. \nBut anyway, install v1.99, and then thanks to third parties, we can get Graphic User Interface like:\n\n\n*\n\n*cutemupen (in my case, I m not able to make it run on Ubuntu 12.04)\n\n*M64Py \n\n\nA: Still to complete Jorge's answer, install Mupen64Plus \nAnd create your own icons:\nWith Mupen64 v1.99.4, the only interface is the console interface.\nSo without third party to get a Graphic User Interace, you can simply create your own icons (one per game):\n\n\n*\n\n*Install alacarte sudo apt-get -y install alacarte \nand open it\n\n\n\n*in Menus, Game, add a new item\n\n\n*For the 3rd field \"command\", click on browse and select your game\n\n\n*Still on 3rd field \"command\", add mupen64plus before the path of your game\nOn 2nd field \"name\", add your icon title\nOn 4th field \"description\" or \"comment\", add your icon description\nOn top left corner you can even select your icon picture, select here a *.png file for example.\nAnd then validate\n\n\n*Now you will find your game like this\n\n\nA: The last version of Mupen64Plus is v2.5\nYou can download here:\nGITHUB MUPEN64PLUS\nInstalation:\n\ntar xvf mupen64plus-bundle-linux64-2.5-ubuntu.tar.gz\ncd mupen64plus-bundle-linux64-2.5-ubuntu\nsudo ./install.sh\n\nUse:\n\nmupen64plus 'Path/to/rom'\n\nexample: mupen64plus Mario-Kart-64-USA.n64\nEnjoy.\n\nA: I had trouble with all methods until I simply added a front end called M64py that can be found at Sourceforge. \n1st Install Mupen 64 plus one of the many ways listed. Then download and extract the proper 32 or 64 bit file M64py for all types of Ubuntu/Mint, in my case Xenial 16.04LTS and it contains a auto deb installer. It was a great GUI front for the Mupen software and worked fine with stock configurations for Logitech and Saitek Dual stick pads. Sound and everything worked well with every N64 game I threw at it. It also happened to be one of the few front ends that worked properly in Windows as long as you stay away from the Dynarec version.\n\nA: Easiest solution on Ubuntu 19.10\nsudo apt install mupen64plus-qt\n\nThen you have a 64 emulator!\n\n", "Q: How to link inserted images by default in LibreOffice writer? I often have to deal with documents using multiple images -- as e.g. Howtos, short documentations, or even books with many examples. Always when I start a new document with LibreOffice Writer and insert the first pictures, they are embedded by default. I need them to be linked by default -- but could not find a suitable setting. Can anybody tell me where that's hidden? I know it was possible with StarOffice 8, which I used before upgrading to Ubuntu 12.04.\nIn other words (to be clear from the beginning): How do I tell LibreOffice to always default to link inserted images instead of embedding them?\n\nA: @manj_k over at AskLibreOffice was kind enough to let me repost his answer here:\nCurrent state\nAs of this point there is no way of telling LO to link inserted images by default. But this enhancement has been requested, triaged and given a high priority on LO's bugtracker,  so it's on its way:\nBug 61358 - UI: Remember state of option \"Insert image from file -> Linked\"\nIf you are interested in this feature and would like to follow its development I would advise you to subscribe to the bug report. Feel free to contribute and comment if you have any ideas on how you would like to see this option implemented.\nWorkaround\nThe Insert from File dialog isn't the only way to link a picture in a document. You can do so as well by dragging and dropping the image in question while holding down CTRL + SHIFT. Personally, I prefer this workflow as it's faster than the Insert dialog. Note: This only appears to be working with LO writer.\n\nA: A bit strange, LibreOffice Writer Help said Link is default option:\n\nInserting Bitmaps  \n 1. Choose Insert - Picture - From File.\n\n 2. Select the file. In the File type box you can restrict\n    the selection to certain file types.  \n\n 3. Click the Link box if you want a link to the original file.  \n    If the Link box is marked, whenever the document is updated  \n    and loaded the bitmap image is reloaded.\n\nThe editing steps that you have carried out in the local copy of the image in the document are re-applied and the image is displayed.  \nIf the Link box is not marked, you are always working with the copy created when the graphic was first inserted. \nTo embed graphics that were first inserted as links, go to Edit - Links\n  and click the Break Link button. \n 4. Click Open to insert the image.  \n\n\n\nThe way around this workflow also related to using Gallery (just a bit faster way):  \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Gallery pane.  \n\n*Create new \"custom\" theme.  \n\n*Add any pictures to newly created theme.  \n\n*Use Right Click on picture in Gallery to use menu Insert > Link.\n\n", "Q: Where do you set keywords for applications in order to get them to show up in software center and dash searches?

Then I removed it with:\nsudo apt-get remove gdm\nsudo apt-get purge gdm\n\nNow I can't pass Ubuntu logo at starup. How to enable lightdm back? Have tried\n sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\nin curb but it not recognize command.\n\nA: First Way: Install LightDM\nUbuntu 12.04 uses LightDM as the default display manager. Assuming LightDM was working OK before you installed GDM, you should be able to fix this problem by making sure it's installed and properly configured.\nPress Ctrl+Alt+F1 to get to a text-based virtual console where you can log in non-graphically. (Or you may already be at such a console.) Then run these commands. (If the first one fails, the others may still succeed.)\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install lightdm\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\nYou may be given the opportunity to select your display manager. If you are, select LightDM.\nNow either reboot (sudo reboot / Ctrl+Alt+Del) or run this command to start LightDM without rebooting:\nsudo start lightdm\n\nYou should be able to log in.\nSecond Way: Install GDM\nIf that doesn't work, but GDM had worked when it had been installed, then just put back GDM and configure your system to use it. That is, do the steps described above, but for GDM. For your convenience, after going to the virtual console and logging in, these would be the commands:\nsudo apt-get remove lightdm\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gdm\nsudo start gdm\n\nYou'll notice that I've added a command at the beginning to remove lightdm (because it wasn't working anyway, and removing it guarantees it won't be run automatically instead of GDM). I've also not included a dpkg-reconfigure command for GDM. That's because you said you had removed gdm. So the apt-get install command will be doing a fresh installation of the package, which will automatically perform whatever configuration is necessary (including giving you a choice between display managers, if you have another one installed).\n\nA: I had the same problem and was able to fix it by making LightDM the default display manager:\necho /usr/sbin/lightdm > /etc/X11/default-display-manager\n\nThat command must be run as root (you can run sudo -s first). Or run this command instead:\necho /usr/sbin/lightdm | sudo tee /etc/X11/default-display-manager\n\n", "Q: Is reboot the same as init 6? Is reboot the same as init 6 for ubuntu?\nI'm running Ubuntu 12.04 on Amazon EC2. When ssh'ed into the box I can type runlevel and I get:\nN 2\n\nLooking at man reboot I see that:\n\nWhen called with --force or when in runlevel 0 or 6, this tool invokes the reboot(2) system call itself and directly reboots the system.  Otherwise this simply invokes the shutdown(8) tool with the appropriate arguments.\n\nIf I read man shutdown 8 I see:\n\nshutdown arranges for the system to be brought down in a safe way.  All logged-in users are notified that the system is going down and, within the last five minutes of TIME, new logins are prevented.\n\nMy basic understanding about the difference between reboot and init 6 is:\n\n\n*\n\n*On other distros and perhaps older distros reboot would just unmount the disks and basically flick the power switch without running any shutdown scripts\n\n*init 6 will run all of the shutdown scripts in /etc/init/rc.* as it reduces system's runlevel \n\n*On newer versions of Ubuntu the reboot command without --force or -f will run the shutdown command which does would basically do the same thing as init 6\n\n*It's probably better to get in the habit of using init 6 instead of reboot as it is safer and would work better cross-distro, but the default behavior of reboot has been changed to try and prevent errors / dataloss if someone does use it.\n\n\nIs that about right? If not, what am I missing?\n\nA: There is really never any compelling reason to use init 6 instead of reboot, unless:\n\n\n*\n\n*For some reason you are missing the reboot executable, or\n\n*You are deliberately trying to avoid notifying users that the system is going down.\n\n\nreboot (so long as you don't run reboot --force) is actually the \"softer\" way to shut down.\nConsider:\n\ninit 6 will run all of the shutdown scripts in /etc/init/rc.* as it reduces system's runlevel\n\nBut the reboot command, called without the --force flag, only directly reboots the system (via the reboot system call) when one of these two situations applies:\n\n\n*\n\n*The system is in runlevel 0 (single user mode), so there is no reduction of runlevel that can occur, so no shutdown scripts are automatically run.\n\n*The system is in runlevel 6. What init 6 does it to put the system in runlevel 6. Again, there's nothing running init 6 will do that running the reboot command won't do.\n\n\nOtherwise, sudo reboot is equivalent to sudo shutdown -r now. This does all the nice things sudo init 6 does, but also:\n\n\n*\n\n*notifies users that the system is going down.\n\n*prevents new logins (though they probably wouldn't succeed anyway).\n\n*is more intuitive and self-documenting than sudo init 6.\n\n\nIf you're on a system with only you logged in, and only local logins, there is nothing wrong with using init 6 to reboot. If that's how you prefer to reboot, then by all means, go ahead--you're not harming anything by doing so. But there's also nothing objectively preferable about doing it this way.\ninit's own documentation says it's not the normal way to shut down or reboot the system. Consider that when init is run by the user (like when you run sudo init 6), it actually runs telinit (see man init). telinit is what actually changes runlevels. And man telinit tells us:\n\nNormally  you  would  use  the  shutdown(8)  tool to halt or reboot\n  the system, or to bring it down to single-user mode.\n\n", "Q: How to change button icon when button clicked, python quickly I'm trying to implement hide function in my application.\nWhat I want is to have this little arrow \">\" when is hide and \"V\" when is visible.\nI know how to make it so its hides and shows but I need that little arrow to change whenever I click on it....\nI'm using quickly and python to create my app.\nI tried set_icon_from_stock function but it returns error:\nAttributeError: 'ToolButton' object has no attribute 'set_icon_from_stock'\n\nAbove example of arrow I talking about.\nThanks\n\n\nA: Just use an Expander, that's what Update Manager is using here, too.

I'm getting new VMs built for development and staging environments, and was wondering whether there are compelling reasons for or against using the linux-virtual package on all of these images.\nDo the -virtual kernels have different tuning? Do they have tools that make the suspend/wake-up better/safer?\n\nA: Since 12.04, there is no difference between the Desktop linux-generic and Server linux-server kernels; they have been merged. (Source; see here for why this was done.)\nThe virtual kernel differs only in the number of included drivers. It only includes \"the necessary drivers to run inside popular virtualization technologies such as KVM, Xen, and VMWare. ... Other than that, all other options are identical between the generic and the virtual kernels.\"\nIn practice, this means the -virtual kernel image is smaller, and may also take up somewhat less room in memory (fewer built-in modules/drivers). The savings are probably in the single-digit megabyte range, so it won't make a difference for most VMs.\n\nServer and Desktop kernel differences before 12.04:\nBefore 12.04, the differences were:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Server Edition uses the Deadline I/O scheduler instead of the CFQ scheduler used by the Desktop Edition.\n\n*Preemption is turned off in the Server Edition.\n\n*The timer interrupt is 100 Hz in the Server Edition and 250 Hz in the Desktop Edition.\n", "Q: Are there any applications that map and show the health of the hard disc?

Am I mistaken in their purposes, or are they redundant?  And if so, which should I use?  Finally, is ureadahead a standard GNU component, or is it Ubuntu-specific?\n\nA: e4rat is intended for older hard disks with mechanical parts. It works by moving everything to the beginning of the platter. Ureadahead works by packing up files together used during boot -- thus it works no matter what the physical disk type is like. They cannot both be used at the same time, and if your using an ssd you can only use ureadahead.\n", "Q: How to get Windows 7 back on the grub menu list?

I think the dots that replace characters are a relatively new idea that have been implemented in GUIs. On the command line, however, nothing was originally shown and it has stayed this way over the years.\n\nA: It is far more common that a user or administrator enables logging of text on a command-line, than logging of video in a GUI. Furthermore, it is very common that someone will copy text from the command line and make it available to untrusted persons. For these reasons, it would be especially bad for information about a user's password--specifically, its length--to be shown on the command line.\nFor example, on Ask Ubuntu we often ask people to enter commands--including commands beginning with sudo that ask for a password--and then to copy the entire contents of a terminal and add it to their questions. If the terminal showed a * for each character entered as part of a password, we would have to ask them to manually remove those lines. They might accidentally remove more, or not enough, or we might forget to ask, or they might not realize that some text they made available contained a password line.\nIn contrast, it's very rare for us to ask someone to make a video screen capture so we can help them with their problem, and especially rare that we would ask them to do so for any task that includes a graphical password prompt. If that were common (or if we wanted it to become common), we would have to stop showing placeholder characters for graphically entered passwords, too.\nAs a secondary factor, it's more important that placeholder characters be shown when entering a password graphically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Users of consoles generally expect that they are capable of receiving text input; it is the primary and usually only kind of input they take directly from a user. In contrast, many GUI's don't accept keyboard input, or don't accept it in as predictable a way.\n\n*It's common for a GUI program to refuse to echo keyboard input when the input cannot be acccepted--for example, when a user enters a letter in a text box that is intended to receive only numbers. It's easy for users to learn it's okay that nothing shows up when they enter their password in a console. It would likely be harder for people to feel comfortable seeing nothing while manipulating a graphical interface.\n\n*A graphical interface is more likely than a console to have multiple separate text elements. Echoing keyboard input is important because it clarifies which interface element within a program is receiving keyboard input. In this regard, showing stars in a password textbox may even be a security feature, in that it helps the user know they're not accidentally entering the password elsewhere.\n(That's also a potentially issue in a console if the console is embedded in a GUI, but less so, since the user is less likely to be mistaken about whether or not they are typing in a console window than in a new window that has just been shown to take authentication information.)\nIf you want asterisks to be shown as you enter your password for sudo, you can add pwfeedback to the ,-separated list of options on the Defaults line in the sudoers file.\n\nA: Back in the old days IBM keyboards had great tactile feedback and loud clackety clack clack sound. You always knew when you pressed a key.\nWith modern keyboards, especially membrane ones you have to sometimes look at the screen to confirm a keystroke was received.\nThis is even more true with touchscreen qwerty keyboards using thumbs and no vibration feedback.\nSo the password placeholders are a lot more important now than the late 70's when I think Unix gained traction. Even in 1991 when Linux was born I was paying $300 for the IBM 104 Key keyboard with awesome feedback. But shortly after that the cheapo disposable keyboards flooded the market.\n\nA: The simple answer is that back when we had to go to a \"node\" to access a \"terminal\" in a roomfull of them, you had to consider that someone next to you might be watching.  Kinda like copying your homework.\nBack then, the University would \"charge\" for your time on the system (there was no real money involved unless you were a grad student with a grant, but it limited the time students had to use before having to go mother-may-I to get more).  \nThus came about the idea of hacking other peoples' passwords simply to get more computer time.  \nThis is similar to what Bill Gates and Paul Allen were doing when they wrote the first BASIC for the Altair.  They snuck in at night and used system consoles (no password needed) so they could get computer time to do the development of an emulator then write their interpreter then punch it on paper tape.  They were using ASR-33 teletypes that ran at 110 baud.  \nBack to the node situation and the CRT character-based terminals didn't echo anything, or maybe they echoed *, the rationale is that it is much harder to watch your fingers on the keyboard than to read it on the screen.  \nThe original reason that most login passwords show up as asterisks or dots as you type was so you know your keyboard is working.  When you walked up to a terminal you never knew until you saw it respond.  Often the room would be full of users and the one terminal that nobody was sitting at was down for some reason or other.  Maybe it would work long enough to take your login name and prompt you for a password then \"CP DISCONNECT\" on its own (Honeywell 66/40).\nI remember using LA-120 DECwriter printing terminals on a Honeywell mainframe at UACN where after you typed your password (which would print on the paper) the carriage would go back and overwrite it a few times with asterisks and hash marks so the dumpster divers couldn't get it.\nThe idea of having no echo at all came about so nobody can get the length of your password, which might help them guess it.  They'd start with your girlfriend's name, or your pet, etc.  Having the length would help if that was their approach.\nsudo is used a lot more often than personal logins, and by then you know your keyboard it working, so it made sense to the developers to have no echo at all.  If you get it wrong it just tells you and you try again.  \nPlus, sudo requires the root password, which is much more precious to a hacker than your personal login password length.\n\nI know you wrote this question 5 years ago (it is Aug 2017 as I type), but I am describing the late 70s and early 80s.  Do the math.  Many moons ago.  \nLots of things like this have a rich history that people never think to write about or even ask about.  Most of the time people don't really think about why they are doing what they're doing.  They just do things they have been taught, by rote.  \nThanks for asking the question the way you did.  It is rare to get to do this kind of an answer.  \nWhen I began cranking out children I discovered their favorite word was \"Why?\" - but people don't really use that word very much these days.  So it is fun to get a chance to take a breather and remember the good old days.  \nIt is fun to remember all the things we could get those old machines to do.  Myself, I used that same behemoth to do dynamic simulations of the solar wind being affected by the earth's magnetic field and predicting where the magnetopause was where it was more affected by the interplanetary magnetic field about 80 earth radii on the back side, for instance.  The results came out as large plots on paper done by a CalComp Plotter.  The program took about 3 hours to run for each plot.  \nAlso simulated forest fires and how the trees would need x number of hours to dry out and burn.  Some trees were 1-hour fuels, some 10-hour, and 100-hour, etc, depending on their diameter.  \nEverything was in FORTRAN.  \nI can't help but wonder how fast it would run on these computers we have now.  \nEnjoy.\n", "Q: How to make xcalib always start up automatically? I added the command xcalib -gc 1.2 monitor-profile.icc to my startup applications.\nIt does set up the monitor colors in regard to a calibration file (icc). It works, however after about 1 or 2 seconds it gets overwritten by standard settings again. I think Ubuntu runs some monitor calibration by itself. Can you help me out?\nI am on 11.10.\n\nA: Well, a simple solution would be to first let the system write the settings and then overwrite them yourself ;)\nSo, you should add to your command a timeout at first, so as to let the system do what it has to do, and then you should overwrite these settings. This should be your command:\nbash -c 'sleep 10 && xcalib -gc 1.2 monitor-profile.icc'\n\nThis will wait 10 seconds at first (you may need to tweak this timeout so as to much your needs) and then it will execute your command.\nAs a result, you will overwrite what the system has written and not vice versa.\n", "Q: cryptsetup partitions not detected at boot I installed a fresh 12.04 and tried to mimic what I had for 10.04.\nswap should be encrypted with a urandom key and there's another partition that will contain home and other directories.\n# cat /etc/crypttab | grep -v '^#' | grep -v '^$'\ncryptswap /dev/sda5 /dev/urandom swap\nencriptado /dev/sda6\n\n# grep -e 'cryptswap' -e 'encriptado' /etc/fstab\n/dev/mapper/cryptswap swap swap defaults 0 0\n/dev/mapper/encriptado /encriptado ext4 defaults 0 0\n\nI also apt-get install cryptsetup\nWhen I boot, the system says (try to translate) that either the partition is not found or is not ready.

This line:\nencriptado /dev/sda6\n\nShould instead look like this:\nencriptado /dev/sda6 none luks\n\nThe crypttab(5) man page states:\n\nNote that all four fields are mandatory and that a missing field will lead to unspecified\n         behaviour.\n\n\nA: 11.10 had exact same problem. There is nothing wrong with your setup, and in fact the system should continue to boot and then you can check and see that the swap partition is properly activated. I just live with it although it can be quite annoying. My guess is that we need to file a bug about it.\n\nA: I happened to stumble upon this problem for 3 different releases of Ubuntu on two different computers. While most of the time the swap-partition was mounted despite the warning message, sometimes the GUI refused to start upon boot completion because of it.\nHere's what I did as a workaround:\nOpen a terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T.\nType gksudo gedit /etc/fstab and press Enter.\nSearch for the line that looks something like this:\n/dev/mapper/cryptswap swap swap defaults 0 0\nNow enter the value noauto right after defaults (separated by a comma), so it looks like this:\n/dev/mapper/cryptswap swap swap defaults,noauto 0 0\nSave and exit. This way, your swap partition won't be mounted while booting, thus the warning message won't appear or even hinder the login screen to appear.\nNow type in a terminal\ngksudo gedit /etc/rc.local\nand enter the following lines before the entry exit 0:\nsleep 10\nswapon /dev/mapper/cryptswap\nIf there's no entry exit 0, you'll have to enter it right beneath those two lines. \nSave and exit again. This will tell your system to wait 10 seconds after login to mount your encrypted swap partition.\nReboot your system. You should not get the warning message any longer. After login, wait some time, then open up a terminal again and type \nfree -m\nYour output should look something like this:\n\nfuzzyq@Samsung-R710:~$ free -m\n              total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\n\n Mem:          3949       3806        143          0         86       1783\n\n -/+ buffers/cache:       1936       2013\n\n Swap:         4095          0       4095\n\nThe last line is the important one. If there's a positive value showing for total swap, your swap partition was being mounted successfully.\n\nPlease note: In your special case, you'd have to repeat the steps for your /dev/mapper/encriptado /encriptado ext4 defaults 0 0 partition to make this workaround do its magic.\n", "Q: 12.04 and Windows problem I had Windows XP on my PC and wanted to install Ubuntu as well because I got more comfortable with it in the past few months.\nI downloaded iso, burned it and installed it alongside Windows XP.

Furthermore, one of my partition lost 21.4GB and I can't find them through Windows XP.\nHow do I boot Ubuntu? And what happened with my partition space?\nI hope I made my problems clear and hope for quick answers.\n\nA: When your computer boots, does it show a boot loader? Or does it just boot into Windows?\nIf it shows a boot loader, does it show the Windows boot loader or does it show GRUB?\nIf it shows GRUB, something isn't correctly configured and you should go here.\nIf it shows the Windows boot loader or no boot loader, I suggest booting from a live CD and install GRUB2 as is documented here. From the Live CD you will be able to browse to your new partition.\n", "Q: How do I check if someone accessed my computer? I need to check the list of files accessed in my computer (ex: yesterday on particular time). Is it possible? \nOr \nI need to check whether anybody accessed my computer (when I left it unlocked) or not for a particular time.\n\nA: I assume that you don't think that your computer has been totally compromised (to check who has been running sudo commands see /var/log/auth.log).\nIt is possible to quickly find files not owned by your user in your home folder and also at what time any files were accessed by using the find command (use -type f for files and -type d for directories). For the following examples, I assume that you are running from the top level of your home folder (just enter cd to get to it), and that you do not want to search the files in the root directory.\n1) To find all files NOT owned by your logged on user in your home folder, type:\nfind ~ -type f ! -user $USER\n\n1.1) To find all files that do not belong to any legitimate user (they should not exist), type:\nfind ~ -type f -nouser\n\n2) As files on the system have three timestamps called mtime (file modification time), ctime (inode change time and permissions), and atime (file access time), these can be queried to find out how files have been modified. It is often debated which of these are the best to use, but probably the best way to find out when files were accessed or modified is to use the find command to search atime and mtime, with which you specify days ago, and the additional find options amin and mmin, with which you specify minutes ago. \nFor each of these commands, the same command switches are used: for example,-atime 1 will match those files that were accessed exactly 1 day ago; to specify more or less than, append a + or a - respectively. The examples below may clarify all this (specify -type d for directories):\nfind ~ -type f -atime 1 \nfind ~ -type f -amin -23\nfind ~ -type f -mtime 2    \nfind ~ -type f -mmin -45\n\n3) To combine my approaches so far, you could enter the following commands from your home folder:\n\n\n*\n\n*Search for files in your home directory not owned by $USER and that was last accessed less than two days ago.\n\n\nfind ~ -type f -atime -2 ! -user $USER\n\n\n*\n\n*Search for files in your home directory not owned by $USER and that was last modified less than two days ago. \n\n\nfind ~ -type f -mtime -2 ! -user $USER\n\nA: If your computer were to have been locked, then you could check the auth log which notes each login and unlocking event with a date and time.\nThere is no direct way to know if someone was accessing an unlocked computer, without having a special program installed to track activity. But indirect information can be used to infer access.\nBrowser history for instance will often tell you what time websites were accessed. Also gnome's recently accessed files will show opened files. You can get to this by going to Unity's Dash Menu and click expand on the recently used files section:\n\nIf you need a more definitive list (including files accessed by non-gnome programs) then we would need to write a short script to detect all files with access or write times between the suspected range.

Hi I read some where that the current build of the Linux kernel is 3.5 but I am running 3.2 are there any benefits from updating and what are the risks.\nCould someone also post the code to update please.\nThanks....\n\nA: You should keep your computer updated, that would take care of everything. I would not recommend manually updating the kernel yourself (i.e., without Update Manager or some other package management utility).\n\nA: I won't say nothing about 'should you' but yes, you can.\nHere's what I found while reading online.\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/142236/54298\nIt's for kernel version 3.4, but the answer can be extended to other versions.\n", "Q: Desktop 12.04 gnome/cairo suddenly in Chinese After switching on my laptop Acer Aspire 5720Z, it is set to auto login to my native Dutch language.

Managed to find and identify settings languages and move Dutch back to top and apply system-wide. \nBut wondering how Chinese got in there in the first place? I certainly didn't chose Chinese (even by mistake).\n\nA: Add English language to your Ubuntu, it became Chinese because you may have erased English translation, your Dutch version are maybe not completely translated, so it displays English but if you don't have English anymore, Chinese pops up.\n", "Q: Cannot see boot message to choose which OS (Windows or Ubuntu) I installed Ubuntu using USB drive.

To do that, with the USB plugged in, boot into Ubuntu just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command below:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdaX (where X is your primary disk )\n\nif you get any errors, try\nsudo grub-install --force /dev/sda2\n\nTo find out which one is your primary disk,(in the image below, it would be sda1) just type\nsudo fdisk -l\n\n\nWhen done,  do sudo update-grub, remove the USB, and restart your system.\nTry to re-install grub2 to the mbr from the live cd.

I have manually built numpy, scipy, matplotlib etc - without root privilages. Now when I'm trying to install anything related - synaptic suggest me to install all the libs system wide. Is there a way I can tell synaptic to use the locally installed libs?\nEdit:\nAll libs installed in the standard place:\n~/.local/lib/python2.7\n\n\nA: No you can't.\nThe Debian/Ubuntu package management (APT) has no control over your user-specific installed libraries. This is intentional. Intentional why? This would break security in a certain aspect - local users would have the ability to 'own' the system libraries.\nIn case you need specific versions of Python libraries I would recommend using pip to manage them in your local (home) directories. Also consider building your own .deb packages in case you want to distribute them in case other stuff doesn't break on this being installed system-wide.\n\nA: try copying the libs to the global directory.

Whats the matter with a Power PC and what are the good things if we compare with General PC . \n\nA: PowerPCs dont have any special powers! :D\nPowerPC is just the name for a different processor architecture (compared to x86).  PPCs were used most extensively by Apple for their Macs until 2006, when they switched to the usual Intel x86 (\"General PC\") architecture. \nAt this point, the PowerPC userbase consists mostly of people with the older Macs, and compared to any modern PC, a PowerPC is most certainly at a disadvantage when it comes to speed, graphics, etc. \n\nNote: This is not to imply that there is anything wrong with the PowerPC architecture; small embedded PPC processors are still used very successfully in peripherals like GPUs (eg PowerVR in the Intel CedarTrail platform), on RAID cards (eg 3ware 8xxx/9xxx), etc. Of course, that has nothing to do with Ubuntu :)\n\n\nA: The PowerPc is a type of CPU architecture developed by Apple, IBM and Motorola.\nIt has been used in Apples Mac computers from  1994 to 2006 now they have switched to Intel CPUs.\nSo if you don't have an old Mac these images aren't for you ;)\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC\n", "Q: Unmet dependencies for libnspr4 This comes up a lot, but I can't seem to fix it with the solutions listed elsewhere.\nI have an unmet dependency from libnspr4.\nI have done;\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nI have changed the server in software sources.\nI am not sure I want to remove the package as when I do a dry run it seems to have many many things dependent on it.\nI now have 36 packages showing as not upgraded when I do sudo apt-get install -f \nI am becoming reluctant to keep poking around in case I break something.\nHelp greatly appreciated.\n\nA: This is a problem related to a recent stable release update in Ubuntu 12.04.

So, there is a high possibility that it's going to be unstable. But, as izx points out in the comment that the unstable repo of debian is very much stable and that packages for all the non-LTS versions of Ubuntu are taken from it and that you can trust this repo\nBut generally speaking, if repositories (other than the Debian one mentioned above) have the word unstable in them, they are unstable. Now the reason why people have this, is so that other users can have bleeding edge software. Now these might have bugs and stuff too. Users contributing to the project can file bug reports, fixes for the bugs and so on and so forth. Hence, this is not advised for the average user.\nSo the choice is ultimately yours, whether you want use the super-bleeding edge of the software or once when the community is confident enough to push the software to stable when it feels the software/project is relatively free of bugs.\n", "Q: Why does the videos played in ubuntu 12.04 show more colour?

See man date for a description of the different date formats it can produce.\n\nA: Instead of just names of days, why not do a full date format? That way the same filename ain't generated every week :)\nSomething like this - \nnits@excalibur:~$ tar -cvf /home/nits/Desktop/File$(date +%d%B%Y).tar Music/\n\nwould produce output like this - \nnits@excalibur:~$ ls ~/Desktop/\nFile14August2012.tar\n\nFor something along with a timestamp (as asked in the comments):\nnits@excalibur:~$ tar -cvf \"/home/nits/Desktop/File$(date +%d%B%Y_%H:%M).tar\" Music/\nnits@excalibur:~$ ls ~/Desktop/\nFile14August2012_20:14.tar\n\n", "Q: X Error of failed request: BadRequest (invalid request code or no such operation) \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to fix error with ATI driver “Error of failed request”? \n\nThough this question is asked before for 11.10, it's still unanswered.

I have a very simple Python script that I'd like to be always running on my Ubuntu 12.04 server. I thought of using upstart + monit.

Especially on why you expect it to exit or crash unexpectedly.\n\nA: The simplest way to do this is place this in /etc/init/something.conf:\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nrespawn\nexec python /path/to/your/script.py\n\nRespawn will start it back up if it is killed or exits non-zero (like an uncaught exception). This will work going back to Ubuntu 10.04.\nIf you have 12.04 you can get more fancy. The above will run your script as root. In 12.04 you can add setuid/setgid:\nstart on runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nrespawn\nsetuid nobody\nsetgid nogroup\nexec python /path/to/your/python.py\n\nIf your script exits when there is no network available and you plan to run it on an unstable network connection, well, you should fix that and just make it stay alive/retry. But if you can't, you may also need to have it manually started whenever a network device comes up. So you can place this in /etc/network/if-up.d/yourscript (make it executable with chmod +x)\n#!/bin/sh\nexec start wait-for-state WAITER=$IFACE-yourscript WAIT_FOR=something\n\nWhere yourscript is just something arbitrary and unique to this particular script, and \"something\" is the same as the job name (such as the /etc/init/something.conf suggested earlier).\n", "Q: Where is the GUI for VideoLAN?

However after recently taking time off, I return to my desk finding my machine was broken in to (I am also told it took most of an afternoon to do).\nInitial Enhancements\nThe very first thing I did was removed root access, simply passwd -u root. The second thing I did was create a new user with 'sudo' access adduser fkchu. I finally modified the sudoers file visudo only granting fkchu access to sudo (root didn't even have this access).\nThus, to access root privileges one would; a) login my normal user providing a fairly strong password, then would require to su fkchu using a second, very different strong password. Only then, this user can use sudo or sudo su.\nBig problem (I hope to be advised)\nDespite arriving to work with my background changed and all of my fonts Uninstalled (except from part Chinese and part French) I found my password also got changed. The only way I gained access was via:\n\n\n*\n\n*Booting from my installation USB drive.\n\n*Executing sudo su.\n\n*I conducted the following steps:\n$ cd /mnt\n$ fdisk -l\n$ mkdir i && mount /dev/sdb1 i\n\nThus I then accessed my hdd via cd /mnt/i/ and put everything back such as removing the background pictures and such.

At the prompt asking “Guided” or “Manual” partitioning, choose “Manual”.\nAt the partitioner:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the partition table for the devices that will be used. This will delete everything on the selected device, so make sure that you have everything backed up.\n\n*Create partitions for /boot (no more than 256MB is needed), /, /home and swap. Boot and home partitions should be ext4. Root and swap partitions should be “Physical for Encryption”.\n\n*Select “Configure encrypted volumes”, then “Create encrypted volumes”. Select the volumes that are listed as “crypto” by pressing spacebar, then continue. Enter a passphrase for each encrypted volume.\n\n*Each encrypted volume will now have space available inside of it. To configure these volumes, select the space listed under each encrypted volume. Setup a encrypted volume as swap space and the other should be set to Ext4 and set the mount point to: “/”. Select “Finish partitioning and write changes to disk”.\n\n*Later, when asked to “Encrypt your home directory”, select “Yes”.\n\n\nFor further information refer to: http://dailyanarchist.com/2012/02/20/full-disk-encryption-for-ubuntu-and-fedora/\nSet HDD password\nUsually, laptops and corporate desktops are able to set HDD passwords on BIOS. If you don't enter the password at POST the disk isn't exposed to the OS. From Wikipedia:\n\nThe disk lock is a built-in security feature in the disk. It is part\n  of the ATA specification, and thus not specific to any brand or\n  device. The disk lock can be enabled and disabled by sending special\n  ATA commands to the drive. If a disk is locked, it will refuse all\n  access until it is unlocked.\nA disk always has two passwords: A User password and a Master\n  password.\nA disk can be locked in two modes: High security mode or Maximum\n  security mode. In High security mode, the disk can be unlocked with\n  either the User or Master password. There is an attempt limit,\n  normally set to 5, after which the disk must be power cycled or\n  hard-reset before unlocking can be attempted again.\nIn Maximum security mode, the disk can be unlocked only with the User\n  password. If the User password is not available, the only remaining\n  way to get at least the bare hardware back to a usable state is to\n  issue the SECURITY ERASE PREPARE command, immediately followed by\n  SECURITY ERASE UNIT.

I am running Ubuntu 12.04 from my usb drive in persistence mode. I haven't installed it.\nWhere do the apps downloaded or files created in libre office get stored? On the pen drive itself?\nThank in advance.\n\nA: They are indeed installed on the pendrive. The casper-rw file resides on the pen drive's file system. From what I have seen it is usually an MS FAT file system of some kind. The casper-rw file, itself, is a block of disk space, formatted as a Linux EXT file system--so it's a file system within a file system. To see inside when you aren't running Ubuntu from the pen drive you have to set up a loopback device and then mount it. \ncasper-rw file -> loopback device -> mounted file system of changed and new files\n\ncasper-rw is mounted in a way that when you read a file, if it is on casper-rw you read it, if not you read it from the read-only files on the pen drive. If you write to the boot drive while it's booted, the file is written the the casper-rw file system. Therefore the casper-rw file system contains only new or changed files.\nUnless you set up the loopback device and mount it you can't see the files you have changed.\n\nA: Yes, they are stored on the pendrive itself. I'm not sure in which directories are the files stored, but you can always use the find command.\nSee the man page of find command, it is a very powerful command, and can be confusing at first. As a simple example, to search for a file named newfile.txt in `/home/user/abc' the following command can be used:\nfind /home/user/abc -iname \"newfile.txt\"\n\nNote that find can take quite a time to complete the search, therefore it is preferred that you narrow down the path, where you want to search for, as much as possible.\n", "Q: Force real network usage - disable loopback interface for applications I am trying to test some network properties with a (partially self written) tool chain.\nAs I would like to use one device with two WLAN adapters / interfaces, I have to prevent communication over the loopback interface and create real network traffic. The test inspects functionality, including ping, arp, multicast etc.\nHow do I force process 1 to use interface wlan1 only and process 2 the interface wlan2?\nI guess, this is a job for some magic iptables rules set?\n\nA: There seems to be a way developed by Daniel Ryde, which uses a self developed c-programm, which tells the dynamic linker to first load all libs into the process you want to run and then add some more ontop of it. \nThis explanation at Superuser.com and this  discussion on Daniel Lange's blog\nmay be helpful, but is there really no way to do it with the Ubuntu/Linux build-in tools?\n", "Q: Unable to use Hardware Acceleration for Radeon HD 6490M GPU I've followed steps in this guide.

Just let Update Manager install the update, and that's it.\nIf you had Chrome running already, you might want to close Chrome and start it again: the running instance will be the previous version (maybe with some of the updated assets), which can sometimes cause problems.

I am not sure what does this following means:-\n[    0.652039] ACPI: Added _OSI(Module Device)\n[    0.652044] ACPI: Added _OSI(Processor Device)\n[    0.652049] ACPI: Added _OSI(3.0 _SCP Extensions)\n[    0.652054] ACPI: Added _OSI(Processor Aggregator Device)\n[    0.656286] ACPI: EC: Look up EC in DSDT\n[    0.660361] ACPI: Executed 1 blocks of module-level executable AML code\n**[    0.720310] [Firmware Bug]: ACPI: BIOS _OSI(Linux) query ignored**\n[    0.721539] ACPI: SSDT 000000009ce70798 00727 (v01  PmRef  Cpu0Cst 00003001 INTL 20100121)\n[    0.722623] ACPI: Dynamic OEM Table Load:\n[    0.722630] ACPI: SSDT           (null) 00727 (v01  PmRef  Cpu0Cst 00003001 INTL 20100121)\n[    0.752832] ACPI: SSDT 000000009ce71a98 00303 (v01  PmRef    ApIst 00003000 INTL 20100121)\n\nWhat kind of bug is this? Does this bug affects my system performance. \n\nA: The ACPI tables (DSDT, SSDT) are provided by the BIOS. These ACPI tables allows the OS the control the hardware through an abstraction layer (ACPI). Manufacturers can use the ACPI _OSI method (Operating System Interfaces) to query the OS for certain capabilities.\nThrough this mechanism, ACPI can detect the OS (and version) and apply some quirks if necessary. This is especially useful for Windows machines as newer features of a machine may not be supported by older Windows versions. However, in Linux, the philosophy is that if a feature is not supported by the Linux kernel, exclusions should not be made by the BIOS manufacturer. Instead, the community (kernel developers) have to add code to support those features from newer machines.\nIn the past, some BIOS manufacturers removed features if they detect a Linux system. While a feature may not be supported at the time of the BIOS release, in the future, it could. Because of that, queries for \"Linux\" are ignored.\n\nA: For what I can understand it means that a query from the Bios/Firmware related to the ACPI (If you are running a laptop it means the battery, if you are running a Desktop PC it means a UPS or similar) is not recognized.\nWhat Ubuntu did there was ignore the query to not cause problems. Some of the stuff you might see because of this are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu battery state does not detect when the battery has been disconnected. Showing you still the same \"Battery Connected\" symbol.\n\n*Battery charging notification is not updated correctly.\nThis does not mean the battery will not charge correctly, or that it did not detect the state of the battery correctly, it just means that in the Desktop you will not see it correctly. This does not even mean it will not show correctly to you.\nFor performance related stuff, you will not suffer any performance problems. It will be running the same as always.\nBasically this comes from a BIOS, first assuming that the OS is Windows and then doing a query to it to confirm some information.\nAnyway don't worry about it, Ubuntu and any other Linux distro can effectively just tell the BIOS that it is in fact Windows and get the correct query from it. Dmesg and the booting system just post that message there to notify you about the BIOS asking something to the OS (Remember, it is assuming is Windows) and Linux trying to fake it so the BIOS sends the complete query. This is a reason why BIOS manufacturers should not assume that the only hardware they will work on is Windows.\n\nA: There's a table in the BIOS being queried and some BIOS programmers have used it to do things they shouldn't - to the point where it affected some distros badly.\nThe solution the kernel writers decided to use is to just return FALSE when queried, to stop that noise.\nSupposedly if you add acpi_osi=Linux to your kernel command it may fix it, but I didn't find it to work for me on my Asus H81T.\nSo basically, ignore it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10 Shutting Down Randomly and Unexpectadely I have a bit of a strange problem that just started happening recently. Out of nowhere Ubuntu 11.10 will just shut down. \nI don't think its hardware because I can't find any information in the logs. I don't think its temperature because I monitor my temps and my machine is liquid cooled. The pc continues to run while the OS shuts down so its not being interrupted by power where all of a sudden everything just loses power. I don't really overload the machine at all, I mostly just code on it, but I do have apache2, tomcat, james email server, and mysql running on the system and they are auto started. I don't actually have any traffic coming into the machine though, I use it specifically for development.\nEdit from comments:\n\nIt's not really going to a shut down screen, the screens go black and\n  the computer still runs, but the actual OS shuts down because if I'm\n  listening to music or something, the music will skip a few times and\n  then stop. This is how Ubuntu normally shuts down for me so I assume\n  its a software shutdown. It's not following a pattern unfortunately,\n  it's random and sometimes within a few hours of the last time, other\n  times its days between. Normally when I am on the machine.\n\nAny ideas on how I can diagnose a problem like this? Does this sound like a memory leak issue?\n\nA: Can you check the following and update your question with more information on it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu - Power Management Features (Shutdown on idle or Sleep on idle)   \n\n*Ubuntu - Cron jobs for root and other users   \n\n*Ubuntu - Recent Updates (Some updates require system reboot - I assume auto updates would restart the system when required)\n\n*BIOS - Power Management (enabled or disabled)\n\n*BIOS - Recent Updates\n\n*APPS - Any Bit torrents running? (Some Bit torrents shutdown after complete if set) - as seen in this forum\nTo check the cronjob type the following in the terminal:\nfor active session (the account you logged in with) cron jobs\ncrontab -l\n\nfor root's cron jobs\nsudo crontab -l\n\nfor any other user's cronjob\nsudo crontab -u <usename> -l\n\n\nA: In general in a situation like this where you have an error that is hard to pinpoint and only happens from time to time you can only use the process of elimination to find the error. The first and obvious thing to try reseting the software part of your computer, so you could try backing up all your stuff and do a completely fresh install of 12.04 and see if the problem persists.\nIf it does, it might be hardware related. You can run a memory test which is included on all Ubuntu boot media overnight, if that turns out clean it might be any piece of hardware in your computer. It might be the PSU, the motherboard, your graphic card and so on. The only way to know for sure is replacing one at a time.\n\nA: That does not sound like a memory leak - that would just lead to poor performance rather than a sudden shutdown.  \nDoes it happen at a specific time?  If you are seeing a shutdown screen rather than just losing power, then it seems likely that an auto-shutdown script is running somewhere. Check this question for more details on that:\nWhy does my computer shuts down itself every morning at 6 AM?\n\nA: Turns out the problem was the video card either being faulty, or more likely overheating. I replaced the card with a spare I had and its working fine. I didn't realize how loud the fan on the card was until I removed it, and it was completely saturated with dust. Gonna clean it out real good and try it again, but that was the culprit. How dare I blame Ubuntu! :)\n", "Q: How can I have audio in Google Dictionary's pop-up bubble?

I basically wanted to only have the root user, and those users that belong to certain groups access those folders (all other users can't access). When I made these changes, now I can't use ssh to get to the server remotely. Any ideas on how/what files and directories are affecting this?\n\nA: Playing with the file-system's permissions is a dangerous game if you don't know what you are doing.\nThat said, by chaning the permissions to 775 from their default 755, you've actually made them more accessable: from rwxr-xr-x to rwxrwxr-x .. or in human terms, you'd allowed the options for users in the group which owns the file to write to it, where as before, only the owner of the file could write to it.\nIt's more likely that changing the ownership of some files to root:root has done the damage, as some processes need to be started as designated users, reserved by the system.\nIn the future, I suggest you look at logging your users into a chroot jail, instead of recursively - and blindly - blanket modding your entire file-system.\nYou have a couple of options now:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get remove --purge the packages which are not working (openssh-server in this case), and then reinstall them.\n\n*install the services which aren't working on your server onto you ubuntu desktop and have a look around at the ownership of the files it installs using ls -l. Change them on the server to match (Ouch)\n\n*Reinstall the system. (Doh.)\n\n\nThere may be a very fancy way of sorting this out, but I don't know it.

You can install the proprietary driver very easily when Ubuntu is installed, a popup will appear saying that \"proprietary drivers are available\", but let's ignore that for a second.\nIf you are having issues with installing Ubuntu graphically I can recommend trying the minimal Ubuntu install ISO instead.

As it is right\n  now work is undergoing to remove all atl1c device support from the alx\n  driver, in the meantime the compat-wireless release has a temporary\n  patch from the original alx driver which removes the atl1c devices\n  from it.\nThe alx driver will only provide support for:\n1969:1091 - AR8161 \n1969:1090 - AR8162\nCode:\nThis code has now been posted for inclusion upstream.

I decided to buy the Psychonauts PC game from the Ubuntu Software Center. Now, my laptop is practically empty, with only my OS and a few bits and bobs installed. The download for Psychonauts took about 6 hours, and I waited patiently for it to download the 4.4 GB. Now, however, it comes up with something to the effect of \"The packages cannot be downloaded. Check for Internet connection problems.\"\nI don't know if it had downloaded the files to anywhere that I could access, or is there no way but to spend another 6 hours and hope for the best? I've never had this problem whilst downloading or installing anything else, and it will only redirect me towards redownloading the whole thing when I try! Any help would be much appreciated.\nNote:\nAfter trying to install the previous packages with Synaptic and failing to run Psychonauts, I found that sudo apt-get install psychonauts would work, but was getting E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/). Rebooting and running Terminal directly after start-up seemed to fix this and I am currently downloading Psychonauts through it at the same speed as that of USC. Possible work-around for my first time using commands?\n\nA: You only course of action is to re-download the game. If you continue having the problem you should contact Ubuntu Payment Service support.\nThe error you describe in your note means that you had another application open that was working on the package management (like update manager or USC). You can only use one at a time.\n", "Q: How to display a \"What's new\" dialog on every new version of my app I'd like to be able to present a dialog that runs at the start of my application and shows the new features this new version implements.\nThis dialog should only run once, and not be showed again until the user upgrades to a higher version of the app.\nI'm not looking for a snippet, but rather for a suggestion on how to do this.\nWhat's the best way to display such a dialog, so that it appears only once on the first run after the app has been upgraded?\n\nA: Pseudo-code:\nversion = 1\n\nif settings.read(\"lastVersion\", default=0) < version:\n    showDialog()\n    settings.save(\"lastVersion\")\n\nThen you just update the version variable for each new version, and done. In text: simply use a setting to save the last version, and if the program version is newer, show the dialog and update the setting.\n\nA: One idea jump to mind. Write the version number into whatever you use as your config store (dconf, dot file, etc...). On start up, check if that value matches the current program version. If not, display your dialog and bump the version number in the config. You could also ship your changelog in a parse-able format so you can only display changes from versions greater than what is in the config.\n", "Q: How to run a program installed on the Windows partition with Wine? I dual boot Windows and Ubuntu (but rarely ever use windows, just in case there is something I need Windows for) and I already have The Sims 3 installed on my Windows partition.

If you have any data you need from a Windows installation, browse your Windows filesystems in your normal file manager and copy the data to another location.\n\nWARNING: Do not try to configure Wine to point to your actual\nWindows C:\\ drive.\nThis will break Windows and require a Windows\nreinstall.\nWe have tried to make this hard to do, so you probably cannot do it by\naccident.\nIf you do manage this, Wine may or may not continue to operate, but\nyour Windows install will be 100% dead due to critical parts of it\nbeing overwritten.\nThe only way to fix Windows after this has happened\nis to reinstall it.\n\nSource\n\nA: If your intent is to run a program that is already installed outside of Wine's C partition:\nthen simply run winecfg\nin appeared window choose the drives tab\nand add the partition containing the program to the list in front of you\nthen it can be opened with Wine either by \"open with wine\" or by executing wine drive_letter/path_to_program where drive_letter is the same letter chosen for the partition in winecfg\n", "Q: Bash script to create multiple directories and Subdirectories I'm currently using the following two scripts to create multiple directories and subdirectories.

It will not recurse down into sub-directories.

First, install wine-staging:\nFrom https://wiki.winehq.org/Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your system is 64 bit, enable 32 bit architecture (if you haven't\nalready):\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\n\n\n*Add the repository:\nwget -nc https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/Release.key\nsudo apt-key add Release.key\nsudo apt-add-repository https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/\n\n\n*Update the package list:\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n*Then install:\nsudo apt-get install --install-recommends winehq-staging\n\nIf apt-get complains about missing dependencies, install them, then\nrepeat the last two steps (update and install).\n2. Enable GTK theming:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open winecfg\n\n*Click the \"Staging\" tab\n\n*Check \"Enable GTK Theming\"\n\n*Click OK\n\n\n3. Enable font smoothing:\nImprove GUI appearance of Wine applications\n\nA: Unfortunately, due to the nature of Windows, and thus Wine, it is currently rather difficult to achieve what you are looking for.\nAs far as I'm aware, there are plans to eventually have Wine applications take on the style of the desktop they are running on, but trust me, this will probably take a while before it ever happens.\nYour best bet is to use winetricks, which has an option use your Desktop's colour scheme to theme Wine applications. Other than that, unless someone has created a style, there isn't much you can do.\nThe numerous icon theme replacements out there for Windows can work, but not very well, due to differences between Wine's and Windows' shell*.dlls. I'm sorry I cannot provide you with the solution you wanted.\nI see that my answer has not been enough for you so I'm going to try to make it more satisfactory.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to make wine more aesthetic and less alien?\nYes, but it is difficult. You would need to create a .msstyles theme for Windows (XP compatible) and then apply this as a theme in Wine. Since Microsoft never intended for any custom themes to be created, creating msstyles is not a \"walk in the park\" and creating one that matches Ubuntu's style is even more difficult.\n\n\nDoubt what I'm saying?\nRead here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSSTYLES\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I add icons to wine programs such as MS office for instance?\nYes and no. You can patch these applications, but please remember, Windows applications are for the most part themed very differently from the applications you will find on Ubuntu (especially Microsoft products).\n\n*\n\n*You can apply \"transformation packs\" in Wine, but unfortunately the results will be somewhat different from what you would expect on Windows (trust me, I've tried).\nThis is largely because transformation packs are designed to theme a whole Desktop Environment (from the File Manager back to the Taskbar). Wine does not have some of the components of Windows, and so all you will be seeing is specific applications with minor, incomplete changes, such as changed icons, and not all of the icons will change either.\n\n*Most official Windows applications (especially Microsoft products) do not use freely changeable icons (like what you would find in Ubuntu) that you can swap for other themes. The icons are \"hard coded\" into dlls like shell.dll, and sometimes in application specific dlls. Occasionally, an application in Windows uses external resources (like .png files) that you can change, but this is rare, and so it won't make any difference in your Wine experience.\n\n*Even if you do manage to apply a transformation pack, you will likely create instability in your applications (trust me, I've tried!!!). For this reason, I advise you to just put up with what is available. Unless a miracle happens, there is no other answer anyone can give you.\n\n\n", "Q: Apache or PHP inserting a Newline at start of every HTML and XHR response I have a PHP app running on a cloud-based Ubuntu server and for some reason, I am getting a newline at the start of every HTML file or XHR response.\nI have a local version of the app running on Ubuntu, and this newline does not appear.\nSpecifically, the bad responses have one additional character with ASCII code 10 prepended to each response.\nThis is causing my Javascript to break because the XHR object won't recognize the XHR responses as XML because of the leading newline character.\nI am using the Agavi framework, version 0.9.2 (yes, old!) as the PHP web framework.  I have been able to insert echo statements into my custom Views and the newline still appears first in the response.\nSo is it Apache or Agavi or something else doing this?\nAny thoughts?\nThanks.\n\nA: I experienced a similar problem which may or may not be related. I found that the culprit was whitespace in the PHP code. To rectify this, however, you need to be able to review and change the source code. To avoid ths kind of problem in PHP, it is a good idea to skip using the closing ?> tag (after which whitespace inadvertently can be inserted).\n\nA: Take a look at all include files, search for CarriageReturn/LineFeeds after the closing ?>\nThere lies your problem!\n", "Q: How to uninstall other OS's using Ubuntu?

Because if it will presented by default no question about internal mounting appear. fstab not really good for additional drives nor flexible. I think it must contain only system important records. \n\nA: To answer the original question all you need to do is edit the fstab file by typing sudo -i gedit /etc/fstab in the terminal.  \nCurrently Linex prefers the use of the UUID in the fstab file because the sd*# device assignments can change under certain circumstances between system boots resulting in failed mount attempts.  \nTo fine the UUID for the drive you want to mount type sudo blkid in the terminal.  \nTo check if you were successful type sudo mount -a in the terminal to remount the disk.\n\nA: Automounting at boot is a question of modifying the fstab file.\nMy experience with Precise is that you may use the UUID but the drive gets two entries in Nautilus devices list. When I changed to /dev/sdb* it worked flawlessly.\n", "Q: UEFI boot on my Asus k52f I was reviewing my settings in BIOS and UEFI was disabled. I wanted to check what UEFI was so I googled it. I found out its like an upgrade to BIOS and improved boot speed. Currently I'm dual booting Ubuntu 12.04(32 bit) and Windows 7(64 bit). I'm currently confused as to how to make the switch since I don't want to make my System unbootable. How do I make the switch from BIOS to UEFI. \nSystem Chipset : Intel HM55\nProcessor : Intel Pentium P6100 2 GHz\n\nA: It'll be a lot of work.\nIn Linux, it could be done by carving out an EFI System Partition (ESP) on the disk, installing any of several EFI boot loaders on that partition, and reconfiguring the firmware to boot in EFI mode. For some firmware, you might need to convert from MBR to GPT and/or remove all traces of a BIOS boot loader, but some firmware implementations don't require this.\nIt gets harder in Windows, since Windows requires jumping through additional hoops to switch from BIOS-mode to EFI-mode booting. Some of those might be required by your firmware even when booting Linux, though, like the MBR-to-GPT conversion.\nIn sum, unless you're re-installing everything, this will involve a lot of work on a dual-boot system, with very little practical benefit. You'll also be risking total loss of all the data on your hard disk. Thus, I can't really advise this except as a learning exercise, and then only if your data aren't important.\n\nA: If you're prepared to wipe everything and start fresh it's not so bad. I recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clear the partition table (dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1).\n\n*Partition with GParted, parted, or gdisk. Be sure to create an ESP with a FAT32 filesystem. Make it 200-500 MiB in size.\n\n*Install both OSes. Order is less important than on BIOS systems, but back up the ESP after the first install. Pre-12.04 versions of Ubuntu would wipe the ESP, and hence the Windows boot loader, when installing. That was supposedly fixed in 12.04, but I ran into it on my latest installation, so I don't think it's been completely fixed.\n\n\nI wouldn't worry about the 2GB RAM, but it depends on how much stuff you run, really. Benefits will be minor -- mainly a possibility for an improved boot time and, once you learn it, easier boot manager maintenance. There'll be a learning curve, though. Check my Web page on EFI boot loaders for information on what's available and how they work.\n\nA: Apart from having no benefit there is also the risk of updating the UEFI (formerly known as BIOS update) and losing all boot information data for the EFI boot loaders.

I run Lubuntu 12.04 and after several terrible experiences with libre office I downloaded core and have not touched it since april. I find kile ok and have been learning to use that and writing with latex.\nI am hoping there's a mind mapping program that I could use that is not too \"bubbly\" but most importantly can handle maths (i.e. latex). I don't need it to be able to integrate with kile but anything extra is a bonus! Tips?\nEdit: The latex is needed for writing mathematical equations.\nEdit: I thought they were all useful suggestions but on balance, the selected answer was my personal favourite out of them. Though it was tough to decide. Dia particularly does look like a good shout with ekee.\n\nA: Have you seen: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/2847/mind-maps-in-latex and https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/44112/mindmapping-with-latex ?\nBoth suggest http://www.texample.net/tikz/\nhttp://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/feature/mindmaps/\n...although the provided mindmaps feature is quite \"bubbly\" \nAs far as handling Maths:\nhttps://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/42611/list-of-available-tikz-libraries-with-a-short-introduction ... Graphics in LATEX using TIKZ ... TIKZ and PGF examples ... and http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/tag/text-and-math/ will also prove helpful.\n\nA: This will not completely answer your question but my daughter creates mindmaps using Dia and I use LaTex (although not Kile), I use MikTex and LiveTex.\nThe common denominator is that both have XML and SVG compatibility.  You may have to do some additional research about integration capability as I have never come across your integration requirement before.  \nBefore I continue with my answer, if you don't know already, there is a dedicated TeX/LaTeX Q&A in Stack Exchange. It might not do any harm asking your question there also.  Lets start with mind mapping and Dia\nDia is available from the Ubuntu Software Centre and is inspired by Microsoft 'Visio,' though more geared towards casual and informal diagrams including Mind Maps. It can be used to draw many different kinds of diagrams with \"special objects\" to help draw entity relationship diagrams, UML diagrams, flowcharts, network diagrams, and many other types. My daughter swears by this application (if that’s worth anything)\n\nIt can load and save diagrams to a custom XML format (a format also supported in LaTex), as well as exporting diagrams to a number of formats, including EPS, SVG, XFIG, WMF and PNG, and can print diagrams (including ones that span multiple pages). You may want to refer a question asked here \"How to convert latex equations to SVG\" as I think this will be an integral step in your final solution.  \n \nYou can also create custom shapes for Dia Or download additional shapes from their repository here.\nI think your requirement(mindmapper +mathematics+LaTeX) begs more clarity regarding what your expectation is, you give an example of LaTeX (using ie) but it would be very useful if we could undertstand your objective better.\n\nA: Try freeplane. You can type latex into the nodes.\nhttp://freeplane.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page\n\nA: You can use http://EquationMap.com for this purpose.\nIt is currently a free beta version, no login required, \nany map you create is public and you can share it using generated URL.\nFull disclosure. I'm the author of EquationMap.com\n\nA: If I understand you correctly, you are looking for a way to type equations in LaTeX notation into a graphical mindmapping tool. If so, there is a LaTeX plugin for FreeMind on GitHub that claims to do just that. \nFreeMind itself claims to once have supported a subset of LaTeX.\n\nA: You may want to check out the freemindlatex tool at https://github.com/xuehuichao/freemind-latex . It allows you to write in freemind, and get beamer slides. Equations are formatted in a native latex way.\n\nA: Coggle is a web-based tool that allows you to create nodes with LaTeX (specifically math) in them by simply writing LaTeX code between \\\\( and \\\\). (For new line within the code, you can then use \\\\\\.) More about the feature in this article.\n", "Q: Why doesn't Doom 3 work in Ubuntu 12.04?

This fails because you already have a local session manager controlling your X server display.\nYour options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Simply start individual remote applications using ssh -X user@192.168.1.107 xclock\n\n*Assuming XDMCP is enabled on the remote machine...\n2a. Use Xnest -query 192.168.1.107 -geometry 1024x768 :1 to start a remote login session in a local window.\n2b. Use Xephyr :1 -screen 1024x768 -query 192.168.1.107 which is a better X server than Xnest\n\n*Also assuming XDMCP on the remote machine, configure your local machine to use the XDMCP chooser instead of the standard greeter on startup.\nEnabling XDMCP is simply a case of putting\n[xdmcp]\nEnable=true\n\nin /etc/gdm/custom.conf and restarting gdm or rebooting (assuming you are running gdm).\nIf you only intend to run a few applications remotely, then option 1 is simplest and continues to use SSH encrypted traffic, which none of the others do (so they are best only used on a trusted local network).\nIf you need to so something more complicated, then 2b (Xephyr) is may be better, but I've usually found just using ssh -X ... & for multiple remote applications to be adequate.\nIf you are doing everything remotely, i.e. the local machine is just a display server and doesn't do anything itself, then you need to look into using option 3, starting the XDMCP chooser instead of the standard login.\n\nPS: As noted in the comments, both Xnest and Xephyr are applications which handle the X server protocol and put the entire session into a window. Xnest uses the functions provided by the local X server while Xephyr handles much more of the server protocol itself so is more robust. They may not be installed by default because the average user wouldn't use them.\n\nPPS: After a little thought it's obvious how to encrypt a Xephyr or Xnest session...\nssh -X username@192.168.1.107 Xephyr :1 -query localhost -screen 1280x1024\n\n\nA: In case you ever want to learn to use the standard ssh from a terminal, I thought I'd give you a quick rundown, since you had trouble using ssh keys, it seems.  The advantage is that it's more universal, and very flexible.\nTo use ssh keys, which is more secure, sometimes required, and more convenient since you only need to enter the key once, you need to do this once for any remote ssh server:\ngenerate key (can use dsa instead of rsa, if required)\nssh-keygen -t rsa    \n\ntransfer the key to remote host\nssh-copy-id <username>@<host>\n\nif not standard port 22, use this:  Note quotes around argument\nssh-copy-id \"<username>@<host> -p <port_nr>\"\n\nIf using dsa, there is a slightly different command, adding -i <homedirectory>/.ssh/id_dsa\nSomewhere after this, you will need to enter a password, which is separate from your normal login password.  It's been a while, and I've forgotten the exact sequence, but it should be obvious.  Then, the first time you connect, you'll be asked for this password, once.  I use the same login name, so I don't need to enter the username (it assumes the same as the remote username).  Also, for servers on your lan, you can enter \".local\" instead of the IP address, I believe (works for me).\nYou can even mount a remote filesystem using sshfs (assuming sshfs is installed); substitute a directory path for local-mount-directory:\nsshfs remote-host: local-mount-directory\n(unmount using fusermount -u local-mount-directory)\nI think it will use your home directory by default, if you leave off the local-mount-directory.\n`\nCopying files can be done with scp.\n", "Q: Can't instal 12.04, stops at purple screen I tried to install 12.04 with a CD. I downloaded everything, burned the CD and changed the boot order from my PC.\nI then restart my PC with the CD in it but all I get is a purple screen with a keyboard and a menu at the bottom of the screen and it blocks there. I read that you are supposed to push a random keyboard button but when I do it, nothing happens except for one time where I got to another screen with a bunch of language but then it stops there.\nHope you guys can help me.\n\nA: The random key is the Enter key on the keyboard. Once you press Enter, Select your language and press Esc on the keyboard. Then choose one of the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try Ubuntu without installing\n\n*Install Ubuntu\n\n*Check disc for defects\n\n*Test memory\n\n*Boot from first hard disk\n\n\nIf you still can not get in, it could be that your Graphics card is too new for Ubuntu to recognize the drivers to work. I would suggest that you go and unplug your graphics card from your computer and use the on-board graphics card until after you have installed Ubuntu. Before the install, Press Enter, then Enter, and then hit F6. Select nomodeset and then press Enter and then choose what you want to do. Continue with your installation. When the installation is done, Install all of the latest updates, then turn off your computer and put back the graphics card. Then install the drivers(Ubuntu might recognize the card and prompt you to install the driver.

Firstly, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to ask this question. I'll delete it if it's not welcome. I'm after some guidance on how to start programming.\nPerhaps I need to start somewhere else, but I'm interested in learning to code, however I've not taken a single course in computer science in my life. I've read tutorials but I prefer to start writing programs and ask how to do things when I get stuck. I've written a program in python today and it works very well, and I've written a few things in python now, but only simple programs like the one I wrote today http://paste.ubuntu.com/1147685/ which I managed to do without help, (only following some things on the python website) but what I really want is to write a GUI program. I've heard \"quickly\" is a good program and I've installed that and I can now use glade to make simple windows with buttons and text boxes, but that's about as far as I've got. It seems to me that all the tutorials I've read on quickly and, is it GTK? or GTK+? or pyGTK? I'm not sure, but one of them anyway makes the kind of things I'm after. A program which runs on python and has clickable buttons and doesn't need an open terminal.

I'm using QT 4. \n\nA: The problem is most likely that while your download functions are running, your application can't respond to events - control doesn't return to the main loop.\nI think the simplest mechanism is to do the downloads in separate threads, and use Qt's signals and slots mechanism to update the progress bars (threads can't interact directly with the user interface).\nAlso, rather than opening files to write the HTTP response out, you might find it more efficient to use a function like urllib.urlretrieve to write the files directly.\n\nA: It sounds like the window is not being destroyed. Is this the main window of your application, or a dialog of some sort? \nIf it is a dialog, make sure that after you call your window object, the next line, or after the return value for the window is grabbed, you call \"window_object.destroy()\". \nIf it is your main window, you would  perhaps want to modify the callback method for the X button with something to destroy your window, perhaps self.destroy()?\n", "Q: Assign super key to shortcut I am using gnome classic (no effects) on Ubuntu 11.10.\nI installed gnome-do today, and I wanted to assign it to the Super key.

Sometimes your system might crash or a power failure might take the machine down. \nEither way, at the next boot, a lengthy filesystem check (the speed of this check is dependent on the type of filesystem that you actually use. ie. ext3 is faster than ext2 because it is a journalled filesystem) using fsck will be done. \nFsck will go through the system and try to recover any corrupt files that it finds. The result of this recovery operation will be placed in this directory. The files recovered are not likely to be complete or make much sense but there always is a chance that something worthwhile is recovered. \nEach partition has its own lost+found directory. If you find files in there, try to move them back to their original location. If you find something like a broken symbolic link to 'file', you have to reinstall the file/s from the corresponding RPM, since your file system got damaged so badly that the files were mutilated beyond recognition. Below is an example of a /lost+found directory. \nAs you can see, the vast majority of files contained here are in actual fact sockets.

It's probably AMDs display driver I'm most worried about. \nIs there anything I need to worry about here? \n\nA: From my experience, no, Ubuntu will run just fine as a VM with direct disk access. You will have to install Guest Addition for enhanced graphical performance, and assign enough video memory and enable 3D acceleration for all the eye candy of Unity.

Eg, 2>&1 means send STDERR to the same place that STDOUT is going to.\n\nSTDIN is FD 0, while STDOUT is FD 1, and STDERR is FD 2\n\nref: http://www.linuxsa.org.au/tips/io-redirection.html\nFile descriptor 5 is sometimes used because it is the lowest numbered file descriptor that was never really used for anything else (FD 4 was /dev/tty on some very old unixes and FD 3 has had various, non-standard, system specific, uses in another Unix). Although since neither 3 or 4 have been used in over 2 decades it is probably just coincidence (or tradition) that you have noticed FD 5 popping up.\nref: http://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/File-Descriptors.html\nAs to the reason it is used. By using a file descriptor the script-writer avoids the need to actually write to a file, which could save him time and make the script cleaner (no possibility of accidently leaving around files). Furthermore it lets you do all the cool things with redirecting streams to different locations and so on.\n", "Q: Windows 7 doesn't recognize the hard drive Ubuntu is on I have two hard drives, one that my Windows 7 install is on and another that I have my data is on.  I had set aside 100 GB on the data drive to install Ubuntu, which has worked fine in the past when I used GRUB.  I broke it by messing around, so I wiped it clean and decided to reinstall.\nThis time, though, I wanted to use Window's bootloader so if I break Ubuntu again I don't have to fix the MBR again.  I was following this guide, which is admittedly for dual booting off the same hard drive but I figured I could get it to work.\nI partitioned off 100 GB of my data drive and no problem, Windows still recognizes the drive just fine.  Then I installed Ubuntu (manually creating the partitions) on my data drive.  Seems to work fine, until reboot.  For some reason, Windows can no longer see the data drive at all.\nWhat's really weird is that when I was using GRUB as my bootloader it could see the drive just fine.  Why can't Windows see the hard drive?  Is there a way I can make this work?  Or am I just going to have to use GRUB as my bootloader?\n\nA: Look at the file system of your Ubuntu partition. Windows cannot hardly recognize other file systems than NTFS and FAT32. So if your Ubuntu partition is not NTFS nor FAT32 (the installer proposes ext4 by default I think), Windows will not likely recognize your partition since it does not know its file system. However, there are some softwares on Windows to see other file systems.\n", "Q: Light OS alternative to Ubuntu I have asked a question https://askubuntu.com/questions/124119/has-the-ubuntu-heating-problem-for-sony-vaio-users-been-solved which didn't seem to get any answers, but I desperately want to use a *nix based operating system (to enhance my programming skills).\nWhat *nix type OS should I use that is light, works for most important tasks of a programmer and at least has a browser, which doesn't cause (or shouldn't cause) heating problems for Sony-Vaio?\n\nA: Try Lubuntu. It is an official Ubuntu variant with the same support and packages. It uses LXDE so it is much more lightweight. \n\nA: Echo the Lubuntu tip but one step further would be to get Lubuntu Core.\nLubuntu core is the lighest one; it is still Lubuntu, but with only the bare minimum packages pre-installed. That means, although you will have bits and bobs you need like a text editor and things like that, you won't have things like libre office bulking out your system. \nYou can add what you like after basic installation anyway.

I am packaging an application for ubuntu and the only reasonable repeatable test bed I've come up with is a machine running a live CD. I can't use a VM as the application requires 3d acceleration (VirtualBox's current solution doesn't cut it).\nUnfortunately, the package is about 2GB, so it is unable to be installed, since the file system is around 4GB total. Just wondering if there's a way to increase the size of the file system in a way that would benefit what I'm trying to do?\nAny further information about how Ubuntu live CD works out how large to create the FS?\n\nA: The default LiveCD filesystem is stored entirely in RAM, so it's limited by how much physical RAM you have. I believe the default is to set it at ~50% of that number, striking a reasonable balance between temporary storage and enough memory to actually run stuff.\nAs the filesystem is necessarily very early on in the boot process, I believe it's setup by the kernel initramfs, so it would be difficult to change the ratio without building your own kernel.\nYour best option is to switch to a LiveUSB and enable persistence, creating a multi-gigabyte on-disk file that will be used to store programs, downloads, etc. instead of RAM.\n\nA: You can remaster Ubuntu which is basically extracting files from the original CD, customize the system and compile again the image\n\nA: If you have a USB flash drive, you could install Ubuntu directly onto it from the live CD. Say you have a 8GB USB, the file system could use four, and Virtualbox can use the rest. If you have a larger USB, the better.

The good news is you don't have to restore\n  a disk on another disk of the same size. The even better news is that\n  you can in fact restore the image to a much larger disk.\nWhen restoring a disk, Clonezilla enables you to resize the filesystem\n  and create partitions on the new disk proportionally. But even if you\n  are moving to a bigger disk, you might prefer to keep the partitions\n  as they are. In that case you can ask Clonezilla to create the\n  partition table as its listed in the image.\n\nThere is documentation about moving to a larger disk as mentioned here but I am not sure that you can do it the opposite (cloning to a smaller disk).\nClonezilla allow you to run cloning procedures for both physical hard disk drive, partitions or logical volumes which may be useful for your case.\nClonezilla offers several Live CD's and bootable USB images and there is also documented that you can resize the free space on the disk after the copy, in which case the suggestion to use gparted under Linux is also a good idea but you may wish to consider resizing under Windows Vista/7.\nIn the case that you wish to use all the hard disk drive capacity for the system you will simply need to start again from your USB/Live session CD), then use gParted and run the resizing process which is easy indeed.\nGood luck!\n\nA: You could try to replicate your partition setup in a bigger drive but you can't do it into a partition. You need to recreate the partitions in the new drive creating one partition per partition recovered with the same size or slightly bigger, then copy from the old to the new partitions. The 'dd' command can read and write data directly from/to partitions.\nAnother solution could be making TAR or ISO archives with the content of each partition, these could be accessed from any OS, but you couldn't boot from a OS stored in any of the archives.\n\nA: gparted can copy/paste data from one partition to another - have you tried that?  (right-click on an unmounted partition - it's in the context menu.\nUsing Gparted, you can copy data between partitions, with some constraints. You have to mind the size of the target and destination, and the destination has to be a contiguous partition. Just right-click the partition(assuming it's unmounted) and select the correct option from the context menu.\n\nA: Try clonezilla and use it to clone your Vista partition onto that 400GB partition you have.

Thanks\n\nA: Check your /var/www/ folder. There should be a file index.html which is the page that shows up when you access localhost.\nThere might be a directory named mythweb inside /var/www, which is causing this. \n", "Q: \"Continue\" button not showing while installing Ubuntu I've reached the installation screen on my netbook and have ticked all the screens (download updates etc).  The requisite memory is ticked and the internet access is ticked but I can't find a \"Install\" or \"go\" button to continue. How do I access the lower part of the small screen?\n\nA: use the TAB key to get to the next button, then press enter\n\nA: Try changing the screen resolution to a smaller value.  The window is quite big, and your netbook may not have the screen size to display the \"Continue\" button (which is at the bottom of the window).\nFirst, go to system settings by clicking the icon on the launcher with a gear.\n\nClick on \"Displays\", then click on the \"Resolution\" option.\n\nChoose a value on the options (more options should show up on your netbook).  Try a smaller value like 1024x768 until the \"Continue\" button shows up.  \nAfter you click \"Continue\", change the option back to the original one.\n\nA: I had this happened to me. If you try Emerson Hsieh's solution, you'll notice that the 'apply' button is off of your screen. Try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close the installation window.\n\n*Hit CTRL+ALT+T to open a terminal window.\n\n*Type xrandr into the terminal window and hit Enter.\n\n*All of the displays connected to your computer will be displayed. Find the one that you are using.\n\n*Find your screen's native resolution.\n\n*Type --output YourScreenName --mode YourResolution and hit return.

I see there's an existing question on how to install the Satoshi Bitcoin client, but I'm wanting to install mining software.\nLike the asker of the above question, I'm new to Ubuntu, so I'm not familiar with the process of installing software if it's not in the package manager. \nI've got a ATI 5770 card which I've previously used with the Pheonix miner, so that will likely be the best mining software to use. It's available here, but I'm not sure what to do with it now that I've downloaded it.\n\nA: First, the website says that the package depends on Python, twisted, and PyOpenCL. Python is probably already installed. However to make sure, run the following command:\nsudo apt-get install python python-twisted python-pyopencl\n\nYou'll need to enter your root password.\nNow, download the Source Code/Linux Release. You'll get a tarball, which is basically a package containing all the source files. Next, you need to untar (unpack) it. Use the following command:\ntar xzf filename.tar.gz\n\nwhere filename.tar.gz is the file you downloaded, which in this case is phoenix2-phoenix-v2.0.0-rc2-9-g2c83ee6.tar.gz.\nAfter unpacking, it will create a folder containing the source files (in this case, phoenix2-phoenix-2c83ee6). Move into the folder using \ncd phoenix2-phoenix-2c83ee6\n\nSimply use the following command, and it'll take care of everything:\n./setup.py\n\nNote: If the installation fails, this might be due to unmet dependencies. In such a case, install the dependencies and try again.\n", "Q: start lampp at startup as root \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to make sudo remember my password and how to add an application to startup \n\nI have lampp installed on my Ubuntu 12.04 Everything works very fine and now I would like to start the lampp-server on startup.\nI have a startlampp.sh script with this:\ncd /opt/lampp\nsudo ./lampp start\n\ncode in it.

So I wouldn't suggest installing it if you need something stable, so I would install wine1.4 instead. Unless you are certain the Windows application you need to run, only works on wine1.5.\nSo in short I would recommend the following:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa #This is optional since 1.4 is already available in the official repositories\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install wine1.4\n\nBut in case you are willing to install a beta package, and accept a few crashes every now and then (not saying that crashes WILL happen, but they are possible), then installing wine1.5 and reporting bugs and crashes is the way to go:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa #This is required since 1.5 is not available in the official repositories\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install wine1.4\n\n\nA: You can follow this link has given simple steps to install Wine 1.6.2 under Debian 7/6, Ubuntu 14.10/14.04/13.10/13.04/12.10/12.04/11.10 and Linux Mint 17/16/15/14/13 systems\nhope these helps  you.\n", "Q: Computer boots directly to Windows after installing Ubuntu I bought VAIO E14A16. \nI installed Ubuntu 12.04 along-side Windows 7(dual boot) from CD., When I reboot, it starts Windows 7 directly.\nIf I press F11 it says no operating system found\nWhere did I go wrong? \nIs it VAIO which is affecting? \nWhat can I do to fix this problem?\nedit\nas i said i installed 64 bit version via pen drive (outside windows) with booting from pendrive and than intalling it.\ni have no idea what grub is, and there are so many partitions vaio made. i tried to change boot from UEFI to lagacy, but it was saying some boot loader problem. i don't wanna remove windows 7. so before things get wrong i switched back to UEFI.\nwhat exactly i need to do to make ubuntu run?\n\nA: Did you specify your hard drive when you got to partitioning?\nWill your hard drive boot with the flash drive that you used for installation plugged in?\nIf so boot your hard drive, remove the flash drive and in terminal run: update-grub\n\nA: The message from Boot-repair-disk that helped me, especially the last sentence:\nIf your computer reboots directly into Windows, try to change the boot order in your BIOS.\nIf your BIOS does not allow to change the boot order, change the default boot entry of the Windows bootloader.\nFor example you can boot into Windows, then type the following command in an admin command prompt:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\debian\\grubx64.efi\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 (Lubuntu), Manage Networks, Panel Icon, Incoming Traffic. Why? Manage Networks, Panel Icon, it shows constant incoming traffic, not outgoing, just incoming packets, but I am not surfing internet, or doing any updates, I am basically not using internet, so why I got incoming traffic?\nWhether is a bad guys intrusion or not, looks like Ubuntu 12.04 (Lubuntu) its blocking it, somehow, but I am not shure.\nI thought that there should be no traffic at all, in outgoing and incoming connections, if I am not using internet at all.\nHow do I stop this traffic?\nIt something I should be worried about, in terms od security?\n\nA: There can be various reasons why there may be network traffic even though you're not actively browsing the Internet.\n\n\n*\n\n*Depending on your update settings, the update manager might fetch the new package lists automatically but only informs you about available updates, which means that the real, package update process has not been run yet, but the package list update has.\n\n*Some programs submit performance data and crash reports.\n\n*Having an NFS mounted and accessing it might also cause traffic.\n\n\nYou can use EtherApe to find out where the traffic comes from (run it as root).\nIf you want to make absolutely sure that there will be no network activity over eth0 (or eth1 or wlan or whatever you are using), you can shut it down using ifconfig (you might need root privileges for this):\n$ ifconfig eth0

And am I right to assume that Unity is just the theming scheme of Ubuntu? (Pretty much like Aero on Windows 7?)\n\nA: \nam I right to assume that Unity is just the theming scheme of Ubuntu? (Pretty much like Aero on Windows 7?)\n\n\"Unity\" is Ubuntu's default desktop environment, like the old Gnome and KDE you may remember. In a very simplistic way, sure, it's a \"theming scheme\" like Aero.\n\nAm I right to assume that Ubuntu now uses the Unity 3D?\n\nNo, Ubuntu's Unity has nothing to do with the Unity 3D gaming engine.\n\n\n*\n\n*Just Unity usually refers to Unity 3D, which is prettier but requires a reasonably modern video card; Unity 2D is the version for low-end computers.\n\n*If you prefer the \"classic\" pre-9.10 Ubuntu experience, try installing the gnome-session-fallback, which will show up on your login screen as Gnome-Classic\n\n*For lots more info on Unity and pretty pictures, see http://unity.ubuntu.com/about/\n", "Q: Why doesn't LD_PRELOAD \"v4l1compat.so\" work with 64-bit Skype? \nPossible Duplicate:\nSkype video not working after upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04 \n\nI am trying to troubleshoot my webcam and make it work with skype.\nOne workaround that is often suggested is to LD_PRELOAD the v4l1compat.so file.

See this thread\nfor some discussion on it.\n", "Q: Fresh 12.04 install on netbook Ok so, been working on this for hours now, and I haven't found anything that solves the problem yet. So, basically I have a netbook (Atom N450 processor, 1GB RAM, 10.1'' display) with windows 7 installes and decided to try Ubuntu.\nThe installation goes well and all, desktop looks beautiful, system runs like charm, then I have to reboot and all heads down.\nGRUB loads fine, and I select Ubuntu to boot. Then nothing happens, black screen with nothing on it, Ubuntu is not loading and I have to do a hard reset to get back, but no matter how many times I try, the black screen won't change.\nExcept, when I plug an external monitor to it... then it loads up!!!\nIt's been pretty frustrating and I hope someone has some experience on this issue, Having to plug it to an external monitor every time I want to work on it is not a possibility, and so far no one seems to have the same problem. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Problem fixed! Here is how I figured out (kinda) what was going on:\nAfter doing everything you told me to and not having any kind of success, I decided I'd fix a \"minor\" problem I had, which was the GRUB being in the wrong resolution.\nI followed this instructions: How do I safely change grub2 screen resolution? booting on recovery and going to root terminal (also, for some reason I had to update grub in the recovery menu, otherwise nano wouldn't save the changes).\nSet the resolution of the grub to 800x600 and that's it... the system boots properly now and without any kind of hassle. Thank you very much to everyone for the help! And hope this also helps someone else =D!\n\nA: What kind of netbook it is (Acer, Asus ecc.)? There are issues with certain producers, you can try to load it whitout acpi (add acp=off noapic to grub when booting).\n\nA: It sounds like the problem here is that Ubuntu is treating the external monitor as the primary one. One thing I'd like to suggest first of all is trying to find a hardware button on your netbook to switch displays. Usually there's a FN button on your bottom right that can be combined with the F1 to F12 buttons, and one of these probably has a symbol on it that means \"switch display output\".\nIf this doesn't help, my other suggestion would be to try to change Ubuntu's primary display or get Ubuntu to disable the external monitor completely. \nBy pressing the SHIFT key during boot, you can access the boot menu and start Ubuntu in \"recovery mode\", this might come in handy when you're changing system settings.\nAs mentioned in a separate answer here, you might want to try adding acp=off noapic to the GRUB boot line. This is usually quite simple, look out for this text in GRUB:\nPress enter to boot the selected OS, 'e' to edit the commands before booting\n\nBy pressing \"e\", you'll get the option to add some more technical mumbo jumbo to the long line of options that are by default enabled for your boot. Adding the acp=off noapic at the end of this will do the trick.\nNote that by pressing \"e\" and adding this, it will only apply to that specific boot. It  is not a permanent change and it will not be there the next time you enter GRUB. If you want to make the change permanent, you need to edit the GRUB config files. Google is handy for this :)\n", "Q: Alternatives for Shotwell on KDE For various reasons I have recently converted from Ubuntu Unity to KDE (Kubuntu). I have found suitably integrated solutions for most of the applications I used to use under Unity on my new KDE installation. All except for Shotwell. \nThe feature I miss, specifically, is to import all photos from a camera into various folders based on date. If, for example, photos were taken today, the 15th of August 2012, using Shotwell, they would be imported to the folder ~/Pictures/2012/08/15/. New folders for each year are automatically created by Shotwell and within each year, one for each month, and within each month a folder for each day.\nI have tried both Gwenview and digiKam on KDE, but I have been unable to set it up so they import the photos into these automatically created date-based folders. \nI realize that I can just continue using Shotwell (which I am), but I miss the integrated popups and such that I had when using Shotwell on Unity.\nCan anyone help me find a KDE application that is suitably integrated that can do this?\n\nA: The only application that is able to do what you want regarding the folder structure is the rapid-photo-downloader, which is available in the repositories. It is obviously an importer program, rather than a photo viewer, although you can view pictures in it as they are imported. As the screenshot shows, it has more options than any other program for controlling how pictures are imported. It can download your pictures into exactly the folder structure that you want and perform many other tasks such as renaming and reorganising your photos. \nHowever, it is very important to note that it works best when your camera card is put in a card reader, as it works every time when that is done, but does not always recognise your camera as a device for import when you connect it directly. \nFor more information on the feature set of the program, see this site.\nIf you want a more recent version than that in the repositories, as some of the latest versions contain a lot of bugfixes and improvements, you could use the following PPA, which I have used for a while:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:dlynch3\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install rapid-photo-downloader\n\n\n", "Q: Something is wrong with folders containing special characters I can create folder with special characters (example mkdir Öäväaä), but ls -l in terminal shows ??v?a?. \nWinScp and mc shows it right (Öäväaä). How can i make terminal to show me right characters?\n\nA: It depends on what terminal you're using, but if you're using the default one in Ubuntu you should be able to edit the terminal settings and change the encoding. Since it's a problem isolated to the terminal app, it's probably a setting error, and most likely encoding.\nI'm not running Ubuntu right now so I'm not sure where it's located, but I'm pretty sure it's somewhere around Edit > Preferences or similar, around where you change things like background color and font for the terminal. I'd suggest switching to UTF-8 and see if that fixes your problem.\n", "Q: Update manager doesnt offer app updates I currently use libreoffice 3.5 and I want to update to 3.6.\nI know that the update manager also updates apps so I tried to update libreoffice through the update manager but the update manager didnt show any update available for libreoffice.\nHow to fix this?\n\nA: If you want to update the package lists and update all packages from the terminal, you can run this command:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nIf this still doesn't give you the newest version of libreoffice, the repositories probably have not been updated with the newest version yet.\nYou may want to add the repository for LibreOffice to get the latest versions as quickly as possible. Instructions for this taken from Ubuntu Wiki:\nOpen a terminal. Run:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa\n\nThis will add the LibreOffice repository permanently to your list of repositories to check for new versions. Run this to update the repo lists and upgrade all new packages:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\n", "Q: How to allocate partition? (while Installing Dualboot Ubuntu & existing Win7) I have been using the existing Win7 for a long time and now want to install Ubuntu dualboot.\nI have two drives C:(35.9gb free out of 111gb)  & D: (111gb free out of 165gb)\nI tried Ubuntu and after clicking install it asks me about the partition.\nIt says my hard drive has 120gb, and on the slider the suggested partition reads 111gb on the left and 60gb on the right.\nHow should I allocate the partition? I don't know why the numbers don't sum up ..\nI'm a complete noob at things like this so I'd be very grateful if anyone can explain and help me with the partition! Thanks in advance! :)\nEDIT: and now my main question is that if I \"install alongside Windows7\" will it automatically partition for me? :p\n\nA: \nI don't know why the numbers don't sum up\n\nThe numbers do seem to add up; Ubuntu is suggesting that you install Ubuntu on the disk with the most free space (the one windows calls D:). It's now:\n[ 111 gb free | 60 gb used ] (All Windows)\n\nUbuntu is suggesting:\n[ 100 gb Ubuntu | 60 gb Windows ]\n\nHowever, I'd like to warn you that moving data within partitions (as is the case here) is dangerous. You really should backup all your data on D: before doing this, unless you don't care about losing it. When you've done that, you can setup the partitions however you like. I'd recommend atleast 30 Gb for Ubuntu to be safe, but depending on what OS you expect to use the most, you might want to use more or less. You could even use all of D: for Ubuntu, and the other disk only for Windows.\n", "Q: Removed GRUB menu, Timer Still stays I'm running a dual boot with 12.04 and Windows 7 installed.\nI don't use Windows that often, so I decided to try and remove the boot menu to start up quicker. So far, the menu appears to not display, yet my screen still displays a blank screen with the distinctive \"orange thingy\" for approximately ten seconds.\nSeveral forums I have read have instructed me to edit the etc/default/grub file to change the timeout to zero. I have done this, updated grub and restarted, yet this screen still persists.\nGrub file currently reads as:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=\"0\"\n#GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=\"0\"\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=\"true\"\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=\"0\"\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=\"`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nI have automatic login enabled and it takes approximately 35 seconds to go from powering on to my system being loaded. This is with a fresh install two days ago and my processor is an Intel® Core™ i3 CPU M 370 @ 2.40GHz × 4. \nCan someone please tell me if my computer is simply too slow to boot up any faster, or if there is step I have skipping in removing the boot screen?\nAny other information would be appreciated.\n\nA: \nmy screen still displays a blank screen with the distinctive orangey tinge for approximately ten seconds\n\nIsn't this the Ubuntu loading screen? If this is a screen that you used to see after the GRUB menu before, then it's already booting as fast as it can; when you see that screen GRUB has already been skipped.\nIf you want to optimize your boot time more, I'd suggest you turn on verbose boot (to see all the text output during the boot) and see where it stops. If it stops at certain points that are unnecessary, you might be able to disable those checks completely to boot faster.\nWhat you've done so far is just to skip the boot selection, this in itself only shaves off as many seconds as you used to have as a timeout for the default selection. It's often not more than 3-5 seconds. Whatever is shown after that selection is all OS.\n", "Q: How to force Quickly to NOT include a dependency? (Specifically: apport) My case is this - the quickly-generated application contains some apport code, so quickly inserts python-apport in the dependencies list. I would like the application to be installable and run on Linux Mint as well, where this package is missing. I would like to wrap the apport code in a try/except ImportError section, so that it is optional, and therefore python-apport would be better in the Suggests or Recommends section of the debian control file (not sure what the difference is between Suggests and Recommends), and not in Depends.\nHow can I do this?\nIf this is not possible, what are the implications if I completely remove the generated apport folder and the apport-dependent code in it?\ndef add_info(report):\n    \"\"\"add report info\"\"\"\n\n    if not apport.packaging.is_distro_package(report['Package'].split()[0]):\n        report['ThirdParty'] = 'True'\n        report['CrashDB'] = 'variety'\n\n\nA: I'm not sure what the 'variety' CrashDB is exactly, but without the third party check there, and your application not being in Ubuntu proper, it means apport won't be usable to report bugs for your application.\nWhether this is an issue or not, is something you need to decide. If it's not an issue, then the apport bits should be safe to remove.\nYou can also simply edit the generated debian/control file, and move the python-apport dependency from the Depends: field and into the Suggests: field.\n", "Q: Reinstall Ubuntu Without Losing my Personal Folder I'm using Ubuntu 12.04. I don't know what happened to my Unity and Unity 2D, but it doesn't work anymore, only Gnome Classic does (When I try to start using Gnome-Shell, the session starts with Gnome Classic). So when I log in using Unity, The only things I see are Desktop wallpaper and icons (I think Nautilus is working fine) but no launcher and no panel...\nThe fact that Gnome Classic is launched instead of Gnome-Shell made think that there is a problem with my GPU proprietary driver; though, I don't know from where to open the propritary drivers manager through Gnome Classic.\nSo what I want to do now is to completely reinstall Ubuntu without losing my personal folder. Actually, I've already seen this choice when I was upgrading 11.10 to 12.04, now it doesn't exist.\nI should add, my home folder contains more than 50GB of files, so the online backup tools won't help.\nThank you.\n\nA: This is easily achievable in Ubuntu simply boot to a live cd and choose something else.\nThen in the partition manager find the partition you have Ubuntu on and choose this as you install as normal (mount as /) but MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT FORMAT THE DRIVE by unticking the little box and keep the user name and password the same, or you will not have the permissions for the folder. When you re-install just your system files will be installed and the /home folder untouched.\nWARNING - You must set the theme to the default theme and the icons etc as every thing stored in the system folders will be deleted.\nNOTE - People (including me) have had no wifi on reinstall, you should Google this first to check any risks.\nGood luck.. \n\nA: Use the backup program supplied.

I cannot simply point it to the apache logs directory as it imports each file before deleting it. It also has no concept of duplicate records, so I cannot set up a cron to copy /var/log/apache2/* into the folder.\nI assume logrotate is the best place to do this, but I don't have a clue where to start to configure it. So my question is:\nHow can I configure logrotate to SSH rotated apache log files to a remote host automatically?\nThe alternative is to copy locally and run scp & rm via cron, but a one-step SSH process would be nice.\n\nA: Look at the prerotate and postrotate configuration options (examples in man logrotate). You could for instance have a prerotate that scps the file (make sure you configure SSH keys properly; your root user should be able to ssh to the target system without needing a password). This would copy the access.log file before rotating (renaming, compressing, etc) it.\nNote that in this case you would lose any accesses that happen between the copying of the file and the rotation step, so you could also put this in the postrotate section but copy access.log.1 instead.\nin /etc/logrotate/apache2 (this may be different, I only have access to a Debian system) you can add the prerotate section so the contents of the file look like this:\n/var/log/apache2/*.log {\n    weekly\n    missingok\n    rotate 52\n    compress\n    delaycompress\n    notifempty\n    create 640 root adm\n    sharedscripts\n    postrotate\n        /etc/init.d/apache2 reload > /dev/null\n    endscript\n    prerotate\n        scp /var/log/apache2/access.log you@elsewhere.com\n    endscript\n}\n\n", "Q: My Mac can't boot Ubuntu Yesterday, I ran my Ubuntu Live CD to check if my OS partition was damaged, as I halted the computer from the Mac's button too much times.

XLConnect should normally install fairly quickly. It may take a while to download the packages as XLConnect is about 1.6MB in size and the dependency XLConnectJars is about 16.5MB in size (you may try different mirrors). \nAn alternative is to download the source packages (XLConnect & XLConnectJars) from CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/XLConnect/index.html) and then to use install.packages(\"/path/to/pkg.tar.gz\", repos = NULL)\n\nA: In my case the problem was with the default version of java.

Use Avinash Raj's answer instead. Also consider reporting a bug for both conflicting packages.\n\nYou have to force overwrite the files causing issues:\nsudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite <file-path>\n\nIn your case it would be:\nsudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite /var/cache/apt/archives/libjline-java_1.0-1_all.deb\n\nCheck that everything is fixed by running:\nsudo apt-get --fix-broken install\n\nIf you still have problems, rerun the first step with any of the dpkg: error processing (...) remaining.\nSolution found on webupd8\n\nA: Please don't go for the danjjl answer directly, if you face this kind of \"trying to overwrite\" error, is likely that you have conflicting packages that need to be solved first.\nThe immediate fix for the issue is to remove the conflicting package that is undesirable, in this case scala,\nsudo dpkg -P scala\n\nNext it would be recommended to submit a bug report with the respective package maintainers.

Considering a Lenovo Tablet PC, (not sure which one yet).\nWill UBUNTU work with full tablet functionality including touch screen?\nDo any touch screen Tablet PC's work? (Panasonic, HP, Dell, etc...)?\n\nA: The Lenovo Thinkpad X220i Tablet is Ubuntu certified (for 11.10), as is the ThinkPad X201 (for 10.04).\nThe Lenovo Ideapad S10-3T (keep in mind that this is a convertible netbook/tablet as opposed to a \"pure\" tablet) was featured in this episode of the Linux Action Show, and apparently works very well with 12.04 (numerous threads on the Ubuntu Forums indicate that this model is not at all well-supported by earlier versions). If I recall correctly, screen rotation functionality was still lacking, but the LAS guys had set up a simple workaround.\nWhile multitouch was added to Ubuntu a couple of years ago (as per this article) and I have seen YouTube videos of the S10-3T (as well as other tablets) that show multi-touch working very nicely (such as this one), the research I have done has not turned up any information about actually getting this to work, and has yielded many examples of unsuccessful attempts. Basic single-touch functionality is all there though, and I'm sure multi-touch will come soon enough. Until then though, it is worth mentioning that you can use a program called Touchégg to create useful touch gestures.\n\nA: I had success with an older HP TC1100 with the exception of screen rotation, but it would be best to make a USB boot (or use an external USB CD/DVD drive) and test the hardware from that.\n\nA: As long as they are built on a Intel chipset, they will probably work quiet well.\nBeware: Tablets with ARM CPU architecture, built for Windows 8 RT, will not work with Ubuntu out of the box, due to the Microsoft Secure Boot feature(?!?)...\nThere is still a way to make these run  Linux, using Fedora or maybe SuSE Linux\nMicrosoft Inks Pact with Fedora Over Windows 8 / Secure Boot\nSUSE Linux Outlines Its Plans for Windows 8 Secure Boot\n\nA: I can't speak for all the Lenovo tablets but I have been running 12.04 on an X60 (tablet-laptop convertible) for some time now and 11.10 before that. \nMost of the functions work out-of-the-box, with a few exceptions. For example if you want to use the tablet stylus with a 2nd monitor hooked in you will need to run MapToOutput to reassign the cursor to the tablet screen only. The screen rotate button doesn't work but you can either use a rotate script as I do or use the Jupiter power app which has a display rotation option. The finger print reader works fine but I set it up on windows before I changed to ubuntu so I cant vouch for that.

When you click it, you should be able to select your USB Pendrive as a boot device.\nIf your USB that doesn't work enter your BIOS setup (This is also achievable by clicking a specific key, usually Del or F2), search for a setting like Enable boot from USB and make sure it is enabled.\nAutomatic Boot from USB\n(This is not recommended if the previous step works, explanation at the end of this paragraph)\nFirst Make sure that you enabled boot from USB, as explained the previous paragraph.\nIn the BIOS setup, search for a setting called Boot Order, usually it is under a tab called Boot, change this settings and rearrange the boot devices to have the USB devices at the top.\nNow if you followed this step, make sure that you rearrange the boot order to have the USB after your hard disk drives when you are done. Because some systems, will not start if you have a \"non-bootable\" USB device connected (like a USB Mouse, or an empty USB flash drive, etc...) and will show you a black screen.

This meant that often at bootup in the morning, the router would be \"down\", and the computer wouldn't even be able to get an IP address.\nThat IP address is a fixed address assigned by the router, and is set as the \"bind address\" in mysql configuration file (\"my.cnf\")\nI haven't tested my theory properly, but I have noticed that sometimes it works at bootup and sometimes not.  And I definitely know that it fails to start if the bind address is wrong - exhibiting the same sorts of failure messages in dmesg.\nThanks all for responding!\n\nA: The MySQL service is probably not enabled at boot.\nTry sudo update-rc.d mysql defaults and reboot.\n", "Q: personalize session list on (KDM|GDM|LightDM|some_other) A bit of an odd question:\nI want to change the list of sessions available on (KDM|GDM|LightDM|some_other) to a user, without affecting the sessions available to others.\nSpecifically, I have one user that is not very computer-savvy, and I want to prevent the said user from changing session type accidentally.

Rather than throw away the old hard drive, I bought an enclosure for it to turn it into an external hard drive, and, since all the data was migrated to my new drive, I decided to install Ubuntu on it for funsies (note: I am a near-total Ubuntu n00b).   \nMy first attempt to install Ubuntu didn't work (it gave me errors about not being able to find the BIOS or something), but my second attempt finished successfully (can't remember what, if anything, I did different). \nHowever, when I plug the external drive into my Macbook, it gives me a message saying it can't read the disk. Moreover, when I go into the Startup Manager (i.e.: what you get when you turn on the Macbook while holding the option key), the external drive is not one of the  available startup disks. I thought this might be because I have an older Macbook, so I tried booting it with my mom's Late 2011 Macbook, and got the same results. Then I tried booting it through my dad's Dell laptop that runs Windows 7, and that time it worked. This is really counter intuitive to me, since the hard drive originally came from a Macbook, so if anything you'd think it would be less compatible with the Windows laptop than the Macbook.\nIn case it helps, here's a link to a picture of how I set up the partition table while doing the install (not shown there is the fact that I checked the \"Format?\" box next to the /boot partition, since it gave me a warning when I tried to continue the installation without doing so)\n\nAnyone have any clue at all? If it helps, the hard drive I'm using is a 120GB 5400-rpm Serial ATA hard disk drive.\n\nA: First of all your drive needs to be formatted with the GUID partition table (changed by clicking the options button when partitioning in Disk Utility), \nWhy because Intel Macs can only boot from GUID hard drives. Second you should be able to boot using rEFIt, but rEFIt must be installed on a External drive E.G.

I have seen on other posts that the laptop thingis just a bug.\n\nA: Try editing these settings for nvidia, in terminal type :\nsudo nvidia-settings\n\nand create a x-screen profile for the monitor.\n\nA: I have the same issue with my father's computer. What did the trick was to go into the dash and type: Nvidia X Server Settings. Open it and then go into the tab X Server Display Configuration.  Tick enable for Xinerama. Then click apply. To make this permanent, click Save to X Configuration File You may have to reboot afterwards for it to take affect. If it still doesn't work, play with the settings in here. It may be that it is configured that the other monitor is off.

I have Intel Core 2 Duo processor which is x86_64, I have installed Microsoft Virtual PC on this Intel laptop, when I tried to install x86_64 Ubuntu(amd64) on my Virtual PC, I get a kernel error message. I really would like to use Ubuntu on this machine.\nCan anyone help?\n\nA: tl;dr: Use VirtualBox. Don't use VPC.\nVirtual PC 2007 is quite old and no longer under development. It is unlikely that any bugfixes have been put in recently. It also doesn't officially support Linux. Since I don't know the nature of your error or if there is even a fix, I recommend you use Virtualbox as it is still being updated and has great Linux support. Moreover, it is free and open-source, which helps with bugfixes and security. It is very similar:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install it\n\n*Open the program.\n\n*Click on New at the top.\n\n*Set the RAM to at least 512MB if possible. 1 or more GB is recommended.\n\n*Make the disk dynamic and at least 100GB. It uses about 1.8 GB on your host drive once installed and only uses more space on the host as you use space on the guest. Be sure to use the VDI option.\n\n*Finish up and right click the virtual machine in the menu and click \"Settings\"\n\n*Under System->Acceleration, turn on both the VT-x/AMD-V and the nested paging options.\n\n*Click OK and start the VM.\n\n*In the first run wizard, point the VM to the ISO file you downloaded for Ubuntu.\n\n*Boot up and install as usual. You have no risk of damaging your Windows partitions.\n\nIf you are unable to use AMD-V, or Intel Virtualization technology, turn it on in your BIOS(You probably will have one or the other, not both), and see this answer. Note that some BIOSes and processors do not support virtualization.\n\nA: Here's my answer, ObsessiveFOSS has it summed up pretty well, but really, unless you're doing Scientific Calculations, managing large MySQL databases, 64bit operating systems are just luxury for the name. 32bit operate just as well, and probably under the Virtual Machine, a little faster. Since this is a 64bit laptop, it's capable of running both 64bit operating systems (x86_64) as well as 32bit operating systems (x86). Again as I quote ObsessiveFOSS, \"Virtual PC 2007 is quite old and no longer under development. It is unlikely that any bugfixes have been put in recently. It also doesn't officially support Linux.\" So, I would use 32bit unless you ABSOLUTELY have to use 64, in which I have yet to encounter a situation that forces me into that corner. Virtual Box is a great, free, virtual machine that will run Ubuntu just fine. \nAlso a tip I would do, is to put the Kernel Error into the question, it might be that the iso was incomplete when downloaded or something along those lines. It would make the question a little bit easier to solve, just as a heads up for future questions! \n\nA: The reason you can't install a 64-bit OS into Virtual PC is, as mentioned, probably because Virtual PC only supports 32-bit operation.\nWith VirtualBox you can install a 64-bit guest running on a 64-bit host, but only if the CPU supports hardware virtualization, otherwise you must use a 32-bit guest even if the host is running 64-bit.\nNot all Intel Core 2 Duo processors support hardware virtualization; specifically it is not supported on the E4000 series (E4300, E4400, E4500 E4600 & E4700), some members of the E7000 series (e.g. E7200, E7300) or the E8190.\nYou may need to check the actual variant of your CPU if you want to run a 64-bit guest,\n", "Q: How to stop automatic time update?

However an issue occurred after I downloaded and setup a web-gui (gitlist) to share my repositories.\nI'm sure the problem is that everytime I push up some updates, the file permissions for some reference files in the repository have their file permissions changed and Apache can't access them (and thus, the web-gui won't get access to the repository).\nWhen I installed it, I did the following steps:\n\n*\n\n*Created a git user and setup the repositories for this user.\n\n*Added www-data user to the git-group with usermod -a -G git www-data\n\n*Made sure git was the group for the repositories: sudo chgrp -R git repositories/\n\n*Used chmod on the folders to give access for all users in the group: sudo chmod ug+s repositories/\nAs soon as I do a push with git the file permission for 2-3 files are changed (for instance the '/repository/[name]/refs/head/master' file) and it is set to -rw-------, and only the git-user got access to the file. No other users can read or write here.\nI would like that those files would stay with the given permission (for instance chmod 755) after I do a git push, so I don't need to update the permissions every time someone does a push.\n\nA: As this isa Q&A site, and I found the answer my self after a lot of crawling through google searches and solved this.\nThe basic problem goes back to a umask that was set, that masked all the files when I did the push - and I had to change this. To do this I did the following:\nopen the .gitolite.rc file in the root of my repository and set the the variable:\n$REPO_UMASK = 0022 \n\n(Set the Umask to the mask you want to have). After this my files were not stripped for the read-permission for the group.\n", "Q: how to create the partition from unallocated space I have some free space in my Hard disk and i want to create it as a NTFS partition to able to detect in my Windows XP .

Now, when I get to work and plug the laptop in and power it up, it connects via wired (correct behavior), shortly after the wireless begins searching for its favorite network (also correct) but as soon as it finds a network to connect to, I lose Internet.\nIf I disconnect from the wireless network, leaving the wireless radios powered on, and refresh the wired connection, all is well again. Powering down the wireless radios also corrects the problem.\nHow can I set this up so that the wired network (if available) always has precedence over the wireless?\n\nA: Click on the Network Manager applet on the top panel of the screen (where you also choose which wireless network to connect to etc.). \nSelect Edit connections... → Wireless tab → Edit... for the wireless network your notebook connects to when you lose Internet. \nGo to IPv4 Settings → Routes.... In the pop-up window, check the Use this connection only for resources on its network. Confirm your change, if you're using IPv6 you've got to do that also in the IPv6 Settings. Save settings, then disable and re-enable all networking. \nWired network should now supersede wireless network again. (It works the other way round for me - I got a wireless network with Internet and a wired without.)\n(Hope I didn't misunderstand the question - I couldn't comment on your question to ask for details because I haven't got enough rep.)\n", "Q: Upgrade problem- 11.10 to 12.04? I tried to upgrade to 12.04 using the update manager in 11.10. It opens up a dialog which says downloading upgrade tools and just closes. Anyways to upgrade? Or a working solution to this problem? I would like to upgrade internally therefore keeping all of my files instead of installing a new version of Ubuntu entirely. Any ideas?\n\nA: If you cannot upgrade using the Update Manager, download the ISO file from the Ubuntu website. Make a Live USB or CD/DVD, then boot using the download media. During the installation, you can either upgrade or do a fresh install.\n\nA: Here's my advice. If you want to keep all your files, there is the way green7 listed by downloading the new iso and using a live install, however if you look here This tells you how to do a network upgrade properly and should be of some help. If not I think green7's answer is what you'll want to work on. \nHere's what the link says: Network Upgrade for Ubuntu Desktops 10.04 LTS to 12.04 LTS (Recommended)\nNote that the page under https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/ReleaseNotes/UbuntuDesktop#Upgrading_from_Ubuntu_10.04_LTS_to_Ubuntu_12.04_LTS says: \"It is generally recommended that users of Ubuntu 10.04 LTS wait until the first point release, due in August, before upgrading.\" Follow the instructions there if you want to upgrade earlier since the following instructions will probably not work until then.\nYou can easily upgrade over the network with the following procedure.\nOpen the Update Manager application from the System → Administration menu.\nIn Update Manager, click the Settings... button, and enter your password to start the Software Sources application.\nSelect the sub menu Updates from the Software Sources application.\nCheck the \"Release upgrade - Show new distribution releases\" drop down to make sure \"Long term support releases only\" is selected, and change it if otherwise.\nClose the Software Sources application and return to Update Manager.\nIn Update Manager, click the Check button to check for new updates.\nIf there are any updates to install, use the Install Updates button to install them, and press Check again after that is complete.\nA message will appear informing you of the availability of the new release.\nClick Upgrade. \nFollow the on-screen instructions. \n\nA: You could try this:\nsudo apt-get install update-manager-core\n\nEdit /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades and set Prompt=normal;\nFollowed by: sudo do-release-upgrade -d\nSource: Howto: Upgrade To Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin From 10.04, 11.04, 11.10 | Desktop & Server\n", "Q: How do I create a dd image of multiple filesystems in Xubuntu 12.04? I have four filesystems with various sample files on them that I want to combine into a single image. How would I do this using dd? Should I be using something else other than dd? Thanks.\n\nA: While you can either have the entire disk be imaged, or one partition, it is impossible to use dd to put multiple partitions (selectively) in one file. It would require reworking the partition table of the image. You can, however, selectively copy multiple partitions to separate files. Let's copy /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda3 below:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/media/HARDDISK/sda1.img\n\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda3 of=/media/HARDDISK/sda3.img\n\nThis creates two files in the directory of your choice (see second argument).

It still displays standard 80x25 terminal screens fine, but anything beyond that causes the video card to fail and require rebooting. As I intend to use this as a headless server, I'm not really interested in buying a new video card just for the installation.\nThe problem I run into is that Ubuntu - including the Server and Alternate installers - kick you to a (comparatively) high-res splashscreen that causes my video card to turn off, even though the rest of the install process uses a 80x25 TUI.\nI've tried preseeding, but I have no experience with that and not having feedback makes my life difficult.\nAs I see it, there are (at least) two ways to accomplish this, neither of which I can find a way to accomplish:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pass a parameter that starts SSH (or VNC) and operate the install from another machine.\n\n*Disable the high-resolution splash screen.\n\n*Some other method that I haven't thought of.\n\n\nI would prefer to use Ubuntu Server, but I'm not married to it. For what it's worth, every other distro I've tried (Debian, CentOS, Arch) also have high-res splashscreens. The only one that does, in fact, work is FreeNAS, but I'd strongly prefer a Linux variant over BSD.\n\nA: Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ok, as quickly as you can after you know that you are about to get to the splash screen, press Enter, then Esc, then Enter. The timing here is critical as your video card is about to fail.\n\n*This will drop you into a Text Mode Interface. You will now see a prompt that says Boot:. Type this exactly into the Prompt: \n/install/vmlinuz file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu-server.seed initrd=/install/initrd.gz -- nomodeset\nThis will now boot you into the installer.\nGood luck\n", "Q: Screen capture as stream over LAN I'm searching for a solution to capture my desktop and output it as a live stream for clients in a local network.

After running these two commands:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop\n\nI am left with a glut of installed packages that I don't need/want on my Lubuntu install.  I just wanted to see how Unity performed under Lubuntu.\nI've discovered I can view the list of installed programs by looking at my /var/log/apt/history.log\nI'd like to simply cut and paste this list into a sudo apt-get remove command but first I need to delete the portions apt-get won't understand.  Basically everything inside the parenthesis (including parenthesis themselves) needs to go.  Additionally the following comma and space after each entry will also need deleting.\nThe closest I've come with sed so far is:\nsed -e 's/(.*),[[:space:]]//g' apt-log.txt\n\nThis is not right since it deletes almost everything.  I presume this is because its matching the very last instance of \"), \" and deleting everything before it until \"(\".  Here's a link to program list from the log I'm trying to edit.    \nAs you can imagine, I would rather not edit that list by hand.  I know next to nothing about regular expressions and am trying to learn but a few specific pointers would go a long way. Or maybe there's a much better way to go about this?\n\nA: Your problem with the regular expression is its greediness (the * and + quantifiers try to match as much, as they can). Unfortunately there is no way to tell sed to use non-greedy regular expressions. You have to use Perl to accomplish that, although ugly workarounds for sed do exist.\nSo try the following Perl one-liner:\nperl -pe 's/\\(.*?\\)(, )?//g' /var/log/apt-history.log\n\nThat should manipulate the text as you wish. You will find PCRE (Perl regular expressions) very similar to the POSIX / GNU BRE and ERE one sed uses.\n\nA: You're probably better off running apt-get autoremove - which removes broken dependencies - rather than editing a file and passing them on manually.\n", "Q: DNS issues with 12.04, apt-get, and openssh On a fresh Ubuntu 12.04 installation, we noticed that we were having issues with openssh as it was constantly breaking the connection randomly after a period of time. After doing some debugging, we found that we were able to consistently replicate the issue as follows:\nping google.com #works\nsudo apt-get clean #no issues\nsudo apt-get update #stays at 0%, must ^C to exit\nping google.com #no longer connects\n\nThe only method that can be used to restore DNS access is to reboot the machine. \nAdditional info:\nWe have replaced the resolve.conf symlink with an actual file to specify google's nameserver 8.8.8.8 (which I have personally done before in 12.04 in our network without issues). The machine is in a static network without DHCP and is issued a static IP address. There are no issues pinging the machine from elsewhere in the network, but when openssh was installed the ssh connection would be refused.\nAnyone have any suggestions on how to resolve this?\n\nA: It turns out the issue was related to IPv6. Somehow during install Ubuntu defaulted to IPv6 (which our network doesn't support), causing it to lose connection.\nReinstalling Ubuntu without being connected to the network resolved the issue, but I'm sure there would be an easier way to do it.\nEDIT: The issue came back awhile later but we were finally able to deduce that there was another machine with the same IP address in the network. Changing the IP address resolved the issue.\n", "Q: Should I be worried? md5 I installed Ubuntu 12.04 a few weeks ago, from a download off of the website. I still have the dvd used. I was talking to my friend today about it and he mentioned something about checking the hash to make sure it was a good copy, as sometimes the file can get corrupted by a third party. My question is, can I check the hash of the dvd or even off of the versio\n\nA: No, you should not be worried, and yes, it can be checked. Checking a hash is a universal procedure. While not technically correct, a hash is basically a \"one-way encryption\" that give a short, usually-unique code to check if the file became garbled. If it installed properly, chances are it's a good file. If you still have the ISO file around, checking the hash is quite easy. Copy it to your home folder and call it ubuntu-hashme.iso. Now, open Terminal, and when you get thee user@computer:~$ prompt, run the following:\nmd5sum ubuntu-hashme.iso\n\nand it will give a string(it could take some time depending on the speed of your computer). It should correspond to the strings on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes/, depending on what file you downloaded.

Alternatives are md5sum, hashdeep and rhash.\n\nAll Ubuntu ISOs should contain a md5sum.txt file, which contains MD5 hashes of all files on the disk. Some installers even offer to check this file first before installing. There are a lot of tools out there to check/match lists of hashes. I prefer cfv from the cfv package.\ncfv -f *.md5\n\nThis checks all md5 files in a directory, shows a progress bar and finally statistics (good files, damaged files, etc).\nOne step further:\nfind -name *.md5 -print -execdir cfv -f {} \\;\n\nThis will check all md5 files in a directory and subdirectories.\nNote: The hash for the whole ISO at the download page is for checking the download and detect man in the middle attacks, the MD5 hashes on the ISO are for verifying the content once it's burned or transfered another way to a medium.\n", "Q: How can I change the HUD key from the command line? I know I can change the HUD shortcut key by going into System Settings... > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Launchers > Key to show the HUD.\nI need to do this from the command line, so I can put it in a postinstall script called from preseed.\n\nA: The following seems to work for me (on Ubuntu 12.04) to set the HUD key to Alt:\ngconftool-2 --set \"/apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/show_hud\" --type string \"<Alt>\"\n\nI can replace \"<Alt>\" (the default) with the desired keystroke, e.g. \"<Alt>x\" (for Alt+X) or \"<Control>\" for Ctrl.\nNote that if you have a different screen configuration (e.g. multiple monitors), the \"screen0\" in the above key name may need to be changed accordingly.

I get the notion that an older system runs faster. Is this true?

Also, being old, the Virtualbox in the repositories for it has not been updated so it is also full of bugs. 12.04 will do fine to run Virtualbox with a guest.\nYou can opt to use Unity 2D if you are having low graphics performance on the host, by clicking the circle when you are prompted for your password at login and selecting Unity 2D.\nIf it is still too slow, you can use 10.04 as it has somewhat less RAM usage while being more up-to-date, or you can install an alternate desktop enviromnent.

I want to set up automatic backups to a network drive, but I don't want the contents of Private to be readable on the remote server.  My understanding is that the Ubuntu \"Backup\" utility would run while I'm logged in, so it would see the folder contents without encryption.  I'm backing up from a laptop, so it is essentially only on when I am logged in.  \nI know that the Private folder is essentially a mounted filesystem, so it seems like I should be able to backup the encrypted image rather than the cleartext contents.  \nWhat steps are needed to safely back it up, while maintaining the encryption?   Note that I'm already familiar with the backup tools available, this question is about dealing with the ecryptfs folder safely.\n\nA: As it turns out, the .Private filesystem is ecryptfs, which contains a separate encrypted file for each item.  \nMy solution is to backup the contents of ~/.Private (even though it is mounted at the time).

I have Sublime Text 2 installed and I have it configured to my liking. There is a newer version of Sublime Text 2, but I have put off downloading it since I do not want to lose my configuration.\nI was told to just extract the downloaded tar file over the existing files but I am a bit nervous about doing this, since I do not want to lose all of the extensions I have added to Sublime Text nor do I want to lose my configuration, and also I am not sure how to do this.\nI have the newer version downloaded and it is in /var/cache/sublime-text-2/Sublime Text 2 Build 2181.tar.bz2\nI believe my existing Sublime Text 2 editor is in /usr/lib/sublime-text-2.\nCan anyone give me some direction as to how to extract the latest Sublime Text 2 to be found in /var/cache/ and ensure that it is extracted to /usr/lib/sublime-text-2.\nOf course the next question is; can I do this without losing the extensions I have added to Sublime Text 2?\n\nA: SublimeText does not store its settings and plugins (at least those you downloaded using PackageControl) in the same directory as the editor itself (/usr/lib/sublime-text-2 in your case) - the settings are stored in /home/(yourusername)/.config/sublime-text-2/, so they won't be overridden when you install a new version.\nBut, just in case, you can make a backup copy of your current install before unpacking.

For instance, are you sure it runs on port 25? I have had a similar issue with a server I had written, which I tried to telnet on port 7980, when I had asked it to bind to port 7908. \nIf I were in your shoes the first diagnostics I would run myself is a netstat to make sure that the server is indeed listening on that port. Netstat appears to be just the tool for the job. You might try in a command line something like this: netstat -l --numeric-ports | grep james, and see what you can make out of that. If you are not a command line fan, you can use the application Network tools, go to Netstat, and from the bullet list activate the choice Display: Active Network Services.\nIf it is indeed running on that port, my next thought would be a firewall or something. Have you tried to reach on the server from another host, on the same network? \n[EDIT]: A quick look at the quick start guide suggests that in order to be able to run James properly, you need libc6 installed on Linux !! - sudo apt-get install libc6-i386 libc6-dev-i386. If you have ensured libgc6 is installed, and you have properly added domains and users, though it still doesn't seem to work, you might want to go through the configuration files. Of particular interest seem to be the following: smtpsever.conf, pop3server.conf, and perhaps database.properties and jmx.properties. PLEASE NOTE that you should be careful while editing these files. I suggest that you look for hints as to why your server is not binding to the address properly. I DO NOT know the files' contents ahead of time, so I can not advise on edits.\nNOTE: If all else fails, you might want to try using james via the java cli:\nusage: java org.apache.james.cli.ServerCmd --host <arg> <command>\n    -h,--host </arg>   node hostname or ip address\n    -p,--port </arg>   remote jmx agent port number\n\n", "Q: Kubuntu 12.04 loging failure When I load up Kubuntu 12.04 and I type in my password the loading screen only gives me one icon.

Profiling is rarely done on debug builds.\nUbuntu seems to either give you the choice of stripped optimized executables or debug builds.  I've run into this on both libc and vmlinux-... which I extracted out of vmlinuz.\nAfter I extracted it I found that it was stripped.\nDo I have to build my own system libraries just to get symbols?  Do symbols really take that much memory or disk?  The full debug version lib libc is only 7.6MB's and is shared across all running processes!  The optimized version, with symbols should be similarly tiny.  Why are these stripped?\nWhat apt-get do I need for libc and vmlinuz to get optimized non-stripped versions?\n\nA: By policy, Ubuntu builds everything with debugging symbols enabled, and then we strip these symbols out of the binary packages. For almost all users, these symbols are wasted space, and for some things this can be a significant amount of wasted space and download time. For example, Firefox and LibreOffice have nearly a gig of debugging symbols, and you'll have noticed that the kernel debug symbols are hundreds of megabytes.\nFor the small number of people who need these symbols - and when you need them, you really need them - we take all the debugging symbols out of the binary packages and stick them in a -dbgsym package. See Debugging Program Crash for how to get at the dbgsym repository.\nSome packages don't have a -dbgsym package. Mostly these are packages which have a -dbg package already, or don't have any debugging symbols from the build - either because they don't actually have any executable code, or (sometimes) because of a build bug.\n\nA: Debugging symbols are usually made into a separate package that can be installed along side the actual package. They usually have a -dbg appended on the end. \nFor example, the package mythtv is named\nmythtv\n\nand the debugging symbols are located in \nmythtv-dbg\n\nSo you would need to have both of those packages installed to debug MythTV\n", "Q: Sound Settings is missing all output devices \nPossible Duplicate:\nMy sound stopped working today, how can I fix it? \n\nI'm baffled by this discrepancy:\n\n\n*\n\n*This speaker test is successful:\nspeaker-test -c 6 -D 'surround51:CARD=PCH,DEV=0'\n\n\n*Sound Settings is behaving as if I have no sound card:\n\nHow do I find out what's causing this problem?\nDetails\nHave a look at aplay -L, pacmd list-cards, lshw, pulseaudio -vvvv, and pavucontrol.

But when I let udev run it, it just get the following error from xrandr:\n# output of bash -x think-dock on\n+ xrandr --output LVDS1 --auto\nCan't open display\n\nNow if I call xrandr from my sudo -i shell, I get:\nNo protocol specified\nNo protocol specified\nCan't open display :0\n\nHowever, if I do su -c xrandr mu from my sudo -i shell, I get the expected output.\nSo I do not really understand, the script called from udev fails.\n\nA: *\n\n*xrandr needs to know which display you're talking about, typically via the DISPLAY environment variable\n\n*root (which udev runs as) has no default DISPLAY set; even if he/she did, su -c does not preserve the environment by default\n\n*So pass it along explicitly to bash, and that should solve your problem, e.g.:\nsu -c \"DISPLAY=:0.0 bash -x /usr/bin/think-dock $setto\" \"$user\"\n\n", "Q: Play minecraft on ubuntu?

This will show the all the kernels that are installed.\n\n*Note down the names of all the kernels which you want to remove.\n\n*To remove the kernels, run: sudo apt-get purge linux-image-x.x.x.x-xyz (replace the kernel name with an appropriate one).\n\n*Update the GRUB: sudo update-grub2\nAnd, you're done.\nBonus: here's a little one-liner to do all that automatically:\nsudo apt-get purge $( dpkg --list | grep -P -o \"linux-image-\\d\\S+\" | grep -v $(uname -r | grep -P -o \".+\\d\") )\n\n\nA: Try this command. It's a refined version of the same apt-get remove command\nsudo apt-get autoremove linux-image-3.2.0-23-generic-pae\n\nBy replacing remove with autoremove, the removal process automatically finds and removes other dependencies left as well, so you will get a clean uninstallation, rather than having to go here and there and delete the leftovers.\nRepeat the process for other old kernels as well.\nAfter that, run\nsudo update-grub\n\nAfter that, you will see only the latest kernel.\n\nA: I usually just start Synaptic (which has to be installed separately these days), search for \"linux\" in the Installed category and mark all old versions of the kernel and linux-headers (i.e. all except the current one) to be removed. When uninstalled, they're removed from GRUB menu.\nThere must be a nifty single-line command to do that, but it feels safer just to do that manually\n\nA: I suggest you enter this in a terminal session (Alt-Ctrl-T):\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis command causes grub to use os-prober and to update the menu.\nIf you have partitions with old Ubuntu releases on them that had used grub (it appears the OP had a natty release partition somewhere, maybe more) it's necessary to clean them up too before running update-grub on the current system. os-prober finds Windows and other Linux partitions. For other Linux partitions it copies the items from their grub menus, if any, rather than looking at their kernel files.\nIf you have a really messed up configuration the best solution may be to boot your Ubuntu system and reinstall grub with:\nsudo apt-get --reinstall install grub2\n\nWhile reinstalling grub it will recreate the /etc/default/grub and the /boot/grub/menu.cfg file, based on the installed kernels in that partition and on the kernels installed in the grub configurations of other (presumably older) Ubuntu partitions (doesn't seem to be any for the OP).\n\nA: The slickest solution would be using ubuntu-tweak. After installation, fire it up, go to Janitor, choose Old Kernel, select the old kernels you intend to remove and Clean. That's it! (Note that only old kernels show up in the janitor)\n\nA: I found what this problem was.\nThe issue was that, when I upgraded Ubuntu, by installing through a liveUSB instead of doing a normal upgrade, it left behind the old kernel files in the /boot folder.\nNow that I have upgraded in the same way from 12.10 to 13.04, I encountered the same situation.\nThe solution is to manually delete all the files related to the old kernels in the /boot folder and run sudo update-grub.

I still can't use that password to authenticate though!\nHopefully we're getting closer.. Thanks so much for all your help :)\n\nA: Summary: How This Problem Has Developed\nSo far, this problem appears to have progressed through two stages.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, it was not possible to log in at all, on the graphical login screen. It was possible to log in on a virtual console. Information obtained in a virtual console indicated that:\n\n\n*\n\n*The output of df -h shows there's plenty of free space available. Graphical login has been known to fail when there is zero or very little free space on the hard disk, but that is apparently not what's wrong here.\n\n*The output of dpkg -l | egrep 'lightdm|gdm|kdm|lxdm' shows that the only display manager (which provides the login screen) installed is LightDM. This information was valuable because a potential solution to being unable to log in could have been to try a different display manager (for example, by installing and switching to gdm).\n\n*When changing the password, you said \"had to do the mount remount thing first but it said the password was successfully changed after that.\" That suggests to me that you actually changed the password by booting into recovery mode, and not on the virtual console. If I am mistaken about this assumption, please let me know.\n\n\n*Now, you can log in, presumably by entering your username and password at the graphical login screen. (Please make sure to let me know if this is not correct.) However, you cannot authenticate after logging in. Therefore:\n\n\n*\n\n*Changing the password appears to have fixed part of the problem. I'm guessing the password either had not been set properly during installation (perhaps due to some bug), or it contained characters that for some reason LightDM is unable to handle on its login screen, or it contained characters that mapped to different keys on your keyboard during installation than they did on the LightDM login screen. With your new password, you can log in.\n\n*However, the problem is not entirely fixed, because you cannot authenticate after logging in. I have preserved the general information I presented as my original answer in the first section below, entitled Password Doesn't Work On Login Screen. That information may be useful to other people who experience similar problems. Please skip down to the section called Can Log In, But Other Authentication Fails.\n\n\n\nPassword Doesn't Work On Login Screen\nA few things to check:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is Caps Lock on?\n\n\n*\n\n*Similarly, if you're using the numeric keypad to enter some of the characters, is Num Lock on?\n\n\n*Does your password contain unusual characters? (Perhaps you've found a weird bug.) Have you tried different passwords?\n\n*Did you set your password with a different keyboard layout from the one you're using to authenticate with it? If so, you may be typing in a totally different password.\n\n*Is your password blank (i.e., the zero character long password)? This doesn't work properly; you need to have an actual password.\n\n*Maybe something is systematically going wrong during the installation process. If you started with an Ubuntu ISO image, then:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you mounted the image in Windows and installed from it without burning a CD/DVD or writing a USB flash drive, MD5 test the ISO image.\n\n*If you wrote the image to a USB flash drive or burned it to a CD/DVD, then in addition to the image possibly being corrupt, the installation medium (CD/DVD or USB flash drive) could be a bad burn/write. So boot from it and check it by pressing a key when you see the keyboard and person icons at the bottom of the screen, and selecting Check disc for defects.\n\n\nIt's common for a bad ISO or a bad burn/write to prevent installation from succeeding, but it is also possible to get a broken installation.\nAs for fixing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have a Wubi system*, so GRUB runs after the Windows boot loader. Select Ubuntu on the screen where Windows and Ubuntu are you two choices, then press Shift and hold it down, then press Enter. This way, the Shift key is being pressed as the Windows boot loader chain-loads GRUB.\n\n\n*\n\n**Edit: Actually, it turns out (from information you've since provided) that you do not have a Wubi system. I'm not sure why holding down Shift doesn't work for you. Since the above advice applies whenever any boot loader besides GRUB chain-loads into the Ubuntu system's GRUB boot loader, it may work (or have worked) for you still. Otherwise, the problem could be that you are not holding down the Shift key early enough in the boot process, or that you are releasing it too soon.\n\n\n*It's possible that this is, somehow, a problem with the graphical login screen. So you might be able to log in successfully from a text-based virtual console. To attempt that, boot the Ubuntu system, then after the graphical login screen comes up (or, even when you're logged in graphically as guest), press Ctrl+Alt+F1. Enter your username and press Enter. Then put in your password and press Enter. (You won't see anything happening as you enter your password but that's normal.)\nIf you can log in to a virtual console, try changing your password by running the command passwd. If that doesn't work or you still can't log in graphically, try changing it by running the command sudo passwd $USER.\nCan Log In, But Other Authentication Fails\nThis section assumes that you now are able to log in as the user created during setup, using the graphical login screen. That is to say that you can use your Ubuntu system via graphical user interface, not just as guest, but also as the user created during setup. If I have misunderstood, please let me know.\nYou're able to log in now, but once you're logged in, you can't authenticate. There are three main types of authentication that are performed after logging in:\n\n\n*\n\n*Authentication to perform administrative tasks. You are asked for a password when you try to perform actions that cannot be accomplished by an ordinary, unprivileged user, like installing software or changing system files. For this, you use the same password as you use to log in. Such authentication will only succeed if you are an administrator on the system. I am assuming this is the kind of authentication that is currently failing. Please let me know if my assumption is incorrect.\n\n*Authentication to unlock the screen. You can manually lock the screen, or you can configure the screen saver to lock it. It may also be locked when resuming from sleep (suspend-to-RAM) or hibernation (suspend-to-disk). For this, you also use the same password as you use to log in.\n\n*Authentication to unlock your keyring. The keyring may be used to store passwords (for example, for Internet services) or other sensitive data. Your keyring password is not necessarily the same as the password you use to log in. Unlike your login password, my understanding is that the keyring password can be blank, without causing problems.\nThe things to check for problems authenticating while logged in (whether to perform administrative tasks, unlock the screen, or unlock the keyring) are largely the same as for being unable to log in: Points 1-4 under Password Doesn't Work On Login Screen apply (except that point 4 doesn't apply to keyring passwords).\nBut I'm guessing you've already considered that. So, let's focus on problems specific to logging in to perform administrative tasks. These are the things to check. (Please note that this is long because it provides some instructions for fixing the problem, under some circumstances. Actually checking these things, generally speaking, is not particularly difficult or time-consuming.)\nAre you actually an administrator?\nOpen a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run this command:\ngroups\n\nThat lists the groups your user account is a member of. To be an administrator, admin or sudo (or both) must be listed. Please note that adm is a different group from admin and doesn't make you an administrator (though you should also be a member of that group).\nIf you're not an administrator, you can make yourself one by following any procedure for resetting a lost password (typically you'd use recovery mode for this, but single user mode via editing GRUB boot options, or chrooting from a live CD/DVD/USB, will also work). Except instead of running the passwd username command, run these commands:\nusermod -a -G admin username\nusermod -a -G sudo username\nIt's fine if one (but not both) of those commands fails. (If it fails, you get an error message. If it succeeds, there's generally no output.) What that does is to put you into whichever of the admin or sudo groups exist (or both, if they both exist).\nAre only some ways of authenticating to perform administrative tasks broken?\nUbuntu actually provides two underlying mechanisms for administrators to authenticate to perform administrative tasks--sudo (which has graphical frontends such as gksu/gksudo and kdesudo), and PolicyKit.\nIn a Terminal window, run this command, to test PolicyKit:\npkexec echo Success.\n\nYou should be prompted for your password (probably by a graphical dialog box, but possibly in the Terminal window). If authentication succeeds and the word Success. is echoed back to you (i.e., printed in the Terminal), then PolicyKit works for performing administrative tasks (though it's possible it's still not working, for specific tasks).\nNow run this command:\nsudo echo Success.\n\nThis tests sudo in the same way (though the authentication will definitely be in the Terminal window--you won't get a graphical dialog box asking for your password).\nNow run this command, to see if sudo is working graphically (run this even if sudo didn't work above, in case the problem has to do with the way the Terminal accepts input):\ngksu xclock\n\nYou'll be prompted for your password. If that succeeds, a simple clock application will run. (You can quit the clock application.) If that fails, run this to see if the problem is that gksu is not configured properly:\ngksudo xclock\n\nIf this is a Kubuntu system, then you will probably not have the gksu and gksudo utilities, so test with the kdesudo utility instead:\nkdesudo xclock\n\nIf pkexec works but sudo and also gksu and gksudo (or kdesudo) don't work:\nEither sudo's configuration is broken, or sudo itself is broken. The former is more common, and easier to fix--I'll cover that here. (You'd know if sudo itself is broken because you'd get an error about how it refuses to run due to incorrect ownership/permissions, or an error saying command not found.)\nRun pkexec visudo to edit /etc/sudoers, sudo's main configuration file. Near the end of the file, you should see something like this:\n# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're running a version of Ubuntu earlier than 12.04, don't worry about the %sudo line.\n\n*If you're running Ubuntu 12.04 and later and you did not upgrade from a version of Ubuntu earlier than 12.04, don't worry about the %admin line (it might not even be present at all).\n\n\nThe %admin and/or %sudo lines (see above two bullet points) should be uncommented--that is, should not start with a # character.\nAfter %admin and/or %sudo, there should be a space, followed by ALL=(ALL) ALL or ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL.\nIf things are not as described above, you can edit the file to fix them. Since you're using the visudo utility to edit the file, it will catch syntax errors when you try to save the file. You should not attempt to override and save a file that it says has syntax errors. (sudo, and its graphical frontends, will refuse to work if the sudoers file contains even a single syntax error.)\nIf everything appears to be in order in your sudoers file, try reinstalling sudo. Assuming you haven't customized your sudoers file, reinstall sudo by running this command:\npkexec apt-get update\npkexec apt-get --purge --reinstall install sudo\n\nHowever, if you have customized your sudoers file (before this--I don't mean the editing described above) and it's important to you that you not lose the customizations, leave off the --purge flag:\npkexex apt-get update\npkexec apt-get --reinstall install sudo\n\nIf pkexec, sudo, and gksudo work, but gksu doesn't work:\nRun the command gksu-properties (this does not need to be run as root, i.e., don't run it with pkexec, sudo, or gksudo). Make sure Authentication mode is set to sudo and not su.\nSource: Password not working in Graphical Applications (gksu)? Works with sudo (Has a screenshot.)\nIf pkexec and sudo work, but gksu and gksudo (or kdesudo) don't work:\nTry reinstalling gksu/gksudo (they're provided by the same package):\npkexec apt-get update\npkexec apt-get --purge --reinstall install gksu\n\nOr if this is Kubuntu and it's kdesudo that's not working:\npkexec apt-get update\npkexec apt-get --purge --reinstall install kdesudo\n\nIf pkexec doesn't work, but sudo, gksu, and gksudo do work:\nTry reinstalling PolicyKit:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get --purge --reinstall install policykit-1 libpolkit-agent-1-0 libpolkit-backend-1-0 libpolkit-gobject-1-0\n\nIf pkexec works, and gksu and gksudo (or kdesudo) work, but sudo doesn't work:\npkexec usually authenticates graphically, like gksu/gksudo (or kdesudo on Kubuntu). So if graphical authentication is working for both PolicyKit and sudo-based methods, and console authentication is failing, there may be a problem with the way passwords are being entered into the Terminal. I've heard of this happening, but I'm not familiar with any concrete cases where it was known to occur and was then fixed. (Except where it was due to the user making a mistake entering the password in the Terminal.)\nIf this is happening, then to provide further information:\n\n\n*\n\n*See if sudo works in a virtual console (Ctrl+Alt+F1). This can help figure out if it's the graphical terminal application causing the problem.\n\n*See if pkexec works in a virtual console. When run in a virtual console, pkexec will not create a graphical dialog box. This can help figure out if the problem is also specific to sudo-based methods.\n\n*See if su $USER works, in both a Terminal window and in a virtual console. This command does not enable you to perform administrative tasks. It just authenticates as yourself. But it asks for a password (non-graphically) while doing so. This can help figure out the extent of the problem entering passwords to authenticate non-graphically.\n\n\nIf:\n\n\n*\n\n*the situation is different from all the combinations listed above, or\n\n*the situation is one of the combinations listed above, but there's a problem following the instructions, or\n\n*the situation is one of the combinations listed above and you've followed the instructions without apparent problems, but the underlying problem (of being unable to authenticate) has not gone away...\n\n\nThen please edit your question to provide details, and also comment here (with or without @Eliah--when you comment on my answer, I'm always notified) to let me know.\n\nA: I can see why this is terrible. First I want to troubleshoot with you. Check the following things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is my Caps Lock on?\n\n*Is my Num Lock on?\n\n*Could any of these things have been on during the installation, when you typed in the password.\n\n\nIf none of this doesn't work, you could try again to boot into Recovery Mode. Here is a good explanation on how to use this method to fix your problem.\nGood luck \n\nA: I'm not sure how long you've had this OS running, but if it's a new install why not just  Nuke and Pave ?  Reinstall your OS and you can have whatever password you want.\n\nA: In your gui login screen, on the top right corner close to network symbol, there is a square symbol with your current keyboard layout. Please select the correct layout for your keyboard, and then type your password. Hope that will solve your problem. After login remember to delete all other keyboard layout except the correct one from Text entry settings by clicking the same keyboard layout symbol on the top right corner. \n\nA: The \"encrypt home folder\" feature seems to be broken. Just don't check this option when installing and you should be fine.\n", "Q: How to Solve Wirelesss router issues vs. ISP issues So I've been having a lot of issues with my internet connection since installing 12.04.  This is happening on both of my laptops that run this version.  My mac has no issues although I did just notice one page that took a while to load.  Which brings me to the question.  What tools should I get and how would I go about testing whether the issue is at the wireless or the actual internet.  Is there something that could monitor and tell me if there are lapses in connection?  This whole time I've been assuming that my older laptop (2005) and my netbook are just not getting along with Ubuntu 12.04 but it would be nice to be able to actually test this rather than just assume...even though the mac is good 99% of the time...  Maybe the router is conflicting with Ubuntu?  Maybe the internet goes in and out?  Who knows...  Thanks!\n\nA: The easiest way to tell if it's your wireless network\\your laptop wireless interface or if it's your Internet connection is going to be the ping utility.\nHere's what you need to do\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the IP of the default gateway on your network:\n-Open up a terminal and type:\nip route show\n\nHere you're looking for an entry that looks like this:\ndefault via 192.168.1.1 dev wlan0  proto static\n\nThe \"192.168.1.1\" part is the IP of your default gateway (AKA your router).  Obviously your IP may differ.\n\n*Ping the IP of your gateway:\n-Back in the terminal type:  \n\"ping\" then the IP of your gateway.  For instance if your gateway IP was 192.168.1.1 you would type:\nping 192.168.1.1\n\nThe ping command simply sends an echo request and if everything is working right you should begin to see responses from the gateway that look like this:\n64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_req=3 ttl=64 time=1.35 ms\n\nOr you might see something like this which indicates dropped packets:\nFrom 192.168.1.113 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable\n\nLet that run for a minute or so to get a good sample size. You should see replies continue to scroll down the terminal until you hit CTRL + C to stop the ping.\n\n*Now we ping a random host on the Internet for comparison:\n-Open up a second terminal (File->Open Terminal) and follow the same procedure, this time using the command:\nping www.google.com\n\n\n*Now you have two samples that we need to compare:\n-Scroll through the replies in the first sample and look for dropped packets (see above) or very high latency (over 100ms in the \"time\" field).\nIf if you see a lot either of these issues in the first (default gateway) sample, you can reasonably assume that there's an issue either with your wireless network (or router) or with your laptop/wifi harware.\nIf the first sample looks fine but you see a bunch of issues with the second (Internet sample) then it reasonable to assume that the issue is with your connection to the Internet.\nTake several samples for longer lengths of time if you need to, that will only give you a better idea of what's going on.\nIf you think the issue might be with your laptop you should try from another computer and see if you get the same or different results.\nGood Luck!\n", "Q: How to setup midi input?

The output to lsusb looks the same for me as for you, so I don't think the problem is there.\nI'm using python with pygame to read in MIDI events. (if you are interested I could post some sample code, but you'd have to install pygame to use it)\nI am guessing the issue is somewhere in JACK or Rosegarden, though I don't use those so I can't help with them. Hopefully constraining the search to those components rather than Ubuntu itself is helpful.\n\nA: For what it's worth, I've never had any trouble using my MIDI drumkit in Ubuntu. I select the MIDI input in the application itself (hydrogen, whose configuration dialogue lets me choose my M-Audio Delta 1010LT as the MIDI source). In this set-up I don't think I've ever seen qjackctl report the card as a readable client, so I guess what you are seeing is normal. If the applications you are trying to route MIDI to let you configure the MIDI source within themselves, try using that.\n", "Q: How do I completely reset network settings? When I first installed Ubuntu, all networking worked perfectly. After messing with the settings every so often, it slowly became unusable. I would really like to know if there is a way to completely reset network settings without re-installing Ubuntu, DNS settings, proxy settings, everything. I'm running 12.04.\n\nA: It depends what sort of connection you have and whether you have had to manually tweak some settings for it, as sometimes you need to do in the case of a wireless connection.\nIf you have a wired connection and have simply been altering the settings with Network Manager, you can unplug your Ethernet cable, go into Network Manager and delete all the wired connections (eth0, autoethernet, etc) and then reboot. This has worked for me before. On restart, your wired network will be detected and automatically configured with DHCP to set up ip addresses and DNS settings. This assumes, however, you have a dynamic ip address: you will still have to specify some settings manually if not. \nIf you have manually altered any settings such as disabling DNSmasq or manually specifying nameservers by creating a fixed resolv.conf, or even changing firewall settings, then you will need to reverse these first and then remove your connections from network manager and reboot.\nIf none of these approaches are successful, you may need to login to your router and check the settings there.\n\nA: You can flush your iptables which firestarter has changed with \nsudo iptables -F\n\nSource: Post on Ubuntu forums\n\nA: Warning: I don't really know what this recovery option does and I tried to find some info on it but was unsuccessful.

That means it will ignore the USB because it found the bootable hard drive when it checked the boot devices in the order listed. You need to press F12 (or sometimes Escape) during the boot process to select the USB as the boot device. Sometimes a system will ignore F12 unless it is pressed at just the right stage of the boot process. If the happens, try several times, pressing F12 a little sooner each time.\n\nA: I recently purchased a new laptop and I had the same problem. I was trying to boot Backtrack 5 from my USB drive. The way I got it to work was I went to the BIOS and went under the \"Boot Override\" settings and chose my USB drive as a boot device. From there, Backtrack 5 Linux booted.\n\nA: If you have a new laptop with Windows 8 on it then the BIOS is probably a UEFI type.  You may have to set it back to legacy.\nAlso, Use pendrivelinux to create the USB flash drive.

I use Thinkpad x100e: AMD Athlon Neo X2 1.6 GHz, RAM 4GB (3.6 GB available).\nI installed 12.04 64-bit (with Windows installer) on 40GB of hard disk space. I have some problem about lag speed of the OS.\nCan anyone suggest me how to disable or turn off any feature to increase the speed performance of Ubuntu?\n\nA: I would install either Lubuntu or Xubuntu which use the resource light LXDE & XFCE desktop environments.  Also a full install will always run faster than Wubi.\n\nA: Check whether there are proprietary graphics drivers for your machine and if yes, install them. They are non-open-source but their performance is sometimes much better.\n\nA: I suppose you use Unity as Desktop Environgment of the main Ubuntu distribution. 4GB RAM should be more than enough even for Unity or KDE. Something is not right here. Anyway, install other DE like Xfce and KDE and see if there are differences.\n\nA: Trying out lighter Desktop Environments (LXDE, XFCE, etc.) is one way to go, and will probably yield the greatest noticeable difference in performance.\nIf, however, you are taken with Unity and want to stick with it, there are a few things you can do to speed things up a bit:\n1) Choose \"Unity 2D\" at login instead of \"Unity\", if you don't mind going without desktop effects.\n2) In Startup Applications, uncheck applications and processes that you don't need Ubuntu to automatically start for you at login (e.g. Bluetooth Manager if you don't have bluetooth, UbuntuOne if you don't use it, programs you simply don't use etc.) Before doing this, first make hidden startup applications visible in the manager:\nsudo sed -i ‘s/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g’ /etc/xdg/autostart/*.desktop\n\n3) Install Preload, which detects the applications and processes you most frequently use and loads the binaries and dependencies for those applications ahead of time so they load faster:\nsudo apt-get install preload\n\n4) Make sure to update frequently. From time to time, it is also useful to remove .deb files and applications/libraries that are no longer necessary:\nsudo apt-get autoclean\n\n", "Q: How do you mount an hd image made from ddrescue? Today I used ddrescue to make an image of a failed hd. I stored this image on a separate partition on my 500 Gb hd. The partition is sda8 and the filename is backup.img.\nThe image was of an hd that had Windows Vista installed on it. I don't care about the Windows OS on it at all. I simply want to be able to browse the data on it so I can retrieve it and store it elsewhere.\nHow do I mount this image?\n\nA: sudo mount Filesystem.img /home/user/MyFilesystem -o loop\n\nis what I used to solve this problem. Below is info from on the loop device from this answer on Linux Questions for those like me who don't/didn't know.\nOne  further possible type is a mount via the loop device. For example,\nthe command\n\nmount /tmp/disk.img /mnt -t vfat -o loop=/dev/loop \n\nwill set up the loop device /dev/loop3 to correspond to the file\n/tmp/disk.img, and then mount this device on /mnt.\nIf no explicit loop device is mentioned (but just an option -o loop'  is given), then mount` will try to find some unused loop device and use\nthat, for example\nmount /tmp/disk.img /mnt -o loop \n\nThe mount command automatically creates a loop device from a regular\nfile if a filesystem type is not specified or the filesystem is known\nfor libblkid, for example:\nmount /tmp/disk.img /mnt \n\nmount -t ext3 /tmp/disk.img /mnt \n\nThis type of mount knows about four options, namely loop, offset, size‐\nlimit and encryption, that are really options to  losetup(8). If the\nmount  requires  a  passphrase, you will be prompted for one unless you\nspecify a file descriptor to  read  from  instead  with  the  --pass-fd\noption. (These options  can be used in addition to those specific to\nthe filesystem type.)\n\nSince Linux 2.6.25 auto-destruction of  loop  devices is supported  and\nthen  any  loop device allocated by mount will be freed by umount inde‐\npendently on /etc/mtab.\nYou can also free a loop device by hand, using losetup -d' or  umount\n-d`.\n\nA: Use loop devices. Create a loop device upon that file and mount it as if it where a disk. Also, if the disk was partitioned, use the proper offset of the partition(s).\nhttp://wiki.edseek.com/guide:mount_loopback\n\nA: There is an answer here using Disk Image Mounter which has a GUI:\nHow to mount an ISO file?\nFYI I had a similar problem and realized it was already installed when I right clicked on the .img file (from a damaged CD).

While reading about bashrc, I ran into the following fundamental problem of terminal-only machines:\nIf I run malicious software with a restricted account, it could edit my \".bashrc\" file and set an alias to logout. The alias would point to the malicious executable and upon logout it would fake a login screen and obtain passwords to non-restricted accounts and possibly root.\nWhile the quick solution seems to be to set \"chattr +i .bashrc\" as root, making the file immutable for non-root users, I don't think this is sufficient.\nShells are very complex and there might be other ways of defining aliases which I do not know about.\nI thought about what the core of the issue is and to me it seems that terminal-only machines allow full control of the UI which is displayed to running software.\nSo one solution would be to wrap the terminal in a larger piece of UI which displays the current logged in user. This would take away some of the screen though.\nAnother solution would be a special reserved key on the keyboard which forces logout and cannot be re-defined by any aliases and cannot be monitored by any non-root software.\nIs there some software which provides this or a similar solution?\n\nA: Here is the solution\n\nA secure attention key (SAK) or secure attention sequence (SAS) is a special key or key combination to be pressed on a computer keyboard before a login screen which must, to the user, be completely trustworthy. The operating system kernel, which interacts directly with the hardware, is able to detect whether the secure attention key has been pressed. When this event is detected, the kernel starts the trusted login processing.\nThe secure attention key is designed to make login spoofing impossible, as the kernel will suspend any program, including those masquerading as the computer's login process, before starting a trustable login operation.\n\nOn Ubuntu 12.04, it is Alt+Print+K for me.\n", "Q: Lubuntu: After boot, Keyboard does not work So I boot up Lubuntu for the first time and it brings me to the setup screen with language selection and such.

Because I started with it just to do some tests, the VM was created just with 10 GB but grown fast, then I wanted resizing it. Of course, I was a fully noob... No backup before doing it.\nAfter some reading, I thought it would be so simple as:\nVBoxManage modifyhd MY_DISK.vdi --resize 81920\n\nUnfortunately, no boot:\nerror: unknown filesystem.\ngrub rescue>\n\nThen I tried many suggestions, including Boot-Repair as described here: grub rescue prompt after install installing Ubuntu in a dual boot.\nNothing has worked. It seens that my Linux partition isn't there anymore?!\nHere is the Pastebin with all the information collected by Boot-Repair.\nAnd the last try, the GParted Live CD can't also recover any data, saying that there isn't data on any partition. Well, I should just give up? Or some way to recover this disk?\n\nA: First, make a backup of the current disk. While it's not clear how resizing the disk would cause this, lets hope that it's a simple problem of the partition table being out of sync with where on disk your filesystems start and stop. If it's just the partition table being out of sync, then you can correct this via testdisk by following the tutorial at http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Step_By_Step (stop when you get to the ntfs boot sector recovery, since that's not the problem you're trying to solve).\n\nA: The maximum size of a Virtual-box .vdi disk is 30 GB you you tried to set it as 80 GB , i do not really know yet how to fix this, but my guess is that you have to find some way to reset the size of the virtual-box .vdi disk down to or below the max-size limit. \n", "Q: system strucking when brightness symboll came my system is strucking, when the brightness symboll came top off the screen on right side,   and it is blinking,then that time the system will struck....I am completely new to ubuntu,so please help me.\nThank You Sir.\n\nA: I've an athec lug netbook (\"a MSI clone\") and also have the blinking brightness problem after upgrading my Ubuntu 10.04 LTS to 12.04 LTS.\nHere you have a workaround that is working fine for me:\nsudo chmod u-w /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\nAnd then I can adjust the brightness by keyboard (Fn+...)\n", "Q: Linux kernel 3.0.0-15-generic problem help needed I'm new with all this Ubuntu and Linux programs so please bear with me.\nMy niece gave me her laptop she got from a tutor program and asked me to fix it since it didn't boot all the way.

I try to install perl on Ubuntu by apt-get install perl, but 5.10 is the latest version.\nHow can I deal with this? Or is there any code in 5.10 can replace the code feature 'unicode_strings';?\nThanks.\n\nA: I suggest that you should install two version of Perl side by side, because the default 5.10 is a critical part of the system itself, packages are depend on it, a big upgrade to it is not a good idea.\nIf you want to install Perl 5.16.1 from Larry, you could get the tarball from http://www.perl.org/get.html .

Some times errors happen, but one thing that can be solved is not using Windows applications for one which will always be a source of annoyance and extra work in my opinion.  I would go with something like shotwell which is the default for Ubuntu.\nIf you installed a bunch of desktop environments you will never have a clean system again.  You will need to reinstall.  I am sure you could eventually get everything cleaned up, but it would be a waste of your time.\nI'm not going to tell you which DE to use because that is asking for a flame war, but Ubuntu works well with what ever DE you use, but usually switching back and forth breaks keyrings and other application settings.\n", "Q: Mouse issue in Wine I'm trying to run a FPS game on wine called Vicinity but once the game starts, I can't move the mouse and when I go to the menu the mouse works (in the menu only).\nI searched but I didn't find a solution that works for me :(\nI have the same problem with another FPS game called OffensiveCombat.

I need to open another terminal from the command line. I know I can do this with  gnome-terminal but I want to run a command that always opens the default terminal so that my script can run on other distros, even the ones not using gnome.\nEDIT: I want a bash script that opens the terminal.\n\nA: According to the answer to this question How can I set default terminal used in Unity? I would script it as follows:\n eval \"$(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.default-applications.terminal exec)\"\n\nIf you would like to start a program inside the terminal, there is also the property 'exec-arg' which specifies the argument needed to execute something in the terminal by that specific terminal. For example when you want to execute a 'tail -f /var/log/messages':\nCMD='tail -f /var/log/messages'\neval \"$(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.default-applications.terminal exec) $(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.default-applications.terminal exec exec-arg) \\$CMD\"\n\nThe 'eval' is used because 'gsettings' returns the command and the argument in single-quotes.\nThis would then be a generic solution for all desktops running GNOME/Unity.\n\nA: xterm is available by default on almost all Linux distributions if I remember correctly. \nSo you could run a command in it, depending on the shell that the script's written in with something like this, (the example is for a bash shell script)\nxterm -e \"sh script.sh\"\n\nIt'll spawn a new shell window and execute your script.\n\nA: You might want to use either this key combination CTRL + SHIFT + T which opens another tab in the same terminal window, or you might want to use this one: CTRL + ALT + T which opens another terminal window (without closing the one you currently use.).\n", "Q: Can't mount two external hard drives at the same time This whole problem began a few months back when I tried to transfer data from my external hdd (formatted to NTFS) to a computer using Windows 7.

I have enabled wake-on-lan on both of the computers(on the NIC that I have connected to the lan of course, the NIC I took the MAC address from for each computer) but they wouldn't boot so I tried booting them manually, one of the two computers showed me a list of what I suppose they are images, the other didn't. On the computer that did show the list I choose on of the images and it continued booting, at some point it hung while waiting for network connection. Anyway I decided to remove the nodes from the MAAS server and try to recommission them using the installation usb/DVD but I found out I couldn't remove them from the dashboard because they were \"Commissioning\", I tried to find a way to stop them from commissioning but I couldn't so here I am, looking for help.\nActually, I just rechecked. The bios setting was Boot from lan not wake on lan, scratch that. Anyway, I booted them manually. The message is the same on one of the computers:\nBegin: Running /scripts/local-bottom ... done\ndone\nBegin: Running /scripts/init-bottom ... Success: root-ro successfully set up ro/tmpfs-rw layered root is using overlayfs\ndone\n[ 9.663259] r8169 0000:01:08.0: eth0: link down\n[ 9.663605] ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): eth0: link is not ready\nOk, more info. The second computer(the one that didn't show the list) is ready. I checked the boot order and set the network card first and it worked. It now shows up as \"ready\" on the dashboard and I can start it from there, I have no idea however how to log in to my node if I want to, I never set any users or passwords. :S\nThe other one now. If I choose local or maas-enlist on from the list, it starts a process similar to the installation of the ubuntu server(looks for a network link, tries to autoconfigure ipv6, successfully configures networking with DHCP) and then starts loading additional components. At some point it says Sending SiGTERM adn then Sending SIGkill to all processes and shuts down, if I restart it, the whole thing happens again. If I choose local, it tries to boot from the first hard drive which I suppose is what it should do, if I choose the i386 something option, the installation process starts regularly, if I wait, the same thing with maas-enlist happens.\nI forgot, if I choose the i386-commissioning option the eth0 thingy happens.\nNevermind, it wasn't solved. Here's the current situation:\nComputer 1: Everything ok, Shown as ready in the node list,shown as queued on the main page. Can't login on the node, don't know credentials.\nComputer 2: I installed maas-precise-i386, I can boot and it shows me \"maas-precise-i836 login:\" on the screen, Node shown as \"Commissioning\" in the node list, shown as offline on the main page.\n\nA: Computer 1: If you have added your SSH key to MAAS, it should be placed on Computer 1 when it starts up and you can do\nssh ubuntu@computer1\nComputer 2: you should use maas-enlist and then go to the UI to 'Accept and commission' the new node. After that, the commissioning process should start and then you should get in the same state than computer 1.\nAs for deletion of the nodes, it's not currently possible to do that when their state is \"commissioning\". We are looking at implementing a watchdog in the near future that will mark them as \"failed\" if they don't complete commissioning in time (see bug 981082), however I may also add a utility script to do this manually if you don't want to wait for the timeout.\n", "Q: Is disabling AppArmor to solve permission issues when deploying MaaS advisable? I'm still yet to successfully build a MAAS server, deploy nodes and charms with 12.04 LTS. In my latest troubleshooting in my logs, I have found several errors in my syslog pertaining to permissions issues with apparmor. Every time I would fix one, another would show up. I finally decided to disable apparmor with the following command:\nln -s /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.cobblerd /etc/apparmor.d/disable/\napparmor_parser -R /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.cobblerd\n\nDo you see any problems with doing this? After apparmor was disabled, I was able to successfully run sudo cobbler check and got a message back saying All systems go.\n\nA: While it would be OK to disable the apparmor profile for maas-provision, I'd highly discourage it. The profile handles the operations that are needed for MAAS within cobbler, and while you might see denials, it continues to work the way MAAS needs cobbler to.\nIn other words, these apparmor permission errors are irrelevant to what you are doing.\n", "Q: How to configue a DNS server statically?

I'm using wubi at the moment and my pc is really slow, is it worth deleting XP and formatting it to Ubuntu? Or (trying) to reset XP to factory settings?\nPS: I have over 40 GB HARD DRIVE and hate having xp on my computer...\nThanks,\nDJ Porter\n\nA: The difference between the different desktop environments (Unity, KDE, Xfce, LXDE) concerning the amount of resources used is very important, more important than that involved by an application or other. For example, with just 1 gb of RAM, Unity and KDE are not good options, almost beyond reach, while Xfce works decently, and lxde flies. If you have less than 1 GB of RAM, go with LXDE/Lubuntu. So, while you should try a dual boot, try first Xubuntu or Lubuntu in wubi.\n\nA: What are the specs of your computer? If you're new to linux, the best way to begin, is having a dual boot Ubuntu and Windows XP. \nAs the time passes, and you become more productive with Ubuntu, you could then remove Windows.\nIf you run Ubuntu and Windows on dual-boot, one OS won't interfer with the other, the only downside is disc space.\nSo i would say, dual boot Windows and Ubuntu, there's no need to remove Windows, unless you have litlle disc space.\nIf you dual-boot and still Ubuntu is slow, i recommend using a lighter distribution of Ubuntu like XUbuntu (Ubuntu with XFCE), or LUbuntu (Ubuntu with LXDE).\nIn the other hand, if you really like Unity, try running your current Ubuntu with Unity 2D or Gnome Fallback Session.\n\nA: You can run Ubuntu from a live CD or USB stick, without any need to install it to your hard drive first. Try it out and see!\n\nA: Installing Ubuntu on a seperate partition will speed up your machine, so it's definitely worth trying, but it won't make your computer super-fast. (The docs suggest that 500Mb of RAM is needed to run Ubuntu well, do you have that?) If you're not using XP then delete it, or reinstall it on a separate partition.\nEnsure you are running Unity 2D, and if it is still being slow try installing instead Xubuntu, Lubuntu (runs on LXDE) or Bodhi linux (runs on E17) - fastest is last, but all will give a significant speed improvement.\n", "Q: What is the minimum number of nodes for an Ubuntu Cloud?

Is it possible to use 2-3 nodes(+1 for the MAAS server)?\n\nA: Each time juju deploy is called it starts a new machine. Also, juju bootstrap reserves a machine to start up zookeeper.\nSo it looks like that example needs about 9 nodes.\nSince you don't have 10 machines, you could do the simple example here.\n\nA: You can use juju-jitsu to set the same in 6 machines.\nIn this case, glance and dashboard goes on same machine as keystone and rabbitmq-server goes along with mysql server. Thus you save 3 machines.\nArminder\n\nA: Actually, you might be able to get away with the MAAS server itself (1), add two nodes to that (2,3) and then lump up several services on the first actual node itself using the following syntax:\njuju deploy --to lxc:0 keystone\njuju deploy --to lxc:0 rabbitmq-server\njuju deploy --to lxc:0 nova-cloud-controller\njuju deploy --to lxc:0 openstack-dashboard\njuju deploy --to lxc:0 glance\njuju deploy --to lxc:0 juju-gui\njuju deploy --to lxc:0 cinder\n...etc...\njuju deploy --to lxc:1 nova-compute\n\nI'm assuming an install of Ubuntu, MAAS, JuJu and OpenStack.  You probably want to deploy ceph to there.  Depending upon the network situation you may want to add the neutron-related stuff.  Possibly you might want memcached.\nIf you look at the charms page for the openstack base you get an idea of what would be included by default:  https://jujucharms.com/openstack-base/36  If you use this openstack base charm, though, it will deploy to one service per node, methinks.  If you walk juju through its paces manually though and take advantage of the syntax I've described you can \"co-locate\" services on the same box.\nSee the following video:  Deploy openstack to two servers.  Be forgiving of the first ten minutes of the video as the author flounders a bit.

If they are too far out of sync, it makes OAuth fail which currently silently breaks the metadata access from the commissioning node, which makes it just sit at a login prompt instead of finishing the commissioning process and rebooting.\n\nA: Once you do juju bootstrap, you must reboot your nodes - they will install new software, and the necessary keys to stop this griping from ssh.\n", "Q: How can I add packages, repositories, and users to all nodes?

Is it by changing the .iso from MAAS server? Can I do that with Juju?\nHow to add users and groups to the nodes? How to change fstab on all nodes so it can use NFS?\nCan I also deploy a whole folder with a binary application?\n\nA: There is no easy way to do this via MAAS.\nMAAS's purpose is to prepare just a plain, freshly installed node for you to then customise further. It will place your SSH public key on the node so that you can access it... then it's yours to do with as you wish.\nMAAS is intentionally fairly lean. It was created mainly as a machine provider for Juju, but its API can be used by any application. (Juju does not get special treatment from MAAS. It's the other way round: we enhanced Juju to understand MAAS.)\n", "Q: Why are my MaaS nodes stuck at the commissioning stage? I'm attempting to set MAAS up on an older HP blade center. The nodes are stuck on commissioning. The nodes do PXE boot and seem to load ephemeral. They just never finish. \nAs a test, I tried installing the regular LTS server on one of the nodes. I received the message that \"Some of your hardware needs non-free firmware to operate\" In particular, it's calling for the tigon tg3 network driver firmware. \nCould it be that MAAS is stuck for the same reason? If so, how can I include or reference the tigon tg3 firmware in MAAS?\n\nA: \nThis answer is incomplete and unfinished\n\nI think that would explain the problem, yes. MAAS is stuck waiting for the nodes to boot up, perform some simple self-test tasks, and call back to the server. But if they get stuck, or have no network access, then there's no way for commissioning to complete.\n", "Q: I want to block usb access in ubuntu 11.10 , i have tried it by some codes given before but not working In my computer centre in my college ubuntu is installed for some projects purpose in order to keep safe from virus we would like to block pendrive access\n\nA: *\n\n*FS permission solution\nTo block:\nsudo chmod 700 /media\n\nTo unblock:\nsudo chmod 755 /media\n\n\n*BIOS option (If available)\nYou can also disable USB from system BIOS configuration option.

They need to run and boot at least once, during which time they signal to the maas server that they are ready.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I had started my nodes from the MAAS web GUI so they were running and showing allocated to root.

Note: I am not using maas-dhcp, as there is a DHCP server running on my current network. All nodes are in a \"commissioning\" state.

According to this https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/MAAS, under the heading \"Installation and initial set-up\"\n\nHow you install and run MAAS depends largely on whether you have control of the network you're using.\nIn this guide, we'll look at two common scenarios:\nYou own the network: you own the network you're connecting to and\n  you're happy to let MAAS own that network's DHCP. You're experimenting\n  while using someone else's network: you can't allow MAAS to own the\n  network's DHCP. We'll look at both of these ways to run MAAS.\n\nWell the \"You're experimenting while using someone else's network:\" is never explained. Is this not an option right now?\n\nA: To answer the booting question: You can't use Wake-on-LAN for virtual machines, you have to configure something else to start them up. MAAS supports \"virsh\" at the moment but I don't know if this works for Virtualbox.\nThe DHCP question: Yes you have to configure a DHCP server on your network because it tells the hardware how to PXE boot (simulated PXE on VMs). If you look at the files in /etc/cobbler you'll see templates for dhcp (for the isc and dnsmasq servers) which should give you a hint on how to set it up but basically the DHCP server needs to set the \"filename\" (which is the pxelinux.0 image) and the \"next-server\" which is the location of the TFTP server. next-server should be the same as your MAAS box.\nWhen commissioning is finished, the VMs will \"power off\" and they'll be marked \"ready\" in MAAS and you can then juju bootstrap which will allocate one node, start it up and install a new OS.\n", "Q: Set up different static IP addresses for different networks I'm relatively inexperienced with networking, but I know what I want to achieve in this case. I have a computer that I physically move between two separate local networks, but when the computer is on one of those networks I want to assign a different static IP address to the machine.\nOne internal network is 192.168.1.0, and the other is 192.168.2.0. Therefore, I want one static IP address to be 192.168.1.x and the other to be 192.168.2.x.\nIs there a way of assigning two static IPs, but with only one taking effect depending on the network its connected to? Can this be done purely in /etc/network/interfaces, for example?\nI may well have misunderstood the situation, so if there's a different way of achieving what I want then I'm happy to hear the solution.\n\nA: There may be better solutions (at least ones closer to what you're asking for) but here's what springs to my mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Configure the DHCP servers at each location to assign your MAC address a static IP, and on the laptop, just have it automatically grab the IP from DHCP. This is by far the easiest if you have router access at each place.\n\n*The next three are essentially the same solution as each other - split the connections up:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add and use a different network card for one location.\n\n*Leave USB network cards on the two ethernet cables (slower than native gigabit).\n\n*Use two wireless connections. Network Manager can do the hard stuff automatically so you just roam from one place to another.\n\n\n*Script something for when the interface comes up. I don't know what the event would really be called - but you essentially want to know when the cable is plugged in and the whole thing is ready to go. You could just have a static setup for one network and wait for when that comes up.\n\n\n*\n\n*Bind in using upstart if you know the connection is there on boot, or consider this Call script after connecting to a wireless network if you make the connection after boot.\n\n*When the network is up, do some service discovery. Is the gateway where you expect it? Are there other known servers you should be able to ping?\n\n*If everything is correct, leave the configuration as it is, otherwise switch to the alternative network configuration. You can either manually set this up using ifconfig or you can have two connections set up in Network Manager and just use nmcli to switch which one you're on.\nOut of the three, DHCP is the easiest.\n\nA: You should create a Virtual interface and assign an IP address to it.\nIf you want to configure more Static IP address you need to edit the \n\n/etc/network/interfaces\n\nand you need to enter the following lines replace eth0 with your network interface card.\nThe primary network interface\nauto eth0 \niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.2\ngateway 192.168.1.1\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 192.168.1.0\nbroadcast 192.168.1.255\n\nThe virtual network interface\nTo assign a second IP address to your  machine  you need to edit again  the /etc/network/interfaces file. The second IP is named eth0:0, the third one eth0:2 and so on...

As the subject says, Can I change the file-system  of a usb (or say any drive) from it's current partition like :- ext4 to a different partition like:- ext2/fat/ext3/ntfs file-system without loosing the data in the drive and without taking backup.\n\nA: From File system  Wiki \n\nOn Linux, ext2 can be converted to ext3 (and converted back), and ext3\n  can be converted to ext4 (but not back), and both ext3 and ext4\n  can be converted to btrfs, and converted back until the undo\n  information is deleted.These conversions are possible due to\n  using the same format for the file data itself, and relocating the\n  metadata into empty space, in some cases using sparse file support.\n\nSo it seems it is not Back-Convert-Compatible and Converting from ext4 to NTFS will require Formatting  , since they are totally different File-systems , also holds true for ext4 to Fatxx format .That means without data loss \next2 >> ext3 possible\next3 >>ext4 possible \next3 & ext4 >> btrfs possible\next4 >> ntfs not possible w/o Format\nntfs >> extX not possible w/o format \nPlease refer this question on superuser also.\n\nA: The simple answer is that it depends on which filesystem you are \"converting\" from & to. There needs to be a specific program to convert it for you.\nFor example, a FAT16 or FAT32 filesystem on Windows can be converted to NTFS via the Windows \"convert\" command. However, generally you cannot convert filesystems.\n1 other option that may work though:\nExt4 filesystems can often (but not always) be mounted as ext3 or ext2.\nSimilarly, Ext3 filesystems can often be mounted as ext2.\ne.g., on windows, I mount Ext3 & Ext4 filesystems using the ext2 driver ext2fsd: \n", "Q: How do I bind each of my server's NIC's to a separate IP? My question is \"How do I bind each of my server's NIC's to a separate IP?\"\nMy Ubuntu 12.04 server has two NIC's - both are attached to my home lan.\nThe NIC's have device names that were set in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules. I have called the lan0 and lan1. (see below for my 70-persistent-net.rules).\nEach NIC acquires correctly its IP settings via DHCP from my router. The assignment of IP is done based on the MAC of the dhcp request.  lan0 is assigned ip 172.23.80.1 whilst lan1 is assigned 172.23.80.2.

The problem is the default route. The output of route shows that default routing goes via the lan0 NIC. \nTo resolve your claim just remove the default route with ip route del default or route del default. \nHowever after that, you wont be able to route to outside your network. If you want to, then it's helpful to create two subnets for example 172.23.80.0 and 172.23.81.0 and route separately with via ip route 172.23.80.0/24 via 172.23.80.1 dev lan0 and ip route 172.23.81.0/24 via 172.23.81.1 dev lan1.

But I believe @chronospoon is correct about the deficiency of @bersch's answer, even though it looks almost there.\nAnyway, I search a bit and found LARTC (Linux Advanced Routing and Traffic Control). There is a howto on split access that looks like it explains exactly what you want. I'll quote:\n\nThe first is how to route answers to packets coming in over a\n  particular provider, say Provider 1, back out again over that same\n  provider.\nLet us first set some symbolical names. Let $IF1 be the name of the\n  first interface (if1 in the picture above) and $IF2 the name of the\n  second interface. Then let $IP1 be the IP address associated with $IF1\n  and $IP2 the IP address associated with $IF2. Next, let $P1 be the IP\n  address of the gateway at Provider 1, and $P2 the IP address of the\n  gateway at provider 2. Finally, let $P1_NET be the IP network $P1 is\n  in, and $P2_NET the IP network $P2 is in.\nOne creates two additional routing tables, say T1 and T2. These are\n  added in /etc/iproute2/rt_tables. Then you set up routing in these\n  tables as follows:\n\n  ip route add $P1_NET dev $IF1 src $IP1 table T1\n  ip route add default via $P1 table T1\n  ip route add $P2_NET dev $IF2 src $IP2 table T2\n  ip route add default via $P2 table T2\n\n\nNothing spectacular, just build a route to the gateway and build a\n  default route via that gateway, as you would do in the case of a\n  single upstream provider, but put the routes in a separate table per\n  provider. Note that the network route suffices, as it tells you how to\n  find any host in that network, which includes the gateway, as\n  specified above. Next you set up the main routing table. It is a good\n  idea to route things to the direct neighbour through the interface\n  connected to that neighbour. Note the `src' arguments, they make sure\n  the right outgoing IP address is chosen.\n\n    ip route add $P1_NET dev $IF1 src $IP1\n    ip route add $P2_NET dev $IF2 src $IP2\n\n\nThen, your preference for default route:\n\n    ip route add default via $P1\n\n\nNext, you set up the routing rules. These actually choose what routing\n  table to route with. You want to make sure that you route out a given\n  interface if you already have the corresponding source address:\n\n    ip rule add from $IP1 table T1\n    ip rule add from $IP2 table T2\n\n\nThis set of commands makes sure all answers to traffic coming in on a\n  particular interface get answered from that interface.\nWarning\nReader Rod Roark notes: 'If $P0_NET is the local network and $IF0 is its\n  interface, the following additional entries are desirable:\n\n    ip route add $P0_NET     dev $IF0 table T1\n    ip route add $P2_NET     dev $IF2 table T1\n    ip route add 127.0.0.0/8 dev lo   table T1\n    ip route add $P0_NET     dev $IF0 table T2\n    ip route add $P1_NET     dev $IF1 table T2\n    ip route add 127.0.0.0/8 dev lo   table T2\n\n\n'\n  Now, this is just the very basic setup. It will work for all processes\n  running on the router itself, and for the local network, if it is\n  masqueraded. If it is not, then you either have IP space from both\n  providers or you are going to want to masquerade to one of the two\n  providers. In both cases you will want to add rules selecting which\n  provider to route out from based on the IP address of the machine in\n  the local network.\n\n", "Q: Why does kworker cpu usage get so high? I recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my Samsung laptop alongside Windows 7. Whenever I use Ubuntu (even when its idle) kworker uses almost 90% of one of 8-cores.

I even tried installing another Linux distro (Linux Mint), and kworker caused the same problem. So I don't know what to do.

In all there are total 3 process that are in the running state two of them being kworker and gnome-system-mo (the first 2 processes in the top command screen short you added).\n\"kworker\" is a placeholder process for kernel worker threads, which perform most of the actual processing for the kernel, especially in cases where there are interrupts, timers, I/O, etc. These typically correspond to the vast majority of any allocated \"system\" time to running processes. It is not something that can be safely removed from the system in any way, and is completely unrelated to nepomuk or KDE (except in that these programs may make system calls, which may require the kernel to do something)\nFor more information about kworker please have look at the following link:- What's KWorker and it's importance\n\nA: I installed Linux Mint 17 yesterday and noticed this evening that kworker was consuming 100% of one of 4 cpus. I ran the above check, but did not find anything other than 0 for the interrupts. \nWhile examining the services that I normally have running, I noticed that shutting down the nfs server dropped the kworker thread back to zilch. A restart of the nfs server did not fix the issue. \nI found this bug report (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1322407), which indicates that a similar nfs server problem was fixed in kernel 3.13.0-32.57.  The latest update on Mint 17 appears to be running kernel 3.13.0-24-generic, so I don't have the fix in the kernel that I am running.  I don't know if this will help anyone else but I systematically went to each nfs client machine and did a 'umount -a -t nfs' and waited to see if it had any effect. I found the client that seemed to have been causing the issue as the kworker dropped to nothing after I unmounted. I remounted the nfs shares on the client 'mount -a -t nfs' and the problem did not return.\n", "Q: i686 CPU detected when trying to install an from an X86-64 Live CD Ok so when I put the live CDs in my pc it boots then displays ' this kernel required an X86-64 CPU, but only detected a i686 CPU.

Or is there any code in 5.10 can replace the code feature 'unicode_strings';?\nThanks.\n\nA: Anyway you can easily download last Perl distribution (5.16 or 5.14) and install it: \n1. Install Perl\nwget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/R/RJ/RJBS/perl-5.16.0.tar.gz\ntar -xzf perl-5.16.0.tar.gz\ncd perl-5.16.0\n./Configure -des -Dprefix=$HOME/usr/local\nmake\nmake test\nsudo make install\n\nthen add:\nexport PATH=$HOME/usr/local/bin/:$PATH\n\nas result you will get:\n $ perl -v \n $ perl 5.16\n\nOld perl version is still locate here: /usr/bin/perl\nnew Perl version will be there: /usr/local/bin/perl\n2. Work with CPAN modules\nI suggest you install cpanminus (cpanm) for easy manage CPAN modules for new version of Perl.\nwget http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/M/MI/MIYAGAWA/App-cpanminus-1.5017.tar.gz\ntar -xzf App-cpanminus-1.5017.tar.gz\ncd App-cpanminus-1.5017\nperl Make.pl\nmake\nmake test\nsudo make install\n\nAfter that you can install CPAN modules for your new version of Perl.\n\nA: When writing your own applications, I recommend installing your own Perl. This was once a major pain, but no more. Nowadays, you can use perlbrew to build Perl for you.\nOn Ubuntu, I think you'll need the build-essential package first, if you don't already. After that, you can use the instructions on the perlbrew docs linked above to install it (or use cpan App::perlbrew).\nOnce installed you can run:\nperlbrew init\nperlbrew install perl-5.12.2\nperlbrew switch perl-5.12.2\n\nOnce you do that and make sure Perlbrew's bashrc is loaded into your bashrc, you should be ale to run:\nperl -v\n\nand see that you're running 5.12.\n\nThe official perlbrew website is https://perlbrew.pl and it suggests installing by running\nwget --no-check-certificate -O - http://install.perlbrew.pl | bash\n\nThen you will still need to \nperlbrew install perl-5.12.2\nperlbrew switch perl-5.12.2\n\nof course. Finally if you have multiple cores (and who doesn't these days) you can run\nperlbrew install -j N perl-5.12.2\n\nwhere N is the number of jobs requested, often the number of cores you have plus one. I use -j 5 on my quad-core and -j 3 on my dual-core netbook.\n\nA: you may consider downloading .deb package and installing it from dpkg.\nthe command for a .deb package:\ndpkg -i my.deb\n\nyou may find the deb file for perl 5.12 in here https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/perl/5.12.3-6ubuntu4/+build/2483691\nnamed: perl_5.12.3-6ubuntu4_i386.deb (3.4 MiB)\nit will probably want another package and another one want another one..... recursively :)\nbut it's always possible to install like this.\n", "Q: Cannot see the Grub screen/Ubuntu login after installing Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 on Asus U47A Laptop I have an Asus U47A Laptop with no discrete graphics. UEFI is disabled in the BIOS. I had Windows 7 installed by default. So, I installed Ubuntu 12.04 by creating a separate 300GB partition. During the installation, it asked me where to install the bootloader. \nSo, I installed the bootloader on /dev/sda option which selects my entire hard disk I guess. I was also asked to create a separate 1MB BIOS Grub partition before proceeding but I choose to ignore it cause I had the UEFI boot disabled. Now, after installation, the system just loads Windows 7. \nI cannot see the Ubuntu grub/login screen. So, I went to the BIOS and saw that under boot options, it is still set to Windows bootloader option. So, what do I do now? Should I change the boot entry in the BIOS? If so, then to what (Windows recognizes the new Linux partition as 'D' Drive)? \nI don't want to remove Windows but dual boot. Any help would be really appreciated.\nOutput of sudo fdisk -l:\nWARNING: GPT (GUID Partition Table) detected on '/dev/sda'! \nThe util fdisk doesn't support GPT.

The Asus BIOS supported both the legacy boot and UEFI boot. So, the aim was to install both Ubuntu and WIndows in the same boot mode. There are instructions to install Ubuntu in UEFI mode but I was not feeling confident to take that approach. So, I took the latter one and dual booted Windows and Ubuntu in legacy mode.\nWarning: You will format your entire computer. So, make sure to make the back up discs and take the necessary back up. If GPT partitioning or UEFI boot is important to you, then this method is not for you!\nSteps:-\n1. Go into BIOS and disable UEFI. Save settings and restart and go into BIOS again.\n\n\n*\n\n*If somewhere there is a setting to delete boot options then delete all the boot options.  Else skip this step. Even though I am pretty sure that you cannot delete CD/DVD from boot option but if you can then don’t do it. Save all settings and restart and go into BIOS again.\n\n*Put your windows DVD in the optical drive.\n\n*Somewhere (mostly on the last tab of your BIOS if it’s an Asus laptop) you will find an option for boot override. Select your DVD drive and press enter. Remember that this boot over ride option should NOT contain UEFI in it’s name.\n\n*You will now boot from windows DVD non-UEFI mode.\n\n*During windows installation select “custom install” and then delete all existing partitions on your harddisk. Create partition for windows. When creating this partition windows will automatically make another small partition of about 100MB size as system reserved. Leave the rest of the unallocated space for now. We will take care of that space while installing Ubuntu. Install windows now. \n\n*Now even after deleting all the partitions , there will be still some GPT data left on the hard drive. As, long as you don't remove it, Ubuntu won't recognize your windows installation. So use a utility called 'fixparts' and delete all the GPT data.\n\n*Once that is done put your Ubuntu CD in the drive and boot from it again.\n\n*During installation of Ubuntu select the option “do something else” and create a primary partition for Ubuntu.\n\n*Now after creating partition for Ubuntu click on the rest of the unallocated space and click on create new partition again. But this time selected extended partition.\n\n*Once you create extended partition you should be able to see all your unallocated space in a sub menu under this newly created extended partition. In this unallocated space you make rest of your partitions like linux-swap (necessary for linux to work efficiently and for hibernate to work correctly) and other partitions for your data.\n\n*Make sure that the bootloader device is sda without any partition number after it.\n\n*Proceed with installation. If everything goes well you should be able to dual boot to both Ubuntu and Windows.\nNote:-\nFor hibernation/trackpad/other issues , I suggest running Kernel 3.5 or above as it includes a lot of fixes. Also, intel rc6 graphics power saving option was disabled by default for me. So, enabling it boosted battery life by 2 hours!!\nI hope this helps someone.\nBig thanks to Bhaismachine and Rod smith for their help!!\n", "Q: apt-get update constantly gives out error Lately whenever I run \nsudo apt-get update\n\nit gives me the following error after the 'reading database' step\nW: Duplicate sources.list entry http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/ precise/partner amd64 Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/archive.canonical.com_ubuntu_dists_precise_partner_binary-amd64_Packages)\nW: Duplicate sources.list entry http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/ precise/partner i386 Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/archive.canonical.com_ubuntu_dists_precise_partner_binary-i386_Packages)\nW: You may want to run apt-get update to correct these problems\n\nWell I have run apt-get update over and over again and nothing changed.\nI also tried the options\nsudo apt-get update --fix-missing\n\nand\nsudo apt-get update -f\n\nwhich are really the same thing I know, but nothing seems to help.\n\nA: You seem to have both 32 and 64 bit repositories enabled and so you have two incompatible sources available.

I have a big music collection on my Desktop-PC and it's hooked to a couple speakers. I want to make the music play through those speakers, but control the player from my laptop....\nIt's hard to explain because I'm not a native speaker, but I'll try to clarify with an example:\nI'm laying in my bed with my laptop. I choose the song I want to listen and it starts playing through my desktop's speakers, I can add songs to it's library with my laptop and so on, I hope this is better explained!\n\nA: Using a special music player\nThe most versatile of the music players might be the music player daemon. Your desktop will run the daemon. There are many clients available to remote control it. It is not the only option as far as remote control players go. Rhythmweb is another option but many more exist.\nUsing Pulseaudio\nPulseaudio is an abstraction layer giving programs access to your sound hardware. You can configure your Desktop as a \"sink\" for audio and your laptop as a \"source. Then you will be able to stream all the sound from your laptop to your desktop on a very low level. See chronitis' answer and tutorial link for more information.\nUsing ssh\nProbably the easiest and way if you already know ssh is this one:\nAssuming your Laptop has an ssh client with X11 capabilities (installed by default on Ubuntu or MobaXTerm and many others on Windows) and your Desktop-PC is running Ubuntu.\n\n*\n\n*Install ssh-server  / sudo apt-get install openssh-server on your desktop PC.\n\n\n*Make sure that the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config on your Desktop-PC has a line that says\nPasswordAuthentication yes*\n\n\n*Use the command (ssh -CX user@desktop-PC NameOfYourMusicPlayer) on your laptop to start the music player of your Desktop-PC (it will run on your laptop but play sound on your desktop's speakers).\n\n\n*Enter your password on your Desktop-PC and wait for the player to load.\nSubstitute \"user\" for your username on your Desktop-PC, \"desktop-PC\" with the IP or hostname of your Desktop-PC and \"NameOfYourMusicPlayer\" with the name of your Desktop-PC's music player (e.g. Amarok, Banshee or Rhythmbox)\nAll music you want to play has to be present on your Desktop-PC. You cannot play music files located on your laptop. What you can do is move music files from you laptop to your desktop over network using scp or nautilus.\n\nWarning: PasswordAutentication for ssh is a potential security risk. If your password is weak and your Router forwards the standard ssh-port (22) or if many people have access to the network your Desktop-PC and laptop are connected that might be a security risk and you should use another authentication method (see the ssh-tutorial for more information).*\n\n\nA: There are two different approaches here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Music player runs on your desktop and is controlled remotely.\n\n*Music player runs on your laptop but sends sound output over the network to your desktop.\n\n\nFor 1), see eg rhythmweb for Rhythmbox. (I have not tested it, but it appears to be a plugin that serves a web page containing player controls which you can then connect to from your laptop.\nFor 2), the pulseaudio sound mechanism used in Ubuntu includes this capability (although documentation for remote use seems a bit thin on the ground.

These are only affected if you use the chown -R command to change ownership (R)ecursively. All you did was change the ownership of /mnt/my-address, not any of its contents.\nstat /mnt/my-address gives you information on the actual directory/mountpoint /mnt/my-address though, whose ownership you did change.

If I have music on pause, it won't even open the voicemail clip, it just starts playing the paused music. \nI'm looking for a second player that loads fast to play these voicemails.  No other features are necessary. I'm guessing there may be an issue with the temporary file location.   \n\nA: A simple little audio player called decibel is a python program that is incredibly fast and powerful. You do not need to import all your mp3s or other tracks before you can play them. With the full view selected from the view menu, it gives you a directory tree in the the sidebar (see the screenshot). You can expand the folder you want and either select that entire folder or just one or two tracks and then drag and drop into the main window pain (again see the screenshot). By default it is set to show just the home folder in the sidebar, but that can be changed: on the menu, go to edit > preferences > explorer and double click on file explorer. \nIf you go to edit > preferences there are a number of useful plugins that you can enable and you can also switch on some desktop integration features. There is also an equalizer available as well which has various presets. Again, you can keep it as a minimal player or use these other features; it is very configurable.\nIt is available in the repositories and more information can be found at the official site. Compared to certain other music players, which tend to be somewhat sluggish, decibel is great and loads in seconds.\nIf you open Thunderbird and go to edit > preferences > attachments you can set decibel as the default program to open mp3 attachments.\n\n\nA: This should help you decide. \nFast Lightweight music players.\n\nA: You should consider a CLI mp3 player like mpg123 or mplayer or do you need a GUI?\n\nA: You can play almost any music file from the command line or a script using mpg321.

Could someone explain with a practical example?\n\nA: RAID is simply put a way to make two or more disks act as one - with some benefits:\nRAID 0 is making the disks act as one physical disk. this means that the controller can split the files over both disks when writing and reading, which can improve the performance quite a bit. This also means that if one of your disks fail, the data on both of them are likely lost.\nRAID 1 is mirroring; you need two identical disks, and you only get the space of one (two 1TB disks in RAID 1 only gives a 1 TB disk). The benefit here is that this enables the system to read from two different disks at the same time, even though write times might suffer a bit. Another benefit might be that if one disk fails, the data is mirrored on the other disk, but it is not completely without risks (see wikipedia)\nHigher raid levels are possible, but you should read about them on wikipedia.\n\nA: RAID 1 arrays allow your system to be more tolerant of physical failures on hard disks.\nExample: You have a two disks in your system set up in a RAID 1 array.  These two disks appear as one volume to the operating system and all the data written to the volume get written to both disks in the array.  This way if one disk fails, you still have an exact copy on the second disk.\nThere are also other types of RAID arrays.\nThis article from Wikipedia has pretty much all you need to know.\n\nA: RAID stands for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks. The expansion itself contains the word \"Redundant\" which should make it clear that it is something (yeah, you guessed it right) redundant. But in the world where we strive for the most efficient structures, why would we need such redundancy?\nThe answer is \"fault tolerance\". Basically, RAID is a configuration which allows you to restore your data if one of the disks fail. This means you need to have more than one disks. Here comes the word \"Inexpensive\". You can have multiple disks only if they are inexpensive; if the disks were the price of diamonds, you wouldn't want to have any redundancy (unless you store very very important data). \nNow, you can have several RAID configurations from RAID0 to RAID6. RAID0 is the configuration we normally use, it has no fault tolerance. The data is only stored once, like we see in most end-user configurations. Then why is it a part of RAID? Well, it's just like that. \nFor more information you can head over to Wikipedia or search the Web. There is pretty much everything out there. \n\nA: Other answers have spelled out the practical aspects of RAID. I'll address the system administration view. Fault tolerance isn't free, I see many many users get into software RAID because it's convenient only to lose all their data due to incorrect setup or failing to understand how the RAID works when it actually suffers an event which requires your attention.\nYes, RAID done and maintained correctly will insure your data against loss and may even increase performance, done incorrectly, the probably of catastrophic failure actually goes up as you simply have more variables to manage, more drives to go bad; get it wrong and you might find yourself without the data you worked overtime to insure.\nIf you're going to get into RAID, understand and practice it's deployment and fault resolution. Again software RAID is neat and reliable, but it's not any less complex than a HW RAID. In fact it's increased flexibility gets a lot of novice users into trouble.\nIf you bought a shiny new HW RAID array or SAN you would probably read the directions and understand how it works before you pressed it into service. Treat software RAID with the same level of consideration and it will serve you well.\nBefore you do anything, begin with a solid backup strategy (like rsync), fault tolerance is no substitute for a reliable, automated backup.\n\nA: First of all RAID is not a substitute for a good backup strategy.\nThere are basically two concepts one uses distributed copies (RIAD 1 - also called mirroring, data is organized in blocks and every drive contains the same blocks) and another striping (RAID 0 - mostly done at block level with block level striping).\nOne advantage of mirroring mode (two or more drives holding the same data) would be, that you can easily get snapshots and backups from the system by just removing the drive from the system and archiving that drive. This seems like a poor mans backup and snapshot strategy since there are more sophisticated mechanisms available nowadays but that's still a nice example for using redundancy.\nAnother benefit of mirroring is that you can execute as many read operations as you have drives in the array at the same time. Linux software RAID has that capability, but for writing every drive has to write the same data.\nWith striping data is organized in stripes that cover two or more drives, so that workload can be distributed across multiple drives. The array is faster but offers no redundancy.\nTo have the benefit of both modes one can use combined modes such as RAID 10, which uses distributed copies of striped blocks. But this comes at the expense of using even more drives to store the same amount of data.\nRAID 5 uses only striping but manages to keep redundancy by calculating parity data. It has different characteristics than RAID 10 and it's not always clear which mode serves a task better, sometimes it's RAID 5 and sometimes it's RAID 10.\nThough on personal experience we had a failed RAID 5 array at work in a customers machine because somehow errors got into the parity data and the only way out was to set up a new array. Of course the colleagues ignored the advice from the qualifier at that time and just replaced one drive, but a month later the array was dead and lost.\nApart from Wikipedia I would recommend reading the Linux RAID Wiki as well as the manpages of mdadm and md.\n\nA: As an example of how it works in practice, a configuration I have regularly used in production servers is to have the RAID controller in a system configured with 2 arrays. The first has 2 identical disks connected and is configured as RAID1, i.e. mirrored. The 2nd has at least 3 disks (4 seems to be common) as is configured as a RAID5 array, i.e. distributed data with a parity check.\nWhen the operating system is installed, the RAID1 array, which to the system appears to be a single disk the size of one of the drives, is used for the root partition, /etc, /usr, /var and swap, i.e. all the system stuff and the RAID5 array is used for /home, i.e. all the user data. The RAID5 array's size appears to be (n-1) times the size of a single disk (i.e. for 4 drives, the system sees a single 'disk' with a size of 3 times the size of a single drive).\nIn operation, the system sees 2 'disks'. If a drive fails, the RAID hardware simply stops using it and, usually, it can be replaced without stopping the server (hot-swapped), so the users are not affected by the fault.\nThe main reason for mirroring the system array is simply to get a slight performance boost and provide the ability to do 'tricks' like rapidly cloning a system by putting one mirror disk into a different server. In the past, I have also run systems where all the drives were configured as a single RAID5 array appearing to the operating system as a single big disk.\nSoftware RAID works in the same way, but since the hardware doesn't usually allow for hot-swapping, the system usually needs to be shut down to replace a drive. Hence software RAID, while easier to set up, is actually harder to manage.\nAnd you still need to have a good backup straegy in case 2 drives fail at once or the RAID controller itself fails!\n", "Q: updates/applications to all VirtualBox's OS's Consider i have 3 VirtualBox installed Ubuntu OS's .

Basically I find myself using the symbols on the numbers much more often than the numbers themselves. I have the numpad for the numbers. And a lot of these symbols are used in coding and latex. So if anybody knows how I can get !@#$%^&*() without the use of shift I would be greatly thankful. \n\nA: This is actually pretty easy to achieve using xmodmap. Simply make a new file, with the following:\nkeycode  10 = exclam 1 exclam 1\nkeycode  11 = at 2 at 2\nkeycode  12 = numbersign 3 numbersign 3\nkeycode  13 = dollar 4 dollar 4\nkeycode  14 = percent 5 percent 5\nkeycode  15 = asciicircum 6 asciicircum 6\nkeycode  16 = ampersand 7 ampersand 7\nkeycode  17 = asterisk 8 asterisk 8\nkeycode  18 = parenleft 9 parenleft 9\nkeycode  19 = parenright 0 parenright 0\n\nSave it in the root of your home directory as .Xmodmap (capitalization is important). Now, just log off and back in (you may have to reboot), and your keys will be swapped. Keep reading for how I came up with this. The information I used to figure this out came from here. Fire up a terminal and type the following command:\nxmodmap -pke\n\nThis will spit out a bunch of keycode setting/value pairs, like this:\n......\nkeycode  27 = r R r R\nkeycode  28 = t T t T\nkeycode  29 = y Y y Y\nkeycode  30 = u U u U\nkeycode  31 = i I i I\nkeycode  32 = o O o O\nkeycode  33 = p P p P\nkeycode  34 = bracketleft braceleft bracketleft braceleft\nkeycode  35 = bracketright braceright bracketright braceright\nkeycode  36 = Return NoSymbol Return\nkeycode  37 = Control_L NoSymbol Control_L\nkeycode  38 = a A a A\nkeycode  39 = s S s S\nkeycode  40 = d D d D\nkeycode  41 = f F f F\nkeycode  42 = g G g G\nkeycode  43 = h H h H\nkeycode  44 = j J j J\nkeycode  45 = k K k K\n......\n\nThe keycode is the key on your physical keyboard, and the value on the right of the equals sign is what gets sent to your PC. The reason there are four is the first is plain, the second one is with shift pressed, and the third (plain) and forth (shift) seem to be enabled once you click the Scroll Lock button. As you can see, this give you a lot of flexibility to do whatever you can dream up to modify your keyboard.\nNow, this will only work when you are logged in to X (as in the GUI), hence the name. If you fire up a terminal in Gnome, Unity, etc. you are still good using Xmodmap, but if you want the same functionality in the console (i.e. after pressing CTRL+ALT+1, sshing into a box, working on a server, or a PC with no GUI) you will need to use loadkeys. Although the general idea is the same, loadkeys offers much more functionality and granularity, so it is slightly more complicated. Now, these commands all MUST be done from the actual console, they can not be done with a terminal emulator, or you will receive an error, like this: Couldn't get a file descriptor referring to the console.\nFirst we will need to create our default keymap, like this:\ndumpkeys > ~/my_keymap.map\n\nIt would be a good idea to make a copy of this in case you really mess it up.

If you messed up, you can just use the loadkeys command to fall back to the default. To make it permanent, you can add the command to the end of your ~/.bashrc file. \n", "Q: Cannot install Ubuntu on HP Pavilion p6120t - installer complains of insufficient space and GParted says \"no devices found\" I have a HP Pavilion p6120t desktop and I recently wiped its hard drive using my Macbook's disk utility.\nI was unable to install Ubuntu on it because I apparently don't have 4.4GB of space available.

All is well it says that it's connected and running but when i scan with my android phone ican't find my hostpot.Also,my laptop dose not see Any wifi networks, event tough my phone can see several in the area.\n\nA: Wifi hotspot isn't same as wireless ad hoc networks. Most android device doesn't support wi-fi in adhoc mode. What you are running is simply an ad hoc network.  \nFor running your laptop as an access point, this is only possible if your wireless adapter supports going into the master mode. or if the driver for wireless is a mac80211 based driver. If it does not support either one, you're totally out of luck.\nIts very tough to setup even if it supports. First you need to setup wireless card and then set up a dhcp server (to get dhcp server up and running is really a horrible task)\nHow to test master mode and configure access point\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/MasterMode\nHelpful threads to setup wireless access point\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessAccessPoint\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=376283\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1663788\n", "Q: Difference between the results of the top command and System-Monitor,Why? Why is there a huge difference between the outputs' of top command and the system monitor when both programs were run at the same time. Please find attached is the screen shot showing the huge difference:-\n\nIs this a bug?\n\nA: If you are referring to RAM usage, it is because system monitor does not include buffers and caching, just actual Ram used to run applications, top is slightly confusing because it does not obviously show disk usage after buffers / caching. Try using the following command : \nfree -m\n\nSee the image below, and note that the second line of free -m indicates available Ram, whilst the first line indicates actual Ram usage including disk caching.   \n \nI would recommend installing and using htop as it is better and simpler than top in my opinion.   \n", "Q: Cron service up but apparently not working I'm trying cron in a Ubuntu VPS with a minimal install, so I had to run apt-get install cron.

But this may be affecting the behavior of the system after all...\n\nA: It's good practice to list the full path for anything being called from a cron job, since the environment variables are not always the same as they are for your user.  Additionally, since you are trying to debug things, try writing to the /tmp/ directory instead.   Try the following line:\n* * * * * /bin/date >> /tmp/datelog\n\n", "Q: How to find the executable file of an app if 'whereis' is not showing it? This basically to do with cuttlefish(The app from showdown) in this case.\nI cant find the location of the executable file for it.\nThe command whereis did not give any results!\nI want to add it to my start up applications and thus i need the path!\nP.S: the preferences of the app are not showing up and ticking against the start automatically thing when the settings for the 1st time showed up is not working!.\nSo i need to find out the executable/bin file...\nHow do i do this?\n\nA: You can use apt-file search <package-name> or dpkg -S <package-name>, where <package-name> is the package you want to search.\nNote that these commands will output many results. To find the required package use grep:\napt-file search package | grep -E \"(bin/)?package$\"\nOR\ndpkg -S package | grep -E \"(bin/)?package$\"\nThis searches the lines whose last word is package and may or may not be preceded by bin/, for example it will result both /usr/bin/package and /usr/anydirectory/package.\n\nA: Another quick way to find executable programs is to use locate, which will only show those programs present on your computer. It relies on a database that is automatically updated by cron every day. (Use sudo updatedb to refresh it manually if you have just installed some programs and cannot find them when using locate.) \nIf, for example, you wanted to find where the dosbox executable is, simply type:\nlocate dosbox | grep bin\n\nWhich returns,\n/usr/bin/dosbox\n\nApart from using whereis, this is the quickest way to find executables. It can also be used to find readme documents extremely quickly by substituting bin for README.\nLocate is a very useful program and you can even use regex with it if you want to conduct more complex searches. See man locate for more details.\n\nA: Some other commands which (similar to the whereis) can tell you where the executable is (all of them detailed in answers to this question) are summarized here:\n\n\n*\n\n*type: type <name> (shell builtin)\n\n*command: command -v <name> (shell builtin)\n\n*find\n", "Q: Help rebuilding raid1 array?

It forbids others from using the mark or a similar brand in a related area of commerce (like Age of Empires brand computers), as well as in unrelated areas in a way that could \"dilute\" the value of the mark (e.g. Age of Empires brand flush toilets).\nSo, you should not call your game \"Age of Empires\" or something similar, and you should make clear that it is a 3rd-party product not made by, endorsed by, or affiliated with the owners of the mark (I think Microsoft). However, it is fine to mention Age of Empires, e.g. to say your game is similar to or inspired by Age of Empires, since that would be a purely factual statement.\n(Of course to be sure what you want is legal, consult a lawyer.)\n\nA: You can't copy it to be open-source. Even if the source were leaked, that is illegal. You can, however, follow in the footsteps of FreeCiv or Doom3. FreeCiv is based on Civilization, and is an open-source version. Doom3 is also open-source but requires the use of official game data for full operation or you must provide your own assets for models. Either way the engine is free, open source, and available to all.  FreeCiv includes no game data since both the original and FreeCiv generate maps dynamically. The requirements to release your version are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Any patents related to the original must have expired. You can use a patent search such as Google Patent Search. Simply type your query as if it were a regular Google search, and under one or two web results, patents will be shown.\n\n*The program you are writing does not use strong cryptography that is restricted by the US government.(Or if it were downloaded in some countries, you could be considered an arms dealer) You may also register with the US Bureau of Industry and Security, which is a part of the US Department of Commerce, although the legal paperwork may be very difficult to file without professional legal counsel. Also see the BIS FAQ on encryption.\n\n*Your version does not use images or other files (such as sound files) from the original version.\n\n*Your version includes some (at least minor) changes.\n\n*You did not use, directly, or as an idea on how to write your version, any of the source of the original if it had been leaked.\n\n*You do not utilize the source's trademarks.\nDo note that you have to code it, package it, and put it in a PPA or the repositories. This may be very difficult. There is no way to just copy-paste some magic from the old version. Please read the disclaimer below prior to doing anything to make your version, and for more guidance about the actual stages of coding, visit Game Development and Stack Overflow.\n\nLegal disclaimer: This is not meant to be legal advice.

Laws and regulations in your area may differ so check with a lawyer or local authorities.\n\n\nA: Age of Empires II can usually be run on Ubuntu and other GNU/Linux systems without too many problems, using Wine.\nDisclosure: I am not a lawyer.\nAs for the general question, if your goal is to create free open-source software that facilitates playing a proprietary game, and you have programming skills, typically there is no legal impediment to writing a replacement game engine. (You may potentially fall afoul of software patents, but no more so than in any other major programming project to produce software for performing tasks that existing software already performs.) If you do this, then someone can install your engine, and then, if they have the artistic data (maps, \"worlds\", sounds, and so forth) from the game, they can play the game.\nDeveloping a game engine for an existing game is a non-trivial task, and usually there will be differences between the way it behaves and the way the original game ran, though they might be slight. But the main thing you should realize is that the game data, representing the \"world\" of the game, will still be proprietary, and generally unlawful to redistribute. So people will still have to have a copy of the game (or at least certain files from it), to play it using your engine.\nOne example of a game where this was done is Jazz Jackrabbit, which can be played with the OpenJazz game engine.\nAnother example (where it was actually the original developer that released the GNU/Linux version of the game engine as free open source software) is DOOM (and since then, most of Id Software's game engines have eventually been released as FOSS, sometimes with slight modifications for patent reasons). There are a number of community projects that have enhanced the original DOOM engine, allowing for more complex maps, enhanced graphics, and a more three-dimensional gameplay experience.\nGiven the limitations and that writing a game engine from scratch (plus testing it and fixing bugs) is a significant task, you might decide to make your own game instead.\n\nDisclaimer: This answer is for informational purposes only and not for the purpose of providing legal advice.

Basically, the application must be installed to and run from /opt/<appname>. You can save information to   the users home directory and those locations vary depending on what you are saving (settings should be saved in ~/.config/<appname>), etc. This follows freedesktop.org standards.\n\nA: The UNIX/Linux file hierarchy has a long history and there are many standards for it.\nFilesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) defines which directory shall be used for what perpose.\nFHS is the main standard in Linux-based systems and is used by Linux Standard Base (LSB), which is followed by many Linux distributions.\n\nA: This actually relates to File System Hierarchy Standard. Even if you consider using your own application \n, for achieving its better integration based on its customized segregation , it is defined in /opt : Add-on application software packages as  \n\nThe directories /opt/bin, /opt/doc, /opt/include, /opt/info, /opt/lib,\n  and /opt/man are reserved for local system administrator(USER) use. Packages\n  may provide \"front-end\" files intended to be placed in (by linking or\n  copying) these reserved directories by the local system administrator,\n  but must function normally in the absence of these reserved\n  directories.\nPrograms to be invoked by users must be located in the directory\n  /opt//bin or under the /opt/ hierarchy. If the\n  package includes UNIX manual pages, they must be located in\n  /opt//share/man or under the /opt/ hierarchy, and\n  the same substructure as /usr/share/man must be used.\nPackage files that are variable (change in normal operation) must be\n  installed in /var/opt. See the section on /var/opt for more\n  information.\nHost-specific configuration files must be installed in /etc/opt. See\n  the section on /etc for more information.\nNo other package files may exist outside the /opt, /var/opt, and\n  /etc/opt hierarchies except for those package files that must reside\n  in specific locations within the filesystem tree in order to function\n  properly. For example, device lock files must be placed in /var/lock\n  and devices must be located in /dev.\nDistributions may install software in /opt, but must not modify or\n  delete software installed by the local system administrator without\n  the assent of the local system administrator.\n\nFollowing this format for custom applications is better supported by the Ubuntu /Linux system .Further ..\nRationale or Fundamental Reason behind it \n\nThe use of /opt for add-on software is a well-established practice in\n  the UNIX community. The System V Application Binary Interface [AT&T\n  1990], based on the System V Interface Definition (Third Edition),\n  provides for an /opt structure very similar to the one defined here.\nThe Intel Binary Compatibility Standard v. 2 (iBCS2) also provides a\n  similar structure for /opt.\nGenerally, all data required to support a package on a system must be\n  present within /opt/, including files intended to be copied\n  into /etc/opt/ and /var/opt/ as well as reserved\n  directories in /opt.\nThe minor restrictions on distributions using /opt are necessary\n  because conflicts are possible between distribution-installed and\n  locally-installed software, especially in the case of fixed pathnames\n  found in some binary software.\nThe structure of the directories below /opt/ is left up to\n  the packager of the software, though it is recommended that packages\n  are installed in /opt// and follow a similar\n  structure to the guidelines for /opt/package. A valid reason for\n  diverging from this structure is for support packages which may have\n  files installed in /opt//lib or /opt//bin\n\n", "Q: draftsight for ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64bit Is there any edited file for draftsight.deb  so it can work on ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64bit\nI have downloaded the draftsight.deb from the website and tried to install it on my laptop\nbut I couldn't install it.\nIf anyone knows an edited deb file please give me the link ...\nI have tried other solutions but it seems that I can't follow up with these solutions or they don't work at all\nI need it for my work ...\nthanks anyway\n\nA: Assuming that it could not install due to a missing dependency? You could always extract the contents of the deb using ar and copy the files across. Once you run it you will likely be able to tell what is missing.

When plugged into a USB 2.0 port on the same motherboard, it is seen as a 12d1:140b, and the network manager automatically takes it up as a modem. \nI tested it on another machine running XUbuntu and it gave the same results. Works like a charm on the USB 2.0 port, but not on USB 3.0.\n\nA: Try this: \nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/usb-modeswitch/+bug/979697/comments/115\nThis worked for me on Ubuntu 12.10, but not on Ubuntu 13.04 (hix)\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem after upgrade but after using this and reboot all went well again \nhttp://www.linuxportal.pl/newsbar/modem-huawei-e1820-problem-z-polaczeniem-id82041\nI know it is in Polish but I found it easy to follow anyhow..\n", "Q: What are the advantages and disadventages of git or bzr + rsync vs rdiff-backup? I used to use rsync to do backups, but then I switched to rdiff-backup to incremental backups.\nRecently, I discovered git and bzr while working on a coding project.\nSo, I was thinking, I could have my backup disk be a repository in either git or bzr. Then I could rsync to the repository, and commit the changes.\nWould there be any performance concerns with this? Any other issues that I'm not thinking of? \nThe benefit I see in using rsync is that you can restart an interrupted transfer, while rdiff-backup reverts to the last version, and then starts again. Any reason not to do it this way? Anything I'm not thinking of?\n\nA: tl;dr There are advantages and disadvantages.\nAdvantages of VCS:\ngit and bzr let you restore to any version you pushed to the repository and lets you selectively exclude files and only add files to the VCS that you need. You can exclude /tmp and various dot-folders in your home directory (I don't recommend excluding ~/.gnupg and ~/.gnome2/keyrings as these have important data).\nDisadvantages of VCS:\nbzr and git store diffs of all changes so every time you push a new change, the repository software needs to calculate and store a diff, which takes space and CPU power. With binary files, it's even worse since even a 2KB change in a 2GB file will prompt the storage of another copy of that 2GB file, unless your repository keeps track of changes in small blocks for binary files, or uses some form of bindiff, where even shifts in the file don't cause trouble.\nMake your choice.

This is because I have limited bandwidth and want to avoid chance of streaming content while TV is off, wasting bandwidth.\nMy solution was to have a cron task run every minute checking for off state.  But I'm don't know how to detect HDMI disconnect/TV off.\nI've been using this fix: HDMI Audio stops after TV turned off for HDMI sound fix when TV turns off.  So I could modify the code such that when ELD_valid switches from 1 to 0, it's time to kill stuff.  But I believe it's monitoring sound status over HDMI?  Also it seems like a bug fix, so my script would work as long as bug is present?\nxrandr looked promising but you have to run it as user connected to a display.  So I couldn't test what output it gives when TV is off from an ssh connection.\nHDMI CEC codes seemed like another solution but you have to buy an adapter and my TV doesn't support CEC.\nAny suggestions?  Thanks.\nP.S.  I'm using ATI catalyst drivers.  I'd be happy with ATI specific solution.\n\nA: \nxrandr looked promising but you have to run it as user connected to a display.\n\nThis is, strictly speaking, not true. It must be able to connect to the X server, but all that requires is 1) the display number, and 2) permission to talk to the X server via the magic cookie or via xauth.\nThe easiest way to get the cookie is to run as the user that is currently logged onto the display.

I know this maybe had been asked a lot in the past but the thing is that I want to know if I can run games smoothly such as Skyrim, COD: Black Ops, Prototype 2, FIFA 12, etc using the 64 bit version of Ubuntu 12.04 of course. \nI'm doing this because Linux always drag my attention but I never tried because of what people said about its performance, so what do you guys think? \nMy pc specs are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel Core i7 870\n\n*8 GB DDR3 RAM\n\n*ATI HD 5750\n\n*Motherboard Intel Extreme Series DP55KG\n\n\nA: It's performance is quite good, often edging above Windows, but compatibility may be an issue. You can install Wine  or PlayOnLinux to run Windows games on Linux for games that do not have a Linux version. However, some games will not run well or won't run at all oner some settings due to compatibility. You can search the Wine AppDB to check compatibility of your game. Here are some common ratings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Garbage: Does not run or runs like rubbish.\n\n*Bronze: Runs partially or needs a workaround\n\n*Silver: Runs well or needs a mild workaround.\n\n*Gold: Runs very well, almost at or equalling Windows\n\n*Platinum: Runs perfectly, possible better than Windows.\nNote that \"better\" does not talk about performance, but compatibility and reliability.\n", "Q: How to fix \"16 bit MS-DOS Subsystem  ... illegal instruction\" installing U1 on Windows XP? I was trying to install Ubuntu One client on my Windows computer, and got this:\n\nI tried clicking ignore, but then there were even more errors.\n\nA: This error indicates that a DOS program is being run. Since the Ubuntu One executable for Windows (or its installer) is unlikely to have any legacy DOS components, it seems likely that the installer you downloaded is corrupted.\nJust about any download can be corrupted, but the Ubuntu One installer is not very large, so the risk of corruption is usually pretty low. So I visited the download page for the Ubuntu One client for Windows, and downloaded it myself.\nI examined the downloaded file (on my Ubuntu system, with file and less), confirming that it did not download correctly. Instead of the executable installer for Ubuntu One, the downloaded file was a web page!\nSo I renamed the file to have a .html extension, and opened it in a web browser. It looks like it might be a problem with OpenID--that, for some reason, the download page thinks you have to be logged in to download the Ubuntu One client (but downloading it while logged in doesn't work either).\nI'll try to look more into this. Ultimately, it should probably be reported as a bug in the Ubuntu One website. Ordinarily we consider bugs off-topic here (reporting them, and most investigation of them), so please don't be alarmed if this question ends up getting closed.\nI'm making this answer community-wiki. Anyone with information about this should feel free to edit this answer (unless moderators say not to continue work on this here, of course).\nUpdate\nI've reported this as a bug. It is bug 1037771 on Launchpad. I reported it against the ubuntuone-servers project rather than the ubuntu-website project, since the domain is one.ubuntu.com (which I believe is administered separately from the main site). I think I got the project right; if not, a triager or developer should be able to retarget it to the correct project.\nI recommend subscribing to the bug (so you receive notifications about it), and indicating you are affected using the green This bug affects... link near the top of the bug page. In addition, I recommend posting your screenshot, as well as any pertinent information that I may have neglected to include, in the bug.\nIf you don't have a Launchpad account, you'll have to first create one in order to do this. (To do that, click Log In / Register at the upper-right corner of the main page, or any Launchpad page.) But having a second person confirm the bug on Launchpad often substantially shortens the amount of time it takes to fix important bugs like this one. (I say it's important as it is likely to affect a large percentage of users and render the product completely unusable for them; for these reasons, I believe the bug is likely to get swift attention on Launchpad, once it has been formally confirmed.)\nUpdate 2\nFor the benefit of others finding this question:\nThe bug has been fixed, and the Ubuntu One client for Windows now downloads correctly.\nAnyone who has this problem can simply re-download the installer (the proper file is currently about 20 MB large), and it should be usable.\n", "Q: Merge multiple small PDFs on A4 size format I have a PDF file with approximatly 300 pages (A4).

Now I need to join these PDFs on A4 papersize. When I use PDFTK I get several pages, which have no whitespace, but when I want to print them, they will be printed out on separate pages.\nHas someone an idea how to handle this problem??\n\nA: Yqou could also try the script \"pdfjoin\" and \"pdfnup\" command line programs from the pdfjam packages. \nHowever, I would include the PDFs in a LaTeX document, and let LaTeX worry about how to fit them best on a page.\nFirst, you need to install LaTeX:\nsudo apt-get install pdflatex\n\nNext, create a file \"joined.tex\" like this:\n\\documentclass[12pt]{article}\n\\usepackage{graphicx}\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\includegraphics[width=15cm]{file1.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=15cm]{file2.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=15cm]{file3.pdf}\n% ...etc, for each of your pdf files\n\\end{document}\n\nFinally, run (in a terminal)\npdflatex joined.tex\n\nHopefully, you will get your file in joined.pdf\n", "Q: How to upgrade nautilus to 3.4 on 11.04? I'd like to upgrade Nautilus from 2.32.2.1 to 3.4 because I've encountered a problem which I cannot reproduce on Nautilus 3.4 (on Ubuntu 12.04). I guess there might be a bug in my current version.\nThe problem is that I'm not that sure if I can simply install a newer version on Ubuntu Natty without causing trouble, because I don't want to change the whole desktop.\nI took a look on the package for Precise just to see if it works, but after following  a few dependencies I end up at the decision to destroy a package (libc-dev-bin) which I don't want to do with my little experience.\nIs it even possible to upgrade and if yes, how could I achieve that?\n(if you know some good explanations of the issue packages & dependencies please feel free to post)\n\nA: Upgrading to 12.04 is by far the easiest way to get a new version of Nautilus. \nNautilus is an integral part of Gnome, which is an integral part of the whole distro, depending on a particular version of libc and other stuff. Trying to update only some of the packages will lead you straight into dependency hell, as you're already discovering, especially when migrating from Gnome2 to Gnome3.\nAnother option is compiling new version of Gnome from source with a separate prefix, but that's also probably more work that you'll be willing to invest. \n", "Q: Partitioning with Windows 7, no free space All my free space is taken by sda1 (ntfs), sda2 (ntfs), and sda3 (ntfs).

I'm trying to run it as a dual boot, and have one hard drive.\n\nA: If you installed Windows with click-click-finish mode, then it took up all your space for Windows the way you mentioned. You have to repartition the main partition (the largest) inside Windows (right-click on My Computer, then Management, then Disk) to make space for your Ubuntu install.\nFirst you need to make sure that at least 10-20 Gbyte is free at all on your disk, but more is better. If you have sufficient free space then shrink the main Windows partition to 10-20 less than its current size.\nBased on the fragmentation of your disk (and the placement of the files and the size of the disk) this could run several hours.\nNow that you have a partition with free space, you can install Ubuntu (which will split this single partition into 2 to 5).\n\nA: you can try Wubi istalator from windows, you find it on ubuntu website.. here is link http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer\n", "Q: Change resolution for an old Philips 109E5 monitor?

[Ubuntu 12.04] [Radeon HD 4850] I've heard many people complain about the ATI drivers on Ubuntu 12.04. So should i stay with radeon drivers (which im not sure if they are good enough) or try install fglrx and risk getting a buggy system?\n\nA: The current fglrx release (12.8) doesn't support the Radeon HD 4850 (source).  The version included in 12.04 is an older version that does support your card, but you won't be able to upgrade to 12.10 when it comes around.  \nMy recommendation is to stay with the radeon driver unless you need to run a specific application that won't run under it. (And if you do have an application that won't run under radeon, you might want to file a bug so that the features you need make it in before you need to upgrade).\n", "Q: MacBook Air and Ubuntu 12.04: Good Buy or Go for an Ultrabook? i tried to set up a Macbook PRO with ubuntu 12.04 and setting up was easy as pie except for a slew of trackpad issues i could never resolve, particularly resting thumb on trackpad while navigating resulted in skipping issues.\nNow im in the market for an ultrabook and a macbook air is what i'm leaning towards but not if its going to be a problem ith ubuntu 12.04/12.10 -- any ideas how well the trackpad works or how to get the trackpad to behave perfectly?\n\nA: After one year with 11.04/11.10 and now 12.10 on my MacBook Air, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.\nYes, the MacBook Air has wonderful hardware. But the hassle of Ubuntu behaving a little more strangely every time I'd download a firmware update through OSX has convinced me that my next machine will be a Lenovo X1, which has comparable hardware to the Air these days. The other, minor, hassle is that the Air still requires quite a few post-install tweaks before it's usable. Thankfully that's a one-time fix -- and it's been automated for some time.\n\nA: From everything I have read the Asus Zenbook Prime out performs the Mac Air 2012 in most tests stock and you can even upgrade it if you were feeling daring and wanted to take the intricate pieces apart.  Some customization shops do this for you and still give you a warranty.  Might be worth looking at especially since they also sometimes install your operating system of choice.  For me that is the only other ultrabook that even comes close to the quality and performance/style of a mac air.  Last bonus is you actually get 2 track pad buttons :D jk  It would be nice if Asus offically supported Ubuntu like some Dell or System 76 systems.  Another bonus to getting the Asus Prime is the price.  Check out the reviews of both and find out what works best for you.\n\nA: I haven't kept up with the latest Apple hardware, and so can't be sure if my experience with a late 2010 MacBook Air will translate over, but everything except graphics works perfectly on my MacBook Air.  The problem with graphics is explained here.  Trackpad works perfectly; in fact, there has been several important improvements in the synaptics driver since I first installed 12.04, such as fixing inertial scrolling and enabling drag select.  \nYou might find installing Ubuntu on the Air difficult unless you are aware of this.  \n\nA: I am in the same position you are; trying to determine if installing Ubuntu 12.04 on a Macbook Air 13'' (2012) will be easy.\nThe Macbook Air 13 hardware is great.  It is light; the screen is clear and not very glossy.\nI am currently beginning to consider other laptops like the Samsung Series 9 and Dell XPS 13.  The Dell XPS 13 supports Ubuntu 12.04 very well according to recent articles on the interweb.  \nGood luck!  \n", "Q: Increase or View all Stored History in Gedit I would like to be able to see the last ~200 files opened in Gedit. I was able to increase the number it shows to 40 using this command:\ngconftool-2 --type int --set /apps/gedit-2/preferences/ui/recents/max_recents 40\n\nbut it is only showing me the last 23.

When ever i press Space in Rhythmbox the song starts over instead of going on pause and when its on pause and i press Space the song starts over again instead of resuming from where it left of.\nSo my question is how can i change this so it will toggle between pause/play? \n\nA: rythymbox's keyboard interface is incoherent. \nThe desired behaviour, (which imo is desired behaviour for all music players at all times,) of space bar being play/pause button, is actually possible after you click play or pause with the mouse. It is like it 'selects' that button. \nHowever, after you select a track for example, the spacebar behaviour changes to selecting that track, so everytime you press pause, I mean spacebar, it will again select that track, and because it is playing it will start playing the track again. I hope this will get fixed sometime into something more sensible and intuitive. Like the desired behaviour.\n\nA: You have to press \"Ctrl+P\" to play/pause apparently (at least on Gnome in Ubuntu 20.04, where I tested it).\nFor some reason this information is not easily accessible.\nSee https://help.gnome.org/users/rhythmbox/stable/shortcuts.html.en for more.\n\nA: You would need to change the source, as space in a tree typically means \"activate the current selection.\" And this describes the behavior you're seeing exactly.\nHowever, it does appear that pressing Ctrl+Space gives your desired behavior.\n\nA: You are ~probably supposed to also be able to change the setting for global play-pause in gnome-control-center -> All Settings -> Keyboard -> Play (or Play/Pause), which I think is by default set to Control-Space.\nBut, it won't let you set Space as an option since that would conflict with other applications.  It's also not working for me at the moment; there might be other pieces of gnome that I don't have loaded cause I'm not running a full gnome desktop.\nThis isn't really a solution, but at least provides a bit more info on the misbehaving subsystems. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 Slow Installs After SSD Upgrade OK.  So I just installed a new SSD into my laptop and put a fresh copy of Ubuntu 12.04 onto the drive.  The OS install took about 45 minutes longer than it ever did with my HDD.  Whenever I go to update software and do the regular updates they take FOREVER.  Every update package seems to lag on \"Unpacking Replacement\".

I would recommend getting a backup of it ASAP.  You can use Déjà Dup, its included in Ubuntu.  Also you may want to run a disk utility to check you hard drive, depending on the manufacturer, most of them have testing utilities.  Also you can try a different hard drive if you have one handy. Again make sure you get a backup ASAP, before the drive gets any worse.  Good luck.\n\nDéjà Dup is a simple backup software for Linux. It hides the\n  complexity of doing backups and uses duplicity as the back end.\nDéjà Dup takes the simplistic approach, and presents just two very\n  large buttons - Backup and Restore. Swipe one (you really can't miss\n  them) and Deja Dup will do the rest. Except, you probably do want to\n  play with the configuration first, such as setting a backup\n  destination, whether you want to encrypt the backups, and which\n  folders to include or exclude (again, removing Downloads is probably a\n  good idea). Note the preferences selection is a separate program to\n  the main one.\nDéjà Dup also makes it easy to set up a schedule and, conveniently,\n  how long backups should be kept ranging from a week to indefinitely.\nUnder the hood Déjà Dup makes use of duplicity, which is a\n  command-line based backup tool for creating encrypted, compressed,\n  incremental backups based rsync (which, incidentally, you can also use\n  to make backups but the programs covered here add extra features such\n  as scheduling).. More info on Déjà Dup.1\n\n1Source:APCMag\n\nA: Using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. \nIn my case the error  \n[xxx.xxxxxx] end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector nnnnnnnnn] \nwas visible when I went to the terminal session (ctrl + alt + F2) and made attempts to log in. (Actually I got a volley of this messages with the same sector number [...nnn...], but different report codes [...xxx...].)\nThe early problems showed up in the graphics environment playing around with the terminal. Commands such as ls returned bus error, \nls * did Killed, firefox &> Desktop/log did bash:Desktop/log: Read-only file system, and like oddities. Programs would not start from the desktop either.\nSince both the bash and several desktop were unresponsive, I had to shut down the computer brutally via the power button.\nIn one case the computer restarted well at the third attempt.\nIn the last occurrence, sadly, it did not go any further than the BIOS with a Read error, i.e. the system could not detect the hard disk at all, as feared and anticipated.\nHowever, I have extracted the hard disk from the computer and then from its casing, so exposing some circuits. These were covered by a thin layer of fine dust.\nIn this design, the hard-disk casing also holds the fan cooling the CPU underneath. So there is a chance that the fine particles sucked in by the fan deposit at the back of it, under the hard disk and on top of its circuits, because that's a low pressure zone.\nI then gently dusted off those circuits with a microfibre cloth, remounted the HD on the casing, reconnected the casing to the computer, and it all worked again. I also have the impression that the computer is a tad faster.\nBefore the last salute to your hard disk, please control if dust has settled on its circuitry.\nIt might be that the fickle behaviour does not mean borrowed time, and that your hard disk is in fact healthy.\n", "Q: Can app developers indicate folders to be excluded from Déjà Dup? OS X‘s Time Machine backup system has an API that let application developers indicate that certain folders belonging to the application should be excluded from the user‘s backup. This is done through an extended attribute set on the directory in the file system.\nWith the mission statement “[…] [Déjà Dup] hides the complexity of doing backups […]” I kind of expect there to be such a thing. As an application’s developer should be well suited to know what folders are safe to exclude. But I cannot find any mention of it online.\nNudges in the right direction or to the right feature request would be appreciated.\n\nA: Déjà Dup will ignore any files in ~/.cache.  So if you're asking because you have cache files, put them in ~/.cache/program-name/.  See the XDG basedir spec for more information.\nYou could also forcibly add folders to the user's exclude-list key in the org.gnome.DejaDup gsettings schema.  That's not very user-friendly (that key is designed only for users to modify), but it's a last resort.\n", "Q: How do I get mrbs installed and working?

I'm a total noob at Linux. In fact, the only version of Linux I ever used was 12.04 through WUBI.

A typical download when upgrading from version to version is 1.5-2Gb)\n\nA: As noted by @Sergey, you can't really update directly from 11.04 to 12.04 ..\nThis needs to be done in two steps:  11.04 to 11.10, then 11.10 to 12.04\nOnce you also have media (either USB or CD/DVD) with the .ISO files for both 11.10 and 12.04, then you can do this offline.\n", "Q: Why does my Virtualbox Ubuntu Server go to a black screen when idle? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I disable the blank console “screensaver” on Ubuntu Server? \n\nI have a Ubuntu server installed system through Virtualbox. I am not getting what is the reason that after sometime its turning to black screen. \nNo prompt and nothing I got with this. It's just black screen. For more clearly its turning to black screen if its in idle for sometime.\n\nA: I will update this answer as more information is gather and provided. Right now, as far as I can tell, this is the only kind of answer that can be provided. And it would be quite awkward to convey all this information in a comment. Also, since this provides detailed information about how to diagnose this sort of problem, I hope for it to be useful to others as well, and think that it therefore should be posted as an answer.\nAs izx has said, on a command-line system like Ubuntu Server, it's normal for the screen to turn black by itself after some time passes, if you're not actively using it. This is the virtual console version of a screensaver. Just press a key and it will come back.\nMake sure your keyboard input is actually being sent to the virtual machine when you do this. If it isn't, that can create the impression that the Server is not responding, even when nothing is wrong.\nIf this is what's happening, there's nothing to worry about, but if you want to disable automatic screen blanking, see this question:\n\n*\n\n*How do I disable the blank console \"screensaver\" on Ubuntu Server?\n(Credit due to izx for posting this as well.)\n\nIf that's not the problem, then more information will be required.\nWhen the server is working properly (since it sounds from what you're saying that it runs OK for a while and then the screen goes black), SSH in from the host machine or some other machine capable of accessing it (install opehssh-server first if it's not installed).\n\n*\n\n*To do this, run ssh username@server-name-or-ip from a terminal.\n\n*Or, if you're connecting from Windows and don't already have an SSH client, use PuTTY.\n\nThen, when the problem occurs, see if the SSH session is still connected. If it is--that is, if you can still use the remote SSH login--then the problem is related to video.\nIf the connection is terminated or otherwise stops working, you might get some message. (If it's terminated you certainly will, though it may or may not be particularly useful.)\nWhether or not the connection is Terminated, there are some logs you can look at. You can start showing them right after connecting, before the problem occurs. Feel free, of course, to use your own problem-solving skills and see which logs in /var/log you think might be relevant. I recommend looking at the kernel logs: /var/log/dmesg and /var/log/kern.log. You can view logs so that when new lines are logged, you see them immediately, by using a command like this:\ntail -f /var/log/dmesg\n\nThen edit your question to include whatever information you find. Using the above method, since you were SSH'd in remotely (though perhaps from the virtualization host), all text from the Terminal should remain visible (and copyable to the SSH client's clipboard) even after your virtual Ubuntu Server machine goes down.\nSo you can include some of it in your question, and could even include sections of basically unlimited length (including the whole thing) by posting it at http://paste.ubuntu.com (or just about any other Pastebin) and adding a link to it in your question.\n", "Q: Which music player has visualizations? I thought it was a stupid question, but my preferred player, Amarok, doesn't have visualizations. RhythmBox also. Where can I find a Linux player with interesting visualizations?\nMy 5 years old boy want to hear his CD with the funny things of mommy's computer. \n\nA: Totem movie player has some nice visualisations that can be enabled via edit > preferences > display (see the second screenshot below). You can start the visualisations by playing a music track (when that option is is set in the preferences) and pause them by pausing the music track. There are many different visualisations to choose from and different effects can be combined. \nI don't think that they respond to the beat of the music (i.e. get more frenzied as the tempo increases), but perhaps something like audiosurf might become available if Steam makes good its promise and comes to Ubuntu.\nUnfortunately, if the sound file contains an album cover picture, (for example say like one has with files downloaded from Jamendo), then Totem displays the album art and not the visualizations.\n\n\n\n\nA: Clementine  has some visualizations.\nHere is a screenshot of it.\n\nOnce Clementine is installed, you can enable it's visualization from Tools->Visualizations . You can then customize your visualization by right-clicking the window that shows up and then adjust the frame-rate, quality and the different visualizations that you would like.

The good news about Audacious is, you can enable more than one visualizations with it.   \nAfter installation, while playing an audio file, go to View →   Visualizations and select one. Here, I'm giving a screenshot of audcious player.\n\n\nA: ProjectM is a standalone visualization app that plays the WinAmp MilkDrop visualizations. It's engine is what powers the visualizations on XMBC, Clementine and others.\n\nIt can be installed stand-alone and will play visualizations for whatever is pumping out of your speakers (technical: it taps into pulseaudio to \"hear\" the audio).\nThis way you can use your favorite media player even if it hasn't got visualizations.\nTo get it, search for ProjectM pulseaudio on Ubuntu Software Center or install straight from the terminal with:\nsudo apt-get install projectm-pulseaudio\n\nThen launch it from unity by typing ProjectM on unity search.\nThe Ubuntu wiki page on ProjectM has some keyboard shortcuts for controlling ProjectM, including the f key to toggle the all-important full-screen mode.\n\nA: Thanks for all answers.

While browsing the net about formatting my 1T hard drive as ext4, I read about people completely filling their drive and being unable to mount. How much can I fill it to safely? Even 95% wastes 50 GB! 99% seems too close as percentage.  This is not a system drive just storage.\n\nA: Ok, so the question is about filling up the filesystem, not about partitioning the drive. Two things come to mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Accidentally filling up a filesystem should not cause total filesystem corruption. Filesystem code is written by the most skilled developers, tested for years before being included into the kernel and used as the default filesystem in a distribution. Ext4 is used on millions and millions of computers, some of which contain mission-critical data or highly loaded. It it exteremely unlikely that developers simply forgot to add a check for free space before writing data or that a major bug exist which routinely leads to filesystem corruption when the filesystem is full.\n\n*By default, when an ext4 filesystem is created, a few percent of disk space is reserved for the superuser, so during the normal operation it is impossible to use up all disk space, unless you're logged in as root.\nThe latter does waste some considerable space on large drives (5% by default), so some people reduce this number on non-system drives.\nIn certain situations (repeatedly creating and deleting many files) a nearly-full filesystem may result in excessive fragmentation and some performance loss, however ext4 is better in this respect than ext3.\n\nA: If you use GPT partitioning you need to make a 1MB or so (can actually be much smaller) partition for grub at the very beginning of the disk, if you ever want to boot from it. (GParted can do this)\nOtherwise, don't worry about it, you can always mount a overfilled disk, its just that non-root users wont be able to make files, and even then, you can always change this number after creating the filesystem with e2fstune, so don't worry about it.\n", "Q: How can I repair bootable USB drive? I have made an USB Drive, as live USB. But I am unable to boot from it. It has all required files. Assuming I don't have original ISO, how can I attempt to make it bootable again?\n\nA: First, if the USB stick is not booting, I recommend erasing the whole USB stick and remake it again.\nDownload pendrivelinux or UNetbootin to create the Live USB again.  The program will automatically wipe all the stuff on the USB stick and copy the files from the Ubuntu iso to the USB stick (and remember to download the iso from the Ubuntu site.)\nIf it doesn't boot, and it shows the purple screen before the computer blacks out, try changing the boot options.\nTap F6 when you reach the purple screen.\n\nTry nolapic and nomodset first.  Try all other options of the options mentioned didn't work.  Use  ↑ and ↓ to switch options and press Enter to choose the option.\nIf the computer boots, you are done, not really.  After you installed ubuntu, read this thread on the Ubuntu Forums and jump to the \"How to permanently set kernel boot options on an installed OS (not wubi)\" part to apply the boot option permanently.\nIf the USB stick still won't boot, read My computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it? to find the cause of not booting.\n", "Q: Flash Video Problem Ubuntu 12.04 I have looked in multiple other questions and none of them seem to have the right answer for me.

I am totally new to Ubuntu and I want create a backup of my full operating system and restore it to another system or the same system.\nCould you possibly to explain the step by step process to make a backup and restore it?\n\nA: Image type backups have several problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*They can not do daily/incremental backups\n\n*Most of them can not extract an individual file or set of files you realize you deleted/overwrote\n\n*They can not restore to a disk that is smaller than the original, even if there was plenty of free space\n\n*Restoring to a larger disk often requires extra steps to make use of the additional space\n\n\nIt is best to to stick with the tried and true methods:  tar and dump.  I use dump because it is much faster at backing up and extracting individual files than tar, and handles incremental backups better.  It also uses multithreaded compression, which is nice on today's multi core machines.  Either way, when making the backup, you need to shut down your services to make sure no files are being written while you make the backup.  If you use LVM then you only need to do this long enough to make a snapshot, then you can bring your services back online, and backup the snapshot.  Here is the script I have cron automatically run every night:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\ndeclare -a LEVELMAP=(1 5 4 5 3 5 4 5 2 5 4 5 3 5 4 5 1 5 4 5 3 5 4 5 2 5 4 5 3 5 4 5)\nDATE=`date +%-d`\nLEVEL=${LEVELMAP[$DATE-1]}\necho Performing a level $LEVEL dump\n#shutdown services here\nsync\nlvcreate -s -n snap devserv/root -L 500m\n#start them back up here\ndump -$LEVEL -quz9 -b 1024 -f /backup/dump.$LEVEL /dev/mapper/devserv-snap\nlvremove -f devserv/snap\n\nI make a level 0 ( full ) dump usually every ~6 months when I upgrade the server, then this script makes a level 1 dump ( all files changed since level 0 ) on the 1st and 17th of the month, and alternates between level 2-5 the rest of the days.\nThis means to restore the system I have at most 5 dumps to restore, sometimes less ( if the server dies right after the level 1 dump then you just need to restore the level 0 and 1 ), and I have several dumps stretching back over the last days, weeks, months I can go pull an old file out of if I need to, possibly multiple versions of it as it changed at different points.\nIf you don't care about having multiple points to go back and pull older files out of, a simpler alternative is to do a level 0 once every 6 months, level 1 every Monday, and level 2 every other day of the week.\n\nA: You can use programs such as Clonezilla\nIt looks like Acronis and true image for windows\n http://clonezilla.org/\ntutorial for clonezilla can be found here.\n\nA: You can also look into Redo backup.

I normally dual-boot with 12.04 and Win XP pro sp3 on a Thinkpad R60.  I needed to reinstall windows because of problems piling up, so I ran the computer's built-in hard-disk recovery software.  I told it not to mess with the other partitions, but somehow it deleted the Linux partition.  That's what I was using to backup all of my windows files, so now everything I have is gone.

Every now and then, I disable my wireless via the menu icon in Ubuntu. Then, when I try to enable the wifi, it tells me that \"wireless is disabled\" or \"wireless is disabled by hardware switch\". There is a red icon on the F2 key that looks like a wireless icon, and in Windows, pressing the (red) Fn key and F2 toggles the wifi. This does not work in Ubuntu, leaving me no clear way to turn wifi back on. How can I restart wifi in Ubuntu?\n\nA: On my Dell XPS 17 L702X  with Ubuntu Desktop 12.04 AMD64 the combination is simply Fn-F2.\nIt's good to know that it can differ.\n\nA: I found by trial and error that the wifi hardware switch on my Dell is not Fn-F2, as implied by the keyboard icon (and works in Windows), but actually Fn-Alt-F2 in Ubuntu. Toggling the wifi off and on can also fix some software issues. On the XPS 17 L702X, keep an eye on the wifi LED indicator to the right of the power switch to note when it's back on.\n\nA: Fn+F2 combination works on 12.04, but only when pressed twice to enable WiFi and led indicator, to turn it off, pressing it once is enough.\n", "Q: Can't open .wmv video files I installed 12.04 and installed all plug-ins related to video drive. \nI installed VLC player and tried to start a .wmv file but I get this error:\n\nNo suitable decoder module:\n  VLC does not support the audio or video format \"MSS2\".

I've looked at an aptitude tutorial and read the man page, but I just don't get it.  After you launch aptitude, how do you say \"install package foo\"?  Or search for all packages with \"foo\" in their name?\n\nA: To search for a package, hit / and enter a part of the package name you want to search (regexps can be used). This is similar to search in editors like vim.\nYou can use the up- and down-arrow keys for browsing, together with enter for toggling the tree nodes.\nWhen you have found the right package, hit + to mark it for installation (it will be shown in green and you see an i as the second character in the status column). Then type g (for \"go\") to get to the preview screen showing all pending changes. A second g will start the installation.\nYou can also use enter when on a package to open a window with details of the package.\nWhen there are more than one windows open in aptitude (like the package details and preview windows), you switch between them with F6 and F7, and close the current window with q.\n\nA: After running aptitude, use these key commands as found at Using aptitude GUI style: (If you use Bionic, use CTRL+T instead of F10)\n\nF10 to access the aptitude menu.\n? this is to access \"help\"\nUse 'up' ↑, 'down' ↓ , 'left' ←, 'right' →, to navigate.\nUse Enter to select items.\nUse + or - to install, update, or remove a package\nUse g to preview or confirm actions\nq to quit – this will also close the currently open window (g goes forward, q goes back)\n\nThe common use of aptitude in TUI (text user interface) is:\n\n*\n\n*run aptitude;\n\n*press u (update the lists of available packages);\n\n*press U (Mark all upgradable packages to be upgraded);\n\n*(search/select some stuff to install, is optional);\n\n*press g (to see the pending actions and modify if needed);\n\n*press g (again, to start the download).\n\nSome time when you need to resolve conflicts, you discover that you made a mistake;\nyou can easily use 'Cancel pending actions' in the 'Actions' menu so that you can re-select.\nWhen reviewing pending actions:\n\na explicitly accepts an action (use again to unaccept)\nr rejects an action\ng again goes ahead with pending actions\n\nUsing aptitude from the command line like apt-get\nTo install a package on a console run:\naptitude install package name\n\nTo search packages:\naptitude search package name\n\nFor example, let's say you want to install Pidgin\nSearch:\naptitude search pidgin\n\nInstall:\naptitude install pidgin\n\n\nA: With aptitude you can use the ncurses based console in the terminal (see the other answers for that) or use all of its options on the command line. I usually use the latter method, as I'll demonstrate using the example of the cheese package:\n(Before using any of the aptitude install commands in this article it is worth running sudo aptitude update to refresh the list of available software.)\nTo search for a package, use\naptitude search cheese\n\nThen to show all the package information concerning versions and dependencies, type\naptitude show cheese\n\nThen to install it use\nsudo aptitude install cheese\n\nHowever, beyond the standard basic usage of searching, removing, and installing packages, aptitude can install and remove packages with one command. With aptitude install commands add - after the package name to have it removed, and with aptitude remove commands add + after the package name to have it installed.\nIf you enter\nsudo aptitude install cheese gthumb-\n\ncheese will be installed while gthumb will be removed.\nHowever, on the other hand, if you use\nsudo aptitude remove grsync+ htop\n\nhtop will be removed and grsync installed.\nSource: see the Debian handbook for more information on aptitude.\nFor another essential explanation of aptitude and its other useful commands, see man aptitude or the Ubuntu manpages online. \n", "Q: Cannot use a second monitor When I plug in my second display and activate it in \"Displays\" I get an \"Out of range\" error.

Canonically, it should probably be '.*' meaning zero or more of any character.\nYour match, 'orca*', matches anything with 'o','r','c' followed by zero or more 'a' characters hence you get a lot more packages. For example, it matched liborc-0.4.0  which would have forced anything depending on that to be removed as well. apt-get may also have removed other items which were installed to satisfy dependencies and are no longer required.\n(PS: it's not a bug!)\n\nA: You should be able to get back to a sane place by reinstalling ubuntu-desktop.\nIt's probably going to reinstall orca though :)\n\nTo chroot in and restore this from a LiveCD:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to a LiveCD and click Try.\n\n*Set up your network connection.

So I shutdown and powered up again and this time held 'Alt' the menu came up and I selected the Windows Disk and then it went to the grub menu and I then had the choice again.

If thunar-volman is installed and configured properly, for example, and you plug in your removable media, it will automatically launch your preferred application and auto-mount your media. \nMore details can be found here and here at the official XFCE site.\n", "Q: How to optirun .sh file?

Maybe its caused LMMS, but the problem appeared after installing skype. :)\n\nA: Thanks for your support. I was able to fix it with:\nsudo dpkg --remove libasound2:i386 libasound2-plugins:i386\n\nI tried to install Skype over both ways (Software Center and Skype.com). Now I just run the +x from the official tarball.\n\nA: Ran into a similar issue with WINE for 32bit exes, on x64 Ubuntu 14.04.  Support for 32-bit exes is provided by the multiarch :i386 wine, which depends on the :i386 multiarch versions of various non-WINE libraries.\n(As I understand it, these :i386 packages are identical binaries to what Ubuntu i386 would use, saving space on mirrors, and saving build time since there is no need to build a 32bit-for-x64 version of anything.  And of course letting you have the 32 and 64 bit version of pretty much anything installed side by side, so you can run any i386 Linux binary on an x64 system.  As well as saving build time and mirror space, nobody needs to specifically package anything as 32bit-on-x64.)\nwine1.6-i386:i386 1:1.6.2-0ubuntu4\n  recommends: libasound2-plugins:i386  (which I think is required for sound to work if another program has an open audio output stream, since this is where the alsa->pulseaudio module lives.)\nlibasound2-plugins:i386  1.0.27-2ubuntu2\n  depends: libjack-jackd2-0 (>= 1.9.5~dfsg-14) | libjack-0.116\nTrying to install libasound2-plugins:i386 tries to pull in libjack-jackd2-0, which conflicts with libjack0.  I have the x64 libjack0 installed already, so the package manager sees a conflict.\nUnfortunately, apt doesn't realize that it could resolve the dependency by installing libjack0:i386 instead of libjack-jackd2-0:i386 to satisfy libasound2-plugins:i386's dependency.  Manually selecting it lets me select libasound2-plugins:i386 without conflicts.  (I used aptitude).\nYup, that got sound working for x86 apps (including wine) when pulseaudio is needed.  At first I thought this was a packaging bug with something, but no, turns out it's just a bug in the dependency solver for multiarch.\n\nA: Looks like a broken package. You'll need to remove libasound2-plugins. You might have to force it to remove, using this line sudo dpkg --remove -force --force-remove-reinstreq libasound2-plugins. (Here are a number of other commands that can help you clean up apt-get when it gets unruly.)\nSkype, in their infinite wisdom, haven't bothered releasing a 64-bit version of their Linux client. Therefore, it depends on the 32-bit versions of everything that it depends on. So, you'll also need to do that.\nTo install the libraries, run apt-get install ia32-libs before installing Skype. \n", "Q: auto mount cryptmount/encrypted loop device Because of limitation of filename size of ecryptfs, I decided to use encrypted partition. Since I already use ecryptfs, for my home folder, I don't need the key to be password-protected. \nI need a script, that can non-interactively mount an encrypted filesystem contained in a given file with a key stored in a binary file. I am open to any working solution to this problem, as long, as I can use sparse file as a backing storage (so no truecrypt, and no cryptmount-setup).\n\nA: It should be possible to use dm-crypt/LUKS/cryptsetup for this using the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a sparse disk image file: dd if=/dev/zero of=IMAGEFILE bs=1 count=1 seek=SIZE\n\n*Generate a random key in a file: dd if=/dev/random of=KEYFILE bs=1024 count=1\n\n*Use cryptsetup luksFormat --key-file KEYFILE --cipher aes-xts-plain --size 512 IMAGEFILE (Or use another cipher and key length. Note that 512 here will give you AES with 256 bits because of XTS.)\n\n*Open crypt container: cryptsetup luksOpen --key-file KEYFILE IMAGEFILE NAME\n\n*Create file system on /dev/mapper/NAME.\n\n*Mount file system as usual.\n\n\nYour script would just have to do steps 4 and 6. For unmounting/closing, umount the file system and call cryptsetup luksClose NAME.\nNote that using sparse files will leak the information which sectors of the disk have been used already (the same way as not overwriting a partition with random data before encrypting it). It is up to you to decide whether this is ok for you.\nAlso note that deleting files will not make the disk image smaller. The sparse file will grow monotonically.\n", "Q: Libre office and in line editing I can't know for certain if this problem has been raised and solved before in this forum, as I don't quite know what the proper term is to describe it.\nWhen I go back to previous paragraphs in libre writer and try to add in words, those added words, as they're typed, erase the letters in front of them in that paragraph, as if taking up that words space.

(sorry for formatting, can't get it to work)\n\nA: if you look closesly over your /etc/password file, you'll notice that the user \"messagebus\" has a user I'd of 102. So what your ps shows is the numeric user id instead of the username, because it doesn't fit into the default column width of ps. Truncating a username is no option, since it would end up in confusion. But you can manually set a different width for the user column, e.g.\n`ps ax -o pid,user:19,comm`\n\nNow you should see the username turn to \"messagebus\". Btw. the command gives a hint to the right user: The running command is \"dbus-daemon\", the message bus daemon, that enables inter-process communication and runs under the system user \"messagebus\"!\n\nA: The user is \"messagebus\" in your passwd file, here:\n  messagebus:x:102:105::/var/run/dbus:/bin/false\n\nThe third option is the USERID, the fourth is the GROUPID.\nDbus is a messagin system for the applicatiopns to talk to each other.\nYou can read more about the dbus daemon and the messagebus here:\nhttp://linux.die.net/man/1/dbus-daemon-1\n", "Q: Wifi and Ethernet connectivity problems after upgrading to 12.04 I upgraded recently to ubuntu 12.04 from 11.10, and since then I haven't been able to connect to Internet, neither using wifi, nor using ethernet.\nI've been reading many posts, but not finding a solution in any. \nMy laptop is a 64-bit HP-G61, my wifi card a Atheros AR9285 and my ethernet card a Realtek RTL 8101E/RTL8102E.

It used to work fine with older versions of Ubuntu. But on 12.04 it doesn't. It is able to connect but I do not see any packet exchange happening, hence not able to browse the Intranet. \nDuring some troubleshooting I found out that in 12.04 DNS resolution has been changed, and my VPN client is not able to update the DNS server. After a little Googling I found a post which proposed adding the DNS nameserver IP addresses to /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf as follows.\nprepend domain-name-servers <ip1>, <ip2>;   #this was the addition i made\n\nrequest subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,\n    domain-name, domain-name-servers, domain-search, host-name,\n    netbios-name-servers, netbios-scope, interface-mtu,\n    rfc3442-classless-static-routes, ntp-servers,\n    dhcp6.domain-search, dhcp6.fqdn,\n    dhcp6.name-servers, dhcp6.sntp-servers;\n\nThis resolves the issue and I can browse the intranet website. But this doesn't persist for a longer time. It appears the DNS gets changed after a while. Is there a way I can make DNS settings not to change, or every time it changes it should get those IP addresses also included ? \n\nA: In ubuntu 12.04, any changes made manually to /etc/resolv.conf will be overwritten later by a DNS information manager called resolvconf.\nIf you want to change the default settings, you could modify files base, head, or tail under /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d. \n\n\n*\n\n*base: Used when no other data can be found\n\n*head: Header of default resolv.conf. The server inside will the first\nones to check. \n\n*tail: entries appended at the end of resolv.conf.

Today I wanted to start a program from gnome-terminal and it tells me that it's not installed currently, although I ran the program a minute ago on Guake.\nWhen I echo $TERM, I get xterm on both, however echo $PATH in gnome-terminal differs.  Does anyone know what this is about ?\n\nA: It's possible that you modified the $PATH in Guake. If you're able to run the program from Guake, copy $PATH and then use the following command in gnome-terminal:\nexport PATH=<path copied from Guake>\n\nNow try to run the program. If you want it to remain the same permanently, put the above line in your ~/.bashrc file.\n", "Q: How do I create an icon for a script or software that is available to every user whether new or existing There seems to be lots of help in the FAQs for customizing Unity, even with dconf-editor and other tools.  However, as an administrator of a large thin client installation, from time to time, there are special installations of educational software or of scripts for special uses that I have to make available to all users.\nTake, for example, the application for Oaks Standardized Testing. To install it on a workstation, one only need to untar the distro and create a link of some kind to the start up script.  Once done, how to I \"push\" that out to every user on the network (at their next login, obviously) so that it is available to them on the Unity Dash?\n\nA: To create an icon representation of an application to be e.g shown in the Dash, or on the Desktop we need to define a <name_of_app>.desktop file that may have the following content:\n[Desktop Entry]  \nType=Application    \nExec=</path/to/executable [--options]> # commands to run  \nIcon=</path/to/icon> # optional path to the icon  \nTerminal=false # set 'true' for terminal applications  \nOnlyShowIn=GNOME;XFCE;KDE;Unity; # optionally defines where the icon is shown\n\nWe may want to place this file in the user's HOME in ~/.local/share/applications (recommended), or for a system wide access for all users in /usr/share/applications. It is important to give the full path to the executable (or script) or to the application's icon here.\nWe can put this desktop file in the appropriate directory at the time we installed the external application but of course we could also do this later (e.g. during a SSH session).\nSee also: Desktop Entry Specification\n", "Q: How to configure Thunderbird to notify new mails only in certain folders? I have Ubuntu 12.04 and recently started using Thunderbird. \nI have GMail account and have configured a lot of Labels in it, all of which appear as folders in Thunderbird. Most of these are just subscriptions to mailing lists and are not that important.\nI have a few labels which are very important, for whom I would like immediate notification when a mail arrives.\nThe problem is that the Mail indicator in the Unity top Panel, lights up for any incoming mail. How do I configure it to indicate incoming mails only in certain folders?\n\nA: In Thunderbird, when we Right Click on Inbox or any of the Folder Entries in the Left Panel, we get a Subscribe Option in the Context Menu.\n\nUsing this we can subscribe to a select group of folders among all the available folders in the Mail Account.\nBy doing so, Thunderbird checks for New Mail, only in those folders, and the indicator responds to new mail only in those folders.\n\nA: As discussed in this bug report the current behavior (12.04) of the messaging menu plugin for thunderbird is to turn the envelope blue only for certain types of emails (e.g. depending on priority, mailing lists, etc). Typically mailing lists should not change the icon color.\nYou can filter your emails in thunderbird (for instance, change priority) so as not to trigger the notification. To do this, setup a new filter from Tools> Message Filters. Provide criteria that match messages you deem of low priority. Among the possible actions to perform, there is Set priority to. Pick it up, then set value to Low or Lowest.\nYou can check if it works by adding \"you as sender\" to the criteria and sending yourself a message.\nAt the moment the user has no way to indicate explicitly which messages should turn the icon blue. Please consider the above as a workaround, as I believe priority should be set only on the sender side.\n", "Q: Why can I not install the 'gir1.2-gwibber-gtk-0.2' package?

I am using Ubuntu 12.04, how do I see the applications open on different workspaces.\nThe issue that I am having is that I have opened 3 instances gnome-terminal and have minimized them; the unity launcher isn't showing any of the terminal application I guess they might be on another workspace.\n\nTo my surprise, i am noticing that the terminal are not showing up on unity launcher. This is bugging me. \nAny logs that I could paste here, that would help in tshooting.\nPlease help.\nThanks\n\nA: On your launcher, on the left side of the screen, at the bottom should be this button:\n\nWhenever you click it, it should sprawl out all of your workspaces, and you can see what windows are open.\nAlternatively, you can use Super+S to open up all of your workspaces as well.\n\nA: I had the same problem. The terminal did not show up in the Laucher or when using Alt+Tab. This was after migrating my Ubuntu 12.04 installation to a new laptop.\nSolution: Uninstall gnome-terminal using Ubuntu software center and re-install it right afterwards.\n\nA: If they are in a different workspace, hold Super/Windows button and S . This will show you all thw workspaces. Click on whichever workspace you would like to view.\n\nA: You can also press Ctrl+Alt+Arrow Key to quickly switch workspaces in the direction of the arrow.\n\nA: Seems to be the same problem as https://askubuntu.com/questions/149442/why-do-some-programs-not-remain-on-the-dashboard. I don't believe this is to do with workspaces - I see programs appearing in the launcher whatever workspace they are in and never see terminal at all. Also I cannot switch to terminal with alt+tab - this means that if another window is in front of terminal then the only way to get back is to move the other window. Minimising a terminal rendered it completely inaccessible. From the system monitor I was able to confirm that terminal was still running and kill it, but not switch back to it. (Then I clicked the system monitor's title bar and the click went straight through to the program behind it - but that's a separate issue.) This appears to be a bug in Unity (and possibly also gnome-terminal). The most obvious solution for me is to switch back to gnome classic.\n", "Q: How can i get left clicking on my mouse to work again Ok so far i have been using Ubuntu 12.04 without any problem, but one the mouse clicker just don't work when i select something.

If I check https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com it says there was no sales so far, but the app has couple reviews, so it's not possible.\n \nI wonder if it's a bug or I can't get stats if app costs $0.\n\nA: Unfortunately, the answer is that for now you can't.\nOpen Source apps at zero cost are distributed through the extras archive at extras.ubuntu.com, and downloads are not tracked from there.\nCommercial apps are distributed through private PPAs, which have a reliable method to count downloads and purchases, which are then shown in the graph you're seeing.\nSo I'm afraid that until there is an implementation for a reliable method of counting downloads from a packaging archive (extras in this case) the download stats will remain disabled for Open Source apps at zero cost.\n", "Q: Cursor jumps to corner of screen when I touch edges of touchpad/trackpad When using Ubuntu 12.04, if I happen to touch one of the extreme edges of my touchpad, my cursor spontaneously jumps to the top left corner of the screen.

But they are not a problem, either.\nThe messages say:\nSuccessful su for user by root\nThis happens whenever you log in. Whether you're logging in as a real user or as a guest user, the login screen runs as root, so it must change user identity from root to a non-root user as part of the login process.\nThis isn't user becoming root.

I used the 12.04 minimal installation image/ CLI installer to install the base operating system.  Once the base system was installed I did the following:\nsudo apt-get install python-software-properties\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nAt this point there were system upgrades which were downloaded and applied.  I went on to install xorg nvidia-current gdm gnome-shell synaptic.  Every step of the way I'd check for \"upgrades\" and after the initial bout of upgrades nothing was ever upgraded.\nOnce I rebooted, logged into the gnome desktop environment and started synaptic, however, on Mark All Upgrades Synaptic said:\nTo be upgraded\n   linux-headers-generic\n   linux-image-generic\n\nIt seems like that should've been upgraded during the installation, yes?  But I'm using ppa which draw software newer than that which is available in Synaptic.\nWill I downgrade the ppa installations I've already applied to the system by running the aforementioned upgrade through synaptic?\n\nA: Just run the following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThat would take care of everything. As a general rule, you should not upgrade the kernel yourself.\n", "Q: How can I get sudo to accept my password? I am trying to install subversion on my Ubuntu 12.04 desktop. I follow the commands to start this process, using apt-get:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install subversion\n\nEither of the above commands then ask me to enter my password. Though my user password allows me to get into Ubuntu, when I enter it here there is no echo back as I enter the password. It acts like nothing is being entered at all. Then when I hit enter, it tells me it failed x number of times. When I have tried to enter it the third time it bombs out and tells me this will be reported. \nIt does not tell me who it reports it to, considering it is my machine and my desktop installation of Ubuntu 12.04.\nI am new to Linux but a very experienced Windows User. I am trying to switch mostly over to Linux (Ubuntu). Am I doing something wrong?\n\nA: I think there might be a different problem here:\nWhen you get your password wrong three times and you are in the sudo group the result is:\nsudo: 3 incorrect password attempts\n\nOnly when you are NOT in the sudo group, will it say something like \"this incident will be reported\".\nTherefore, check whether you are in the sudo group with id, which will show all the groups you belong to.\nIf you are not in the sudo group, then you will probably have to boot from a live CD and follow the instructions here (but add yourself to sudo rather than admin if you're running Ubuntu 12.04). You won't be able to use pkexec if you are not in the sudo group, so that won't be a solution unfortunately.\n\nA: You are issuing the wrong commands. It must be:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen after it finishes\nsudo apt-get install subversion\n\nYou can also combine, like:\nsudo apt-get update && apt-get install subversion\n\nI didn't see the part where you said either so i'm supposing you enter the correct commands, if so, it appears that your user may not be allowed to run sudo.\nTo add your user to the sudo group just follow the info here as Mik said\nTo check if your user has root privileges you can go to - System Definitions - Users, and see if your user has the account type - Administrator\n\nA: This is normal. There is not feedback when you type it, not even asterisks. Keep typing it. It will be accepted if it is correct. Also, follow the other answer for the correct commands. The violation is reported to nobody, as it is sent to logs and a blackhole email address on your system. The password(It has to be your password) needs to be correct, though.\n\nA: It is normal for any \"sudo\" command sequence to be asked for your password, when you type it nothing is displayed (it stops people knowing how many characters your password has) and when you finish entering it you must press return as any other character will invalidate the password you typed.\nThe password used when you installed Ubuntu should always be valid though it is possible to set \"auto log-in\" on power up (like Windows) but the password is required for many operations such as installing software or running some updates.\nJohn \n\nA: Type 'passwd' and press enter.\nit will prompt u to enter new unix password.do so and retype to conform as new password.\ntry sudo again.and o it wont show u wat u r typing.just type the password and press enter.\nhope it works.it did for me.try to avoid numbers\\\\\n :)\n", "Q: can not upgrade to ubuntu 12.04 I can not upgrade to Ubuntu 12.04. I have tried many times with two different commercial DVD's and on two different computers. Both had 11.10 as the OS. Finally got the newer computer to upgrade via download, but older computer will not upgrade at all. \nIn addition the upgrade attempt on the older computer leaves no OS at all installed. Luckily I have a CD of Ubuntu 11.04 I can reload then upgrade back to 11.10. But I want to use 12.04 on both machines.\nEdit: This is on an HP desktop as is the other computer attempting to install from DVD gives a fatal error message which is different each time one was something about a blacklisted file and not being able to calculate the upgrade.\n\nA: First, download 12.10.

If the data on the hard drive is gone, then no need to upgrade.\n", "Q: SSD errors with 12.04 I've just upgraded my 32-bit Xubuntu 10.04 system to 64-bit 12.04 (Core 2 Duo) and am getting consistent errors on my Crucial SSD which causes it to remount in read-only mode after about an hour of using the system. Sometimes it seems the cause is heavy I/O installing new applications (it's a fresh install) while other times it fails while sitting idle.\nBug #992424 describes the issue with several people confirming it and others posting kernels that work for them. It was originally reported in February, but the latest activity seems to be early June. I've tried these kernels with no success:\n\n\n*\n\n*3.2.29 (installed with Xubuntu 12.04)\n\n*3.1.5\n\n*3.0.41\n\n*3.0.17\n\n\nWhat should I try next? I think the next step is to install 11.10 and hope the problem was introduced with 12.04, but I'm wondering if perhaps there could be a 32- vs. 64-bit issue here. It's a Dell Vostro 200 with a 64-bit Core 2 Duo, so I installed the 64-bit version, but I was running the 32-bit version before with no trouble. This all started immediately after installing 64-bit 12.04.\nIf it matters, I first installed over my existing 10.04 system hoping to keep most settings in tact. When I got the first errors, I did a clean install and copied over only my non-configuration home directory files.\n\nA: Check for firmware and driver updates.\nA few days later my coworker experienced the same errors on her machine without having updated or altered her installation in any way. After restarting, about an hour later her machine would experience problems due to the SSD being remounted in read-only mode. This was the exact same problem I was having.\nGiven that we installed the same brand of SSD on the same day, we decided to investigate this as a hardware issue. It turns out that this particular brand of SSD was shipped with a firmware bug that starts causing read errors after 3,154 hours of cumulative uptime. The errors disappear after a restart but reappear after one hour thereafter, forever.\nUpdating the Crucial m4 64GB SSD's firmware to version 000F solved this issue.\n", "Q: Where could I get the apparmor profile for latest Skype4?

How do I create a 32-bit Wine prefix on Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit?\n\nA: This Is how I did it. The above answer - for me - did not work.\nFirst I deleted the Wine folder with this command:\nrm -r ~/.wine\n\nIf it tells you that directory is not empty just add the -f (force) flag. Note that this will remove any windows applications installed in this prefix!\nYour command should look something like this:\nrm -r -f ~/.wine\n\nAnd then create a 32 bit prefix with this command:\nWINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX=~/.wine wine wineboot\n\n\nA: I was running into the same issue. \nType WINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX=~/.wine winecfg\nIt should start to download the drivers necessary. I believe this issue is due to a problem occurring during the normal download. For me it my internet dropped as it was originally downloading the drivers.\n\nA: Test if you already have multiarch enabled:\ndpkg --print-foreign-architectures | grep -q i386 && sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\nThen install wine32:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install wine32\nAnd finally, don't delete your 64-bit wine install.  just rename it to .wine64 then create a new .wine folder for your 32-bit apps:\nmv ~/.wine ~/.wine64 && WINEARCH=win32 wineboot\n\nA: To create a 32-bit WINE prefix on a 64-bit Ubuntu system, you need to open a terminal and run the following command:\nWINEPREFIX=\"$HOME/prefix32\" WINEARCH=win32 wine wineboot\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Where WINEPREFIX is the directory for the prefix\n\n*This directory must not already exist or you will get an error! Please do not manually create it in Nautilus or with mkdir./\n\n\nA: Just creating a wine32 prefix/directory (without wine64 prefix/directory) will not work. As was suggested above (but not fully written out) - and if you want to avoid the need to use winecfg (which is annyoing in automation - you need to somehow close it), here is the full solution: create a wine64, then a wine32 directory. If you use winetricks to check it (it gives a warning for wine64 directories), it will report both correctly (wine64 gives the warning, since it's 64, wine32 does not, since it's 32.). The solution;\nrm -Rf ./wine   # carefull, this deletes your entire wine config (fine if you want to start afresh)\n\nWINEPREFIX=~/.wine wineboot\n\n...wait...\nWINEPREFIX=~/.wine32 WINEARCH=win32 wineboot\n\nAfter this, you can:\nWINEPREFIX=~/.wine32 WINEARCH=win32 your_32bit_executable.exe\n\nWINEPREFIX=~/.wine WINEARCH=win64 your_64bit_executable.exe\n\n\nA: After erasing .wine32, installing the .NET 4.0 with the command $ WINEPREFIX=~/.wine32 winetricks dotnet40, worked for me. \nkudos Antonio\n\nA: handy shell .rc snippet\nalias wine32='WINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX=~/.win32 wine'\nalias wine64='WINEARCH=win64 WINEPREFIX=~/.win64 wine'\nwin32() {\n    export WINEARCH=win32\n    export WINEPREFIX=~/.win32\n}\nwin64() {\n    export WINEARCH=win64\n    export WINEPREFIX=~/.win64\n}\n\n", "Q: Won't boot after installing Ubuntu 12.04 sucessfully I installed 12.04 successfully and rebooted (I took out my installation CD), and selected the newly installed Linux partition to boot from rEFIt. Then it just comes up with this error message:\n\nError loading operating system\n\nwhich could not be more vague. Take that back. I guess it could say just \"error.\" I don't even get to the boot prompt which limits what I can do. I cannot boot into rescue mode. I tried boot-repair, but it took more than 24 hours to check the system configuration, so I gave up on that.\nI'm running a Mac Mini with its main OS being Mac OS X 10.5.8. I have an alternate OS Windows XP installed, which was virtually destroyed by this Linux installation. I sacrificed my working, speedy Windows partition for something that won't even boot up. What was I thinking. My Mac partition is slow as crap.\nI've tried installing 12.04 many times with two different disks. The first time, I had one partition for Linux, then I had 2 (swap+main), then 3 (swap, main and BIOS), then 4 which is what I have now (swap, main, BIOS, and boot/grub). \nThe only way I could get through the install without GRUB giving up was if I created a separate partition for it. Which was pointless, because it did install successfully, but it still doesn't boot up at all. \nCould rEFIt be booting off of the BIOS or one of the other partitions? Because if that's the case, there is no alternative, because Mac itself without rEFIt refuses to recognize a Linux ext4 (or 2 or 3) format partition. Apple always has to make everything so difficult. If I'm not mistaken, rEFIt is the only application of its kind for Mac.\nI can boot off of the CD back to the install/try screen.\nThis is extremely upsetting, can you guys help? Please?\n\nA: I had the same problem. Below are the steps I used to solve it:\n\n\n*\n\n*I changed BIOS setting to default.\n\n*Format \"Linux Partition\" and \"Swap\" using the Ubuntu live CD.\n\n*I changed the boot device to \"Linux Partition\"\n\n*Rebooted the machine, and removed the CD.\n\n*I ran the update to 12.04\n\n\nHope you can do the same.\n", "Q: apparmor-notify exclude application Is there a way to exclude certain applications from apparmor-notify notifications. e.g. I don't want to receive any apparmor notifications from firefox but I'd like to receive notifications about the other applications.\n\nA: It is not possible at this time. But it has been added as one of the possible features that could be added in the future in the apparmor roadmap.\nAn alternate solution is to \"fix\" the Firefox profile so that you no longer get denial messages from it.\nYou can update a profile using the aa-genprof utility using\nsudo aa-genprof /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.firefox\n\nand follow the prompts/answer the questions.\nAlternately you can manually edit the file using a text editor\nsudo nano /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.firefox\n\nyou can add new permissions to the profile by adding the path and access mode and then saving the file. If you do not wish to extend the profile permissions for an access that is being denied and you want to quiet the denied messages you can add a deny rule to the profile, this lets apparmor know that this is a known denial and you do not wish to extend permissions to include the object.\nEg. If you receive a message for\nw access to /home/foo/file\n\nYou would add a profile rule of\ndeny /home/foo/file w,\n\nSave the profile file and then load the revised profile into the kernel by doing\nsudo /etc/init.d/apparmor restart\n\nor, to reload just the specific Firefox profile, assuming that's the one you edited, run\nsudo apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.firefox  \n\n", "Q: Triple Boot Windows 7/ Windows 8 RTM/ Ubuntu What is the best way to triple boot Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows 8 Professional RTM, and  the latest version of Ubuntu? I already have Windows 7 and Windows 8 installed. I am currently downloading Ubuntu. I don't want to lose either of my OS's. Thanks for any help. :)  \n\nA: Here's how to do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure it will not go beyond the 4 primary partitions, otherwise, your PC will not boot up.\n\n*You can make extra partitions with the Gparted tool, but it will not aloww more than 4 primary partitions, (more extended parititions are allowed )\n\n*After making the sufficient space for Windows 8 then \n\n*Install Windows 8 \n\n*Now you notice that only Windows 7 and 8 are listed in Windows' boot loader \n\n*Now you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*add Ubuntu in Windows' boot loader by using easyBCD\n\n*Reinstall grub 2 by with a live CD. to see video  click here \nAfter this if your windows in not listed in grub 2 then type sudo update-grub2\nEven if Windows is not listed retry after mounting your Windows drive \nHave a look at this video for updating grub2\n\nA: My machine also runs Windows 7, Windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.10. Ubuntu is one I installed the last, and GRUB2 automatically list all my other OS, so I don't have any boot problems.\nBut, if you want to use Windows 8 GUI bootloader, you can download EasyBCD and set it up from there. Windows 8 GUI bootloader boots Windows 8 faster (since it actually just a hybrid-boot), while selecting Windows 7 or Ubuntu (from the Windows 8 GUI bootloader) makes your computer restart and boot to your selected OS.\n", "Q: Why aren't file properties shown for MP4 files?

I'm a first time user of Linux, I got the blue screen of death one to many times on an old laptop, a Dell D620, so I went for 12.04 and removed Windows, but now I can't get online at all.\nWe all use a Huawei E5830 WI-Fi as our only Internet access, but my wireless card won't work now with Ubuntu, is there a way to install the Huawei W5830 and connect through USB as with Windows? How can I get my wireless card to work? I also have a HUAWEI E1550 dongle that I can't get to work, I am looking for the easiest way to get back online.\nIf anybody can help me it would be amazing.\nThe card is Broadcom Corporation BCM4311.\n\nA: On your Ubuntu live media, you have the firmware cutter package, which you can use on a Broadcom Windows driver (bcmwl5.sys) from the wireless card install CD-ROM.\nThe location of b43-fwcutter package is:\n/pool/main/b/b43-fwcutter/b43-fwcutter/b43-fwcutter_012-1build1_i386.deb\n\ncopy it to your home directory off the distribution media.\nInstall the b43-fwcutter package, and you should have the b43-fwcutter program installed in /usr/bin for you to run.  (If you can manage to get a wired connection, you will be offered the option to just download the appropriate Broadcom driver to run through the fwcutter).\nRun it on the Windows driver bcmwl5.sys file, probably in an empty directory to make copying the .fw files easier.  The b43-fwcutter will \"cut\" out all the firmware files needed from the Broadcom driver.  Copy all the .fw files into /lib/firmware/b43, and you should see network-manager pick up the card.  Use sudo mkdir /lib/firmware/b43 and\nsudo cp *.fw /lib/firmware/b43 to move the files.\nThis firmware is all that the b43 driver needs to run on your 4311 chip.  Since you haven't been connected to the Internet, you probably didn't manage to install any Broadcom drivers which would blacklist the b43 driver, so it should run automatically as soon as the firmware is supplied.

I can't see any obvious duplicates in the process list:\n$ ps -A | grep 'gno\\|org\\|nau'\n27439 tty7     00:00:18 Xorg\n27610 ?        00:00:00 gnome-keyring-d\n27621 ?        00:00:00 gnome-session\n27674 ?        00:00:00 gnome-settings-\n27709 ?        00:00:07 gnome-panel\n27720 ?        00:00:00 gnome-fallback-\n27726 ?        00:00:04 nautilus\n27736 ?        00:00:00 polkit-gnome-au\n28281 ?        00:00:00 gnome-screensav\n29016 ?        00:00:00 gnome-terminal\n29021 ?        00:00:00 gnome-pty-helpe\n\nIf it helps, I was recently trying the Nouveau drivers but have now reverted to NVIDIA.  Configuration is Separate X Window, Xinerama enabled.  Unity is fine, so the problem is limited to the Classic desktop.\nI haven't had any luck googling these particular symptoms so any tips would be really appreciated.

However, now I can dim the screen but I cannot get it all the way up again!. Is it perhaps related to something different than bumblebee? (I do not know)\nAny idea please please?\n\nA: Turn off optimus and run discrete graphics only. That seems to work for me using my lenovo W520.\n\nA: I found another workaround that works. It is a little script that somebody wrote for Archlinux but works the same:\nhttps://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1148019#p1148019\nBefore this, I could only dim the screen. Now (using the terminal) I can light it up again :-)) Very happy!\nIn any case, I would like to know how to \"embedd\" this in the system, I mean, how can I modify ubuntu brithness control so that it makes the same that the script.

Which is a flash/web based video conferencing system.\nWebcam Studio will allow you to choose both live and pre-recorded media, and enrich it with effects which includes animations, text, and further more.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How can I install a driver for an Intel 82573 Gigabit ethernet card? I recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my computer, The only problem so far is there is no Internet connection. I believe that's due to missing drivers which are difficult to install without Internet. So I am hoping some one can help me find the drivers I need and give me some tips on installing the drivers.\nThe Motherboard is an Intel® D975XBX2 and the Ethernet is a Intel® 82573E/82573L Gigabit Ethernet Controller\nI tried installing the Linux drivers from here.\nExcept when I tried to run rpmbuild, like I was told to do in the readme it said it wasn't installed.\n\nA: This guide is a little old, but your card may be a mess made by Intel and never fixed:\nhttp://thesorcerer.wordpress.com/2011/07/01/guide-intel-82573l-gigabit-ethernet-with-ubuntu-11-04-and-fix-pxe-e05/\n", "Q: Can I test the physical memory of a VPS or virtual machine? Is there a memory test program I can run on an online VPS hosted instance?\nSince it is a VPS I don't have access to the console or the memtest grub option.\nI am troubleshooting random crashes (with no logging) and need to rule out memory issues.\n\nA: Unless you have access to the physical host which the VPS or virtual machine is running on, the answer is no, unfortunately.\nIf you really suspect memory corruption may be an issue, ask your host to move the VPS to a different physical host. If it continues, then it's most probably a software issue.\n", "Q: Ubuntu wireless problem I have just installed the latest version of Ubuntu on my Toshiba L655. I have never used Linux before this, so I do not know much about it. \nWhen I try to connect to my hidden wireless network, I put the password encryption as WPA/WPA2 PSK Personal and put my password in. It tries to connect to it for 30 seconds to one minute then I get a window that pops up saying something along the lines of (not looking at it, laptop is off charging) \"this network requires password or encryption code authorization\". I put the same password in that I set it to origionally. It begins doing its thing again trying to connect and a few seconds later it pops up again, and again, and again. I do not have any encryption codes or other passwords etc. What should I do?\nThanks, any suggestions will really help!\n\nA: did you set an admin password? Sometimes it asks you for that first so you might be putting your wireless username into your ubuntu admin without realizing. I should stress, that it depends on your settings. It could be something else but that is the first thing you probably should look at.\nIf that does not solve it, I would plug the laptop into the network with a cable and update yourself and see if that does anything for you.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 freezing upon CD/DVD installation at \"installing system\" First off, I have a very old computer. I feel it necessary to point out that it has a Pentium 4 processor, I believe 768 MB of RAM, and about 30 GB total on the hard drive. Now, onto my predicament...\nI was recently running Windows XP on my computer. It kept having some issues, so I tried Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit. I put in the CD/DVD, and the installation was working fine until it got to \"installing system\". It froze there for about 3-3 1/2 hours. I figured something must've been wrong, because a computer couldn't be THAT slow. I then took out the CD/DVD and tried again. The same exact thing happened; froze at \"installing system\".\nCould this be an issue with my computer? I did some research and read that others have managed to run it on a Celeron processor (which is older than a Pentium). Others have also said that a computer similar to mine could run Ubuntu 12.04 quite smoothly.\nPlease help, Trevis/Twistedstar\nPS.

The code uses 2 dependencies (Cairographics and FFTW3). I have installed both of them using ./configure, make and  make install in directory $HOME/prefix/ (following the instruction given here How to install Cairo 1.8.10 )\nNow I have in this directory 4 folders, namely bin, include, lib and share\nThe make file of the code requires specifying the dependencies' directory. Like that\nINC := -I$HOME/prefic/include\nLIB := -L$HOME/prefic/lib\n\nWhen I compile the code, I set the environment variables as\nexport PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/prefic/lib/pkgconfig\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/prefic/lib\n\nand then use make.

Could someone help please.\nThe psa code I'm trying to compile is here http://code.google.com/p/psa/downloads/list\n\nA: I think you need to move the libraries to the end of the command line (in your Makefile: place $(LIB) after $(OBJS)). The linker flag --as-needed is activated by default since Ubuntu 11.10. This makes the linker sensitive to the ordering of libraries on the command-line.\nBy the way: I don't know if you already know that, but you don't need to install Cairo and FFTW3 from source.\nYou can install the dependencies with the package management system:\nsudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev libfftw3-dev\n\nThen you have to change the following two lines in the Makefile:\nINC := -I/usr/include\nLIB := -L/usr/lib\n\n", "Q: How do I clear a log file that is currently in use?

It is the user that Apache runs as, and the whole point is that www-user has reduced privileges, and doesn't own the files or have permissions to change them.\nThe actual owner should be either you or root, I believe, so www-data will then have read-only privileges, not rwx.\nDid you create a link in /var to /home/richardmandx/Dropbox/www?  I don't understand why you'd do that.  What I do for my personal test server is to simply create the virtual server in ~/www, by editing /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default, and either change /var/www to /home/me/www, or add more virtual servers in whatever directories I want to use.\nEdits:\nIf this is a home server without general outside access, I think it's easiest for developing to change the local server from /var/www (owned by root) to your home directory/www, or something similar.  You could probably just as well change the owner of /var/www from root to yourself, giving r-- permissions for group/others.  This is the normal permissions when root is owner.\nMaking yourself the owner makes it much easier to edit files, as you won't need to copy back and forth, or use sudo. Another option is to mount /var/www in a directory you own, but you might need to give extra options for the permissions.  This is probably easier than it might sound.\nIf you do have outside access, you would probably do best to leave things as they are normally set up.  I have a clean, default server on a test 12.04 VM, set up using the standard install, which works fine.  /var/www is owned by root, with permissions 'drwxr-xr-xfor the directory, and-rw-r---r--` for the files.  There is no www-data shown anywhere, as it should be, if my understanding is correct.  You don't want outsiders to have to many permissions, so www-data is a limited user for Apache that meets that requirement.  It has less authority than you do.\nIf you want to use your home directory, then the simplest, cleanest way is to edit /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default, and change all (or at least the innermost) occurrences of /var/www to whatever directory you choose, and then restart Apache.  You can add any number of virtual web sites to the inner part of configuration, similar to this one, with any name you want and a matching directory.  I create sites with a name like \"mysite.dev\", and on any machine that accesses it, I make an entry in /etc/hosts with something like 192.168.1.111  mysite.dev.  Apache will then take that name, look it up to get the directory for the virtual site, and open it.\n", "Q: Black screen on login, can get thru decrypt disk and access command line but no GUI Running 12.04 64 bit fresh alternative install, with disk crypto on a new Lenovo laptop\nInstall didn't connect and install modules, even though I had the network cable plugged in and don't have any whacky proxy settings.

(open a terminal\n**\ncd /var/log\nsudo rm uvcdynctrl-udev.log\n\n**\n)\nBelieve me, you wont miss this package.\n\nA: If you copied and pasted the system files, manually reproducing them, then you should provide more information about what you did to copy and paste them, where you pasted them, anything you can remember. Even making an extra copy of all the system files on your machine is unlikely to cause anywhere near 100 GB of disk usage. Ubuntu requires less than 5 GB of available space to be installed, and even an Ubuntu system with many packages installed is unlikely for its system files to take up more than several times that size. You would probably have to make many copies to take up that much space. Or perhaps you copied files other than system files?\nIf your Ubuntu system has expanded by itself (from log files and updates‽) to take up 100 GB of space (or 50 GB of space), just in system files (as opposed to your documents, pictures, videos, virtual machines, and so forth), something is very wrong. The three most likely general causes of this are probably:\n\n\n*\n\n*This is not really happening, and you have misinterpreted information that your system has provided you. (Please note that I am not telling you that you are mistaken; if you know how you came to have 100 GB of system files, then neither this nor the other two suggested causes below is correct.)\n\n*There is a bug, which affects your system, and which causes used and free space to be reported incorrectly.\n\n*There is a pretty serious bug, which affects your system, and which causes files (perhaps log files in /var/log) to grow at an extremely high rate and without bound.\n\n\nAs Sergey has said, indiscriminately deleting all files that have the same contents will quite likely cause damage to your system. For example, there are a number of blank files that might exist in your system and are used as locks or to signify some condition. You may also have programs that contain separate copies of identical files (when the files provide the same functionality for both programs, which has not been removed to a separate library or package).\nYou can probably get it to delete the \"duplicate\" files by running it as root. But you should really not do that--it will likely wreak grave harm on your Ubuntu system.\nYou asked in a comment:\n\nIS there anyway to command fdupes to delete all the duplicates without asking or notifying me?\n\nfdupes -f might do what you want. See the fdupes manpage. But you should really not do this.\nInstead, you should figure out what is going on. If you want us to help you with that, we certainly will. If you expand your question to explain that you want help figuring out what's taking up space, then you'll either get answers providing that information, or this may be closed as a duplicate of another question that provides information about how to find that out. (Either situation would be likely to benefit you.) Of course, this is assuming you want us to help you find the cause of your system taking up so much space (or seeming to).\nThe first step to investigate this is to examine (and post, by editing your question) the output of these commands, which provide detailed information about what disks you have and how much space is free on them:\nmount\ndf -h\nsudo du -sh /*\n\nYou can run those commands in a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T). The last command will take a while. You may also get some Permission denied errors (even though you're running it as root), mostly regarding .gvfs folders in users' home directories. That's nothing to worry about.\n\nA: I have a quick and dirty solution(definitely prevent log file writing, but doesn't solve the root problem):\nthis log file is written by /lib/udev/uvcdynctrl\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup original sudo cp /lib/udev/uvcdynctrl /lib/udev/uvcdynctrl_backup\n\n*Edit original   gksu gedit /lib/udev/uvcdynctrl\n\n*Look up all elements that are in such form \"debug=1\"\n\n*Change to \"debug=0\"\n\n*Delete the log file once and for all sudo rm /var/log/uvcdynctrl-udev.log\n\nA: Go into the Terminal(short cut is Ctrl+Alt+t) and type:\ngksudo nautilus\n\nThis will open Nautilus with root permissions. Now delete your files.\nHope this helps you!\n\nA: 1. Step: Find out what problem you actually have\nWhen your filesystem is unexpectedly full, there are a lot of possible causes. See Eliah Kagan's answer for some more about this. In the vast majority of cases it should be easy to identify (and eventually repair) the real cause, so reformatting/reinstalling would not be necessary.\nSo the first step is to find out, what exactly is the problem, i.e., where has the missing space gone. So first execute\ndf -hl -x tmpfs -x devtmpfs\n\nThis shows a list of all the used partitions of the disks in your machine, their size, how full they are and their mount point. From this list, take the one which you think is too full and note its mount point. In your case, it is the root file system which is mounted at /.\nNow we analyze where inside this file system the space is used. Execute\n sudo du -xhsc /* 2> /dev/null\n\n(Replace / with the mount point identified above.)\nIt needs sudo because not all directories might be readable for your user. It may take some time (especially on large file systems) because it needs to visit every single directory on them.\nWhat this command does is to show you each file and directory inside the given directory together with its size (including subdirectories).\nSo from this list take the one(s) which you think is larger than it should be, and call the command again on this directory. (That is, run the command again, but with the name of a big directory from a previous listing replacing /.)\nFor example, in your case it was clear /var was the only big directory, so you would need to execute\n sudo du -xhsc /var/* 2> /dev/null\n\nContinue with these steps until you have either found a single file which is so big, or you have found a directory with lots of files that together take up all that space.\nIn your case the next step was to execute\n sudo du -xhsc /var/log/* 2> /dev/null\n\nbecause /var/log was so big, and this showed you that there was a single log file named uvcdynctrl-udev.log with 174GB (which is obviously bad).\n2. Step: Identify why the files are there and why they are so big\nNow we need to find out why the identified are there, or why they are so big, if they are expected to be there.\nIn your case, a log file in /var/log is nothing suspicious, but its size surely is. Fortunately, a Google search simply with the file name brings up the following bug report as the first hit, which is clearly the same problem as we have:  http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libwebcam/+bug/811604\n3. Step: Solve the problem\nIn this case, a log file of some webcam-related stuff seems not to be interesting, so we can easily delete it with the command sudo rm /var/log/uvcdynctrl-udev.log and free all the space.\nUnfortunately, the bug report is still open, and there are no solutions or workarounds in the comments, so you probably have to live with this bug for now. You can delete the log file from time to time to free some space.\n\nA: I think the best thing here is to just reinstall, considering the apparent amount of damage, the fact it's fairly unclear what's actually happened, and your low comfort level in manually repairing it.  \nPreserve your home directory (do not reformat or repartition) and reinstall and that should clear out the system directories.\n", "Q: How do I install a driver provided as source code? I have a USB-to-LAN converter, and downloaded the its drivers. The driver folder consists of a Makefile file, a .c file and a .h file. \nHow do I install such a driver?\n\nA: *\n\n*Open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T\n\n*Install the build-essential package with:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\n*Change the directory to the extracted driver folder; suppose it's under your home directory as Downloads/driversource, with:\ncd ~/Downloads/driversource\n\n*Type make && sudo make install\nThis should build and install the driver.

I didn't actually know that there was a specific place to put custom icons (or precisely, where it was XD).  I do know, however, that when I made custom icons for my BURG install (using Lightness) I just stuck them in with the rest of the icons under /boot/burg/themes/Lightness/somewhere and changed the file in there that came along with it (the changes you made, I think).\nTL:DR Try making those text changes in the theme-specific folder instead in addition if applicable.\n\nA: I think the issue is that the class needs to be declared. I am working on this myself as I run pearOS and it is not recognized in burg so the icon is just a question mark. This article shows some of the steps required but I think not all. I'll post again if I get this figured out!\n\nA: You have to take special care how you save the icons using gimp. burg is very picky about the png's it supports. Make sure you untick all checkboxes when exporting your png's.\nHere you have the files I created for my xbmc class which are working for me.\n", "Q: How to fix severe libqt4 package dependency problems?

In such a case, you want to prevent against ungraceful termination (i.e. interrupt, or SIGTERM during system shutdown), so create a function to restore normal behavior and use trap <function> 0 (for bash-type shells) to catch exits and apply the restoration functions.\n\nA: To disable the automatic screen lock in Ubuntu 14.10 Gnome, these are the necessary steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the application \"Settings\"\n\n*Choose \"Privacy\" under the \"Personal\" heading\n\n*Choose \"Screen Lock\"\n\n*Toggle \"Automatic Screen Lock\" from the default \"ON\" to \"OFF\"\n\n\nTo make this answer more useful as a Google search result for common search terms such as \"disable lock screen ubuntu\" (how I found this page), I've added this answer to extend the context of this page to include the steps to disable the automatic screen lock in Ubuntu 14.10 Gnome.  System Settings (called simply \"Settings\" in Ubuntu 14.10 Gnome) are organized slightly differently within Ubuntu 14.10 Gnome than as described by the answer listed above, requiring a different user flow.  \n\nA: Only caffeine extension worked for me in Ubuntu 19.04 to disable automatic screen lock and have manual locking still working.\nThis is disable locking screen alltogether, so is not good:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.lockdown disable-lock-screen 'true'\n\n\nA: Consider this dialog:\n\nthis is not essentially a screensaver but it serves same function.\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to System Settings...Brightness and Lock:\n\n\n*The default screensaver idle time is 10 minutes, and the screen is locked once the screensaver activates:\n\n\n*You can adjust the idle time (or disable the screensaver), and also disable the lock:\n\n\n*Simply close Brightness and Lock to apply the new settings.\n\nA: If the unity gui doesn't work, then you could try using xset\nOpen a terminal and type:\nxset s off\n\nTo also prevent the display from blanking and to prevent the monitor's DPMS energy saver from kicking in, add the following:\nxset s noblank\nxset -dpms\n\nAlso try some things here:\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Display_Power_Management_Signaling#xset_screen-saver_control\n\nA: For me on kubuntu 16.04 (plasma) I have to go to System Settings -> Workspace -> Desktop Behavior -> Screen Locking -> turn off 'Lock screen automatically after'\nOn kubuntu 18.04 I find, K-menu -> Settings -> System Settings -> etc (see above).\n\nA: On Ubuntu 16.04 you have to go to System Settings -> Screensavers and switch to Settings tab:\n\nOver there you can disable several types of locking.\n\nA: Yet another potentially useful solution, along the lines of caffeine, is xssproxy. From its description in synaptic:\n\nFor example Firefox uses the org.freedesktop.ScreenSave\n  D-Bus interface to disable the screensaver when playing videos. This package\n  implements that interface and disables the X built-in screensaver in that\n  case.\n\nLike with caffeine, you'll need to run it when your X session starts.\n\nA: I found that this works on Ubuntu 18:\n# Configure dconf to disable screen lock\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/dconf/profile/\nsudo tee /etc/dconf/profile/user <<EOF\nuser-db:user\nsystem-db:local\nEOF\n\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/dconf/db/local.d/\nsudo tee /etc/dconf/db/local.d/10disable-lock <<EOF\n[org/gnome/desktop/session]\nidle-delay=uint32 0\nEOF\n\nsudo dconf update\n\n", "Q: After kernel upgrade, unable to boot with / on lvm I did a kernel upgrade on my desktop system from 2.6.32-41 to 2.6.32-42 using apt-get dist-upgrade.

(As I found from previous experience that the automatic update trashes the existing entires!)

Has anyone else experienced this?

Then click Close.\n\nThat should fix the problem. Unless it was already checked. In that case, or if you know that you're also unable to install packages from the Main component (which is virtually always enabled, and you can see if it is in the same way), try the fix proposed in r000000000000t's answer.\nOnce this is fixed and you're able to install codeblocks and vlc, go ahead and install aircrack-ng using one of the methods detailed in the answers here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can't install aircrack-ng\n", "Q: Can't run or install ubuntu from USB (worked on another computer) \nPossible Duplicate:\n“Kernel error, try with noapic option” displayed when installing Ubuntu \n\nI'm sorry if this has been mentioned before, but I couldn't find anything on google about my specific error, so here goes...\nI've earlier prepared a live USB via UNetBootin with ubuntu 12.04 (64-bit) and could use it to both run ubuntu from the USB as well as installing on my laptop, which I did a few days ago. \nThe laptop is a Lenovo R500 running 64 bit Windows 7 (and now also Ubuntu)\nHowever when I try to do the same on my stationary computer (An Acer Aspire M3641 running Windows Vista 32 bit), I can't get past the UNetBootin splash screen. \nWhichever option I choose, say for example \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" only brings up a flashing underscore at the bottom of the screen. (the options are still visible) This is what I remember happening from my laptop too (briefly before starting ubuntu), but here it never gets past this point, it just keeps flashing.\nI suspect that the USB in some way disconnects from the computer as the light a few seconds after doing this turns off.\nI did find somewhere a solution for problems with nVidia cards which suggested adding a parameter \"nomodeset\". I could not find the menu mentioned, but I did once by mistake stumble upon a single line containing the key words \"silent splash\", (the same \">something....\" as what [tab] brings up, but with different text) so I tried adding nomodeset and pressed enter. \nThis actually seemed to start booting Ubuntu, although with a more simple look than usual. It displayed a screen with 4? dots and then from what it seemed, started loading system resources, listing them on the screen. I don't know the exact phrasing, but it stopped, displaying a massage along the lines of \"medium not found\". (Medium for loading system resources perhaps, I don't remember.)\nI tried to burn a Live CD on my laptop, but it failed when it was almost done. I'm not sure why it failed, if it was too big (it says that it's 698 MB, so it should work) or another reason, but I don't feel like wasting CD's, so I've waited with trying that again. (I did by the way md5sum the iso)\nAlso as a final note, I did also make sure beforehand that the Acer supported 64 bit. If there is anything else you need to know, just tell me.\nThanks in advance for any help. :)\n\nI'm apparently not able to comment because I didn't have an account when I wrote the question, so I'll have to comment with an answer instead. (I have an account now tough)\n\n\n*\n\n*The computer is a few years old, so most likely USB 3.0 didn't exists when it was made. \n\n*I should have mentioned it in the original question, but I've already tried with three different USB sticks. Two (32 & 64 bit) via UNetBootin's automatic download, and one (64 bit) through downloading an iso file. Some people seemed to be having troubles with SanDisk U3 sticks, so I also made sure that the third was of another brand.\n\nI've now tried the alternate version on USB. It seems to freeze at the language select screen, again with the USB turning off the light. (This however seems to happen before the language screen has appeared) I will investigate some more... \n\nI've now also tried the alternate version via CD. (I made sure to md5sum the disc btw)\nRunning it from a CD, the GUI is different than from the USB. The first thing that appears is a language select screen. After choosing language, there's a purple screen with 5 options, (now in my native language):\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu\n\n*Test disk for defects\n\n*Memory test\n\n*Boot from primary hard drive\n\n*Recover broken system\n\n\nUsing the first option, (after ~20 sec of black screen) I get to a screen of the same style as the language screen from running the USB. However, this seems to be regional settings instead. Again, it freezes like with the USB.\nI tried the second option. After a minute of black screen, I get a purple screen followed by a warning that says: \n\"Your installation disc could not be mounted. This probably means that the cd wasn't in the tray. In that case you can insert it and try again.\nTry to mount cd again?\", followed by Yes/No buttons. It's however already frozen, so it's not possible to do either of them.\nI also tried the memory test just to see if it worked and it didn't freeze.\nVia F6, I do have access to this list of options, which I haven't yet tried out.\nI might also try with english if that makes any difference. \n\nA: *\n\n*Plug in the flash drive in an USB 2.0 port and try again (if you've been using USB 3.0 port).\n\n*If that fails, try making a Live USB with 32-bit Ubuntu and boot.\n\n\nA: Try using the text-based installer. It always works. You can download it here: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/alternative-downloads. You can also put it on a USB. It's also known as \"Alternate Install CD\".\n\nA: I got it working now. Turns out that it was a keyboard issue. I got it working by including the parameters \"noapic\" and \"apci=off\" as suggested in another thread.\n\nA: The thread referred to by noapic and apci=off seems to be this - this is indeed the way I am going to go:\n\"Kernel error, try with noapic option\" displayed when installing Ubuntu\n", "Q: What is the best minimal http server? If I want to serve some static content over http from Ubuntu, with an emphasis on security and efficiency (at low-moderate load), what's the best choice?\n\nA: We are using micro-httpd for this purpose.\nIt is very small and started by inetd for every single request, so it is only good for low-load environments, but it does what we need it do to. The only configuration options are the directory to be served and the port to listen on. For SSL/HTTPS support, stunnel would be used (a wrapper between unencrypted and ssl-encrypted connections).\nSome more information from the man page:\n\nIt implements all the basic\n     features of an HTTP server, including:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Security against \"..\" filename snooping.\n  \n*The common MIME types.\n  \n*Trailing-slash redirection.\n  \n*index.html\n  \n*Directory listings.\n  \n\n\nA: Apache is very secure and extremely efficient at serving static content, especially at low-to-moderate load. It is also only an apt-get away, no additional configuration needed.\nIs there anything which makes you to look for another web server?\n\nA: Very common are Lighttpd and Nginx.\nThey are very alike and bear similar features and both support PHP if needed.\nLighttpd runs as a single process but with a single thread and non-blocking I/O,\nwhere as Nginx works as one master process but delegates its work unto worker processes.\n", "Q: No sound using Asus xonar DGX I've just bought a new sound card, Asus xonar DGX, and it works perfectly in Windows 7. \nHowever, when I load up 12.04, I get no sound whatsoever.

However, it works with kernel 3.5 or with alsa driver 1.0.26 (which isn't released yet). I have the same soundcard and I guess we'll have to wait either for updates for ubuntu 12.04 or wait for the next distro of Ubuntu, quantal, that will support the soundcard, since it will use kernel 3.5.\nCheers\n\nA: Add the X-Swat Backports QTS PPA and install the Quantal kernel which is regularly updated.

It would have been fine as a server, but you obviously want to use it as a desktop, otherwise, why have all the desktop components. \nI'd suggest, either upgrading to 12.04 (can be done directly from 10.04), or experimenting with backported kernels. For example, to get the latest backported server kernel from Oneric, install the linux-image-server-lts-backport-oneiric package, or, for the latest desktop one linux-image-generic-lts-backport-oneiric.\nNewer kernels should provide better support for newer Intel graphics.\n", "Q: Are there any instant-messaging clients for server?

Now yor file system gets checked as it would regularly.  \nFor the record:\nTo change or disable regular file system checks, use tune2fs, e.g.\ntune2fs -c 0 -i 0 /dev/sda1\n\nto disable checking /dev/sda1 after x mounts as well as time-dependent checking. It's also possible to edit /etc/fstab and set the last digit after a fs entry to 0, e.g.\n/dev/sda1 /home ext4 defaults 1 2\n\nto\n/dev/sda1 /home ext4 defaults 1 0\n\n", "Q: No VPN is running.

I downloaded ubuntu 12.04 and installed it on my old laptop with 512MB ram, 1.66 ghz processor on a partition of size 10GB( with windows xp on another partition.) Now when I boot to linux it shows Lubuntu at the start screen(which i found out is a lighter version or something, may be because of low specs) . \nNow when I run ubuntu and try to browse 5-6 tabs on firefox it starts getting sluggish. Do I need to switch to an older version of Ubuntu or is there any other fix to this?? \nThanks in advance!! \n\nA: That is because of you low RAM. Starting tab of firfox takes 100-150mb. From second onwards it takes addition 50-75mb RAM. You have a low RAM. Shortage of RAM causes this problem. You can overcome this by assigning a new Swap area. This can be better explained in this link.\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.04 uses Unity as  the Desktop Environment (DE). With your 512 ram you should use ONLY Lubuntu which uses LXDE as DE. It is the lightest of the Ubuntu family. (See here.)\nBut the fact that it shows Lubuntu at the start screen might not mean necessarily  that you are logging into the LXDE/Lubuntu desktop. It happened to me to see the Lubuntu screen when I chose no matter what DE. So be sure that is LXDE/Lubuntu you chose upon logging in.\n\nA: You can try:\n- Ubuntu with low-end customization:lightDM, ubuntu-2D, no effect\n- Lubuntu\n- Xubuntu\n", "Q: How to make a drive NTFS from EXT4?

I have created another upper panel and customized it as I need but my minimized windows are not displaying there either.\nHow can I sort my Panel?\n\nA: If that is the total contents of your panel then you need to add a \"Task Bar(Window List)\" from your Panel Preferences.

Today I tested something in 12.04. I have Automatic login enabled with password. So When I login a window pops up asking for the password. But I tested the following. I clicked cancel twice in the pop up window so the window disappears for a while then I opened my Mozilla Firefox browser I went straight to Edit > Preferences > Saved passwords. I clicked show passwords and Voilá I had access all my account passwords without logging into  Ubuntu. \nIs this a bug or what? Is there a solution to make Ubuntu like in windows when a login screen comes up, I type my password than I access my desktop. It looks like that in Ubuntu the desktop and my files aren't blocked. Is there a solution to block everything while I type the password.  \n\nA: The idea of Automatic Login is that it will not ask you for passwords during login. But anything that requires root user (aka admin) privileges, will not be possible and will still ask you for password confirmation. (Such installing new software, updating the system, etc...)\nThe password manager in Firefox has nothing to do with your Ubuntu account password. It only saves the passwords you save for websites.\nAs a suggestion, do not use the same password for everything. And if you want to type your password during login, you need to disable the automatic login.\nGo into the User Accounts, in the top right there will be a Unlock button, click it and type your password and then disable the Automatic Login.\n\nA: You can go insto System Settings, User Accounts and turn off automatic login in your account, then you'll be shown lightDM Loging Manager everytime you boot your Ubuntu instalation\n", "Q: How to recover or create deleted 'Documents' folder in Home folder?

I upgraded to 11.10, this worked just fine.  The install ran through to the end, and then everything booted up okay.\nThen I upgraded straight away to 12.04.  Or I tried to.

I would like to set a shortcut for the Run-Command in Kubuntu 12.04, where the shortcut key would be the Win key (aka Meta).\nThe Global Keyboard Shortcut settings however does not allow me to use the Meta key alone, but rather in combination with some other key.\nAs a keyboard-power-user, I find this frustrating: I want to open-search as fast as possible and the Win key is a perfect candidate, which I used to use with Gnome or XFCE.\nIs there a possibility to override this rule preventing me from using the Meta key alone as a shortcut key?\n\nA: Meta key can't be used as a shortcut alone, because Qt, and therefore KDE, uses it only as a modifier.\nBut you can set it to some two-key shortcut that you like. Go to Global Keyboard Shortcuts – KDE Control Module, look for something like KRunner or Command Run Interface in KDE component and change the Alt+F2 keyboard shortcut to something like Meta+Space.\nAnd if you really want to have it mapped to just the Meta key, I found a solution in this article.

Then you should run the same line in a terminal or just relogin for it to take effect.\nIf you want to do it with different keys, use xev | grep keycode, press the keys and look at the output.\nThen change the shortcut as usual, and when you press the Meta key, it will show up as F13. Note that F13 won't work as a modifier key, so you can't make key combinations with it, and also some applications might need to use the Meta key itself, so that won't work too.\n", "Q: After uninstalling wine some of the free space is 'locked'? I have installed Wine just to play  with it (and installed a game that had approx 7-8 GB) and now I have uninstalled Wine and removed it configs and I am left with these 7-8 GB less free space than I had before. \nI have no idea where this place evaporated since I had like ~~ 8 GB occupied (16 GB free) before the isntallation \nThis will maybe show you what I mean : \n\n\nA: Wine user prefixes are located by default at each user's home in ~/.wine.\nRemove that folder to take back the space Wine took when you installed Windows software.\nTo view the folder open nautilus navigate to your user's home and press Ctrl+<h to display hidden files/folders.\n\nA: Well, you can use Disk Usage Analyzer to find what is taking the space. Also, you can try using locate to find the Wine folder:\nsudo updatedb\nlocate .wine\n\nthis should let you find the location of the .wine folder, then you can delete it.\n\nA: The top line in Disk Usage Analyzer is the root of the file system.  It literally contains everything on the hard drive, so it always reads 100% usage.  You are just misreading the display.\n", "Q: Need to switch back to windows 7. and remove this error to resolve grub: Panic occured, Switching back to text console I am having Acer aspire 4755. I initially had windows7. But tried Ubuntu 12.04. It was working fine. But when I tried to install Windows 7, i got this grub error. I am sure, I must have screwed up the grub file. So when I tried to run a live USB, DVD of Ubuntu back again to install Ubuntu , I got this error: panic occurred, switching back to text console. I even can't install Windows 7 with its starter CD. Kindly help me to remove Ubuntu or remove Grub and get my windows 7 working. I know I have to get the grub working, but how.??\n\n\nA: You can replace Grub with Windows 7 boot-loader, simply boot from Windows 7 installer and rewrite the mbr from the console, or if you are lucky it automatically corrects it.\n", "Q: USB flash drive mount issue I have a 4GB USB flash drive, which used to work fine. Recently, though, my mother had a problem with her HP winXP laptop. She tried to re-install XP using a Dell recovery disk, which would not recognize her laptop's HDD and tried to install onto my USB drive, which was plugged in at the time. She has a new laptop now, but my drive doesn't work: Ubuntu will not recognize it, and Windows only recognizes it but can't mount or partition it. What should I do?\n\nA: First open a terminal with Alt-Ctl-T.\nEnter the command:\nmount\n\nand make a list of which devices are in use.\nEnter the following command to keep an eye on the syslog (log of what is happening on your system from the operating system point of view).\ntail -f /var/log/syslog\n\nNow plug in and remove the flash drive. Make sure of what device it is, and that it's not one of the ones you saw mounted above. It may be something like /dev/sdc. Also see if you see the same device with a number after it, e.g. /dev/sdc1. If you see that your flash drive is being seen by your system.\nAssuming it is not you can format the drive. If /dev/sdm was the drive your flash drive becomes, plug it in once again and enter:\nsudo fdisk /dev/sdm\n\nNow you can partition the device and format those partitions as you desire.\nIf nothing is noted on /var/log/syslog as you plug in the drive and unplug it, it is, indeed, unusable with Ubuntu.\n\nA: I keep on coming across USB drives that can not be mounted or the partition table re-configured.  These are commercially formatted devices that worked fine out of the box but fail completely after adjustments are made to the partition table.  In many cases they work with Windows, but cannot be mounted or successfully formatted under Linux. I come across this most often when trying to make a LiveUSB boot device and the Ubuntu startup disk creator fails with a cryptic error message.\nThe solution is to forcefully remove the partition table by writing zeros to the device.  This can be achieved using dd with the following:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdx bs=512 count=1\n\nWhere the USB drive in question is /dev/sdx\nDo not run this on any drive containing data because it will effectively wipe it - you need to be 100% sure that you are operating on the correct device.\nOnce the partition table has been removed in this way you can make the partition table and partition the device using any program such as Disk Utility, fdisk, cfdisk etc.  Note that \"make the partition table\" is an extra step that will need to be done before the device can be partitioned, and the correct format for this will be \"msdos\".  You can then make ext2/4 or any other type of partition.\nI can recommend Disk Utility as a program that is easy to use, and cfdisk is a quality Linux utility that is menu driven.\n", "Q: Uninstalling unwanted applications In windows, I can see all the programs installed in control panel -> programs and then can uninstall unwanted programs.\nBut in ubuntu 11.04, how can I see such list of installed programs and then uninstall them ?\n\nA: Open the Software Center and click on Installed it will show a menu tree of installed applications.\n\nOpen each menu tree and you can see the program installed, when you click on them they will highlight and tow radio buttons will be visible: More Info and Remove\n\nClick Remove and enter your password and it will remove the app.  \nClick on More Info to get a description of the app. You can then use the back arrow at the upper left to get back to the Installed tab and the previous menu will will still be open and the last selected app still highlighted.\n", "Q: Keyboard Layouts Plugin forgets settings, unable find workaround I use Xubuntu. As everyone knows, Keyboard Layouts Plugin is very, very buggy and it still forgets my settings. It drives me crazy - I have to set them again and again every time I wake up or turn on my laptop.\nSo I found a solution - put into my .bashrc this:\nsetxkbmap -option '' -option grp:alt_shift_toggle cz,us -variant querty\n\nThat should set my toggle to Alt+shift and my layouts to Czech QUERTY and plain US English as a second one. Voilà, that seems to work! I could use Keyboard Layouts Plugin only as an indicator, that's okay.\nHowever, it doesn't work well. The problem is that it ignores -variant setting. More or less. In Keyboard Layouts Plugin I actually see Czech QUERTY selected, but in reality my keyboard types QUERTZ. That's insane :-(\nCould anyone help, please?\n\nA: Well, the right answer is: There is a typo. It's not Q U ERTY, but Q W ERTY! I promise next time I'll ask at the morning, being fresh.\nHowever, until I realized it's typo, I searched and experimented even more and I came up with a different, less hackish solution:\nI found out there is a /etc/default/keyboard file with keyboard settings. If I edit it and then dare to touch Keyboard Layouts Plugin, my changes are preserved even after multiple restarts. No need for any hacks with setxkbmap.\nI edited the file in a following way:\n# Check /usr/share/doc/keyboard-configuration/README.Debian for\n# documentation on what to do after having modified this file.\n\n# The following variables describe your keyboard and can have the same\n# values as the XkbModel, XkbLayout, XkbVariant and XkbOptions options\n# in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.\n\nXKBMODEL=\"pc105\"\nXKBLAYOUT=\"cz,us\"\nXKBVARIANT=\"qwerty\"\nXKBOPTIONS=\"grp:alt_shift_toggle\"\n\n# If you don't want to use the XKB layout on the console, you can\n# specify an alternative keymap.

Open Synaptic or the Ubuntu Software Center (whatever your preference) and install gMTP.  This is a program designed to interface with MTP file system devices like the old Creative Zen MP3 players.  It also works perfectly with the new Kindle Fire HD.  You can view the entire storage area on the Kindle Fire HD, upload, download, and delete files.  Give it a try!\n\nA: Just installing gMTP didn't help me. I had to install libmtp. For step by step instructions, visit, Hooking up a Kindle Fire HD with Ubuntu 12.10 - http://xchamitha.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/hooking-up-kindle-fire-hd-with-ubuntu.html\n\nA: The new Kindle Fires can only be managed via a protocol known as MTP, but you can still mount them.\nFirst make sure you have mtpfs installed.  \nsudo apt-get install mtpfs\n\nThen, since udev and libmtp do not yet know about Kindle Fire do : \nlsusb\n\nMy Kindle Fire HD shows up as \"Bus xxx Device yyy: ID 1949:0007 Lab126\"\nWhat's important is the USB ID.\nNext, add a file to udev to recognize your device:\nsudo vi /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules\n\nAdd this line to the end, substituting your USB IDs you figured out above if they are different:\nSUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"1949\", ATTR{idProduct}==\"0007\", MODE=\"0666\"\n\nConnect your Kindle and look to see if the system found it:\ndmesg\n\nIn the spam you should see something like this:\n...\n[32421.676671] usb 3-1: >new high-speed USB device number 4 using xhci_hcd\n[32421.702240] usb 3-1: >New USB device found, idVendor=1949, idProduct=0007\n[32421.702247] usb 3-1: >New USB device strings: Mfr=2, Product=3, SerialNumber=4\n[32421.702250] usb 3-1: >Product: Kindle\n[32421.702254] usb 3-1: >Manufacturer: Amazon\n[32421.702257] usb 3-1: >SerialNumber: xxx\n...\n\nIf you couldn't find your device with lsusb, you can get the identifiers here too, but when you edit the udev rules you'll have to disconnect and reconnect.\nNow let's make a place to mount it.\nsudo mkdir -p /media/Kindle\nsudo chmod 755 /media/Kindle\n\nAlso, it doesn't hurt to make sure fuse is set up to allow regular users to mount things.\nMake sure /etc/fuse.conf is set up for this:\nsudo vi /etc/fuse.conf\n\nLook for the line that says \"user_allow_other\" and make sure it is uncommented.\nAlmost there! This part will be automatic from now on. All we have to do is mount it now.\nPlug it in and setup the MTP over USB connection by mounting it, like this:\nmtpfs -o allow_other /media/Kindle\n\nBe patient with it, it's not the fastest thing ever. At any rate, once this command completes, you should see a kindle file system in Nautilus, etc.\nWhen you're done using it, for example I load music into /media/Kindle/Internal\\ Storage/Music, or use the ebook tool Calibre,\nsync\nfusermount -u /media/Kindle\n\nI drop these commands into aliases, but you can just as easily add a \"RUN=\" to the udev rule or stuff them into shell scripts.\nI prefer the Android app \"ES File Explorer\" to wander around and look at files on my Kindle... because Kindles are not good at \"auto-discovery\" of new files.\n\nA: I tried and I just removed ext3 from the \nsudo mount -t ext3 /dev/sdb/ /mnt/kindle/\n\nto this:\nsudo mount /dev/sdb/ /mnt/kindle\n\n\nA: You can try using gMTP.

Then I took an image of its ext4 and swap area via dd. However, after a while I decided that I should move this ubuntu to a hard disk instead of the flash disk. I restored my ubuntu on a hard disk via dd by using the image of the ubuntu on the flash disk. The thing is that the flash disk has a capasity of 8GB and there were only 1GB free space and the hard disk has 150GB. However, when I run the ubuntu on that hard disk, it says that there are only 1GB unused and the 99 percentage of the hard disk is used. Why ubuntu ignores the rest of the hard disk's space. Actually, it does not because it says 149GB is used, which means it is aware of the my disk space but in someway it sees the space is used. \n\nA: If you used dd to copy the entire flash disk to the hard drive, then you still have partitions sized appropriately to fit onto an 8GB drive.  You'll need to boot using an Ubuntu CD (instead of into the OS itself), and use the utility gparted to expand the partitions appropriately to fill the drive.\n", "Q: How to install ati radeon 5650 hd graphic card I want to install a GNU/Linux system on my laptop HP dv7-4120ew, because I've heard that 3d applications like Maya, Realflow or Houdini works here a lot better.

So this problem cannot be solved just by reinstalling the GRUB2 boot loader.\n\nA: IF all the windows install did was delete the partition before you stopped it you can try something like testdisk to see if it can find the original partition's on the drive. \nIf windows started writing data to the drive it is entirely likely that that partition was overwritten. \nThere are also tools like R-studio linux which may be able to recover the data as well but that may end up being more of a hassle then reinstalling the boot partition. \n\nA: Run Boot-Repair, click \"Advanced options\", go to the \"GRUB location\" tab, tick the \"Separate /boot partition\" option, apply.\n", "Q: Unsupported Culture in .NET application under Wine I'm running ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

I've done the update-rc.d, redoing it tells me that start/stop links are already in place, and I can start services manually by using service start.\nOne of these services (sabnzbdplus) was pulled from apt, the others are downloaded from git. None of them start up automatically.\nNothing seems to be on google other than reinstall the whole system. Any advice?\n\nA: I corrected this problem by chuser'ing the files/directories that were involved (including settings). I believe this happened because starting and stopping services with sudo gives them root privileges, whereas they're run as the user account at startup.\n\nA: A folder and subsequent files in 'nix are owned/operated by users+ groups + everyone else. When root owns a folder/files in that folder, only root can use those folder/files for any purpose unless permission is given to others to use those same folder/files.\nIn this case, the scripts are owned by root so any user will not be able to run them unless two things happen. 1) either root allows anybody else to run them by changing permissions to something like 777 (read, write and execute by anyone) or 2) including the user in the same group with root thereby allocating those same rights to the user.\nBoth are not the same however. 1 gives all users the right to use (maybe dangerous) whilst ownership stays with root but 2 shares ownership with user through inclusion in same group (exposure to only one user may be more manageable).\nI tend to use 1 but that is personal preference and also cos I'm lazy as running one script like \"sudo chmod -R 777 /etc/init.d/couchpotato\" solves my problems (note my system is isolated so it works for me whereas 2 may be the best solution for open or not so closed systems.\nHope that helps someone else\n", "Q: WIfi is not working on Atheros AR9285 on 9.04 Just now I have installed 9.04 in my Lenovo z570.

The point is to display live photo-streams from the web, updating the wallpaper automatically as new images are posted.\nI'm currently looking for the best way to display the images. The simplest thing is to just update the wallpaper by issuing a command to gsettings, for example:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:///new_wallpaper.png\n\nBut this approach isn't perfect: \n1) (minor) There's a perceptible lag between issuing the command and the update.\n2) (major) There's no smooth transition from the old wallpaper to the new wallpaper, so the effect is jarring.\nDo I have a better option?

This problem keeps coming back, no matter how many times I've killed it. I am seeing undesired versions of Japanese characters in my interface. (Particularly in Firefox, if that makes a difference).\nFor example, when looking at the word 七福神, it looks to me like this:\n\nHowever, the characters should look like this (taken from another computer):\n\nThe difference is on characters two and three. In the top example They have 示 on the left side, whereas in the bottom example, they have ⺭. I prefer to have the version that has ⺭, especially since that's the one used in modern Japanese (In fact, I have no idea why any font would bother using the version with 示 for Japanese, or why such a font would be some kind of default in Ubuntu).\nThis exact problem is addressed in this question, but there are a few reasons why the solutions there don't apply anymore. One is that the accepted answer is for Ubuntu Natty 11.04, and the configuration interfaces shown don't seem to exist anymore in Ubuntu Pangolin 12.04. At least, not for me, using Gnome Classic. Another issue is that the accepted answer alternately suggests editing /etc/fonts/fonts.conf, but that file clearly says at the top DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE. IT WILL BE REPLACED WHEN FONTCONFIG IS UPDATED. I could not figure out what fontconfig is - it doesn't seem to be a program.\nThe most important issue is, that the ideal would be that when setting system fonts, what I want to do is be able to specify a default English font and a default Japanese font. The only place I've found to specify system fonts is here under System Tools -> Preferences -> Advanced Settings:\n\nThe problem is that it doesn't differentiate between English and Japanese font displays.\nIn other words, what is happening is that my default system font for most situations is Ubuntu. When a character can't be found in Ubuntu, which is almost certainly always the case when the character is Japanese, it defaults to some other font for Japanese that I can't find or control.\nSo, what I can do for now is switch all the default fonts to a Japanese one, but then I sort of have the opposite problem - the way a lot of Japanese fonts handle English characters kind of sucks. For example, I like the Meiryo font for Japanese, but it renders English characters so wide it's ridiculous.\nBottom line: How can I set a default font for English (such as Ubuntu), and then a default Japanese font (such as Meiryo) for when Ubuntu needs to render a Japanese character?\n\nA: Without manually messing with the fontconfig hierarchy, I think this just boils down to having the right subset of Japanese fonts installed.\nFor me, on a stock Ubuntu 12.04, installing the fonts-vlgothic Japanese package solved the problem. Could you try that?\n\n\n*\n\n*Before (no extra fonts):\n\n\n*After installing fonts-vlgothic:\n\n\n\n", "Q: How do I show grub when resuming from suspend? I have a Sony Vaio laptop, that came pre-installed with Windows 7. I resized the windows partition, then set up a dual boot scenario with Ubuntu.\nI've noticed that when I run Windows and put the computer to sleep (i.e. shut the lid), and later resume it will sometimes show the grub menu. If I select the Windows 7 entry, it will resume as expected. If I select Ubuntu, then later restart, then select Windows, Windows will again resume from the last state. \nThe behaviour seems to be based on the amount of time it has been inactive.

On the other hand, if I shut the lid and come back some hours later, grub will be displayed. \nOn the other hand, with I put Ubuntu to sleep, it will always just go straight to Ubuntu. \n\n\n*\n\n*Is the behaviour I experience when running Windows - displaying grub, re-producible when running Ubuntu?  \n\n*Why does this occur on Windows?\n\n*Can I disable the behaviour from Windows, or is it out of my control?\n\n*How and where is the state saved - can I remove the state without rebooting back into windows and doing a hard reset, so that I can mount the disk?\n\n\nA: You are experiencing this in Windows because you are resuming from Hibernate, not Suspend. When you leave Windows on suspend for a while while running Windows, it automatically hibernates. To change this on Windows, go to Control Panel->Power Options, select Change plan settings next to your active power plan, then select Change advanced power settings. Then expand the sleep node, followed by the  Hibernate after node. There is a setting for both on battery and plugged in.\nIf you want Ubuntu to Hibernate if it has been on a Suspend for a while (and therefore show grub on boot), please check this thread.\nNOTE: Usually a system takes longer to resume from Hibernate than from Suspend.\n", "Q: Disable VLC's MPRIS plugin I'd like if possible to disable VLC from using the MPRIS interface.

It has the Ivy bridge processor with an Nvidia card.  I made the mistake of trying to install the nvidia proprietary driver.  On reboot I got 640x800 resolution :-(  So I apt-get remove --purge nvidia-current and it seems that the intel driver is now installed but I am stuck with 640x800.  \nNormally I would have booted using live cd (which has the correct resolution) and copy the xorg.conf from the live boot to the HDD.  But this doesn't seem to work with 12.04.\nI have added the Modes \"1920x1080\" to the xorg.conf file but with no luck\nI have tried manually editing and also deleting the ~/config/monitors.xml with no luck\nI tried installing Bumblebee with no luck\nOddly, if I plug an external monitor in the HDMI port, I can set the resolution correctly on that monitor.\nIf I do xrandr in a terminal with the live cd it finds the correct resolutions, but when I try it from the install, it only returns 640x800 :-(\nI would like to get my resolution back to native.

I have a laptop and a pc. My pc is very old having 1G Ram and old dual core processor but my laptop is relatively new.\nI want to use 12.04 for laptop and 10.10 for my pc. Is there a way I can add two different versions of Ubuntu 12.04(64 bit) and 10.10 (32 bit) to my usb at the same time? \n\nA: Depends on the drive.  some flash drives can be partitioned others cant.  I have installed grub to flashdrives with no issues before, a usb hdd is no problem at all to do that with. you can either make grub boot to a cd iso or boot to a full blown live distro on a flash/hdd. \nIt may be possible to make a virtual root disk image to boot to like a vmware vhd file but that would take a bit of work from what I read, if its even possible.  \nIf you boot from cd image that file will be copied to memory so you would need a couple gb of ram. if the laptop has 2gb and the desktop 1.  you could make the usb drive 10.x for the desktop and use the cd image to boot the laptop if you cant partition it.  \n\nA: Just one word - YUMI.\nAnd another - MULTIBOOT.\nPersonally, I prefer YUMI.\nPS - You can run Ubuntu 12.04 on your desktop too. And YUMI and MULTIBOOT are available only on Windows.\n\nA: It's possible to do this through grub2 - either booting into different partitions or simply booting the ISO file directly.  It's also possible if you have a large enough USB drive to partition it and do a full install of both operating systems on it.  If you do a search you'll find a lot of information about these things.\nUnless you want to do these as a learning exercise however I'd suggest the easiest thing to do would be to use MultiSystem to configure your USB drive with as many operating systems (and types) as you wish. Go here:\nhttp://liveusb.info/multisystem/\nand download the installer file  install-depot-multisystem.sh.tar.bz2\nYou will then need to unpack and install the program, then run it to build your USB drive.  You don't need to download the ISO files again - multisystem just defaults to that mode of operation.  Pay attention to creating a persistence file since it boots from a virtual disk.  It's not difficult as everything is automated for you.\nMultiSystem also works for the Gparted LiveUSB and other recovery tools so it's great to build a complete recovery USB drive with, especially those that aren't designed to boot straight from the ISO (like the Gparted CD).\nYou do however lose the first test and repair menu of the LiveUSB's, since multisystem causes it boot straight into the operating system.  You can certainly add these tools back into the grub2 menu that multisystem creates however.\n", "Q: Is there a command like REISUB that only restarts X? Is there a command like Ctrl + Alt + SysRq + R E I S U B that only restarts X - or drops down to shell (not a virtual console its broken)? \nBetween Ubuntu, Unity/Gnome3, and the kernel (Canonical-modified) there are an uncountable number of stability regressions that are consistently added each update since the 2009. It wouldn't bother me so much if I could just fix the problems as they happen without requiring a restart every couple hours. (No, its not a hardware thing, it happens on several machines both old and cutting-edge which all can handle Linux earlier than 2009 and Windows great.)\n\nA: Terminating X11\nAlt+SysRq+K does what you're describing. It terminates all the programs running on the current virtual console (which, when you're in your GUI, is X11 and all your programs therein). In effect, this quits X, typically causing it to restart, but doesn't shut down your computer. This is similar to the old Ctrl+Alt+Backspace key combination. For more information on both, see:\n\n*\n\n*How can I enable Ctrl+Alt+Backspace?\n(As you know, SysRq is the same key as PrtScr. By the way, Ctrl is not actually part of any of the magic SysRq key combinations; the key combination to to somewhat safely force a restart is Alt + SysRq + R E I S U B, and adding Ctrl to it does nothing.)\nTroubleshooting Without Terminating X11\nYou can also use the other virtual consoles to troubleshoot things. Ctrl+Alt+F1 through Ctrl+Alt+F6 give you full-screen, text-only terminals that function separately from the graphical interface. When you're in a text-only virtual console, you don't need to include Ctrl in the key combination, to switch to another one. Alt+F7 brings you back to X.\n", "Q: Need to reinstall Ubuntu 12.04, but my computer doesn't recognize my USB startup disk. (Dual boot) I need to do a clean reinstall of 12.04 OS.

The BIOS is booting from removable, but it does not seem to recognize the thumb drive, it goes straight to the GRUB menu. Am I doing something wrong?  Is there another way?\n\nA: check to see if there is legacy usb support in bios. you may need to enable that to boot from the flash drive.  Also  escape or f12 f11 depending on the system board often brings up the boot menu where you can manually select what to boot from. Select it there and see if that lets you boot to the flash drive. If that doesn't work see if another device will boot from it or load vmware player and see if it boots from the flash drive to verify it was properly created. \n", "Q: UbuntuShowdown apps installation unable to locate package error I recently heard about UbuntuShowdown apps.

It's working as expected (Ubuntu 12.04 x64) and I have no problems. However I'm slightly worried about any possible damage to the hardware, I know it's far fetched but it's an unofficial workaround, does anyone know of any risks that come with this software, any criticism from hardware manufacturers? \n\nA: Although it is unofficial, Nvidia knows of the Bumblebee project.\nA quote from their PR response (I do not fully agree with it, but that is not relevant here):\n\nRecently, there have been some questions raised about our lack of support for our Optimus notebook technology. When we launched our Optimus notebook technology, it was with support for Windows 7 only. The open source community rallied to work around this with support from the Bumblebee Open Source Project http://bumblebee-project.org/. And as a result, we've recently made Installer and readme changes in our R295 drivers that were designed to make interaction with Bumblebee easier. \n\nIf Bumblebee was dangerous, there should be a lot complaints from users. However, this is not the case so you may assume that Bumblebee is safe.\nCurrently, Bumblebee consists of two parts:\n\n\n*\n\n*allowing you to use the nvidia card using the optirun program\n\n*disabling the nvidia video card when the card is not in use\n\n\nThe first feature is as safe as the nvidia driver. Aside from an extra (software) layer, the process is equal to systems with a nvidia card as primary card.\nThe second feature uses a custom kernel module, bbswitch, which interacts with the ACPI subsystem. When using bbswitch in combination with Bumblebee, the card is disabled on boot and enabled on shutdown. As an author of the bbswitch module, I have not received any signals of hardware damage when using bbswitch in combination with Bumblebee.\nWhen using bbswitch without Bumblebee, one must take care of enabling the card on shutdown for some machines. This can be done by sending the OFF command to the bbswitch module. If this is not done, some machines could make the nvidia card disappear on the next boot. On some machines, this can be undone by pulling the power off the machine. Others need a BIOS reset. Again, this only occurs when using bbswitch without Bumblebee or when using bbswitch only without special measures. A bugreport for this issue can be found on https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/issues/224\nThe same issues from laptops with a nvidia card as primary video card may apply. This means that laptops with a bad thermal design may overheat when putting the nvidia card under heavy load. This is not an issue limited to Bumblebee though.\n\nA: I'm using it myself and never had any problems. I know some other people who use it and neither of them had problems.\nSadly it is never save to say that a software can't harm your system. There can always be a hidden bug that does something terribly wrong. That's why even a developer of a software can't tell you that it is certainly safe to use.\nMy personal assessment is that damage to your hardware is very very unlikely because all the hardware critical stuff (e.g. power management) is, to my understanding, done by the official nvidia driver. I guess the worst case that could happen is that your X-server config gets broken. But there is no downside of bumblebee I have heard of so far.\nThis might not be a definite answer but I'm posting it anyway because like I said I think a definite one is not possible.\n", "Q: Not booting into grub (boot-repair log included) Yesterday, after having resized and moved some of my partitions I have successfully enlarged my Ubuntu partition but in the morning I wanted to launch the computer and ... one thing I get is the \"blinking beacon\". \nI have tried booting into Ubuntu 12.04 USB and it worked, the disk is working - I can access it's files but I cannot boot into it. \nI have tried using boot-repair but with the automated option I get no luck.\nThis is the link to it's log http://paste.ubuntu.com/1155008/\nCan anyone help me on this ?\nI have been thinking on creating separate /boot partition in the beginning of the disk but I have some other Windows related partitions there (e.g. recovery partition) and this might be problematic.\nEDIT\nAfter clicking Restore MBR in boot-repair I can boot but only to windows:/ \nAnother boot-repair log\nEDIT\nI have plugged in a USB stick in and installed my GRUB on it, then I was able to boot my Ubuntu (from hard drive) with GRUB from USB stick. \nNow, since I already have access to my system - how can I repair/restore GRUB from here ?

I have noticed this behavior sometimes (on a 32-bit install). Upgrading all packages to the latest version solves it.\nI think the reason for this is that the new package you are trying to install is incompatible with the currently installed version of other packages. Instead of upgrading these, the package manager decides to remove them.\nI normally run sudo aptitude full-upgrade to fix this, though apt-get should do the same thing.\n\nA: The most probable cause of this problem may be, you have packages installed which is conflicting with the packages you requested to install i.e winetricks and it's dependencies.  \nThe actual cause of this conflict can be several, but I guess this one:\n\n\n*\n\n*You may have updated packages installed which are incompatible with requested packages for installation, in that case apt-get or synaptic try to remove those packages. Most of the time, it happens when we use cutting-edge PPAs.\n\n\nMy recommendation would be this:\n\n\n*\n\n*First enable all repository and also updates repository.\n\n*If you have enabled any PPAs before, but disable it now, re-enable it.\n\n*then do a sudo apt-get update to get updated package list\n\n*then do sudo apt-get install winetricks.\n\n\nNote that: Many of the packages are getting removed not for the fact that, it is causing conflict with winetricks but because, they are automatically marked as obsolete because the cause of their installation (they were dependency of some KDE apps) is not available now. They will removed even if you don't install winetricks, but only do a sudo apt-get autoremove command.

The behaviour you report is exactly what is expected.\nThe virtual CPU of your guest OS will not be able to use hardware virtualization the way your real CPU running the host OS does.\n\nA: The command is meant to check if your host system supports AMD-V or Intel VT-x, but not the guest system. When your host system is Windows you can't use this command because it relies on GNU or Unix utilities (one could install them via cygwin or other porting projects) and the linux kernels proc filesystem, but you're running a Windows kernel (co-linux might work, but you'd better forget about that).\n", "Q: How to bridge mobile broadband and wifi networks?

REISUB doesn't work. Any safe, easily undoable alternatives? I ran the installation for Wubi from ubuntu.com on my Acer Aspire One 722. It works fine every now and then, but more often than not the OS freezes. Every time it freezes I attempt the REISUB method, but I don't even get the console, just a frozen desktop. I can't pinpoint where exactly it freezes. I've been able to run Firefox and browse the web without problems multiple times, so from what I understand that discounts the problem with the network card others were having. But the freeze occurs either right away or after a while, maybe when I'm downloading something.\nI have tried a fresh install, unless you think I should redownload the setup file again, but that seems pointless. The REISUB method worked ONCE. And I don't even think it was when the OS was frozen. I'm pretty sure I just did that to make sure the method wasn't some \"Alt+F4\" beeswax.\nI have considered using a virtual PC, but I don't want to have to choose what fraction of my RAM (2GB total) goes to Ubuntu, I want 100% of it to go to Ubuntu when I want to run Ubuntu. When I want to run Ubuntu, I want to run ONLY Ubuntu, and when I want to run Windows, I want to run ONLY Windows.\nI really like the idea of choosing which OS I want to boot into when I start up my computer, but I don't want to have to do any partitioning, to do something I can't undo easily.\nIs there an alternative to Wubi that would allow me to do what I want, or is Wubi my only way? If it's the only way, how can I make it WORK?!\n\nA: REISUB only works 95% of the time, the other 5% is when the kernel \"breaks\". \nTry either updating or downgrading the latest kernel. If that doesn’t work, a reinstallation would probably fix it. \nInstall synaptic if you prefer a graphical way to remove/downgrade the kernel, or use apt-get to remove it. \nJust make sure that no matter what you leave a kernel installed. Good luck.\nAlso partitioning is pretty easy to reverse for the most part, but it may seem scary for one who hasnt done it before. If you can have a friend sit with you who has done it successfully before, it may help alot.

So I had place on the external HD for only one copy.\nI had to reinstall everything, but I didn't worry because I had a backup. But now, restoring doesn't work and it starts to be annoying.\nSo, I right click \"Restore missing files...\". Then I have the popup window from Deja Dup asking where is the backup. So, I select the external HD and either put nothing in \"folder\" or just put \".\". Thinking that it should be the base to look for backups.\nIn both cases, after a while scanning, I get: The Volume \"Filesystem root\" has only 139.7mb disk space remaining. But my partition \"/home\" has 799.6Gb free. Also, I just want to restore some files, I don't need all of them.\nOn my external HD, there's a file called: duplicity-full.20120514T220834Z.manifest. A text file. In it, I can see that everything is partitions in files of 52mb. So, small files are in one archive while very large files are split in multiple one. But I can see the exact list of file that I have.\nSo, I'm guessing that my backup is intact.\nWhat am I doing wrong ?\nIs possible that it failes, even to list all the files, because I don't have enough space left on my ExtHD ? Why can't duplicity used another location to do that ?\n\nA: I advise you to try to restore a important files.\nThe commande line : duplicity list-current-files --no-encryption file:///media/[rest of the root to your hard_disk] >  /home/yourusername/list.txt don't liste all files in the backup since the beginning, source \nand from author You can restore the full monty or selected folders/files from a specific time.\nTry to creat list of files and directory you need to restore using liste.txt generated by last commande and the liste of files in the manifest genereted by Deja Dup in backup directory like duplicity-full.20120922T175100Z.manifest, (name it for example *final_list.txt*)\nfinal_list.txt :\nhome/username/music\nhome/username/file.mp3\n...\n\nCreat restore directory\n$mkdir /tmp/restore\n\nCreat bash file Restore.sh\n#!/bin/bash\nFILE=$1\n# Read file form list \nwhile read line \ndo\n    duplicity --no-encryption --file-to-restore  \"$line\"  file:///media/[rest of the root to your hard_disk] /tmp/restore/\"$line\" \ndone <\"$FILE\"\n\nRestore you list\n$sh Restore.sh final_list.txt\n\nDone! and good luck :)\n\nA: I usually use duplicity to get part of the backups done with deja-dup (deja-dup is a front-end for duplicity)\nThe first thing I would do would be creating a list of files in your backup by, for instance:\nduplicity list-current-files --no-encryption file:///media/[rest of the root to your hard_disk] >  /home/yourusername/list.txt  (if there is encryption, use the proper option)\n\nIf that works, your backup is OK. Then, with duplicity restore you should be able to restore everything, or with duplicity --no-encryption --file-to-restore just a folder or files (type 'man duplicity' in a terminal for more info, or ask if you have more doubts)\nI hope your backup is safe!\n", "Q: Cant connect to wireless network automatically even though the box is checked! My mum, who lives 400 miles away, has a problem with her wireless network with Ubuntu 12.04, upgraded from 11.04 on her Acer Netbook.

It's as if she doesn't have the correct permissions to automatically sign in to her network.  She is also unable to tick the 'Available to all users' checkbox. \nCan anyone advise me further?\nThanks in advance \n\nA: A question like this may not have a simple answer, since it's impossible to know what is causing that behavior.

Also, my mum is a silver surfer too, and I know how tricky it can be helping out over the phone....\nI sometimes use an external usb wireless adaptor, and this occasionally mis-behaves in the way you describe, in that it fails to make the connection, keeps asking for the password even though it already has it, and generally being irritating.\nIn my case the solution is very simple, I just unplug the adaptor and plug it in again. Very often when I do this it connects right away with no further fuss. It is as if the adaptor occasionally fails to boot correctly, and re-booting it by un-plugging and re-plugging it fixes things.\nIn your mother's case, if the adaptor is built-in, the solution may be a bit more work. One way might be to try a re-boot of the computer, but it may be better to try disabling and then re-enabling the wireless from the top-right toolbar first.\nLess drastic than re-booting the computer, if there is a hardware switch to toggle the wifi try turning it off and back on.\nAnother thing you can try (but it might be difficult explaining this to your mum over the phone) is using the rfkill command to check the wireless from the command line. These are the commands that may be useful:\nsudo rfkill list all\n\nThis will show the state of all network devices and the names of them.\nsudo rfkill unblock <name-of-wifi>\n\nwhich unblocks the wifi device. In view of my comments above, there is one further variation that may be handy for toggling the wifi:\nsudo rfkill block <name-of-wifi>\n\nwhich will lock the wifi device, disabling it in software. Re-enabling it with the unblock command might just produce the desired effect (but no promises!).\n\nA: You could try the following:\nsudo gedit /etc/rc.local\nEnter your administration password. Now insert the following line right after the last line of the comment section (those lines that start with #).\nnmcli con up id SSID\nYou replace SSID by the official name of your wireless network, for example myWireless.

I just bought a bluetooth stereo speaker and I had an idea: \nIs it possible to build a 4.0 audio system using my Bluetooth speakers as rear speaker and two normal cabled stereo speakers (or another pair of bluetooth speakers) as front? \nWhich program I have to use? \nIn general: is it possible to split a 4.0 or 5.1 signal in the single channels and send them to multiple devices?\n\nA: You can use a package called Jack. What it lets you do is pipe the outputs from the source, into whatever channels on whatever devices you want.\nsudo apt-get jack2d jack-tools qjackctl\njack2d: is the more recent version of Jack\njack-tools: more stuff for jack\nqjackctl: GUI\nAfter installation use qjackctl to pull up the GUI.\nExamples of things you can do with jack;\n\n\n*\n\n*Pipe audio from one source to all devices for synced audio.\n\n*Send the Left channel to both channels of a pair of speakers, and the right to a different pair\n\n\nThe possibilities are pretty endless. Here is a picture from the help page for Jack\nOn the left, you can see your output sources, and on the right are the devices you can output to. \n\nHere is a picture of 3 LR audio sources where 2 of them are pipe to 1 speaker, \nand the other source to the other speaker. \n\n\nA: strictly speaking no.  a single sound card processes the data synch's all the channels and makes front left x% stronger and rear right x% weaker so that the explosion on the front left of the screen sounds right.  or the reverse when a jet flies over from the rear.  \nyou can make a psudo setup but if you want good sound get a proper card and speakers. a well equiped and setup system can sound amaizing.  I got an omega sound card for the wifes pc because she watches a lot of dvd's even on the cheezy speakers we have it sounds decent.  when I got that omega I was quite suprised how much a difference a good sound card makes. I was used to the creative labs audigy. \n\nA: I got it to work by combining the advice from this thread http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-859769-start-0.html and this article. http://confignewton.com/?p=211\nfrom the confignewton article, do what it says about commenting out the module-udev-detect and module-detect lines in both default.pa and system.pa\nnext, I added this to default.pa:\n### Load audio drivers statically\n### (it's probably better to not load these drivers manually, but instead\n### use module-udev-detect -- see below -- for doing this automatically)\nload-module module-alsa-sink sink_name=rear device=hw:0 channels=2 channel_map=rear-left,rear-right tsched=0\nload-module module-alsa-sink sink_name=front device=hw:1 channels=2 channel_map=front-left,front-right tsched=0\n\nAt the end of default.pa, I added a line similar to what is talked about in the gentoo thread:\nload-module module-combine channels=4 channel_map=front-left,front-right,rear-left,rear-right\n\nEDIT: I've added \"tsched=0\" to the end of each of those static declarations. It really helps with both echoing and crackling.\n\nA: To answer the original question, yes this can be done with PulseAudio, but you will not get perfect synchronisation between a Bluetooth speaker and a non-Bluetooth speaker, so you probably won't like the result if you wanted to use it for \"normal\" listening.\nHowever, there are situations where perfect synchronisation is not necessary.  In our case we were playing a dual-language video, with English on the left channel and another language on the right channel, and we wanted the right channel to be sent to a separate Bluetooth device while the left channel was sent to the default sound device (in our case HDMI audio from a Raspberry Pi 400).  So long as the audio stayed within half a second or so, we didn't mind minor latency differences in this scenario.\nAttempting to do the load-module module-combine in default.pa did not work when one of the devices was Bluetooth, because Pulseaudio had not yet finished connecting to the Bluetooth device when it read that line during initialisation.  Instead, we had to connect to the Bluetooth device first and then issue the load-module command at runtime, in other words do:\npacmd list-sinks | less\n\nand note the sink names (if your Bluetooth sink is not present, connect to it and repeat this command), then\npactl load-module module-combine-sink sink_name=duplicate slaves=alsa_output.platform-fef05700.hdmi.hdmi-stereo,bluez_sink.01_23_45_67_89_AB.a2dp_sink channels=2\n\nchanging the two sink names to the ones listed by the list-sinks command above, then\npacmd set-default-sink duplicate\n\nNow if you play a sound, you should find it plays on both devices, perhaps with a small delay between them (as I said the synchronisation might not be perfect).  To be more selective about which channel goes to which device, run pavucontrol (if you don't have it then sudo apt install it), and in the \"Output Devices\" tab silence the channels you don't want on the underlying devices, for example silence the right-hand channel on the HDMI device and silence the left-hand channel on the Bluetooth device.\n", "Q: Can I format my Windows 7 NTFS partition and use it in Ubuntu even if it appears earlier on disk? I have installed and working Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04.\nI discovered that I do not need all this space that I have assigned to my D:\\ drive in Windows and now would like to include it as a partition in Ubuntu.\nA friend told me that if I have first installed Windows and then Ubuntu, then the order of the disks does not favor such a move and that I must just format it and auto-mount it in Ubuntu.\nHere is my partition table:\n/dev/sda\n  /dev/sda1 ntfs 209715 MB (C:/ drive with Windows installation)\n  /dev/sda2 ntfs 268928 MB (D:/ drive that I would like now to use in Ubuntu)\n  /dev/sda5 ext4 100000 MB (Ubuntu root /)\n  /dev/sda7 ext4 162467 MB (Ubuntu home /home)\n  /dev/sda6 swap 9034 MB   (swap partition)\n\nHere is what I am planning to do but am so scared to break anything.\nI booted with the 12.04 Live USB and chose \"Something else\" (3rd option after \"Erase Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS and reinstall\" and \"Erase everything and reinstall\").\nThen I plan to select /dev/sda2 then click on \"Change\".\nIn the dialog box, I plan to select ext4, to tick the Format checkbox and to choose mount point to be the root /.\nAm I creating a disaster?\nPlease advise.\n\nA: Option 1: You don't need to reinstall the system to take advantage of the extra partition, of course. Actually, you do not even need to reformat it -- Ubuntu can mount an NTFS partition as well, so you could use it to exchange data between the two systems. For example, you can mount it in such a way that it is always accessible under /data, for example, so you can store your multimedia files there.\nThere is a step-by-step instruction on how to do it here. Even if it seems complicated, it's not, and is actually by far the easiest solution.\nIn short, you need to \n\n\n*\n\n*Install ntfs driver\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-4g\n\n\n*Run the graphical configuration tool\nsudo apt-get install ntfs-config\ngksudo ntfs-config\n\nAlso, if I would not use so much space for the root system. My system barely uses up a few gigs; it's better to leave the system partition relatively small, because if needed you can just go on and reformat it, not worrying about what you really care about -- your data files. How much does your system currently take? Multiply it by two and you will get the most of what you should allocate to a root filesystem. And if you do not keep data on your root filesystem (as you should), then you waste disk space.\nOption 2: if you really plan a full reinstallation, just delete all the Linux partitions and the NTFS partition using the manual partitioning option in the Ubuntu installer, and set up the partitions to your heart's content. It's not as dangerous as one might think, as long as you read what's on the screen and do a backup before installation.\nNote about backups: there are two sorts of people, those who do proper backups and those who will. Whatever you do, backup your data on an external disk or in the cloud, make sure that backups work, and you'll be fine.\n\nA: @numix; \nI did the same thing that you are planning to do and with me works just fine.\nSo, I don't thinks you're going to have problems.\n", "Q: I can't update wine from 1.5.10 to 1.5.11 due to a dpkg lock file I have tried double checking for updates and updating the ppa via the terminal.

This link https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro has nothing for 9,1 so please help me. If I have to remove BootCamp and reinstall Windows manually because BootCamp doesn't allow resizing of partitions, that's fine. Please tell me how to install Precise on MBP 9,1\nThanks!\n\nA: My suggestion is to just install it on a flash drive and before it shows the apple boot logo, hold option key and select the flash drive. It performs surprisingly fast off a flash drive. I have a cousin that uses this method on his Mac. \n\nA: I have one of these and have still not got it all working properly. However I have managed to get Mint 13 (derived from 12.04) installed on it. The basic setup that you are asking about is described here. In order to get an Ubuntu live image to boot you need to pass some options to the kernel as described here in the section entitled 3rd attempt. I could only get it to boot from a DVD, it wouldn't work from a USB drive for me.\nAs I understand it, if you want to have Windows also then you can't use EFI boot, but the default install uses BIOS boot so that shouldn't require further config.\nThere is further discussion about this laptop on ubuntuforums.org (AU won't let me post any more links so you'll have to search) full support for it still seems to be a work in progress.\nThe key thing about booting from CD or HD in BIOS mode is to add \"noapic\" to the kernel boot parameters otherwise it will not boot. For EFI mode you need \"noinitremap\".\n\nA: What works for me (13.04 and above work well on a Mac):\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu with the 64-bit ISO.\n\n*For wireless drivers and NVIDIA drivers, go to Additional Drivers and install them.\n\n\nWorks like a charm!\n\nA: So i just installed an almost \"perfect\" MacbookPro 9.1. A pretty long process but completely worth it! Here we go:\nInstall 12.10 \n-use the 64 bit version on the default download page -it has EFI boot support ie: ubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64+mac.iso.\n-Download and install Refind on your macbook pro.\n-Hold down Option key during booting the macbook pro and insert the DVD/CD. Wait for it to be read and select \"EFI Boot\" NOT \"Windows\"\nUpgrade To 13.04 (Its Pretty Stable For Me :) using for Java development)\n-Install and update your 12.10 completely.\n-Once 12.10 is installed and updated, upgrade to 13.04 using:\n sudo do-release-upgrade -d\n[it should now download the 13.04 packages and upgrade. Everything worked for me out of the box except my wireless]\nInstall Wireless:\nAfter a few searching and trials, i found this thread \"http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1966236\" ...that did it for me.\nSuffice it to say that i'm writing this using the macbook now :)\nEnjoy.\n\nA: I have a non retina macbook pro 9,1 as well. I followed the installation instructions for a mbp on the ubuntu website (with refit), but after the installation would complete, I'd reboot, and after passing the grub screen, get an unresponsive black screen.\nThe solution I found to get a good install is to remove all nvidia drivers after installation and before reboot, via sudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia-*. I don't know exactly why this worked for me, but it did.\nI also changed the grub option \"quiet splash\" to \"nomodeset\", and ran update-grub after.\nAfter these steps, I rebooted, and everything worked perfectly!

I would like to combine both features as follows:\nWhen I push, then release, the Caps lock key, it sends Escape.\nWhen I hold down Caps lock and push another key (say A), it send Control-A.\nIs there some combination of xkb, xmodmap and something else that could make Caps lock behave this way in X?\nI'm using Ubuntu Precise on a Macbook Air 3,1.\n\nA: Install xcape\nsudo apt-get install xcape\n\nAdd the two lines in your ~/.profile\n/usr/bin/setxkbmap -option 'caps:ctrl_modifier'⏎\n/usr/bin/xcape -e 'Caps_Lock=Escape' -t 100\n\nNotice the part -t 100, if you don't set it, you may notice a delay in Esc if you use vim.\n\nA: I'm looking for this too. As of a week ago I found my self a partial solution using xmodmap:\nadd Control = Caps_Lock\nremove Lock = Caps_Lock\nkeysym Caps_Lock = Escape\n\nThis is of course not working perfectly, it effectively send both Escape and Ctrl at the same time when I press CapsLock, but I was happy with it for a while.\nFinally I found this little utility https://github.com/alols/xcape. So now I can simply remap CapsLock to Ctrl and let xcape do its job.\n\nA: EDIT: Fixed this for most smart (newer) display managers.\nPer Louis and Sergiy's comments I have come up with this solution that is working for me on Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) with LightDM and Unity.\nI put the following line of code into my .xprofile file in my home directory.\nsetxkbmap -option 'caps:ctrl_modifier' && xcape -e 'Caps_Lock=Escape' &\n\nThe trailing & puts the xcape command into the background so that it doesn't block your session.

Then xcape -e 'Control_L=Escape' didn't work, but after using xcape -d I've discovered that Caps Lock generates keycode 66 and remapped it respectively: xcape -e '#66=Escape'. – Sergiy Byelozyorov Sep 4 '14 at 10:08 \n\nLouis:      \n\nAs per this blog post, it is possible to do this with xcape alone: setxkbmap -option 'caps:ctrl_modifier' xcape -e 'Caps_Lock=Escape' setxkbmap -option 'caps:ctrl_modifier' xcape -e 'Caps_Lock=Escape;Control_L=Escape;Control_R=Escape' – Louis Simoneau Aug 4 '15 at 10:06 \n\n\nA: I have this setup on my Mac and I had tried to find a way for Ubuntu without luck.\nWell, it's now working.

Two of them are Modifier Keys and Lock Keys.\nCaps Lock is a Lock Key while keys such as Ctrl, Alt, and Shift are Modifier Keys.\nIt's apparent from their names that Modifier Keys modify the function of the next key(s) pressed, and Lock Keys act as a toggle switch to turn on or off some particular function.\nNow, since Caps Lock is a Lock Key, you cannot have it behave like a Modifier Key without mapping it to one.

I am using kubuntu 12.04 and kde 4.9 and I would like to make some custom theming.\nI have made some changes in my color scheme and icons and now I would like to make changes into window decoration in order to match. Although there are quite a lot of downloadable window decorators via System Settings > Workspace Appearance > Window Decorations, I have to admit that I didn't find any with so many configuration options nor appearence as default's oxygen. However, oxygen default's color (light grey) do not match with my new color set, so I would like to know if it possible to change its colors.\nI have tried with several scheme colors with no success ( System Settings -> Application Appearance -> Colors -> Colors tab -> Color set: Window -> change Normal Background). Although they do change window's titles color's background in other windows decorators, oxygen ignores that configuration. I am wondering why, since it's supposed to be very customizable and multi-purpose.  \nIs there any way to achieve this?\n\nA: Short Answer:\nAre you referring to the overall grey background colour of the windows? It sounds like you are looking for the Window Background setting.\n\nLong answer (for others):\nIf you are looking to change the colour appearance of KDE's windows, you can change that easily by going to \nSystem Settings > Application Appearance\nChoose the Colours tab on the left.\nWhen tweaking it yourself, the specific colour (I think) you are referring to, is under the Colours tab. Make sure Common Colours is selected as the Colour Set and then select a new colour for the Window Background.\nYou can also adjust quickly by choosing an existing colour scheme or setting your own scheme. On the Scheme tab you can quickly select an overall colour scheme, like e.g. Obsidian Coast will make all your main window background areas dark.\n", "Q: Kickoff and Krunner to search with less than 3 chars in search field? Both Krunner and Kickoff in Kubuntu return a list of found items after the user has entered at least three characters in the search field.\nUsage on Synapse shows that returning a list after one character onwards is faster and efficient.\nI would like Kickoff and Krunner to behave similarly, by making the return a list of items after entering the first character in their search field.\nHow can I achieve that?\n\nA: No, this settings can't be changed in default setup. Krunner and Kickoff are designed to display search suggestion after at least 3 letters in input.  So, you can't change them because there is not configuration option to do so.\n\n\n*\n\n*See this Wikipedia Article about Krunner.\n\n*Also see this documentation in userbase.kde.org which says, krunner requires at least 3 letters to be typed to match for a partial search.\nA bug report was filed against this behavior in https://bugs.kde.org, though it's status is still (7-9-2012) unconfirmed, the first response was \n\nAs Plasma developers (somehow understandable) won‘t remove the 3 letters restricton, at least make it more obvious that it won‘t search bevore you‘ve entered at least 3 letters\n\nSo, it seems KDE developers are not willing to change this behavior. I think the only option is to change it yourself and then re-compile.\nNote that, both Krunner and Kickoff was designed in this way\n\nA: Unlike Synapse, which tries to match items based on any input, Kickoff and Krunner are designed to match after you've inserted enough information to match with.\nMy suggestion would be to report a bug against the two as a wishlist item, since there are currently no options (that I know of), that allow you to change this.\n", "Q: Can I make just GIMP use a dark theme? \nPossible Duplicate:\nCan I apply a different GTK3 theme from the main one to an individual application? \n\nWhen doing color work with photos it can be useful to have a dark background and GUI elements. Several photo editing applications provide this natively:\n  \nI've seen screenshots of GIMP with a dark color theme that approximates this effect:\n\nCan I make GIMP look like this without affecting other applications?\n\nA: There is one gtk2 theme that I use for gimp 2.6, although it should work for gimp 2.8, and that is Darkilouche. (It will work until gimp switches to gtk3 around the time of gimp 3.) It may not be quite as dark as the one you have in mind, but it's good and you may be able to modify it further. It was created by a while ago here and the version you want is 0.2.3, available here as well.\nNeedless to say, it is easy to install. Just unpack the zip and create a new folder called Darkilouche and place in it the contents of the zip (folders labelled gtk-2.0, .svn and a file named Darkilouche. Then move the Darkilouche folder to .themes in your home folder. Then, to test it with gimp (substituting gimp-2.6 for your version), run:\nGTK2_RC_FILES=$HOME/.themes/Darkilouche/gtk-2.0/gtkrc gimp-2.6\n\nThis command simply specifies a particular theme (gtkrc) to use with a gtk application, it will NOT affect your general Ubuntu theme or interfere with any other programs.\nThen you can create a launcher to run gimp like this in the future.\n\n\n", "Q: How can I install gcc 3.3, g++ 3.3, cpp 3.3? \nPossible Duplicate:\nOld version of gcc for new Ubuntu \n\nI am trying to follow the directions for installing the Dyna language in Ubuntu, here:\nhttp://dyna.org/wiki/index.php?title=Download\nHowever, this requires installing very old versions of gcc, g++, and cpp. These versions no longer appear in the Ubuntu repositories. Is there a repository I should add to get older versions of the software?

I'm using GParted to shrink the partition on my 500 GB external hard drive to a 220 GB partition. It contains about 210 GB of data. \nI'm shrinking it to convert FAT32 to EXT2. It has been almost an hour. My hard disk heats up so I have continuous ventilation to keep it cool. \nIs this lengthy time taken by GParted normal? If not, then how do I safely disconnect it? I don't mind losing the data, but the hard disk is really important. Any suggestions? Also, will running the hard disk for such long hours be harmful?\n\nA: It's quite normal for dynamic resizing operations--and particularly shrinking--to take a long time. Files are spread across much, and perhaps most, of the original partition. They have to be re-pieced together to fit them in a smaller space, and the information about where their pieces exist has to be updated. If you are also having the partition automatically converted from FAT32 to ext2, that may take a while as well, as the files are stored somewhat differently.\nIf it takes more than a day, then I would start thinking there was something wrong.\nAs for whether or not it's OK to run your hard drive at near its maximum capacity for reads and writes, for hours at a time: yes, this is fine. Your hard drive is, among other things, a mechanical device, so the more it's used, the higher the likelihood of mechanical failure. But all hard drives fail eventually, and there's no reason to expect this one will fail any sooner, just because it runs heavily for hours.\nOf course, if it's getting too hot, that is a problem. A properly constructed computer should never allow this to happen, even if the hard drive is reading and writing at 100% capacity for days, weeks, or months without interruption. (Depending on what hard drive you've purchased, running it like this for months might or might not bring about very early failure.) But if you find it is hot, and you're able to cool it with externally applied ventilation, that should be fine.\n\nI don't mind losing the data,but the hard disk is really important.\n\nIf you have to cancel the operation, click Cancel. Really anything except cutting power to your computer or to the drive, won't physically damage the drive. Shutting down the operating system, using any method of harshness less than or equal to REISUB, will not be a problem. Even cutting power to the machine is unlikely to cause any real damage, although I would definitely avoid it when possible.\nHowever, you may want to rethink the value you put in a single drive. All hard drives fail eventually, you can't prevent them from failing, and you can't prevent some of them (essentially selected at random) from failing long before you would expect them to fail. Some drives last longer than others (for some uses), and some drives are less likely to fail \"early,\" but hard drives are replaceable (even in laptops) for a reason.\nTo put it another way: Hard drives' lifetimes are limited, so much so that in any computer where some other component fails first, the computer's craftsmanship should be questioned.\n\nA: Most external drives AFAIK do not have cooling fans, so under the process you described, overheating is expected...and unwanted. There is no need to wear out your hardware before the end of its design lifetime.\nI found it quicker and more kind to the hardware, if you copy (not \"move\") the files to another hard drive temporarily. Or perhaps compress the existing files (7z, tar, rar, or zip) to one big file, then copy to another drive.\nIf it's OK to destroy the original files, use GParted (or other disk/partition manager) to immediately reformat the whole drive, defining whatever partitions you want (however many, however big, and whatever filesystems you prefer).\n", "Q: Can someone please compare the safety issues between Ubuntu and windows OS? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhy is Ubuntu more secure than Windows or Mac OS X? \n\nI am a new user. I installed this on and older PC using XP. Can someone please compare the safety issues between Ubuntu and windows OS. In other words, am I much safer on the web with Ubuntu>\n\nA: The simple answer is Yes. \nThere are many complicated reasons for it all regarding the internals of how Windows works (mostly to support legacy software, but also the history of raw sockets and the single user system). \nThe simpler case is that almost every major business in the world uses a windows environment, therefor, mal-ware is written to attack the largest population. \n\nA: Windows is the platform most users write malicious code for. A good feature in Linux is the permissions. You have to give a file permission to run, you need permissions to edit and so on. I guess the biggest risk of attacks, especially Linux-based servers, are security holes in the software you install, and not code actually running on the machine.\n\nA: IMHO, the key is disabling add-ons in the web browser. Much of the mischief on the web these days is focused on Flash. No matter what the OS is, if you allow Flash to run automatically, and the bad guy has a Flash exploit, you are at risk.

What this means then is that applications running on Wine don't need any kind of \"translation\" or emulation unless of course you are running a Direct 3D game (Direct 3D calls are translated into Open GL counterparts first).\n\nA: I suggest you give uGet a try. - http://ugetdm.com\nWINE is not as resource intensive as you might think but it would certainly be more intensive than running a native app as you will be running two different applications essentially, WINE & Orbit.\nuGet is a very powerful yet light in resources native Linux & Ubuntu download manager. uGet also will integrate into Firefox and Chrome making it faster and easier to use.\nDisclaimer: I am on the project team for uGet, so might be a bit biased.\n\nA: Give Internet Download Manager (IDM) a try.

I'm trying to view the entire contents of my iPhone in Ubuntu 10.04. \nI'm able to mount and view the digital media folders, but I'm looking for behavior more like the Mac/Windows iExplorer app that will list the /var folder as well as Applications, etc rather than just making it look like an external filesystem. \nI've found a few options that require jailbreak but I'd rather not go that route if it's at all possible. \nThanks!\n\nA: There are three ways to open the root ('/') folder in Ubuntu:\n1) Thru WINE: try to load the iPhone in WINE and to run iExplorer.\n2) Jailbreak your iPhone, install OpenSSH in your iPhone and run SSHFS in your computer. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the iPhone and the PC/Mac to the same Wi-Fi.\n\n*Install OpenSSH from Cydia. Easy, huh?\n\n*Install SSHFS in Ubuntu. Open a terminal window and run sudo apt-get install fuse-utils sshfs\n\n*Get the iPhone's IP going to Settings > Wi-Fi > [blue circle with arrow next to your Wi-Fi] > IP Address.\n\n*Create a mountpount with, for example, sudo mkdir /mnt/iphone, followed by sudo chown [myuser] /mnt/iphone (obviously, replace [myuser] with your username)\n\n*Unlock the iPhone. Don't lock it until you logged in.\n\n*Now mount with sshfs root@[iPhone's IP]:/ /mnt/iphone It will ask the root password.\n\n\nThe default root's password in iOS is alpine, change it to anything you want opening the iPhone terminal, logging into root and typing passwd. This is the only security hole in jailbreak, but it's so easy to fix it that anybody who knows how to jailbreak can do it!\nLogging with root in / is not the only way to access the iPhone. For example, you can open the /var/mobile folder using the mobile user with sshfs mobile@[iPhone's IP]:/var/mobile /mnt/iphone. Password is (of course) alpine\nTo unmount the iPhone, check that you're not manipulating files and run fusermount -u /mnt/iphone. If you have problems unmounting, try first killall sshfs\n3) Run iExplorer in a virtual Windows using, for example, Virtualbox. Too slow for some computers, very simmilar to running WINE, and you need to have a Windows copy. Anyway, it's the same than running in a Windows PC.\n", "Q: No Wired or Wireless Connection on a Dell Precision M4300 Let me start off by saying that I've been working on this for 6 hours, researching everywhere I can find online and not finding a solution.\nI just installed Ubuntu 12.4 LTS and replaced Windows XP on my Dell Precision M4300.

It never connects. I'm able to get a \"connection\" if I change the IPv4 connection settings to \"Shared\" rather than Auto, but it will not connect to the internet, it simply says that it's connected.

Does anybody know if there is a way to keep it from changing? I am using an IDE drive and a SATA drive. \n\nA: The kernel gives no guarantee that these devices will retain the same device node names (ie, sda, sdb, etc) when the machine is booted.

I have several apps that use indicators. Always, when I activate a particular app, Hotot for example, a window and indicator appears on my top panel. If I close the app using the x button, the Hotot window closes and minimizes to the top panel. When I click on Hotot from my Launcher (it is locked on my Launcher) instead of simply opening a window it opens a window and another indicator, which doubles the Hotot indicators on my top panel.\nIs there a way to stop that? It usually happens with Hotot and JDownloader.\n\nA: Unfortunately, this is a problem/bug in those particular applications. When you launch them, they should detect that they are running minimized with an indicator, and simply maximize the running instance. But they don't, and instead start a new copy of the program , with indicator and all.\nUnless you want to modify the source code yourself, the best way to get this fixed is to file a bug with the respective application's developers.\nIn the meanwhile, you should try to remember to use the indicator's menu to show the app once you have started it, instead of clicking on the Launcher shortcut. \n", "Q: Sudden graphical glitches in wine I have been using Ubuntu since 9.10 and have always gamed in wine without an issue. I have been running 12.04 since its release and have been playing the Sims3 and Wow in Ubuntu flawlessly. However I recently upgraded my video card from a Radeon HD 6850 to a HD7870, when I did the upgrade I reformatted and reinstalled Ubuntu 12.04 with the version of fglrx available through jockey. Now when I run games in wine they still play OK and 90% of the graphics are there, but not all. For example in the Sims3 everything renders just fine except the trees, they render as green cubes with the texture displaying as a flat image protruding from the center. There is a screen shot below. \n\nWow isn't any better, flags and banners in the game just display as large textured rectangles, however Wow is so bad it wont even load completely into the game, but the errors are evident on the character select screen.\nI am not sure what to do, I had both of these games running fine with the same fglrx version just a few weeks ago, and now they do not work properly. I know its not a hardware issue seeing how all these games run flawlessly in windows, If I can get 50-60 FPS in BF3 on Ultra, then I think the card is OK. \nI attempted to install the (Post release updates) version of fglrx but it fails every time (seems to be a know issue, so its not just me.) I installed \"fglrx-updates\" and the corresponding amdcccle package through synaptic, and it broke my system, so I had to remove them and revert back to the open source driver. Lastly I attempted to install the latest driver from the AMD website, it installed with no errors however once I restarted I was still using the open source driver and the catalyst control center was nowhere to be found even though the software center claimed that it was installed. \nI am out of ideas, any help would be very appreciated.

The problem seems to be worse when downloading files, whether from the web, Update Manager, or from the Software Center. \nThe network manager never shows loss of connection, and disconnecting then reconnecting wireless solves the issue. Disabling -n speed in terminal improved performance a bit.\nI have also disabled power management for the device with (I think) iwconfig, in addition to disabling the -n speed setting. I have also tried disabling IPV6.\n\nA: So the Rosewill has an RT2760 chipset.

*\n\n*Your hub appears to be bus-powered (i.e. no AC/DC adapter). The total peak power consumption of all devices connected to it should ideally be limited to 500 mA according to the USB standard.\n\n*The devices you currently have attached probably draw much more than that total, e.g. a 2.5\" HDD will easily draw 500 mA on its own; a smart-phone being charged will also max out 500 mA.\n\n*While it may work in Windows, the problem definitely appears to be power here based on your description and the kernel log:\n\n*\n\n*Portable HD attempting to start every second is a guaranteed sign of not enough power\n\n*If removing/reattaching one device causes the rest to do the same, then the hub is getting reset, probably because it can't source enough power from the computer to keep itself running along with all the devices.\n\n\n*Trust hubs seem to be causing problems with Linux/Ubuntu for others too...\nMy strong recommendation at this point is to switch to a self-powered hub, i.e. the hub has its own AC/DC adapter. For example, any of the Trust hubs on this page which say they include a power adapter or \"extra power\" should work fine.\n", "Q: How do I recreate a deleted '/var/lib/dpkg' directory?

(Defaults to /)\n\n   --root=dir\n          Changing  root  changes  instdir  to  dir and admindir to\n          dir/var/lib/dpkg.\n\nusing --root=dir as I suggested would set the admin folder to /mnt/var/lib/dpkg--the folder that you deleted.\nInstead try this:\nsudo dpkg --force-overwrite --instdir=/mnt -i dpkg_1.16.1.2ubuntu7_amd64.deb\n\nThis will use the liveCD's /var/lib/dpkg folder, but the --force-overwrite flag should make it install even though it thinks the package is already installed.\nGood luck!\nedit2\nWhile this should work to reinstall dpkg I don't think it will rebuild the package lists that are in /var/lib/dpkg.  Following the advice in izx's comment to copy the directories/file from a liveCD and go from their is probably your best bet.\n\nA: I faced a similar situation recently. And most of the answers I found online were not of much help.\nBasically, another option you have is to copy /var/lib/dpkg from another existing working installation. You can always install a fresh copy of your distribution in a virtual machine (like VirtualBox), and copy the directory from that clean copy.\nI would try most options before this, so give it a shot as a last resort. I had another computer at home running the same distro, so I just copied the whole directory onto my machine, replacing a corrupted /var/lib/dpkg. Be sure to backup so you can return to whatever state you were in if this doesn't work.\n", "Q: Lubuntu vs. lubuntu-desktop I've heard that Lubuntu consumes less resources than Ubuntu. Is it because of the fact that Lubuntu uses different desktop environment and window manager?\nIf so, would it be equivalent to install lubuntu-desktop on top of Ubuntu rather than doing a fresh install?\n\nA: The main difference is in the desktop environment (DE) and not in the installed applications. \n(The main applications like Libre office suite and Firefox and Chromium internet browsers act ok in LXDE on computers that otherwise cannot cope with Ubuntu/Unity).\nPeople say 'Ubuntu' to refer to the main Ubuntu release which uses Unity as DE. \nUbuntu-proper = Ubuntu OS + Gnome/Unity DE \nKubuntu = Ubuntu OS + KDE\nXubuntu = Ubuntu OS + Xfce DE\nLubuntu = Ubuntu OS + LXDE\n(More here.)\nThe difference in resources used by Unity compared to LXDE is huge (from the point of view of my 1GB RAM PC). \nLXDE/Lubuntu is the lightest, but it takes some more customization to make it look stylish (like this). (It's easy in fact.) \nXfce/Xubuntu is a bit heavier, but still light, KDE/Kubuntu is close to Gnome/Unity in the use of resources, the later being the heaviest.\nFor example I have a computer that is sluggish in KDE and Unity but works ok in Xfce/Xubuntu and is perfect in LXDE/Lubuntu.\nYou can install all the different DE that make up the Ubuntu family, try them, and then stuck to the one that best meets your needs and your computer's specs, but having them together is not very useful on the long run. \nI have used Lubuntu on top of Xubuntu with no problems and do not think would be any problem to put it on top of Ubuntu-proper. In fact, a fresh install of Lubuntu would mean less stuff installed initially, that you could add afterwards anyway (like Libre Office for example). It all depends on your needs.\n\nA: Exactly.\nLubuntu is essentially Ubuntu, but with a different window manager / graphical shell (LXDE) and a different selection of default applications. For example, the default word processing tool is the lightweight, but powerful abiword rather than LibreOffice Writer, gnumeric instead of LibreOffice Calc, audacious for playing music etc.\nYou can achieve most of that just by changing the selection of installed software and selecting a session type from the login screen, but installing lubuntu-desktop will simplify this task. Moreover, as far as I understand it, installing lubuntu-desktop will not break your regular Ubuntu installation, you will be able to either use your regular Ubuntu desktop as well or remove lubuntu completely.\n", "Q: scroll in Microsoft USB mouse is not working properly I found wonder that up to Ubuntu 11.10, my Microsoft USB mouse scroll function worked properly, but after updating to 12.04 LTS, it just jumping like unevenly and jumpy.\nI replaced the  Microsoft USB mouse with ball it works okay.\nPlease help to rectify.\n\nA: It's a know bug which happen with a lot of Microsoft mice, the only solution I've found is to unplug it and plug it back.

I see references to PPA's, etc. for latest LibreOffice.\nMy question is more whether Ubuntu 12.04 LTS will get the latest stable releases of LibreOffice going forward?\n\nA: There will be minor and stable updates from the same series, that is 3.5.X for precise, but no update on the next major as it introduces a lot of new features. One man's feature are another man's regression (simply because behaviour changed). \nSo if you want a new major you need to try the PPA:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a PPA with the latest version of LibreOffice?\nSee also: \n\n\n*\n\n*State and Overview of LibreOffice Ubuntu Packages\n\nA: Only security patches are released, for version updates only way is via libreoffice ppa.\n", "Q: Laptop USB ports stop working: how to restart them without restarting the PC? \nPossible Duplicate:\nUSB slots stop working suddenly from time to time \n\nThe usb ports of my laptop fail for some reason from time to time.

So you have to edit (with sudo rights) /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf and do the two followings things :\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace Driver= by Driver=nvidia\n\n*Replace KernelDriver=nvidia-current by KernelDriver=nvidia\nThen reboot, and you should be fine for optirun.\n//end quote. \nSo the answer suggested of editing KernelDriver is correct, but needs 1 extra step due to the name change. In likelihood you probably have nouveau kicking around somewhere on your system which is overriding the nvidia driver when bumblebee goes to autodetect (if Driver= is left blank it tries to autodetect with nouveau winning out where you actually want nvidia).\nI had the same problem as you, tried this more-complete answer and now bumblebee / optirun work just fine. Hope it works for you, too.\n\nA: same problem. Renaming the drivers name solved the problem but\n\n\n*\n\n*I can't access external monitors (I could just before last update).

I've used this in the past as it is one of the few desktop sharing suites that works on Linux.\n\nA: If you are not going to use both of the screens, you can disable one of the monitors in order to have only one, while you present your webex.\nWhat happened to me is that I was sharing both of the screens to all the connected users, which led me eventually to disable my screen and use the projector's screen in order to present the webex.

I checked this post on AskUbuntu, but like the OP my BIOS does not have a setting for 'smart fan'. My BIOS though has something similar called 'Thermal Performance' wherein it's already set to maximum performance. \nBut using Hardware Sensors Indicator my fan speed barely reaches 3000 RPM (it's usually stuck around 2600 to 2700 RPM) compared to the indicated RPM of my laptop which is 5400 RPM.\nThere is a fan control setup for 10.04 specifically for Thinkpad here but I don't want to risk it since it's meant for a rather outdated distro already. \nIs there a way change the fan speed if I can't access it through BIOS?\nI'm using ThinkPad R61i 12.04 64-bit, 160 GB HDD, Intel T5870, 4 GB RAM.\n\nA: If you want direct control via the ThinkPad driver then the following wiki page is very helpful:\nhttp://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/How_to_control_fan_speed\n\nA: The link above has a perfect solution to the issue.

It does not seem to affect the speed so I obviously do have incoming connections and Transmission says the ports are open.\nSo I guess my question is why is this happening ?\n\nA: Deluge is a torrent client. While nobody is connecting to you, you are connecting to others through their forwarded ports. You can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable your firewall and allow it to pass the pots you have forwarded.\n\n*Use a different torrent with more seeders and peers(Sometimes called seeds, sources, and leechers). Please note that I, personally, do not condone the use of illegal peer-to-peer sources, and by seeding/using a torrent, you may be illegally sharing data depending on the content of the torrent.\n\n*Add a tracker that you think has more peers(I cannot recommend a tracker, sorry).\n\n*Add peers manually if you know their IP addresses and post numbers(They must be on the same torrent).\n\n*Try to bootstrap with DHT:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run a popular torrent with many peers\n\n*Keep that torrent paused while you run your slow torrent\n\n\n*Wait.\n\nNote that using BitTorrent(r) or using peer-to-peer services may be illegal in your area.

Running this from the Windows client should free it up:\nnet use * /del /yes\nnet use /persistent:no\n\nAlso, with Windows, you cannot map two drives to the same server with different credentials.

All these installations have the same user name with the same password. Specially I would like to share the Firefox History & Bookmarks, also than the Download folder. Anywhere I run the Gnome classic desktop. All the installed distributions are in the same disk.\n\nA: You really don't want to do this. Newer versions of applications may make incompatible changes to the configuration, which the older versions can't handle. As a result, when you do run the newer versions of Ubuntu, you may then have issues running the older versions, due to such incompatible changes.\nFor Firefox history/bookmarks, you probably should use Firefox Sync perhaps; though I don't know that it supports syncing history. For the Downloads folder, you could have it be on external storage, and simply mount that partition/drive under all the versions of Ubuntu, or you could use Ubuntu One to sync the folder as well.\n\nA: If you are dual booting multiple *buntu flavors (or any Linux distro really), I would highly recommend a separate /home partition. It removes configuration time for programs that are common to all your different distro installs. Firefox will use the config from your /home right off the bat instead of the default. Gnome, as well, will use the existing /home config files. At that point you only need to fill in the holes, installing the additional programs you prefer. \nThere is a more important reason than ease of configuration for a separate /home. Every time you install a new distro on the hard drive, you will be removing /home from that process.

And when I am trying to login via root user on terminal:\nimpuser@machine:~$ su - root\n\nit gives:\nsetgid:Operation not permitted\n\nany idea,How to resolve this issue?\n\nA: Ubuntu only allows sudo to increase privilege level, not su (unlike other distros). To get a root shell, try this:\nsudo su\n\n\nA: sudo -i\n\nFor an interactive root shell.  This has the benefit of also processing the .login and .profile scripts.\nsudo -s\n\nWill also give you a root shell but it will not process the root login scripts.\n\nA: If \"impuser\" is allowed to get root ( that means that he is not excluded from sudo rights in the /etc/sudoers file ) Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

I was just about to install Ubuntu on my notebook (Acer Aspire one) and I had to boot from USB because I've got no CD-ROM on  my PC. It seems pretty simple, but it keeps booting from the HDD as if the USB wasn't there... \n\nA: Have you set correct boot order in BIOS?  USB boot must be higher priority than booting from HDD.  If so try another brand of USB key, I've had weird issues before now.  Also how are you prepping USB key?\n\nA: Another issue with booting from USB is the format of the USB. Quite often I have seen USB formats not be recognized form one OS to another. Always format in fat16 or better yet fat32.

Today, I was asked to look for Scientific version(s) of Ubuntu. They actually are looking for tools to perform DNA sequence analysis, protein verification, estimations, and many biology related tasks.\nFirst:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a scientific, bio-oriented version of Ubuntu\n\n*Are there tools to do scientific analysis like the points mentioned above. \n\nA: Bio-Linux is a bioinformatics workstation on an Ubuntu base.\nBeyond that there's a whole host of biology-oriented programs/tools for Ubuntu, enumerated and elaborated on here.\n\nA: There is not, as far as I know, a specialised distribution for this purpose. \n(There exists a distribution called Scientific Linux, which is based on RedHat/Centos, but it is largely developed by and targets the needs of High Energy Physics (and does not have any general capabilities lacking in stock Ubuntu).)\nThere is a biology category (under science/engineering) with a collection of packages, although the number of specialised scientific applications packaged with ubuntu is relatively small (and I expect this would be also be the case for other distributions you might look at). Science+Engineering/Biology lists a few but doesn't appear to be up-to-date.\nThat said, many science tools, while not in the official respositories, provide ubuntu-compatible (.deb) packages you can download (eg libSBML), or generic linux binaries (eg Copasi), or are platform neutral (being written in java, python etc) and hence should run quite happily in Ubuntu (eg ImageJ).\nI use Ubuntu for computational biology work, although this predominantly involves working with general purpose tools (eg R, python) rather than specialised applications.\n\nA: I see there are several Ubuntu Science remixes available, but they all seem to have died. This seems to be the way with a lot of Ubuntu remixes, because many times they just don't offer a whole lot besides for just automatically installing some applications, so they don't get the critical mass needed for the developers to keep them up.\nMy suggestion would be to use a solid science-based distro, like Scientific Linux, which is what is used (and developed by) by Fermilab, CERN, etc. This is a distro that isn't going anywhere anytime soon, and has great support from the scientific community. Unfortunately, it is based on Red Hat, so it may not fit your needs perfectly.\nIf you need to use Ubuntu, there are several scientific applications available in the repos, just fire up Ubuntu Software Center and browse \"Science & Engineering\" -> Biology. I am not certain of the usefulness of these programs, as it is out of my expertise. If they were sufficient, you could set up a quick bash script that installed them all when you set up a new machine.\n\nA: I did some Googling on various Debian, RHEL and Virtal Machine based Operating Systems and Research tools for computational biology and bioinformatics. A few noteworthy are summarized below:\nDebian Med: a Debian operating system that is particularly well fit for the requirements for medical practice and biomedical research.\nDNALinux: is a Virtual Machine with bioinformatic software preinstalled.\nBioknoppix: is a customized distribution of Knoppix Linux Live CD. It comes with applications targeted for the molecular biologist. Beside using some RAM, Bioknoppix doesn't touch the host computer (because it's a Live-CD), and is ideal for demonstrations, molecular biology students, workshops, etc. \nVigyaan: (\"Vigyaan\" means \"Science\" in hindi. But this isn't a me too Scientific Linux). Vigyaan is an electronic workbench for bioinformatics, computational biology and computational chemistry. It has been designed to meet the needs of both beginners and experts. VigyaanCD is a live Linux CD containing all the required software to boot the computer with ready to use modeling software. VigyaanCD v1.0 is based on KNOPPIX v3.7.\nVLinux: is a Linux distribution and appliance for students and researchers in Bioinformatics. It is based on OpenSUSE and is built using Novell's Suse Studio. \nBioSLAX: is a new live CD/DVD suite of bioinformatics tools that has been released by the resource team of the BioInformatics Center (BIC), National University of Singapore (NUS). Bootable from any PC, this CD/DVD runs the compressed SLACKWARE flavour of the LINUX operating system also known as SLAX. \nBio-Linux 6.0: is a fully featured, powerful, configurable and easy to maintain bioinformatics workstation. Bio-Linux provides more than 500 bioinformatics programs on an Ubuntu Linux 10.04 base. There is a graphical menu for bioinformatics programs, as well as easy access to the Bio-Linux bioinformatics documentation system and sample data useful for testing programs. You can also install Bio-Linux packages to handle new generation sequence data types.\n\nMy opinion as a bioinformatician is to download and run any Linux flavour that suits you. Almost all are free to download and use.In my research work, I use Ubuntu and CentOS. I will share my experience.\nCentOS: If you install all libraries during setup, you  will not encounter much problems later. I have used Molecular Dynamics package AMBER and Desmond on it. It runs generally without posing much problems.\nUbuntu: Since it does not come with many libraries pre-installed, you must know where to find information about running a software on it. However, since Ubuntu is very popular among researchers, I find no reason why you should not try it. If you encounter any difficulty installing or running a software, you can post questions on specific mailing lists related to that particular software.\nIn Ubuntu software centre programs like Pymol, AutoDock, Unipro UGENE etc. are available. Gromacs was available earlier (I did not find it in 12.04). \nI would strongly suggest you to take one time effort and install all your useful software on Ubuntu and then use Remastersys to make copies of your OS to put it on as many Desktops and Workstations you wish.\nPersonally, I see an immense scope in having a specialized Linux OS targeted for biology and chemistry research audience.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: Nvidia GT218 repository drivers don't work I upgraded all packages with sudo apt-get upgrade command on my Ubuntu 10.04 box and I have Ubuntu 12.04 3.2.0-29-generic-pae now.

I'm trying to track down why and when a particular directory is created in my home folder.\nI've learned I can utilize lsof | grep /home/**myusername**/**mysteriousfolder** to discover the file or process responsible for creating the folder. \nUnfortunately, if the responsible process/file is no longer running, the suggested command gives no output.  As of yet, I have been unable to catch it 'in the act.'\nI'm looking for a log I can parse to discover when exactly this folder is getting created.\nSo I'm realizing I can at least do ls -ld and view the 'last modified' date but I'm still curious if any log file exists.\n\nA: There is no general log for the home folder that details when files and folders were created; the system logs record a number of things, including when software is installed, and often a hidden folder is created in the home folder when you add software, so you might be able to infer when that was created and where it came from by looking at the system logs.\nOn your system, files and folders are not marked with the time they were created; as you can see below with the stat command only the access (atime), modify (mtime) and inode change times (ctime) are listed. \nFull output from stat ~/Downloads:\n  File: `/home/mike/Downloads'\n  Size: 53248       Blocks: 104        IO Block: 4096   directory\nDevice: 801h/2049d  Inode: 6291653     Links: 38\nAccess: (0755/drwxr-xr-x)  Uid: ( 1000/    mike)   Gid: ( 1000/    mike)\nAccess: 2012-08-20 11:54:35.024905317 +0100\nModify: 2012-08-20 11:54:33.980904809 +0100\nChange: 2012-08-20 11:54:33.980904809 +0100\n Birth: -\n\nYou can use fuser to see what processes are accessing which folders; for example, to view those processes related to your overall home folder, enter:\nfuser -v /home/mike\n\nIf you are concerned that something unauthorised is accessing your home folder I should take a look at the suggestions I made here in this article about searching for files having been modified by a person who is not your user.\nSome programs create logs and these might log their activities, but they can be difficult to search as a whole without going through your entire home folder. If you want to monitor yourself you could install some software that logs and monitors everything you do.\nIf you want to monitor and record to file everything typed into your interactive bash terminal (including mkdir commands), you could put this clever use of the trap command into your .bashrc. \n", "Q: PDF to XML sure thing, but the other way around? This is my first post so excuse me if I'm breaking any conventions.\nWell the thing is I'm developing a long term archive system in Ubuntu environment. For different reasons XML is a very strong format for long term archiving and there are numerous systems on the market today that's offering export functions to the XML format.\nThe XML format it self contains no graphical information what so ever of how, for instance a PDF-file looked like, just the written information and embedded pics it once contained.\nSo given I have a certain PDF-file it's possible to strip it down to XML and then rebuilt it once again to the PDF-file it once was - at least in theory.\nIn Linux you could do this from CLI with the help of XSLTPROC and FOP in two steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*xsltproc file.xsl file.xml > file.fo\n\n*fop file.fo file.pdf\n\n\nThe absolutely crucial file here - if you want to rebuild it just the way it was - is the XSL-file. \nI have found hundreds of posts discussing how to create XSL-files by hand but NONE regarding any software that could analyse the XSL-structure of a PDF-file.\nI just reckon if it's possible to transform from XML-XSL-FO-PDF it must be possible to do this process backwards? Anyone has any ideas?\nPaul\n\nA: PDFs don't store or use XSLT information - they are a completely different markup language format, which does not have a strong division between formatting and content like XML/XSL.  \nThe reason you haven't found any automatic way to convert from a PDF to an XML/XSL is because that would depend heavily on the specific files and formatting being used, and so it would be nearly impossible to write something generic that actually worked.\nYour best bet would be to extract the text content from the PDF files using something like pstotext, then write a custom script to build an XML file from that which matches the original.  This would essentially be a one-off solution, and would be fairly fragile and prone to breakage.\nA better solution would be to just archive the PDFs. \n", "Q: Problems after running unity-reset After installing compiz-config on Ubuntu 12.04, my whole desktop settings got disturbed.

I just got my new Asus laptop today, and after installing Ubuntu I experienced some weird mouse behaviour, at least a new behaviour to me. It seems the mouse is in Mac-theme, no right clicking but two-finger tapping etc. I also see, what I would call, anchor points around the windows, I would like those gone.\nLeft-clicking and dragging, e.g., a scroll bar does not work, as the area that gets pressed down is a part of the touchpad. Since multitouch is not supported, clicking with one finger and dragging with another does not work.\nFor clarification, both buttons behaves like left click.\nLaptop is an ASUS N56VZ\n\n\nA: I have the same computer, and Ubuntu has added some cool multi-touch features that you seem to have discovered (the same way I did!) by accident. \n\n\n*\n\n*a one finger touch works as a left click\n\n*a two finger touch works as a right click\n\n*a three finger touch brings up what you see in the picture you posted, a quick way to move or resize a window\n\n*a four finder touch brings up dash\n\n*a one finger touch in the top right corner acts as a middle click (for example, doing this over a hyperlink in a browser opens the link in a new tab).\n\n\nThere are a couple of gestures and other things that you can do with three or four fingers, you can see the list at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Multitouch.\nYou can still press on the touchpad for normal left and right clicks like you do on a Mac, just make sure you press down at the bottom of the touchpad, that's the only part that will move (again like a Mac). You can also click and drag by pressing the touchpad this way.\nHope this helped!\n", "Q: Need a way to automatically move files on a daily basis My Ubuntu system is set up as an FTP server. I have several networked security cameras which send hundreds of MPEG4 video clips to the FTP server every day. These files are stored on a USB-attached external HDD. Each file is about 1.5MB. This works well. The computer is an old laptop with minimal processing power but its only purpose is to save the FTP'd files. I'm running 12.04.\nMy problem is that the folders the video clips are stored in eventually have thousands of files. Just to open a folder to view the clips takes up to a half hour. And forget about trying to drag/drop these files to another folder - that will take hours or days.\nWhat I would like to do is, on a daily basis, have all files older than a week moved to a series of backup folders that are created automatically and named by the year/month/week. This will keep the number of files in each folder manageable and readily indexed by the week of the year. No need to compress the files as they are already MPEG4 and I have plenty of storage.\nI've looked at several backup/archival apps and just can't seem to find something that will do what I need. Are there any apps that can do such a thing? If not, I imagine a cron job that runs a script would be appropriate but from what I've read up on so far, it's getting too complex for my experience level with Linux command line.\nThanks.\n\nA: in command line\nuse crontab -e.\nYou will need to look up the details under man crontab.

The schedule needs to be as describe in man crontab when and how often to run command.\n\n*The command will be something likecd /media/usb0; mkdir `date +%Y-%m-%d`; mv *.mpg `date +%Y-%m-%d`\nI think that either a crontab or other shcheduled task that runs the command in item 3 is going to be the most widely understood answer. I am not aware of any GUI programs, but then again, I never looked.\n\nA: I've used gnome-schedule,  and it is sufficient for needs. \nIt has a very simple UI. \nYou can download it from the Ubuntu software center.\n\n\nA: If you have access to these folders through FTP account, you can use AutoFileMove to setup a schedule which will transfer files older than X number of days to the other folder automatically.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 Boot Freeze At Purple Screen \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat should I do when Ubuntu freezes? \n\nIn the last week or so Ubuntu has started freezing on boot, showing only a purple screen.

I have the following bash command:\n$(ls -l /var/ | grep www) > cat folder_exists\n\nbut it is not working properly. What I hope to achieve is a command, that checks to see if there is a www folder located inside the /var/ folder, and prints the result of that particular command to the file folder_exists. I have also tried to retype the command numerous times, example given\ncat $(ls -l /var/ | grep www) > folder_exists\n\nor even\ncat $(ls -l /var | grep www) > folder_exists\n\njust in case that slash did the damage, but to no avail.\nMy problem is that even though I am creating the file folder_exists, I fail to print the output to it. Could somebody please show me where I have gone wrong?\n\nA: Better do that:\nif [ -d /var/www ] ; then touch folder_exists ; else touch folder_absent ; fi\n\nThe first version of the command does the following: $( ... ) is first replaced by whatever was produced by .... Since you call ls -l | grep www, you are either getting a line with multiple words, or nothing. In the first case it is attempted to be executed, but that makes little sense. What will you get if you type\ndrwxr-xr-x 15 root root     4096 Aug 20 13:48 log\n\nat the command prompt? There is no command called drwxr-xr-x. If you use the cat $( ls -l /var | grep www) form, then first the $( ... ) is replaced by what was produced by ..., then cat interpretes it as a list of files to cat (starting with drwxr-xr-x; most likely, there is no such file).\nMoreover, if you attempt to do something like that:\ncommand > cat file\n\nWhat will happen is that cat is interpreted as a filename to store the output of command, and not as a command. To interpret cat as a command, you need a pipe sign, like you correctly used in ls | grep:\ncommand | cat\n\nHowever, if your purpose is to store the output of command in a file, then just use\ncommand > file\n\nAs a matter of fact, you could do\nls /var | grep www > file\n\nThis file will be empty only if there is no www folder in ls. But beware! if there is a folder  /var/ewwwocks, then the file will also contain a line. Better to use simply\nls /var/www > file\n\nLong story short, use the conditional construct if ... ; then ... ; else ... ; fi\n\nA: Remove the parenthesis. \n ls -l /var/ | grep www > folder_exists\n\nWorks just fine.\n\nA: The -l argument to ls causes it to include a lot of extraneous information that will muck up grep. The correct command would be ls -a /var/ | grep www > folder_exists.\n\nA: I would suggest using find for such a task:\nfind /var -type d -name '*www*' -maxdepth 1\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-name '*www*' matches anything named something with www, use -iname if the match should be case insensitive.\n\n*find is recursive by default, so the maxdepth option ensures that only /var/*www* are matched. \n\n*-type d specifies that it should be a directory.\n\n", "Q: Lightweight image-viewing app to slideshow images and animated gif in random order I am trying to find the lightest possible image viewing program to perform a very specific task.\nI have a large folder of images in various formats (jpg, png, gif).

You could also install 11.10 and then upgrade to 12.04, or go with Xubuntu.\n\nA: No need to fret. The alternate install (ubuntu-12.04-alternate-i386) is text-based in that there won't be pretty graphics to choose your location and pictures to entertain you during the install. It will, however, guide you through all the install steps and give you choices to make.

It should match this string: bcee4c03b704a9b62988505b7d8f3069, as reported here: http://ubuntu.virginmedia.com/releases/precise/MD5SUMS\nTo do that, open a command line (CTRL+ALT+T), navigate to wherever you downloaded the torrent, and type this: md5sum ubuntu-12.04-alternate-i386.iso and hit Enter. (Hint: you can write md5sum ubu and hit TAB. If it's the only file that starts with that word in that directory, it will auto-complete the file name)\nIf the string matches, we can move on the next step, if not, throw that away and download it again.\nOnce the string matches, create an install CD or install USB and just install as you normally do.\n", "Q: How do I edit the autosave interval of gedit?

My /etc/fstab now looks like this: \n# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>\nproc            /proc           proc    nodev,noexec,nosuid 0       0\n\n# Ubuntu /dev/sda6\nUUID=581c89aa-d71c-460c-96c0-04f188fe862a /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0 1\n\n# swap /dev/sda5\nUUID=99b951b9-1a57-43ee-938e-fe31b1ba754f none            swap    sw           $\n\n# Windows /dev/sda3\nUUID=12AA9E31AA9E1179         /media/12AA9E31AA9E1179     ntfs    errors=remount-r0 0 2\n\nI am trying to mount it by opening a file browser and simply clicking the drive with my mouse.

You may also want to check the permissions of the folder that you are mounting to (/media/12AA9E31AA9E1179) when the drive is unmounted and make sure that your other users have access to this folder.\nAlso, here is some more useful information on fstab.\nIf you want to be able to manually mount and unmount the drive from Nautilus, just remove the line altogether, or comment it out with a #. That will leave it up to Nautilus to mount/unmount it, which works better in that case.\n\nA: To be able to mount the partition from Nautilus (Ubuntu's default file browser) you shouldn't need any entry in /etc/fstab, and it's likely that removing the entry entirely will allow you to mount the partition via nautilus again. If you want to be able to mount the partition from the terminal as your user, you can use the command udisks --mount /dev/sda3.\n\nA: Try mounting your NTFS drives in the \"/media\" folder and your *nix drives in the \"/mnt\" folder this should solve your problem :)\nFYI, the reason you add entries to the /etc/fstab file is so that the system can \"automount\" them at at boot time, and for convenience i.e. when you use \n$ sudo mount -atO, (mount all the entries in the fstab file!)\nyou can, however, just mount/unmount any drive at any time using...\nmount -t type device dir\numount dir\ni.e. $ sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda3 /media/Windows7\nand $ sudo umount /media/Windows7\nAlso make sure you create a folder in the \"/media\" folder first to mount the drive i.e. \n$ sudo mkdir /media/Windows7\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How to remove gnome from login screen after uninstalling gnome shell I tried gnome-shell but didn't quite like it.

I am very interested in getting a quad monitor setup using Ubuntu 12.04. Is this possible with Unity? Will Nvidia X Server automatically detect and configure all 4 monitors making things easy?\nI have dug up some bits and pieces of information here and there but don't know what to make of everything.\n\nA: Quad monitors are certainly possible, here's my setup driven by 2 NVidia cards (using the proprietary NVidia driver):\n\nalthough, in my particular setup, I wasn't able to make 3D acceleration work, but, as I remember, this was more a requirement of having two of the monitors rotated than having 4 monitors.\nAlso, I'm not using Unity, the window manager is XMonad, which I would recommend very much for such a setup unless you want to spend hours dragging windows from monitor to monitor and arranging them manually. \nI'm using a custom xorg.conf file because, as I remember, I had to specify individual PCI bus IDs for each card to be able to use them - you may be luckier, but generally setting up a multi-monitor machine is an exercise from the \"advanced\" chapter of the book, do not expect full plug-and-play* (see update below). Again, in my case, rotated monitors complicated the matter a bit.\nHere's my xorg.conf:\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"Layout0\"\n    Screen      0  \"Screen0\" RightOf \"Screen3\"\n    Screen      1  \"Screen1\" 0 0\n    Screen      2  \"Screen2\" RightOf \"Screen1\"\n    Screen      3  \"Screen3\" RightOf \"Screen2\"\n\n    Option         \"Xinerama\" \"1\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Files\"\nEndSection\n\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    # HorizSync source: edid, VertRefresh source: edid\n    Identifier     \"Monitor3\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"SamsungSyncMaster\"\n    HorizSync       30.0 - 84.0\n    VertRefresh     56.0 - 76.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\n    Option         \"Rotate\" \"Left\"\nEndSection\n\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    # HorizSync source: edid, VertRefresh source: edid\n    Identifier     \"Monitor2\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"Dell 2007 WFP\"\n    HorizSync       30.0 - 84.0\n    VertRefresh     56.0 - 76.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\n    Option         \"Rotate\" \"Left\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    # HorizSync source: edid, VertRefresh source: edid\n    Identifier     \"Monitor1\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"BENQ\"\n    HorizSync       30.0 - 81.0\n    VertRefresh     56.0 - 75.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    # HorizSync source: edid, VertRefresh source: edid\n    Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"BenQ FP222W\"\n    HorizSync       30.0 - 84.0\n    VertRefresh     56.0 - 76.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device3\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"GeForce 210\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:3:0:0\"\n    Screen     1\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device2\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"GeForce 8400 GS\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:2:0:0\"\n    Screen          1\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device1\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"GeForce 210\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:3:0:0\"\n    Screen         0\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device0\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"GeForce 8400 GS\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:2:0:0\"\n    Screen          0\nEndSection\n\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen3\"\n    Device         \"Device3\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor3\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"TwinView\" \"0\"\n    Option         \"metamodes\" \"DFP: nvidia-auto-select +0+0\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen2\"\n    Device         \"Device2\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor2\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"TwinView\" \"0\"\n    Option         \"metamodes\" \"DFP: nvidia-auto-select +0+0\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen1\"\n    Device         \"Device1\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor1\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"TwinView\" \"0\"\n    Option         \"TwinViewXineramaInfoOrder\" \"CRT-0\"\n    Option         \"metamodes\" \"nvidia-auto-select +0+0\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen0\"\n    Device         \"Device0\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"TwinView\" \"0\"\n    Option         \"metamodes\" \"CRT: nvidia-auto-select +0+0\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nNow I'm pretty confident it is possible to plug another video card and extend this to a 6-monitor setup, but I feel the limited flexibility of my neck would not allow me to make a good use of 6 monitors :)\n* Mid-2015 UPDATE: Recently I had to boot this machine from a USB stick with Kubuntu 15.04. I have to report that, to my amazement, it recognized and was able to use all 4 monitors without any manual setup (in portrait orientation). Rotating the monitors didn't quite work, but still the progress is impressive - I'm quite sure it only used one or two monitors previously. So I suspect that if you don't want portrait monitors, Kubuntu might work for you out of the box without any tweaks.\n\nA: I was also able to get quad monitors setup. I did use unity, though I was stuck on unity 2d. The setup was not perfect, there were flaws, but having the extra screen real estate made the hassle worth it.\nWhat kind of flaws? each pair of monitors were treated like a single monitor. Therefor, hitting the maximize button would cause the window to span across two monitors instead of one. Also the feature where you can drag windows to the edge and have it fill up half the screen was broken. Once in a while if I was trying to play a video on monitors 3 or 4, the video would freeze up even thought the audio would keep playing. There were some other glitches like that.\nThe setup was painful! I spent HOURS digging through blog posts and searching here before I finally figured it out with trial and error.\nAs Sergey said, you have to use the proprietary NVidia drivers. I don't remember where I found them, but you will not get this to work with the nvidia drivers that auto install. believe me, I have tried! Then you have to build your xorg.conf manually, identifying the hardware and setting the proper settings.\nSadly, back in the Ubuntu 10.x days, this was actually pretty easy... almost plug and play. That all went away with 11.04. =(  Things have gotten better little by little since then, but it's FAR from perfect.\n", "Q: How do I integrate my Windows filesystem with Ubuntu? I recently got a new Windows computer and would like to dual boot with Ubuntu. I don't really want to have 2 separate file systems (with mounting) but would like to integrate the two, if it is possible. Like for example I would like my /home/name/Pictures to have the same content as the Pictures folder in My Documents in windows, /home/name/Downloads to be the same as the Downloads folder in windows, Music to be the same as the window's Music folder, and even Desktop if possible. I understand some folders would have to be different, like AppData in windows would not be able to work properly so some duplicates might be necessary.\nIs this at all possible? I hate how having Ubuntu feels like having a new computer all together and would like some unity (no pun intended).\nThanks.\n\nA: Type this in terminal\ngedit ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs\n\nand link up to the absolute path of the windows folders. Then you can just \"killall nautilus\" or possibly reboot. \n\nA: Prerequisites\nYou have to have the Windows partition mounted in Ubuntu to make the following work .\nRedirecting special folders\nAn equivalent of special folders (My Documents, My Music, My Pictures, etc) known from Windows folders was defined by the freedesktop.org project. The correspondig configuration file ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs is managed by the xdg-user-dirs-update command.\nYou could, for example, change the download directory by executing the following command in the terminal:\nxdg-user-dirs-update --set DOWNLOAD /mnt/<WINDOWS_PARTITION>/users/<YOU>/Downloads\n\nAnother way to achieve the same is to manually replace $HOME/Downloads by /mnt/<WINDOWS_PARTITION>/users/<YOU>/Downloads in the configuration file (e.g. in gedit or nano).\nTo have the changes take effect run xdg-user-dirs-gtk-update afterwards and additionally xdg-user-dirs-update if you have edited the configuration file by hand.\nRedirecting  regular folders\nYou can also replace folders on your Ubuntu home folder with symbolic links to the folders on your Windows partition e.g.:\nln -s /mnt/<WINDOWS_PARTITION>/users/<YOU>/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/<YOUR_PROFILE.default> ~/.mozilla/firefox/<YOUR_PROFILE.default>\n\nThat is a very simple solution and it does not work for everything, it might cause issues in some cases. However some people share settings for Firefox and Thunderbird that way.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible. I don't think it will display the same way since they use different icon sets. It should however display the same files and folders you may have placed on your desktop.\nThe problem you will likely run into with those is that windows references those files and folders from different relative starting points. (If you click them you'll get a \"File not found\" error.)  \nIf, for some reason, you wish to continue, find your Ubuntu \"Desktop\" folder in your home folder.  Rename it to something else like \"desktop.bak\" so you can undo this later.\nOpen a terminal and enter 'ln -s /path_to/windows/Desktop Desktop'  \nOpen your home folder and click on the new Desktop link. You should see the files and folders referenced on your Windows desktop. (For curiosity's sake, try clicking on them and see if any of them work.)  \nYou should be able to log out and back in to see what you have on your desktop. If you find this isn't what you wanted, just delete the symlinked \"Desktop\" and rename the \"desktop.bak\" to \"Desktop\".\n\nA: Mount the Windows partition, then mount --bind its directories under your home. This makes your applications access the Windows partition transparently.\n", "Q: I want to do a bridge between ubuntu and my ps3 Hello I have been trying to put bridge mode on ubuntu basically my setup I've got a router upstairs that I usually get wireless to my laptop which is connected ethernet to my ps3, so my ps3 gets connected through my laptop\n             ethernet\n\nWIFI ---- LAPTOP ----------- PS3\nNow on winxp this doesn't pose me a problem at all I just select local area connection and the wireless connection just select them and click create bridge.\nHowewer in Ubuntu I couldn't do it, so I started looking around etc and setting manually then I installed bridge-utils, firestarter and netbridge still nothing\nThen i used the command sudo ifconfig.\nI was looking to see if I add any device with that unknown mac address for eth0 which I hadn't so I looked around more and there is an utility that changes the mac address.

In UEFI BIOS settings I can see sometimes a Windows Boot Manager and other times (?) a \"UEFI Intel\" entry for INTEL HDD  and Windows will boot properly selecting the one available at that time. \nI installed Ubuntu 14.04 after Windows 7 without changing any UEFI/BIOS settings. It works fine only if the BIOS is set with the Ubuntu partition as the first drive to boot in AHCI mode.\nIf both SSD drives are connected, the Windows 7 Intel boot drive can be chosen as first boot device but only as an \"AHCI Intel drive\" (neither Windows Boot Manager nor UEFI Intel device options are available in the BIOS boot menu) and Windows 7 will not load properly as long as the Ubuntu Crucial SSD is not physically disconnected. Windows will try, start booting for few seconds but will fail replacing the Windows 7 logo and that startup animation with with the old white progress bar and then and will notify that there is a issue and prompt the user to try to Load Windows 7 in Normal Mode again or try Recovery Mode in order to fix it.\nIf I let Windows Intel HDD boot via BIOS/UEFI - Windows Boot Manager selection, I may see the purple screen of grub2 is loaded for a while, but there's no selection for Ubuntu or Windows and/or then machine is not booting, showing a black screen and a small command prompt cursor blinking on top.\nSo far the only option I see to have Ubuntu boot side-by-side with Windows 7 is to reformat the Windows 7 SSD and set it boot in legacy mode with an MBR instead of GPT. \nPer my understanding this is a quite complex issue to fix (Rod Smith's answer was pretty helpful: UEFI boot on my Asus k52f) but any other suggestions are welcome.\nI find a bit odd that I can boot properly Windows7 SSD or an Ubuntu DVD using a DVD drive set in UEFI/BIOS in \"AHCI mode\" and w/ using \"UEFI/Windows Boot Manager\" booting option, but I cannot boot a secondary SSD/HDD with Ubuntu having the same UEFI/BIOS boot configuration. It looks like plugging in the second SSD [the Ubuntu partition] is interfering with the boot options in UEFI/BIOS.\n\nA: I reverted the Windows SSD to MBR and everything went back to normal. \nI don't miss the UEFI with GPT partitioning anyway, since while using MBR the boot time is faster for Windows 7 while using MBR (20 seconds). Ubuntu boots in 15 seconds and there's no longer any conflict between the Windows 7 and Ubuntu drives. \n", "Q: Where does apt-get install libqt4?

Does anyone know where the $*(^#$(&^# apt-get installs them?\n\nA: The library files are usually in /usr/include/qt4. The qmake is in /usr/bin/qmake-qt4 (or /usr/bin/qt4-qmake, I forget). You may have to symbolic link /usr/bin/qmake to either of these.\nPerhaps your application expected the files to be in /usr/local/include... and /usr/local/bin... like some other distrubutions?\n\nA: So, after following roadmr's advice, I was able to find out that the libraries were installed in:\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/\n\nHowever, to set up QtCreator, one need only find the location of the qmake executable, which I believe Bodie was hinting at.

It's mature, well-tested, good performance, and has good tools and lots of self-support resources out there, on websites like AskUbuntu.com and UbuntuForums.com, if you every have any problems.\n\nA: MythTV's filesystem requirements (streaming, large files etc.) look very similar to what you're describing. They have a wiki page discussing choosing a filesystem for media storage. Their recommendation is\n\nIn short, a good choice is ext3 or ReiserFS for your system partitions\n  and JFS or XFS for your MythTV storage.

I am running Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS i686 on VirtulBox. Every time I check the updates, there's a new Linux kernel. If I install the new kernel, I have to install the Virtulbox Guest Additions again and reboot the server. I don't want to do this every week. I know I can manually uncheck the kernel packages from update manager, but is there a way to skip the kernel update automatically? I found an answer here, but it's for Ubuntu 10. Thanks.\n\nA: The one-liner by Christoph doesn't take the extra package into account (e.g. linux-image-extra-3.13.0-45-generic). Rather use this one:\nfor i in $(dpkg -l \"*$(uname -r)*\" | grep image | awk '{print $2}'); do echo $i hold | dpkg --set-selections; done\n\nA: In relation superlexx's suggestion: that line will miss the \"headers\" package:\ndpkg -l \"*$(uname -r)*\" | grep image | awk '{print $2}'\nlinux-image-3.13.0-48-generic\nlinux-image-extra-3.13.0-48-generic\n\nSo how about simply using the following:\ndpkg -l \"*$(uname -r)*\" | grep kernel | awk '{print $2}'\nlinux-headers-3.13.0-48-generic\nlinux-image-3.13.0-48-generic\nlinux-image-extra-3.13.0-48-generic\n\n\nA: APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) is the system that Ubuntu uses to manage all of the software installed on a system. It allows you to “pin” a package to a certain version, so that it won’t be updated when you the Update Manager runs.\nTo pin your kernel packages, first you must determine what version your kernel is. One way to do this is to open the Synaptic Package Manager in System > Administration.\n\nType in “linux-generic” in the Quick search text field and hit enter.\n\nMake a note of the number listed in the “Installed Version” column. We’ll use it in the next step.\nNext, we need to edit the file /etc/apt/preferences. Open it by pressing Alt+F2 to bring up the Run Application window and entering in:\ngksudo gedit /etc/apt/preferences\n\n\nThis will open up a gedit window. Most likely the window will be blank, unless you’ve played around with APT before.\nIn the window, type in the following, replacing the version number with the version number you found in the Synaptic Package Manager.\nPackage: linux-generic linux-headers-generic linux-image-generic linux-restricted-modules-generic\nPin: version <insert version here>\nPin-Priority: 1001\n\n\nSave the file and close gedit. If you open the Update Manager, you should see that the Linux kernel updates are now hidden!\n\nSource\nBlocking packages with APT/DPKG\nRemember the package name of your kernel from above.\nOpen a terminal and run:\nsudo -s\n\nAnd hit enter.\nEnter your password for sudo:\necho kernel_package_name hold | dpkg --set-selections\n\nReplace kernel_package_name with the name of the kernel you want to pin.\nNow run:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nTo remove pin from Apt/Dpkg:\nOpen a terminal\nsudo -s\necho kernel_package install | dpkg --set-selections\n\nReplace kernel_package with the package you want to pin.\nNow run:\nsudo apt-get update &&  sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nSource \nWhat you're trying to do is called pinning. The sources I gave you above, have the essentials on what you must do to accomplish your tasks in hand.\n\nA: In one line it is:\necho $(dpkg -l \"*$(uname -r)*\" | grep image | awk '{print $2}') hold | dpkg --set-selections\n\nThis will set kernel's image state from install to hold and thus will prevent updates.\n\nA: This purges meta kernel packages that enable kernel updates:\nsudo apt purge $(apt-cache rdepends -i --installed linux-{headers,image}-$(uname -r)|awk '!/[0-9]/ && /^[ ]/{print $1}')\n\n(If you have just upgraded kernel, you have to reboot first with the new kernel, or find the latest kernel release and use it in above instead of \"$(uname -r)\".)\nIt is recommended to install kernels updates though since they are mostly security updates.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 16.04.1, the following code works\nfor i in $(dpkg -l \"*$(uname -r)*\" | grep image | awk '{print $2}'); do echo $i hold | sudo dpkg --set-selections; done\n\nthe is an improvement of Superlexx's code, the sudo is added\ndpkg -l | grep linux-image\n\nYou will find:\n\nhi  linux-image-4.4.0-34-generic ...\nhi  linux-image-extra-4.4.0-34-generic ...\n\nnote that the tag now reads hi, not ii\nto remove pin\nfor i in $(dpkg -l \"*$(uname -r)*\" | grep image | awk '{print $2}'); do echo $i install | sudo dpkg --set-selections; done\n\n\nA: Shorter version: (Replace \"hold\" with \"install\" to remove pin)\n dpkg -l \"*$(uname -r)*\" | grep kernel | awk '{print $2,\"hold\"}' | sudo dpkg --set-selections\n\nTo see the state of all kernel images and headers, run:\n dpkg --get-selections | grep \"linux-\"\n\n", "Q: Avoid the yellow message at the top of the gnome-terminal window that states \"The child process exited normally with status 0.\" I have a gnome-terminal profile created with \"When the command exists: Hold the terminal open\" set.

I have a Dell server on which I have installed Ubuntu Server Edition.  I had it running with two arrays (one RAID 1, the other a RAID 5).

I think it would be easier to simply re-install, however whenever I try to re-install it prompts me to format my RAID 5 array (which has my data).  Any ideas/tips/anything would be very much appreciated!\n\nA: I take it you have a bootable installation disk or USB key.  This should be able to discover your root and/or boot partitions.  Try running fsck on these partitions when they aren't mounted.  This would be my preferred recovery mechanism.  Before actually changing the data you may want to use the no-action flag.  Once your system is bootable, it should run any appropriate recovery when it reboots. \nIf you do opt to reinstall, you can overwrite the existing root partition.  Back it up before you do so as you may need to recover some of the data that is stored there.  Most importantly your mount structure, but likely some other configuration information.  \nWhen asking for help it helps to be specific about the problem.  Does the system fail to boot at all?  Can you bring it up in single user mode?  Does it fail to find the root partition?  Does it mount the root partition read-only?\nEDIT:  Ubuntu should give you a startup splash page.  If you have an install disk for the version it may have recovery boot option that will allow you to boot into your normal server installation from the disk.  I haven't done this in a while, but the help pages are usually bound to Function keys.

To click an item in the context menu, I click it normally with the right mouse button.\nI have experienced this behavior in Chrome, the file browser, and in gnome terminal. The mouse is a Razer DeathAdder (but I'm just running whatever drivers Ubuntu picked automatically), and if it matters, I'm using the AMD/ATI graphics drivers.\n\nA: If you do not move your mouse in the meanwhile, there should not be any \"menu item under cursor\". The context menu opens such that its left upper corner is at the cursor, and there is a margin below to the next menu item.\nHowever, if on mouse-button-release there is a menu item under the cursor, the desired behavior is to launch that menu item. This his how you (or at least many people) normally proceed: mouse-button-down, move the cursor to the desired menu item, mouse-button-release to activate that item.\nIf there is no menu-item under cursor after mouse-button-down, then the behavior is as you described: mouse-button-release does not destroy the context menu.\nSo maybe your mouse is very sensitive, and a button-down event is accompanied by a cursor move?\n\nA: Here is my fix:\nFirst, you need to compile and install sxhkd, from here:\nhttps://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd\nwhich is a really cool program.\nThen, in your ~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc add this recipe:\n~button3\n  for id in `xinput list | grep 'slave  pointer' | grep -v XTEST | sed -e 's/.*id=\\([0-9]\\+\\).*/\\1/'`; do xinput set-prop $id \"Device Enabled\" 0; done; \\  \n  xte 'mouseup 3' 'mousermove 0 -1'; \\ \n  sleep 0.3; \\\n  for id in `xinput list | grep 'slave  pointer' | grep -v XTEST | sed -e 's/.*id=\\([0-9]\\+\\).*/\\1/'`; do xinput set-prop $id \"Device Enabled\" 1; done\n\nHow this works, sxhkd captures the right click event with its xcb listener, and replays it back, this is what the tilde is for. After this, we turn off the touchpad, move the mouse cursor one pixel up so that the first entry is not highlighted, sleep for 300ms to ignore any finger dragging after the click that throws off the position, and reenable the pointer devices.\nThis works perfectly on the chromebook I am setting up.\nUPDATE: I changed the sxhkd recipe to work with all pointer input devices, not just touchpads.\n\nA: This is the default behavior. You will experience the same thing even in Nautilus, which is the default manager. Actually, you will experience it everywhere. If you right click somewhere and you see a context menu, and, without releasing your right click, you hover above an action of the context menu and then release it, the corresponding action will be launched.\nI can confirm this in all the programs I tried it into, thus, this is the default behavior under Ubuntu (and I find it handy, rather than having to manually left click to an action of the context menu)\n", "Q: Customizing 12.04 from terminal I recently read a blog post on customizing Ubuntu 9.04 (I believe) via the terminal.

And it always says that everytime i try to download something.\n\nA: If you're trying to open a .exe file, it's likely not going to work. Ubuntu uses different files to install software. In particular, iTunes is not developed for Ubuntu or any distribution of Linux. See here for the difference between installing software on Ubuntu versus Windows.\nTo browse and install Software, check out the Software Center. More information here.\nYou can browse the packages available for Ubuntu here: https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/.\n", "Q: Dpkg error when trying to uninstall java I have been trying to uninstall jre6 but I keep getting the error\ndpkg: warning: there's no installed package matching sun-java6-jre:amd64\nI've tried\nsudo apt-get --purge remove sun-java6\\* vim\nand\nsudo apt-get purge sun-java6-\\* I just want to remove it so I can install JDK7.\n\nA: First off, I believe the uninstall is failing because you don't have the package name exactly right. You do not need to uninstall the old version as there is a way for you to choose which you would prefer to use. Enter this command in terminal:\nsudo update-alternatives --config java\n\nThe versions of Java currently installed on your system will appear for you to choose from. Keeping both can come in handy as some applications may work better with one or the other. After you have made your choice, enter this command in terminal:\njava -version\n\nThat will tell you which version is currently in use to confirm your changes\n\nA: If you ever get a dpkg error. Use the following to purge to dpkg (this is an extreme measure)\nsudo dpkg -P sun-java6-jre\nThis should delete all remnants of sun-java6-jre .\n", "Q: Unable to install 10.04 after removing 12.04 My laptop was dual booting Windows XP and Ubuntu 10.04.\nRecently I completely formatted my 250 GB HDD and installed Windows XP in a 5GB partition.

What's the difference between Ubuntu 12.04 LTS for free and the Official CD of Ubuntu for $5? I didn't know the difference. \n\nA: There's no difference. The CD is just an annual thing they do for people with slow connections and to raise funds for Ubuntu.\n\nA: They charge the cost for the CD/DVD, maybe shipping & handling and the seconds it takes to burn it. This helps in several key points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Helps users with very slow connection, limited bandwidth or no connection at all get the CD/DVD. This are the 3 types of users that actually benefit more from this.\n\n*Helps raise funds for multiple causes\n\n*The buyer gets a cool printed CD with the Ubuntu version, Ubuntu logo and a neat Ubuntu cover.\n\n*The buyer also gets several stickers that look great on the PC/Laptop.\n\n\nFor the 12.04 for example you would get a box cover like this:\n\nAnd the CD Cover like this:\n\nIn the case of Ubuntu, they charge 5$ for a pack of 5CDs + S&H.

I mean do you know how many versions of Ubuntu there are and types of flavors. It almost looks like a music collection if you look at it from the side.\n\nA: There is no difference.  Both are the same.  But if you like to have the official CD, for keepsake, you can do so.  Plus if you have a slow connection, or planning bulk deployment, getting the CD would be an idea.\n\nThe price is $5 for a pack of 5, so you can pass it on.

So now I have /media/50B8245BB82441B8/TOR/tor-browser_en-US\nIn this directory, there is a file start-tor-browser. The problem is that, when I double click this file, it opens in text format, instead of launching TOR Vidalia.\nSo I right-clicked this file > Permissions > checked Allow executing file as program, but again it automatically unchecks it. \nI then thought of executing this file through the terminal, but nothing seems to work. \ncd /media/50B8245BB82441B8/TOR/tor-browser_en-US    \njerry@ubuntu:/media/50B8245BB82441B8/TOR/tor-browser_en-US$    \njerry@ubuntu:/media/50B8245BB82441B8/TOR/tor-browser_en-US$ start-tor-browser    \nstart-tor-browser: command not found    \njerry@ubuntu:/media/50B8245BB82441B8/TOR/tor-browser_en-US$ cd start-tor-browser    \nbash: cd: start-tor-browser: Not a directory    \njerry@ubuntu:/media/50B8245BB82441B8/TOR/tor-browser_en-US$ sudo start-tor-browser    \n[sudo] password for jerry:     \nsudo: start-tor-browser: command not found    \njerry@ubuntu:/media/50B8245BB82441B8/TOR/tor-browser_en-US$ gksu start-tor-browser    \njerry@ubuntu:/media/50B8245BB82441B8/TOR/tor-browser_en-US$\n\nAs you can see, when I use gksu, nothing really happens except an empty command line added with a blinking cursor.\nCan someone please help?\n\nA: It seems that the device you have extracted it on does not support permissions (is not a native Linux filesystem). Re-extract the tar.gz but do it in your home directory (home directory should support permissions). \n\nDO NOT JUST COPY THE FILES FROM WHERE YOU EXTRACTED THEM! IT WILL NOT WORK!\n\nA: I had the same issue.  No matter what I did the start-tor-browser file would always open as text.  \nHere's the fix (in Ubuntu Desktop 13.04):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open directory \"tor-browser_en-US\" in file manager window, navigate to the top menu bar of your screen and click on \"Files\".  \n\n*Click on \"Preferences\", select the \"behavior\" tab, and change setting to \"Run executable text files when they are opened\".  \n\n\nThe default setting is to \"View executable text files when they are opened\" and that is why it opens as text file.\n\nA: All you have to do is double click the start-tor-browser file and click run when prompted and it will start. It obviously needs to be executable.Maybe root owns directory change ownership sudo chown -R <username>:<groupname> path/to/tor-directory Make executable cd path/to/tor-directory chmod +x start-tor-browser double click on start-tor-browser click run and it should start up.\n\nA: It's harder, because, in Ubuntu 12.04, it seems that unity does not allow the execution of the start-tor script. I've found a solution modifying what was suggested here:\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/85715850/How-to-Install-and-Configure-Tor-on-Ubuntu-11\nThese are the steps:\ndownload tor, browse bundle and extract wherever you want, let say in your home direcory that is: /mypc/myhome/\nThen open gedit and write in a new file this code:\n#!/bin/sh\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Vidalia-TorClient\nComment=Browse the internet Anonymously\nExec=/mypc/myhome/tor-browser_en-US/start-tor-browser %U\nIcon=/mypc/myhome/tor-browser_en-US/Data/Vidalia/icon.png\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=Application;WebBrowser\n\nsave the file with the name Vidalia.desktop\nin a terminal input \ngksudo nautilus\n\nso you have a file browser with the privilege of administrator, now copy the Vidalia.desktop file in \n/mypc/myhome/.local/share/applications/\n\nClose nautilus and now in your Unity application window you will have an icon with the name Vidalia, click on it and you will have you TorBrowser\n\nA: In my case my partition was mounted with noexec option set on the drive.\nCheck this by running mount.  \nmount\n/more/drive/info with /stuff/that/doesn't apply here....\n/dev/sdb5 on /home type ext3 (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev) \n\nYours might differ a bit but you are looking for your device.\nif you see the \"noexec\" option on your partition like this one then this solution applies to you too.  \nRemount your drive (if you are not root use sudo):\nsudo mount -o remount,exec -t ext3 /dev/sdb5 /home\n\nReplace the specific details like so:\n sudo mount -o remount,exec -t [your_drive_format] [/dev/partition#] [/mount/point]\n\nTry again to launch tor... \nisme@CloudAtlas:~/Software/tor-browser_en-US# ./start-tor-browser.desktop \nLaunching './Browser/start-tor-browser --detach'...\n\nWORKS!\nOk, so it works... what now?!?\nYou will have to change your /etc/fstab file to remount with exec option set.\nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nYou will see some entry relating to the partition you want to set the option on. You will see a list that may include default,rw,user,noexec,nosuid,...etc... a full list of options can be found @ https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab/\nJust add the exec option to your fstab options for that partition (if noexec is there then remove it) and you should be good to go.\n\nA: What I did was just open up the terminal and drag the file start-tor-browser into it and it started up from there.\n\nA: Navigate to the top menu bar of your screen and click on Files.\nClick on Preferences &rightarrow; select the behavior tab &rightarrow;  change setting to \"Run executable text files when they are opened\"\nThe default setting is to \"View executable text files when they are opened\" and that is why it opens as text file.\n\nA: I had the same problem and it was the executable permission. (specially that you said it gets unchecked.) use the following command to add the executable permission:\nchmod +x start-tor-browser\n./start-tor-browser\n\nAlso if that didn't work change the directory to somewhere in your ~ directory. (i.e. your user's home directory)\nI hope this helps since it fixed my problem. In addition I suggest adding it to your bin folder so you can execute it easier:\nln -s {location of start-tor-browser file} /usr/bin/tor\n\nThen you can run it by just typing the following in your terminal \n    tor\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Option to activate Help text Is there any help text option in Ubuntu?

You must run them separately.\nSo, after cding to the Downloads folder, just run this command as before:\ndpkg-deb -D --build tpfan admin_0.96-ubuntu1_all\n\nIt appears that the only problem was that you were in the wrong place when you ran it. Or, more accurately, that you specified a relative path (see this article), which was wrong relative to the current working directory. By changing the current working directory, the relative path tpfan should be correct, assuming tpfan exists in your Downloads folder.\nEdit: Whatever directory contains the tpfan directory, that's where you should be (i.e., where you should cd to) when you run your dpkg-deb command.\n", "Q: Why is there a reserved spot in the Launcher?

I've had this happen before, you've probably got an additional program drug into your launch menu but Unity hasn't caught up to displaying it. After restarting the icon of whatever program you've placed there should become visible (or the space will disappear.)\nEDIT: Also, there are some programs which do not play nice with Unity and create extra icons in it's launch bar.

I haven't executed any command since then so can I some how revert my previous command? Someone, please help!\n\nA: Unfortunately, and in general, this is not reversible. Files are moved to trash only when you are deleting them using the graphical user interface. The purpose of the command line is to be powerful, but with great power comes great responsibility :-)\nEDIT: as one of the commentators rightly noted, it is advisable to boot the liveCD and use extundelete from there. That way, the actual system is not touched.\nBefore you read the rest of this answer, please read this article.\nHowever, there is an undelete utility (not guaranteed to work, however) that you can try.\nFirst, check that you have an ext3 or ext4 file system (run this command from a terminal):\nmount\n\nYou should see several lines, among them something like that:\n/dev/sda6 on /home type ext4 (rw)\n\n(if your home is on a separate partition) or\n/dev/sda1 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro)\n\n(if your home is on the root partition). If you have any doubts, post the whole output of the mount command here.\nNext, install extundelete, either using Ubuntu software center of from the command line:\nsudo apt-get install extundelete\n\nThe bad news is, from here on it gets more complicated. Additionally, you will be working from command line as root, having the power of completely destroying your system, so please take care of what you type.\nFirst, you should not run extundelete on a mounted partition, and you need to know on which device your home sits. If your home is on separate partition (say, /dev/sda6, as you see in the above example), boot your Ubuntu in safe mode. Press shift during the boot process, and when a menu comes up, select recovery mode and then \"drop to root command prompt\".\nThen, you need to remount the root filesystem writeable:\nmount -o rw,remount /\n\nThen, run\nextundelete /dev/sda6 --restore-all\n\nThe files that can still be saved will be restored, and extundelete will show you where it did store them.\nUnfortunately, from my experience, extundelete runs as often as it doesn't. Often you get \"segmentation fault\". In which case, you will have to download the source and build it yourself, which should fix the problem.\nFor the future, please remember the old saying: there are two kinds of people; those who do proper backups and those who will.

Recently I tried to setup a daily anacron job so that I won't have to manually update the files. I have never used cron or anacron before but reading through cron documentation I decided to put my script in /etc/cron.daily. Below is my script named dot-files (changed to executable with chmod +x):\n#!/bin/sh\n\ncd /home/dell/dot-files && /usr/bin/git add . && /usr/bin/git commit -a -m 'daily update' && /usr/bin/git push -u origin master\n\nHowever it doesn't seem to be running for the last two days.

Also am I using a wrong setup for the purpose?\np.s. I'm using an ubuntu 12.04 system and it's not always running.\n\nA: OK, first things first. You don't see what went wrong because cron could not mail you the output. Instead, however, of configuring your sendmail, modify your script such that it stores the output of your commands:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nexport workdir=/home/dell\nexport logfile=$workdir/dot-files.log\nexport errfile=$workdir/dot-files.err\ndate >> $logfile\ndate >> $errfile\n\n{ cd $workdir/dot-files && /usr/bin/git add . && /usr/bin/git commit -a -m 'daily update' && /usr/bin/git push -u origin master ; } >> $logfile 2>> $errfile\n\nFurthermore, you do not need to put it into the cron directly as root, you can run crontab as user.\nman crontab\n\nP.S.

Pendrive is of course plugged in and boot order is set to:\n\n\n*\n\n*DVD \n\n*Pendrive \n\n*Network \n\n*HDD\n\n\nAny suggestions?\nPS: Pendrive: A-data S102 32GB USB3.0\n\nA: I am running ubuntu usb edition right now, and it works fine. But I partitioned entire flash drive in one partition and also made a small partition for linux swap. I also installed bootloader on the pendrive, and not the hard disk, and it works. I prefer to press F12 to access the boot screen at start-up, and then select Boot from USB Flash. I could change BIOS settings to place usb boot first but I like it this way better. You may have to press a different key to enter boot screen at startup but it's the same.\nDon't forget this one - leave no Fat32 or NTFS free space on the pendrive, I mean you have to partition entire usb flash disk for linux as you find it fit (i find it convenient to make a large single partition ext3 or ext4), and also make a max. 1-2 gb partition for Swap, and then boot the live DVD, and install your system. You may have to format partition again during ubuntu installation, and maybe make some other changes, but on the whole it should work just fine in the end.\nAlso, don't forget to use the correct iso image for your machine, 32-bit or 64-bit, pae or non-pae and so on.\nWhen asked where you want to place bootloader, choose the usb stick, do not choose the hard disk, I mean place bootloader on the same usb stick where you installed ubuntu.\nGood luck with this one, Grzegorz!\n\nA: Only a suggestion, you can use a a live usb instead. this is done with a tool of your choice from here and then just use the windows boot manager instead of GRUB. The tool will repartition it by the size of the persistent file you make essentially, so if u want 16 GB for general use and 16 GB for Linux, just set the persistent to 15360MB(15GB for you need 1GB for Linux system files). then in boot manager just hold down whatever button you used to boot of the disc and slect your drive whenever you want to use linux. let me know if that answered your question. \n\nA: Looks like you are trying to create a bootable usb disk (from which you can boot your machine into live ubuntu session). There is a comprehensive guide available for the same here. \nFor this you need a working ubuntu system and ISO image of ubuntu version you want to create bootable disk. \nSteps are pretty easy: \n\n\n*\n\n*Insert a USB stick with at least 2GB of free space.\n\n*Open application Startup Disk Creator.\n\n*choose the downloaded ISO file.\n\n*If the disk is not formatted already then choose format and then Select the USB stick in the bottom box and click 'Make Startup Disk'. \n\n\nThat's it! When the process completes, you'll be ready to restart your computer and boot with your Pen Drive in your preferred ubuntu version. \n\nA: Pen drives and CDs require some files to tell the motherboard that they are bootable, and more files to load the minimal OS necessary to load up the iso file to load Ubuntu, or for that matter command line utilities. \nThe above using startup disk creator is the easiest way. To boot from the pen drive after installing Ubuntu to it, you must set the BIOS to boot from the Pendrive. Older machines may not have this option.\n\nA: watch out, this may the case why your USB device is not bootable.  \nMaybe try repartitioning the USB stick?\nDid you partition it yourself or left the MBR as it was before install?  \nIn my honest opinion installing livecd on the USB with the startup creator, then burning down the partitions and install \n\nA: The pointer may not be correct.  When you boot up your computer normally and you insert your pendrive and install ubuntu there.  The pendrive may be assigned sda1.  However, when you boot with your pendrive (installed with ubuntu), it may not be sda1 anymore.  So you need to change it to 0 instead of 1!  If it is the case, you need to find out the txt file and change the word!\n", "Q: Terminal stops every time a yes/no question appears I have encountered a problem when using the terminal to install programs. Whenever a yes/no option like the one below appears, not just with this program, but with any I try, the terminal stops after I have selected yes and will do nothing. I have even left it on for 3 hours just in case it was going slow, but to no avail. \nSo my question is, what do I do to fix this or get around it?\n\n\nA: The problem seems to be due to the use of gksudo. It looks like it doesn't redirect the stdin to the launched process.\nAs explained in the manual page of gksudo : \n\nTheir primary purpose is to run graphical commands that need root\n  without the need to run an X terminal emulator and using su directly.\n\nIt is not really intended to launch interactive console commands, sudo is designed for this kind of job.\n", "Q: Cannot change icon for a filetype I am trying to change the icon for .py file.  \nI referred:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/78645/78407\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/56725/78407\nand\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/AddingMimeTypes\nStill no success in changing the icon of python scripts.

I've manually replaced a few low resolution icons in the application menus. However, when switching between programs, some of the icons are still of low quality. Here's a screenshot. Emacs, Terminal and Chrome are fine, MATLAB apps are not, even though the MATLAB launcher is fine.\n\nI'm not sure if this is related to the same problem in Unity. Also, I'm not sure if it's specific to those applications. If there's a way of fixing the icons manually (as I've been doing for the launchers), I'd accept that as an answer.\nI've been trawling the Internet to try to resolve this but I really haven't come up with anything. Help appreciated and apologies if it's not Ubuntu-specific and thus off-topic.\n\nA: As evident from the screenshot, the icons for Google Chrome, Terminal and Emacs are fine. \nThis means that the resolution of icons used in other applications is low. Hence when they are scaled to a bigger size, the quality degrades.\nThere is no problem in Compiz or any other package.\nYou can either manually replace the icons with higher resolution/scalable icons or use an icon theme.\nOnly for example: You can try Faenza Icon Theme. Instructions given on: http://www.liberiangeek.net/2011/11/install-and-enable-faenza-icon-theme-in-ubuntu-11-10-oneiric-ocelot/.\n\nA: The solution described in this post is explaining why you could get blurred (or pixelated) icons when doing alt-tab switching, and present a solution on how to solve it.\n", "Q: grep bash alias I try to write grep alias exclude log files\nalias gr='grep -R --exclude=\\*.{log,0,1,2,js} \"$1\" *'\nalias gr='grep -R --exclude=\\*.{log,0,1,2,js} $1 *'\n\nDoesn't work correct \nI need to make something like gr \"sometext\"\n\nA: You cannot use arguments ($1) in an alias.

When I boot a computer from a Ubuntu disc and choose an option to try ubuntu. How exactly live session runs? Is it a full running instance of ubuntu os or some sort of visual interface on top of windows? \nIn short, what is the difference between ubuntu which was booted from cd or usb disk and fully installed version of ubuntu os? \n\nA: You are running in fact Ubuntu.\nThere are few differences, most importantly, whenever you need to start a program, the liveCD needs to run it from the CD, which is slower. Also, you cannot save anything permanently (unless you specifically attach ie. mount your hard disk). \nFinally, an installed system will be better tuned to your hardware, faster, and more up-to-date (packages on the LiveCD may be obsolete). \nOne caveat are proprietary drivers, notably Nvidia drivers. Nvidia drivers (which have 3D support) cannot be installed automatically by the Ubuntu installer, so if you have Nvidia, after the installation instead of the eye-candy of a 3D desktop you will have a much less eye-catching 2D desktop. However, Ubuntu will then tell you that you should install the Nvidia drivers from the Nvidia site, and you will be able to do so with a single mouse click, after which you will have your nice desktop back.\nOtherwise it's pretty much the same stuff.\n", "Q: 'vnstat' works, 'vnstat -l' doesn't I have just installed vnstat.

Usage\nSearch and open 'Youtube to MP3' via dash or another launcher. Copy the Youtube video URL from the browser to your clipboard and paste it into the application by clicking the 'Paste link' button on the top-left corner. See screenshot below.\nThe download and conversion will begin automatically and the audio saved in the Home folder under /Music/Downloaded by MediaHuman\n\n\nA: Downloading from youTube\nInstall youtube-dl from the official repository in Ubuntu:\nsudo apt-get install youtube-dl\n\nor as official readme suggest using curl or wget.

What you should see is a flv file with the same name as the 'v' component of the youtube url you downloaded.\nE.g if you downloaded http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z-hEyVQDRA then you should have a file called _z-hEyVQDRA.flv\nNext you need to copy that file name and then put it in an ffmpg command like\nffmpeg -i <file name>.flv -acodec libmp3lame <song name>.mp3\n\nSo for this example you would type\nffmpeg -i _z-hEyVQDRA.flv -acodec libmp3lame MasterOfPuppets.mp3\n\nOnce this has successfully completed you will now have the mp3 file you were after.\nNote\n\n*\n\n*For cleanup you may want to type rm _z-hEyVQDRA.flv to get rid of the flv file that you no longer need.\n\n*Information from here\n\nA: You can also download the mp3 directly from youtube without converting using ffmpeg\nyoutube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 <video URL>\n\nFrom the online help:\n-x, --extract-audio        convert video files to audio-only files (requires\n                           ffmpeg or avconv and ffprobe or avprobe)\n\nBear in mind as well that youtube-dl defaults to using avconv so you should consider specifying either avconv or FFmpeg at the commandline .

You can pass it an URL for a single song or even an entire playlist.\nyoutube-dl --prefer-ffmpeg --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 --audio-quality 0 --embed-thumbnail <VIDEO_SONG_OR_PLAYLIST_URL>\n\nBreaking down the meaning of the supplied options:\n\n*\n\n*--prefer-ffmpeg — Tells youtube-dl to prefer ffmpeg (as opposed to avconv).\n\n*--extract-audio — Extract the audio stream and discard the video.\n\n*--audio-format mp3 — Save the audio stream in mp3 format.\n\n*--audio-quality 0 — Save audio with highest quality possible. The possible values here are 0-9 (you can also pass explicit bitrate such as 128K). If you do not pass this option, youtube-dl uses a default value of 5, often resulting in lower quality audio than you will get with a value of 0.\n\n*--embed-thumbnail — (Optionally) Embed the video thumbnail into the saved audio files as album art metadata (will be shown in media player applications).\n\n\nA: 16.04 and later\nI recommend using the youtube-dl snap package (sudo snap install youtube-dl) to download the mp3 components of YouTube videos, so that you don't get blocked from downloading from YouTube because your version of youtube-dl is not up-to-date.\nShow a list of the available formats for a specific YouTube URL which I have denoted by <video URL> in the following line of code.\nsnap run youtube-dl -F <video URL>\n\nDownload the mp3 from a specific URL.\nsnap run youtube-dl -f your-choice-of-format --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 <video URL>\n\nwhere your-choice-of-format is replaced by an  format integer number that is selected from the audio only results of youtube-dl -F <URL>. The audio only results of youtube-dl -F <URL> will show a choice of available bitrates (e.g. 192k) for you to choose from, but the video only results of youtube-dl -F <URL> cannot be saved by youtube-dl to any audio format.\n\nA: This question has been answered a lot, but I figured I would add something really useful.  This should honestly just be included aliases when you install the youtube-dl package in my opinion.\nI add these to my .bashrc.  If I want to download a video as an mp3 I can do that, or download an entire playlist as mp3 I can use mp3p then the url to the playlist.\nIt is really simple and also respects YouTube's flood or bot protection by having a 30 second interval between downloads.

The editor will make sure that the syntax is correct (otherwise one could break the system).

This new sudo process will switch back to your original user (-u $USER, otherwise you would run the /some/program as root) and starts /some/program.\n\nA: try this:\nsudo -k nice -n -20 su -c \"dosemu\" $USER\n\nwhile it is running, run this:\nps -A --forest -o pid,user,command |grep dosemu\n\nyou will see that nice was run with root privileges, but dosemu was run as normal $USER.\nUnderstandind how safe it is: to make it sure that there is no flaw, try this where you will see it asks the password 2 times because sudo ls is run as normal $USER, so a script with sudo on it wont work unseen:\nsudo -k nice -n -5 su -c \"sudo ls\" $USER\n\nand this will ask password one time only as it is already root to sudo ls:\nsudo -k nice -n -5 su -c \"sudo ls\" root\n\nPS.: instead of dosemu, for tests, I used sleep 120, and sudo -k is for increased safety.\n\nA: Try: sudo -s -H\nIt logs you in as root after which you won't need the sudo.\nThen run your script.\n", "Q: Very very slow transfer speeds between Windows 7 and samba server running on Ubuntu 11.10/12.04 minimal As mentioned in the title I tried transferring files between Windows 7 and the samba server running on both Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04 but both showed very slow transfer speeds.\nCan someone please guide me in the right direction to debug this problem ?\nwget  --output-document=/dev/null http://tokyo1.linode.com/100MB-tokyo.bin\n--2012-08-21 22:02:17--  http://tokyo1.linode.com/100MB-tokyo.bin\nResolving tokyo1.linode.com (tokyo1.linode.com)... 106.187.33.12\nConnecting to tokyo1.linode.com (tokyo1.linode.com)|106.187.33.12|:80... connected.\nHTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK\nLength: 104857600 (100M) [application/octet-stream]\nSaving to: `/dev/null'\n\n 8% [=============>                                                                                                                                                       ] 8,923,980   64.8K/s  eta 15m 0s\n\n\nwlan0     IEEE 802.11abgn  ESSID:\"TNET\"\n          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.462 GHz  Access Point: 58:6D:8F:26:20:7A\n          Bit Rate=117 Mb/s   Tx-Power=20 dBm\n          Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n          Power Management:off\n          Link Quality=57/70  Signal level=-53 dBm\n          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0\n          Tx excessive retries:101  Invalid misc:2448   Missed beacon:0\n\n\n03:00.0 Network controller: Atheros Communications Inc.

However, running a live Ubuntu system from a flash drive or CD costs you next to nothing. If your graphics, wireless, ethernet and power management work with a live system, then they will also work with a normal installation. Moreover, the older the system is, the less trouble you should expect.\n\nA: I have. It took a little doing. The problem is with the drivers for the video card. The following steps worked for me (note my machine has an nvidia geforce gt 620):\nfirst standard install cd did not work so use the alternate cd (http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/). After install normal start up breaks just before log in screen. Instead  boot into recovery mode and select \"drop to root shell prompt\" and type \"restart.\" Now log in screen is displayed.

I evens has Office 2010, and all the tools I need (except Visual Studio)\nI used Kubuntu daily and the only major issue is the video card driver (AMD Radeon HD 7570). One times / 10 after reboot, the VGA crapped at the login screen, and I have to reboot again (blindly via command line) to get back to normal\nHere is my experiences on installation of Ubuntu on this machine\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1cHYU8KpTle3LMJuadls9hcvQf8l-5D1LQZX2NLM-XOo\nYou might lost 1 week of frustrating to get Ubuntu the way you want, and working on a stranger OS might not as productive as your familial OS. For me, I love to test, and as a .NET developer for my daily work, I tried to get out of Windows OS at home, and taste other techno \n", "Q: Pen drive lifetime issues when running OS from it I intend to install Ubuntu onto a 32GB pendrive. I've heard that the lifetime of a pendrive will reduce drastically due to the large number of read/writes due to running /tmp from pendrive. Does this issue really affect modern pendrives and how to use the RAM  as tmpfs instead of having /tmp in the pendrive?\n\nA: I hope that this helps you in making your decision.\n\nDue to the additional write cycles that occur on a full-blown\n  installation, the life of the flash drive may be slightly reduced.\n  Like any solid state drive, USB thumb drives have limited rewritable\n  cells. Granted, these are quite long, but if you are using the drive\n  as RAM, this can run out relatively quickly.  \nThis doesn't apply to systems particularly designed for live systems\n  which keep all changes in RAM until the user logs off. A Live SD in a\n  USB flash card reader adapter is an effective way to avoid any duty\n  cycles on the flash medium from writes and circumvent this problem.\n  The SD card as a WORM device has an essentially unlimited life. An OS\n  such as Linux can then run from the live USB/SD card and use\n  conventional media for writing, such as magnetic disks, to preserve\n  system changes.\nSome disadvantages:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Limited Protection – Persistent Data is left unencrypted in most    cases. Lose your drive, someone could steal and use your data.\n  \n*Persistent data is uncompressed – Although the Live OS can be    compressed, the persistent data is left uncompressed making it very\n  easy to run out of storage space quickly.\n  \n*Some changes are not saved persistently – In some cases, further    modification is required to enable things like graphical card\n  settings and network card settings to be saved. In some cases, system \n  wide updates do not work.\n\nSources: Pendrivelinux.com and ehow.com\n\nA: There are few things to consider.\n\n\n*\n\n*tmpfs mounted in ram = ramdisk. fully covered here\n\n*Disable swap (not needed, or use another fast pendrive for swap)\n\n*Boot flag noatime (to reduce disk writes from ram to disk) link\n\n*Boot flag toram (Load all once and stop further disk reading)\n\n\nIf you let enough free space after install needed things, in theory it will suvive untill you have no more free blocks to redirect badblocks. When you run out of space and a new block gets corrputed dataloss starts to happen. If you reserve 10gb of free space it will be used to redirect inodes to working blocks. Using Class 10 sdcard much better than using Class 6, from several thousands to millions disk writes. There's one online article -which i do not remember link- with a tool and a test over real pendrives being fried to check their real limits. You could stop using for Linux when you start to loss cells, inode redirecting messages will come often when usb starts to die. At this moment you could clone the USB to a new one and use this current USB for dummy, transport files, save movies... and why not, format it again excluding badblocks from scratch (look at)\nIf you have ENOUGH ram, you could try to boot to ram (boot flag toram) the full operating system (both for livecd or fully installed), this will improve the usb speed once loaded, but will take a little more load. Running speed matters more than wait +5-10 seconds to boot.\nUsing LiveCD\nusing LiveCD + Persistence is a good idea if you like it. Persisten can be encrypted, and contain temporal data that will be added to the current running system, like modules, software or config files.\nHere you can see a compreensive tut click click to create your own live from your preferred Distro with Persistence, and with an extra to boot to ram option in Grub.\nThere's also Android App to serve img as usb drive, so you can boot your LiveImage storing and serving it from phone to computer. If you boot to ram you could just boot and remove the memory. Use any extra usb for your HOME\nMahts, theory, and brands appart, i do suggest you to just do it and learn from experience. Using sdcards makes you easier to \"get a value\" of it's quality by given Class number.\nInteresting note: eMMC and SSD splits block/inode usage seammessly, a basic sdcard / flashmemory will fry blocks till is over. I don't really see the difference, a badblock can be always be relocated, it is only write unable, but readable.\nFeel free to consider im am not hdd, sdcard and filesystem expert so i may be wrong in one or many assumptios. My frist try is always check for truth.\n", "Q: Synaptic Package Manager looking bad under Gnome Shell [Ubuntu 12.04] This is my first question and I really hope that is has not been answered anywhere, as I could not find it during the search I performed.\nI am working under Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Gnome Shell (Gnome 3).\nI have installed Synaptic Package Manager, which is working great, but the problem is that its looks are awful. It looks like there is a classic theme applied to the synaptic windows only, except for the window title bar. Unfortunately, I cannot post a screenshot yet.\nThe same issue exists on the Adobe Reader (9.5.1) too, where the popup menu texts are barely visible on high brightness.\nCould this happen due to the some missing gtk2 libraries? Any help appreciated.\n\nA: I can't comment on the Adobe aspect, but I've had a similar problem with Synaptic on Ubuntu 12.04 when I use a theme from ~/.themes rather than from /usr/share/themes. The reason seems to be that programs that need sudo won't follow the theme from ~/.themes.\nEdit: okay, here's a link to some advice I received on how to use a theme from ~/.themes and have programs running via sudo look good. Basically, it involves the use of symbolic links from the user's folder to root's folder:\nsudo ln -s ~/.themes /root/.themes\nsudo ln -s ~/.icons /root/.icons\n", "Q: How to resume interrupted installation in Synaptic Manager?

My phone screen has a resolution of 480*320.\nI've tried this command;\nffmpeg -i movie.mp4 -vf scale=480:ih*480/iw downsized.mp4\n\nAnd it changes the resolution of the video, but the file is not as small as I'd like it to be.\nWhat else can I do to get the file as small as possible? Perhaps change the audio quality and framerate to something lower (I'm guessing 1080p video has better audio quality than my phone's sound card supports anyway). I'd like to keep the sound at the best quality the phone supports and the human ear can still hear. I'd also like to convert the sound from surround to stereo. Is there perhaps a different file format that's smaller and supported by Android 2.3?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: It is about the bitrate itself. You can change it by using a transcoding software like WinFF, Transcoder (I can't find the link for now, not to be confused with Arista Transcoder), Mobile Media Converter and even with NLES Software like kdenlive/openshot. \nTranscoding will reduce the bitrate if you wish, thus the file size, but preserving the video scale/aspect ratio/size. Anyway, reducing the bitrate may harm quality if you exceed the limits.\nCheck this out in order to see previous answers to a transcoding question: https://askubuntu.com/a/25532/9598\nBTW: You can also change the video and audio bitrates separately if you wish in order to keep sound quality.\nOh!

But 'make all' still doesn't work.\nIs there anyone giving me some comments? I really appreciate your help.\nThank you !\n\nA: I found that you can avoid this error easily if you can afford not to build hslab\n./configure --disable-hslab\n\nWhich is (I think) the only part that actually relies on using X. \n\nA: The following will also enable this to compile properly by making sure the 64bit and 32bit libraries are available.\nsudo apt-get install libx11-dev:i386 libx11-dev\n\n\nA: Trying to install HTK 3.5.1 on a new platform running Ubuntu (technically, in Docker), I ran into the same issue as the OP. I hope this helps someone…\nOn Ubuntu 14.04.3, I was able to compile HTK using:\n./configure --without-x --disable-hslab\n\nI suspect this or nils' solution would carry the same results, but didn't bother to test.\nFYI, this did the trick on macOS, too.\nOn Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04, I did the same thing but also had to edit HLMTools/Makefile.in on L.77, where I replaced the eight whitespaces with a tab, because the compiler is more picky.\nOf course, if you do need HSLab that's not gonna help. You may want to try your luck with HTK's newer version, 3.5 (currently in beta.)\n\nWhile I'm at it:\nHad to edit HRec.c on L. 1650, replacing labid != splabid with labpr != splabid (kudos to this page and that page.)\n", "Q: Compiz crashed after a few tweaks, and now I cannot start it again! Recently, I was meddling with ccsm and the window kept refreshing with every plugin addition (which is normal i suppose). However, after i enabled SVG (I dont think this is relevant but i included it anyway) under image loading, suddenly it got hung! Unity crashed, as i couldn't see a top bar or a launcher! My window decorations were out too! I restarted the computer hoping it would fix anything, but it didn't work!\nRight now, all i can see on the screen in my mouse, the wallpaper and my desktop icons. Right click works for me, and i can drag icons around the desktop.

Pretty funny though!\nIt was quite simple actually, rather than trying to launch ccsm from the recovery console, i started nautilus (From Docky, which was working for me), and went to \"Computer/usr/bin\" (On Ubuntu 12.10). From there I could launch ccsm and found out that all plugins were disabled. I went ahead and added in unity and other plugins, and everything's back to normal!\nHope this helps everyone who has a similar problem!\nCiao!\nPranay\n", "Q: Unable to load dvb-usb-rtl2832u driver in Ubuntu 12.04 I am trying to setup a Compro U680F USB DVB-T adaptor in Ubuntu 12.04 (kernel\n3.2.0-29-generic).\nThe compro device ID is given (lsusb) as 185b:0680.

Debian 6 installed grub, probably a different version than Ubuntu. I am running update-grub from Ubuntu 10, 11 & 12 and it does not overwrite the Debian boot loader. The Debian grub has failed to correctly define the boot options for 10.04 Ubuntu distro, the other Ubuntu distros where correctly defined. I had to modify the boot options at the grub prompt, intead of single, I wrote recovery nomodeset and I could load 10.04 Ubuntu but not in the recovery mode.\n\nA: Use sudo grub-install /dev/sdX X is the drive letter ex:- a, b You can find it out by doing a sudo fdisk -l\nThen do a update-grub2\n\nA: Recent versions of Debian and Ubuntu both use grub2; both have a version number of 1.99. As indicated by Manula, the problem is probably that the boot loader needs reinstalling. What he doesn't point out is that this is because you probably have multiple versions of th /boot folder, unless you have this as a separate partition, and hence Ubuntu updates its copy of /boot/grub/grub.cfg and then Debian uses a different one, which has not been updated.\nYou might want to look into manually putting the entries you want into /etc/grub.d/40_custom on both systems, or, if possible, creating a common /boot partition. Debian and Ubuntu although you then would need to be careful if the kernel version numbers ever get to be the same! \n", "Q: How do I get Bumblebee working with a GTX 660M?

You can get a newer driver by adding the ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates PPA and upgrading your nvidia driver:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nEdit /etc/bumblebee/bumblebee.conf and change Driver= to Driver=nvidia. If the command modinfo nvidia-current says that no module can be found, then change KernelDriver=nvidia-current to KernelDriver=nvidia. After changing the configuration, either reboot or restart the Bumblebee daemon:\nsudo restart bumblebeed\n\nNote: not making the configuration changes so may cause optirun to show the below error message:\n[ERROR]Cannot access secondary GPU - error: Could not load GPU driver\n[ERROR]Aborting because fallback start is disabled.\"\n\nGood luck!\n\nA: Finally i fixed it.

I would like to write a bash script to decode a base64 string. For example I type decode QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ== and it prints Aladdin:open sesame and returns to the prompt.\nSo far I have tried a simple bash file containing python -m base64 -d $1 but this command expects a filename not a string. Is there another non-interactive command (not necessarily in a Python module) that I can run from the command line to achieve this, without having to install any extra packages? (Or if I do, something super-minimal.)\n\nA: Just use the base64 program from the coreutils package:\necho QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ== | base64 --decode\n\nOr, to include the newline character\necho `echo QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ== | base64 --decode`\n\noutput (includes newline):\nAladdin:open sesame\n\n\nA: Using perl\nperl -MMIME::Base64 -ne 'printf \"%s\\n\",decode_base64($_)' <<< \"QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==\"\n\nOr the same with python\npython -m base64 -d <<< \"QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==\"\n\n\nA: Here you go!\nAdd the following to the bottom of your ~/.bashrc file:\ndecode () {\n  echo \"$1\" | base64 -d ; echo\n}\n\nNow, open a new Terminal and run the command.\ndecode QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==\n\nThis will do exactly what you asked for in your question.\n\nA: Just to add another way to do it:\nemacs -Q --batch  -eval '(princ (base64-encode-string (read-string \": \")))'\n\n\nA: With your original dependencies it is possible to do this with a minor modification to your original script:\necho $1 | python -m base64 -d\n\nIf you don't pass a file name, that python module reads from the standard input. To pipe the first parameter into it you can use echo $1 |.\n\nA: I did comment base64 command line in http://wiki.opensslfoundation.com/index.php?title=Command_Line_Utilities. \nSo I issue a Warning when using openssl base64 decoding :\n openssl base64 -e <<< 'Welcome to openssl wiki'\n\n V2VsY29tZSB0byBvcGVuc3NsIHdpa2kK\n\n\n\nopenssl base64 -d <<< 'V2VsY29tZSB0byBvcGVuc3NsIHdpa2kK'\n\nWelcome to openssl wiki\n\nwarning base64 line length is limited to 64 characters by default in openssl :\n openssl base64 -e <<< 'Welcome to openssl wiki with a very long line\n that splits...'\n\n V2VsY29tZSB0byBvcGVuc3NsIHdpa2kgd2l0aCBhIHZlcnkgbG9uZyBsaW5lIHRo\n YXQgc3BsaXRzLi4uCg==\n\nopenssl base64 -d <<< 'V2VsY29tZSB0byBvcGVuc3NsIHdpa2kgd2l0aCBhIHZlcnkgbG9uZyBsaW5lIHRoYXQgc3BsaXRzLi4uCg=='\n\n=> NOTHING !\nto be able to decode a base64 line without line feed that exceed 64 characters use -A option :\nopenssl base64 -d -A <<<\n'V2VsY29tZSB0byBvcGVuc3NsIHdpa2kgd2l0aCBhIHZlcnkgbG9uZyBsaW5lIHRoYXQgc3BsaXRzLi4uCg=='\n\nWelcome to openssl wiki with a very long line that splits...\n\nThis is anyway better to actualy split base64 result in 64 characters lines since -A option is BUGGY ( limit with long files ).\n\nA: openssl can also encode and decode base64\n$ openssl enc -base64 <<< 'Hello, World!'\nSGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQo=\n$ openssl enc -base64 -d <<< SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQo=\nHello, World!\n\nEDIT: An example where the base64 encoded string ends up on multiple lines:\n$ openssl enc -base64 <<< 'And if the data is a bit longer, the base64 encoded data will span multiple lines.'\nQW5kIGlmIHRoZSBkYXRhIGlzIGEgYml0IGxvbmdlciwgdGhlIGJhc2U2NCBlbmNv\nZGVkIGRhdGEgd2lsbCBzcGFuIG11bHRpcGxlIGxpbmVzLgo=\n$ openssl enc -base64 -d << EOF\n> QW5kIGlmIHRoZSBkYXRhIGlzIGEgYml0IGxvbmdlciwgdGhlIGJhc2U2NCBlbmNv\n> ZGVkIGRhdGEgd2lsbCBzcGFuIG11bHRpcGxlIGxpbmVzLgo=\n> EOF\nAnd if the data is a bit longer, the base64 encoded data will span multiple lines.\n\n\nA: I had a few moments of hair-pulling on this one because the base64 Linux tool and also the openssl can decode, indeed. But I have this particular base64 encoded file that decodes to slightly wrong value. The few bytes do match, but then there is this presence of EF BF BD EF BF BD when I view in hexedit viewer. And then the next sequence of bytes match again when compared to the correctly decoded expected output. These weird sequence of bytes got inserted in the in-betweens, sometime as EF BF BD only.\nTo resolve the matter, I have to look how the Java sender encodes it and then I created a small java base64 decoder. And now I can decoded to the expected value.\nHere is the small snippet that does it: https://gist.github.com/typelogic/0567cdab6c15487c31496cb90006ff52\n", "Q: How Detect Intel Graphic Processor?

Example output for my hybrid graphics laptop (i5-460m and GT 425M):\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller [8086:0046] (rev 02)\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation GF108 [GeForce GT 425M] [10de:0df0] (rev a1)\n\nIf your machine has an integrated Intel video card, but it does not show up, consider looking in the BIOS settings. Vendors like Lenovo provide you an option to select between an Intel-only, Nvidia-only or hybrid Intel/Nvidia setup.

Invalid parameter.\"\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: If I understand correctly, you only want to share the folder between all the local users on a single machine, yes? In that case, you do not need to involve sharing, because that is for sharing over a local network. Everything you need to do is to modify the permissions of the folder such that anyone can read and write in that folder. For example, you can set\nchmod a+rwx folder\n\nanyone will be able to read, write and delete files within that folder. If you set\nchmod a+rwxt folder\n\nthen anyone will be able to read and write, but only the person who created a file or directory will be allowed to remove it.\nThe above command is for command line, but you can also set the permissions using the graphical user interface; right-click on a folder, select properties -> permissions.\n", "Q: How to install linux without affecting my original OS? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I set up a dual boot Windows  and Ubuntu? \n\nHow can I install ubuntu linux 12.04 without affecting my original windows 7 OS?

What I found was that making it use 5GHz is rock solid stable (I have an SSID that is 5GHz only).  If I let it use 2.4 GHz then it works for a short while before becoming unreliable, and then eventually stops working completely.\nAdded for RolandiXor: If you have an access point that has both 2.4 and 5Ghz and it lets you set separate SSIDs on each band then you can have an SSID that is present on the 5GHz band only, and set the computer to use that SSID which means it will be doing 5GHz only.\n", "Q: Tomcat heap space settings seems not applied I've a Tomcat 6 installation in Ubuntu 10.04 and wanting to increase Java Heap space, I went to /etc/default/tomcat6 and uncommented and changed the following line:\nJAVA_OPTS=\"-Djava.awt.headless=true -Xmx1024m\"\n\nHowever, when I went to the Tomcat Manager Status page, I read:\nJVM\nFree memory: 125.29 MB Total memory: 382.43 MB Max memory: 510.43 MB\n\nSo I went to check my /etc/init.d/tomcat6 script and added echo $TOMCAT_SH, just before start-stop-daemon --start, to check that the variable actually went through, and I got:\n# /etc/init.d/tomcat6 start\n* Starting Tomcat servlet engine tomcat6\n'set -a; JAVA_HOME=\"/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk\"; source \"/etc/default/tomcat6\"; CATALINA_HOME=\"/usr/share/tomcat6\"; CATALINA_BASE=\"/var/lib/tomcat6\"; JAVA_OPTS=\"-Djava.awt.headless=true -Xmx1024m -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true\"; CATALINA_PID=\"/var/run/tomcat6.pid\"; CATALINA_TMPDIR=\"/tmp/tomcat6-tmp\"; LANG=\"en_GB\"; JSSE_HOME=\"/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/\"; cd \"/var/lib/tomcat6\"; \"/usr/share/tomcat6/bin/catalina.sh\" start'\n...done.\n\nWhich looks OK, so I was wondering why Tomcat manager says I've only 510Mb of max memory.\nHow can I make sure that the memory setting has been applied?\n\nA: what we are using commonly is put the JAVA_OPTS and CATALINA_OPTS into the /etc/bash.bashrc file at the end. Then every user has access to the OPTS also the tomcat user.\nTo monitor if your changes are applied you could use the 'ps -AfH | grep tomcat' command, which will display all tomcat processes including their start params.\n\nA: I am setting Java Options in my .profile file (right under /home/yourUserName/) globally.\nAll Java Processes will start with this params as long as you start them as your current user (not sudo)\njust add\n## set Java Options for the JVM\nexport _JAVA_OPTIONS=\"-Xmx1024m -Xms512m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m\"\n\nto the end of the .profile file, \nAnother possibility: Put the export at the beginning of a tomcat start script. should work also.\ni.e.\n#!/bin/bash\n## set Java Options for the JVM\nexport _JAVA_OPTIONS=\"-Xmx1024m -Xms512m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m\"\n\n##start Tomcat\n/etc/init.d/tomcat6 start\n\n", "Q: Libre office (read only) issue I run ubuntu 10.04 with the latest version of LibreOffice (the one release the other day). When downloading a document - like something in excel in my firefox, and want to open it, it opens up in read-only mode.\nI have to save the document first on my computer, then open it up to get the normal document, to be able to edit it.\nI would like just to open up the download document, edit it and then store it. Not download it, store it, and then edit it, while then I have to shave it again.\nIs there only a setting wrong? \nAny help appreciated \n\nA: It looks as though Firefox saves the file to the /temp directory as readonly so that users cannot accidentally save a file opened from the browser into the temp directory, edit the file and later lose any edits. I do not see any setting within the the security sections of either Firefox or LibreOffice that would change this.\n\nA: Workaround: In your Firefox about:config, create a new preference called browser.helperApps.deleteTempFileOnExit (type: boolean) and set it to false.  You can create a new preference by right-clicking and selecting \"New\" from the context menu.\nThis configuration setting will make downloaded temporary files writeable again.  Unfortunately, it will also keep a copy of those temporary files lying around (it won't delete them when Firefox closes), but oh well, what can you do.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://ward.vandewege.net/blog/2009/02/ff3-sets-downloaded-files-as-readonly-when-using-the-open-with-feature/\n\n*http://www.openvpms.org/forum/recent-update-firefox-355-and-read-only-open-office-files\n\nA: In the first row of icons, the fifth button (looks like paper with a pencil on it), hover and it will say Edit File. It enables edit mode even from read-only files. Then you should be able to save as after making your modifications\n\nA: I have not tried this. Use at your own risk! Keep the quotes in this post do not copy!\nThis will point firefox to save temp files in an other directory, Maybe this could solve your problem if that directory is writeable by you.\n\n\n*\n\n*open \"about:config\" in firefox, click through the warning\n\n*Right-Click into the list and select \"New->String\"\n\n*Enter \"browser.cache.disk.parent_directory\" as the new Key\n\n*Enter some directory that exists and is read-/writeable for you and the firefox process e.g. /home/yourUserName/Temp \nGood Luck.\nFYI: This is part of a \"Move your logs and temp files to RAM\" article I found here: http://www.fewt.com/2010/07/move-your-logs-and-temp-files-to-ram.html\n\nA: There are many wrong answers on the Internet about this problem.

After I get the log in prompt, the screen goes black and never comes back.  But I know the system is running because I can ssh into the box and my websites that I built still run. \nI think the problem is related to the fact that a few days ago, I had serious problems with mysql and I couldn't install or uninstall mysql-server-5.5.  THe only way I could get around it was to run a purge on mysql*.  While that allowed me to then reinstall a clean copy of mysql... this is the first time I've rebooted since running that command. \nThe other behavior I noticed before rebooting was that the gui no longer knew about different apps like firefox.  So the way i had to launch was to find where the exe was stored and then add my own shortcut to the desktop.  \nI don't know ubuntu well at all - just a linux newbie.  But it seems like the o/s uses mysql for it's own information... and somehow by blowing away mysql*, I've managed to mess up the GUI part of ubuntu.\nThe exact command I ran was :  \n sudo apt-get purge mysql* \n\nI still have a log of what it removed... here's the list: \n Purging configuration files for libmuonprivate1 ...\n Removing apturl-kde ...\n Removing software-properties-kde ...\n Removing plasma-widget-facebook ...\n Removing plasma-scriptengine-python ...\n Removing apport-kde ...\n Removing userconfig ...\n Removing usb-creator-kde ...\n Removing printer-applet ...\n Removing language-selector-kde ...\n Removing kde-config-touchpad ...\n Purging configuration files for kde-config-touchpad ...\n Removing jockey-kde ...\n Purging configuration files for jockey-kde ...\n Removing python-kde4 ...\n Removing plasma-widgets-addons ...\n Removing plasma-dataengines-workspace ...\n Removing kmail ...\n Purging configuration files for kmail ...\n Removing libmessagelist4 ...\n Purging configuration files for libmessagelist4 ...\n Removing libksieveui4 ...\n Purging configuration files for libksieveui4 ...\n Removing kopete ...\n Purging configuration files for kopete ...\n Removing kopete-message-indicator ...\n Removing libkopete4 ...\n Purging configuration files for libkopete4 ...\n Removing korganizer ...\n Purging configuration files for korganizer ...\n Removing libeventviews4 ...\n Purging configuration files for libeventviews4 ...\n Removing kontact ...\n Purging configuration files for kontact ...\n Removing ktimetracker ...\n Removing knotes ...\n Purging configuration files for knotes ...\n Removing kdepim-kresources ...\n Purging configuration files for kdepim-kresources ...\n Removing kaddressbook ...\n Purging configuration files for kaddressbook ...\n Removing akregator ...\n Purging configuration files for akregator ...\n Removing kdepim-strigi-plugins ...\n Removing amarok ...\n Purging configuration files for amarok ...\n Removing mysql-client ...\n Removing mysql-client-5.5 ...\n Removing libdbd-mysql-perl ...\n Removing php5-mysql ...\n Purging configuration files for php5-mysql ...\n Removing libmessagecomposer4 ...\n Purging configuration files for libmessagecomposer4 ...\n\nAny suggestions on how I can get my screen back? \n\nA: The logs you posted shows that a lot of KDE applications are removed. I've tried finding some KDE-apps starting with \"mysql\" that could have been removed when you removed everything that started with \"mysql\" (by calling apt-cache search kde | grep ^mysql) but I couldn't find any.\nSo there were probably some bigger problems (maybe also causing your issues with mysql) and when you removed mysql apt fixed these errors by removing all problematic applications.\nAnyway, to reinstall your kde-desktop, try the following:\napt-get install kubuntu-desktop\n\n", "Q: Will Quickly applications work on Debian? I have created an Ubuntu applications using Quickly, but I am wondering if the .deb package  that Quickly has created will work on Debian. Do Quickly applications work only on Ubuntu?\n\nA: This is largely application specific.\nAn application created in quickly will work on any Linux distribution so long as its dependencies are met. Quickly is just a method of creating applications.\nIf your application uses a version of a library not supported in Debian, then it would be necessary for you to provide this library yourself, either packaged with the application (and referenced accordingly), or in a PPA (overwriting the local version, or alongside the local version).\nAlso, any application that makes use of Unity/Ubuntu specific features will likely work, but only if those features are not made hard requirements. If for example you use an app-indicator for your application, it will work on Debian and other distros by using the fallback.\nIf you use Unity progress bars or other forms of integration, you would need to ensure that you make them optional features, otherwise your application will encounter errors.\n", "Q: How to get lock screen option in Lubuntu? I am using Ubuntu 12.04 with many DE. Lubuntu is one of them. I don't have any option to lock screen in Lubuntu while I do in Unity and other DE. \nIs there any program / application that I can install in order to lock screen in Lubuntu?\n\nA: I just use the keybindings I've always used on ubuntu. Press: Ctrl + Alt + L\nShould work\n\nA: There is an article at the here at the LXDE forums. It gives instructions on creating a .desktop file to lock the screen, and adding it to the top panel.\n\nA: The lxlock program provides screen locking functionality in LXDE.\nIt is part of lxsession. The lxsession  package provides it.\nTry running lxlock from the Run dialog (Alt+F2 or LXDE Menu > Run) or the LXTerminal (Alt+F2).\nIf lxlock locks the screen, you can work around the problem  by running it that way or by creating a launcher for it on the menu, panel, or desktop.\nIf lxlock runs but does not lock the screen, that's probably a bug.\nIf lxlock is not present on your system, run this to install (or, if it's installed but damaged, to reinstall) the lxsession package:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get --reinstall install lxsession\n\nAfter installing that, lxlock should work, but if it runs and fails, try logging off and back on to see if that helps.\n\nA: Try installing lubuntu-default-settings package. Open a terminal and run this command:\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-default-settings\n\nThis should fix the problem.\n\nA: There are several ways of doing it. The easiest being:\nLXDE Menu - Other - Lock Screen (XScreensaver).\nHTH.\n\nA: open .config file and right click on lxde-rc.xml open with any editor \nand find desktop paste the below  script  on keyboard below \n<keybind key=\"W-L\">\n    <action name=\"Execute\">\n        <command>xscreensaver-command -lock</command>\n    </action>\n</keybind>  \n\nsave the file \nexit\nreboot the system \nit will be work properly.\n", "Q: How to add a program as a startup application from a terminal? I am using Ubuntu 12.04 and I know the GUI way to maintain the startup program list but now I want to find out the way to add/remove startup applications using a command line interface (CLI).\n\nA: In your home directory, there's a folder called .config/autostart. Anything placed in this folder will be run when you login. This could be accomplished through the command line by creating the .desktop file with the command nano ~/.config/autostart/blah.desktop. If you like to find out about the syntax of .desktop files, you can visit Freedesktop and Gnome.\n", "Q: Cannot connect to password protected wireless networks on a Samsung NC20 My problem is pretty much a duplicate of https://askubuntu.com/questions/112411/wireless-security-wpa-wpa2-passwords-not-accepted-wireless-security-none but there was no proper answer there and I couldn't find a way to comment on it, so here it goes again.\nI have a Samsung NC20. I was using Natty for a while and all was working fine with the wireless. After upgrading to Oneiric I couldn't connect to protected networks anymore. The networks are detected but when I try to connect, Network Manager just keeps trying until it times out, I guess. Unsecured networks work fine. I upgraded to Precise using an unsecured network but the problem remains.\nI tried looking up a solution to this problem on this website and other places but couldn't find anything that worked. I tried WICD instead of Network Manager as some people suggested: same problem.

Then you run Ubuntu via a USB Stick. I understand that it is possible to mount a TrueCrypt encrypted partition on Linux, but is there anything stopping you from doing this to a TrueCrypt encrypted Windows System Partition?\n\nA: The Truecrypt FAQ states:\nWill I be able to mount my TrueCrypt volume (container) on any computer?\nYes, TrueCrypt volumes are independent of the operating system. You will be able to mount your TrueCrypt volume on any computer on which you can run TrueCrypt (see also the question 'Can I use TrueCrypt on Windows if I do not have administrator privileges?').\nThere is nothing obviously special about a system partition compared to other truecrypt volume types. That said, I have not done this personally. Caveat emptor.\n", "Q: Operating System not Found after installing Ubuntu in a Sony Vaio I just bought a Sony Vaio SVS15115FLB that came with Windows 7, after enjoying the PC graphic power for a little, I decided it was time to install Ubuntu 12.04. \nFirst, I inserted a USB stick, reboot, press F11 but a message saying that no OS was found on the USB, so then I used a live CD. It booted fine and I installed Ubuntu, then when it was time to restart the PC, it didn't boot to GRUB but it went straight to Windows and it began an startup error and was looking for a solution, after it was done, it restarted and then it booted again to Windows and to the same start up error solution thing.\nI freaked out, so I booted again the Ubuntu live CD, and installed Ubuntu over everything, after it installed I rebooted and then a message appeared saying Operating system Not Found, and I have no idea why. So I Googled again and found this post on Boot Partition, I did everything exactly on that post, but it didn't work (by the way, this was the message):\nThe boot files of [Ubuntu 12.04 LTS] are far from the start of the disk. \nYour BIOS may not detect them. You may want to retry after creating a /boot partition (EXT4, >200MB, start of the disk). \nThis can be performed via tools such as gParted. \nThen select this partition via the [Separate /boot partition:] option of [Boot Repair].\n\nIt appeared the first time, then I did it all again and then it was gone. I rebooted and nothing, the same Operating System not found message appeared. So I decided to create a partition for Windows, hoping for something, but the message still appears. \nI really have no idea what to do, but there is something odd, if I insert the USB stick containing Ubuntu 11.10, the message that says that there is no OS in the PendDrive flashes for a fraction of a second and the boot straight to Ubuntu 12.04 without problems (and booted to Windows when I installed it, ignoring Ubuntu), right now I'm using it like that, but its pretty annoying.\nCan anyone advise me how to fix this? I'm no expert on this kind of things (boot, GRUB, recovery and stuff like that).\n\nA: You have confused an installation with the Pendrive (your usb stick).  Rather than going through technical details, I'll simply suggest that you eliminate the USB drive for now (unplug it) and work with a live CD only.  Your installation will then place grub on the correct drive (one of hour hard drives found during installation which is normally sda unless you've used a bio option to boot to a different from the first hard drive).\nA fresh install will then boot without having the USB plugged in.  If you've done work and have configurations or data you want to save on your current Ubuntu installation you can use a grub recovery procedure to boot to your preferred installation.\nFix grup boot:\n1) boot to the Ubuntu installation disk\n2) Run the \"Try Ubuntu\" option\n3) Bring up a terminal (Launch search \"terminal\")\n4) Run these commands (exactly):\n\n    a) sudo mount /dev/sdaX /mnt  # Make \"X\" the partition that has Ubuntu installed (i.e. /dev/sda2).\n    b) for i in /sys /proc /run /dev; do sudo mount --bind \"$i\" \"/mnt/$i\"; done\n    c) sudo chroot /mnt\n    d) update-grub\n    e) if no errors skip this \"e\" section\n        grub-install /dev/sdX (x is the hard drive that has linux installed (i.e. /dev/sda)\n        update-grub\n5) Reboot the system\n\n\nA: I think your problem is that you accidentally managed to install the boot loader into your pedrive. The boot loader makes the OS to load into the memory and run. So the OS won't boot if you haven't plugged in your USB. If you plug in the USB and boot into it, it will display a message as 'Operating system not found' since the USB contain no bootable OS. But since the boot loader is present, it boot up the previously installed OS.\n\nA: You only need a clean installation of windows 7 and make a partition for your ubuntu. For installing ubuntu you need to use wubi (wubi can determine if your computer is 32-bit or 64-bit capable) and then install it to the another partition.\n\nA: Open a terminal (from the live CD) and try these commands -\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nsudo update-grub\n", "Q: Completely disappeared Wireless Some days ago after partial upgrade and update my \"Ubuntu 12.04 64bit\" wireless disappeared. \nI googled and tried several solutions such as: \n1.BIOS Reset\n2.Re-installing all packages related to wireless via Synaptic.\n3.Re-installing bcmwl-kernel-source.\n4.Running this command via terminal sudo rfkill unblock all.\nBut none have any effect.

Note that the default is 0744, which allows full control for the owner, but only read access for everyone else.\ndirectory mask = 0755\n\nWhile \"create mask\" only works for files, \"directory mask\" applies the same logic to directories.  Of course the particular setting of 0755 (full control for owner, read+execute for group and others) is the default.\nAlthough dated, this link offers a more-detailed description of these options, as well as a breakdown of the meanings behind the numeric values (should you require that).\n\nA: Using create mask = 0755 and directory mask = 0755 will work only for the files within sub-directory. \nlet say, we have a shared director /share for all member in a group.

Please help this is getting out of hand\n\nA: The problem\nGrub, Ubuntu's bootloader, was installed on the internal drive, but requires files present on the external drive to start up properly. When the external drive is absent, neither Ubuntu or Windows boots.\nSolution, Part 1 - Repair the Windows Bootloader\nDownload Rescatux and burn the ISO to a CD. Reboot your computer from the CD, with the external drive not connected.\nSelect the winoption, and click OK.\nSelect the winmbroption, and click OK.\nSelect the runoption, and click OK.\nUse common sense to figure out which partition contains Windows, select it, and click OK.\nFinally, use common sense to figure out which hard drive contains Windows, select it, and click OK.\nIf asked about position, leave the default option selected, and click OK.\nReboot and test to make sure that Windows boots up correctly.\nSolution, Part 2 - Reinstall the Ubuntu Bootloader\nBoot from the Ubuntu Live CD with the external drive plugged in.\nRun the following commands from a Terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair\nboot-repair\n\nClick on the Advanced options button, then click on the Grub location tab, and select Windows as the OS to boot by default. Make sure to select the option to install Grub only on the external hard drive. This is very important.\nFinally, click on Apply.\nNow, reboot to make sure you can boot to Windows and to Ubuntu with the external drive plugged in.\n\nYou may want to set up your BIOS so that your external hard drive is before your internal one in the boot order. This will allow for seamless booting, without you having to configure anything upon reboots, whether you want to boot into Windows or Ubuntu.\nNote: If you set up your BIOS to boot from USB devices automatically, you need to be aware that this may be a security risk (or a hassle): it may try to boot from other attached USB devices that are not your external hard drive containing Ubuntu. Always think twice before making changes like this.\n\nFinally, once inside Ubuntu, you'll need to perform one last step, to prevent Ubuntu system updates from reinstalling Grub to your internal hard drive and replacing the Windows bootloader.\nOpen the Terminal application and run the following command:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc\n\nEnter your Ubuntu user's password, and then press Enter.\nPress Enter for the first two screens. The third one is the one we're interested in.\nPress Tab and then Enter, then navigate to your external hard drive using the arrow keys, and finally select using by hitting Space.\n\n\nNote: Hard drives look like /dev/sda in this list. Any entries with numbers, like /dev/sda1, represent partitions and should be ignored.\n\nFinally, confirm your selection by hitting Enter.\nYour computer should, as of now, behave correctly and your start-up problems should be history.\nExplanation of the solution\nBoot-Repair installed Grub to your external hard drive only.\nThis allows your computer to boot to Ubuntu when it's connected, yet without depending on it to boot Windows when the external drive isn't plugged in.\nWith this configuration, Windows will boot by default, whether the external hard drive is plugged in or not.\n\nGlossary\n\nBootloader: a piece of code that runs before any operating system is running.

There does not appear to be any X11.so in /usr/lib32, actually there are only 52 libraries in that directory. I'm under the impression you should manually install libraries, but I'm at a loss as to what I should check next.\nAny help appreciated.\n\nA: You need the header files, which are provided by -dev packages, and not in the library packages themselves. So, try installing libx11-dev. That should fix this particular build error, though you may get similar errors about other libraries (and then you can install their -dev packages.)\nEven though these packages provide header files rather than binaries, and in general header files account for all supported architectures through the use of preprocessor macros, nonetheless -dev packages in Ubuntu tend to be architecture-specific, and this is the case for libx11-dev (as can be seen here by expanding a release and finding the .deb packages listed for libx11-dev in that release). Since your Ubuntu system is 64-bit and you're compiling a 32-bit program which must link against the 32-bit version of the library, you'll probably need to install the 32-bit version of libx11-dev. If you're installing with apt-get or aptitude, you can specify that by indicating libx11-dev:i386 as the package to install (since multarch is supported and being used).\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/ is a good resource for finding the name of the -dev package corresponding to a library package. It's not always the library package's name immediately followed by -dev; sometimes version numbers present in the library package name, especially after a -, are absent in the name of the corresponding -dev package.\n", "Q: Missing nvidia-settings application To make a long story short, I seem to have lost my nvidia-settings application.

I've noticed that most of my commands/programs in the /bin directory are compiled. I wish to duplicate this non-readable code format myself. Can someone tell me why and/or how these programs get this way?\n[green stamp bonus]: Isn't there a bash command to print all of the \"human readable\" text from a file?\n\nA: The commands/programs in /bin are not non-readable, but they are, as you say, compiled. This means that they were originally written in C (or some other programming language) and have been compiled to machine code (binary) so the processor can execute the code. To do the same, simply write the program you need in C and run the gcc command to produce an executable file.\nTo print any human readable text in a files use strings < /bin/file,\n\nA: Introduction\nWhen a program is compiled from say C or C++ source code, a compiler such as gcc (see below) translates that code into the native binary language of the CPU, so that the program can be executed. Thus human readable material (source code) is turned into a non-human readable format (machine readable binary code). \nBinaries and the Filesystem \nIf you enter echo $PATH, you will see a locations of all the executables on the system, both compiled binaries and scripts:\n/home/mike/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games\n\nIn the filesystem hierarchy key system tools such as cat and getty  are present in /bin and /sbin respectively, and other tools such as dpkg and chroot are present in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin respectively. If you compile a program by downloading the source code, configuring the build, and the installing it, your program by default should go in /usr/local/bin and its other files in the /usr/local hierarchy.\nCompilers\nProbably one of the most well known tools used to compile binaries is gcc, which is known as the GNU Compiler Collection and earlier as the GNU C compiler; the version shipped with Ubuntu 12.04 is gcc 4.6.3. As it notes in the offical GNU manual,\nGCC is an integrated distribution of compilers for several major programming \nlanguages. These languages currently include C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, \nJava, Fortran, Ada, and Go.\n\nCompiling a binary\nThe three commands ./configure, make and sudo make install (or sudo checkinstall) are often used together in order to compile a program.\nRunning ./configure, amongst other things, checks the version of gcc installed and prepares the build environment. The makefile is one of the most important things generated from running ./configure as it directs the build when make is run. The GNU make manual details the process in great depth. In sum, the rules in the makefile determine the main goal (to create an executable) so that the source code .c files will be made into compiled files (.o files) in order to generate the target executable file.\nResources\nTwo great resources are these Ubuntu compilation guides here and here, which contain some great advice and information for those new to compiling. Other resources such as the GNU gcc manual and the make manual I have mentioned already. For more information on C and creating a simple little C program, see chapter 22 of Rute and chapter 24 of the Linux Command Line.\n\nA: To compile Bash programs into binaries ( I'm assuming you're asking about Bash because your  question is tagged bash) you should use the program Shc. You can download it from here. After you unpack the archive, compile and install shc with cd shc-3.8.9;make;sudo make install. Now, run shc -f filename, where filename is the path to the file you want to make into a non-readable code format. Shc will create two files: filename.x.c and filename.x. You can get rid of filename.x.c, filename is the non-readable file.\n\nA: One Option:\nIf you want to see what's in the compiled programs use a tool like objdump to dump out the object code, for example:\nobjdump -d /bin/ls | less\n\n\nA: There are 10 different kinds of people. Guess you belong to the second group... :P\nThere are only binaries in the bin directory (Binaries = Programms in Binary Code, just 1 and 0)\nThey are compiled to be machine readable. Machines know 1 and 0 or on and off, true or false, nothing else.\nThis is done by a compiler. There are more than one compiler. I can think of the Gnucc compiler, or the Java-Compiler, or a Delphi-Compiler... Different compilers for different programming languages.\nTry grep. Good Luck!\n", "Q: Unable to install updates I am trying to install the regular updates on my Ubuntu 12.04 but for some reason I keep getting this error. Any Idea how I can resolve it?\n\n\nA: It looks like you are missing the key for the qgis repo. Assuming you installed it using the repo found here, just add the key, like this:\ngpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 997D3880\ngpg --export --armor 997D3880 | sudo apt-key add -\n\nYou will then need to run update apt, and it should work.\nsudo apt-get update\n\n", "Q: can lubuntu look exactly like xp? I know the differences between linux and windows. I just want to have the visual of xp. Can this be done with 12.04, like it could be with the previous versions of (L)ubuntu?\n\nA: Yes, it's possible to do that. All you have to do is find a theme that resembles Windows XP, or customize your own.\nFor the window background (GTK theme) and the icons (Icon theme), you can search at gnome-look.org for Windows lookalikes, for instance.\nYou can change the logo for the menu and the panel background. Just right-click them and open their properties. Then use the image you like best for that.\nFor the window title, you would have to find or create an openbox theme that pleases you. See:\nlink1\nlink2\nlink3\nSource\n\nA: I suggest Cinnamon Desktop. It has very similar visual layout to Windows GUI. It is still slightly buggy. I like this option because you can install it over regular Ubuntu. Instead of installing a different variety.\n \nI recommend you also look into lubuntu because of it's wide user base and better support.\nWith my research you may have to create your own theme for any UI to get it to look like Windows xp as for layout.\n", "Q: Cant boot into windows after installing ubuntu I started to use Ubuntu in April. I thought it would give me the option whether to boot into Ubuntu or Windows at each start. But that didn't happen. But I was happy with Ubuntu and didn't have time so I didn't try to get dual boot working.\nNow my father has stepped up pressure on me to either have a dual boot working or remove Ubuntu.\n2 months back I tried repairing Windows (was suggested by a friend) by using the CD but still I didn't get the dual boot option.\nRecently, after searching the web I found out that a lot of people do use dual boot\nbut I still don't get what I should do even after searching a lot\nI have 2 hard drives, the primary has Ubuntu 12.04 LTS as well as Windows 7. In the secondary hard drive there is another Windows 7 installed.\nAll I want is to have the option to boot on of the OS in my primary hard disk only.\nI took help from the people Ubuntu servers in Xchat. They asked me for the following things:\n\n\n*\n\n*To open GParted and screen shot of it\n\n*grub.cfg in  /boot/grub\n\n*grub file in /etc/default/grub\n\n*Video of how my computer boots up\n\n\nI am writing the links for these (according to the numbers up)\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.4shared.com/photo/79wMbZvw/Screenshot_from_2012-08-21_174.html?refurl=d1url\n\n*http://paste.ubuntu.com/1159285/\n\n*http://paste.ubuntu.com/1159386/\n\n*http://youtu.be/-Jzr6_HAJEU [the thing written in the middle of the video (when the rectangle box appears)is - \"ATENCION\"(1st line) \"92K/58HZ\"(2nd line) \"FREQUENCIA FUERA DE MARGEN\"(3rd line)]  check this clear pic -\n\n\nhttp://www.4shared.com/photo/XnhOte2Q/21082012002.html?refurl=d1url\nThe helpful people out there came to the conclusion that my monitor is old and unsupported for dual boot.\nSomehow I couldn't digest that so please examine things out and help me out.\nPeople its even your responsibility to save a Ubuntu fan like me.\n\nA: The Monitor is saying \"Attention 92K/58HZ Frequency out of range.\" This means the monitor is not able to display the Grub menu as the Grub is sending it in a form that the monitor can't recognize. \nTry the following:\ngksu gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nUncomment (delete the # from the beginning) the following line.\n# GRUB_TERMINAL=console\n\nSave and exit gedit.\nUse the update-grub command:\nsudo update-grub\n\nReboot.\nIf at any of these setting changes the computer becomes unbootable, you will have to boot from Ubuntu Live CD (Try Ubuntu) and revert the changes in /etc/default/grub in your hard drive.\nExplanation:\nWhen you boot the computer first the BIOS loads. Then GRUB loads. At this stage no OS is loaded and the computer has limited graphics capability. By default GRUB assumes the monitor can handle some graphics without the help of CPU, as most modern monitors can. \nThis monitor is very old and cannot handle the default display resolution of the GRUB menu. So it was showing the error message while GRUB was trying to show the menu choices. Since you couldn't see the menu, you waited till GRUB timed out and loaded the default OS Ubuntu. By commenting out the line GRUB_TERMINAL=console we told GRUB to display the menu in old \"text-mode\" style that your monitor can display without any help from the CPU.\n\nA: Clearly, your grub.cfg doesn't contain an entry for Windows and it shouldn't be, because Windows is on another hard drive.\nYou need to manually edit your grub.cfg file.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo lshw -C disk and find out the Physical id of the hard disk which has Windows installed.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open grub.cfg in a text editor with root permissions (example, sudo gedit grub.cfg).\n\n*Add the following entry in the file:\nmenuentry \"Windows 7\" {\n    set root=(hdX,msdosY)\n    chainloader +1\n}\nHere, X is the physical id of the hard drive, and Y is the partition number where Windows is installed.\nRestart and test.\n", "Q: Wi-Fi problem on Acer Aspire One D257 running Ubuntu I finally installed 12.04 on my Acer Aspire One D257 today but the Wi-Fi keeps dropping. I turned it on, typed the password but the \"cannot connect\" message kept popping up. As I'm a novice of Ubuntu, can anyone help?\n\nA: I had this same problem and all I did was update the driver for my wifi. Go to system setting then additional drivers, it should search for the driver needed and you should install/update it. Then go to the wifi settings in the top right corner and set up your wifi details and password in the same as you would using windows. I hope this helps, I am new to Ubuntu too, so good luck luck! :)\n", "Q: Do I need to activate the firewall? I only use Ubuntu for a home desktop use? I am a novice at Ubuntu (12.04).  I have it on my netbook which I use mainly for surfing the net, learning python and remote desktop into my work computer.  \nDo I need to enable a Firewall type software?  If so, what would you suggest, and what are sensible default suggestions?\n\nA: In most desktop cases you don't need to have a firewall. When you use a router at home, it does already quite a job -- for example, it does network address translation (NAT) such that you only have a local IP -- not reachable from the Internet. \nAlso, Ubuntu does not open any ports out of the box, so that there is no real danger of anyone trying to hack into your SSH.\nFinally, all firewalls actually are different interfaces to the same thing -- the iptables of the Linux kernel.\nYou really need a firewall if your machine sits in a LAN, with an IP visible for the whole world and you need to open up some ports (for example, you run a server, be that a test web server installation or an SSH server). \nFurthermore, a firewall is very useful if you want to limit which addresses are allowed to use an open port on your machine (e.g. you only allow the IP of your lab workstation to connect to the SSH port of your home computer).\nOf course, you might want to learn iptables one day :-) However, in that case, learn the iptables and networking first, and then use one of the alternatives which make the life of a network admin easier.\n", "Q: How can I ensure I am running the current stock kernel? At some point, I installed a new kernel, for no particular purpose but to try.\nI am having some problems, and would like to ensure that they are not caused by the kernel I installed.\nHow can I generally find out whether I'm using the newest available official kernel? If I'm not, how can I then change (up- or downgrade) to the latest official version?\n(I'm using Ubuntu 12.04, running kernel 3.3.0-030300-generic)\n\nA: *\n\n*Use uname -r to find your running kernel version/variant\n\n*\n\n*For example, 12.04 stock 64-bit returns 3.2.0-29-generic\n\n\n*Note that stock/official kernels only have 2 or 3 digits after the \"points\", e.g. -29 here.\n\n*The mainline/custom kernels have six digits, so the 030300 you are running is NOT a stock kernel\n\n*You can update to the latest stock kernel by running sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install linux-image-generic or ...generic-pae, depending on what your uname -r output shows you\n\n*You can choose kernels at boot from the GRUB menu, just keep Shift pressed down\n\n\nA: I think, the current officially released kernel, for update, is 3.2.0-29, because I keep my machine updated and I've got no notifications for kernel updates.\nNote that it is not recommended to manually update the kernel. You should just keep your Ubuntu updated using Update Manager and that would take care of everything.\nIf you do want to try out the new kernels, download the kernel from the Ubuntu PPA.\n", "Q: Linux got IP from DHCP, but still can't connect to WPA2 WIFI Here I got a problem.\nI have a Wireless Router which is Buffalo WCR-HP-GN, and I setting a WIFI which use WPA2-PSK authentication and the passphrase encrypted by TKIP.

I am trying to install Ubuntu along side Windows.  When I use the WUBI installer, the installation of Ubuntu works as long as I do not boot into Windows; if I boot into Windows, when I go back into Ubuntu, I am given a variety of error messages which claim to have corrupt or missing kernel/root directory, etc.  I have been working with this problem for about a week, and have reinstalled Ubuntu MANY times.  So far, I have eliminated all of the following problems:  Corrupt WUBI installation (Downloaded multiple times, used on other systems), I have tried using a CD and a flash drive, both of which work on other computers.  I know that no program within Ubuntu is creating the problem.  I know that others have successfully installed Ubuntu on a computer with my operating system (Windows 7 SP1).\nThis is a much shortened version of the original question, which has been up for about 5 days, and included a more detailed description of the problem, but left everyone clueless as to the source of this problem.  When I spoke with the Dell service technician who came over today to replace my keyboard, he suggested that the driver for my HDD was so new that it was not compatible with the current version of Ubuntu.  His reasoning is as follows:\n1) During an install from a flash drive or CD, where I am supposed to get the option to wipe my system or create a dual boot, I get a window that asks me to select a hard drive partition, but none are listed.\n2) This model of computer was made public in June of this year, while Ubuntu was released in April\nAdopting this theory, it would seem to me that the WUBI install fails after booting into Windows because Ubuntu can no longer find the files that it needs to load.\nDoes this theory seem at all plausible to anyone?  I just want to install Ubuntu and have it stay on my computer.  I don't care how I put it there, I just need it to work, so I would TRULY appreciate any advice or suggestions anyone could give.\nThanks so much for your time and support!!!\n\nA: WUBI installs Ubuntu within a Windows partition, and it is quite apparent that Windows break your Ubuntu installation. In a regular installation, Ubuntu will get its own partition, and the chances of Windows breaking something are much smaller.\nFirst, download the ISO image of the Ubuntu CD and burn it on a CD. Then, you can use Windows to shrink the Windows partition, and finally tell Ubuntu to install itself in the remaining free space.\nIf you still want to install the WUBI variant, though, you will need to provide more details:\n\n\n*\n\n*what is the model of your laptop?\n\n*what are, exactly, the error messages?\n\n\nA: Well, I finally seem to have found the solution; through all of the comments and suggestions made here, as well as many other outside conversations, I narrowed down the source of the problem to be with the hard drive.  Eventually, I found a post that suggested that dmraid was keeping the installer from recognizing the operating system.  By removing this, I was able to install Ubuntu on my laptop, though Windows now boots significantly slower.\n", "Q: How to review the current state of open source vs. closed source graphics drivers? How to know whether it's worth it to replace open source drivers installed by default with proprietary ones. Are there any benchmarks? Major known issues summaries. I don't mean 'at the time of writing this post'.

The other two do not publish their source codes and only provides closed source binary blobs. I read somewhere in http://www.phoronix.com that Intel open source drivers are better than the closed source ones by AMD and Nvidia. Other than that, as @Goddard mentions, closed source drivers are better than the open source ones.

It came pre-installed with Windows 7, but I wanted at least one Linux distribution installed as well.  So, I tried installing Ubuntu through the LiveCD.\nIn the LiveCD, I first created a few partitions for Ubuntu.  The first was a 12GB swap and the next, about 88GB formatted ext4 (gparted wouldn't let me create an extended partition, so both of there were primary partitions).  The extra space came from shrinking the Windows 7 partition.\nWhile installing Ubuntu, I selected the master RAID controller for the boot loader.  After the installer was finished, everything booted fine, but GRUB didn't have an entry for the Windows 7 loader (even though it had one for the Windows 7 Recovery loader).\nTo fix this, I tried manually editing the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file by adding these lines to the 30_os-prober section:\nmenuentry \"Windows 7 (loader) (on /dev/mapper/isw_bhcibcaafd_Volume0p5)\" --class windows --class os {\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod ntfs\n    set root='(hd2,msdos3)'\n    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 6A92977992974889\n    drivemap -s (hd0) ${root}\n    chainloader +1\n}\n\nAfter rebooting, GRUB didn't load and all I got was a blinking cursor in the top left of the screen.

Since grub2 (around 2009) this file is automatically overwritten in several events (kernel updates, for example).\nIf you want grub to scan your hard drives and look for OSes, try this:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis will re-generate your grub.cfg with all entries the probe finds. If you want to customize how this is done, try editing this file: /etc/defaults/grub. This is the one config file meant to be edited by user/admin.\nYou may also enable or disable the executable bit in the files at /etc/grub.d.

You could also go for a swap file instead of a swap partition.\n\nA: This is information on how to maximize performance of your SSD.

For few videos, I need to increase the sound to make it audible.\nIs there a way to keep sound to a fixed level, irrespective of video or audio quality (or bit-rate)? \n\nA: There is a way to normalise volume with several audio and video players; i.e. whatever is playing will have the same volume level and will not distort. I have used the feature in smplayer and vlc before, although I usually usesmplayer these days.\nSee the vlc screenshot where you can set the normalisation level in the effects tab to whatever is appropriate and then that will apply to everything played.\nI have also used the option before in smplayer (see screenshot 2) and found that it works well, although it will give you an overall higher fixed sound level, but one that will NOT distort and present unwanted frequencies for your speakers. It is particularly useful for DVDs which tend to have a lower volume level when you are not passing them through a preamp and large speakers. \nThere are other sound settings in smplayer that you might be able to use to tweak the sound if this setting is not to your taste. You can also alter the overall volume, tweak the levels and perform quite a lot of useful fine tuning.\n\n\n", "Q: How to get rid of i386 libs? Yesterday, I tried to install the Ubuntu 64bit package for Netviewer. This package seems to be a big mess as it is not really a 64bit version of the app, but instead uses Wine to get it to run. Along with the install, it installed thousands :-) of i386 libs.\nHow do I get rid of them? More precisely, can I somehow see which libs were installed yesterday?\n\nA: You can see what each run of apt installed by looking at apt's log file, located at /var/log/apt/history.log. You can remove them by uninstalling whatever package caused them to be pulled in. You cannot remove them while keeping that package because these libs are needed to run it.\n", "Q: unable to see 12.04 upgrade listed in Update manager \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhy is “No new release found” when upgrading 10.04 to 12.04 LTS? \n\ni am not seeing 12.04 LTS available for update in Update Manager. i followed the update instructions, and set to lts release only. when on normal release, i see only 10.10. i wish to upgrade to 12.04 LTS.\nwhat am i missing?\nmy data is backed up, but i have at least 2 yrs of programs installed and i would not like to lose all those programs and configs for various services and such. otherwise i would do a clean install.\nsuggestions? or more specific instructions please.\nthanks. pete\n\nA: Make sure that you have a  Backup of everything you absolutely can't afford to lose.\nThen just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

I have a script that I run every time I boot up my laptop (to reset the screen brightness).  I would like to be able to execute this command using a Launcher:\necho 1500 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\nUnfortunately, in order to execute this command (to edit the file) I need to be SU and type in my username and password. I know that UNIX shell scripts are designed such that you can't enter interactive variables like this, but I was hoping the Launcher would have more functionality.\nIs it possible to enter interactive arguments like superusername and password in the Launcher? If so, how?\n\nA: You can do this using gksu. Specifically make the launcher run the command:\ngksu \"bash -c 'echo 1500 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness'\"\n\nThis will make the script prompt you for your password and then change the brightness. \nAnother, better, solution that might or might not work depending on your hardware is to use the gnome-settings Daemon to change brightness. This will allow you to change brightness without needing to enter your password. \nThe command to do it this way is:\ngdbus call --session --dest org.gnome.SettingsDaemon --object-path /org/gnome/SettingsDaemon/Power --method org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Power.Screen.SetPercentage 100\n\nYou can replace the 100 at the end with any percentage brightness from 0-100. \nAs I said this might not work in all cases and should only be used when you are logged in.\nIn order to get these to be runnable from the launcher you will need to make what is called a desktop file. To do this you should make a new file called ~/.local/share/applications/fullbright.desktop and copy paste the following into it.\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Full Brightness\nGenericName=Brightness\nComment=Set Full Brightness\nExec=gdbus call --session --dest org.gnome.SettingsDaemon --object-path /org/gnome/SettingsDaemon/Power --method org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Power.Screen.SetPercentage 100\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nIcon=checkbox\nCategories=Utility;\n\nIf the gdbus command does not work on your system replace it with the gksu one.\nYou should now be able to call this command from the launcher with the name Full Brightness and pin it to your dock like any other program.\n", "Q: What does it mean \"Processing Triggers for...\" after installing/Uninstalling?

Without those triggers, you would have to logout/login or reboot for some changes to show up.\nThe reason they are there is to give other tools a chance to update - for instance, the list of applications in the unity dash would need to update to not show newly removed items.  There are other triggers for man pages (documentation), grub bootloader (new kernel versions), and many others.\n\nA: No, you don't have to do anything because it is normal.

The netbook has a few USB 2.0 ports and a 10/100 Ethernet port.\nI plugged the adapter in, loaded the modules for it, opened up putty, configured the baud rate, flow control, told it to use /dev/ttyUSB0, etc... pressed connect, and .......... nothing.\nI found a thing saying to use \"sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0\" but that didn't do squat.\nI even tried a total shot in the dark by plugging the rollover cable directly into my RJ-45 port and sending the putty connection through eth0 (though I was posative that wasn't going to work, and it didnt).\nAny ideas to get my Linux book connected to the cisco routers?\n\nA: I have used several different laptops and serial adapters to connect to Cisco devices.  I typically use minicom to connect -- you might try that.   It is available from the software center, or you can use sudo apt-get install minicom.  (If you do use minicom, use Ctrl-A and Z to access options -- check the speed and serial settings.  Everything else tends to be correct.) \nAnd /dev/ttyUSB0 is most likely correct if you're using a USB to Serial adapter.\nRollover to RJ-45 will not work, as you suspected.  \nIf things still do not work, look for a different serial adapter -- I've been through several that work fine in Linux, but I suppose it's possible you might have gotten one that needs drivers that are not easily loadable under Ubuntu/Linux.\nBorrow your friend's adapter if you can, and you can rule out your adapter that way.\n", "Q: Is it better to host a Minecraft server on Ubuntu Desktop, Or Ubuntu Server?

SYSTEM SPECS: Intel Core I3 Dual-Core 3.30 GHz, 8GB RAM, 1 TB HDD\n\nA: It depends. If you are planing on using the box that this is running on purely as a server and have the knowledge (or the determination) to manage it purely from ssh and the command line then it would be better to use Ubuntu Server, since, lacking the desktop, everything would run a little faster. Furthermore it is configured better for a server out of the box. \nIf you plan to use this server as a regular computer in addition to being a minecraft server, or you are not comfortable with managing it through a CLI. I would advise you to use Ubuntu desktop (or Ubuntu server with the ubuntu-desktop package installed). \nIn the end though they are both substantially the same and you could run a minecraft server with little trouble on either so choose whichever one you are more comfortable with.\n", "Q: How to increase swap space? I have, by default, 250MB of swap space in Ubuntu, and I want to expand it to a larger size. I need 800MB, which I think will be enough to open several applications without having to hit the current limit of swap. I hope someone can help me.\n\nA: GUI method for increasing the size of swap partition\nAnother way to increase the swap size is to use the GParted partition Editor. In short, you resize the swap partition, then right click on it and choose \"Swapon\".\nIt's easier to boot gparted-live-disk or an Ubuntu live disk (so that the all /dev/sda partitions will be unmounted). If you run Ubuntu live disk in some versions before 18.04, you may need to install gparted by running the commands below:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gparted && sudo gparted\n\nYou must be able to increase the size of swap partition only if there is an unallocated space present before or after the swap partition. If there was no unallocated space (the space which we are trying to add with swap partition) below or above the swap partition, then we have to resize the partitions and get that unallocated space.\nCase 1 - unallocated space present before or after the swap partition\n\nIn the above screenshot, I had 11.4 GB of unallocated space before the linux-swap and 12.8 GB after the swap partition.\n\n*\n\n*To resize, right click on the swap partition (/dev/sda9 here) and click on the Resize/Move option. It will look like this:\n\n\n\n*Dragging the slider arrows left or right then click on the Resize/Move button. Your swap partition will be resized.\n\nCase 2 - unallocated space is between the partitions\n\nIn the above screenshot, the unallocated space which we wants to add to the swap partition was between dev/sda7 and /dev/sda8.To move the unallocated space from that to just above swap partition,we have to follow the simple steps given below,\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on the /dev/sda8 partition and click on Resize/Move option.\n\n\n\n*click and move the slider to the extreme left,so that the unallocated space which was just above the /dev/sda8 partition will comes below /dev/sda8.After that click Resize/Move button.\n\n\n*And now the unallocated space was just above to the swap partition which was like Case 1.Now follow Case 1.\n\nCase 3 - if the unallocated space was present outside the Extended partition)\n\nI had an unallocated space of 18 GB just below to the extended partition.To add this space to the linux-swap partition(which was present inside the extended partition),we have to follow the below steps,\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on the extended partition and select Resize/Move option,it will be like the below screenshot\n\n\n\n*Click and drag the arrow to the extreme right and click on Resize/Move,so that the\nunallocated space of 18 GB will comes at the bottom of extended partition.I had a 14.80 GB of unallocated space already present at the bottom and now the 18.34 GB combines with that to create unallocated space of (18.34+14.80 GB) at the bottom of the extended partition.\n\n\n*Now there was an unallocated space just below to the swap partition,it will be like Case 1,then follow case 1.\nNOTE: Don't forget to take backup of all your important datas before proceeding the above operations.\n\nA: You can also use fallocate if you want to reserve space for your swapfile, without the need to fill the file with 0 through dd.\nFrom the man page:\nDESCRIPTION\n   fallocate is  used to preallocate blocks  to a file.\n\n   For filesystems  which support the  fallocate system\n   call, this is done  quickly by allocating blocks and\n   marking them  as uninitialized,  requiring no  IO to\n   the data blocks. This is much faster than creating a\n   file by filling it with zeros.\n\nIf you already have a swap defined, you can either remove it or keep it, and your *nix will manage it (even better with by defining a swapon priority). This could be usefull, in case you want to spread your swap between different devices, drive (based on their speed or other custom needs, see What is the purpose of multiple swap files on StackExchange).\nSimple fallocate usage for adding a second swap file\nCheck swap situation:\n$ sudo swapon -s\nFilename                Type        Size    Used    Priority\n/swapfile               file        262140  246276  -1\n\nCreate a 4G swap file\nStandard way of creating and activating a swap file:\nsize=\"4G\"\nfile_swap=/swapfile_$size.img\nsudo touch $file_swap\nsudo fallocate -l $size /$file_swap\nsudo mkswap /$file_swap\nsudo swapon -p 20 /$file_swap\n\nOne-liner:\n$ size=\"4G\" && file_swap=/swapfile_$size.img && sudo touch $file_swap && sudo fallocate -l $size /$file_swap && sudo mkswap /$file_swap && sudo swapon -p 20 /$file_swap\n\nMake your swap permanent\nAdd a line in your /etc/fstab file so that swap will be initialized on the next reboot (we also update here the priority of the newly created swap space and we update the priority of the old swap file).\nIn your /etc/fstab file, notice the priority of the prev swap is now 10.\n/swapfile    none    swap    sw,pri=10      0       0\n/swapfile_4G.img     none    swap    sw,pri=20      0       0\n\nCheck swap situation after reboot:\n$ sudo swapon  -s\nFilename       Type     Size        Used    Priority\n/swapfile      file     262140      0       10\n/swapfile_4G.img       file     4194300     0       20\n\nRemove one of the swap spaces (for example the original 256Mb)\nEdit /etc/fstab\nRemove the line related to the swap you want to remove.\nDelete that swap\nDelete and remove the swap file.\nsudo swapoff /mnt/swapfile && sudo rm /mnt/swapfile\n\nResources:\n\n\n*\n\n*The official Ubuntu swap FAQ page\n\nA: If you want to resize your swap partition and do not want to create a swap file, then\n\n*\n\n*Boot Ubuntu installation media live session by choosing Try Ubuntu\n\n\n*Open GParted or other partition manager if you use Kubuntu, Lubuntu, etc.\n\n\n*Disable swap:\n\n\n\n*Resize main partition (In my case I was doing it for /dev/sda2) by shrinking it\n\n\n*Resize swap partition making it bigger\n\n\n*Enable swap using the same context menu and Swapon button\n\n\n*Reboot into usual Ubuntu session\n\n\n*Open terminal and see if swap size changed:\n $ sudo swapon --show\n [sudo] password for user: \n NAME      TYPE      SIZE   USED PRIO\n /dev/sda3 partition   2G 129.3M   -2\n\nIt's not changed.

This is not the same in every aspect as swap partition, but it will be easy and dynamic.\nIn the following steps, change /media/fasthdd/swapfile.img to anything you like. For example, it can be /swap.img as well. /media/fasthdd/swapfile.img is just an example filename. If you are using this one, then of course there must be a directory /media/fasthdd/ with enough free space for your new swap file.\nUse any terminal application to run the commands of the following steps. All commands should be run with root privileges. To do this, you can either add sudo to the beginning of every command or run sudo bash before running the commands.\n\n*\n\n*Create an empty file:\nThis file will contain virtual memory contents so make file big enough for your needs. This one will create a 1GiB file, which means +1GiB swap space for your system:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/media/fasthdd/swapfile.img bs=1024 count=1M\n\nIf you want to make a 3GiB file, then change count value to count=3M. See man dd for more information.\n\n\n*Bake the swap file:\nThe following command is going to make a \"swap filesystem\" inside your fresh swap file.\nmkswap /media/fasthdd/swapfile.img\n\n\n\n*Bring up on boot:\nTo make sure that your new swap space is activated while booting up computer, you should add it to the filesystem configuration file /etc/fstab. Add it to the end of the file. This is recommended because other filesystems (at least one that contains a swap file) must be mounted in read-write mode before we can access any files.\n# Add this line to /etc/fstab\n/media/fasthdd/swapfile.img swap swap sw 0 0\n\n\n\n*Activate:\nYou can either reboot your computer or activate the new swap file by hand with the following command:\nswapon /media/fasthdd/swapfile.img\n\n\nIf everything goes well, you should see that more swap space is available for use. You can use the following commands to check your new swap and confirm that it is active:\n$ cat /proc/swaps\nFilename                           Type       Size    Used    Priority\n/media/fasthdd/swapfile.img        file       8388604 2724    -1\n\n$ grep 'Swap' /proc/meminfo\nSwapCached:         4772 kB\nSwapTotal:       8388604 kB\nSwapFree:        8355812 kB\n\n\nA: How to add a swap file\n\n*\n\n*Create .img file\n sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap.img bs=1M count=1000\n\nnote!: bs=1M count=1000 ==> 1GB\n(bs * count = size in megabytes )\nOther example:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap.img bs=10M count=100 \n\n\n\n*Format .img file\nsudo mkswap /swap.img\n\n\n\n*Enable swap file\nsudo swapon /swap.img\n\n\n\n*Add swap file to fstab\nAdd this line to your fstab (/etc/fstab):\n/swap.img   none            swap    sw              0       0\n\n\nA: Resize Swap to 8GB\n# Turn swap off\n# This moves stuff in swap to the main memory and might take several minutes\nsudo swapoff -a\n\n# Create an empty swapfile\n# Note that \"1G\" is basically just the unit and count is an integer.\n# Together, they define the size.

Checkout this short video tutorial: How to Increase Swap on Ubuntu Linux |  Linux Handbook\n\n(From this video) following is the way to increase the swap space (if your system is using swapfile):\nFirst check the swap size of your linux system:\nswapon --show\n\nSample output:\nNAME      TYPE   SIZE USED PRIO\n/swapfile file 797.2M   0B   -2\n\nThis output shows the swap size is being used and the type of swap. Here the swap type is \"file\" type (it could be partition type as well).Ubuntu uses swapfile by default and increasing and decreasing the size of it is fairly easy.\nAs we are going to modify the swapfile so at first turn it OFF. You might notice the process is being killed for multiple times. This happens because before turning the swap OFF the system moves its contents to main memory which may overflow the main memory.

Can anybody confirm that Ubuntu (either ISO install or WUBI) works reliably as a dual boot on a system running Windows 7 Service Pack 1.  I have another system running Win 7 (not SP1) that works great, but Windows seems to be corrupting the Ubuntu file system, and I would like to rule out the SP 1 as being the problem. Otherwise, I am considering reinstalling windows using a pre-SP1 install disk, since I know that a computer installed from this disk works well with Ubuntu.  See my other question for more info: Ubuntu install can't find hard drives Thanks guys!\n\nA: Read your other LONGGG question. All I can say from experience, note that I can only talk about my experience with Windows 7 + Ubuntu and it is not a lot, since I have only installed Ubuntu on little less than 20 PCs that had Windows 7 WITH Service Pack 1. The rest of the Windows 7 I have installed (Almost 50) had Windows 7 without SP.\nIn almost all cases, I installed Ubuntu with a flash drive and via the Live Ubuntu OS (NOT Wubi). In all of those cases, none gave me any errors whatsoever. Not even a kernel error, missing kernel or anything that could be related to an error. Even in some laptops that had Windows 7, the scroll section of the synaptic mouse pad worked in Ubuntu and not in Windows. That was about the only difference.\nIn the less than 10 cases where I installed Ubuntu via Wubi (Which I really do not recommend because of THIS and THIS) none of them gave me a critical error. The only problem was the actual boot time. When booting Ubuntu it took (Talking about 12.04 and 11.10 in this case) almost 20 seconds more than booting Ubuntu after installing via the LiveCD. Hey, and I am talking about all cases where Wubi was the installed method. It actually took longer to boot. Apart from that no other problems were found. Note that this had nothing to do with Windows 7 having the SP1 or not. It was just that NTFS and Ubuntu inside the Windows environment affects the real performance of Linux.\nYou can look at it this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing Ubuntu via the LiveCD/USB = You running on the park at 5 in the morning, clear road.\n\n*Installing Ubuntu via Wubi = You running inside a freezing lake in the park at 5 in the morning, clear lake except for the 3 sharks somebody dropped in there..aa oh yeah, and you are somehow bleeding. \nSo what I recommend is install it or test it via the LiveCD. There might be other causes that we do not know. Who knows, maybe Windows 7 has some kind of check up that if it reads a Linux installed it somehow sabotages the performance or something (Making stuff up here but it has happened before (bootloaders anyone?)).\n", "Q: Why does WiFi work with WICD but not Network Manager So my WiFi can connect with WICD, but not the default KDE network manager. I would like to know why. Do both these applications handle the connection differently? If so what would the difference be?\nMy hardware is a Broadcom 4313. I've tried the STA drivers and the open source drivers, and a few other options with Network Manager. None of which worked. In fact, everything was working fine for a while, just that one day, it didn't. I can't identify what i did to trigger this issue though. \nAnd to be more specific: Even with network manager, I could connect to open connections (the ones without a password), I can connect to WPA connections, just not to one particular WEP.\n\nA: You must remove network-manager to get wicd to work, or vise-versa.

I have Tomcat set up to launch at start up on my Ubuntu box.  Trouble is, I have to manually supply a root password on each boot.  Is it possible for this to be automated?  Do I just supply an command parm?  If so, what is the syntax?  Thank you!\n\nA: I'm unsure about how you have pulled this off, but it does sound like you have tomcat start up when you log in rather than when the machine boots. Am I right?\nAnyway, you should have it start when it boots. The following procedures should be done as root. When in use, init will do them as root.\nThe quick and dirty way:\nGiven that your start script is /usr/local/tomcat/bin/startup.sh the just add that line to the file /etc/rc.local and reboot.\nThe right way:\nMake an upstart script. I haven't really done that before, but I saw this: https://gist.github.com/2924017 which might work.\nPut the file (tomcat.conf) in /etc/init/ and reboot.\nAs a service, you can start, stop, restart and get status on services by doing:\nstart tomcat\nstop tomcat\nrestart tomcat\nstatus tomcat\n\nThis is of course how all services in Ubuntu behave. (gdm, apache, ssh, etc..)\nHope it helps :)\n\nA: One way to start the tomcat on the startup is to run it using cron using the @reboot attribute:\nopen up a terminal and type :\nsudo crontab -e\n\nat the end of the file enter the command:\n@reboot /`PATH_TO_WHERE_TOMCAT_INSTALLED`/bin/startup.sh\n\nsave the file and exit.\nThe above command will run the command once everytime computer boots up.\n", "Q: Upgraded to 12.04 and now the WiFi applet doesn't show wireless connections to connect to I upgraded Ubuntu to 12.04 and everything is fine expect I now have no option to connect to WiFi. \nUnder the WiFi applet in the upper top right where I would typically open the applet and see WiFi signals that the computer finds and that I can connect to, when I open the applet there are no Wifi signals listed to choose from. \nIt shows from top to bottom in white text: VPN Connections, Enable Networking and Edit Connections; it shows in dark text that I can't open: Wired Network, disconnected and Connection Information.  \nAny ideas what to do?

I have used ffmpeg (the git version), but you can use any program and just change the options:\nespeak -f myfile --stdout | ffmpeg -i - -ar 44100 -ac 2 -ab 192k -f mp3 final.mp3\n\nResult checked with file final.mp3:\nfinal.mp3: Audio file with ID3 version 2.4.0, contains: MPEG ADTS, layer III, v1, 192 kbps, 44.1 kHz, Stereo\n\n\nA: espeak now has a -w option which outputs to wav\n(It still would need to be converted to mp3 afterwards.) \nespeak -f foo.txt -w foo.wav\n\n\nA: The --stdout option to espeak will tell it to write the audio data to stdout instead of putting it through the audio device.

The amount of CPU consumed depends on the number of dirty pages to write, the speed of the output device and the speed and model of the CPU.  Potentially it could consume 100% if the scheduler allows it to. It's a job that needs doing, so it uses available CPU cycles.\nI generally only encrypt the data in my home directory that really needs encrypting (e.g. email, ssh keys etc) to limit the CPU consumption. I followed the instructions in the following wiki to just encrypt specific directories:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedPrivateDirectory\n\nA: I think you mean 'ecryptfs'. eCryptfs is a program for encrypting partitions and directories. Apparently encrypting your home folder takes quite some hit on your CPU performance. \nI found it in general more useful to encrypt certain folders rather than the whole /home. /home contains a lot of configuration files that are accessed all the time by various programs, and each access makes ecryptfs work.\nThat said, I still find the CPU usage you report quite high.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS boot problem - (won't startup after install) I installed 12.04 64-bit on my new PC.

What exactly is disabling in network manager (or with the hardware/keyboard switch) do?\n\nA: *\n\n*Disabling a wireless connection in Network Manager deactivates the wireless interface (similar to ifdown or ifconfig down), and then soft-blocks (turns off) the hardware device. It does not unload the wireless driver (kernel module).\n\n*The hardware/keyboard wireless switch will also soft-block (or hard-block, i.e. cut power) the internal wireless card.\n\n*You can customize -- to a limited degree -- what happens when Network Manager enables/disables an interface by editing scripts in /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d; see man NetworkManager for more info.\n\n\n*\n\n*BUT this cannot be used to load/unload the driver via modprobe, because once Network Manager unloads the driver, the interface ceases to exist and it won't be able to bring it back up! (notice when you modprobe -r that the Wireless options completely disappear from the drop-down menu)\n\n\n\nSo, the best option is to setup a custom keyboard shortcut to a script which unloads/loads the driver; you can add that script to the sudoers file such that no sudo is needed for it.

To do so permanently, you would need to blacklist it, but I don't remember how sorry. the wireless button/switch is meant to turn off your wifi by disabling the driver btw.\n", "Q: I have bought a new wireless card and I have the same problem , it connects then it isn't able to browse anything I can connect with wired connection in my living room but I can't with my wireless card.\nI'm pretty sure card is ok because I got a new one and driver works fine.\nI had Ubuntu 12.04 then I downgraded it to 11.10 and I have the same problem over and over again.\nI searched all over the forums and I can't find an answer.\n ifconfig\n   :eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 40:61:86:35:11:b0  \n      inet addr:192.168.2.6  Bcast:192.168.2.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n      inet6 addr: fe80::4261:86ff:fe35:11b0/64 Scope:Link\n      UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n      RX packets:4096 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n      TX packets:3930 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n      collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n      RX bytes:3959080 (3.9 MB)  TX bytes:591022 (591.0 KB)\n      Interrupt:43 Base address:0x6000 \n\n  lo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \n      inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\n      inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\n      UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1\n      RX packets:32 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n      TX packets:32 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n      collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n      RX bytes:2528 (2.5 KB)  TX bytes:2528 (2.5 KB)\n\nwlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr f8:d1:11:12:af:79  \n      inet addr:192.168.2.5  Bcast:192.168.2.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n      inet6 addr: fe80::fad1:11ff:fe12:af79/64 Scope:Link\n      UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n      RX packets:50 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n      TX packets:188 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n      collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:4872 (4.8 KB)  TX bytes:30698 (30.6 KB) \n\nnm-tool\nNetworkManager Tool\n\nState: connected (global)\n\n- Device: eth0  [Wired connection 1] -------------------------------------------\n  Type:              Wired\n  Driver:            r8169\n  State:             connected\n  Default:           yes\n  HW Address:        40:61:86:35:11:B0\n\n  Capabilities:\n    Carrier Detect:  yes\n    Speed:           100 Mb/s\n\n  Wired Properties\n    Carrier:         on\n\n  IPv4 Settings:\n    Address:         192.168.2.6\n    Prefix:          24 (255.255.255.0)\n    Gateway:         192.168.2.1\n\n    DNS:             192.168.2.1\n\n\n- Device: wlan0  [bitches] -----------------------------------------------------\n  Type:              802.11 WiFi\n  Driver:            ath9k_htc\n  State:             connected\n  Default:           no\n  HW Address:        F8:D1:11:12:AF:79\n\n  Capabilities:\n    Speed:           7 Mb/s\n\n  Wireless Properties\n    WEP Encryption:  yes\n   WPA Encryption:  yes\n    WPA2 Encryption: yes\n\n  Wireless Access Points (* = current AP)\n    *bitches:        Infra, CC:5D:4E:DD:33:D0, Freq 2417 MHz, Rate 54 Mb/s, Strength     100 WPA WPA2\n*hteronet:       Infra, CC:5D:4E:DD:33:D0, Freq 2462 MHz, Rate 54 Mb/s, Strength 59 WPA WPA2\n\nIPv4 Settings:\n    Address:         192.168.2.5\n    Prefix:          24 (255.255.255.0)\n    Gateway:         192.168.2.1\nDNS:             192.168.2.1\n\n\nA: Your DNS server isn't working properly.

I find it completely unintuitive that I can't access such important information simply via right-clicking on the program icon on the Unity launcher. Since that's not the solution, I'm completely clueless how to figure out which exact program is being launched by some icon in the Unity launcher. There must be a simple way, but how?\n\nA: Each Launcher icon has a shortcut or .desktop file associated with it, which defines its properties. These .desktop files are normally stored in /usr/share/applications/.\nWe can use the name tooltip shown when hovering over a Launcher icon to find its associated .desktop file and from that, the path to the program or script it is launching.\n\n\n*\n\n*Hover over the launcher icon in question to display its name:\n\n\n*Open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T, and type/paste the below; replace the APPNAME with the name shown in the previous step to get the path to the program that will be launched:\ngrep Exec $(grep -l \"APPNAME\" /usr/share/applications/*)\n\n\n*For example, using the System Settings example and running the below:\ngrep Exec $(grep -l \"System Settings\" /usr/share/applications/*)\n\nwe get:\nExec=gnome-control-center --overview\n\nwhich tells us that the name of the executable is gnome-control-center, and it's being launched with the option --overview.\n", "Q: Creating an Ubuntu live USB for use with Gparted I've install Ubuntu 12.04 on my Windows 7 Dell laptop. Recently I discovered that I'm running out of space on my Ubuntu partition, and I would like to enlarge it. \nIs it safe to resize partitions while they're in use e.g. when I'm logged into Ubuntu? If so, I've ran into this problem when I run GParted: It seems as if my hard drive is one big, NTFS partition, like the Ubuntu partition doesn't exist. \nIs it possible Ubuntu runs off the NTFS partition, sharing it with Windows? What should I do? \n\nA: I would suggest creating a liveusb/livecd to partition your harddrive. Acer recently sent my sister's computer with a 70 gig partition for her personal files to go into??? We had to boot into Ubuntu to add it to her windows partition becuase we only had 2 megs free. I don't think it would be very safe to partition the drive while you're using it though and be sure to backup all your personal data using Ubuntu and Microsoft's only data clouds (or another harddrive) as there's always that chance.\nAlso, did you install it using Wubi?\n", "Q: How to obtain .rej file from debuild?

I have searched around the net for a solution to my problem. I gave myself an account user name for facebook so I could use the chat in Pidgin 2.10.3. However, no matter what I do, Pidgin refuses to enable the account and it gives me the same message:\n\nusername@chat.facebook.com/Pidgin disabled\n  Not Authorized\n\nI used the tutorial on at this blog:\nhttp://poppleit.com/how-to-howto-use-facebook-facebookchat-facebook-chat-with-pidgin-instant-messenger-14-07-2012/#comments\n\nA: Facebook itself has a page to help set up several chat clients https://www.facebook.com/sitetour/chat.php (or Help search your chat client)\nWhile signed in to Facebook, choose your chat client and you will get a pop-up window telling you the exact settings to enter based on your Facebook login. (for example, username is not the same as what you use to sign into Facebook...)\nAnd just to restate the obvious, I got the \"not authorized\" after I did the above and realized I had missed a character entering my password...\n\nA: I was finally able to find the missing step in solving this:\nApps needs to be enabled on: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications&section=opt_out\nBe sure to go through all of this 'App' page and uncheck anything you don't need (i.e. everything).\nFor the record:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a '.' in my username.\n\n*Encrypt connection: Always.\n\n*Allow plaintext authentication: Over encrypted connection.\n\n*Resource: I have tested and it doesn't matter and does not need to match the name of the generated app specific password on the Facebook security page: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=security&section=per_app_passwords\nGood luck!\n\nA: The settings have changed recently.\nopen pidigin accounts and edit the facebook account to the following:\n\nProtocol: XMPP\nUsername: xyz (This might not be the username that you enter at facebook login page - But the one which you see on your timeline link - https://www.facebook.com/xyz)\nDomain: chat.facebook.com\nResource: Pidgin (this is what is missing most of the time)\nPassword: xyx\nLocal alias: xyz\n\nOn the advanced tab:\n\n\nConnect port: 5222\nConnect server: chat.facebook.com\n\n\n\nA: Since nobody else has posted this as an answer...\nAs of May 2015, facebook chat no longer uses XMPP so you can't just use that to connect in pidgin.\nInstead, try this plugin: https://github.com/jgeboski/purple-facebook/wiki\n\nA: I'm able to connect from Pidgin to my FB profile, but I couldn't for a friend!\nThe problem is that my friend has a very long password with a special characters which seems not apparently be accepted by Pidgin (he used the French character ç)\nSo I reduced password length and delete that strange character, and it works!\nIf you're obliged to use special characters try the common ones like _ or - or & etc.\nHave a nice day!\n\nA: When being behind a proxy (not sure if the same for each and every network/proxy config out there) it's worth to try changing \"connect port\" as well - from default 5222 to  443. This was something that I had to do in order to get it working at my workplace.\nSo the full config would be:\nBasic tab:\n Username: *xyz* (the one that leads to your profile with link like this: http://facebook.com/xyz)\n Domain: *chat.facebook.com*\n Resource: can be blank or *Pidgin* as suggested in facebook's docs\n Password: *your-facebook-password*\n\nAdvanced tab:\nConnection security: *Require enctryption*\nAllow plaintext auth over unencrypted streams: *unchecked*\nConnect port: *443*\nConnect server: *chat.facebook.com*\n\n\nA: Go to security settings on Facebook, create an application password.

This is the thing.\nI copied (using XP) my files to the directory that was setup to hold my files synced, but I can't see any file on the web interface of one.ubuntu.com.

As time goes by we tend to do apt-get install and add or replace software.\nAre these archived in some form or do they get auto-cleared after installation? And if it doesn't get auto-cleared, it would mean that a clean up is needed, isn't it?\nFinally, if they're not auto-removed, can we reuse these packages on different machines?\n\nA: The downloaded packages are stored in /var/cache/apt/archives \nIf you want to remove them, use sudo apt-get clean.\nFrom man apt-get:\n\nclean \nclean clears out the local repository of retrieved package\n  files. It removes everything but the lock file from\n  /var/cache/apt/archives/ and /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/. When\n  APT is used as a dselect(1) method, clean is run automatically. Those\n  who do not use dselect will likely want to run apt-get clean from time\n  to time to free up disk space.\nautoclean \nLike clean, autoclean clears out the local repository of\n  retrieved package files. The difference is that it only removes\n  package files that can no longer be downloaded, and are largely\n  useless. This allows a cache to be maintained over a long period\n  without it growing out of control. The configuration option\n  APT::Clean-Installed will prevent installed packages from being erased\n  if it is set to off.\n\n", "Q: compressing a list of files by using tar what I am trying to do is to compress a list of files using tar.\nSo what I am doing is\nsudo tar -pcf filename.tgz `cat filename.list`\n\nso if there is a directory on the list like this\n/home/vmuser/.gconf\n\ntar compresses everything in that folder. However what I want is to just add exactly whatever is on the list.\n\nA: If you want to tar all files listed in filename.list, you should use the tar -T filename.list command rather than tar 'cat filename.list'. \nFrom  the tar manpage:\n -T, --files-from FILE\n       get names to extract or create from FILE\n\nUsing -T will prevent you from getting the error:\n-bash: /bin/tar: Argument list too long\n\nif you try to compress a large number of files.\n\nIn order to prevent recursive compression of directories, use the --no-recursion flag, as suggested by @Ignacio Vazquez-Abrams. The final command becomes:\ntar -pcf filename.tgz -T filename.list --no-recursion\n\n\nA: From the tar(1) man page:\n   --no-recursion\n          avoid descending automatically in directories\n\n", "Q: How do I restore the default quicklists?

It only shows UbuntuOne, the rest of my home folder entries are missing. As I recall, It used to display Documents, Downloads, Music, etc..\nHow do I go about restoring these quicklists?? \nThank you all in advance for your replies.\n\nA: You probably have a custom launcher overriding the default one.\nIt would be ~/.local/share/applications/nautilus.

Extra points if you can provide me more info on this.\n\nA: Unfortunately, due to a bug in Qt, you cannot enable the global menu in some Qt applications such as VLC.

I am pretty sure there are many applications and packages i never use (like empathy, for example) and i would like to know which ones they are.\nIs there any way to know which applications or packages are used very seldom (or never) so i can get rid of them?\ntx.\n\nA: There are some good applications available which I feel will solve your problem: \nUbuntu Tweak\nAllows you to easily flush out the following: -\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloaded packages no longer needed (installed packages)\n\n*Sweep up the update cache (E.G. .debs of all the updates recently installed)\n\n*Old configuration files for applications since removed\n\n*Old kernels\n\n\nBleachBit\nUse BleachBit to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Free disk space\n\n*Reduce the size of backups and the time to create them by removing unnecessary files\n\n*Maintain privacy\n\n*Improve system performance (by vacuuming the Firefox database, for example)\n\n*Prepare whole disk images for compression (common for \"ghost\" backups and virtual machines) by wiping free disk space\n\n\nGTKOrphan\nIt analyses your system for orphaned libraries and then offers them up for removal, freeing up space.\nThere is one more tool available by default : Computer Janitor But I will advice to make sure what you are doing before using it. \n\nA: I would love to find out how to compile a list of seldom-used applications automatically myself, but I suspect it may be a bit tricky (the relation between a \"package\" and an \"application\" is not that straightforward, for one thing; some programs are used by other programs, a package can contain multiple executables or none at all; some applications may actually be started automatically each time you boot but never actually used by you, and so on).\nWhat I sometimes do on machines with little RAM/disk space (just did it yesterday on an original EeePC with a 4Gb SSD):\n\n\n*\n\n*install synaptic\n\n*in the left pane, select to show all installed applications\n\n*go through the list, marking the packages I don't need to be removed\n\n*after the apps are uninstalled, run sudo apt-get autoremove to uninstall any libraries installed as dependencies of the uninstalled applications.\n\n\nThe process is a bit time-consuming (maybe an hour or so) and is only justified if you're really tight on disk space (or just having fun). On the other hand, it allows to remove more than any automated process would - for example, I was never going to use bluetooth or printing on that machine so I removed bluez and cups packages, which otherwise are actually in use by the system. \nIt is possible to break your Ubuntu if you're not careful, but otherwise it's a great learning exercise.\n", "Q: Screen tearing while browsing the internet (chrome+firefox) in ubuntu 12.04 intel 4000 graphics First, some specs: Ubuntu 12.04 on an Asus UX31A Zenbook Prime, running kernel 3.5.0-10. As stated in the title, Intel 4000 graphics.\nWhile browsing the internet in both chrome and firefox, I get REALLY bad screen tearing. It seems to happen the worst on gmail, and when opening drop-down menu's. Also happens on youtube when you drop down the little description thing. It causes screen tearing and a lot of blank spaces that sometimes will reappear if you move the mouse over them. The strangest thing about it is that I don't get any tearing at all while streaming videos. Only while doing general browsing. Now that I am actually typing it out it sounds like it could be a javascript problem. Who knows? Hopefully one of you do.\n\nA: I'm using 12.04 with Intel HD 4000 graphics and a stock kernel (3.2.0-29-generic) and have not noticed these problems.  I also have another partition that is Xubuntu 12.04 and has a custom compiled 3.4.x family kernel, which also does not see this problem.\nThe 3.5.x and 3.6.x kernels are known to be introducing a number of more experimental and untested capabilities for the new Intel HD 4000 chipsets.  As such it would not surprise me if your problem is related to a bug in one of these introductions.\nI would suggest testing out a more stable kernel (3.2.x or 3.4.x family) and see if the problem disappears. If it does you can file a bug against the 3.5.0-10 kernel on launchpad (and potentially upstream as well).\n", "Q: How to reinstall apps? I am having trouble re-installing Create Launcher. I downloaded it two days ago but my Ubuntu was acting weird. Because I am new to Linux/Ubuntu, I un-installed it and re-installed it. I am trying to get Create Launcher back. I did the troubleshoot method of adding the deb line into the update manager under the other software tab but it comes up with an error. \nIf someone could give me a step by step way of reinstalling it, I would appreciate it.\n\nA: The problem that you are experiencing is that the source of software that you have manually added is not trusted by default, unless you specifically import a key from a trusted source (usually keyserver.ubuntu.com). That way, when you import software from an archive outside of ubuntu.com you can be sure that this software has not been spoofed.\nPlease open a terminal and paste the following line:\nsudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com E131728675254D99\n\nThis command will import the key from ubuntu.com and add it to your keyring.

You could try moving the configuration entry from fujitsu.conf to epjitsu.conf file in the same folder.\nI'm not sure what exactly are the differences between the S1300 and S1300i, so you may have to extract the *.nal firmware file from the Fujitsu Windows driver like it says in the header of both fujitsu.conf and epjitsu.conf files in /etc/sane.d/, if you haven't done that already.\nUpdate\nI just remembered when I built sane from source because I needed the new version for my scanner to function, I had to create a new udev rule for the scanner to be usable. \nCreated a new file in /etc/udev/rules.d called 40-libsane.rules and add the following line to the file:\nATTRS{idVendor}==\"AAAA\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"BBBB\", ENV{libsane_matched}=\"yes\"\n\nReplace the AAAA and BBBB with the IDs of your scanner.

Furthermore when I open firefox, it says there isn't a connection.

The availability of the package is determined by the sources used (/etc/apt/sources.list). It is the apt subsystem. Software center and synaptic are just graphical interfaces for that, only that they may to ignore some of the available sources.\nGo to software center, Edit-> Software sources and check which sources are enabled.\nAnd yes, there are differences in functionality, just not where you see them (for example, synaptic allows to easily pin a package version).

I have a computer acting as a sound server, managed by Pulseaudio. All computers on my LAN send sound to that machine.

The GF108 is, as I've learned, a sound controller on my Nvidia card, and the Built-in Audio is the motherboard's sound chip, and the Kenwood Audio Device is the one I want to use.\nHowever, when I click on the Profile: option, I get this pop-up menu of options:\n\nWhy does this one device have 15 different options, and what is the difference between them?\nI have, of course, tried different ones, and they all seem to work. Why would I select one over any other? \n\nAdditional note for some context: My motivation for looking into this is that currently my sound set up has two problems. One is that it can't play more than one sound at a time - any app that is playing a sound takes exclusive control, and starting a sound in a new app causes freezes or crashes. My sound setting used to be able to play multiple streams so I think this should be possible. The other problem is that volume settings are hard to control.\n\nA: These control the channel map pulseaudio uses for your device.\nPulseaudio has some standard names like \"left\", \"right\", \"center\", and so on for audio channels. Applications also output on channels like this. Pulseaudio then remixes the audio as needed, and tries to do the \"right thing\". For example, if an application is outputting a \"center\" channel, but your output device doesn't have one, it will mix it equally to the \"left\" and \"right\" channels.\nThe profile setting here determines how Pulseaudio maps its channel names to the underlying (usually ALSA) device channels. Usually which you select will depend on what kind of speakers you have and how they are connected. You can see the profiles also affect the input channel mapping, so many of these are just different combinations of input and output mappings.\nYou can see the channel maps in effect with commands like pactl show-sinks and pactl show-sources.\nYou can define more profiles in /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/profile-sets.\n", "Q: Asus Zenbook UX31E heats up and fan works constantly with 12.04 I bought the Asus Zenbook UX31E a few days ago and installed Ubuntu 12.04.

This is a known problem with the \"Sandy Bridge\" architecture of the CPU. Historically, this CPU runs hot resulting in the fan running constantly. There are few options for cooling the CPU. \n\nA: Sandy bridge aspm fix is already in the kernel so that shouldn't be an issue at all. Also it seems like 12% load on idle is a bit on higher side.

I don't know what genius thought of having configuration parameters in commented out lines, but that's how it works.\nOnce you've made the change, regenerate menu.lst by running:\nsudo update-grub-legacy-ec2\n\nAll the root entries in menu.lst should now be updated to point to (hd0,5) (or whatever you configured it to).\n\nA: One possibility that I have chosen is to tell grub to install at the master boot partition with \nsudo fdisk -l                # where you get the disk\nsudo grub-install /dev/hda   # in my computer it is /dev/sda\n\nand then you update everything with:\nupdate-grub2\n\nHope you succeed, you better wait for an expert answer.\n", "Q: Not enough space in /var/cache/apt/archives/ When I run the command to install the package solr-jetty, I am told \nYou don't have enough free space in /var/cache/apt/archives/\n\nHere's the result of the df -H command:\n\nI have installed Ubuntu with VirtualBox on my Mac.\nHow can I fix this problem?\n\nA: These commands will remove extra packages that are no longer required .\nOpen terminal (Ctrl-Alt-T) and type\nsudo apt-get autoclean\nsudo apt-get autoremove \n\n\nA: sudo apt-get autoclean\n\nThis will delete all packages not currently installed. If that doesn't free up enough space, then use sudo apt-get clean. This clears out all .debs downloaded and/or installed.\nBut it looks like your hard disk is out of space. Seriously out of space. 61Mb is not enough for a good working system. I found 2 alternatives that can circumvent space-related problems though both might be hard to pull off when using a virtual machine.\nA more permanent solution would be to increase the size of your virtual machine (and I would also advise using the method that allows the machine to dynamically increase in size; VirtualBox has such a setting).\n\n\nAlternative if you have a partition or external storage.\n\nWith this method you re-route the location where .debs are stored:\nsudo mv -i /var/cache/apt /media/{dir_of_mounted_disc}\nsudo ln -s /media/{dir_of_mounted_disc}/apt /var/cache/apt\n\nRun the upgrade and install. After you are done you can switch back to normal with:\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo unlink /var/cache/apt\nsudo mv /media/{dir_of_mounted_disc}/apt /var/cache\n\nOf course {dir_of_mounted_disc} needs to be changed to the name of your mounted disc.\n\nAnother alternative\n\nThis way you create a RAM disc:\nsudo mkdir /media/{directory}\nsudo mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /media/{directory}\nsudo ln -s /media/{directory}/apt /var/cache/apt\n\nClean up as with the 1st alternative.\nWarning this requires a large amount of RAM so may not be useable when using a virtual system.\n\nA: Whenever you install a program, the packages (.deb files) get stored in /var/cache/apt/archives, which obviously take up space (a lot of space if there are many packages installed).\nTo get rid of them, use:\nsudo apt-get clean\n\nIncase you're wondering what is the difference between clean and autoclean, here is what the man page says:\nclean:  clean clears out the local repository of retrieved package files. It removes everything but the lock file from /var/cache/apt/archives/ and /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/. APT is used as a dselect(1) method, clean is run Those who do not use dselect will likely want to run apt-get clean time to time to free up disk space.\nautoclean: Like clean, autoclean clears out the local repository of package files. The difference is that it only removes package files can no longer be downloaded, and are largely useless. This a cache to be maintained over a long period without it out of control. The configuration option Clean-Installed will prevent installed packages from erased if it is set to off.\n\nA: this error message showed up on a raspberry pi zero-w with fresh install of Raspbian 10 Buster:\nYou don't have enough free space in /var/cache/apt/archives/.\n\nThe other answers here are valid, but this fresh image had no significant previous packages for removal, so removing them didn't help.\nsolution (1): use raspi-config --> Advanced --> Expand Filesystem\nthis will expand the root filesystem to use the entire sd card.\nsolution (2): or from the command line:\nraspi-config --expand-rootfs\n\n\nA: The issue re: 'You don't have enough free spacve in /var/cache/apt/archives/' may be related to this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/update-manager/+bug/1054903\nParticularly if /var/cache/apt is on a tmpfs which gets erased every boot. Is it possible that you've sym-linked /var/cache/ to /tmp/cache/ or something similar in order to save space?\nIf this is the case the instructions to solve/work-arround it are on the bug report above.\n\nA: This is more of a workaround/helpful tip.\nThis was happening on my virtual machine because I had allocated too much space to swap (close to 40%). I quickly resized it using gparted and was able to reclaim some more space for the root partition.\nNow I can update the long neglected VM which required about 3GB of updates.\n\nA: I hit this error and fixed this by removing none docker.\nyou can remove none docker by one of these lines:\ndocker rmi $(docker images -f \"dangling=true\" -q) -f\ndocker rm $(docker ps -a -q)\ndocker image rm $(docker image ls -f 'dangling=true' -q)\n\n", "Q: Problem installing Bumblebee on Ubuntu 10.10 I am installing bumblebee on my laptop(Ubuntu 10.10),and there are some problems when I use this code to install it:\n  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable\n  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\n  sudo apt-get update\n  sudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia\n  sudo usermod -a -G bumblebee roselectric\n  sudo reboot\n\nI got this message in terminal:\n  The following packages have unmet dependencies:\n  bumblebee-nvidia: Depends: nvidia-current (>= 260.19.12~) but 260.19.06-0ubuntu1 is  not going to be installed\n  E: Broken packages\n\nThen I used sudo apt-get install to install nvidia-current and bumblebee, and installation succeeded.

(11.04 is almost EOL, it will be end of life when 12.10 is released in October of 2012.)\nAlso, the PPA that LnxSlck referenced (in his now-deleted answer to this question) does not publish Maverick packages.  Also, PPAs cannot publish (new) Maverick or EOL-release packages (EOL being Jaunty, Maverick, and others), which is why there are no Maverick packages containing updated nvidia drivers in that PPA.\nThis answer is basically a copy of my answer to \"Ubuntu 10.10 cannot get nVidia driver 260.19.12?\", which is regarding the PPA which was referenced in another answer to this question.  This answer is supported by current information regarding LaunchPad and EOL release support for PPAs.  LaunchPad does not support EOL release packages in PPAs anymore, and new EOL-release packages cannot be uploaded to, or be built within, PPAs on Launchpad.\n", "Q: How do I fix the \"Cannot source a directory: $HOME/.vimrc\" error which pops up when I open GVim?

Always be careful when dealing or using partitioning software.  When you get to the Installation type screen, that's where you can create/modify partitions\n\n\nFor more info you may look at Manual disk partitioning guide for Ubuntu\n\nA: If you want a tool to modify partitions you can install GParted (it's partition manager).\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nBut if you intend to use a partition manager in the system installation process you can choose this option while installing Ubuntu:\n\nAfter that you will see it: (here is where you modify your partition)\n\nIf your having some doubts you can check the Getting Started with Ubuntu - Manual it's a beginner guide that will teach you every thing about Ubuntu, and it's update always when a new version of the operating system is released.\n\nA: I've always found gparted a lot more flexible than the partition tool during the installation. In another part of StackExchange I already once described how to use gparted.\nYou could use a livecd (which has gparted installed by default) to shrink your Windows partition(s) and create partitions for your new Ubuntu installation.

I use Steam and I have nearly 200 games for it http://steamcommunity.com/id/avalanch07/games?tab=all\nHow compatible or friendly is Ubuntu with DirectX?  Also keep in mind that several of my favorite games use GFWL such as Fable 3, Dawn of War 2, Red Faction Guerrilla among others. \nI have been thinking about installing Ubuntu to run alongside Windows but first, I need to know how reliable Ubuntu is as a gaming platform?\n\nA: Ubuntu is 0% compatible with DX. DX is a Microsoft product so it ends there.\nBut ... you can use Steam with Wine and Play on Linux (I normally would include as much info as I can but this is rather lengthy so I will just post the link). Both PoL and wine can be installed through Ubuntu Software Center. For me games have had mixed results though when using wine. \nThe link has an important note: \n\nPlease note: Games run with these methods will be slower than running them on Windows because the games are not native executable files. To get the best performance we will need to wait for Valve to develop a native Steam client (which is now happening). \n\nIf you follow that guide you will have a working steam with wine but you will need to check games 1 at a time. It is by no means a '1 install and all play'. \n\nYou might be a bit early with your question though. \nValve is in the process of opening a native Ubuntun client for Steam. They made Left 4 Dead 2 their 1st game to run under Linux. As soon as this is perfect they plan to release games at a steady pace. As far as I understood it they are porting their games to be capable running with Direct3D (so no DX). For now you will have to rely on wine though.\n", "Q: Slow for no apparent reason Ubuntu is becoming slow for no apparent reason.

Installing a new distro (probably not Ubuntu, I've had it with bugs and slowness for the time being) will fix this problem too, so I'm going to close this question. Thanks again for the help.\n\nA: OK, so I don't know what the particular problem here might be, but here is a very basic approach that I usually take in such a case. Forgive me if you think it is too simplistic.\nI usually open a terminal window and type\n`top`\n\nThis is a terminal (ncurses) based program with a not very intuitive interface; there are more elaborate graphic alternatives, but I prefer this, because in itself it takes next to no resources.\n\nBy default, the list is ordered by CPU usage. However, pressing SHIFT-M sorts the list by memory usage.\nI keep this window opened, either on a second monitor or resized to take 1/5 of the screen and \"always on top\". I start working normally, and watch the window. After a while it becomes apparent what are the main problems.\nFor memory, google-chrome is often one of the culprits (I'm one of these who open pathologically many tabs). For disk usage, watch for anything with \"io\" in the name. Do that, and post the results. Preferably at times when you would expect the OS to run smoothly (ie not while watching a movie).\n\nA: First I would disconnect the PC-Power supply because it can damage the Computer and I would replace with another old PC-Power supply that is completely sure it works, not a new one. Otherwise I would try to test Volts at the PC-Power supply. Second I would perform a memory test, it seems that you have to leave it a whole night, I am not sure. Third I would disconnect everything from the motherboard, except the processor and the memory, if necessary I would replace by old hardware that is correctly working. I would neither use network nor DVD-ROM, and I would test if system is still freezing. I would probably try to test during half an hour the hard-disk\nIf there is not a hardware issue the I would use the gnome-system-monitor to test: Time of CPU & writable memory of the most time-loaded processes to see if this information matches what I am really running on the PC. I would probably try to disable as much as starting processes that I could. I would inspect drivers versions, I would try to reinstall them, I would disable any kind of tools that can be loaded for modem or printers. Probably I would try to re-install Ubuntu in a separate partition with a text-installation, or I would load in a safe mode to test, I would also load a tty console without X-Window to test, from the recovery boot.\nFinally I would ask about how to define the run levels at sysv-rc-conf, which seems to be a good tool to configure services.\n2 part\nAMD proccessors are not as quicker as expected, they are much hottest than expected, except a very few of them, which follow the standard architecture as the classical Phenom II x4 or Athlon II x 4. Your processor is a very modern one which is really not enough tested, and which is supposed to need a later implementation by software. Your proccessor has got 6 cores but each two pair of cores share the floating point unit and all the 6 cores share the same L3 cache.\nAll this info is very confusing for everybody what you can do is to test from Windows OS with http://www.cpubenchmark.net/ This is the best site to test hardware, specially you may compare with itself from other computers also than with Intel i5 2500k, for example. You must download a windows program to test your computer.\nYou can also test with inxi -v 1 if your NVIDIA Driver Version is the same that is shown at /usr/bin/nvidia-settings, that you should have installed. You should try to use the nvidia driver from nvidia web site, for example for a GeForce GTX 550 the driver is called NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-295.59.run.\nI normally build my computers from components, I do not buy a whole computer. You may ask your dealer to open the PC case and just see if the LM317 chipset (or similar voltage regulator at the power supply), seems a little bit burned. If so it should have its thermal silicone (between this chipset and its cooler) brown.\n3 part\nI should boot with the recovery mode, load to the Network, back again recover the broken packages, delete whatever has been installed and its not necessary, \nHow can I install Linux Kernel 3.0 in 11.04?\nv3.0-oneiric mainline tree.\nTo try a newer kernel download the following .deb files from the [v3.0-oneiric mainline tree][2].\n\n    headers_i386.deb or headers.amd64.deb depending if you are using 32bit or 64bit\n    headers_all.deb\n    image_i386.deb or image_amd64.deb depending if you are using 32bit or 64bit\n\nInstall via\n\ncd ~/Downloads\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\nsudo update-grub\n\n4 Part\nsrs@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install boot-repair\n\n\nI could not believe that you where in an irrecoverable trouble, as far as I am just beginning in this forum and I see you have got a lot of reputation. \nI have tried to understand Linux several years ago, and I could not. I was using an old computer for it. I did not know that Ubuntu at my old computer use to crash because the memory was damaged.\nOne day I decided to build a new one with a Intel i5 2500k and medium-cost components and cards.

Obviously the new machine cannot be on line as it contains no operating system.\n\nA: Yes. You're describing the standard installation method.\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/burn-a-cd-on-windows\n\nA: Yes!\nYou might create a liveCD by burning the official ISO(be sure to download a 64bit version if your computer can support it and you plan to add more than 4gb of RAM) to a CD or DVD, and then booting your computer from it.\nYou can also create a liveUSB by using a piece of software called UNetbootin and using the official ISO. A liveUSB flash drive is exactly like a liveCD, however various people have reported to have run into various kinds of issues, although I never have faced such an issue, to be honest.\nNow, as for the internet connectivity issue, Ubuntu will most likely auto-configure your network card, and be able to connect to the internet, if you configure your network access settings, even from the beginning of the installation procedure. That means that it may connect to the internet to update several packages that may be out of date. If you connect your computer via a wired connection, rather than a wireless one, that configuration will happen automatically, requiring no action from your part, making the installation very easy.\n[NOTE]: You can use UNetbootin with Windows, Linux and MacOS to create a bootable usb flash drive.\n", "Q: Installing ATI Catalyst in Samsung 305u Notebook I installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on my Samsung 305U notebook.

I was wondering if there is a way of changing the color of the >>> characters at the beginning of a newline in Python when accessed from Ubuntu's terminal.\nI already edited the ~/.bashrc file to change the color of the text in my terminal, but is there any file like this for Python?\n\nA: Python has two prompts, ps1 and ps2, which are found in the sys module. As the sys module documentation informs us, ps1 is the primary prompt and shows, by default, the usual >>> , while ps2 is the secondary prompt and shows ...  by default.\nYou can customize the characters of the prompts by assigning a string to them. For example, you can change >>>  to ~~~  by running in a Python console:\n>>> import sys\n>>> sys.ps1 = '~~~ '\n\nThe string assigned to the prompts also accepts ANSI escape sequences which allow change the color of the prompts. For example, you can use the following to change the primary prompt's color to red:\n>>> import sys\n>>> sys.ps1 = '\\033[0;31m>>> \\033[0m'\n\nYou can find more color codes in Prakasaka's GitHub Gist. Note that the actual displayed colors depend on the colors you θσε in your terminal's theme.\nChanging the prompts the way described above will only affect the current Python console that the commands run in.\nTo make the changes persistent, you can create a Python startup file with the change you want to have in your prompt and assign it to the PYTHONSTARTUP environment variable. You can do that as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Create the file ~/.pythonstartup:\nnano ~/.pythonstartup\n\nNote: You can actually name the file however you wish and put it where you want. Just make sure to use your custom file and path where required at the next steps.\n\n\n*Add the commands that customize your prompt to the file. Here I will add the commands for the red prompt that I used above:\nimport sys\nsys.ps1 = '\\033[0;31m>>> \\033[0m'\n\nNote: In some cases this format might cause issues such as when trying to use the arrow keys to call commands from your history. If this is happening, use this format instead:\nimport sys\nsys.ps1 = '\\x01\\033[31m\\x02>>> \\x01\\033[0m\\x02'\n\n\n\n*Save and close the file by pressing Ctrl+O and then Ctrl+X.\n\n\n*Assuming you're using the Bash shell, append the following to your ~/.bashrc file:\nexport PYTHONSTARTUP=$HOME/.pythonstartup\n\nThis command assigns the ~/.pythonstartup to the PYTHONSTARTUP variable and exports it to the shell.\nNow, if you open a new terminal with a Python console, you should have a nice red prompt!\nReferences:\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33683744/change-python-interactive-prompt\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5837259/installing-pythonstartup-file\n\n*https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/64558\n", "Q: Is it possible to make a dual Windows 7 & Ubuntu bootable USB flash drive?

The remaining space would be turned into unallocated space. Then you can make a new partition in that space.\nHere is the tutorial for gparted: http://www.addictivetips.com/ubuntu-linux-tips/use-gparted-to-manage-your-disk-partitions-in-ubuntu-linux/\nAfter that, you can normally install your Windows. But you won't be able to boot back into Ubuntu as the GRUB, needed to boot Ubuntu, would be replaced by the boot loader of Windows.\nYou would need a Live USB/CD/DVD of Ubuntu. After installing Windows, boot with any Live media. Open up a terminal and run the following commands:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nsudo update-grub\n\nNote that here /dev/sda is the name of the harddisk. To check the name of your harddisk run sudo fdisk -l. You'll see several names like /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, etc. These are the names of the partitions, but /dev/sda is the name of the disk.\n\nA: i think, the best solution for you is using of Acronis Disk Director Suite (google it).

It reports no boot device. The /boot partition is on /dev/sda1 and is marked as bootable, and when I installed Ubuntu, I told it to install grub to the MBR. \nAny suggestions for what I should check next?\n\nA: I have a similar problem with a Dell PowerEdge SC440 with the Dell SAS 5 controller. I wanted to upgrade my hard disks from 2x160 GB in RAID-1 (mirroring) to 2x2TB in RAID-0 (striping). Creating the \"virtual disk\" worked, installing Ubuntu as well, but after rebooting the BIOS doesn't recognise the \"virtual disk\" as a bootable device. \nSo, in my case, the problem is not with OS installation, but with the SAS and BIOS \"integration\". In the Setup Utility, under Boot Order, you should see an entry with something like (in my case) \"#0240 ID00 LUN0 Dell    VIRTUAL\". If you don't see this, the problem is not with Ubuntu, but with SAS/BIOS.\nI got things working by reconfiguring the drives in RAID-1. The BIOS then picked up the virtual drive and booting works.\nSorry I don't have an immediate solution for you, but I hope it helps troubleshooting your problem.\nCheers,\nbert\n\nA: I want to share with you my experience with ubuntu 14.04 under DELL Poweredge T110.\nI have not a raid configuration, i wanted to add just more space so i added a new SAS Disc (450 GB - 15000 RTM) and evry time i connect the new disc, ubuntu won't to start (i got: initramfs)... \nAfter weeks of searching the reason, i discovred that DELL SAS Controller is very slow to start, so ubuntu could not see the new disc properly, That was the reason.\nHow did i solved this ?\nSimply by:\nchangin the rootdelay value in grub linke this:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"rootdelay=90\"\n\nThen update the grub:\nsudo update-grub\n\nfinally, reboot.\n", "Q: How to not install recommended and suggested packages? I use Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit, I did the following: sudo gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf and added\nAPT::Install-Recommends \"false\";\nAPT::Install-Suggests \"false\"; \n\nBut it did not work. When I try to install a package, it still wants to install the suggested and recommended packages. How can I solve this?\n\nA: You might be like me and have an /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99synaptic file lurking around. I'm still not entirely sure where this file came from but it contains one line:\nAPT::Install-Recommends \"true\";\n\nThat would certainly have overridden a change in /etc/apt/apt.conf. I can't see that the file is used by any package any longer so I would suggest just deleting it (check the contents are similar) or swapping true for false.\n\nA: According to me, changing conf files are too risky and unnecessary. Rather apt-get provides options to specify do not install recommended packages.\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends package-name\n\nThis is better than changing conf file.\n\nA: The correct syntax in recent versions appears to be:\nAPT::Install-Suggests \"0\";\nAPT::Install-Recommends \"0\";\n\nYou can put this in /etc/apt/apt.conf (which no longer exists by default) or in a file such as 99local in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d.\nWatch out for any other files in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d which may override your settings.\n\nA: You can specify configuration strings from the command line, using the -o option.\nThis works for me (APT v.1.4.8) (sudo as needed):\napt-get install package1 package2 -o APT::Install-Suggests=0 -o APT::Install-Recommends=0\n\n\nA: Use the following command to add it to /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99norecommend:\napt-config dump | grep -we Recommends -e Suggests | sed s/1/0/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99norecommend\n\nCheck the current settings by:\napt-config dump | grep -we Recommends -e Suggests\n\nSee: Can I make apt-get always use --no-install-recommends?\n\nA: Checked today (07 Jan 2015).\nThese settings work well for me:\n\nAPT::Install-Recommends \"false\";\nAPT::Install-Suggests \"false\";\nThis solution does not work:\n\nAPT::Get::Install-Recommends \"false\";\nAPT::Get::Install-Suggests \"false\";\n\nA: If you do not want to install recomended packages you can run apt-get with the --no-install-recommends flag or aptitude with the --without-recommends/-R flag. \n\nIf you want these flags to always be enabled (I do NOT recommend this) put the following lines in your /etc/apt/apt.conf file:\nAPT::Get::Install-Recommends \"false\";\nAPT::Get::Install-Suggests \"false\";\n\nRemember that these packages are recommended for a reason and it is probably not a good idea to ignore it at all times. You would be better off using the flags in the cases where you know that the recommended packages are wrong.\n\nA: I would recommend creating /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/60user file with the single line:\nAPT::Install-Recommends \"false\";\n\nThis works fine for me on 12.04.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One - Nautilus integration I've uninstalled Ubuntu One from my system (Ubuntu 12.04) but I still get the Ubuntu One right click menu item (share, get link, etc) and the folders I used to sync still show Ubuntu One's icons (synced, syncing, etc) These issues happening in Nautilus.\nIs there any way to get rid of this integration?\n\nA: Run the following commands:\nsudo apt-get purge ubuntuone-client* python-ubuntuone-storage*\n\nAlso, delete all the related folders:\nrm -rf ~/.local/share/ubuntuone ~/.cache/ubuntuone ~/.config/ubuntuone ~/Ubuntu\\ One\n\n\nA: If you have not logged out and back in, the plug-in code is still loaded and running in Nautilus.

As a simple example, I have my cron settings as\n@hourly xlogo\n\nand if I launch xlogo from an interactive command, it works fine. However, when run by cron, the xlogo window never launches. How can I get cron to let xlogo launch a window, or is it just fundamentally not designed to do that?\n\nA: You need to tell it which display to use with the export command. I also would recommend always using the full path to a file with cron. It will save you a lot of headaches, as cron runs in a limited environment, so it doesn't always have the same $PATH variable as your terminal. This means it doesn't always know where programs are located. \nAt any rate, your cron job would look something like this:\n@hourly export DISPLAY=:0.0 && /usr/bin/xlogo\n\n\nA: It is totally possible to do this with crontab.\nYou need to tell the script which screen you want xlogo to run on. \nTry changing the line to this:\n@hourly /usr/bin/env DISPLAY=:0.0 /usr/bin/xlogo\n\nto tell crontab what display you want it to use. Depending on the program you might need to add in more enviornment variables as well.\n", "Q: Is any version of Ubuntu compatible with Lenovo R60? I have a legacy Lenovo R60 laptop running an Intel Core Solo T3100 (1.67MHz) processor currently running Windows XP (192mb RAM / 40GB HDD).

I would love any tips that a Linux noob can use, and a link to the exact version of Ubuntu to be downloaded would be really appreciated!\n\nA: The latest version of Lubuntu (12.04)should work just fine. You can download it from here. (Choose the recommended 32 bit disk image unless your Laptop can run a 64 bit Operating system)\nAlso since you want to run it on a USB drive, you can easily create a live USB using lili USB disk creator on your windows set up. \nYou can also watch this video for a step by step guide in creating bootable USB pen drive. \nMake sure you choose the 'PERSITENCE'option in Lili USB disk creator, which in simpler terms will allow you to install programs and store files on the pen drive and not lose them when you shut down or reboot. So in essence you would have your Ubuntu set up on a pen drive.\nSince you want to run the OS solely via the pen drive I'd recommend a >=4GB one.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I have run Ubuntu 10.x on T40 series laptops.  You can't get very good screen resolution with those older and they won't be able to run Unity.  So 10.x is about the best you're going to do.  It does run very fast for me on those machines.\n\nA: I'd try using Lubuntu.  It is a tad more streamlined for older, lesser-powered machines.  12.04 should work, if it doesnt, you can always try 11.10 (which is not End-Of-Life yet, at the time of this post.)\n(From my experience, Lubuntu works a bit better on older or low-powered systems in comparison to Ubuntu)\nRegardless of which version/derivative of Ubuntu you install, you should put a decent-sized swap partition in, i'd recommend > 2GB, so that the swap can kick in if RAM gets eaten up.\n", "Q: Software center crashes; fieldrunners need to be reinstalled; can't find achive \nCould not initialize the package information.

Firstly following the official instructions and then not finding it explanatory enough followed this page guides. \nIn short not surprisingly it didn't work with errors like: Bumblebee service is not running and graphic module can't be found but it also left me with a glitchy graphic experience. (As an example hovering the mouse over menu items leaves a trace and highlighting texts specially in bash causes the highlights to overlap creating a mess)\nSo I reversed every single thing I had done to go back to where I started. Un-installing all the installed packages including bumblebee, nvidia drivers and anything else I had installed according to the guides and in the end disabled my nVidia again from the BIOS.\nBut the buggy, glitchy, laggy graphic is still with me. I even disabled the open source Intel driver, rebooted and still no success.

I can't seem to tile windows side by side. Before I would grab the title bar of the window and move the window to the right. It then would be resized to half the screen size. I would then take the next window and do the same thing on the opposite side. Now, I can't seem to do that anymore. Anyone know why?\n\nA: If you drag the window to the screen edge you should see an orangish shape where the window will snap to if you release.  You can also use the Cntl+Super+arrow key to snap the active window to one side or another.\nFinally, this is a compiz plugin called Grid.  Install and open compizconfig settings manager (ccsm) and choose Grid from the Window Management section.

I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 off my USB drive at the moment because my hard drive has no OS and won't allow Windows 7 to install on my internal hard drive.\nHere's the low down though: \nI was trying to install Windows 7 on my laptop and kept getting an error which forced me to open DiskPart up. I had two partitions 60GB and 220GB. All my stuff was saved on my 220GB hard drive and I wanted to install my OS on the 60GB hard drive, but I cleaned disk 0 on DiskPart and now its all unallocated space with no partitions. \nI'm hoping it didn't format the drive seeing as the clean was done in a split second. So I have no OS and I booted Ubuntu 12.04 and I'm now trying to access the internal hard drive but it won't show up in the terminal when I type df -h.\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: When you say you \"cleaned disk 0\" I'm really hoping that doesn't mean you deleted the partition table from disk 0. If that is the case, do not panic as there are ways of getting it back. BUT DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING. This is now a data recovery issue so the less you touch the drive the more data you will get back.\nNewer versions of gparted have a tool to recover hard drive partitions but I still recommend dedicated tools to do that. Before you do anything however, you should clarify the current situation by booting into your USB, running gparted, and either posting a screen shot of that drive or listing exactly what partitions exist and their sizes / formats.\n", "Q: Problem with Internet connection I have Windows Vista and 12.04 on my Dell D630 laptop.

I spent the night trying to get rid of my Windows XP operating system and around midnight I discovered a way to get rid of it. The problem is while I did get rid of the operating system, I hadn't yet found a way to get Ubuntu to do a proper download and install. So my dilemma is that I now have a laptop that when turned on says Operating System not found. Any ideas?\nPS I did try Pendrive Linux to download it and attempted to install it with the CD. The night before I did try and do it directly from the website but it kept getting interrupted. \n\nA: You will need another computer with an operating system and internet connection to download the Ubuntu ISO image from http://www.ubuntu.com.\nPress the Start Download button to begin downloading from here. Choose 32bit version if your computer has less than 4GB of memory (RAM).\nOnce the ISO is downloaded, burn the ISO file into a CD or create a bootable USB drive.\nNow take this CD or USB drive back to your computer and boot from the CD or USB. \nChoose Try Ubuntu and make sure the display, sound, and internet works. \nclick on Install Ubuntu icon to start the installation when you are satisfied.\nThe more general question of how to install Ubuntu is answered in greater detail here: How do I install Ubuntu? \nHope this helps\n", "Q: Access dbus session bus from upstart script I was wandering if it is possible to access the DBUS session bus from within an upstart script.\nThe background is this:\nI am running an upstart task in user mode and replaced the Upstart.conf dbus configuration file with the one from the upstart bzr repository. \nNow it would like to access the gnome keyring within that tasks script using gkeyring, which needs to access the users upstart session bus. By default, I just get the Gnome keyring not available. \nWhen I try to export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=... within the upstart script, the script/initctl command just hangs, no output anywhere.\nThis leads me to believe that since upstart uses DBUS as well, using the session bus is problematic.

But since upstart tasks are run in a \"restrictive environment\" you will not have access to that variable in a system job (e.g. those under /etc/init). However if you were to have it as a session job (e.g. under /usr/share/upstart/sessions) you are going to have access to a lot of more environment variables. Moreover such jobs are not executed as root but as the session user. For example:\nstart on started dbus\nstop on stopping dbus\n\nrespawn\nrespawn limit 10 5\n\nkill timeout 20\n\nexec /PATH/TO/MY/JOB\n\n", "Q: Set default user session to XFCE4 How do I set the default user session to XFCE4? \nI have tried: \nsudo /usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm-set-defaults --session xfce\nsudo /usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm-set-defaults --session xfce4\nsudo /usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm-set-defaults --session xubuntu-desktop\nI am using xRDP and do not have access to the normal greeter. \n\nA: It works with xfce4-session. \nsudo /usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm-set-defaults --session xfce4-session\n\n\nA: On Ubuntu 16.04.1, \nI installed xubuntu-default-settings and it works fine.

How to turn off this behavior? Is there anything like in Nautilus which would allow to select appropriate action?\n\nA: There is no real gui option in Dolphin that allows you to do what you want, but I think the way to do this would be to edit the list of mime types, as has been suggested by 'Farry' on the KDE forums. I have just tested the method below quoted from the KDE forums and it did work for me. Make sure to update the mime database as in the instructions and quit Dolphin and reload it to see the difference (restart if necessary). \nQuoted from the KDE forum, (with my gksudo gedit addition) credit to 'Farry':\n(Make a backup of the file before you proceed)\ngksudo gedit /usr/share/mime/packages/freedesktop.org.xml\nand find the line that starts the shellscript section:\n  <mime-type type=\"application/x-shellscript\">\nthen scroll down to find this line within that section:\n   <sub-class-of type=\"application/x-executable\"/>\nthen comment it out like so:\n   <!-- <sub-class-of type=\"application/x-executable\"/> -->\nsave that, then compile it with this command:\n  sudo update-mime-database /usr/share/mime\n\nAs I said, it worked for me and it should for anyone, as long as you use gedit's  search capability to find the right part of the file to edit; be careful as it is an important file. As I mentioned earlier, it is important to make a backup of it before editing it. \nIn the future, if you want to return to the original state of the file and let scripts execute when clicking on them, the commenting out as discussed above can be removed and the mime database updated again.\n", "Q: Dual boot with Windows 7 (3 partitions) on an Acer Aspire One I have an Acer Aspire One from the AO725 series, with a 320gb hard drive, preinstalled with Windows 7 home Premium. It has the following three partitions:\nsda1 (ntfs) 13958 MB - the Acer recover partition\nsda2 (ntfs) 35 MB - the boot sector?\nsda3 (ntfs) 306006 MB - the main partition for everything else\n\nWhat I thought of doing was making the 4th partition an extended partition, and then putting in three logical partitions - \none for root: /\none for home: /home, \nand one for swap. \n\n(this way I get to keep the recover partition in case something happens to Windows) Are there any problems with that? (for example, will I be able to use the recovery partition if I ever need it?) Will a standard Ubuntu installer with manual partitioning handle all this well, or do I need to do something special to prevent Grub for overwriting the MBR badly?\n\nA: Your plan of action looks OK to me. \nI have never used the Windows recovery partition, so I can't say how it will work, in particular if it will delete the logical partitions and all it's contents.\nGrub should be installed on sda (not sda1 or any of the other partitions) by default. This will overwrite the MBR and that is normal as grub will takeover the function of MBR and give you the choice to boot Ubuntu, Windows 7 normal use, or Windows 7 Recovery.\n", "Q: Is there a command to upgrade a package and all its dependencies without upgrading all packages? We have a meta-package, similar to ubuntu-desktop, that requires a bunch of dependencies to run some internal, not-yet-packaged code. Currently we are updating the meta-package so that it requires >= the current version every time we repackage it so that its dependencies will be upgraded when it is installed. However, if there was a way to upgrade a package and all its dependencies without upgrading all packages then that would be much simpler. Is that possible?\n\nA: Not directly, as far as I know. You can use a little shell snippet to generate the list of dependencies of the package and upgrade these (assuming you aren't interested in recursive dependencies):\napt-get install our-metapackage $(dpkg-query -Wf '${Depends}' our-metapackage | sed 's/ *\\(([^()]*)\\)\\? *[,|] */\\n/g')\n\nAn alternative approach would be to supply your packages through a repository with a unique origin. Write an APT preferences file that specifies only your repository as having a normal priority and everything else as having too low a priority to be installed automatically. (See APT pinning in the APT manual for explanations.) I won't go into details about making the repository (this would be material for a separate question, which may well exist already). To specify that packages from your repository get upgraded and others don't, write the following file as /etc/apt/preferences.nnutter:\nPackage: *\nPin: release o=nnutter\nPin-Priority: 500\n\nPackage: *\nPin-Prority: 100\n\n500 is the normal priority. 100 causes packages not to be upgraded, though the package will be installed if required by dependencies. Run apt-get upgrade or apt-get dist-upgrade with this APT preferences file when you only want to upgrade packages from the nnutter repository:\napt-get -o Dir::Etc::Preferences=/etc/apt/preferences.nnutter -o Dir::Etc::PreferencesParts=/etc/apt/preferences.nnutter.d upgrade\n\n\nA: You can use wajig command which can be used to put some packages on hold when upgrading \njust type :\nsudo wajig hold SomePackage\n\nsudo wajig unhold \n\ncheck the man page for more info\n", "Q: Laptop Shut down during installation of Ubuntu 12.04 I started installing Ubuntu 12.04 on my Gateway laptop, to replace windows 7 that already was on it.

I'm guessing it got as far as deleting windows before the shutdown.\nNow it boots up, shows the Gateway startup screen then goes blank except for the cursor in the upper left corner. I can't seem to get the cd to load, I hear it run but nothing else, and I can't figure out how to have it boot from the cd as I just got this thing. \nObliviously I messed up the program files badly, how do I fix it correctly? Is there another version of ubuntu I can install that will fix this and turn this back into a working laptop instead of a brick? \nI'd appreciate your help. Thanks.\n\nA: If you were going to delete Windows anyway than nothing bad has happened. You just need to go into BIOS setup (by pressing F2 or Del while on the \"Gateway startup screen\") and make sure your CD drive or USB stick comes first in the list of boot devices. Then you reboot and the machine should start booting from the Ubuntu media.\n", "Q: Cloud Access by a Group I have a group of people who want to access and drop files in the Ubuntu One folder.\nI crudely gave everyone my ID and Password to access the files, but there must be a more elegant way for anyone at any time to access or deposit files in the cloud storage.\nHow do I get each individual access from their own computer?\n\nA: Ubuntu One allows you to share folders with others, with the choice of whether or not to allow them to modify the folder.\nTo share a folder, go to https://one.ubuntu.com/files and open the folder you'd like to share (you need not navigate anywhere to share the root directory of your Ubuntu One storage).

In SMPlayer it says it searches on opensubtitles.org. \nHow can I add some more sites in which it can search, like BS.Player did? \nPlease help me, I don't want to use Windows again.\n\nA: As far as I know, it's hard coded in the source of smplayer. You'd have to manually add code to get new APIs into it. You can easily switch the server used, in src/findsubtitleswindow.cpp, but you'll have to write the API code too.

I have an Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950 for my graphics card. Please help.\n\nA: It may be caused by the GRUB boot loader installed somewhere it cant' be found. Just yesterday I was installing Ubuntu on a laptop and it wouldn't boot - I found that installer mistakingly installed the bootloader on the flash drive which I unplugged before rebooting.\nSee this article for instructions on how to re-install the bootloader.\n", "Q: Can ubuntu backup my Windows 7 files? I have a problem with Windows 7. All efforts to fix it have failed. Someone suggested I install Ubuntu and backup my Windows files. Are there instructions available somewhere?\n\nA: I strongly suspect that what they meant was \"boot from Ubuntu LiveCD/LiveUSB to be able to access Windows 7 files from the live session\". Installing Ubuntu on the hard drive is likely to destroy your files forever, especially if you don't know what to do.\nYou need to somehow make a bootable Ubuntu CD/USB and boot from that. Then you'll be able to access your Windows filesystem and backup your files (to an external HDD, for example).\n\nA: I recommend you to download Ubuntu and burn it into a CD/DVD or into a USB stick.\nNow from the Live version you can see the files and save them.

Obviously, your program will need to be running when the change occurs.\nThere is a special daemon called incron which is like \"cron for inotify\" and is able to run scripts when a file/directory changes. It can be installed with sudo apt-get install incron, then you'll need add a few lines to its configuration file.\nHere's a helpful article: Linux incrond inotify: Monitor Directories For Changes And Take Action\nIf you search synaptic for \"inotify\" you'll find many more libraries and programs with similar functionality.\n\nA: So, using incron, I set it up by running sudo apt-get install incron.\nMy goal: Allow emails with picture attachments sent to an alias (sendtodropbox.com app) to be automatically copied into my blog's photo repository for posting. \nNext I created a simple bash script:\n#!/bin/bash\nls photo.JPG | while read a; do mv $a \"$(echo \"$a\" | sed s/photo.JPG/\"photo$(date +%a%b%d%H%M).jpg\"/)\"; done\nmv photo* ~/Dropbox/Attachments /<photo repo>/\n\nI place the script in ~/, then edit the /etc/incron.allow file to include my user name because these scripts and files are all in my home dir. Next I have to edit the incron config file by running incrontab -e.\nIn here I used ~/Dropbox/Attachments/ IN_MOVED_TO ~/script.sh (I used IN_MOVED_TO because the action of Dropbox placing a file in the Dropbox folder is considered a move)\nThis is working instantaneously when I email my Dropbox a picture from my phone now. I also tested incron with both root and my user name to make sure it worked, my first test as my user was: incrontab -e add the config: ~/ IN_CREATE touch ~/test, I then go to ~/, and run >foo, and test appears.\n", "Q: What does ' (single quote) do in the terminal? If I type ' (single quote, next to the <enter> button) in the terminal and then press enter it drops to a > prompt.  What exactly is this, what's it used for, and what type of commands can I enter here?  \nI can <Ctrl-C> out of it but that's all I got.\n\nA: A terminal does not only accept one-line code. Actually, you can write code (as bash scripting is a programming language) in multiple lines.\nFor example, if you write:\nwhile true; do <enter>\n\nit will show exactly the same > that showed to your case, as well. It lets you input more commands. Now, if you type in:\necho \"Cake is a lie\" <enter>\nsleep 1              <enter>\ndone                 <enter>\n\nit will start running your code (which, in this occasion it is simply a while loop that will output a string every 1 second). This allows you to build up small programs without having to write them in one-line code, like this:\nwhile true; do echo \"Cake is a lie\"; sleep 1; done\n\nwhich, in this case it isn't such a problem, but it could be, in other occasions (with more code to be written).\nSo, it is generally used for writing multiple lines of code. In your occasion, the shell recognizes that you don't have an even number of ' inside your code, and this could not work in any case (the same applies for \"). So, it let's you write more code in order to complete what you've left.\nFor example, if you give as command:\necho \"Cake is a <enter>\n\nthen it will let you continue. And indeed, you can:\nlie\"            <enter>\n\nIt will normally output:\nCake is a\nlie\n\n", "Q: Partition scheme on SSD and HDD I am reformatting my laptop but I am not sure how to setup my partition.\nI have a 120GB SSD and a 320GB HDD. I was planing to setup / on the SSD and /home on  the HDD.\nWill placing my /home on the slower HDD impact the performance of my system? Should I instead use symbolic links for Music/Video/Data from the home folder to the HDD?\n\nA: Having certain HOME directories located on the SSD will considerably speed up your overall system performance. \nHowever I reverted that leaving all subdirectories in their standard location on my HOME on a hard drive simply because backups and restores are easier then. Also in case you break something and will have to re-install your OS you will have to take extra care not to overwrite your symlinked directories on the SSD.\nIn case your SSD is big enough to hold most of HOME (which seems to be so in your case) you may consider putting less frequently used directories or those containing the big files on a separate hard drive and link e.g. ~/Music or ~/Videos to the hard drive location.\nAs the often heard agument that frequent write cycles to the SSD may wear it out earlier may be true but we do have to keep in mind that it also are just those frequent things we may want to have speeded up (then at the cost of the lifetime of our SSD).\n\nA: This depends on how paranoid you are about doing a couple of extra writes to the SSD :) Some people are worried to run apt-get upgrade too often. \nBut yeah, either scheme is viable, having the whole /home on the HDD is more straightforward while symlinking only some directories to the HDD will make Firefox and other apps to start slightly faster.\n", "Q: Packaging with CDBS: Unknown sequence cleanbuilddir I'm trying to create an Ubuntu package for testing, and stick to the rules given at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Complete.\nAs this is CMake build and I need to adapt the arguments to cmake, I'm using\ninclude /usr/share/cdbs/1/class/cmake.mk\n\nin debian/rules.

It can be used to encrypt or sign data and communications to ensure its authenticity.\nThis type of cryptography is based on key pairs. A public key is hosted on a key server (e.g. keyserver.ubuntu.com) and the private key is kept secret. Using the public key, one can verify the signature made by a private key. Likewise, knowing someone's public key will allow you to encrypt a message that can only be read by the holder of the corresponding secret key.\nFurther Reading: GnuPG for Daily Use (a Mini How-To...) \nWhat's this have to do with me?\nIn this context, the apt repository that you are downloading a package from should be signed by a secret key so that you can verify that the packages you are installing come from where they say they are.\nThe actual file in the repository that is signed is the Release file. This file contains the checksums of a number other files in the repository. For instance, here is the file for official Ubuntu 12.10 repository and its corresponding GPG signature. When you install a package, apt verifies the signature.\nFurther Reading: All about secure apt\nCommon Issues\nThe public key for the official Ubuntu archive is already know by your computer, but if you want to add a PPA or third-party repository you must import their key. If you try to update a repository whose key you don't have, you'll see warnings like:\nW: GPG error: http://ppa.launchpad.net oneiric Release: The following signatures\ncouldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY B725097B3ACC3965\n\nWhen you install a package from that repository, you will also receive a warning:\nWARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!\n  dropbox\nInstall these packages without verification [y/N]?\n\nWhile these warnings can be silenced by running apt with the --allow-unauthenticated flag, but it is better to add the key to your system so that you can take advantage of the added security.\nWhen adding a PPA you should use the add-apt-repository tool as this will automatically handle adding the key for you.

My experience over several installations: after a while nobody still uses Windows OS. The only extra to do: with Gparted make a ext4 partition on your PC, and install ubuntu on that partition.  Thanks to grub you will be able to dual boot.\n\nA: \nNote: Wubi is Ubuntu installed onto a Windows drive via the Windows installer\n\nNeither Ubuntu nor Wubi will boot from a dynamic disk\nNeither Ubuntu's bootloader GRUB nor Wubi's bootloader GRUB4DOS can recognize a Microsoft dynamic disk/volume/partition (SFS), and so they cannot boot from it; there is no sense in installing either when you won't be able to boot.\nYou have three options:\n\n*\n\n*Convert the dynamic disk to basic (backup all data first!), after which you can install Wubi or dual-boot with Ubuntu.\n\n*Add another hard disk to your system, install Ubuntu on it and set your system to boot from it; you can choose to boot Windows or Ubuntu from the GRUB menu at startup\n\n*Keep the disk as is, and run Ubuntu in a virtual machine, such as Virtualbox or VMWare Player.\n\n\nA: I've had the same problem too. After days of research, I found that there may have been a complication with the type of hard disk you're using. If it's dynamic, it won't work.\nTo check that, go to Disk Management by looking for it in the Start Menu if you use Windows  7, or type devmgmt in the Run utility in XP.

I am running Ubuntu 12.04 desktop. I have installed LAMP and set up html files, and when I open a browser and navigate to 192.168.1.95 (static internal IP of my server), or 192.168.2.2, the modified index.html file that came with Apache2 appears on screen.  The problem is with connecting through internet, rather than intranet.  I have used a cell phone (WiFi  disabled) to connect through the cell network, as well as giving my external IP to a friend, and asking him to try to open the site.  Each time, however, we receive error 502 Bad Gateway - Response Error, a bad response was received from another proxy server or the destination origin server. \nLet me say that I have already gotten disabled the remote configuration option in my router, so that's not the problem, and I have already forwarded port 80 through my router.  Yes, I'm pretty sure I did it right.  In fact, to test that the router wasn't the problem, I connected my server directly to my modem, which does NOT have an internal router, and still got the same error.  A Google search has told me that my ISP (CenturyLink) does not block port 80, and that others with the same ISP have been successful in hosting their own sites from home.  Obviously I'm not very knowledgeable about this subject, but from my understanding, I've ruled out everything except the server, which means that something is either blocking port 80 on the way in, or the data is never making it back out.  My question is this:\nIs there something (firewall, etc.) in Ubuntu that could be responsible for such an error?  \nI have already enabled, disabled, and opened holes through UFW, and that hasn't made a difference.  One tutorial I read suggested that AppArmor could be a problem, and they suggested that it be uninstalled, so I followed their instructions on how to do so, but I have noticed that there is still an AppArmor folder in /etc/, so I'm not exactly sure what all got done.  If there is any other information you could give me, I would truly appreciate it.  In the event that I overlooked some blatantly obvious solution, I'm really sorry to bother you all, but it hasn't been for lack of effort; I've been working on this for the vast majority of the past two days...\nAlso,  I'm not sure if it makes any difference, or if this is actually related, but I'm having the same problem with SSH; I can SSH into this system over my local network using username@local_IP, but I can't get it to work over a non-local network (yes, I do realize that I need more than just a local IP)  Maybe this helps narrow down the problem, then again, maybe not...\nThanks in advance for your time and support!!!\n\nA: Once you can connect to HTTP/SSH from the local network, the rest is totally beyond control of your Ubuntu machine - it is most definitely either a mis-configuration of the router, your ISP blocking ports, you trying the wrong external IP address or something else.\nThe 502 error suggests that your requests go through some kind of a proxy, which also may complicate the matter.

Just because the following file has the same name, that doesn't mean it is the file firefox is accessing. You can prove to yourself that firefox is not accessing the file you located by renaming it to XPCOMUtils.jsm.bak. Firefox renames a lot of its files locally, and will report to you the filename the server uses, even if it doesn't store it under that same name locally.\n\n*A script may be consuming a large amount of memory, and can cause your system to run out of physical memory and access swap memory.

I manage some deployments with juju. However I am not an island, I have coworkers who also want to manage shared environments.\nI know I can use the following stanza in ~/.juju/environments.yaml to give people access to my juju environment:\nauthorized-keys: [and then put their ssh IDs in here]\n\nWhat other best practices are available to manage multiple environments with multiple system administrators?\n\nA: Juju is really not at this time optimized for multiple admins. In\nparticular, some of the security issues that are currently seen in\nJuju become more pronounced when working with multiple\nadmins. However, with some caveats, this can still remain a useful\noption for a trusted - and thus likely small - group of admins.\nWith that in mind, let's look at the relevant configuration\nitems in the ~/.juju/environment.yaml file.\nThe authorized-keys item is used in the environment bootstrap to\ndefine the public SSH keys for the ubuntu user on the bootstrap node\n(machine 0, on which ZooKeeper runs) and all subsequently provisioned\nnodes. Simply list authorized one public key per line. It will look\nlike the following:\nauthorized-keys: |\n    ssh-rsa AAAblahblahZZZZ user@domain\n    ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAfoobarZZZZ= user2@domain\n\nThis approach is preferrable to using authorized-keys-path - or its\ndefault (~/.ssh/) - which is only suitable for one admin, given that\nyou would then have to share SSH keys (don't do that!). Simply put,\nthis is just a limitation of how authorized-keys-path is\nimplemented.\nNext, cloud providers define their specific security credentials,\nwhich Juju then uses. By way of example, let's take a look at EC2,\nspecifically AWS. For AWS two keys are used to determine access:\naccess-key and secret-key, corresponding to environment variables\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY (these are the\ndefaults if not specified in the config file). The challenge here for\na multiple admin environment - or even the single admin environment -\nis that this information is copied to ZooKeeper and is readily visible\nin the ZK node /environment. See Juju bug #907094.\nIn the AWS example, some degree of control can be provided on your\naccess keys through the use of AWS Identity and Access Management FAQ\n(search for this), but currently there is no mechanism to provide more\nfine-grained control to a given admin in a Juju environment.\nOne additional pattern seen in our own usage, especially in testing,\nis worth noting: a Juju environment (\"control\") set up on a given node\nto control other Juju environments; simply deploy the juju charm\nto have this set up. It takes as a config option the\nenvironment.yaml to be used. Additional admins can then be later\nauthorized as the ubuntu user by manually adding their keys to\n~ubuntu/.ssh/authorized-keys.\nThis allows for a single point to manage some of these concerns, while\nminimizing the headache. It does nothing to address some of the\nsecurity concerns mentioned earlier - you still must have a reasonably\ndeep trust of your other admins.\nJuju will resync environments.yaml to the ZK node /environment upon\nthe use of certain commands (juju add-unit, juju constraints-get,\njuju constraints-set, juju deploy, juju terminate-machine). In\npractice, this will not be terribly useful - except for its real\nintended usage, of supporting constraints. However, it can help\nminimize the need to update authorized-keys files as any newly\nprovisioned machines after the sync will get that; you would then just\nbe responsible for updating earlier provisioned machines.\nWhile I'm on this point, it is worth noting how and where in\n ~ubuntu/.ssh/authorized-keys are actually used:\n\n\n*\n\n*All Juju control commands, with two exceptions, use a SSH tunnel to\nthe ZooKeepeer instance to manage or lookup info from the Juju\nenvironment.

However once I log in to the desktop the touchscreen starts acting like a touchpad. if I touch the screen it acts like a permanent left click, and if I move my finger on the left side of the screen with the mouse on the right, it will follow my motions with a slightly larger motion, much like a touchpad on high sensitivity. Touching in random locations does not make the mouse appear (or jump to a new location like a miscalibrated screen). \nAny ideas?\n\nA: It seems that your touch device works in relative mode.

Even though it is possible to infect it and a small amount of low level bugs have appeared, I wanted to point out the key elements that make it very tough for viruses and malware in general to infect Ubuntu as easy as in Windows, specially the 2 most common effects which are:\n\n\n*\n\n*The action of infecting a computer\n\n*The action of propagating to other computers.\n\n\nUsing the common characteristics of a virus which are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Attaching/Modifying a file\n\n*Attaching/Modifying a process\n\n\nSo why is it so difficult for a virus to infect Ubuntu?. Why is it so difficult to infect the most known parts of Ubuntu for example: \n\n\n*\n\n*The kernel\n\n*Default packages\n\n*PPA Packages\n\n*Other packages (Website DEB Package, Source)\n\n\nA: The system and especially its kernel belongs to root and are write-protected. \nSo a malicious software, if it's launched by a common user, has no way to corrupt any  critical file.\nOf course that means that you should never log in as root or administrator, except if you have a precise reason to do so (i.e. to perform explicit actions on the system), and, in this case, you should log out as soon as possible.\nThis is not peculiar to Ubuntu.

Can Tickr do that instead of RSS feed?\n\nA: If you put the following into an .xml file and run tickr <filename>.xml, then you'll have what you want:\n<rss version=\"0.91\">\n<channel>\n<title>askubuntu.com is rad!</title>\n</channel>\n</rss>\n\nYou could then have the behavior you want (i.e., running appname \"my own text\") by writing a script.

Then running ./my-tickr.sh 'askubuntu is rad!' should behave as desired. Note the use of single quotes around 'askubuntu is rad!': this ensures that each character in your string is interpreted literally (Thanks to January for pointing this out).\n\nA: (Some extra info.)\nYou can just type:\ntickr FILE_NAME\n\nIn that case, the file will be processed as a simple text file, not as an XML one.\nIn settings, you can also enable special characters and then define one character for \"tab\" (eight spaces) and another one for \"new page\" (one empty line).\nOr, with (for instance) \"new page\" = '#' and \"tab\" = \"%\", you can just type:\ntickr -specialchars=y -newpgchar=# -tabchar=% FILE_NAME\n\nTo see how it works, try with FILE_NAME:\nhello hello\n%\nhello hello\n#\nhello\n%\nhello\n%\nhello\n%\nhello\n\n\nA: Just re-reading my previous answer, I think I quite missed the real question.

First, find out what the kernel version is:\nuname -r\n\nIt will show you something like that:\n2.6.32-42-generic-pae\n\nThen, install the headers and reinstall the dkms again:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-2.6.32-42-generic-pae\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall virtualbox-ose-dkms\n\nAs for your GRUB trouble, try to reinstall grub:\nupdate-grub\n\nWhat is the output of that command?\n", "Q: How to move 12.04 from USB to HDD? I recently installed the ISO for 12.04 LTS on a 4GB USB. I installed and started up Ubuntu perfectly from my USB. Now, I had to restart my computer and when I started it back on (from USB) it was practically a freshly installed Ubuntu, with all of my files gone. \nCan someone tell me how to avoid this problem (start up the same way every time so I do not lose files)? Or if there is a possible way to move the ISO to my HDD and then start up from there every time? \n\nA: The iso image is the liveCD / installer. A liveCD is read-only: think of it as a CD-ROM, only it is stored on a USB stick. The system \"installs itself\" in the memory only, and as soon as you switch off the computer it goes away. The LiveCD has two purposes:\n\n\n*\n\n*trying out Ubuntu\n\n*rescue disk\n\n\nYou have three options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu on a hard drive. For this, you need to have space on your hard drive (you can use Windows to reduce the amount the space they are taking up). You do the installation by clicking on the \"Install Ubuntu\" icon on the desktop in the live system.\n\n*Install Ubuntu on the Windows partition of a hard drive. This does not require partitioning, because Ubuntu will be installed within the Windows partition. However, it is known not to work in some cases. Go here from Windows and click on the \"Windows installer\" button.\n\n*Install Ubuntu on a USB stick in a permanent mode. It is possible to do a \"real\" installation on a USB stick. If you want that, read this guide.\n", "Q: Graphical artifacts during installation with Intel based graphics I downloaded and burned the 12.04 (64bit) desktop ubuntu image to a CD and booted to it.  It gave me a visible desktop, but the interface is badly broken, with ghosting when dialog boxes are moved and blocky artifacts covering all text.\nI tried using the self verification tool (boot, hold down a button for menu, select \"Verify CD\"), which claims that the CD is fine.  What can I try next?\nI'm using the Intel HD 4000 integrated graphics.\nUpdate:  I just kept clicking \"next\" and hoping that the defaults would be acceptable.  Ubuntu finished installing, and I rebooted into the fresh install.  The graphics artifacts appear to still be there, but I can't quite tell because all of the UI elements except for the desktop background disappear a few seconds after logging in, and I don't know how to interact with the system.  (Is there a hotkey to bring up a console?)\nUpdate 2: I did all of the above with 12.04 32-bit, with the same results.  Are there any known issues with ubuntu and Intel integrated graphics?\n\nA: user68186's comment gave me the answer.\nUsing the method described on the ubuntu forums, I set nomodeset so that the software does not attempt to use fancy graphics until the X window system has started, and the artifacts disappeared from both installer and installed OS.\nIn case of link rot:\n\n\n*\n\n*When installing from the CD, press F6 and select nomodeset before selecting install.\n\n*Upon first boot, select your Ubuntu install in grub and press e to edit it.

I'm new to Ubuntu, but I installed it because Windows gave me too many virus problems. I heard that Unity is a cross-platform engine, so I can run good graphics games on Linux.\nWhere I can get a list of good games that run on the Unity game engine? I haven't found any in the software center, nor on Unity's website. Can you please point me to a list of good Unity games?\n\nA: You've got things mixed here.. Unity as in Ubuntu's Unity is a GUI.\n\nFounded in 2010, the Unity project started by Mark Shuttleworth and Canonical has gone on to deliver a consistent user experience for desktop and netbook users alike. Putting great design at the heart of the project, Unity and its technologies such as Application indicators, System indicators, and Notify OSD, have strived to solve common problems in the Free Software desktop while optimizing the experience for touch, consistency and collaboration.\nhttp://unity.ubuntu.com/ \n\nUnity as the game engine \n\nUnity is an integrated authoring tool for creating 3D video games or other interactive content such as architectural visualizations or real-time 3D animations.\nhttp://unity3d.com/\n\nThis are the games that use the engine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Among the Sleep\n\n*Battlestar Galactica Online\n\n*Space Paranoids Online\n\n*Cabals:The Card Game\n\n*Family Guy Online\n\n*Fray\n\n*Kerbal Space Program\n\n*Rochard\n\n*Tiger Woods PGA Tour Online\n\n*Wasteland 2 (This one is meant for Linux)\n\n*Slender (video game)\n\n*City of Steam\n\n\nWikipedia.\n\nA: The Unity website does have a list of games made with Unity\nJust to clarify, the Ubuntu Unity (the default user interface) is different from the Unity game engine (Unity3D).  This post refers to the game engine.\nThere are also many other game engines that games for Ubuntu are made in, so the games you play don't have to be Unity based.  Games made for Ubuntu can be found in the Ubuntu Software Centre\nAlso, not all games will run on Ubuntu but there are community projects dedicated to allowing Windows applications to run on Ubuntu.\nThe easiest and most popular method to do so is to use an application called PlayOnLinux.  Follow the instructions to install that application, and it will guide you through getting the application running.  Don't expect applications to run as well as they did on Windows.  There will likely be performance drops in the application as it is trying to simulate another OS while to program is running.\nPlayOnLinux can also run other applications like Microsoft Office 2007 (Not 2010 yet).  If you are feeling brave, it also allows you to add a custom application that is not yet in the database.  This may take some trial and error playing with the settings until it runs well.\nAlso, see the following question.  It will help:\nWhere can I find websites that list games for Ubuntu?

The preview in lxappearance of gnome and suede remain identical, and the icons used when applying the theme are as well.\nI tried editing the index.theme file so that suede would not inherit gnome by deleting the \"Inherits\" line, but there was no effect.

(You can make these permanent using the /etc/fstab file, search AskUbuntu for instructions).\nIt should also be noted that these permissions are only enforced while Ubuntu is running. If the data is on a removeable drive, plugging it into another computer will allow restrictions to be ignored. If it is on an internal drive, physically removing it or booting another operating system (eg, Linux off a USB stick) will allow the restrictions to be circumvented.

I have not used Evolution for long time now and I would like to reset all the settings and start from scratch. How would I be able to do this?\n\nA: For version 3.4, as Evolution switched to dconf, a complete cleanup would mean:\nevolution --force-shutdown\nrm -rf ~/.local/share/evolution\nrm -rf ~/.gconf/apps/evolution\nrm -rf ~/.cache/evolution\nrm -rf ~/.config/evolution\ndconf reset -f /org/gnome/evolution/\n\nTo be absolutely safe, you may additionally remove all gconf info. If it's not there, it cannot be removed (which is fine in your case as well) -- and if it's still there, you want it removed. For this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown gconf: gconftool-2 --shutdown\n\n*Check if the gconf daemon process is gone: ps aux | grep gconf\n\n\n*\n\n*if it's still there, kill it: kill -9 12345 (replace \"12345\" with the PID found)\n\n\n*Let all rockets go, shoot at everything moving:\nsudo gconftool-2 --recursive-unset /apps/evolution\nsudo gconftool --recursive-unset /apps/evolution\ngconftool-2 --recursive-unset /apps/evolution\ngconftool --recursive-unset /apps/evolution\nI put the commands with \"sudo\" first (some howtos mention you must be root for that). After the first gconftool call without sudo, you need to repeat the daemon shutdown, as that command automatically starts it again.\nNow let's verify our success:\ndconf dump /org/gnome/evolution/\ngconftool --dump /apps/evolution\n\nThis should now yield empty sets. If you start Evolution at this point, it should bring up the configuration wizard again (did it for me). If not (rare cases reported that), repeat the above, do not yet start Evolution again, but log out (optionally simply reboot to be on the save side), and login again. Now it should have done its job.\nRemark: As these steps include/cover everything from gconf and dconf, they should work with all Evolution 3.x versions (previous versions had a different directory structure, so things need to be slightly adjusted for them).\n\nA: All the user related information of evolution is stored in gconf. Removing/moving $HOME/.gconf/apps/evolution should reset evolution settings.\n\nA: Note: Removing the gconf directory might not work when being in a GNOME session as it is cached. (And for anybody driving by: 3.2 still uses gconf, these steps would be wrong for version 3.4 and newer).\n", "Q: Problems with LibreOffice 3.6.0.4 rendering MS Office 2007 documents I currently have 10.04 installed with the latest version of LibreOffice.\nBefore, I used to work in Windows 7 and MS Office 2007.

MS Core fonts are not installed as standard in ubuntu and you have to do this manually\nGo to the terminal (Ctrl-Al-T)and type in\nsudo apt-get install msttcorefonts\n\nThis will give you the core fonts, but if there are other TrueType fonts that you want installed, it is as easy as copying the font files to the ~/.fonts/ directory.\n\nA: There are some compatibility issues between MS Word and LO Writer with *.docx file format. If you can, it is better to convert your *.docx files into *.doc (MS Word 97/2003) file format, because *.doc files shows a higher compatibility between MS Word and LO Writer.\n", "Q: Is it possible to move free space from Ubuntu partition to Windows, when Windows is located before Ubuntu?

I know I can boot from liveCD GParted and cut some GB from sda6, but then the unallocated space will be after sda6 and not before, am I right? \nIs it possible to add the unallocated space to sda2 or merge it, if not possible due to partitions position? From the screenshot, it looks like that space can be stuck in the middle of the extended partition:\n\n\nA: Yeah GParted should be able to handle that.

(I have only 1 hard disk of 250GB in my laptop). \nIf possible please explain to what the technical terms mean.\n\nA: If you really have anything on your disk and you don't understand how to create partitions, you are supposed to use the default option, to use all the disk for Ubuntu. Think that I never did it so I don't know how to do it.\nOtherwise you have to create only two partitions:\nFirst one (ext2, ext3 or ext4) which is called '/'. Its the root partition for all the Linux Operating System.\nSecond one (linux-swap) with about 4 GBytes, its a disk space for Linux that where users never reads from or writes in, only Linux manages this partition.\nOnce you have installed Linux, you can resize the first partition and then create others, even compatible with Windows OS. You can perfectly have 5 partitions of 49 Gb and one Linux-Swap partition.\n\nA: There are two kind of disk in terms of legacy partition table.\n\n\n*\n\n*Primary - Generally OS are use this kind of partition. \n\n*Extended  - A special type of primary partition that holds many logical partition.\n\n\nMax number of primary partition (including extended partition) can be 4. Extended partition doesn't take much space. Consider its a packing box and your logical partitions are packed inside it.\nFiletypes of disk parition: \n\n\n*\n\n*These defines how the files will written in disk. Earlier windows (upto xp) used FAT, FAT32. Newer windows file systems called NTFS. \n\n*Unix / Linux uses different file types like ext, ext3, ext4. In addition linux uses a partition with special format called swap.\nNow I am assuming you want to have dual boot with windows. So first 50 GB is for ubuntu, second 50 GB for windows system and rest 150 GB for data.\nNow ubuntu requires a swap partition (not necessarily if you have big amount of ram). Its generally calculated 1.5x RAM SIZE. If you have a 2GB RAM, preserve 1 GB for SWAP, have 4 GB RAM , preserve 512MB. Its your choice. Good amount of SWAP improves performance.\nSteps\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on unallocated space, click on new. Enter size as 48GB (you have to enter in mb), choose file system type as ext4, mount point /, partition type primary This means ubuntu root partition.\n\n*Click on unallocated space, click on new. Enter size as 2GB, choose primary partition, file system type SWAP.\n\n*Click on unallocated space, click on new. Enter size 50 GB, choose primary partition, file type ntfs (I don't remember whether this option available, you can use gparted later to format if its not available .)\n\n*Click on rest unallocated space, click on it. Choose ntfs as file system, partition type logical and create it. This will automatically create extended partition.\nExplanation: \n\n\n*\n\n*Why logical drive in ntfs? Its because it will be available to both windows and ubuntu. Windows can't work with ext file system. \n\n*If you don't want windows at all, you can create all file system with ext4. But remember if you ever try to install windows, you have to reformat everything. Otherwise those drives won't be visible.\n\n*If you don't want to install a windows system, in step 3, choose logical instead of primary.\n\nA: If you are attempting to install Ubuntu alone on the disk, the installer will create the first partition as a primary partition. And that first partition, following the recommendation made earlier, should be mounted at /boot. The default file system for /boot on Ubuntu is ext2. You can use that, or ext4, the default journaling file system on Ubuntu 11.04. The partition number of this boot partition, if it is the first partition on the disk, will be /dev/sda1. While many Linux distributions assign about 500 MB of disk space to /boot, only about 30 MB is used on a new installation of Ubuntu 11.04. If you are tight on disk space, you can go as low as 50 BM, but keep in mind that disk usage on /boot will grow with each upgrade. Click OK to create it.\nNow that /boot has been created, select the free space and click on Add to create other partitions. Note that this step will have to be repeated for all other partitions.\nThe second partition will be for Swap. The installer will attempt to create it as a logical partition, but you do not have to. Like /boot, it could also be a primary partition. The first logical partition of an extended partition is /dev/sda5. If you create this partition as a primary partition, it will be /dev/sda2.\nSelect “Swap area” from the “Use as” dropdown menu. The “Mount point” menu will be disabled because Swap does not need a mount point. A disk size of 2000 MB or 2 GB is usually good enough for Swap. Add.\nThe third partition will be for /. The installer recommends a minimum of 4.4 GB of disk space for installing Ubuntu 11.04, but on a new installation, just 2.3 GB of disk space is used. As more applications are installed on a running system, disk usage will grow, so you want to be very generous here – if you have disk space to spare. The default file system on a non-boot partition is ext4. Other options available are ext3, xfs, jfs and reiserfs. Btrfs is also a file system option, but the disk partitioning scheme for installing Linux on a btrfs file system is slightly different from this one. That will be covered in another article. \nOK to create this partition.\nThe final partition will be for /home. The file system is ext4, and you may use the available disk space here. OK\nBack to the main manual partitioning window, you can see all the partitions just created. Before you click Install Now, you have to determine where GRUB, the boot loader, will be installed. On a standalone installation, the best location is the default – in the Master Boot Record of the disk. It is also possible to install it in the /boot partition, but that is not recommended for this installation.\n\nA: *\n\n*If your Win7 is running normal then use Windows disk management and unallocate your desired free space for Ubuntu 50GB for ext4 journal and same size of your RAM for swap.\n\n*Install Ubuntu via USB disk and a select the option that states Other...(something in that sense...). Then select your unallocated free space to create ext4 and swap.\n\n*If your Win7 is gone as in kaput then you must install it first if you want dual booting.\n\n*If you can do computing without Windows then install Ubuntu in item 2 above with all your drive ext4 and some swap. \n\n", "Q: Can I disconnect an ejected drive even if it is still spinning? I am running Ubuntu 12.04. When I unmount (eject) USB disk, the power LED is always \"ON\" & I can feel disk is still spinning after 10 Minutes.\nThis means disk is not unmounted from system? is it safe to disconnect the USB cable? I does not want to damage my external disk.\n\nA: Yes, after you eject a drive it is safe to disconnect the USB cable and/or cut the power (if the drive uses a power adapter). If you unmount it, just make sure that if it has multiple partitions, all if them are unmounted. \nEjecting or unmounting an external hard drive does not always make it spin down or power down; that behavior is up to the controller inside the hard disk which interfaces between USB and SATA. Ejecting simply tells the drive to finish any pending read/write operations and then ceases all communication. \n\nA: Try running the udisks --detach /dev/sd[letter-of-the-disk] after unmounting the partitions and see if the disk spins down after that?\nFrom the man udisks:\n\n--detach device_file [--detach-options options]\nDetaches (e.g. powering down the physical port the device is connected to) the device represented by device_file using a comma-separated list of options.\n\n", "Q: Copy Paste on a mac I have installed on my mac Ubuntu with VirtualBox.

From the Internet, I read an article that Lubuntu desktop are very light-weight desktop, so I installed it in Ubuntu. When I switched to Lubuntu desktop, the system got a little bit faster, but when I open YouTube site or some other video-streaming websites, the system gets slower.\n\nA: 1. With the 516 MB RAM it would be very advisable to use LXDE/Lubuntu. I use it with 1GB RAM and the difference is huge  compared to using Unity or KDE, and very significant compared to using Xfce/Xubuntu.\n2.The way your computer lags in playing flash in Youtube is a different issue, as it is related not to your RAM or CPU, but to the graphic card (GPU). You have a powerful enough CPU but the Adobe Flash plugin has the odd quality of avoiding using CPU and putting all the load on your GPU. See this question and the answer there and the comment of izx: \n\nFlash 11+ \"attempts\" (poorly, it looks like) to use the GPU (hardware)\n  to \"decode\" the video instead of the CPU (software). Decoding is a\n  fairly computationally intensive task, but most modern CPUs (except\n  Atoms) will deal with 1080P HD without breaking a sweat. It appears\n  that Flash doesn't seem to obey that checkbox and still tries to use the GPU.\n\n(meaning the checkbox in Adobe Flash Player Settings telling it not to use hardware acceleration)\n\nOdd enough, using the HTML5 version of Youtube (which some recommend as a solution in this case) still brings my GPU to 100 degrees Celsius.\nIt seems that there are ways to put your CPU (more powerful) to work, and not your GPU (which is less powerful).\n My favorite solution to this is opening youtube in external player. \nLately I could not use the OpenWith Firefox addon to open youtube videos in VLC, so I recommend especially the Firefox add-on Smplayer context menu or the Youtube player that comes with SMPlayer (smtube). Install in Terminal (instead of Synaptic, which seems to give a version of SMPlayer that does not allow editing its Toolbar)\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:rvm/smplayer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install smplayer smtube\n\n\n\n\nor just Alt-F2\n\nor\n\nTo create a desktop icon the Lubuntu way:\n\n3.To kill processes like you do in Windows, you need to start a Task Manager.\n\n There a different of this kind (gnome-system-monitor, lxtask, xfce4-taskmanager) and according to the desktop environment there are different ways of setting keyboard shortcuts for applications. But that would mean creating a new question (you already put two of them here!)\nTo kill now active window:Alt-F4.\n\nA: Killing a process is easy once you know how. Assuming it's a GUI program (a program with a visible window), you can kill it this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+T to bring up a terminal window.\n\n*In this terminal window, type xkill and press Enter.\n\n*You cursor should turn into a cross.\n\n*Click the window that you want to kill.\n\n\nIf this doesn't work for some reason, instead of xkill type ps -A (capital A is important). This will bring up a list of running processes, with process IDs at the left. To kill a process, simply type kill [ID]. For example, if the entry for Firefox looks like this:\n15686 ?        00:24:23 firefox\n\nyou will have to type kill 15686 to kill Firefox.\n\nA: In addition to Kalle Elmér answer:\npidof firefox | xargs kill\n\nA: Install the software called MiniTube.

I saw the date of /dev/sdc change and thus decided that that was the one.\n\n*Find the place of the unzipped image, which was /home/username/Downloads/2012-10-28-wheezy-raspbian.img for me.\nType the following (mutatis mutandis):\nsudo dd if=/home/username/Downloads/2012-10-28-wheezy-raspbian.img of=/dev/sdc\n\nor with improvements suggested by other users:\nsudo dd if=/home/username/Downloads/2012-10-28-wheezy-raspbian.img of=/dev/sdc status=progress bs=4M\n\nand wait for the command to return. It may be quite a while, especially over usb2.\nResizing can be done from the Pi itself in the raspi-config program that starts automatically the first time you boot.\nBe careful. Make absolutely sure the device name is that of the SD-card. If you replace it with the device name of your hard drive, your hard drive will be overwritten.\n\nA: Use Startup Disk Creator. It should be installed on Ubuntu by default.\nIt worked for me very well.\n\nA: Those are all really great answers...\nI like to add status=progress to the dd command:\nsudo dd if=rasidiskimg.img of=/dev/mmcbl.. status=progress bs=4M\n\n#it reports like so:\n2037383168 bytes (2.0 GB, 1.9 GiB) copied, 198.548 s, 10.3 MB/s\n\n\nA: On Ubuntu versions 14.04, 16.04 and 18.04, right click on the installer image and choose Open with disk images writer. Select your SD card unit and press Start.\n\nA: Some answers mention usb-imagewriter but that doesn't exist anymore (at least on Ubuntu 16.04).\nI used usb-creator-gtk, and that did the trick for me.\n\n\nA: Easy Install & Resize the SD Card on the Raspberry Pi on Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, open a terminal and install the ImageWriter and GParted utilities with apt-get:\nsudo apt-get install usb-imagewriter gparted\n\n\n*Assuming you are starting with a fresh install, download the newest release from the Raspberry Pi download site.\n\n*Extract the downloaded archive, and then open ImageWriter by typping in a console:\nsudo imagewriter\n\n\n*Select the desired .img file and target device, in this case, debian6-19-04-2012.img, and /dev/mmcblk0\n \n\n*Once the image write has completed, the next task is to repartition the SD card. Note: this process can be done at any later as well, it is not limited to only during initial setup! \nFor 13.04 you can find packages here.\nIf you're interested on resizing your SD CARD, check the source of this answer\nSource\n\nA: On 13.10 I couldn't get usb-imagewriter to install E: Unable to locate package usb-imagewriter.\nI found that plain old gnome-disks command Disks from desktop worked.  You can select the usb drive and have the option to Restore disk image.  \n\nA: Install an image to Rasperry Pi by cloning (sometimes called flashing, burning, restoring). If the image is compressed, extract it before cloning, or use a tool that can extract and clone.\ndd (and cp and cat)\nThe basic tool for cloning is dd. You can also use cp or cat for the same purpose. But these three tools are risky, when used to clone, to write to a mass storage device, because they do what you tell them to do without questions. So if you tell them to wipe the family pictures ... and it is a minor typing error away. dd is sometimes nicknamed 'data destroyer'.\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes you can use dd (or cp or cat) for this purpose, but double-check and triple-check that you know what you are doing, and that everything is exactly as it should be before you press the Enter key.\n\n\nSafer tools\nThere are several tools, that help you clone from an image file or a compressed image file, and that provide more security. There is a 'final checkpoint' and the target device is 'seen' in such a way, that it is easy to identify and make sure, that it is the correct target device (not the drive where you store the family pictures).\n\n\n*\n\n*Disks alias gnome-disks has a built-in cloning tool, that you use when you 'restore' from an iso file or image file to a mass storage device, for example an SD card for Raspberry Pi. Disks is built into Ubuntu, so you need not install it. Extract from a compressed image file separately before using Disks (because there is a bug in some versions, bug #1571255).\n\n*mkusb uses dd to clone. It 'wraps a safety belt' around dd. mkusb can also install directly from compressed image files, if compressed with gzip or xz ('file.img.gz' or 'file.img.xz'). Install and use mkusb according to the following links,\nhelp.ubuntu.com/community/mkusb\nExpansion and imaging from a compressed image file\nsudo add-apt-repository universe  # only for standard Ubuntu\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mkusb/ppa  # and press Enter\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install mkusb mkusb-nox usb-pack-efi\n\n\nA: In addition to Wilbert's excellent answer, in order to do this often, the following has the added benefit of compressing and uncompressing the image on the fly, and shows progress using pv (you may need to apt-get install pv):\nI do a backup with:\nsudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0p7 | pv -c -N filesystem | \\\ngzip -c | pv -c -N compressed > backup/mmcblk0p7.img.gz\n\nAnd a restore with:\ncat mmcblk0p7.img.gz | pv -c -N compressed | \\\ngunzip | pv -c -N filesystem | sudo dd of=/dev/mmcblk0p7\n\nMake sure to replace mmcblk0p7 with the partition you want to backup/restore.\n\nA: Startup Disk Creator\nInstall the usb-creator-gtk package using the following command:\n$ sudo apt install usb-creator-gtk\n\nAfter installation, the new tool can be found under the name Startup Disk Creator:\n\nStartup Disk Creator is pretty straightforward to use:\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Disks from the unity launcher.\n\n*Navigate to your SD card in the left pane by clicking on it.\n\n*Next, click on the hamburger menu icon in top right corner.\n\n*Select Restore Disk Image from the menu.\n\n*In the subsequent popup window, next to the Image to Restore field, click on the open folder icon.\n\n*Navigate to the OS image you want to boot and click open and finally click on Start Restoring.(OS image in this case will be a .img file which needs to be extracted from the .zip file which can be downloaded from the Raspberry Pi Website)\n\n\nWait for the process to finish.\n\n\nTested on Ubuntu 16.04\n\nA: When we have only an ubuntu 21.04 live cd and no internet, the stock application is:\ngnome-disks\n\nClick the sd card and the three dots and:\nRestore Disk Image...\n\nIt is possible to go there also with right click on the .img file and:\nOpen with Other Application\n\nDisk Image Writer\n\n", "Q: 'W: Failed to fetch...' while updating This is the output of the command sudo apt-get update.

And I've been successful to the point where I can get on the server with ssh user@hostname. But when the VPN is active, all of my internet passes trough that VPN. \nTarget: I'd like to use my own internet connection for everything other than that SSH connection.\nOption breaks SSH > VPN:\nI've noticed that there is an option \"Use this connection only for resources on its network\" in the \"Editing VPN\" - \"IPv4 settings\" tab - \"Routes...\" button.\nIt seemed like the solution, but if I enable that, I can't connect anymore with the \"ssh user@hostname\" command, it hangs till it times out.\nThoughts: My thoughts so far are that it does not work because the hostname(from ssh username@hostname) and the gateway(from  the VPN settings) are different. But I don't know enough about ssh or VPN to know that.\nIdeas? Is there like an option in ssh that I am overlooking? I tried ssh -b gatewayFromVPN username@hostname but this didn't seem to work (and I doubt it should). Or is there an option in the VPN settings or something that could solve this?\nThanks in advance.\nSummary\n\n\n*\n\n*browse etc > internet connection\n\n*(simultaneously with)\n\n*SSH > VPN connection\n\n\n\"Use this connection only for resources on its network\" breaks SSH > VPN\n\nA: I have wanted to do something similar in the past. I had two ideas: split things based on port and split things based on process owner. Linux's networking system can, it transpires, handle both of these scenarios.\nI asked two questions on Unix.SE. I haven't followed up on either particularly well so if you do play around, let me know what works for you.\n\n\n*\n\n*By port\nOnly allow certain outbound traffic on certain interfaces\n\n*By user Can I limit a user (and their apps) to one network interface?\nI dare say there is some overlap between the two techniques and that's why I mention both of them here. I've also put a large bounty on the second for some solid examples. I think splitting network connections between users is probably the most useful scenario for both of us.\nEdit: I just did a Google for iptables owner and found this. This seems to suggest that a few dirty iptables lines would fix this right up. I'm still to test but it looks positively simple...\nAssume you had eth0 and eth1 connections and you wanted user bob to use eth1 and only ever use eth1, and force everything else onto eth0. This should do it...\niptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT\niptables -A OUTPUT -o eth0 -m owner --uid-owner bob  -j DROP\niptables -A OUTPUT -o eth1 -m owner --uid-owner bob  -j ACCEPT\niptables -A OUTPUT -o eth1 -j DROP\niptables -A OUTPUT -o eth0 -j ALLOW\n\nI'm assuming you can just swap our eth1 for your VPN connection's name and bob for an new user you'll create to run your ssh connection from via: su -c ssh username@host bob.\n\nA: I have kind of achieved what I wanted by running Ubuntu virtually in Windows 7 at the moment. (Currently running VMware Player with Ubuntu 12.04)\nThis way my entire internet on Ubuntu is going through the VPN, but I can use my browser etc in windows 7 what doesn't have that VPN.\nThough this is not what I was aiming for, it will have to do for now.\nMaybe I can run Ubuntu virtually in Ubuntu or something so I don't have the need for windows in the future...\n\nA: After literally hours of searching, I found something simple enough.\nThis is technically known as Split Tunneling and here you can find a perfect tutorial to do this. With Split tunneling you can solve the problem on a different level. You route all your work network traffic through VPN and everything else goes as normal.\nI know this is not exactly the solution you wanted, but after all, It simply works.\n\nA: Best way to achieve this is to define route to your ssh host via vpn gateway, default route via your internet gateway.\nTo further reading:\nroute (8)\n", "Q: Minecraft goes black on 12.04 and EEE901 \nPossible Duplicate:\nCan't get Minecraft to run on Ubuntu \n\nSince downgrading to an older release of Ubuntu won't solve the problem for this version, I try to fix it this way.

While the program is populating the tree the whole GUI hangs.\nIs there a way to populate the tree in another thread so the tree gets populated as the files are found and not when everything has already been added? Or any other ideas?\nThis is what it looks like:\n\nI am populating the tree with this code:\ndef traversePaths(self, path, parent):\n        files = os.listdir(path)\n        files.sort()\n        for myfile in files:\n            if myfile[0] != \".\":\n                if os.path.isdir(path + os.sep + myfile):\n                    current = self.filelist.append(parent,[self.dirIcon,self.dirIcon,self.dirOpenIcon,myfile,\"DD\",True,True,3])\n                    self.traversePaths(path + os.sep + myfile, current)\n                else:\n                    current = self.filelist.append(parent,[self.fileIcon,self.dirIcon,self.dirOpenIcon,myfile,\"AA\",True,True,3])\n\nwhich is executed on a button click:\ndef on_refreshbutton_clicked(self, button):\n    self.traversePaths(self.path.get_filename(), None)\n\nI don't think threading.Thread works because of the gtk thread for the gui and cannot find gi.repository.Gtk api's on the subject\nAny ideas?\n\nA: When asking programming questions, it is always best to provide a minimal working example and not just code snippets. \nWithout a working example to play with, I have the following suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a thread to walk the directory tree and put your results in a second separate treemodel (not connected to a treeview). This means you have two treemodels, one connected (which gets rendered to the screen) and one not connected (which therefore does not get rendered)\n\n*Add a timeout of a few seconds, which does calls a function that detaches and deletes the first treemodel, copies the second treemodel to a new one, which now serves as the \"thread\" treemodel and attaches the second tree model.\n\n\nThe reason why you see the GUI hanging is that the file walker takes very long and every time you add a file, a lot of overhead in Gtk is called. By adding a full treemodel, this overhead is only called one time. And by using a thread for the file walking, your GUI stays responsive. \nAs for the threading part in Gtk, you might want to look here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8120860/python-doing-some-work-on-background-with-gtk-gui\nA couple of notes to your code: \n\n\n*\n\n*Python has a build-in file walker, which might be faster but is certainly shorter than your code: os.walk\n\n*If you want to use your code instead, remember that Python has a build-in recursion limit.

Instead of BIOS, the laptop also uses UEFI. After googling around, I cannot find any guide for this problem (maybe my googling skill is bad).\nHowever, I just tried to install Ubuntu alongside with Windows 7 all by myself. After that, I couldn't boot to Windows. Luckily, I was able to fix that. Now, I want to find a guide to follow to make sure that there would be no problem.\nEDIT 1: I found a guide here that suggests using Boot-Repair:\n- If you want to try grub-efi, it is first necessary to have a GPT disk with an ESP (EFI partition= FAT32, >200Mo, start_of_the_disk, boot flag), and to setup the BIOS in EFI mode. Then you need to install grub-efi (an easy way for this is to use Boot-Repair with the \"Separate /efi\" option). To finish, some old EFI-BIOS need to create an entry that boots the grub*.efi file in the EFI partition.\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2003442&page=2\nHowever, I still don't understand that I must install Ubuntu first (with a partition ? and a swap partition ?) then use Boot-repair or Boot-repair first ?\n\nA: Installing on a UEFI system is not easy, but as a start you can look at ChrUbuntu (for Google Chromebook, which also uses EFI). Basically you'll need to get a boot disk of some kind to get up and running -- perhaps ChromeOS would help?\n", "Q: Tor not starting at system boot I just installed a .onion address forwarded to a local ssh server so I could access my files over multiple network types.

So at the shell, just run JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/ foo and JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/ bar for applications foo and bar.  You can even put this in a script so you don't have to type it each time.\n\nSince you are focused on changing the system-wide default Java runtime, the Ubuntu Community documentation on sudo is one place to read: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sudoers\nThe manpage (ie man sudoers) is another: http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/sudoers.man.html\nYou are correct in stating that you do not want %sudo ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL in your sudoers file.  Instead try something like this:\n    jessegaspar caelum-sala1-9 = (root) NOPASSWD:/usr/local/bin/changejava\n\nThis may be more restrictive than you really want, but it is an example.  It is probably good practice to list the full path to the command, but that may not be the path to your script on your system.\n\nA: Open terminal window and type:\nsudo visudo\n\nIn the bottom of the file,(after \"#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\") type the follow:\nusername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\n\nHope it helps!

So why doesn't it display in my Firefox?\nThe website in question is:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_B\nUbuntu 12.04 (64-bit)\nFirefox 14.0.1\nScreenshot of the problem:\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/ovYxN.png\n\nA: The font being displayed does not have the Linear B characters defined ; the numbered boxes show the Unicode points instead.\nWhen I view the page in both Chromium and Firefox, I see the character replacement blocks, but also an SVG rendering of each character.\nFor a font containing the Linear B script, there is ALPHABETUM (complete with horrible MIDI music...)\n\nA: This is primarily a font problem. It generally takes more than ten years from the adoption of new characters into Unicode to their widespread availability in fonts. (Optimistically speaking. And I’m not joking.)\nIt’s also a browser issue, in the sense that when a web page does not specify fonts, or specifies them generically only, such as sans-serif, browsers will apply different strategies. When their default font does not contain all the characters present on a page, they will use different fallback fonts. And they may fail here—failing to render a character even when some font in the system contains it.\nWhat you can do as a user is to download and install fonts that contain the characters. There are not many of them for Linear B; see\nhttp://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/10083/fontsupport.htm\nAs far as I know, the list on that page is complete except for the Alphabetum font and its free trial version Alpha-Demo, see\nhttp://guindo.pntic.mec.es/~jmag0042/alphaeng.html\nBut there might be some even more rare fonts that support (some of) Linear B.\nYou can also change your browser’s default fonts to view a page with such characters if it does not otherwise work. This is inconvenient because special fonts containing special fonts are not that great for normal browsing.\nWhat you can do as a web author who puts such characters on a page is to declare a suitable font list, or “font stack”. For generalities, see my page Guide to using special characters in HTML. In this case, I would recommend the following (for elements containing Linear B characters):\nfont-family: \"Everson Mono\", Code2001, \"MPH 2B Damase\",\n  Alphabetum, \"ALPHA-Demo\", LastResort;\n\nStill, only a small fraction of visitors would see the characters right, so you might consider including some links to pages where suitable fonts can be downloaded.\n\nA: Google has published the Noto Font family which covers all unicode characters including Linear B, so installing that font on your computer could eliminate having these little square boxes instead of properly rendered fonts.\nNoto stands for No tofu, as tofu is a parallelism for the square boxes of unrendered unicode characters, i.e. characters that the font in use does not cover.\nReference: Wikipedia article of the Noto Font family\n", "Q: How to permanently migrate to 12.04 from Windows 7 without losing anything?

Using a external drive is also an option but I would rather try not to.\nWhat is the easiest way to get rid of Windows 7 without losing any of my data in Windows and Ubuntu?\n\nA: There are many ways of doing this. The cleanest way is to backup your data in the Windows partition and Ubuntu /home in an external hard drive. Re-install Ubuntu erasing everything and restore the backed up data.\nAlternatively backup every thing and try to migrate from wubi to partition following this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MigrateWubi .\nIt involves \n\n\n*\n\n*booting from Live CD and manually creating the partitions where\nUbuntu will go to\n\n*booting from wubi installation and...\n\n*downloading and running the script wubi-move-2.2.sh\n\n*Make sure migration was successful and you can boot both Windows and\nUbuntu from respective partitions\n\n*Copy the data from Windows partition to Ubuntu partition\n\n\nAfter this you will need to remove Windows and reclaim that hard drive space. See How do I remove Windows but keep Ubuntu? for details:\n\n\n*booting from Live CD use gparted to delete windows partitions and\nreorganize Ubuntu partition (move, resize etc.)\n\n\nAs I said before, it may be easier to backup, re-install from scratch, and restore.\n\nA: The quickest way is to use an external drive to backup all your data on a liveCD environment, after that use gparted to remove the windows partition and then move and resize ubuntu partition.\nIt'll take a LOT of time.\nAfter everything is done type sudo blkid and the result will be something like this:\nfoo@bar:~$ sudo blkid\n/dev/sda1: LABEL=\"Ubuntu\" UUID=\"09e10b4a-9b98-4e9c-99b5-2e7024d9bd75\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda2: UUID=\"f9ca4a48-e7ed-4413-8877-fc3e0dfb0111\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n/dev/sda3: UUID=\"42D2CEE6D2CEDD73\" TYPE=\"ntfs\"\n\ncopy your ubuntu partition UUID then update /etc/fstab with your new UUID\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a\n# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices\n# that works even if disks are added and removed.

I come back in the morning and it won't wake back up. It seems like I can put it to sleep for less than 2 hours. After that, I'll have to do a hard reboot to do anything. It doesn't seem to happen If I have VLC running. Any advice?\nrunning 12.04 w/ Gnome 3.\n\nA: There are two possible modes when you put your computer to sleep:\n\n\n*\n\n*Suspending aka \"Suspend To RAM\": Memory is kept in RAM, a small amount of power is still used, wake up time is short \n\n*Hibernating aka \"Suspend To Disk\": Memory is dumped to the harddisk, no power is used, longer wake up time\n\n\nI suspect by closing the lid you put your computer into suspend mode. If it is only running  on battery, it gets drained after a while and the contents of the memory are lost, so you have to do a normal reboot.\nAdditional info:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/hardware/C/pm-suspending.html\n", "Q: Shortcut to Move Tabs in Firefox I'm wondering how to move the focused tab around, to right or left, using a keyboard shortcut in 12.04?\nAfter a Google search I found the shortcut Ctrl + (L/R)Arrows, but it seems to work only in Windows, not in Ubuntu.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: \nDefine your own shortcuts to move the tabs into Firefox.  You can move\n  the tabs along the tab bar and at both ends.1\n\nThat can be done with an add-on, that allows you to define your own shortcuts to move the tabs into Firefox.  Click on the link, to install this Add-On.  Once installed, restart Firefox, go into add-on, and click on Preferences, to set the shortcuts.  Close the window, and you're set.  \n\nNotice that the Move tab is the last one, and in the second image it moved to the first tab.\n\n1Source:Mozilla Add-ons\n\nA: Firefox 19 added shortcuts to move tabs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl+Shift+PgUp to move left, and\n\n*Ctrl+Shift+PgDn to move right.\n\n\nThe change is recorded as bug #364845; here is the specific commit that added the shortcuts.\nTherefore, the Move Tabs extension is no longer required; in fact, if you have it installed you should disable it (or else the shortcut will move the tab twice).\nHowever, there is still no built-in shortcut to move the current tab to the start or end. If you need those shortcuts, keep the extension and in its preferences set the left/right shortcuts to something you don't use.\n\nA: This extension for Firefox claims to move the focused tab forwards and backwards, respectively, with Ctrl+Shift+Page Up and Ctrl+Shift+Page Down. \nMoving the focused tab to the start or end, respectively, can be done with Ctrl+Shift+Home and Ctrl+Shift+End\nMozilla Support says that Ctrl+Up Arrow or Ctrl+Left Arrow moves the focused tab left and similarly for right. This, however, did not work for me (Firefox 14.0.1, Ubuntu 12.04LTS).\n\nA: In Firefox 35 I can cycle through tabs by ctrl + tab and ctrl + shift + tab.\nctrl + pgup/pgdown move the tab which is kinda cool for organization.\n\nA: Firefox on Dell XPS 15, Ubuntu 18: Ctrl-Fn-PgUp/PgDn\n\nA: According to the relevant part of Mozilla's official list of keyboard shortcuts:\nMove tab in focus left:     Ctrl + Shift + PgUp\nMove tab in focus right:    Ctrl + Shift + PgDn     \nMove tab in focus to start: Ctrl + Home     \nMove tab in focus to end:   Ctrl + End\n\n", "Q: The performance governor for cpufreq doesn't seem to behave as advertised The kernel in use: 3.2.0-23-generic on Ubuntu 12.04LTS\nFor example, I issue the following command:\nsudo cpufreq-set -c 0 -g performance\n\nThen I go to /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq and type in the following:\nsudo cat cpuinfo_cur_freq\n\nSometimes I get the max frequency (3600 MHz) when I do this and sometimes I get the min frequency (1600 MHz).\nIf I do:\ncat scaling_governor\n\nThe output is performance, showing that the governor is in fact set to performance.\nThen, to make it even more weird, if I do:\ncpufreq-info\n\nI get:\nanalyzing CPU 0:\n  driver: acpi-cpufreq\n  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 0 1 2 3 8 9 10 11\n  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 0\n  maximum transition latency: 10.0 us.\n  hardware limits: 1.60 GHz - 3.60 GHz\n  available frequency steps: 3.60 GHz, 3.60 GHz, 3.47 GHz, 3.33 GHz, 3.20 GHz, 3.07 GHz, 2.93 GHz, 2.80 GHz, 2.67 GHz, 2.53 GHz, 2.40 GHz, 2.27 GHz, 2.13 GHz, 2.00 GHz, 1.87 GHz, 1.73 GHz, 1.60 GHz\n  available cpufreq governors: conservative, ondemand, userspace, powersave, performance\n  current policy: frequency should be within 3.60 GHz and 3.60 GHz.\n                  The governor \"performance\" may decide which speed to use\n                  within this range.\n  current CPU frequency is 3.60 GHz.\n...\n\nIf you look at the current policy above, you will notice that it is telling me that the CPU should be pegged at 3.60 GHz. Yet, cpuinfo_cur_freq seems to tell a different story.\n\nA: Sadly, in 12.04, the cpufreqd-deamon overrides any setting you do in other apps, whether in cpufreq-cli or in Unity-applet.  The easiest solution I found while browsing the Ubuntu documentation was to edit /etc/cpufreqd.conf and first add a profile called On Demand as follows:\n[Profile]\nname=On Demand\nminfreq=10%\nmaxfreq=100%\npolicy=ondemand\n[/Profile]\n\nThen you need to scroll down past #basic states, and choose the new On Demand profile as the profile for all the Basic states.\nThe current problem is that cpufreqd polls acpi for AC state, notices that the AC is connected, and then sets the cpu governor to performance, because that is what is set in the basic rules in the config file. It couldn't care less that you have selected another governor either by command line or by the scaling applet in Unity.\nRemember to run \nsudo service cpufreqd restart\n\nafter editing the config file.\nFun fact: cpufreqd seems to NOT override me if I choose the performance governor in the unity applet. But before I edited the config file, it would always override my choice for on-demand, and fall back to performance. I have no idea why.\nI use the powernow-k8 driver, if that means anything to anyone reading this answer later.\nNote: The Ubuntu documentation is severely lacking concerning cpufreqd (as well) and there might well be a better/easier/GUI-solution to the problem.\n\nA: If you are seeing the CPU frequency drop down temporarily it may be because the CPU is reaching a thermal limit and being scaled down until the temperature drops. Just a guess.\n", "Q: Flash doesn't work with Fogger I recently installed Fogger but it isn't using flash plugin.

Maybe your hardware may not be fully capable of supporting the os as it is. Consider using free -m and include the output in your question.\nAlso, even if you perform a clean install of the OS, it tends to get somehow bloated for the average user.

I had a similar problem (with a different laptop) and was lucky and managed to set them The information you want is probably here at the Ubuntu help pages, but this is a run-through of what I did thanks in part to that help page.\nBefore pressing the keys open up gnome-system-log or run\ntail -f /var/log/kern.log\n\nWhen you press the keys, the kernel should give an indication if they are recognised and will report something like the keys are not set and so give you a scancode:\nUse 'setkeycodes e074 <keycode>' to make it known\n\nNow check your free keycodes that you can associate it with by entering \nsudo dumpkeys | grep ^keycode\n\nUsually it's best to use a high number so as not to mess up any existing keycodes. To temporarily set the key use the value the kernel gave you and a high keycode value such as 131:\nsudo setkeycodes e074 131 \n\nNow, if you are lucky a keysym will have automatically been assigned and you will now be able to use the button (for this session) and it will be available to set in your keyboard shortcuts program.\nTo make the setting permanent and so it sets it every time you reboot, add the entry to /etc/rc.local before the exit 0. Use sudo nano -w /etc/rc.local and add, for example,\nsetkeycodes e074 131\n\nReplace my examples with your own settings at all stages in the above process.\nIf the keysym has not been set, you need to go through the process detailed at the Ubuntu help page. It is quite a long process so I can't repeat it all here, but the section begins at 3.

Everyone's saying I need to forward ports.  I did forward ports 80 and 22 through my router to my server, but it's not working.  I also contacted my ISP, and they said that they didn't know of any ISP restrictions on ports.  So, yes.  I think I set it up, but it's still not working.  Also, I completely bypassed my router, and connected my server directly to the modem, which does NOT have an internal router, and the problem was still there.  Since somebody upvoted this question, I can now post my pic :)\n\nA: You need to forward a port used by SSH (22) on your router so all traffic coming on that port from outside is redirected to your Ubuntu machine.\nSee this article: http://www.howtogeek.com/66214/how-to-forward-ports-on-your-router/ or search for \"forward port router\".\nOnce you have port forwarding correctly configured, you'll be able to use your external IP address, or any DNS name configured to point to that IP address, to connect to your Ubuntu box from outside. The IP is the most robust way to do this. So, in your case, you need to replace (host) in (user)@(host) with your external IP address.\nAlso, as I said, getting proxy errors suggests that there's a proxy in the middle, which shouldn't be there. Which suggests that something is mis-configured.\n\nA: Ok.  To answer my original, official question,  refers to  the external IP address (ISP provided), and   refers to the internal IP address.  There is no extra punctuation necessary, and you do not need to include the internal IP address when entering , as that should be setup through port forwarding.  \nNow, the solution to my problem was not really a solution, but several solutions.  It turns out that my configuration of my ROUTER was correct, and as determined in a previous question, we knew that my SERVER firewall was configured properly because I was able to access my home page and my server through  ssh while on the LOCAL network.  The big problem was with my MODEM; I had already set up a sort of port forwarding in my modem, but it was not configured properly to route  to my router.  Also, I had to make my modem's firewall accept WAN to LAN communication.  In addition to updating these settings, which still needed to be done, I am sorry to admit that I switched the locations of two numbers in my external IP address.  \nAll that said,  I really appreciate everyone's participation, as your comments helped me to find the modem configuration, which ultimately lead me to the correction of my erroneous IP address, and the multiple necessary solutions to my problem, which has been plaguing me for three days now...\n\nA: http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/H/host.html\nIn short, it refers to the computer.  Host is usually used in the context of networking.\n\nA: SSH server binds to certain network interfaces (which usually refer to network cards in a computer).\nSo, checkout you /etc/sshd_config for\nPort 22\n#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0\n\nThe port should be 22 and ListenAddress should be commented out. \nThe second step I would take is to ckeck if you can connect to your ssh server through the interface your system is conected to the router.\nPost here the output of ifconfig iа you don't know how to do that and I'll help you.\nps\nalso is there any firewall enabled in your system?\n\nA: From other answers and comments, I think your ip forward problem looks solved so coming back to the original question about host and localhost: yes, in this case, host is your external IP. Usually, host means any host (ip or hostname or url), internal or external depending on the situation and localhost is not any internal IP but the IP of the machine you are working on (lo interface - IP 127.0.0.1) and provided you have something like 127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost (or only localhost as is the default) in /etc/hosts you can let it as localhost without substitution.\nFor example you can:\nping localhost and 127.0.0.1 (your machine loopback interface - lo) should answer.\n", "Q: can't remove gnome-shell and gnome-shell-extensions The problem is that I can't remove the gnome-shell and gnome-shell-extensions.

I got really sick and tired of Windows 7 and the new Windows 8 isn't something I really look out to and Ubuntu is really awesome so far. \nBut! Since I'm really dependent on Photoshop and Autocad and I cannot really replace them, I need Windows. \nSo, my question is:\nIf I format my drives (do I have to format all of them to ext partitions?)\nWill I still have an option to share them with my Windows XP on VirtualBox?\nI will need this to work. No, qCAD and Gimp isn't enough, unfortunately. I need those expensive programs.\n\nA: Yes. In Virtual Box you can share any directory on your Linux native system; it will be seen by the Windows guest as a network share.\nNo need for NTFS, then. I use this setup to run MS Office.\nHowever, before you dump Windows in favor of a Windows guest within an Ubuntu host, first make sure that the experience is as good as in native Windows. I have a very good experience with MS Office (in my view, it runs smoother and quicker in Windows guest in Ubuntu than the native Ubuntu LibreOffice), but YMMV. Also, it needs enough RAM (1 GB was definitely not sufficient).\nI strongly advise to first install Ubuntu on a second partition, side by side with Windows, install Virtualbox, Windows and your programs, and try to work with that for a while. Then you will see whether this setup works. If not, you will be able to go back to Windows.\n\nA: GParted can shrink and increase partitions. While there's some risk with this, I've not had any issues on the two-three times I have done so. \nIf you're going to be reformatting your entire drive, I'd try keeping your NTFS partition, mount, copy over everything. If you want to remove the NTFS partition after this, delete the partition, and resize your Linux partition. \nVirtualBox allows only 128MB of video memory allocation, while I believe VMware allows whatever. If you go with VMware, be sure to use 4.0.2 for now.\nI can't for sure verify if VMware (and thus, most likely, VirtualBox) can share from host Linux > Virtual XP > NTFS partition, but as a guesstimate, it should work as long as the partition is mounted.\n", "Q: How can I open irc:// links in Pidgin from Chromium?

From a program on this remote computer, I need to execute a command on my local computer (the connection initiator).\nWhich raises the question: is it possible to leech onto the existing connection between the two computers to run a command on the local computer? \nI have considered running the command ssh user@host-of-connecting-party <command> on the remote computer to establish a reversed connection. But this is harder to automate and will require user intervention. I was hoping I could fully automate it, or at least detect the user/hostname of the connected user.\n\nA: I'm having a similar need sometimes, as long as I connect over Putty to our VPN server and from there over ssh to some other host, which is not reachable for me directly due to VPN setup. \nSometimes I just need to quickly check something on a VPN server machine, while still having my \"ssh-session\" running. One approach is to run a ssh session under screen, which, as I've noticed, add some delay in comparison with \"regular ssh\". Another approach, which I'd like to share here, is the following:\nWhile under SSH session, Press Enter, then ~, (make sure it's not displayed, i.e. you're in a command mode), then Ctrl-Z. This will put the ssh client process on a \"host\" to background, and you'll something along the lines of: \n[root@client170 ~]# ~^Z [suspend ssh]\n\n[1]+  Stopped                 ssh root@10.0.0.167\n[root@vps291736 ~]#\n\nNow you're on the \"host\", can do whatever you want (although, I am not sure how long ssh session will be kept alive), and then return to SSH session by running fg.\nAt least, this works for me while I am connected from a Win10 workstation via Putty on a CentOS-based VM, and from that VM connect over SSH to some other host. \nHope it helps someone!\n\nA: @62mkv's answer is a much better solution. Use that.\nFor completeness and curiosity though, if you have an ssh server running on your local machine, you could create an ssh tunnel to allow ssh connections from the remote host on port 20202 back to the local one on port 22. Example command:\nssh -R20202:localhost:22 remoteuser@remotehost.com\n\nThis will start an ssh connection, but also set up a tunnel back to the ssh server running on your machine. Then you can do this, when ssh'ed into the remote host:\nssh -p 20202 localuser@localhost\n\nOf course, this can quickly get confusing - especially if the technique is nested more than once. It adds a bit of latency, too - since everything you execute on your local machine is bounced through the remote host.\nAdditional information about ssh tunneling for those whose curiosity hasn't been satisfied yet can be found in answer to this unix stackexchange question.\n\nA: If both your local and remote computer are accessible from Internet, you can just open an SSH session from your local computer on the remote computer, and then in that session open another ssh session from the remote computer on the local computer:\nlocaluser@local> ssh remoteuser@remote\nPassword:\nremoteuser@remote> hostname\nremote\nremoteuser@remote> ssh localuser@local\nPassword:\nlocaluser@local> hostname\nlocal\nlocaluser@local> exit\nremoteuser@remote> exit\nlocaluser@local>\n\nFor automating stuff have a look at Fabric (Python knowledge required)\nfrom fabric.api import *\n\n@hosts('host1')\ndef clean_and_upload():\n    local('find assets/ -name \"*.DS_Store\" -exec rm '{}' \\;')\n    local('tar czf /tmp/assets.tgz assets/')\n    put('/tmp/assets.tgz', '/tmp/assets.tgz')\n    with cd('/var/www/myapp/'):\n        run('tar xzf /tmp/assets.tgz')\n\n\nA: You can use sshpass to connect to the the remote computer and run the commands.\n./sshpass -p \"password\" ssh user@remoteIP 'bash -s < EOI \"Your Commands go here\" EOI'\n\nUse simple shell script on local computer and use above code whenever you want to run commands on remote computer. This is one of the way i generally used in automation.\n\nA: No, you can't break into the existing session.\nYour application would need a way to connect back to the client. SSH would work if the client has an SSH server running and the server can reach port 22 on the client. It wouldn't be hard to automate if you used key-based authentication instead of password authentication - this way user intervention would not be necessary.\nInformation on setting up key based authentication can be found here: http://tombuntu.com/index.php/2008/02/20/public-key-authentication-for-ssh-made-easy/\n\nA: If you have access to another terminal, you can send SIGSTOP using \"kill -19 PID\" to the ssh command that initiated the conection.\nYou will then get control of terminal on the terminal on the client machine.\nOnce you have finished, you can restore ssh connection by simply typing fg to wake up ssh client.\nBut of course the question here is : if you already have a terminal on the client machine why would you do this :)\n", "Q: NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/derby/tools/ij Derby says to install to opt, so I did:\nthufir@dur:~$ \nthufir@dur:~$ ll /opt/db-derby-10.9.1.0-bin/lib/derbytools.jar \n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 174932 May 31 12:19 /opt/db-derby-10.9.1.0-bin/lib/derbytools.jar\nthufir@dur:~$ \nthufir@dur:~$ ll /opt/db-derby-10.9.1.0-bin/bin/ij\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 5876 May 31 12:18 /opt/db-derby-10.9.1.0-bin/bin/ij*\nthufir@dur:~$ \n\nNow, do what value do I set for /etc/environment?\nthufir@dur:~$ \nthufir@dur:~$ cat /etc/environment \nPATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games\"\nJAVA_HOME=\"/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-i386/jre/\"\n\ndo I call the env variable DERBY_INSTALL?

If you want to go to a specific folder you type cd Downloads/subfolder/folder2/.\nIf you're in another folder that isn't inside your Home folder structure but want to go to a folder inside of it (Home) you add this character ~ so it's something like this: \nuser@user-desktop:etc/$ cd ~/Downloads/subFolder/folder2/\nuser@user-desktop:~/Downloads/subFolder/folder2/$ \nThat will take you directly to a folder inside your Home structure because of the ~.\nTo return to your Home you just type cd.

Now I want to uninstall rEFIt, in order to avoid going over the boot options twice. The boot options are displayed via rEFIt and GRUB in that order. However to do so, I must be able to boot into Mac OS X via grub. At the moment this is not happening. I read somewhere that this requires chainloading. Could someone direct me to get this right?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Something like the following GRUB 2 configuration might work:\nmenuentry \"OS X\" {\n    insmod hfsplus\n    set root='(hd0,gpt3)'\n    chainloader /System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi\n}\n\nNote that you may need to change the partition number from \"gpt3\" to something else, such as \"gpt2\" or \"gpt4\". You want to identify the partition on which OS X is installed and use its partition number. To use this example, copy it to your /etc/grub.d/40_custom file in Linux and then type sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg. I make no promises that this will work, though; I've not tested it.\nAnother option is to replace rEFIt with rEFInd and forego GRUB 2 in favor of a Linux 3.3.0 or later kernel with EFI stub loader support. Unfortunately, Ubuntu 12.04 shipped with a 3.2.0 kernel, so you'll need to replace your kernel (or wait for Ubuntu 12.10) to do this.

I'm dual booting with Windows 7, and I have a NTFS partition for storage. When I save files to the storage partition in Ubuntu and reboot into Windows, I can't see the files and Windows doesn't recognize that the space is being used (it showed the same amount of free space left in the partition as before saving the files). Moreover, when I reboot back into Ubuntu, I'm unable to see those files either, but the amount of free space left in the drive is as if the files that I initially saved are still there. There's no problem with viewing files that I put into that partition from Windows.\nI followed the instructions on http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/35807/how-to-harmonize-your-dual-boot-setup-for-windows-and-ubuntu/ to set up the storage partition. Some help with how to get at those files (from both windows and ubuntu) would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: This most likely is because you hibernate Windows before booting into Ubuntu - Windows stores some information about filesystem in memory and when you boot back into Windows after hibernation that information is restored from the hibernation image, making the actual state of the filesystem and what Windows thinks of it to go out of sync. Then, when Windows flushes its disk caches, it overrides changes so your files disappear.\nThis is a potentially dangerous situation which can lead to data loss and possibly filesystem corruption. You need to make sure Windows is shut down properly (not hibernated) before booting into another OS.\nThis answer provides some details: https://askubuntu.com/a/145904/14564\nIn your case, I suspect, Ubuntu does not complain because it is a storage disk, not Windows system disk, so there is no hibernation image on it, so Ubuntu has no way of knowing Windows is hibernated.\nI hope you have copies of the files which disappeard from the storage partition as they're likely to be gone.\n", "Q: Can't install Wine on 12.04 x64 I can't get Wine to install, it keeps say there are unmet dependencies.\nsudo apt-get install wine\nReading package lists...

I can now execute it through terminal command:\n./filename.exe (execution)\n\nI have laptop. It has Ubuntu 11.04. I store files in NTFS partition. These sequence of commands works well in my laptop. But if same file I copy in my desktop's NTFS partition, which is Ubuntu 12.04 and then runs then it doesn't work. It compiles but doesn't executes. I am getting the answer:\nbash: ./filename.exe: Permission denied\n\nI searched in internet. They suggested that you can change the permission of file by below command:\nchmod u+x filename.exe\n\nBut I got same answer: Permission denied. I tried manually through GUI through property --> permission --> checking \"allow executing file as program\" and that is not working. It uncheckes automatically. I searched in the internet and I got answer that it is not advisable to change permission for every file each and every time of execution. better you can change permission of entire NTFS partition by following command:\nchmod -R 777 /media/partition (where partition is NTFS type.)\n\nThis is supposed to change the partition permission to rw and executable mode. But this is also not solving my problem.\n\nA: As other already mentioned, the problem is caused by using NTFS, which does not support Unix-style permissions.\nA workaround would be to mount the partition so ALL the files on it have execute bit set. This might fix your immediate problem but may break again when compiling more complex programs. It may also be a security risk.\nA proper solutions would be not to use an NTFS partition to compile programs :)\n\nA: There are likely some settings in how you mount the NTFS partition that denies you the right to execute files on it.  You should be able to fix this by editing the options in your /etc/fstab.  See this thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1378519 .\n\nA: The problem is that you are using ntfs which does not have the execute permission.

The other file that you want to remove is wine-extension-jfif.desktop, and then no wine options will appear when you right click a jpeg or a jpg. \nIf you take a look at the w3 standards page, you can see that jpeg jfif is known as the JPEG File Interchange Format; it is known as a progressive jpeg that is heavily compressed. Much more information and technical specifications is available in the official jfif pdf.\nIf you want other image extensions not to appear in the context menu as well, remove also wine-extension-gif.desktop and wine-extension-png.desktop from ~/.local/share/applications. You can easily reassociate a wine program as an option with which to open these filetypes through the 'open with' dialogue or set as default via, for example, mimeopen -d mypicture.jpeg. Although very few users probably use wine programs to view images or edit them when excellent native Linux based programs are available. \n\nA: Look in ~/.local/share/applications/, possibly delete all files that seem related to the applications involved, especially mimeinfo.cache. \n", "Q: Do I need to reinstall my 12.04 desktop to get 12.04.1, which was released today? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat's the deal with point releases in LTS versions? \n\nThe first LTS I ever installed was this latest one.

If that works, maybe cheese settings are at fault.\n\n*more options\n"]
