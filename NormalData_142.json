["Q: Ubuntu 12.10 UEFI Installation with Windows 8 acer apsire I'm trying to install Ubuntu 12.10 on my Acer Aspire at work.  I need to keep the original Windows 8 and would like to have Ubuntu running alongside it.  So far I've only been able to get the Ubuntu live to boot when in legacy mode, which doesn't work with my UEFI Windows 8.  \nI've tried disabling and enabling secure boot as well, but it doesn't appear to change much.  I've tried using the secure-remix as well, but it doesn't appear to recognize the disk (problem with the iso maybe?).  \nAfter looking around I've yet to find anything that helps me get Ubuntu running on this machine.  I don't want to install ubuntu in legacy mode for fear of destroying Windows 8.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: If you can boot the installer in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, you could try a BIOS-mode installation. That will leave you with a mixed-mode setup, though -- with Windows booting in EFI mode and Ubuntu in BIOS mode. This is likely to be awkward, since you'll need to use the firmware's built-in boot manager to select the boot mode, at least initially. There are ways to make it work:\n\n\n*\n\n*You could install rEFInd, edit its refind.conf file to uncomment the scanfor line, and add hdbios to that line. This will enable rEFInd to boot a BIOS-mode boot loader on at least some systems. This isn't guaranteed to work, but if it does, you'll then be able to boot the computer in EFI mode, which will launch rEFInd, from which you'll be able to launch Windows or a generic entry for GRUB. The latter will launch Ubuntu in BIOS mode.\n\n*You could install any EFI-mode boot loader for Linux you like. When you boot in EFI mode, this will then enable you to boot Linux, and some (such as GRUB and rEFInd) will enable you to boot Windows, too. Given your current problem, though, this might not work at all. Note that rEFInd is one possible EFI-mode boot manager, so you can use it for the preceding method and then try a more direct boot using rEFInd, too. To get it to boot Ubuntu directly, you'll need to add a filesystem driver so that it can read your kernel and create a /boot/refind_linux.conf file. (This is all described in the rEFInd documentation.)\n\n*You could convert Windows to boot in BIOS mode. This is likely to be quite awkward, though; you'll need to convert from GPT to MBR partitions and then either re-install Windows or jump through some poorly-documented hoops to switch Windows to use a BIOS-mode boot loader.\n\n\nAll of this assumes a successful BIOS-mode Linux installation. It's entirely possible that you're running into a hardware problem (hardware that lacks a Linux driver), in which case your only hope for installing Linux is to dig up a new driver and patch the installer with it or to wait until such a driver makes it into a future version of Ubuntu (or some other distribution).\n", "Q: Dead keyboard when entering password I lost all icon from my desktop. When I use the terminal I am able to enter the commands but the keyboard goes dead when ask for my password. The only key that works is the enter key and after 3 enters it starts over and the keyboard starts to work.  Help, I'm new to Ubuntu and I really like it but been having problem since I upgraded.\n\nA: In Ubuntu, when a terminal request a password, you can press all the keys that you want to but the terminal will not show any character in the password field (neither those popular dots). \nSo it is a normal behavior.\nIf you still can't connect, you should check the keys that you're pressing.\nI left the next screen-shoot, to have a reference:\n\n", "Q: Why the sound stopped working?

I found that the only problem is file name of generated index. It should end up with .gz extension. Previously Packages was acceptable for dpkg now he expects Packages.gz. This is a new rule, meanwhile, someone in debian team decided it to be like this! I updated my local repo generator script and everything works file now.\n", "Q: What driver should I choose for my graphics card? Which one should I select? Preferably without breaking my system.\nThe last time I tried to install drivers, it totally messed up my system and I had to reinstall Ubuntu (which I just finished) and I would like to try an avoid the same mistake, but I am not sure which one I had installed the last time.\n\n\nA: Well, this probably isn't the answer you expected... my apologies.\nThe only \"real\" way to find out what driver will work with your card/system is to ask someone with real experience with your specific card.  Google didn't help me much with your card..  \nSo lets go break your system shall we ;D   \n\nFirst we need to provide a failsafe in case we break your ability to run Unity.  I usually just install Gnome Flashback so I can tinker with graphics drivers without using any of them.  \nsudo apt-get install gnome-session-flashback  \n\nYou should then  be able to log into \"Gnome Flashback\" from the login screen, but I recommend using \"Gnome Flashback (No effects)\" as it doesn't use Compiz at all.  \n \n\n\n*\n\n*Now we are ready to test your drivers.  Go ahead and select one and apply it.  I'd start with the tested and stable ones first.  \n\n*Reboot and try logging into Unity and see if it works..  Try your games, make sure the graphics meet what you want.  I recommend writing down which driver you tried and how it worked; it won't help to forget later ;)  \n\n*If a certain driver doesn't work; log out of Unity (Or if you can't, press Ctrl+Alt+F1 login and run sudo reboot) and log into \"Gnome Flashback (No effects)\" and remove the driver.  You'll find additional drivers in the software center under Edit -> Software Sources in the \"Additional Drivers\" tab.  \n\n*Repeat, starting from step one until you get a driver that pleases you.  If you don't find one.. well... I don't think there's anything you can do about it..  \nThis is the method I use to find a good driver.  It has always worked for me.\nGood luck!\n\nA: If you have an Nvidia or an AMD card, you should install the 'normal' driver (the ones without 'experimental' in its name. I would go with the first option, as it is also tested by the Ubuntu team.\nAlso, if everything works fine as it is, don't install the proprietary drivers, as it's not worth it to break Plymouth (or other stuff) just for having a graphic settings tool for your graphics card.\nJust a quick piece of advice, your boot screen will get messed up anyway when using Nvidia drivers, so you can 'repair' that problem by following this link, as it was written for Ubuntu 10.04, the solution still works even in 13.04 (tested by me).\n\nA: Definitely do not go with the Experimental ones (sixth and second), experiments often break stuff (your OS in this case.)\nMy best guess is to go with the Open Source one as it might be less buggy because of the fact of Linus' Law, \"Many eyes make shallow bugs.\" :D Anyways, even though the Nvidia driver says tested, it often creates graphics issues, especially during boot-up.\nBest of luck!\n\nA: Its safest to keep on using the nouveau open source driver, its the driver you use to generate this screen-shot and it is the only driver that is possible to support by the Ubuntu developers. The Nouveau driver will have the best Ubuntu integration in the long run.\n", "Q: How to fast convert mp4 to webm using ffmpeg? I have to convert 76 mp4 files to webm for the purpose of a website that uses HTML5 videos. I'm talking about 10 Gb of mp4 files...\nI know I can simply ask ffmpeg to do that using:\nffmpeg -i input_file.mp4 output_file.webm\n\nOf course I'll do it recursively by:\nfind ./ -name '*.mp4' -exec bash -c 'ffmpeg -i \"$0\" \"${0%%.mp4}.webm\"' {} \\;\n\nI even tried something I found somewhere on the internet:\nffmpeg -i input_file.mp4 -cpu-used 4 -threads 8 output_file.webm\n\nBut the thing is that it won't take me less than a week!!!\nWhat am I doing wrong? Is there any possible way to speed that up? If I convert to ogg will I gain on speed?\nPlease help!!!\n\nA: Transcoding video takes time.  It also takes a lot more knowledge about encoding parameters; ffmpeg's defaults are unlikely to be suitable for you and may not even create a usable output file.\nHere's a start:\nEncoding webm using ffmpeg (Archived)\nThose settings will encode to a particular average bitrate (video bitrate of 3900kbit), so there will be spikes in the bitrate.\nMP4 and WebM use different video codecs, so there is no short-cut; video must be transcoded.\nEncoding speed, of course, will vary immensely depending on the frame size, frame rate, and quality settings.  For a 720p encode you might expect to be able to encode roughly 1:1 (ie 10 hours of video in 10 hours) on a CPU from the last couple of years.  If you do two-pass ABR encoding like in the example given in the link, almost double that.\n\nA: Double that or half cut that? So it's a dead end.. I won't be playing with bitrates, I never know what to expect from quality or size.. I think I'll stick to this one and make the client hold on till conversion is over..\nfind ./ -name '*.mp4' -exec bash -c 'ffmpeg -i \"$0\" -vcodec libvpx -acodec libvorbis -cpu-used 5 -threads 8 \"${0%%.mp4}.webm\"' {} \\;\n\nI'm posting it for future users, actually I gained on speed but my CPU is working like hell: 60 to 80% on each core!\nNow I think it will take less time: 3 days instead of 6 or 7..\nI hope it won't break it down.. ^_^\nThank you anyway man!\nEdit: Removed the switch -sameq after comments from LordNeckbeard and neon_overload\n-sameq does not mean same \"quality\"\n\nA: I use optimizeVideo, which automatically detects the conversion settings that have the best speed vs quality balance according to Google.\n\n", "Q: Integration of archives navigation in nautilus Would there be a tool to integrate the navigation in the content of an archive in Nautilus, instead of using Archive Manager?\n\nA: This won't let you open archives seamlessly within the same instance of nautilus, but will allow you to open a zip file in a second, new instance of nautilus via a script (to be placed in ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts and made executable).\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# see: https://askubuntu.com/a/295312/480880\nurlencode() {\n    # urlencode <string>\n    local length=\"${#1}\"\n    for (( i = 0; i < length; i++ )); do\n        local c=\"${1:i:1}\"\n        case $c in\n            [a-zA-Z0-9.~_-]) printf \"$c\" ;;\n            *) printf '%%%02X' \"'$c\"\n        esac\n    done\n}\n\n# taken from xdg-mime;\n# xdg-mime itself is not used, as it's slow and we're already assuming presence of gvfs utils anyway\nmime_type() {\n    gvfs-info \"$1\" 2> /dev/null | grep standard::content-type | cut -d' ' -f4\n}\n\necho \"$NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_URIS\" | while read uri\ndo\n    mime_type=\"$(mime_type \"$uri\" )\"\n    if [ \"$mime_type\" = \"application/zip\" ] # add mime-types as necessary\n    then\n    archive_path=\"archive://$(urlencode \"$uri\" )\"\n    gvfs-mount \"$archive_path\"\n    gvfs_path=\"$( echo \"$archive_path\" | sed 's/%/%25/g')\" # yes, the percentage signs are encoded, again!\n    # zenity --entry --entry-text=\"$gvfs_path\"\n    nautilus \"$gvfs_path\"\n    fi\ndone\n\n\nA: I advise you to use Ark \nIt manages various archive formats, including tar, gzip, bzip2, rar and zip, as well as CD-ROM images.

First, run your script to set up the firewall rules.  Secondly, run sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent, and follow the prompts.  When it asks to save the current rules, hit \"Yes\" at both prompts.  Now, on reboots, your iptables rules will be restored.\n\nNOTE: If you change your rules after this, you will need to do the following command(s) after the changes:\nTo save your IPv4 iptables rules: sudo su -c 'iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4'\nTo save your IPv6 ip6tables rules: sudo su -c 'ip6tables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v6' \n\nA: Assuming you have the firewall rules in:\n/etc/iptables.up.rules\n\nPerhaps the most obvious answer will be to create a file called iptables in:\n/etc/network/if-pre-up.d\n\nwith the content:\n#!/bin/bash\n/sbin/iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.up.rules\n\nand make it executable using\nsudo chmod +x /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/iptables\n\nThis way before your network interface is activated your rules will be loaded.\n", "Q: No additional driver listed I can't find any additional driver listed in my ubuntu 12.10.

A big file can be downloaded by using wget. First start download, then kill wget, then resume download by wget -c.\nI want to pause downloads too many times depending on events such as power failure, Network unavailability, etc... and want to automate it using a script. So pressing Ctrl+C is't an option. I know a process can be paused by kill -STOP \"$pid\" The pausing should not close the connection to the website, either it should wait for resume command or the bandwidth throttled to very low use.   \nI found these commands using aria2c in aria2.sourceforge.net, but  I can't use it successfully. This uses RPC method. Can I use it in a script?\naria2.pause(gid) \n\nThis method pauses the download denoted by gid. gid is of type string. The status of paused download becomes paused. If the download is active, the download is placed on the first position of waiting queue. As long as the status is paused, the download is not started. To change status to waiting, use aria2.unpause() method. This method returns GID of paused download.   \n\naria2.unpause(gid)\n\nThis method changes the status of the download denoted by gid from paused to waiting. This makes the download eligible to restart. gid is of type string. This method returns GID of unpaused download.   \n\nQuestion\n\n\n*\n\n*How to pause (or throttle bandwidth) an already running download of aria\n\n*Is there a better down loader than aria to use in script\n\n*Wether  RPC method can be used in script\n\n\nA: For this to work your aria2 should support option pause. Search for  --pause[=true|false] in man aria2c. It works in aria2_1.12.0-1_i386 [oneric] (and later).   \nFirst start RPC server: aria2c --enable-rpc=true (For older ver. aria2c --enable-xml-rpc=true)\nThen use RPC using http://localhost:6800/jsonrpc\nThe following example adds http://example.org/file to aria2:\nIn a python console type the following\nJSON RPC\nimport urllib2, json\njsonreq = json.dumps({'jsonrpc':'2.0', 'id':'qwer',\n    'method':'aria2.addUri',\n    'params':[['http://example.org/file']]})\nc = urllib2.urlopen('http://localhost:6800/jsonrpc', jsonreq)\nc.read()\n'{\"id\":\"qwer\",\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"result\":\"2089b05ecca3d829\"}'\n\nThe following example pause download whose GID is \"3\":\nXML RPC\nimport xmlrpclib\ns = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy('http://localhost:6800/rpc')\ns.aria2.pause('3')\n\nIf you get somethin like below your version of aria2 doesn't support it.  \nxmlrpclib.Fault: <Fault 1: 'No such method: aria2.pause'\n\nIn version that use aria2c --enable-xml-rpc=true, other options can be used such as adiing files, etc. (using XML RPC).\n\n\nA: Simplest you can use Ctrl + C shortcut in terminal/konsole to pause the download. Internally it makes a temporary file in the same directory of extension .aria2, and when you try to redownload the file, it starts from the position it was made to pause. And don't use Ctrl + Z.\n", "Q: How can gain root access whilst logged into a normal account? I've set up an ubuntu computer for my sisters. There is the admin account which only I can access and there are two normal accounts.\nOccasionally I'm going to be called upon to install an extra program, check a setting or fix a problem. Instead of logging out and then logging into the admin account, it would be much easier if I could fix the problem from the terminal when I am handed the computer.\nFor example, I wanted to check the iptables policies whilst logged into the normal account.\nWhen I typed in sudo iptables -L -v\nI was not able to access that command since the normal user account I was logged in did not have privileges, and it gave a message saying that the incident would be reported.\nI logged back into the admin account, and added the user to the sudo group. \nWhen testing the iptables command again when logged in as the normal account, it only requested the normal user's password. I do not want this. For security measures, I would prefer that only the root password be used to execute these commands, especially when logged into the normal user account.\nHow can I execute commands requiring root privileges whilst logged into a non-admin account, and ensuring that only the root password can be used to execute those commands?\n\nA: You can login to sudo account from terminal and then execute the sudo command. Basically, open up a terminal and do \nsu - sudousername\nand then you can run sudo from terminal\nIf you need to to exit just do \nexit\n\nA: You can use '-c' option in su for that. \nEg. su -c 'iptables -L -v' sudoer_username\nRefer: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man1/su.1.html\n", "Q: How to delete nomodeset from my grub file in order to boot normally?

My typical usage involves logging into each machine via a putty session and executing a script using screen. \nAfter logging in via putty, I execute the following from the command line:\nscreen /home/user/\"script\"\nMy question is:\nIs there any way to get my script/program to run automatically after a reboot? I'm trying to prevent a loss of productivity in a power loss/automatic reboot situation.\n\nA: You can use cron to do this for you.\n\n\n*\n\n*Simply do crontab -e in terminal\n\n*It will open in your selected editor, where you can type\n@reboot <your command>\n(make sure you give full path for all executables)\n\n*Save the file and exit \nRef: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man5/crontab.5.html\n\nA: The official way to do this is by creating init scripts. These scripts have a start, stop, restart and status command and can be configured to run these commands at specific times.\nSo when you switch to leven 6 (reboot) it will stop the service before rebooting and if configured correctly it will automaticly run start on this script when switching to runlevel 3. You can find these scripts in /etc/init.d. If you create the file correctly (so it must be able to handle a start and a stop parameter) you can run update-rc.d script.sh defaults to set it to automaticly boot. Make sure you did chmod +x on the script first to make it executable. The folder /etc/init.d contains loads of examples of how this is done.\nThere is also the /etc/rc.local file, this file runs after the system has fully booted, and you can just add your own commands.\nPersonally I prefer the init.d scripts because you can make sure that the program closes gracefully, thus preventing possible dataloss or other errors. But for one command, or somethhing that can't really break /etc/rc.local will do just fine.\n\nA: Modify your script in such a way that it can be invoked as an init script or, better yet, an upstart job. With some luck, you can keep it pretty much as it is, and have it run at boot by simply adding an upstart configuration to /etc/init. (Take any small .conf file there as a template.)\nTwo things you'll need to be aware of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your script is invoked with root privileges. Drop them, so that your script runs with the appropriate user privileges (your user identity, in this case). Do this by invoking the final screen command in your script using su\nsu -c \"screen ...\" - username.\n\n*When started at boot, your script is run without a controlling terminal, whereas you currently run it from a shell. Since you use screen I assume you wish to re-attach to the terminal running script on your next login. If so, this may require passing extra options when you invoke screen.\n\nA: I have this in script to start rtorrent in a screen at boot time:\n#!/bin/sh\n\ncase $1 in\n     start)\n        su - johan -c \"screen -dm rtorrent\"\n       ;;\n     stop)\n        killall rtorrent\n        killall screen\n        ;;\nesac\nexit 0\n\nYou can combine this with Vishnus answer if you prefer crontab, <your command> = screen -dm /usr/home/\"script\".\n\nA: I tried all of the above, with no luck. The script I am running needs X to launch. \nWhat did ultimately work though it may have been the easy way out, was creating a small script called launch.sh in my home directory and adding it to the Ubuntu Startup applications list. \nlaunch.sh contained the following and executed my script from within: \n#!/bin/sh\nscreen -dmS 051 /home/{user}/{myscript} \n\nI discovered that the configuration file for the launch.sh startup application was contained in the file /home/{user}/.config/autostart/launch.sh.desktop and I was able to recreate both files in the same locations on my other boxes and recreate the success.

To learn more about how udisks works, see man 7 udisks.\nTo mount a device with udisks, you must specify a valid device name for the device. Specifying the device's volume name will not work. So, you can use udisks like this:\nudisks --mount /dev/sdb1\n\nWhen manually using udisks from the command-line, you might be best off to simply plug in a device, then run dmesg | tail shortly thereafter (see man dmesg and man tail) to discover the device name of the newly attached device.\nThis may not be the best way to write a script that mounts devices with udisks, however.

Can someone give me some criterias on how to select mounting points for ubuntu installation?\nAt the moment Windows 7 is my main OS on the pc and the 250GB hdd memory is allocated this way:\nC:/ -Win7 OS\nD:/ -Everything else(games,music,photos etc)\nOther partition Ext4 -ubuntu 12.04 LTS\n\nAnd now I want to make ubuntu as my primary OS but I don't know how to proper select mounting points to use it to my advantage.\nExample:\n1st partition Ext4 for ubuntu- that will be set on `/`\n2nd partition Ext4 for games,photos\n3rd partition NTFS for Windows 7\n4th partition NTFS for windows games.\n\nSo where to set my 2nd partition's mounting point to save my other things?\n/home\n\nor something else?\n\nA: The 2nd ext4 partition can be /home. It will contain your users' data such as photos and music, but it will not contain any Linux games. This is because Ubuntu has its own system of placing application or program files in special places within its system. There is no way to install games in `/home' or any other partitions or folders of your choice.  See Linux Filesystem Tree Overview for details. \nYou have three choices for the NTFS partitions:\nOne, Create two folders under /media such as /media/Win7 and /media/WinData and mount the partitions there. /media is where the partitions are mounted when you select them in the Nautilus. The advantage of mounting the Windows partitions in /media is that they remain available on the left panel of Nautilus as drive icons. However, if you don't want the Windows partitions to appear with drive icons in Nautilus, then consider option two below.\nTwo Create two folders under /mnt such as /mnt/Win7 and /mnt/WinData and mount the partitions there. If you do this, the partitions won't appear as special icons in Nautilus. Both these options are explained in more details at Mounting Windows Partitions.\nThree This is essentially the free for all option. For example, you may create two folders /Win7 and /WinData under / and mount the partitions there. \nIn terms of functionality in Nautilus, two and three are the same. Two may be preferred for historical reasons and keeping the / root less cluttered. In both cases you can create bookmarks in Nautilus to easily access the mount points.\nThere seems to be a debate about which of this three is right. See Why have both /mnt and /media? for some answers.\n", "Q: Mount a Win8 Phone as Share on Ubuntu 12.10 I'm trying to mount a Nokia 620 phone running Win8 on my Ubuntu 12.10 box.

I have all USB devices enabled for the virtual machine.\n\nA: I don't own any wp devices. So this answer goes in kind of assumption and internet research. Anyone wants to correct any information, please do so.\nWindows Phone 8 only Support MTP and has no Native Mass Storage Support. But you said, it is not even detected on Windows 8 , that is a bit confusing. \nHowever, since Windows phone uses MTP, so only we need update the MTP library.\nWhile searching on internet, I found out a blog that talks about it, and he can mount it. But on Mac . You can look here \nSo, for ubuntu, I would suggest to give a try to updated GVFS with MTP support. The article was written for Android 4.0+ devices which doesn't support Mass storage but only support MTP. You can have a look and instruction here. They talk about updating the MTP library.\nBut, interesting thing is, they have added a note on Feb 13, 2013. with a list of devices that are supported  in the unstable PPA.  And Lumia 920 is there. So it might be possible, it will be working with 620. If not you have to wait.\nSo I would suggest, \n\n\n*\n\n*add ppa ppa:langdalepl/gvfs-mtp & install all available update.\n\n*Reboot, unlock your device and connect. See if it is now on Nautilus. \n\n*If not, add this unstable ppa ppa:webupd8team/unstable & avail the updates. There should be one update, libmtp.

I know that there are many recipes/strategies for getting a \"minimal Ubuntu\", but they are too extreme for what I'm trying to do.  Still, I suspect that I have a ton of packages installed that I don't need, either directly or indirectly.\nHow can I go about finding out what I can delete?  At minimum I need to figure out, for every installed package, whether it is needed by any \"application\" I normally use.  (Of course, there are \"applications\" that I use normally without being aware of it, so this is easier said than done.)\n\nA: Both \"safe\" and \"minimal\" are very, very relative. It's impossible to answer this question precisely without being you.\nIf you want the bare bones installation, install Ubuntu Minimal and add  packages you need to that.\nIf you're just asking what you can remove without taking down the entire system, that's fairly easy to do with any of the beefier apt-frontends like aptitude and synaptic. Select a package for removal and the tool will tell you what else needs to go. If that doesn't work out for you, just revert that change.\nYou can remove the ubuntu-desktop package without toppling the system and you will likely need to in order to remove certain things.If you get stuck in a text-mode system, reinstalling that is the simplest route to recovery but it will undo all your work.\nAgain, building up is easier than tearing down... But it does require you to understand the stack you're working with.\nFor graphing, you can use something like this (requires graphviz and imagemagick to be installed):\napt-cache dotty ubuntu-minimal | dot -Tpng | display\n\nThe graphs are huge though.

This is even with ignoring the Ubuntu documentation's remedy for the error of alias aes aes_generic.\nIn comparison.

Once I have logged in then explicitly setting essid with iwconfig enables networking within a few seconds; nothing else needs to be done.\nWith SSID not hidden : system boots up quickly and networking is immediately up and running.\nIn summary, nothing to do with the specific adapter and nothing to do with the interfaces file.\nThanks to @chilli555 for taking the time to help.\n\nA: The usual way to configure a server is to fill in your details in the file /etc/network/interfaces. First, confirm you have a working wireless interface:\niwconfig\n\nDo you have an interface, ideally wlan0? Next confirm it is working as expected:\nsudo iwlist wlan0 scan\n\nDo you see your network, among others? If so, edit the file with the editor vim:\nsudo vim /etc/network/interfaces\n\nAdd your details so it looks something like:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet static  <--you want to be able to reach your server by ssh and ftp\naddress 192.168.1.100  <--an address outside the DHCP range in the router\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\ndns-nameservers 192.168.1.1 8.8.8.8\nwpa-ssid <your_network>\nwpa-psk <your_key>\n\nSave your changes and close vim with :wq. Now get the interface to see and use the new settings:\nsudo ifdown wlan0 && sudo ifup wlan0\n\nConfirm you got the new address:\nifconfig\n\nAnd that you can reach the internet:\nping -c3 www.google.com\n\nOf course, substitute your details above.\n", "Q: How Will App Permissions be Handled in Ubuntu Touch? Most elements of the hardware, or data sets shared between apps on the Android and iOS platform are controlled strongly, and only provided to apps explicitly on a need-to-know basis.  This can allow the user to make sure, for example, a malicious flashlight app isn't uploading their location and contacts list.\nOn the desktop on Ubuntu, there are effectively two permission levels of control: user, and root.  In the case of user, not much restriction is afforded.  It can still connect to the internet, interface with most any hardware it likes, and read/write any files in /home/user/.  This model assumes that the user is competent enough to ensure an application they are using is legitimate (which is very easy with open-source software).\nSo my question is, what sort of restrictions and control over an app's abilities will be in place on the mobile platform?  And since it's all the same OS, how will that system overflow into the desktop?  Will all programs need to be sandboxed?\nI'm quite keen to know the plan :)\nPS. One thing I like about the way iOS does it over Android is that many permissions must be explicitly approved by the user when it runs for the first time.  The result being, if you don't want to tell the Facebook app where you are, you can just disallow it, versus on Android where you just have to uninstall the app and Get Over It™.\nThe system I'd like to see is it asking for permission with a \"Just this once\" and an \"Always\" option, when the app needs that permission to execute a command.  Want to find yourself on the map?  Ask for location permission.  Just like the way some HTML5 APIs are handled.\n\nA: This is being worked on as part of the Ubuntu App Developer Upload spec, in particular, the section on security.\nThis is still in early stages, but as an extract to the spec, and to provide some context:\n\nOnce an application is installed, AppArmor will provide a security\n  sandbox to protect the user from malicious or simply broken code. To\n  accomplish this, each application will need a properly constructed,\n  and minimally permissive profile to restrict what their application\n  can access on the local system.\n\nApplications will be sandboxed via AppArmor, and permissions will be granted according to the app's AppArmor security profile.\n", "Q: Having trouble with corrupted disk images when installing 12.04.2 via flash drive I'm trying to install ubuntu 12.04.2 Desktop 64 bit on my laptop and I'm having problems with corrupted disk images. i can boot to the flash drive but it hangs during the boot and won't continue.

I've verified the md5 checksum of the iso before running unetbootin/uni usb installer.\nhard drive is fine. memtest came up clean. even checked the flash drive integrity and it was fine.\nI'm at a loss for what else i can do.\n\nA: You didn't mention on what OS you're creating the install drive.\nAvoid Unetbootin, there is a known bug in that it truncates filenames of files copied onto the USB drive without any warning or error. I've had exactly the same problems you're describing because of that.\nTry md5summing the install disk directly, there is a file located in the root of it called md5sum.txt. \nDo this (under linux):\ncd /path/to/usb/disk/ [usually /media/something]\nmd5sum -c md5sum.txt | grep -v \"OK$\"\nThis will list all the files that fail the checksum. Some files will be symlinks, these cannot be created on FAT32, but that's fine as all works without them.\nIf you're on Windows, boot from the flash drive and select \"Check CD for defects\" (assuming it gets that far). There isn't any alternative to the linux way of checksumming the entire flash stick at once as far as I know.\nMake sure that the flash drive you're using is OK, try a different one just in case.\nFormat it with FAT32, not FAT16 or NTFS.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How to Customize the (Phonetic-Arabic) Keyboard Layout? uI am a newcomer to the linux world.

If not, then why i can't do that?\nthanks in advance.\n\nA: \nIs there anyway that i can install every latest application without upgrade my distribution? \n\nNo. \nWell ... yes you can. You could install 12.10. Technically that is not a dist-upgrade ;) Backup your private files, format the disc and install 12.10 as a brand new installation. \n\nIf not, then why i can't do that?\n\nBecause the repositories for a release do not have the software that is not for newer releases (backports excluded). To get the software for 12.10 you need to change the resources list and have it point to the 12.10 repositories. What in effect is a distribution upgrade.\nIf you want a setup where you can do this you need to find a linux flavour that supports a roling release. Examples: Debian unstable, Sabayon Linux, Calculate Linux, Funtoo Linux (all based on Gentoo Linux), Arch Hurd, ArchBang, CTKArch, KahelOS, and Parabola GNU/Linux (all based on Arch Linux),  Arch Linux, Gentoo Linux, rPath Linux, and Yoper Linux.\n1 additional comment:\nAs of 13.04 this is going to change: archive.ubuntu.com will get a symlink always pointing to the current development release.

Works great as long as it´s not mobile.  Anyway it´s now going to be my home server. \nI´ve got xubuntu 12.04LTS installed, but before I start configuring this thing any deeper I wanted to get some opinions from people more knowledgeable about this stuff than I.  My main question is about running multiple services.  I would like to use this as a NAS, and Minecraft server for sure.  Possibly LAMP as well if I decide to put together a family home page etc.\nNormally I would just chuck everything on a screen and call it a day, but with the Minecraft server I will occasionally be having in-laws and friends connect from OUTSIDE the lan, which obviously poses a concern for priv escalation and data integrity.\nIn preparing to get all this running should I create a different user for each of these services with each user running it´s own screen?  Should I use some level of emulation or service segregation like LXC?  Or am I over complicating this? \nFrom a firewall perspective I´m good. NAT is setup correctly and will forward the traffic as expected.  The server itself is whitelisted (or will be).  But from a Linux perspective I´m still too green to know if I´ve covered my bases.\n\nA: Each server will run as it's own user by default. So for example, Apache (and other web servers) run as www-data.\nIn general you should be good to go, but you can read about hardening each server. In addition I would use apparmor. Most if not all servers in the repositories should have an apparmor profile already.\nOther then that, you would need to ask a specific question about a specific server.\nMy only other piece of advice is to isolate the server on your LAN. Specifically I use iptables on my LAN to reject packets from the server local IP.\n", "Q: dconf-editor, Where has apps>indicators>sound gone sound is no longer listed in my dconf-editor under apps>indicators>\nAnyone know where to find it?\n\nA: dconf-editor com/canonical/indicator/sound\n\n", "Q: Flash player does not work probably with Arabic language The Flash plug-in version 11.2 which is the latest version does not support the Arabic language. \nIt shows the characters separated and oriented from left to right; whereas it has to display them as joined characters and oriented right to left. \nAdobe says that they will only provide a security update and nothing else, so that clear bug will be kept for Firefox, Opera and other browsers that depend on the standalone plug-in. \nGoogle Chrome display the language correctly because of it's own built in plug-in.\n\n\nA: Since Adobe will not update flash for Linux.  \n\nAdobe will no longer provide new releases of Flash Player for Linux\n  after version 11.2, the company has today announced.\nGoogle will, instead, take over the implementation of Flash Player via\n  a new plugin API called ‘Pepper‘.1\n\nConsider using HTML 5 instead of flash for You Tube.

Set up pptp on the command line\nWe'll use a handy tool called pptpsetup that sets up all the needed config files for us.\nRun:\nsudo pptpsetup --create $your-connection --server se.rv.er.ip --username $pptp-username  --encrypt\nreplace :\n- $your-connection with the a short name for the new connection\n- se.rv.er.ip with the IP of the server you want to connect to\n- $pptp-username with the username of the connecting user \nYou will be first asked for the sudo password, then pptpsetup will ask you for the password for the PPTP connection. Enter it, then press enter. Take care, don't mix them up.\nThis will have created all the configuration files necessary. If you don't want to use the default route pushed to you by the server, add a line saying nodefaultroute to /etc/ppp/peers/$connection-name.\n3. Starting and stopping the connection manually\nsudo pon your-connection\nto connect, and\nsudo poff your-connection\nto disconnect.\n4. If you want to automatically add and remove custom routes:\nCreate two scripts, like this:\n(place them somewhere in your home folder, /root is also ok if you don't forget to back it up)\npptp-on.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\n# This script connects us using pre-configured PPTP VPN,\n# and then adds all the routes we specify here.\n\npon your-connection\na=$?\n\nsleep 5\n\n# add routes\nif [ $a == 0 ]; then\n        # whatever routes you need\n        route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev ppp0\n        echo \"Connected\"\nfi\n\nexit $a\n\npptp-off.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\n\npoff your-connection\n\na=$?\n\n# delete routes\nif [ $a == 0 ]; then\n        #specify whatever routes you have here\n        route del -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev ppp0\n        echo \"Disconnected\"\nfi\n\nexit $a\n\nThey have to be owned by root: sudo chown root:root pptp-on.sh pptp-off.sh. Make them executable: sudo chmod +x pptp-on.sh pptp-off.sh\nName them whatever suits you, so you'll know what they're for.\n5. Creating desktop launchers\nI wanted to have desktop launchers I can just click on instead of running the scripts manually every time I connect and disconnect. To do this, I created two desktop launchers that run gksudo /path/to/pptp-on.sh and gksudo /path/to/pptp-off.sh respectively. I used Marian Lux-es Create Launcher available from Ubuntu's Software Center. Google for how to do this, I'm not going to write this here (cause I'm lazy).\nThat's it. You can have as many different connections as you want, all turned on and off easily with launchers. Just do all the steps again for every additional connection.\nBut beware, as said, this is not a fix, but a solution. The fix will be when NM gets \nbuilt-in support for network bridges, which is, if I've read correctly, already done in 13.04. This is just intended for people like me, who plan to hold on to 12.04 as long as they can (I've tried 12.10 but had big problems, like incompatibility with my ATI graphics card, lot of bugs, etc.), or at least until the next LTS release or moving to new/er hardware.\n", "Q: When compiling the Linux Kernel, what is the purpose of `make randconfig`? In what scenario would one want to use this tool? It would seem to make less work, but the upshot is, of course, that you don't know what configuration options will be used for your kernel, which could very well mess things up.\n\nA: The messing things up is the point.\nIt's used for what's called \"fuzz testing\" - making sure the kernel config can't be put in a state where the kernel can't compile.

I'm guessing that either you are installing the msttcorefonts package or something that requires the installation of that package like wine, playonlinux, etc. Apt is doing a good thing here, making you aware and agree to the license that the software for this particular package is covered by.\n\nA: I agree with @Mordoc.\nmsttcorefonts is a copyright protected package outside of Ubuntu's licensing agreement (logically, as it is from Microsoft) \nMost of what is in the apt-cache (can be installed via apt-get or Ubuntu Store) has been licensed to allow Ubuntu users to install it by the developers. \nHowever, just because you can install something via apt-get doesn't mean it is freely licensed, as djeikyb commented. Some things that can download can be from a non-free repository (where apt downloads the programs from) and thus you can have to agree to an agreement (even though it's in the apt-cache).\nOther things, like programs you download from outside (eg...msttcorefonts) may have different licensing agreement.\n\nA: After being unable to proceed from the EULA, scouring these boards for a solution, getting frustrated; I ended up hitting the \"tab\" button in a fury, which highlighted the \"Ok\" button, then prompted me to agree or disagree. After that, terminal resumed its normal function. Cheers!\n\nA: The screenshot is low quality, but I think it's a Microsoft licence of Truefont.

Are there any fast, lightweight alternatives to Compiz' Expo Plugin (which are compatible with / capable of running alongside Unity & Compiz) in standard Ubuntu?\nI'm looking for sth that's almost 1:1 like Expo is today, in particular the alternative should feature\n\n\n*\n\n*an overview of (four) workspaces, with a resolution comparable to Expo's\n\n*no animations\n\n\nDrag-and-drop of windows across workspaces, on the other hand, is not necessary.

It does have default keypress but you can also assign a hot spot to activate Expo.\n", "Q: Stitching a photo below a batch of photos I am sure there would be a simple command for this however I have not been able to find one.\nBasically I would like to stitch a photo below another photo with no overlap. Also ideally I would like a command that can automate this process for 200 top images where the same bottom image is stitched. All images have the same width so no transformation is required. \nI am looking for a program something like \"stitch -below top.png bottom.png\", I have explored options like Montage but can not seem to get it to work as required. Looking for advise.\n\nA: First you need to open a terminal and sudo apt-get install imagemagick.\nNow place all your images in the same folder so you can easily access them from the terminal. Put the top images all in their own folder and keep the bottom image elsewhere to simplify things.\nType cd DIRNAME, you need to replace DIRNAME with the name of the folder the pictures are stored in, for example /home/mark/collating is what I use for this purpose.\nNow that your shell is in the right folder and imagemagick is installed we use the following to stick the images together:\nconvert -append image1.jpg image2.jpg output.jpg\nThis will take the two images named image1 and image2 and stick image2 on the bottom of image1, saving the result as a file named output.jpg.\nTo automate this you can use a script like this one. You need to change the variables so they point to the right places.\n#! /bin/bash\n\n#   Replace the values of these variables with the locations of your tops and the bottom.\n# The output directory must already exist!\n#   \"~/\" is a shortcut for your home dir, FYI.\n\nTopsDir=\"~/collating/tops\" #Only the TOP images should be in this folder!\nBottomImg=\"~/collating/bottom.png\"\nOutputDir=\"~/collating/complete\"\n\n[ -d \"$TopsDir\" -a -d \"$OutputDir\" ] && [ -f \"$BottomImg\" ] || { echo \"One of the paths you supplied wasn't valid.\"; exit 1;}\n\ncd \"$TopsDir\"\n\nfor TopImg in *; do\n    convert -append \"$TopImg\" \"$BottomImg\" \"$OutputDir/$TopImg\"\ndone\n\nCopy and paste it into gedit or your text editor and edit the variables so that they point to the correct folders. (Or file for the bottom img.) Save it as collator.sh. It is convenient for the next steps if you save it in your home directory.\nNow open a terminal and navigate to where you saved the file. (You're already there if you saved it in your home dir, otherwise type cd /path/to/your/location) Type chmod +x collator.sh to give the file execute permissions.\nAnd now we get the work done:Type ./collator.sh to run the script; and you're done.\n", "Q: How do I remove Windows 8 from a Ubuntu 12.10 WUBI install? I have used Windows all my life, but now I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 WUBI. I'm absolutely new to Linux, and although Ubuntu is installed as dual boot along with Windows 8, I only want to use Ubuntu. How do I remove Windows 8 from my laptop?\n\nA: Do NOT attempt to Delete a Windows installation if you have install Ubuntu via WUBI. It will leave your computer un-bootable.\nYour WUBI install is, for all effective purposes, inside your Windows 8 install, and as such you should not attempt to delete it. You should copy all the data (your photos, documents, videos, etc.) from the computer and on to an external device (such as a USB stick or CD). You can then install Ubuntu 12.10 from (another) DVD or USB by burning and booting them. There, you can install a new Ubuntu installation, erasing both your old Ubuntu installation and your Windows 8 installation.\nYou may wish to follow these instructions to install Ubuntu on a separate partition.\n\nA: You can NOT remove windows if you installed Ubuntu with Wubi because it is installed on the same drive of windows as a an ordinary program, you can do this if you install Ubuntu from a CD\n", "Q: Xubuntu: Unable to bind arbitrary shortcut keys I used to be able to bind any arbitrary shortcut key to launching external applications; in particular, I used to bind Ctrl+Shift+hjkl to a small utility which moves the mouse cursor around.\nHowever, a while back, this stopped working, as now it only seems to allow binding shortcut keys to a single modifier at a time; pressing Ctrl+Shift+j binds the action to Ctrl+j, for example.  If I manually edit my key bindings in the associated config file, the bindings simply do not work.\nThe one exception to the single-modifier shortcuts seems to be that you can bind Ctrl+Super+(anything) to a separate shortcut; however, the purpose of this configuration is to improve my workstation ergonomics, and Ctrl+Super+hjkl are somewhat more cumbersome to press.\nShort of completely switching window managers, is there some way to get xfwm to recognize keyboard shortcuts formed from Ctrl+Shift?\n\nA: This is a bug in Xfce 4.10 and has been reported here.

There is absolutely nothing on them!  I am trying to load Ubuntu Mint on them and have it installed on one of the laptops, from a CD that I burned with the software and during the setup, step 4 of 8, (prepare partitions) it got stuck.  \nThere is nothing listed there so I went to the terminal and got the gparted software but when I sudo lshw -C disk, it only lists *-cdrom.  I used the sfdisk command and try using the menu options, nothing works.  Does that mean the hard drive isn't formatted at all and that is why Ubuntu can't see it?  \nI am not a programmer, just thought this was the best option for these laptops.  Any advice you can give me on formatting the partitions would be highly appreciated. \nPlease share step by step with me in the Linux language. \n\nA: considering lshw says there is only the cdrom, I would suggest you to:\n1 Check the physical disk is inserted and powered on your laptop, what lshw is saying is there is no disks in this computer.\n2 check your laptop bios, search for the boot options, verify your laptop find the hard drive.\n3 If you are using a live cd, you could open a terminal and write:\n  sudo lshw -html > myhardware.html\n  Then you could read the specs from your pc with via a web browser:\n  firefox myhardware.html\n  This will tell you all about your laptop hardware.\n4 If all else fail, you can burn a live cd of gparted, I think it has more options to detect your disks.\n", "Q: How can I change the owner of a folder? I am an emigrant from Windows but I am having a serious problem which is changing the Root permission. \nI tried to changed the owner by doing right click and change the permission but it's not working. \nCan any one help me to move these folder?\n\nA: You could do this by using the chown command.\nUsage: chown -R $user $directory\nFor example, if you wanted to change the permission of folder you created as root named \"example\" inside your home directory, you would first obtain root privileges by typing su, and then run chown -R ousman /home/ousman/example, assuming your username is \"ousman\". The \"-R\" stands for \"recursive\", so that the owner of the files inside the directory changes as well.\n\nA: There are a few good ways to do this:\nGraphical method:\npress alt+f2 or open a new terminal window and type:\ngksu nautilus\n\n\"browse to and right click on the folder you would like to modify.

I then wanted to create a backup,so I went in the terminal(on live boot cd) and I cloned my 250 gig hard drive partition onto my much larger 1tb external hard drive. Well the dd did a good job and created a 250 gig partition on my drive, but now all my data is gone. when I look at the hard drive in windows, it says there are 3 partitions, one smaller partition, one cloned drive partition, and about 700gigs of unallocated space.

I occasionally use the killall command to kill processes. The reason why I say ocassionally is that in some cases it hasn't worked for me.\nA recent example was with thunderbird where there were about 5 instances in memory so I decided to use the killall command. It killed 2 processes and 3 were still left in memory. Tried again and the 3 were still there.\nSo I manually used the kill -9 command to kill each of the individual processes via their pids. That worked.\nI mostly use the kill -9 command as it works. The killall command has let me down so many times I just don't bother using it. But there must be a reason why it doesn't work. Am I using it wrong? \nI know there are other commands like pkill but I would be grateful to understand why the killall command doesn't work as expected. I have even tried to kill just one process and it is a hit and miss affair. But the kill -9 command works every time.\nAny ideas?\nPS: sudo doesn't make a difference\n\nA: killall accepts most of the same syntax as kill. In particular, there's no need to write anything fancy to make killall do the equivalent of kill -9. This works just fine:\nkillall -9 thunderbird\n\n(Of course, as discussed, you should usually be reluctant to use killall -9 or, equivalently, killall -KILL, unless other measures have already been tried without success.)\n\nA: From the man page for killall\n\nkillall sends a signal to all processes running any of the specified\n  commands. If no signal name is specified, SIGTERM is sent.\n\nWhen you do a kill -9, you are sending the SIGKILL signal. If you want to send a SIGKILL with killall, you need to do\nkillall -s SIGKILL <PROCESSNAME>\n\nA good explanation of the difference between SIGKILL and SIGTERM (and why you should try SIGTERM first)\nFrom http://rackerhacker.com/2010/03/18/sigterm-vs-sigkill/\n\nSending signals to processes using kill on a Unix system is not a new\n  topic for most systems administrators, but I’ve been asked many times\n  about the difference between kill and kill -9.\nAnytime you use kill on a process, you’re actually sending the process\n  a signal (in almost all situations – I’ll get into that soon).\n  Standard C applications have a header file that contains the steps\n  that the process should follow if it receives a particular signal. You\n  can get an entire list of the available signals on your system by\n  checking the man page for kill.\nConsider a command like this:\nkill 2563 \nThis would send a signal called SIGTERM to the process. Once\n  the process receives the notice, a few different things can happen:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*the process may stop immediately \n  \n*the process may stop after a short delay after cleaning up resources\n  \n*the process may keep running indefinitely\n  \n  \n  The application can determine what it wants to do once a\n  SIGTERM is received. While most applications will clean up their\n  resources and stop, some may not. An application may be configured to\n  do something completely different when a SIGTERM is received. Also, if\n  the application is in a bad state, such as waiting for disk I/O, it\n  may not be able to act on the signal that was sent.\nMost system administrators will usually resort to the more abrupt\n  signal when an application doesn’t respond to a SIGTERM:\nkill -9 2563\nThe -9 tells the kill command that you want to send\n  signal #9, which is called SIGKILL. With a name like that, it’s\n  obvious that this signal carries a little more weight.\nAlthough SIGKILL is defined in the same signal header file as SIGTERM,\n  it cannot be ignored by the process. In fact, the process isn’t even\n  made aware of the SIGKILL signal since the signal goes straight to the\n  kernel init. At that point, init will stop the process. The process\n  never gets the opportunity to catch the signal and act on it.\nHowever, the kernel may not be able to successfully kill the process\n  in some situations. If the process is waiting for network or disk I/O,\n  the kernel won’t be able to stop it. Zombie processes and processes\n  caught in an uninterruptible sleep cannot be stopped by the kernel,\n  either. A reboot is required to clear those processes from the system.\n\nWhen you sent killall (SIGTERM) to the thunderbird processes, you requested those processes to stop. Some of those processes weren't working correctly (probably why you needed to kill them in the first place), so they couldn't act on the SIGTERM signal. \n\nA: For those looking for a quick answer:\nsudo killall -s SIGTERM processname\n", "Q: I can't find my hard drive to make a backup of it 2 weeks ago my computer stopped working.

It contains a command.\nIt's a prompt, followed by a command, followed by the output of the command. The command itself is:\nls -l test.conf\n\nThat command displays information about the file called test.conf located in the current directory. The ls command displays (or lists) information about files. The -l flag makes it display the information in long form, rather than just showing the filename.\n(ls without a flag like -l is most often used to list multiple files or determine if a file exists, but may be used with a file known to exist; by default in Ubuntu, issuing ls filename will highlight filename in a way that shows what kind of file it is, for example, it will use a certain color if it is a directory, another if it is marked executable.)\nThe output is:\n-rw-r--r-- l root root 791 Mar 20 09:23 test.conf\n\nThat means the file:\n\n\n*\n\n*is not a directory (-rw-r--r-- doesn't start with d)\n\n*is non-setuid and non-setgid (no s in -rw-r--r--) and non-sticky (no t)\n\n*is readable and writeable by its owner (rw- for owner) but only readable by other users (r-- for group members, r-- again for others) — see the community documentation on permissions\n\n*is owned by the user root (with root as its group identity also)\n\n*is 791 bytes in size\n\n*reports that it was last modified (or created) on the 20th of March at 9:23 am\n\n*has the name test.conf\nThe beginning of the line is a prompt; this is what is displayed to the user in a shell to notify the user they may enter a command. Prompts are often configured to provide helpful information to the user. Here the prompt is:\nroot@ubuntu:/etc/openvpn#\n\nThis means the current user is root, the machine's hostname is ubuntu (which usually means this is a live CD/DVD/USB system, but someone could name their machine ubuntu in an installed system too), and the current directory is /etc/openvpn (which is where configuration data for OpenVPN are stored, see also the Ubuntu OpenVPN documentation).\nThe # character indicates that this is a superuser shell (which is to be expected as it is owned by root, the superuser); otherwise it would have been $ (but please note that this convention is not universally followed, and some shells default to % which does not indicate anything about the shell's capabilities).\n", "Q: The \"man\" pages are not very well laid out or even helpful at times, alternatives? I always thought of writing a bash utility called realman which would explain commands like in the man pages but instead of laying out the commands in alphabetical order by the options the command has, it would simply just give examples the average user would need.\nSome commands do give examples but as the man pages are constructed by different people there is no central control on what a man page should look like readability wise.\nTake a description of man as an example\nNAME\n       man - an interface to the on-line reference manuals\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       man  [-C  file]  [-d]  [-D] [--warnings[=warnings]] [-R encoding] [-L locale] [-m system[,...]] [-M path] [-S list] [-e extension] [-i|-I] [--regex|--wildcard]\n       [--names-only] [-a] [-u] [--no-subpages] [-P pager] [-r prompt] [-7] [-E  encoding]  [--no-hyphenation]  [--no-justification]  [-p  string]  [-t]  [-T[device]]\n       [-H[browser]] [-X[dpi]] [-Z] [[section] page ...] ...\n       man -k [apropos options] regexp ...\n       man -K [-w|-W] [-S list] [-i|-I] [--regex] [section] term ...\n       man -f [whatis options] page ...\n       man  -l  [-C  file]  [-d]  [-D]  [--warnings[=warnings]]  [-R  encoding]  [-L  locale]  [-P pager] [-r prompt] [-7] [-E encoding] [-p string] [-t] [-T[device]]\n       [-H[browser]] [-X[dpi]] [-Z] file ...\n       man -w|-W [-C file] [-d] [-D] page ...\n       man -c [-C file] [-d] [-D] page ...\n       man [-hV]\n\nIt's totally overkill.

Not every command has \"that one option most users would use.\"\nHowever, you said that for man you'd want to see something like:\n\nIts a program gives you more details of a command.\n\nFor information like that about commands, use whatis. This summarizes man pages.\nek@Kip:~$ whatis man\nman (7)              - macros to format man pages\nman (1)              - an interface to the on-line reference manuals\nek@Kip:~$ whatis whatis\nwhatis (1)           - display manual page descriptions\nek@Kip:~$ whatis ls\nls (1)               - list directory contents\nLS (6)               - display animations aimed to correct users who accident...\nek@Kip:~$ whatis ping\nping (8)             - send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts\n\nThis still doesn't give you any information about command-line options for the commands (but then again, neither does \"It's a program that gives you more details of a command\").\nIf you want an intermediate amount of information, the best course might be for you to look up the command on the Internet. You can search the web for it, or even Wikipedia. Many of the most well known and commonly used commands have Wikipedia articles. For example, see the articles on ls, man (about manpages in general, but includes man syntax advice), grep, and fsck.\nYou can browse the web from the command-line, if you wish, by using a web browser that supports command-line mode (such as links2 ), or a command-line only browser (like lynx ).\nFinally, please note that many command-line utilities in Ubuntu come from the GNU project, which provides excellent documentation. Often it's longer and more detailed than the manual pages, but you might find it better organized. And usually there are descriptive headings that help you find specific information, in my experience much more easily than in many manpages.\nGNU manuals can be found here. (Remember not all utilities are GNU utilities.) Many of the most commonly used commands don't appear by name but are part of GNU coreutils. GNU manuals can be viewed online and also may be downloaded in various file formats, some of which are well-suited to viewing on the command-line.\n", "Q: NCAA March Madness Live doesn't work NCAA March Madness Live is a Flash-based video player for the NCAA college basketball tournament that started today. In past years, it worked fine in Linux, but now I get an error that says \"Technical Foul\" and \"V001\" when I try to view a video. Their documentation and support staff were not able to help me.\nI tried this on two separate computers (both running Ubuntu 12.10) in Firefox and Chrome (FF from the default repos, Chrome stable from Google's repo). Both had the same problem. On both computers I also have a Windows XP virtual machine running inside Ubuntu, and March Madness Live works fine in the VM.\nSo, any ideas? I know Flash is proprietary and the error message is not very revealing. Has anyone at least been able to watch games in Linux?\nEDIT: Just to clarify... the ads usually do play successfully, at least in part. The basketball games have never played for me, even for a second. And while there is a place to log in with your cable/satellite TV provider account, it should give you 4 hours free without doing that. Personally I have tried both logged in and not logged in (as some other people replying here also tried) and neither way works in Linux but both ways work in Windows.\n\nA: This isn't well noted on the March Madness website, but there's a blue button in the upper right that says 'select TV provider.'\nIf you click it, you can log in through your provider, where for the first time this helpful text will appear:\n\nSubscription to TBS, TNT or TruTV is required to experience March\n  Madness live online\n\nSince I don't have cable and found that at least the ads worked once I turned off Ghostery and Adblock, my assumption is that the request for the video stream will always fail because I'm not authenticated through my ISP as a cable subscriber.\nHowever, if you have cable, my guess is that you need to click the blue button and log in.\n\nA: I too experienced this problem using Ubuntu and attempting to watch live games. While speaking with their support, I questioned the blue button. I was told that is only needed to allow unlimited viewing. The Tier 2 tech I was speaking with said that every browser is entitled to 4 free hours without logging in through their provider, so that should not be the problem.\n\nA: I also have the same problem.  I tried both Firefox and Chrome as well.  I have logged in with my cable subscription, but that did not make any difference.  For what it is worth, the initial commercial always appears successfully.  The error only occurs once it comes time to play the game feed itself.\n\nFrom http://www.ncaa.com/march-madness-live/help#!devices\n\nThe following Operating Systems are supported:\nWindows 7\nWindows Vista\nWindows XP\nWindows 8\nMac OS X 10 or higher\n\n\nIt looks like Ubuntu is not directly supported.\n", "Q: Getting Wireless to Work, Dell Inspiron E1505 (bcm4311) Ok.  so I know there are about a million threads on this subject already, but NOTHING has worked for me.

I followed the instructions to install spotify as on various forums & sites, pretty much the same steps everywhere. But when I get to the install spotify line, this is what happens:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n spotify-client : Depends: libgconf2-4 but it is not installable\nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nWhat is libgconf2-4 and how do I fix this?\n\nA: I had the exact same problem. What's wrong here is that Spotify cannot run without the package libgconf2-4. This is because Spotify depends on that package. It would be like running an application like Minecraft without previously installing the package libgconf2-4. You can download libgconf2-4 from here. \nGet the package according to what version of Ubuntu you have. After you install libgconf2-4, Spotify should install, and you can get to your music!\n\nA: \nInstalling Spotify\n\nThe first step is to open Software Sources via the Unity Dash:\n\nSelect the ‘Other Software’ tab in Software Sources 1\n\nClick ‘Add’ 2 and paste the following the entry field of the box that appears:\n  deb http://repository.spotify.com stable non-free\n\nClick ‘Add Source’ to confirm the change, then close Software Sources.\n\nAdd Spotify Repo Key\n\nThe next step is to add the repository key to verify that packages installed from this PPA are by whom they say.\nOpen a new Terminal window\nPaste the following, then hit return/enter:\n sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 94558F59\n\nThat’s that! You can now install Spotify through the Ubuntu Software Center (after checking for software updates first) or by running the following command in the Terminal window:\n sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install spotify-client\n\nOnce installed you can launch Spotify from the Unity Dash.\nSource : OMG Ubuntu\nA sneak peek into Spotify's secret labs\n", "Q: Change where basket saves notebooks? Currently I am trying to use Basket but, I can't find the place where it lets me change where my Baskets are stored. I need to keep them encrypted from prying eyes and want them located in /media/truecrypt1. I've searched all the menus and settings to no avail.\n\nA: You are right. All the notes are saved in that folder in Kubuntu. And in Ubuntu, they are saved in ~/.kde/share/apps/basket/baskets.\nThere is no option to save all the futures notes created in a specific folder. \nAlternatively, you can export all the notes that you want to, in any folder or external device. To do that, do a second-click in the note and select Export -> Basket archive...\n\n\nI have requested this feature sending an email to the developers, but this project seems to be abandoned.

And every time I look at the desktop I am wondering why their icons doesn't fit in rows and columns. Even if I sort by name the items are still not in a row.\nIs it possible to have a grid like the filemanager or every other os has?\nPS: Using 12.10\n\nA: When you right-click on the desktop, click on \"Keep Aligned\" so that it is checked before you organize it by name.  Unless I am wrong, this should realign them to the grid.\nIt appears that there is a grid, it's just small.

If I didn't want to restart the machine.  Is there a way to automount the drive.\nIt shows up under /dev/sdb1 if I do:\nfstab -l\n\nA: I wouldn't call it \"automounting\" but you can manually mount the drive. try making a directory for it to mount to:\n    sudo mkdir /media/name_of_drive\n\nThen mount it with\n    sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/name_of_drive\n\n\nA: From man page of mount:\nmount -a [-t type] [-O optlist]\n(usually given in a bootscript) causes all filesystems mentioned in fstab (of the proper type and/or having or not having the proper options) to be mounted as indicated, except for those whose line contains the noauto keyword. Adding the -F option will make mount fork, so that the filesystems are mounted simultaneously.\nWhen mounting a filesystem mentioned in fstab or mtab, it suffices to give only the device, or only the mount point.\nThe programs mount and umount maintain a list of currently mounted filesystems in the file /etc/mtab. If no arguments are given to mount, this list is printed.\n", "Q: Is there an application that does nested note taking? I'm pulling my hair out trying to find a notebook program that lets me do nested note taking, and that has the ability to change the location of the notebooks. That seems really easy but, I've found virtually no good note taking programs that do this.\nHere's a list of what I've tried so far and why it didn't work for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*KeepNote : Very slow and unresponsive but it was pretty good aside from some formatting quirks. I was using this before but, the lag for doing ANYTHING was too high so I gave up using it.\n\n*GNote : Sticky note app, not what I needed\n\n*Tomboy : Esentially the same as GNote, doesn't let me change the location of the notes\n\n*RedNotebook : Very confusing and doesn't let me make notes that are nested more than two deep.\n\n*Basket : So far the best BUT won't let me change the location of the notebook, which makes it useless to me. If there is some way to do this I am missing I would love to hear it -> Change where basket saves notebooks?\n\n*Zim : Cool, and I'd use it but, it doesn't have the depth of features I need.\n\n*Notecase : The closest thing I have found, I like the fact it encrypts but, the file linking feature doesn't work all the time, and I need it.\n\n\nIs there any alternatives besides these? Personally I'd prefer Basket but, it has some weird quirks. First, it only saves notebooks to ~/.kde/shae/baskets, and I don't want these notes touching my hard drive at all. I need them to go to an encrypted volume /media/truecrypt1.\nSecondly, though it has fancy PGP encryption, it doesn't encrypt the entire basket tree, only the first basket and, while the PGP encryption is perfect for me, this seems like a huge flaw, as you have to encrypt EVERY note/basket attached to it by hand, meaning I have to type my 20+ character password every time. If I have to I might just run wine with OneNote, even though I do not like using Microsoft products.\n\nA: If Basket does what you need except for saving the stuff in the wrong place, you could just create a symlink from where Basket wants to save stuff to where you want it:\nln -s /media/truecrypt1/baskets ~/.kde/share/baskets\n\nI don't know exactly what encryption software you use, but assuming that it lets programs read and write from the file system as long as you're logged in and have unlocked it, this should do what you need in terms of moving the baskets.\n", "Q: Recover files from Ubuntu using Win 7, and repair start-up About 4 months ago, I installed Ubuntu 12.04 via wubi onto my laptop to run alongside Windows 7. At start-up, I can select which OS I would like to use.\nLast night, I was working on two reports, and ended up writing about twenty pages between the two files. I wrote them using LibreOffice Writer, in case that is important. At the end of the night, I shut down my laptop as usual, saving and closing everything beforehand. When I turned my laptop on this afternoon, I tried to boot up Ubuntu, but it became stuck on the purple screen that it sends you to while booting up the OS. I let it sit for an hour and it still didn't get anywhere. I haven't installed or downloaded anything for about two weeks, and that was just Adobe Flash Player. I don't go to very many places on the internet, and I know that the couple of sites I use are safe, so I don't know what may have caused this startup issue. However, this topic is less important. During start-up, there is nothing saying that anything is missing or corrupted.\nI figure I will probably have to reinstall Ubuntu, but is there any way that I can repair it and not lose my files that I have?\nAlso, if I have to reinstall, I would like to at least temporarily move the two files I was working on last night. They are the only two that I have not backed up yet. I saw a bunch of articles on this site and in a couple other places saying to install various ext2reader programs and such. I tried the four that everyone kept saying to use, but none of them actually found any files or even seemed to work. Every article I found is over a year old, so I am hoping that those programs were just outdated, and someone here might know a way for me to recover those files via windows that actually works.\nSo my two questions here would be:\nIs there a way for me to recover my LibreOffice Writer files from Ubuntu via Win7?\nHow can I repair the start-up for Ubuntu, or do I have to reinstall it?\n\nA: I recommend installing ext2fsd. It is basically a driver that allows you to view files in an ext2, ext3, or ext4 filesystem and mount them just as your C: drive in Windows. \nIn the ext2fsd program, right click on the partition you want to mount.\nSelect ext2 management.\ncheck automatically mount via ext2mgr and choose a drive letter.\nYour newly mounted partition should be viewable under my computer in Windows Explorer, and you should be able to copy the files with ease. \nI personally think that it would just be easier to resinstall Ubuntu since you can back up your important files in Windows now.\n", "Q: How can I remove the \"GNOME desktop environment\" entry from my login screen after uninstalling GNOME? I installed The GNOME Desktop Environment, with extra components, but I didn't like it, so I uninstalled it. But now at the login screen, besides the password box there's still the button to choose Unity, Gnome and Gnome basic or something like that. How can I completely remove it?\n\nA: I remember reading somewhere that (sudo) deleting what you don't need from /usr/share/xsessions will clean up your login screen. While the titles of the .desktop files are quite explanatory, you could make sure by viewing their contents in a text editor. Just to be safe, copy those .desktop files elsewhere first!\nSee How can I use LightDM for user-defined sessions? for more.\n", "Q: Mounting UDF hard drive partition at boot How do I get a UDF hard drive partition to mount at boot? From what I can figure, mountall runs before the udf module loads.\nSpecifically: do PREREQ specifications in initramfs-tools hooks only specify other hooks, or can they specify modules without hooks files? If the answer to this is that they can specify modules I think the solution to the greater problem will be to add a conditional PREREQ to hooks/mountall of udf if the udf module is available.\nCurrently I have a UDF partition on my hard drive specified in /etc/fstab, and boot hangs with \"drive not yet ready or not present\".  If I specify \"nobootfail\" in /etc/fstab, the boot completes without mounting the partition.  Since the end goal is to have the UDF partition be /home, this is a problem...\n\nA: I've found the base problem and a workaround. The problem is that the udf kernel module will not load during the initramfs phase of boot (it's supposed to even by default but doesn't even if explicitly specified); the workaround is to specify option _netdev on the udf filesystem line in fstab.\n", "Q: launcher not coming in screen Launcher has vanished from my desktop.

If yes then how to do it?\n\n*Can an application switch from one user to another, e.g., app1 running under /home/usr1 can switch to /home/usr2\n\nA: It's best to post separate questions separately. However, since these can all be answered quickly (and are related), I've done so.\n\n\n*\n\n*The same application may be run by different users, at different times, or at the same time. The application may run from the same location (so long as both users have access to execute it), or separate copies may be run from different locations (as in your example).\n\n*Two different users cannot share a UID. Your UID is actually more central to your user identity (hence the name) than your username. When you own a file or folder, the filesystem contains your UID associated with the file, not your username. Having two users with the same UID would mean having a single user with multiple names (which is also not supported).\n\n*Yes, it is possible to switch user identity. You can use sudo -u other-user command... or (if you are currently root, or if the target user has login enabled and you know their password) su other-user -c 'command...'. You can invoke these commands yourself, but scripts and applications can also use them.\nSee the community documentation, man sudo, and man su for more details on how this works and how to use it. In a program you are writing, you can also use the setuid function; see man 2 setuid and man 3 setuid. To run graphical applications, you should use gksu/gksudo or (in Kubuntu) kdesudo instead of invoking su and sudo directly (but please note that by default in Ubuntu gksu invokes sudo, not su).

No error message.\n\n*Trying the file in Movie Player. Unexpected exit at the same time, with this message: \"An error occured. Could not read DVD. This may be because the DVD is encrypted and a DVD decryption library is not installed.\"\n\n*Check that all libraries and ladidah from medibuntu repo are installed. They are.\n\n*Repeat steps 1 through 5.\n\n*Get the ppa https://launchpad.net/~brandonsnider/+archive/cdrtools and replace wodim with cdrecord and geniosimage with mkisofs.\n\n*Throw out brasero and install k3b.\n\n*Repeat steps 1 through 5, with k3b not brasero.\n\n*Ask forums for help. This question is also posted at ubuntuforums.org.\n\n\nHow come both brasero and k3b reports success and then the iso is obviously broken? How to fix this problem?\nThis problem is similar, but not identical, to this one: Ripping DVD to iso - Accurately\nThankful for any and all input.\nEdit: Tried\ndd if=/dev/cdrom of=image_name.iso\n\nand\nddrescue -v /dev/cdrom image_name.iso\n\nBoth of which renders an iso file that is not playing at all. So even though faulty, both brasero and k3b performs better than CLI in this case.\n\nA: Maybe the dvd you have is protected by a software lock?\ntry nero too\n\nA: Note that ddrescue makes an encrypted image.  If you originally had a non-encrypted image (say from k3b) and you tried to play this in vlc, then the dvd keys for the iso file in your $USER/.dvdcss are for a non-encrypted DVD.  If you later use ddrescue to rip a new image, to play it you must remove the old keys for that image in $USER/.dvdcss and then try vlc again.\nFor problematic disks my best luck is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert the DVD in the drive\n\n*Play the DVD disk with vlc to get the keys into the\ndrive (start to play and just use the bottom location\nslider to scan through the disk.  Do this for all the\nparts of the disk (main feature and all other parts).\n\n*Exit vlc.\n\n*Now run ddrescue -- I use (in bash)\nNAME=my_movie\nddrescue -d -r2 -b2048 /dev/sr0 ${NAME}.iso ${NAME}_log\n\n\n*make sure you clear out the dvd keys. In $HOME/.dvdcss each DVD has a directory like movie_name-date_string-disk_key. For encrypted DVDs, The DVD disk has a non-zero disk key, the iso image has a zero disk key, but the contents of the directory are different if the iso image is encrypted or not SO clear out the image dir\ncd $HOME/.dvdcss\nrm -rf ./movie_name-date_string-0000000000\n\n\n*Now run vlc on the ddrescue image and see how you do.\nThis has worked for most DVDs for me.  Some are more\ndifficult as it seems there are errors on purpose in\nthe navigation data area of the dvd and you have to\nlet ddrescue work awhile to get enough good sectors\nin that area.\n\n*Note that the encrypted image CANNOT be used to write\nto DVD media, it can only be played off of the hard\ndrive. (The encrypted disk keys exist in an area that\ncannot be written by DVD writers)\n\n", "Q: which version of python is installed? I installed Ubuntu 12.10 in my VirtualBox. Is python installed by default? If not, How can I install python?\n\nA: Running python --version in a terminal will show you which version of python is currently installed. Python does come by default on ubuntu 12.10 (version 2.7.3) source\nedit: it has come to my attention that not only is python (2.7.3) available, but also python3 (3.2.3)\n\nA: To test this type python in a terminal to access python 2.7 and python3 to access python 3. In 12.10 both python 2.7 and python 3 are installed by default. \n\nA: Yes, it is installed by default. All Linux distros that I am aware of install python as a lot of default scripts are python.\nIf you want to see if a piece of software is installed and if there are multiple versions of it, what versions you have installed on your system, this is a good way to find them:\naptitude search ^python[0-9] | grep ^i\n\nIf you ever find yourself wanting to install python:\naptitude install python\n\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Enter this command in a terminal emulator window\npython -V\nwhich will provide you complete version detail.\n\nA: It seems that intent to assign the \"python\" command to python3 eventually ceased;  \"python\" still means python2 on many systems.\nSo, issue two commands, python2 --version and python3 --version (and also python --version to be sure).\nThis won't reveal any private or isolated installations.\n\nHow can I install python?\n\nFirst, decide which version and features you want (plain python, scientific/math, ipython...)\n", "Q: Is django installed by default? I installed Ubuntu 12.10. Is django installed by default on my Ubuntu? If not, how can I install it?\n\nA: Django is not installed by default. Django is a webframework written in the language python. Python is installed by default. To install django, there are essentially two ways to proceed.\n1. Use the Ubuntu package manager\nUbuntu has a version of django in its package system. If you just want to play around with django and learn what it is (and maybe do a simple project or two) you can run\nsudo apt-get install python-django\n\n2. Use pip and PyPi, the Python package manager\nIn the django community the standard procedure for most developers would be to use pip. Pip is \"a tool for installing and managing Python packages.\" You can install it as follows:\nsudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential \nsudo pip install --upgrade pip \n\nOnce pip is installed you can type pip freeze in your terminal to see the list of packages installed. You can install django using pip install django.\nThere is one thing to note, though. This will install django systemwide (for alternative instructions, see How to install django?). Normally you would want to install django in a virtual environment. There is a bit of a learning curve to these tools, but they help you to get a good development environment.\nsudo pip install --upgrade virtualenv \n\nhttp://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2010/02/how-install-pip-ubuntu/\nhttp://warpedtimes.wordpress.com/2012/09/23/a-tutorial-on-virtualenv-to-isolate-python-installations/\n\nA: If you are starting with Django, installing it using the package manager is probably simpler.\nWhile there are some good reasons to use virtualenvs and pip, they are more complicated and you need to manage the upgrade cycle yourself (i.e. you need to update core components when security updates are releases for example).\nSo, until you hit some of the problems that virtualenvs resolve you can just use the Software Center or type in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install python-django\n\n", "Q: How do I copy and paste files from one directory to another using the mouse? On Microsoft Windows, I right-click on the file and choose \"Copy\". I place my cursor on the target directory, right-click on it and choose \"Paste\".

In exactly the same way. Example image:\n\nIt shows both cut (move) and copy as options. Paste is added/highlighted when you have something to paste:\n\nThe only reservations I have with this:\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to have permissions to use the location you want to move/copy files to.

To do this, open a terminal and run the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:timekiller/unity-systrayfix\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThen, restart Unity by pressing ALT + F2 and entering \"unity\" or by logging out. Then open Dconf Editor, navigate to com > canonical > unity > panel and the \"systray-whitelist\" should be displayed there so you can enable some apps to be able to use the systray. \nAfter adding an application to the systray whitelist, remember to restart Unity or else it won't work.\nsource: http://www.webupd8.org/2013/05/how-to-get-systray-whitelist-back-in.html\n", "Q: How to convert Powerpoint ppsx (presentation) to pdf?

At the moment I have Mint on my computer, and I want to change back to Ubuntu, but with 13.04 coming so soon, should I install 12.10 and upgrade, or are there any advantages in waiting and doing a fresh install of 13.04?\n\nA: If you have already decided to use Ubuntu, you should feel free to install Ubuntu 12.10, because you can upgrade to 13.04 when it comes out.\nAssuming you wait for the actual release date to upgrade, most likely there will be no problems upgrading. I do recommend reading the release notes before upgrading, in case there are bugs that might affect the upgrade. (Similarly, I recommend reading the release notes before performing a fresh install, if you choose to do that.)\nIt's possible that a fresh install will work better than an upgrade, even if nothing is noted in the release notes about it. But if you have any preference at all, I recommend going with your preference. There's no strong reason to think a fresh install will work better, and if something goes wrong during the upgrade or afterwards, you can always just wipe the disk and perform a fresh install of 13.04!\nYou also have the options of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sticking with 12.10 even after 13.04 is out (12.10 will be supported through April 2014).\n\n*Installing 13.04 now, even though it is not yet released (please note that if you do this, you cannot get support for it here on Ask Ubuntu until it is released, but you can get support from a variety of other official Ubuntu help resources). You shouldn't do this unless you're prepared to face bugs, including crashes. Unless you know or want to learn how to report bugs, I recommend against using a development release of Ubuntu. But I've included this because it's one of your options. In my experience, 13.04 works pretty well now, but my experience with it is highly limited.\n\n", "Q: My RAM and CPU's are free but my computer is so slow (Ubuntu 12.10)?

Or how can I find out what is the problem?\n\nA: I would be interested to learn what you have in the System Log.  You can access the System Log by typing 'System Log' into the launcher.\nYou can also access the same log files from terminal with your favorite text editor by navigating to '/var/log/'...\nYou can try reproducing the problems that you are experiencing and check to see if any new entries are made to the syslog that would point at what your problem actually is.\nrunning 'dmesg' from terminal and reviewing the output may also hint at the problem...\n\nA: Most of time this kind of behavior depends on temperature problems.

When I double click the sublime_text executable, a window pops up with \"This file is executable. Do you want to execute it?\" message. How can I launch Sublime Text without that prompt?\n\nA: Apparently, this is the way PCmanFM deals with binary files, but not only PCmanFM. In Linux, a binary file is meant to be run, instead of doubleclicked. For example, in your case, ./sublime_text would be the way to run it. That said, doubleclicking is convinient, so you can create a custom launcher on the desktop or in the menu.\nIn a terminal window, run leafpad SublimeText.desktop, and paste in the following:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nIcon=/home/vitaly/Sublime\\ Text\\ 2/Icon/128x128/sublime_text.png\nName=Sublime Text\nComment=Sublime Text       \nCategories=Applications\nExec=/home/vitaly/Sublime\\ Text\\ 2/sublime_text\nStartupNotify=true\nTerminal=false\n\nI've assumed that your username is vitaly, and that you've extracted the program to your home folder.

I am installing Ubuntu 12.10 in Windows with Wubi and I want to know if it's going to COPY my Windows files and place them in Ubuntu, or MOVE them to Ubuntu, or leave the Windows files so I start with an empty Ubuntu (which I want). Can someone please tell me?\n\nA: It will leave the Windows files alone and create a place for Ubuntu to run out of.  WUBI installs Ubuntu as an application inside of Windows.\n\nA: That's up to you. Ubuntu can be installed besides Windows. So you have a multi-boot system and no files are touched. Of course, you need enough space for doing this.\nThe other option is to wipe all the data and install Ubuntu over your system, so every file on your system partition are lost.\nMy Advise: Backup all files you want to keep.\n", "Q: PHP mail() function not working I've been trying to configure the mail() function for 3 days by now, and I'm running out of ideas.\nI've installed and configured postfix as a satellite, following this guide: How to have my PHP Send mail? but it seems I lack the file /etc/postfix/sender_canonical (and of course I have no idea of what to put inside it). By now this is the only clue I have about the problem... \nI'm trying to run it on Ubuntu 12.04 laptop, built with x32 architecture.\nEDIT: After a few iterations of apt-get purge and apt-get install, mail() started to return true, the error log has stopped growing so it seems all ok, but no mail managed to reach my inbox, not even as spam.\n\nA: This might be overkill for what you want,  but following the directions here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Postfix\nand literally just copy pasting all commands and following the directions carefully should get you there.\nI run 12.04 on three different systems and have set all of them up this way - i've had zero problems with mail().\nI'm still a bit of a newbie at this, so like i said - it might be overkill for what you need.  Hope it helps though.\n\nA: Check php config file and try to use simple sendmail instead of postfix.\n", "Q: How to add Landscape monitoring to machine 0 in juju The Juju Landscape charm supports adding relations to services, but there is no visible service in machine 0 to add a relation to.

Please help me.\n\nA: The error can mean 2 things depending on what file you downloaded. In the normal sense, when users download a file not ending with .gz it means the file is not a gzip format.\nThe other case is when the downloaded file is corrupted. I took my time to download the http://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.4/tarball/  file and it works with the line you are mentioning so it must mean the file was downloaded and somehow got corrupted. Download the file again. \nJust to add that I had a problem about a year ago, similar to this, it was a memory problem. One of the memory slots was damaged (Memtest verified this). This is of course an extreme case, but wanted to mention it just in case.\nWhat I would suggest is to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download file like this: wget http://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.4/tarball/ -O Django-1.4.tar.gz\n(No double quotes, just in case when copied from a website, they were the bbcode double codes and not the common ones used in the terminal)\n\n*Decompress like you mentioned: tar xzvf Django-1.4.tar.gz\nSee if that works.\n\nA: From https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3950839/tar-error-is-not-recoverable-exiting-now\nmv Doctrine-1.2.0.tgz Doctrine-1.2.0.tar.gz\ngunzip Doctrine-1.2.0.tar.gz\ntar xf Doctrine-1.2.0.tar\n\n\nA: Please forget about running setup.py from source!\nUse pip to install Python packages. It's so much easier and preferred over easy_install / setup.py (Why use pip over easy_install?).\nIt's as easy as:\n\n*\n\n*Install pip by installing the Ubuntu package: python-pip \n\n\n*Install any package from PyPI like this:\n sudo pip install Django\n\nDone.

I just wanted to know if there is any option or if it is a flaw in Ubuntu.\nI've seen how to resume file using wget, but it is inconvenient because the link to the file has to be typed again.\nWhat to do if I've lost that link or server has changed it?\n\nA: To re-use a command, use your ↑ key while on the terminal. Just make sure that the you added the option -c to the download command:\nwget -c http://link/to/download.file\n\nAs explained by @TheLordofTime in his comment, if the server changes the address, it is unlikely that any program will adjust itself accordingly.\nOn the bright side, if the link address has changed, you can run\nwget -c http://new/link/to/download.file\n\nand the download will continue getting the partially-downloaded file.\n\nA: If all you have is the file, without knowing where you got it, then you'd need more than a download manager to resume it. You'd need software that heuristically analyzed the contents of the partial file you have, searched for the file (which would probably be very difficult), downloaded pieces of possible candidates (it wouldn't even start out knowing the proper length for the file, after all, so only by guessing and checking could it figure out what file to download), and eventually download the rest of your file most of the time.\nNo such utility exists. And no such utility is likely to be developed, because even if you've forgotten a lot, as the person who originally decided to download the file, you fundamentally know more about where to look for it than anyone else, including any artificial intelligence.\nSo, the real-world solution in your situation is for you to search for the file, applying whatever knowledge you have to find what you believe to be the download link for it (or some other download link, if this is a file that is hosted in multiple places).\n\nA: wget -c, would solve your problem.\nIf you really want a GUI client, try Fat Rat.

I want to install MySQL and create a database on it using the following code:\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\nmysqladmin -h localhost -u {username} -p create lrs\n\nI get the following message after executing the second line:\n    Enter password:\n    mysqladmin: connect to server at 'localhost' failed\n    error: 'Access denied for user '{username}'@'localhost' (using password: YES)'\n\nWhat is the problem?\n\nA: After you've installed MySQL, you need to set mysql root password. To do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter the next command in a terminal:\nmysql -u root\n\n*Now it should open the mysql console. And type the following line:\nSET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('yourpassword');\nTo exit from the mysql console enter exit.\nNow you should create the database with the root user. To do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open mysql from terminal:\nmysql -u root -p\n\n*Enter the password created before.\n\n*Enter the following line:\nCREATE DATABASE yourdatabasename;\nIf you enter SHOW DATABASES; you should see it in the list. If so, you have a database ready to use!\n\nA: You need to connect to MySQL using the root user and associated password. If you need to set them, use the following command: sudo mysqladmin -u root -h localhost password 'mypassword'\nFrom there, you can configure additional accounts by following this document: How to Create a New User and Grant Permissions in MySQL \n\nA: This is strange because since 12.04 (guessing you're running Kubuntu 12.04), MySQL has been default. Looks like you're missing a few steps in between, so let's look over this:\nFirst, as you mentioned, let's do an installation,\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\n\nAfter you installed it, let's try a little test,\nsudo netstat -tap | grep mysql\n\nWhen you run this, you should see this reply,\ntcp        0      0 localhost:mysql         *:*                LISTEN      2556/mysqld\n\nIf this is not running correctly, run this restart command,\nsudo service mysql restart\n\nNow to configure the server.\nLet's go to /etc/mysql/my.cnf to configure the basic settings. This includes the Log File, Port Number, Etc. For example, to configure MySQL to listen for connections from network hosts, change the bind-address directive to the server's IP address:\nbind-address            = 192.168.0.5\n\nAfter this, restart the MySQL daemon,\nsudo service mysql restart\n\nIf you want to change the MySQL root password, run this:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server-5.5\n\nThe daemon will be stopped and you'll be prompted for a new password.\nOnce you're done, you should be configured and a few google searches will teach you how to create a database\nSource: The Ubuntu Server Guide\n\nA: Run this command:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server-5.5\n\n(5.5 is the version number, adapt if you have a different version)\nThis will allow you to set your MySQL root password, that you can then use with mysqladmin and mysql commands.\n\nA: After you've installed MySQL, you need to set mysql root password. To do so:\nEnter the next command in a terminal:\n\nmysql -u root -p\n\nEnter Password: (Enter your password here).\n\n\nA: I know this is 3 years old but I just had this problem as well and wanted to post my answer in case anyone else does the same search I did.\nmysqladmin: connect to server at 'localhost' failed\nThis indicates that your user doesn't have permission to connect to the database itself, before it even gets to logging in; not the database user, your actual linux user.  Run everything as super user: sudo mysql -u root -p\nOnly root (the linux user, or a user with sudo privileges) can log in to mysql as root (the database user).  I wasn't able to find anywhere documenting this but experimentation proved it was the case.  You can create a new user with all the same rights as the root user and that will not be restricted.\nsudo mysql -u root\nSET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('yourpassword');\nCREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'newuser'@'localhost';\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\nNow \"newuser\" (or whatever name you choose) can be logged-in-as without the need for sudo and you can use it for all your database administrative needs.\n", "Q: GUI broken after update to 12.10 I updated to Ubuntu 12.10 using the Update Manager in Ubuntu. (\"A new version is available ...\")\nGRUB was broken and I think I managed to fix this but still the Graphical output looks super weired: (The Unity sidebar is lost and I had to start firefox through the terminal [STRG]+[ALT]+[T])\n\nI already tried some apt-get with fglrx, gdm & ubuntu-desktop but nothing changed.\nGraphics card: Mobility Radeon HD 2600\n\nA: Your graphics card is no longer officialy supported. You have these options:\na) Use 12.04 with fglrx (precise x and kernel stack)\nb) Use 12.10 with OSS drivers\nc) Use PPA for 12.10 that enables fglrx installation to 12.10 with old AMD graphics\nIf you'll choose option c, follow this:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:makson96/fglrx\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install fglrx-legacy\nsudo reboot\n\nAMD decided to put all its graphics cards without DirectX11 support to \"Legacy\" state. This means they aren't going to add support for new xserver and linux kernel versions. PPA mentioned above installs git version of xserver, which is fully compatible with legacy fglrx and patched fglrx for compatibility with Quantal Linux kernel.\n", "Q: How can I play metal Slug or The King of Fighters(KOF) 2002 in ubuntu I use ubuntu 12.04. I want to play Metal Slug and KOF 2002 in my ubuntu. What should I do to install those games in my pc?\nPlease show in detail; I have never played such games in pc.\n\nA: Assuming by \"Metal Slug\" you're referring to one or more of the side-scrollers, they should work fine with Wine ...at least if it's version 1.0. See this Wine AppDB page. Here are the details. The testing is pretty old but since it worked very well then, the same software will most likely work well in Wine in Ubuntu now. Test it and see!\nI haven't found information in the AppDB for KOF 2002 or King of Fighters 2002. But you may want to search yourself, in case I'm missing something. Especically if you know another name for the software. Anyway, you can try it and see.\nAssuming you have the Windows versions of these games, just install Wine (see also this documentation), then run the installers like you would on Windows. If you can't run them by double-clicking on them, then right-click on them and click Wine Windows Program Loader. (If you don't see that, then you might need to click Open With and fine Wine or Wine Windows Program Loader.)\n\nA: You can use MAME instruction : \nAdd the main repository for unofficial builds:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:c.falco/mame\n\n(optionally) add the repository for \"u\"(nstable) builds:\n(Skip this step to stick with main, stable, not-\"u\" releases!)\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:c.falco/umame\n\nNow update the information on your box:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nFinally install the package from the repository:\nsudo apt-get install mame\n\n", "Q: Why can't I resume my Compaq 615 machine?

You can free up disk space by removing unused programs or files, or by moving files to another disk or partition.\n\nThis doesn't really make sense to us.  We're having something of a hard time figuring out which drive we're looking at when we look in the file system, but when we look at the drive bookmarked / which we thought was the solid state drive and then go into boot we see not very many files that are not very big - certainly not 120 gigs worth. \nAbout the drives: When we bought the computer about a month ago, we had the company install Ubuntu.  They made the 120 gigabyte solid state drive the boot drive as per our request.  The 3 T drive seemed to be mounted, but the folks who installed Ubuntu did not make the 3 Terabyte drive visible to us and we were denied permissions to view it until I used the fix I mentioned in my original message above so as to be able to save to the drive.  (I still seem to be denied permission to view the \"Lost and Found\" folder though.) Then I copied the files I'd saved on the solid state drive to the 3 T drive and deleted the files I'd saved from the solid state drive to free up room.  The solid state drive still has lots of room on it (as of course does the other one).\nFrom what we can tell, the software and updates that get error messages seem to actually be getting installed (I don't know if correctly) but generate long error messages each time. Is it trying to install to both disks or something like that and generating an error message because the 3 T drive wasn't installed/mounted correctly?\nSo sorry for any ignorance we're showing.  I'm trying to learn all this, but still don't really understand the file system very well and certainly am an Ubuntu newbie.\nUPDATE April 12, 2013: Hi, Nikki. Thanks so much for trying to help us.

Hi guys I installed ubuntu 12.04 (x32) on my system and then side by side I had my windows7 ultimate(x64) running aswell (dual boot).\nLast week for some reason I started getting a blue screen crash after running an update on ubuntu. Blue screen said it has a crash with code bCC:0000145, I didnt know what to make of it hence I thought just erase the whole HDD and start over with a fresh copy of windows. \nAnd this where (I feel a major disaster struck, as i'm a noob i've no clue what i did was WRONG!!!) I got into a huge problem, when I put in the Windows OEM cd and set the comp to boot from cd it was going all fine untill I deleted all my partitions into unallocated space and then wanted to make new partions and start fresh - BAMM another blue screen of death.\nAnd this time after the blue screen it's stopped booting from Cd, and directly gave me an error message saying \"no such partition; grub rescue\" \nI've tried everything in my capacity to get it to work but I dont know clearly what to do further please help.\n\nA: Sounds like you installed grub on the master boot record. \nYou will need to run \n    fixmbr or fixboot \nfrom a windows 7 recovery command prompt (located under repair my computer on windows 7 install disc).

You can also tweak any other settings as needed from there, and they will stick through reboots - thus solving your issues in Windows.\n", "Q: Rhino 3D 5.0 64bit I would do anything to get Rhino 5 working on my Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS.\nFirst the extension of the file is .msi. I have tried using CrossOver to install it, but failed.\nI tried to install it using wine in Terminal:\nwine msiexec /i  rh50Release_x64_en-us_20120927_2230.msi\n\nYou see I am using Rhino 5 3D 64bit 27.9.2012. It started the installation then showed me this message: \n\n\nI would do anything to get it working.\n\nA: As the WineHQ report is not very helpful regarding Rhino, I thought I would share a way I found of getting it working. I am using the most recent development version of wine (1.5.26).\nPlease Note: I have tried the evaluation 32 bit version, but the method below should work with any version that is packed as an msi. You should be able to set up any license keys etc when you get the program running.\nIf the method described below does not work for you, you probably need to run a virtual Windows machine in Ubuntu and then there should be no problems.\n\nThe problem, as you know is the msi installer and not the actual program, as it works pretty well in wine (see screenshots below).\nYou can use several programs to extract msi files, but they all mess up the folder structure and leave cab files which need to be unpacked. The only program that does not do this is lessmsi, which allows you to load up the msi file and select all files to be extracted to a folder. (It must itself be run with wine.) There is still manual setup to be done (see further below), but when the program extracts the files it retains the folder structure specified by the msi installer.\n1) Download lessmsi and extract it to a folder, then run it with wine:\nwget \"https://lessmsi.googlecode.com/files/lessmsi-v1.0.10.zip\"\nunzip -d lessmsi lessmsi-v1.0.10.zip \ncd lessmsi\nwine lessmsi.exe\n\n2) Now, select your .msi file with lessmsi, open it, and wait a few moments until the list of contained files appears in the lessmsi interface (see screenshot below). Move to the 'extract' tab in the application and click select all at the bottom of the window. Don't worry if the actual window is blank. Then click the bottom right extract button and create a folder to store the files in and confirm to extract the files.\nA screenshot below of lessmsi so you can see the buttons I am talking about in the paragraph above. This is lessmsi being run with wine: the .msi file must be selected manually (see notes above); it does not automatically extract the msi.\n\n2.1) Alternatively, It is perhaps easier to use a command-line instead of all that explanation. You can select the location of your msi and pass that to wine. If you launch lessmsi from its containing folder, then the extracted msi will be in that folder also. When selecting locations with wine we usually use \"Z:/home/user/location/of/file\", as Z: is the default drive letter of your filesystem in wine. As an example, you could add the location of your file and make lessmsi extract it. So cd to the extracted lessmsi folder and run\nwine lessmsi x \"Z:/home/user/location/of/my.msi\" \n\n3) Next, find the folder with your extracted files: if it has gone to plan, the folder structure should be intact. It should be like this:\nYourfolder/\n          SourceDir/\n                    Rhinoceros\\ 5/ Win/ Windows/ McNeel/ \n\nIf you can't find your extracted folder, look for one called SourceDir.\nYour extracted folder might not be the same, but the structure should be intact: I did nothing with the McNeel folders, as it wasn't necessary for the version I tried.\n4) I recommend using a fresh wineprefix for running the program: see also my answer here for more information. Create one with\nWINEPREFIX=/home/user/.rhino winecfg\n\n(That will throw the wine settings manager up as well: click to dismiss it.)\n5) Now, cd to the rhino directory and make sure you are in the rhino system directory (SourceDir/Rhinoceros 5.0/System) that contains the exe before you run the command launching it from your wineprefix:\nenv WINEPREFIX=/home/user/.rhino wine Rhino4.exe\n\nIt didn't seem necessary to install any runtime libraries (such as vcrun2005) or copy any other dlls contained in the msi to the windows folder, but if you have any problems use winetricks to install any other runtimes.\nThe Rhino 5 folder can be moved to your wineprefix or left where it is, but you may need to place the Plug-ins elsewhere. However, you can point rhino to the path of the plugins and manually install them as you need them from rhino > tools > options > plugins.\nMiscellaneous Notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remember to always run rhino by specifying your wineprefix, as shown above (or by creating a launcher for it). \n\n*If you get an error popup after launching rhino with wine, click ok and the program will continue to startup.\n\n*If you get an error while running the program about the default render plugin, you can set the current renderer by going to render > current renderer  and click rhino render.\n\n*The command winetricks dlls list will list the runtime libraries available to install with winetricks if you feel you are missing a runtime library.\n\n*There may be other tweaking that you need to do, and you will be more familiar with rhino than me, but this article should give a you a start in running it on Ubuntu.\nHere is my own desktop showing Rhinoceros running on Xubuntu 12.04.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server - How to connect to wireless WPA2 personal network? Connecting to the wireless is relatively simple.\nAfter some struggle, you have wifi in your installer. You can install Ubuntu Server and everything is alright. You are ready to boot your new system.  \nAfter setup finished, wifi settings disappeared.\ntl;dr: How do I connect to a wireless (WPA2 Personal) network from Ubuntu Server 12.10? \nWhat I have tried so far:\nConnected with iw* commands. Obtained IP address with dhclient. Put these commands to etc/rc.local.\nOn boot, the server waits 120 seconds with message \"Waiting for network to come up\"\nTo fix this, I removed everything /etc/network/interfaces (wpa-psk and wpa-ssid).\nThis did not work. It was still waiting. I found an answer, which said I could just remove the /etc/... (the file that was in charge of the 120 second wait time.)  \nI did that, and kept a backup of it. Now the server waits ~3 seconds (modified sleep within the file) and boots up. However, there's no network connection available. It's some dhcp error.\nAs I was out of options, I tried using the one in comment. The one that used \"tee\".\nTurns out it does not work either.  \nHow can this whole thing be so inconsistent? How can they not install the firmwares on the ISO while it would perfectly fit (673+~10MB = 683). How can the installer NOT copy the necessary files and set up the connection to be used later? (Or ask if the user wants to use it.)\n\nA: I used instructions from https://wiki.debian.org/WiFi/HowToUse#WPA-PSK_and_WPA2-PSK.\nDon't forget to remove anything you added in etc/rc.local as it could conflict\nFirst, make sure you have installed (can't remember if its installed by default or not) the package \"wpasupplicant\"\nThen you need to edit the \"/etc/network/interfaces\" file.\nThe stanza used was based on the example from the above link (reproduced below):\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet dhcp\n    wpa-ssid mynetworkname\n    wpa-psk mysecretpassphrase\n\nYou will need to check which interface your Wifi card is (its usually wlan0) and you need the key and ssid of your wireless network.\n\nA: 1) Install the package wpasupplicant.\n2) Then write:\nsudo su\nwpa_passphrase [SSID] >> /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf\nexit\n\nWhere [SSID] is SSID of point where you want to connect.

How can I prevent Unity from handling Alt+F1?\n\nA: You'll need the CompizConfig Settings Manager (which you can install via the Software Center).\nOnce open, click on Ubuntu Unity Plugin (in the Desktop section). Under the Behavior tab, you'll see Key to put keyboard-focus on launcher. Simply change the keybinding there.\nNote that in later versions of the Unity plugin, the tabs in that plugin have changed (as the comment below by Carlton mentions). The Key to put keyboard-focus on launcher stting is now under the Launcher tab.\n\n\n\nA: The above answer works for me on 12.04LTS Unity 3D. If it's not working for you I wonder, are you using Unity 2D?  If so you may not be able to change settings with CCSM.\nIn any case see here for several alternative fixes (the question is for 11.10 but many of these still work in 12.04): \nHow do I deactivate F1 and F10 keybindings in gnome-terminal?\nIf CCSM is not working for you, you might try the gconf-editor fix (or alternatively dconf)\nCommentary: It's really too bad that this particular keybinding can't be changed simply through the system settings interface, as most others can.  I haven't heard that this has been changed in 12.10 but I hope it is in the future.  Far too many programs use Alt-keybindings for the OS to make it so difficult to change.  (And I'm pretty sure Emacs mapped that keyboard real estate first, Ubuntu.)\n", "Q: How to restart WiFi connection? I think I do not have problem with hardware. Sometimes the WiFi connection simply disconnects, apparently. So this is not necessarily the same as this case, I might not need to reload any modules.\nBut how to just restart wlan0? I tried restart network-manager, but this seems to leave wlan0 alone.\n\nA: \"Reload the Driver\"\nFind the module name\nLet's find the name of the kernel module for your wireless connection:\nsudo hwinfo --network\n\n(Install package hwinfo if you don't have it.)\nLook for the module name in the \"Driver\" line.\nReload the module\nNow unload then re-load the module.\nFor example, my module name is iwlwifi\nYou might get lucky with no error message, in which case you can immediately reload it with\n$ sudo modprobe iwlwifi\n\nbut most probably you will get this failure message:\n$ sudo modprobe -r iwlwifi\nmodprobe: FATAL: Module iwlwifi is in use.\n\nSo we go looking for other modules using iwlwifi:\n$ lsmod |grep iwlwifi\niwlwifi               241664  1 iwldvm\ncfg80211              765952  4 iwldvm,iwlwifi,mac80211,rtl8187\n\nOn the left is the module name, and on the right are the other modules using it.\nSo let's try disabling iwldvm first:\n$ sudo modprobe -r iwldvm\n\nIf this works, then we can now successfully disable iwlwifi\n$ sudo modprobe -r iwlwifi\n\nAnd now re-enable both modules in the reverse order:\n$ sudo modprobe iwlwifi\n$ sudo modprobe iwldvm\n\nDone!\nThis is the only procedure that worked for me in resetting low level settings (frag, rate) that I had set using iwconfig.\nWhat it does effectively is \"reload the driver\".\n\nA: You could try killing the power to your device. Assuming you are unable/unwilling to physically disconnect the device, you should run (as root): iwconfig wlan0 txpower off. I would then wait 10-15 seconds to make sure whatever hardware issue has caused the problem has been stopped, then: iwconfig wlan0 txpower auto.\nOr, you can simply run rfkill and block/unblock your device. To do so, run rfkill block wifi, followed by rfkill unblock wifi. This second option should be faster, since you only need to wait 2-3 seconds between commands, as opposed to 10-15 seconds. In fact, on my machine, I don't need to wait at all, although I suspect this depends on your WiFi hardware. This option can also be done as a regular user, no root needed.\nYou can also restart NetworkManager. If you use systemctl as your init system (as is the case with newer versions of Ubuntu), you can use systemctl restart NetworkManager. Otherwise, you can use sudo initctl restart network-manager. If you don't know what init system you use, try both commands and see what works.\n\nA: These don't need root, in case you are scripting:\nnmcli networking off \nnmcli networking on\n\nFor more do: man nmcli\nEDIT: \nAs these guys are saying in the comments, for WI-FI only:\nnmcli radio wifi off\nnmcli radio wifi on\n\n\nA: Created a script based on prior link advice with some mixing & matching of prior links. This works for me running under Mint Linux 17.3.\nThe file below does not require root access.\nIt also only restarts wifi only if it is already down.\nNow I just need to add this script to a cron job to check my wifi connection every 15 minutes or so.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwlan=$(/sbin/ifconfig wlan0 | grep inet\\ addr | wc -l)\nif [ $wlan -eq 0 ]; then\nnmcli nm wifi on\nelse\necho \"interface is up\"\nfi\n\n\nA: Try this:\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 down\nsudo ifconfig wlan0 up\n\n\nA: You just need to restart Network Manager:\nsudo service NetworkManager restart\n\nBefore Ubuntu 20.10:\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\n\nA: As @TSJNachos117 mentions in their comment, for versions from 15.04 onwards, Ubuntu switched to systemd as the service manager. So, one can use the following command, equivalent to the one in Radu Rădeanu's answer, to restart the Network Manager service:\nsudo systemctl restart NetworkManager\n\n\nA: The workaround using \"systemctl restart NetworkManager\" works for me on two different notebooks with Broadcom and Atheros WiFi under Debian Buster and Ubuntu 19.04 - where the problem with \"wifi won't wake up on resume\" happens on every fourth resume or so (= it typically works just fine.)\nI've first tried creating a desktop launcher to invoke the wifi reset manually, which works, and requires a password - but then I found several notes by people putting the reset curse into places in the system that run scripts after resume. Namely, /lib/systemd/system-sleep/ looks like a good place to put your script. And, the script should better test some conditions (obtained via cmdline arguments) to know that it's the right time to reset the NetworkManager. Apologies for linking instead of cutting and pasting - I haven't asked this particular author's permission, and he may enjoy upvotes too, for his YouTube contribution (straight to the point, and well narrated).\nOther than that, I've noticed some very simple and direct solutions to the original problem from Ubuntu 16.04: wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=no in NetworkManager.conf or even just apt-get update && apt-get upgrade . Those are the optimal solution to the particular bug in 16.04. They possibly are not a solution to other misc problems of this kind, that can be worked around by the heavy-handed (but fairly swift) restart of NetworkManager on every resume from suspend.\n", "Q: switcheroo to discrete turns off backlight on laptop screen AMD cedar/ Intel ironlake hybrid graphics. Custom kernel 3.8.3. Free radeon xorg drivers.\nWhen I switch from integrated to discrete, I do a killall lightdm and X doesn't automatically respawn like it does under my official ubuntu 3.2 kernel. So I have to sudo lightdm from another vterm. And then, I have NO BACKLIGHT. I can't see my LCD unless I have the sun shining on it. And if I connect it to HDMI tv, I get the tv picture okay and can fanagle to control it from there. But if I set mirroring screens, still no backlight, so I can't see what my laptop is (or is not) displaying.\n\nA: I know it doesn't solve my problem by fixing it. \nIt appears to be a kernel bug that is new since at least 3.7.

Can anyone help\nI think windows 8 is in there but I do not know how to access it\n\nA: I would suggest you to use disk utility to verify if you still have the partition where you installed windows 8 or if you have formatted windows 8 partition. If disk utility is not available among you apps, you can download it from software centre.\nIf windows 8 partition does not exist, then you will have to install windows 8 or if your system have build in recovery or restore tool, you can restore back windows 8.

Ok, so, Ubuntu sounds awesome, but I heard it has Wine on it already? If it does, that's awesome. If not, well, I like Wine. Also, this is basically a version of Linux, correct? I just wanted to know if this stuff is correct or not. Thanks for the help!\n\nA: Linux is the kernel that Ubuntu and many other operating systems use. Operating systems that use Linux as their kernel and use it with the most common libraries and tools (for example, GNU libc) are called Linux distributions or GNU/Linux distributions.\nConfusingly, while Linux is a kernel, the term Linux is also sometimes used to refer to Linux-based operating systems (i.e., \"Linux distributions\"), or to refer to their shared characteristics that some people consider to comprise an operating system (of which all Linux distributions, also called GNU/Linux distributions, can be considered parallel variations). The term GNU/Linux also refers to this (and is not the name of a kernel).\nAll the above terms are widely considered correct, though all of them are also considered wrong by a few people here and there. You can read about the naming controversies if you like. During the ordinary course or using and talking about operating systems and kernels, they usually don't get in the way too much and most of the time terms are widely understood however they are used, from context.\nAs you may be aware, Wine is an emulation layer that provides an infrastructure running Windows programs. Many Windows programs run well on Wine, but also plenty run poorly or not at all. Wine runs on a wider variety of platforms than \"Linux\" systems. It runs on GNU/Linux distributions like Ubuntu, but also on other Unix-like systems, such as FreeBSD and Mac OS X.\nUbuntu does not come with Wine installed by default, but you can install it easily. Wine is officially packaged for Ubuntu and Wine in Ubuntu is maintained officially by the Ubuntu community (it is provided through Ubuntu's official software sources). Just open the Software Center, type in Wine, and install it when given the option to do so.\nWine is provided by the wine  package. You can also install it by running:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install wine\n\nIf you want to install the latest version of wine, see these instructions and/or this question. The Wine PPA should be pretty safe but it's a good idea to read these guidelines before using it or any other PPAs.\n\nA: \nI don't really know if this is the right place to ask these questions \n\nYes, this is the right place to ask such question(s), despite someone down-voting the question. \n\nI heard it has Wine on it already? \n\nNo, Ubuntu does not have Wine pre-installed. You can install it from the Ubuntu Software Center or in a terminal with: \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install wine\n\nNote: I would recommend looking for alternate native applications similar to (and mostly even better than) Windows applications instead of installing an emulation platform like Wine. For example, you could use Gimp in place of Photoshop. Libre Office is an open source office suite with which you can completely forget MS Office (you can open/edit/convert MS Office documents on the fly). There are several games too. I am an information technology services, systems and resources integrator using Ubuntu since 2010 and haven't felt the need for Wine yet. \n\nthis is basically a version of Linux, correct? \n\nNo, Ubuntu is not a Linux version, but a Linux distribution from Canonical Ltd. You can know more about Ubuntu here.\n", "Q: Removing default user data I saw a post ages ago about how to remove the default user data that comes with the preview of Ubuntu touch and now I can find it.

During work on my home pc, I accidentally made the following command:\nsudo chmod -R o+x /home\n\nI want to know if it's dangerous to open access for other users and, if so, how can I revert it?\n\nA: \nThis question originally asked about sudo chmod o+x /home and\n  not sudo chmod -R o+x /home. This answer pertains to that version. This was then re-asked, for the recursive (-R) version\n  of the command. Subsequently this question was edited, and more\n  answers were posted. I've left this answer with the intention that it\n  may be helpful to others who perform non-recursive chmod\n  operations on /home.\n\nThe command chmod o+x /home gives others--that is, people who don't own /home and aren't in its \"group owner\" either--execute permissions on /home.\nFor a folder, execute permissions means something special--it means you can go into the directory and attempt to access files inside it.\n/home has o+x set by default. The command you ran changed nothing. /home has to allow \"others\" to access files inside because it contains all the machine's human users' home directories, and *none of those users is /home's owner or a member of its group owner!\nTherefore, you don't have to worry about anything. Furthermore, attempting to \"fix\" this will break your system. If you were to remove the executable bit for \"others\" on /home, then no user would be able to access their own home directory. The system would be rendered unusable. You would have to enter recovery mode or boot from a live CD/DVD/USB to fix it. (And the way you'd fix it would be to run a command like what you ran before. Except this time it would have an effect.)\nIf you have already attempted to \"fix\" this and broken your system, and you need help fixing it, I recommend posting a new question asking for help. After all, that's a different questions from this one.\n\nA: In case you ran the command recursively, as sudo chmod -R o+x /home you have allowed every user who is not the owner and not a member of the group the file/folder belongs to, to 'open' all directories under /home. This is considered a security risk since it allows everyone to obtain file and folder listing, which might reveal some information (or the existence of it).\nFurthermore, if you have any scripts inside /home, they become executable by others. This can be a security risk depending on the situation. If any of the scripts have set uid or set gid bits set, then this is surely a security risk, the intensity of which depends on the script contents. It is a severe security risk if you also have both setuid bit and other writable bit (o+w) set since any user will be able to perform tasks as you. (Previlige escalation)\nIn case you do not have any executable files that need to be executable by 'others' under /home (which is a common case unless the user installs something under home or has placed some executables otherwise), you can revert this by doing sudo chmod -R o-x /home/*\nDo note the /home/* instead of /home since /home needs o+x for the system to function propery.\nThis will remove the executable bit for 'others' from every file and folder inside /home.\n\nA: + adds, - takes away.   Try:\nsudo chmod -R o-x /home/*\n\nto recursively remove x permission from others for each subfolder (but not /home/ itself).  \nIf you use -X (or +X) instead of the usual lower-case x, it affects only:\n\n\n*\n\n*directories (so you don't accidentally change permissions on non-directory files), and\n\n*files with the x permission set for anyone (that is, for user, group, and/or other)\n\n\nSee also ... the man page.\n", "Q: how to dual boot the ubuntu and windows 7 again?(after install ubuntu) i have problem with dual booting windows and ubuntu...\ni had windows 7 then i installed ubuntu 12.4. \nubuntu installed side by side windows and everything worked just fine..\nthen i decide to install ubuntu 12.10. i didn't upgrade it from update manager . i reinstalled it from boot.and in the installation i chose (something else)...and i deleted swap and root and boot partition and recreate all of it. after install, windows does not come up. i dont know how bring it up.\nis there software like easy bcd for ubuntu? i want my windows 7 back.i want both of them side by side like before.\n\nA: If you have not deleted or somehow damaged your Windows partition, you should be able to see Windows 7 again on your Grub menu if you install and run the famous Boot-Repair utility:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair\nboot-repair\n\n", "Q: Installing ubuntu on a non activated version of windows My version of windows 8 isn't activated and I want to install ubuntu, from a USB-stick. When I'm in the install setup it asks me to select my operating system, but I don't have one, so it says it will clear the whole drive. What exactly does that mean?\n\nA: The Ubuntu installer does not see any operating system(s) on your hard disc(s) so it will advice to format the disc (wipe the disc and format it to ext4 if you choose ext4) and then to use the whole disc to install Ubuntu.\nOnly if you want to save anything that is currently on the disc you might want to back that up; but as you said: there is not OS yet.\nSo nothing to worry about :)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 Installer Can't Detect My On-Board Network Interface Currently installing Ubuntu 12.04.2 Server and I get an error saying it can't detect my network interface device.\nMy board is Gigabyte Z77MX-D3H-TH.\nThe installer allows me to continue though.

How can I do this most quickly?\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no menu element or dialog that lets you do this in Evince, but you can use a combination of the mouse and the keyboard to do it.\n1) Go to your starting point and left-click the mouse. If you drag down while keeping the mouse button pressed, you will start highlighting. You can also start highlighting by pressing the down arrow.\n2) To select hundreds of pages, keep the mouse button pressed and press and hold the down arrow. You can move hundreds of pages in a few seconds.\n3) Watch the table of contents on the left (if the doc has one). When you are near your destination, keep the mouse button pressed but let go of the down arrow. \nWarning: It may take several seconds for the display of the selection on the screen to catch up. Be sure to keep the mouse button down until you see your selection. \nYou probably won't be exactly where you need to be, you can use the arrow keys to adjust the selection as long as you don't let go of the mouse button.\n", "Q: My TouchPad is not responding on an Acer Aspire E1-471-6650 I recently bought an Acer Aspire E1-471-6650 and I already have problems.

Imagine you are in your home directory but want to list /etc. Just run ls /etc and you will get it listed.\n\nA: ls will do this.\nThe syntax for ls is:\n ls flags file-or-directory-names\nFor what I'm calling file-or-directory-names, you can list files in the current directory, to have just certain files listed. For example, ls -l foo bar will list information on just foo and bar (in long form, as I've given the -l flag). ls baz*go will list all files whose names start with baz and end with go (if any).\nBut when you give a directory name to ls, it lists the contents of that directory instead of the current directory.\nSo, to list the contents of /var/log, you would simply run:\nls /var/log\n\nIf you give a relative path for the directory--that is, one that doesn't start with a /--then it will look for that directory inside the current directory (just as it looks for files). But it will still list the contents of the directory, as you want.\nAs a side note, sometimes you might find you don't want to list the contents of a directory, but just list the directory the same as a file would be listed. To do this, you can pass the -d flag. For example, this shows /var/log in long form (not its contents, but /var/log itself):\nls -ld /var/log\n\n\nA: Having seen the accepted answer, I was still not satisfied. How did Daniel know the solution? You bet I have read the manpage myself and still couldn't figure out how.\nThe man page of ls reads:\n\nDescription: List  information  about  the FILEs (the current directory by default)...\n\nNothing useful there. Then I checked POSIX Programmer's Manual:\n\nFor each operand that names a file of type directory, ls shall write the names of files contained within the directory as well as any requested, associated information.\n\nThis line explains the behavior of the command in the accepted solution. The FILE operand of ls CAN be a directory, and ls will list the content of that directory. Exactly what the OP wanted. BUT the implementation on Linux may differ from the specification here. So we are on the right track but not there yet.\nThen I searched for the manual of GNU coreutils package, which ls is a part of. Here is what I found:\n\nFor non-option command-line arguments that are directories, by default ls lists the contents of directories ...\n\nThis explains it.\n", "Q: not getting dual boot grub menu ubuntu12.04.2 64 bit with pre-installed windows7 64-bit I have pre-installed windows 7 64 bit on Lenovo G580 and then i want to install Ubuntu 12.04.2 64 bit for android sourcecode compilation.\nwhile installing windows i partitioned HD into 3 drives c-100 GB D-197 GB G-176GB.\nI installed ubuntu on D drive with \"something else\"  option after successfully installed Ubuntu 12.04.2 finally it will ask restart.\nhere it's come problem instead of showing dual boot menu windows starting ....\ncould you please suggest me .. how to get dual boot menu to choose which opearting system to start...\nCan anyone tell me how to check whether my laptop supports 64 bit or not?\nThen\nI tried installing Ubuntu 12.04.2 using VMware here i am getting the following errors:\nA dialog with message :\nBinary translation is incompatible with long mode on this platform.

To boot your computer from USB drive, there are mainly 2 steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install your desired OS on the USB drive - To do this there are plenty of softwares like; UNetbootin, USB Image Writer etc.\n\n*Boot your computer with that USB drive - To do this you need to change your boot up options from BIOS. At first enter your bios setting by pressing DEL or F2. Change your First bootable device to your USB drive. Now insert your USB drive and reboot your computer.\n\n\nA: Using your LiveCD\nPut the Ubuntu CD into the CD/DVD-drive and reboot the computer. You should see a menu with \"Try Ubuntu without any change to your computer\" at the top. If you don't get this menu, read the booting From the CD guide for more information. Ubuntu Doc\nWhen installing or trying the LiveCD version of Ubuntu from a DVD, your computer has to be able to boot from that DVD. Usually this consists of just inserting the disk into your DVD drive and rebooting your computer. Sometimes though this doesn't work, or just not as expected or planned. Here are some common problems and how to fix them.\nBIOS is not set to boot from CD or DVD drive\nThis should be as simple as entering the BIOS, enable booting from the CD-ROM drive, and making sure that the CD-ROM is before the hard drive in the boot order.\nThe most common way to enter the BIOS is to press the DELETE key when the computer is first booted(this seems to be becoming standard). On other systems it could be a different key, or combination of keys like ESC, F1, F2, F10, F12, Ctrl-Esc, Alt-Esc, Ctrl-Alt-Esc, Ctrl-Alt-Enter, Ins or even others. You might have to press, press and hold, or press multiple times. The best way to find out the details of that is to look in the users manual or search the manufactures website. A few different Bios screens.\nA common power-on BIOS screen(notice the 'press DEL for setup' message)\n\nA typical BIOS boot menu screen\n\nPC requires you to hold down or press a key to boot from CD\nSome computers require you to hold down or press a key to enable booting from the CD drive, the best place to find this information is in your computers user manual or the manufactures website. Here are some common keys to try if you lack that information.\nApple Computers and others: Hold down the C key while rebooting. Toshiba, IBM and others: press F12 while booting to get to the boot menu and choose CD-ROM. Asus and others: press TAB key while booting and select CD-ROM from boot menu.\n\nCD/DVD drive can't boot in AHCI/Raid mode\nA large number of CD/DVD drives have problems running under AHCI/Raid mode (from not working at all to refusing to boot).\nEither plug drive into another SATA port that isn't set to AHCI/Raid or if that can't be done go into BIOS and set mode of SATA ports to IDE/Compatibility mode.\n(WARNING: if your Boot drive is plugged into same group of ports it may fail to boot after change(and obviously any Raid arrays will fail also)).\nMultiple CD/DVD drives in your computer\nSome computers will only allow booting from one CD or DVD drive even though you have 2 or more CD/DVD drives. So try the disk in each of the drives while rebooting the computer.\nBIOS does not have the option of booting from CD/DVD drive\nSome manufacturers provide BIOS updates that can correct this issue. For a BIOS update, please check with the manufacturer.\nA workaround is available if you can read from your CD-ROM drive, but can not boot from it. You may be able to use the SmartBootManager on a floppy disk to force your computer to boot from the CD-ROM drive.\nCD drive not capable of booting a CD (older drives)\nSome drives are just too old and do not support booting and will require you to:\nPurchase or borrow a newer CD-ROM drive.\nUse the SmartBootManager to boot from the CD-ROM drive.\nUbuntu Doc\n\nA: I suggest that you try unetbootin (http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net).

So time by time more functions will be added and the developer will get a better and more complete basis system in order to test their applications and to test the whole system.\nThis is an imminent prerequisite for the application developer therfore it would not make sense for canonical to continue working on the system somewhere behind closed doors and finally come out with a final release.\nSo at the end the Developer Preview will be the final release or at least very similar to that. \n", "Q: Am I using the Nouveau driver or the proprietary NVIDIA driver?

I have no backup of partition, so I think this command is not reversible. SO me to reinstall whole system because of this mistake?\n\nA: The best way to fix this depends on details of how your system is set up. Fortunately, you probably know these details.\nOn files, +x means they can be run like a program. (Actually, it confers the permission to try. If they're not actual executable binaries or script files with a hashbang line, this will still fail.)\nOn directories (that is, folders), the +x permission means something else. Executable permissions on a folder confers the ability to enter into the folder and its subfolders (though its subfolders may not have the necessary permissions for this), and to attempt to access files inside the folder (the files may or may not have permissions that allow this to succeed).\nThis was o+x. o stands for other. That controls the permissions of users who don't own the file or folder, and also who are not members of the file or folder's \"group owner.\"\nIf You Don't Currently Use Permissions To Share Files With Other Local Users\nIf a user (say, you) doesn't need to share files with other users, then it's safe to take away executable permissions for other, so long as you only do it everywhere inside your home folder. Your home folder is /home/username where username is replaced with your actual username. /home is not itself your home folder, but rather is the folder that contains all the home folders. Since /home itself is not actually owned by any human user of the computer, it is imperative that executable permissions for other not be removed from /home itself.\nSo, you can run:\ncd ~\n\n~ represents your home folder. (The shell interprets it as that, you can type exactly that.)\nThen you can run:\nchmod -R o-x .* *\n\nOr if you want to prevent others from changing directory into your home folder itself as well:\nchmod -R o-x ~\n\nIt's intentional that I haven't written sudo. You still own the files in your home folder, so you don't need sudo, and leaving it off will help to avoid changing permissions on the wrong files and folders by accident. (In particular, /home is owned by root, so by leaving off sudo, you make sure you're not accidentally changing the permissions for /home and making your system unusable.)\nIf You Do Currently Use Permissions To Share Files With Other Local Users\nIf you have some folders that you do share with other users on the machine (if you do, then you almost certainly know you do), then you can use the above method and then manually add executable permissions on those particular folders. But if you have too many for this to be practical, then especially if you're not worried about other users accessing things that they're not supposed to, you might want to just take away executable permissions from files, and not from folders. After doing this, you can then selectively take executable permissions away from some folders, of course.\nTo take away executable permissions for other from all the files in your own user's home folder, but not the directories, run:\nfind ~ -type f -exec chmod o-x \\{\\} \\;\n\n(You will note that this is similar to one of SEngstrom's suggestions. See man find for information about how this works.)\n\nA: You just changed file permissions on all user files to executable (and directories to searchable, which is default) for all users - probably not what you want but also probably not the end of the world - especially if you are the only user on the machine.\nOne think you could do is to do a find on document directories and turn that executable flag off for regular files if it bothers you there.\nIf the system is fresh I might consider a re-install just to get it nice and clean :)\n", "Q: messed up with mount and naming a partition - delete a folder in file system I have a partition /dev/sda8 which I want to name it \"Documents\" and automount.\nBecause I have a long time to use these commands ,I messed up a little (not that I am familiar).\nI used gparted and gave a label \"Documents\" for the partition.\nThen , I don't remember exact the order of the commands I used ,but sth like:\nsudo mount -L Documents /dev/sda8\nsudo mkdir /dev/sda8\nsudo mkdir -p /dev/sda8\nsudo mount /dev/sda8 /Documents\n\nI added to fstab\n\nUUID=16b7ad55-aea9-49ed-8be9-0bbf1cb23c2e\n  /Documents    ext4    #defaults   02\n\nThe result now  is  that \n\n\n*\n\n*I don't have a device named 'Documents'\n\n*I have a folder named 'Documents' in my file system (where /etc , /bin...etc lies)\nHow can I correct these?\n-----------UPDATE--------------------------------------------------\nI tried to umount (from the above commands) and now I have the device \"Documents\" but I still have a folder 'Documents' in file system which is empty and is 10GB!

While playing with the \"Edit Menu\" (Application menu), I deleted some entries for settings (like \"Display\", \"Appearance\", \"Desktop\" etc.). This also deleted the entries in the Settings Manager.\nHow can I put them back?\nXubuntu 12.10 - Xfce 4.12\n\nA: Your question is a good one, as there is no documentation on what to do when this happens. Deleting Display or Accessibility, for example, from the Accessories part of the Xfce4 menu will actually remove the helper application's link from settings manager.\nWhat happens is that when you 'delete' something like accessibility from the Accessories part of the Xfce4 menu, a .desktop file appears in ~/.local/share/applications. That file will be labelled, for example, xfce4-accessibility-settings.desktop and will have in the file:\nExec=xfce4-accessibility-settings\nHidden=true\n\nSo therefore just delete the .desktop files in ~/.local/share/applications that refer to the Xfce items that you have deleted in the menu dialog: e.g. xfce-display-settings.desktop. \nNow when you load up the settings manager again they will be available once more. The 'applications' in settings manager are just links to those applications: e.g. xfce4-accessibility-settings is the program behind the accessibility icon. \nIf you want to get a list of the settings programs for reference, run\ndpkg -L xfce4-settings | grep bin\n\nwhich returns:\n/usr/bin/xfce4-settings-editor\n/usr/bin/xfce4-mouse-settings\n/usr/bin/xfsettingsd\n/usr/bin/xfce4-keyboard-settings\n/usr/bin/xfce4-settings-manager\n/usr/bin/xfce4-display-settings\n/usr/bin/xfce4-accessibility-settings\n/usr/bin/xfce4-mime-settings\n/usr/bin/xfce4-appearance-settings\n\nI can say that the solution has been tested on Xfce 4.10 and 4.12 (development) and will work. However, reinstalling the Xfce components would not work, as the problem lies in your home folder, of which files and settings are not purged when reinstalling programs.\n", "Q: The package system is broken using 12.04.2 lts When I run the update manager i get this \"The following packages have unmet dependencies:\nlibefl-bin: Depends: libefl (= 201212281219-551~precise1) but 201303222352-21556~precise1 is installed\" \n\nBut when I do sudo apt-get install -f in the terminal I get the same output?\n\nA: Your package management is out of sync.

I put Ubuntu on a USB stick using LinuxLiveUSB\nIt works great, but upon start-up a dialog box for installing Ubuntu comes up asking if one wants to install it or to just continue to use it.  It stops the start-up process, and if you click it closed it then shows you the desktop.\nCan anyone advise me how to just boot straight into the desktop by getting rid of this dialog box?\nThis is definitely after the start-up, so I think it must be in an init.d script someplace. \n\nA: For what I believe, editing the bootloader file will work out, because from there you can choose wether to try or to install.\n\nA: If I understand well, you are trying to use a LiveUSB as a full installation of Ubuntu inside a USB stick.\nConcepts:\n\n\n*\n\n*The LiveUSB is used to try Ubuntu and to install Ubuntu in a HDD.\n\n*The USB stick with a full Ubuntu installation can be booteable and is\nused to run Ubuntu daily.\n\n", "Q: QQmlComponent: Component is not ready I'm following through the Create a currency converter app tutorial.

This has happened 4 of the last 5 installs.  Most recently I was installing the Google Earth .deb from Google's website: clicking the .deb file automatically opens Software Center (otherwise I would have used Synaptic, as I've grown to expect Software Center to freeze my system and I'm rather tired of it.)\nBy \"freeze\" I mean nothing works: no dash, no launcher, no mouse movement, no alt-tab, can't open terminal (keyboard does not work).  Software center does show the \"installing\" icon but after that it greys out and I can't click anything.\nREISUB has no effect but a cold power-down and restart is possible.  \nOccasionally, after 5-10 minutes, I'll be able to move the mouse / use the keyboard and run a launcher command or two, although other open apps (Chrome and Software Center) will still be greyed-out/frozen.  (I've never waited longer than that - if still unresponsive after 15 minutes I just power down and restart.)  \nMost recently, which is why I am finally posting a question, I waited about 15 minutes and was finally able to open System Monitor while this was going on.  Processes tells me that System Monitor is using about 20% of CPU, and nothing else is using much (zeros mostly).  In fact I didn't even see Software Center listed?  However at this point the system finally partially unfroze, the installation completed, and while I wasn't about to close Software Center I was able to do a system shutdown and fresh restart and I went and took a look at the syslog.\nIn /var/log/syslog I see a lot of \":blocked for more than 120 seconds\" messages.  Similar to \nubuntu hang out with this message :blocked for more than 120 seconds\nWhich has not been answered, and I'm not running a virtual machine.\nMy full syslog with stack traces looks very, very similar to this:\nWhy do tasks on Amazon Xen instance block for over 120 seconds causing server to hang?\nNote that that question was solved, but that's because the problem was being caused by Amazon and Amazon fixed the bug.  I'm not running anything Amazon-related.  My syslog does look very similar, however.\nMy question is also similar to this:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/questions/168068/troubleshooting-server-hang\nBut the referenced \"duplicate\" in that question is about how to kill processes/restart when the system freezes.  I know how to kill processes and restart.  I want to figure out what is causing the problem so I can try to fix it.  I realize that I could just use Synaptic instead of Ubuntu Software Center, but I'd like to try to solve the problem if possible.\nI'm thinking I should perhaps submit a bug report, but I wanted to first see if anyone else was having any similar problems, and if so what you all did to fix it.  \nI see a number of questions about Software Center freezing and others, including those I linked, about the \"blocked for more than 120 seconds\" log error, but I didn't see any question that links the two.  I did save a copy of the syslog report if anyone wants to see it, but as mentioned it's quite similar to the one posted in the Amazon-related question...and I didn't want to take up even more space unnecessarily as, my apologies - this question has already become extremely verbose!\n\nA: I got something similar, install with mini.iso on CD, so I hit Esc and the startup screen change to text mode, so I can see what happen, so I found 1/120 seconds value searching for IP, the file in my computer is url_helper.py, so try push the Esc key when you got the ubuntu logo on the screen and read what cause this 120 delay\nAny way I try to change these value to, and looks like an Ubuntu cloud issue on the start up, hope this help you, I still searching for how to edit the 120 second value in the url_help.py routine, removed the IP searching or some kind of code that ignore this, if not network it's available.\n", "Q: ubuntu desktop 12.10 and ATI radeon hd 3400 Have i just started using ubuntu so sorry if my question seems stupid.\nI installed ubuntu 12.10 and everything works fine on my laptop except the loud noise and heat problem.\nNow i asked around and everyone suggested that one of my drivers is not properly set so i checked and found out that under graphics i have Driver = Unknown.\nNow i tried to look around for a driver to radeon hd 3400 and found one in AMD website downloaded installed then rebooted.\nMy screen went really large and i couldn't see the icons bar to the left.\nafter a 5 hours trying to fix it i purged (Delete?) the driver and ubuntu started working but still driver unknown.\nAny idea what i have to do to fix this please?\nthanks.\n\nA: Try looking in Ubuntu's System Settings, for Additional Drivers/Proprietary drivers, it will probably list the same xorg, fglrx, fglrx-updates that Synaptic finds below, but here it should be a one-click install, even easier :-)\nAnd/or Look in Synaptic for packages called \"xserver-xorg-video-ati\" (x.org open source) or fglrx or \"fglrx-updates\" (proprietary). Actually just searching Synaptic for \"radeon\" should find them. The x.org one works good enough for me, didn't notice any difference with the others, but some people like one or the other (web searches for fglrx & radeon show some opinions)\nWhen I ran Ubuntu live I think it automatically picked the x.org one to use, and Mint does too & works great. Whether or not any of these will fix your heat & noise issues I'm not sure, they could be unrelated to the video. I do remember with my Radeon HD and Ubuntus from 2012 there were some issues, sometimes an older or newer release might work better, may be worth it to try a live usb of 13.04 or 12.04, or Mint, and if one of them runs well check what drivers it's using.\nAlways easiest to try looking in the software repositories with Synaptic or the \"Software Center\" programs first before resorting to downloading from websites, there's almost always a ubuntu-specific package someone else has added, or a debian one.\nPS Here's a ton of info on Radeon & ubuntu on this ubuntu help page, even stuff about 3d/accelerated drivers that I'll check out myself: \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI?action=show&redirect=RestrictedDrivers%2FATI\n", "Q: Is Ubuntu Really This Much Slower Than Windows?

If you can't connect to your LAN you should check the media in use and if your system needs additional drivers.\nMoreover you should check if your Ubuntu system has received an IP address, a gateway address and a DNS server address.

The python command will always point to a Python 2.x version, and python3 will always point to the default Python 3.x version. The python command will never point to Python 3.x.\nI'm not sure what Geany uses exactly, but I would suspect it uses Python 2.x (and thus probably puts #!/usr/bin/python (or should put if it uses /usr/bin/env python instead), in the scripts it generates.\n\nA: Try running import sys;print(sys.version_info) from inside geany.\n\nA: You can use:  \nimport sys\nprint sys.version  \n\nTo find out what version of python you are running.  \nOf course due to changes in python 3 print is now a function so this won't work for version 3.

I need a way to automaticallay turn the touchpad off when an external pointing device is in use.

I had mentioned in my original post that I tried the app called \"synaptiks\" which I found on the Ubuntu Software Center, but apparently someone re-wrote my whole original post and left out that (and other) important details... \nI installed the \"synaptiks\" app, and it did work, but I discovered that a bunch of other apps had been installed without my knowledge or consent when I installed synaptiks.  I felt that this was wrong and seemed like a potential security breech on my machine so I tried to remove these other apps individually and found that trying to remove one ended up removing them all, including the touch pad app... seems really suspicious to me so I made sure all of it was removed... at least I hope... no telling what else it could have installed on my laptop without my knowledge.  And to the asshat who deleted half of my original post... thanks for making me have to waste my time to retype all of this to explain it all over again... and for wasting the time of the person who replied telling me to use the synaptiks app... if you had not edited my original post it would have saved us all the trouble. \n\nA: Yes, don't worry, these are safe packages, they are part of the KDE desktop and required by KDE apps, you might as well install them because in the future if you need to use another KDE app (there are many good ones like KDEnlive, Okular, Digicam, etc) you'll have them already there and won't have to install them again. Waste a bit of HD space but no security risk.\n\nA: There used to be an app called Synaptic (the mouse app, not package manager) that was supposed to be able to do that (but I couldn't find it in the Software Center anymore), other suggestion is installing Cuttlefish, it can detect when a bluetooth or USB device is plugged and fire an action in response, maybe you can work something out with that. Good luck.\n\nA: I don't know if there is an option as a stand-alone package; but if you decide to use gnome-shell in the future, you can try this gnome extension.\n\nA: correct name of this application is synaptiks and you ca find it in Ubuntu Software Center, there is option automatically switched off tuchpad if mouse is plugged, hope it will help\n", "Q: How to make Realtek 8723 recognize the network?

But sometimes the wireless doesn't recognize any network. It´s really rare. When I reboot the notebook, the wireless don't work. I try to use modprobe to load the module but without any success. But, when I shut down the PC, and then when it starts, the wireless works fine. \nHow do I solve this problem?\n\nA: You can find instructions to download and build the rtl8723 driver for Ubuntu 12.10 on various forums. I did that, and it worked. However, the driver seemed unstable. The wireless network would keep dropping out and restarting every few minutes.\nSo I decided to try Ubuntu 13.04 daily build version. Obviously it's not April yet, so Ubuntu 13.04 isn't officially released.\nHowever, 13.04 does have support for Realtek rtl8723 driver, and it also has the Atheros alx driver if your wired ethernet card uses that driver.\nUsing the rtl8723 wireless driver supplied with Ubuntu 13.04 seems to work really good. It doesn't drop out all the time like with 12.10. I haven't tried the alx ethernet driver because the wireless works good enough that I don't need to.\nThe rtl8723 driver comes in the daily builds, so you don't need to download anything except the ISO. It can detect and use the wireless network even from a live USB stick \"try Ubuntu\" type of thingy.\nIf you want to try it, download the appropriate ISO file for your hardware from here:\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/\nI used unetbootin to make a USB stick bootable with the ISO file I downloaded.\nCaveat: while running the live version off the stick, the unity interface didn't show up properly. Only the \"Examples\" folder and \"Install Ubuntu\" showed up, nothing else. Double clicking on these icons worked like you would expect. Ctrl-Alt-T brought up a terminal window. Once Ubuntu 13.04 was installed, unity works.\n", "Q: Looking for a better solution to execute a single sudo command when using a normal user account? I'm logged in with a normal user account that isn't member of the groups sudo and admin. When I run the following example command..\nsu -c 'sudo some_command_that_needs_sudo' sudo-user\n\n..it's necessary to enter the password twice. The first time to login as sudo-user and the second time because we request root privileges using sudo.\nDo you know how to prevent entering the password a second time?\nPlease keep in mind..\n\n\n*\n\n*..don't want to change any user privileges\n\n*..want to enter password just once\n\n*..looking for a simple single command\n\n\nA: Your configuration is a little abnormal. Normally you would add your username to sudoers, and limit the applications that can be executed in this manner if required. Without knowing more detail, I can't see any benefit to introducing a third account. It just introduces more indirection, which is what you're encountering now.\nThe first password you enter is to become the sudo-user. You can't avoid this - you're switching users. Here are some crazy workarounds that come to mind which you shouldn't use.\n\n\n*\n\n*You could set an empty password for the user to make login simpler, but that would be an insane security risk. Do not do this.\n\n*You could automate the login with expect and a hardcoded password. This is no more secure than the previous suggestion. Do not do this. \n\n*You could use ssh. You'd create a ssh key as the sudo-user, copy it to your user's .ssh dir, permission it for your user, append it to the sudouser's .ssh/authorized_keys, and then use: ssh -i .ssh/sudouser_id_rsa sudouser@localhost <command>. It may work, but it's crazy. \n\n\nThe second password can easily be removed by editing the sudoers file with visudo and setting the sudouser as NOPASSWD. This is a more common operation. You can even limit the commands which don't require a password, which is obviously recommended if you only intend to run a few commands in this manner. Note, however, that unless this sudo user is treated very seriously, having a NOPASSWD policy is not a good idea. Generally speaking, it isn't a good idea regardless.\nA configuration which can run all commands without a password prompt would look like:\nsudouser ALL= NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nBottom line - I don't see why you're using this three account configuration. Setting that to one side, in terms of giving you what you asked for, allowing the sudo user to run certain commands without being prompted for a password is the most sensible route.  \nYou have to be careful though - that creates a less secure setup. \nAs an aside, it is technically possible to achieve a zero authentication solution within your guidelines, by using both ssh key-based authentication and NOPASSWD for the sudo user, so your commands would look like:\nssh -i .ssh/sudouser_id_rsa sudouser@localhost sudo whatever_i_like\n\nThat's obviously way beyond insecure - that's just plain open. I shouldn't need to say it, but don't do that.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 - Bumblebee 3.1 - Error - Unable to locate package Bumblebee Hello Ubuntu citizens,\nI am on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (up-to-date) and was trying to install the new Bumblebee 3.1\nFirst, I tried to remove Bumblebee first using:\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge \nsudo ppa-purge ppa:bumblebee/stable\n\nThen I re-install using:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable \nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia linux-headers-generic\n\nThe last command gave me error:\nux-headers-generic\nReading package lists...

I have converted image through terminal using the following command:\nconvert myfigure.png myfigure.jpg\n\nBut I want to resize the height and width of the converted image. Is there any way to do this?\n\nA: If you want CLI only:\nsudo apt-get install imagemagick\nmogrify -resize 320x240 Image.png \nmogrify -resize 50% Image.png\nmogrify -resize 320x240 *.jpg\n\n\nIf you wanna try GUI:\nInstall nautilus-image-converter\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-image-converter\n\nIt adds two context menu items in nautlius so you can right click and choose \"Resize Image\".(The other is \"Rotate Image\").\nYou can do a whole directory of images in one go if you like and you don't even have to open up an application to do so.\n\nA: imgp is a relatively new utility that does image resize and rotation. It has more features than nautilus-image-converter.\nFor example:\nimgp -x 1366x768 *\n\n\nA: Same command, with an extra option:\nconvert myfigure.png -resize 200x100 myfigure.jpg\n\nor\nconvert -resize 50% myfigure.png myfigure.jpg\n\n\nTo resize multiple files, you can try the following command (as suggested by @test30)\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -iname \"*.jpg\" | xargs -L1 -I{} convert -resize 30% \"{}\" _resized/\"{}\"\n\n\nA: Since Ubuntu ships with Python, you can also use a Python script to achieve this with a little more control over what happens - see this stackoverflow question for example scripts. Those examples use just the standard library.\nScript #1\nimport os, sys\nimport Image\n\nsize = 128, 128\n\nfor infile in sys.argv[1:]:\n    outfile = os.path.splitext(infile)[0] + \".thumbnail\"\n    if infile != outfile:\n        try:\n            im = Image.open(infile)\n            im.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)\n            im.save(outfile, \"JPEG\")\n        except IOError:\n            print \"cannot create thumbnail for '%s'\" % infile\n\nAnd another example where you only have to specify the width (as the width variable):\nScript #2\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport sys\n\nfilename = sys.argv[1:]\nbasewidth = 300\nimg = Image.open(filename)\nwpercent = (basewidth/float(img.size[0]))\nhsize = int((float(img.size[1])*float(wpercent)))\nimg = img.resize((basewidth,hsize), Image.ANTIALIAS)\nimg.save(filename) \n\nNow, how to do this through the terminal...\nsudo nano resizescript.py\n\nPaste one of those blocks of code into the text editor. Ctrl+x to exit (say yes to save changes).\nTo use Script #1:\npython resizescript.py yourfilenamehere.jpg\n\nTo use Script #2:\npython resizescript.py yourfilenamehere.jpg\n\nYou must be in the same directory as the picture files for both of these scripts. The first one shrinks the image to 128x128 pixels. The second script makes it 300 pixels wide and calculates the proportional height. This is more of a Python answer, but it is done all through the terminal technically.\n", "Q: What format is used in the LXC config file to specify control group settings?

So I managed to fairly severely mess up my graphics card driver. I was trying to install OpenCL using instructions from here: http://orbigo.net/2012/07/installing-nvidia-opencl-cuda-sdk-in-ubuntu-12-04-lts/\nI dropped down to a shell using ctrl+alt+F1, and stopped the lightdm service. Then I ran the file from nVidia. For some reason I thought it would be a good idea to install the driver that came with the package. When I tried to restart lightdm after this, my system showed the ubuntu splash screen and then froze up with a black screen with a blinking cursor. I then tried to reboot my computer, but it seems to lock up while starting up. I get the Ubuntu splash screen, but then I get a black screen listing a bunch of services that have been started. The last service on this list is lightdm, which it says started ok, but it seems to freeze after that.\nI believe Ubuntu has some sort of recovery option on the grub menu, so I tried loading into that. The problem here is that I can't seem to get into the grub menu. It appears to be the same issue as this: Grub Menu doesn't appear when pressing SHIFT\nI booted up using a LiveCD with Ubuntu 12.04 on it, and tried fixing the grub as per the answer I linked. Unfortunately because I'm running off a LiveCD, it doesn't seem to like the update-grup step, since the boot table is different or something like that... I get the error: error: cannot find a device for / (is /dev mounted?). when I try this. I also tried grub-install /dev/sda but I seem to get the same error here.\nI'm running Ubuntu 12.10. I forget exactly what graphics card I have, but it's an older (~6 years or so?) nVidia one. There aren't any other OS's installed on my machine.\nAny help to get my computer back into a usable state without having to reinstall the OS would be appreciated.\nUPDATE: I have managed to fix grub using the boot-repair tool, and can get into recovery mode. Now I just have to figure out how to fix my graphics card driver from here. The root terminal option is working.\n\nA: I managed to resolve this issue. The first step was to fix grub such that I could boot into recovery mode. I did this using an Ubuntu 12.04 LiveCD, as outlined here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows\nI used the graphical method (boot-repair).\nOnce grub was repaired, I rebooted my computer (removing the LiveCD), and booted into recovery mode (from the grub menu, I selected advanced boot options for ubuntu, and then the recovery mode for the most recent kernel version (the second option from this menu)).\nFrom recovery mode, I selected the \"network\" option to enable networking. This took about 5 mins or so to actually connect to the network, and wasn't very obvious that it was actually working. Once networking was enabled, I selected the \"root\" option to drop to terminal. From here, I ran the following command:\napt-get install nvidia-current --reinstall\nWhich reinstalled my graphics card driver. I also reinstalled lightdm (apt-get install lightdm --reinstall), although I'm not sure as to whether or not this was actually helpful.\nAt this point I rebooted the computer with the command reboot, and everything was back to normal.\n", "Q: SSD tweaks for Ubuntu 12.04 cause Texmaker to compile a lot slower I added these tweaks from Ubuntu SSD Tweak and Ubuntu Tweaks but now Texmaker is compiling slowly.

In my experience, this kills performance. On every sync after a file has been deleted, a TRIM request gets sent, causing the disk to freeze up for 2 to 3 seconds. (This will be hardware-dependent.)\nTo see whether this is the problem, try testing fsync performance as suggested in this thread:\n\nRunning Theodore Ts'os \"fsync-tester\" while doing Linus' torture test\nwhile : ; do time sh -c \"dd if=/dev/zero of=bigfile bs=8M count=256 ; sync; rm bigfile\"; done\n\nshows it clearly\n\nSync should be fast on an SSD. In my case and that poster's case, each sync causes a lockup of several seconds. See also https://patrick-nagel.net/blog/archives/337 for a similar example.\nIf you see similar behavior, you should disable automatic TRIM by removing the discard option from your fstab. (But keep the noatime or relatime option that you probably added.)\nInstead, periodically run fstrim on your filesystem, e.g. using cron. Several ways to do this are given in this article. This way you should still get the benefits of TRIM without the performance problems.\n", "Q: configure modeline Ubuntu 12.04 I am running Ubuntu 12.04.2 in dual boot with Windows 7 on the same drive.\nIn Windows, I customize my refresh rate for my 2nd monitor with the program powerstrip.

If you are using Windows, go to pendrive Linux and there is a utility to put it on your USB for you.\n\n*Be sure your BIOS is set up to boot from CD/DVD.\n\n*Boot with plop boot CD in the drive and the USB stick in and select \"boot usb\".\n\nA: Alternative: If the PC has a floppy drive, you'll have to prepare a Plop floppy to boot from (if you still can access Plop at boot, if not, you'll have to prepare it from another PC that has a floppy drive). From there, you can chose to boot from USB (you can prepare the USB with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS in your newer PC).\n\nA: First, you need to get Plop Boot Manager.\n\nAs far as I know, despite of the lengthy documentation, using Plop to boot from usb under Windows is as simple as double clicking a bat file. But the doc for Linux is not that straight forward and contains daunting terminologies such as LILO for a Linux newbie.\n\nWell, straight forward, LILO is a boot manager. Basically, it's saying it will boot into LILO. It's a bit like GRUB. Plop Boot Manager comes with LILO, so it will install it with Plop Boot Manager. That will go into the USB. Then, when you boot, LILO will come up.\n\nSo could someone show me a brief and concise instruction how to boot from usb?\n\nWell, to boot off the USB, you need to go into the BIOS.\nAt the screen, go into the Boot section.\nPut the USB in the Boot order. Remember to put the USB before your SSD/HHD.\nThen save changes and re-boot.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Triple monitors on hybrid video system GeForce+Intel I use Lenovo Ideapad Z580A with hybrid video: GeForce+Intel with Ubuntu 12.10 x64 Ukrainian.

Same problem with ~ key, it also needs to be pressed two times. No any problem with other keys.\nHow to rectify this strange problem?\n\nA: It's not a bug, it's a feature ;) You probably have set a keyboard layout with so called \"dead keys\". Those keys are mostly not for printing characters themselves, but for modifying the following character. For example, if you press \"~\" followed by \"e\", you get \"ẽ\". This is a simple way to type so called \"diacritic characters\" that are combined of several glyphs like \"é\", \"ñ\", \"ô\", which are used in many languages. To print ~, `, ^ and others themselves, you can combine them with a space character, thus pressing for example \"~\" followed by the space key. Your solution, pressing the dead key twice, works as well, but is more complicated for the fingers in my opinion.\nIf you don't want to use the dead key functionality, you can, as you seem to already have, choose a keyboard layout that doesn't feature them.\n\nA: If possible, please try using another keyboard. If the problem goes away, it simply means a defective keyboard.\n", "Q: Huge difference beetween 2 versions of ubuntu 12.04 I have installed ubuntu 12.04 LTS on my laptop(now through updates i have 12.04.2) and I installed 12.04.2 LTS on my girlfriend's laptop and they have different kernels.\nWhile mine has kernel version 3.2, my girlfriend's has 3.5.\nI see here the 3.5 doesn't have a version for precise.Is it a good/bad thing?\nShould I upgrade to kernel 3.5 myself?\n\nA: i encountered the same difference, when i installed the newest version for a friend.\nit turns out, that there is a package, that you can install as an update by your own, that is not installed automatically for yout with any sort of update-procedure.\n\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-generic-lts-quantal linux-headers-generic-lts-quantal\n\nshould do the trick.

After I press the power button it hangs at a Dell splash screen and doesn't do anything. If I press F12 (before it hangs) to get in the boot selection and select one of the UEFI boot options all is well.\nThe problem of course is that it's a bit annoying to do this every time I boot. I ran boot-repair, but that didn't help (see http://paste.ubuntu.com/5643012/)\nSee http://imgur.com/KIvrWPC,px2jwxD,lQ3cde7 for my bios settings / boot menu. The ubuntu boot option is the one that appeared after I initially installed ubuntu, the other one appeared after running boot repair. I also made some boot options myself and pointed them to the correct grub file, but they had exactly the same issue.\nI have HD encryption on, so maybe this has something to do with it, although the decryption comes after the boot menu, so it might be irrelevant. Also ubuntu is the only OS, so no dual booting is going on.\n\nA: In the BIOS there is an entry called Fastboot under POST behavior. There are three options: minimal (this was selected), thorough and auto. Setting it to thorough made me get passed the Dell splash screen. Then I got a message saying that no bootable devices where found, so I went back to the BIOS, made sure UEFI was selected and now it boots as expected!\n", "Q: Bricked Dell after installing I just created a disaster I would not have thought possible. I used a USB stick to install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS alongside Windows 7 on a Dell Inspiron 560.\nThe install went well, except that GRUB didn't install. No problem; I rebooted to the USB stick and followed the procedure to reinstall GRUB.\nUpon my next boot, I got the GRUB menu and could select Ubuntu or Windows (yay!) but Ubuntu locked up during boot (boo!)\nThe problem is, now rebooting achieves nothing: The Dell Logo screen doesn't appear, so I have no access to boot options, and GRUB never appears. I can't get into the Setup screen, I can't select a different boot device -- nothing! There's no video signal at all upon boot, according to my monitor.\nHow could a failed boot of Ubuntu cause my computer to refuse to ever output video?\n\nA: The bad news is that Ubuntu triggered a bug in your BIOS. The good news is that it's easy to make the computer bootable again: all you need to do is shut the power off completely, i.e. disconnect it from wall power and remove the battery. Wait a few seconds, put the battery back, and you should be able to boot.\nFiguring out the cause of the bug can be difficult. First, see if that's a one-off thing or if it's repeatable. At the Grub prompt, highlight the “Ubuntu …” line, press e, use the arrow keys to navigate to the linux /vmlinuz … line, delete the words quiet splash at the end of the linux, and press Ctrl+X to boot. If that was a freak event and your computer boots this time, it's not worth investigating further unless the bug occurs again. If the computer hangs, note the last few messages that appeared on-screen: they will be a good clue as to what is breaking. How to proceed from there depends on these messages.\n\nA: To make sure try remove Harddrive, remove AC and battery for minute then, put it back (except harddrive) and try to get into setup, or boot up from usb stick. Maybie it's just corrupted hardrive.\n", "Q: How can I get Summary and Description of Schema using gsettings I prefer to use gsettings over dconf-editor because dconf-editor lacks of command-line options to go to a schema directly (eg. I have to do \"org - click - gnome -click - settings-daemon - click - plugins - click - power - click).\nOne problem using gsettings is that I cannot see the \"Description\" and \"Summary\" fields that I get in dconf-editor. Is there any way to get these?\nBest,\nJürgen\n\nA: It is not possible to do this with gsettings, as the option simply does not exist. There is extensive documentation on gsettings and the internals of the program at the official Gnome site.\nHowever, there is an interesting project at github called gsettings-info that does exactly what you ask. It is a script that queries information about either schemas and/or keys from the gschema information and returns the same data about them that is displayed when you use dconf-editor. \nYou'll requiere Git and git xsltproc (library that it uses to read the gschema information)\nsudo apt install git xsltproc\n\nObtain the program with:\ngit clone git://github.com/jmatsuzawa/gsettings-info.git\ncd gsettings-info \n\nNow you can run the script\n./gsettings-info <command>\n\nYou can either run it from the home folder (and occasionally update it by going to the folder and using git pull), or install to the system or place it in your ~/bin folder so it is available by just entering gsettings-info.\nIf you are running it from the downloaded folder, entering ./gsettings-info help will give all the options, as does the README and the information at the Github page.\nYou can find much information on both the schemas and keys. Here is an example of how to find data about certain keys. This assumes it is run from the downloaded folder, and so ./ is needed to run the script.\n\n\n*\n\n*To find out details about the particular keys of the chosen schema, enter:\n./gsettings-info desc org.gnome.gnumeric.autocorrect\n\nwhich returns:\ninit-caps: Autocorrect initial caps\ninit-caps-list: Autocorrect initial caps\nfirst-letter: The autocorrect engine does not correct the initial caps for words in this list.\nfirst-letter-list: The autocorrect engine does not correct the first letter for words in this list.\nnames-of-days: Autocorrect names of days\nreplace: Autocorrect replace\n\n\n*To show defaults and information for a particular key, use:\n./gsettings-info show org.gnome.gnumeric.autocorrect init-caps\n\nwhich returns:\nKEY: init-caps\nTYPE: b\nSUMMARY: Autocorrect initial caps\nDESCRIPTION: Autocorrect initial caps\nDEFAULT: true\n\nThis seems to be exactly what your are looking for, and is about the only way to show this information on the command-line instead of in dconf-editor.\n\nA: You can use gsettings describe to get the description of the key and gsettings range to get possible values for the key.\n", "Q: warning: GDB: Failed to set controlling terminal: Operation not permitted I'm using Code-Blocks IDE in my Ubuntu 12.10.But when I'm trying to debug any project, I got the following warning:\nwarning: GDB: Failed to set controlling terminal: Operation not permitted\n\nWhat should I do now ?\n\nA: I had a similar problem on Ubuntu 16.04 using GDB 7.11 via XTerm.

It also has a GRUB debug component provided. these will allow you to profile your boot and hopefully find out what's eating the large chunk of time.\n\n\nA: If you get all those entries probably there is something making a loop on Grub. It happened a similar thing to me when installed Raring on a separate partition (bad escaping created entries like menuentry \"Ubuntu\"...). As you said you changed nothing maybe this has origin in some update in Grub?\nThat file is automatically generated (when you install a new kernel, for example) by the scripts present in /etc/grub.d. If you examine grub.cfg you will see that there are separators between entries, specifying which script generated it. Example:\n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/30_uefi-firmware ###\n### END /etc/grub.d/30_uefi-firmware ###\n\n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/40_custom ###\n# This file provides an easy way to add custom menu entries.

When you get there, you can use sudo grub-mkconfig or execute that script using, for example:\nsh -v /etc/grub.d/file\n\nto try to identify what is going on.\nThis is not a solution at all, but I hope it could help in something.\n", "Q: When I use the Universal USB trouble When I use the universal usb installer, and it's extracting the files.

I downgraded back to 11.10 which now zips along quite fine as before, on my machine.\nHowever what I would like clarified is that after support for 11.10 is stopped in April, if I decide to do a clean install of 11.10 on a machine, will the update manager still offer to install the (last) updates and security fixes that were made for 11.10 or will it simply offer to upgrade to 12.04 LTS.\nIf I add other ppa's such as google google chrome and spotify etc. will/can they still offer upgrades for their software?\n\nA: You might have noticed degraded performance because you were upgrading the system from one distribution to another (ie; from 11.10 to 12.04). It happens at times. I would suggest you to do a clean installation of 12.04. Or if you wish to wait for a month, do a clean install of upcoming release 13.04.\nBut please we aware that starting from 13.04, interim releases would be supported for 9 months instead of the usual 18 months. LTS releases would continue to be supported for 3/5 years as the case may be.\nIf you wish to continue using 11.10 (not recommended), Canonical won't publish any further security/bug-fix updates. However, you would be able to download the ones already released. You would also be able to install other softwares for your distribution. For this you would have to make certain changes to /etc/apt/sources.list. Follow the instructions in this question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to install software or upgrade from an old unsupported release?\nAs far as PPAs are concerned, it really depends on the PPA maintainer (Google/Spotify) if they wish to maintain compatibility with EOL Distribution Releases. So, there's no guarantee that they would continue to provide further updates for 11.10 users.\n", "Q: How to connect on VNC client to non-default display (:1) Context\nI'm working with a friend to run a virtual machine on a remote server and connect to it using VNC. \nAs he already have one VM on the :0 display, he put mine on the :1 display. \nIssue\nI tried to connect to the machine using various VNC client (remmina, tightvnc, krdc) and none seems to be able to connect to a display other than :0.\nN.B. : I also tried virt-manager but it seems the gentoo server doesn't have the right version of netstat.\n\nA: For now, the only client that seems to support that is xvnc4viewer where I put in thue VNC server field :\n\nserver_hostname:1\n\n\nA: Remmina supports host{name,ip}:display.

If I upload a file and I want it to remain on server, yet delete it from my computer. How can I do that? I want to access the file over internet only! I am thinking about mails or drafts. Or something like dropbox.\nthanks in advance \n\nA: Ubuntu One is a synchronizing tool, not a backup tool. The principle of synchronizing is that all computers have the same files. The principle of backing up data is to keep data stored in case of emergency. \nIn Ubuntu One every file you delete on your local computer will instantly be deleted on the cloud version of your data as well. \nBackup solutions based on Ubuntu One are not flawless. Here are two options you might consider, though I advise against them:\n\n\n*\n\n*You could add a folder to Ubuntu One. Once that folder is synchronized to the cloud, you could decide to stop syncing it on your local machine (unmark it in the Ubuntu One interface). This is prone to errors.\n\n*You could also make backups locally and store those in the Ubuntu One cloud. Again, though, if you delete the backup locally, the cloud will follow because that is what clouds do. \n", "Q: How can I see Ubuntu file system, installed on SDcard, FROM Android I installed Ubuntu 12.04 32bit bootable on my SD card (16GB) giving 6GB for Ubuntu (4 for documents), 10 to Android (FAT32 - boot flags).\nHow can I open Ubuntu files from Android device?\nUbuntu folder to access : /home/desktop/download \nI have rooted HTC sensation.\n\nA: i have a nexus 4  and i'm not sure if this works for sensation but give it a try. open ES file explorer(or any file explorer that can gain root), give it root permissions. for nexus 4 user data is located at:  /data/user-data/phablet/\n", "Q: Cannot get my internet to connect I own an HP ProBook 4520s laptop which is dual-booted with Windows 8 Pro and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

I have installed all the necessary servers to work with php in Ubuntu..\nBut i don't know how to compile php in Linux.\nMy hostname is \"blackparrot\"\nmy user name is \"red\"\nPls tell or show me a way to compile php here\n\nA: You don't need to compile PHP if you already installed LAMP as PHP is run in the server itself, you need just to invoke the files in the proper place as @MustafaJF mention. \nSimply open nautilus with administrative privileges by executing (in a terminal or by hitting Alt-F2 for the run program dialog), write gksudo nautilus, provide your password and go to the /var/www folder, over there simply drop your php files which you can access later by opening a web browser and pointing to the http://localhost/foldername/yourphpfile.php address.\nWhere foldername is the folder where the php files will reside and yourphpfile.php is the file containing your php code.\nA good example to test if everything is running fine is the to create a file with the next contents inside:\n<?php\n phpinfo();\n?>\n\nLet's name this file phpinfo.php and place it at the very root of /var/www folder, after which we'll invoke it via http://localhost/phpinfo.php and will result in something like this:\n\nResults may vary from case to case.\nRemember that /var/www is a protected place of which you will need administrative privileges each time you want to access the files for a change or something. But if you prefer, you can (at your own risk) change the location of your /var/www to a different place for testing purposes, which will suppose no risk at all if you do it just for testing purposes and have your server not exposed to the net. See this answer for a workaround to change the default location of your testing server.\nPlease inform if you are experiencing any issues.\nGood luck!\n\nA: There is a sub folder under your apache folder.\nIt is usually named www.\nYou put all your website files under that folder and call the site through the web browser.\n", "Q: Boot doesn't display Windows XP and Ubuntu to select the OS I recently installed Ubuntu 12.10 as dual boot to my Windows XP.

Directly Windows XP is being started. So, I re-installed Ubuntu but still cannot get the OS selection menu.\nHow can I resolve this problem?\n\nA: Run sudo update-grub. Sometimes it happens that during installation, the bootloader doesn't detect windows. If it still doesn't show windows. Then just to check that everything is alright, check the file grub.cfg in the folder in the root directory ./boot/grub/ . If it displays the words that go something like \"Windows * (loader)\" then everything is alright with the grub.cfg file.

I'd like to know how to control another Ubuntu OS from my personal computer with Ubuntu, like remote access through the internet.\nThere is any native software to perform this task?

If it's more than one, could you please list it?\nThanks.\n\nA: Go to the dash and type in remote, click on the icon that says \"desktop sharing\" then click the box that says \"allow others to view your desktop\" on the host computer.\nNow from the client computer click on the other icon that says Reminna Remote Desktop Client. Click \"Create New Remote Desktop File\" in the server box, type in the host computers IP address or host name, then the user name and password. Hit the connect button.\nIf you are trying to do this from an external computer \"away from your home\" you will want to make sure you have your external IP address, also you will want to open ports, or if your router supports it, you can put your computer in the DMZ (demilitarized zone) of the routers firewall.\n\nA: I've personally found that installing and using TeamViewer (although it actually works under a custom version of Wine) is the most straight-forward solution for remote access/control.\n", "Q: Move entire installation to blank partition I have Ubuntu 12.10 installed on a second hard drive (sdb).

Afterwards you can always resize the partitions with Puppy Linux, Parted Magic or Gparted live disks. If Win XP NTFS partition already occupies the entire drive, you'll need a Gparted live disk to resize it anyway before installing Ubuntu alongside. I recommend once you resize it, to reboot in Windows BEFORE installing Ubuntu to make sure everything boots, if it doesn't there are ways to fix the MBR without losing your XP operating system.\n\nA: It is always safe to install alongside Windows using WUBI installer as it will not require any partitioning or a dedicated drive (just free space).\nThe only downside is a little effect on performance but it could be negligible.\nCheck steps in this link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide\nIf for any reason you want to remove/reinstall, you may simply do that from within Windows inside Add/Remove programs listed as Ubuntu\n", "Q: Extremely Slow And/or Unreliable Wifi on a 2009 Macbook Pro With BCM4322 After installing Ubuntu 12.10 on my late-2009 Macbook Pro (7,1), I was experiencing very slow wifi speeds, sometimes dropping below 1 kb/s and never reaching much higher than 45 kb/s.

Can I copy ten passwords, comma separated, and have it check all ten passwords?\nIs there a way to put the possible passwords in a file and then have the software check the passwords in the file?\nIf nothing else, is there a way to enter passwords without having to scan the HD for the encrypted drive and burning almost a minute between password entries?\nAlso, pasting a password into the password entry box work or do I manually have to enter it?\n\nA: The solution to this question is essentially the same as the solution to this \"challenge\" I posted on my blog several years ago.  (Note, I'm the author of Ubuntu's Encrypted Home Directory feature, and the maintainer of eCryptfs.)\nYou can find the challenge here, and the solution here.\n", "Q: Configuring wacom tablet on Ubuntu 12.10 by installing missing dependencies I've been reading a book on Gimp.  The book recommended that I visit the LinuxWacom Project for the drivers of a Wacom tablet I own. \nAfter extracting the tarball, I have to configure and make install.  But this part is where ./configure got interesting.\nconfigure: error: Package requirements (xorg-server >= 1.7.0 xproto xext kbproto inputproto randrproto) were not met:\n\nNo package 'xorg-server' found\nNo package 'xproto' found\nNo package 'xext' found\nNo package 'kbproto' found\nNo package 'inputproto' found\nNo package 'randrproto' found\n\nConsider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you\ninstalled software in a non-standard prefix.\n\nAlternatively, you may set the environment variables XORG_CFLAGS\nand XORG_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.\nSee the pkg-config man page for more details.\njohn@kotux:~/xf86-input-wacom-0.20.0$ \n\nNot to mention my laptop on 12.10 has Xorg version 1.13.0.

Even just a few years back, there were tons of configuration problems getting a Wacom tablet set up properly on Ubuntu (especially with dual-monitor setups).\nSince 12.04 and 12.10, though, I have not had a single problem with Wacom tablets in Ubuntu. The automatic configuration works perfectly for me, even with my dual-monitor layout.\nTry using the Wacom tablet settings in the regular System Settings application for Ubuntu. Unless you have a strange hardware configuration, there shouldn't be any need to install the driver yourself.\nIf you are having issues in GIMP specifically but not in other programs (try out Krita, MyPaint, etc.) then you can try editing the Input Device settings in GIMP to make sure that your tablet is not set to \"disabled\" in the program.\nEither way, your tablet should work out of the box with the most recent versions of Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Low latency in PureData(Pd) with Jack in Ubuntu Studio 12.04 I´m having trouble to make PureData(Pd) to work at low latency in Ubuntu Studio 12.04.\nI get Pd and Jack to work together with my Audio Interface (Alesis IO4) but only at a frames/Period of 1024, which means a latency of 45.2 ms.\nAs soon as I try to lower the Frames/period to lower the latency, I get an Audio I/O error from Pd.\nI tried to mess around with the oder parameters, but the only one who appears to affect Pd (and the latency) is the Frames/Period.\nI also tried to use the configuration explained here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToJACKConfiguration , but it doesn´t work either.\nI really need to get the lowest latency possible, because I work with live instruments and proccesing.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: Jack is probably your best option here. Ubuntu Studio is already prepared for low latency, with linux-lowlatency preinstalled, as well as realtime privileges being set up.\nUse qjackctl to control jack.

I've installed Ubuntu on my Toshiba Satellite L775 but the biggest problem is that I can't reduce the screen luminosity, It's too too bright and I almost can't use it at night.\n\nA: That seems strange... I own a Toshiba Satellite P755, and can change the brightness under both the computer settings and the keyboard short-cut (FN F6 and F7). You should (theoretically) be able to change it either way.

One of my servers won't let me connect from outside. With the user;  \n\n'mytestuser'@'%'\n\nAccording to an open port finder, port 3306 for the offending server appears to be closed. I have C++ and Java programs of my own listening on arbitrary ports without any issues. Why is this happening and how can I fix it? \nUbuntu installed is Ubuntu 11.10 (GNU/Linux 2.6.32-042stab072.10 x86_64)\nResults of netstat -tuple on each server\nOffending server\ntcp        0      0 localhost.lo:submission *:*                     LISTEN      root       39967664    -\n\nWorking server\ntcp        0      0 *:mysql                 *:*                     LISTEN      mysql      1847519288  -\n\n\nA: The problem was that the server was listening internally only. \nRemoving the line bind-address 127.0.0.1 from /etc/mysql/my.cnf solved the issue.\nNewer versions of Ubuntu (≥16.04) may have this line in /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf.\n\nA: I use this method:\nsudo ufw status\nsudo ufw allow XXXX/tcp\n# use a port other than the default/predictable 3306\n# work outside, and close the door when you are done\nsudo ufw deny XXXX/tcp\n\nNo need to change other configuration files, and no extra ports opened by default.\n\nA: I fixed this by changing bind-address 127.0.0.1 to bind-address 0.0.0.0 in /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d so that MySQL listens on all ports.\nAlso, I set up a mysql user account to be used remotely. For more details see Host 'xxx.xx.xxx.xxx' is not allowed to connect to this MySQL server.\n\nA: My suggestion, if you are sure that the ports are closed (I find it weird for a VPS to have that port closed) is to change the configuration file of MySQL to use another.\nSimply open the configuration file in the terminal, sudo nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf, and look for the [mysqld] section. In it, look for the line that reads port            = 3306. Change it to another port not used and save the file.\nThen simply either restart the VPS or restart the service, like sudo service mysql restart.\nJust to note that, if the file mysql.conf is not in the one I mentioned above it can be in this other places:\n/etc/my.conf\n/etc/my.cnf\n/etc/mysql/my.conf\n\nAnd if the service command does not work, then do this:\nsudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart\n\nIf the problem persists then in my case I would check iptables (I would actually delete everything in iptables just to start fresh if this could be an option) or any other firewall-enabled option.\nSince they are VPS, I would also check the VPS Control Panel to see if it has any option that can block ports.\nApart from that, I would run nmap on the VPS to see what ports you have opened. You need to run it from outside the VPS to see what ports they have opened.\nnetstat -tuplen is also a good idea to see what opened ports you have on the server and which ones are in LISTEN mode.\n\nA: It may happen that your configuration is in the directory /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf, verify if that is not the case. \n", "Q: AMD Radeon GPU only uses 384MB VRAM instead of +2GB dedicated video-memory for some reason a majority if not all games are limited to only 384MBs of video memory (VRAM) instead of it's full 2048MB dedicated memory.

Linux\nHost version: 3.5.0-26-generic\n\nIs there a solution to this problem? How do I make either Linux or my 3D-applications realize that there's more dedicated video memory available for my HD6970? Are there appropriate commands for this kind of issues, or are there other applications much like Wine/ PlayOnLinux that may utilize my applications and full memory better?\nUbuntu showing only 256mb of vram when it should be 1GB\nMax VRAM supported by open source ATI radeon\nThanks in advance\nRaklödder\n\nA: How are you determining that the GPU only sees 384MB of VRAM?\nIt's likely that only programs run in Wine are seeing 384MB of VRAM. This would be because OpenGL doesn't (yet) provide any way of querying how much VRAM a card has, so Wine is forced to guess; it might be guessing badly for you.\nTo tell Wine how much VRAM your card actually has, you want to set the VideoMemorySize registry key. You can either do this following the steps on the UsefulRegistryKeys Wine Wiki page, or run the command winetricks videomemorysize=2048 at a terminal, which will set the registry key for you.\n", "Q: Blinking Cursor After \"Enable Networking\" in Recovery Mode and unable to do anything else. After hitting \"Yes\" on \"Do you wish to continue?\" I get\n\nfsck from util-linux 2.20.1\n/dev/sda1: clean, 166400/2444624 files, 906859/9765755 blocks\n\nWith a blinking cursor on the line below it. From here, the only thing I can do is power off and start up again, and I'm still in read-only mode. \nBackground:\nI'm using a Toshiba Portege R100, a laptop that lacks a CD drive and can't boot from a USB stick. \nI removed the R100's hard disc, plugged it into a Mac (over USB) that was in \"Try Ubuntu\" mode using a DVD,and then I installed Ubuntu onto the R100's hard disk. \nWith the hard disk back in the R100, on start-up, after the GRUB menu, with Ubuntu selected, it displays the Ubuntu logo then goes into \"Low-Graphics Mode,\" covered here:\nHow to fix \"The system is running in low-graphics mode\" error?\nIn attempting to try the various fixes reported there, I have to use Recovery Mode, which leaves the disk, by default, in read-only mode. \nAnd that's where I try \"Enable Networking,\" which results in the blinking cursor (crash?). \nI have also tried dropping to the shell and trying\n# mount -o rw,remount /\nwhich is the fix here, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1870817\nBut that doesn't work. I just get a new prompt, as if I entered a return, and the system remains read-only.\n\nA: Another (better) answer, is that for the Enable Networking command, you have Network access. Who would have thought? ; ) So, when in the terminal, get hard-wired-in, of course. \n\nA: Ok, I have no idea why this works, but it does. To recover from Low-Graphics Mode into a working terminal with the disk set in rw mode, if Ctrl-Alt-F1 gets you a blue screen:\nOn boot, choose Advanced Options from the GRUB menu\nChoose Recovery Mode\nWhen the menu appears, choose Resume Normal Boot\n{Low-Graphics Mode} \nTHEN Ctrl-Alt-F1 works fine, then login. \n\nA: Use the following commands by activating the root shell:\nifconfig eth0 up \ndhclient eth0\n\n", "Q: Graphics issues after update 12.04, LTS \nYesterday morning I ran suggested updates. After doing so I had these problems:\nAfter about one minute, the screen will flash, sometimes more than once, then the launcher and system menu will vanish, leaving only the desktop visible. Sometimes the screen will the revert back to showing the launcher, and/or flip back and forth between the two modes before stopping. \nWhichever mode it ends up in, the mouse cursor still responds to mouse movements, but the mouse buttons do nothing, and the keyboard does not respond. I can do nothing except restart the machine using the power switch.\nAfter a lot of experimenting, I discovered that by starting in recovery mode, the system would come up as 1600 x1200 \"Laptop\" rather than the previous 1920 x1080 \"Samsung 22\" that had been in use. As long as I start the system this way, it apparently works OK. Booting as normal then altering the screen resolution to 1600 x1200 (quickly, before the first minute or so is up) does not help - it still dies as before. Booting in recovery mode does not give me the option to change the resolution to anything other than the one used by recovery mode.\nSo this problem, which occured immediately after an update, appears to be related to the graphics driver. I have attached the last section of /var/log/apt/history.log (re-formatteded for human readbility) but I don't see anything in there that suggests to me that it would effect the graphics in this way.\nI would have to dig to find out exactly what graphics card I'm using. Nothing special, just whatever cheap card came with the PC, and I'm sure I never installed any special driver for it.\nI'd sure like to be able to just boot without going into recovery mode first, and I'd sure like to have my accustomed resolution back. \nIf anyone can tell me \n1) which of these update is likely to have done this, and \n2) how to revert back to the prevcious version\nI'd appreciate it.\nThanks\nStart-Date: 2013-03-23  09:08:58\nCommandline: aptdaemon role='role-commit-packages' sender=':1.71'\nInstall: \n\nlinux-headers-3.2.0-39-generic:amd64 (3.2.0-39.62), \n\nlinux-headers-3.2.0-39:amd64 (3.2.0-39.62), \n\nlinux-image-3.2.0-39-generic:amd64 (3.2.0-39.62)\n\nUpgrade: \n\nlibsmbclient:amd64 (3.6.3-2ubuntu2.3, 3.6.3-2ubuntu2.4), \n\ndmsetup:amd64 (1.02.48-4ubuntu7.1, 1.02.48-4ubuntu7.2), \n\napt-transport-https:amd64 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.7, 0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.10), \n\nnautilus:amd64 (3.4.2-0ubuntu6, 3.4.2-0ubuntu7), \n\nlibnss3:amd64 (3.14.1-0ckbi1.93ubuntu.0.12.04.1, 3.14.3-0ubuntu0.12.04.1), \n\nusbmuxd:amd64 (1.0.7-2, 1.0.7-2ubuntu0.1), \n\nlibgudev-1.0-0:amd64 (175-0ubuntu9.2, 175-0ubuntu9.3), \n\nnetwork-manager-gnome:amd64 (0.9.4.1-0ubuntu2, 0.9.4.1-0ubuntu2.1), \n\nsmbclient:amd64 (3.6.3-2ubuntu2.3, 3.6.3-2ubuntu2.4), \n\nthunderbird-locale-en-us:amd64 (17.0.3+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1, 17.0.4+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1), \n\ngstreamer0.10-plugins-good-dbg:amd64 (0.10.31-1ubuntu1.1, 0.10.31-1ubuntu1.2), \n\nlibnm-gtk0:amd64 (0.9.4.1-0ubuntu2, 0.9.4.1-0ubuntu2.1), \n\nbamfdaemon:amd64 (0.2.124.2-0ubuntu1, 0.2.126-0ubuntu1), \n\ngstreamer0.10-plugins-good-doc:amd64 (0.10.31-1ubuntu1.1, 0.10.31-1ubuntu1.2), \n\nperl:amd64 (5.14.2-6ubuntu2.2, 5.14.2-6ubuntu2.3), \n\nlibevince3-3:amd64 (3.4.0-0ubuntu1.5, 3.4.0-0ubuntu1.6), \n\nthunderbird:amd64 (17.0.3+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1, 17.0.4+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1), \n\ngstreamer0.10-gconf:amd64 (0.10.31-1ubuntu1.1, 0.10.31-1ubuntu1.2), \n\nlibdevmapper1.02.1:amd64 (1.02.48-4ubuntu7.1, 1.02.48-4ubuntu7.2), \n\nlinux-generic:amd64 (3.2.0.38.46, 3.2.0.39.47), \n\nlibwbclient0:amd64 (3.6.3-2ubuntu2.3, 3.6.3-2ubuntu2.4), \n\nperl-base:amd64 (5.14.2-6ubuntu2.2, 5.14.2-6ubuntu2.3), \n\nlibnspr4-0d:amd64 (4.9.4-0ubuntu0.12.04.1, 4.9.5-0ubuntu0.12.04.1), \n\nperl-modules:amd64 (5.14.2-6ubuntu2.2, 5.14.2-6ubuntu2.3), \n\nlibapt-inst1.4:amd64 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.7, 0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.10), \n\nlibpam-smbpass:amd64 (3.6.3-2ubuntu2.3, 3.6.3-2ubuntu2.4), \n\ngstreamer0.10-plugins-good:amd64 (0.10.31-1ubuntu1.1, 0.10.31-1ubuntu1.2), \n\napt-utils:amd64 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.7, 0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.10), \n\nsamba-common:amd64 (3.6.3-2ubuntu2.3, 3.6.3-2ubuntu2.4), \n\nudev:amd64 (175-0ubuntu9.2, 175-0ubuntu9.3), \n\napt:amd64 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.7, 0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.10), \n\nlibnm-gtk-common:amd64 (0.9.4.1-0ubuntu2, 0.9.4.1-0ubuntu2.1), \n\nevince-common:amd64 (3.4.0-0ubuntu1.5, 3.4.0-0ubuntu1.6), \n\nlinux-headers-generic:amd64 (3.2.0.38.46, 3.2.0.39.47), \n\nlinux-image-generic:amd64 (3.2.0.38.46, 3.2.0.39.47), \n\nevince:amd64 (3.4.0-0ubuntu1.5, 3.4.0-0ubuntu1.6), \n\nlibapt-pkg4.12:amd64 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.7, 0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.10), \n\nlibdevmapper-event1.02.1:amd64 (1.02.48-4ubuntu7.1, 1.02.48-4ubuntu7.2), \n\nflashplugin-installer:amd64 (11.2.202.273ubuntu0.12.04.1, 11.2.202.275ubuntu0.12.04.1), \n\nsamba:amd64 (3.6.3-2ubuntu2.3, 3.6.3-2ubuntu2.4), \n\ngstreamer0.10-pulseaudio:amd64 (0.10.31-1ubuntu1.1, 0.10.31-1ubuntu1.2), \n\nlibnspr4:amd64 (4.9.4-0ubuntu0.12.04.1, 4.9.5-0ubuntu0.12.04.1), \n\nnautilus-data:amd64 (3.4.2-0ubuntu6, 3.4.2-0ubuntu7), \n\nliblvm2app2.2:amd64 (2.02.66-4ubuntu7.1, 2.02.66-4ubuntu7.2), \n\ngir1.2-gudev-1.0:amd64 (175-0ubuntu9.2, 175-0ubuntu9.3), \n\nlibusbmuxd1:amd64 (1.0.7-2, 1.0.7-2ubuntu0.1), \n\nlibperl5.14:amd64 (5.14.2-6ubuntu2.2, 5.14.2-6ubuntu2.3), \n\nlibudev0:amd64 (175-0ubuntu9.2, 175-0ubuntu9.3), \n\nthunderbird-globalmenu:amd64 (17.0.3+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1, 17.0.4+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1), \n\nthunderbird-gnome-support:amd64 (17.0.3+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1, 17.0.4+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1), \n\nlinux-libc-dev:amd64 (3.2.0-38.61, 3.2.0-39.62), \n\nsamba-common-bin:amd64 (3.6.3-2ubuntu2.3, 3.6.3-2ubuntu2.4), \n\nlibnautilus-extension1a:amd64 (3.4.2-0ubuntu6, 3.4.2-0ubuntu7), \n\niptables:amd64 (1.4.12-1ubuntu4, 1.4.12-1ubuntu5), \n\nlibbamf3-0:amd64 (0.2.124.2-0ubuntu1, 0.2.126-0ubuntu1), \n\nlibnss3-1d:amd64 (3.14.1-0ckbi1.93ubuntu.0.12.04.1, 3.14.3-0ubuntu0.12.04.1), \n\nlibbamf0:amd64 (0.2.124.2-0ubuntu1, 0.2.126-0ubuntu1), \n\nthunderbird-locale-en:amd64 (17.0.3+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1, 17.0.4+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1)\n\nEnd-Date: 2013-03-23  09:12:14\n\n\nA: Go back to the 3.2.0-38 kernel. There is a bug for the 39 version of the kernel for some users. Please check it here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1157786\n\nA: User 143338 was correct - the problem apparently is in that version of the Kernel. Fortunately, unless you explicitly remove them, previous versions of the kernel are still on your machine. Kernel updates are installed by the same process that installs the other updates, and can be un-installed the same way.   For the benefit of anyone else with this issue, here are some details on how to fix it:\n1) Confirm that this is what's wrong.\nWhen booting, the boot menu will present you with several choices, one of which is \"Previous versions of Linux\". Select this, and boot with 3.2.0-38. Your machine should now run as it did before the last update. If it does not, look elsewhere for an answer.

I tried installing rEFIt and rEFInd on my Mac but neither seemed to help. How can I make it work? Is there any other boot menu intended for USBs? (rEFIt says on it's website it doesn't support USBs that great) Is there any way to manually program it? It is really important for me. \nThe USB drive is a San Disk Cruzer Pop 8 GB.\n\nA: You could try installing the rEFInd driver for whatever Linux filesystem you used on the USB flash drive. (rEFInd comes with ext2/3fs, ext4fs, and ReiserFS drivers.) That might enable rEFInd to read and boot the kernel, but you'll also need to either manually enter kernel options (by pressing F2 or Insert twice after you highlight the Linux option) or create a /boot/refind_linux.conf file to hold those options.\nIf installing the appropriate filesystem driver doesn't help, then chances are the EFI isn't activating the USB flash drive. It might be possible to write a simple EFI driver to do this, but that would take a fair amount of expertise to do.\n", "Q: How to supervise a process and schedule a periodic restart?

In Awesome session, If I double click a plain text file(txt, asc, rb, py etc.) in Thunar, it opens with Abi Word. But I want it to open with a text editor not a word processor. In Xubuntu/Xfce session, it does open with text editor(Leafpad). How could I fix it without setting it for various text files?\n\nA: If you're using Xfce 4.10, then you can Settings > MIME Type Editor, then set text/plain to whatever text editor you want. I'm not sure if this will take care of all possible file extensions associated with plain text files, but my hunch is that it should help. \n\nA: On Ubuntu the default applications are set in /usr/share/applications/defaults.list (root access) and override by ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list (user access).\nI would suggest editing the second file unless you intend to make your change permanent on several sessions.\n\nA: Right click on a text file > Properties > Open With: > (whatever application you want)\nor\nRight click on a text file > Open With: > Open With Other Application... > (select and check \"Use as default for this kind of file\"\nYou use Awesome WM but I hope it is only a Thunar's affair, so the solution may be the above.\n\nA: I couldn't find the default application in ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list noted in other answers, instead mine was in ~/.config/mimeapps.list as indicated in this answer. Per the comments, there are also other possible locations.\n\nA: I haven't used Awesome WM and don't understand why you're seeing what you're seeing.

How could I fix it without setting it for various text files?\"\nTo my mind, when most of us, irrespective of operating systems, double-click on an .html file, the file opens in our chosen browser and not in a text editor.\n\nAnyway, one possibility is that your ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list is corrupted. Make a backup of this file and then delete the existing one. Log out and log back in. The file you've deleted will be recreated and populated as you open files.

I can only see some piece of the background.\n\nA: According to Ubuntu Wiki you can use following options to set your screen resolution to correct value:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resetting an out-of-range resolution\nIf you set a resolution inappropriate for your monitor in the Screen Resolution GUI tool, you can reset it from a terminal by running:\n$ rm ~/.config/monitors.xml\n\n\n*Dynamically testing different resolutions\nYou can either use the Screen Resolution GUI tool to experiment with different resolutions, or the more powerful xrandr command-line tool. Without parameters, xrandr shows you the names of different outputs available on your system (LVDS, VGA-0, etc.) and resolutions available on each:\n$ xrandr\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1400 x 1050, maximum 1400 x 1400\nVGA disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nLVDS connected 1400x1050+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 286mm x 214mm\n   1400x1050      60.0*+   50.0  \n[...]\n\nYou can direct xrandr to set a different resolution like this:\n$ xrandr --output LVDS --mode 1024x768\n$ xrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1024x768\n\nThe refresh rate may also be changed, either at the same time or independently:\n$ xrandr --output LVDS --mode 1024x768 --rate 75\n$ xrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1024x768 --rate 60\n\nSetting xrandr changes persistently\nThere are several ways to make xrandr customizations permanent from session to session: a) .xprofile, b) kdm/gdm, c) xorg.conf. Each of these mechanisms will be discussed in turn.\nSetting xrandr commands in .xprofile\nA user's ~/.xprofile file is executed on Xorg startup if it exists and is executable. You can copy and paste xrandr command line strings into this file so they're executed when you log in. For example:\n$ xrandr --output VGA-0 --mode 800x600\n\nThere are two disadvantages to using .xprofile for xrandr settings. First, it occurs fairly late in the startup process, so you'll see some resolution resizing during the initial screen draw; in some cases panel windows may resize improperly as a result. Second, as this is a per-user setting, it won't affect the resolutions of other users, nor will it alter the resolution on the login screen.\nSetting xrandr commands in kdm/gdm startup scripts\nBoth KDM and GDM have startup scripts that are executed when X is initiated. For GDM, these are in /etc/gdm/ , while for KDM this is done at /etc/kde4/kdm/Xsetup. In either case, you can paste in an xrandr command line string into one of these scripts. For GDM, try putting them right before\ninitctl -q emit login-session-start DISPLAY_MANAGER=gdm\n\nin /etc/gdm/Init/Default.\nThis process requires root access and mucking around in system config files, but will take effect earlier in the startup process than using .xprofile, and will apply to all users including the login screen.\nSetting resolution changes in xorg.conf\nWhile xorg.conf is largely empty these days, it can still be used for setting up resolutions. For example:\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier      \"External DVI\"\n    Modeline        \"1280x1024_60.00\"  108.88  1280 1360 1496 1712  1024 1025 1028 1060  -HSync +Vsync\n    Option          \"PreferredMode\" \"1280x1024_60.00\"\nEndSection\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier      \"ATI Technologies, Inc. M22 [Radeon Mobility M300]\"\n    Driver          \"ati\"\n    Option          \"Monitor-DVI-0\" \"External DVI\"\nEndSection\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier      \"Primary Screen\"\n    Device          \"ATI Technologies, Inc.

There's no work-around for the lack of the ALT key, and the lack renders the program almost unusable.\nI tried uninstalling and reinstalling the program itself and Wine, but that didn't make any difference.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Firstly, I should try disabling alt + mouse click window movement in your window manager.\nThat is noted in the useful wine FAQ as a possible fix:\n\nEven in full screen mode, window managers typically capture some keys. For example, in KDE and GNOME, Alt+Left Click is used to move the whole application window by default. Thus, this key combination is not available to applications in Wine. You have to disable the colliding combinations in your window manager.\n\nYou may also want to try earlier versions of wine with playonlinux as well as the fix discussed above, if just the fix itself doesn't work.\nPlayonlinux allows you to select older wine versions, install your program in a fresh wineprefix, and then use the specified wine version to run your program. It doesn't matter what version of wine you have installed to the system.\nFirstly, install the program with:\nsudo apt-get install playonlinux\n\n1) Start playonlinux and go to tools > manage wine versions and view the list of  older versions that you can install. Select the version you want and click the arrow to the right and go through the installation procedure.\nThe available versions go right back to wine 0.9 and to the latest 1.5 release, and so there should be a version that will be useful for you and solves the problem. \n\n2) Now, go to file > install > 'install a non listed program' and choose 'install a program in a new virtual drive'. Now, you can get to the screen below and select the version of wine that you want to use.\n\n3) Finish the installation by going through the various screens and playonlinux will complete the process and should give you a launcher on the desktop. If not, the program will be available within the initial playonlinux menu screen.\n\nFor backing up your prefix and settings within playonlinux, please see my answer here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to backup virtual drives with PlayOnLinux?\n", "Q: Distorted and sped up audio in Wine 1.4 while using Spotify on Ubuntu 12.04 I have two applications that run through Wine that will sometimes get horribly distorted and \"sped forward\" (I can see in Spotify that the files are played back much faster than they should be). I tested it today and was able to play music in Spotify for a while, perhaps 15 minutes. I also tried to test audio in Wine and that seemed fine, too. I started the other application and the sound was fine there too, for the most part: it was a little choppy sometimes which seemed to correlate with how rapidly I changed between audio tracks. In Spotify, though the sound was mostly fine, there was some small hiccups with the playback sometimes, but I don't know if that is a symptom of the overarching problem with Wine.\nAfter a while Spotify began to ouput audio that was distorted and sped-forward. It was pretty consistent; sometimes it would return to normal, but for the most part it was just useless. The other application and wine-config audio testoutputted horrible audio, too. \nDriver used: winealsa.drv. \n\nA: Please Note: In the comments above I suggested alternatives to using wine to run Spotify, so that audio problems could be avoided. The OP was pleased by these comments and so here's a quick answer in case it is of use to anyone else as well. When alternatives to using wine exist (as they do in another context with Steam on Linux), it seems reasonable to discuss them instead of spending hours debugging wine.\n\nThere are two main alternatives to using Spotify in wine:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Spotify Preview for Linux client\n\n*The platform independent beta browser based solution (flash required)\n\n\nHow to install the client has been discussed elsewhere and on this site, so I thought I would briefly mention the in-browser solution for Spotify. It seems to support both free and paid accounts, and even though it is technically in beta, anyone with a Spotify account can use it. It obviously requires the flashplugin installed, so a browser such as firefox or google-chrome are ideal. The streaming quality seems to be fine and the audio issue free, unlike sometimes the situation in wine. It does, however, obviously depend on the quality of your network connection. \nFor more information I should read these OMGUbuntu spotify articles, which discuss in depth the alternatives available, and how to install the client if you want to compare both means of using Spotify. It is only surmise, but Spotify seem to be directing more resources to Spotify in browser than their clients (the Linux based one hasn't been updated for a while). This is probably because the browser version is platform independent and the obvious move for a cloud service (particularly in view of the rise of other Google alternatives,etc.).\nHere's a screenshot from the browser version of Spotify.\n\n", "Q: GRUB \"no such partition error\" I have a dual booted Windows/Linux computer.\nToday when I turn it on, it says:  \nerror: no such partition.\nGrubrescue > \n\nWhat do I do?\n\nA: I recently have the same thing happen to me after an update.

Obviously, I should do it from the terminal, but I have no idea how to perform a lossless batch operation. All of the tutorials mention cropping etc., but I don't need those operations.\nTherefore, my question is:\nWhat should I type in the terminal to perform lossless optimization (i.e. only strip meta data I guess) of the folder with images (e.g. ExampleFolder).\nThank you in advance!\n\nA: Also, if you need jpegtran, you can find it in the libjpeg-turbo-progs package. This has all the optimisation features of its Windows counterpart but you have to use it via the command line and it's frankly, quite a pain to use.\nThere are other ways of looping over files, but here I'll use find. The following will look for *.jpgs in the current directory. (Note this is not the same as previous versions of this post, for simplicity)\ncd /path/with/jpgs\nfind . -exec jpegtran -optimize -outfile \"{}.opti.jpg\" \"{}\" \\;\n\nIf you want it to save over itself, you can. Change the -outfile argument to \"{}\".\n\nA: The simplest way is with a different tool (jpegoptim):\n$ sudo apt-get install jpegoptim\n$ cd /directory/with/my/jpgs\n$ jpegoptim *.jpg\n19112008152.jpg 2592x1944 24bit Exif IPTC  [OK] 654743 --> 624552 bytes (4.61%), optimized.\n19112008153.jpg 1944x2592 24bit Exif  [OK] 516927 --> 503801 bytes (2.54%), optimized.\n19112008154.jpg 2592x1944 24bit Exif IPTC  [OK] 943392 --> 911266 bytes (3.41%), optimized.\n19112008155.jpg 2592x1944 24bit Exif IPTC  [OK] 919962 --> 894754 bytes (2.74%), optimized.\n19112008156.jpg 2592x1944 24bit Exif  [OK] 869388 --> 836059 bytes (3.83%), optimized.\n19112008157.jpg 2592x1944 24bit Exif  [OK] 815169 --> 787316 bytes (3.42%), optimized.\n19112008158.jpg 2592x1944 24bit Exif IPTC  [OK] 481438 --> 445175 bytes (7.53%), optimized.\n19112008159.jpg 2592x1944 24bit Exif  [OK] 686519 --> 660520 bytes (3.79%), optimized.\n19112008160.jpg 2592x1944 24bit Exif  [OK] 326367 --> 287568 bytes (11.89%), optimized.\n19112008161.jpg 1944x2592 24bit Exif  [OK] 331862 --> 295984 bytes (10.81%), optimized.\n\nThere are quite a few options:\njpegoptim v1.2.3  Copyright (c) Timo Kokkonen, 1996-2009.\nUsage: jpegoptim [options] <filenames> \n\n  -d<path>, --dest=<path>\n                  specify alternative destination directory for \n                  optimized files (default is to overwrite originals)\n  -f, --force     force optimization\n  -h, --help      display this help and exit\n  -m[0..100], --max=[0..100] \n                  set maximum image quality factor (disables lossless\n                  optimization mode, which is by default on)\n  -n, --noaction  don't really optimize files, just print results\n  -o, --overwrite overwrite target file even if it exists\n  -p, --preserve  preserve file timestamps\n  -q, --quiet     quiet mode\n  -t, --totals    print totals after processing all files\n  -v, --verbose   enable verbose mode (positively chatty)\n  -V, --version   print program version\n\n  --strip-all     strip all (Comment & Exif) markers from output file\n  --strip-com     strip Comment markers from output file\n  --strip-exif    strip Exif markers from output file\n  --strip-iptc    strip IPTC markers from output file\n  --strip-icc     strip ICC profile markers from output file\n\n", "Q: Seeing apt-get changelogs for to-be-upgraded packages This question describes how to get the changelog for a given package. However, it's the whole changelog.\nWhat I'd like is a way to see what will be changed in whatever I'm about to upgrade. For example, I was imagining something like:\n$ sudo apt-get upgrade --show-changelogs\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\nCalculating upgrade...

Does this or something similar exist?\nUPDATE: I've written a short blog post talking about apt-listchanges and Debian changelogs in a little more depth that incorporates some of the feedback in this question.\n\nA: The nearest thing to what you are looking for can be had with a package called apt-listchanges, which will give you a changelog summary when you upgrade packages. You can set it up so the changelog notes appear in the terminal directly after apt-get downloads the upgrade (see below explanation and screenshot), but before you install it.\nYou can install the program with \nsudo apt-get install apt-listchanges\n\nand then set it up with \nsudo dpkg-reconfigure apt-listchanges\n\nThe setup file created is /etc/apt/listchanges.conf. \nMy setup has the changelog information being shown directly as text in the terminal (stdout), which is just what you wanted. I find this is better than having a pager load up the information. I just have changelogs selected in my conf file, so the news about the package is not shown. I have also set it up to email root the excerpt of the changelog. You need to set up local email by referencing my article here if you want to use this feature.\nThis is my /etc/apt/listchanges.conf:\n[apt]\nfrontend=text\nemail_address=root\nconfirm=1\nsave_seen=/var/lib/apt/listchanges.db\nwhich=changelogs\n\nA screenshot of the upgrade procedure when apt-listchanges is installed.

Open a terminal and type ifconfig which will show you several network devices like the following:\n\nIn your case, instead of seeing wlan0 like in my image, you will see something like ppp0. If you want to see specific information about your PPP connection then do something like this: ifconfig ppp0.\nLooking at your images we have the following:\n\nThis image shows the IP you are receiving from Internet (From outside of your LAN network). In this case it is the 10.40.26.151\n\nThis image shows the IP you are receiving from LAN (From inside of your LAN network). In this case it is the 192.168.2.160 and the Router or Server IP that is assigning you that IP is 192.168.2.1.\nNow looking at both images I see you are using eth0 for both cases. If this is the same computer then I recommend connecting ppp0 to another network card and eth0 to the LAN if you want to have both types of connection. You can only have one type of connection per network device.\n", "Q: How to remove TuxCut app from Ubuntu 12.04 I've installed tuxcut but it's in different language.\nI've tried removing it using dpkg but didn't worked so I downloaded a English version and tried installing it.

While the man-db cache is supposed to enhance the manual page system's speed and functionality, I have not experienced any noticeable performance degradation or functional problem after disabling the trigger.\n\nA: Might be helpful for someone: I ran into this issue on our CI regularly.\nJust execute the following:\nsudo apt-get remove -y --purge man-db\n\nThe command removes the man-db package completely, which in our case on CI, was completely useless anyway.\n\nA: It's possible the mandb index is corrupted.\ncheck the index and recreate it \nsudo mandb -t\nrm -rf /var/cache/man\nsudo mandb -c\n\n\nA: I have had the same problem when I was installing apache web server on my digital ocean droplet. After waited a bit, I simply just stop the process and rerun the command. It shows the apache is already installed and it worked. \nI hope it can still help.\n\nA: Processing triggers for man-db is I/O bound, and can be painfully slow if you are on a HDD, or Google Cloud's default disk storage tier.\nUpgrade your disk\n\nA: Since I sometimes need the man pages.\nAnd since there doesn't seem to be a stand-alone 'man' package, I can't simply remove 'man-db'.\nMy solution, for better or worse, was to move the 'mandb' executable out of the way and substitute in a copy of 'true'\nOn my system:\nsudo mv /usr/bin/mandb /usr/bin/mandb-OFF\nsudo cp -p /bin/true /usr/bin/mandb \nsudo rm -r /var/cache/man\n\nThis is easy to undo if the need arises.  And I deleted the /var/cach/man directory, as it is no longer needed and recovered megabytes of space.\nAny 'man' pages you need are grabbed from the source man directory and decompressed on the fly.  No more caching means a slight inefficiency, but with today's speeder processors and disks, its minimal.\nA caveat: Anytime you get a man-db package update, your modifications will be  overwritten.  Either apt-hold the 'man-db' package or be prepared to redo this at the whim of the 'man-db' package maintainers and distribution managers.\nAfter this mod, you will still see the line \"Processing triggers for man-db\" fly by but it's a zero second thing. :-)\nGood Luck.\n", "Q: dirscancb problem show in log file In the log file of my Ubuntu 12.04 installation, there are long list of log entries as below:\nrpc.idmapd[818]: dirscancb: open(/run/rpc_pipefs/nfs/clntfa): No such file or directory\nrpc.idmapd[818]: dirscancb: open(/run/rpc_pipefs/nfs/clntfb): No such file or directory\nWhat is wrong with my installation?

You don't want each to be allocated a maximum 25% of bandwidth, because that would mean that there is bandwidth that is going unused.  You probably, instead, want the two that are downloading a large file to each get 50% of the bandwidth, but for that to drop if one of the idle clients suddenly starts utilising the connection.  Now, as long as this is the behaviour you want, you don't have to do anything to achieve this; internet routers will do this anyway given other factors (number of connections open per client, buffers, etc) are equal.\nNow, let's say that you have four clients and two are idle, one is downloading a large file using a single TCP connection, and another is downloading using 50 TCP connections (which may be the case if they're using a peer to peer service, for example).  You don't want the person using 50 connections to be getting 50x the bandwidth as the person using one connection.  Without any kind of shaping, this is what would happen under most internet routers.\nQoS is an umbrella term for a variety of different ways of shaping traffic through a router.  Note that you will only have control over the outgoing bandwidth from your clients, not incoming - that would need to be shaped on your ISP's side to be effective.\nWith QoS you can give some types of traffic, such as HTTP traffic, priority over other types of traffic.  Or, you can give each client a minimum guaranteed bandwidth that, if they need it, they can have it (but if they're not using it, others can still use it).  This is probably the way to go, IF your router does support that type of QoS control (which not all do).\nSince you can only shape the outgoing bandwidth, this will have limited effect, but it can still have an influence on incoming bandwidth - every incoming data connection relies on periodic feedback from the receiving end that they are receiving the data.\n", "Q: How to install JavaScript Eclipse platform on Ubuntu I sudo apt-get install eclipse installed Eclipse on my Ubuntu 12.0.4 server, by checking I found it is a classic platform.

Attempting to purge old kernel versions following this answer, I accidentally removed also the current version. I reinstalled it and rebooted, but now the Unity bar and all window title bars are not showing. Any ideas why?\nSee recent dpkg.log.\nUpdate: See output of unity. There's something about OpenGL in there but I don't know what to make out of it.\n\nA: If you need to fix this as soon as possible, you might want to skip to the end (\"Treat it as a Unity/Compiz problem.\"). But, as explained there, I recommend performing the other troubleshooting steps and possible solutions first.\nCheck if the correct kernel is running.\nCheck that you're actually running the latest version of the kernel by running the command:\nuname -r\n\nThat will give you the version you are running now. If it's wrong, make sure the correct version is being selected in the GRUB menu (by shutting down and rebooting, and selecting it manually). If it's not available, make sure it's really installed.\nYou can use apt-cache policy X to check if X is installed and what versions of X are available.\nYou can list installed packages related to the linux kernel with:\ndpkg -l | grep linux-\n\nWorking around the problem, until it is solved (so you can fix it):\nTo run commands and use the machine while working on fixing this problem, you can work around the problem by installing the gnome-session-fallback  package and selecting GNOME Classic or GNOME Classic (no effects) on the login screen.\nIf the current UI problem prevents you from installing that graphically or in a Terminal window, then you can switch to a virtual console to install it. To do that, press Ctrl+Alt+F1. Then log in and install it the same way you would in a Terminal window, by running:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback\n\nAlt+F7 brings you back to the GUI.\nIf your Ubuntu system is configured to log you in automatically, and you cannot access the Log Off option from the session indicator (which is part of the top panel), then you can log out by opening a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and running the command:\ngnome-session-quit --logout\n\nIf you can open a graphical Terminal window, then from the virtual console you can try running sudo restart lightdm, but that will probably just start a new automatic login for you. Therefore, it may be necessary (in the virtual console) to run cat /etc/lightdm/lightdm/conf to verify that automatic login is configured through lightdm.conf (it will look like this), then temporarily disable it by renaming the file so it is not used:\nmv /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.old\n\nThen running sudo restart lightdm should give you a login screen.\nCheck your video drivers.\nAssuming you're running the latest version of the kernel, make sure you're running the right video drivers. If you installed your video drivers through Additional Drivers (or didn't manually install video drivers, or don't remember doing so), go there. In a GNOME Classic session, you should be able to find Additional Drivers in Applications > Preferences.\nOr you can run Additional Drivers manually:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Ubuntu 12.04 and earlier, run the command gksu jockey-gtk from a GUI Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+F2), or from the Run... text box (Alt+F2).\n\n*In Ubuntu 12.10 and later, open Software Sources (gksu software-properties-gtk) and go to the Additional Drivers tab.\n\n\n(In both cases, I only recommend running the command with gksu in your particular situation, in case the window management problems you're experiencing get in the way of authenticating with PolicyKit. Ordinarily, you can just run jockey-gtk or software-properties-gtk, then when you want to make a change that requires administrative power, you're automatically prompted for your password. PolicyKit spawns an ordinary window for authentication, whereas running gksu manually should produce a full-screen, foreground dialog box that displays reasonably correctly even when the window manager is not working properly.)\nIf you installed your video drivers in some other way, you may need to do it again, to reinstall them.\n\n\n*\n\n*This may have the effect of reinstalling them, or of reconfiguring them so they work again.\n\n\nTreat it as a Unity/Compiz problem.\nIf none of the above helps--and there's a substantial likelihood that it will not--then the problem is mostly likely in Compiz, and you can fix it with the solutions given for this related problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unity doesn't load, no Launcher, no Dash appears\nI understand that problem is different from what you're experiencing, in that you are able to get windows to appear (they just don't have their borders, which include their title bars). However, Compiz is what provides those borders and title bars, as well as what provides Unity with the ability to show its user interface elements. (Unity is a Nux plugin, so it uses Compiz to display everything, not just discrete window borders.)\nIf you like, you might try this first. But I recommend doing the above troubleshooting first, because if you skip to this, you might fix the symptom while leaving the underlying cause unaddressed. (For example, if your video drivers are not working properly, that can cause problems with Compiz, but might cause future performance or stability problems even after this specific Compiz-related problem is solved.)\n", "Q: Can't access Windows 7 partition and blkid crashes when I try I found nothing about this specific problem on the internet so I'm asking for help here:\nOnce I had Windows 7 and Ubuntu on dual boot working flawlessly. Then I bought a new internal 1 TB HD and decided to install Win 7 and Ubuntu on it. I followed these steps after plugging the new HD (thus having two HDs):\nWith Win7 installation dvd:\n\n\n*\n\n*On my new internal HD (1TB) I created 3 primary MBR partitions formatted as NTFS and left some free space to later install Ubuntu. (1st partition with 200 GB for Windows, 2nd and 3rd with 300 GB each to keep media and other documents, and 200 GB of free space).  \n\n*I installed Win7 Ultimate on the first partition (200 GB) without problems, transfered my media files to 2nd and 3rd partitions and formatted my old HD (which has 250 GB).\n\n\nThen I inserted Ubuntu live CD to install it and rebooted as it demanded:\n\n\n*\n\n*The machine booted with live cd but when I got the choose-what-to-do installation screen, it didn't show me the option to \"install alongside Windows\". There was only two options, \"install ubuntu\" and \"something else\".\n\n*I chose \"something else\" and followed till the partitions-handling screen. This screen did show all 3 primary NTFS partitions with correct sizes and the unpartitioned space.  \n\n*Then I created 3 logical partitions on the free space (one for /, other for /home and other for swap) and chose to install bootloader on the HD (not on any particular partition).\n\n\nAfter finished the installation process I rebooted as normal and, as I already suspected that could happen, the machine booted directly onto ubuntu. As the installer didn't recognize the win7 installation, there was no entry for it on grub2.\nThen, more odd, when I opened Nautilus, the 2nd and 3rd NTFS partitions with my media files WERE there for me to mount and access (and I did access them without problems), but the Win7 partition simply wasn't there. The same happened on Dolphin and Krusader when I tried them.\nStill odd, Disk Utility DOES show win7 partition and shows that it is NTFS and has a bootable flag, but under \"Usage:\", where other partitions say \"filesystem\" it shows only a \"-\", no label (or \"unknown\" on the graphical representation of the disk) and no possibility to mount.\nI then opened terminal and tried \"sudo blkid\", and got no return but a popup saying that blkid has crashed. On the details of the message, the title of the message is blkid crashed with SIGSEGV in blkid_do_safeprobe()\", the SegvReason says \"reading unknown VMA and the SegvAnalysis says:\nSegfault happened at: 0x7fa9ac7e17b6:   mov  0x4(%rsi),%eax  \nPC(0x7fa9ac7e17b6) ok  \nsource\"0x4(%rsi)\" (0xfffffffffa1e8c4c) not located in a known VMA region (needed readable region)!  \ndestination \"%eax\" ok  \n\nOddly enough, when I tried sudo fdisk -l it DID show a list of all partitions correctly, INCLUDING the 1st NTFS partition with correct size, boot flag, but no mount point and nothing about it having windows on it.\nI rebooted the machine several times, and whenever I open any program that calls blkid I get this popup saying that blkid crashed, for example, \"NTFS Configuration Tool\", \"MountManager\" AND sometimes even the native Ubuntu updater makes blkid crash in the middle of the update, although the overall update process never stalled.\nAlso, when I try to mount that partition on terminal using \"mount\" command (with or without sudo), it returns that I don't have permission to do that, even though I am the only user and it's an administrator account.\nAfter all that, I still had to do some tweaks to be able to boot on my Windows7 (restore Windows bootloader and, on Windows, use EasyBCD to add an Ubuntu entry on the win bootloader 'cause I don't know how to edit Grub2 manually and even if I did, I'm not sure it would work given the situation).\nTo try one last thing, I formatted and excluded the logical partitions where Ubuntu was and reinstalled Ubuntu on that old 250 GB HD I still have. But the results were EXACTLY the same. Here's what sudo fdisk -l returns (sda is aa third HD I didn't mentioned cause it only has some old files and no OS.

I have tried following the advice on other posts but nothing has worked so now I'm trying to retrieve a few files from root.disk from Windows7.\nHere is what I have tried:\nI booted into ubuntu and when faced with the login screen ctrl+shift+F1 and logged in with that. Updated all my packages and tried to log in the usual way again. No Dice.\nI logged in that way again and tried to copy some files over to /media/DATA (this is a general purpose windows-friendly storage partition). Permission Denied. sudo doesn't work and su wont accept my password. \nI got into recovery mode root and opened up /media/DATA . ls tells me that it is empty (it is not). I made a new folder for my backups. This new folder shows up with ls. cp started the copy without complaint but then I ran out of disk space on DATA. I booted into Windows and the backups directory isn't where I left it and I have loads of space left. Back in recovery mode the backup folder is still visible but nothing else on DATA is... spooky.\nMy next approach was to find something that I could use to open up root.disk via windows. I have seen lots of recommendations for programs on this forum but they either dont work on windows7, only have corrupted versions available for download, or just wont open the .disks as is.\nSo my question is:\nHow can I make data stored in a wubi disk image available to Windows7?\n\nA: Use this tool: ext2read\nDownload, extract, run, open up the \\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk file, and copy your data.\n\nA: Two ways that could work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in with Ctrl + Alt + F1.

What package should I install to be able to read files with iso-8859-1 latin1 encoding?\nCurrently, I only see strange characters instead of text.\n% locale\n\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\nLANGUAGE=\nLC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_TIME=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_COLLATE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MESSAGES=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_PAPER=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_NAME=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_ADDRESS=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_TELEPHONE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MEASUREMENT=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_ALL=\n\n\nA: The latin1 encoding is \"mostly\" compatible with UTF-8, since both encodings are supersets of ASCII. This means that you should see normal letters (a-z) but not diacritics (é, è, and so on). Let's try to understand what is the actual encoding of your file.\nFirst, the file command can sometimes detect the encoding. Simply use:\n$ file weird_file\n\nYou could get weird_file: ISO-8859 text for latin1, weird_file: UTF-8 Unicode text for UTF-8, or something else. Now, if you determined that it is latin1, the best way to display it is actually to open an editor, like gedit, and choose the correct encoding when opening the file. If you want to convert the file to UTF-8, you can then 'Save as' and ask for UTF-8.\nIf you still don't know the encoding, try to open the document with Libre Office, it's usually good at detection. It's also possible that your file is corrupted (eg. UTF-8 text interpreted as latin1 and saved as UTF-8), or, more likely, that it never contained text.

There the root directory may be the directory you extracted (if the compressed file contains a directory).\nIn your specific case, the application root seems to be in /usr/share/dbeaver. You can try to place there the files but you will need root permission. Also it is not a very good solution, so check one of the following options first.\nIn your case, you seem to be trying to install this, and the manual driver installation should only be needed if you downloaded the .zip version. From the website:\n\nNote: Generally you don’t need to download this archive. It may be useful if you are going to use DBeaver in an environment without internet access.\n\nSo check if the application don't comes already with those drivers. If not check if it has not a functionality inside the application to install them.\nIndeed the application allows you to install the drivers, but for some reason the installation always fails (on the .deb version, maybe because of no write permission). So you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the .zip version and uninstall the .deb version: after you download just extract the folder contained on that archive and place it wherever you want. The root directory of the application will be that directory so you just place there the needed .jar's. If it doesn't work try place them on the plugins subdir.\n\n*You will have to specify the paths to the drivers on the application. Go to \"Database\" -> \"Driver manager\". There select the driver you want and press \"Edit\". You will see something asking you to install the driver. Press \"OK\". \n\nIt will then probably fail but press \"Ignore\". You will see the following screen:\n\ndelete the red item (by selecting it and pressing \"Delete\") and use \"Add Folder\" to specify the location where you extracted the JDBC drivers.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: Toshiba Satellite S855 & Ubuntu 12.10 & Radeon HD 7600M issues I just got a Toshiba S855 (i7-3630QM) machine, with Windows 8 pre-installed, and have been through a nightmare to make it work alongside Ubuntu 12.10.\nMaking it dual boot was not the issue, after I found the proper instructions on how to deal with the UEFI stuff. The problem came after having it boot into Ubuntu; at first the OS booted fine, but after installing the recommended updates, the screen just went crazy; only a small frame at the top, flickering, and no access to text-mode screens either.\nAfter booting into recovery mode, I found that X was reporting a problem accessing the ATI card's VBIOS, resulting in a 'No Screen Found' error.\nI tried nearly everything I found around ... removing fglrx*; reinstalling the linux headers after or before fglrx; used the ATI drivers; used the OpenSource drivers; to no avail.\nAfter 3 or 4 reinstallations, I found that the issue is being caused by the latest kernel image suggested by the update manager. The USB image I used for installing came with 3.5.0-17, and the update manager suggested 3.5.0-26. So what I did was to lock the former version in Synaptic, applying all updates but the kernel update, and Ubuntu is working like a charm now.\nI'm aware that maybe having an outdated kernel is not the best solution, but it was the only way I found to make it work.\nSo, can anyone out there confirm that there are issues with the latest suggested kernel updates and ATI Radeon cards? The (horrible) downside on Toshiba machines is that the built-in Intel GPU is not accessible, so no way of switching over to Intel graphics.\nIs there an easy way to go back to a previous kernel image after reinstalling a new one? I know that old entries are kept in GRUB, but in my case, after installing 3.5.0-26, even booting into 3.5.0-17 did not worked well ... same screen freeze issue.\nHow can I know if 13.04 will break my install?\nAny light on this will be appreciated.\n\nA: I've got a little less severe display problem using open source drivers for AMD Radeon 7400M Series under Ubuntu 12.10 when I recently upgraded kernel from 3.5.0-26 to 3.5.0-27 which I could luckily solve by simply selecting the previous version from the Grub menu and then removing the latest kernel packages.\nIf you continue experiencing such severe problems it seems you might like to use a Clonezilla live CD/USB to make a backup of your Ubuntu partition before a kernel upgrade as probably a better alternative to having to re-install Ubuntu.\nAnother thing you can perhaps consider doing might also be trying Ubuntu 13.04 first from a live DVD/USB before upgrading.\n", "Q: Upgrading from 12.04 to 12.10 I have a bootable disk of 12.10 and currently system is running 12.04\nI am looking for a method where I upgrade to 12.10 without loosing data by bootable disk \n\nA: If you boot your computer from the new Ubuntu 12.10 disk you should have an Upgrade option, but I prefer upgrading via Software Updater.\n", "Q: Recording sounds straight from sound card I'm trying to record sounds straight from my sound card.

So far so good, it works beautifully. But I'd like to still access the external backup drive's Time Machine contents. The drive was untouched during the install of Ubuntu. It's just an external 1TB USB drive. Problem is, the partition type is AF05 (Apple Core Storage) and not HFS+.

They also mention on the front page that non-encrypted partition support is still being worked on.\n\nA: The best option that I've found thus far is to boot into MacOS recovery(you'll have to create a recovery disk), disable FileVault protection from there, and then to boot into linux (14.04 in my case) and mount the now HFS+ partition using hfsexplorer and extract the files that way. I know it's not quite what you're looking for, but more of a workaround to get at your files. \n", "Q: How to manage partition for setup ubuntu 12.10? I want to setup Ubuntu but I don't know how to manage partition, I just know that I have to create a swap, ex4 and home partition but I don't know how to create this partition? \nWhat type of partition do I need for setup Ubuntu, primary or logical?\n\nA: You can have only 4 (four) Primary Partitions on a disk. So you only need to create an Extended Partition and then have as many Logical Partitions in it as you might need if you will need more than 4 partitions on that disk. For Ubuntu it doesn't matter if it's installed on a primary or logical partition.\nYou can create something like 15GB Root partition (mounted as \"/\") and 15GB Home partition (mounted as \"/home\") (both Ext4 format) and then a Swap partition (twice or equal to the size of your RAM - there are different opinions). But you can also change partition sizes later although you'll need to boot from a live CD/DVD/USB (e.g. Parted Magic) to do it.\n\nA: The installation of ubuntu is able to define a partition table by itself, so usually there's no need for you to create these partition yourself, as long as you do not intend to setup a dualboot system (windows + ubuntu).\nIf you have a windows system running, you can also install ubuntu with the wubi installer, this gives you a user interface guided installation, and is probably the best way to set up ubuntu for a beginner with less experience on setting up operating systems.\nSo if theres no need for you to specify your installation of ubuntu, you should not be afraid of simply trying. If you want a certian configuration that requires a own partition table feel free to ask.\n", "Q: problems maintaining interent connection with static IP I have been attempting to set up Ubuntu 12.04 with a static IP (with information provided by my university) as well as the local cycling IP on a workstation with two ethernet ports.

If the nameserver addresses are not correct then that needs to be investigated. Since eth0 is configured via DHCP, presumably those addresses are provided by the DHCP server to the local DHCP client and submitted to resolvconf which puts them into resolv.conf.\n\nA: Is NetworkManager running?

There are certain software updates done by Ubuntu automatically without asking for password recently.  Every now and then it now prompts me that \"some errors have occurred\" and asking me to REPORT by entering my password.\nIs this a normal behavior or some malicious software at work ?\n\nA: No, this is no malicious software, this is just part of the Linux-development and bugfix network. You enter your password in order to garant the reporting tool access to the information needed to create a ticket.\nThis is basically the idea of Linux: nothing is allowed until you admit it.\nWindows: everything is allowed except you forbid it. ;-)\nThis principle is the reason for Linux based OS to be more secure than others.

I can open the files just fine on another computer, so I know it's not the network or the file.  Any suggestions?\n\nA: You cannot open a .exe file in ubuntu this is a windows specific file format.\nOpen office an its pendant libre office can  be downloaded as a seperate ubuntu/linux version. You can identify the selfextracting packages unter ubuntu by the ending .deb.\nHere's the download site with open office for all available platforms.

Ubuntu and Windows 7 both need to be running 24/7 in parallel. \nThere's just no reason for me to run a web server on any other platform than Linux, however, I need to be able to use Windows 7 for work and other miscellaneous programs.\nWhat is the best route for me to take so that I can install Ubuntu Linux, so that it's always running, while still allowing me to run Windows 7 simultaneously?\nOh, as a side note, I also occasionally play video games, so I would like it if Windows 7 ran smoothly. I've had a terrible experience with wine in the past, but if that's what's recommended, I guess I'll use that then.\nI'm sure it's hard to formulate a real concrete answer, but any information to guide me in the right direction would be much appreciated.\n\nA: This sounds like you need a virtualization solution:\nbecause of the safety and speed advantages of ubuntu i would recommend you to run virtual box on a ubuntu system. Alternatively VMWare.\nVirtualBox simulates a pc that does actually not exist, that runs in a seperate window. The setup in virtual box is the same as the setup on a hardware-computer. You have several options to split the system performance between vitual system and host-OS, Networking an passing through internet connections is also easily possible.\nFor further information see Virtual Box official webpage\nExcept for video ames with high system prequisites this should cover your needs. But keep in mind, that the performance will never be the same as in a dualboot system, because your machine has to run two OS at the same time.\n\nA: If you are doing any higher end gaming, I would simply install Virtualbox inside of Windows 7, then Ubuntu inside of that. Trust me, it will save you all kinds of pain if you play higher end games. For things like windows games/photoshop/office/autocad there are workarounds, but you already have windows 7, so why waste the time.\nI run Xubuntu as my primary OS with a VirtualBox XP installed in case I need it, but then again, I don't really game or use Photoshop.\n\nA: \"What is the best route for me to take so that I can install Ubuntu Linux, so that it's always running, while still allowing me to run Windows 7 simultaneously?\"\nAnother option maybe a full hd monitor with multiple ports.  The monitor i use has a vga and a dvi connectors on back; connecting two pc's to them allows me to use a button on the monitor to switch system being used. i.e. no rebooting to choose which os - just like what is asked in question.\nAnnoying having two sets of keyboard and mice lying about.. sure a Keyboard Video Mouse (KVM) switch would sort that out though!\n", "Q: Lost PATH variable content I was trying to add something to the PATH with : \nexport PATH=/user/home/sbt/bin\n\nbut I removed all of the content of PATH and I can not run any command on the terminal even ls !

The variable will be reset to its original state then.\nIf you're on a virtual terminal, and not running gnome-terminal or similar under X11, then you can log out and log back in again, to reset the variables. You can type exit to log out, or press Ctrl+D.\n\nA: In case, the answer by dobey doesn't work for you.\nFollow these steps to recover the PATH environment variable :\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the culprit file from /etc/profile.d/ (if any)\n\n*Delete the culprit line from /etc/profile or ~/.bashrc (if any)\n\n*Execute source /etc/environment to start reseting the path environment variable\n\n*Execute source /etc/profile followed by source /etc/profile.d/*\n\n*At last source ~/.bashrc\n\nA: For you case you could Use command: export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/user/home/sbt/bin\nthen use command sudo gedit /etc/environment  delete whatever it is in then copy and paste this \nPATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/user/home/sbt/bin\"\nfinally run a command source /etc/environment\nNow you should be fine\n", "Q: How can I uninstall Kdevelop from Ubuntu?

It can, however, conflict with your other custom keyboard shortcuts.\nTo deactivate the shortcut, edit your ~/.xbindkeysrc and comment out the shortcut so it looks like this: \n# set directly keycode (here control + f with my keyboard)\n#\"xterm\"\n#  c:41 + m:0x4\n\nNow, this setting will not be read until xbindkeys restarts, so run killall xbindkeys and then xbindkeys & if you want to restart it.

I'd like to re-purpose my previous laptop as a desktop (seeing as it has decent specs). The problem is that the hard drive is shot (failing) so installing Ubuntu on to that hard drive causes serious lag and overall crappy performance.\nDo you know of a way to install and run Ubuntu 12.10 (preferred) from an external hard-drive? I'd like for my 500GB (external) to be the primary drive.\n\nA: Should be possible if you can set up the drive to be the primary HDD in your bios.  I run 12.10 on my eee pc using an 8gb SD card as primary HDD because the SSD is too small.\n\nA: First you should unmount any other exteral drives connected to your laptop in order to avoid mishaps. Simply plug them out.\nNow that your external HDD is the only connected external drive you can start the installation from your LiveCD/USB. When you are asked for the preferred partition tabel configuration select the option to configure the partition table manually (\"advanced\" in newer verions \"something else\"). You can now change the device from your internal HDD (usually sda) to your external HDD sd\"something\" (easiest way to figure out what is what in this case ist to look for the capacity)\nNow you have to create a partition table for your external harddrive. here create a partition for /(root), a swap partition (in case your ram runs out of memory this partition will be used to extend the hardware-RAM, you can skip this if you have above 16GB, they will barely fill up), a /home partition (this is where your personal data will be saved) and VERY IMPORTANT the location of the bootloader.\nThe location of the bootloader HAS TO BE on the external drive as well. If you install in on the internal HDD GRUB (the bootloader) wont recognize the OS installed on the external drive. Messing this up takes quite a time to repair. So check carefully at this point.\nAfter that your Masterbootrecord is complete and you can proceed with the installation normally.\nAs mentioned, your bios boot priority finally has to be changed to look for the OS on the external drive first.\n\nA: On a mac, it is pretty much the same, but to boot from your external HDD at the end, reboot the mac, when it ding, press and hold option until you see you internal HDD, make sure your external HDD is connected and wait for your external HDD to be found, then select your external HDD. \nWarning: you need to have a USB mouse and keyboard, Apple bluetooth keyboard and mouse will not work once you boot ubuntu and may not work when selecting drives.\nFYI: this is tested using the iMac running Mac OS X Snow Leopard.\nI found out about this trick when I was trying to boot my ubuntu liveCD\n\nA: If it is a hard drive not soldered to the motherboard, you can always replace it. \nIf you want to just boot externally. Use this tutorial How to Dual Boot Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16 off an External Drive install grub2 to a USB, just skip the windows and live boot part.

I've search in the forums and tried every given solution. Please help.\nI have an ASUS G73JH with an ATI Mobility Radeon HD5870 Graphic Card. The GPU idle temperature is around 95°C, but after some time of use it rises over 100°C after some time of use (even using a fan base). It rises quicker when watching videos, achieving even 110°C. \nI've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fresh install of ubuntu 12.04, 12.10, even 13.04\n\n*Using default drivers, or property drivers (both fgrlx and fglrx-updates) (Catalyst 9.00, 9.01, 12.100)\n\n*Using every kernel since 3.5 to 3.8\n\n*Downgrading xorg xserver from 1.13. to 1.12 \n\n*Using the Jupiter power manager applet\n\n*Modifying the grub (Modifying this line: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash \" for this one GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash i915.i915_enable_rc6=1 i915.i915_enable_fbc=1 i915.lvds_downclock=1 pcie_aspm=force\")\n\n\nHowever, for sure i'm missing something. My father has the same machine working with temperatures around 82°C. He did change too many things that he doesn't remember which made it work. Does someone has the same machine or at least the same Graphic Card working perfectly?\n\nA: Couple of checks you need to do:\nEliminate Hardware Issues :\n- Using Windows and latest drivers, does your GPU shows normal temperatures.\n- Is the laptop fan and vents free of dirt and lint. If not, get it services or using a air blower clean them. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0BQ6YUFaoY)\n- Are you using proper thermal paste on the GPU. Arctic silver etc. are known good ones. Please get this done from a service center.\nUse the proper ATI drivers\n- At the ATI site, download the latest driver for your card and the architecture (64 bit / 32 bit) and check for temepratures.\n- Use the open source driver from the Ubuntu built in drivers.\nSwitch to low graphics mode\n- At Ubuntu login, use the Ubuntu 2D option (if available)\nGraphics intensive programs\n- Do not load any graphics intensive prorgrams - games etc. on this machine.\n- Reinstall compiz. (sudo apt-get --reinstall compiz)\nSwitch to other Distro\n- Debian is the best option. Very stable.\nLet us know.\nBest Regards,\nGurmeet Arora\n.\n\nA: It is solved now. I needed to clean the fans.

This has worked for others. Just remember to check the “Copy projects into workspace” when you import.\nAnother cause could be a wrong configuration in Eclipse. Go to\nPreferences --> Java --> Editor --> Content Assist --> Advanced. Here you have to make sure “Other Java Proposals” is ticked.\nIt could also very well be another applications using the same shortcut which are conflicting with Eclipse. There are no such applications installed by default on Ubuntu though, but it you are using apps such as GNOME-DO (which I believe uses Ctrl + Space) that might be your problem.\n", "Q: Restrict file search to ONE folder and it's subs When I go to Settings > Privacy > Files (tab)\nIt provides me with the option to provide a list of folders: \n\n\"Don't record activity in the following folders\"\n\nHowever, I'd like to be able to do the opposite:\n\n\"Record activity ONLY in the following folders\"\n\nIs this possible?\n\nA: Short answer: At the moment it is not possible. \nLong Answer: The logging engine supports only blacklists. When it tries to log event, it checks it against all the blacklists. If any of them is matched, the event is dropped\n\nWorkaround: You can blacklist all the top level folders in your Home Directory and just leave out the one which you want to be logged\n", "Q: Using linux/ubuntu to combat windows flash drive malware? I had asked this question on ITSecurity @ Stack Exchange also. There may not be may linux distro users in ITSec, but obviously there are many here. So, I think that it might be appropriate to put that question here also. Please tell me if you disagree.\nOriginal question at - https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/33017/using-linux-to-combat-windows-flash-drive-malware\nQuestion is -\nI just put an old flash drive which i used with a windows machine into my linux. I noticed many files, mostly exes which were never visible in windows (my windows does not hide hidden files and extensions). Most of those strange files had malware like names. I changed the properties of these files so that linux would allow me to delete them. It worked and now the drive seems to be fully clean.\nIf a windows malware in a flash drive can hide itself from windows, can it also hide itself from linux ? If not, then cleaning windows malware on a flash drive becomes easy.\nAre there any dangers/problems in this strategy ?\n\nA: I don't think that there are any dangers with this method.  The reason why malware cannot hide when on linux (Ubuntu) because Windows and linux are different.  Linux cannot run exe files without applications that allows it to run.  Most malware has an autorun type thing that allows to hide the files but since linux cannot read exe files at all the files are not hidden.\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: While saying exes won't autorun or autorun.inf won't get triggered on linux out of the box is true, saying this makes linux auto-mounting completely safe and all malware inert is not exactly the case.  \nSay, for example, any number of file format bugs is triggered when your file browser renders a \"preview\" or thumbnail.  You didn't have to actually execute anything, but if it successfully triggers, then you have execution in the context of the current user.  \nSafer, yes.  Immune, no.  That being said, I don't believe Linux targeted attacks of this type have been seen in the wild.\n", "Q: Windows installer does not boot on windows xp i have installed Windows installer wubi.exe but does not boot, how to dual-boot? how to initialize ubuntu, i did it on windows xp\n\nA: Try mounting the iso file in a usb disk in windows using rufus http://rufus.akeo.ie/ this will create a mountable usb disk. Restart your computer with usb stick plugged in, it will automatically take it to ubuntu installation.\n\nA: Are you saying you ran Wubi on Windows XP, followed all the steps in the setup, choose reboot at the end, and then your PC didn't boot into Ubuntu after that?\nIf so you might need to change the Boot settings. In Windows, Right-Click \"My Computer\", click Properties-->Advanced Tab-->Startup and Recovery-->Settings. From here you can change the default OS to Boot from and also add a Wait period for you to select an Alternative OS during boot.\n\nA: Adan's solution might work, but this answer is better. Reinstall. Something obviously went wrong so just add/remove programs uninstall Ubuntu and install again. Ubuntu in the Wubi install is treated like an App. If you just installed it and it failed use my answer. If you have data that you love on there then uses Adan's answer.\n", "Q: PyGTK TextBuffer adding Tags and reading text As in topic I have TextView() and TextBuffer() added to it, I also have Tags created so when I select text and click button it will make text BOLD or something. Up to this point all works well, now I need to be able to go through all text in TextView and find what Tag is applied and where, I need this so I can format text by adding stuff before and after tagged text.\nhere is part of the code:\n    self.textview = Gtk.TextView()\n    self.buffer = self.textview.get_buffer()\n    self.scrolledwindow.add(self.textview)\n    self.textview.show()\n\n    self.tag_bold = self.buffer.create_tag(\"bold\", weight=Pango.Weight.BOLD)\n\nIt would be best if I could get output like, \"test text\" is \"bold\".\nThanks for any help.\n\nA: EDIT Here's the correct function to use:\nGtk.TextIter.forward_to_tag_toggle() \nhere's an example that generates a list of all bolded words:\n    start = self.textbuffer.get_start_iter()\n    bolded=[]\n    while start.forward_to_tag_toggle(self.tag_bold):\n        begin=start.copy()\n        start.forward_to_tag_toggle(self.tag_bold)\n        bolded.append(self.textbuffer.get_text(begin,start,False))\n    print bolded\n\nWhile you are using pygi (not pyGTK; note the uppercase Gtk in your functions), many of the pyGTK functions are still valid though may require some tweaking. You can get documentation here for gtk.textiter in pygtk.\nOLD ANSWER:\nNot sure if this is the optimal way, but I found that you could iterate over each character (maybe each word if you want) and test whether the character has the tag you want:  Here's a simple function to do that:\n    start = self.textbuffer.get_start_iter()\n    plus = self.textbuffer.get_start_iter()\n    bolded=''\n    while plus.forward_char():\n        if start.has_tag(self.tag_bold):\n            bolded=bolded+(start.get_text(plus))\n        start.forward_char()\n    print bolded\n\nyou can also use the Gtk.TextIter get_tags() method to get what tags a character has.\nFinally, what may work better is to store the bounds in some list when you apply the tags to begin with.\n", "Q: How can I install Ubuntu on my MacBook Pro without EFI interference?

Is it possible to cleanly install ubuntu without the irritating EFI mac 'shell' surrounding the install, making the mac boot sound and generally slowing boot up time by 15-25 seconds?\n\nA: To Avoid long EFI wait before GRUB\nIf your Macbook spends 30 seconds with \"white screen\" before GRUB shows, try booting from your Mac OS X install disc, select language, then click Utilities- Terminal, and enter:\nbless --device /dev/disk0s1 --setBoot --legacy\nAssuming that the bootloader is on sda1, otherwise /dev/disk0s2 if it's on sda2, etc.\nCredit for answer to Alaukik in this post.\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu but under virtualization platform live VMware or VirtualBox this is the easy way for try Ubuntu. \nBut, if you want to going to install Ubuntu as a whole system I think you have to disable EFI interference like installing Ubuntu with Windows 8 installed. \n", "Q: Debian Package Creation- how to define environment variables within the package I built a package with the sudo-ldap package defined as a dependency in the control file (please see below).  I'm going to have people install using the gdebi command to install which should install the package and any required dependencies.  Unfortunately, this will require the export SUDO_FORCE_REMOVE=yes variables to be set or the sudo-ldap package will not be installed and will error out the entire package install.  How do I define an environment variable for the whole package creation.  My ultimate goal is to have a user install this package without having to manually define environment variables...I know I can call this package with a script, but I'd rather not do that.  \n\nDepends: ${misc:Depends} ldap-utils,sudo-ldap\n\nThanks so much in advance.\n\nA: Best I can suggest is two debs. The first one lobotomises sudo's prerm script. The second one depends on sudo-ldap. This approach wouldn't work with APT (installing both in one run) because there's no guarantee that the lobotomisation package would be installed first. However, if driven through gdebi, it should work.\nDo you actually need sudo-ldap? Normal sudo works with LDAP, it just doesn't get the sudoers configuration from LDAP...\n", "Q: How do I set up a logging server for Access Points? I have a linksys AP, nothing fancy, but it does have a logging utility. \nHow do I make that send the logs my Ubuntu 12.04 server. \n\n\nA: All you have to do is enable log reception via UDP.\nIn a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) run sudo gedit /etc/rsyslog.conf, find the following lines:\n# provides UDP syslog reception\n#$ModLoad imudp\n#$UDPServerRun 514\n\nand uncomment (remove the leading #) the last 2 lines, so they look like this:\n# provides UDP syslog reception\n$ModLoad imudp\n$UDPServerRun 514\n\nSave, close the file then restart rsyslog by running sudo service rsyslog restart.\nNow you can enable syslog at the AP and point it to your computer IP address.

I've been using 12.04 for a few months now, but today I began thinking about re-installing Ubuntu, and now I'm a bit confused.\nWhat should I Choose?\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04 or 12.10\n\n*32 bit or 64 bit\n\n\nI want to get maximum output from the resources available on my laptop:\n\n\n*\n\n*core i3\n\n*4Gb RAM\n\n*640GB HDD\n\n\nMy main priority is speed! Using an LTS isn't too important, as I usually change my OS every few months.\n\nA: Since you have an Intel i3 CPU and 4GB RAM I recommend going with a 64bit version of Ubuntu in order to use that RAM well(I haven't been impressed by 32bit PAE on my system running 4gb of RAM).\nAs for the version of Ubuntu you should use, I recommend 12.04. It has a longer support window and is far more stable. Only get 12.10 if you really want the latest features and don't care about a far shorter support window. Also 13.04 will be out next month so you might as well wait if you want the latest version of Ubuntu.\n\nA: I would still go for 12.04 as it uses less resourses if the main thing is speed.  If the latest and greatest is important for you then go for 12.10 which does use more resources from 12.04.\n\nA: depends on what you need to do with your computer. if you wanna speed, they are both fast, i beleive 12.04 is little faster. than if you wanna use it as windows (for fun and that kind of stuffs) use 12.10, but if you want it for training, working with codes, with system tweaking in generaly use 12.04. than, 32 or 64bit, it depends on your computer, i beleive you need 64 as specification tells me that is not old computer, and that new usually have 64bit complability.\n\nA: x64 isn't strictly necessary if you don't have more than 4GB of memory. There are still decent reasons not to use it (legacy compatibility, memory usage).\nI don't find 12.10 to be much more stable or full-featured than 12.04. 13.04 is a bit better in that department; I'd wait for that and then just keep on the upgrade pipeline from there. 12.04 LTS is a very good release if you care at all about LTS, though.\n\nA: as you mentioned, you have good resources in your hardware so you can install x64.\nbut about 12.04 or 12.10, you can find out the deference between 12.04.xx and 12.10 here\ni suggest to install 12.04 because of it's LTS. but if you decide to install 12.10, it is better to wait some days for coming 13.04.\n\nA: I think you're a little bit like me, always want to try the newest software. I understand you quite well. But which version you should choose depends on your purpose. If you are a serious Linux user for working or programming purpose, I think 12.04 LTS is better. Its features are definitely enough for learning and working, and it's LTS. But if you merely use it for fun and entertainment, then I would suggest you follow your heart, install 12.10 and 13.04 about one month later.  \nAs with 32bit or 64bit issue, I think it's similar to LTS vs newest. Your memory is no more than 4GB, so 32bit doesn't put a significant contrain on it. Generally speaking, the most important reason people should choose 64bit is the memory is over 4GB. 64bit is not faster on everything, it's task-specific.  In fact, many programmes running on a 64bit computer is infact 32bit, such as Firefox. In windows 7, both 32bit and 64 bit IE are provided by Microsoft, but what's in the taskbar as the default one is the 32bit version. Considering the possible compatiblity issue, 32bit is more robust and sometimes maybe preferred for serious work. But again, I think 64bit may be better for you. \n", "Q: Kubuntu 12.04 screen capture (KSnapshot, etc.) broken by update I'm running Kubuntu 12.04 with an AMD/ATI graphics card (and multiple monitors). After a system update about a month or two ago KSnapshot stopped working for me. All it does is capture the stock KDE desktop background (even though that isn't what I see on the screen). I cannot actually capture any application windows or any type of useful content. The screen capture feature of Gimp exhibits the same error.\nThe appearance of this error coincides with a Kubuntu system update (approx a month or so ago) that changed the lockscreen behavior. It appears to be a security related change. I don't know the details (or even where to find the details) of the update. But the first update was buggy and it was follow closely by another one. Both affected the lockscreen. The first update broke KSnapshot -- and monitor power management when the desktop is locked. The follow up fixed the monitor power management issue, but it did not fix the ability to capture a screen shot. \nThe end result for me appears to be a more secure lock screen but broken KSnapshot.\nI have been waiting patiently, but I think now is the time to be proactive after waiting more than a month.

In reading about Ubuntu Touch and Ubuntu for Android, I have noticed references to \"bionic\" and \"libhybris\" that are made fairly often.\nI assume that libhybris is a library because of the \"lib\" prefix, but that's about all I know.\nWhat are bionic and libhybris, and what do they do?\nEdit: @maggotbrain asked if I could link to some of the sources where I found mention of bionic/libhybris.  Here is a comment on Hacker News, and here is another.  Those are the only ones that I could find, what really got me wondering was when someone mentioned it at an Ubuntu LoCo meeting.\n\nA: Bionic, according to wikipedia:\n\nThe Bionic libc is a derivation of the BSD standard C library code that was originally developed by Google for the Android embedded operating system\n\nIf you are wondering what the C standard library is, it's a library that all applications written in C use. It contains input and output functions (e.g. printing to a terminal, writing/reading a file, etc...), memory functions (allocating/freeing), etc... Note that the C standard library is actually just a specification for a library (same as OpenGL, and some others), it's not actually a library that you can download and use. This is why there are implementations such as the BSD's (I'll call it the BSD libc, for convenience), GNU's (which, by the way, is included by default in ubuntu, under the name of libc), or, in this case, Bionic. But as wikipedia said, Bionic is based off of the BSD libc, so it's not an original implementation. Now about the actual implementation, I'm not sure what's the difference between Bionic and the BSD libc, but I would think it has something to do with compatability of their devices, or something along the likes of that (since one of the reasons why the C standard library is just a specification is that how the functions work differ from OS to OS).\nlibhybris is an extension, if you want, to bionic that acts like libdl (source: http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTE5Mjk). If you're wondering what libdl is, it's a library that allows applications to dynamically load other libraries into their applications. This is extremely useful (if not impossible to do without) for plugins and such.\nHope this clarifies!\n", "Q: How do I install ia32 libs, the multi-arch packages?

GOP structure also affects the distortion sensitivity of the video stream due to packet losses. \nIncreasing the GOP length, also increases the video quality. But after reaching the highest PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio), it starts to decrease. In the first increasing period, the efficient coding plays major role, so higher of GOP lengths lead to a better quality. After the optimal of GOP settings, when the video quality is the highest, the error propagation effect becomes more significant. Hence, using higher Intra frame (I-frame or Key frame) intervals, the error will be spreading because of significant distortion.Source\nEach type of video has different optimal GOP, depend on its characteristic.\n\nKey Frame and Animation:\nVideos or moving images - we're just tricking our minds; they're just still images displayed at a rapid succession! And the illusion gets better and smoother if the next frame appears at/before 1/25th of a second which is the Human eye afterimage persistance time interval and the reason for motion perception.\nIllustration 1: (source: Wikipedia)\n\nFig: A sequence of video frames, consisting of two keyframes (I), one forward-predicted frame (P) and one bi-directionally predicted frame (B).\n(You may note that, in the above image the value of GOP, -g is 3, one key-frame with two supplimentary frames.)\nIllustration 2: (source: Wikipedia)\n\nFig: A very simple animation created by key-framing. The animation lacks smoothness because each frame is completely independent of any other frame.\n\nA possible Q&A:\n\nQ. Aren't key frames enough? Why would we need to have the supplimentary/intermediate P-frames, B-frames?\nA. Yes... but the use of such intermediate frames allow to reduce the overall size of the file (video).\n\nFor better quality video/streaming, you'd look to use low compression ratio but high frame rate which means high -g value with avconv (optimum GOP value is nearly half the value of frames/sec). As evident, the value for -g will have to be specified based on the coders, compression ratio, frame rates that you're using for the transcoding/streaming purpose; it's a relative quantity so there's no general value you can use with all inputs.\nAccording to this link the value of GOP for most media would be about half the value of frame rate so that the key frame would be about 0.5 seconds apart and would produce a good quality video. We may also note that other link shows the PSNR attains a constant value at around half the test frame rate as indicated in the graph plot.\n\nBut the optimal value seems to lie around 1/6th to 1/4th the test frame rate.\nAnd yeah, so you should be looking to use -g value around or in the range 1/6th to 1/4th so that the key frames appear every 0.17 to 0.25 seconds; and probably comment to improve the answer :)\n\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Group of pictures\n\n*Video compression picture types\n\n*GOP Length\nEffect\nAnalysis on H.264/AVC\nVideo\nStreaming\nTransmission Quality\nover LTE Network\n\nA: You have several examples of usage on the official avconv documentation. \nFrom Section Tips: \navconv -g 3 -r 3 -t 10 -b 50k -s qcif -f rv10 /tmp/b.rm\n\n\nIf your computer is not fast enough, you can speed up the compression at the expense of the compression ratio. You can use ’-me zero’ to speed up motion estimation, and ’-g 0’ to disable motion estimation completely (you have only I-frames, which means it is about as good as JPEG compression).\n\n", "Q: setup media server on Ubuntu VPS I have get a VPS running Ubuntu 12.04.

I have this as the last line in my .profile:\nalias gl=\"cd /home/jrenner/glances/glances\"\n\nyet even after reboot I get command not found when typing gl. What is happening? I am logged in as the correct user.\n\nA: I'm pretty sure that lpanebr's idea will work, but here's a more elegant solution. Do that alias command in .bashrc   That's how I do it, or some people prefer to add a file dedicated to alias.  Call it .alias or whatever and add .alias to your .bashrc\nWish I could do formatting like @lpanelbr. I wonder if there is a wiki?\n\nA: The right way to do this in Ubuntu is to add your alias to ~/.bash_aliases. Create the file if it doesn't exist.\nThis file (if present) is called from the default ~/.bashrc, and the alias will be available in your terminal emulators too.\n\nA: There are two related reasons why aliases don't always work when put in the .profile file.  The first is that the .profile (or .bash_profile) file is only run for a login shell.  If you are starting bash in a terminal window under X, your terminal emulator (e.g. gnome-termanl) probably isn't running bash as a login shell. [Most have an option to change this if you want but the default (for gnome-termal anyway) is not to run it as a login shell.]\nThe shell will be an interactive shell and so .bashrc will be run.  \nHowever, normally bash has been run as a login shell back when the X session was being started.  So if there are alias commands in .profile they will have been executed along with setting environment variables like the PATH etc. When a terminal window is opened a new instance of bash is run to prompt for, and execute commands in that terminal window.  Unlike environment variables, aliases can not be exported from one instance of bash to a new one started by it.  So the aliases are not passed on to the new shell.\nTo see this, try this experiment:\nexport ROBERT=bob\nalias james=jimmy\necho $ROBERT\nalias james\nbash               #start a new bash instance\necho $ROBERT\nalias james\nexit               #end the new bash instance and revert to the original one\necho $ROBERT\nalias james\n\nNote that .bashrc is not run by bash when it is started as a login shell.  So putting your aliases there won't always work unless your .bashrc is sourced from your .profile, which is a very common practice.\n\nA: If you are using bash (echo $SHELL) as a shell interpreter I think it is best (or maybe the only way) if you define your own CD function.\nEdit your .bashrc file and add the following at the end:\n# my custom functions:\nfunction gl () {\n   cd /home/jrenner/glances/glances/\n}\n\nYou could also extend it like so:\n# my custom functions:\nfunction cdw () {\n   cd /home/jrenner/glances/glances/$1\n   ls\n}\n\nand change directly to a sub directory and list it's contents.\n\nA: $ bash #start a new bash instance\n\nThis was problem with my server.

Good to go.\nP.S. This other question had some important background information that helped me. I did the kernel re-install bit from there, but it didn't work as that was not the problem.\n\nA: First see which hard drive your computer boots to first and switch it. (They should be identical including mbr if I'm not mistaken.) Try this even if you have both of them as boot options since it sounds like one is starting to boot before the troubles start.\nIt's likely that your drives are out-of-sync. If you don't have bios-level raid management I recommend disconnecting one and boot up. Check the system thoroughly since which ever drive you \"keep\" is going to define what data & software you'll have when this is over. If it still won't boot try switching them. Once you have a working drive add the other as a new drive and let the system copy everything.\nIf you do have bios-level raid management I recommend disabling in software rather than hardware but doing otherwise the same as above.\n\nA: If u have an windows system try downloading rufus http://rufus.akeo.ie/ and mount the server iso in your usb stick and reinstall your server\n", "Q: Ubuntu server 12.10 dhcp configuration When installing Ubuntu server12.10 I am not connected to internet and while installing I chose manually configure network.

I have 3 partitions. One for Windows 7, one for Ubuntu and one for my files. So, how do I go about un-installing ubuntu? I did not install it using Wubi.\n\nA: I went through this myself and it was very harrowing to find all the information. It took me almost three hours of continuous testing to finally get it done. It was in February this year. But now I am quite used to it. \nThis is how I went about in Windows XP and it should work the same in Windows 7 too but I am not sure.\nThese are the steps for uninstalling any Linux distribution from your computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an Ubuntu USB using Unetbootin or Linux Live USB Creator( as it is required in a subsequent step).\n\n*Go to windows 7 and in command prompt type diskmgmt.msc you will see the partition manager. In there, delete the partition that you created for Linux. \n\n*Now reboot your machine, You will see the GRUB rescue prompt saying no partition found. Don't panic, this is normal. As we have removed the linux partition but did not fix the MBR.\n\n*Reboot from your USB. I hope you know how to change your BIOS settings so as to boot from a USB. In case you don't, it should be easy to find on the internet as the exact. I cannot tell you the exact steps as the options depend on your motherboard.\n\n*Once you have booted from the USB, select try Ubuntu and wait for the OS to load.\n\n*Make sure you are connected to the internet and now run a terminal.\n\n*You need root access, so type:\nsudo passwd root\ntype in the password you want\nnow type:\nsu -\nand type in the password at the prompt\nnow use the following command:\napt-get install lilo\nand once the installation is complete and the prompt returns then type in:\nlilo -M /dev/sda mbr\nOnce done you will get the message in the terminal something like:\nYour Master Boot Record has been fixed\nOnce you see this, reboot and you should be able to boot into Windows XP directly.\nI don't know if the instructions for Windows 7 are exactly same but hopefully other forum members can help you with the specifics but these are the critical steps. Make sure you have a Ubuntu USB handy as without this I don't think you can fix the MBR.\nI have done this a couple of times on my Windows XP machine and it works perfectly fine.\nAlternatively if you have a Windows 7 DVD, or rescue disk, you can use that to restore the original Windows 7 MBR. The steps about will reinstall lilo instead of restoring the original bootloader.\n\nA: boot in your windows and open application that is for that stuffs like disk utility in ubuntu (dont know what is name for that in windows) and simply empty that partition, or delete that partition at all if you not need it anymore.\n\nA: its simple, just boot using your bootable usb or any other bootable device\nafter that delete the partition containing ubuntu..\nthen start windows7 -> right click my computer -> manage -> disk management --- then u will see unused space --> create a new Drive..\nHope that solves ur problem ..\n", "Q: config problems in sendmail I am in the last step of the send mail config, due to some issues the send mail in /usr/sbin/ is not getting accessed even though i gave permissions.

I wanted to try restoring it in by using terminal but I cant launch the terminal since there are files in /bin related to terminal that have been deleted (my guess).\nAre there any ways to restore /bin directory?  I'm looking into upgrading ubuntu. \n\nA: /bin contains some of the most basic files on your system, and it won't be able to do much without it (booting will not work, same for installing packages). Your best bet is to boot a live cd of the same Ubuntu version as what you are using, mount your exisitng root partition and rsync its /bin over to that partition.\nFor a full cleanup afterwards, reinstall the affected packages. To find which packages to reinstall, use this command:\nfind /bin -type f | xargs dpkg -S | sed -e 's/:.*//' | sort -u\n\nAnd to actually reinstall them:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall $(find /bin -type f | xargs dpkg -S | sed -e 's/:.*//' | sort -u)\n\n\nA: In general, every file or folder can be restored, only if you have backup of that practicular file or folder, be carefull when working in terminal, some processes are not recoverable!!! When you write / at first place, no matter where ever you are now, its gonna search for root!!! ./ stands for the current directory, and ../ for the parent (one level up) directory. I am not gonna suggest you to use any bin directory copy beacause i am not sure it could help, but I can tell you to install ubuntu on a new partition, backup your files in that way, if you are not familiar with terminal.\n", "Q: problem regarding packages installation in ubuntu I am new to ubuntu and cant find a solution to my simple question \"do the new installation affects the installation of previously installed packages?\". Can anybody solve my query or suggest me a suitable manual to clear my doubts. Please solve my query.\n\nA: From what I can see, you are using the OpenCV Computervision libary.\nIt should behave nicely with other packages.\nThe Ubuntu packaging system will complain if a new package would conflict with an already installed one (provided both were installed as packages).\nI looked it up (you can do that using a package manager like synaptic) and libopencv-core does not conflict with anything. So as long as you try it with the package manager/software center, you should be fine.\nHope this helps, \nPatrick\n\nA: when you installing ubuntu, in generally like any other OS, is gonna ask you befor installation start, for your choice, do you want to install and delete everything that you had, do you want to keep that and install ubuntu on new partition. so now choice is yours. ;)\n", "Q: No more Unity after AMD Graphics Driver I seem to have a problem.

To ask them to update their package, report a bug: in launchpad.net for Ubuntu, or http://www.debian.org/Bugs/ for debian.\nSo now, question #2: will update in Debian result in update in Ubuntu ? Well, it depends on when it happens. On each release cycle, Ubuntu is synced with Debian. This is done until a date known as https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebianImportFreeze.

I followed Jorge Castro thread here\nand its working without a problem! on 12.04-2 x64 bit. However I have a question: \nIf there is an old/newer version client of ubuntu. How does it fetch cached updates? \n\nA: The proxy works by caching the files themselves, so if you have an older version of Ubuntu and a newer version, most likely they will not share the same files. \nSo if you have 12.04 and 12.10, the cache will keep the files for each distro and will not share the .debs (except in the rare cases where a .deb goes from one release to the next without being changed). Usually if you have more than one of each version at a location that doesn't really matter as having a cache will still be better than none at all, but if you have an office with say one 10.04, one 12.04, one Debian, and one 13.04, then it'll keep a set of packages for each of those. \nThough having cache misses for those can seem bad, it is nice when you have to upgrade an older machine and your proxy already has the files for the next version ready to go. \nAlso of note, the architecture matters, so if you have 64 bit 12.04 and 32 bit 12.04 the only .debs cached that will be applicable to both will be packages with data and documentation which are not architecture specific will be cached.\n", "Q: How can I install Windows 8 while dual-booting Ubuntu? I have a new Dell laptop which has inbuilt Ubuntu OS in it, I would like to install Windows 8 alongside Ubuntu, that is, without removing Ubuntu.\n\nA: Without any problem run Windows 8 installation, and when you are asked for drive to what you want to install it, simply create new partition, give some value for it and select new created partition to install on. If this not work, boot in Ubuntu, click dash home from launcher and type in search box: disk utility.

Sorry for the long question.\nWith the coming of Steam for Linux I may have been over optimistic and got rid of windows installation.\nThe problem is that I have about 100 Steam games that are not (and may never be) ported to Linux. Anyway I got tired of dual boot, and Wine solutions (wineprefix and playonlinux) don't always work.\nSo I was wondering if there is any solution to use a virtual machine (or something similar) with direct access to hardware spec in order to run windows games in it.\n(something like what Parallels do on mac).\nRe-installing windows is not a huge problem but I was hoping to avoid it as I would like use Ubuntu as my everyday OS together with more \"difficult\" distros..to learn more about Linux.\nEdit: Thanks for all your answers: I'll think about the solution you proposed.\nHonestly to this day I never heard of Xen, so I'll have to read about it...and maybe buy a new graphic card...and a new monitor.\nI think I'll end up re-installing windows on one of my drives...It's a pity though.\nthanks again.\n\nA: If both your hardware and your software support IOMMU (a.k.a. PCI passthrough, AMD-Vi and Intel VT-d), you can assign assign I/O devices (e.g., the graphics card) to VMs.\nOn the current versions of Ubuntu, you can use Xen, as long as both your motherboard and your CPU support IOMMU.\nI'm currently using a Windows 7 VM with two AMD 7950 GPUs, and it works very well for gaming and Bitcoin/Litecoin mining.\nTutorials, etc.:\n\n\n*\n\n*Detailed guide about Xen VGA pass-through\n\n*Full tutorial for building a gaming VM (uses Fedora, not Ubuntu)\n\n*Installing Xen on Ubuntu\n\n*Success story on Super User\n\n*Xen VGA Passthrough Tested Adapters\nNote that you can use the GPU on in that VM is you pass it through.\n\nA: Your windows VM mostly runs on emulated hardware. That hardware is usually relative simple.\nHaving said that:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is possible to emulate 3D functions. Performance is usually sub par, and sometimes it does not work as expected. (E.g. running Baldur's Gate 1 with 3D acceleration enabled in Vmware workstation 8 crashes my whole host. Not just the VM). This will improve over time for all VMs.  In fact, vmware workstation 9 claims significant improvements, but I have not tested that version yet. I know 5.5 and 8 did not suffice.\n\n*Instead of emulating you can directly access hardware from a VM. The keyword is is PCI[e] passthough. This is a feature usually used to pass though special cards, 10 Gbit NICs etc, but it should also work for graphics cards.. Note that will use a card only for the VM. With graphics cards this means using a second graphics card for the VM. \n\n\nA: The short answer is: No.\nThe longer answer is: Not yet...\nVBox's 3D support barely counts. It does provide 3D support but absolutely no performance. VMWare seems to perform a lot better (note the benchmark is on a  Mac) and that might be playable. The downside here is a large pile of cash (I'm not sure what 3D support is like in their free offerings).\nBut if you want to take full advantage of your hardware for Windows-only games, there's only one solution and that's to boot into Windows. I'm afraid to say that's likely always going to be the case for that subset of games.\nThe only other near-acceptable solutions available:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fight Wine (when it does work, it tends to work really well)\n\n*Buy a console.\n\n*Lobby the developer for a port.\n\n\nThere are all sorts of server technologies that may filter through in time:\n\n\n*\n\n*Nvidia+Vmware are working on a multi-head virtualised gaming platform but I honestly don't expect this level of integration to be in consumers' hands for another decade, if not longer. Graphics manufacturers want us to buy dozens and dozens of cards and virtualising hurts that aim.\n\n*You could reverse it and have a Windows Server host VM and paravirt a Ubuntu desktop, with shared 3D but again, I'm not sure what the performance would be like. And it's a ton of cash to do legally. The desktop-host isn't as good at all.\n\n*Xen won't paravirt a Windows install, so there's no point looking there yet. It does have PCI and VGA passthrough modules but they're locked to one VM so you'd have to have a graphics card for each install. Urgh.\n\nNote I'm really only talking about 3D graphics here because the rest are solved or nearly-solved problems. CPU virtualisation is mature with paravirtualisation and CPU extensions like Intel VT-x and AMD-V. Peripheral passthrough is fairly low bandwidth so is simple to share.\nGraphics are lagging because sharing them in the way we're talking about is not a commercial necessity for manufacturers. It does seems to be going that way though (for high-end render farms and server-based workstation consolidation) so watch that space.\n\nA: Have you tried Virtual Box ? By reading feature list it looks like that it has what you need ... access to GPU and CPU.\n", "Q: How to install Kubuntu on other hard disk I would like to install Kubuntu 12.10 on my computer.

Probably only minimal special guidance is needed in this situation.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the external drive that you want to install Ubuntu Server on is attached. If your computer has trouble booting from other installation media when it is, then you can defer this step to immediately after the system starts to boot from the installation media in step 2.\n\n*Boot the server install CD/DVD/USB. (If this is a live USB, then of course it must be a different drive from the USB drive you're installing on.)\n\n*Select the external drive to install to.\n\n*As part of the installation, you are asked to specify where the GRUB boot loader should be installed. Make sure it is at least installed to the master boot record of the external drive itself. You will probably not want to install it anywhere else.\nIn particular, please note that if the newly installed server system's GRUB is installed to the MBR of an internal hard drive, then whether or not any other Ubuntu system is installed on the machine, no system will be able to boot when the flash drive is not attached. You don't want that. (You can fix it by reinstalling your OS's boot loader to the MBR of the internal drive, but it's best simply to avoid it altogether.)\n\n*To boot the new system, you must select the drive it's on as the boot device.\nThis server system may or may not be highly portable, depending on how much you configure it to be dependent on other features of the machine on which it is installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*You should make sure the swap partition (and as discussed above, the boot loader) is also on the USB flash drive!\n\n*By default, drives in /etc/fstab will be listed using their UUID's (which can be viewed by running sudo blkid). If you keep it that way when adding any new entries or modifying existing ones, your system will be much more portable, because it will be much more resilient to changes in the way devices are numbered, which often happens when hardware is substantially changed.\n\n*If you install the 64-bit version, it will use large amounts of RAM more efficiently, and for high-performance server needs, this is typically recommended. However, the 64-bit version of Ubuntu (server or otherwise) will not run at all on a machine with a 32-bit processor.\n\n\nFinally, you may want to consider alternatives to attempting to create a portable server system. For example, you might be better off installing Ubuntu Server to a virtual machine. This is automatically portable. One of the disadvantages of running Ubuntu Server from flash storage is that, if you have a very large amount of writes (which occurs in many though not all server applications), the USB flash drive will wear out muc faster than a traditional magnetic hard drive (and I believe also faster than an SSD).\n\nA: I recently did just that. You either need to install from a separate USB drive or CD and just select the USB drive you wish to install to as the drive to install to when creating partitions.\nThe easiest way I found was using UNetBootin to install the netinstall version of Ubuntu 12.04 which turned out to be very easy and quicker to start than downloading the whole distro.

In Synaptic it's possible to select a bunch of packages for installation (or reinstallation), then just click File → Generate package download script to get a set of commands to download the corresponding deb files.

If this were a local server, I think I could start the server from the console and make the necessary configuration changes.  Being hosted, I don't have access to the console - or so I believe, so I'm stuck with a server I can no longer access.\nTo start, I'm using apt-get upgrade (as I'm ultimately trying to upgrade from Lucid to Precise).  This then identifies the Grub update..\nThere are two separate prompts which I'm unsure how to properly proceed:\n1) Grub configuration\nThe update asks what I want to do with the config file (/etc/default/grub?).\nShould I\n\n\n*\n\n*Keep my existing\n\n*Replace with package\n\n*Merge existing with package\n\n*Other\n\n\n2) Installation location\nA second prompt is to install the boot loader.  The guide suggests that if I don't know, I should install it to all locations.\n/boot is located on /dev/sda1\n/dev/sda3 contains everything else (eg /)\nIs /boot the only place it needs to be located, or do I need to identify something in /boot/grub/grub.cfg to identify where it should be installed?\n\nA: 1. Grub configuration:\nFirst of all, make a backup of /etc/default/grub file. This file is used to generate /boot/grub/grub.cfg with update-grub command. Feel free to keep existing, but i'd reccomend you to merge with package and compare merged with a backup copy. Do not replace with package. The system can be unbootable. /boot/grub/grub.cfg file will be regenerated at the end of update process. So, inspect the final version of /etc/default/grub, modify it if needed, run update-grub command if modified.\n2. Installation location:\n/boot is the only one location GRUB2 places it's files, but it also embed some code into MBR/boot partition. So, if /boot located on a separate partition and this partition is marked as bootable - choose /boot. If another partition is marked as bootable (/ for example - choose all locations).\nOn UEFI systems GRUB2 places additional files on /boot/efi.\n", "Q: How can I make squid-deb-proxy work with proxy authentication? I have squid-deb-proxy working fine without a problem without apt proxy authentication. \nHowever when I add a proxy file to /etc/apt/apt.conf.d and put in my proxy authentication inside this file.

Do X-Server/X-Org come with the kernel itself or are they separate packages that are installed in distributions?

It is a separate suite of libraries and applications, and can be built and run on not only the Linux kernel, but also runs on BSD, Darwin, Windows, and other platforms as well.\n", "Q: How can the username be removed from the lock screen? When the lock screen is active (it can e.g. be activated with Ctrl+Alt+L) the username is shown. How can I remove the username from the lock screen? I want the lock screen to simply not display the username.\n\nA: In short, you can't do that; but you can workaround it depending on your needs. \ngnome-screen-saver displays your user name; that is, your full name, not your account name.\nYou can change your user name, but you have to think about the ramifications. If your main concern is not having your name visible in public, set your user name to your first name only, a fake first name, or just to me. But remember that this user name will be used in the drop-down list from the power button and wherever else a program retrieves the user name. \nOn a single user laptop, this is probably not going to cause any trouble. But on a shared computer, you need to know who is logged in when you look at the screen, so you would at least need something liker User 1, User 2.\nUser Accounts will accept and display an invalid string but I imagine it sets your user name to null in /etc/passwd since the drop-down list of users shows a blank line. This breaks the user list and you will not be able to lock, log out, or restart from the GUI. (Think about it, the system is trying to authenticate these actions for...who?, plus I experimented a little.) \nOn top of that, the lock screen will default to your account name, which is really defeating what I imagine is your purpose. So no null string, a string of spaces, a string not starting with a-z, a string more than 31 chars, or a string less than 2 chars. (This last seems to be a Gnome/Ubuntu add-on to the Linux requirement of at least 1 char.)\n", "Q: Ubuntu taking very long time to boot So I've insalled Ubuntu 12.10 from a usb stick alongside with Windows. When I boot Ubuntu, it spends about 10 minutes in a purple screen, no cursor, no nothing, then it goes to a black screen but with a cursor, and lastly the login screen, which stays frozen for like 10 minutes. After I login, the screen stays frozen on an empty wallpaper for 10 minutes aswell. Finally after Ubuntu boots, everything runs ultra slowly. Firefox takes a few minutes to launch and freezes every like 10 seconds.\nIve got an Intel Pentium 2.93 Ghz dual core processor, 4 Gigs of ram, Geforce GTS250. \n\nA: The first step in diagnosing a slow boot is to look at the output of dmesg. dmesg displays the contents of the kernel ring buffer, which contains status messages logged by the kernel more or less from the moment control is passed to the Linux kernel to the point that your syslog daemon takes over those logging duties.\nTo get the output of dmesg in a file for easy browsing, do dmesg > dmesg.txt. Now dmesg.txt in your current directory contains the kernel log.\nReading dmesg: Every line of dmesg output starts with a sequence like [    0.106607]. This is a timestamp in \"T-plus\" format: it is the number of seconds since the instant the kernel started.\nTo identify your slowdown, look for a point where the timestamp \"jumps\" a great deal from one line to the next (hint: you can also use dmesg -d to get dmesg to print the time difference from one timestamp to the next in angle brackets after the timestamp):\n[    3.201806] usb 2-4: >New USB device strings: Mfr=2, Product=3, SerialNumber=4\n[    3.201810] usb 2-4: >Product: Android\n[    3.201813] usb 2-4: >Manufacturer: Android\n[    3.201816] usb 2-4: >SerialNumber: 00093f054d0a2f\n[   43.254818] EXT4-fs (sda5): orphan cleanup on readonly fs\n[   43.254827] EXT4-fs (sda5): ext4_orphan_cleanup: deleting unreferenced inode 10747985\n[   43.254879] EXT4-fs (sda5): ext4_orphan_cleanup: deleting unreferenced inode 10748275\n[   43.254892] EXT4-fs (sda5): ext4_orphan_cleanup: deleting unreferenced inode 10748394\n\nHere we see a jump from T+3 seconds to T+43 seconds, meaning that for 40 seconds the kernel was logging nothing, and presumably twiddling its thumbs waiting for something to happen. This is right after it's recognized an Android device plugged in, so for starters, we might want to try having that Android device unplugged during boot. That could be a red herring, though -- the delay might be incurred by the filesystem cleanup that is happening next.\nThis is followed shortly by:\n[   43.254959] EXT4-fs (sda5): ext4_orphan_cleanup: deleting unreferenced inode 10748175\n[   43.254969] EXT4-fs (sda5): 8 orphan inodes deleted\n[   43.254970] EXT4-fs (sda5): recovery complete\n[   52.161162] EXT4-fs (sda5): mounted filesystem with ordered data mode.

We notice that the last thing that happens prior to the delay is the filesystem being mounted.\nA little research (doing a Google search for 'slow boot dmesg \"mounted filesystem with ordered data mode\"') yields a promising lead: an unfixed bug pertaining to udev that refers to a long wait at boot right after this message!\nBrowsing that thread, it looks like a workaround has been established:\n\nIt consists in adding a --noudevsync parameter to the vgchange command in /lib/udev/rules.d/85-lvm2.rules. Then regenerating the initramfs with update-initramfs -u\n\nSo we'll do something like this:\nsudo nano /lib/udev/rules.d/85-lvm2.rules\nFind the excerpt that looks like /sbin/lvm vgchange -a y and change it to read /sbin/lvm vgchange --noudevsync -a y. It may be necessary to append the same option to the /sbin/lvm vgscan call.\nNow do sudo update-initramfs -u and reboot when it is successful.\n", "Q: Installing ClamAV and ClamTk My computer experience dates from 1961 but I am an Ubuntu/Linux rookie.

Most of the software you will ever used is stored in repositories (commonly shortened to \"repos\").\nA quote from the Ubuntu wiki on what repos are:\n\nThere are literally thousands of Ubuntu programs available to meet the needs of Ubuntu users. Many of these programs are stored in software archives commonly referred to as repositories. Repositories make it very easy to install new software onto Ubuntu using an Internet connection, while also providing a high level of security, as each program available in the repositories is thoroughly tested and built specifically for each version of Ubuntu.\n\nRepositories are like libraries of software. Ubuntu has a file called sources.list located in /etc/apt that contains a list of all the repositories that you have enabled on your computer.  When you run the command:\nsudo apt-get update  \n\nyour computer checks the remote sources for updates and caches the list of packages in each repository you have enabled.\nBoth ClamAV and ClamTK are already in the repositories, so there is no need to download them from their respective sites.  To install them you can use this command from the command line:\nsudo apt-get install clamtk clamav  \n\nOr you can install them from the Ubuntu Software Center\n ClamTK\n ClamAV\nLike Windows, Ubuntu does support packaged binaries that allow you to install on a click.  However Ubuntu (and all Debian based distros in general) use .deb as their file format, not .exe like Windows.  What you probably downloaded was the source code to these programs, compressed in a format like tar.bz2 or tar.gz.  These formats are like the more generic .zip.  In order to install programs from their source you need to compile them and this process varies depending on what language the program was written in, etc.\nResources:\n\n*\n\n*Why aren't viruses an issue?\n\n\n*Do I need to have 'antivirus software' installed?\n\n\n*How do I install the latest clamav & clamtk?\n\n\n*How to install software in Ubuntu\n\nA: No, http://clamtk.sourceforge.net does have .deb files for download.  You can just double-click it.\n", "Q: Virtualization on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS We plan to introduce virtualization on our 64bit Ubuntu 12.04 LTS server so that we can run, in different VMs, a file server for our staff and some development machines for our IT team (code repository, continuous integration, VMs with different browsers/OS's for testing webapps, etc.).\nWe would like to find a virtualization solution that provides:\n\n\n*\n\n*Snapshots: ability to revert to a previous state of the machine (useful before installing a system update, etc.);\n\n*Hot backups: ability to create a copy of a machine for safety purposes;\n\n*Easy of use: simple user interface to create snapshots, create/start/stop/delete VMs.\n\n\nWhich virtualisation solution (e.g., KVM, VirtualBox, Xen, Xen/XCP, etc.) would you recommend for such a setup?\n\nA: Oracle VirtualBox can do all those things very nicely. It has easy to create snapshots, the machine's hard drive is a portable file so you can back it up, and has an optional GUI. There are other options, but none are as crazily simple as VirtualBox. It's super powerful, but so easy with the GUI a kid can use it. There are also ways to remotely use the VMs built right in VBox. If I were you I would download it from the website vs installing from the repositories, that way you have the latest version.\nFor your particular use, you will need to forward the network ports:\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/122641/how-to-forward-ports-to-a-virtual-machine-and-use-it-as-a-server/\nhttp://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html\n\nA: You may want to check Ubuntu Server default virtualization solution (KVM) in addition to libvirt http://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/virtualization.html\nThe later will provide virt-manager package that contains a graphical utility to manage local and remote virtual machines\n", "Q: What's the point of dnsmasq in NetworkManager? I very recently came to realize that the caching is disabled by default on the dnsmasq that is integrated with NetworkManager. In my mind, that defeats the point and makes dnsmasq a redundant layer in name resolution. \nObviously, I must be missing something - what is the purpose of dnsmasq in NM?\n\nA: The point is that switching nameservers is annoying. /etc/resolv.conf only gets read once when you start an application (technically when you do the first lookup), so if you change nameservers (because you moved from wireless to wired to 3g and back etc.), you will need to restart applications that need to look up names (such as browsers).\nThis is mitigated by using the local resolver, which does respond to these changes in a timely fashion, allowing applications to remain stupid and only query the nameserver on localhost.\n\nA: From man NetworkManager.conf on 16.04, on the dns option:\n\ndnsmasq: NetworkManager will run dnsmasq as a local caching\nnameserver, using a \"split DNS\" configuration if you are connected\nto a VPN, and then update resolv.conf to point to the local nameserver.\n\nSo basically if you connect to a VPN, NetworkManager can instruct dnsmasq to use any VPN-specific DNS servers for required domains. This is impossible to do with just resolv.conf.\n", "Q: Is there any way to automatically download torrents? I want to be able to set up downloads of weekly TV shows so the .torrent is automatically downloaded to my computer, ie. I just tell the program that I want (for example) Adventure Time to download as soon as it is available, and it takes care of the rest.\nA quick google search showed me that TED was an option for Ubuntu, but the website seems to have disappeared.\nDoes anybody know of a way to do this?\n\nA: I am sure that flexget is the thing you are looking for.\nI'm using this with Ubuntu (12.04 10.04) together with transmission.\nAnd as soon the torrent is available it will add it to transmission.\nThey say its trivial to set up, but no it ain't.\nBut as soon you succeed in configure it (only one file) it works like a charm for weeks and weeks (years...).\nThere is no demand of account anywhere , its just your PC finding torrents in rss feeds according to your specified minimum quality and size then it ads it to your preferred torrent-client.    \n\nA: Maybe this is what you are looking for... Its called \nSick beard\n\n\"Sick Beard is a PVR for newsgroup users (with limited torrent\n  support). It watches for new episodes of your favorite shows and when\n  they are posted it downloads them, sorts and renames them, and\n  optionally generates metadata for them.

I want to try out developing desktop applications with the UI designed using html5,css and jquery and the back end code written in python. Is this possible? I have already tried out the WebKit but is there any other way? If it is possible can you point me to a good tutorial?\n\nA: html5 and css requires web rendering engine in the background . So you have to use one of the web rendering engine . Webkit is the most commonly used web rendering engine because of its perfomence and portability , You can also try Gecko  from firefox but it is very hard to implement  when compared to webkit\n", "Q: Permissions depending on parameters passed to application I have a java app that writes to a very important table I have. This is sudo protected, but this app takes a parameters for where the output should go. The default is the REAL DEAL but the \"output\" parameter takes priority over the default, so if a user provides a path that they have write permission for, say: /home/username/mystuff then I would like for users to be allowed to write to these directories. \nThe app is launched in a shell script, so I am wondering if I can check that the string does not equal /path/to/real/deal and not empty (since /path/to/real/deal is the default) and allow users to write to places they have permissions for.\nMy impression of linux permissions is that it is tied to the application itself and cannot be conditionally approved, but I wonder if there is some bash fu or alternative method I can perform to get me my desired result.\nUsing Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS\n\nA: Linux permissions are tied to the user (not to the application).\nYou might get the result you want by starting the script as a normal user: \nOUTFILE=\"/home/username/mystuff\"\nDEFAULT=\"/path/to/real/deal\"\ntouch \"$OUTFILE\" || OUTFILE=\"$DEFAULT\"\nsudo java_app \"$OUTFILE\"\n\nTouch will not work in a directory where the user has no write permission so in that case the touch will fail and the outputfile will get the default path/filename.\nSudo is invoked AFTER this test. \n", "Q: Midori - How to activate Shockwave Flash on startup I love this little speedy browser, however, I do not always find it easy to configure.\nFor some reason Shockwave Flash extension would not stay activated on startup, as the Adblock extension does, which is slightly annoying. I'd prefer to combine it with a flashblock userscript rather than to go to the preferences everytime I want to use flash.\nDo you know how to correct this?\n\nA: Maybe this answer comes a little too late, but it might help someone who googles about this issue.\nI've recently installed elementary OS that comes with Midori as default browser. I first tried installing Ubuntu restricted extras:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\nIt worked with SOME youtube videos, but not the ones embedded on facebook. Also, when I tested flash player plugin (here: http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/), it said \"missing plugin\".\nThen, I added this line: *export MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH=\"/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins\"* to configure Midori's flash path (this is for elementary OS.

However, when I boot Ubuntu, I'm left with a black screen which prints alot of text about starting/stopping services, but does not function as a terminal. It hangs indefinitely at this screen until I shutdown via power button, which causes it to print more text in regards to \"unmounting\" and \"halting.\"\nThus far I have completed the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed rEFIt & GPT fdisk on OSX.\n\n*Created a new partition, installed Ubuntu 12.04 onto that ext4 partition via USB.

Follow these instructions instead, and you'll likely have better luck.\n\nA: I had a similar problem on a MacBook Pro mid-2010. In my case the screen would go completely black after showing some boot messages; also was not responsive to keyboard. I was able to fix the problem by removing the NVidia binary driver and switching back to Nouveau. I booted from the install disk and created a chroot environment to uninstall the driver.

Any ideas how to restore it?\n\nA: There are tools that might help you undelete the files, but usually it's a slow and mostly manual process. Search engines are your friends.\nIt may be easier to boot up a live CD or USB, mount your system's root partition, then copy /usr/lib to /mnt/{root.drive}usr/lib, but you will only get the default lib files and not what you may have added.\nI think the best option is to reinstall the OS. Of course, you will want your data on a separate partition that is not formatted during install, good practice IMHO.\n\nA: Supposing apt-get still works you can try to use dpkg to get a listing of the packages that have files there and then install them with apt-get.

My current location is thousands of kilometers from Ubuntu's main server and I am obliged to use one of its mirrors in my country of domicile.\nDo the owners of Ubuntu implement measures to periodically check their files (eg. ISOs, updates, security patches) at their mirror sites have not been tampered and/or malware/trojans have not been introduced by hackers?\nMy personal experience with installing and updating Ubuntu from the main server took at least two hours whereas the same process took just 10 to 15 minutes when I used Ubuntu mirror site available in my country.\n\nA: Packages in the Ubuntu archive are signed with a GPG key, which anyone attempting to replace code on the mirror, doesn't necessarily have. It would be possible to forge a signed package, but it's not super trivial to do so.\nYou can generally trust the packages signed with these GPG keys. When updating through update-manager or apt you will be warned when packages are not signed with a key that is in the system apt package keyring. You will have to manually accept installation of such packages. If you see this warning for a package coming from the official Ubuntu archive, or a mirror thereof, you should probably not install the package, and immediately report a bug about it.\nFor ISOs, you will need to verify the checksum hashes with what's on the official Ubuntu servers.\n", "Q: How to fix compilation errors that mention \"stray ‘\\342’\" and \"stray ‘\\200’\"?

Thus, you get error messages about unrecognized Unicode characters, and you get error messages showing that the contents of the string are being interpreted as unquoted program code.\nYou will note that the quotes you've used have separate characters for beginning and ending a quotation (they are curved the way quotes are often typeset). Many word processors--as Jobin suggested--will automatically turn simple \" quotes into such fancy quotation marks. If you're using a word processor to compose C programs, you should use a text editor instead.\nUbuntu comes with gedit installed by default (though there are many other text editors to choose from, too). Like many text editors, gedit provides syntax highlighting for many programming languages including C (so different text in your program will shown in different colors to signify its meaning), which is a handy feature and makes a text editor much more convenient and user-friendly for programming than a word processor.\nThis might be Ubuntu-specific, if you're used to a text editor on another platform that automatically reduces pasted quotations marks to the non-fancy version. But this question might end up getting closed and migrated to Stack Overflow.\n\nA: The problem is that you have Unicode quotation marks instead of ASCII quotation marks; probably your editor automatically changed them, or you copied the text from a site that does this automatically in its authoring software. Replace the quotes with normal ASCII quote (0x22, \") and it should work.\nFixed source:\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main()\n{\n    printf(\"Hello World\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nA: You can use the sed command to fix these issues. \nThis will give you a quick preview of what will be replaced.\nsed -re 's/”|“/\"/g' File.txt\n\nThis will do the replacements and put the replacement in a new file called WithoutSmartQuotes.txt:\nsed -re 's/”|“/\"/g' File.txt > WithoutSmartQuotes.txt\n\nThis will overwrite the original file:\nsed -i .bk -re 's/”|“/\"/g' File.txt\n\n", "Q: How to create Live CD once I downloaded the zip file.

I removed other networks from /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules because i tried adding multiple interfaces after reboot broken the network and it kept adding more addresses.

Still no network... \nKernel is 2.6.32-41.\nKeep in mind it worked just prior reboot and that I have very little knowledge about Linux. I'm Windows guy. \n\nA: The answer is most unpredictable I've encountered. Changing back Hyper-V processors to 1 from 4 resolves the problem.

As stated in your output, you can install it entering this command: \nsudo apt-get install mysql-client-core-5.5\n\n\nA great guide, well written, step by step and with very useful information is the Ubuntu community LAMP guide. If you will install one component or all the packages, that guide will be really useful.\n\nA: Ulrich is correct. MySQL 5.6 is the Enterprise Edition and you shouldn't install the 5.5 client tools. If your basedir is /usr/local/mysql, this should work for you:\necho 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin' | sudo tee /etc/profile.d/mysql.server.sh\n\nLog out, and log back in. You should be able to run \"mysql\" from the command line. \n\nA: I solved this problem with:\ncd /usr/bin\nrm -rf mysql*\nsudo apt-get remove --purge mysql\\*\nsudo dpkg -l | grep -i mysql\napt-get autoremove \napt-get autoclean \nsudo apt-get install mysql-client mysql-server\n\nI had this problem because I once deleted /usr/bin/mysql before.\n\nA: Please do not install mysql-client-core-5.5 from the ubuntu repos into your 5.6 installation because it will most likely break it. The DEBs contain server and client. I suppose it is just a PATH problem. \nLook at your PATH variable and locate your mysql binaries. If the bin directory of your MySQL installation is not in your PATH create a short shell script in /etc/profile.d which appends the MySQL binary directory to the Path and exports it. Afterwards log out and in again.\n", "Q: Chrome tab syncing across devices not working I've found this guide to sync Chrome tabs across devices and I enabled sync on both devices. Nothings happening though when I enabled tab sync on my PC and Notebook. How do I open the tabs from one device on the other? Both devices run Ubuntu 12.04 64bit.\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/96664/how-to-sync-open-tabs-across-computers-using-google-chrome/\n\nA: The article that you are referring to was published in 2011.\nWhen opening Chrome, or chromium, it is stated at the top of the page that:\nWARNING These experimental features may change, break, or disappear at any time...\nIt does appear to be the case that the option within \"http:// flags\" has indeed disappeared.\nThat particular option of syncing open tabs is not available in either chromium(Version 25.0.1364.160) or Chrome stable(Version 26.0.1410.43) on Ubuntu 12.04.02.\nTake a look a more recent guide, from Google, regarding the Sync tabs across devices functionality.\nHowever, there is an option to look at the open tabs on some other devices(see note below).\n\n*\n\n*You need to be signed-in a Google account to use this functionality.\n\n\n*Open wrench in upper right hand corner of your browser\n\n\n*Select \"Advanced sync settings\"\n\n\n\n*Open a new tab\n\n\n*Look in the lower right hand corner of the browser and click on the area that say \"Other devices\" as indicated below:\n\nNote: I can't speak to how this functionality works across all devices.

This leads to the second issue: the node.js packaged in Ubuntu only provides a \"nodejs\" binary, not \"node\". The \"proper\" way to fix this is to use Chris Lea's PPA to avoid using Ubuntu node packages entirely. If at some point your node.js is too old for your needs, use those PPAs. But for now the quick&dirty solution is to create a symbolic link from /usr/bin/node to /usr/bin/nodejs to be able to use packages from npm:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node\n\n*Uninstall the Ubuntu lessc: sudo apt-get autoremove node-less.\n\n*install the latest less! sudo npm install -g less\nThe result:\n$ lessc --version\nlessc 1.3.3 (LESS Compiler) [JavaScript]\n\n", "Q: External monitor stopped working I have an ASUS notebook with ubuntu 12.10.

Does anyone has any idea what I could try?\nThanks for your attention!\n\nA: I simply put the cable the wrong way...\nSo if you ever happen to be in the same case, and you are using a mini-DVI to VGA adapter or just mini-DVI, just mke sure you plugged it the right way: the shape of mini-DVI doesn't prevent you for pluggiing it upside down. I think they all have a logo and it should be on top. If you ever plug it upside-down, like below, ubuntu might detect the cable, but won't recognize the monitor.\n", "Q: How can I tell how long for Watchdog to wait to stop all processes? I have a server which is monitored by Watchdog, and experiences reboots occasionally due to faulty network hardware I am unable to replace at the moment. As I read, Watchdog sends a SIGTERM to all processes, requesting a safe shutdown, and after a short time, sends a SIGKILL, which will stop the process immediately. However, in this case, it leads to data corruption since the main process of importance is not fully shut down yet and has unwritten data.\nHow long is this pause Watchdog takes between asking all processes to stop, and forcing them to stop? Is it hardwired within Watchdog, set in watchdog.conf(if it was, it never got documented in the manpage), or the same as another system setting? How may I change this setting?\nEdit: I've found the timeout, but I am still looking for instructions on how to rebuild and integrate with the system properly.\n\nA: From the Watchdog source, shutdown.c, line 445, the pause is hardwired into Watchdog, and is five seconds.\n\nA: I have posted some information about building, configuring and testing the Linux watchdog daemon here:\nhttp://www.sat.dundee.ac.uk/~psc/watchdog/Linux-Watchdog.html\nThe short answer is you need to configure your system to build for this project:\nsudo apt-get build-dep watchdog\nsudo apt-get install build-essential automake libtool\n\nThen get the source code, which you probably already have, but the latest can be done with these steps:\nsudo apt-get install git\ngit clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/watchdog/code watchdog-code\n\nMove to the code directory and prepare for compiling:\ncd watchdog-code\nautoreconf -i\n./configure\n\nThen to the source directory and compile it:\ncd src\nmake clean\nmake\n\nIn the current directory you will have the new binaries. Test them before you make them \"live\" by using sudo make install, or at least make back-up copies of the system supplied programs. They are bloated compared to the system ones due to debug symbols, you can use the strip command if you want to reduce their size.\nCan you say what sort of time you need for SIGTERM to work?\nEdited to add:\nIf you are using the current GIT pull (14 Sep 2013) then edit shutdown.c and at line 363 change \"safe_sleep(4);\" to have your wanted timeout value in seconds.\nIf editing the code for the system-supplied watchdog (as referenced above) take care not to sleep() for more than the hardware timeout (normally 60 seconds) as the system will simply reboot! That was the reason for the safe_sleep() function, to keep the watchdog fed while waiting.\n\nA: The official 5.15 version at Sourceforge now has this option included. It can be configured in the file watchdog.conf using the line:\nsigterm-delay       = 5\n(commented out in the example file). Please note the experimental 'V6' version should not be used any more as 5.15 has practically all of its features and several bug-fixes as well.

I'm aware of the success of Dual boot Surface Pro with Ubuntu?, but want to stay away from GRUB completely.\nSo far I have tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install and test that rEFInd is working for just Windows 8 with no issues\n\n*Install Ubuntu 12.10 from \"ubiquity -b\" to prevent GRUB from being installed\n\n*Verify I can still properly boot into Windows 8\n\n\nUnfortunately this doesn't seem to generate any .efi stubs for Ubuntu, so I'm not sure what to do at this point.  What can I do to generate these without installing GRUB or any other boot loader?  Keep in mind that at this stage I can't actually boot directly into Ubuntu, only a live installation, unless there is something else I should be doing during the actual installation.\nTo reiterate, what I want to do is: Install Ubuntu without GRUB, generate efi stubs for Ubuntu, never touch the efi firmware or the Windows boot directory, and then rely on rEFInd to find these stubs during bootup.\n\nA: First, I assume that by \".efi stubs\" you mean files with .efi extensions on the EFI System Partition (ESP). Those are EFI program files -- most commonly boot loaders, but also sometimes programs and utilities.\nIf you want to boot Windows and Ubuntu via rEFInd without using GRUB, then the only EFI programs you need to have on the ESP are the Windows boot loader (installed by Windows), rEFInd (refind_x64.efi), and an EFI filesystem driver for whatever filesystem you used with Ubuntu (probably ext4_x64.efi, in the drivers or drivers_x64 subdirectory of the directory that holds refind_x64.efi). The ext4fs driver will enable the EFI, and therefore rEFInd, to read the Linux kernel on the main Linux partition. Linux kernels since version 3.3.0 have included an EFI stub loader, which is a way to turn the Linux kernel into its own boot loader. Thus, with rEFInd and an ext4fs driver on the ESP, rEFInd can launch the Linux kernel directly from a Linux partition. There is one other thing you'll need, though: a /boot/refind_linux.conf file to hold options for Linux. A minimal example looks like this:\n\"Boot with normal options\"   \"ro root=/dev/sda8\"\n\"Boot into single-user mode\" \"ro root=/dev/sda8 single\"\n\nThis example boots the installation on /dev/sda8. You can add more options to have it present a graphical startup display or for other reasons, but the above (with a modified root= value, in all probability) will work with most systems.\nA variant on this approach is to copy your kernel(s) to the ESP (probably in the ESP's EFI/ubuntu directory) and not install a Linux filesystem driver. This has some advantages on some systems, but it requires copying the kernel every time the packaging system updates it. If you do it this way, you'd put refind_linux.conf in the directory on the ESP where you store your kernels.\n", "Q: Question about installing Ubuntu 12.10 on laptop I have a Lenovo Y580 laptop with a 1Tb hard drive and a ssd installed on the mSata. \nSo apparently Lenovo did something weird with the hard drive: there are already 4 partitions on the hard drive, and for some reason the Ubuntu install disk cannot detect my windows installation.

Will I potentially break my SSD?\nEDIT I decided to remove the SSD just in case.\n\n*If I install Ubuntu on the spare hard drive, can I then remove it, put it in a usb drive enclosure, and put the original drive back in, then boot from the external hard drive? Would I have to install a boot loader on the original drive, or will the drive be able to boot from USB?\nThank you.\n\nA: I don't know about (1), so I'm just going to answer the second question.\nYes, you can! As a matter of fact you can even install Ubuntu directly onto the USB hard drive. (Just make sure you select the correct drive during installation.) The boot loader will then be installed onto the same drive as Ubuntu.\nIf you are able to boot off you hard drive without using tricks (like the Plop Boot Manager: http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanagers.html, or similar) entirely depends on your BIOS.

I suggest using IP addresses instead of domain names because it's much faster, reducing the time each netstat call takes and therefore increasing the chances of actually catching your process. You should run the netstat command as root, if you think that the process does not belong to the currently logged in user. So, first use nslookup to figure the IP of the domain:\nnslookup weather.noaa.gov\n\nFor me this gives at the moment: 193.170.140.70 and 193.170.140.80. Now you can put up an infinte loop of netstats. The output you can filter using grep (and discard STDERR).\nwhile [ true ] ;  do netstat -tunp 2>/dev/null | grep -e 193.170.140.70 -e 193.170.140.80  ; done\n\nOf course edit the IP addresses in the above example. This example is probing for TCP and UDP (-tu) connections, does not do DNS resolution (-n) and lists the processes (-p). If you think there's enough time to do DNS resolution, simply omit the -n option for netstat and put the domain for grep instead of the IP. You can stop the infinite loop by simply pressing CTRL+c\nHope this helps,\nAndreas\nPS: I know, this is not the ideal, efficient or clean way to do it, but for a one-time search this should be sufficient.\n\nA: You could also \"break\" the application via /etc/hosts addition of the FQDN that's\nbeing connected to.  Give it some non-routable IP like 10.1.2.3 (or 127.0.0.1) and see what breaks.\n", "Q: Removing folder shortcuts from gnome-panel I am using 12.10, GNOME classic desktop.

To check if your computer supports PAE, run this command in terminal:\ngrep --color=always -i PAE /proc/cpuinfo\nHowever, it is often recommended to use 64-bit Ubuntu to get the full benefits of using the 64-bit architecture. It should be noted that there is no \"Virtual Address Extension\", which means that applications still get the same amount of virtual memory since the virtual addresses are still 32 bits while the physical addresses are 36 bits.

Can I make my QT GUI programs run after completely removing unity desktop? I am building a desktop environment on QT. How can I run my program without unity.\n\nA: Unity isn't a dependency of QT apps in any way that I know of. If your question is \"How can I launch a program without Unity?\" The answer is this: I wouldn't uninstall Unity at all because you don't need to. First press CTL-ALT-F1. Log in, and type xinit -- :1. Now, with the X Terminal, you can start you window manager (for example metacity) and anything else you want. To make sure you always have a working XTerm, remember to use & after commands.\nBasically, this just creates a new X screen, and you can switch back to your main screen with CTL-ALT-F7. To go back to your new X screen, press CTL-ALT-F8. You can create up to 6 X screens at a time, each one corresponding to F7-F12.

For directories, execute permissions give the ability to enter the directory (that is, to cd to it, or to open it up in a file manager). They also give the ability to attempt to access files in the directory (though whether or not that will succeed also depend on other permissions, sometimes including the permissions of the files being accessed).\nroot is able to enter the directory because it is not really bound by permissions in the usual way. In many ways, commands and applications that are run as root will try to respect permissions in order to abide by the wishes of the user. But root has the power to perform any operation (that the OS is capable of performing) on any file or directory. In a root shell, cding into a directory that doesn't have any execute permissions will succeed.\nThe solution to the problem is to run:\nchmod u+x masternotes\n\nThat gives (+) the owner of masternotes (u) executable permissions (x) on the directory.\nThen you'll be able to enter into the directory and attempt to access files there, as a normal user.\nIf you want members of its group owner to be able to do this too, then you could run this instead:\nchmod ug+x masternotes\n\nBut you are probably the only member of your user-specific group (which owns the folder).\nThe chmod command here does not need to be run as root--it is deliberate that I have not included sudo in either command. You own the folder, so you can change its permissions yourself--you don't need root to do it for you.\nIn case you're interested in setting execute permissions numerically, remember that for each digit you add (starting with zero):\n\n\n*\n\n*4 for read.\n\n*2 for write.\n\n*1 for execute.\n\n\nFor example, if you wanted everyone to be able to read and execute some-file but only the owner to be able to write, you'd use:\nchmod 755 some-file\nI recommend FilePermissions in the community documentation, for further reading on file permissions in Ubuntu, including the executable bit and its special meaning for folders.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Mobile OS for my Nokia C7 I Have a Nokia C7 and would love to use ubuntu mobile OS. Is there any plans of releasing for Nokia C7 phones as well? I guess the hardware is same as any standard touch phone...\n\nA: Sadly I'd say no. Porting an OS to a device is far more complicated than you think. It usually requires intimate knowledge of a devices hardware and many manufacturers do not provide this information, requiring porters to literally dissect the workings of a device in order to compile the needed drivers and software. Doing so is a very long and drawn out process and even then the task may not succeed. Even devices as popular as the Samsung Galaxy S2 and S3 (international versions) aren't getting popular Custom Android ROMs like Cyanogenmod because the Devs can no longer spare the immense effort that would be required to build the necessary software to run the OS properly and Samsung isn't being forthcoming about the inner workings of their Hardware.\nIn the end a phone like your Nokia probably won't be seeing Ubuntu any time soon.\n", "Q: Is there a script that runs as root when user logs in? When a user logs in I need to execute a command that needs escalated privileges. I don't want to give the user sudo access for that command.

This can be done easily if you don't expect Fred to try very hard to escape his \"sandbox\".\n$ cat ~fred/.bash_login\n#!/bin/bash\nexec /usr/local/bin/foo\n\n## in ubuntu each user has a group of his \"own\"\n$ sudo chown foo:fred ~fred ~fred/.bash_login /usr/local/bin/foo\n## prevent fred from altering the files and directories we care about\n$ sudo chmod g-w ~fred ~fred/.bash_login /usr/local/bin/foo\n## make script foo run with user foo's privileges\n$ sudo chmod u+s /usr/local/bin/foo \n\nSo fred will now not even get a shell prompt because the first thing his login shell does is replace itself with foo; when script foo exits, fred will be logged out. The reason Fred should lack motivation to climb out of this sandbox is that many programs allow subordinate shells to be opened which would allow fred to undo the poor-man's lockout shown here.\nUsing this method with \"root\" instead of some non-superuser foo can be used to hijack root, so don't do that. \n\nA: I would use chmod 6755 filename  (or 6711 if you dont want to be read by other users)and then put it in cron... This should work, as it is permission to run this file as owner.

You'd probably use some syntax like the following (has to be run in dirB, and be aware that it's recursive):\nfind ./ -type f -exec cp '../dirA/{}' ./ \\;\n\nThe -type f tells find to only take into account regular files, the -exec says: run the following command on every file.

There's an (as far as I can tell) undocumented feature of gnome-control-center which can be used to show a specific panel directly.

The shade option seems to be present in wmctrl, but not in xdotool. \nIt is possible to use wmctrl to select the currently active window and roll it up by using this command, adapted from the helpful manpage:\nwmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b toggle,shaded\n\nThis command lets wmmctrl select the active window and toggle whether it is shaded or not. This should be supported on most window managers including metacity: test it in gnome-terminal but not guake as it won't have any effect because of the way guake terminal displays.\nI would not bind it to mouse wheel, but to another button on the mouse, like a secondary one on the side (if you have one). Then just clicking it will toggle the rollup of the active window. \nSo install the programs with\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl xbindkeys\n\nYou need to add the lines below to ~/.xbindkeysrc (you can choose your own binding or combination; this is just my additional mouse key as an example):\n# specify a mouse button/combination\n\"wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -b toggle,shaded\"\nb:9\n\nRun killall xbindkeys and then xbindkeys & so that the configuration file is reread (or logout and login again).\nThis is about the best you can do for the minute, and is the same as what you ask for, but done in a slightly different way, so it might be useful for you.\nFor more information, see man wmctrl, man xbindkeys or the Ubuntu manpages online.\n", "Q: Can I get an @ubuntu.com email address for the Ubuntu-related event I'm organising?

It does this magic without any addons\nMulti-protocol support: It supports HTTP, HTTPS and FTP protocols to let you download files from internet. It also supports Metalinks\nIntelligent file management: It uses an intelligent file management system to automatically categorize your files based on their extensions. All the downloads are grouped in different folders as per their categories.\nResume support:  You can pause the downloads to download them later, you needn’t start from the beginning again. It also automatically retries when a segment or download fails\nAdd or remove segments: You can add or remove download segments dynamically without interrupting the download\nClipboard Monitoring: No need to copy paste your download links, it monitors your clipboard\nLimit downloads:  You can limit the number of simultaneous downloads, when one download ends, another starts automatically\nFlash video download: One click flash video download from most of the sites is supported for all the browsers.\nSmart Scheduler: You can easily schedule flareGet to download files automatically. It allows you to start and pause downloading files at the set time.\nBatch Downloads: You can simply import urls from a text file (each link in separate line) or an html file and download them all.\nMulti language support: flareGet is being translated into many languages, currently English, Arabic, Italian, Chinese(Simplified), French, Czech, Bengali, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese are available.\n\nA: Finally I solved the question  (Thanks @rostislav-stribrny )\nJDownloader is capable of handling running instance of download (throttle, pasue, resume, add etc) .\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install JDownloader  (Tested in v0.9)\n\n*Launch it\n\n*Install add-on JD Remote Control (Addons -> Addons manager-> JD remote)\n\n*Enable JD Remote Control (Addons -> (tick))\n\n*goto  http://127.0.0.1:10025/help or http://localhost:10025/help   ( IP:port  )\n\n\nExample\nTo throttle all running download to 10K  http://localhost:10025/action/set/download/limit/10\nFrom terminal wget http://localhost:10025/action/set/download/limit/10\nTo pause : wget http://localhost:10025/action/pause\n\nA: despite you seem to be looking for something very specific, and despite you solved it already, I would still like to recommend uGet, I've been using it sindce 12.04 (12.10 64 bits now) and I am very satisfied with the results!\n\nA: If you are in 10.04 get a copy of downloader for X\nsudo apt-get install d4x\n\nWill do everything you want :)\nhttps://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/d4x/\n\nA: FlareGet 1.4-7 which is going to be released next week, supports all the features you need and even supports throttling of downloads.

Are there any PPA?\nIf no, how to make it from sources? Which dev libs I'll need to do this?\n\nA: I have not found an \"official\" PPA for new tmux packages.  However a PPA search on launchpad turns up quite a few options.  \nMany are out of date, but I found a ppa by pi-rho that has current tmux and tmux-next packages for 12.04, 12.10 and 13.04.  (At the time of this answer they are at versions 1.8-1ubuntu1~ppa2 and 1.9~20130425~bzr3062+9-1ubuntu1~ppa0).  There is no guarantee that that PPA will continue to be maintained up-to-date, but for now it seems like a fair option.\nBe aware that it also has a number of other packages in it.  If you add this PPA you will find the other packages also get upgraded unless you do some sort of apt pin config.\n\nA: In order to run tmuxinator on Ubuntu Precise (12.04), I needed tmux v1.8+, which is available in Saucy now and therefore in the \"backports\" repository for Precise. Here's how I got it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Per UbuntuBackports, edit /etc/apt/sources.list to enable the \"precise-backports\" repositories (around line 45).\n\n*Update your repository cache with sudo apt-get update\n\n*Per different instructions, install the backported version (1.8) with sudo apt-get install -t precise-backports tmux.

As of writing this answer, version 1.8 is only 19 hours old.\nIf you for some reason need a newest version, then you might download the code and build/install tmux by yourself. Should not be a big deal, since tmux has dependencies only on libevent and ncurses packages, and both of these packages are present on most if not all of Linux distros.

I have a Samsung N-150 plus net-book, and I have always had difficulties in watching movies on it. I thought it's due to Windows 7 starter, so I changed my OS to Windows XP.\nAlthough its been running quite smoother after then, but in high definition movies it plays them like slow motion and sometimes the movie's sound and display are not matched together.\nI read in Yahoo answer that Ubuntu may help me in this field, and I came here to ask you if its helpful to install Ubuntu on my net-book?\n\nA: I found this question somewhat funny, since your computer has only 1024x600 display.\nNevertheless, Samsung N-150 has an Intel Atom N455 1.66 GHz and GMS 3150 graphics card, which is simply not enough to flawlessly play high definition movies. Perhaps it could handle some 720p movies depending on the used coded, but definitely not 1080p. Changing OS will not help, since it's the hardware that is not powerful enough.\nThere was a discussion about this CPU and HD movies, here.\nAnd another link related to what Atom CPU's could handle particular HD content, here.\n", "Q: Romanian special characters: the default (comma, standard) version looks bad in LibreOffice, the cedilla versions are reported as incorrect There are certain Romanian characters (ș, î, ț, ă, â) which are handled differently in the different key layouts.\nThe standard layout makes them look odd, different from the other letters in Libreoffice (and also in MSOfficeXP).\n\nIn msoffice 2007 they look the same (that is: all look fine).\nIn fact these characters are differently constructed in the different layouts, although msoffice 2007 seems to avoid displaying the difference. (Which also has the good effect that its spell-checker has no problems with them; while in LibreOffice the use of these characters with winkeys (and other layouts that display the characters properly) is reported as error (as seen in the image); on the other hand, in msofficexp the spell-checker reports as error any use of these characters with ro-std layout)\nThe problem is that the characters look bad in LibreOffice, as seen in the image. They look like they used a different font than the letters of the same word.\nCan this be helped?\n\nIn my keyboard layouts handler (in Xfce) I see 4 possible choices\n\n\n*\n\n*My problem is related to the way this characters have been implemented in the \"standard\" version of the Romanian layout. The Wikipedia  page says that there was a problem with these characters in Windows before Vista and was solved in later MSWin versions. What I am dealing here with is a problem with these characters in the layout that is called the \"primary\" one on the Wikipedia and \"standard\" in my panel list.\n\n\n\n*The \"secondary\" version (which is \"used as the default one by the majority of GNU/Linux distributions\", says Wikipedia) is called \"cedilla\" in my keyboard layouts options; it avoids this problem reported here, but just like winkeys, is not accepted by libreoffice spell check: any special character is seen as error; also, this is a version for programmers: it is like the US English layout, and the special characters are accessed in a way that would not change the usual use for programming (which is English); that is: they are too hidden and hard to get for people that would really use Romanian to write, for these special characters are very often used. As it is said here, the idea is not to change the layout too often for people that rarely use these characters.  It looks like so\n\n\n\n*The Winkeys layout looks like the \"standard\" (primary),except that the characters 'y' and 'z' switch positions, and some non-letter characters, like     quotation marks, have different keys.\n\n\n*The ”standard cedilla” layout is identical with ”standard”, and it avoids the problem reported here by entering characters that, while looking good, are rejected by the LibreOffice spell checker.\n\nSumming up --\nThe question could be reformulated like so:\nThe only Romanian keyboard layout accepted by the spell check (in LibreOffice, but also in Firefox and so on), the ”standard”, has special characters that does not look as they should, while the spell checker rejects precisely the characters that look good..\n\nA: Unlike similar issues with Unicode fonts, this is not really a matter of fonts and glyphs (although particular fonts may not provide both variants). The problem stems from the specific history of Romanian orthography, with the end result that the comma and cedilla variants have different code points. A dictionary written for one style of spelling will always see the other style as incorrect.\nInterestingly, the Hunspell ro_RO.aff file for Romanian appears to have the needed rules to work with a dictionary that provides both spellings, but the current Hunspell ro_RO.dic file provides only the comma variants.\nYou can, however, install a cedilla-based dictionary as an extension in LibreOffice.\nThe extension is available from the Apache OpenOffice site. The most recent version that I found is dict-ro.1.3-cedilla.oxt (or here - also here).\nDoubleclick the downloaded file (or right-click and choose Open with LibreOffice) to install. After installing, close any open LibreOffice elements and restart Writer.\nThe comma-based word was pasted from Omniglot Romanian and the cedilla-based word was typed with the Romanian-WinKeys keyboard. I had LibreOffice 3.5 handy, but I don't see anything in the extension that should be a problem in 4.x.\n\n\nA: In later versions of LibreOffice the \"bad look\" of Romanian Standard layout was fixed.\nI have also noticed that the default Romanian dictionary/spelling checker of MSOfiice Word 2016 in Windows 10 is compatible with Romanian Standard layout of both Windows and Linux as well as with the Android default Romanian keyboard. Romanian Standard Cedilla of Linux and Romanian Legacy of Windows 10 seem similar and are not compatible with that dictionary.\nFor the sake of  cross-system/cross-device compatibility, at the date of this answer the way to go seems to be the use of Romanian Standard layout in both Linux and Windows and the installation of a corresponding dictionary in Libreoffice.

I run 12.04 and am responsible for recording, editing and publishing the thing. We have our website, powered by Wordpress, so my question is really about the production part. \nI'm looking at Audacity for the audio and pitivi for the video... and my basic idea is to do it through G+ as a Hangout and record it. However if there is a cross-platform solution we could use I'm open to suggestions.\n\nA: I am also preparing for an event next month. Since I have made several videos using Ubuntu let me give you some tips:\n\n\n*\n\n*Most of the work will involve sound, cleaning sound, clipping errors out, etc.. so make sure everyone is on a place that tends to be silent or does not have a lot of background noise and that they have some idea of what to talk about and in what order.\n\n*If everyone has a good microphone, you will most likely not need to use Audacity. If not then Audacity will be the solution for background noise and other artifacts.\n\n*For the video editor I recommend openshot over pitivi. Openshot is more stable, friendlier and can cope with clipping which is what you will be doing in this case a lot. I used to use Pitivi for about a year until Openshot came out. Have not changed my mind yet. Use the PPA for openshot. Additionally Openshot can quickly save the file as mp4 with h.264.\n\n*Hangout can record and/or take pictures (Specially hangout on air which gives options to edit the video afterwards and streams/saves it to youtube).\n\n*If you also want to record the desktop, over recordmydesktop, istanbul or any other gui recording app I highly recommend kazam. Again, you need to use the PPA from kazam, but this screencast is very good and very simple to use. It can record on the fly without taking much resources compared to others and save in mp4/h.264 format. It also asks if you wish to edit the file afterwards with a video editor like pitivi or openshot.\n\n*It is possible to make the stream go to your wordpress site by pointing your wordpress post to your youtube video while is streaming. This way, any user that arrives on your site can click on the video and start seeing the live stream from there.\n\n*Since you are going to be the one recording, it is recommended that you be the one that:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Creates the hangout   \n\n*Names the hangout (Title of Hangout)\n\n*Starts the recording for hangout on air when everyone or most are connected (Need to click on the recording button at the bottom. Only visible to the hangout creator.\n\n*Prepares the wordpress site to receive the stream (If it applies)\n\n*Makes sure each topic that is talked about is done in the time frame agreed upon.\n\n*Serve as the one that asks the questions made by viewers (If it applies and there is no one else that can do it), says who will talk next or simply be a referee to any discussion.\n\n\n*Hangout now offers several plugins for it, I recommend specially the one called Toolbox since it offers the lower third option to make your podcast/streaming session more professional.\n", "Q: Dell Vostro 1015 Wifi Problem ubuntu joined the family today, on my own computer not connecting to the internet today, wifi setup yaptım.Dell Vostro 1015, builds vessels know how this problem.\n\nA: this is what is said about your Dell computer; click here\nMaybe it is usefull to put an internetcable into your computer and go to systemsettings tab hardware icon for additional drivers and let that process run.

Are Lubuntu, Kubuntu, and Ubuntu the same except for the desktop environment and a few programs?\n\nA: They are indeed largely the same except for the default set of packages you have after installation. For some, this means it has another desktop environment but other variations exist.\n\nA: There are significant, non-trivial differences. If your interest is not merely theoretical, the best way for you to experience the differences on your PC(s) would be to run each flavor separately from a Live CD or USB.  \nAs for software, the list for quantal is here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/quantal/ubuntu-desktop. You would put in kubuntu or lubuntu or xubuntu in place of ubuntu to get the lists for the respective desktop.\nThere are \"religious wars\" raging about which is \"better\" or which is \"lighter\" or which is more \"workflow-friendly\". I suggest you find out for yourself if you have the time and resources.\nAnd, as somewhat of a non sequitur, if you're really new, you may want to look at GNU/Linux Distribution Timeline 12.10.\n\nA: Kubuntu is based on KDE desktop, while Ubuntu uses the GNOME desktop. Gnome requires a lot more typing of commands in the terminal than KDE, which is more of a user-friendly environment. KDE is glossier, slicker, and can have things like 3D bouncing/stretching/exploding folders, while Gnome is more scaled back, plain jane. Gnome is \"supposed\" to be better on older equipment, using less resources, but I find Kubuntu so much faster than Ubuntu it's incredible.\n\nA: Ubuntu is the original creation for better or worse. It aims to be a 'modern' desktop system with a lot of eye candy. For older systems, it probably is not the best system as it is somewhat heavy on your system, although most likely not as heavy as Windows. Canonical (the company that is the creator of Ubuntu) has taken a lot of flak lately for going more their own way instead of staying with the community that helped develop Ubuntu. Unlike Microsoft or Apple products, Linux is heavily community-based. While there are some people who get paid to work on Linux, the overwhelming majority do this out of their own good will. Ubuntu was originally based on the Gnome desktop enviros. Canonical has abandoned those in favor or their own original desktop system. There was some effort made to retain a Gnome-LIKE environment alternative, but I am unsure if Canonical has abandoned that for later versions.\nIn the past, as in all things Linux, some people decided they wanted to make a different version of Ubuntu. One version is based on the KDE desktop environment. It is like how different version of Windows look different, but it would be more akin to how Apple looks and feels different. One thing about KDE is there are a lot of options. For your average user it may be overwhelming. If you like lots of things to play with, then Kubuntu is a nice choice. Personally, I like Kubuntu. There are a lot of applications included designed to fit with the style and theme of Kubuntu. If you prefer a more traditional menu-style system, Kubuntu would be better although you are not limited to using it that way.\nLubuntu is a nice alternative. It is based on the LXDE environment which aims to be lightweight. It's a great distro (short for distribution) for old systems (not ancient systems) as it aims to keep the impact on your system low. However, some people just like Lubuntu on their newer systems because it runs fast and takes up less resources. I'm not sure if there are any apps specifically designed for Lubuntu, but the apps that are included are picked because they are lightweight too. They won't have all the bells and whistles of apps on vanilla Ubuntu or on Kubuntu, but neither are they stripped. (Most users only use a small percent of all the features in a given program, so the programs focus on the most common used items.)\nSide note: A new distro called LXLE based on Lubuntu was recently announced:\n\"LXLE, which is short for “Lubuntu Extra Life Extension,” is actually based on Lubuntu 12.04, but it adds many extra features. First and foremost, LXLE is designed “to try to remain as light as possible while providing an incredibly rich environment of programs, features, and aesthetics,” the project team explains.\"\nhttp://www.pcworld.com/article/2031825/have-an-older-pc-try-the-new-ubuntu-linux-based-lxle.html\n-- If might be worth looking at if Lubuntu interests you, but you may want to stick with Lubuntu if you looking for something that already has been established for a whiles...\nIt's a lot personal opinion and/or preference. Underneath, both Kubuntu and Lubuntu are based off of Ubuntu's underworkings. Strictly speaking, the changes are more than just the desktop environments, but for practical purposes that's the easiest way to view it. \nYou might also look at Linux Mint which is based off of Ubuntu too. It's grown from a small but popular alternative to Ubuntu to become somewhat of a rival project spawning over different desktop enviros. Right now it is based over a combination of Cinnamon (a fork, similar to how Kubuntu and Lubuntu are forks of Ubuntu, of Gnome 3) and Mate (which is what Gnome 2 has changed to). Linux Mint was designed to provide a complete experience right out of the box without having to download additional packages after installing the OS. Personally I found it lighter weight than Ubuntu in the past and a crisper interface. It's a nice fit between Ubuntu and Lubuntu. They also have a (relatively) new KDE version of Mint.\nJust in case you are wondering, desktop environments are not limited to Ubuntu. They tend to be developed independently of the OS so they can fit into different Linux distributions. And yes, you can actually install multiple desktop environments onto the same installation, but things can start looking quite messy (as each environment has their own particular set of applications which may not be on the others) although generally everything runs okay. Aside from being a mess, you get to pick at login which desktop to use which can be kind of fun if not necessarily the best experience.\nFor Ubuntu, Kubuntu, and Lubuntu I recommend going with 12.04. That is a long-term support release and will give you more time to get use to them. Mint follows their own numbering scheme. Mint 14 is the latest version.\nThat's probably a lot of info, and that's just an overview. As others said, the best way is to just try each one out. If you have a spare machine, you can create one of more environments and install a distro of your choice. After installing, you'll get a menu when you boot up to boot to Windows or Linux. Have fun! =)\n", "Q: How to use xbacklight with brightness keys in a VAIO I have a Sony VAIO VPCCW15FL, with Ubuntu 12.04 installed.\nSadly, the brightness keys do not work out of the box, although the brightness meter reacts to the brightness up/down keypresses.\nYesterday, I installed xbacklight and tried it from the terminal. As a normal user (without sudo), I can run  xbacklight -40, for example, and the backlight dims. It works great.\nI then opened the Keyboard settings, and tried to set up two custom shortcuts for controlling the backlight brightness. I named one as \"Brightness up\", with xbacklight +10 as its command. Then I clicked to set the key, and \"Monitor brightness up\" showed up (as the key), so it was detected. However, even after rebooting, it didn't work. I tried changing the command to /usr/bin/xbacklight +10 but it didn't work either.\nWhat's wrong with this? Also, I would like to know if I can make the brightness meter use the xbacklight command instead of its default. Is there any file I can change to do this? I think that would be even better than defining the shortcuts since it would integrate with the brightness bar. Thanks :)\n\nA: Ok, I got to a different solution that should work for other laptops too, not only for VAIOs.\nMake sure that xbacklight and inotify-tools are installed, I just ran sudo apt-get install xbacklight inotify-tools .\nConfigure the following script and save it as a bash script (for example, save it as backlight_control.sh), and give it executable permissions with chmod +x backlight_control.sh.\nThen add it to your startup applications (can be done in 12.04 by clicking on the menu item on the top-right corner of the screen). The backlight level should be restored to its previous setting, and the controls should start working, after you log into your session. The brightness meter displays the correct value too.\nI hope this helps in case someone else is having the same issue. Any comments on its performance or anything else are welcome.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Script for setting the correct brightness for the backlight.\n# Depends on: xbacklight and inotify-tools,\n# Which can be installed by running:\n#       `sudo apt-get install xbacklight inotify-tools`\n#\n# Author: Esteban Serrano Roloff <e.serrano.r (at) me.com>\n#\n# Tested on a Sony VAIO VPCCW15FL\n# running Ubuntu 12.04\n# 2013-03-27 (YYYY-MM-DD)\n\n# Setup the correct paths (look inside /sys/class/backlight/)\ncurrent_brightness_path=\"/sys/class/backlight/sony/brightness\"\nmax_brightness_path=\"/sys/class/backlight/sony/max_brightness\"\n# To find the correct value for min_brightness, make the\n# brightness meter go to its minimum (by repeatedly pressing\n# the brightness down key), even if the actual brightness stays\n# the same, and then run on a terminal:\n#       `cat /sys/class/backlight/sony/brightness`\nmin_brightness=0\n\n\n#### No editing needed beyond this line (I hope) ####\nmax_brightness=`cat $max_brightness_path`\nrange=${max_brightness-min_brightness}\n\n\n\n# Set the correct brightness level on start up.\ncurrent_brightness=`cat $current_brightness_path`\nlet current_brightness_pctg=100*$current_brightness/$range\nxbacklight =$current_brightness_pctg\n\n# Listen for brightness changes, forever.\nwhile inotifywait -e close_write $current_brightness_path; do\n\n    current_brightness=`cat $current_brightness_path`\n    let current_brightness_pctg=100*$current_brightness/$range\n    xbacklight =$current_brightness_pctg\n\ndone\n\n", "Q: how to get back to the terminal while busy I am running an install from the terminal but I need to get access to a file in the same directory.\nWhat gets me back is bg or bz?

If I want to execute a script (I already marked it as executable), a text editor opens the script.

If I am looking for apps online (via Nautilus), all I get are text editors as well. \nSo the only way is that I open scripts via terminal.

I use the German localisation, so be aware that the real English names might be different. Open the file browser (Nautilus). In its Edit menu open the settings dialogue.

I'm computer-use literate but not highly technical.  Thx. :)\n\nA: Some newer computers have a Boot menu as well as a BIOS setup menu.\nFor example, some computers use F2 for BIOS setup and F12 for Boot menu, which allows you to boot the computer from CD/DVD-ROM or USB drive instead of HDD.\nSome older computers which don't have Boot menu, may use keys such as Delete or Esc as well to enter into BIOS menu.\nYou should consult your computer or motherboard manual to see which keys you should press at the very beginning of the boot process to have it displayed or try and find it by trial-and-error.\nOr you might get more specific info from users of the same computer brand/model if you specify your computer (or motherboard) brand/model.\n\nA: Just a wild shot here, but I found this to be useful. \nJust in case you have a Toshiba laptop which doesn't open the boot menu (caused by the FastBoot option turned on), you may reach it by doing a shutdown, press F2 and turn on the laptop. \nThis worked for me.\n\nA: It varies on the computer, but it's usually either F2, F12 or DEL. Make sure you press this key right after POST (when the brand logo appears, not after that).\n\nA: neither ubuntu or windows has effect on BIOS\nto get into BIOS you will have to turn on your computer and press F2 or Del depending on your motherboard\nmoreover, some computers use other key, try looking at your motherboard manual\n\nA: On modern computers, especially laptops, BIOS post is bypassed in order to boot faster. In order to access the BIOS settings, enter \nsudo shutdown -H now\nfrom a terminal window. When Ubuntu freezes, hold down the power button for at least 5 seconds.

I don't know what happened. But some of the videos work, those recently played became 0byte.\nOn Totem says: Stream contains no data.\nAnd on other player they don't play they are loaded but stuck.\n\nA: This normally happens when you start to copy several files but it never completes.

I am a new user of Linux OS's and I am trying Ubuntu 12.10 right in this days.\nThe overall impression is quite positive, but there are some features that make it still complicated for use from most would-be users and in certain specific situations.\nSo, today I had to compress a couple of important .jpeg images into .zip files, to send them through Thunderbird to a Windows-using bureau (at least as I guess), and the outcome of the compression (simple way: right click-> compress-> .zip and same folder without password) were files of the very same size! :-(\nI tried removing the .jpeg extension, I tried with formats other than .zip (although not sure they would be successfully opened from the recipient), I downloaded the \"7zip\" utility, I spent a while over all of this trying random things...not a different outcome than same-size files.\nSo, should I not be willing to use the command lines, how can I quickly compress these files or folders into .zip (not interested in other extensions at the moment) in case the simple procedure above does not work?\nSorry that you may find it a banal question, but I think these are the little hassles that prevent Unix-like OS's from becoming really widespread.\nThank you for your help!\n\nA: Last step in JPEG compression is entropy coding, which is in essence very similar to what ZIP algorithm do: \n\n\n*\n\n*identify sub-strings that are more common and;\n\n*give them shorter coded sequences;\n\n*less common sub-strings will be mapped to longer sequences. \n\n\nThe length to use is computed based on how likely it is to see the substring in the complete file. The result is that in the coded file (JPEG or .ZIP), all substrings of size s now have roughly equivalent chance of occuring. As a result, both .ZIP and JPEG files will compress very poorly through an additional pass of entropy coding.\n\nA: If the files were exactly the same size then something strange is going on. However, JPEG files will not compress much, if at all, with any typical archive software. It is expected that a 100kB JPEG file will be 99kB or larger when zipped.\n\nA: Lossy images (like jpeg-files) are hardly compressable. To further reduce the size of the zip-file, you must actually reduce screen size or quality of the images. This has nothing to do with which platform you use to zip files, you'll get the same results on a Windows machine.\nIf you do ever want to use the command line for this, you can as well have the zip-file created more efficiently (in terms of CPU cycles) with zip -0 zipfile.zip files.

In order to do that, you can edit your GRUB2 when you boot the computer. Press Shift when you boot and you should see the GRUB menu. Select \"Advanced options\", then \"e\" in order to edit the GRUB2 file. There's a line in here with parameters like \"ro quiet splash\". Add to it the parameter \"ACPI=off\". It means the kernel won't try to handle the power management of your computer. Once you added the line, press F10 in order to boot with the modification. \nACPI=off is not a solution as Ubuntu can't handle power management at all with it, meaning it won't be able to suspend/hibernate neither \"see\" the battery (but you can still work on battery).

I've read two good, long guides, but they made a mess in my head about operators and keywords. \nWhich are more commonly and widely used?

Some older shells need a special command. So you'll find also a program at /usr/bin/test.\n\n*[ is also a program to test for some condition. This software needs also a closing bracket and you can find it at /usr/bin/[.\n\n*[[…]] is an alternative to test and [. It was developed for the Korn shell (ksh). But you also find it in Bash versions greater than 2 and in the Z Shell. The double brackets have some nifty features:\n\n*\n\n*The shell does no word splitting or file name expansion.\n\n*You need no quoting.\n\n*Instead of -a (AND) or -o (OR) you can use && or ||.\n\n*The = can do a lot more.\n\n\n*((…)) is equivalent to let. So basically ((expression)) is the same as let \"expression\". However with let you can use more than one expression, but double braces only allow one expression.\n\n*$((…)) (and also $[…]) does some calculation. You shell tries to calculate the expression inside the braces and replaces the expression with the result. So echo $((1+1)) leads to echo 2. So your shells prints the number 2. \n\n\nEvery time when you want to compare two numbers you should use the option with a dash and two letters (-ge, -lt etc.). If you want to compare strings you should use = or !=.\nYour question regarding escaping is quite hard to answer. Because it depends on the software you use besides from the shell. So i.e. grep and grep -E need different escaping. This is also the case with sed, awk and others. So the best option is to have a look at the manpage. After some time you get accustomed and know when to use escaping.\n", "Q: command line for hiding and unhiding unity panel I use ubuntu 12.10 on a touchscreen with a digitizer pen to take notes and while I'm doing this I would rather to have all my desktop for this purpose.

How can I stop this from happening?\n\nA: I've recently had the same problem on Ubuntu 12.04LTS. It appears this confirmed regression bug: \nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1140716 affecting Sandy Bridge Intel Processors (e.g. my i5-2410M with onboard-graphics).\nI used the synaptic packager manager to remove the package \n xserver-xorg-core-lts-quantal and install the package xserver-xorg-core 2:1.11.4-0ubuntu10.12. \nAlso removed xserver-xorg-video-intel-lts-quantal and installed xserver-xorg-video-intel 2:2.17.0-1ubuntu4.3.\nSo far, this workaround seems to have solved the problem. \n\nA: I also have this issue and I know I need to replace my thermal paste on my i7 and ATI/AMD GPU. I think I have my ATI turned off and so I think I'm just using my intel one.  I recently cleaned out the fluff in my laptops heatsink.  I had been meaning to clean it out for a while and my system froze and the GPU dialogue came up the next time I restarted.  My laptop had also just been a bit wet from rain.\nI opened it and cleaned the heatsink etc looking for any water, I didn't find any but I cleared all sorts of dust out.\nMy test will be after I've replaced the thermal paste as there should be no hardware/heat issues.\nI've never had heat issues with my Sony Vaio, previously, I had an AMD HP which would get quite hot but was ok, there are many HPs with heat issues, especially the GPU.  The chip does not directly touch the heatsink as there is a thermal pad.  The GPU temp is not monitored and so it gets too hot and eventually stresses the solder joints underneath and they fracture causing screen flickering etc at moderate temperatures.  This is fixed by heating up the chip enough to melt the solder properly and then adding aluminium foil or extra copper to the heatsink etc to get proper heat conduction.\nSo my point is that while it may be a software bug, it could be an indication of a hardware issue, I have killed my flash plugin and not experienced the hang warning for a few days now as I either suspend or hibernate my system for the last few days so the plugin generally stays killed and my fan is not going full on like it was before.\n\nA: I face a similar issue intermittently. What happens is that there is a single error message in the log, which is read again and again and causes the error message to pop up. I solve it by typing this into the terminal:\nsudo rm /var/crash/*\n\nTo remove old crashes and the problem seems to be solved.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 graphics card error Since Ubuntu 12.10 I have an error with the video card. My graphics card is \"Intel HD graphics\".\nThe screen is distorted and sometimes there appear error messages.\n\nBecause Ubuntu does not recognize the graphics card, I installed mesa-utils. Now appears that I am using Intel ® Sandy Bridge desktop, but the errors are still on.\n\n\nI have installed Ubuntu 12.10 once again and this time I've made ​​no updates. Now there are no more errors. The problem must be due to the updates. Because I have to do about 300 updates, it will be difficult to pick out the faulty one.\n\nWith Synaptic I made updates stepwise and have now localized the faulty package.

I'm running Ubuntu-Studio 12.10 using GNOME-3, and I'm trying to set up a bash script in /etc/network/if-up.d to auto-configure my proxy settings based on the SSID of the network I'm connected to. I cannot get gsettings to work automatically, using any of the following:\ngsettings set org.gnome.system.proxy mode \"manual\"\nsudo -u blaine gsettings set org.gnome.system.proxy mode \"manual\"\nsu blaine -c 'gsettings set org.gnome.system.proxy mode \"manual\"'\n\nFurthermore, I'd like the script to change the environment variables http_proxy, https_proxy and so forth so that things like Wine would recognise them without having to log out and back in, and five days of googling tells me this is impossible.\nExcept - I know it can be done. The \"Apply System-Wide\" button in Unity does all this without having to re-log. Some further digging revealed this article that suggest the button accesses com.ubuntu.systemservice.setProxy, which is presumably part of the ubuntu-system-service package.\nIs it possible to use ubuntu-system-service to set a system-wide proxy via bash, the terminal, or similar?\n\nA: In case anyone is still looking for a solution, here is what I've found. Ubuntu exposes a DBus service via the ubuntu-system-service package, but I'm not familiar with DBus.\nHowever, inspecting the source code (ain't Open Source great?), the setProxy action does 2 things: \n\n\n*\n\n*Modify the system-wide environment\n\n*Modify the proxy settings used by APT\n\n\nFor the first case, the file at /etc/environment is modified. The second case is a little more complicated - files in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d are scanned for lines matching Acquire::::Proxy , where the  values are replaced. If there are no matching lines, then a proxy line (like the above) is added to each APT conf file.\nThe relevant files are found in UbuntuSystemService/backend.py (~line 209 @ version 0.2.5). \nAnswering your question, you can either make the same changes that ubuntu-system-service does, or attempt to figure it out using DBus:\ndbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=com.ubuntu.SystemService --type=method_call / com.ubuntu.SystemService.set_proxy string:'http' string:'127.0.0.1:8080'\n\nFor some reason, I keep getting False as a reply on this one, but you may be able to figure this out.\n\nA: This return true:\nsudo dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=com.ubuntu.SystemService --type=method_call / com.ubuntu.SystemService.set_proxy string:'http' string:'http://127.0.0.1:8081'\nand I find out you have to prefix it with scheme: http from this code:\nhttps://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-control-center/blob/master/debian/patches/50_ubuntu_systemwide_proxy.patch#L81\n", "Q: Broadcom b4313 not works There is wireless in network-manager, but not connect with WiFi-router.

The proviso being how much computer power and time you put to the task of decrypting.\nThe data is fairly secure as long as the \"FBI\" doesn't throw their computers at the task. As you are \"small fry\", no offence, its unlikely that this power will be used on your data.\nYou can use other encryption systems that take longer to decrypt like truecrypt but in the end its just time and power. Theoretically in ten years when computers go \"quantum\" all this data will be trivial to decrypt.\n", "Q: How do I manage regular fscks for large amounts of data? I'm guessing there's a recommended size that doing fsck would be counter productive, say if the size is 100TB or greater doing it with the default setting of 30 or 20 mounts or 180 days is a bit excessive, production environment can't be down that long provided that the backup of said data are there.  \nSo is there a limit or paper on \"yeah, after that (n)size it's suggested that the default settings change to something else (80-100 mounts) 300 days etc\".\n\nA: A 100TB filesystem sounds like a fairly bad idea (as you've clearly realised). I suggest dividing it into smaller filesystems if you can, for sanity. I quite like Val Henson's (now slightly dated) talk Choosing and Tuning Linux File Systems, for an overview on how to take the right paths and get the most out of filesystems.\nAnyway, to actually answer your question.

But these days we are mostly behind routers and a lot of that danger is mitigated by the router. The danger we face is mostly from within. The proverbial Trojan horse.\nIn Windows world there are a lot of Application Firewalls and OSX has a neat utility called \"Little Snitch\" with does this job of ensuring applications behave by not requesting data outside of their scope. Even my iPhone, jail broken, has an app that prevents applications from accessing web site outside of their scope. Its surprising the amount of data they \"push\" to web sites like scorecard.com and a variety of apple servers. I disable these and the applications still work so I know its not necessary.\nIn Linux world there seems to be little in this vein. You can kludge it with iptables and some other scripts in perl to get the result in a very clumsy way.\nTake this post which is frequently referenced when a question like this is asked.\nHow to control internet access for each program?\nIt doesn't answer the question.\nThey talk about firewalls that totally cut of a port which is not what most people want. All most people want is that application X which should be a local app doesn't go out and chat to the web when it has no need to chat to the web. Or a program that access yahoo weather goes to five other sites not related to its job of accessing the weather. Or in my one of my banking apps on iPhone goes outside of the bank to a webtrends web site. Sure its not related to Ubuntu but is an example of Apps behaving badly.\nThe other app referred to in this post is Leopard Flower which hasn't been updated in a year and I'd hate to keep that running with the up coming release of Ubuntu.\nAll other posts related to this area keep making recommendations for apps that totally cut off access for an application but don't provide that simple \"Little Snitch\" idea of App X wants to access Web Y, Allow or Deny access. No complicated iptable rules, no total port cut offs.\nHave I looked hard enough or is there simply no \"Application Firewall\" for Ubuntu?\n\nA: AppArmor\nAppArmor is a Linux Security Module implementation of name-based access controls. AppArmor confines individual programs to a set of listed files and posix 1003.1e draft capabilities. \nbelow link.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/AppArmor\n\nA: SE Linux is one example of application level firewall for Linux but its quite hard to implement it as its very thorough.\n\nA: I don't know what you find so bad about apparmor. Of course, it requires a bit of reading man pages. But other than that, I find it easy to use.\nI have used personal (i.e. app) firewalls in the past, when I was still using Windows (at work). I don't find apparmor in any way lacking, except for the lack of a GUI. In turn, however, it provides additional security features - you can't prevent a DoS attack by a program which just eats up resources with a personal firewall for Windows, while you can do so with apparmor.\nBesides, it has nice diag and management tools - look up aa-unconfined and all other aa-* commands (you need to install apparmor-utils first).\nYou will see that even with the minimal configuration you get when installing a default Ubuntu system you are still pretty well protected. This has a lot to do with the setuid mechanism and several low level operations requiring privileges on Linux - most apps don't ever access the network directly.\nAside, from that, look up Tomoyo. It's not yet as mature as apparmor or SELinux, but I think it's worth a shot.\n\nA: May I suggest you to have a look to my app http://douaneapp.com/.\nIt is an application firewall, limiting the network access per application.\nFeel free to send me comments and feedbacks.\n", "Q: What is the recommended widget toolkit for Ubuntu desktop? As I understand it, Qt - C++ and QML - or HTML5 are recommended for writing Ubuntu for Phones applications.\nAlso, correct me if I'm wrong, but Python is the preferred language for Ubuntu Desktop. Does this mean Python 3?\nHowever, I can't find any documentation stating what widget toolkit, GTK+ or Qt, is preferred. Additionally, what version/generation of these is recommended? I don't know anything about recent Qt versions, but I know that GTK+2 and GTK+3 are distinct and different to code for. Am I to assume that if the preferred toolkit is GTK+, we're talking about GTK+3?\nThis page states that PyGTK is recommended. However, I can't tell what exactly this entails - does it mean that Python is recommended, GTK+ is recommended, or both, using PyGTK for GTK+ bindings?\n\nA: The future:\nNothing has officially been declared. However, Canonical is pursuing a convergent strategy for its Ubuntu OS.  This suggests that in the future its SDK which uses the QML language (javascript like) and Qt toolkit will end up being the preferred choices for multiplatform development. The SDK should allow one application to scale to many form factors. It's also significant to note that Mir, the new compositing window manager they are developing will have Qt bindings by default.\nCurrently:\nAs things currently stand, development on the desktop is supported by almost any language and toolkit you'd like. However, Canonical recommends GTK+ 3.0 and python2.7 for beginners (despite old docs saying pygtk, it's really pygi - also known as python with gobject introspection).  The default python in Ubuntu is 2.7 not 3.0.  They have created a tool for developers called \"quickly\" that allows you to easily design, code, package and distribute your app. By default apps depend on pygi (GTK3) and the user interface is designed with Glade.\nOne thing you might notice with GTK3 and pyGI is that there aren't a lot of good documentation for it yet.  Here is a palce to get started, but it's missing a lot of stuff. I find that I can translate many of the C++ Gtk docs and the seed docs into the appropriate functions in python by some experimentation. Often if I can find out how to do it with the old pygtk, it's not too different in the newer pyGI.  Finally, you can always post to AskUbuntu or StackOverflow for help from the community.\nFinally, ubuntu has some specific APIs to interact with Unity.  Check out the developer resources page for more info.\n\nA: What I understand is that both are recomended, GTK+ and python, using PyGTK for bindings. GTK+ is still the main toolkit used in the unity interface, python is a very easy and powerfull language, and integration with unity is also easy with python. \n\nA: The Ubuntu SDK is recommanded if you want to target the Ubuntu platform. If not, write your software in any language of your choice.\n\nA: Ubuntu now recommends ubuntu toolkit . It is based on qt quick2 . The apps written in this toolkit will support all the ubuntu devices . Python and GTK will be available for desktop specific applications\n", "Q: Adjust timeout settings on ubuntu backup (dejadup) I use deja-dup front-end (default backup application in Ubuntu since 12.04 or so?) to execute a remote backup.

Thanks!\n\nA: Currently it is not possible to directly configure custom duplicity arguments in deja-dup.

It's just a few infrared LEDs spaced to the ends of the bar, and powered through the long cable that connects to the Wii. The actual \"sensor\" part is in the Wiimote itself, which connects to the Wii (or your computer) via Bluetooth.\nIt may be that the thing you're using works a bit differently, as it seems to include devices for keyboard, mouse, and joystick input, and thus may need drivers that aren't written or available for Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Best way to record VNC session (VLC screencast)?

Is this the lack of interest of developers, not to update their latest release on ubuntu software centre? or something else?\n\nA: The default Repositories included with Ubuntu are maintained by Canonical and a few third-parties. They have to first evaluate all software and updates before they are allowed.\nHowever that's why there are PPA Repositories that you can subscribe to. Most software developers maintain a PPA so users can get the latest updates as soon as they're available. You can usually find the PPA for a program by checking the Developer's webpage. Alternatively you can search http://Launchpad.net for a specific software. \nSome developers don't provide a PPA however, and that's when you'll have to manually download the DEB install file each time there's an update and install from that.\nWorst case, some devs only develop for Linux in general and you'll have to download a ZIP or TAR.GZ archive that contains install scripts or even just a self contained program for you to run.\n", "Q: System requirements for Ubuntu touch?

I am have some doubts in partition my external drive.\nI am have external drive of capacity 2TB formatted in NTFS . 1.5 TB is used in hard drive.\nI want to create one partition of 200 GB in FAT . But I don't want to format my drive . And I don't have system capacity to backup all of my 1.5 TB data . \nI was wondering is there any way to create a FAT partition on my External HDD in Ubuntu without formatting and losing  data from hard drive.\n\nA: You can use Gparted (available in the Ubuntu Software Centre) to resize the 2TB down in 200GB and format those 200GB as FAT.\nThat process does not require you to format the previous NTFS partition, but its always a risk. There is no 100% safe process for that and a backup of your data is always the most responsible thing to do.\nInstructions on how to install and use Gparted are here: How to resize partitions?\nJust open the program, locate your hard disk, right click on the partition and select resize/move, give it some room on the right up to the amount you need and create a new partition on the new free space. After you applied the changes you will have 2 partitions on your disk: the old one containing your data, and a new formatted 200GB FAT32 partition.\n\nA: FWIW, it's a pretty low risk - in many years of partitioning drives, I have never lost data when 'using as directed' (eg, don't cancel the operation part way through because it's slow).   So, if you use GParted, and don't cancel in the middle or have a power outage, you're 99.9% likely to be fine.   But, as Bruno says, there is always some risk.   If your data is really that precious, you'll need to back it up; you should do so anyway - hard drives do fail from time to time.   (Personally, I'd say mechanical failure of a drive is more likely than failure in partitioning.)\nThat's the downside of big drives, eh?

Drivers are tightly coupled to the kernel because they run in kernel space and use internal kernel interfaces.  Applications are a different ballgame and use the syscall interface, which is the userland to kernel interface, and that interface is extremely stable.\nGreg Kroah-Hartman has posted a great article about this subject here.\n\nA: Based on personal experience, the new kernel drops in a completely new directory of drivers/modules and does not try to figure out what drivers/modules can be copied from the old directories into the new ones.\nIt could be that you could copy the old driver/module into the new directory, but there isn't (to my knowledge) a good way of automatically determining compatibility between the kernel versions for the driver.\nI think it may be possible to create a package that has scripts that automatically run on kernel changes to rebuild the drivers so you don't have to, but it doesn't sound like that is happening for the particular drivers you're using.\nAnd that is not uncommon because it is a pain to write installation/upgrade scripts for every operating system/video driver combination and get them tested.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10 bootloader doesn't start windows 7 I just installed ubuntu 11.10 alongside with Windows 7. \nUbuntu starts and work fine.\nInstead, when i click on the last option:\nwindows 7 (loader) (on /dev/sda1)\n\nthe bootloader reload itself and doesn't start windows 7!\nSo now i can only use ubuntu!\nFor me ubuntu is good etc, but i like also to use windows if possible... can you help me?\nHere's my Boot Info Script: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5655022/\n\nA: In ubuntu open a terminal and run \nsudo update-grub\nThe system should regenerate all bootable kernels and chain loading boot partitions\nA word of note, it is very possible that grub is fine but the Wondow boot sector is broken.

As explained here, the 1st iteration of top -b returns the percentages since boot, we therefore need at least two iterations (-n 2) to get the current percentage. To speed things up, you can set the delay between iterations to 0.01. top splits CPU usage between user, system processes and nice processes, we want the sum of the three. Finally, you grep the line containing the CPU percentages and then use gawk to sum user, system and nice processes:\n    top -bn 2 -d 0.01 | grep '^%Cpu' | tail -n 1 | gawk '{print $2+$4+$6}'\n        -----  ------   -----------    ---------   ----------------------\n          |      |           |             |             |------> add the values\n          |      |           |             |--> keep only the 2nd iteration\n          |      |           |----------------> keep only the CPU use lines\n          |      |----------------------------> set the delay between runs\n          |-----------------------------------> run twice in batch mode\n\n\nA: Use -n2.

Add the configuration paramaters you need.\n\nA: I was having trouble with a bootable usb drive that I had installed YUMI on. It would only mount as read-only. I decided to trash all the data on the usb drive and start over. If you have data that you want to keep from your usb drive, BACK IT UP first.\nFirst I tried using the Ubuntu \"Disks\" gui utility that is available with Ubuntu 12.10. I was getting the same error when trying to format the usb drive, \"udisks-error-quark, 0\". Turns out the usb drive needs to be repartitioned, not just reformatted. I was able to successfully resolve the issue (using gui only) by doing the following:\nInstall gparted from the Ubuntu Software Center & run. gparted first showed me the partitions on my hard drive, /dev/sda.  To show my usb drive, in the menu, I went to \nGparted -> devices -> /dev/sdc\n(could be /dev/sdb or another depending on how many devices you have plugged in, if you have multiple hard drives, or other usb drives or an iphone mounted the last letter will be different. You need to be sure that you know what the device name is of the usb drive that you want to partition or you'll erase something unintentionally)\nwhen I did that, it showed my usb drive's partition, in my case being 3.73 GB and having only 1 partition, versus my hard drive being device /dev/sda with 74.53 GB and having 3 partitions labelled \"ext4\", \"extended\", and \"linux-swap\".\nAfter I had my usb drive selected, I right-clicked in the partition area of Gparted and selected \"delete\" and the partition area turned grey and was marked \"unallocated\". I right-clicked again in the grey area and selected \"New\". I allowed the default maximum size and changed the default filesystem type from \"ext2\" to \"fat32\" and I entered a label name for the new partition on my usb drive.\n(You could also use an ntfs filesystem. To decide which filesystem to use on your usb drive, google ntfs fat32 usb drive. Read some forum posts that come up in the results. There are advantages and disadvantes to each, whether it is playing nice with windows or a mac, or loading large media files.)\nThen I verified one more time that I had my usb drive selected to perform the partition operation and not my hard drive or some other device! The device selector on the top right hand side of the gparted window showed /dev/sdc. Yours may be different.\nThen I clicked the green check mark at the top of the gparted window that will \"Apply All Operations\" \nIf everything goes well, you'll get a popup saying that all operations were performed successfully. If you get a message about the device being used by another program, then \"eject\" the drive by right clicking on it's icon in the unity task bar and selecting \"eject\". Then remove and reinsert the usb drive. On gparted menu go to \nGparted -> Refresh Devices and you should be able to select the usb drive again. You may have to tell it that you want to create a new partition again with the options you inputted before. Then try clicking the green check mark button again to partition.\nOnce it has been partitioned, try using your file manager to copy a file to it and see if it works. Should be fine! No need to use the Disk tool to format.\n", "Q: Install on Second Hard Drive with startup boot option? In theory, what I want to do is very simple, but I've done some google research and read some posts on this site and I'm still confused. \nI want to keep win7 on my primary C:\\ drive, and install Ubuntu (12.10) on a secondary drive (that I have yet to buy or install. I just want to be certain that I'm successful when I do this). If at all possible I'd also like it if when I start the computer I have the option to boot either Win7 or Ubuntu, like an account log in type thing where I just pick which drive I'm running with that day. And just to reiterate, I do not want to partition my C:\\ drive or alter, change, or affect my Win7 system in any way.\nThe reason I'm still fairly uncertain about all of this, is that a lot of the guides I've read have been for earlier versions of Ubuntu. Also the vast majority of guides are about partitioning one drive to fit both OS'. I want two separate OS running from two separate drives that I can pick at boot. The guides I did find mentioned that there is some issue with the grub being installed on C:\\ but the rest of the OS being installed on the other drive. Is this still the case? How do I avoid that?\nAlso, if it helps, I've been running 12.04lts on my laptop for a few months now in and out of class and I love it.\nFinally, if you could please point me to a guide or write your answer in the form of a guide for a two year old that'd be awesome. I'm still an Ubuntu novice and I don't want to mess up my win7.\n\nA: How it works\nEach partitioned disk contain one small block called MBR. It resides at the beginning of the disk. \nNow, the OS inserts their code to MBR to load their own bootloader.\nWindows does same, Linux does same. \nThey insert a small code pointing to actual location of bootloader. Like in Linux, This MBR contains Stage1 of GRUB (GRUB is a bootloader used in Linux) which loads a larger executable Stage2 that may located in other partition. \nIf you install Windows, and then Linux, GRUB Stage1 sits in MBR. Now other part of GRUB (the actual bootloader) contains the Windows bootloader location. Now when you select Windows from GRUB menu, Windows starts to load. This is called chain loading (GRUB loads first, then GRUB loads the Windows bootloader based on selection).\nComing back to your question\nIn your case, you have two MBR (because you have 2 hard disks).\nTherefore, you have two options:\nEasiest Option\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a partition on 2nd disk. \n\n*Install Ubuntu on that partition & install GRUB on 2nd disk's MBR not on first disk's MBR. Be careful here. See below image (just for demo purpose), you need to do everything in (probably) sdb. \n\n*You select your already created sdb partition, edit, assign mount point /, and file system type ext4\n\n*Select boot loader location as sdb , not sda (see red colored section)\n \n\n\n*\n\n*Once done, reboot and you will be booted to Windows 7. \n\n\nIt happens because, your boot disk priority says to boot from first hard disk (Where we didn't change anything).\nSo open BIOS, change boot disk priority so that the disk containing Ubuntu comes first.\n\n\n*\n\n*This time, GRUB will be loaded. And you can boot either OS.\n\n*Remove the disk, Windows 7 will boot directly. \n\n*Again plugin the 2nd disk, verify boot order from BIOS so that 2nd disk comes first. You can now boot any OS again.\nAnother Option\nYou can modify Windows bootloader also to load Ubuntu from 2nd disk. It is a bit harder, and since you don't want to touch Windows 7 at all, I am not recommending it.\nNote: All tutorials available here talks about adding Ubuntu from same disk but different partition. I have not done it for across devices, you may need to adopt accordingly. \nHere is a tough guide to do so.\nThere is a great GUI tool to edit boot loader called EasyBCD (It is free for personal use). Their guide about setting up Ubuntu using Windows bootloader. \nYou can have more resource on it Easy BCD Help: Dual boot Win7 and Ubuntu 11.10 -- \"Add new Entry\" for Ubuntu\nI strongly recommend using GRUB as bootloader, as it is more flexible. May be you can set Windows as default boot option AND/OR reduce timeout value.\n\nA: Easiest way to do this is as suggested above.  First, temporarily remove your first hard drive (the one with Windows on it).  Second, install Linux to the second hard drive (which for now is the only one connected).  Third, put your first hard drive back in, so that you now have two hard drives installed, each with its own OS.  From there, it's a simple matter of pressing a key at boot to select your boot drive.  For example, with a Dell machine you'd push the F12 key at boot, and this would bring up your menu to select the drive you want to boot from.\n\nA: I probably do it the backwards way but I use the boot menu to boot to Lubuntu (F12 on this System MB) When I installed Lubuntu I dis connected all other drives in the system. Then I installed the grub on the Lubuntu drive. Windows can't see the Lubuntu drive, but Lubuntu can see the windows drive so I can access files on other drives in the system.  \n\nA: Disconnect your first drive with the Win 7 on it. That way you will be safe. Your computer probably has a boot selector function in it. Take a look in the setup and see that it is enabled.\n", "Q: I can't save my vim file?

This is due to the limitations in the legacy MSDOS partition table system managed by fdisk and why one should use GPT.\nFortunately, LVM also understands plain devices without a partition table. This has the drawback that you'll have to use the whole device as physical volume, but that's exactly what I want to achieve.\nTo erase the current partition table execute the following command (Warning: this effectively erases all contents on the disk!):\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=PhysicalVolume bs=512 count=1\n\nreplacing PhysicalVolume with your device path, e.g. /dev/sdb. Then run\nsudo partprobe\n\nto let the kernel re-read the new now non-existing partition table.\nNow actually format it as an LVM physical volume:\nsudo pvcreate PhysicalVolume\n\n(again, replace PhysicalVolume with your device path)\nThis is based on the information mentioned in the manpage of pvcreate:\nDESCRIPTION\n       pvcreate initializes PhysicalVolume for later use by the Logical Volume\n       Manager  (LVM).   Each  PhysicalVolume  can  be a disk partition, whole\n       disk, meta device, or loopback file.   For  DOS  disk  partitions,  the\n       partition  id  should  be  set  to 0x8e using fdisk(8), cfdisk(8), or a\n       equivalent.  For whole disk devices only the partition  table  must  be\n       erased, which will effectively destroy all data on that disk.  This can\n       be done by zeroing the first sector with:\n\n       dd if=/dev/zero of=PhysicalVolume bs=512 count=1\n\n\nA: FWIW, GPT fdisk (gdisk, sgdisk, and cgdisk) can convert from MBR to GPT, with certain caveats about where partitions are placed. Learning about GPT will be necessary sooner or later, so you might as well do it now. Using the whole disk as a PV also works, but it has drawbacks of its own. Most importantly, a disk utility that's unfamiliar with LVM could misbehave when it sees a \"raw\" PV instead of a partition table. This could have unknown consequences in the future.\n\nA: You can use gdisk for partitions bigger than 2TB.\nExample:\n# gdisk /dev/xvdk\nGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 0.8.6\n\nPartition table scan:   \n  MBR: not present          \n  BSD: not present       \n  APM: not present                                         \n  GPT: not present                \n\nCreating new GPT entries.\n\nCommand (? for help): n  \n\nPartition number (1-128, default 1):     \n\nFirst sector (34-12582911966, default = 2048) or {+-}size{KMGTP}: \n\nLast sector (2048-12582911966, default = 12582911966) or {+-}size{KMGTP}: \n\nCurrent type is 'Linux filesystem'\n\nHex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = 8300): 8e00\n\nChanged type of partition to 'Linux LVM'\n\nThat will create LVM partition that will occupy all space on given physical volume.\nCredit goes to nixCraft:\nLinux Creating a Partition Size Larger Than 2TB\n\nA: This is quite easy using gparted.  You can set the partition table as a few different types.  GPT will allow you to create partitions greater than 2TB\n", "Q: what's alternative hjsplit software for ubuntu?

We will install Maple and create symlinks to the executables.\nThis may also help troubleshooting installation of maple 16 under ubuntu 12.10.\nInstallation\nFirst, create a directory in /opt for Maple.

If you do, remember to use the appropriate path for the rest of the commands in this guide.\nsudo mkdir -p /opt/maple9.5\n\nNow, put your Maple 9.5 or Maple 10 cd into your cdrom. It should then be mounted to /media/cdrom. Maple includes a nice installer script for us that we can run:\nsudo sh /media/cdrom/installMapleLinuxSU\n\nWe have to run the installer through sh since cdrom's are mounted noexec by default. \nFollow the instructions in the Maple installer and choose /opt/maple9.5 as the install directory. \nSymbolic Links\nNow so that we can just type maple to start Maple or xmaple to start the graphical version, we need to create symbolic links somewhere in your $PATH. We will be using /usr/local/bin which is reserved for local installations:\nsudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin\nsudo ln -s /opt/maple9.5/bin/{x,}maple /usr/local/bin\n\nsource here together with troubleshooting in case anything goes wrong.\n", "Q: How do I remotely reboot my computer if I have an encrypted HDD I have set up our new server at work to have an encrypted HDD.  At start up it asks for our password before booting.  Great.  Except it has just dawned on me that we ssh in to the server all the time.  What if I need to restart the machine remotely or the power goes out over the weekend.\nIs there a way around this?  I would still like to have the entire disk encrypted. \nThanks\n\nA: There is no safe way around this.\nEither you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter the password automatically. Thus negating the security.\n\n*Or you manually enter it at boot. \n\n*Or you manually enter it after booting a small unencrypted partition.\n\n\nThe last allows you to boot a minimal system into which you can SSH and then manually mount the partitions with protected data, but it also weakens the security because people can compromise this unencrypted part and wait for you to enter the encryption password.\nIf your server is equipped with a remote management feature (E.g. Dells DRAC, HP ILO etc) and that is on a secure network then you can also consider using that to remotely grab the console and enter the password (A sort of remote option 2).  That assumes you trust the remote management features and network.\n\nA: Yes, there is a way around this, see Takkat's comment. You need dropbear and busybox in initramfs so that you can ssh into machine and enter password. See above link for details.\n(your /boot partition is unencrypted anyway, I suppose)\n", "Q: how to get the correct partition to boot I have just installed Ubuntu into one of two 60GB partitions on my hard disc.  I think it is sda2 and that the other partition (sda1) contains a failed installation of Ubuntu.  Sda2 is further divided into sda6 (59GB) and sda5 (swap space), so can I conclude that the working copy of Ubuntu is in sda2?  The disk utility tells me that sda1 is not mounted and bootable, and sda6 is mounted at / but the partition flag just says “-“.  How can I delete the failed installation and ensure that I can still boot,  please?\n\nA: I suspect you have this setup:\n1 HDD, partitioned with the MBR scheme:  \n\nSDA1: A primary partition (containing your failed installation)  \nSDA2: An **extended** partition, containing two volumes:  \n      SDA5 (1 GB, swap)\n      SDA6 (59 GB)\nSDA3: not used.\nSDA4: not used.\n\n(Drives partitioned with the MBR schema can only have up to 4 primary partitions. One of those can be an extended partition which basically says 'turn the page, look at the next list for more partitions whose data does not fit in the primary part).\nIf this is the case you should be able to set partition 6 to active.\nYou do that with:\nfdisk /dev/sda a 6\nNote that there should only be one single active partition at the time. If sda1 is also marked active then you either have to manually remove this flag. You toggle it in the same way as you did with partition 6.  From fdisk type a 1  (Active, partition number to change). \nHowever, start with fdisk -l (fdisk, list all partitions) or with fdisk /dev/sda p (fdisk on /dev/sda, then print partition table) to verify that the partition layout is as I assumed.  \nExample output from the VM I just tested with: (sda1 is active in this example).\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *        2048    16779263     8388608   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2        16779264    20971519     2096128   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\n\nA: To change which partition will be bootable from terminal:\n(I'm not sure does it works that way if you have EFI boot)\nsudo sfdisk -AX /dev/sdY\n\nwhere X is partition number you want to boot from,\nand Y is disk number. \nTo get know your partitions and disks type\nsudo sfdisk -l\n\nor\nsudo fdisk -l\n\n", "Q: How can I export books from Ubuntu to Amazon Kindle? I have tried the Amazon Kindle HD 7\", but could not integrate it at all with my Ubuntu 12.04 LTS OS.\nI have tried the USB cable but it didn't show up on the screen and I have tried to connect it via Bluetooth, but it also didn't work.\nI have Calibre installed on my Ubuntu, but could not integrate it/export books to Kindle.\nI have also tried to use Ubuntu One, but Amazon has its own cloud system.\nDoes anyone of you have any solution for these problems?\nThanks very much!  \n\nA: send them via email to your kindle account. Calibre has an option for that. If you are unfamiliar every kindle has a unique email that you can send documents to.,\n\nA: You may try installing SendToKindle program written in python. \nFirst install python setup tools:\nsudo apt-get install python-setuptools\n\nThen follow instructions on github repository:\nhttps://github.com/miracle2k/sendtokindle#installation\nAfter installation you should be able to send any file via right mouse click.\n", "Q: Recover From Crashed Session Occasionally, my laptop dumps me out to a blank screen with an 'hid' error, indicating a problem with the mouse driver.\nShort of actually fixing the underlying cause, which I have tried to do, how can I recover from this, and get back to, or start a new GUI session?\nI know I can hit CTRL-ALT-F1 and get to a terminal prompt and log in.   But what do I do from there?  I tried entering init 3, and then init 5, but that doesn't get me to a login screen.\nI hate rebooting and losing everything.\n\nA: To restart the X session, it's as simple as running:\nsudo restart lightdm\n\nIt's slightly odd that it's not doing that for you. It certainly used to but I guess the transition to lightdm and upstart have left it a little less bullet-proof than before.\nIf that moans about not being able to find a running job, just run sudo start lightdm instead.\n\nTo be clear, once X dies, you lose everything from your graphical session.

After I created a folder for installation files and started the whole process I suddenly realized that I don't even have enough disk space. After few seconds the system became very slow, so I closed the running applications and hit reboot. Well, after rebooting I faced the problem I wrote in the title. No response for hitting Esc button, but Ctrl+Alt+F1 worked, so I rebooted again and switched to recovery mode, where I used dpkg and clean, even went to root and deleted a couple of files, for example the Adobe Reader install file and the folder installation files, because I thought after making some space on my hdd and rebooting, there will be no problems.

Using the default driver in ubuntu 12.04 for the Canon ImageRunner Advance C2020i (or iR Adv C2020i) results in black and white only printing. Using the drivers on the canon website prints dummy text or doesn't do anything. I tried different drivers, models and URI (socket and lpd) and it did not resolve the problem.\nThe printer is hence unusable for color printing.\n\nA: Using the default Ubuntu 12.04 driver for the C2550 works perfectly and does not require to install any other software or driver. Color printing works.\nFull driver name: Canon imageRunner C2550 Foomatic/pxlcolor\n\nA: I know your question is quite old. I struggled with the same problem. I tried every driver/combination and only greyscale printing...... \nIt turned out that the C2020i printer itself was set to greyscale printing only. The windows driver can override this option, the linux drivers not.\nAfter setting this option on the printer to automatic, Linux printing in color works like a charm with the printer driver from the topic above (Canon imageRunner C2550 Foomatic/pxlcolor). I bet the provided drivers from Canon also work but I didn't tested this.\n\nA: I confirm. I had the same problem in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with the Canon C2225i printer.

I use four different keyboard layouts and three of them look too similar; it becomes confusing in practice.\n\n\nIn fact, one of these (ro_cedilla) is almost identical to US English keyboard, with only a few special shortkeys for Romanian special characters (but which makes me prefer it to the normal English layout) and I want it for writing in English and general use of the computer.\nI would like it to appear named as us, en, or something like that. \nCan I edit the tray entry ro for this layout?\n(It is not clear to me what the 'edit' command  in the properties  of the panel applet (second image) really does: when selecting an installed layout and clicking 'edit', it opens the options to add new layout, not to edit the one selected.)\n\nA: The panel applet, xfce4-xkb-plugin relies on several files in  /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules such as evdev.lst and evdev.xml. You can't edit any of these files with the plugin (even if running it with gksudo, which is not recommended). You are correct when you say the 'edit' button just allows you to replace the selected layout, but not edit the title of the layout.\nOn the official site for xfce4-xkb-plugin, in any other available documentation, and in the source code, there seems to be no hidden options. The documentation does mention about it not handling other xkb options that well (and you are limited to a small number of options), so if you plan to make use of a lot of the available xkb options you might need to use the setxkbmap utility so you can have a more powerful tool to specify multiple options for layouts.\nYou could of course construct a custom xkb layout, although that is maybe too much if you only want to edit the titles of the layouts, and a discussion of that is probably beyond the remit of the question. However, for more on xkb and custom layouts, see the official xkb documentation.\n\nSo, it's definitely not possible to edit the layout names using xfce4-xkb-plugin itself.\n", "Q: python2.7: not found: Unable to install or remove any packages I am currently unable to install any packages.

The login screen uses dual monitor mode (as seen on the first picture), but the lock screen (CTRL + ALT + L) uses only a single monitor and disables the other (as in the second image). Is there a way to change that? I want the lock screen to extend to both monitors, if possible.\nMy OS is Ubuntu 12.04. Video card is \"NVIDIA Corporation G98 [GeForce 8400 GS] (rev a1)\", and System Settings tab \"Details\" shows \"Driver\" as \"unknown\".\nLogin screen using multi monitor mode:\n\nLock screen using only a single monitor:\n\n\nA: When the screen locks, it really has no reason to display on both screens although I can see why you would want the second screen to display something. The lock screen function and login screen are programmed separately, so they will behave differently. The only thing you can do is go to Launchpad.net and find Ubuntu. Then, report this as a bug/idea. Canonical is great about considering suggestions. Include a link in the report to this page so they can see your pictures.\n", "Q: Unofficial/Local repositories and how do they differ from PPAs in Launchpad I normally tend to use the PPAs (Personal Package Archives) found in launchpad.net, but I have noticed more and more that some repositories are being created in other places or a website that manages packages in a similar fashion like launchpad.\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is an official repository and an unofficial one (Local Repository), including the ones created outside of Launchpad.\n\n*How do repositories created outside of Launchpad compare to the ones found inside of it in terms of first, security, followed by any other features that both offer.\n\n*How do official software repositories differ from the ones created by 3rd party PPAs in Launchpad or outside of it.\n\nA: If you boil this back to the simplest terms:\n\nWhat is an official repository and an unofficial one (Local Repository), including the ones created outside of Launchpad.\n\nAn official repository is one published as part of Ubuntu, managed by Canonical and Ubuntu MOTUs.\nThey currently consist of main, restricted, universe, multiverse, partner, extras and some exist in multiple \"states\" (-proposed, -updates, -backports, etc).\nThe repo names might change in time but the point is that these are .\nOn mirrors: The contents (MD5 hashes of files, etc) of the repository are signed with the Ubuntu key so even if you're pulling the official files from a non-official mirror, you can be fairly certain that they are the original files.\n\n\nHow do repositories created outside of Launchpad compare to the ones found inside of it in terms of first, security, followed by any other features that both offer.\n\nYou can't implicitly compare security levels between a Launchpad PPA and another non-official repo hosted elsewhere. It all boils down to how much you trust the person running the repo.\nThe difference is with a Launchpad PPA, you can see the person who is packaging things. Most times you can see the source. In other repos (eg: dl.google.com or repo.steampowered.com) you likely know neither.\nTrust is an odd thing.\nFeature-wise a repo is just a particular structure of directories and files, hosted on the web. The only special features I've ever seen are authentication to allow only people who have purchased software to download it but this very basic web server security and hardly special :)\n\n\nHow do official software repositories differ from the ones created by 3rd party PPAs in Launchpad or outside of it.\n\nThis is perhaps the biggest of the questions and it's probably best answered (if indirectly) by another question: How to get my software into Ubuntu?\nOfficial repo software is supposed to have a development process behind it. Levels of testing that ensure quality and an amount of peer review. PPA maintainers can encourage this sort of process but it's not something you can assume. Some are better than others.\n\nA: Only archive.ubuntu.com and security.ubuntu.com (and its mirrors) are offical repositories. Anything else, including PPA is not. Every PPA and 3rd party repo is different, you can't compare them in general. e.g. I have 2 PPA's: one that provides things that Ubuntu doesn't, and one with packages where I make different packaging decisions than Ubuntu. Not comparable :)\n", "Q: upgrade MySQL through apt not effect?

I recently bought an EPSON Workforce WF-3540, which I'm using under Ubuntu 12.10 with the official driver provided by EPSON. I am often printing batches of about a hundred pages, duplex. When I'm doing this, after about 20 pages, I regularly get an error message on the printer screen, telling me the printer encountered unknown error 0xFA, forcing me to turn the printer off and back on.\nI talked to EPSON about the problem, but they claim they're not supporting Linux and tell me to ask the Linux community about the problem (and possibly another driver?). So this is what I'm doing here... any ideas?\nUnfortunately, the documentation does not contain any information pertaining to error code 0xFA and the support hotline wasn't able to give me further information, either.\nBTW, the problem hasn't happened, so far, when I'm printing smaller batches or not using duplex. Whenever the problem happens, there's a page in the printer that's already been printed on one side, so I'm suspecting the problem's connected with the duplexer.\n\nA: I, too had this error code come up when I was printing several 2-sided pages.  I opened up the back and sure enough, there was a paper jam.  Turned printer off, pulled out paper, and turned printer back on.  Problem fixed!  Too bad the screen didn't just read \"paper jam.\"  That would have saved me a lot of time!\n\nA: I just encountered the same error code and after letting the printer sit a few minutes while off, the screen said there was a paper jam once restarted. Restarting it quickly just gave me the same error code. I cleared the jam and the printer \"adjusted itself\" for about a minute. Seems to working fine after printing another 30+ duplex prints. -AL\n", "Q: How can I set up poclbm (a bitcoin miner)? I'm trying to set up poclbm on my 12.10 machine.

If you're doing a graphic install just select the option to replace Windows instead of Install Ubuntu side by side or do a manual partitioning and format Window's partition and write Ubuntu on it.\n\nAlternatively, if you are dealing with sensitive data, there are a wide range of software to erase and write over files so they are beyond-recovery. You can also consider checking the Full Disk Encryption option when installing 12.10\n\nA: If you click 'Clean Install' in the install selection, it will remove Windows 8 and all that comes with it.\nI hope you enjoy Ubuntu!\n\nA: Yes in order to install Ubuntu it will have to change the file type on the hard drive from NTFS to Ext4. This will require formatting the hard drive, and thus removing everything that has existed before that.\nI would recommend that if there is any data that you want to keep do back it up before installing Ubuntu or you will never see it again!\n\nA: Yes, as previous 2 says, different partition type will remove \"everything\". If you want to be sure absolutely no data stays on your hard drive, use for example this guide https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GraphicalInstall and option \"Erase disk and install Ubuntu\" in Installation type option.

Just what the title says. The update manager is also asking me to update to Ubuntu 12.10 even when I have the part unchecked that says \"Check for new Ubuntu version updates\" thing. Is there some way to turn the annoying update manager off?\n\nA: That's because apt-get upgrade does not install new packages.\nDue to the way the kernel packages are built, every new (bugfix) version of the package actually has a different name. Plus you install a metapackage, which will always depend on the latest kernel.\nThis has as a sideeffect, that updating the metapackage for the kernel always requires a new package to be installed (the new kernel), which update-manager will happily do for you.\napt-get upgrade however will strictly upgrade packages, and will not install new packages. If you run apt-get upgrade, you will see that the kernel metapackage is being held back (for this reason, though it doesn't give you the reason).\nSo instead of apt-get upgrade, run apt-get dist-upgrade to update the kernel metapackage and install the latest kernel version.\n\nA: In my last login to Ubuntu Server, I suggest to use do-release-upgrade.\nThis may help any version to upgrade to the last version.\n", "Q: Lock Hard drive partition using ubuntu password i want to use my ubuntu password , to lock a hard partition with it can i ?!\nuse my password so no one else can acess type of partition\n\nA: The only way to do this is encrypting it, because even if you make Ubuntu ask for a password to access it, anyone can still boot up another operating system Live CD and access it.\nIf you're not that worried than simply creating a good root password is enough, since mounting devices require root password.\nThat's only about accessing the partition. Now about wiping your data there isn't much you can do but preventing your computer to be physically accessed by someone else, since anyone can simply boot up a GParted live CD or a live CD of any other partitioning program or operating system and wipe your hard drive, or just put it on fire or something.\n", "Q: Music play which can convert audio Is there any player using which i can play and (or) convert music?

But now whenever I turn on the computer I get this message: \"error: no such device: cb105e2b-b911-4e52-9dc6-504560332258e. grub rescue>\" regardless of which OS I'm trying to load (the Ubuntu from the external HD or the Windows 7 from the internal).\nI know there are plenty of questions on the same matter, but as I've stated I don't really know what I'm doing, so if I misunderstood what aspects of the answers were applicable to my situation, I could probably really mess something up, and I'd really rather not.\nI don't know what details to include, sorry.\n\nA: This happened, because you probably installed the Ubuntu bootloader (grub) in the MBR of the internal HDD (or its bootable partition), yet the files it requires are installed on the external one. Further, the BIOS does not offer the external drive to the Ubuntu bootloader, so it doesn't find the required files.\nIf the system that was installed on the internal HDD was Windows Vista or 7, follow this guide for fixboot (and if that does not work also fixmbr): http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927392 (there are similar guides for other Windows versions, yet I don't have the links at hand -> keywords for your own google search are fixmbr, fixboot, recovery console and of course your windows version)\nIf you want to use Ubuntu from an external HDD only, without touching the internal HDD, you must make sure, that the bootloader is also installed on the external drive (in that case, after installation you have of course to select the hard drive to want to boot from in BIOS). Somewhen during the install process (probably when partitioning your HDD) you get a drop down list of devices on which you can install Grub. It can of course be the case, that your BIOS does not boot from USB drives, meaning that there is no convenient way to install Ubuntu on an external drive without touching the internal one... I wouldn't be surprised if this really is the case on the computer you're trying to install Ubuntu on, since otherwise I don't see any reason why Grub shouldn't find its files on the external HDD right now...\n", "Q: Is it possible that Leap Motion Controller will work with Ubuntu?

You can run unset http_proxy https_proxy to undo your actions.\nYou should only set a proxy if your PC is actually behind a proxy. If it is, you would already know the proxy details (the hostname and port, and username and password if applicable), and you would therefore replace http://proxy.your.server:port with the appropriate details. \nSince you can access the internet through your browser without configuring a proxy, I think you probably aren't behind one. Therefore, you can just unset the variables as described initially and proceed with the rest of the tutorial.\nNote that web proxies are common in corporate environments, but it's very uncommon for people to configure proxies in their own homes, and hosted servers won't sit behind web proxies. Proxies are normally used to control access to certain categories of websites (e.g. social media or webmail), or to add a local caching layer, or for malware filtering.\n", "Q: Google says sorry in ubuntu 12.10 I have just installed Ubuntu 12.10 and when I attempt to search Google I receive the\nfollowing error message:\n\nWe're sorry...\n... but your computer or network may be sending automated queries. To protect our users, we can't process your request right now.\n\n\n\nA: This can happen when a lot of people share the same external IP. For example, behind campus networks and the like. \nIf this sounds like your situation, then either try waiting a while for the IP to (hopefully) be removed from the blacklist, or use a proxy to access the website. \nIf this doesn't sound like it, i.e. you're using a small home network, then you can try obtaining a new IP address (assuming you have a dynamic IP account with your ISP) by powering down and powering back up your modem - whether it's Cable, ADSL or otherwise.\nIf you're concerned about malware (very unlikely - both because it's uncommon on Linux, and also because it's extremely unlikely any malware would choose to repeatedly hit Google's search page), then you might choose to use a tool like Wireshark to monitor outgoing packets. Or, even better, run Wireshark on another PC on your home network using promiscuous mode. However, like I say, that's extremely likely to be a waste of your time. \n\nA: Many ISPs place you behind a transparent web proxy these days.\nThis has advantages for them (lower interconnect fees) and for you (lower latency and less clogged pipes) but it aggregates all requests for that ISP as if they came from one IP address.\nYou may have fallen foul of the activities of other machines on your ISP network.

I recently purchased G35 Surround Sound headset from Logitech. I would like to enable 7.1 surround sound for it, but haven't been able to find a method that works.

(It's back to stereo now...I don't think I changed anything.) So, what am I missing?\n\nA: The G35 (and G930) are what is known as a virtual 7.1 headset. So Pulseaudio is correctly identifying it as a stereo headset, as it contains only two speakers - left and right.\nUnder windows, the driver does some trickery to make it seem as if the headset is 7.1, but it doesn't actually have the physical speakers.\nSo alas, you're out of luck with this headset.

I noticed when I plug-in or unplug my laptop's AC adapter, the CPU scaling governor changes to ondemand.\nBecause my laptop gets fairly hot, and I do nothing intensive on it, I prefer powersave at all times... and it helps keep my lap cool.\nIs there a way to prevent Xubuntu from automatically changing it to ondemand when I plug/unplug the AC adapter?\nI'm using Xubuntu 12.10 if that's relevant.\n\nA: This is probably a silly pm script that is doing this but I don't know it off the top of my head. If you militantly want to stick to powersave, run the following in a terminal:\nsudo install -b -m 744 <(<<EOF\n#! /bin sh\n\nsleep 5\n\nfor CPUFREQ in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor\ndo\n    [ -f $CPUFREQ ] || continue\n    echo -n powersave > $CPUFREQ\ndone\nEOF) /etc/pm/power.d/99-powersave\n\nThe embedded script there will then run whenever your power situation changes.

This will just set powersave whenever it can.\nIt sleeps for five seconds before running just in case whatever is setting it to ondemand takes a little while to trigger.\n", "Q: Using alias to change ls to ls-l changes(or disables) the colors of ls output I've used alias to change ls to ls -l, but the colours change to the normal font of the terminal (also tried ls -l before the alias command and the colours appeared fine). \nWhat is wrong?\nThank you\n\nA: After searching more, I found about the --color option so I used this: \nalias ls=\"ls -l --color\" and it worked fine!\n", "Q: Can I create a new script and chmod it in one command? When writing answers on here, it's often necessary to create a new script and chmod +x it to make it executable. I won't go into whether this is a good thing or not, but explaining to people that they need to fire in three separate command (and teaching them to use nano!) is a bit of a waffle.\nIs there anything easier?\n\nA: Why yes there is! Let me introduce you to the install command. install is a GNU-standard application that lets you copy files around and specify certain things at the same time. The short syntax is install SOURCE DESTINATION.\nHowever, \"certain things\" are important. You can specify the file mode with -m xxx (755 for writeable by owner and executable by anyone). And bash has a couple of tricks for redirecting new files and here-doc for accepting long-form data. Here's a quick example:\ninstall -b -m 755 /dev/stdin ~/testbin << EOF\n#!/bin/sh\necho \"Success!\"\nEOF \n\nNow you can run ~/testbin and it should echo out.\nYou can combine this with sudo for root-owned files or if you want to write as somebody else, you can sudo and use install's -o owner flag.\nThe -b flag just creates a backup if you run the command a second time. This is helpful if you're doing potentially destructive tasks.\n", "Q: How do you make a program that doesn't need to be installed searchable in the unity dash. (ubuntu 12.10) I've come across this a few times, but I will use a specific example. When I downloaded the ADT bundle from Google it came with programs that just ran without needing to be installed, i.e. I can run Eclipse just by clicking on the eclipse file after I extracted the archived folders to the /home/ADT Bundle directory. There was no need to install anything. The problem is that I like using the Unity dash to quickly search for the programs I want to run and Eclipse doesn't show up. In fact, I can't even search for the eclipse file located in the /home/user-name/ADT Bundle/eclipse directory using the dash to start the program that way. What I'm hoping to learn is how to let the dash know that these folders, files, and/or programs exist on my system so that I can search for them if that is possible. \nWhat I've tried:\nused sudo nautilus to move the folders containing the programs to the /usr/local directory (returned it to the /home directory when this didn't work)\nAdditional information:\nThe dash will not find the folder ADT Bundle located in the /home directory or any file/folder contained within \nrunning ubuntu 12.10\nI installed my home, root, etc as separate logical partitions (don't know if that helps)\n\nA: Short answer:\nYou can add programs to your main menu easily by using a menu editor. The preferred tool is called alacarte, but there are also others. Beware, that you might have to log out and log in again to see any effects. \nLong answer: Ubuntu uses two different application menus. There is a system wide one stored at /usr/share/applications and a per user one in ~/.local/share/applications. The entries in these menus are stored in .desktop files. \nReally long answer: Read man xdg-desktop-menu\n", "Q: How to automatically connect to Home wireless network after waking from a suspension? So after some research, I've found that it's supposed to disconnect from wifi when it's suspended, however what I can't seem to figure out, is why my laptop is automatically connecting to some other network instead of my own when it comes back on after being suspended.  \nI've already had a look at the Network settings, and the Home network is set to connect automatically, the only thing I can see of why it might be choosing this other available network over my Home network, is that this other one is not password protected.  \nAny ideas?\n\nA: You should deselect the network that connects automatically and erase also all the other wireless networks that are memorized in your wireless interface.

You should review any file before posting it online, including logfiles.\n\nA: No. It is not safe to publish your system logs online.

I have been checking the Ubuntu errors page, but in the legend I noticed that both 12.10 and 13.04 are listed twice. Once just Ubuntu 12.10, and another Ubuntu 12.10 (by 12.04 standards).\nSo what classifies an error to be in 12.04 standards and what doesn't?\n\nA: Bugreport explains it:\n\nThis is a special case of the general problem, \"show me errors, in version Y, of types that were also captured in version X\".\nFor a particularly thorny example, imagine that Ubuntu 12.10 reports hangs of 30 seconds or longer, while Ubuntu 13.04 ratchets that down to 10 seconds or longer. On the graph, hangs of over 30 seconds should show up on the \"13.04 by 12.10 standards\" line, while hangs of between 10 and 30 seconds should not.\n\nand\n\nThis is fixed in production. We now have a separate line for \"by 12.04 standards.\" Matthew, you mentioned that we need some way of tracking the usage of recoverable errors, as we don't want its usage growth among developers to add noise to the graph. I've filed bug 1084079 for that.\n\nThere is also bugreport that has an explanation:\n\nError reports collected from Ubuntu 12.04 include application crashes and thread crashes.\nError reports collected from Ubuntu 12.10 include application crashes, thread crashes, and recoverable application errors.\nThis may account for much of the current difference between Ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10 in the http://errors.ubuntu.com/ graph, since the two most common errors currently are recoverable application errors in Ubuntu Software Center.\nThis can be fixed by Ubuntu 12.10 having a \"by 12.04 standards\" dotted line on the graph.\n\n", "Q: Error while upgade While upgrading Ubuntu 12.10 by terminal using sudo apt-get upgrade I get this error\nReading package lists...

I did it once :D\nGRUB is a boot-loader (all OSs have them, Windows' boot loader just auto-boots into Windows) and its files are stored in the same partition as Ubuntu. When you deleted the Ubuntu partition it removed those files.\nSimple fix? Reinstall Ubuntu from USB or the Live CD. This will fix the GRUB files and your system should work again (that's how I fixed my problem.)\nUpgrading Ubuntu should have nothing to do with the Windows, so you can just run the command sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && do-release-upgrade from the terminal.  \nThis will check for any and all updates/upgraded programs and update/upgrade them. \nThe do-release-upgrade command checks to see if there is a new version of Ubuntu (eg. 12.04 to 12.10) and then will allow you to upgrade it.\nAs this is a very common error, there are plenty of questions similar/duplicate of yours.\nHere are a couple duplicates that might help you:\nHow can I repair grub?

(just documenting this - self-answer to follow)\nI am using the stickynotes applet in Ubuntu Natty for notes. I would occasionally like these notes to stay \"always on top\", but I cannot find a setting for anything like that (pic from here): \n\nIs it at all possible to somehow force a stickynotes note to stay always on top?\n\nA: Yup, it is possible - got the answer thanks to this post: Application started in shell automatically \"always on top\" / Desktop / Xfce Forums; one can use wmctrl for that. \nFirst, in terminal, use wmctrl to obtain a listing of currently active windows: \n$ wmctrl -l\n0x01a00003 -1 mypc Bottom Expanded Edge Panel\n0x01a00036 -1 mypc Top Expanded Edge Panel\n0x01200023 -1 mypc x-nautilus-desktop\n0x042000e1  1 mypc Mozilla Firefox\n0x03400024  0 mypc Terminal\n0x032000f2 -1 mypc 2013-03-29\n\nThe \"2013-03-29\" is the title of my stickynotes note window; then one can just run this command, in order to force that particular note window to stay on top: \nwmctrl -i -r 0x032000f2 -b toggle,above\n\nNote the use of -i switch, to \"Interpret window arguments (<WIN>) as a numeric value rather than a string name for the window.\". Also, this toggles the \"always on top\" property for the window; so if you'd like to turn the \"always on top\" off - simply run the same above command again. \nNote that if stickynotes is set up to \"Put notes on all workspaces\"; then the \"always on top\" setting will be valid for all workspaces (although you may have to click through other windows at first, to have the window \"understand\" it should be \"always on top\"). \n", "Q: Locale warning while executing adduser I just tried to add an user to a group\n$ adduser someuser sudo\nperl: warning: Setting locale failed.\nperl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:\n    LANGUAGE = \"en_US:en\",\n    LC_ALL = (unset),\n    LC_PAPER = \"pl_PL.UTF-8\",\n    LC_ADDRESS = \"pl_PL.UTF-8\",\n    LC_MONETARY = \"pl_PL.UTF-8\",\n    LC_NUMERIC = \"pl_PL.UTF-8\",\n    LC_TELEPHONE = \"pl_PL.UTF-8\",\n    LC_IDENTIFICATION = \"pl_PL.UTF-8\",\n    LC_MEASUREMENT = \"pl_PL.UTF-8\",\n    LC_TIME = \"pl_PL.UTF-8\",\n    LC_NAME = \"pl_PL.UTF-8\",\n    LANG = \"en_US.UTF-8\"\n    are supported and installed on your system.\nperl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (\"C\").\nAdding user `someuser' to group `sudo' ...\nAdding user someuser to group sudo\nDone.\n\nWhat does this mean, what went wrong and how to eliminate the error?\n\nA: According to this post on UbuntuForums.org:\n\nYou need to pay attention to your error message and issue a command\n  for your missing locale.\nFor example, this is the error I got:\nCode: \n\nperl: warning: Setting locale failed. perl: warning: \nPlease check that your locale settings:\nLANGUAGE = \"en_CA:en\",  \nLC_ALL = (unset),\nLANG = \"en_CA\"\nare supported and installed on your system. \nperl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (\"C\").\n\n\nThe LANG string is the one you need.\n\nBy the looks of your error message, this should work for you:\nsudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8 pl_PL pl_PL.UTF-8\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure locales\n\nIn retrospect, googling this error message reveals a lot of fixes; but very little in the way of \"why\" or \"how\" it is caused.

This is probably very simple but I'm new to this and struggling my way through it.\n\nA: You'd use a case statement:\nvar=... your menu select code ...\n\ncase \"$var\" in\n    a )\n        script_a ;;\n    b )\n        script_b ;;\n    c )\n        script_c ;;\nesac\n\ntldp.org have a load more examples.\n", "Q: Openbox : launch a maximize application through ob menu I am trying to configure my openbox's menu.xml, and I would like to define a menu entry which launch a maximize application, for example firefox.\n<menu id=\"root-menu\" label=\"OpenBox 3\">\n    <item label=\"firefox\">\n        <action name=\"Execute\">\n            <execute>firefox</execute>\n        </action>\n        <action name=\"Maximize\" />\n    </item>\n</menu>\n\nBut it doesn't work. After some test,  I think that only the first action is execute.\nSomeone have a solution ?\n\nA: Here is a way to open all applications maximized when using the Openbox window manager. (I do not know which distro OP is using and so two slightly different routes are suggested.)\nFor distros other than Lubuntu:\nMake a backup of /etc/xdg/openbox/rc.xml for safety\nOpen /etc/xdg/openbox/rc.xml with a text editor\nGo to the bottom of the file. You should see:\n</applications>\n</openbox_config>\nJust above the line with </applications>, paste the following:\n<application class=\"*\">\n<maximized>yes</maximized>\n</application>\nSave rc.xml\nOpen a terminal and run openbox --reconfigure. This will make Openbox aware of the changes. If not effective, log out and back in. \nFrom now on, all applications will open maximized.\n(Source)\n\nFor Lubuntu 12.10 users, edit ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml instead of /etc/xdg/openbox/rc.xml. (I verified this because I'm using Lubuntu 12.10.)\n\nIf you decide you don't want all applications to open maximized, but just some specific ones, you will need the following code instead of the one above for each application that you want maximized:\n<application class=\"......\"> (See below)\n<maximized>yes</maximized>\n</application>  \n\n\n*\n\n*Note that the way to find out the application class is via xprop.  \n\n*You will need to have a terminal window open as well as a window of the application whose class you need to find.  \n\n*Type xprop _OB_APP_CLASS in the terminal window and press Enter.  \n\n*Notice the cursor will have changed its appearance to cross-hairs.  \n\n*Now, using the mouse, click in the window of the application you need.  \n\n*Then, look back at the output in the terminal. For example, if I run xprop _OB_APP_CLASS and click on a window belonging to Google Chrome, I see: _OB_APP_CLASS(UTF8_STRING) = \"Google-chrome\" and \"Google-chrome\", including the quotes, is exactly what should be typed as the application class.  \n\n*You will need to do this for each application you desire to have open maximized.\n\nOne side-effect of <maximized>yes</maximized> is that not just the primary window but other windows open maximized. For example, in Firefox, pressing Alt > Edit > Preferences or Alt > Help > About will result in maximized panes. The same happens in Chrome's Task Manager (Shift+Esc).  \n\n\nIf such behavior is undesirable, xprop will need to be run for both primary and secondary windows to see if they can be distinguished.\nFor the Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Seamonkey browsers, the following code maximizes only the browser window proper and not \"internal\" windows:\n<application role=\"browser\">\n<maximized>yes</maximized>\n</application> \n", "Q: copying two files using one command Copy two files from the /etc directory.

When launched fingerprint gui says \"No Device Found\".  What linux command do I use to try and find the technical information about my fingerprint scanner.\nThanks\n\nA: Well, it appears that no driver for your fingerprint reader is installed.\nUse the console and type 'lspci' and 'lsusb' to find out the type of fingerprint reader installed (look for 'fingerprint reader' or something similar in both outputs). Following that you can google for a linux driver for this type of reader to find out which package has to be installed. Then the GUI should work as expected.\n\nA: As far as I can tell, the Validity scanners used in dv7 laptops (such as mine) are unsupported by the libfprint drivers.

Hi I've recently switched from Windows 7 to Ubuntu 12.10 and love the OS. However I have had trouble deciding which programming Language would be the all-around best for Ubuntu programming. I have no problem learning a harder language, I already know a good amount of C++ and C#. I really like C# but I've heard it doesn't mix well with Ubuntu. \nWhat would be the best-integrated languages for Ubuntu, and good IDEs for them?\n\nA: @ShockWave: I would say python, via quickly http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/tools/quickly/. Ubuntu provides some pretty neat tools to get you started. c++, via qtCreator, is also a good choice.\n\nA: I have worked with Java and Eclipse (and NetBeans) in Ubuntu quite extensively.  The nice thing about Java, is that it is portable to any platform that can run a JVM (for example: Minecraft runs on Linux, Windows, OSX, XBOX, etc...).\nIf you like C#, you should really check-out Mono.  It is an open source implementation of the .Net framework that will allow you to build C# apps with the MonoDevelop IDE.\nEdit:\n\nI have to run it from inside the IDE. How do I get a stand alone app?\n\nIf you're having trouble getting compiled apps to run, check out this tutorial video: youtube.com/watch?v=KW4G7R6zARs It goes over how to do a quick \"hello world\" app in Mono on Ubuntu. At 3:10, the author shows how to create a launcher to his compiled Mono app.  If you follow his directory paths, you should be able to see where your compiled apps are ending-up.\n\nA: C# programming with via Mono and MonoDevelop, using GTK# for the GUI is excellent. I think you'll find the switch-over from Visual Studio quite simple after a little getting used to. I find that I prefer GTK# to WPF.\n\nA: If you already know C++ then you must already be programming at a lower level and have a better understanding of how to get the most out of the language.  GCC provides a more complete implementation of C++ x11 then most other platforms so I would stick with that; using Eclipse and the C++ plugin.  I would also pick up Python and QML since it shouldn't be too hard for you and they would be useful to know.  Python in Eclipse using pydev is a good system to use and you would have a single tool that provides both languages.\n\nA: I think ubuntu supports wide variety of languages even C#. If you are thinking about building ubuntu apps and like GNOME, I would say vala. You can do this in C as well as C++ and also many other languages but I have heard Vala is similar to C# and much more high level than C or C++. If you need cross platform go for C++ with QT framework or Java. Since python is installed by default and is a very good multipurpose language with many modules, you can go for python as well.\nBy the way, nowadays ubuntu is embracing QT a lot.\n\nA: Python? You could use the gedit text editor. Search 'gedit' in the dash.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: nautilus connect to server - can not reach filesystem root Using Ubuntu-Raring I connect via 'Files/Connect-to-server':\nssh://root@myhost:mysshport/\nconnection works ok, but I am connected to '/root' on the target system and can not reach the filesystem root (I can not do a 'cd /' via the UI)\nHow can I specify my connect string so that the mount point is the filesystem root?\n(Note: when I do the same under Win via Bitvise client I get a selector to chose '/' or '/root' so there does not seem to be a problem on the server side.)\nThanks a lot for any hints!\n\nA: nautilus always connects to the user directory of the server, and I did not figure a way out to connect directly to \"/\" , this is a working workaround.\nIf you specify a Path when connecting,\n\nYou can go back in the filesystem of the Server (or, for me, my iPhone).\nSee that you got the option to go back in the top.\n\nThen you can click on \"[user] on [the server IP]\" (for me, \"root at 192.168.178.22\"), you get then to the root of the Server.\n\nEDIT: I just found out if you cannot see the bar on the top to go back to root, you can press ALT+ArrowUP and you will see it.\nTested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with GNOME nautilus 3.10.1.\n\nA: Another workaround to achieve this goal is that after connecting to the server using root user, press CRTL+L to make nautilus let you change the path, so you can change it to whatever path you desire (In your case you can simply remove /root from it's tail).\n\nA: I don't know a real solution to this.

To do this, boot in recovery mode and enter a root shell (as you did before), then run:\nusermod -a -G sudo username\nMake sure to replace username with your actual username.\nThen, you'll be an administrator again.\n(If that does not work or produces an error, please comment here to briefly explain what happened, and also edit your question to add as much information about what happened as possible.)\nSource: How can I give admin permissions to my account?\nWhen That Doesn't Work\nYou got the error usermod: cannot lock /etc/passwd; try again later.\nusermod is apparently not able to gain proper access to /etc/passwd (the file it must modify), even in recovery mode.\nHopefully, booting directly to a root shell without going through the recovery mode menu will work better. So try \"The Other Way Lucid\" (but run usermod -a -G sudo username instead of passwd username, as before).\nIf that doesn't work, you can try the solution by Oli that Aditya had suggested, with two major caveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can only use those instructions if you know enough about your system to \"change sdYY to your root partition\" as it demands (i.e., if you know the device name for your root partition).\n\n*Don't run sudo adduser your-username admin as it says; instead, run adduser your-username sudo. (Or usermod -a -G your-username.)\nThe important thing is that you add yourself to sudo rather than admin.\n(Feel free to skip this paragraph--it's about style and \"best practices.\")\nBut it's also unnecessary, and in my opinion somewhat poor form, to use sudo to run commands as root, when you're already in a root shell where all your commands run as root. I think this rapidly causes confusion about when one is and isn't in a root shell.\nOr you can use the instructions I wrote here, which explain how to obtain all the necessary information. They're long, but that is because they cover a variety of situations that probably don't apply for you, including not being able to log on to the machine at all, and wanting to reset the password as well as make a user an administrator. They also explain how to do everything without assuming much prior knowledge or experience (for example, they explain in detail how to boot from and access a useful desktop on a live CD).\nYou have another option: Those instructions of mine are really a general presentation the same technique that Oli wrote about more succinctly and more situation-specifically. So, from what I wrote there, here's how to find out what command to use in place of sudo mount /dev/sdYY /mnt/boot # change sdYY to your root partition:\n\nIn your Ubuntu system (not the live CD/DVD/USB system), run this\n  command in the Terminal:\nmount | grep ' on / '\n\nYou should include the spaces before on and after /.\n\nThat command produces something like /dev/sda1 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro,commit=0) as the output. The text before on (not including the space) is the device name of the partition that contains your Ubuntu system's root filesystem. Remember it (or write it down).\nThen, once you've opened the Terminal on the live CD/DVD/USB:\n\nRun this command:\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nReplace /dev/sda1 with the device name of the partition\n  containing your Ubuntu system's root filesystem, if different.\n\nBesides using the device name you found with the technique above, you should also use /mnt and not /mnt/boot as in Oli's answer. But then you can continue on with the instructions there.\n", "Q: What algorithm is used by Disk Utility encryption?

Sublime Text is very customizable, with all the shortcut options in one text file for you to edit. By default, a number of them do not work, mainly because the Alt key escapes the program in Unity.\nI would like to change it so that it works well with Ubuntu, but I thought I'd check if one exists already that someone has made. A quick Google didn't find any.\nThanks\n\nA: Most of the settings and modifications that can be made to Sublime are done via JSON files, and this is true for key bindings. Key bindings are usually OS-specific, which means that three key bindings files will need to be created for your plugin. The files should be named Default (Windows).sublime-keymap, Default (Linux).sublime-keymap and Default (OSX).sublime-keymap.\nPrefixr/\n...\n- Default (Linux).sublime-keymap\n- Default (OSX).sublime-keymap\n- Default (Windows).sublime-keymap\n- Prefixr.py\nThe .sublime-keymap files contain a JSON array that contains JSON objects to specify the key bindings. The JSON objects must contain a keys and command key, and may also contain a args key if the command requires arguments. The hardest part about picking a key binding is to ensure the key binding is not already used. This can be done by going to the Preferences > Key Bindings – Default menu entry and searching for the keybinding you wish to use. Once you’ve found a suitably unused binding, add it to your .sublime-keymap files.\nview plaincopy to clipboardprint?\n[\n    {\n        \"keys\": [\"ctrl+alt+x\"], \"command\": \"prefixr\"\n    }\n]\nNormally the Linux and Windows key bindings are the same. The cmd key on OS Xis specified by the string super in the .sublime-keymap files. When porting a key binding across OSes, it is common for the ctrl key onWindows and Linux to be swapped out for super on OS X. This may not, however, always be the most natural hand movement, so if possible try and test your keybindings out on a real keyboard.\n", "Q: How can I configure the terminator terminal to always be on top?

Shrinking and expanding partition using gparted in old versions of ubuntu was very fast. Moving a partition was the only time-consuming task and the time depend on size of partition.\nIn new versions of ubuntu, gparted seems to take a long time shrinking and expanding partitions. I guess it's because it moves fragmented spaces and moving is very time-consuming, so the overall time of shrinking or expanding a partition is shrinking or expanding time plus time taken in moving fragmented spaces. That is huge if we are expanding or shrinking a big partition.\nTo save time I want to ignore fragmented space. Is there any way to shrink or expand a partition without taking care of small fragmentation using gparted or any other tool? \n\nA: Put simply, no, you can't. GParted needs to clean up the partitions as best it can in order to ensure a safe and successful resize.\nHere is a longer explanation I found on the GParted forums:\n\nThe problem with this is that it requires the file system to be in a definitiely clean state - otherwise, the resize operations (especially shrinking) would destroy data. While this is relatively easy to ensure for the typical Linux file systems (GParted brings the tools required to check and fix them with it on the Live media), it is not so easy for third-parts file systems like NTFS: For these file systems, you often need to boot the \"native\" operating system for these file systems and perform some magic there.\n  In addition to this, even some of the Linux file systems can not be moved this way, since there is no known way to shrink them (jfs / XFS / Reiser4) - and to enlarge them, they need to be mounted, and growing must be done on-line (jfs / XFS). Depending on your machine, this is not a very clever idea - maybe you perform the resize operations on a system with very little RAM (and modern file systems can consume huge amounts of memory).\n\nHope that answers your question.\n\nA: I agree with Benjamin Kaiser's response. I'd like to add two more points, though.\nFirst, you shouldn't be resizing partitions on a regular basis. In addition to being a time-consuming operation, partition resizing is risky. This is especially true if the partition resize involves adjusting the start point of the partition, which requires a great deal of the filesystem's data to be rewritten. A power failure, a bug, a system crash, or some other problem can cause damage to the filesystem that will be difficult or impossible to fix. Thus, you should resize partitions only if doing so is absolutely necessary; and when you do resize partitions, you should be prepared to lose all the data they contain. If that data is irreplaceable, you should make a backup before resizing the partition.\nSecond, if for some reason you need to resize partitions frequently, you should look into logical volume manager (LVM). This enables you to treat filesystems something like files, so that you can add, remove, shrink, and grow them without worrying about start and stop points. This means that you'll never have to adjust a filesystem's start point, thus taking some of the danger out of the process. Unfortunately, Ubuntu's LVM support is weak, especially for desktop editions. LVM is also more complex than using partitions directly, so it'll take some learning, and the complexity can make recovery more difficult should something go wrong. Still, if you need to juggle your partitions a lot, LVM can be a net plus.\n", "Q: Ubuntu won't recognize my video card and shows white screen with unintelligible characters I just installed Ubuntu to run side-by-side with a yet to be activated Window 7 Ultimate.  \nI tried both of the 32-bit version of Ubuntu and both say they don't recognize my video card after the first reboot 12.04 allows me to run in low graphics mode (12.10 allows me to boot, but the screen turns white and has unintelligible characters).

Some more info: \n\n\n*\n\n*I set it to \"Login automatically\" during install.  \n\n*During the install I defined 3 things: Name (First Last), Login (one short string), and Password. \n\n*In the terminal, I can log in, and it asks for 2 things: First Login, then Password. \n\n*When the GUI starts up, it displays my First and Last name (no mention of my Login), and asks for a password. It won't accept the one I've been using. If I switch to the terminal with Ctrl-Alt-F1, I can log in, but when I hit Ctrl-Alt-F7, it's still waiting for a password. It won't accept a blank. The other options, aside from my name, are Guest Session and Remote Login. \n\n*Interesting behavior to note: If enter something wrong, I get a spinning ball of dots, and the message \"Invalid password. Please try again.\" However, if I use the password I've been using in the terminal, it goes black, appears to be moving on, and then returns as it was, asking for password. So this problem seems deeper than a non-recognized password. \n\n*Something else to note, which may/may not be related: If I choose Guest Session, after a few seconds the screen gets corrupted and is unusable. \n\n\nAny ideas? \n\nA: I've seen the effect you see (wrong password => rejection message, correct password => seems to be accepted and then dropped back to beginning), when a program is crashing or returning an error behind the scenes.\nFor instance, once I was debugging an issue seen with both OpenLDAP and Likewise Open when a user was using their networked login id. It turned out the problem was the '\\' used in the login name was not being escaped properly, and that led to a problem in shell script that was called by gdm.\nI've also seen it happen in some Ubuntu releases in beta that had a crash in a supporting login piece.\nI suggest checking your system logs to see if anything is crashing or reporting an error.\n\nA: I worked around this by switching from LightDM to GDM.

I asked here how to make cd protect spaces. Tab completion is great, but sometimes you paste the path from the clipboard so this is useful.\nThe solution breaks with parentheses however. No matter how you try to escape and protect the input it always returns:\nbash: syntax error near unexpected token `('\n\nIs there some way to have it also deal with parentheses? What I want is that when I enter this, it works:\ncd My path with spaces (and parentheses)\n\n\nA: How to correctly cd to directories with characters like spaces and parentheses in their names:\nIf your folder name doesn't include a single-quote character ', just enclose it in single quotes:\ncd 'My path with spaces (and parentheses)'\n\nIf it does include a ', but doesn't  include a double quote character \", a backlash \\, a backquote ` or a dollar $, enclose it in double quotes:\ncd \"My path with spaces (and parentheses)\"\n\nIt's not very common for a file or directory name to contain both single and double quotes. (This is perhaps due to how it's not common for a file or directory name to contain double quotes at all. The only reason I didn't recommend double quotes originally is that, unlike single quotes, double quotes allow the $ to expand environment variables. This would be a problem if your filename contained a $ character followed by text.)\nIf it contains both, or you just want another method, then you can escape each space and parenthesis manually by inserting a backslash character \\ before it:\ncd My\\ path\\ with\\ spaces\\ \\(and parentheses\\)\n\nThat's annoying, but fortunately, the shell with do it for you, if you type the beginning of the name and press Tab. If there is more than one file or directory name that starts with My, then you might need to type some more to get it to expand. If you press Tab and it doesn't expand you can press Tab again to see a list of files that match what you've typed so far. Then you know how much more you must type to get it to match uniquely and expand.\nAlternatively, you could escape the internal quotes. For example, suppose you had a folder called:\nMischa's gardening tips for \"home and office\"\n\nYou can use:\ncd Mischa\\'s\\ gardening\\ tips\\ for\\ \\\"home\\ and\\ office\\\"\n\nBut you can also simply use:\ncd 'Mischa'\\''s gardening tips for \"home and office\"'\n\nBackslashes aren't special inside single quotes, so we terminate the single-quoted string, append a backslash-protected single quote, and immediately start another single-quoted string, all without any space that would start a separate argument.\nWhy you probably cannot make cd work the way you wanted it to:\nAs for getting cd My path with spaces (and parentheses) to work: no, you really cannot do that, because this behavior is not specific to the cd command, it is part of the way running any command works. When a command is run, it is give a list of arguments provided by the user. When the shell sees a space, it knows one argument has just ended and another has just begun. To pass a space as part of an argument it must be quoted in one of the above ways.\nYou could achieve part of this some of the time--you could make cd My path with spaces work to go into the My path with spaces folder. You could achieve this by writing a shell script that concatenates all its user-provided arguments with spaces. (Then if you wanted you could make cd itself call that script, by creating a shell alias named cd for it; that would take precedence over the shell builtin cd which you currently are ordinarily running.) But:\n\n\n*\n\n*The script would not receive different arguments for My  path with spaces and My path with spaces, so cd My  path with spaces would fail or enter the wrong folder.\n\n*You could not do this for the parentheses, because these are used for grouping by the shell such that they are not communicated in any way to a command. Actually, most of the time the shell will simply throw a syntax error (just as you have seen):\nek@Kip:~$ cd My path with spaces (and parentheses)\nbash: syntax error near unexpected token `('\n\nNo matter what you change, that syntax error will continue to occur when that command is given.\nI say that you \"probably\" cannot make this work because there is one way that will--you can make your own shell that behaves as you wish. But this is extremely difficult and it's unlikely that anyone would want to do that, just to make this change. (You could also modify the source code of an existing shell, which is a more practical solution but still requires more effort than most people would want to exert.) Besides that, it's unlikely that cd can accept directory names with arbitrary characters including spaces in them, like it does on Windows.\nIn case you're wondering why this works on Windows but not in Ubuntu: In Windows, commands are passed the text typed after them as a string of text, and when a command needs to interpret that string as a sequence of separate arguments (which it usually, but not always, does), the code for the command must call a special library function that parses the command-line string. (In a C program, this happens behind the scenes, but still involves using the Windows API.)\n\nA: Use single quotes ' around the argument. (This works for any command, not just cd).\ncd 'My path with spaces (and parentheses)'\n\nYou can't make bash pass the parentheses to cd. Getting the spaces to work at all is a very specialized hack.\nSingle quotes work around every character except ' itself. Replace single quotes by the 4-character sequence '\\''.\ncd 'Apostrophe'\\''s a pain'\n\nThis doesn't work if the directory name begins with a hyphen, because that causes the cd command to interpret the argument as an option. Pass -- before the directory name to avoid this.\nSee https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/69144/how-do-i-escape-a-sub-directory-name-with-an-ampersand-in-it/69147#69147 for more details.\nAnother method is to have the shell read a separate line of text instead of passing the argument on the command line.\nStrapakowsky@darkstar ~$ read -r; cd -- \"$REPLY\"\nMy path with spaces (and parentheses)\nStrapakowsky@darkstar ~/My path with spaces (and parentheses)$ \n\nRather than copy-paste manually, you might as well do it programmatically.

UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) was simply developed to ease some configurations done with iptables.\nRemoving it will not affect your iptables configuration.\nTo disable UFW you can type the following:\nsudo ufw disable\n\nTo remove it you can type the following:\nsudo apt-get remove ufw\n\nTo purge it (In those cases where you really hate ufw or wasting space) you can type the following:\nsudo apt-get purge ufw\n\nThe only thing you can not do is remove iptables. This is because it is a dependency package of ufw, therefore ufw depends on iptables (Not the other way around ^^).\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu 12.04 server with RAID1? I have spent the last 4 days or so trying to setup Ubuntu server 12.04.2 with RAID1. I have looked at several different links and tried different configurations and workarounds. So far, I have not come out with a successful installation that passes the final test -- pulling out one drive, booting and checking the contents of my home folder, and doing the same for the other drive.\nSo far, the closest I have come to succeeding is by setting up partitions this way:\n/dev/sda1: allocated for RAID\n/dev/sda2: swap area\n/dev/sdb1: allocated for RAID\n/dev/sdb2: swap area (or left unassigned -- which somehow gets allocated as a swap area later on anyway)\n/dev/md0: (paired sda1 and sdb1) RAID1 device, ext4 filesystem, mount point /\n\nThis installs successfully, I boot the system, then create a file called \"test\" on my home folder.\nI then shut down, disconnect drive b, power up, and check my home folder. \"test\" is there...so far so good. Then I create a second file, \"test2.\"\nI shut down, reconnect drive b, power up, and check the folder. Both files are there.\nI shut down, disconnect drive a, power up and check the folder. Both files are ABSENT from drive b.\nIf anyone has any ideas on how I can successfully set this up and get my RAID1 working, I will be very grateful and happy.\nOh yes...I've tried setups with 3 partitions instead of 2, with EFI Boot and/or biosgrub, with no success (Either it would not boot, or I encounter the same situation with the test results above)\nThanks.\n\nA: After more research, trial and error, and one phone call to a friend, I finally got this to work.\nApparently, there is something wrong with the Ubuntu Installer's partition manager -- so I had to use GParted (http://gparted.sourceforge.net/) to partition the disk BEFORE running the installer.\nI setup 2 partitions with gparted (ext4 and swap), then ran the Ubuntu installer, set up raid, and everything went on smoothly.\nWhen I ran the test (pulling out one drive), the test file I wrote still existed on the second drive and that proved my raid installation worked.\nJust a note: when I plug the other drive back in, it does NOT automatically sync back. I have to re-add it to the raid array by:\nsudo mdadm --add /dev/md0 /dev/sdb1\n\n(replace md0 with the actual raid array name and sdb1 with the actual hard drive name)\nA very helpful resource for this is the Mdadm Cheat Sheet (http://www.ducea.com/2009/03/08/mdadm-cheat-sheet/)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10, I installed seahorse utils for encryption, but now 'Passwords And Keys' won't open Ubuntu 12.10, I can open 'Passwords And Keys' app, but then when I install the seahorse plugins, I can no longer open 'Passwords And Keys' -- when I click on the menu item/icon, nothing happens.

I'm getting so frustrated by Linux that I'm ready to go back to Windows.\nIt worked this afternoon.\nIt worked up until I downloaded whatever this latest update is. If I knew how to tell you what the update was, I'd paste it here.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my HP laptop, the wireless stopped working after an update. I think all I did to fix it was install the driver again because in the update they stop supporting most broadcom drivers, so you need to revert back to an older version. I'm not sure if this is any help, but it is what I concluded after 5 hours of searching the web trying to fix my internet connection. Try searching in google your device model number (broadcom BCM5787M). And make sure if you're using wireless, download the wireless driver, not the Ethernet driver.\nIf you don't have to update the drivers, search for a key that disables/enables the wireless on your device, the update might have switched it off, so a simple press of the key may help.\nIf all else fails, you can either continue to search the web for an answer, or just reinstall ubuntu and don't update everything, just update a few things (don't ask how, because I don't know) and that may help.\n", "Q: Turned on the automatic login & now the password doesn't works. Also having problem with keyboard input \n*\n\n*I am new to Ubuntu. I own a Samsung series 5 notebook. I installed Ubuntu today only & I was checking the options in User Accounts. I switched on the Automatic Login option and the password was disabled. Now when I try to change anything on my Ubuntu it asks for a password and when I enter my old password it says that authentication failed. I didn't change the password, I had just disabled it. What is my new password then?\n\n*I am facing another problem. I installed Steam software from Ubuntu Software Centre and when I run it from desktop it asks for a password but I can't enter anything there. My keyboard stops working at that point.\n\n*To fix problem 1 I tried this method. I booted my Ubuntu in recovery mode and selected root option. Then I typed 'mount -rw -o remount /' and then 'passwd myusername' and then it asks me to enter new password but my Keyboard stops working at this point. Keyboard stops working only when I enter password. It doesn't takes any input at all. Only the 'Enter' key works. Keyboard works fine when password option goes.\nPls help.\n\nA: What you may not realise, is that when the terminal prompts for a password, it does not echo the input, so it looks like it isn't working (when it actually is!). So run the same process again and hit enter and whatever you typed before you hit enter will have been entered. This is for security issues I am guessing (terminal logs?).\nAs for the password not working when opening steam, just click the cancel button if entering text doesn't work (I believe I have had this issue from time to time, but it is rare) and try opening steam from the terminal. If this problem persists open a new question about it.\nIf my answer helped and solved your main question (in the title) then please mark it as correct.

How can I create a shared repository on a server if I only have access using sftp://?\nAs a workaround, I could create the shared repository locally and then I could copy it to the server. \nIn any case, can Bazaar use a remote shared repository in dumb server mode? Let's say I do this:\nbzr init-repo /tmp/repo\nrsync -a /tmp/repo server:/tmp/\ncd /path/to/a/branch\nbzr push sftp://server/tmp/repo/branch1\nbzr push sftp://server/tmp/repo/branch2\n\nWill the first push store its revisions in the shared repo, so that the second push will run very fast, since it doesn't need to store any new revisions?\n\nA: bzr init-repo sftp://server/tmp/repo\nrsyncing it up should also work.\nYes if you push two branches into the same repository then they revisions will be stored in the repo and will not need to be pushed again (unless you hit a re-pack which happens from time to time and that will cause it to be uploaded again).\nSo sftp can be slow with big branches. If you see that it is too slow, you can try out bzr+ssh:// which requires bazaar to be installed on the server.

My network is somewhat simple: all PCs in my LAN  (Ubuntu desktop, Win7 desktop, XP netbook) connected to a dlink home router, which is connected to ISP's cable modem. LAN has IP subnet 10.10.10.0/24, gateway (the dlink router) is 10.10.10.1, the PCs are 10.10.10.100-120, via DHCP. The PCs share folders among themselves (basic right-click -> share, this is samba, right?). So far, so good.\nNow the Ubuntu desktop has VirtualBox. I was planning on installing sandboxed VMs to test malware (and monitor the way they \"call home\"). So I installed an Ubuntu VM, network set to NAT mode (the default mode, subnet 10.0.2.0/24 I guess).\nSo I open up Nautilus in the VM, go to \"network\", and to my surprise... the VM is able to see all the shared folder in the host's LAN!!!\nHow? Isn't \"Shared Folders\" something that works on the LAN only? How come a VM that lives in another subnet can access, say, a shared folder in the Win7 machine? They are not in the same LAN! (that would be Virtualbox's \"Bridged\" mode, correct?). And no, I do not mean VirtualBox's \"Share Folder\" feature (that maps a host drive as a network share to the guest), I'm not using it.\nSo, I clearly lack some fundamental knowledge of how shared folders and NAT works.I assumed NAT would isolate the VM from my LAN while still being able to browse the internet. I am very surprised it was able to see my LAN's workgroups even being in a different subnet.\nSo, question is: How is that possible? How this relation between VirtualBox, Shared Folders and NAT works? And how to setup the VM so it can't see the guest's LAN but is still able to browse the internet?\n\nA: Chapter 6. Virtual networking:\n\nTo an application on the host, or to another computer on the same network as the host, it looks like the data was sent by the VirtualBox application on the host, using an IP address belonging to the host. VirtualBox listens for replies to the packages sent, and repacks and resends them to the guest machine on its private network.\n\nNetworking in VirtualBox (Oracle Blogs):\n\nEach vm thinks they are on their own isolated network. When they send their traffic via the gateway (10.0.2.2) VirtualBox rewrites the packets to make them appear as though they originated from the Host, rather than the Guest (running inside the Host).\n\nLike on a physical host, NAT impedes remote connections, but allows outgoing connections. I don't think there's a networking mode that can distinguish your LAN from the rest of Internet.\n\nA: Just a shot in the dark, you did say the ubuntu guest is 10.0.2.0/24. The 24 would put them on the same subnet no? 255.255.255.0\n", "Q: Files disappearing from internal NTFS hard drive I am using Ubuntu 12.04 with the Xubuntu Desktop package installed and am having problems with an internal NTFS hard drive.\nEntire directories seem to be emptied without warning or going to the waste basket. This has been happening for at least a couple of months; I first noticed a problem when music files weren't being read into the library by Rhythmbox but assumed it was a Rhythmbox problem.\nI've now noticed that a directory with nearly 500GB of files/sub-directories has been emptied. The strange thing, however, is that the drive isn't showing an increase in the amount of free space it has - as though the files are still there.\nWhen doing an ls of the specific folder that seems to be emptied, I receive an input/output error, but can ls the root of the drive fine.\nI don't have Windows installed on this machine either, and most of the other related questions seem to be related to dual booting Windows.\nAny ideas on the cause of the problem and how to fix it?\n\nA: Couple weeks ago in my windows OS I had similar problems which sounded like a hard drive failure in your case. I ran a program that checks for these kind of things.\nDidn't know what was causing the problem as my windows os would freeze up after 5mins particularly when I would open certain programs. Then I heard massive clicking from it which was a sign of death. After much research I found a program called Hard Drive Regenerator, your friendly pirate should know where to get it; just burn the iso once he gives it to you. Life saver works with all kinds of partitions and takes an hour or so to scan for bad sectors and close to a day if all sectors need to be remapped and deleted.\nThe bad sectors were spreading like a virus, so the program remapped them into a part of the hard drive where the bad sectors are failed when hard drives are developed. I'd run that to check for any physical problems. Also I did backup my files before running it, you can leave it, but reccomends saving your files. I had 1537 512 byte sectors causing my hard drive to click and pc to freeze. After running that my hard drive passed the SMART test.\n\nA: Sounds like a problem I'm currently coping with myself. I have an external NTFS formatted HDD and I was getting the same symptoms as you. Input/Output errors all over the place and entire folders of files just disappearing. After weeks of diagnosing and attempted repairs I have been forced to recover what data I can and reformat the drive. I suspect the issue lies with Linux's hacked together support for NTFS(since Microsoft won't provide the code for proper support), but I can't check that until I've finished recovering my 1TB of data to my numerous small HDDs and other storages, and then Reformat the drive to see of the drive itself is bad or if it really was the fault of Ubuntu.\nIn the end my best advice is to assume the worst and start backing up all the data you can. Also switch the drive to Read-Only so you can make sure nothing new gets written to the drive further increasing the problems. After you've finished backing up you can A) attempt repairing the drive using NTFS repair tools, or B) try Reformatting it to something other than NTFS(I'd recommend Ext3 if it's primarily Linux used).\nSorry I can't help more.\n", "Q: How to wildcard tesseract?

How are symlinks implemented? Are references stored on both sides or only in the location where the symlink is pointing from?\nStory: I have a weird \"bug\" in the folder view of Sublime. A folder that contains files is shown as empty, but there are files in there not starting with a dot. But there is a symlink from another location to this folder. That is the only thing I can think of right now that could be the reason why it shows as empty?\nUPDATE: seems it might be related somehow to this (and therefore, related to inodes): http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=7142&start=10. I tried the config setting that is mentioned there in the last post, but it did not have any effect.\nThat is: Preferences > Settings -- User:\n\"ignore_inodes\": true\n\n\nA: Symlinks can be bidirectional, if they are \"hard\" symlinks. However, in general symlinks are unidirectional, and the information about the link is only stored in the symlink itself. Your problem is probably not related to symlinks at all.\nSee here for more information: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link\n\nA: A symlink is implemented as a file pointer that points to a certain path.\nIt exists at the source only and creating a symlink causes no change to the destination.  It's also possible for a symlink to be invalid - to point to a path that doesn't exist or can't be reached.\nI can't see how an incoming symlink to a directory could cause any issues in that directory.\nYour issue may be one of\n\n\n*\n\n*Issue with Sublime (I assume you mean the text editor Sublime Text)\n\n*Permissions issue - can the user you're using to view see the directory entries?\n\nA: \n\"The symlink() function shall create a symbolic link called path2 that\n  contains the string pointed to by path1 ( path2 is the name of the\n  symbolic link created, path1 is the string contained in the symbolic\n  link).\nThe string pointed to by path1 shall be treated only as a character\n  string and shall not be validated as a pathname.\nIf the symlink() function fails for any reason other than [EIO], any\n  file named by path2 shall be unaffected.\"\n  Source - Symlink man page\n\nFrom this a symlink is merely another name for a named path to either a file or a folder. In other words they only point one way. Have you tried creating more symlinks to confirm that it's causing the problem?\nOtherwise this might be an issue with Sublime in combination with your OS. If you create other files they show up correctly? Also, what types of files are they? Have you made sure that you have added their folder to the sidebar?\nCheers,\nNils\n\nA: This is related to symlinks, but it is a bug in Sublime Text.\nIf you have opened a folder in Sublime where there is a subfolder with symlinks to another folder in the same sub structure, the original folder will show as empty. This is probably related to the GOTO command to avoid duplicates.\nIf you open the folder directly or open a parent folder without symlinks pointing to the apparently empty folder in the tree, the folder content will show.\nSee http://sublimetext.userecho.com/topic/89047-symlinked-folders-arent-displayed-properly-in-the-sidebar/, I guess the issue is not fixed\n", "Q: How do I install plesk from downloaded file in Ubuntu Its simple really, I would like to be able to run the auto installer I have downloaded from here: http://www.parallels.com/download/plesk/10/\nI downloaded parallels_installer_v3.12.0_build120601.16_os_Ubuntu_10.04_i386 for my Ubuntu 10.4 32-bit.\nI have added to folder path /plesk/parallels_installer_v3.12.0_build120601.16_os_Ubuntu_10.04_i386 but when i run: `/plesk/parallels_installer_v3.12.0_build120601.16_os_Ubuntu_10.04_i386' in the terminal nothing happens?\nClearly I have no idea how this should be installed...

Before deleting imagemagick and it's entire toolset from software-center most of my image programs were displaying like this image. Now for the most part it's just blurry, though a couple still display like that such as gimp. I am running in xfce maybe it's to do with the distribution enviornment. Main issue is the absurd blurriness. I reinstalled all additional packages that were available for imagemagick in the software-center\nI use convert *.pdf *.png & mogrify -format png *.pdf to convert\nNow on the other hand if I converted the file to djvu and converted that to a tif. The images have no problem converting. More so it does not generate an oversized tif file of around 25mb compared to 3mb with djvu which is super clear & no blurriness. \n\nA: Try using the density variable.\nconvert -density 400 *.pdf *.png\n\n\nA: I'll plagiarize the answer I just posted to a related question.\nIt can be very complicated to get good pdf output from convert.

As mhc noted, you will have to use ccsm, as explained in comment above, and refer to this askubuntu answer.\n\nYou don't need to add anything to the .desktop file, just edit the config file in your home folder.\nFind $HOME/.config/gummi/gummi.cfg and set the dimensions to your screen size and it will launch maximised. The dimensions will vary according to your maximum resolution; for example they could be 1280x1024, 1920x1080, etc. \nHere is the original section in $HOME/.config/gummi/gummi.cfg.\n[Global]\nconfig_version = 0.6.1\nmainwindow_x = 244\nmainwindow_y = 233\nmainwindow_w = 792\nmainwindow_h = 558\n\nAs an example, I would change 792 and 558 to 1280 and 1024, so that it would launch maximised next time. Edit the file and then relaunch gummi. Whatever you put in will be adjusted by the program when it launches, so don't worry about specifying the exact values. \nIf you mess up the configuration file, just delete it and it will be respawned when gummi launches.\n\nYou could also use devilspie, which is in the repositories.\nsudo apt-get install devilspie\n\nNow create a ~/.devilspie folder if it doesn't already exist, and create a profile for gummi, so that when gummi runs, it will trigger devilspie to maximise the window. Name the file gummi.ds and place this in it:\n; gummi maximise\n\n(if (is (window_class) \"Gummi\") (maximize) )\n\nHowever, devilspie must be added to startup applications, as it needs to be running.\nIt is worth trying devilspie as it is a very useful application for manipulating chosen windows, but may not work if you are running compiz.\n", "Q: Just installed CouchDB, permission error Just installed CouchDB 1.2.0 via apt-get.

Can anyone tell me how to add a drop shadow effect in Gimp. I have seen it in a number of designs.\nEXAMPLES:\n\nand\n\n\nA: Creating a drop shadow on the inside of text.\nCreate a new image (I chose 800 by 600), choose a background pattern (I chose pine) and write the words GIMP in big bold letters and in white.\n\nSelect the text layer, right click it and choose 'layer to image size'. Then select the color select tool and click on the white text to select it. Then invert the selection by going to the 'select'->'invert' menu.\n\nOpen up the drop shadow dialogue under 'Filters'->'Light and Shadow'->'Drop Shadow'. In the dialogue, you can tweak the settings to your liking. I'm just going to use the default ones and click OK.\n\nThe result:\n\nStill keeping the selection intact, open up the drop shadow dialogue again and this time choose 0 for both the Offset X and Offset Y fields, and double what you chose earlier for the Blur Radius field - mine will be 30 - and press OK. See screenshot below:\n\nThe result:\n\nStill retaining the selection. choose 'Image'->'Fit canvas to selection' To cut off the overflowing shadows outside the image.\nAfter that we just turn off the selection in 'Select'->'None' and flatten the image by right clicking on any layer and choosing 'flatten image'.\nThe final result:\n\n\nA: Making a drop shadow is quite simple in gimp, but is a bit tricky sometimes.\nFirst make a selection, this will be the area where your drop-shadow will be made.\n\nI'm going to fill my selection with red.\n\nNow, go to in the menu -> Filters -> Light and Shadow -> Drop Shadow...\n\nThat will open this dialogue:\n\nThere are many options, X and Y change the distance from the object the shadow is left/right and up/down, the values go positive and negative. Play around with them to your liking or purpose.\nThe default values make a drop shadow like this:\n\nMaybe not exact to what you want, so playing around with the values, we can come up with something nice.\n\n\nIf we want to get more advanced we can add a layer mask to the drop shadow layer and mask off only the bottom part of the shadow (or erase the rest with the eraser if you want).\n\nOr If you feel skilled with the paint brush you can paint a shadow from scratch as show below:\n\nAnd in mixing techniques you can come up with convincing shadows for your design:\n \n\nA: To add a drop shadow to text in GIMP:\nRight-click the text layer, select \"Discard Text Information\". \nThis rasterizes the layer into a normal layer with transparency.

When I plug in my headphones the speakers AND the headphones play sound at the same time. The speakers should stop playing and send all sound to the headphones. How can I configure the sound that when I connect my headphones the speakers in the laptop are muted and the sound only comes out to the headphones.\nI should mention that this model provides 2 audio output connections in the front (Not just one like most laptops).\nHere is an image of how the Sound Settings looks: \n\nThanks!\n\nA: I would first check to see if Ubuntu is detecting both (Headphones and Speakers) in the system settings:\n\nIf you see something like one the following images, then you know both were detected:\n\n\nIn my case I have support for my headphones and my stereo output. If in one case I would like to disable sound for the speaker, I would first select the output I want to disable and then disable the option (Marked by the green circle). This way sound will not come out of that output connection. The same goes for input devices. Here is another image of how 12.10 looks. Notice that I have both, the Speakers connection (Analog Output) and the Headphones:\n\nThe same case applies here. You select the device you want to mute and click on the mute button.\nFor cases where this options do not show or sound is still coming from the speakers when you have your headphones connected then follow this steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type in dash terminal or ter for short and press Enter\n\n\n*In the terminal type alsamixer and press Enter\n\n \n\n*Inside the alsa mixer app, using your arrow keys, move left or right to any of the options that will show in your mixer window. Pressing up or down you can adjust the volume for that specific connection or pressing M you can mute the connection. What you will be doing here is looking for the one that mutes your speakers but leaves your headphones still with sound.\nNow for your case, it seems your headphones are not getting detected correctly. The only option your computer shows is \"Speakers\" which are the internal ones. When you connect the headphones, the sound comes out of both (Speakers and Headphones) because it thinks they are the same. If you have already upgraded Ubuntu I would suggest to see what the command dmesg outputs. Type dmesg on a terminal and see if there is anything related to sound.\nUPDATE: After looking at your dmesg and other information (Provided by Mr Jeeblez himself) and seeing that you have the Intel 5 Series/3400 Series Chipset High Definition Audio, searching I found a bug report that was made for said motherboard. You can find the bug report in \nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/alsa-driver/+bug/580233\nThe solution was to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the terminal type: sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\n\n*At the end of the file paste the following:\nalias snd-card-0 snd-hda-intel  \noptions snd-hda-intel model=dell-m4-1 enable_msi=1\n\n\n*Save and Reboot.\nNOTE: If this does not work, change in the second line the part about:  \nmodel=dell-m4-1 --> model=hp-m4.\n\nA: I had the same problem on a System 76. It worked properly in 12.04, not in 12.10. I tried all these settings, but it never worked properly.\nIt works in Ubuntu 13.04 without me having to do anything.\n\nA: The question is pretty old, but I've run into the same problem on Acer Swift 3 SF314-56 with newly installed Ubuntu 20.04. It turns out, that for some reason, the Auto-Mute Mode property was disabled by default in the alsamixer.\nI've fixed it in the following way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type alsamixer and press Enter in the terminal to open the mixer \n\n*Change the \"Auto-Mute Mode\" from Disabled to Enabled\n\nNow you have to save this config, otherwise it will be lost after reboot. There is  already an answered question (Howto save AlsaMixer settings?) on how to do that, so you might want to check it out first, as those answers seem more correct, but they didn't work for me, so I've done the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that you set the auto-mute value to enabled in the\nprevious steps\n\n*Save current config by typing alsactl --file ~/.config/asound.state store in the terminal\n\n*Now we have to find a way to load a config by calling a alsactl --file /home/<your_user_name>/.config/asound.state restore command at each startup. Seems like it should be possible by placing this command into the /etc/rc.local, but it haven't worked for me. So what I've done is found the Startup Applications Preferences in the Ubuntu preferences, and added this line as a new startup command.\n\n\nP.S. My default alsa config file (/var/lib/alsa/asound.state in my case, you can check the location on your system with man alsactl) already had the \"Enabled\" value of the Auto-Mute Mode property. So maybe alsa didn't read this config for some reason, and more proper way to fix this problem would be to find the reason why this default config is not invoked.\n", "Q: static ip no internet So I followed these steps to get static ip and lost connection\nsudo -s\nnano /etc/network/interfaces\n\nchanged\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nto same as above with\nauto eth-d\niface eth0 inet static\naddress etc\n\nthen reset networking\n\nA: Your file is misconfigured, try something like this:\nauto lo eth0\niface lo inet loopback\niface eth0 inet static\n        address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx(enter your ip here)\n        netmask xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\n        gateway xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx(enter gateway ip here,usually the address of the router)\n        DNS xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\n\nThen:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to restart the networking service?\n", "Q: No effective root I wanted to login as a user, but when I typed in login usr (usr is just a placeholder for the user name) the system returned: \nlogin: Cannot possibly work without effective root. \n\nHow can I fix this? \n\nA: You can make the login command succeed by running it as root (as the error message says).\nYou can run login username as root by using sudo:\nsudo login username\nUnless you've very recently run a command with sudo in the shell you're already in, you'll first be prompted to enter your password as an administrator who is able to run commands as root with sudo.\nThen the login command will run, it will prompt for username's password, and if the password is successfully entered, you'll get a login as username.\nHowever, you probably do not need a real login as username:\n\n\n*\n\n*To start a login shell as username, run:\nsudo -i -u username\nThis requires no authentication except for the initial sudo authentication (when you enter your password, not username's password).

Now, however, I have decided to make Lubuntu my permanent OS on this machine, my only gripe being that the default Desktop Environment isn't exactly the most pleasant to look at...\nI understand that this is partly because of the fact that it is so lightweight, and my Netbook might struggle with some of the effects in full desktop OSes...

In some ways we talk about it as a separate, derivative distribution, but really, it's just Ubuntu with different packages installed.\nYou may want to try the Xfce desktop environment, which is lighter-weight than GNOME (whether GNOME with Unity or GNOME with GNOME Shell). Xfce uses more resources than LXDE, but you may find it runs well on your machine. I recommend trying it. Unless you're very low on disk space, installing it shouldn't cause any problems, and you can always decide not to use it if you don't like it.\nThe best way to install Xfce on Ubuntu (or Lubuntu, or any other derivative) is usually to install the xubuntu-desktop  package.\nYou can do that in the Lubuntu Software Center (which you may or may not have, depending on what version of Lubuntu you installed), or the Synaptic package manager (which you should have if you don't have a Software Center). Or run this command in an LXTerminal (Ctrl+Alt+T):\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\nThen log out, and on the login screen, you can select Xubuntu as your session type.\nFor information on using Xfce in Ubuntu, see the Xubuntu website.\n\nA: Try cinammon 2d out it looks the same as the 3d one.

IS there a way? Or am I forced to dual boot until my T530 is out of warranty?I know there are great makers out there that build machines to run Ubuntu.But.I have thinkpads dating back to 1999 and all run Ubuntu flawlessly.I want to keep with tradition.I have been a loyal Ubuntuer since Lucid.And have never turned back. I simply detest windows,so any help would be greatly appreciated.Thank you! And thank you for The GREAT O.S.\nVince.\n\nA: Some jurisdictions will enable you to get a refund for the Window you are not using.\nAside from this, some manufacturers can be a bit of a problem in terms of support. Their support telephone operator scripts, etc, depend on Windows to work. Some will deny you support on the grounds that you installed an OS other than that supplied (although I'd be surprised if Lenovo was one of these).\nThat said, the T530 is certified \"Enabled for Ubuntu\" \nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/certification/hardware/201205-11132/\nIntel graphics controllers work well in Linux, as their drivers are both written by the manufacturer, and open-source as well.\n\nA: I got a lenovo laptop as well. What you are going to have to do is keep a copy of the windows CD Key and a copy of the D:\\ or E:\\ drive you might have which contains copies of all the drivers you have. Also note the type of windows installation, pro, home regular, home premium, etc.\nIf you ever need to send it back since you did a sector by sector copy of it or kept the partition they can't say u deleted anything. Just make sure to install windows before you send it in, this would mean grabbing an iso from a torrent site; but you wouldn't need to apply a crack b/c the cd key should check out.\nAlso in regards to their warrenty you should know that lenovo does not to backups meaning they wipe your drive if anything goes wrong. What they do is refurbish it and just send you a new model. \n\nA: You can remove Windows and install Ubuntu instead of it, but it's highly probably that you'll lose your warrany (you can ask customer support about that to make sure).\nAlso, please note that HDD has limitation of 4 primary partitions which could be used by pre-installed software like backup partitions, etc.\n\nA: I have been using ubuntu from the start and I have been using thinkpads since 1998.  Lenovo will give you hardware support even if you wipe your windows.  There is a tonne of support for software issues on the web.  The hardware is well supported on ubuntu with the only issue that I have ever had being hibernate is a hit or miss.  I always wipe windows and do not keep a copy of the partions and lenovo support has never given me a hard time.  When I have to send it in for repair I normally pull the harddrive out but not always.  My thinking is, if the keyboard or monitor etc is broken, they do not need my hard drive to fix it.  This has never been an issue.  If you send it in for repair there is a form that you complete and you con give them permission or deny them permission on restore your hard drive.  My T61 video card just bit the dust and I will probably purchase a T530 today and I am not worried about being able to install ubuntu or get support from lenovo.\n", "Q: Will the alpha/beta ISO become official after Release? I am moving to use a Alpha/Beta ISO and I am wondering will it become stable after official release or will I need a new iso?\n\nA: The beta ISO image will always be beta, because it contains a snapshot of packages that existed at a particular time, and Ubuntu 13.04 was beta at that time. (It is also beta now, as you know, though it will be released soon.)\nAny version of Ubuntu can contain bugs but development versions (alphas and betas) are expected to have more bugs than released, stable versions. It's possible for a bug to cause a problem installing updates. However, except for possible beta bugs getting in the way (which only rarely happens), a system installed from the beta ISO can be updated successfully.\nAfter 13.04 is released, an installed beta version will become the stable version simply by installing updates (in the Software Updater or by running sudo apt-get update, sudo apt-get upgrade, and, if any packages are held back, sudo apt-get dist-upgrade). For more information about this, see:\n\n\n*\n\n*I installed an alpha or beta, am I up to date with the final release if I keep upgrading?\nSo, in summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your beta ISO image will always be beta; it will never be supported as stable installation media, and the system you get by installing it will always initially contain unstable packages. (And they'll be old, obsolete unstable packages if you install from the beta ISO after 13.04 is released.)\n\n*The actual operating system should, barring corner cases where a bug prevents it, simply upgrade seamlessly into the stable version, once the stable version is released.\n\n\nIf you're going to do new deployments of Ubuntu 13.04 after it is released, it's a good idea to obtain a copy of the stable release ISO for it. (Which doesn't exist yet, of course, but will once 13.04 is \"released.\")\n", "Q: Accept SSL cert for wrong domain A site has recycled their SSL cert from another site which is causing me errors on the command line (wget, etc).\nThey have 2 certs on different parts of the site both issued by the same authority which I have added the root and intermediate CRT's for.  \nWhat additional steps may I take to allow my system (12.04) to accept this 2nd cert with the wrong domain?\nClarification: These are two different domains and TLD's, not a sub-domain mismatch.\n\nA: This is the case where the client uses the wrong certificate for the wrong domain.

Again that is expect behavior and the client must obtain a different certificate for the different FQDN that they need the certificate for.\nHere is one solution that we provide to our clients: \nhttps://knowledge.verisign.com/support/ssl-certificates-support/index?page=content&id=SO16685\nAnother recommendation is to buy a SAN certificate that supports different FQDNs for any potential services they need.\nJimmy Edge - Symantec SSL employee\n", "Q: lyxpipe missing in ubuntu 12.10 I decided to write my thesis in LyX, got everything working nearly perfectly, but I found a strange problem which google cant help with...

By the way, I used to use the Windows boot loader to dual boot (edited with EasyBCD).Is it possible to fix this problem using the Windows 7 Setup CD and then configure the dual boot using EasyBCD like I used to do?\n\nA: For repair the Windows boot, you must start from the Windows 7 DVD, choose language, select \"repair your computer\", then you must select the Windows installation, click \"next\" and select \"Command Prompt\".

I recently decided to reinstall my Mythbuntu system, as it had been upgraded in phases from version 10.x and was throwing up fairly frequent errors.\nThe situation as was: Mythbuntu 12.something, running MythTV 0.26. Recordings are stored on a different drive to everything else, including the database.\nHow I proceeded:\n\n\n*\n\n*Used the Mythbuntu Control Centre's builtin Backup command to back up settings and database to the recordings drive.\n\n*Reinstalled Mythbuntu from an up to date ISO, wiping the system drive in the process.\n\n*Updated to MythTV 0.26 using the Mythbuntu repo.\n\n*Edited fstab to mount the recordings drive in the appropriate place.\n\n*Used the Mythbuntu Control Centre's builtin Restore command to restore the database and settings.\nThe problem: Now mythfrontend insists that it can't find the database.\nMy guess is that one of the things that was backed up and restored was the mysql password for the database - but presumably on a new install this is different to the old install?\nHow can I find out the correct password? Or, am I barking totally up the wrong tree here?\nThanks :) I'm afraid my knowledge of mysql admin is rather limited.\n\nA: To answer my own question:\nI was barking up the wrong tree. Mythbuntu's backup and restore correctly backs up and restores the password for the database with the database, but apparently not quite everywhere that it's needed (not in ~mythtv/.mythtv/config.xml). Manually editing the password in there to match the other config files (such as mysql.txt in the same directory) solved the problem.\nFor anybody who does actually need to know the MySQL password for a given user: I don't know if there's a way to find that out, but this page gives a way to reset it to a known value: http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Category:MySQL\n\nA: In my experience, when installing a secondary frontend, I grab the DB password from the backend (stored in the mythtv user's ~/.mythtv/config.xml) and use that for configuring the DB on the secondary frontend. It's always been working, so I assume this is a legitimate way to get the needed password.\n", "Q: Cryptkeeper 0.9.5 - 5.1 on ubuntu 12.10 Just FYI - I used Cryptkeeper to encrypt a folder containing over 2 GigaBytes of files (that's alot of files), and it seemed to work OK, it took a little while to encrypt all those files. BUT, when I decrypted the folder, it only took a few seconds to decrypt all the files. SAY WHAT?! Does anyone have any idea what happened - it doesn't make any sense to me. It's as if the original unencrypted files were saved somewhere and then when I decrypted the folder, Cryptkeeper didn't actually decrypt the folder but instead just made those original files reappear.\n\nA: I don't see sufficient information on the cryptkeeper website specifically, but I think the case is that when cryptkeeper is decrypting the folder, it in fact does not decrypt everything. It is only when you are actually opening a file, particularly a large one, that a great deal of data is decrypted, and where the slowdown may occur. The encryption process took longer because it was the entire folder and contents that were being decrypted. It appears that cryptkeeper uses EncFS, a project which you can learn more about the workings of here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EncFS\n", "Q: Flash Player Issues Flash videos don't work online (namely YouTube, et al).

I tried to use a tool that (supposedly) allows me to use Windows drivers on Linux, but it did not work.  How can I fix my problem?\n\nA: I had to install wireless firmware on an HP laptop I was working on a while back. It took care of the problem for me. Type this command in the terminal.

I would like to be able to import and process my photos on my local HDD, and then move them over to the external HDD when I get home. I would also like to be able to access a small thumbnail when not connected to the external HDD.\nThis seems like a problem which must be fairly common, but I've got no idea how to deal with it. Any ideas?\n\nA: Take a look at gThumb. It is quite simple but yet very powerful underneath. It facilitates file system folder structure and has more on top of it (tags, catalogs, marks, batch processes, simple image editing, export/import). So it won't be a problem to manage PC photos and external HDD photos from one program and move them one way around.\nAs to having a set of small thumbnails I guess you gonna have to do some scripting, which is also possible in gThumb. I've never herd of anything like this.\n", "Q: Why does my application behave differently with Unity? \nI'm the newly appointed application maintainer for a program called \"xlog\".  The program works fine in all but the Unity environment.  It is written using Gtk2.  \nI've never previously used Unity.  I noticed in Unity that the menu bar seems to be \"redirected\" to another place outside of my application GUI, to a bar at the top of the screen.  Secondly, one of the text entry boxes in my GUI is displayed as a thin line, unaccessible to the user except via the tab key.\nIf I take the xlog executable that works perfectly under Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS and copy it to a 12.10 Unity distribution, I see the different behavior.\nI haven't a clue where to look, or what I should consider modifying, in the xlog application, to remedy this situation.  What's different in Unity that is unique to all other environments where this application works properly?\n\nA: \nI noticed in Unity that the menu bar seems to be \"redirected\" to\n  another place outside of my application GUI, to a bar at the top of\n  the screen.\n\nI think what you are refering is the default behavior on Unity. Unity uses a global menu (the one you see at the top) similar to what is seen on OSX.\n\nIf you want this can be disabled in your application, but I think that is not very recommended: anyone using Unity will expect the menu not on the window, but at the top.\nRegarding the entry box I would guess that it may be a problem with the Ubuntu theme. To check it try to change the Ubuntu theme (under \"System Settings\" -> \"Appearance\") and see if the box stays the same.\nEdit\nI was curious and looking at the code it seems that the problem is in your application.This seems to fix the issue (I can't enter a newline on that box, but I can't say if this is normal or a bug). Those values (100, 200) were selected randomly so this may not be the best way to solve that.\n\n", "Q: How do I configure matplotlib to work on EC2?

BUT when we try something like this:\nbook2.dispersion_plot(\"chair\")\n\nNothing happens, where we would expect a new window to spawn and show the plot (thats what happens on the local machine). I suspect this has something to do with X11 but at this point I am way out of my depth of sys admin knowledge. Confirmed this both from a Mac (xQuartz) and PC (xming) client. Any help would be much appreciated.\n\nA: Got it. \nmatplotlib uses a rendering backend which has to play nice with x11. But selecting the right backend manually [matplotlib.use('TkAgg')] would throw an exception. Turns out that matplotlib does not build correctly under ubuntu with pip, missing some dependencies--specifically the ones needed for x11-friendly backends (setting the default to 'Agg' in matplotlibrc). Fixed by:\npip uninstall matplotlib           //unistall matplotlib\napt-get build-dep matplotlib       //download and build needed dependencies\npip install -U matplotlib          //force matplotlib rebuild\n\nThe above correctly sets the default backend to TkAgg (in matplotlibrc).

What can I do? This might sound odd, but I have a very peculiar graphics driver issue. Basically, I pop the Live CD in, and \"try Ubuntu\". Everything works fine from GUI animation, to fullscreen flash, to even full-screen 3D graphics.\nHowever, when I install the OS itself, and reboot into it \"properly\" for the first time, everything breaks. If I stick with open source, I'm unable to use the computer at all, and if I switch to any of the proprietary ATI drivers, usually the OS will be laggy, full-screen flash videos will be black, or 3D graphics will be choppy and glitchy.\nIt seems as if somewhere in between testing the OS out, and installing/updating it \"breaks\" the drivers. What can I do to keep them?\nI have an ATI Radeon HD 6850 (1GB) graphics card, and I'm running a 64-bit OS.\n\nA: I had the same problem when installing 13.04. I have a Radeon HD 6670 (TURKS). After installation the desktop was completely black, and even when switching to a terminal (CTRL+ALT+F1) the screen was still black.\nI found that the problem may be related with the use of VESA driver during start up. The solution I found involves using the xdiagnose tool, so you will need an X environment running. I was able to install the ATI proprietary driver and in my case this worked fine. Another option may be rebooting in recovery mode and select X failsafe mode. In my case it even worked resuming startup, as it seems to load X using VESA driver. In this case the desktop will run very slow but it can be used for the following steps.\nFirst open a terminal and run xdiagnose as root. This is a small tool to select some additional options for the display driver. Then I selected the following options under Debug:\n\n\n*\n\n*Display boot messages.\n\n*Enable automatic crash bug reporting.\n\n\nand the following options under Workarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable bootloader graphics.\n\n*Disable VESA framebuffer driver.\n\n\nThe tooltips for the last two options explain that on some systems if the VESA driver is used during start-up there may be problems when switching to the X graphics driver.\nAfter applying the changes and rebooting, the desktop is running with no problems, and \"About\" screen displays that the graphics driver being used is Gallium 0.4 on AMD TURKS.\nThis avoids the Ubuntu splash screen to be displayed during start-up. Also I am not sure if all the options selected in the xdiagnose tools are necessary. Some more testing will be necessary.\nI am sure there must be a lot of people with this same problem, so I hope this can help.\n", "Q: problem running league of legends I'm running ubuntu 12.04 and recently installed league of legends.

Here is my question- Can I install Ubuntu of a partition of a portable hard drive? Hard drive in question is this one. I want to give it half the total size available and also want to know if the OS will be portable and hence if I can run it on different systems.\n\nA: In theory yes, assuming the system is the right architecture - you will need to set up the drive to be bootable (which many drives are anyway - you would see these drives as a fixed disk under windows  ), and simply install ubuntu to that drive. Assuming you don't try to run 64 bit ubuntu on a 32 bit system (so its safer to use the 32 bit system), the worst that should happen is you would need to boot into safe mode. I used to do it with a bunch of 32 bit systems, but they were all the same generation/design of 32 bit x86 (I was running mostly core 2 duos).\nI'd recommend a less 'heavy' varient of ubuntu, since they don't rely as much on compositing. Linux handles switches of hardware surprisingly gracefully, unless it lacks a driver you need, and the basic install includes a lot of things you 'might' but don't always need.\nI'd also recommend doing the install of linux to the external hard drige on a system with no other hard drive on it to ensure that the bootloader is installed to the MBR of the external drive. This isn't necessary but makes things more foolproof.\nFinally your mileage may vary - some systems simply do not boot off some external drives, and you will want to test this arrangement on a few systems before trusting it to be your daily driver system. \n", "Q: how to use proxy server i wanna know to to setup proxy server in ubuntu 12.04 only to access Internet . in  windows i use freegate  to access Internet since all Internet sites are blocked by fortiguard web filtering  . is their is app or setting to bypass web filtering \n\nA: Yo can use Squid\n\nSquid is a full-featured web proxy cache server application which\n  provides proxy and cache services for Hyper Text Transport Protocol\n  (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and other popular network\n  protocols. Squid can implement caching and proxying of Secure Sockets\n  Layer (SSL) requests and caching of Domain Name Server (DNS) lookups,\n  and perform transparent caching. Squid also supports a wide variety of\n  caching protocols, such as Internet Cache Protocol, (ICP) the Hyper\n  Text Caching Protocol, (HTCP) the Cache Array Routing Protocol (CARP),\n  and the Web Cache Coordination Protocol. (WCCP)\nThe Squid proxy cache server is an excellent solution to a variety of\n  proxy and caching server needs, and scales from the branch office to\n  enterprise level networks while providing extensive, granular access\n  control mechanisms and monitoring of critical parameters via the\n  Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). When selecting a computer\n  system for use as a dedicated Squid proxy, or caching servers, ensure\n  your system is configured with a large amount of physical memory, as\n  Squid maintains an in-memory cache for increased performance.1\n\nTo install Squid,  Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

Context\nI have an eMachines computer I bought from Walmart about 2-3 years ago. It came with Windows 7 and everything was great. I'm an HTML5 developer, and I do a lot of 2D and 3D development, both with HTML5's 2D canvas rendering context and with WebGL. I had never had any performance problems running on Windows 7.\nRecently I decided to get rid of Windows, and I installed Ubuntu 12.04 on it. The video card is an nVidia GeoForce 6150SE.\nHere's my frustration and question:\nThe default graphics driver (NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (post-release updates)(version 173-updates) works greats (smooth playback and everything). The problem: It won't run WebGL no matter what I try.\nIf I install any other driver (version current, version current-updates, etc.), I can get WebGL to play, but any video playback or HTML5's request animation frame is super choppy. I've tried every last suggestion I found online (I've been trying to get this to work for a few weeks now).\nThe monitor I use is a bit dated. It's a Samsung SyncMaster 740b.\nQuestion:\nIf I buy a new monitor and use it with the latest graphics card driver I have, is the choppiness likely to go away? \n\nA: no. your display has (nearly) nothing to do with the video playback speed.\nIt's more that the free drivers don't speed up video decoding, while the proprietary does.

There are a few tricks that help, but don't be surprised to have weird bugs. I recently removed all threads from an application and it feels much better.\nSo, the first thing you should think about is whether you can rewrite your application to take advantage of the GLib async methods.\nIf you insist on having threads, keep these two rules in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Call GLib.treads_init() as early as possible in your code\n\n*When calling GUI events in a thread, wrap them in a GLib.idle_add()\n\n\nThese are rules, not guidelines. You must always do this when working with threads.\n\nA: Using time.sleep() is not a good idea when you are using gtk. You could try use a timer event. (I don't use quickly anymore but this should work i think.)\nfrom gi.repository import GLib\n\nclass Just_for_correct_coding():\n    self.per = int()\n\n    def start(self):\n        GLib.timeout_add_seconds(1, self.calc)\n\n    def calc(self,treeiter):\n        store=self.builder.get_object('liststore1')\n        print \"Calcing and changing percent,per=\"+str(self.per)\n        tore.set_value(treeiter,4,str(int(self.per))+\"%\")\n        self.per+=1\n        return True #important if you want to keep the timer running\n\n", "Q: python venv not working I am running Ubuntu 12.10 that has python 2.7 as its default.\nI have installed python 3.3 in /opt/python3.3 (using ./configure --prefix=/opt/python3.3).

Since both are mobile os why name them differently ? Or am i missing something here ? \n\nA: Ubuntu Touch\nUbuntu Touch is a stand-alone OS for mobile devices. It is only in beta and being tested on the Nexus 3 device. Canonical has assured fans that they have 2 major manufacturers ready to ship Ubuntu Touch with their new mobile models. It will not merge with Android or any other device, and it is simply an Ubuntu OS for mobile devices. \nThe full, official list of compatible devices can be seen here.\n\n\nUbuntu for Android\nUbuntu for Android is like a comparability mediator between the Desktop Ubuntu OS and your phone. It acts like a link between your Android quad-core phone and your computer. Ubuntu for Android will sit alongside Android, giving you the original functionality of your handset. Furthermore, 'docking' it will give you an environment where both your computer and phone act as both a phone and computer.

I have what I think is a quick question: Is running ecryptfs-setup-swap on a system that didn't have home-directory or swap encryption enabled when it was installed persistent? The man page at http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/ecryptfs-setup-swap.1.html states that ecryptfs-setup-swap \"will detect existing swap partitions or swap files, and encrypt them, using cryptsetup.\" I don't understand whether ecryptfs-setup-swap needs to be run every time the system is booted, or if it just needs to be run once to make a permanent change to how swap space is handled by the system. If the change is permanent, is it permanent for all users on the system, or just the one that runs ecryptfs-setup-swap (I may be confused about how swap space works in general, I realize)?\nTo be clear, I do understand that I also need to run ecryptfs-migrate-home on the system to encrypt the home directory for my user account, and that that change will be persistent. I'm just confused about how swap space is handled.\nI would appreciate any information to help me understand better! Thank you!\nP.S. A tutorial at http://bodhizazen.com/Tutorials/Ecryptfs states that after using ecryptfs-setup-swap, \"a new entry for your encrypted swap is automatically generated in /etc/fstab , but unfortunately as of this writing ,the old entry is not removed and you must remove it manually (or suffer error messages when you boot).\" Is that still true?\nFull disclosure: I have also posted this question at https://superuser.com/questions/576097/is-ecryptfs-setup-swap-persistent. Once the question is answered either here or there, I will take down the unanswered instance.\n\nA: Running ecryptfs-setup-swap makes permanent changes to /etc/fstab and /etc/crypttab that ensure your swap space is encrypted at every boot.\nA random key is generated and used to encrypt swap at each boot.\nThe only exception to the above occurs if you add new swap files or swap partitions after you've run ecryptfs-setup-swap, as it only operates on the swap space present at that time.\nFull disclosure: I'm the author and maintainer of eCryptfs and ecryptfs-setup-swap.\n", "Q: Can I tar the whole system, clear everything and untar it back?

If not, what would you recommend?\nProbably, same troubles with partitions in system itself? (fstab is the simplest example)\n\nA: In general that should work. Some points to take care of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Exclude /dev /proc /sys /run\n\n*You can usually also exlude /tmp /mnt /media\n\n*Create the tar archive with a live cd if possible\n\n*If you want the same sizes of your partitions, save your partition table (e.g. with parted /dev/sd... unit b print)\n\n*Do not forget to run grub-install\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu One: \"The user cancelled a prompt.\" Every time that I try to sign in to Ubuntu One, it tells me: \n\"An application wants to create a new keyring called 'default'.

I also got a black screen after install and after lots of searching on forums, I concluded the UEFI BIOS was part of the problem. \nAs a mac computer also uses UEFI/EFI, I thought the solution may be to use an Ubuntu distro iso especially made for the Mac. I installed Ubuntu on a separate 2nd SSD just to keep it separated from Windows 7. My purpose is to have a dualboot system (Windows 7 and Ubuntu).\nThis is what I did (july 2012) in short:\n\n\n*\n\n*copy the ubuntu mac iso on an usb stick (there are lots of manuals how to do that)\n\n*boot up with this stick and install normally, just select the right partition and/or disk, otherwise your Windows 7 install will be overwritten. In my case I selected to have Ubuntu installed on the 2nd SSD.\n\n*after ubuntu is fully installed, reboot and Windows 7 boots up\n\n*Download EasyBCD (http://neosmart.net/EasyBCD/) to alter the bootmanager. Here you have to assign the right OS to the right partition, so you can select Ubuntu or Windows to point at at boot time.\n\n\nSuccess!\nPS in the meantime, take a look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI.

You're looking for what is known as a daemon in the *nix world. A daemon is a background service that is usually started automatically on boot, but can be invoked at any time.\nI haven't had much experience with python-based daemons (only C), but the concepts are similar. See this daemon-skeleton code from the Python Cookbook. All you have to do is override the run() method in the derived MyDaemon class.\nIf having an extra class for the sole purpose of daemon-izing is overkill (I can't see how, but anyway), try this (found at stackoverflow) :)\nHope this helps! :)\n", "Q: What alternatives to Nautilus exist which are more responsive?

Enjoy!  \n\nA: Actually, by coincidence, it turns out that cd *Bikes*<RETURN> works without any changes to the system.\nI am just a little stunned that it didn't require quotes around *Bikes*.\n\nA: Try to use the tool called z, it allows what you need, plus it creates a global database of your cd's weighted by frequency and allows you to jump to frequently visited place instantly. \nIf you have visited the Bikes directory, you can later type\nz Bikes\n\nand you will jump there\n\nA: The answer from desuga works, but it is case sensitive.\nIf you do not want it to be case sensitive, the ~/.bashrc file should be:\n# Alias for making a \"Super cd\"\n\nalias scd=\"cd\"\n\n_scd_completion() {\n    mapfile -t COMPREPLY < <(ls -d */ | grep -i \"${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}\")\n}\ncomplete -F _scd_completion scd\n\n\n", "Q: Couldn't install inside Windows 8 I've boot with Ubuntu 12.10 boot able disk. I've selected Install inside windows option. PC has been restarted. Then My windows 8 started normally. But, the installation didn't started.\n\nA: To install Ubuntu from within windows, you need to use Wubi.  \nTo use Wubi, just download it from Here.  \nFor morre info take a look at Installing Ubuntu from within Windows.  \nTo install Along side Windows, just choose that option when you get to the installation type screen.\nFor Wubi installation instructions click Here\nFor other installation methods click Here\n\nA: The following things may help you-\n\n\n*\n\n*Try resetting your boot order. If the hard drive boots before you disk, the OS is only going to find Windows 8 and hence run it. Ubuntu must be visible to the OS before Windows is. To change the boot order is not tough. As the computer starts, a black screen usually with name of the manufacturer shows up. In this screen is information related on how to enter the boot menu. However if you can't read it, you'll have to try one of the following keys which usually allows you to enter the boot- Esc, F1-F12 or Delete. Once you are in, there will be a tab in the menu saying boot. Change the boot order in there to put the CD/DVD drive before Hard disk. I faced this problem myself when I formatted Windows 7 to install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on my desktop. The instructions at the bottom of the boot menu will help you on how to navigate between windows and how to set the boot order. As all boot chips are programmed differently from their manufacturers, there is not going to be much help there from us.\n\n*If, however, this doesn't work, then- check if the DVD or CD you have has Ubuntu installed in it properly. After burning, the disk should have 700+ MB occupied. This is the simplest method to check if the burn was complete or not. Try using the same DVD/CD as a Live CD on some other PC.\n\n*Although I don't have any proper link to backup this statement, I've heard (elsewhere) that people were complaining about Windows 8 blocking other OS to be installed alongside it and some said that Microsoft will ask you to buy a key from it to unlock the loader to install other OS alongside Windows 8 in dual boot. Maybe its true. Maybe its not.

It seems to maintain both OpenNI 1.x and 2.x compatibility while solving the \"bandwith\" errors/code 10 on Windows.\n\nA: I had the same error message. And I solved it by simply plugging the Xtion into a USB 2.0 port... But it seems you already tried that.\nI didn't attempt to update the Xtion firmware, I plugged it into a USB 2.0 port which worked for me, but the link may be helpful for you.\n\nA: You can follow these instructions:\nhttp://www.pcl-developers.org/xhci-hcd-I-hate-you-USB-3-0-and-Primesense-Asus-Xtion-td5707949.html\nThis should help, if you have an USB3.0 Controller which has an separate USB2.0 controller.

No response at all using internal keyboard. The solution with adding \"i8042.nopnp=1 i8042.dumbkbd=1\" in /etc/default/grub worked great for me. \n\nA: You will need to connect a wired keyboard for this to work. If the keyboard works in Windows, it might be usable at the BIOS screen.\nDuring the POST (Power On Self Test), when the PC is running up for a power-on or a reset, the USB keyboard input is managed by the BIOS routines, if set up to do so. \nIf not, there is no way the USB keyboard can be recognised and a PS/2 type keyboard is expected to be connected to its port by default instead.\nAs long as your USB keyboard isn't recognised, you aren't able to access the BIOS so you can't do anything else as to connect a PS/2 type keyboard, access the BIOS... \n\n...by the use of [Del], [F1], [F2], [F9] or whatever key is indicated at the early stages of the start-up process of the PC,\n\nand enable the \"USB keyboard support\" or \"USB legacy support\" option that can be found in the BIOS.\nSave, exit and reset. If, in spite of the precedent set-up, the BIOS continues refusing to recognise the USB keyboard (e.g. you can't go into the BIOS by pressing the correct key on the USB keyboard) you have a second chance to convince it to.\nUse the PS/2 keyboard to enter the BIOS again, \n\nand look at the \"PnP mode\" option. PnP is the procedure to set-up extension cards and some on-board' chips connected to the PCI bus. As USB controllers in your computer (both on-board as the eventually added expansion cards) are connected to the PCI bus, they have to be set-up by the BIOS to have the USB keyboard working at the early POST phase. \nThere are two configuration modes available for PnP:\n\n\n*\n\n*the BIOS has to manage the PnP setup; \n\n*the operating system deals with the PnP setup.\nYou have to explicitly specify the BIOS has to manage the PnP mode (and not the operating system), to obtain the USB keyboard recognised during this phase.\nVerify this and, on change, save, exit the BIOS and reset the PC to control if the USB keyboard is now alive.\n(Situation 2.) When the boot manager's menu' appears on the screen no key on the USB keyboard enables you to move the selection to one different item from the default one that will start the boot automatically after a few seconds.\nThis means that you haven't successfully managed the instructions in \"situation 1.\"!\nIt must be clear that no boot manager loads any keyboard device-driver so it expects the BIOS to manage the USB keyboard correctly!\nDuring this stage the o.s. hasn't been already loaded so no change to the o.s. configuration will solve the problem!\nYou have no choice, go back to Case 1., and work to solve the situation from there.\n(Situation 3.) So you have managed to get the USB keyboard recognised by the BIOS, and in Grub (or LiLo) you are able to select a choice different from the default by the use of the up/down arrows keys.\nAfter a not so long time (we hope), the log-in screen appears but you discover to be unable to write any character into the user/password fields, or if you started from a live CD-R/DVD and you aren't able to write with your keyboard to any application you run from the desktop.\nFrom this point on, problems related to the USB keyboard have to be conducted, in some way, to the Linux operating system configuration issues (and in rare cases to bugs).\nIn this case, the principal sources of the problem to be searched in are:\nincorrect o.s. setup files for character mode terminal emulation (e.g. the recovery mode in *ubuntu);\nincorrect window server setup files for graphic windowing environment (when the windowing mode is run, e.g. Xwindow in Linux)\nmissing, wrong, bugged keyboard device drivers;\nunsupported USB devices.\nAs stated before this case isn't covered in this document. This because the verifications/operations to be made to get the USB keyboard working are so many and depending from e.g. the window manager used, to justify separate documentation.\nHope this helps!\n(Source of information: here.) \n", "Q: No sound on HDMI through a Pioneer VSX-527, works if connected directly to the TV I have a HTPC with an IntelHD 4000 chip.

I have read on other pages that a hdmi switch could resolve handshaking problems but its a longshot in this case as im not sure thats the problem...\nEdit: it seems that setting the refreshrate to 24 with xrandr fixes my issue.\nTry the following command: xrandr --output HDMI2 --mode 1920x1080 --rate 24\nIf you dont use hdmi 2 you can easily see which one you are using by just typing xrandr .\n\nA: Check your graphics driver since HDMI is a digital signal for both audio and video. If you type\n aplay -l, \n\nyou should see all your audio outputs. If your HDMI output is not listed, then it is probably a driver issue. If it is listed, try using aplay commands to play a file to check if it is working.

Just for the record i have install samba from the software center, since it didnt work I unistall it and reinstall it from the terminal.I've also tried to share the folder runing Nautilus as root but without any success. does any body have an idea that helps me?\n\nA: I was looking for the answer to why Nautilus won't let me share folders via the gui for a long time. Turns out, you can only share folders which are children of your home directory. You can surely share other folders on the system, but you will find it much easier to simply create your share folders inside the home directory and right-click > sharing options. This assumes you are trying to do a simple samba share.\nIf you really need to share a folder outside your home directory, I suppose you could mount the folder to a folder within your home directory.

(I know there won't be any ubuntu at boot because mbr writing over grub.)\n\n*After installation I tried to re-install grub but I failed.\n\n*I used a software named \"boot-repair\" but that failed too.\n\n*I switched my BIOS settings to RAID from IDE and now win7 is not booting.\n\n*I tried to use repair tool in windows 7 installation disk which is another fail.\n\n*Switched back to RAID and installed brand new ubuntu on sda.\n\n*Used clonezilla to restore my first ubuntu back on sda.\n\n*Tried to use \"boot-repair\" but failed again.\n\n\nCurrent situation:\nIn BIOS in storage device options my settings is RAID.\nI have ubuntu installed on my sda.\nI have win7 installed on my sdb1.\nMy boot is grub and it only shows ubuntu.\nAnd here is an information about my disks situation which is created with \"boot-repair\"\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/5665110/\nMy question and desire is simple. I want to dual boot these two systems. If I can add win7 which is in sdb1 at the moment into grub2 my problem will be solved.

I can format all the harddisks there is no important information on both ssd and hdd (which I tried but I failed that too.). I have an external 1tb usb harddrive (if it can help any).\nThank you for your time to read my problem. =)\n\nA: This answer is rather late, but it may help someone else.\nI suspect the problem is due to you having the RAID enabled at the time of the install. With most fake RAID controllers (almost certainly the sort that you have on your board) the RAID BIOS routines will create a special on-disk format. If the disk is then connected with the RAID switched off, then the regular system will not be able to read anything that is on that disk.\nCheck if with RAID OFF either disk will boot. If not, the way to proceed is to ensure that RAID is off in your BIOS, then wipe each disk and re-install the OS you want to \neach of the two drives (if one disk boots then it does not need to be reinstalled).  \nCheck that each disk will boot as the sole (and usually first) disk in the system.\nThen ensure that you are booting from the first disk with Ubuntu installed. You can then add the Win disk as the second drive and add its stanza to Ubuntu grub, either manually or using boot-repair.\nThe only time you need to have RAID on is with multiple hard drives of the same size for striping or for data redundancy. NEVER turn it on with two disks of different sizes or types (unless you know exactly why you are doing so, of course!). And as a last point, if you do need RAID,  most people will find that Linux software RAID is better than all fake-RAID (and often hardware RAID that costs less than $350 and does not have dedicated memory)...  \n\nA: Try os-prober and update-grub, if you haven't already.\n", "Q: How do I install video4linux2 in Ubuntu 12.10, and do I need to?

Should I be worried? :)\nThanks!\n\nA: Curious that you mention that case. I have the same case here. Let me add that I have tested this hard drive since 11.10 all the way to 13.04 right now. Keep on reading to see everything the hard drive has gone through with the no problems at all.\nTo start, doing sudo fdisk -l brings me the following:\nDisk /dev/sdd: 1000.2 GB, 1000204886016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 121601 cylinders, total 1953525168 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00000000\n\nDisk /dev/sdd doesn't contain a valid partition table\n\nNow, I have used this drive internally and in an USB External enclosure. It works perfectly and is detected correctly with no problems in other Ubuntu systems. Note that I am talking about working correctly for any general intent and purpose (files, movies, text, music, etc.. ). In it I have many movies and tv series. I even ran Disk Utility on it and got the following:\n\nNow here is the only problem I have found. When checking the Drive with Gparted I get the following message for it:\n\nAnd even though it looks like an \"OMG ITS GOING TO DIE!!\", it has been like that for little over a year. Which means, it lasted the use I gave it on Ubuntu 11.10, 12.04, 12.10 and right now 13.04.\nI can actually run fsck on it and it would say everything is perfect.\nI can even check how it is mounted using mount. When I mount the unit using the Nautilus file manager it shows like this:\n/dev/sdd on /media/cyrex/stuff type ext4 (rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=udisks2)\nSo with a year of a lot of copying, pasting, deleting, executing stuff from it, changing it from one PC to the next and basically doing anything to it, it still works, the data is safe and I love Linux. I also invite you to read this question which should set your mind at ease.\nAdditional Information regarding Gparted (Thanks to chaskes)\nAs an aside, the error messages from gparted just mean what you already know: there's no partition table. When providing information, gparted calls programs in e2fsprogs (if installed). These programs require the device name to be passed in. The problem is that gparted is a partition editor. When it sees /dev/sdd by itself in /proc/partitions, it assumes there must really be a partition 1 and passes /dev/sdd1. (Note the path gparted reports.) e2fsprogs can't find the superblock since the device name it has been given doesn't exist. But, if you run the e2fsprogs from the cmd line using the actual device name /dev/sdd, they work fine. In other words, despite the anxiety the gparted errors may cause, the filesystem and it's superblock are just fine.\n\nA: Given what you've shared so far, you're fine.  Essentially, you're using the entire disk as if it was a partition.  Your system is smart enough to look at the first few bytes of the disk, and find \"oh, gee, this device is being used as a partition.\" \nPartitions are just ways to carve up a disk for different reasons; for most people's external storage needs, that would only matter if you wanted to boot an operating system from that drive.\nWhat would be risky is if you take that drive and plugged it into either a mac or a pc; by default, these operating systems have a popup saying \"the disk you've inserted doesn't have a valid file table, would you like me to initialize it?\"  If you accidentally hit the return/enter key, it may do just that.  That said, it's the same risk even if you did put partitions on it.\n\nA: Partitions are indeed not strictly necessary for using block devices, I also have been using such scheme in some of my USB drives with no problems.\nHaving said that, partitions are good for some things. One that comes to mind is booting. If the BIOS tries to boot from that device, it will expect to find a partition table and a MBR at some fixed locations. Compatibility is another point. For instance, I am not sure what Windows will think of this minimalistic approach, probably nothing too good.\nI'd just say to be careful when you are running partitioning programs, installing GRUB or connecting the USB drive to non-Unix operating systems.\n\nA: If you haven't any important data on it or if you can make a backup of the files on your hdd, than i would suggest to create a partition table with gparted: http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/gparted.html#mozTocId555890\nBut i don't think that it is a problem if it has been working properly so far\n", "Q: using ubuntu-one on other linux distros?

More information can be found in the FAQ.\n\nNote : Ubuntu One is a tool to synchronize information. It is a cloud service to synchronize information between 'computers.' Synchronizing is not the same as making a backup. Look here for backup tools. Your information in Ubuntu One still needs to be backed up.\n\n\nA: Note: Ubuntu One was discontinued in 2014. More information at\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_One\nWhat is Ubuntu One?\nUbuntu One is the personal cloud that brings your digital life together, so you can enjoy your content, your way, wherever you are. With our suite of cloud services including storage, sync, sharing and streaming - you have immediate access to your music collection, favorite photos, videos, important documents and more, at any time and from any device.\nIn what Operating Systems can I install Ubuntu One?\nYou can install Ubuntu One in Windows, Mac, Android, IPhone, Ipad and of course, Ubuntu.\nYou can download the version for your operating system directly from the Ubuntu One site:\n\n*\n\n*Windows\n\n\n*Mac\n\n\n*Ubuntu\n\n\n*Iphone / Ipad\n\n\n*Android\nWhat are the Ubuntu One System Requirements?\nThe system requirements are very low. The space needed to install depends on the operating system but overall is less than 30 MB. Regarding CPU or RAM it also depends on the operating system but on Ubuntu it uses less than 32 MB and has less than 1% CPU usage when using an Intel Pentium 4 or above. Since Ubuntu One is a cloud service, it needs an internet connection to work correctly.\nHow can I install and configure Ubuntu One\nIn the following link you will find up to date information regarding Ubuntu One's installation and configuration: Ubuntu One FAQ\nSome of the information in the FAQ covers:\n\n*\n\n*Installation on all operating system where it can be installed (Mac, Android, Windows)\n\n*Configuration issues that the user might encounter.\n\n*Installation on different Ubuntu versions\n\n*Account Creation and configuration\n\n*Account Issues\n\n*File Syncing\n\n*Sharing\n\n*FTP Usage\n\n*Music Streaming\n\n*More...\n\n", "Q: can't login in GUI of ubuntu 12.04 I have done extensive search for the answer to this problem:\nOn the login in page, after tying password, my screen turns dark for a second and becomes the login page again. the guest account doesn't work either.\nwhat I have done:\nin tty1:\nsudo rm /home/wks-403/.Xauthority\nsudo reboot\n\nor\nin tty1:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER $HOME\nThen press CTRL+ALT+F7 and try to log in\n\nor change from lightdm to gdm, in tty1:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm\n\nbut none works on my laptop.\nthe parameters of my laptop:\nthinkpad x-61 32bit\ngraphic card: Intel Corp.

BOTH are amd64 bit architectures and I have verified that fact backwards and forwards.\nI have followed the instructions at both:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebootstrapChroot\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/12956/how-do-i-run-32-bit-programs-on-a-64-bit-ubuntu/12957#12957 (thanks Giles!)\nRTFM and fat-fingering issues aside, I have now run into an issue during the debootstrap installation where I am getting to a point and getting:\nW: Failure trying to run: chroot /home/user/test/chroot mount -t proc proc /proc\n\nThe installation that lays down is not enough to schroot to, as I have tried, nor if I redo with the --foreign option does it do any better.\nThe research I have done seems to indicate this issue is related to:\n\n*\n\n*trying to put a 64 bit install in a 32 bit OS (which I am clearly NOT doing)\n\n\n*possible issues with procfs in certain kernels, but the bug reports are unclear, and clearly this looks old\n\n\n*a lot of virtualization related issues (which I am not doing any)\nI am thinking since this is a very simple installation of a file:/// based (another) ubuntu based distro into my chroot environment (64 -> 64) that there must be something real simple in the set up steps I have left out or forgotten. Should I do something like pre-mount the /srv/chroot/backbox3_01/var/proc to something like:\nsudo mount -o bind /proc /srv/chroot/backbox3_01\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n****** UPDATE *******\nSo I have dug around a bit more, and I at least know what part of the issue is. The failure is coming from the fact that \"mount\" is an unknown \"file or directory\" which means that at the context point that chroot is running from there is no \"mount\" executable that can be called. I am guessing that:\na. Some executable context did not get brought over and \"pre\" set up properly during the phase before this step?\nor\nb. Some environment properties need to be exported prior to running this script maybe?\nor\nc. ??\nAny help is appreciated...\n*********** Further Update ***************\nApparently the Backbox installation is not getting inflated into the chroot directory anywhere near properly. Backbox 3 is a precise (Ubuntu 12.04) based distro and I just ran debootstrap on precise. I get a full installation.\nWhen I do the same for Backbox, I only get /dev, /etc, and /var set up. Nothing else, which means \"mount\" doesn't exist in the chroot'ed structure. I have tried installing this from the CD and from a local copy of the CD (on my file system). I have checked the \"Release\" doc on the installation CD and it seems complete, but I don't see why it stops before installing the rest of the components.\nSo I am guessing there is something in the Backbox Distro that is not set up to allow debootstrap to properly re-inflate it - at least from the CD distro. Does anyone know of an online archive (equivalent to http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/) for Backbox? Or if not, I guess my options are going to be:\n\n*\n\n*Hacking the Backbox Distro to make it work, any suggestions where to start?\n\n\n*Pulling down an Xubuntu distro and then applying the Backbox ppa... Is there a Xubuntu script available for debootstrap and does anyone have a link to an automated installer for all the BB ppa tools to get them installed quickly?\n:(\n\nA: In my system that happens with every Ubuntu/Backbox I have tried. It seems that the CD cannot be used as a repository (see here), which makes sense: debootstrap should need a path to a repository (some local/remote folder with a predefined structure, and .deb archives) and the Ubuntu/Backbox comes with a squashfs (basically a image with a base system in it).\nAs Backbox seems to be just Ubuntu 12.04 (it uses as source of packages http://archive.ubuntu.com) and some additional repositories, I think you have two options here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a basic Ubuntu chroot and then install all the needed software: you can provide debootstrap with a script to add the PPA's, install the software, etc.\n\n*Extract the squashfs: you will need to mount the ISO, then mount the squashfs in it and finally copy the root filesystem:\nsudo mount /path/to/backbox.iso <bb_mount_point>\nsudo mount -t squashfs <bb_mount_point>/casper/filesystem.squashfs <squash_mount_point>\nsudo cp -rxv <squash_mount_point> <chroot_destination>\n\nI have not tried any of those so I can't assure you any will work. Also a valid way to achieve this would be install BB on a virtual machine (you can use QEMU/KVM/etc) and then copy the root filesystem to whenever you need it.\nGood luck.\n\nA: I have just a bunch of wild guesses here since my experience is with debootstrap for Debian mostly.\n\n\n*\n\n*Have you tried running the offending command manually from a shell? This can often give more insights as to what is happening.\n\n*This looks strange to me: chroot /home/user/test/chroot mount -t proc proc /proc. Is there really a chroot binary under /home/user/test?\n\n*What happens if you try to specify full path of mount executable like this: chroot /home/user/test/chroot /bin/mount -t proc proc /proc ?\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10, suddenly HD performing ultra slow for no aparent reason On Ubuntu 12.10 AMD64. I have been using this computer with Ubuntu for a couple of years, and it has worked perfectly. \nThis HD is just one year old. \nIt is a 2TB HD. I have been using it mostly for a partition of 50GB for the Root folder, the /Home folder was just storing my backups and the profiles of the applications I have been using. So I coudl say I have not making use of this HD. I placed all my work files in an external HD, just for reasons like what has happened now. \nToday I decided to check some files in another external HD, and finally decided to copy like 200GB of content from the external drive to the internal drive via USB 2.0, as this was taking 2 hours I decided to do other things and went away from the computer. Last time I checked there was like 45 minutes remaining, and went away again. Also I think the screen saver got activated, it has been a source of problems several times, with this and with other computers for the last years.

If you can verify that you actually have 1GB of RAM then please run an app that can check your memory for corruption. \nThe fact that the installer fails in that part and Windows gives you a blue screen memory error might be signs that you have corrupted memory in your computer.

Instead, burn the image in a CD/DVD in another computer.\n\n*Format the pen drive and copy the Ubuntu ISO image to the pen drive.\n\n*Boot in another computer from that LiveCD or LiveDVD that you burned.\n\n*Insert the pen drive and copy the Ubuntu ISO image from it to the LiveCD/LiveDVD desktop.\n\n*Open DASH in the LiveCD/LiveDVD desktop session and type Startup Disk Creator. you should see an app that looks like a hard drive with the Ubuntu logo on it. Run this app.\n\n*Follow the steps there to make a Pen Drive bootable with Ubuntu.

You can find the latest Virtualbox version for Ubuntu in: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads\nIt should show the versions of Ubuntu like in the following image:\n\nYou can also find the latest Extension Pack in: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads\nAfter you download the newest Virtualbox version, simply double click on it and the Ubuntu Software Center will take care of everything else. I should mention that you can only install the Extension Pack to the same version of Virtualbox. So if you have Virtualbox 4.2.10, you can only install the 4.2.10 of the Extension Pack.\nAfter this, Virtualbox should notify you when there is a new update, either by doing an update of the system with the Update Manager or by opening Virtualbox when there is an update available.\n\nA: To update virtual box to the latest version run these two commands:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install virtualbox\n\nNote: This will check ppa and find out if there is any update available if so your virtual box will be updated.\n", "Q: Where are the OpenVPN connection logs and configuration files? I have problem connecting to OpenVPN server. Where are OpenVPN log files and how do I find the connection details?\n\nA: By default, in most distros, OpenVPN log output goes to the syslog, which is usually at /var/log/syslog\nHowever, your config files can set the logfile location explicitly, e.g.:\nlog-append /var/log/openvpn.log\n\nThis works for both OpenVPN clients and servers. OpenVPN config files are usually located in /etc/openvpn and usually named *.conf. server.conf is canonical; client config filenames are usually like <client name/>.conf.\n\nA: Log file location\nOn servers, OpenVPN is usually run as a system service, i.e., started with the\n--daemon option. According to the OpenVPN man page, using the --daemon [progname]\noption has the following effect:\n\nBecome  a daemon after all initialization functions are completed.  This\n  option will cause all message and error output to be sent to the syslog file\n  (such as /var/log/messages), except for the output of scripts and ifconfig\n  commands, which will go to /dev/null unless otherwise redirected.  The\n  syslog redirection occurs immediately at the point that --daemon is parsed\n  on the command line even though the daemonization point occurs later.  If\n  one  of  the --log options is present, it will supercede (sic) syslog\n  redirection.\n\nUse either of the --log file or --log-append file options if you want OpenVPN\nmessages to be logged to a different file. The --log option causes the\nspecified log file to be over-written each time the OpenVPN daemon starts\nwhile the --log-append option adds new entries to the log file. These\noptions can also be set in the OpenVPN configuration file, e.g.,\nlog /var/log/openvpn.log\n\nVerbosity\nThe --verb option can be used to set the log file verbosity from 0 (no\noutput except for fatal errors) to 11 (for maximum debugging information).\nThe man page specifies levels of 1 to 4 as the appropriate range for normal\nusage. This behaviour can be set in the OpenVPN configuration file, e.g.,\nverb 3\n\n\nA: Use the -l or --syslog argument calling openconnect. Now you can check with tail -f /var/log/syslog\n\nA: If you are using the network manager plugin (network-manager-openvpn), look into /var/log/syslog\nThis should give you the last logs of openvpn:\n$ grep VPN /var/log/syslog\n\nConnection details are to be found in /etc/openvpn/\n\nA: It is supposed to be in your home directory (home directory of the user whom executing it), eg ~. Running an ls -l command will perhaps reveal it. On the other hand, you may start openvpn with --debug option to capture what's happening realtime on the terminal.\n", "Q: How to appear drive on windows if whole drive is selected as swap space? I was installing ubuntu at time of drive selection i selected whole drive d as swap area and then i quit the installaton now it is not appearing in windows and even in try ubuntu button as came up on boot please help to get back my drive so that i can see that drive in windows \n\nA: If you set up a drive as swap, you are pretty much done with the data that used to live there. That being said, you might want to look into something like this.. \nMight-Just-Help\n", "Q: Why does chmod 644 make directories inaccessible? I have a bunch of media files (that only need to be 644) that were a mix of various permissions. Some were group or global writable so I thought, just to be safe, I'll chmod them all back to 644.\nThe problem is there is a directory hierarchy and for all the directories that were caught in this ls -l displays them as:\nd????????? ? ? ? ?            ? Dirname\n\nIf I chmod that to 744, it's fixed.\nMy question is: What's going on here? Do directories need to be executable?\n\nA: As noted in the manpage for chmod with relation to permissions: \n\nThe  letters rwxXst select file mode bits for the affected users: read\n         (r),  write  (w),  execute  (or  search  for  directories)  (x),  execute/search  only  if  the  file is a directory or already has execute\n         permission for some user (X)\n\nThe executable bit on a folder is explained above as a 'search' permission; i.e. the execute bit merely allows you to access the folder in a file browser or to move to the folder from the terminal by running the cd command or running ls ~/folder to list the files in the folder. \nThe folder must be executable for the owner, although the superuser would still be able to access the folder as when using sudo any file or directory can be accessed or deleted. In addition, directory and file permissions are explained further in this useful article at Stackoverflow.\nIt is also important to note that 'executing' the folder doesn't mean you are actually running any code or commands like when a executable binary or script is run.\nFor a home Desktop user (though perhaps not for your server) most folders within $HOME have the execute permission set for user, group, and other if viewed with stat ~/myfolder (excerpt below):\nAccess: (0755/drwxr-xr-x)  Uid: ( 1000/    mike)   Gid: ( 1000/    mike)\n\nThe standard permissions for folders within $HOME are 755 or 775 and for files they are 644. However, the rest of the filesystem will differ.  Again, folders must have the execute bit for the owner or they will not be able to be opened by him. It is important to be careful with chmod when changing permissions and particularly when doing it recursively as the situation can quickly get messed up.\nFor more information, see man chmod or the Ubuntu manpages online, and this article at Superuser. \n\nA: Directories need x bit set (for directory that bit is seen as search bit) to open. Many people discover that when they remove the executable bit with chmod -R on the entire folder, then they cannot access it anymore. To fix this I use tree so I can get only the folder set and avoid the nightmare of having all the files set as executables ( the option for tree is  -d List directories only.):\nsudo tree -faid dirname | xargs -L1 -I{} sudo chmod +x \"{}\"\n\nif you don't have tree:\nfind  dirname -type d -exec chmod +x {} \n\nWarning!!! you should have this into considerations:\n\n\n*\n\n*using chmod or chown recursive on root / directory or system directories will destroy your OS (actually anything recursive on / directory or system directories is dangerous)\n\n*this is not a good security practice to set permission bulk like that\n", "Q: installed mediterraneandark theme, but doesn't look like example I have installed a theme in Ubuntu 12.10, and the preview image looks like \n.  \nHowever, Nautilus file manager looks the same, it's just the window manager top part (title, close, minimise maximise) which has changed.\nAm I missing a step?\nTo clarify: The colours have changed, but the layout and buttons remain the same. It looks like \n.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: You have to install Nautilus 3.6. It is not included in Ubuntu 12.10 repositories, so run following commands:\n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3\n\nand then:\n$ sudo apt-get update\n\nNow you just have to kill all Nautilus processes:\n$ killall nautilus\n\nand upgrade your software:\n$ sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nYou should have Nautilus 3.6 now.\n", "Q: A weird thing about Sublime Text 2 installed I downloaded sublime text 2, unpacked it to /opt/sublime and created a link of /opt/sublime/sublime_text (executable) in /usr/bin so now I can just call it by typing \"sublime\" in console. \nBut it's not appeared in applications list: if I type sublime there, it won't be shown.

I recently noticed that there was a kernel warning saying that the nvidia driver wasn't compatible with booting into a video mode terminal, so I edited /etc/default/grub, to make it boot into a text only terminal. This worked fine for several days, but now suddenly When I go into a tty I only get a black screen and a flashing cursor. The resolution is also very low. I am actually able to log in and run commands, I just don't get any output, all happens is the cursor moves.\nWhat I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Setting it to boot back into video mode - same in a tty

(If this doesn't output anything you may need to restart your computer after installing v86d, I can't quite remember). Then run gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub, and make the grub_cmdline_linux_default look like this: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset video=uvesafb:mode_option=1024x768-32,mtrr=3,scroll=ywrap\", also check if this file contains the GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=something or other line. If it does, then remove it.\nBut replace 1024x768-32 with the highest listed resolution from the second step. Then run gksudo gedit /etc/initramfs-tools/modules, and add this to the bottom: uvesafb mode_option=1024x768-32 mtrr=3 scroll=ywrap Once again replacing 1024x768-32 with the mode you found. Then run gksudo gedit /etc/grub.d/10_linux, and find the part which looks like this:\nfunction gfxmode {\n    set gfxpayload=\"${1}\"\n    if [ \"${1}\" = \"keep\" ]; then\n        set vt_handoff=7\n    else\n        set vt_handoff=\n    fi\n}\n\nand make it look like this:\nfunction gfxmode {\n    set gfxpayload=\"${1}\"\n    if [ \"${1}\" = \"keep\" ]; then\n        set vt_handoff=\n    else\n        set vt_handoff=\n    fi\n}\n\nThen run sudo update-grub; sudo update-initramfs -u.

So, I'm trying to fix this problem manually. I have installed the 64 bit Ubuntu already. The problem is I cannot install any packages because when I do I get an error. For example\nif I run the command \nsudo dpkg -i wireless-bcm43142-dkms_6.20.55.19-1_amd64.deb\n\nI get this error:\n\ndpkg: error processing wireless-bcm43142-dkms_6.20.55.19-1_amd64.deb (--install: package architecture (amd64) does not match system (i386)\n\n\nI also get this error if I try to install any other package.

That is what your error message is basically informing you.\nYou'll need the 32bit variant of the package - it usually ends with the name i386.deb.\n\nUseful links:\n\n*\n\n*Difference between the i386 download and the amd64?\n\n\n*Is it possible to \"upgrade\" from a 32bit to a 64bit installation?\n\n\n*How do I check if I have a 32-bit or a 64-bit OS?\n\nA: The answer lies hidden in the documentation of dpkg:\ndpkg --print-architecture\n\nwill show you the architecture dpkg is willing to install packages for.\nIf the architecture amd64 is not listed, an amd package will be refused, even if all else seems fine. Now you can try to add it with the following command:\ndpkg --add-architecture amd64\n\nand show it by using the command: \ndpkg --print-foreign-architectures\n\nOn a system that was clearly installed as amd64, I had success in making dpkg trying to install the package.

I'm sorry if this has been questioned many times, but I'm still not sure I understand fully.\nwhat's the different between LTS and normal release? other than support time, of course. I mean, is there any specific OS feature?\nIIRC, LTS on point-releases get updated kernel and DE version matching to normal release, right? And I don't really see many new non-DE feature.\nCurrently I'm using Unity in Mint 14, but doesn't feel much different from when I was using Ubuntu 12.04 (which means most of 12.04 feature is Unity's feature, right?)\nI want to switch to Ubuntu again since people said 12.04.2 is pretty good. But I wonder if I should just wait for 13.04. If there's really no specific OS feature, and if 12.04.2 get the same Unity version as 13.04, then I'll pick 12.04.2 for longer support time.\n\nA: All a distro is is preinstalled software, and repositories. In an LTS this software, and the software in the repos is more stable. A desktop environment is just piece of software. In Ubuntu, Unity is installed by default, in mint, cinnamon or mate. However just because unity is the only one installed by default in ubuntu doesn't mean you can't use cinnamon or mate on it. IMHO there is a lot of oh I don't like Unity time to completely reinstall my OS around, when actually all they had to do was open the software centre and install another DE.\n", "Q: Lost Windows Frames, how to get them back?

I am running 12.10\n\nA: You can't. You can either let the launcher hide always, or never. \"Intellihide\" and \"dodge windows\" are removed from unity since ubuntu 12.10\n\nA: Short answer: you can't, or at least not by default. However, if you install Unity Tweak Tool, I think it may let you do this.\n\nA: They removed that capability from Unity, as far as I know, so as handuel said: you can't... but.\nThere is thogh a custom build of unity that re-enable a similar behaviour, in which the dock will hide only when it would collide with a window.

However, if I uncomment the corresponding line in /etc/powernap/config:\n[IOMonitor]\npostgres-io = \"postgres\"\n\n... powernap never allows the box to go to sleep, the logs (with DEBUG=3) show this:\nLooking for [postgres-io] IOMonitor\nActivity found, reset absent time [0/60]\n\nOne thing I have noticed is that postgres appears to be respawning processes every 2-3 mins (even without any user activity against the wiki); every time this happens, powernap prints:\n<powernap.monitors.IOMonitor.IOMonitor instance at 0xXXXX> - adding new PID 16783 to list.\n\nThe PIDs in questions appear to be the ones serving my wiki DB, eg:\npostgres 16783  1067  0 11:05 ?        00:00:00 postgres: confluence confluence 127.0.0.1(50689) idle\n\nI presume this is getting in the way?  Is this an issue with Postgres (is it supposed to respawn processes that often, even w/o activity?).  Any pointer as to how I go about debugging this would be most appreciated (maybe starting with how powernap infers I/O activity - since there are many postgres processes, perhaps I can find a regexp that will target just the right one?).\nPS: If I comment out the Postgres IOMonitor, powernap works a treat but then it does suspend the box while the Wiki is being used...\n\nA: Per above comments - with thanks to @craig-ringer for putting me on the right track!\n\n\n*\n\n*Postgresql isn't suitable to I/O monitoring to determine whether it's idle\n\n*Instead, it's better to monitor TCP connections to the front-end app if possible\n\n*However, be aware of bug 1070695 if your connections are established over IPv6.

There should be one that says on /home - that will tell you which partition is mounted where.  At any rate, it may help us to figure out what the problem may be.\nYou can also find out what directories in particular are taking up a lot of space with the du tool.

These are all addresses in memory, not values of a variable.  The specifier %u is for values of unsigned integers. So you are printing apples where the compiler expects oranges. Addresses are shorter than some values stored in variables. By using %u will actually print an address value as decimal (highly unusual) and some more data located behind that in memory. The compiler is complaining, because that's probably not what you want to do. To print the addresses use the specifier %p, as in:\nprintf(\"\\n&x = %p\\n\",&x);\n\nAside from that, your variables are signed integers and as such should use %i instead of %u. The %u format specifier of printf() is for positive integers only. For small positive values both, %i and %u are interchangeable. The warning is displayed because the variable type does not match its specifier and this causes problems in some cases.\nThis would be more sensible from your variable types:\nprintf(\"\\n\\np  = %p\\n\",  p); // p is a pointer so %p would print the address\n\nprintf(\"\\n*p = %i\\n\",   *p); // the data saved at that address is an integer \n                             // so %i is appropriate if you dereference the \n                             // pointer with the star \"*p\"\n\nprintf(\"\\n&x = %p\\n\",   &x); // &x gives the address of the integer variable x \n                             // so %p is the specifier for that address\n\nprintf(\"\\n&y = %p\\n\",   &y);\nprintf(\"\\n&z = %p\\n\",   &z);\n\nprintf(\"\\n&p = %p\\n\\n\", &p); // &p gives the address, where the pointer p is \n                             // stored -> still an address -> %p is the right\n                             // specifier\n\n\nA bit background on signed and unsigned integers and pointers:\nC uses the same 32 bit (or another power of two depending on the system architecture) to store unsigned and signed integers. Thus the highest unsigned int is 232-1 or in binary notation:\n\n232-1 = (11111111111111111111111111111111)2 <- (unsigned)\n\nAnd a the number one would look like this in binary:\n\n       1 = (00000000000000000000000000000001)2 <- (unsigned)\n\nNow regular signed integers need to store the negative numbers as well, but still in the same space of 32 bit. If you stored the sign, of the number in e.g. the first bit, you would loose a whole bit. That would be wasteful, e.g. the zero would have two representations as + and - zero. To circumvent this problem negative numbers in  signed integers are stored a little differently: To encode a number into a signed integer, you add halve the possible range for your 32 bit number. This is 2(32-1), and then use the regular binary representation of that new number. So a one is encoded like 2(32-1) + 1 would be for an unsigned integer. We have:\n\n 2(32-1) = (11111111111111111111111111111111)2 <-signed\n         ...\n         1 = (10000000000000000000000000000001)2 <- signed\n         0 = (10000000000000000000000000000000)2 <- signed\n        -1 = (01111111111111111111111111111111)2 <- signed\n         ...\n-2(32-1) = (00000000000000000000000000000000)2 <-signed\n\nNow you have encoded the same number of integers, but the maximum for signed integers is consequently only 2(32-1) as opposed to double that, 232-1, for unsigned integers. This is called excess-K or offset-binary representation for negative numbers. Most systems use the Two's complement, where the first, most significant bit is reversed.\nTo see this, set x=-1; and then printf(\"%u\",x). You will get the following output:\n\n2147483648\n\nWhich is 232-1 or (01111111111111111111111111111111)2 in binary notation. For the Two's complement this number would be:\n\n4294967295\n\nOr 232-1. This equals (11111111111111111111111111111111)2 in binary, so it has the first bit reversed compared to the above excess-K value of 2147483648.\nSo this is how the data is stored. Pointers come into play when you think of the where. The physical bits in the memory must have addresses. Since there are incredibly many of them you address them in chunks of more then one bit. If you create a pointer, the physical memory at the address of the pointer holds another address in memory. So a house is a physical object, much like a bit in your PC's memory. A piece of paper would be a pointer. It is smaller than the house, but can hold the address of a house or other houses. In that analogy, above you would have tried to demolish the piece of paper instead of the actual house and it was actually a mountain...\n", "Q: How to become active directly an open app?

You might need more if you're doing Linux kernel development or planning on using \"suspend to disk.\" But if you are not a very experienced Ubuntu/Linux user, as long as you accepted the value suggested by the installer, you should be ok.

It requires a little trial and error, but it seemed to work for me.  I haven't been able yet to get the virtualbox drivers to compile properly yet upon installation, so I wouldn't mind a hand if someone gets this to work for them.  NOTE:  I had to intentionally break some of my reference links to post this because I don't have enough rep points yet; I put a space near the beginning of the link, so you may need to copy/paste and edit.\nThis is from text that I was preparing to update divx118's wiki page on this; it's not 100% ready, so it's a little raw, but should be clear enough.  FOr me, when I tried this Tuesday night, HEAD~115 hit my current kernel version, but that may have changed by now, so tweak as necessary.\nAdd to the wiki page:\nhttps://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/wiki/Build-kernel-headers-and-install-Virtualbox-%28x86%29/_edit\nNext, we need to determine the version of the kernel we're currently running.\n$ uname -r\n\nThen clone the kernel branch chromeos-[version] to our home folder.\n$ cd ~\n$ git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/kernel -b chromeos-[version]\n\nFor example, [version] may be 3.18 or some other value; see the value returned by uname above to determine this.  Then we may need to download the correct revision of the kernel source from the git repository, if the downloaded source version doesn't match that of what we're currently running, by rolling back to a previous commit.  First, determine the kernel version for the source we just downloaded:\n$ cd kernel\n$ ./chromeos/scripts/prepareconfig chromeos-intel-pineview\n$ make oldconfig\n$ make kernelrelease\n\nIf the version from the uname command above does not match what is displayed, and is indeed a later version, then one can do the following to download an earlier version:\n$ git reset --hard origin/chromeos-3.18\n$ git checkout HEAD~[number of commits prior to current version]\n$ ./chromeos/scripts/prepareconfig chromeos-intel-pineview\n$ make oldconfig\n$ make kernelrelease\n\nOne may need to repeat the above steps a number of times, each time increasing the commit number in brackets, to get back to the appropriate version of the kernel source, and some trial and error may be needed to find your matching version.  Once the correct version has been retrieved:\n$ git reset --hard origin/chromeos-3.18\n\n... to clean up after ourselves.\nHow to get rid of the -dirty tag when compiling kernel source:\nhttp://arago-project.org/pipermail/meta-arago/2013-January/000795.html\nhttps://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/chromium-os-reviews/qg1i7ptQX80/AYdUWC7zGZsJ\nBasically, edit base.config and change LOCALVERSION_AUTO to N.\n\nA: With --kernelsourcedir /d you are pointing the script towards /d which doesn't exist.

You can use it for many things such as Changing your machine's IP address.\n\nIfconfig is used to configure the kernel-resident network interfaces. \n  It is used at boot time to set up interfaces as necessary. After that,\n  it is usually only needed when debugging or when system tuning is\n  needed.  Mark an interface \"down\".  When an interface is marked\n  \"down\", the system will not attempt to transmit messages through that\n  interface.  If possible, the interface will be reset to disable\n  reception as well.1\nrfkill is a small tool to query the state of the rfkill switches,\n  buttons and subsystem interfaces.

When I installed Ubuntu on my laplet (Tabtop?), I very explicitly selected my USB drive as the destination for GRUB. The laptop is natively a Windows 8 machine, and the idea was to not even touch the native bootloader, and instead have the machine boot to Ubuntu whenever I had my USB drive plugged in. Should work in theory.\nNaturally, post installation, I tested this by removing the USB drive, and sure enough GRUB fired right up. Adding insult to injury, GRUB isn't able to boot Windows 8 at all, leaving me with an Ubuntu-only machine on a primarily touch-based device. Not fun.\nI'm pretty sure I can figure out how to get Windows fixed; my issue is that it shouldn't have happened in the first place. Did I miss some magic checkbox in the installer? Is the installer perhaps bugged? (This was Ubuntu 12.10 btw.) There's a step in the installer where you select the destination for GRUB, and I checked and double checked that I had selected my USB drive (The same drive the installer itself was running from) for the install and it didn't complain. I'm not sure what I did wrong.\n\nA: When you insert the installation medium for Ubuntu (e.g: USB Stick, CD-ROM), you will see an option to 'Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8'. You also need to create a swap partition to be able to use Ubuntu. Look it up on YouTube. \nHowever, it has recently been highlighted that Microsoft has disapproved other bootloaders which are not their own. However, they have been fined for this by the European Commission due to stifling compedition  and now have to allow different operating systems to be installed.\nHope that answered your question :)\n", "Q: How to remove typed-in URLs from browser history in Firefox? I know I can remove visited pages from the history via History→Show all History, and simply mark the unwanted entries plus hit the Delete key. But this seems not to remove the URLs I've typed into the address bar when calling up those pages. So they are still used to predict the URLs I want to type in later. Especially with sites one heavily frequents (like here on the StackExchange network), this clutters up the list of suggested URLs.\nIs there any way to remove the \"typed URLs\" from the browser history completely? Preferable with some easy clicks for the end-user -- but I wouldn't mind doing so via command-line if necessary (e.g. modifying Firefox's sqlite databases directly).\nEdit: Thanks to Dan's answer a part of my issue is explained -- and I found out I missed to fully describe it. Until reading Dan's explanations, I didn't see some of the details.\nSo let's say I've visited http://readwrite.com/somearticle and http://readwrite.com/otherarticle. And of course a lot of other pages having an \"r\" somewhere in their URL. Now, on an empty urlbar, I type an \"r\". Immediately, auto-complete fills that up with \"readwrite.com\" (not one of the full URLs), and the drop-down shows a bunch of other pages (but none from readwrite.com).\n\n\n*\n\n*Dan's first method doesn't work, as the auto-completed string is not contained in the dropdown\n\n*Dan's second suggestion (switching auto-complete off altogether) is no option for me, I just want to get rid of some specific \"suggestions\"\n\n*I have no matching bookmark (to be more specific: none for readwrite.com)\n\n\nSo how to get rid of that \"readwrite.com\" suggestion? I've checked the entire history and made sure there's no entry left for it. I've also checked my bookmarks, no traces there either.\n\nA: As all things accessible via Firefox's default interface seemed to fail, I decided to take the \"deep-dive\" approach. So I installed the SQLite Manager plugin, opened the places.sqlite file from within my firefox user profile directory (Menü: Database → Connect Database), and checked the moz_places table (select it in the left pane of SQLite manager) via the search function (in the big right pane: Tab Browse and Search, there the \"Search\" button) for the \"offending\" url. The corresponding SQL-Statement (for the Execute SQL tab) would have been:\nSELECT * FROM moz_places WHERE url LIKE '%readwrite.com%';\n\nFor users prefering the graphical way:\n\nScreenshot of the search filter (click image to enlarge)\nAs it turned out, there was exactly one hit with a full URL, which did not show up when filtering the browser history/bookmarks! So I took the freedom to delete that record, and tried my urlbar again: Yeah, looks like that solved the issue! But why so difficult, Mozilla?\nEDIT: Keep in mind that \"operating directly at the heart\" you might \"kill the cat\". Be careful modifying Firefox' databases directly -- or you might end up with inconsistent bookmarks or worse! Always cross-check before deleting, for example.\n\nA: When you've typed an URL into the address bar, and the autocomplete popup is visible, highlight an URL in the list and press Delete. That will stop that URL being suggested again for any query. If there are many similar URLs you want to get rid of, you might need to backspace the last character and type it again to refresh the list.\nNote: This doesn't work on bookmarked URLs. Hitting Delete removes them from the list while it's open, but the bookmark will be suggested again next time you type a similar URL. If that causes you a problem: on the Options dialog, on the Privacy tab, there's an option to make it only suggest from history, not bookmarks.\nThere's also another kind of autocomplete, where a domain name appears inline in the address bar itself (not in the autocomplete list) as you type. It only completes the domain name, not the whole URL, so it doesn't cause the \"too many completions for stackoverflow.com\" problem you describe.\nThe suggestions come from the same list, so if you delete all the autocomplete items for a domain and you don't have any bookmarks for that domain, it won't suggest that domain inline either. This can be quite tricky to arrange, as in your example, if you type \"rea\" and it completes readwrite.com but the list is full of pages about \"reanimation\". In that case, you need to let it complete readwrite.com by pressing End (not Enter), and then backspace the last character to refresh the list. Then only the readwrite.com entries will show in the list, and you can delete them in the same way. Again, if there are lots of entries, you might need to backspace the m to refresh the list.\nYou can disable just the inline-autocomplete feature by going to about:config and setting browser.urlbar.autoFill to false. That setting doesn't affect the drop-down list of suggestions, only the inline suggestion.\n\nA: Problem\nThis is a bug in Firefox, specifically bug #932036.\nThe answer by Dan Hulme describes how Firefox is supposed to work. Unfortunately, this does not always actually work, even when pressing End and then Backspace (no dropdown ever shows up). Even if you have no History, Bookmark, or drop-down items from that domain, the autocomplete will still suggest domains that you visited in the past.\nThe reason is that in some cases URLs are not removed from the places.sqlite file in your Firefox profile directory, even if you clear the complete history.\nSolution\nAccording to the bug report linked above, this means that your places.sqlite database is corrupted. The recommended approach is to delete the places.sqlite file altogether. This should prevent the bug from occurring again on your installation in the future.\n\n\n*\n\n*This will cause you to lose all your browsing history, so be careful!\n\n*Quit Firefox\n\n*Then, delete (or better yet move it somewhere safe) places.sqlite. The file is usually located at ~/.mozilla/firefox/<randomnumbers>.default/places.sqlite\n\n*Also remove the places.sqlite-shm and places.sqlite-wal files.\nYour bookmarks should still be there, but your history will be gone. The bookmarks will be restored from the latest automatic backup that Firefox made (in the bookmarkbackups folder), so very recent additions will be lost. If you are afraid of losing newly added bookmarks I suggest exporting your bookmarks beforehand.\nFrom http://kb.mozillazine.org/Places.sqlite#Deleting:\n\nIf you suspect that the file is corrupted, deleting \"places.sqlite\" will delete your browsing history, and a new, empty file will be created automatically. In Firefox 3 and SeaMonkey 2.1 and above, places.sqlite will be rebuilt using the latest dated JSON file from the bookmarkbackups folder; if no JSON backup exists, bookmarks will be imported from bookmarks.html, if found.\n\nNot recommended (see bug report)\nIf you want to take a risk you can also modify the places.sqlite file directly. Do note that with this approach it is likely that the bug will reoccur. That said, you can use the SQLite Manager plugin recommended by the answer by Izzy to edit the moz_places and moz_hosts table and remove the entries containing the URLs manually.\nYou can search for the URLs as follows (replace example.com as appropriate):\nSELECT * FROM moz_places WHERE url LIKE '%example.com%';\n\nand \nSELECT * FROM moz_hosts WHERE url LIKE '%example.com%';\n\n\nA: I know this is an old thread, but the problem has been annoying me, and the solutions mentioned either didn't work or seemed too complicated.  I found that if you open your History, search for the URL you want to remove, then DELETE THE PAGE from your history, it will no longer show up when you start typing its URL. Seems simple enough for me, but it's not all that obvious. It would be nice if you could just right-click on the URL suggestions and delete them, instead of having to delete them from your browsing history.\n\nA: I had the same annoyng issue, everytime I start typing ww..... then the stored web adresses appear... not serious, but very VERY annoying.  I use Firefox.\nI went onto the Firefox website and looked in HELP, I finally solved this.\n\n\n*\n\n*In the URL bar type : About:config  (and promise to be carefull !)\n\n*locate : Browser.urlbar.default.behaviour  (this value is probably 0)\n\n*double click this, so that you can modify it, and change the 0 to 33.\n\n*close this page\nYour problem should be solved, it did for me.\n\n\nThank you Firefox !\n\nA: I found the solution here (dangowan's answer)\nI hope it works for you\nps.: sorry my poor English :(\n", "Q: Create database I want to create database.

I specifically wanted it in a specific position on the window, and with no window borders (surprisingly, there's no easy option for this in gnome-terminal, unlike xfce4-terminal).\nAfter a bunch of googling and trying about 10 methods that didn't work, I ended up with the following scripts, in bash and python.\nMy executable bash script, which I placed in $HOME/bin :\n#!/bin/bash\n\nflags[0]=\"--hide-menubar\"\nflags[1]=\"--geometry=80x54+0-0\"\nflags[2]=\"--window-with-profile=default2\"\nflags[3]=\"--working-directory={$HOME}\"\n\ngnome-terminal ${flags[@]} -x bash -c 'sleep 5 ;{$HOME}/bin/undecor.py ;bash'\n\nThe corresponding executable python script, in the same directory :\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport gtk.gdk\n\nroot_window = gtk.gdk.get_default_root_window()\nroot_xid = root_window.property_get(\"_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW\")[2][0]\nw = gtk.gdk.window_foreign_new(root_xid)\nw.set_decorations(False)\ngtk.gdk.window_process_all_updates()\n\nI put the flags in an array in the bash script just so I could easily tell what was going on if I need to edit the particular arrangement later. Note: I'm doing this in python 2.7.3 .

When I installed Ubuntu, I did it alongside of\nexisting Vista.  (Before that, a friend partitioned my HD to make room).\nIm so satisfied with Ubuntu that I'm getting rid of Vista gradually.\nCurrently, Vista is taking up 80G and 50G is free. Another 80G or so is allocated for Ubuntu.  \nNow, its mechanism: Am I right to visualise that in my computer, Vista and Ubuntu\nare like two separate rooms next to each other; so, if you clear out one room, that \ndoes not make room for the other room?  Or, is this still one room so that as I keep downloading with Ubuntu, it would make use of the free 50G space in Vista section automatically?\nIs getting rid of the partition wall advisable (now that I have successfully installed\nUbuntu)? if possible?  Or is the partition still of some use? Thank you for your advice in advance.\n\nA: You are partially correct. You can think of Vista and Ubuntu as separate rooms. But say if you remove Vista you will be able to use newly freed space without any issue. Now it's upto you about what file system to use for this newly freed space. You can either use NTFS or EXT3 (or any Ubuntu supported format).\nAnd I think, you can combine partitions wall as well if partitions belong to same group (Primary or Logical).

Since you only want to do this on one file at a time, it would be easier to just use find.  If you want to recursively do this, I'd do find . -iname '*.pdf' -exec pdf3djvu -o '{}'.djvu '{}' \\;  If you have only certain directories you want to do this in, come up with shell wildcard which expands to those directories, and use that as the argument to find instead of ..  For example, if you have several directories which end with \"djvus\" (like \"pie_djvus\" and \"flag_djvus\"):\nfind ./*djvus/ -maxdepth 1 -iname '*.pdf' -exec pdf3djvu -o '{}'.djvu '{}' \\;\n\nUsing the / after the glob ensures that the glob will only match directories, and specifying the maxdepth of 1 ensures that the find won't go more than one level deep in the directories specified (which is the top level)\nIn both cases, you're going to end up with things like \"file.pdf.djvu\", which may or may not be annoying to you.  So there will be a second post-processing step necessary if you used find.  Here's one way to do it if you're using a recent bash as your shell (some shells will split filenames up on spaces, which will break this - but current bash does not).\nfor F in *.pdf.djvu; do mv -v \"$F\" \"${F%.pdf.djvu}.djvu\"; done\n\n", "Q: unable to find Windows files using Ubuntu I'm using a Samsung rv520 i3.

No problems with the SSH or functionality, however...\nI'm trying to set up an sftp-only (no shell) user on the gateway machine for external (outside the cluster) file transfers to the gateway machine. I created a new group and user following the guide here (http://blog.swiftbyte.com/linux/allowing-sftp-access-while-chrooting-the-user-and-denying-shell-access/), and edited the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file as appropriate. However, when I restart the ssh server, the gateway machine is no longer accessible through SSH or SFTP. Any attempt is met with a \"connection refused\" message. If I switch back to the original sshd_config file, I can connect again.\nIs there any known issue with setting Subsystem sftp internal-sftp that causes SSH functionality to disappear? Or any suggestions for something I might be missing?\nMy sshd_config file addition is as follows:\nSubsystem sftp internal-sftp\nMatch Group sftponly\n   ChrootDirectory %h\n   X11Forwarding no\n   AllowTcpForwarding no\n   ForceCommand internal-sftp\n\nMy sftp-user has their home directory specified on an external drive that is auto-mounted at boot. Their home directory has root ownership and 755 permission.\n\nA: It turns out that the Match Group block of code must be inserted at the end of the sshd_config file. Many guides don't explicitly state this and so I overlooked it and thought the code belonged together with the Subsystem line. SSH works fine again; SFTP, however, still isn't connecting (giving a \"broken pipe\" error).\nSFTP issue resolution: The external drive is mounted to /mnt/DATA/ with 777 permissions so that everyone can read/write to it. I created a sub-directory /mnt/DATA/sftp/ for the sftp user with 750 permissions and root-ownership which I thought would be sufficient. Unfortunately, sftp requires the entire directory structure to have root/750, including the /mnt/DATA/ directory. So sftp works, but I can't let physical users create new folders inside the base /mnt/DATA/ directory now. Not 100% what I want, but at least it's a step in the right direction.\nAnswer posted by OP in comments\n\nA: Sorry, I can't comment to your message so then that way.  You are setting a standard SFTP group which can connect through SFTP.  I noticed that after putting a SSH user into the SFTP user group ubuntu automatically changes the chroot look-up and deny further SSH access.  Just pure SFTP access is possible then and jailed to the usermod -d folder.  Removing the user from that SFTP group allowed SSH login again.\n", "Q: Accidentally disabled my Samsung HM1200 bluetooth headset and can't enable it again So I was setting up my bluetooth headset to my Ubuntu 12.10 desktop just for kicks, and I made a mistake. In Sound Settings under the Output tab, I changed the \"Mode:\" to \"off\". The headset has now disappeared from the sound settings entirely, however it is still connected to bluetooth.

Not sure if that can be easily fixed.

As soon as we had enabled another profile, e.g. \"a2dp\", or \"hsp\" it comes back as a selectable device for Output.\nTroubleshooting:\nIf this is not the case with your headset there may be an issue with the device's firmware. You may try the following steps:\n\n*\n\n*reset pulseaudio with the following command:\n  pulseaudio -k\n\n\n\n*Delete ~/.pulse:\nAll user setting which may interfere here are stored in ~/.pulse. It is safe to delete this directory if you had not used it for custom settings files.

I'm very new at this, so thanks for your help.\n\nA: This can be configured via php.ini but by default it will use sendmail Most MTAs replace the sendmail binary with their own copy, so whatever package is providing the sendmail binary is the one that php is using, providing you made no config changes. \nAs a side not do not install multiple MTAs. There's almost no away they will all work.\n\nA: You can't have multiple MTAs installed, only one can provide /usr/sbin/sendmail at a time. You can set the path to the MTA in the php.ini, by the sendmail_path option, in case it's installed somewhere else, or you want to use it with different parameters than the default. If you install postfix, sendmail will be removed and postfix will provide /usr/sbin/sendmail.\n", "Q: Can not remove directory on NTFS partition I am using dual operating system on a single machine- windows and ubuntu. \nThere is a folder in windows C:\\ProgramData\\Folder_name which seems to be a virus to me, as it does not get deleted whenever I try to.

Other flavors have different support so...\nWhat if I install Ubuntu first, then I install lubuntu-desktop (which has shorter support time)? \nWould the DE independent parts (eg. the kernel, core drivers, Firefox (because it uses xul)) of the system still get updates for 5 years, even if I use LXDE instead of Unity?\n(I'm still use 10.04 LTS Desktop, but since it will be trashed soon, I'm planning to upgrade.)\nSo clarifying the question a bit with an example:\nIf I install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I will get:\nLinux kernel + core stuff + Gnome3 + Unity => 5 years of support.\nIf I install Lubuntu 12.04 I will get:\nLinux kernel + core stuff + LXDE => 6 months (?). \nSo I install Ubuntu 12.04 first, I have:\nLinux kernel + core stuff + Gnome3 + Unity, then I remove Gnome and Unity, then do an apt-get install lubuntu-desktop. So I will have \nLinux kernel + core stuff + LXDE again. Now would I have 5 years supprt time because I installed the Ubuntu LTS first or just 6 months because I cannot cheat the system?\nBy support time I mean the repositories are alive, I get security patches, Firefox updates, etc.\n\nA: Is not something that can be accumulated or subtracted from. If you install for example Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Xubuntu....Somebuntu...Anybuntu. Each will get the support they offer for the time they offer for that particular version (Including Desktop Environments, Libraries and any other core part of the distribution).\nSo you would get 5 years for an LTS of Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Xubuntu....\nAnd you would get the years/months set for a non LTS version.\nWhen the time comes, the versions or distributions with less time will simply stop receiving updates. This is what is called an EOL (End of Life) Support. For example, if you had right now the following Ubuntu versions:\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 8.04 Server (Gnome)\n\n\n*Lubuntu 10.04 Desktop (LXDE)\n\n\n*Ubuntu 10.04 Server (Gnome)\n\n\n*Xubuntu 11.10 Desktop (XFCE)\n\nLooking at the image, when May 9th comes, all versions except Ubuntu 10.04 Server will still get updates. You will stop receiving any updates of any kind, including Desktop Environment updates. The rest will simply enter their EOL time, meaning they will not get any new updates (Except in very rare, security related cases and even then it is very rare indeed).\nNow let me show you another case. You have 10.04 LTS. And you install LXDE, XFCE, Gnome, Gnome3, Gnome4, Gnome5, Unity 2010 Elite Edition, Wayland Super Mario version and any other Desktop Environment you can get your hands on for the 10.04 LTS version. When May 9th comes, they will all stop receiving upgrades. 10.04 will simply enter the EOL support. This is why, many times, Ubuntu developers recommend to upgrade, so you can get all the benefits of new kernels, new drivers, new hardware support, new fixes and technologies, etc..\nChecking your edit  in the question out:\n\nIf I install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I will get:\nLinux kernel + core stuff + Gnome3 + Unity => 5 years of support.\nIf I install Lubuntu 12.04 I will get:\nLinux kernel + core stuff + LXDE => 6 months (?).\nSo I install Ubuntu 12.04 first, I have:\nLinux kernel + core stuff + Gnome3 + Unity, then I remove Gnome and\nUnity, then do an apt-get install lubuntu-desktop. So I will have\nLinux kernel + core stuff + LXDE again. Now would I have 5 years\nsupport time because I installed the Ubuntu LTS first or just 6 months\nbecause I cannot cheat the system?\n\nIn all cases, you are still sticking with 12.04. Does not matter which Desktop Environment you use, you are still staying with 12.04, which means you will still get 5 years.\nThe years of support are not based on Desktop Environment in use, Specific libraries or any apps installed, they are based on the Ubuntu version and if it is Desktop or Server Edition.\nIf you install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, remove Unity and install LXDE/Gnome 3/XFCE or any other, you will still get updates for other parts of the system. Not only that, but if there is any security issues related to the DE, you will get that also even if the support time is gone, as long as you stay with an LTS. The only thing you will not get is a version upgrade for them. Like going from Gnome 3.6 to 3.8.\nI would also like to add that if you are going to be changing the DE, then there is less of a need to stay in an LTS. Upgrading the version every time a new comes out is the best choice for you. This way you get the latest DE, drivers, libraries and core updates. LTS are more oriented toward servers and users that do not want/like to be changing version or simply want a long support without changing their system so much (Because they want stability over customization). If you like to test out each DE, I would recommend sticking with the new version each time it comes out.\n\nA: DE is not related to support time.  As long as you don't release-upgrade you should be fine.  \nFleshing in some detail from the comments:\nIf you install supported/official window managers from derivatives (e.g. xfce, lxde, etc) you could expect some support.  \nIf you installed some oddball/weird window manager (i3 and run each app on a separate desktop fullscreen) then the core would have support, but you shouldn't expect non-core support.  \nI would anticipate the default WMs from official derivatives and anything in the server core repos to get support.  I would not expect software from multiverse or ppa to get support.\n", "Q: How to rename partitions? I'm new at Ubuntu; I installed Ubuntu 12.10 and the partitions appear like 30 GB volume and like 78EF-2C5E in task bar. I tried to rename it but rename and remove buttons are deactivated so I tried by using disks but it gives me error:\n(Error setting label: Command-line `mlabel -i \"/dev/sdb8\" ::\"windows\"' exited with non-zero exit status 1: Total number of sectors (18550784) not a multiple of sectors per track (63)!\nAdd mtools_skip_check=1 to your .mtoolsrc file to skip this test\n (udisks-error-quark, 0))\n\nand this happen also to any attached usb to my laptop.\n\nA: The easiest way to rename a partition is to install GParted.\nsudo apt-get install gparted\nOnce you have installed this, just launch the program (you will need to enter your sudo password to use the program), find the drive you want to rename, unmount it, click label followed by renaming your partition. You can then just mount your partition again and all should be sorted.\nYou may find it easier/safer to use a Live CD rather than just via the program itself. As with anything, please remember to back up your data first as you never know, you may run into a bug which causes you to lose data! Thankfully, GParted is a recognised and fairly safe way to deal with partitions.\nFor more information on what to do, please see this website.\n\nA: From the graphical desktop ( >= 12.10)\nThere is no need to run gparted only to give a partition a label. Just open Disks from the Dash:\n\nSelect the drive on the left panel and choose the partition to label in the volumes section. Then click on the highlighted area with the cogwheels for \"More Actions\" to reveal the menu shown above. This will let you \"Edit Filesystem Label...\" for the selected partition.\n\nFrom the graphical desktop ( <= 12.04 LTS)\nFor release 12.04 LTS and earlier the application Disk Utility can be used for editing partition labels:\n\n\n\nNote: after we had changed a label we may have to edit our fstab with the new label in case we mount disks by label.\n\n\nFrom the command line\nReplace /dev/sdxN with your partition (e.g. /dev/sdc1).\n\n*\n\n*for FAT32:\n  sudo mlabel -i /dev/sdxN ::\"my_label\"\n\nor:\n  sudo fatlabel /dev/sdxN my_label\n\n\n\n*for NTFS:\n  sudo ntfslabel /dev/sdxN my_label\n\n\n\n*for exFAT:\n  sudo exfatlabel /dev/sdxN my_label\n\n\n\n*for ext2/3/4:\n  sudo e2label /dev/sdxN my_label\n\n\n\n*for BTRFS:\n  sudo btrfs filesystem label /dev/sdxN my_label\n\n\nA: I have recently confronted with the same problem as yours. I am using Zorin, an Ubuntu-based distro, and, every time when I have some problem to solve I turn to the Ubuntu or Linux Mint community in order to find the answer. \nFor me, the solution was easier than using gparted. I have used Disk Utility, which is pre-installed. \nStart - All Applications - Accessories - Disk Utilities\nOnce opened, you click on the hard drive listed in the left side of the window, and you can see the partitions in the right side of the window. Click on every partition in order to select it (it will turn blue) then, in order to change the name click on the button named \"Edit Filesystem Label\", and thus you will be able to rename the partition. Do this operation with every of them. \nNote that, if you are running Windows on your computer along with Linux, you will notice that the new label will show in windows too.\nI hope this helps. (If not for you, then to other users of ubuntu-based distros.)\n\nA: In my Kubuntu 16.04, first 'unmount the partition' in KDE Partition Manager then right click->Property, then change label name. \n\nA: Seeing an error like this while renaming ntfs partitions?\nVolume is scheduled for check.\nPlease boot into Windows TWICE, or use the 'force' option.\nNOTE: If you had not scheduled check and last time accessed this volume\nusing ntfsmount and shutdown system properly, then init scripts in your\ndistribution are broken. Please report to your distribution developers\n(NOT to us!) that init scripts kill ntfsmount or mount.ntfs-fuse during\nshutdown instead of proper umount.\nTry this sudo ntfslabel --force /dev/sdxN new_label\nNote: sdxN refers to your corresponding ntfs drive.\n", "Q: How do I create a custom config file in xboxdrv?

I have tried \"Opera > Settings > Preferences > Advanced > Programs > Add > Protocol\" and typed \"magnet\", but I don't know what to put in \"Open With Other Application\". I don't want to install a Bittorrent Client. How does this work? \n\nA: When a web browser opens a magnet link, that causes it to open the application needed to access the content offered through the link. For bittorrent magnet links, it opens your bittorrent application,\nSo configuring Opera for magnet links does not eliminate the need to have a bittorrent client. You need one, unless Opera is able to act as a bittorrent client itself. I do not believe this is the case, though it's imaginably possible that such a feature could be added in a later version. (You would still not be able to open a torrent magnet link without a bittorrent client though; this would just mean that your web browser was also your bittorrent client.)\n", "Q: How can I fix the missing /NST/AutoNeoGrub0.mbr error on Windows 8?

Open a text editor and make a new document. Save it to your home folder as the name of your command (example: mycommand). Then in the document enter the following\n#!/bin/bash\ncd \"/home/owner/.wine/dosdevices/c:/Program Files/Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS/system\"\nWINEDEBUG=+ntdll wine \"rads_user_kernel.exe\" run lol_launcher $(ls ../projects/lol_launcher/releases/) LoLLauncher.exe\n\nSave it. Now open Terminal and do the following:\nchmod +x mycommand\nsudo cp ~/mycommand /usr/bin/mycommand\n\nNow just restart the Terminal or enter the command bash. You should now be able to run your custom script at anytime by using it's name (example: mycommand)\n\nA: Not sure what you mean by shortcuts. I think you mean bash aliases. If so, add these lines to your $HOME/.bashrc:\n\nalias league='cd \"/home/owner/.wine/dosdevices/c:/Program Files/Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS/system\"'\n  alias lol='WINEDEBUG=+ntdll wine \"rads_user_kernel.exe\" run lol_launcher $(ls ../projects/lol_launcher/releases/) LoLLauncher.exe'\n\nYou can now run these ciommands by opening a terminal and typing league or lol.

My computer is dual booting windows 7 and ubuntu (12.04). My ubuntu partition has an encrypted root and home. The trouble is that for a while the /root partition has been almost full (94% to 98%. I haven't been able to run updates without being very selective because of the lack of space.I try to clean up the root directory, but it never clears up more than 100 or so mb of memory. The /root partition has 5.5GB of space, which is apparently not enough, although it is more than what was recommended by a guide I originally used. Basically, I have tons of free space on my /home and I'd like to shrink it and reallocate the free memory to the /root. I can't figure out how to deal with the resizing on encrypted partitions.\nAdditionally, I do have a good amount of completely unallocated space (about 25gb) available, so if adding some of that to the /root is an easier process, then some instruction on that would also be really helpful. I'm still a beginner with linux, so clarity and details (& explanations) would be much appreciated.\nLastly, I've gone through the ResizeEncryptedPartitions post, but had trouble with adding the free space to the encrypted partition.\n\nA: My recommendation is do do this in three steps. \nFirst, decrypt your home partition.\nSecond, resize per usual\nThird, re-encrypt your home partition.\nTechnically speaking the box-unbox is not needed, but should something go wrong you have a better chance of recovery. \nHere is the semi-offical documentation. Note that it does not state that you have to decrypt first. That is just a personal preference of mine. \nSo on a higher level. You want to resize home smaller and resize root larger. It's pretty straight forward. Again I prefer to decrypt - encrypt, but that basically just means copying files to a temp partition and then copying back to the new larger (or in this case smaller) partition. Again that's completely tase and if you follow the documents you should have probably be ok. \nThis is what I would do\n 0. Make a full backup  (you already have this right)\n 1. Create a large enough temp  ext3 partition somewhere like a USB hard drive, and copy over everything in home with sudo cp /home/ /tmp/partition/ -R\n 2. Delete your home partition\n 3. Resize your root partition\n 4. Create a new home partition in the left over space\n 5. Copy the files from /tmp/partition back to /home\n 6. You may have to fix permissions, it depends.  \n", "Q: Windows 8 not booting from grub 2 I have done a fair amount of research, and started of by disabling the secure booting UEFI settings as well as the Intel Smart boot. I partitioned the drive accordingly and when I restarted the computer it booted straight to ubuntu (which was to be expected) and after a boot-repair grub2 was working fine and showed the options for Windows 8. However, after selecting the Win8 option, my machine just hangs up at the loading screen with Sager logo. I have tried multiple resolves to no avail.\nThe Complete Log URL is:http://paste.ubuntu.com/5686995/\nUpdate: I removed my second efi partition and windows is still stuck. I have tried bcdrrepair and chkdsk. I tried doing a repair with windows disk but it didnt work. I edited the grub file and manually put in a custom entry with a chainloader that should work and still no progress. When I boot it goes straight to windows RE. I check the windows syslog and get a message: a patch is preventing the system from starting up. I also tried a different bootloader suggest by a comment and the same problem occurs.\nI have a 750gb mechanical drive (SDA1) and a 256 msata (boot) \n\nA: You haven't messed anything up with the partitions, it's just that Grub has trouble chainloading Windows under EFI. Try to get to your Windows OS from the laptop boot menu, for Sager I think you press F12 when booting.\n\nA: Try installing rEFInd in Linux. Using the Debian package should set everything up to work correctly with no further effort, although you might want to remove some entries later. With any luck, rEFInd will boot either Windows or Linux with no problems.\n", "Q: Is it possible to key-bind the pasting of the x-clipboard? How?

Can ubuntu 64 bit run ubuntu 32 application?\nNow all our pcs and laptop are i7, 16GB memory.\n\nA: Yes it can. The only thing you will start seeing is that any 32 Bit app will end with \":386\". Here is an image to give you an idea:\n\nAs you can see, you ca try to install skype using the 32 bit version skype:i386). Same goes for pidgin and any other app that has a 32 bit version in a 64 bit system. Most apps do. If the 64 bit version is not available, they will most likely fallback to the 32 bit one.\n\nA: Yes, assuming the requisite 32-bit dependencies of the application are installed. There are some applications which are 32-bit only, but installable and usable on 64-bit Ubuntu, from the partner repository.\nYou can't mix architectures within the same process though, so a 32-bit program can't load 64-bit shared libraries, or vice versa.\n", "Q: Genius GX Gila Mouse So I have a Genius GX Gila gaming mouse.

Now I'm completely lost as to what to do.\nThis is what happened when I tried to get sudo working again using pkexec:\nu7ur7l3@ubuntu:~$ pkexec chown root /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so\nError getting authority: Error initializing authority: Error calling StartServiceByName for org.freedesktop.PolicyKit1: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.Spawn.ExecFailed: Failed to execute program /usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper: Success \n\nu7ur7l3@ubuntu:~$ sudo ls\nsudo: /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so must be owned by uid 0 sudo: fatal error, unable to load plugins\n\nAnd to change permissions I was using Root Actions as a dolphin service/ plugin thing, so history doesn't show me the permission changes.\nI just realized that sounds don't work at all anymore. When I go into Phonon my default settings and playback devices aren't even there. Also I don't have the option to shutdown, I can only log out or leave.\n\nA: Ownership of at least one of your important system files is wrong. That's a bad thing; if this has happened to many system files (perhaps you ran a big sudo chown command with the -R flag at some point?), it could cause a number of other system errors and instabilities. So if you recently installed Ubuntu, you might want to reinstall as Adam Heathcote suggests.\nBut you do not have to reinstall to fix this problem. Instead, just fix the ownership on that file. If you get errors about other files after that, you can fix them too (though you might have to tell us what the error messages are, so we can tell you how to fix them also).\nsudo does not work, but using sudo is one of two ways for administrators to perform actions as root on Ubuntu. The other is Polkit (which used to be called PolicyKit).\nRun this command, which uses Polkit (via pkexec) to change the ownership of /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so back to root (i.e., uid 0):\npkexec chown root /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so\n\nThen try using sudo again. You can run something trivial like sudo ls, and see if you get an error message.\nFinally, I recommend running history to reveal all the commands you've run. Hopefully that will list all the commands you've run that have changed permissions. Assuming sudo now works, I recommend posting a new question including the output of history, to get help undoing all the file ownership and permissions changes you've done.\nIf pkexec doesn't work either...\nYou tried pkexec and it didn't work. Since neither sudo nor Polkit is working to allow you to perform actions as root, you'll have to boot into recovery mode and get a root shell. To do this, hold down Shift while booting up your computer, to ensure you get a visible GRUB boot menu. Select an entry that contains the words recovery mode (generally, you should select the one closest to the top that has those words). Then you'll get a menu where you have a number of options--select the option to drop to a root shell.\nDetailed instructions on accessing a root shell in recovery mode are here:\n\n*\n\n*How do I boot into a root shell?\nOnce you have a root shell, run:\nchown root /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so\n\nIf you get an error about the file or filesystem not being modifiable, then remount it readwrite:\nmount -rw -o remount /\n\n(Source for the idea of remounting and how to do it: this mostly unrelated answer.)\nThen after running that mount command, run the above chown command again and see if it works.\nOnce you're done in recovery mode you can reboot by running:\nreboot\n\nsudo should then work, or at least give some other error.\nFinally, please note that given the errors you showed, it's likely that many files now have the wrong ownership or permissions. It would be ideal if you could figure out which files you modified in this way. For example, if you could figure out that it was all files in a couple specific folders, then it might be possible to correct the complete extent of the recent problems you've been having.\nReinstalling is definitely an option, but especially if all you changed was ownership (and not permissions, which are somewhat harder to reconstruct as they vary more), it should be possible to simply set the permissions back recursively to their original owners (probably usually root) and reverse the damage entirely.\nGetting sudo working again is a first step. Hopefully the above technique will enable you to do that.\n", "Q: Why is swappiness=10 recommended? A value of swappiness=10 is recommended in Ubuntu's SwapFaq.\nWhy is a value of 10 is recommended rather than swappiness=0?\nAre there any pros of 10 or cons of zero?\n\nA: swappiness=0 will wait to swap until it is absolutely necessary. Setting a moderate value like swappiness=10 will cause pages to be swapped from memory to disk somewhat more readily. This can prevent the need to swap a lot at once; such a need can introduce annoying delays.\nIn addition, often a process runs but does nothing for an extended time. Many daemons (background services) behave this way. You may have a background application that is left unused for a while. And these days some applications are implemented as multiple processes, like Chromium and Google Chrome, where each tab has a separate process behind it (not a separate thread, but a separate process). Setting swappiness to a value like 10 makes it so these background tasks that are not being actively used are swapped to memory even when they could remain crammed in RAM. Then when a more actively used process needs to allocate more RAM, it can do so more quickly.\nIn conclusion, allowing processes to be swapped from RAM to disk earlier than necessary often confers a performance benefit and lower latencies when a process allocates memory. This is at the expense of the time it takes to swap the processes back. But this is usually done much less frequently than a process in active use allocates and releases memory, so the trade-off is often worthwhile.\n", "Q: Will an Livecode Application Developed for Ubuntu Destop work for Ubuntu Mobile?

It's working well and I can save files on one device and instantly read them on the other. I have verified that the files are truly encrypted by trying to download them from the Ubuntu One web interface.\nThe only problem is that I am not getting notification messages from Ubuntu One when I add new files or when new files are synced. Also, there are no helpful \"Syncing\" and \"Checked\" indicators superimposed over my file's icons so I have no way of knowing when a file has finished syncing.\nHave I don't something wrong or missed something in the setup, or is this just a trade-off I have to accept if I want to use Encfs with Ubuntu One?\nIf it's the latter, are there any alternative ways of encryping on a per-file basis on Ubuntu One?\n\nA: Make sure you are looking at the encrypted folder path to see the emblems. Ubuntu One doesn't know anything about the decrypted mount, so viewing it won't show any emblems. I don't know if there's any good way to go about making that work, technically, either. It may be something that the gnome-encfs package might need to provide via a Nautilus extension, showing the same emblems on the decrypted files, that are set on the encrypted files, updating automatically.\nAs for the notifications, you should be getting them, but they will have the names/paths of the encrypted files, which may also be confusing you if you're expecting the decrypted file names. This is also because Ubuntu One doesn't know anything about the decrypted mount point.

On Ohloh, Ubuntu is reported as \"mostly written in C#\", and, indeed, if we go to the Ubuntu's languages summary we see that C# has the most LOCs, accounting for approximately 20% of the code base.\nIf the Ohloh's engine isn't wrong, what is the explanation of this?\n\nA: The Linux Kernel (which is the core of Ubuntu) is written mostly in C and a little parts in assembly languages. And many of the applications are written in python or C or C++. C# is not a popular language for many linux users/developers because it was meant to be used for Windows. But still you are free to use it. Its just that people mostly give preference to languages other than C#.\n   I have seen the source code of Linux kernel and I can be 100% sure that 99% is C. You can also download the source code from the official site of linux kernel. The site is http://www.kernel.org . There you will mostly see \".h\" which are referred to as \"Header\" files and \".c\" which are \"C Programming\" files.\n\nSo the article you are reading is wrong. And by wrong I mean dead wrong. Please notify the site's admin for the changes also.\n\nA: Ubuntu is definetely NOT written in C#! Ubuntu does not even (as far as i know) ship with any C# / Mono applications installed although they are available in software centre (banshee etc)\nUbuntu like most distros is made up of alot of C and C++, mix in some vala, python, perl and many others. C# is a bit of a sore point due to MS/.net connections.\n\nA: The Oloh engine is  way wrong. Ubuntu is a quite complex project, and it's difficult to state what is Ubuntu and what is not. But C# is not by any measure the most popular language.\nUbuntu has also much more than 50 contributors and 1500 commits/year even if you only count Ubuntu specific patches.\nThis site seems to follow some strange mix of Ubuntu and non-Ubuntu projects, it doesn't make sense. It's likely than F-Spot (a big program that is not in the default install base now and it's made in C#) is weighting heavy on that statistic.\n\nA: Ubuntu is a distribution containing a lot of individual projects each of which are free to use whatever language they want to implement their project.\nC++ is a quite frequent choice for programmers who need the C ecosystem but want a bit more from the language.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Network Manger keep creating Ad-Hoc Hotspot.

Currently i use my notebook hardisk (have windows 7 in it) as temp, so i still can doing work. i cannot access my own files because it is protected.\nWhat should i do? \n\nA: You need to run Windows repair if Windows XP is not booting. If your drive is encrypted or you don't have a Windows XP installation disk then you probably need to get your IT department to look at it.\nWubi not booting is one issue, but if your drive is encrypted then this is normal that it won't work. You cannot boot Wubi from an encrypted drive because Ubuntu runs natively, not under the Windows OS (which can unlock the drive).\nWindows not booting is another issue, which seems to be your real issue. It should work because Wubi doesn't change any of the boot files Windows needs. So it's hard to speculate what exactly is wrong with Windows. That's why you need a Windows repair disk.\nPlease don't try to install Grub or run boot-repair. That will be a waste of time and at best do nothing, at worst, more damage.\n\nA: You might need to recover grub.\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert your Ubuntu CD, reboot your computer and set it to boot from CD in the BIOS and boot into a live session. You can also use a LiveUSB if you have created one in the past. \n\n*Install and run Boot-Repair \n\n*Click \"Recommended Repair\". \n\n*Now reboot your system. The usual GRUB boot menu should appear. If it does not, hold Left Shift while booting. You will be able to choose between Ubuntu and Windows.\nIf this doesn't work, use the terminal way. As you are not familiar with Linux, please copy and paste the code. \nOpen a terminal. As of Ubuntu 11.10 and 11.04, this can be done by opening the Unity Dash (you can click the Ubuntu logo in the top panel or use the Windows key on your keyboard) and typing in \"Terminal\", and clicking what comes up. On earlier versions, you can achieve this by going to Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal. \n1.You are then presented with a standard bash prompt, type:\nsudo grub-install /dev/XXX\n\nwhere XXX is the device of your Ubuntu install. (eg: grub-install /dev/sdb). Hint: You can also use /dev/disk/by-label/ if the partition you installed on has a label. You can determine the /dev node for such a device by running:\nls -l /dev/disk/by-label/\n\nThis will give the output of something like:\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Oct 16 10:27 data -> ../../sdb2\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Oct 16 10:27 data2 -> ../../sda2\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Oct 16 10:27 fat -> ../../sda6\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Oct 16 10:27 home -> ../../sda7\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Oct 16 10:27 root -> ../../sda1\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Oct 16 10:27 swap -> ../../sda5\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Oct 16 10:27 windows -> ../../sdb1\n\nYou can also use sudo fdisk -l if you do not see the /dev/disk/by-label:\n$ sudo fdisk -l\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 160.0 GB, 160041885696 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 19457 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x0001bc54\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n  /dev/sda1   *           1       18725   150403072   83  Linux\n /dev/sda2           18725       19458     5884929    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5           18725       19458     5884928   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nDisk /dev/sdb: 15.1 GB, 15103033344 bytes\n64 heads, 32 sectors/track, 14403 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 2048 * 512 = 1048576 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00068852\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1   *           1       14403    14748656    c  W95 FAT32 (LBA)\n\nFrom here, find only the drive name, ignore the partition number, that is, for partitions labeled \"root\", \"data2\", \"fat\", \"home\" and \"swap\" it's all still just sda. This is due to the fact that GRUB is installed in the MBR of the drive, and not on a partition. \n\n\n*\n\n*Now reboot your system. The usual GRUB boot menu should appear. If it does not, hold Left Shift while booting. You will be able to choose between Ubuntu and Windows.\n\n\nUsing the Ubuntu Alternate CD\n1.Boot your system from the Ubuntu Alternate CD. \n\n\n*\n\n*When the Ubuntu splash screen comes up with the boot: prompt, type in rescue and press enter. \n\n*Choose your language, location (country) and then keyboard layout as if you were doing a fresh install. \n\n*Enter a host name, or leave it with the default (Ubuntu). \n\n*At this stage you are presented with a screen where you can select which partition is your root partition (there is a list of the partitions on your hard drive, so you are required to know which partition number Ubuntu is on). This will be dev/discs/discY/partX, where the X is a partition number and Y is the number of the drive. \n6.Now proceed as described in \"The terminal way\" above. \nHope this helps!!!\n", "Q: BCM 4313 proprietary driver blocks WiFi for other devices I run a home wlan and a few days ago I upgraded a hp dv7 pavilion laptop from Oneiric to Precise. I had the proprietary Broadcom STA driver (wl module) activated.\nWhenever this laptop was connected to WiFi had speedtest.net result of 8 Mbps (down) and all other machines (laptops, smartphones) could only get speedtest.net results well below 1 Mbps (mostly 500 Kbps) with severe ping problems and other bizarre effects. When the laptop was off everything was OK for the other machines.\nThinking about this a little I decided to remove the STA proprietary driver and use the opensource one. Everything works perfectly now for all the machines on the Wifi.\nI wonder if the STA driver update in precise is rotten since it appears that it transformed my machine into a WiFi jammer. Is this possible ?\nIt seems that this issue is lined to the BCM 4314 itself, not a particular laptop.\nWhat may be the possible reason for such a peculiar behavior? Can I overcome it without disabling the proprietary driver? What can I do to troubleshoot this problem?\n\nA: My guess:\nIt's not a definitive answer, but my best guess is poor broadcast power control on the closed source blob resulting in other well managed cards (hosts or AP) turning down their sensitivity so they don't get blown by the power. \nIf I'm right:\nIt sounds like a non-fixable problem since it's in the blob unless you script a bunch of power control.  \nHow could it theoretically be tested:\nIf you have three test boxes, I'ld test it like this  \n1) Install some tool that lets you see a packet's network's relative power.  \nI'm sure there's a CLI util to do it at a whack, but kismet is already installed on my laptops and gives me enough information.  \n2) With the broadcom box OFF, check the power of your box number 3 in kismet.  \n3) Next turn it off and place the broadcom box in the same location.  \n4) Check in kismet again. If my guess is right, the broadcom box should show significantly more signal strength.\n", "Q: Which email client is fast enough for a Maildir containing one million emails? I have a Maildir, which subfolders contain about one million emails. Mutt is so slow on it. Any better choice?\nPS: An email deduplicate tool contained is better.

So, pretty basic question,\nI use outlook.com for some work email, I use multiple Google Apps emails for different things.\nI don't use an email client, I just use the different webmail interfaces,\nWhat I am hoping I can find is an email notifier that can check outlook.com emails, and multiple Google Apps emails and gives me a notification?\n\nA: I would set it up like this:\nThe Google Apps Mail\nInstal unity-mail & unity-webapps-gmail\nsudo apt-get install unity-mail unity-webapps-gmail\n\nOpen Unity mail and configure it for Google Apps. Setting it up is almost the same as for a gmail account, except for the username which is your_mail@yourdomail.com\nYou can even set it up with URL so that when you click a mail under the message notification tray you will go directly to the inbox...\nThe Outlook.com mail\nUnfortunately Outlook.com does not support IMAP yet, so I would set up forwarding to a gmail account I would create only for this purpose and then set up a second account in unity mail..\nAlternatively you can use extentions for your browser:\nIf you are using chrome go for Outlok.com notifier\nAnd if you use Firefox: X-Notifier \n", "Q: Re-mounting an un-mounted USB stick Is there a way to mount back a USB stick that is once ejected, without physically detaching it and then plugging it in?\nIt was a live-usb of Linux Mint 14 in it, if it helps.\n\nA: You can mount a device by typing i.e. sudo mount /dev/sdxX /mnt (change \"xX\" to your device)\nIdentify your USB-Stick by sudo fdisk -l to know the devicename and partition number which looks like sdbxX i.e. sdb1\n", "Q: Can't remove 2 entries in the download window \n*\n\n*I started downloads of several files in Firefox.\n\n*While downloading, there was no free space left on my hard disk.\n\n*I got some error messages (with wording like \"not enough free space\" and \"cancelled download\").\n\n*I deleted all newly downloaded files (the completed and the cancelled ones) manually.\n\n\nProblem: In the download window two of these downloads are still listed and can't be removed.\n\nAs you can see on the screenshot, I can't clear the list by clicking the button in the bottom left corner (it's inactive).\nSelecting \"Pause\" or \"Cancel\" in the context menu doesn't do anything.\n\nA: I restarted Ubuntu and the problem is \"fixed\": the two entries were still listed in the Downloads window but marked as \"completed\". I wondered how this could happen and opened the download folder. And to my surprise these two files were there, fully downloaded. The timestamp of last change corresponds to the time where I restarted Ubuntu/Firefox. \nSo Firefox seems to have started the download again after restarting.\n", "Q: Cyborg M.M.O.7 Mouse Extra Buttons - No 11-mouse.conf I have a Cyborg M.M.O.7 mouse with quite a few extra buttons, and I'd like to be able to bind them to things. I've found a post here that seems to detail the process, but when I attempted to carry out the steps I noticed that there is no \"etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/11-mouse.conf\" file. I discovered that apparently later versions of Ubuntu use \"usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d\" but there is still no 11-mouse.conf file.\n# dir /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/\n10-evdev.conf         50-synaptics.conf  51-synaptics-quirks.conf\n11-evdev-quirks.conf      50-vmmouse.conf\n11-evdev-trackpoint.conf  50-wacom.conf\n\nCan I simply create this file? Will the steps stated in the post work?\nThanks,\nYM\n\nA: \nCan I simply create this file?\n\nYes. As a general rule, when a config file is mentioned and it is found missing on the system you try to edit, there's 4 possibilities:\n\n*\n\n*The system you are trying to edit was replaced by another one, e.g. RC files -> systemd\n\n*The structure changed with an update\n\n*The file is superseeded elsewhere e.g. Xorg.conf and xorg.conf.d/stuff.conf\n\n*The file is only required if you change the default configuration e.g. system/default = /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/, configured = /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/\nAs for what to put in it, this should work:\nSection \"InputClass\"\nIdentifier \"Mouse Remap\"\nMatchProduct \"Saitek Cyborg M.M.O.7 Gaming Mouse\"\nMatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\nOption \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2 9 10 11 12 0 0 0\"\nEndSection\n\nsource \nEDIT:\nI tested it with at least Gentoo (I was going to do some compiler flags testing with a new CPU and I remembered to test the mouse) and it works fine. I suppose that it works with pretty much any Linux-based Distribution.\nI hope it helps you understand!\n", "Q: multiple screens support in X server I have some basic questions about support for multiple screens in X server. Probably these are dumb questions but it would very helpful if someone could answer and also point me where I can read more about this. \n\n\n*\n\n*multiple screens in X server refers to multiple monitors or there can be one monitor with multiple views controlled by different screens.\n\n*Only xorg.conf is supposed to be changed or anything else also to achieve. \n\nA: Just as an introduction: a \"Screen\" in xorg parlance actually refers to the relationship between a Monitor (as it sounds) and a Device (usually a graphics card). Multiple screens can be bound together in a ServerLayout.\nThe best place for reading up on this sort of technical lingo is the xorg.conf man page which has had to become very verbose over the years to explain things.\nJust to confuse things, when people use \"Display\" correctly, they refer to an instance of X (aka a ServerLayout in config terms).\nMulti-head is the term used for multiple screens per display. Nvidia calls this feature TwinView but I expect that to change in time given that their newer cards (600-series) support more than two displays.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Multiple monitor\" usually means multi-head... and that's supported on single cards with multiple outputs. AFAIK you can do this on multiple devices but it's much harder (you Xinerama and that brings rendering limitations).\n\n*With the advent of randr and xrandr, you actually don't need an xorg.conf file for most things these days. The concepts are the same but the configuration can all be done by the user, without incessant rebooting. It's certainly one of my favourite improvements in the past five years.\nThe short answer to \"Can I have multiple monitors?\" is \"Yes\". You can do most things if you really want to. Multi-head on one device is the easiest so if that's what you want, just plug in the extra monitor and load up the display configuration (just like you would in Windows, et al).\nIf you want a wall of screens, you might need to battle X (and the hardware) a little more but again, completely possible.\n", "Q: VPN for university Just wondering how to get VPN working on Ubuntu 12.10 for my University because the instructions aren't very good for Linux (as usual).

It attempts to connect but just gives up in the end.\n\nA: If you use Cisco VPN you have to install the vpnc package\nsudo apt-get install vpnc\nAfter that you can use VPNC as VPN-connection in the network manager. (new VPN connection and select vpnc)\nThere you can use the gateway, your user and your password. You also will need the group name and group password. The group name seems to be linux(you can see it in your text file). And you will need to encrypt the group-password out of your text file (enc_GroupPwd). You can try to encrypt it here http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~massar/bin/cisco-decode.\nIf this doesn't work, you should try it with the Cisco Linux VPN client from your University website.\n\nA: Alternative to Ubuntu's native tools and compatible with Cisco's IPSEC client is the Shrew Soft VPN Client (free).

I want the hotkeys for play, next track, etc, but I don't want to control Audacious volume with my volume keys (which are also Fn-keys).  \nThanks  \n\nA: Took me a while to think it through but the issue is the multimedia hotkeys plugin.

I installed Ubuntu 12.10 and deleted Windows 8 in the install.  Ubuntu worked fine until I shut the PC down.  When I tried to start it again it would just go to a black screen.  If I take the battery out of the PC and put it back in and turn the PC on Ubuntu will work. \nHow do I fix this problem?\n\nA: I have a similar problem with one HP Laptop (Pavilion dv6) for more then 2 years look here. What I have discovered so far:  \n1) Buying another battery doesn't fix the problem,\n2) Taking out the battery with the cable connected also doesn't fix it,\n3) I have to be careful not to disconnect the power cable when the laptop is shutting down,\n4) I have to be super careful not to connect the power cable when the laptop is booting up (but connecting it after the boot seems ok),\n5) I got more successful boots with the power cable disconnected,\n6) I tried some grub acpi configurations without success.  \nSo I've settled.

Installation seems to work with wine but it asks to activate the product online.

I used an existing liveUSB to press install and put it on the other USB drive instead of that one). Now when I installed it, the USB drive was located in /dev/sdc, but when I try to boot from it, it is located at /dev/sdb, and I get the error /dev/sdc1 does not exist. How can that be fixed?\nIs there a way to make this work on any position (e.g. sda / adb / adc etc...)?\n\nA: You need to work with UUID's. Some time ago Ubuntu started using UUID's because it is not known in what order USB devices are mounted (1 might be mounting quicker at a given time than at another given time). \nAll you need to know can be found here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab\nTo get a list of all the UUIDs, use one of the following two commands:\nsudo blkid\nls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid\n\nExample mounting with UUID:\nUUID=3f8c5321-7181-40b3-a867-9c04a6cd5f2f  /media/data  ext3  relatime,noexec  0  2\n\nSo in short ... \n\n\n*\n\n*get the UUID \n\n*edit /etc/fstab on the USB stick\n\n*replace /dev/sdb1 with the UUID\n\n", "Q: Sluggish refresh when scroll on texteditor it's about two days that I realized that I've got a strange problem on texteditor (gedit, but also Geany and others).\nWhen I scroll the text (with mouse but also with page down/up) it didn't refresh properly.\nOnly after few clicks on it the situation return to normality.\nAll other things seems to work nicely (for example: scrolling text on LibreOffice it's not a problem).\nIt seems a GTK+ problem... but how to solve this issue?\nThanks a lot!\nUPDATE:\nIt seems that Cairo-dock it's responsable of the problem. With only unity or gnome all works fine, when I launch Cairo dock (OpenGL or not is the same) then gedit and other editors slow on refresh.\nNormally I use Cairo dock + Unity session. All worked fine and so I think that the problem starts with the latest update (some days ago).\nUPDATE 2:\nTrying to install other text editors... for example: X2 editor works fine with the same document that cause problems with gedit/geany.\n\nA: The problem has been identified, and is a bug in the Intel drivers of Ubuntu 12.04 :-)\nTake a look at the wiki: http://glx-dock.org/ww_page.php?p=Intel%20cards&lang=en#1-Visual%20artefacts%20when%20scrolling%20in%20some%20windows\nBasically, update to the latest version of Mesa, or disable the option \"display windows thumbnails\" in the Taskbar section.\n\nA: Well, according to Cairo-dock developers it seems is a bug of cairo-dock 3.2.0\nI'm not the only one with this kind of problem.\nNow they are testing a solution and patch with a 3.2.1 release.\nAt the moment, I downgrade to 3.1.2, that's work perfectly.\nBye!\n", "Q: Can't create partitions on installation Attaching a couple of screenshots to better explain.\n\n\nSo in the 1st screen, I can't click anything.

I run postfix my servers to allow websites to send email. I'm using it as a drop-in for sendmail proper.\nWhen an email is sent the HELO string seems to contain localhost. This wouldn't be a problem except that one of my clients has just said that an email was returned to them from a spam blocker saying that localhost cannot feature inside the HELO string. Awesome.\nSo I edited /etc/mailname to be my main domain name.

(on12.04) On trying to get my RTL8188CE wireless card to work reliably, I tried installing the rtl8192ce driver directly from realtek's website. However, now I got a kernel panic everytime I tried to load the driver. I was able to remove it again in safemode using realtek's make uninstall script. Now there is no driver for my card at all and it doesn't show up in network-manager any more.

Are there any changes to see for someone not playing games?\nIs the multimonitor experience better in 12.10 or 13.04?\n\nA: I don't know about multimonitor but if you want to update your catalyst drivers I would suggest that you use the repository method instead of the amd-installer one.\nSpecifically:\n1) remove the ubuntu fglrx which are currently installed:\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge fglrx*\nsudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nand reboot.\n2) Add the xorg-edgers ppa and install the latest drivers catalyst 13.2 (beta7):\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install fglrx\nsudo aticonfig --initial\n\nand reboot.\nIf you are on a true 12.04.2 ubuntu installation and thus running the Quantal kernel and xorg you can leave the ppa in your system and from now on the driver will update it self automatically.\nIf you are using the precise kernel 3.2.xx  you should remove the ppa before the final reboot because it will break your system during the next apt-get upgrade.\nTo do that simply give the command:\nsudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\n\nyou can add the repository back again the next time you'd like to update your drivers.\n", "Q: Could not locate BerkeleyDB I am trying to install a bitcoin-repote-rpc miner from [http://www.mediafire.com/file/ve608cl5mk1ka3l/bitcoin-remote-rpc-20110227-src.zip] on my laptop running on ubuntu quantal.

I thought it would be straightforward, but I'm finding lots of issues and a scarcity of help.\nLooking around I was finally able to pin-down the solution to FreeNX: it should be able to give me remote control over my machine with visual interface (not command-line). The problem is that its installation is a real hell: I tried to follow both official ubuntu documentation and different tutorials (such as this one which should be specifically tailored on Ubuntu 12.10), but I always ended up with errors and a non-functioning server.\nIs there somebody who was able to create a functioning FreeNX server on Ubuntu 12.10?

What do these two commands mean?\ncd ../\n\ncd /..\nI am ending up in two directories upwards the tree on the first command and in the root directory from the second command. Why does that happen?\n\nA: The first is a relative path.  The second is an absolute path.  \nThe .. operator in that argument means move up one.  \nThe slash when not at the front means division of sub-directory name.  \nThe slash when at the front means \"This is an absolute path.  Start at root directory.\"  The .. is discarded since you can't back out any further. (There was a time when lots of these allowed you to break chroots)  \n\nA: A / at the end of the name of a directory/folder is optional. Most of the time, including or omitting the final slash in a directory name does not change the effect of a command.\nSo cd ../ is equivalent to cd ...\nPaths that don't start with a / are relative paths; they are resolved relative to the current directory.\nEvery directory has two special entries:\n\n\n*\n\n*a directory entry called . that resolves to the directory itself\n\n*a directory entry called .. that resolves to the directory's parent (i.e., the directory that contains that directory)\n\n\nTherefore cd ../ and cd .. change directory to the parent of the current directory. Thus, if you start out in /home/fazlan and run cd .. or cd ../, you'll end up in /home.\nIn contrast, /.. is an absolute path (albeit an unusual one). / is the filesystem root--the directory you get to if you go up in the directory hierarchy all the way. (Using the same parent and child metaphor, we say / is the ancestor of everything in the filesystem.)\nSince .. means \"the parent directory of this directory\" and / means \"the top of the filesystem,\" /.. means \"the parent directory of the top of the filesystem.\"\nBut what does it mean to talk about the directory that contains /? Well, / is an exception. Since no directory contains it, we say that /'s parent is itself. Therefore, in /, .. is /. Consequently, /.. is the same as /.\nThis is why cd ../ brings you up one directory from where you started, while cd /.. brings you to the very top. More elegant and easily read ways to do these things are cd .. and cd /, respectively.\n\nA: A single dot (.) represents the current directory.  In fact, if you executed a cd . it would put you in your current directory (which would appear to do nothing).  If you were to copy something from /dir1 to your current dir, you could do it like this:\ncp /dir1/somefile.txt .\n\nExecuting a cd .. brings you up one directory level.  A cd ../ does the same.  If you wanted to go up two levels, you would add two more dots on the end, like this:\ncd ../..\n\nTo return to the root directory, you can execute a cd /.  Now let's say I executed the following:\ncd /dir1/dir2/dir3/..\n\nThat puts me in the /dir1/dir2 directory, because (as we established above) the .. tells it to go up one level.  So it goes to dir3, and then goes up.\nBy invoking a cd /.. you are telling it to go to the root directory / and then up one level, which it cannot do.  So it is effectively leaving you at the root dir, instead.\n", "Q: How to package an application icon properly? There is an blog article on ubuntu developer blog. http://developer.ubuntu.com/2012/02/how-to-prepare-a-compiled-application-for-ubuntu-software-center/\nI followed all steps exactly. But the application seems to have no icon when I search it in the dash. The dash displays only blank white icon.\nI am using Ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: The Icon field in the .desktop file, and the file name of the icon file itself, must match. As per the Icon Naming Specification, the name should be the same as the application's executable program. It should also be installed in the appropriate sizes, in the appropriate hicolor icon theme directory, as per the Icon Theme Specification.\nIt seems there is a typo in the page you link to, which says to name the icon as desktop.png instead of dungeon.png, and it also only talks about installing the single icon, and in the wrong place. This should be considered a bug in the site itself.\nIf the icons are in the correct place, and still not showing up, it is likely you need to update the icon cache for theme. You can run sudo gtk-update-icon-cache -f /usr/share/icons/hicolor to update the system hicolor theme directory cache, for example.\n\nA: To properly install an icon for an application use xdg-icon-resource. The image files must be one of the types: PNG, XPM, or SVG, and the extension must be \".png\", \".xpm\", or \".svg\" (lower case). If a corresponding .icon file exists in the same location as icon-file it will be installed as well.\nFor .svg files\nxdg-icon-resource install --novendor </location/of/your/icon.svg> <icon_name>.\nFor .png and .xpm files\nxdg-desktop-icon install --size  <16, 22, 32, 48, 64, 128, or 256> </location/of/your/icon.png>  <a_name_you_want>.\nThe default icon size launchers and menus use is 48.\nOther sources of info:\nhttp://portland.freedesktop.org/xdg-utils-1.0beta1/xdg-icon-resource.html\nhttp://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest.html\n", "Q: I can't change windows buttons to the right side with Ubuntu Tweak I am running Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal, and I have Ubuntu Tweak already installed.

Sorry if Iam wrong. However this is how I install new kernels.\nI download the deb files and cd to the directory containing them and just execute\n$ sudo dpkg -i *.deb\nWhat I have noticed is that, the new installed kernel will NOT erase the older one but only create a new entry in the boot loader and make itself default if it's newer. And if it already exists it would override it without making itself default.\n\nA: It says don't have the ncurses lib. You can do that running\n\n$ sudo apt-get install ncurses-devel\n\nProbably you'll get other warnings for other missing libraries. You need to read with attention to see what's missing and search how you can install it.\nBut I don't think it's recommendable to compile your own kernel in Ubuntu. And it's not recommendable at all to do that without using your package manager (dpkg in your case).\nIf you want to keep your installation stable I suggest you to do this in a virtual machine first.\n", "Q: Install JUnit with Oracle Java 7 already instaled I am running Ubuntu 12.10 with Oracle Java 7 installed (as described here).

You will have to simply install a new version instead, or attempt to go the unsupported path of updating directly to the newer version manually, by pointing the apt sources.list at the release you are wanting to update to, and running apt-get dist-upgrade.

For example, when I run that on my machine, I get:\nFilesystem          Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda8            15G  7.9G  6.2G  57% /\nudev                997M   12K  997M   1% /dev\ntmpfs               403M  900K  402M   1% /run\nnone                5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock\nnone               1007M  2.6M 1004M   1% /run/shm\nnone                100M   48K  100M   1% /run/user\n/dev/sda6           240M   91M  138M  40% /boot\n/dev/sda9            31G   29G  112M 100% /home\n\n(I've left out some entries representing external hard drives and network drives, which would primarily serve to confuse matters.)\nIf you have a separate /home partition listed in the Mounted on column, check if it has enough free space to spontaneously create files. Usually this doesn't have to be very much--20M is usually quite sufficient, but I recommend shooting for at least 50M. (And of course, you'd normally want much more free than that so you can download and create big files in your home directory--but as you can see, I only have a little over 100M, and I haven't experienced any problems.)\nIf you don't have a separate /home partition, then look at the free space on /.\nWhether or not you have a separate /home partition, you can make it so your home directory (/home/username) has more free space by deleting files there. Make sure not to delete anything important though! Your Downloads folder is often a good place to check for files you don't need.\nIf you don't have a separate /home partition, then you can free space in your home directory by deleting files anywhere in / (so long as the location where you remove them is not inside a mount point for something else--for example, if a separate /boot partition listed, then you cannot free space in / by deleting files inside /boot even though /boot is a child directory if /).\nGenerally, it is best not to manually delete files in / (unless they're in your home directory and you do not need them). Instead, you can free space in / by uninstalling software. However, much software in Ubuntu depends on other software, so don't press y or click OK until you've read through the list of packages that would be removed alongside whatever you've specified for removal. You can remove packages in the Software Center, the Synaptic Package Manager, or on the command-line with apt-get.\nIf you do not have a separate /boot partition (I do, as you can see above, but these days most installations do not), then since everything in /boot would then be in /, you can free space in / by deleting files from /boot. Again, don't do this manually. Instead, uninstall old kernels:\n\n*\n\n*How do I remove old kernel versions to clean up the boot menu?\nYou need to uninstall them if you want to free space, not just hide them in the GRUB menu. (Answers there explain both.) Make sure you do not remove all your kernels, because then Ubuntu will not be able to boot, and the fix for that is not very much fun.\n\n*\n\n*It's a good idea to keep at least the kernel you are currently running (as told to you by uname -r).\n\n*It's also advisable to keep one other kernel, both because the one you're currently using could have problems (which you could work around by falling back to another) and because then if you remove one more kernel than you intended, you still have one.\n\n*If you do accidentally remove all kernels but have not rebooted, you can just install a kernel back with sudo apt-get install linux-image or sudo apt-get install linux-image-generic.\n\nOnce df -h shows that at least 50M of space is free on / and, if it is listed, on /home, try logging in to an Xubuntu session again.\nTry a different display manager.\nA display manager provides the graphical login screen. A problem logging in like the one you describe could be related to a problem with the display manager you are currently using. Unless you're using a very old version of Lubuntu, you're almost certainly using LightDM as your display manager. (You can check the picture in that Wikipedia article to see if it looks like your login screen.)\nSince you have Lubuntu installed, LXDE's very own display manager is probably installed. This display manager is called LXDM (though the picture there will not necessarily look just like LXDM on your machine).\nTo make your system use LXDM instead of LightDM, run:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lxdm\n\nYou should see:\n\nWhen you see that, press Enter. (That clicks the OK \"button.\")\nThen you'll be asked to choose between the display managers that are installed on your system. Most likely there will be two choices: lightdm and lxdm. Use the arrow keys to select lxdm and press Enter:\n\nThen either reboot (properly from the power icon on the upper-right corner of the screen, or with sudo reboot) to apply the change. Or, if you prefer, apply the change in a virtual console (Ctrl+Alt+F1) by logging in and running:\nsudo stop lightdm\nsudo start lxdm\n\nWhen you run that first command, all your graphical programs will be quit immediately, even if they have unsaved work. Any unsaved work will be lost. I recommend simply logging out before switching to the virtual console (though it's the running of the commands, and not switching to a virtual console, that will terminate your graphical applications).\nOn a virtual console, you can switch back to the GUI manually by pressing Alt+F7. But when you run the above commands, you should be placed back on the (new) graphical login screen automatically.\nIf you were unable to do any of this because dpkg-reconfigure failed and said lxdm was not installed, then just install the lxdm  package. To install it from the command line, run:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install lxdm\n\nIf you install it in the command-line, it should run dpkg-reconfigure automatically. If it does not, you can still run it manually.\nHopefully, if making sure you have enough free space doesn't help, then switching to a different display manager as explained here will help. If it does not, please comment here and add as detailed information as possible to your question about what you did and what happened.\n\nA: Make sure that all files in your home directory, especially files that start with a \".\" like .Xauthority, but also .bashrc, .profile, .bash_logout etc. are owned by your user.\ncd\nls -la\n\nShould tell you all the files with their owners.\nYou can safely use a \nsudo chown $USER:$USER ~/.* -R\n\nto set all files' owner/group to you.\nThen the login via lightdm/sddm/gdm etc should work again.\n", "Q: Can't access phpmyadmin in Ubuntu 12.10 64bit after installing XAMPP I just re-installed Ubuntu because I had been playing with a driver which I shouldn't have done.\nI didn't have a backup (though I backed up the important documents etc etc) so I gotta reinstall these several applications.\nSo, I installed XAMPP and made so I could change stuff in htdocs.\nI wanted to access a database with phpmyadmin, but I couldn't access it because it says:\n\nAccess forbidden!\n\nNew XAMPP security concept:\n\nAccess to the requested object is only available from the local network.\n\nThis setting can be configured in the file \"httpd-xampp.conf\".\n\nIf you think this is a server error, please contact the webmaster.\nError 403\n127.0.0.1\nApache/2.4.3 (Unix) OpenSSL/1.0.1c PHP/5.4.7\n\n\nI've been searching on all over Google for solutions and absolutely none of them help.\nAll of them doing some minor changes in \"httpd-xampp.conf\" and it seems to work for them, but it just doesn't work for me.\nThe context I was told to change in \"httpd-xampp.conf\" look like this:\n# since XAMPP 1.4.3\n<Directory “/opt/lampp/phpmyadmin”>\nAllowOverride AuthConfig Limit\nOrder allow,deny\nAllow from all\nRequire all granted\n</Directory>\n\nand \n# New XAMPP security concept\n\n<LocationMatch “^/(?i:(?:xampp|security|licenses|phpmyadmin|webalizer|server-status|server-info))”>\nOrder deny,allow\n    Allow from all\nAllow from ::1 127.0.0.0/8 \\\nfc00::/7 10.0.0.0/8 172.16.0.0/12 192.168.0.0/16 \\\nfe80::/10 169.254.0.0/16\n\nErrorDocument 403 /error/XAMPP_FORBIDDEN.html.var\n</LocationMatch>\n\nWhat can I do to make phpmyadmin work?\n\nA: Why don't you just delete what is obviously the problem (that LocationMatch directive)?

But at this point library_fini has not been called yet!\nThis behavior is definitely a bug, either on gcc or ld.so (or whatever is using linux/ubuntu to dynamically load libraries these days). This behavior clearly is not what the standard says, because library destructors should be guaranteed to be run if the reference count is zero before dlclose returns. library destructors happen to be run after the Wrapper.instance is destroyed, which renders the library destructor completely useless, as is not able to do any finalization of the data\n\nA: This works with glibc 2.17, gcc 4.8.0 or icc 13.1 or icc 12.1:\nicc -std=c99 -nostdlib -shared test.c -o /tmp/test\n\n/* test.c */\n#include \n#include \n\nint __attribute__((constructor)) x_init(void)\n{\n    puts(\"init() works\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nint __attribute__((destructor)) x_fini(void)\n{\n    puts(\"fini() works\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nagainst:\n#include <dlfcn.h>\n\nint\nmain(void)\n{\n    void *foo = dlopen(\"/tmp/test\", RTLD_LAZY);\n\n    if (dlclose(foo) < 0) {\n        return 1;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\nAlso tested with glibc 2.10, glibc 2.12.

I have a bit of interest in developing for Ubuntu Touch (I have little to no real coding experience also), but my main interest is trying to develop a 2D game.\nFrom my understanding, I would either have to use QML for the interface + another language for the game itself, or just use another language for the interface and game, but pretty much, QML is only good for interfaces. \nIs this true? If so, what's the best choice for another programming language to learn?\n\nA: Yes, you can develop a game completely using QML. There is a Qt Quick advanced tutorial on this link (http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtquick/qtquick2-qml-advtutorial.html) that builds a game this way. \nThe new Sprite(http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtquick/qml-qtquick2-sprite.html) and AnimatedSprite elements may be very useful for you.\n\nA: It all depends on the game you're designing and what sort of graphics device you'd like to use. For example if you want to use OpenGL I would suggest using java or C++. You can develop games for ubuntu an multiple different languages but probably the best to do it in are java and c++ because they are cross platform. I know this from experience. Also check into Python, I heard it's also very useful when making a cross platform game.\nIf you're trying to make this an Online game for a networking library you can't use things such as .net and winsock you have to use a 3rd party networking library or write your own. .net and winsock are microsoft only and won't work under linux which is the main reason most games are developed in windows.\nEnjoy and goodluck on the development of your new game!\nP.S if you need an interface I suggest checking out QT or OpenGL in C++\n\nA: QML is definitely a great option for creating 2D games and can save you a lot of time and lines of code compared to other languages.\nAs an example, V-Play (www.v-play.net) is a cross platform 2D game engine based on Qt/QML with many useful V-Play QML game components for handling multiple display resolutions & aspect ratios, an entity & component system, animations, particles, physics, multi-touch, gestures, path finding and more (API reference).\nAs part of the engine download, you get 12+ sample games with full source code, which are completely written in QML. These games are real published games from the app stores. You can find the games here.\nThis proves that QML can be used for fully published and polished 2D games. And if you do need something very performance-sensitive in your game, you can just write that component in C++ and provide it as a QML component.\n\nA: This is already an older thread and I think some up-to-date answers are missing:\n\n*\n\n*You can program your game entirely in Qt Quick/QML but use a physics engine as a plugin. This is useful if your game involves moving bodies and collisions. A great physics plugin is QML-Box2D. The game qArkanoid is written this way.\n\n*If you don't need a physics engine, you can get by even with pure QML, see QML Sokoban or Dropping Letters.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Ubuntu FROM a smartphone? So, I'm in a situation were I want to install ubuntu in my laptop (currently running windows 8) but I don't happen to have pendrives, CDs or the like available. The only \"external\" device I have with me is a samsung galaxy s2 with a micro SD-card in it. \nIs it possible to use the phone as a pendrive to install ubuntu from it somehow? (without damaging the phone's OS and data)\n\nA: It is perfectly possible. You can carry multiple live CD images on your phone all the time and use them when needed, but you will need root access to your phone for that. There is an Android app called DriveDroid. DriveDroid allows you to boot your PC from ISO/IMG files stored on your phone. This is ideal for trying Linux distributions without the need to burn different CDs or USB flash drives. \nAlternatively, if your phone has mass storage emulation (Android 4 usually has NOT) AND your PC supports UEFI, then, in theory, you can place rootfs and UEFI boot partition on that emulated storage. In theory. \n\nA: Another possiblity is putting the micro SD-Card into a pluggable usb-stick with micro sd-card slot.\nI have not seen cable attached multi card readers to support booting from SD-card.\nBut with my stick and slot it is working for me!\n", "Q: Where do I find out about the details and reasons for the patches applied to a package? I am trying to build a package and I am having a problem building it.  One (or more) of the patches to doxygen installed with 12.04.1 (Precise), 1.7.4-3 causes doxygen to NOT run my filter script over by Tcl files, if the file is named with an extension of .tcl (the normal extension for Tcl files). If the extension is something else, like .src, the filter is run as expected.  I use .tcl for library or helper files that are explictly sources and .src for 'main' programs that are not.  (Yes, I have the proper file name patterns, etc. in the Doxyfiles -- my whole package builds just fine under CentOS 5 and CentOS 6, and under CentOS 5, I am even using an RPM I built of doxygen 1.7.4 (basically an unpatched version).  When I build doxygen manually without the Ubuntu/Debian patches under Ubuntu 12.04.1, it also works correctly.  The installed version does not work correctly.  I think one (or more?) of the patches breaks something in doxygen.  The changelog is not very enlightening.\nI will be creating a trivial package that illustrates the problem tomorrow.\n\nA: Firstly, the Precise default version of doxygen is 1.7.6.1-2ubuntu1, as noted at Ubuntu packages, so I'm not sure why you mention 1.7.4-3, as that is the 11.10 Oneiric default version. I should check whether you really are on Precise, or have upgraded properly.\nThe version you are using still has the doxygen_direct_dot_run.diff patch applied, while the actual version for Precise, (1.7.6.1-2ubuntu1) doesn't have it applied. So using the real Precise version might solve some of the problems as it has other patches too. There aren't any current bugs describing your issue at Launchpad, so it could be a new one.\nMore generally, patches and changelogs \nWhen you download the source (apt-get source doxygen), you can see which patches are applied (for doxygen in Precise):\ndpkg-source: info: applying manpages.diff\ndpkg-source: info: applying dot-config.diff\ndpkg-source: info: applying gcc-g.diff\ndpkg-source: info: applying doxygen-jquery.patch\n\nHowever, you can also download the program's source without the patches being applied or the packages unpacked:\napt-get source doxygen --download-only\n\n(You could build the package and omit some of the patches if you wanted to.)\nIf you have used the --download-only switch to apt-get source you will have 2 packages and a signature file. You can unpack doxygen_1.7.6.1-2ubuntu1.debian.tar.gz to view the patches, changelog, and rules (not all the patches in the patches folder will actually be used).\nThe changelog will contain references to the patches and will always include the Debian (#number) or Launchpad (LP: #number) of the bug, and this can be searched on the respective bug trackers. That is the best way to find more information on the patches than in the very brief changelog.\nExamples from the doxygen source changelog:\n\nDon't apply doxygen_direct_dot_run.diff.  Closes: #618125.\n\nNow #618125 is the debian ticket, so you can search bugs by number at debian and\nfind more details.\n\nAdd multiarch metadata to satisfy cross-dependencies (LP: #971739)\n\nSimilarly, to find more information you would search for this bug at Launchpad by entering the number.\nMore generally, you could also go to patches.ubuntu.com:\n\nThese patches are generated daily and contain the differences between an Ubuntu source package and the equivalent version of the same source in Debian.\n\nApart from discussion on the bug thread itself, on forums, or on irc channels, these avenues of investigation are about the most you can use to find out about the rationale for patches.\n\nA: OK, the problem is not Ubuntu, but doxygen itself.  It appears that doxygen 1.7.6.1 is broken in that it is not honoring filter settings for files named *.tcl, but going ahead and using its own internal parser, which is not working for my comments, since they were written with my filter in mind and were written before doxygen had any notion of dealing with Tcl source.  I will have to downgrade the version of doxygen on my Ubuntu build boxes and go bother the Doxygen people about this problem.\n", "Q: What is the difference between `command` and `./command`? I found that sometime I use the command to run a command, but sometime I use the ./command to run another command.\nWhat is the difference?\n\nA: Running xx searches the directories listed in the PATH environment variable for a file called xx. The first executable it finds (whether a binary or a script), it executes. It does not look in the current directory, unless . is listed in PATH, which is not recommended.\nRunning ./xx runs the file called xx that is located in the current directory, if there is an executable file with that name there.\nTo run a file by specifying its location, you must include a / symbol. If there is no / in the command (actually, the first word of the command, which is what identifies the name of the file to be executed), it searches PATH for it. If there is a /, then the first word of the command is taken to refer to a specific file by location.\nThus, ./xx is different from xx because of the / that it contains.\nOf course, /xx would not work properly--it would try to run a file called xx located in the root directory, /. Because . represents the current directory, ./xx runs xx there.\n\nA: ANSWERING IN SIMPLER WORDS:\nIn Shell prompt we can execute commands... The command are nothing but the name of executable file kept in particular directory such as like : bin, sbin... We can call executable files without specifying the extension name.\nuser@comp~# command\n\nWhen we enter command the file is executed kept in such particular directory.\nuser@comp~# ./command\n\nIn this case of using ./command we are calling to executable file that is kept in the current prompt path (Present working Directory). You can get to know your current working directory of shell with command pwd.\n", "Q: Has anyone installed Real Player? I have recently defected to Linux from Windows and no regret, almost...\nI sort of miss Real Player.  I have found that it IS possible to have it installed which I did through Helix Player website, but this version (RP 11 and Ubuntu 12.10) does not even play DVD.  I know RP is not supported by Ubuntu, but what does this mean exactly?  Is there any way to use Real Player with Ubuntu?\n\nA: Since the RealPlayer 11 package is already available in the ppa:michael-gruz/backports, you can proceed as follows: \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a personal PPA using your Launchpad account.\n\n*Go to ppa:michael-gruz/backports and access View package details > Copy packages. \n\n*Select the desired package (say, the one for Natty) and copy it to your personal PPA. Change Destination series to whatever you need (say, 12.10/Quantal). Ensure that Rebuild the copied sources is selected, which will allow the binaries to be built using the available libraries on the chosen distro.\n\n*Click Copy Packages.\n\n\nThese instructions are generic and will work for any package that is already available on a Launchpad PPA, and for any distribution currently supported by Launchpad. They can fail, especially if the chosen distribution does not provide a needed library or a specific version of a library. \nBut it seems to work in this case. For proof of point, check out the realplay that I copied to my testing PPA. You can check that the package was built against Quantal in View package details in the Series column. (This seems to have worked for the i386 build, but NOT for the amd64 one.)\n\nA: You can use Real Player with Ubuntu, the only thing its version 11.  To download it, click here.\nChoose your needed file.  Once downloaded, it will probably be in the downloads folder.  Navigate to the downloads folder, and right click the file, and choose open with Ubuntu Software Center, once you do that and software center opens up, just click on install.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Cannot access the hardware Last night I did a very stupid thing by changing the owner of the directory /usr using the following commands\nsu\npassword:\nchown username:username /usr\n\nNow the problem is that I cannot access the network card (i.e. I cannot access the wifi), sound card(i.e. I cannot control the sound and also the sound card is not shown in the sound settings) and also I cannot use the sudo command to gain the super user privileges.\nNeed help as soon as possible.

Unfortunately, it cannot be installed because the debian/control file contains the following dependencies:\nDepends: ... libgcc-4.7-dev, libobjc-4.7-dev ...\n\nThose packages do not exist in Quantal. The contents of those packages is contained in the gcc-4.7  and gobjc-4.7  packages instead. My problem is that I have no idea how to make the change before uploading the package to my PPA.\nI tried instructing backportpackage not to upload to my PPA and dump the files in /tmp/clang3.2 where I edited them. However, attempting to upload the package simply results in the original .tar.gz being downloaded again and overwriting my changes.\nWhat is the proper way of doing this?\n\nA: Even though there's -w option that tells backportpackage to preserve the working directory, there's still no way to tell it keep the unpacked (and modified) sources as well. So here's what worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the program locally to modify it:\ncp /usr/bin/backportpackage ~\n\n*Open the local file and find do_backport function. Its last line should look like\nshutil.rmtree(srcdir)\n\n*Delete that line, save the file, and run the script as you normally do it, make sure to provide -w option to specify the working directory.\n\n*Go to the working directory. There should be sub-directory with the name like <package>-<dist>, e.g. gcc-xenial.\n\n*cd to that directory, do whatever changes you want to do.\n\n*Make a debian package. Sign and upload the result:\ndebuild --no-lintian -S -nc -uc -us -sd\ndebsign ../<package-version>_source.changes\ndput -u ppa:<user>/<repo> <package-version>_source.changes\n", "Q: gnuplot not showing the graph window I am using gnuplot under ubuntu 12.10. When i type in terminal :\ngnuplot> plot sin(x)\n\nit only shows next step: \ngnuplot> \n\nbut it doesn't show the graph plotting windows. What can I do to find the problem?\n\nA: Add -p\nIf you are doing:\ngnuplot -e 'p sin(x)'\n\nadd a -p, it helps a lot:\ngnuplot -p -e 'p sin(x)'\n\nman gnuplot documents:\n\n-p, --persist lets plot windows survive after main gnuplot program exits.\n\n\nTested on gnuplot 5.0 patchlevel 3, Ubuntu 16.04.\n\nA: You might be missing gnuplot-x11. Try to install it. In the commandline, do this:\nsudo apt-get install gnuplot-x11\n\n\nA: The problem seems to be the 'unknown' terminal type. The separate window for the output is generated by wxWidget library. If this package is not installed on your machine, no window would be created at all. However, to draw something in this window, you need two other packages, as wxWidget does not draw anything. All these packages can be installed at once by the following command.\nsudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libwxgtk2.8-dev\n\nBe warned that wxWidget (libwxgtk) must be 2.8 and not 3.0 if you are installing it from source instead of repository. After installing all these, it is safer to throw away gnuplot source folders from your machine. Download latest gnuplot and extract it in the folder you want to install in. Finally, you should make a change in the configure file that you got with the gnuplot source. Locate the following line in it:\n wxt terminal: no (requires C++, wxWidgets>2.6, cairo>0.9, pango>1.10)\n\nand change that no to yes and save it. After this run commands ./configure, then make and finally sudo make install. Now gnuplot should be working fine.\nEdit : Today I found out another issue related to wxt terminal. So sometimes even after following the procedure outlined above, you don't get that beautiful wxt terminal in Ubuntu 14. The little hack is like this (I am not explaining this, just follow it!)\nsudo apt-get purge libwxbase3.0-dev wx3.0-headers libwxgtk3.0-0\n\nAnd then delete the gnuplot from bin folder. Finally repeat what is given above.     \n", "Q: AMD Driver update (one from amd.com) Hi guys what is the BEST way to update driver from AMD.com Right now I am on latest 13.3 Beta 3 and just for future how do I update.

Im new in using Ubuntu and I cant seem to make any partitions for a new dual boot OS and the swap file or for any other matter i would want to use the partition because the drive is locked.\nI have already tried running the Live CD or in my case a Live USB and then ran Gparted but the status is still the same. Could anyone please shed some light in this matter?\n\n\n\nA: If partitions are showed with a lock in gparted, then they are mounted. Usually GPartEd is able to unmount them, but sometimes this isn't possible, so you have to manually unmount them with the following commands as root:\n\n\n*\n\n*umount /dev/sda1\n\n*umount /dev/sda5\n\n\nIf you aren't logged in as root (root normally has '#' at the end of the command prompt whereas a normal user usually has '$'). You need to add sudo in front of the commands.\nIn case of the screenshots however, at least /dev/sda1 is mounted in a way it can't be unmounted as it is necessary for the currently running system to work.\nOne way you can avoid the drives being mounted (\"locked\") in the first place, is using a liveCD like PartedMagic (http://www.partedmagic.com). This one really shouldn't mount any of your partitions if you don't manually say so.\n\nA: GParted doesn't support managing partitions inside LVM volumes. You will have to do this by hand:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the live system.\n\n*Mount the LVM volume.\n\n*Resize the contained file system.\n\n*Unmount the volume.\n\n*Resize the volume.\n\n*Resize the volume container.\n\n*Resize the volume container partition.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nThese are the general steps to take. The specifics depend on the file system and I don't know the LVM commands by heart. Please consult the relevant manual pages and open another question specific to this topic, if you run into problems.\nEdit: This is the reason LVM isn't part of the default Ubuntu setup.\n\nA: Disks (gnome-disks) which uses Udisk is a very simple and capable utility. It allowed me to have 2 bootable Linux partitions and to mount a previous broken file system. That way I could extract all my data and settings.\nAlthough Udisk doesn't replace Gparted, it has some useful features. Setting partition labels, mount points and automount is simple in the rather too basic graphic interface.\nIt also allowed me to unmount partitions which Gparted wouldn't. (The main reason for this answer)\nCouple of pics to illustrate my setup. sdb1 & sbd6 are bootable from grub, and sdb7 is the damaged partition.\n\n\n", "Q: how to recover when /etc has been deleted on ubuntu 12.04?

I.e. programs where you make keyframes, and the program fill in the inbetweens.\nI want to make a short video for plugging a web-site, with some drawings moving around.  To be frank, I planning to make a presentation more similar to PowerPoint; but with more movement (animation) of the graphics and figures (more like a cartoon) than you can get with normal presentation-programs.  I guess I may have tried Flash under Windows (if I had it), though I would prefer something a bit more advanced (help a bit more with the animation)...\nAny suggestions for a good application to do something like this?\n\nA: Yes there is a very powerful 3D modelling and animation package called Blender.  You can get the latest version from the link.\nBlender is an integrated 3d suite for modelling, animation, rendering,\npost-production, interactive creation and playback (games). Blender has its\nown particular user interface, which is implemented entirely in OpenGL and\ndesigned with speed in mind. Python bindings are available for scripting;\nimport/export features for popular file formats like 3D Studio and Wavefront\nObj are implemented as scripts by the community.

These folders contain data public to all users.\nIf how can I tell the desktop environment about which directories I use.\n\nA: The folders under /usr/share are used for this purpose.  Though most are application-specific, you'll find directories for things like fonts, man-pages, documentation (for packages), dictionaries, icons, sounds and backgrounds.  The drawback is that while somethings are collected in one directory (like /usr/share/icons and /usr/share/fonts), other things are spread over many...  E.g. you'll find desktop-backgrounds spread between several /usr/share/* -folders, as each WindowManager/DesktopEnviroment install their own in their own directories under /usr/share (e.g. a background-folder somewhere under/usr/share/kde for KDE).\n", "Q: Ubuntu live cd : black screen and blinking cursor I try to install ubuntu 12.04 on my computer.

Status changes to playing, but the search bar thingy and the position counter don't progress. No sound comes out of either the stereo installation or the computer. I've also tried to manually create a \"Sink\" (?) using pactl load-module module-raop-sink server=192.168.1.32. The result was the same.\n\n\n*Airplay: Stream2IP\n\n*\n\n*I'm guessing this uses the same backend as the Pulseaudio thing, or perhaps even does exactly the same. It says it's connected, but exactly the same happens as did with the previous method. The stereo installation doesn't even recognise any kind of connection. It just continues playing what it's already playing.\n\n\n*DLNA: Stream2IP\n\n*\n\n*When I go to Media Server on the stereo installation, it sees RobinJ: Root.

The free version is limited, and it's not open source, but at least it allows me basic streaming features.

Rather than me having to browse through menu's on the stereo to choose a song.\n\n\n*Windows Media Sharing: Nothing\n\n*\n\n*I have no idea how to do this on Ubuntu.\n\n\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? Don't just close this as an \"Exact duplicate\", because if I haven't found an answer after looking for half a year, I think it's safe to assume that the answer is not yet on this website.\n\nI'm running Ubuntu 13.04, but I don't mind switching to 12.04 or 12.10, or even en different distro, if it'll work there.\n\nA: To my observation the main reason why it seems complicated to achieve media streaming to any external hardware media devices is that the manufacturers of these devices lean back and rely on the presence of OS X or Windows on their customer's machines.\nDLNA media file access\nFrom the many solutions that do exist I had success with the following solutions for DLNA media access for my Internet Radio, Android Devices, and Smart TV:\n\n*\n\n*Serviio: closed source, rather sluggish on my machine.\n\n*Rygel : default GNOME DLNA streaming server, crashes on access from some devices.\n\n*MiniDLNA : very lightweight and stable, needs to be set up from a configuration file.\n\n*uPnP : not further developed, does not stream to all of my devices.\n\nMy favourite on that list definitely is minidlna, which now runs here 7/24 for several months with no issues. By default minidlna will run on startup as a service. To run it in user space you may use stream2ip from version > 1.0, or the MiniDLNA Application Indicator I made for this. You will still have to set up minidlna by its configuration file first.\nLive streams\nSadly none of these solutions are able to stream the output of my soundcard live to the receiver. Newer devices do not support the old RAOP protocol used by pulseaudio but seem to need the newer RAOP2 protocol which is not (yet?) available for Ubuntu.\nLive streams to external (non-Ubuntu) devices is possible in case they support the RTP protocol pulseaudio is able to stream with, but I have not found one which does.\nAnother possibility is setting up an Iceast Internet Radio Server to generate our own private radio \"station\" in our local network. This works great but a prererequisite is that the tuner is able to connect to a stream defined by its IP-adress, and port. It should be an easy thing to do, but sadly most devices do not offer this. Instead they support Internet Radio directory services (e.g. vTuner, or tunein) which may dependent on the device not support custom radio streams to be added. From me only my radio device which operates through Reciva has no issues playing custom streams generated from Icecast (both via stream2ip, or from command line).\n\nMarantz\nLast time I contacted Marantz (August 2012) they gave me the following information regarding support for a custom radio station:\n\n\"It is not possible to enter a custom radio station to your favorites. You can only select a station from the list provided by vTuner. From there you will have a choice of more than 17.000 stations.\" Translated from German\n\nWe may try if adding a custom URL in a personalized instance of a radio station service  (see this blog for Denon) will work by now. For Marantz we can access the vTuner service on http://radiomarantz.com/. To personalize the service we need to register with the device's unique access code (likely to be the MAC). We then may be able to add the local URL of our Icecast radio stream (<IP>:<Port>/stream.mp3) as a custom radio station. Unfortunately due to lack of hardware we can't test this here.\n\nA: Take a look at github.com/masmu/pulseaudio-dlna.\nIt was designed to stream the sound of your applications to DLNA devices in your network.\nYou can choose which application to play on your device via pavucontrol.\n\n\nA: Takkat's hint for Marantz (\"...To personalize the service we need to register with the device's unique...\") helped me set this up successfully with the M-CR603 and I hope my update is useful though this thread (and  the M-CR603) are quite old. The  access code  on radiomarantz.com is the device MAC. Via the Software Center I set up darkice and icecast2 on my Thinkpad W520 running Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit, using one of the many guides available in the public domain. On radiomarantz.com I added the local URL of the resulting Icecast radio stream (http://192.168.xx.yy:8000/stream.mp3) as a custom radio station. It worked with almost no glitches.\n", "Q: Can I run ubuntu 12.10 in my pc?

I just want to allow only for a specific MAC Address(es) to have VNC to my Ubuntu 12.10. This would be pretty cool, because I think if I use password authentication + MAC Filter = safe.\nI saw I could filter for the IP´s, but how to do this for MAC´s? Any ideas or suggestions? Thank you\n\nA: Actually that doesn't make it safer at all. MAC addresses can be configured (\"spoofed\") on most OSs for most NIC models. An attacker could sniff traffic and simply spoof your configured MAC address.\nInstead make your VNC listen on loopback and SSH into the machine, using the SSH tunnel feature to connect to VNC.\nIf you insist on using your insecure method, iptables (netfilter) can do that:\niptables -I INPUT -m mac --mac-source 00:XX:YY:ZZ:AA:BB -j ACCEPT\n\nthis rule added to a chain with the DROP (or REJECT) default policy would accept from the given MAC only. Can be combined further to check for other parameters as well. Basically I would hand it off to a different chain if I was you, checking first on the upper layers for connections to the relevant port(s) (5900?) and then do the MAC filtering. After all you only want to filter this single service to be available from this MAC only - not any service. If you are only interested in the MAC and the port do:\niptables -I INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 5900 -m mac --mac-source 00:XX:YY:ZZ:AA:BB -j ACCEPT\n\nNote:\n-m mac requires the module mac (for netfilter), so this has to be available.\n\nI would only use such methods to delist myself from a blacklist. For example I have configured a tar pit for SSH connection attempts (similar to what sshguard and similar programs do). Just like port knocking it could make sense to use a certain MAC as a signal to delist (i.e. remove from the blacklist) the connecting IP. But as a security mechanism by itself, no way. Too easy to fake.\n", "Q: ubuntu-tweak stopped working \n** (ubuntu-tweak:5760): WARNING **: Failed to load shared library 'libwebkitgtk-3.0.so.0' referenced by the typelib: libwebkitgtk-3.0.soso: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gi/_gobject/__init__.py:279: Warning: cannot derive `ubuntutweak+apps+AppsWebView' from non-derivable parent type `void'\n  type_register(cls, namespace.get('__gtype_name__'))\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/bin/ubuntu-tweak\", line 124, in \n    from ubuntutweak.main import UbuntuTweakWindow\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ubuntutweak/main.py\", line 32, in \n    from ubuntutweak.apps import AppsPage\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ubuntutweak/apps/__init__.py\", line 99, in \n    class AppsWebView(WebKit.WebView):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gi/types.py\", line 220, in __init__\n    super(GObjectMeta, cls).__init__(name, bases, dict_)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gi/_gobject/__init__.py\", line 227, in __init__\n    cls._type_register(cls.__dict__)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gi/_gobject/__init__.py\", line 279, in _type_register\n    type_register(cls, namespace.get('__gtype_name__'))\nRuntimeError: could not create new GType: ubuntutweak+apps+AppsWebView (subclass of void)\n\n\nA: open your terminal with CTRL+ALT+T then do as \nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libwebkitgtk-3.0-0\n\nthen try again.\n", "Q: software center stop working? 2013-04-03 19:25:58,551 - softwarecenter.ui.gtk3.app - INFO - setting up proxy 'None'\n2013-04-03 19:25:58,561 - softwarecenter.db.database - INFO - open() database: path=None use_axi=True use_agent=True\n2013-04-03 19:25:59,468 - softwarecenter.backend.reviews - WARNING - Could not get usefulness from server, no username in config file\n2013-04-03 19:25:59,476 - softwarecenter.fixme - WARNING - logs to the root logger: '('/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gi/importer.py', 51, 'find_module')'\n2013-04-03 19:25:59,476 - root - ERROR - Could not find any typelib for LaunchpadIntegration\n2013-04-03 19:25:59,585 - softwarecenter.ui.gtk3.app - INFO - show_available_packages: search_text is '', app is None.\n2013-04-03 19:25:59,590 - softwarecenter.db.pkginfo_impl.aptcache - INFO - aptcache.open()\n\n** (software-center:5904): WARNING **: Failed to load shared library 'libwebkitgtk-3.0.so.0' referenced by the typelib: libwebkitgtk-3.0.soso: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/ui/gtk3/widgets/videoplayer.py:42: Warning: cannot retrieve class for invalid (unclassed) type `void'\n  self.webkit = WebKit.WebView()\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/bin/software-center\", line 182, in <module>\n    app.run(args)\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/ui/gtk3/app.py\", line 1387, in run\n    self.show_available_packages(args)\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/ui/gtk3/app.py\", line 1325, in show_available_packages\n    self.view_manager.set_active_view(ViewPages.AVAILABLE)\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/ui/gtk3/session/viewmanager.py\", line 151, in set_active_view\n    view_widget.init_view()\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/ui/gtk3/panes/availablepane.py\", line 139, in init_view\n    SoftwarePane.init_view(self)\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/ui/gtk3/panes/softwarepane.py\", line 161, in init_view\n    self.cache)\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/ui/gtk3/views/appdetailsview.py\", line 884, in __init__\n    self._layout_page()\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/ui/gtk3/views/appdetailsview.py\", line 1219, in _layout_page\n    self.videoplayer = VideoPlayer()\n  File \"/usr/share/software-center/softwarecenter/ui/gtk3/widgets/videoplayer.py\", line 42, in __init__\n    self.webkit = WebKit.WebView()\nTypeError: could not get a reference to type class\n\n\nA: open your terminal and do this\n sudo apt-get install --reinstall libwebkitgtk-3.0-0\n\nthen try again.\n", "Q: Focusrite Saffire Pro - signal but no sound I am utilizing Ubuntu 12.04 with the KXDE desktop environment.

I would very much like to see the usual \"enter passphrase\" screen instead of having to bring the boot console up first, but I'd also be glad when I could manage the machine to automatically boot into GRUB, wait 0-1 seconds, automatically choose Ubuntu and then get to that passphrase entry screen. \nSetting the GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT like suggested in this thread didn't work for me, though. It still yields the same result as if I was booting the machine without GRUB.\n\nA: It's a video card initialization bug (as in there's not a simple answer or it wouldn't be a bug).

Compiz is also installed.\nIs there a code that will show which installed compositing manager being used? \n\nA: There is no direct command to get your current compositing manager. To do that, we need to make a list of them and check in the current processes. I made a script for this. Here it goes:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nCOMPOSITORS=('awesome' 'beryl' 'blackbox' 'compiz' 'dwm' 'enlightenment' 'fluxbox' 'fvwm' 'i3' 'icewm' 'kwin' 'metacity' 'musca' 'openbox' 'pekwm' 'ratpoison' 'scrotwm' 'wmaker' 'wmfs' 'wmii' 'xfwm4' 'xmonad')\n\nfor i in `ps -u $USER -o comm`; do\n    for c in ${COMPOSITORS[@]}; do\n        if [ \"$i\" == \"$c\" ]; then\n            echo \"Your compositor is $i\"\n        fi\n    done\ndone\n\nOpen your editor, paste the code above and save it with the name check-compositor.sh. Then open the terminal and execute \n$ sh path/to/your/file/check-compositor.sh\nThat should show your current compositor manager.

The technique seen here applies there as well and simplifies routing decisions by a great deal (Only one line more in the routing table vs. 5 interfaces to scan).\n\nA: It means there is no gateway needed to reach addresses within this subnet, as hosts / NICs with these addresses are in your local network and not behind any router. For all I know such entry is always present except perhaps for some point-to-point-tunnel-only setups, and if you add more addresses to your NIC, each subnet added should yield an entry like that.\nEach subnet is listed within the routing table to gather all relevant information in one place for kernel to make routing decisions - it is simply more efficient than looking up connected subnets by analysing the interface configuration and most likely critical for large routers in terms of performance.\n\nA: The second line from your route -n command\n192.168.20.0    0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0\n\nSays that for all addresses where the first 3 numbers are 192.168.20 no gateway is needed.  0.0.0.0 is not a legal IPv4 address.  Your computer does a logical AND with the destination and the Gen Mask (also known as Netmask) 255.255.255.0 in this case because the first 3 bytes are 255 the first 3 numbers must match exactly. Because the last byte is 0.  The last number can be anything.\nThe first line from your route -n command\n0.0.0.0         192.168.20.254  0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0\n\nsays use this gateway 192.168.20.254 for all other IP addresses.

Can I bring my files and folders back?\n\nA: This has happened only one time for me. The solution was to go to Ubuntu and run fsck on the partition. Or open gparted and do a check on the partition in question.\nI would first do gparted (You need to install it first). This way you graphically know what the problem is and if it was solved (by simply mounting the partition you should know if everything is correct when you start seeing the folders and files).\nAfter that do an fsck just to make sure.\nIf you ran Windows 8 and it happened exactly as you mentioned, then doing it like this will solve the issue. Do not run chkdsk from Windows or try to restore something on the partition. That will create other problems if you try to repair the problem from within Ubuntu. If you already did this then install testdisk:\nsudo apt-get install testdisk\nAnd run it like sudo testdisk in the terminal. Follow the steps to restore a lost partition.\n", "Q: Microphone and speakers stop working I was trying to make a Skype call and then the microphone just went mute. I tried to solve the problem by restarting pulseaudio (with service as well as killing it with -9) and then the speakers stop working as well! What can be wrong?\n\nA: I know this is a rather general question and can have a lot of answers, but I have found one that need to be documented, so here it is.\nBoth the Google Talk plugin for Firefox as well the Flash plugin tried to get the sound board for themselves, those selfish annoyers. I solve it by quitting Firefox (and Chrome as well, maybe it is causing problems too after all) and then restarting pulseaudio. It worked flawlessly.\nOf course, there may be other applications locking the sound hardware. To discover them, do what I did:\n$ lsof /dev/snd/by-path/<whatever is in this directory>\n\nAnd then grep the name of the listed process from ps aux.\nYour problem can be very different, for sure, but you may want to try this solution.\n", "Q: Connection failed message when installing wine When installing Wine in 12.10 I get the following message:\nErr http://np.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise/main fonts-unfonts-core all 1.0.3.is.1.0.2-080608-5ubuntu1\n  Connection failed\nFailed to fetch http://np.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/f/fonts-unfonts-core/fonts-unfonts-core_1.0.3.is.1.0.2-080608-5ubuntu1_all.deb  Connection failed\nE: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?\n\n\nA: For that type of error do the following:\nsudo apt-get update\nThe update should finish without any errors.

But because Hyper-V only allows a small window (800x600) which can not be changed (as far as I know) I've been trying to use XRDP to launch it into a full screen.

My Ubuntu client as latest updates and I have used XRDP  with success to access a stand alone Ubuntu machine. \nAny thoughts about the issue or alternate solution that works well with Windows 8 Enterprise?   \n\nA: There are probably better ways, but to modify display resolution minimum, this worked for me (setting my resolution to the current max of the synthetic display driver which is 1920x1080):\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub/cfgset\n\nEdit the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT to include:\nquiet splash video=hyperv_fb:1920x1080\n\nExit and save and then run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThen restart your virtual machine.\n", "Q: why does any upgrade pause in chengelog0 Whenever I do an upgrade the system pauses and waits for me to press F2 before it continues, displaying often a changelog, is there anyway to stop this from happening?\nUbuntu 12.10 64bit \nFOR EXAMPLE as shown below, the upgrade has paused:\nGet:1 Changelog for libxslt1.1 (http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/main/libx/libxslt/libxslt_1.1.26-14ubuntu0.1/changelog) [37.2 kB]\nlibxslt (1.1.26-14ubuntu0.1) quantal-security; urgency=low\n\n  * SECURITY UPDATE: denial of service via malformed stylesheet\n    - debian/patches/CVE-2012-6139.patch: check for empty values in\n      libxslt/functions.c, libxslt/keys.c, add tests in tests/*.\n    - CVE-2012-6139\n\n -- Marc Deslauriers <marc.deslauriers@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 28 Mar 2013 13:03:10 -0400\n\nGet:1 Changelog for libpoppler28 (http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/main/p/poppler/poppler_0.20.4-0ubuntu1.2/changelog) [42.7 kB]\npoppler (0.20.4-0ubuntu1.2) quantal-security; urgency=low\n\n  * SECURITY UPDATE: invalid memory access issues\n    - debian/patches/CVE-2013-1788.patch: add checks in poppler/Function.cc,\n      poppler/Stream.cc, splash/Splash.cc.\n    - CVE-2013-1788\n  * SECURITY UPDATE: denial of service via malformed documents\n    - debian/patches/CVE-2013-1789.patch: validate data in splash/Splash.cc.\n    - CVE-2013-1789\n  * SECURITY UPDATE: uninitialized memory read\n    - debian/patches/CVE-2013-1790.patch: properly handle refLine in\n      poppler/Stream.cc.\n    - CVE-2013-1790\n\n -- Marc Deslauriers <marc.deslauriers@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 08 Mar 2013 13:43:15 -0500\n\nGet:1 Changelog for xdiagnose (http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/main/x/xdiagnose/xdiagnose_3.2.3/changelog) [18.5 kB]\nxdiagnose (3.2.3) quantal-proposed; urgency=low\n\n  * xdiagnose.udev: Disable GPU apport hook from being triggered by udev.\n    This should only be enabled during the development period.

And you need to include --no-base to install a minimal system.\n\nTaken from the 2 links I can provide you a few groups:\n\n\n*\n\n*@ X Window System \n\n*@ Desktop \n\n*@ Sound and Video\n\n*@ Graphical Internet \n\n*@ GNOME Desktop Environment  \n\n\n(no guarantee these work with Ubuntu though)\n", "Q: Google Chrome update itself (without permission) on Ubuntu 12.04 I use Google Chrome and it is an addictive browser, and it is super fast, but it force updated itself on my Ubuntu 12.04 today, which I did not like at all.\n\n*\n\n*How did Google Chrome update itself on Ubuntu 12.04 without my permission?\n\n*How do I tell Google Chrome to \"knock on door before entering the room\"?\n\n\nA: Untick it in the image below (see the last one) and tick it again whenever you want: (You can get this screen by selecting 'Software and updates')\n\n\nA: When you install Google Chrome, it automatically adds its software source to your list of software sources.\nThis causes Ubuntu's package manager to automatically upgrade Google Chrome when a new version comes out.\nIf you want to stop this from happening, you can disable that software source.\nThe Graphical Way\nOpen the Software Sources window. One way to do this is to start typing Software Sources in the the Unity dash search box, then click on the Software Sources icon when it appears; another is to open the Update Manager (called the Software Updater in later versions of Ubuntu) and click Settings...\nClick the Other Software tab. In the list, find the entry that says:\nhttp://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main\n\n\nUncheck the box to the left of it, to disable that entry. Now Google Chrome will not be automatically updated.\nAlternatively, you may remove the entry (by selecting it and clicking Remove). Disabling it by unchecking the box is just as effective at preventing Google Chrome from being automatically updated, however.\nThe Manual / Command-Line Way\nWhen you installed the google-chrome-stable package (after downloading it from Google), it enabled its software source for updates on your machine by creating a file called google-chrome.list in the directory /etc/apt/sources.list.d.\nIf you rename that file to google-chrome.list.save, the software source will be disabled (like unchecking it in Software Sources, as described above).\nIf you delete the file, it will be removed entirely (though disabling it is sufficient for preventing Google Chrome from being automatically updated.\nYou can rename or delete it in the Terminal or with the GUI (Nautilus, the file browser). To rename it in the Terminal, run:\ncd /etc/apt/sources.list.d\nmv google-chrome.list google-chrome.list.save\n\nTo delete it in the Terminal, run:\ncd /etc/apt/sources.list.d\nrm google-chrome.list\n\nHowever you remove it, you may have to remove it again later.\nIf you install a newer version of Google Chrome, it will probably re-add its software source, and enable it. So no matter what method you used to disable it, Google Chrome will typically be automatically upgraded if you then subsequently manually upgrade it by manually installing the .deb package for a newer version.\nWhy does Google Chrome add its software source?\nBecause many updates to web browsers including Google Chrome include fixes for security vulnerabilities. Running a web browser with known vulnerabilities is unsafe. Many security exploits these days, like cross-site scripting exploits, don't depend on what operating system you run. Running Ubuntu instead of Windows does not protect you very much from many browser security bugs.\nSince it is usually dangerous to run an old version of Google Chrome, installing Google Chrome also enables its software source so that it is automatically updated.\nTherefore, you may wish to reconsider if you really want to prevent Google Chrome from being automatically upgraded when a new version comes out.\n", "Q: How can I change the encoding of a subtitle file? I downloaded a Greek subtitle for a movie, and this is what I see when I open it with Gedit.\n\nSubtitle works great on VLC, all perfect.\nBut what if I want to edit this subtitle with some Greek words? I instantly get an error about character encoding.\n\nI hit retry and then VLC doesn't recognize the subtitles...\n\nA: iconv -f ISO-8859-7 -t UTF-8  Input_file.srt   > Output_file.srt  \n\nOpen them from Kate editor you can see the proper text, if you still need to open them from Gedit, in other words, permanently change the codification run the above terminal command.\n\nA: I'd recommend enca. Unlike gaupol, you can handle not only subtitle-files, but any text file.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install enca:\nsudo apt-get install enca\n\n\n*To figure out the encoding of the file, see if enca can guess it:\nenca <file>\n\nor, if it fails and you know the language of the text file, than run for example\nenca -L ru <file>\n\nand see what it gives you. Get the list of supported languages from man enca.\n\n*I'd recommend to convert to UTF-8, you can do it by running\nenconv -x utf8 <file>\n\nor, again, if enca cannot guess the language by\nenconv -L ru -x utf8 <file>\n\nthat should do the trick.\n\nA: For subtitle edition/translation (text-based subtitles, that is), I strongly suggest Gaupol.\nsudo apt-get install gaupol\n\nBesides of gaupol, you can also try Subtitle Editor and Gnome Subtitles.\nHowever, from the screenshots, it is clear that your .srt file is not encoded in Unicode.\nAs it turns out, iconv does change the encoding of the file to UTF-8, but the converted file will still have the same characters you see when opening in Gedit.\nThe solution I found is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Gaupol and go to menu File → Open or click on the button Open.\n\n*There is a selection menu in the lower part of the open window, titled Character encoding. Click on Other... (last option).\n\n\n*Select an appropriate encoding for your file, e.g. Greek ISO-8859-7, and click on the button Accept.\n\n\n*Now open your .srt file and make sure all characters are correctly rendered. Otherwise, repeat the above procedure with another encoding. You can run the command file -bi yourfile.srt to determine the correct encoding of your file (although I've read the results are not necessarily exact).\n\n*With your subtitle file open in the correct character encoding, now go to the menu File → Save as... and change the character encoding option (again, at the bottom of the window) to UTF-8 and save the file (possibly with a new name, for safety).\n\n\n\nThis same procedure of adding the codepage will work for Gedit. Yet I leave the instructions for Gaupol since this question is about subtitle files.\nGood luck.\n\nA: The problem is that Gedit (and many other linux apps) don't recognize correctly the text's encoding. VLC on the other hand is most probably set to recognize it correctly (through \"Subtitle preferences\" tab), and that's why you don't have any problem there. The solution is simple:\nYou don't open the file by double-clicking it, but through Gedit's \"Open\" dialog. There, you can find at the bottom left side a drop-down for Encoding, in which \"Automatically Detected\" is selected by default. Set it to \"Windows-1253\" or \"ISO-8859-7\" and you're good to go, the file opens correctly (and you can then save it to UTF-8 to avoid future issues)\n\nA: Another subtitle editor that allows for converting into different formats (and comes with tons of features) is Aegisub. It's native format (.ass) is supported by VLC Media Player as well as MPlayer and converting to it should fix encoding issues.\n\nA: For translating SRT files you also can use DualSub. It is open-source (GPLv3) and cross-platform. It uses Google Translator.\n\nA: For your general informations, now there is subtitle-index.org, it concentrates a lot of subtitles, rank them along multiple criterias (duration, spell check, lisibility, encoding), and offers the best one in direct download  as UTF-8. \nWorking pretty fine, it avoids encoding problems which are pretty commons and annoying.\n\nA: This is a Python3 function for converting any text files including subtitles into the ones with UTF-8 encoding.\ndef correctSubtitleEncoding(filename, newFilename, encoding_from='ISO-8859-7', encoding_to='UTF-8'):\n    with open(filename, 'r', encoding=encoding_from) as fr:\n        with open(newFilename, 'w', encoding=encoding_to) as fw:\n            for line in fr:\n                fw.write(line[:-1]+'\\r\\n')\n\n\nA: You only need Excel to correct this.\nIt is quite simple, just follow these few steps:\nOpen a new Excel sheet\nGo to \"Data\", \"Get external data\", \"From text\", and select your subtitle file. You may need to search for \"all files\" instead of leaving it on \".txt\" only.\nThen, you can select the right encoding in the following window. Try most of them and preview the result.\nYou will have to pay attention to 2 things:\n\n*\n\n*eliminate all delimiters, to keep you text in one piece\n\n*put the \"column data format to \"text\" (otherwise, Excel could take the minus sign for a formula)\n\n*import the data from the cell you like (A1 is OK of course).\n\nYour text is perfectly encoded in Excel.\nYou just have to copy/paste it all in a new .srt file.\n", "Q: Delete confirmation dialog doesn't show up when I delete a file In Ubuntu 12.10, when I hit delete it just deletes the file with no confirmation dialog.\nAnd yes the 'Ask before emptying rubbish bin or deleting files' checkbox is ticked in on the behaviour tab in the files preferences \nIs there something I'm missing??\n\nA: I assume you are referring to deleting Files/Folders in Caja, the most common file explorer in Ubuntu.\nThe “bug” is still around in Ubuntu 16.04. Except they don't see it as a bug: If you delete something terminally, you'll be asked (if chosen so in the settings). If it's ‘just’ about moving files to Trash, there is no option, and the DEL key is trigger-happy. \n(Yes, I would prefer to be asked about that, too. All to easy to almost-delete a file. And who thoroughly checks his trashcan before occasional emptying?)\n→ see here for further discussion\n", "Q: Last command on .sh files won't run I have this script in a *.sh file to enable natural scrolling. I've added it to Startup Application.\n#!/bin/sh\nxinput set-prop 11 268 -106 -106\nnautilus -q && nautilus -n\n\nThe problem is, whenever I login, the last command (nautilus -n) won't run -which is annoying because I can't use the Super button to open Dash- and I have to run nautilus manually. What's wrong?\nUPDATE:\nI have tested my script above on terminal line-by-line, and it works fine. The problems only appear when I run it from .sh file.\nnautilus -q && touch $HOME/Desktop/reported-success.txt give me the txt file, \nand the result of nautilus -q && nautilus -n &> $HOME/nautilus-output.log is :\nInitializing nautilus-open-terminal extension\nInitializing nautilus-image-converter extension\nInitializing nautilus-dropbox 1.4.0\n\n\nA: Well from the script that means that nautilus -q returned a non-zero exit code. Hence the && evaluates to false and nautilus -n doesn't get executed.\nYou tell it: run nautilus -n if nautilus -q succeeded. The definition of success is an exit code of 0 in the shell.\nUse ; instead of && to do it unconditionally or use a small wrapper script to translate the possible return codes that you want to accept as \"success\" into 0.\nAnother method to tear down running nautilus instances is obviously to use pkill this way:\npkill -u $(whoami) ^nautilus\n\nYou may want to specify a particular signal (pkill -SIGNALNAME -u ...), but I found no documentation on which signals nautilus reacts to.\nThe above command kills all instances of nautilus running as you (the whoami).\n\nUse this to figure out what the first command (nautilus -q) returned:\nnautilus -q || echo \"exit code: $?\"\n\nWhat do you see? If it's not 0 then this is clearly the problem just the way the script logic suggests.\n\nA: End the script with a linefeed/enter character or an empty line\nor else the last command won't be executed.\n", "Q: Why does my Firefox profile folder keep showing up in Recently Used (files/folders)?

I'm trying to install a Windows 8 VM using KVM and the Virtual Machine Manager GUI.  Upon installing KVM and VMM, and starting VMM I get the error Unable to connect to libvirt.\nVerify that:\n   - The 'libvirt-bin' package is installed\n   - The 'libvirtd' daemon has been started\n   - You are member of the 'libvirtd' group\n\nI tried apt-get install libvirt-bin and it was installed.\nBut I do not know how to check if the daemon has started or check / add myself as a member.\n\nA: Just solved this issue for myself. \nGenerate a public key pair on the machine virt-manager is used. Note that this is placed into the default key file. If you already have one it will ask you to override. If you do you will have to distribute this key everywhere you used it previously. \n# ssh-keygen -t rsa\n\nRemote login without a password, or with a passphrase, requires an SSH key to be distributed to the systems being managed. Use the ssh-copy-id to do this. Change root to be the user you want to log into the daemon as, logging in as root is risky. I use my local user on the host machine. Replace id_rsa.pub with the public part of the key you generated above. id_rsa.pub is the default. You will be asked to log into the remote machines via ssh for the copy to take place. This is your users (in my case root) ssh password not the pass-phrase of the key you just created.\n# ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@host2.example.com\nroot@host2.example.com's password:\n\nNow try logging into the host machine, with the ssh. Check that .ssh/authorized_keys file to make sure unexpected keys have not been added. A simple cat of the file to see if its the same should do. \nDo this step for all other systems you wish to log into via virt-manager from your current system. \nNow to make things automatic in the GUI you need to add the key to the ssh-agent so that it can log in for you. \n# ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nNow you should be able to shh into the machine through a terminal and not be asked for any passphrase or password. \nNow try virt-manager. \nIf your getting issues with the agent failing to authenticate you, check out the last link in the sources with regards to a bug that hit me at this stage. \nSources:\nManaging Virtual Hosts:\nhttps://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Virtualization_Administration_Guide/chap-Virtualization_Administration_Guide-Remote_management_of_virtualized_guests.html\nshh-agent bug: \nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssh/%2Bbug/201786\nSeems that ssh-agent can crash at some points and not accept keys from calling ssh-add for some reason. Not clear on this however the suggest setting of the SSH_AUTH_SOCK=0 helped get past this for me. \nOnce the key and its linked into the agent you should automatically be logged in via virt-manager. \n", "Q: Is it possible to change text console (VT, framebuffer) foreground color?

So how exactly do I replace SVG icons with the PNGs I made?\nI'm using Linux Mint 14, but I figured I'd ask here as it seems I'd get more support and seeing that Mint and Ubuntu are very similar. \nI remember seeing something on a thread not to long ago that SVGs tax the cpu and graphics more than PNGs. That true?\n\nA: The SVGs do not use any more CPU to render than PNGs do.\nYou can however, use PNGs if you wish instead of SVGs.

I have locked the second icon to the launcher and it seems to be working fine, but I don't want two icons.\n\nA: I periodically run into this problem and variants of it, most recently on Ubuntu 14.04. \nHere's what has worked for me in these cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close all Chrome windows (and choose Exit from the Chrome indicator menu, if you have one).\n\n*Right click on all Chrome icons in the launcher and choose Unlock from Launcher.\n\n*Open the Files application.\n\n*\n\n*Choose Location from the Go menu (or press Ctrl-L).\n\n*Type .local/share/applications into the text field and press Enter.\n\n*You should see a number of files whose names contain \"chrome\" (or \"chromium\" if you're using Chromium instead of Google Chrome.

I hadn't used it for a while until a couple of days ago. I checked for software updates and got a bunch. I began to install them. During this process I opened the Software Center and tried to look at the software that I had currently installed. This seemed to mess up the installation process (the details window began showing a terminal-like display). When it finally finished (after about an hour) I tried to shut it down. But it just hung for about half an hour without any disk activity, so I forced a shut-down by holding the power button. Now when I go into Ubuntu it runs very slowly or not at all. When I try to uninstall it with Wubi it says\n“Error executing command\n\n\ncommand=C:\\Windows\\sysnative\\bcdedit.exe/delete{…}\\f\n    retval=1\n    stderr=An error occurred while attempting to delete the specified entry.\n    The system cannot find the file specified”\n\n\nIs there any way to delete Ubuntu while leaving my Windows system in place in this situation? Any suggestions very gratefully received.\n\nA: there are two checks you can perform to check after it has been removed.\nThe first one checks that wubi has been uninstalled and this could leave gigbytes of information leftover (use the second check for left over data)\nthe second check is to open a partition manager and check that the partitoin for ubuntu is gone. you can press start and search partition to do this.\nfirstly i suggest pressing start, type in uninstall, and then click [Uninstall a program]\nwhen it loads find Wubi within the list, click it and then click uninstall at the top, follow the instructions and restart to perform the check.\nthe next thing to do is just delete the partition.\nlike mentioned before, click start, type partiton and click the option labelled [create and format hard disk partitons] at this point remove any cd`s or usb drives and continue.\nyou will see at the bottom of the window that opens a row, on the left of that row will be the name of the hard disk eg (C:windows) and its normally the C drive unless you changed it. then right click the ubuntu partition (normally the third one along) and click delete partitoin, you can check your deleting the correct one by going into my computer and renaming your first windows partitoin, then re open the window, press f5 to refreash and the one thats renamed is the one you DONT delete. if you have any problems just comment or email me 2340k@live.co.uk\n", "Q: Tried to follow the EC2 Juju guide and it fails I am evaluating Juju and when following the very basic tutorial https://juju.ubuntu.com/docs/getting-started.html, literally following every single instruction to a T, all I end up when trying to bootstrap is this error:\nubuntu@ip-xxx:~$ juju bootstrap\n2013-04-03 22:10:48,016 INFO Bootstrapping environment 'sample'\n    (origin: ppa type: ec2)...\n2013-04-03 22:10:48,494 ERROR Bootstrap aborted because file storage\n    is not writable: Error Message: Access Denied\n\nAm I missing something?

It really slow down the actual boot up time Dear Readers of this question\nI'm a beginning learner in the wonderful of Linux.  Its great, but I got to solve the problem by myserlf so please help me! \nSetup: \nMacbook Pro 8,1, rEFit, GRUB2,\nLion,\nUbuntu 04.12\nProblem: My boot takes too long because I have to go through two bootloaders.  rEFit >> GRUB >> then finally Ubuntu!  Also, when I try to boot another OS from USB for test (elementary OS Luna), rEFit recoganize it, I select Penguin mark with USB, and GRUB loads and shows only Ubuntu, not OS. My guess is having two bootloader is somehow making computer confuse, Sooooo, do I really need two step bootloader?  \nOne more thing related to booting process.  At login screen, I can select desktop environment.  I have Unify and Genome desktop both with Cairo dock. When I change desktop environment, it does not correctly load the setting.  Its almost like all the themes got mixed up under the hood.\nHere is how I end up with my dual-boot setting (which is my main question)\nI set up dual-boot machine on MacbookPro 8,1 originally running Lion.  I followed the instruction from online article and setup dual boot machine with Lion and Ubuntu 04.12.\nhttp://lifehacker.com/5934942/how-to-dual-boot-linux-on-your-mac-and-take-back-your-powerhouse-apple-hardware\nThe instruction I had made me install rEFit, then install Ubuntu which installed GRUB2 automcally. At very least I did not configure intentionally.  \nMy boot process goes, turn the swith on, select OS from rEFit, then wait, press return at GRUB menu, then wait and enter password at login. \nIdealy, I want to get rid of one.  I want to keep GRUB for features and avaialble themes, but I know GRUB has issues with Macbookpro 8,1 so I guess I am keeping rEFit unless someone fixed those issues. \nHow exactly do I proceed?  \nBest Regard,\n\nA: The answer is \"it depends.\"\nIf your GRUB is an EFI version of GRUB, then in theory it can replace rEFIt. Doing so on a Mac is a bit tricky, though, and I don't have step-by-step instructions for doing the job.\nMost Ubuntu installations on Macs install Ubuntu in BIOS mode, though, and therefore use a BIOS version of GRUB. In this configuration, both boot loaders are (more-or-less) necessary; rEFIt is unable to boot a Linux kernel directly without jumping through awkward hoops, and the BIOS version of GRUB can't boot OS X.\nAn alternative you might want to consider is replacing rEFIt, which is no longer being developed, with its fork rEFInd, which is. Unlike rEFIt, rEFInd can boot a Linux (3.3.0 or later) kernel directly, so by installing rEFInd, you can bypass GRUB. The procedure to do this would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install rEFIt from OS X by using its install.sh script.\n\n*Manually install the driver for whatever filesystem you use on Linux's /boot partition, or on the root (/) partition if you don't have a separate /boot partition. See the rEFInd documentation for details on its drivers. (You'll just need to copy one file.)\n\n*Reboot. rEFInd should appear and show you an option for OS X and at least one for Linux (with a penguin), and one for GRUB (with either a generic icon or an Ubuntu logo). Select the one that boots via GRUB.\n\n*In Ubuntu, locate the mkrlconf.sh script that comes with rEFInd and run it with sudo. This creates a configuration file that helps boot the kernel directly.\n\n*Reboot. You should now be able to launch the direct-boot option(s) in rEFInd. (The ones with the Linux penguin icons.) If you have problems at this point, you'll have to resolve them, or maybe just use rEFInd as you'd been using rEFIt before.\n\n*If everything's working, you can optionally remove the old GRUB entry from rEFInd's menu as follows:\n\n*\n\n*If you'd been using a BIOS-mode GRUB, locate the refind.conf file (on the ESP or the OS X / partition, depending on how you installed rEFInd), uncomment the scanfor line, and remove the hdbios option from that line. Note that if you also boot Windows, though, this will remove Windows from the boot options, so you probably don't want to do this if you're triple-booting with Windows.\n\n*If you'd been using an EFI-mode GRUB, you can either remove its files (probably in /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu) or use the dont_scan_files or dont_scan_dirs option in refind.conf to restrict scanning for GRUB.\n\n\n\nA: It is possible to use Grub as your only boot manager.\nFirst make sure you have efibootmgr installed\n$ sudo apt-get install efibootmgr\n\nThen check the partitions from which EFI can boot\n$ sudo efibootmgr\nBootCurrent: 0000\nTimeout: 5 seconds\nBootOrder: 0000,0082\nBoot0000* ubuntu\nBoot0080* Mac OS X\nBoot0081* Mac OS X\nBoot0082* \nBootFFFF* \n\nIn my case it lists 4 partitions. Boot0000 is the Ubuntu partition where Grub is installed, by default I want to boot this partition. \nI found out that Boot0080 is the recovery partition of the old Mavericks installation, while Boot0081 is the Yosemite recovery partition. The partition where Yosemite is actually installed, in my case, is Boot0082\nGrub is not able to load Mac OS X directly, but I can configure EFI to load the Mac OS X partition when Grub exits.\nSo I've run\n$ sudo efibootmgr -o 0000,0082\n\nWhich, to recap, means Boot0000, where Grub is installed, will be run first, then if you exit grub (by pressing c end then typing the command exit) you can boot into Mac OS X\nTo make the process of booting Mac OS X more comfortable you can add an entry to the Grub boot menu which exits and thus starts Mac OS X. Just edit /etc/grub.d/40_custom and append the following\nmenuentry \"Exit to Max OS X\" {\n  exit\n}\n\nAnd reload the Grub configuration with\nsudo update-grub\n\nAll should work\n", "Q: Unable to install qt4-designer under ubuntu 12.10 I failed to install qt4-designer under ubuntu 12.10 because I got this error message:\nqt4-designer:\n  Depends: libqt4-designer (=4:4.8.3+dfsg-0ubuntu3.1) but 4:4.8.3+dfsg-0ubuntu4~quantal1~test4 is to be installed\n  Depends: libqt4-network (=4:4.8.3+dfsg-0ubuntu3.1) but 4:4.8.3+dfsg-0ubuntu4~quantal1~test4 is to be installed\n  Depends: libqt4-xml (=4:4.8.3+dfsg-0ubuntu3.1) but 4:4.8.3+dfsg-0ubuntu4~quantal1~test4 is to be installed\n  Depends: libqtcore4 (=4:4.8.3+dfsg-0ubuntu3.1) but 4:4.8.3+dfsg-0ubuntu4~quantal1~test4 is to be installed\n  Depends: libqtgui4 (=4:4.8.3+dfsg-0ubuntu3.1) but 4:4.8.3+dfsg-0ubuntu4~quantal1~test4 is to be installed\n\nHow can I fix this issue?\n\nA: Looks like you have you added some Qt related PPA's, and have installed newer Qt libraries which lead to dependency conflict.\nThe easiest way would be to uninstall 4:4.8.3+dfsg-0ubuntu4~quantal1~test4 Qt packages, remove 3rd party Qt PPA's, and try again.\n", "Q: How do I stop this constant loss of free space? I was running Ubuntu, as normal, when suddenly I got a dialog box that said I only had 1.2 GB of free space left. An hour before, I had 30 GB of free space.\nI deleted some stuff and brought the free space up to 25 GB. But it continues to decrease. I tried removing old log files and truncating log files and such, and it continues to decrease!\nI tried using Disk Analyzer to find where all this free space loss was coming from and that didn't work, as it showed everything as it should be. I rebooted and eventually Ubuntu did a disk check that somehow brought the free space back up to 40 GB but it still continues to decrease about 10 GB a day. I continue to try and find new ways to free space, but its like an automated process of decreasing disk space that I cannot get to stop.\nI don't know what to do. How can I find the cause, and stop my free space from decreasing?\nHere is the output from sudo du -sh /var/* ~/.xsession-errors:\n13M /var/backups\n204M    /var/cache\n112M    /var/crash\n4.0K    /var/games\n503M    /var/lib\n4.0K    /var/local\n0       /var/lock\n9.5G    /var/log\n85M     /var/mail\n4.0K    /var/metrics\n24K     /var/opt\n0       /var/run\n1.7M    /var/spool\n391M    /var/tmp\n11G     /var/tvmobili\n20K     /var/www\n224K    /home/school/.xsession-errors\n\n\nA: A disk check freed some of the space, suggesting that this problem (or part of it) may be due to filesystem corruption. If that is the case, then you should be able to free more space by scanning and repairing the filesystem. However, if the corruption is perpetually happening (which might or might not be the case), that usually means the hard drive is dying. If your backups (of your documents and any other important files that would be hard to replace) aren't completely up to date, please back up everything important now!\nTo check and repair the disk, it cannot be mounted (at least not read-write). So you should run the repair utility from a live environment (live CD/DVD or USB). First, you'll have to find out the device name of the partition that contains your files.\nTherefore, in the installed system, run:\nmount | grep ' on / '\n\n(Make sure to include the space between the / and '.)\nYou'll get something like:\n/dev/sda8 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro)\n\nThe text before on--in the example from my machine, /dev/sda8--is the full device name for your root partition (/). Write this down--you'll need it.\nThen boot your computer from an Ubuntu desktop CD/DVD or USB flash drive, like what you used to install Ubuntu originally. (If this is a Wubi system, installed with the Windows installer, please let us know. I don't expect that, given what you've reported, but if that is the case, the procedure will be different.)\nSelect Try Ubuntu without installing (not Install Ubuntu). When you get a functioning desktop, press Ctrl+Alt+T to open a Terminal window. Then run this command:\nsudo e2fsck -fkccp /dev/sda8\nBut make sure to replace /dev/sda8 with the right full device name for your / partition, as you obtained through the method detailed above.\nThis may take a while. The c options included in that command cause it to scan the surface of the disk for errors as well as the filesystem (and to mark any bad areas as bad so they are not used). You can leave cc out if you like (if you do, you can also leave out k), but I recommend keeping them in.\nYou may be prompted about fixing certain problems, if e2fsck thinks there's a significant likelihood that trying to fix them could cause data loss. (The p makes it so that it will fix any problems that it is confident it can fix without causing complications.)\nI recommend that you be strongly inclined to allow it to fix whatever it wants, since you should only be doing this after making sure your backups are current, anyway. If you want it to attempt even potentially dangerous fixes without prompting you, replace the p with y.\nAfter this, boot back into your Ubuntu system and see if space is freed. If it is not, or if the problem continues, please comment and edit your question to provide details.\n\nA: You've got some out-of-control logs. Instead of deleting like crazy everyday, find the fast growing file or files, and look inside to investigate what may be causing this. Maybe some program is spinning in a loop logging some condition. Either disable that program, disable its logging or try to fix the condition that it's complaining about.\nIf a file is growing before your eyes, and you have no idea which program is writing to it, you may be able to find that out easily.  Here is an example. Who has /var/log/syslog open? We use the fuser command:\n# fuser /var/log/syslog\n/var/log/syslog:      602\n\nOnly one process has /var/log/syslog open. It is process 602. What is that? Let us not bother with ps and grep, but look at the /proc filesystem directly:\n# ls -l /proc/602/exe\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Mar 29 17:45 /proc/602/exe -> /usr/sbin/rsyslogd\n\nAha, it is rsyslogd. We are not surprised that rsyslogd has /var/log/syslog/ open.\nThis method is not guaranteed to work. The reason is that programs do not have to keep files open ino rder to write to them. Suppose you have a process which opens a file, appends to it, and then closes it. You will have a somewhat more difficult investigation. You could run fuser many times until by chance you catch the process \"red handed\". That process itself could be going into and out of existence quickly. Another problem is that multiple processes could have the file open, but only one is making it larger. In that case, you can trace their system calls.\n# fuser /var/log/huge-annoying-file\n/var/log/huge-annoying-file:   1234 23459\n\nOops! Two processes have it open: 1234 and 23459. Let's see what they are doing:\n# strace -p 1234\nProcess 1234 attached - interrupt to quit\nselect(1, NULL, NULL, NULL, {9, 922666}\n\nIt's not doing anything, just blocking in a select call. Ctrl-C to break the trace:\nselect(1, NULL, NULL, NULL, {9, 922666}^C <unfinished ...>\n\nCheck the next one:\n# strace -p 23459\nwrite(5, \"Useless garbage ...\"..., 512) = 512\nwrite(5, \"More useless garbage ...\"..., 512) = 512\nwrite(5, \"More useless garbage ...\"..., 512) = 512\nwrite(5, \"More useless garbage ...\"..., 512) = 512\nwrite(5, \"More useless garbage ...\"..., 512) = 512\nwrite(5, \"More useless garbage ...\"..., 512) = 512\nwrite(5, \"More useless garbage ...\"..., 512) = 512\n^C\n\nOops, that one is writing constantly. It must be the bad one. We can even check that the file descriptor 5 which the process is writing to is in fact the large file:\n# ls -l /proc/23459/fd/5\nlr-x------ 1 root root 64 Apr  3 23:39 /proc/23459/fd/5 -> /var/log/huge-annoying-file\n\nI don't suspect you have a corrupt filesystem, but to force a full check, you don't have to boot a DVD.\nFirstly, review your filesystem's maximum mount count setting. Identify your partition using the df command. Example on an Ubuntu system I have here:\n# df\nFilesystem     1K-blocks    Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda1       18062108 5499320  11645284  33% /\nudev              392152       4    392148   1% /dev\ntmpfs             159768     768    159000   1% /run\nnone                5120       0      5120   0% /run/lock\nnone              399416     200    399216   1% /run/shm\n/dev/sr0           43668   43668         0 100% /media/VBOXADDITIONS_4.1.4_74291\n\nYou can see that the / filesystem is mounted on /dev/sda1. So /dev/sda1 is the storage device of the root partition (and the only partition in this particular system).\nLet's look at some attributes of that filesystem. This is safe to do even though it is mounted. The command spews a lot of output. Here is an excerpt:\n$ dumpe2fs /dev/sda1\ndumpe2fs 1.42 (29-Nov-2011)\nFilesystem volume name:   <none>\nLast mounted on:          /\n[ ... SNIP ... ]\nLast mount time:          Fri Mar 29 17:45:18 2013\nLast write time:          Tue Mar  5 09:08:03 2013\nMount count:              22\nMaximum mount count:      22\n[ ... SNIP ... ]\n\nHey look, the mount count is equal to the maximum mount count. Next time I reboot, there will be a filesystem check.  The important thing is that the mount count is a positive value. If yours is zero, change it to some positive value like 22 using tune2fs -c 22 /dev/whatever. Zero means that a check is never forced regardless of how many times the partition is mounted.  Rarely rebooted systems should have low values here. A server that goes down once a year could probably use a fsck each time it reboots. You can set date-based check intervals also.\nNow to force a check, you can override the actual count to be greater than or equal to the maximum, and then reboot. That's done with capital C: tune2fs -C 1234 /dev/whatever. Now the partition looks like it has been mounted 1234 times without a check, which is greater than the one- or two-digit maximum.\n\nA: this problem has been solved, it was the firewall writing tons of logs and tvmobili encoding files\n", "Q: Apt-get vs Wget So I used wget to install winetricks instead of apt-get.  I noticed when you install things via apt-get, you can just type the name (i.e. winetricks) in terminal and it'll run it, same with the dash.  When I installed via wget, terminal tells me \n\nwinetricks is currently not installed.  You can install it by\n  typing: sudo apt-get install winetricks.\n\nWhat do you call it when a program is registered with the OS from apt-get so you can just open it easily from terminal/dash?  How do you make it so other programs can be opened like that (like my winetricks that I installed from a wget command)?\n\nA: When you do something like:\nwget -qO- http://example.com/path/to/script | sh\n\nYou're just running a remote script. This could install something or just run something. It can do pretty much anything because it's a script and scripting's what Ubuntu was built on.\nWhen you use apt-get:\nsudo apt-get install winetricks\n\nYou're installing it into /usr/bin for all users. The package you're installing is now coming from the Ubuntu repository which tends to mean somebody is looking after it and monitoring what code is going into it. Most people would consider a lot safer than running a random script off the internet.\n\nEdit: In your case, you're just downloading a script - you're not running it inline like I was suggesting you might. What I've said still applies - you're just downloading it directly from whoever makes it but you're not installing it system-wide.\nIf you stick it in ~/bin/ (create that if it doesn't exist) your user will be able to call it from whatever path, otherwise you will need to prepend the path when you run it eg ~/Downloads/winetricks ...\n\nJust to answer the question:\n\nWhat do you call it when a program is registered with the OS from apt-get so you can just open it easily from terminal/dash?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing a package describes that.\n\n*There are scripts that could be downloaded and run (in one movement, like my first example) which would also be counted as installing, but it's not a managed package install.\n\n*If you're just downloading a script with wget, I'd have to call that \"downloading\".\n\n\nA: When you use apt-get, you install the version in ubuntu repo. When you download an installer and use it, you install the version defined by the installer usually (can be the same as the repo or not).\n", "Q: How to delete all the things off a hard drive seperately I need to delete all the files off my dying hard drive in Ubuntu v.11.10.

I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal Quetzal 64 bits, on a different partition Windows Vista 32 bits (brought this factory and I is useful for programs that bring).\nI want to clone both OS with clonezilla live, but in the Clonezilla-live page appears me different download options, and I dont know what of all options are correct and make a right choice for optimal cloning of these operating systems, the options to appears me in the download clonezilla-live page, are these:\nestables emisiones (.iso / .zip) - 2.1.1-7\n\nclonezilla-live-20130314-quantal-i386\nclonezilla-live-2.1.1-7-amd64.zip\nclonezilla-live-2.1.1-7-amd64.iso\nclonezilla-live-2.1.1-7-i486.zip\nclonezilla-live-2.1.1-7-i486.iso\nclonezilla-live-2.1.1-7-i686-pae.zip\nclonezilla-live-2.1.1-7-i686-pae.iso\n\nWhat is the difference between Clonezilla-live based on Debian, and the alternative one based on Ubuntu?.\nI want burn Clonezilla-Live on a DVD, so I guess that the zip is dont to me, no?\nWhat is the right to choose to me?\nThank you in advance any easy explanation.\n\nA: The version depends on your hardware, not on the operating systems you have installed. for example, you have Windows Vista 32 Bit and Ubuntu 12.10 64 Bit, which means that you have hardware that can either use 32 bit or 64 bit software. With that in mind let us look into your list:\nclonezilla-live-2.1.1-7-amd64.zip\nclonezilla-live-2.1.1-7-amd64.iso\nclonezilla-live-2.1.1-7-i486.zip\nclonezilla-live-2.1.1-7-i486.iso\nclonezilla-live-2.1.1-7-i686-pae.zip\nclonezilla-live-2.1.1-7-i686-pae.iso\n\nSince what we want is to burn the image, we go with the .iso files which leaves us like this\nclonezilla-live-2.1.1-7-amd64.iso\nclonezilla-live-2.1.1-7-i486.iso\nclonezilla-live-2.1.1-7-i686-pae.iso\n\nSince you have a system that supports 64 Bit you can use the clonezilla-live-2.1.1-7-amd64.iso version. You can also use the i686-pae but it is better to use a 64 Bit version of a 64 Bit supported hardware. \nNow, after downloading the 64 bit iso, do not worry about cloning a 32 bit Windows or Linux OS. Like I said before, the version to download depends on the hardware. So with the 64 Bit version you can clone either a 32 Bit version or a 64 Bit version of an OS installed without any problem.\n\nA: If you are able to use 64 bit ubuntu, you should be able to use 64 bit clonezilla. I've used both the debian and ubuntu versions, they are both pretty much the same as far as it concerns us.\n", "Q: What to do if 'sudo make install' does not work for tar.gz files?

When this exceeds the maximum length of an Ask Ubuntu post or becomes excessively long (which often happens), you can use http://paste.ubuntu.com and provide the link.\nIn general, if you just ran sudo make install and you didn't run ./configure and make first, run them (in that order).\nSome unpacked source code archives will let you run sudo make install without having explicitly run make. Some will not. Either way, you should run make as a separate step before running sudo make install. Sometimes you have to, and even when you do not, this lets you see any warning messages shown at the end before installing, and it keeps the files created inside the source directory owned by you, and not root.\n\nA: The actual instructions for Galaxium (hidden in the INSTALL file) have an extra step:\nas normal user:\nsh autogen.sh --prefix=/usr\nmake\n\nas root:\nmake install\n\nIf you haven't run the autogen, you won't have things in place for the make targets. That might explain why it's not working.\n", "Q: Is it Neccesary to delete the partitions before reinstalling Ubuntu 12.10 I am having Problems using Gparted to turn off swap on the swap drive to move though this re installation guide\n\nA: No, there is no need to partition a drive before we install or re-install Ubuntu in an uncomlicted default setting.

Could someone guide me?\n\nA: WPA2 uses AES by default. You aren't seeing the option, but its there. Looking at that guide, I bet your issue is more about the username/password login or this line \"3) Verify that authentication method is set to Microsoft: Protected EAP (PEAP).\"\nDo you  have a really old laptop that doesn't support WPA2?\nLogs or error messages would be helpful too. \nDo you have a password at all?\nThis might help too http://www.lug.wsu.edu/wireless/peap/ubuntu\nBut I'm not positive this is your issue. \n\nA: Just try NuTyX xfce or Manjaro xfce.

I then want to mount ubuntu onto a flash drive from my Imac and then install it on the netbook.  However, I am not sure if I follow the instruction guide for the OS of the netbook (windows xp) or the Imac I am using to download and convert it to the flash drive.  Thanks!!\n\nA: Even though my first mac was an SE, I don't use them much now, so I'll just stick with a windows to ubuntu approach. Assuming your netbook boots, just download the ubuntu iso, go to PenDriveLinuxInstallerPage and use that. As to which ubuntu (32/64 bit) to install, that is a little more complicated. Most \"netbooks\" run the Intel Atom cpu, so this might help: Intel Atom Cpu List you can also check to see which version of windows (32/64 bit) you are running as a guide.\nIf figuring out which image to download proves too much, just try one, and when you boot select 'Try Ubuntu' if it works you'll be ok. \n", "Q: I downloaded ruby on rails, but it says it isn't installed.

When using terminal sometimes you need to break the program. Sometimes you press Ctrl-c sometimes Ctrl-x and sometimes Ctrl-z\nIn some circumstances, it might simply be closing a quote or pressing enter a few times there are even instances when Ctrl-d will work.\nSo when I get stuck, like an idiot, I start mashing those keys like an idiot in the hope that the process will quit. In 95% of the cases it works and when I get desperate I just close the terminal and that works 100% of the time. I'm sure there is a logical reason for the various states due to the program being in a particular state but all I want to do is just break the application and return to the bash prompt.\nIs there a super key that will break the process without having to mash these 4 magic keys in the hope that the application will terminate?\n\nA: The super key is closing the terminal. :-) That, or the power button on your computer. \nEach of the key combinations Ctrl+c, Ctrl+x, Ctrl+z, and Ctrl+d does a different thing.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl+c : generates an interrupt signal (SIGINT).\n\n*Ctrl+x : I'm not sure what this does.\n\n*Ctrl+z : suspend the process, allowing it to be resumed at a later point (SIGSTOP).\n\n*Ctrl+d : sends an end-of-file (EOF) character.\nEach process is at liberty to interpret these signals as they see fit. Hence, there is some heterogeneity in the response. \nA more generic way to terminate a process would be to kill it with a SIGKILL signal, the most aggressive way, which is which (I think) is the same as closing the terminal window. It's better to attempt Ctrl+d and Ctrl+c first though, because these are signals that the process can anticipate, allowing it to end in a predictable and safer way.\nCheck the manual page with man 7 signal.\n", "Q: After swapping Ctrl and caps in xmodmap, how can I make Ctrl work properly for multi-modifier combinations? I've swapped Left Ctrl and Caps Lock by creating ~/.Xmodmap\nkeycode 66 = Control_L\nkeycode 37 = Caps_Lock\nclear Lock\nclear Control\nadd Lock    = Caps_Lock\nadd Control = Control_L Control_R\n\nthen running $ xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap. Pressing the Left Ctrl key works as expected, toggling Caps Lock. Pressing the Caps Lock key works in general for simple shortcuts, such as Ctrl+N.\nHowever, when multiple modifier keys are required (e.g. Alt+Ctrl+I), this only works if I press the Alt key first. If I press the Caps Lock key first, there is no effect.\nI can reset the keyboard layout with $ setxkbmap -layout us, and the above shortcut will work fine. If I run $ xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap again, I have the same problem.\nI also find that even for single-modifier combinations, I have to hold down the Caps Lock key for a split-second longer than I used to with the vanilla Ctrl key for it to register. It's probably of the order of 0.01 seconds, but it's noticeable enough that incorrect signals are being sent one in ten times.\nAlso, if I swap Ctrl and Caps Lock using $ setxkbmap -layout us -option 'ctrl:swapcaps', I no longer notice the problem with the multiple modifiers. However, I still want to work out the problem with the xmodmap solution, as I'm getting a new keyboard soon, and will need to swap Ctrl with a different key.\n=EDIT=\nI've tried another keyboard (Das Keyboard) and it seems that the second problem of having to hold down Caps Lock for a split second longer than I did with Ctrl is probably a hardware issue with the original keyboard (an Aluminium Apple wired keyboard). However, the first problem with multiple modifiers is still present.\n=EDIT=\nI've tested different keystrokes in xev. Holding Alt then pressing the Caps Lock key results in keycode 66 (keysym 0x0, NoSymbol), as opposed to keycode 66 (keysym 0xffe3, Control_L) when \nAlt is not held.\n\nA: Apparently, the above xmodmap code is not sufficient to swap the Ctrl+L and Caps Lock keys.\nkeycode 66 = Control_L\n\nshould be \nkeycode 66 = Control_L Control_L\n\nto allow correct functionality when Ctrl is pressed after another modifier. I can't find any good references to this solution but apparently the second entry relates to Shift+Key.
