["Q: External display only shows background When I plugged my MacBook Air running Lion into a projector today the projector only displayed the desktop background.  I could swipe between desktops, but it still only displayed the background (this was particularly weird for the dashboard where it showed the dashboard background but not the widgets).  When I opened system preferences that window displayed, but nothing else.  Any idea what happened or how I can fix it if it happens again?\n\nA: Have you tried running the mouse over to the left/right corners of your MBA screen? It should jump onto the projector screen - I think Lion is default for ext. screen to be on the left. \nYou should be able to drag any app then over to the screen in the same way the mouse passed across.\nWhere the big screen is compared to the little screen can be configured in System Preferences > Display > Alignment.\n", "Q: AFP over the internet? I'm using my MBP as a media server, and I'm connecting to it via my MBA through AFP (settings can be found in \"File Sharing\" tab in System Preferences).\nThis works fine if I am connecting locally, but I would like to be able to connect over the internet from anywhere.\nThe other problem is that the MBP is using DHCP and I'd rather not use VNC.\n\nA: AFP works over the internet assuming that port 548 is not blocked by your ISP. If you are using a private IP behind a NAT you'll need to forward port 548 to the computer that you want to connect to on the router.  Using DHCP makes this much more difficult.  If the DHCP requirement is so that your computer can join other networks easily, you might want to create a DHCP reservation for your computer on the router so that it always receives the same IP address.  \nThat being said, the AFP experience in the Finder is pretty poor with a slow connection to the server (which is common when connecting over the internet).  Using SFTP (really SSH/Remote Login) or another protocol and a standalone client app such as Transmit or Cyberduck would be a much more responsive experience, but not as integrated as the Finder and AFP.  \n\nA: If you setup DynDNS and make sure that your router, firewall etc all are passing TCP port 548, you'll be able to connect from the DynDNS host/domain you create.  \nAFP over the public Internet isn't a great solution for anything other than very minor, lightweight file transfers, however, and if you're expecting more than a few concurrent users you should really consider a better protocol, such as WebDAV or (S)FTP, much less Dropbox, S3, Box.com, etc.\n\nA: If you sign in with the same iCloud / Apple ID on both systems, and enable File Sharing in System Preferences > Sharing on the Macbook Pro, this is exactly the use case Back To My Mac is supposed to fulfill.\n\nA: There's an app called ShareTool that should do what you need.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Shares your network quietly in the background.\n  \n*Can be configured to run as a background daemon.\n  \n*Automatic recovery from power failure.\n  \n*All traffic travels through an encrypted SSH tunnel.\n  \n*No IP addresses or port numbers to remember.\n  \n*Access your Bonjour services remotely.\n  \n*Remote Printing.\n  \n*iTunes Home Sharing across the web fully supported.\n  \n*Connect to multiple networks at once.\n  \n*Save login information to the Keychain.\n  \n*On-the-fly compression for maximum performance.\n  \n*Browse the Web securely from any WiFi hotspot.\n  \n*Transparent SOCKS/HTTPS proxy support.\n  \n*Supports VPN connections.\n  \n*Supports Bonjour over VPN connections.\n  \n*Support for PPC systems.\n  \n*And much more!\n  \n\nIt looks like Yazsoft is no more active but Bainsware is continuing with this product.\n", "Q: What sleep charting software exists for Mac OS X? I'm looking for Mac software that will make it easier to generate a chart of my personal sleeping habits. I have a system improvised with Numbers '09, but it doesn't work very well. Is there any software out there that will do this simply? I want to log my sleep/wake times and have the chart generated for a given span of time easily. (If it can project times into the future, that's even better.)\n\nA: I have this one here, very happy with it. \nhttp://www.fitbit.com/\nThe last I checked, you can sign up for a fitbit account and use their web application to manually enter sleep times and get nice graphs and statistics using your web browser to see the data.\nI don't think there is an export function and it's clearly not a traditional app where all the data exists on your Mac.\n\nA: Zeo Mobile Everything you could ask for. 99$  it works.\n\nA: You actually have many options. \nI just personally bought the Zeo. The Zeo has two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*One that only connects to the bedside alarm (you can view data on the device, online, and with an iPhone app)\n\n*The second, only connects to iPhone and automatically uploads your data to the website.\n\n\nI chose the bedside one because it got better reviews, it seems that they haven't gotten the iPhone version stable yet.\nAs mentioned before the Fitbit and a few others in the same class like Up, Wakemate and basis. All of these use actigraphy except for Zeo which senses electric signals from the brain and face. \nBoth methods are accurate and are the same technologies that are used in sleep studies. \nIf you want a cheap way to get started try one of the iPhone apps that track your sleep from the movement of your mattress, like Sleep Cycle\n", "Q: Running AppleScript When Inserting a Blank CD I want to automatically burn a cross-platform data CD with the same contents each time a blank disc is inserted, and eject it when done. To that end I created a very simple AppleScript that does just that: \ndo shell script \"/bin/bash -c 'hdiutil burn ~/Desktop/catalog.iso'\"\n\nIt works fine from the AppleScript editor. If I click \"Run\" with a blank CD inside, it burns the CD with the data from the .iso and ejects it upon completion.\nHowever, if I select \"Run ~/Desktop/burn.scpt\" as the default action when inserting a blank CD, nothing happens. I actually have to open the AppleScript editor and select \"Run\". How can I make it actually run the script?\n\n\nA: Open burn.scpt in the AppleScript Editor and save it as an Application. Then select burn.app as the desired action on CD popup.\n\nA: You can use Keyboard Maestro to make a macro to run your shell script.\nFirst make the macro with an 'Execute Shell Script' action like so:\n\nThen use start a new 'Script Editor.app' file and paste this:\ntell application \"Keyboard Maestro Engine\"\n    do script \"Copy Disc\"\nend tell\n\n^Note the name of the script above (Copy Disc) must correspond to the name of your macro in KM.\nNext export with File > Export and use the File Format: Application. I recommend not code signing.\nOnly thing left is to make sure you set it:\n\nThere's probably a more direct way to do it, but this works for me.\n", "Q: iTunes smart playlist not syncing to iPhone My smart playlists created in iTunes are not syncing to my iPhone.  I have resolved to copying the songs that are in the smart playlist to a regular playlist to get the playlist onto the iPhone.  Why is it that smart playlists won't sync?\n\nA: I had the same problem, try:\n\n\n*\n\n*right click the playlist \n\n*click 'duplicate'\n\n*delete the old playlist \n\n*then re-sync your iPhone/iPod or whatever\n\n\nThis worked out fine for me, i then just renamed the playlist taking '1' off the end (you'll know what i mean) - hope this helps!\n\nA: I had the same problem with songs duplicating on my iPhone from smart lists. I fixed it by going into the smart list criteria and un-checking the box titled \"Live Updating\". then I updated the lists on my phone - all the duplicates were removed.\n\nA: I had the same problem the other day.  Turns out iTunes lost the path between the playlists and my music folder location on my computer.  If you go to the iTunes \"Library\" box on the left, select \"Music\" then go to the main screen and look at all of your songs in the \"Songs\" format.  Scroll down through and if any of them show exclamation points to the left of the song's name, that means the path has been lost.  If you try to play the song, a window will pop up telling you iTunes cannot find the song.  It should ask you to search for the path.  When you select \"Yes\", a search window will pop up. Just navigate to the current folder where your music is on your computer.  Once you select the path, it should ask if you want to complete this task for all your songs.  Select \"yes\" or \"ok\" (I can't remember which one exactly).  This fixed my problem immediately.  Good Luck.\n\nA: Smart playlists are nothing more than a folder which searches your entire iTunes library. For example, say you have a smart playlist for pop songs:\nthe playlist shows you only the songs for that search term.\nThe smart playlist isn't a playlist, it's just a search folder. There is nothing in it—it's completely empty. So, you cannot sync a search token to your iPhone.\n", "Q: Problem with getting attachments on apple mail I occasionally have an issue that if I open up an email on my iphone or ipad that has an attachment, when I open it up on my macbook in mail the message will appear but without the attachment.  How can I fix this?  If I forward myself the message it will appear with the attachment but I'm getting tired of doing that.\n\nA: I had this behavior often when View > Mail> As pure text was selected. \nSelecting Best alternative did show the attachments.\n", "Q: How do you delete music on iTunes Match if already deleted entirely from Mac? I was deleting an album on my iTunes Match enabled Mac and I forgot to check the box that says, \"Also Delete from Cloud\" and I deleted the files themselves by not selecting \"Keep Files.\" So now the album is entirely gone from my library and Mac but it is still in the cloud, able to be downloaded from my iPhone. How must one delete music from the cloud so it may not count towards the 25,000 song limit? \n\nA: Login to your iTunes Account in iTunes!\nOn the right hand side, there is a menu where you can click on a button which says: \"Bought Content\" (i'm a German User). There you have a list of all your media bought on iTunes!\nDownload your Music which you want to delete again, and then delete it correctly on your Mac!\n", "Q: Silencing the Memory slot utility I recently upgraded my Mac Pro with 24Gb of ram, quite the nice feeling.\nWhen I booted up the system again, I got this message :\n\nQuite nice I thought, seems the memory is working as it should. And apparently, it is.\nBut now, every time I reboot my computer, Memory Slot Utility feels the need to tell me this again. Ive been trying to find a setting or app for this Memory Slot Utility, but with no luck.\nDoes anyone know how to silence this on start alert forever ?\n\nA: You can turn it off by logging in once as the root user. Root's disabled by default, but here's how to enable it and log in as root:\nSteps taken from here:\nhttp://www.dreness.com/blog/?p=231\n\n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder, choose Go –> Go to Folder... (or shift command g), and enter /System/Library/CoreServices\n\n*In the CoreServices folder, open Directory Utility.\n\n*From the Edit menu, choose \"Enable Root User\", and supply a password.\n\n*Open System Preferences –> Users & Groups prefpane, and under Login Options, turn off Automatic Login, and set the login window display to Name and Password.\n\n*Reboot. Log in as root from the login window. Perform one final heroic click of Memory Slot Utility’s OK button, going for maximum style points.\n\n*Log out, log back in as yourself, put settings back the way you like them. I suggest using Directory Utility to disable the root account.\n", "Q: Reinstalling Lion OS using recovery , will it erase my other partition(s) data? I am about to re-install OS Lion on my MacBook Pro. But before that I want to make sure that my data in other partition created, will that be lost to?\nExample I have 3 partitions\n1)Macintosh HD (OS installed in this drive)\n2)Work\n3)Media\nSo if I re-install the OS Lion using recovery mode from HD, will it also wipe out my other two partitions or only will clear \"Macintosh HD\" partition and install a fresh Lion copy?\n\nA: The Lion Recovery HD can be a very misleading name. Especially if you're familiar with PC vender recovery solutions. The Lion Recovery HD [or disc] is, in functionality and feature, just like booting of an Mac OSX Installation Disc. \nWhen you boot into the Recovery partition [or disc] and start the process, you will be asked to select which disk you wish to restore [which actually means install to]. You will see a list of your three partitions to which you select your \"Macintosh HD\" partition and you're good to go. Any formating that may occur will only occur on your selected partition and not affect any other partitions.\nYou are safe to run the Lion Recovery Partition.\n", "Q: Start program in response to system events (like ip address changes, etc.)? I want to start a program in response to system events, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*IP address changes\n\n*WIFI connectivity changes (whether I'm connected, and/or which network I'm connected to)\n\n*Volume (as in disk) changes\n\n*User logs on or off\n\n*System shuts down or restarts\n\n\nIs there anything built in to do this, or is there a 3rd party tool that can do this for me?\n\nA: ControlPlane has many of the functions you're looking for, though I don't think it has any rules for connected users.  I've been using it for a few months on my work MBP to switch between home and office and it's been quite good.\n", "Q: Cannot Uninstall Application for Desktop Wallpapers I installed an app for desktop wallpapers on a site called Kuvva.com.  It shows up as Purchased in the Application Store but has an option to install it, even though it shows up in System Preferences as already installed.  When I try to click on it, either in App Store to install or in System Preferences to send it to trash, it continues to say cannot delete because it's still open, but I do not see any options to allow me to close it.\nI've tried to go over to Desktop/Screensavers where the picture keeps showing up every morning, but there's no way to get rid of it or close it there either.\n\nA: You can close the Kuvva App via the menu icon.\nAfter that you can drag the application to the trash - enter you user password. Your done!\n\n", "Q: From Mac App Store to an external hard drive Is there any way to download and store app bought from the Mac App Store in an external hard drive and also being able to update them?\n(I'm especially interested in doing this with Xcode)\n\nA: You've asked two separate questions, so I'll answer them separately:\n\nIs there any way to download and store app bought from the App Store in an external hard drive\n\nYes.\nIn the case of Xcode (and Lion), what you are downloading is an installer.\nIf you run the installer from /Applications/ then it is deleted after it finishes installing.\nIf you want to keep it, move it somewhere else after it finishes downloading (before it finishes downloading it won't appear in /Applications/ anyway) and before it finishes installing.\n\nand also being able to update them?\n\nNo. Apple does not (yet?) support \"delta\" updates, so when the next version is released, you will have to download the entire thing.\nThe only purpose for saving the downloads would be if you had another computer you wanted to update, or if you wanted to save it for a potential reinstallation before it is updated.\n\nA: I guess one way is to create a new iTunes library in the external hard drive, and sync you iOS devices with this new library.  Option-Click the iTunes icon to lunch the iTunes will give your options to create new library or choose a library location.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro not outputting audio Yesterday I could play music and actually hear something, but as of today, my MacBook Pro speakers aren't producing any sound at all. \nHere is what I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*rebooting (a cold reboot too) several times\n\n*internal/external speakers\n\n*PRAM reset\n\n*Reinstall iTunes\n\n*Using headphones\n\n\nThere is no red light in the headphone jack.\nThe only thing I did was updating my iTunes to the new 10.5.3 version. But I doubt this is the cause because other programs aren't reproducing any sound too. So, no sound at all on my MacBook Pro (mid 2011). Any idea or hits to get the sound back?\nEDIT\nAnd to make it even more weird, the mail-app is making sound when sending and receiving mails. But iTunes, QuickTime, VLC, Safari,...

I'm selling my MacBook and would like to wipe the hard drive in such a way that the current data can't be easily recovered after I reinstall OS X.\nCan you recommend a free tool to help me do this?\nMaybe I should mention it's an Air model, so something that's safe to use on an SSD.\n\nA: As current hard drive-oriented techniques for file sanitization are ineffective on SSDs, I recommend to encrypt the whole hard drive using Filevault 2 (best if you did this before you put your data onto it).\n(This is only possible in Lion, Filevault 1 in older versions of MacOS will only encrypt your home folder.)\nThis way you will not erase your data, but make them inaccessible without the password.\nYour buyer will then have to reformat and reinstall MacOS for his use.\n\nA: From the Apple Support pages Securely erasing a disk\n\nTo securely erase a disk or partition:\nIn Disk Utility, select the disk or partition to erase, and then click Erase.\n\n*\n\n*Specify a format, and enter a name for the disk.\n\n\n*Click Security Options and choose to write over the data once, 7 times, or 35 times.

It would make transferring files so much faster than using a flash drive. Unfortunately, my Mac is a 2007 Black MacBook, and AirDrop is not supported on this hardware.\nIs there a way to enable AirDrop on my MacBook? Are there any hacks or Terminal tricks to do this?\n\nA: \nHackers have found that Airdrop can be enabled on any Mac running OS X Lion, and will work over ethernet as well. It can be enabled with a shell command.(source: osxdaily)\n\nCopy and paste the command into the terminal of all macs that are supposed to communicate with other hacked macs.\nThis will enable AirDrop over both Wi-Fi and wired Ethernet connections:\ndefaults write com.apple.NetworkBrowser BrowseAllInterfaces 1; killall Finder;\n\nTo disable this feature use:\ndefaults write com.apple.NetworkBrowser BrowseAllInterfaces 0; killall Finder;\n\nNote\nThis does not enable the feature on your Airport card.

Some wi-fi networks require viewing and agreeing to terms before Internet access is allowed.  When my MBP connects to such a network, it attempts to redirect and isn't able to connect. I tried all browsers. However, it works when I boot up Windows on my Mac. Why does it do this? I don't think my /etc/hosts file is messed up. Could anyone give me some insight?\nI am using Lion 10.7.2.\n\nA: I went to Network Preferences, selected the hotel's Wi-Fi name > Advanced > DNS. There I removed the DNS value filled in with the little minus icon and it worked!\n\nA: I had this problem connecting to the local public library system network. The problem seems to be a result of my having specified DNS servers ((i.e. OpenDNS, Google, etc.)) in my Network preferences. The solution was to create a network location called \"No DNS\" which doesn't have any DNS servers defined and use that network location when I need to log into these networks.\n\nA: My library wouldn't let me login until I created a \"new location\" in the network system preferences window. After that, it worked like a charm!\n\nA: The issue we've identified here at our university has to do with security fixes Apple added in 10.7.2 to prevent a security vulnerability.\nWhen you connect to a wifi network your machine attempts to contact http://www.apple.com/library/test/success.html to determine if there's a captive portal in the way. If it fails to get back a \"Success\" it believes that it's been intercepted. You can read about this process in detail if you wish, but it's not pertinent. The popup is leveraging a concept called WISPr.\nWhat was discovered was that there were ways to do an attack on systems this way that tricked users into thinking they were accepting a software install/download from Apple. So now, before that popup shows, the system attempts to check the certificate revocations to verify the popup being shown isn't a fake one.\nThe problem is that not all captive portal systems allow connection to the hosts the machine needs to get to in order to do the verification. If it hijacks their DNS returns then you get this endless failure to proceed.\nThere's four possible ways to cope with this. \nOne requires the people at the captive portal to cope with this (or unbreak their stuff, depending on your outlook) by opening up the capture so Lion can talk to the necessary servers:\ncrl.usertrust.com\nocsp.usertrust.com\ncrl.incommon.org\nocsp.incommon.org\nThe second option seems like a horrible one to me: turn off OCSP and CRL. Don't do it. I'm not going to help you do it. It's a recipe for never revoking corrupted or compromised certificates.\nThe third option is to alter your own machine so that efforts to connect to the above servers simply fails rather than being intercepted by the captive portal. The solution I read suggested updating your hosts file to redirect the above hosts to 127.0.0.1 Since you're presumably not running a certificate authority this will allow the check to error out quickly. However this seems likely to be the same effective result as turning off OCSP. I recommend against it.\nThe fourth option is the most specific and what I did. I added the certificate for my organization's specific captive portal and told it to always trust it. The solution was specified here  and I didn't create it, but here it is reproduced for completeness:\nExport the captive portal's SSL certificate with the following steps:\nVisit the captive portal page in Firefox\nSelect Tools > Page Info > Security > View Certificate > Details > Export\nSave the certificate to your hard drive with the extension \".crt\"\nYou can import the certificate with the following steps:\nOpen Keychain Access.app\nDrag the certificate from Finder into a keychain\nDouble click on the certificate and expand the \"Trust\" section\nChoose \"When using this certificate: Always Trust\"\nClose the popup window.\nSome folks reported corrupted keychains from this problem; I have not had that issue but if you cannot open Keychain Access because your keychain is corrupted, turn off wireless, delete ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain and /Library/Keychains/System.keychain, and then reboot.\n", "Q: How do I change an Application Icon in the Applications Folder?

When I go to the Application Folder it displays correctly. \nHow do I make it display correctly in the Application Folder stack in the Dock? Is there a way to refresh it somehow?\n\nA: Is is a normal behavior for downloaded applications.\nAfter having started the application one time and accepted to open it - log out and back in.\n\nA: This icon is shown on files that have been downloaded from the Internet and not used yet.\nThe first time you open the application, you will see a dialog warning you that you downloaded the application from the Internet and asking if you are sure you want to run it.\nSay yes and run the app, and the icon should soon be changed back to what it should be (you may need to log out and back in).\n\nTo answer your question in general:\nTo change an app's icon, you first need to copy the new icon you want to use to the clipboard.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the image file you want in Preview (found in your Applications folder), select all (⌘+A), and copy (⌘+C).\n\n*Find the app whose icon you want to change.

When I try to sync my iPhone with my computer, I get the following message:\n\n\niTunes could not back up the iPhone \"iPhone Name\"\n  because the backup was corrupt or not compatible\n  with the iPhone.\nDelete the backup for this iPhone, then try again.\n\nYet, here is no option to delete the backup. Where are backups stored / how can I delete the backup?\nThis is iTunes version 10.5.3 running under  Mac OS X 10.6.8.\n\nA: It's somewhat (sadly) common to run into this \"Corrupt/Incompatible\" error. Most of the time the backup is just a little bit buggy.\nI work on a program called Decipher Backup Repair, which scans the backup and shows you/fixes the errors so you can restore in iTunes.\nhttp://deciphertools.com/decipher-backup-repair.html\nHere's an article I wrote with a few other things to try first as well:\nhttps://deciphertools.com/blog/fix-iphone-backup-corrupt/\nFrom that link, you can also poke around to learn more about corrupt backups if you want.\n(Note: As I mentioned, I am the author of the software I'm recommending above, so I stand to benefit from my recommendations. I definitely stand behind our software :) but I like to put a little note like this anyway!)\n\nA: I had the same problem, no idea where it came from. I had a jailbroken iPhone 3G and switched to a non-jailbroken iPhone 4, i.e. I transferred the backup to the new phone, which worked. Some time later, however, I got that error message. I tried the solution above, I even deleted all backups, even the ones not related to that phone, but the error persisted.\nI found a solution in a comment to the thread iPhone could not backup because backup file was corrupt or not compatible, fix, more details in a following comment. Here’s what to do, summarized:\n(This is a solution for Windows (7), which doesn’t apply to the OP, but his problem seems to have been solved already at any rate.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Close iTunes\n\n*Make sure your Explorer displays hidden files\n\n*Go to C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computers\\MobileSync\\backup\n\n*Delete everything there (or move it somewhere else, to be on the safe side)\n\n\nAnd done. In my case, I deleted two folders with long, cryptic, alphanumeric names, one empty, the other over 1GB in size. When I opened iTunes again, I could create a brand new backup without any errors.\n\nA: The following is the solution if you are getting the corrupt backup error during a sync or backup in iTunes (during a sync, the sync is just triggering a backup):\nDuring a sync or backup, deleting the backup is the way to go, and iTunes will create a new one from scratch. However, the original poster has the additional issue that the backup isn't appearing in iTunes.\n@doncherry has the correct idea -- if iTunes isn't listing your backup in the Preferences->Devices list, then you need to delete the backup manually. He has pointed out the location to look in Windows. On a Mac, the backups are stored in  \n/Users/<your username>/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup\n\nOpen Finder, (hold the option key on OSX Lion or higher), and select Library from the Go menu. This will open the Application Support folder, and from there, go to MobileSync -> Backup. In the backup folder, there will be one or more folders named by your devices' unique identifiers.\nIn iTunes, click on the Serial Number in the Info tab for your device, and the Serial Number field will switch to your device identifier. Match the identifier you see there to a folder name in the MobileSync -> Backup folder. Delete that folder!\n\nIf you are getting the corrupt backup error during a restore in iTunes, clearly deleting the backup isn't going to help you get your data restored ;)!\nI'm the lead developer on a program called Decipher Backup Repair, which is why I know and care so much about iTunes backup and restore errors ;) Decipher Backup Repair will scan your corrupt or damaged iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch backup for errors and fix the problems in the backup so you can restore in iTunes. You can download the free trial from our website to see what it can find in your backup.\nhttp://deciphertools.com/decipher-backup-repair.html\n\n(Clearly, I stand to benefit from the links I am posting in this answer, as the author of the software.

Anyone is also welcome to follow the links above and navigate to our support page to send us an email if you have questions about your corrupted backup. Feel free to mention my name directly: Kelly.)\n\nA: I had this issue also, but there were no backups listed in Preferences. My solution revolved around not having my external hard drive connected, which is where iTunes was storing my iPhone backup files. Connecting the hard drive solved the issue.\n\nA: From within iTunes navigate to the menu iTunes > Preferences > Devices. Select the backup file, then hit the delete button:\n\n\nA: I had the same problem : can't restore a previous backup, even using right click on my iphone in iTunes.\nI had a good backup in the directory : \nC:\\Documents and Settings\\myuser\\Application Data\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup\nbut iTunes didn't detect it. \nSo I copied the full \"Backup\" directory in another location (copied, not moved)\nThen I create a new iphone with Itunes after restoring ipsw file, given the same name as it has previously. \nI did a sync+backup. \nAt the end I checked the \"Backup\" directory and saw that Itunes recreated the same folder as the one I had copied earlier. \nThis time in Ituens when I right click my iphone, I have the menu \"restore from backup\". But before select this option, I just renamed the new created directory in Backup to xxx.old , and copy back the saved one (the one with same name) into the C:\\Documents and Settings\\franckca\\Application Data\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup directory.\nWhen the restoration was done, I recovered my last backup. \nHope this helps.\n\nA: I also ran into this issue. Turns out after I made the backup of my iPhone, Windows defender detected a file from one of the apps that I had downloaded as a malware. When I looked into the file, it indeed was a malware however removing it from the back up directory cause the restoration process to fail repeatedly.\nIt wasn't until I restored the file back in the backup directory that the restoration completed successfully. I would highly recommend to disable antivirus and malware detection programs while doing iPhone backup and restoration. \nHope this helps.\n\nA: I've had this happen 2-3 times in the last few years when doing processor intensive tasks while iTunes was backing up my phone. Deleting the corrupt backup, rebooting the computer and backing up the iPhone again took care of the problem.\n", "Q: How can I keep 200 recent photos on my iPhone and the rest on my Mac? I have about 1500 photos in my camera roll. Because of this, my iPhone has about 2GB worth of photos. I would like to have only the most recent 200 photos on my iPhone and the rest on my Mac. How can I do this?\n\nA: I don't have an answer to your specific question--keeping the 200 (exactly) most recent photos on your phone, but I can give you a suggestion that may satisfy the spirit, if not the letter, of your request.\nConnect the iPhone to your Mac and load the photos into iPhoto (or Aperture if you prefer). Choose the option to delete the photos after they've been loaded into iPhoto. This removes the photos from your camera roll.\nIn iTunes, set your iPhone to sync to selected Albums albums... and include events from the last three months. (Other time frames are available). You can also include albums, events or faces that you want to always keep on the phone. (for example, I have an album that contains a variety of photos of my niece and nephew from various events.) You can create Smart Albums that include photos meeting defined criteria, for example photos of my nephew taken within a certain date range AND containing the keyword \"sailing\". This will put a selection of recent (and special) photos into your iPhone Photo Library (and into the various albums within that Library). All of the photos are kept on your Mac (and should be part of your backup scheme) but the defined subset, plus the contents of your camera roll, will be on the iPhone.\nAs noted above, you can do the same thing using Aperture if that's your preferred photo management solution. iCloud can also help to automate the transfer of photos from iPhone to Mac, but you need to run iPhoto from time to time and I like to move my pictures into titled projects. (I'm an Aperture user.)\n\nAgain, it won't give you exactly 200 pictures, but it will give a subset selection of recent--or desired--photographs.\n", "Q: Seeking OS X app recommendation: instant text entry I'm looking for an app (or script) that does this:\n\n\n*\n\n*I hit a global shortcut key chord.\n\n*A one-line text entry box appears.\n\n*I enter a line of text and hit ENTER.\n\n*The text is saved somewhere, perhaps as a plaintext file on the local filesystem.\n\n*I'm looking at the same screen I was before step 1, without any more clicks, keys, or delays.\n\n\nThat's it.  The purpose is simply to have a muscle-memory way of recording a very brief thought.  Please don't suggest a solution that involves a heavy app with lots of features -- for the sake of this OP, that fails the requirements.\nThis description sounds a lot like Twitter, and given that many OS X Twitter clients could be configured to fulfill this behavior, I don't want a Twitter client.\n\nA: You can do this without any third party software. Just use Automator to create your own Service that appends the input string to any text file.\n\nOpen Automator and select to create a new Service that receives no input in any application.\nFrom the Library, drag the Run AppleScript action to the area on the right, and use the following script code:\non run {input, parameters}\n    return text returned of (display dialog \"Enter some text:\" default answer \"\")\nend run\n\nThen, add a Run Shell Script action that receives input to stdin, and replace the default script with the following:\ncat >> /Users/danielbeck/notes.txt\n\nInstead of /Users/danielbeck/notes.txt, specify any path.\nHere's what it looks like in Automator:\n\n\n\nSave as e.g. Add Note, and assign a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences » Keyboard » Keyboard Shortcuts » Services » General » Add Note\nHere's the dialog box:\n\nYou can press Cancel, Escape, or Cmd-Period to cancel.\n\nYou can even change how the notes appear in the text file through changes to the Run Shell Script action. For example, you can use the following instead, if you reconfigure the Run Shell Script action to receive input as arguments instead:\necho $( date +\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\" ) \"$@\" >> /Users/danielbeck/notes.txt\n\nIt will look like this in the resulting file:\n2012-01-30 12:38:56 foo\n2012-01-30 12:38:58 bar\n\n\nA: The QuickJot feature of Shovebox does this. Yojimbo also has a hot key feature, but the input box will be a little more complex. Both of these will store \"files\" within the application, not in the file system per say. \nIf you are dead set on storing plain text in the file system Notational Velocity or nvAlt may better suit your needs.\n\nA: notational velocity would be a very good choice & it's free.\nsimply set up a global hotkey & enter the text\nyou can also customize the size of the window\n\nA: I use totalterminal for this along with vim. I press ctrl twice and it drops me into vim, where I can add to an open notes file.  I pressume you could probably get away with just keeping textedit open on a notes.txt but I like the colours of terminal :) \n", "Q: Will iCloud back it up? I recently installed iCloud into my iPod touch 4th generation. I'm thinking about resetting my iPod because of some problems I've been having lately. Will iCloud back up/save all my info, apps, etc? Thanks!\n\nA: It will save your info and redownload your apps for you, but it will also bring back any software issues you were trying to get rid of. What info were you most concerned with?\n", "Q: iTunes library for multiple machines I have multiple machines with iTunes installed (mac and pc) and a Windows server with a file share hosting my music. I would like :\n\n\n*\n\n*All machines to use one data repository but still have the metadata synced (play count, rating etc...). \n\n*All machines reflect changes when I buy a song on one machine or delete a song on one machine. (no broken references or missing entries)\n\n*The music repository to always be running (my Windows server always is).\n\n\nCurrently I have my machines pointed to a UNC path (\\\\server\\music) which works to share a repository but iTunes Music Library.xml is stored on each machine and it gets out of sync. Update iTunes Library.itl may be the real library, and the XML is just a backup.\nAre there any iTunes server apps out there that will do this? What about iTunes home sharing...? Someone wrote an app called iTunes library updater which I used to use to sync my libraries but its not being updated anymore.\nEDIT - I should note, I also use iCloud and iTunes match. \n\nA: The best way to go, in my opinion, for a flawless and easy experience would be iTunes Match. It doesn't only allow you to play your tunes on iOS devices, but also on other desktop computers running iTunes, and it Syncs everything via the cloud, including all your metadata, so basically you'd have your iTunes library wherever you have internet. \nIt costs 25 USD a year (plus extra storage, if you have more than 5GB of songs that are not in the iTunes Store), though if you can spare it you not only get the syncing, but also the upgrade of all your tunes to 256kbps ACC sound.\nHome sharing also works, and does update your play counts if you enable it to under Preferences > Sharing, but it will pretty much just open a \"read-only\" version of your library on the rest of the computers; you cannot edit metadata, change rating, or even browse your library in any but the list view mode, plus of course, if the computer disconnects from the network it looses all access to the music, for Home Sharing makes no local copy in each machine.\nOther methods should work, I believe, to share your music, but yeah, I remember I tried some time ago and I didn't manage to keep the iTunes Library file and thus data like play counts in sync.\nBtw, I believe the file iTunes Library.itl is the main resource for the Library Database, and the iTunes Music Library.xml file is just a \"backup\" and a way for other applications to access data of the library if they need it, so you would need to keep in the .itl file in sync.\nGood Luck!\nKevin\n\nA: I have been using SuperSync for synchronizing my Mac's iTunes library with my wife's Windows system, and it been worked quite well.  This approach avoids storage fees, since everything is on your own disks.\n", "Q: Why does Safari freeze on YouTube HTML5 videos? I'm in YouTube HTML5 trial, and the experience is terrible with Safari.\nEvery video is lagging severely, and the browser gets unresponsive constantly.  \nI have zero problems with the Flash version, and Chrome handles HTML5 YouTube just fine.\nActivity Monitor says QTKitServer - Safari Web Content grabs more than 100% CPU.\nCan I fix this?\n\nI have 17-inch Mid 2010 MacBook Pro running Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2 with 8 GB of RAM.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with my Safari. I went into /Library/Internet Plug-Ins and removed the two piece of Flash cruft (regretfully I'm at work, so I don't the exact file names.)  After a reboot, Safari worked much better, as did Chrome.  Not sure why Chrome improved, but it improved most of all.\nIncidentally, I thought I was on a Flash free system previously, so I'm not sure how those bits got there.  If I need Flash, I just go to Develop -> Open Page With -> Chrome (you need to enable the Developer Menu, under Advanced in Preferences.)\nHope this help\n", "Q: Is there a VGA to Thunderbolt/mini DisplayPort adapter? I am looking for an adapter to connect my Apple display to a Sony notebook via VGA, so I need the reverse of this one:\n\nDoes such a product exist?\n\nA: VGA is an analog signal and your Cinema requires digital so you need more than a simple cable. You need an appropriate interface box, called a VGA to DVI Scaler, such as the Gefen VGA to DVI Scaler Plus. (Shown for reference only—this is not a recommendation.)\nYou will also need the appropriate adaptor to use the DVI signal with your monitor.\nPlease note that I don't have experience with these products and can't guarantee results—particularly if your Display is the thunderbolt-equipped model. Contact the vendors to assure yourself that it will work.\n\nA: You will need a VGA to DVI scaler ($330 in mentioned link) + DVI to MDP adapter like this one ($70). And after that no guarantee that it will work all together.\n", "Q: Streaming video from shared Mac folder to AppleTV? I just bought a new AppleTV and will be getting it soon, and I want to know how I can stream my movies which are located on a shared drive to it?\nRight now, my videos are in a folder which is shared by my MBP (which is running SL) and have various formats. I've been trying to find a way to show these on my ATV without having to convert them.\nI've heard about AirFlick, but I'm running Lion and apparently it doesn't work (someone tell me I'm wrong). I also vaguely remember a way to stream it to my iPhone4, and then stream that to AirPlay on the ATV?\n\nA: You are right about streaming to the iPhone (or iPad) and then to the ATV. Check out the VLC streamer. The application is installed on iOS, and a companion app goes on the computer. VLC Streamer will transcode non-native video (e.g., AVI) from the computer, pipe it to the iOS device, and then pipe that to the ATV via AirPlay. I have tested this and it works exactly as described. The quality of your results will be dependent, of course, on your LAN bandwidth and processing speed of the machines. You can set some of these parameters in VLC Streamer, though, which maximizes output. Enjoy!\n\nA: You can use AirFlick with Lion as long as you use it in tandem with AirVideo. Check out this blog post for instructions. It worked for me. \nhttp://johncaruso.ca/index.php?post=360\n\nA: If they're MPEG-4 formatted videos, just add them to iTunes.  ATV will play anything in your iTunes (must be MP4 though, not AVI even if iTunes would play it).\nIf you want non-MP4 video, you'll need to jailbreak your ATV & install Plex.\n", "Q: Alternative to pressing home button to stop rearranging apps? To stop rearranging apps (i.e. after holding the finger down on an app so that they all start to shake, make them stop shaking again), the home button is used.

I have a white 2010 MacBook, and the outer casing for the wire on the MagSafe power adapter has developed a small split. Is this something that may be covered under my MacBook's AppleCare? Is it something that a genius might give me a \"one time exception\" for?\n\n\nA: Troubleshooting MagSafe adapters\n\nWhether your product is in or out of warranty, you can take your adapter to an Apple Authorized Service Provider or Apple Retail Store for evaluation and replacement if necessary. Pending the results of the evaluation, you may or may not be eligible for a replacement adapter free of charge. Signs of accidental damage would negate any coverage. Be sure to bring in the computer used with the adapter; it is required to process potential adapter replacements.\n\nSo there are competing things at play. If your cable is otherwise pristine, no bends, no mars, no scuffs and it's clearly not worn - you might think that this split could be caused by either abuse/nick/cut/carelessness or perhaps not holding up as designed. If the rest of the adapter cord is worn and starting to show normal signs that it's just wearing out (no cord lasts forever, especially when wrapped, unwrapped, tugged) you might be asked to pay for a replacement if it's not clear the physical separation was a defect in manufacturing.\nIf Apple didn't make the cable correctly, it's likely it would fail immediately, but the longer the time that passes until you take it in for service, it's more likely to be an external force causing the tear. Usually by inspecting the rest of the cable (not pictured) you will see other signs of excessive force so absent those signs of stretching and tearing, this might be covered despite what looks like an obvious cut/rip due to a tug.\n\nA: Provided your Applecare is still valid, it can be used to claim on any faulty or damaged cable. \nI took a cable I bought on Amazon back to them with my laptops Applecare number (and told them the truth about it - I didn't pretend it belonged with my Mac) and received a replacement free of charge.\nIt's definitely worth making an Genius bar appointment about it, provided you purchased the 3-year Applecare package - as a 2010 machine will be out of warrantee otherwise, and they may not cover the cable (although the others before me seem to think they will). \n\nA: For me, it finally came to a point where it tore on its own. It was just naturally stretching and breaking. This was happening without me even doing anything. I've had it for 11 months now. I've never had problems with laptop chargers; this is the first time.\nI went to the Apple Store in Grand Central Station in New York City. The guy who was doing the appointments for the Genius Bar workers said that they wouldn't cover it so don't even bother wasting your time, but when I went to another Apple Store in New Jersey — they covered it with no questions asked.\n\nA: I have the same problem except there are other signs of bulging along the cable.  The computer is less than a month old and treated like a goddess with care.  I went back to the Apple store and was accused that I damaged it.  There are no scuffs, crushes, or any sign of physical interference. This looks to me as a manufacturing fault of both the cable sheath being weak and the outer shield being wound with uneven tension.  Apple needs to make good on this and have better customer response.  Needless to say, this is my last Mac. \n\nA: No they don't, they wouldn't replace mine and mine is dangerous \n\nA: AppleCare does cover your MagSafe adapter and Apple also replaces any cables that are dangerous so if you take it down to your Apple Store then they will replace it for you.\n", "Q: Viewing the Account Name of multiple Apps in iTunes We have several people using the same computer and the same user account. However, each person has a different iTunes account.\nWith respect to the Apps section, is there anyway to view the ownership of multiple Apps?

When iOS 5 first came out, I added my @me address to my iPhone and iPad. People could iMessage me at my email address, and I'd see it on both devices. This wasn't always perfect, and recently I decided to forgo this, and just use my phone number on my phone and email address on the iPad.\nSo, I switched the caller ID on my phone to the phone number again, deleted all my text message threads that were created when I was using the email address, and started a new thread. Somebody who didn't have my email address saved in their contact asked why my text messages were coming from an email address, and another reception confirmed that when he tapped 'Contact Info' at the top of the message thread, my email address was highlight in blue, NOT my phone number - indicated that this is where the message was coming from.\nDoes anybody know why this is happening? Is there another setting I need to change? I'd really prefer to not have them come from my email address, because then any replies will goto both my phone and my iPad - which I don't want.\n\nA: Go to settings on the iPhone.\nGo to the 'Messages' settings.\nAnd select Receive At.\nSee what it says there. \nIt should be your phone number not Apple ID or email.\nIf you have a Apple email listed. You can remove it by.\nClicking the 'Apple ID youremail@me.com'\nYou will get a popup which lets sign out thus removing the mac email address.\n\n\nA: Try to see if your phone number shows up on top in the \"Receive At\" setting. \nIf it doesn't, there are some reported cases where people have solved the problem by turning off iMessage, resetting Network Settings and then turn iMessage back on. \nI've had some difficulties in verifying my number one time I swapped the SIM card for another one and then back to the original SIM, and I managed to get it active again by doing this reset. \nPlease note that you'll lose all the memorized Wi-Fi networks and their passwords by doing this.\nMeanwhile you should also disable \"Send As SMS\". In case an iMessage doesn't get delivered, the only difference is that it will ask if you want to send it as a SMS. \nI wouldn't worry to delete your previous message threads. Your iPhone will handle that. They will surely appear as a different thread on your friends' iOS device, because they come from a different sender. \nPlease let me know if this solves your problem. \n\nA: Type in the person's entire phone number and do not select their name from the drop down list when it pops up.

Lately I've noticed the trackpad on my MacBook Pro has been getting stuck from time to time and generally isn't as clicky as it used to be. It feels to me like there's something stuck behind the trackpad there that's stopping it from moving freely, but I have no idea how to get behind there and clean it, let alone how anything could have gotten in there in the first place. The trackpad will press all the way down on the bottom left and right corners, but towards the bottom centre it does not press down nearly as easily.\nHas anyone had any luck cleaning behind the MacBook trackpad? If so how did you do it?\n\nA: The tolerances in the unibody macs are very, very tight and the area is located behind the battery, so Apple does not recommend users without training on servicing the delicate back sides of the battery clean it other than spraying air lightly from the outside. I've found setting it up vertically and open helps with gravity bringing the grit towards the most open side of the trackpad. (The part closest to you that swings free and presses on the physical spring.)\nIt's not hard to find the tools or the steps - iFixit.com has both, but I prefer to take it in to the genius bar for cleaning as long as it's a convenient trip. If you're careful, you should be able to get inside the mac and see how much debris is inside and whether it's worth a trip to the shop or to learn how to clean it better yourself. Getting the back off is all you need following the memory replacement instructions to have a peek.\n\nA: Some other basic ideas:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power off the Mac, wipe the area down furiously with cotton balls and isopropyl alcohol. This can't hurt unless you get so much alcohol in the trackpad and onto the battery that it doesn't evaporate before you power things on again. Capillary action can \"wick\" liquid extremely well, so be frugal if you are not familiar with cleaning computers with alcohol. \n\n*Use compressed air to blast around the borders of the trackpad to dislodge any hand salsa (etc) that's stuck there. This is best done before cleaning with alcohol or after it has dried. \n\nA: Compressed air is probably the best cleaning tool for assembled electronic equipment, and can be found in aerosol-style cans from most electronic component suppliers.\nif you can disassemble the equipment and remove any plastic, then you can use switch cleaner or iso-propyl alcohol, but I wouldn't recommend either for fully assembled electronic equipment - they have a tendency to melt plastic spacers and the like.\n\nA: I discovered a solution for this problem (or a similar problem). Mine is a late 2013 retina macbook pro. I take the last page of a stack of post-its and use that to snake underneath the trackpad from the top. It is the placticy coated page on the bottom of the stack. even generics. It reminds me of very thin teflon.\nAnyhow, as someone mentioned earlier, the gaps around the trackpad are not even. One side is wider than the other. That just means some gaps will be harder to get into.\nInsert the paper into the gap and gently run it back and forth. Start with short travel, just enough to work it back and forth. Expand the stroke a bit as it becomes easier.\nYou will have to keep changing the paper because it get consumed reeming the gap.\nWork around the corners too. Keep the paper underneath the pad as you work it around.\nI did not spill anything on my track pad but it sure made a difference in the clicking. Before it was erratic. I tried quite a few other methods and this is the only one that has worked once and for all.\nThe paper pulls out some dirt so I suspect this may be a routine maintenance issue over time.\n", "Q: Convert .help to .pdf I can save in .pdf just one or two pages at one time, using default Mac viewer.

So far, I know how I can merge all windows with all their tabs using:\n\nI use different windows in safari to organize them by content. Sometimes it makes sense to merge the tabs of two windows. This very easy when you have only two Safari windows open.\nHow can I do this when I have more than two windows? I'm open to solutions using extensions.\n\nA: You can drag tabs between windows in safari (I beleive this was added in Safari 4 along with a few other improvements)\n\nA: If you have many tabs open in a window, it might become hard to drag each of them over. In this case you could bookmark all pages in the current window (Bookmarks > Add Bookmark for These Tabs...), go to the window you want to put these tabs into, and then select Bookmarks > (Folder you put tabs as bookmarks into) > Open in New Tabs.\nDo note however that this will cause all of your tabs in the window you bookmarked to be closed. You should only use this method if you are okay with that.\n\nA: First, if the tab bar isn't showing (it usually doesn't show unless there are multiple tabs in the window), select the 1st window you want to merge, then at the menu bar at the top of the screen click View->Show Tab Bar.

Based on my experience for the two minutes for which my device was jailbroken, I saw little difference between a jailbroken device and nonjailbroken device. All I noticed was a little Cydia icon.

Is Cydia really the only starting point, or do other settings magically appear in the Settings app or elsewhere? Are there other benefits?\n\nA: My understanding is only Cydia.  Everything that changes the phone via jailbreak comes in via Cydia. :)\n\nA: That'd be correct. Cydia is your gateway to everything that makes the jailbreak remotely worth it. At current, there are several jailbreaks that greatly enhance Siri's functionality, among a host of other goodies.\n", "Q: How to make a LaunchAgent with StartCalendarInterval I want to start replacing crontabs with LaunchAgents.

Is this normal / is the button on mine defective? I'm aware that I am probably being over-careful, but on my old i4 the home button gave up entirely after 14 months. \n\nA: The fastest way to get a quick read would be to take it into any of the retail stores. You could check with 4 or 5 floor models and something like that is pretty easy to feel by setting a few phones down on the table and getting two or three people to compare them.\nIt's likely something small is stuck inside the switch area (like a grain of sand or smaller) or the spring got physically depressed more than it should.\nYou might get it swapped if the feel of the button is different or at least get it seen at the bar and have the genius write it up so there is a history of it not feeling perfect on the service record. (just in case you want to call in for a repair later over the phone)\n", "Q: How to disable \"new network interfaces have been detected\" prompt on Mac OS X Lion? I get this uber annoying prompt every single time I plug my Macbook Air into my Thunderbolt display. Does anyone please know of a way to disable this?\nThanks a lot!\n\nA: Go to System Preferences/Network and accept said interface as you own.\n\nA: In some cases the interface can be accepted in System Preferences/Network. In my case there was no interface to accept. If the interface does not appear in the System Preferences the interface can still be created using the the command line command networksetup -detectnewhardware. This will require administrator privileges and create the interface.\n", "Q: Move through images in a folder with Preview.app When looking at an image in a directory with the Preview application, I'm used to the Windows behaviour of using the ←/→ keys to move through all the other viewable images in that directory.\nPreview.app doesn't do this - I first have to select all the images and then open Preview.app. This is a little annoying.\nIs there something I can turn on or install to get this behaviour?\nAlso, how do I open an image in a new instance of Preview.app, say for comparison purposes?\n\nA: I recommend using Xee instead of Preview, and that will allow you to jump from photo to photo in a directory after only opening one.  If you wish to change Xee to the default photo viewer, just right click on the file with the type that you want to change the default for, choose \"Get Info\", and select \"Xee\" under open with.  Then, press \"Change All...\"\nTo answer your second question, you can open a new instance of Preview by opening one image, then double-clicking and opening the second image.  Preview automatically realizes that you want a new instance (that is, of course, if Preview is your default application for that file type).\n\nA: You could also try Sequential. The last update was in 2010, but it's still less buggy than Preview.\n\n\nA: Select all of the photos by pressing  \" Command + A\" and then right click \"open with preview\" it will open all of your selected photos and you can scroll through them!\n\nA: start Preview, File > Open... > name_of_folder > Open\nPreview will open a window, displaying all the images in the folder, with a sidebar of thumbnails. Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate.\nI'm using Preview on High Sierra.\n\nA: If you are just skimming the pictures do this:\nInstead of opening a picture in Preview.app by double-clicking it, press space to preview the picture in Quick Look when selected in Finder.\n\nQuick Look offers a fast, full-size preview of nearly any kind of file without opening the file. You can rotate photos, trim audio and video clips, and use Markup — directly in the Quick Look window.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh14119/mac\n\nThis way you can still use the arrow keys to navigate between the pictures.\n\n*\n\n*↑ and ↓ in list view\n\n*↑,↓,← and → in icon view\n\nYou can still open the picture in Preview.app when needed (top right corner).\n\n\nA: Does not answer the question for Preview.app but I started using qView and am quite happy with it.\nIt's lightweight, can move between pictures with arrow keys and zoom in/out.\n\nA: Preview can be used for much more than just a quick glance at an image file when you get out of the habit using it like on a Windows machine. \nTo open up the power of Preview, I keep it on the dock so it is handy all the time (doesn't have to be open and running). Select the group of files you want to see, or just drag the whole folder to the dock, and drop on Preview. \nCheck in Previews presences under the General tab and check the \"Open groups of files in same window\" is checked. Preview will open with all the images in a side bar and some buttons will appear on the bottom right in OSX before Lion. On Lion there wil be buttons at the top by the Search box. Before Lion one of these buttons is \"Contact Sheet\"; when you click on it a Slider will appear and you can adjust the size of the thumbnails. In Lion one is called thumbnails and you can drag the divider bar to change the size. \nBy dropping multiple files on Preview you can now do batch operations too, like adjust the size, or flip and rotate. You can easily crop images and do color adjusts in Preview as well. Preview does more than these things too if you will spend a little time learning about it.\nTo open an image in a new window after you have done the above, just right click on the image in the side bar and choose \"Open in a new window\".\n\nA: Select all of the pictures in the directory at once and double click them. \nThat will open them all up in Preview at the same time, and you can use the down/up arrow keys to view them sequentially, just like you mentioned in windows.\n\nA: Since I prefer using keyboard shortcut, I generally use like: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open the directory & select all pictures using -  \"⌘ + A\"\n\n*Use - \"⌘ + ↓\" to open the selected images using default app (Preview.app)\n\n\nA: You can use Hot Simple Image Viewer\nIt has keyboard shortcuts you are looking for.\n\nA: Drop your folder onto Preview.app and then you can do as you desire with the keyboard moving between images.\nMy favourite alternate to this is using QuickLook:\n\n*\n\n*Cmd+A to select all images in a folder\n\n*Space to QuickLook\n\n*Keyboard to change image\n\n*Markup to edit/crop image if required\n\n", "Q: Why does mobile Safari revert to \"Never accept cookies\"? Every few days Safari on my iPhone (iOS 5.0.1) reverts to \"Never\" accept cookies. I put it to \"From Visited\" but it switches back shortly thereafter.\nDiscussion elsewhere suggests an Exchange link may be at fault (and I do download email from a work account) but nothing conclusive.\nThis problem breaks logging in to most web sites.\n\nA: Possible fixes:\nMake sure there are no restrictions on cookie permissions, if you are a part of an Exhange account.\nIt has been reported that turning off iCloud Bookmarks may fix this issue. To do this; Tap Settings > iCloud and then tap the Bookmarks slider off.\n", "Q: What is webfilterdnsd process? What is webfilterdnsd process running on my machine? Its started by user \"nobody\". Not able to find any other information on it online. How can I get more information on processes running on my mac?\n\n\nA: Although it doesn't answer your question directly, the excellent\nhttp://triviaware.com/macprocess/all\nis a web resource that describes many Mac processes. \nIt describes webfilterDNSd as:\n\"Process is part of clean OS X install however there is no description available from credible sources at this moment.

I then looked for information on how to unjailbreak it. I found out that I need to press the sleep/power button and the home button, after the steps, on my iPod there's a picture saying to plug the iPod onto iTunes and I did so. Then I pressed for the iTunes to restore my iPod, and it said that an error happened.\nPlease, can anyone help me either to sync my iPod without unjailbreaking? But if there's no way, can anyone teach me how to jailbreak my iPod Touch safely?\nAlso, now my iPod screen is stuck on the image that tells me to connect to iTunes.\n\nA: You can unjailbreak an iPod or any other iDevice by restoring the device from a previously unjailbroken backup or you can download the latest update from Apple for your device and install that. IF there is one. \nApple doesn't want people jailbreaking so all you have to do is update the IOS or restore to an old non-jailbroken copy and it will 'unjailbreak' it. \n\nA: You might try pressing the power and home buttons again and try to get it to boot back into iOS.  Then, try the restore process again.\n", "Q: Proper backup procedure for upgrading to iOS 5? I keep telling my Dad to upgrade his iPod touch from iOS 4 to iOS 5, and his response is \"but I'll lose all my data\". Can I be confident that simply backing up by right clicking in iTunes and clicking \"backup\" from the menu will backup the iPod exactly as it is, so that it can be restored with the only difference being the new OS? I seem to remember reading that iOS devices keep two partitions, one for data and one for the OS, so in theory this should be good to go. I'm just not sure if there's anything obvious that I'm missing. \nDoes backing up in iTunes preserve absolutely everything from photos to contacts to home screen layout? If not, is there a way to back it up manually?\n\nA: Well, your backups store all of your data, excluding media and apps.  But, if you have been syncing with iTunes, all of your media should be already there.  And, the upgrade process does not wipe data so you should be good to go.\n\nA: Upgrading the OS should keep all his data intact, but iTunes always makes a backup before syncing (and updating).\nYou'll find everything you need to know about iOS device backups here:\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/144086/2009/11/tco_iphoneos3.html\nI don't think it's mentioned explicitly in the macworld article but in my own experience I found out that the home screen layout is a part of the backup.\nI have to note here that when iTunes makes a backup it tends to replace the previous backup with the new one. So if there's a backup you want to keep no matter what or you simply prefer to keep multiple backups (in case one of them turns out to be corrupted for example), you'll need to manually change the name of a backup.\nhttp://techtips.salon.com/make-one-iphone-backup-3664.html\nGood luck with the upgrade!\n", "Q: Local DNS server access delays Access to a local DNS server is always delayed by ~1 second.\nI enabled the DNS server on OS-X Lion and it does indeed work.  However when I query it using 'dig' (or nslookup) there is a delay of about 1 second before the reply is given. This delay is not reported by 'dig', which gives a response time of 0ms. \nSo for example a query using the OpenDNS servers completes sooner than one to the local server despite the name resolution taking 135ms longer:\n$ time dig @208.67.220.220 ibm.com\n;; Query time: 135 msec\nreal    0m0.172s\nuser    0m0.008s\nsys 0m0.006s\n$ time dig @localhost ibm.com\n;; Query time: 0 msec\nreal    0m1.068s\nuser    0m0.009s\nsys 0m0.007s\nThe delay does not seem to be in the named server, as when using named -g to view logs there is also a 1s delay before the request is printed. \nFYI: my changes to enable DNS were:\nrndc-confgen -b 256 > /etc/rndc.conf\nhead -n5 /etc/rndc.conf | tail -n4 > /etc/rndc.key\nedit /etc/rndc.conf to correct port number\nedit  /etc/named.conf to add this to the options:\nforward first;\nforwarders {\n    208.67.222.222;\n    208.67.220.220;\n};\n\nrun named from the shell (/usr/sbin/named -g)\n\nA: If you have 127.0.0.1 localhost in /etc/hosts you also need to add a ::1 localhost line.\nYou may find that the delay has something to do with resolving the name 'localhost'. If you use 127.0.0.1 instead, the delay should be reduced to milliseconds.\n$ time dig @127.0.0.1  muc.de\n;; Query time: 10 msec\nreal 0m0.029s\nuser 0m0.007s\nsys 0m0.005s\nI don't know where the resolution of 'localhost' occurs or why it takes such a long time, but I guess it doesn't really matter...\n", "Q: Looking for an iOS app to announce the time Is there an application for iOS devices similar to \"Announce the time\" feature in Mac OS X? This feature simply announces time every hour/half hour/quarter hour with preselected voice.\nMy idea is that I would start playing music or podcast or run some game, and this app would announce the time in timely fashion (from the background). I searched the App Store for some obvious keywords, but didn't find anything useful yet.\n\nA: As Joe indicated, the reason why you have not found an app to do this is because apps simply can't.\nBackgrounding apps can do very little, and even things that they can do are limited to generating a notification which you must acknowledge in order for the app to actually carry out it's task. For example; Skype can background and detect a call, but you must still acknowledge the notification to open the app, and have anything meaningful actually occur. Additionally, backgrounded radio stations / audio streams can continue to stream, and even change channels or support some feature that responds to the \"skip forward\" and \"skip backward\" media controls, but if the network connection is broken the app is suspended and will not do anything further until you re-open it.\nSadly, this is also not part of the accessibility features built into iOS, perhaps you could file a bug and request the feature be added in a future software version?\n\nA: I think this might run up against the 'backgrounding' issue - unless your phone is jailbroken... On the other hand it's not far from what the nikePlus app does where it talks over your music... On a jailbroken device it's relatively simple to write a script for it I think (I just ssh'd into my device and a combination of 'speak' and 'date' commands at the terminal produced the behaviour you're looking for...).\n\nA: You could achieve this in a roundabout manner using Prowl, which will get you a growl notification pushed to your iOS device.  Setup a simple script that uses growlnotify to push the time via a cronjob, and setup prowl to push it out to your iOS.  It may not be exact timing, but it's a possible solution if \"near enough\" is \"good enough\"\n", "Q: Can I set up one Parallels VM to start automatically while leaving the rest off? I set up a Windows 7 VM using parallels (uses boot camp partition - wow its very fast), and another VM running WinXP (for legacy stuff).\nWhat I need is to automatically fire up that Windows 7 VM when I log into MacOS, but NOT run the WinXP VM.\nI see I can right-click on Parallels icon and choose Options > Open at Login, but I am thinking that will either (1) not actually start up my Win7 machine or (2) will run both of them - neither is my desired result.\n\nA: Under the account settings, there is a list of items that run on start up, per user.\nPlace a shortcut to the Windows 7 VM in there, that should do the trick.\n\nA: If you let Parallels close with Windows open (or running), presumably using Mac's open as left function, it'll re-open on reboot in the same state? \n", "Q: MacBook has poor Bluetooth range My current workspace setup is a black MacBook that is plugged into a 21\" monitor, with a Wireless Apple Keyboard and Magic Trackpad, both connected with Bluetooth. The issue is, I cannot take the two input components more than 12 to 18 inches away without either adding a delay or losing the signal entirely. \nIs this normal? Is there anything I can do about it? \n\nA: No, this isn't normal.  Considering the age of the machine, I'd guess that it's a failing Bluetooth card.  It could also be some sort of interference.\n\nA: If it is really a case of poor Bluetooth range and not any interference. It might be that the Bluetooth antenna is loose / disconnecting from the Bluetooth card causing poor reception. Might not be a bad idea to double check the cable and make sure its connected and not corroded, etc. Before replacing the Bluetooth card.\nIf you are a DIY'er here is some more information on disassembling your MacBook see iFixit's guides for MacBooks. Other wise take it to a Apple Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider for help.\n\n\nA: Try the following:\n* Use with open screen\n* Use 5gHz network instead of 2.4gHz (or better use ethernet).\nThis should help. If not - try the Bluetooth Diagnostics Utility.app\n", "Q: How can I mark a podcast as \"Listened to\" on my iPhone? Is there a way to mark a podcast as \"Listened to\" on my iPhone/iPod? Occasionally I get podcasts that I've already heard, and I was hoping there was a quick way to mark them as played.\n\nA: Well, you could start playing it and quickly fast-forward to the end.

I wanted to watch it on my AppleTV (2) I get an error saying \n\nNetflix is currently unavailable and to try back later. \n\nI tried back later and got the same error. \nAny ideas as to why I get this \"Netflix is currently unavailable and to try back later\" message?\n\nA: I pressed Menu And Down for about 6 - 10 seconds and left go to get the AppleTV to reboot.  \nWorks perfectly now.\n\nA: This problem occurs intermittently. Sometimes your solution will work, other times you might need to power cycle the ATV2 (give about 30 secs for cycle). If you have other streaming problems you might need to forward port 123 on your router (you shouldn't have to forward those ports, but I have done it when problems were extreme, and it fixed my issue).\n\nA: I see you resolved your question, but for completeness, it can also happen when AppleTV is not properly setup to the country you are currently on. I'm currently in Latin America and  had to change the country on Configuration/iTunes Store to make it work (it was on USA, now says Argentina).\n\nA: I had to reset my AppleTV to factory settings to get Netflix to work again.\n", "Q: Restore mail account password from iOS I want to trick IOS to use my IMAP server so I can help my buddy retrieve his mail password (which he forgot, but is still stored on the iPhone).\nSo he has a Yahoo Mail account configured and working and I just want to edit the settings file so the Mail app will use the IMAP server that I just set up to intercept his password.\nI tried modifying the file /private/var/mobile/Library/Mail/metadata.plist and \"Envelop Index\", changing imap.apple.yahoo.com with my server, but these two files seem to act more like a cache, they got rewritten when he did check mail.\nAny ideas what file I should change or any other way to get the password? I know the password is kept encrypted in the keychain database, but it's too difficult to decrypt that.\n\nA: It'd be a lot easier to just sniff packets from his iPhone on your wifi and get the password. (With this?)\nChange the DNS servers on your wifi to point to your DNS server and tell the iPhone that mail.yahoo.com (or whatever) is your PC's IP address. Also, you might want to uncheck \"Use SSL\".\n", "Q: Early 2011 MBP has odd dots on external monitor I have this Mac:\n\nAnd it's attached to an Acer P191w. It will show an odd grid of dots on the external monitor like so:\n\nWhen I move the application the dots will get 'refreshed' and go away (they're not stuck pixels) but will quickly 'refill' themselves in 5-10 seconds. The app they're on there is Sublime Text 2, but it occurs on any app. I just put it up for contrast. I don't appear to get the dots on my laptop display, just the external.\nI have checked the wire connecting the two, it appears tight and secure.\nOccasionally this will prelude a full lockup of the machine forcing a hard reboot.\nI'd appreciate any insight into this matter.\n\nA: A discussion thread on forums.macrumors.com says this can be fixed by unplugging and replugging all of the video connections.\n\nA: If you can see it in a screenshot, it's likely something with the video signal being sent from the GPU. This could be a problem with the GPU itself or some kind of weird software issue. The best way to tell is to try booting to an external OS like your recovery partition or an OS on an external hard drive to see if it occurs there as well. If it does, it's probably an issue with the GPU. If not, try a reinstall. If you don't have these resources on hand, take a trip to your local Apple Store to have them test it out for you. \nA couple other quick fixes you could try that may or may not work are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restting the PRAM (see this guide)\n\n*Recalibrating the display. (see this guide)\n", "Q: Does the 'iPhone' label on a Contact's phone number enable any special handling? When entering a contact's phone number in the Contacts app on iOS or the Address Book on OS X, the number can be labeled iPhone rather than, say, mobile. Does doing so have any effect on how the number is treated by the OS or applications? Or is it provided for purely aesthetic purposes?\n\nA: It is entirely aesthetic.  I think the only difference is that it says iPhone instead of Mobile when a call comes in.\n\nA: The iPhone label does not provide any special handling instructions or added features of any kind.  It's a purely aesthetic touch that only impacts the display and voice dialing of a contact's number in the same way any other label does, such as \"Home\", \"Work\" or \"Mobile\".  \nIf you are looking for further information on how the iPhone does provide special handling for other iPhones, such as iMessage and FaceTime, there is a great thread, right here on Ask Different, that details just how the iPhone, in conjunction with Apple's servers, uses the UDID and Apple ID associated with the device to provide all those special iOS only features.\n\nA: You get unlimited texting iPhone-to-iPhone. Also note that when you text another iPhone the colors are different.\n", "Q: iTunes song selection goes to top after clearing search box I used to be able to type something into the iTunes search bar to filter the songs. You could click on a song, clear the search, and focus would stay on that song/album's position. I've since added a good amount of music to iTunes, and now when I clear the search box it moves to the top of the list every time.\nThis is really annoying. I'm pretty sure it has to do with surpassing a certain number of songs (I'm at 10,145) because it still works in smaller sized playlists (e.g. one with 3,000 songs).\nI even tried regenerating my iTunes library from scratch (removing the Music/iTunes folder, relaunching, and re-importing everything) and the same behavior occurs.\nDoes anyone know how to get this functionality back? Is there a setting somewhere I can set? Or is this just a bug with iTunes (or maybe Cocoa?)\n\nA: I had the same problem (with a similar number of songs -10742) after clearing the search box. What worked for me was clicking the curved arrow button on the right hand side of the little box, at the top of the iTunes screen, that shows the currently playing song, and its progress. This button returns the screen to the library location of the currently playing song. I'm currently running iTunes 10.5.3 on a 64-bit MacBook Pro. Hope this helps.\n\nA: I complained to Apple care today about this same problem and the iTunes expert that I talked to had never heard about it until I told him. After discussing, he and I both suspect that it's a bug that came across in an iTunes update last week. I don't think the size of the library is a factor, as mine has been at 80,000+ songs for the past 3 years and had never had this problem until this past weekend. If your problem occurred prior to this update, then it may help to pinpoint which update caused it.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Why does Aperture keep forgetting my preference to enable Photo Stream? I enabled Photo Stream as soon as the feature was available in Aperture 3.2.2, yet sometimes I have to remind the app that I want Photo Stream enabled.

I'm working on an Apple Script that handles URLs. There's a command one can give which re-creates the list that Safari shows to change the default web browser.\nAnyone know what this is?\n\nA: If you saved your AppleScript as application and declared that it can handle the http and https URL scheme in its Info.plist file, you simply need to update its modification date e.g. by running touch \"My Program.app\" in Terminal, or moving it to a different folder and back again in Finder.\nLaunch Services will then pick up the change automatically.

When i tried to unzip using the Mac default Archive zip utility and the error message: Error 1 - Operation not permitted. \nThen I tried using 7zx and got the error message: Cannot open the files as archive file\nHow can I retrieve image files from the damaged zip archive file?\nAre there any tools to retrieve at least some of my files from the damaged zip file?\n\nA: are you sure that the file is an actual Zip file as you will get this message on a file that has been renamed as .zip when it isnt in fact a Zip file.\nThe only real way to tell is to use a HEX editor such as 0xED to check the first few bytes are the characters PK.\n\nA: If the issue is actually a damaged zip file, the command line zip tool can try to repair it.  For that you'd use the -F or -FF options, like that:\nzip -F damaged-copy.zip --out repaired.zip\nzip -FF damaged-copy.zip --out repaired.zip\n\nIt's always a good practice to do that on a copy of the damaged file, so you're sure you don't damage it any further.  To see what the -F and -FF options do, look at the man page: man zip.\n\nA: A couple of possible solutions for you:\nFirst, try unarchiving the file with Stuffit Expander.  You probably already have it on your Mac and a simple spotlight search should reveal the location.  If you don't, you can download it for free from the Stuffit Website.\nIf that doesn't work for you, try extracting it via Terminal.  While it may seem a bit scary, some of the basic commands are quite simple, and incredibly useful.  First, open the Terminal app, located in the Utilities folder inside your Applications Folder.  Now, type the command unzip followed by a space, then drag the offending zip file over and drop it onto the terminal window, this will insert the path for the file.  Press Enter and the archive should unzip to your home folder.  \nIf neither of those options work for you, there are several programs out there that claim to be \"Zip Archive repair tools\".  A quick google search yields several results.  Your milage may vary, both in terms of cost and effectiveness though.

I've looked at the Restrictions feature and find that it limits access to apps by rating instead of disabling particular apps.\nThe reason being is that I'm prepping up for a trade show and will be handing over my personal iPad to a colleague (we're a tiny business) for use as an interactive display in the show. I'm OK if he use it to browse the web or even play some games, but I don't want him to go around looking at my e-mail, calendar, and financial records (hence, disabling PIM and some apps that owns critical data).\nThis event will last a couple of days and thus erasing my iPad just for this is a bit too much – I've had missing apps the last time I had to erase and restore due to an OS upgrade. Not to mention that we need some specific apps and data to be loaded on the device for use in the event (that is, a blank iPad won't be sufficient).\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Sorry, under stock iOS there is no way to restrict apps except thru the parental controls you already mentioned.\nOutside of the stock iOS however, there are multiple solutions to do this, my favourite of which is iUsers that enables multiple user accounts including guest accounts on iOS devices.\n", "Q: Mac keeps on asking for password to delete files I have renamed my Mac username from root login.

I suspect you created a new account and then copy and pasted the files from the previous directory, roots home directory, to your new user. If this is the case you will likely need to use Terminal (Applications/Utilities/Terminal) to restore the permissions on them as root is probably still the owner.

I've been trying out iBooks author, and one thing i want to be able to do is to allow text overflow from one custom text box to another. In pages this is done either by clicking the blue little symbol in the lower-right part of a text box with too much text, and link it to another, or by going to the menu format->text box->add linked text box. In iBooks Author, however, this last option is greyed out for no apparent reason, and the blue link symbol never appears. Any suggestions?\n\nA: Using the Botany sample, the text boxes seem to work as expected with the caveat that you have to intentionally click on one of the four corner handles of the text box to make the blue linking triangles appear.\nI took a small video showing the controls reacting to mouse events.\nFrom there, linking works as expected from the perspective of Pages.\n\n\nA: This is very difficult to find. When you create the text box after Enable: Editable on pages using this layout you should use the tag body, when a text box has the tag body will show the connection lines. \n\nA: I have found that it is necesary to give some special properties to the text boxes inside of layout column, for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the view menu on the top bar\n\n*Select Show layouts\n\n*Select a textbox\n\n*Open layout inspector\n\n*Enable: Editable on pages using this layout\n\n\nThen in format menu: Format > Text box > Show connection lines\nThe arrows and blue lines appear when toggling the menu item Show connection lines\nWhen use the same layout to create a page or section, the textbox must contain tne blue arrows and connection lines to.\nI found that this solution is not applicable to all the textboxes, it seems to deppend on the text style or something.\n\nA: To summarise:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have to be in layout mode. So select View menu on the top bar, and ensure that Show layouts is enabled.\n\n*use the Text Box icon on the top menu bar to create a text box\n\n*Select the text box and open the inspector, go to the Layout inspector and enable \"Editable on pages using this layout\" and ensure that the Tag is set to \"body\"\n\n*the link handles should now be visible.

(I'm talking of the last key on the keyboard, the one with the \"k\" symbol tilted towards left.)\nI'd like to be able to use it as the regular enter.\nDo you know any tip in order to fix this? At the moment it is totally random. My guess is that some software  I use remaps the enter into return, but I've not been able to point to which one.\n\nA: You've got your assumption a tiny bit mixed up. It's not that some software remaps the enter into return, it's that some software treats an enter as a carriage return and some doesn't.\nThey are two different keys with two differnet histories. One is enter and one is carriage return and they perform different functions.\nI hate referencing wikipedia but hell, here ya go ... Differences between Enter and Return.\nUsually most programs assume they are the same key - some don't. The AppleScript Editor for example uses ⌘+enter to force a script parse.\n\nA: Use Ukelele to create a new keyboard layout that maps the enter key to return.\nOpen Ukelele and select File » New From Current Input Source. Select Keyboard » Edit Key… and confirm to press the key. Then, press enter. You will be asked what character to replace it with.

I do not know from what program it came.\nHow can I get rid of it without restarting my computer?\nEDIT:\n\n\nA: There is a way to find out what application is responsible, if you have the developer tools installed.\nIn versions of Mac OS X before 10.6, the Quartz Debug tool had a Window List which lists every window and the application it belongs to. Unfortunately, this has been hidden in later versions, but it can be enabled (as I just found through this article: \n10.6: Quartz Debug 4.0 Secrets) — run the shell command\ndefaults write com.apple.QuartzDebug QDVisibleClientIdentifiers -array-add -string QDWindowInfoClient\n\nand then launch Quartz Debug. You will be able to browse all the windows and see images of each, push the “Reveal“ button to highlight it, or look at the heights to find windows that are of the right size.\nThis setting takes effect until you close the window. The linked article has suggestions for permanently enabling a way to bring up that window, but they don't seem to work on my Lion system and I haven't found any newer discussion. This rather suggests Apple thinks these tools shouldn't be readily accessible, so play with this at your own risk...\n\nA: You can often make it go away just by quitting the application. If that doesn't solve it, you may have to use \n⌥+⌘+esc to relaunch the Finder.\n\nA: The simplest way to get rid of this, at least when it happens for me, is to hover over anything with a tooltip to get a new tooltip. Happens to me quite often with Safari these days, very annoying.\n\nA: The way I solved it was to log out and in again. Not the ideal solution but I guess that when you don't know what program it belonged to, there aren't many options.\n\nA: The program was \"Eclipse\" according to the theme named \"Solarized Dark\" - so java issue then :P\nor iTerm uses the same theme.\n\nA: I tracked this down at long last. See here for a workaround: https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/4666\n", "Q: How can I switch dialog buttons using the keyboard? Whenever I'm trying to close a file that has been changed, I get the save file dialog\n\nI remember that the Don't Save button used to have focus, so I could press it using Spacebar, while pressing Enter would click on Save. But now on Lion, I'm unable to find a way to press the Don't Save using keyboard only, since Tab doesn't change focus to anything, and space doesn't work either.\nThis is the same for all file save dialogs in the system. Is there any way I can press the Don't Save button using keyboard only?\n\nA: On version 10.15.6, the previous answer didn't work as is.\nIf you want to switch with Tab or \"don't save\" directly with the Space key, you'll need to go to System Preferences → Keyboard and toggle this option:\n\n—-\nUpdate\nWith macOS Ventura, the exact place for this setting has been changed as follows:\n\n\nA: Go to... \n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences→Keyboard→Keyboard Shortcuts\n\n*and select All controls under Full Keyboard Access\n\n\n*\n\n*Now you can use ⇥ (tab) to switch between the dialog boxes.\n\n*Note: Unlike in Windows, you need to hit space to trigger a highlighted box that is not the default one! (If this is not natural to you, here's something that helps many to remember tab and space rather than just enter. The space bar is the keyboard version of a one button mouse with the tab moving the mouse's pointer for you.)\n\n\n\n\n", "Q: Can I set up password protection for an external hard drive? How do I set up password protection for an external hard drive?\n\nA: Password protecting a drive isn't really possible (or even useful) without also encrypting the contents of the drive. Honestly I'm not even certain that's something you can do since, what would the password be granting access to if the contents of the drive weren't encrypted?\nSo really the question you want to ask is: how do I encrypt an external hard drive?\nWith Lion you have FileVault to achieve this. FileVault makes it easy to encrypt your primary drive but you can also use it to encrypt the contents of remote storage. Just about any read/write storage media you attach via USB or FireWire can be FileVault'd and secured. The caveat? You can only use FileVault-protected drives on other Lion machines.\nMacWorld has a short slide show that walks you through mounting and formatting the disk with an encrypted file system. To summarize the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the drive\n\n*Open Disk Utility\n\n*Select the drive and click on the Erase tab\n\n*For the format pick either Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted) or Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled, Encrypted) from the list of available options. In most cases you'll want the former.\n\n*Press Erase to start the format\n\n*You'll be asked to confirm your choice and enter a password for the volume\n\n*Once the formatting is complete you'll need to enter the password to be able to mount and view the contents of the drive\n\n\nIf you're not running Lion or you want something that's portable across multiple OSes you can look at TrueCrypt. It's free software for encrypting file systems, much like FileVault, but it's available for Windows, OS X (both Snow Leopard and Lion) and Linux so you can access the encrypted remote media from just about any machine.\n\nA: If you're running Mac OS X 10.7 \"Lion\" you can create an encrypted (password protected) drive (partition) using Disk Utility. This drive will only be useable by Macs running Lion. Also, this is a formatting process. You can't encrypt a drive that has data on it. \nAnother option would be to use Disk Utility to create (an) encrypted Disk Image (or Sparse Image) file(s) on the external drive and store sensitive data within  the protected image(s). This solution would allow you to access the data from Macs running any relatively modern version of the OS. (Not sure exactly how far back you can go.) Encrypted Disk Images are (to my thinking) one of the hidden \"gems\" of the Mac OS and are underutilized in my experience. \nBeyond that there are third-party options like PGP, but I don't have (recent) experience with them so I can't comment from experience. \n\nA: If you want to use features built into the operating system, you could create an encrypted disk image on the external drive using Disk Utility. This would provide password protection.\nAnother option would be to use an external utility like TrueCrypt. I haven't used it myself, so I can't speak for its effectiveness or ease of use, but I have read good reviews. When Lion first came out there were some compatibility problems, but they seem to have been resolved as of September 2011.\n\nA: I'm using \"USB Secure\" to password protect all my external HDD, give it a try, it's a wonderful piece of software\n\nA: You can password protect files on the hard drive, but not the whole hard drive itself.\nBut you could put all your files in a folder in your hard drive and put a password on that folder which would have the same effect.\n", "Q: slapd not launching on Mac OS X 10.6 I have a slight problem with the openldap server installed with Mac OS X 10.6.8 (regular, not server). When I launch slapd in a terminal, it stops itself after 1 or 2 seconds... I just have the time to see its process... It doesn't seem to crash, because when I specify a log file in the configuration, the log is created, but empty.\nHowever, when I launch it with the debug option, for example -d 1,it doesn't fork and stays in the terminal (that's the documented behavior) and it runs normally. I can connect, and so on... Meaning, I presume, that's not a config problem.\nIs there something stupid I've forgotten?

What is the best epub reader app for iPad?\nI have very complex files on which most apps I have tried time out with sudden execution abortion and control returning to the SpringBoard.\nI don't believe this to be a duplicate question because most of them focus on particular aspects of quality or functionality like \"auto-scrolling and/or annotation support\".\nThis question is focussed on best viewing quality assuming support for complex and large files.\n\nA: I went through this when I first got my iPad. My killer app is color pdfs with nice figures. (biochemistry/bioinformatics) I tried GoodReader, iBooks, Stanza, and one other that I can't remember now. I also wanted: borderless full screen, tap to turn, quick page turns regardless of file size, and the ability to scrub between pages. I settled on Stanza, as it has those features and seems to integrate with Dropbox in a reasonable manner.\nMy litmus test for file size was a 300dpi scan of Envisioning Information by Tufte (came to nearly 450MB?) It was quite usable with fast page turns. It did crash once in awhile, but other readers would not even load it.\nStanza's epub performance apppears to be good. I have only really tested it with brutal PDFs, to be honest, but I use it nearly daily.\nMy workflow is this: read rss from PubMed/sites with filters. Read abstract. If I like it, put it in Dropbox/papers. Then, before leaving work/home, sync the files on Dropbox. Read on train/at leisure. I make notes in SimpleNote. I don't really like PDF annotations because they are generally non-standard and easier to lose/messup. \nHope it helps!\n", "Q: Partitioning secondary internal hard drive failure Looks like my 2nd HDD became a brick. I tried to partition it via Disk Utilities/booted from recovery partition/diskutil to no luck!\nI got vague/strange errors such as: unable to unmount, or:\nPartition failed with the error:\nWiping volume data to prevent future accidental probing failed.\n\nIs there any way to force the partition process, or somehow revive the hard drive??\n\n\nA: I've struggled for some days with the same problem but now it is solved. The problem was a faulty SATA cable. I've replaced it with a new one and now everything works as expected. \n\nA: Thank you all for your responses, but it seems that this is a Disk Utility/Lion bug with some 2nd/external drives.\nThe way it worked with me is to boot from a previous OS X version (Snow Leopard) via target-disk-mode and partition the drive from there without any problem!\n\nA: It could be a physical death. This you can do nothing about. If your drive is making clicking (or any other unusual) noises, this is a serious hint for that solution.\nOtherwise, try DiskWarrior. Commercial but worth it. It saved me many times from seemingly desperate situations. I owe it at least the life of my eMac, twice my main computer, and several friends'.\n\nA: I see you have Techtool Pro (eDrive partition on your main drive). I'm not sure why it's grayed though. Techtool Pro has basic utility to check logical and physical structure of HDD, use it.\nIn case it's easy for you to take this HDD out and you have open PC desktop then I would recommend connect it by SATA and check it with MHDD utility.\n\nA: The idea of forcing a drive (that I presumably want to trust) to format scares me. I wouldn't advocate pursuing this too far down the rabbit hole. However, I notice from the screenshot that there is no Partition Map Scheme defined for the drive. (Indicating this drive is either truly \"blank\" or really, really \"borked\".) Try clicking on the Options… button (located below the Volume Scheme: panel) and selecting the appropriate (most likely GUID) partition map.\n\nA: One thing I have done in the past to (temporarily) revive a dead drive, is to stand it vertically rather than sit it flat.  The read/write heads that extend in between the platters can often misalign, and gravity wants them to droop down.  This is often the cause for clicking and other bad noises.  If you stand the drives vertically (Try all 4  sides - you want to try to make the heada \"dangle\" down, rather than be stood on end etc), you may be able to get enough proper spin out of it to remove any data that me be required to be saved.\nObviously a backup is your friend in this scenario, although as you are wiping it,  you are probably (hopefully) not in a position to be losing data.\nOne thing you can try is to check the SMART status (Apple > About this Mac > System Information - dig about) to see if it is reporting errors.\n\nA: I ran into the same problem trying to set up a Hackintosh build on a new drive in my PC.  The solution I used was to switch the Mac drive with my existing SSD which has Windows 7 so that the Mac one is first.  This was a physical cable switch.\n", "Q: What's the accepted \"abbreviation\" for the original iPhone?

First Question: Should I replace the CD drive with an SSD or use an external (Thunderbolt) one? Is that hard, and is it easy to keep all the applications and system data on the SSD, while storing media on the HD? And should I buy an SSD now or wait for maybe a year until cheaper and better SSDs come out? Thanks!\n\nA: I can tell you that unless you have extensive experience working on iMacs and have all the right tools, it's a huge pain. Even for Apple technicians that have all the right tools and training, it's not the easiest machine to work on. \nI would recommend using an external solution if you can. However, using an external SSD to boot from isn't the most ideal solution since it's not going through the internal SATA connection. Configuring it this way will cause you to erase your internal iMac hard drive, which isn't the best idea. My recommendation would be to take your iMac to an Apple Authorized Service Provider and have them perform the SSD addition since they'll have the right tools and training, plus they'll be liable if they mess it up. As for the waiting to purchase the SSD, we are unable to make shopping recommendations on Ask Different.\nGood luck!\n\nA: In the Mid 2011 iMacs (both 21.5\" and 27\") Apple left enough room for an extra SSD. So if you want to put an SSD inside your iMac you can do that without replacing the DVD drive and/or original hdd. If you're going for an external one you should indeed opt for a SSD with a Thunderbolt connection, otherwise you kinda loose the speed advantage of a SSD.\nIf you want to separate the OS and application data from your media files, that's entirely possible and there's more than one way to achieve that.

Choose the clock icon from the lower toolbar during playback to see a slider.\nVLC can be downloaded from http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-ios.html (links to Apple's AppStore\n\nA: Speedeo just came out for both iPhone and iPad and allows you to increase / decrease videos in 0.25 increments. You can also resume watching videos quickly from the history screen. You can view videos from 0.25x to 2x speed, quite neat for watching presentations / tutorials.\nNote: I am one of the developers of this app\n\nA: PDF Expert, despite the name, has a great video player with variable speed (0.5x, 0.8x, 1.0x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 1.75x, 2.0x) and also 2-finger swiping gestures for seeking and brightness, and double-tap forward/back gestures like the YouTube app. Many ways to import and manage videos/files.\nI'm not affiliated; just love how much effort and polish they have put into this free app.\n\nA: AVPlayerHD supports 1.05 to 2x in 0.05 increments (and is available in the Swedish Itunes Store, which Swift Player and Azul aren't, and I assume other non-US users will have the same problem.)\nI am not affiliated with this app.\n\nA: As an author I could recommend a new Free iOS player with variable playback speed and many other adjustable playback options alphaSXplayer\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro mini displayport to DVI D doesn't show anything on the Compaq 2021 monitor I am using a MacBook Pro running 10.6.8. I have been using a Compaq s2021a monitor with mini displayport to VGA adaptor and cable until now. I bought a mini displayport to DVI adaptor and DVI - DVI cable and connected to the monitor. The laptop is detecting the display and allows me to change the resolution but nothing is seen on the display of the monitor. There is a flicker on the screen when the resolution is changed to 1024x768 when I click on the calibrate button. \nCan someone help me to resolve this?\n\nA: If you were using vga before, the monitor may not take digital input. DVI-D is digital only. VGA is analogue. \nTry using a DVI-A or similar analogue signal.\n", "Q: Restoring a Boot Camp image with Windows 7 and making it bootable? I have an image of Boot Camp with Windows 7, which was created by Carbon Copy Cleaner. I didn't realize that the image wasn't bootable until I had already deleted the partition.\nI'd like to restore the partition with the image, and make it bootable, so that I can return back to where I was before deleting the partition. Is this at all possible to do?\n\nA: Why don't you make a new Bootcamp partition, download CCC for windows and let it do its job?\n", "Q: How do I set my mac to ask what disc I want to boot from without having to hold alt? I can switch between OSX, Windows and a network drive, but I cannot seem to find this option anywhere.\n\nA: rEFIt\n\nrEFIt is a boot menu and maintenance toolkit for EFI-based machines like the Intel Macs. You can use it to boot multiple operating systems easily, including triple-boot setups with Boot Camp.

If you have a good backup, it is less dangerous, but until you have restored from that backup there still can be snags and problems in a restore that you want find until that point. The good news is you don't need the backup, it's just there I case a crash happens in the middle of this process.\n\n\n*\n\n*First make sure you've got a good backup of your iTunes library.  \n\n*Then delete all your apps from iTunes.\n\n*Finally, sync each of your iDevices and when it tells you it found apps on the iDevice(s) that were not in the library, make sure you tell it to restore them back to the library.\n\n\nYou should end up with only those apps that are installed on at least one iDevice!  (In theory, at least.) And if anything fails, restore the library from its backup.\n\nA: This worked for me without any issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect you iDevice to computer, let the sync complete (or cancel as per your choice)\n\n*In the iTunes app library, select all (CmdA) and delete. on the prompt select Move to Recycle Bin.\n\n*Do not sync now, go to Files>>Devices>>Transfer Purchase from \"Your iDevice\"\n\n", "Q: iTunes Purchase Without Download Is there a way to purchase an app from the App Store using iTunes without having to download it?  I'm thinking like a hidden preference/mouse/modifier key during click, etc.\nI know the download can be canceled, but what I'm asking is if there is a way to prevent the download all together...\n\n\nA: No. You need to manually cancel the download upon purchase.\n\nA: You could always simply Gift This App to someone (e.g., yourself). This works especially well when you're not on WiFi and want to buy an app that's over 20MB or when you want to buy an app during a sale.\n", "Q: Is it possible to disable the audio of a specific application using Jailbreak? I have a game on my iPhone that always interrupts my music even if I turn the volume down to zero (every 30 seconds or so). Is there some kind of a workaround that lets me continue playing music? Thanks!\n\nA: If you're JailBroken, install and open up iFile from Cydia. Navigate to /var/mobile/Applications/, tap the gear in the bottom-left corner and make sure \"Application Names\" is set to On, and then find the app you mentioned inside that folder. To completely disable audio from that app, you're going to need to delete every audio file inside that folder (and subfolders). It might take you a while, but that's the only way to do what you want without writing your own JailBreak tweak. If the app you're muting is written poorly, it may  crash when it cannot find those files you deleted. If this is the case, just reinstall the app, and you won't be able to mute it until somebody nice comes along and writes a tweak.\n", "Q: How can I use Mighty Mouse Swipe Gestures for Back/Forth in Mac App Store? I have the latest mighty mouse bluetooth wireless thing. (Hate it.)\nIn Mac App Store, I'd wish to be able to swipe left and right to be able to go back and forth, such as in Safari, Chrome, etc.\nHow can I achieve this? Preferably by native/OS means, without resorting to 3rd party solutions (BetterTouchTool, etc).\n\nA: Unfortunately, the native Magic Mouse preferences pane is a little sparse.  As far as I can tell, unless you are willing to move to a 3rd party solution, the Magic Mouse does not support the behavior you are looking for.  In order to enable this functionality on an Apple trackpad, one must change the preference from 2 finger swipe to 3 finger swipe (\"2 or 3\" finger works as well).  It should be noted though, that even when enabled, in apps without the fancy page sliding across the screen animation, the swiping does not follow the \"Natural Scrolling\" paradigm, as in you must swipe left to go back and right to go forwarded.  \nWhile not the answer you were hoping for, it sounds like your best bet would be to either investigate a 3rd party option like MagicPrefs or even better, invest in a Magic Trackpad.  The gesture options, even natively are greatly expanded.  It will open up a whole new world of gesture based computing for you. \n", "Q: WPA2 Enterprise TTLS PAP connection for iPad I can't connect to my university's enterprise wireless using my iPad. It uses WPA2 Enterprise with TTLS and PAP. When I enter my username and password it asks me to accept a certificate which is not verified, when I click accept it tells me that the username or password is incorrect (though they are correct). What should I do to fix this?\n\nA: Okay so I figured it out myself. Apple provides a configuration utility for configuring WiFi and some other settings.\nFor Windows - http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1466\nFor Mac - http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1465\nI created a configuration profile using it and entered the WiFi settings there - \nSecurity Type - WPA/WPA2 Enterprise\nProtocols\nEAP Types - TTLS\nInner Identity - PAP\nAuthentication\nUsername - yourusername\nPassword - yourpassword\nI then emailed this configuration profile to myself and opened it from my iPad and it worked.\n\nA: @Vlad is correct. Alternatively, it may require you to use this format for the username: \ndomain\\username\n", "Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut to clear the search box in Lion's Mail? I am running 10.7.2 and would like to be able to clear the search box in Mail with a shortcut. How do I do this?\n\nA: If the focus is on the search box press \"esc\" key.\nIf not, the fastest way I've found is by first pressing Option+Command+F to set the focus on the search box and then press esc to clear it.\nThis is a link to apple standard shorcuts: Mac OS X Shorcuts\n\nA: I love Keyboard Maestro for this kind of stuff (and in general). I've bound cmd-shift-delete to a macro that clears the search box. Here's the macro. I'd add a screenshot but don't have the required reputation yet.\n", "Q: Can I add a custom ringtone to my iPhone without syncing to iTunes? We (bafflingly) have two great guides to adding custom ringtones to an iPhone via iTunes. Is there a way to do it without syncing with iTunes?\n\nA: Unlikely.\nSuch functionality is indirectly excluded by the iOS Developer Program Licence Agreement under section 3.3.4.\nThere it is stated that applications may only write data to an application's designated container area on the device. Therefore, the library data for ringtones cannot cannot be manipulted unless there were API to do this.\nI am not sure if I'm allowed to post a direct link here, therefore use this google search to get to the document.\n\nA: Actually, you can bypass iTunes with Garageband app, but as for me, it's not quite straight forward.\nThere's another iTunes-free option though. I've been using an app – WALTR, it\n puts media on iOS devices, ringtones included. \nSo just fire up WALTR, connect your iPhone with USB, throw your M4r file into the drop-zone and it's there. \n\nThen just head to Settings>Sounds> Rinftones and select the desired ringtone right there. \nSo, as you can see, there's no iTunes involved. If you wanna get more details, watch the screencast, I personally found this tutorial very helpful: https://softorino.com/waltr/windows-guides/copy-m4r-ringtones-iphone-without-itunes\nHope, it helps!\nCheers!\n\nA: But with iTunes to add iPhone ringtones is free. You don't have to buy ringtones from iTunes, you just have to sync the ringtones you have (bought from other sources, or made yourself) through iTunes.\nWhat I had to do was in iTunes, use \"Add File to Library\" (under the file menu) to add the ringtone for free , this will place it in its own Tones library (if you didn't already have one).\nThen you can connect the iPhone, and there will be a specific sync tab for Tones where you can select what you added to the library and then sync it to your phone.\n", "Q: How can I generate dynamic keynote presentations? I'd like to build a series of Keynote presentations that contain some dynamic elements. By that I mean some elements are \"compiled\" in later. For example if I have a code sample on a slide, I want to be able to pull the latest code sample in from an external file when it is time to create the presentation. So 75% of the presentation is static, but then 25% needs to be included at the last minute. There should be some sort of place holder that is preformatted, and then the specific text is added in with the correct formatting.\nAlso these dynamic bits may be included from one of a few different sources. For example if the presentation is on Java it would include Java examples, but the next time it could include Objective-C examples. \nIn the past I end up effectively forking my Keynote presentation by creating a new copy, adding the dynamic bits manually, and then updating it. But then when the next presentation comes up I end up repeating the process, and since the forked copy is updated from the original, then I need to fork it from there, which means cutting out all the dynamic bits and replacing them. So I would like a better solution.\nSeems like this is something that should be able to be accomplished through AppleScript or Automator, but I honestly know little about these two tools. \nThanks in advance!\n\nA: You could create your keynote presentation as a series of separate files (either slides, or sections, eg. slides 1-20, slides 21-25, slides 26-40) and then merging them using Automator. This way you could simply replace slides 21-25 with alternative versions prior to merging?\n", "Q: Why does a Double Hard Reset help with iPhone issues? My wife has an iPhone 3G, me an iPhone 4.\nEver since she upgraded to iOS 4, her phone has been much slower than it was on iOS 3.\nMy iPhone 4, upon upgrading to iOS 5, isn’t slower. However it has greatly reduced battery life and gets physically warm for seemingly no reason.\nWhat do these two things have in common (besides being upgraded to a firmware designed for the next generation of hardware)?\nBoth phones can be temporarily healed of their maladies by being Double Hard Reset.\nAccording to Cult of Mac:\n\nTo perform a Hard Reset, press and hold the Home and Sleep/Wake\n  buttons on your iPhone simultaneously for 5 to 10 seconds.  After a\n  few seconds the Slide to Power Off notice will appear, ignore this and\n  keep holding down both buttons. In another few seconds the device\n  should abruptly turn off.\n\nThey go on to say that the device will reboot itself after you've done this, but both of my devices stay off.\nTo complete the “Double Hard Reset,” you need to power on the phone after you’ve done this, then do it again before the phone gets to your lock screen.\nI have personally experienced this numerous times.\nWhy does this help?  What does doing a Double Hard Reset do to the phones?\n\nA: It sounds like you’re no doing the reset correctly. You’re supposed to keep holding the Home and Sleep buttons until the Apple logo appears.\nThe reason your iPhone isn’t coming back up is you’re stopping before the reset is completed.\n", "Q: How can I replicate Account Preferences across multiple accounts? I'm working on creating a NetRestore Golden Image that will be used on about a dozen computers across our organization.\nI need EVERY account to boot up with the same baseline preferences (screensaver, desktop, dock applications, etc).\nWhat is the easiest way to replicate account preferences across each account?\n\nA: As Robin says, most people would go for OS X Server, because it has tools specifically built to do just this, providing you bind the clients to LDAP.\nAside from that, OS X is designed hierarchically. You could try just adding the desired .plist files in /Library/Preferences instead of ~/Library/Preferences and then deleting said files, if they already exist, from ~/Library/Preferences (since files in ~/Library generally override those in /Library )\nThere is also the default \"User Template\" hiding in the System Folder, from which all new users' home folders are created. You could edit this, but the change would only affect accounts created after the imaged machines have their first boot.\n\nA: OS X Server, Open Directory, Workgroup Manager and managed preferences. That is the easiest way because they're made for what you want to do. How to set that up? Beyond the scope of an answer here!\nYou could probably get by re-imaging machines each night as well? Seems like a lot of work for no reason, and no flexibility!\nInterested to hear what you decide, let me know if you need more info!\n\nA: Very basically, you could set up a new machine with a new user account, configure it exactly as you wish, and then do a complete Time Machine backup.\nWhen you get a new machine, when the Migration Assistant comes on, you can simply restore the new machine from the Time Machine backup. This will result in all your machines being identical out of the gate.\n\nA: On Lion you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Managed preferences and Workgroup Manager (often referred to as MCX profiles)\n\n*Profile Manager (or other device management software like Casper suite)\n\n\nBasically, you pick apart each item that needs to be standardized and set the default user template to create each account as desired or have a process to standardize each account after it is created. Lion server is a very inexpensive way to get started and there are many books and web sites to guide you if you go down that path...\n", "Q: Safari / iCal scroll animation When I started using Lion, there was this \"smooth scroll animation\" in iCal and Safari, so when I swiped my finders left/right the next month/week or previous website showed up with a nice slide effect. Now Lion just shows that previous page instead of sliding it in. How can I turn on that feature again?\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Trackpad > More Gestures. Make sure that the first one is ticked and begins with \"Scroll\", rather than \"Swipe\". This should do it.\n", "Q: How do I enable SSH server on startup through Terminal? Curious as to how I can enable the sshd to start on startup solely using terminal. The GUI is great and everything but it doesn't go well with my bash scripts.\n\nA: The short answer on how to enable sshd from the terminal is doing this:\nsudo systemsetup -setremotelogin on\n\nThe long answer on how to execute daemons or scripts on startup is a bit longer. There are two ways (that I know of) to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first one is through Startup Items, which are executed at the final phase of bootup, these are deprecated and shouldn't be used unless you need compatibility with Mac OS X 10.3 or earlier. You can take a look at how to do it this way in here.\n\n*The second one is launchd, a replacement for init and rc (among others). This is the recommended way and it's a bit trickier than just putting a script on a folder like in Linux. There are several ways to launch daemons, the preferred way it to launch them on demand (so they will be ready to launch but you won't see them in a ps for example, unless you are using them). The explanation is a bit lengthly and the list of options is long, you can take a look at the documentation here. You can take a look in /Library/LaunchAgents for examples, if you have Chrome installed, there is a file in there for the Google Software Updater called com.google.keystone.agent.plist, that runs at load time, you can start there.\n\nA: I was going to make this a comment, but it would be too lengthy.\nIt goes a bit into more detail about my particular issue and a different way to enable the SSH server from the terminal, as well as to make sure it persists across reboots.\nI came across this question because my Remote Login (sshd) was getting disabled after each reboot.  None of the answers satisfied my question (ie. I did not have FileVault enabled, etc., etc.).\nJust check /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist and make sure <key>Disabled</key> is not set to <true/>.  Additionally, to make sure it starts on boot every time, I made the partial entry look like this:\n....\n<dict>\n    <key>Disabled</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.openssh.sshd</string>\n....\n\nThen just run the following to make sure the new settings stick:\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist\nsudo reboot\n\n\nA: TL;DR: Having FileVault enabled will cause Remote Login daemons like SSH and Screen Sharing/Apple Remote Desktop to remain disabled until the disk is unlocked by a user logging in at least once.\nThis means, upon cold boot or restart you'll be effectively locked out of a remote Mac.\nThe workarounds I know of are:\n\n*\n\n*Disable FileVault (careful)\n\n*When managing a Mac remotely, be sure to always reboot via the following Terminal command, which will boot in a special mode (Authenticated Restart) whereby the disk is pre-decrypted:\n\nsudo fdesetup authrestart\n\n", "Q: With FileVault enabled, do I need to overwrite my hard drive with 0's before getting rid of it? When I give up my laptop I like to securely delete the hard drive. I would assume that since it's full disk encrypted using file vault that I should be able to just delete the real key for boot partition and be done. No need to write 0s over the filesystem.\nIs this true, or do I need to do something extra to make sure that I can safely part with my hard drive?\n\nA: No - the point of FileVault 2 is to make it extremely difficult for a motivated person to decipher what was stored on that volume.\nI would pay more attention to destroying that key that was used encrypt the data than the drive.\nOf course, you could zero the drive, but why not go one better and pick a new encryption key that was never used, and never will be used and let your machine re-do the encryption of the drive once you have erased all the data one pass.\nSince there have been no scholarly articles on how easy it is to decrypt a FileVault drive nor reports of exploits - you have to weigh the potential damage that leak of information could be. FileVault makes it much easier to not worry if you lose a drive, so the old saw to be sure to overwrite things many times is far less applicable for drives where encryption exists at rest.\n\nA: How safe do you want to be? How hard to guess is your File Vault 2 password?\nThe safest way to ensure your data cannot be recovered is to destroy the drive. Zeroing out an encrypted drive multiple times provides a level of protection less than destroying the drive but more than simply relying on the encryption. For most ordinary data, File Vault 2 whole-disk encryption should be a reasonable level of protection.\nIf your drive contains national secrets that will result in people dying should they fall into the wrong hands, or the secret recipe for a billion-dollar trade secret, do more. If someone is trying to steal a social security number or credit card number that might be saved on your drive, there are far easier ways than trying to brute force their way into your encrypted drive.\n", "Q: How to Install .NET Framework 4 on Windows 7 Bootcamp I am trying to install the Microsoft .Net Framework 4 on a Windows 7 bootcamp partition on my MacBook Pro. It always fails. I have tried installing it via the web platform installer and also the standalone download, but neither works.\nThis is the error message from the standalone .Net Framework Installer log:\nExe (C:\\c6966332def2afc3e143c2e5079951\\Windows6.1-KB958488-v6001-x64.msu) failed with 0xc8000222 - (null).\nFinal Result: Installation failed with error code: (0xC8000222) (Elapsed time: 0 00:01:02).\n\nDoes anyone know how to get this to work?\n\nA: Well, I figured it out. I left out in my question that I was using VMware to access my bootcamp partition, where it didn't work. When I rebooted into \"pure\" bootcamped windows 7 the install went perfectly.\n", "Q: How does iMessage work? I'm interested in a good general overview.\nHow does iMessage actually work?\n\nA: In a nutshell, iOS sets up a persistent connection to the Apple Push Notification (APN) servers if you elect to use iMessage, iCloud, Notifications or other push services. From there, the phone checks in with the servers anytime it has a network connection and listens for messages that the servers wish to push to your device. Furthermore, iOS then registers which applications on your phone should get specific messages. All the messages pass through the notification center system in case you have elected for them to be posted to specific places such as the lock screen, the notification tray or just passed off to the end application for each message as appropriate.\nThat's it.\n\n\n*\n\n*There's a server. (likely many behind a load balancer)\n\n*There's a connection that your device opens to the server.\n\n*Things can then arrive through the connection.\n\n\nA: From a user perspective, this article should answer any questions you may have about iMessage:\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/162984/2011/10/ios_5_imessage.html\nThis is a more technical explanation of how Apple's Push Notification system works:\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/ApplePushService/ApplePushService.html\n", "Q: iOS restore causes downloading issues I restored my iPad today.

You can stream your iTunes content to iPhone using Home Sharing (see this ArsTechnica guide) or AirPlay (using AirView on the iPhone).\n\nA: Your wording was a bit ambiguous, but I believe you are trying to use iTunes to play music which is on your iPhone. If that's correct:\nAssuming you have the latest versions of iOS and iTunes installed, plug in your iPhone (this is a one-time setup by the way), wait for iTunes to do all the normal mounting and stuff, and then rather than eject it, simply unplug it. As long as the iPhone is connected to the same network as the computer, just browse the iPhone's library from iTunes and play away!\nIf the iPhone is not yours, be sure to un-tick any automatic syncing options in iTunes before anything else.\n", "Q: My Finder file detail headers looks weird My Finder's file details header looks weird.\n\nIt looks translucent and not clickable :(\nI used many command-line tools on this Temp folder, so I could be happen from accidental deletion of some system file.

Is this possible to stream the audio played on an iPad to a Stereo wirelessly ?\nMy stereo is connected to my iMac via BlueTooth. So If I can play the audio from my iPad on my iMac this will do what I want. But maybe there is another way to do it...\nAnother question is : Can I transmit the sound to my mac using the simple connector cable ?\nWhat I really want to do is to use for instance GarageBand and hear the sound on my stereo. Wirelessly would be the best, but, as a second choice, I can handle the fact to be forced to be connected with USB.\nAnd please, I know the ultime and last choice to use the mini-jack output on the iPad...\n\nA: You can connect the iPad directly to your stereo using bluetooth. Or you can use AirPlay to stream audo to your iMac.

Its purpose is to connect the iPhone line out (part of the dock connector) to devices like amplified speakers, stereo amplifiers, etc. These devices provide their own volume control and (aside from fine-tuning of input levels) the assumption is that you don't want to have control over the sound level in two places.  \n", "Q: iMac - Airport 'Looking for networks' affects FireWire audio device This problem has been driving me mad for months and started when I upgraded to OS X Lion from Snow Leopard on my iMac.\nI've got a Saffire 56 external audio device connected via FireWire (works perfectly / all newest drivers etc). I get crackling, jittery audio whenever Airport decides to scan for networks, or connects to my home network. If I turn it off everything works perfectly. \nWhy the AirPort and a FireWire audio device are remotely connected I have no idea?\nDoes anyone have a solution for disabling AirPort scanning for networks, or better still, stop the problem completely? \n\nA: Other than disabling the WiFi card entirely, there isn't a documented way to prevent periodic scans with the Mac OS running.\nIt's possible that just normal interference like when a mobile phone disturbs a radio is affecting the audio signals.  You don't say what Mac hardware you are using, but you could try something as simple as moving the audio hardware further away, or to the other side of your iMac/Macbook etc, maybe even run it through a hub or use a long cable to take it out of reach of the antenna, see if it makes a difference.  Failing that try changing the WiFi channels on your router to see if it helps.\nThe other issue to consider is perhaps the AirPort card is failing or improperly grounded / connected inside the mac. I have seen the antenna cables pop off when a Mac takes a tumble - so if it's not too much inconvenience or cost, having a technician run a quick test on the airport card and verify all the internal cables / grounding is correct might solve the issue as well.\nIt's entirely possible with Lion that the airport drivers do different things with AirDrop that Windows drivers don't do and that could conceivably be the cause. It's a long shot, but I've seen this sort of thing before.\n\nA: FireWire can be used as an Ethernet interface. I would make sure that you do not have this enabled. Go to the System Preferences -> Networks and delete any FireWire interfaces from the panel on the left. \n", "Q: How to change photoshop JPEG output header format? We are using Adobe Photoshop on a Mac to output JPEG image files. These image files need to be rendered on an embedded output device that we have no control over.  It seems that the files output by Photoshop use the Exif header format, whereas the embedded device only understands the JFIF header format.\nAccording to Wikipedia:\nStrictly speaking, the JFIF and Exif standards are incompatible because they each\n  specify that their marker segment (APP0 or APP1, respectively) appears first. In\n  practice, most JPEG files contain a JFIF marker segment that precedes the Exif \n  header. This allows older readers to correctly handle the older format JFIF segment, \n  while newer readers also decode the following Exif segment, being less strict about\n  requiring it to appear first.\nAs an example, here is the Mac-rendered JPEG:\n\nwhereas the PC-rendered JPEG (which works on the embedded device) has:\n\nYou can also see the Exif header coming after the JFIF one in the PC image above.\nIs there a setting in Photoshop that allows us to export JPEGs with the JFIF preamble in the header? \n\nEDIT: After using JPEG Snoop, the header information it decoded is as below.\nThe PC-generated image has an APP0 (JFIF) header:\n*** Marker: APP0 (xFFE0) ***    \nOFFSET: 0x00000002\nlength     = 16\nidentifier = [JFIF]\nversion    = [1.1]\ndensity    = 96 x 96 DPI (dots per inch)\nthumbnail  = 0 x 0\n\nThe Mac-generated image has an APP1 (Exif) header:\n*** Marker: APP1 (xFFE1) ***\nOFFSET: 0x00000002\nlength          = 24\nIdentifier      = [Exif]\nIdentifier TIFF = 0x[49492A00 08000000]\nEndian          = Intel (little)\nTAG Mark x002A  = 0x002A\nEXIF IFD0 @ Absolute 0x00000014\nDir Length = 0x0000\nOffset to Next IFD = 0x00000000\n\nThen, after running the suggested XnView, the Mac header looks like:\n*** Marker: APP0 (xFFE0) ***\nOFFSET: 0x00000002\nlength     = 16\nidentifier = [JFIF]\nversion    = [1.1]\ndensity    = 72 x 72 DPI (dots per inch)\nthumbnail  = 0 x 0\n\nAnd the embedded device can now read this Mac-generated JPEG.\n\nA: What version of Photoshop are you using? Apparently Adobe dropped support for exporting with JFIF at some point, and replaced it with EXIF.\nYou can try an app like XnView to strip out meta data:\nhttp://newsgroup.xnview.com/viewtopic.php?f=60&t=24056\nI just tried this with an EXIF jpeg on my computer, opened it in XnView, and then selected:\nTools > Export > [√] remove all metadata > Save…\n\nThe resulting file remained a jpeg, but had a JFIF header.\n", "Q: Does Mail.app send or can request read receipts?

Where can I found information about the power consumption of an iPhone 4 display? Which technology is used? Does it save battery lifetime when the screen displays black or dark pixels?\nAdditionally, there is a brightness control in the settings. Does this setting really affect battery lifetime?\nI'm asking about the hardware to learn the details so I can develop iOS applications and be sensitive to power consumption based on the settings I apply in our applications.\n\nA: Yes - brightness is the major thing you can change to save power if the screen is prevented from dimming. Having the screen off entirely significantly extends the runtime of the battery across the iOS platform.\n\nI haven't found a good reference to determine if the natural state of the IPS transistors that control whether the pixel is open (colored) or closed (blocking or black) but the amount of power needed to activate all of the transistors and let all the backlight through is certainly dwarfed by the amount of power needed to run the backlight itself.\nSince the backlight is dimmable, it could be more of a factor when the backlight is set at the lowest light level, but I would expect the actual panel itself to still be negligible compared to the backlight (and more importantly negligible compared to the CPU / GPU and radio power usage)\n\nIf you take a look at the official specs you can see for the iPhone 4S:\n\n\n*\n\n*6 hours: 3G Internet - screen on all the time\n\n*8 hours: 3G Calling - screen off most of the time\n\n*9 hours: WiFi Internet - screen on all the time\n\n*10 hours: Video Playback - screen on all the time\n\n*40 hours: Audio Playback - screen off most of the time\n\n\nIt would be interesting to see how long the audio playback test would last if you had a simple app to keep the screen on the entire time...\n\nA: Setting a black background will probably not make a big difference on battery life on an iPhone (see some tests with large monitors: http://techlogg.com/2010/05/black-vs-white-screen-power-consumption-24-more-monitors-tested/17).\nReducing the brightness probably will be much more important. That is because the LCD screen is led-backlit all the time and leds are eating up most of the energy.\n\nA: LCDs (which the iPhones use) use virtually the same amount of power no matter what color is being displayed.\nSo, no, a black screen will make no practical difference whatsoever. (Although, as someone else mentioned, brightness of the screen definitely will. However, note that brightness is NOT the same as color being displayed).\nAMOLED screens DO use less power when displaying black, because when they display black they actually turn that pixel off, and so it uses almost no power. LCD does not behave like this. All LCD does is block the light the pixel emits. Some would even say that it wastes energy in this way.\n", "Q: How do I get non default calendars to show up on iOS (iPhone/iPad)? I was able to connect my iPhone to multiple Google accounts and have the default calendars show up on my iPhone and iPad correctly.

I have some albums in my iPhoto 11, that contain personal photos. I want to password protect  particular albums or the iPhoto application itself.\nIs there any way to password protect iPhoto 11?\n\nA: I solved this by creating a separate iPhoto Library and storing that Library within a password-protected encrypted sparse image. (You create sparse images using Disk Utility.) I've appended a step-by-step tutorial to the end of this answer.\nI then created an alias to the private library and stored that alias in my Pictures folder alongside my regular libraries.\nTo open the private Library, double click on the alias icon. You will be prompted for a password so that the encrypted image can mount on the desktop.  When you're done, be sure to \"eject\" the disk image.\niPhoto defaults to opening the last Library opened, so if you want the program to open the \"regular\" file next time, go ahead and open that Library. (You can either double click its Library icon or open iPhoto while holding down the Option key.) I've just developed the habit of opening iPhoto using the appropriate Library icon from my Pictures folder.\nThe disadvantage of this method is that you can't mix \"private\" images into your iPhone sync and it's possible that leaving iPhoto with the wrong \"default\" library could interfere with an iOS sync. (I use Aperture for my main photo collection/iOS sync anyway, so I haven't fully explored this.)\nCreating an encrypted, Password-Protected iPhoto Library — Step-by-Step\nThe reality is that many of us have pictures we want to keep but don't necessarily want to share with partners, children or grandparents. What happens at Burning Man stays at Burning Man. Right? To keep those pictures from prying eyes — and inadvertently displaying them on your big screen TV via Apple TV — I advocate using a separate iPhoto library for your private pictures and protecting that library by storing it inside an encrypted container.\nI'm keying this tutorial to Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and iPhoto '11 (current at time of writing), but this system will work for previous versions of the software. (To a point — the encrypted disk image was added to the OS in 10.3.) You can use this method to safeguard Aperture libraries as well.\nOpen your existing iPhoto Library and select the images you want to put into the encrypted library. One way of doing this is to assign a unique keyword to those pictures. I used fmeo (short for for my eyes only). Next, create a smart album that includes the images you tagged.\nExport or copy the tagged images into a folder on your desktop. Leave the images in your original iPhoto Library until you're sure you've successfully completed this entire process — but don't forget to go back and delete the images once you're satisfied with the results.\nNext, you need to create a new iPhoto library for your private images. Quit iPhoto if it's open. Open iPhoto while holding the Option key down. Create a new library from the dialog box displayed. I named mine FMEO. I strongly suggest you not give it a name like Pictures I Don't Want My Spouse To See because the filename will be visible in the Finder if you follow my complete plan.\nImport the images you want to protect into iPhoto (making sure you're using the FMEO library) and organize them as you see fit. When you're happy with the results, quit iPhoto. You can safely delete the Finder folder containing these images. Use Secure Empty Trash if you're concerned that someone will try to recover the deleted files.\nSo far, all you've done is created a separate library for your private photos. It isn't protected in any way. In fact, assuming the FMEO library was the last library used, iPhoto will display your private images the next time it's opened. The secret to keeping those images from prying eyes is to store the library inside an encrypted container. Fortunately, Apple provides everything you need to create this container free of charge in OS X (10.3+).\nOpen Disk Utility. (It's in your Utilities folder.) Create an encrypted sparse image:\n\n*\n\n*Choose New > Blank Disk Image from the menu\n\n\n*Enter a name. Again, be discreet as this name will definitely be visible from the Finder.\n\n\n*Choose a size for your container. It must be big enough to contain the current library and, assuming you want the ability to add images in the future, should allow ample room for future growth. You can afford to be a little generous with this because you're going to use a sparse disk image format, meaning the container will initially only take up as much disk space as its contents plus a little overhead and will grow (but never shrink) as necessary up to its maximum formatted size. Don't worry too much about creating an image that you might outgrow someday as you can always create a new sparse image file and transfer the library into a bigger home if your library becomes too large.\n\n\n*For Format, just use the default Mac OS X Extended (Journaled) unless you have a compelling reason not to. Same for Partition settings, just leave them be unless you know better. Encryption:  I'd suggest 128-bit (more than adequate for most purposes) but you're free to use a higher level if you think it's necessary. Click Create button.\n\n\n*Enter a good password when prompted. Do not store the password in the Keychain because that would allow anyone browsing your computer to open your secret stash — rendering this entire exercise moot. Store your password securely through other means.\nA brief interlude about organization. I've created a folder inside my ~/Pictures folder called iPhoto Libraries. Inside that folder, I've placed my non-sensitive iPhoto libraries and the encrypted image files containing my eyes only libraries. I have a shortcut to the iPhoto Libraries folder on my dock. This allows me to quickly open iPhoto by clicking on the library I want to use.\nOnce your encrypted sparse disk image is created and mounted on the desktop, copy your private iPhoto library into it. Leave the original copy of the library in place until you've tested the encrypted version to your satisfaction — you might want to rename the original at this point to avoid confusion.\nCreate an alias of the library file contained within the encrypted sparse image. Place that alias in a convenient place, I put it in ~/Pictures/iPhoto Libraries alongside my non-secure libraries.\nUnmount (eject) the sparse disk image. Then open the private image library by double-clicking on the alias to the file. You should be prompted for the password to the encrypted sparse disk image. Once you've entered that password (again, do not save it in the Keychain), iPhoto should open and display your private photos. Once you're done working with those photos, close iPhoto and unmount (eject) the sparse disk image. It is critical that you unmount the encrypted image, otherwise anyone can come along and open your private library.\nOnce the sparse image is unmounted, if you try to open iPhoto you will again be prompted for the password. You can prevent this by opening your default iPhoto library after you've closed the private library. I do this by clicking on the appropriate library file from the shortcut in my dock.\nNow that you've successfully created and tested your Eyes Only library, be sure to delete the version of that library that isn't inside the sparse image (again, using Secure Empty Trash if it makes you more comfortable) and open your original iPhoto Library and delete the private images still contained within.\nThat's how I do it. It's not as complicated as it seems. In fact, it took me more time to write this up than it did for me to create-do-test the first time (excluding selecting the pictures).\n\nA: For light weight hiding, the only official iPhoto solution is to individually select and hide or flag and then hide all flagged photos.\nThis hiding is documented online as well as in the built in help.\n", "Q: Profile Manager on Lion and the Workgroup group The first few times I set up Lion server, we didn't plan on using the default group named Workgroup - but I now see that Profile Manager will create a workgroup with the name \"Workgroup\" and short name \"workgroup\".\n\n\n*\n\n*What function does this group server on Lion Server? \n\n*Should I be adding everyone and everything to this group or should I leave it alone for Profile Manager to manage? \n\n\nI'm tempted to just keep deleting it, but my gut tells me it's there to serve some purpose that I haven't seen documented anywhere.

Or I could just leave it alone, since I really didn't notice the issue until just now when I tried validating my fonts -- they are the same fonts after all.\nWhat are the pros/cons/considerations of each solution I've proposed? Is there a third way? How do you prefer to deal with this?\n\nA: If you want to save space and remove the extra fonts, I'd recommend selecting everything, then right-clicking and selecting \"Resolve Duplicates.\" I'm fairly sure Font Book favors fonts without any detectable bugs and with more characters, but in any case it will automatically disable any duplicate fonts.\n\n\nA: I've not seen any information showing that the Microsoft fonts are superior in terms of kerning, quality, or cross platform compatibility, so I just delete them and prefer to keep the OS X fonts.\n\nA: If you want to get anal about fonts you may find this PDF useful. It is by Extensis, the guys that make things like Suitcase Fusion and Universal Type Server/Client.\nIt is full of handy advice from a general viewpoint (i.e. not 'buy our product') and probably more information than you really want or need.\nI'm not sure if it has been updated for Lion yet so tread carefully if you carry out any system font management on the basis of something in the PDF. I haven't used Lion enough yet to know how differently it handles fonts to 10.6 so will probably struggle to help if something goes wrong!\n\nA: Font Book lets you simply disable duplicate fonts, if you think they're causing a problem.

That will get rid of most of the size (7.5GB out of 11.1GB for me, but I'm pretty sure some of that gets downloaded when you open Xcode and another 2GB was project files).\nYou might be able to delete the /Developer folder completely, but definitely have a backup before you try because the compilers might use files stored in there.\n\nA: I am almost positive the gcc tools need Xcode to properly run as well.\n", "Q: Is there a way to auto \"put back\" everything in Trash? My wife saw the folder 'all documents' in Finder and decided to move it all to the trash. \nNow we have over 9,000 files in the trash and I haven't been able to find a way to put back everything with one click.\nFor some reason it will only let me 'put back' one file at a time.\nIs there any way to automate this?\n\nA: Try running a script like this in AppleScript Editor:\nrepeat\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        close windows\n        if items of trash is {} then return\n        open trash\n        activate\n    end tell\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        key code 125 -- down arrow\n        key code 51 using command down -- command-delete\n    end tell\nend repeat\n\nIf Finder shows a password dialog when you try to put back some item, try adding something like this to the end of the tell application \"System Events\" block:\ndelay 1\nif exists window 1 of process \"SecurityAgent\" then\n    tell window 1 of process \"SecurityAgent\"\n        set value of text field 2 of scroll area 1 of group 1 to \"pa55word\"\n        click button 2 of group 2\n    end tell\nend if\ndelay 1\n\n\nA: This AppleScript code works for me using the latest version of macOS Mojave.\nThis code will loop through every item in the trash, putting each item back to their original location.\nIf any of the original source folders of the files in the Trash no longer exist, the repeat until trashCount is 0 command will exit the loop.  Any remaining files in the Trash will only be files that could not be put back because of this reason.\nUPDATE\nSince it is possible to select an item on your desktop during the repeat loop of the process of putting back files from the trash, the selected desktop item can get caught up in the process and be moved to the trash.  To avoid this scenario, I added code which will lock the currently unlocked Desktop items and will also unlock them at the end of the script.\nBecause all Desktop items are now locked... During the process of putting back files from the trash, if for some reason you accidentally select a file or folder on your desktop and the code attempts to process that selected desktop item... It will generate a dialog window mentioning that item is locked and ask if you want to continue sending it to the trash.

I just tried it and if you double click your trash can then right click the files you wish to restore there is a \"put back\" option which only works file by file, as said i would highlight then press C-c (command c)to copy then C-v(command v) to paste them back.\n\nA: Prior to Snow Leopard, OS X does not natively have the ability to restore files to their original locations that they were deleted from (as can be done natively in a Windows environment with the \"Restore\" option in the context menu for Recycle Bin). I accidentally did the same thing as your wife did at one point with around 10,000 plus files being deleted.\nAfter exploring all my options I performed a system restore via Time Machine. It was by far the most expedient method to get said files to their proper locations.\n\nA: This worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new folder in Finder, I called mine \"recovered files\"\n\n*Open Trash folder and select a group of files\n\n*Copy files and paste into \"recovered files\" folder.\n\n\nIf you need to put back a large folder, or a large number of individual files, use this technique.  If you need only 1 or 2 files, just use the \"put back\" feature.  \n\nA: Drag all files from Trash to All My Files tab in Finder. It will take a while if you have a lot of files. We tested on 10000+ files. Finder will restore all files to its original location. \n\nA: Based on a near solution that @thierry already gave here from Giacomo Balli, we created this solution to help several of you, since the problem still remains. When you delete a file in MacOS, its original locations is stored in the .DsStore hidden files in case you want to restore it. Recent versions of macOS have the ability to put stuff in your Trash back where it came from, lickety-split, and it’s way faster than dragging and dropping. So as you know, if you click on the trash icon in your Dock, you will see the items you have, well, trashed. Right-click or Control-click on any file (or hold down Command to click and select multiple items, then Control-click), and you will see the Put Back option. The only problem is that it let us do it for only one item at the time.\nSolution\n\n\n*\n\n*Start by cloning the repository to your local machine so you may begin to use our solution;\ngit clone git@github.com:opprDev/trash-back.git\ncd trash-back\n\n*Run the AppleScript on that computer, via the osascript command;\nosascript scripts/trash-back.scpt\nConclusions\nRunning AppleScript greatly increases what you can do remotely from the command line, and enables a lot of cool tricks that are hard to do otherwise. While you can run whole scripts in the command line, this way of running is only about running can also log into a remote computer (using ssh) and run the AppleScript on that computer, via the osascript command. The osascript command can also run any other Open Scripting Architecture language using the -l modifier.\n", "Q: Switch Apple ID I bought an iPad 2 last May and used my husband's Apple ID that he uses for iTunes.  \nI have used his ID to buy apps for my iPad 2 and even bought iTunes cards to put on his account. Well, now I have an iPhone, iMac and have my own Apple ID.\nQuestion - can I switch it to my ID without him losing his ID?  I have found where I can edit my ID but I don't want him to lose his account.\n\nA: He won't lose his account if you switch Apple IDs. However, you might want to  continue to share his ID for iTunes and App Store purchases (for all of your Apple devices) so you will keep convenient access to the apps and media you've already purchased and you can both share your purchases on your various devices. You can use your new Apple ID for iCloud services.\n\nA: You can only have one Apple ID linked to a device, and considering you now have the iPhone and a Mac it is a good idea to sign up for your own Apple ID rather than edit his.\nIn order to keep all your previous purchases you will need to sync the device with your computer.\nHowever before you sync with the computer you should authorize both your new Apple ID and his old one. iTunes will then sync all the purchases made on both accounts to your devices, while keeping iCloud content linked to only your devices\n", "Q: Will a MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2010) power up in clamshell mode? Although part of my problem is covered here - Powering on while the lid is closed in clamshell mode, it alone doesn't solve my query.\nI'm trying to turn my MBP into a server, and because of that I want to keep the lid closed. I'm using InsomniaX to keep it from going to sleep, which usually works for just keeping the computer awake.\nI want to be able to restart my computer remotely (I already have this implemented), in its lid closed state, and have it not go to sleep after the boot.\nI've heard I could connect an external monitor, but I don't exactly have one laying around to use, so is there a way to mimic one?\nIs there an app to disable the sleeping that happens on a MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2010) after the computer is booted up with the display shut completely?\n\nA: An easy way to spoof a monitor connector is to use a VGA adapter, and connect a VGA Dummy-plug (sometimes called a \"VGA Terminator\").\nThere are a number of tutorials on how to make your own - here and here are other (though these involve soldering).\nYou can also buy them in DVI-A and VGA flavors.\nIf you want something that spoofs a DVI-D interface into thinking there is an attached monitor, it is a lot more work.\n\nA: Two problems must be overcome in general.\n\n\n*\n\n*no controllable power button\n\n*preventing sleep on a hardware level\n\n\nIn specific, your Mac's battery isn't easily removable nor is the power circuitry easily modified so you'll likely want a wired connection to ensure wake on lan (WOL) works to wake the machine if and when it falls asleep. \nYou mentioned you had solved the power issue - so I'll assume you either modified the internal switch, have a controllable power source or a mechanical lever that can push even with the lid closed (a portable slim jim!)\nSince the sleep happens in EFI and at the OS level, looking for an app to run is unlikely to be able to prevent sleep unless that app modifies the OS / EFI. Until someone makes or links to such app, you'll need to provide the mac with the signals it looks for to prevent sleep. \nI've had success with an USB mouse or keyboard and viable monitor connector will keep the display off in clamshell mode, bypassing the sleep sensor. Have you tried the VGA adapter for mini Display Port? I just tape a rubber bumper on both sides of the palm rest to keep the lid open a crack as that takes less space overall than leaving the adapter dongle on the desk.\n", "Q: How to find which ports depends on a given one when using macports? I want to find which ports depends on a given installed port (texlive in my case). I found port deps texlive, but this is working in the \"wrong\" direction. How can I do it?\n\nA: port echo dependentof:texlive\n\nI believe that this will only show you a list of port installed on your machine that depend on the port. \n\nA: Use port dependents <portname>. From man port:\n\ndependents\n         Lists the installed ports that depend on the port portname.\n\nThere is no way to search for all ports (including those not installed) depending on a certain port.\n", "Q: Is there such a thing as a iPad stylus with a (relatively) fine and hard nib? I use the Griffin stylus and although it does the job well enough it's a long way removed from using a pen on a tablet - I find the soft nib makes it difficult to write accurately. The other pens I've seen all seem to have a similar design - presumably to make the nib appear to the iPad as a finger.\nI understand pressure sensitivity isn't going to be an option but a relatively hard nib would make it a lot easier to 'write' on the iPad.\n\nA: Thoroughly recommend the Cosmonaut:\nhttp://www.studioneat.com/products/cosmonaut\nStill a relatively soft nib but the size of the stylus nib seems to reduce the squidgy resistance I've experienced with smaller stylus.

I am using Homebrew exclusively (i.e. I don’t, and won’t, use MacPorts or Fink). I also want to keep manual installations to a bare minimum.1\n… But how can I install GCC?\nFirst of all, I’ve of course installed Xcode but the current version doesn’t ship with a decently up to date GCC (I need ata least 4.5, but would prefer the most recent one) – in fact, it doesn’t ship with a proper GCC at all (it only ships Clang) and that seems to be a problem for Homebrew …\nI’m aware of a list of custom GCC and cross compilers but in fact all of those installations require an already installed GCC – at least, brewing them fails with linker errors on Lion which I attribute to Clang, and -use-gcc doesn’t work for obvious reasons.\nbrew doctor only mentions what I already know, that there is no GCC (4.2.x) installed.\n\n1 I’ve previously mixed MacPorts, Homebrew and some manual installations and have ended up with a maintenance and versioning hell. I don’t want to go there again.\n\nA: I too had this problem.  What's more is that I need to use gfortran, which doesn't come with the standard (outdated) install of Mac's llvm-gcc.  \nI've found the High Performance Computing builds of gcc to be up-to-date and work great on Lion.\n\nA: In case anyone looks at this old thread, it seems homebrew/versions, used in the currently accepted answer, has been deprecated in favor of homebrew/core. Just run brew install <formula>.\n\nA: Homebrew solution\nTo answer my own question, homebrew-versions now has a fairly up to date formula of GCC. It can be installed using\nbrew install [flags] https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-versions/gcc48.rb\n\nWhere [flags] should include all the required languages, e.g. (--enable-cxx --enable-fortran).\nThis will install the executables with a suffix, i.e. gcc has to be accessed as gcc-version to avoid clashes. If necessary, one can create appropriate symlinks to make this version the default.\nManual installation\nAlternatively, an up-to-date GCC (as of the time of writing) can be compiled manually using the following shell script:\nVERSION=4.7.0\nPREFIX=/usr/gcc-$(VERSION)\nLANGUAGES=c,c++,fortran\nMAKE=make\n# Or\n# MAKE='make -j 4' # to compile using four cores\n\nbrew-path() { brew info $1 | head -n3 | tail -n1 | cut -d' ' -f1; }\n\n# Prerequisites\n\nbrew install gmp\nbrew install mpfr\nbrew install libmpc\n\n# Download & install the latest GCC\n\nmkdir -p $PREFIX\nmkdir temp-gcc\ncd temp-gcc\nwget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-$VERSION/gcc-$VERSION.tar.gz\ntar xfz gcc-$VERSION.tar.gz\nrm gcc-$VERSION.tar.gz\ncd gcc-$VERSION\n\nmkdir build\ncd build\n\n../configure \\\n   --prefix=$PREFIX \\\n   --with-gmp=$(brew-path gmp) \\\n   --with-mpfr=$(brew-path mpfr) \\\n   --with-mpc=$(brew-path libmpc) \\\n   --program-suffix=-$VERSION \\\n   --enable-languages=$LANGUAGES \\\n   --with-system-zlib \\\n   --enable-stage1-checking \\\n   --enable-plugin \\\n   --enable-lto \\\n   --disable-multilib\n\n$MAKE bootstrap\n\nmake install\n\n# Uncomment for cleanup …\n# cd ../../..\n# rm -r temp-gcc\n\nThis will stage GCC into the path /usr/gcc-4.7.0. Now all you need to do is either create symlinks to the executables or add the bin directory to the $PATH variable.\n\nA: The solution provided by @Konrad Rudolph is not entirely correct anymore as the GCC formula that he mentioned was moved from homebrew/dupes to homebrew/versions. You can choose which version of GCC to install. For example, at the time of writing this answer, version 4.5, 4.7 and 4.8 are available. You may check out what versions are available here.\nIn short, you can install GCC 4.8 by using\nbrew tap homebrew/versions\nbrew install [flags] gcc48\n\nYou can view available install flags by using\nbrew options gcc48\n\n\nA: I saw somebody link to this old post today. The best way to install GCC in homebrew right now is just brew install gcc. If you have the XCode Command Line Tools (they are separate from XCode; you can install them with xcode-select --install) installed, a precompiled version will be installed (which is very fast).\n\nA: You might try this - https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer - I have used it successfully after upgrading to Lion to compile packages with Homebrew and others (Ruby).\nFrom the read me:\nOSX GCC Installer\nDownloading and installing the massive Xcode installer is a huge hassle if you just want GCC and related tools.\nThe osx-gcc-installer allows you to install the essential compilers from either pre-built binary packages or helps you create your own installer.\n\nA: Command: brew update\n brew install gcc  \nlocation : /usr/local/Cellar/gcc/10.2.0_4: 1 \nCommand: brew update  \nbrew install app\nlocation: /usr/local/Cellar/gpp/2.27\n", "Q: What is the keyboard shortcut to focus this textfield in Xcode 4.1?

In Lion, Alt+clicking the volume icon allows you to switch its function (and that of the keyboard shortcuts) between all connected output and input devices, plus any software devices such as Soundflower or Boom that might be running.

I found an app on the iOS App Store available in both lite and paid version, but it has too many bugs.

I want to report to Apple about this app. Is there any standard procedure to do that?\n\nA: In the App store you have a link to the developer page where you can find contact information and submit a bug report\nYou can also review the application putting the problems in the comment\nAs far as I know Apple does not guarantee for the quality of the products offered in the store (quoting from the terms and conditions of the Apple Store)\n\nYOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE APP AND BOOK SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.

This also is useful if you wish to ask for a refund in the case where the app was paid and doesn't function in your judgement. \n\n*There is a general problem link in the store as well as a link to developer support. These are best for technical or minor bugs that don't ruin the app experience or if you expect it to get fixed and continue to use the app.\n\n*You can write a formal review that Apple may eventually publish detailing why you feel the app is buggy or non-confomant with design guidelines or rules.\n\n*You can rate the app in stars\n\n\nThose three procedures are standard ways to provide feedback about buggy apps or problematic purchases. Deleting the app sends less formal feedback as your devices stop asking for updates to that title. \n\n\nA: In general, please use the Support link for the developer of the problem app, which can be found on the iTunes page for that app.  Most developers (not all though) are very happy to receive problem reports directly from customers, as this helps them more quickly fix bugs and update their apps, and improve the documentation on how to use their app.\nAlso look within the app for a support link or email address, as many apps have that built in to the app.\nFor the better developers, contacting them can potentially help improve the app for all their apps current customers.\nOf course, final recourse, if the developer is not responsive, or can't fix the problem, is to report your problem to Apple.  The contact info for this can be found in the email receipt from Apple iTunes for your purchase, as the \"Report a Problem\" link.  Note, however, that Apple is rarely ever reported have removed merely buggy or ugly apps from their App store, unless the app violates user privacy, decency rules, trademark/IP laws, or worse.

However, I have no idea how this is done in practice - Google only gives me guides to remove the SIM lock after jailbreaking and such.\nOf course, I can simply ask my service provider what to do, but they are professionals when it comes to being unhelpful and misleading when it is in their best interest, so I'm trying to ask here first.\nOther phone users (not iPhone) I asked said they only had to insert a code given from their service provider. I see no place in the iPhone where such a code can be entered. So, if there is such a place - where is it? If not - how can I remove the SIM lock with most ease?\n\nA: Without going into the technical details, iOS ships in a deactivated state and needs to contact an activation server to determine the carrier and locking status each time the device is restored.\niTunes performs the unlocking of all phones less than iOS 5. With iOS5, the device can self activate or activate through iTunes.\nWhen a device is sold, it enters the database as an unlocked device or a locked device. You need the entity that has a lock on your device to update this database. It doesn't really matter if they type it into their system or pass a message to Apple that the device should now be unlocked, but iOS doesn't seem to have a place to enter a unlock code for DIY unlocking and instead depends on the activation process to determine GSM lock status.\n\nI haven't seen it documented anywhere, but my presumption is that Apple operates the service that determines which phone on a serial number / IMEI basis should be locked or unlocked. Given the millions of devices this system is surely automated and authority to make changes to the database is delegated through to the carriers to handle their own unlock requests.\n\nEven here in the US where our Library of Congress has stated for the record that consumers are allowed by law to unlock their devices in certain circumstances, I have yet to see a documented case where someone actually got AT&T to perform a true unlock as described above.\n\nA: Official iPhone unlocking only comes from Apple. So you'll have to go through your service provider if you want to unlock your phone.\nYour carrier will then contact Apple about unlocking the phone. Your iPhone will be identified by its IMEI number. Once this is done, your carrier will contact you (it can take up to a week).\nThen, you will have to restore your iPhone through iTunes.\nOnly then, your iPhone will be unlocked.\n\nA: This poped up on my iPhone last year. We called apple and they gave me a code the first time then when it happened again they told me to set a code mines 0000 try it or call to see if there's any other way.\n", "Q: Does Growl keep a history? Does Growl, either natively or with an extension, keep a history, possibly accessible through a graphic interface?\n(something like Jumpcut, I mean)\nI'm talking about OSX 10.6 (hence Growl 1.2.2), I dunno if the Lion version is different.\n\nA: Growl 1.3 (available on the Mac App Store) supports a history of notifications, and additionally a rollup of all notifications while you are away from the computer. Unfortunately it requires Mac OS X Lion. You can get to the history right from the Growl Preferences.\nEarlier versions did not have this feature.\n", "Q: iTunes won't sync podcasts in folder I have some podcasts that I've put in a playlist, the playlist is supposed to sync with my iPhone - however when I try to sync with my iPhone, the podcasts doesn't sync.\nI suppose this has something to do with my Podcast syncing options, options that are working well for me, so I don't want to change them.\nIs there a way to tell iTunes that a podcast is no longer a podcast, but merely an audio file? I've tried to change the genre to no luck.\nAny ideas? :)\n\nA: I went into the podcasts tab at the top and had to select 'sync podcasts automatically' before mine would start working. Hope this works for others too!\n\nA: I had the same problem recently. \nI fixed it by deselecting the problem podcasts, syncing, then selecting them again. After this, the podcasts transferred correctly to the iPhone, and have synced happily since then. \n\nA: I had the same problem.  You have to go into your device menu in iTunes (not the library page showing what you've got.)  Then click on Podcasts on the left.  Then in the big page on the right you should select automatically sync podcasts, but then the big issue is scroll way down on that page and you have to actually tick the box on the playlists you want to appear and sync.  \n", "Q: Growl 1.3+: Location of (rollup) Log for use with GeekTool Where can I find Growl's log(s)? Would like to use with GeekTool to display it on the desktop.\n\nA: Growl uses a CoreData database located in ~/Library/Application Support/Growl/\nThe database is a file called notifications.history\nEdit: there does not as yet appear to be any way to communicate with the Growl Control Suite say via AppleScript, to read the database.  The functions there are limited. See the Growl AppleScript documentation here\nYou would have to communicate with the database directly, a database model is included within each build of Growl.\n\nA: They're located at ~/Library/Application Support/Growl/notifications.history.\n", "Q: iCloud storage in Finder What's the way to use the free iCloud 5GB storage space?\nI want to store misc files in there, and access them freely from the Finder/put links to them on my desktop, etc - how do I do it? Couldn't find any intuitive way.\n(asking for same functionality like Dropbox/Box.net)\nP.S.\nWill it be possible to access those files later on from a Windows machine too?\n\nA: There is a folder, located at ~/Library/Mobile Documents/, that iCloud-enabled apps store their data in. You can trickily use this folder by simply putting any files in there that you want to access from another iCloud-enabled computer. Unfortunately, there's no way to access this folder via the web or on an iOS device, but Macs synced to the same iCloud account will all have your files in that location. I'd recommend creating an alias of some sort as well, to get quick access to it.\nIn answer to your P.S., there is no way to access this folder on Windows, as it doesn't exist. If you are for some reason only wanting to move iWork files, you can use and access the iCloud web interface on any computer, but I doubt this will help you.\n\nA: Unfortunately, there's no way to use the iCloud storage outside the services and apps that make use of it. \n\nUnlike Dropbox and SugarSync, which are designed to let you sync any file or folder on your computer through their services, iCloud is focused on integration with apps: Any iCloud-enabled app will sync documents automatically to the service’s server. As such, you won’t be able to sync individual files from apps that don’t offer iCloud support.\n  source\n\nThe idea of iCloud is, you have this XX space, but you can use it throughout the interfaces we provide. Namely iPhoto, iTunes Match, iWork, Any AppStore app that makes use of the iCloud Storage APIs, Backup of iOS5 devices, etc. \n", "Q: Mac App Store only downloading at only 12-20 kbps? So, I am trying to download an app from the Mac App Store and the download is only coming through at 12-20 kbps. I noticed it was also affecting iTunes downloads as well but all other applications seem to be working at full speed. What can I do to alleviate this problem?\n\nA: The Mac App Store uses the same servers as iTunes downloads use. Something on your network may be throttling traffic to those servers (this is common in company networks). You might be able to work around it using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) service.\n", "Q: How do I change the email address that iCal alerts are sent to? When I set up email alerts in iCal, a popup list allows me to choose one of my email addresses, but there is no way to enter a custom email address. How do I change the email address that iCal sends notifications to?\n\nA: The simplest solution would be to add the address to which you want alarms sent to your Address Book entry. Beyond that, I don't have an elegant workaround, but you could, for example, run a script that could contain a variable to send alerts to multiple recipients.\nI sympathize in that it's annoying that your Address Book entry is forced to contain a mix of public and private information used for various, and differing, purposes. This is one of Apple's many decisions that (I assume) works for the majority of the user population, but bites the outliers in various ways.\n\nA: Check your address book. Find your name and see you have two or more email addresses listed in your name. Remove the address you do not want.\niCal should use the email address you have listed as \"work\" email address.\n", "Q: How to best manage 1 iTunes account with SEVERAL devices in our family. We have 1 iTunes account for my family. We have 4 iPhones, 1 iPad, 2 MacBooks, 1 iMac, and several iPods.\nI understand that each device can be configured to only sync certain playlists, so I do not have to listen to my husband's music, or kids' music, and vice versa.\nWhat I do not understand is that when I try to sync my iPhone, I get 100 apps on my phone.  Is there a way to create playlists for apps and have only certain apps sync with certain devices?\nAlso, I have all of my business contacts, my work notes, etc. on my phone, which I do not want on my kids' phones.  Do I ultimately need another account?\nIf I need another account, can I still share everything that is already on the original account, or do I lose it? Thanks!\n\nA: You can use a shared Apple ID for the iTunes, and app store purchases. Yes, you can select which apps sync to different devices\n\nTo sync downloaded apps to iPod touch, iPhone, or iPad: Connect your\n  iPod touch, iPhone, or iPad to your computer.\nIn iTunes, select your device (below Devices), and then click the Apps\n  button.\nSelect Sync Apps, and then select the apps you want to sync.\n\nYou can create a unique Apple ID to use that for syncing contacts and calendars via iCloud. You can also sync contacts and calendars from an Exchange Server (or Google). Assuming you don't share your Mac account across the entire family, you can also just opt to sync contacts and calendars locally. \nYou may find the Macworld article All about iCloud: Common signup scenarios to be useful.\n\nA: One thing I've been reminded of recently is that your iTunes app can address multiple different iTunes libraries under the same log-in. It's not implemented very elegantly but you can do it. Here's an article in MacWorld (January 17, 2012) that explains how, and also has tips about making sure that certain apps only sync with certain devices, by using different iTunes libraries.\nWhen new apps and old iOS devices don't mix\nThe other option is to create several different log-on accounts, one for each family member, and have each of them set up their own iTunes library for each device. The problem there is that they would not all have access to the same iTunes music library to copy music freely between devices.\n", "Q: What are the networking requirements for AirPrint? I'm trying to get AirPrint setup at work.  I've used it at home with AirPrint Activator with no problems.  But it doesn't seem to work on my work network.\nI suspect our network is too locked down to allow this.  But I haven't been able to find any documentation that specifically outlines the requirements for AirPrint in terms of ports required, etc.  I need to be able to give my network admin something concrete in terms of what he needs to do to open this up for me.\nDoes such a document exist?  Or can someone at least give me pointers on what needs to be opened up?\n\nA: AirPrint only works with AirPrint compatible printers, unless you have special software to connect to the printer running on a machine the printer is locally connected to. A great solution for a work environment is the xPrintServer. It's a network adapter that attaches via ethernet to your network and is supposed to make any printer on the network it's attached to AirPrint compatible. It's available for preorder now. I'd partner with your network administrator to see if this is something that is right for your workplace.\n\nA: Googling, I saw varying lists of ports to allow AirPrint connectivity and wanted an objective answer.  So I packet sniffed the interface my AirPrint print job was made on (image is a screen-grab from a MikroTik).  Would appear the client (192.168.4.49) connects from a dynamic port range IP to the printer (192.168.3.67) on port TCP/631.  Obviously allow Bonjour on UDP/5353 for those on a flat network:\n\n\nA: The two devices must be on the same network segment. Broadcast traffic is used by the bonjour service to discover connected printers when iOS asks around to find any printers advertising service.\nYes - you can have advanced routing where multicast packets get sent to remote printers, but in the simple case, devices simply need to be on the same VLAN and be able to talk amongst themselves when it's time to print.\n\nA: On a Aruba Network infrastructure with Mobility controller or Instant Access Point, there is a feature called AirGroup that will route across VLAN the mdns traffic for the bonjour services. It will act as a gateway where you can create rules to manage who can access what, when, etc.\n\nA: On a Windows environment, download and install Window AirPrint Installer (Windows AirPrint Installer iOS 5 for x86 x64).  It has a register file that needs to be installed, either 32-bit and 64-bit versions (depending on what kind of Windows OS is running, 32-bit or 64-bit).  Follow the instructions.  It allows non-AirPrint printers connected to a Windows machine (Windows XP to Windows 10) to receive and print documents as an AirPrint destination from your Apple device (iOS).  You also need to download and install a Bonjour services package from Apple.\nFor the firewall, the following ports need to be open:\nInbound TCP traffic to port 631 on the Windows machine\nInbound UDP traffic to port 5353 on the Windows machine\nInbound TCP traffic to port 5354 on the Windows machine\n\nPrint in good health from your iOS device\n\nA: Hokey, today (check the date of the post), I managed it.\nThis particular setup is a bit more complex then the question, but it\nshould show the answer. Short(): as the previous post, open port 631.\n() the port might not be enough, depending on your network set up.\nHere is one example.\nI have:\n1 router to connect to the internet (mikro)(a mikrotik on network 192.168.100.0/24)\n1 router for home computers (cave)(bluecave set up as router on: 192.168.2.0/24)\n1 router for home devices (turris)(turris omina on 192.168.1.0/24)\nI need computers from \"cave\" to print on a wifi printer on \"turris\".\nFirst i needed to have the printer to get a fixed IP on the turris.\n(on turris it is easy to fix the IP), you need to do the same on your router.\nLet's assume: 192.168.1.111 (printer)\nThen I needed to fix the IP of the turris versus the mikro.\n(again the same, mikro I got it), you need to do the same on your main router.\nLet's assume: 192.168.100.222 (turris)\nOn the turris I port forwarded 9100 and 631 to 192.168.1.111.\nThe \"computers\" should be able to see the printer at the 192.168.100.222.\nSo the answer is(*): open port 631.\nBut as you see it depends a bit on your setup.\n\n*\n\n*I am not sure if 9100 is also needed, I did it for no mac computers.\n\n*My local network has no DNS, but on the other side is discoverable.\n\nHope this helps.\nprinter -> WiFi -> turris -> Cable -> Mikro <- cable <- cave <- Wifi <- computer\n", "Q: Can you restore a phone with an old version of iOS if that phone was never upgraded? I have a couple of iPhones running iOS 4 that I want to do a restore on. These phones have never been jailbroken, and I'm using the .ipsw that is the exact same version that's currently on the phone:\niPhone 4 - 4.3.5 (8L1)\niPhone 3GS - 4.3.2 (8H7)\nWhen I try to restore from the .ipsw in Windows 7, I get the error:\nThe iPhone \"myphone\" could not be restored. An unknown error occurred (3194).\n\nThis error means that I need to upgrade iTunes, but I'm running the latest version. Also, I'm able to restore my other iPhone 4 using 5.0.1 just fine.\nWhen I try to do the same on my Mac, I get the error:\nThe iPhone \"myphone\" could not be restored. The device isn't eligible for the requested build.\n\nWhen I click \"More Information\" I see that it's also error 3194.\nI checked in WireShark, and I do get a TCP connection with apple just before the error. It's encrypted though, so I have no idea what it sends/receives, but I can confirm that there's two-way communication. I tried the restore both over my company's connection, and my 3G connection just to make sure it didn't have anything to do with the IP address I was using. Also, I verified that the phones are authorized for that iTunes installation.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: The official answer to this is no, you can not restore to a previous version of iOS other than the current one available from Apple. This is because iTunes is attempting to obtain tokens from the Apple signing servers to authorize the device when restoring.\nThe non official answer is yes, but requires some technical skills using iFaith. Post back if you require assistance down this path.\n", "Q: How do I move a file into a folder in the iOS version of DropBox? I uploaded a file from my email to DropBox on my iPad.

Is there any way to prevent installing their downloads onto my iPhone?\nAlso, not all of my apps go onto their iPhones. There are expensive apps that I have that have not gone onto their iPhones.  Is there a reason for this?\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: From your iPhone go to Settings > Store and disable Automatic Downloads for Apps. You can elect to do the same for books or music.\nYour sons can visit the App Store and download any app that you've already purchased without being charged, though they will have to know the login information for the Apple ID tied to your iTunes Store account. \nThe alternative is to specify that the applications be synced to their phones from within iTunes.\n\nTo sync downloaded apps to iPod touch, iPhone, or iPad: Connect your\n  iPod touch, iPhone, or iPad to your computer.\nIn iTunes, select your device (below Devices), and then click the Apps\n  button.\nSelect Sync Apps, and then select the apps you want to sync.\n\n\nA: Settings -> iTunes & App Store -> Automatic Downloads - ( Disable It)\n", "Q: Why is my iPhone 4S's home button not responding from home screen?

If not, call Apple for support.\n", "Q: System proxy settings inaccessible by Java, Firefox, VMware Fusion, etc.? I'm stuck on what appears to be an issue with the accessibility of system proxy settings by other programs. I came across this problem while trying (and failing) to run Processing-generated Java applets in Safari.\nFirst, my setup on a MacBookPro8,2:\nMac Host: OS X 10.7.2, Safari 5.1.2, Java for Mac OS X 10.7 Update 1, Chrome 16.0.912.77, Firefox 7.0.1, Processing 1.5.1, Processing 1.2.1, and Processing 2.0a4\nWindows VM: VMware Fusion 4.1.1, Windows 7 Enterprise 64-bit, IE 9.0.4, Java 1.6.0_30, and Processing 1.5.1\nHere's a list of the problems/evidence, and what I did to try fixing them (all attempts at which have failed except where noted).\n\n\n*\n\n*I can't load Java applets in Safari. A page with an applet will reserve a space for displaying that applet, but nothing shows up and the page hangs (I can't scroll, for instance).\n\n*Reinstalled Java for Mac OS X 10.7 Update 1.\n\n*In Safari, tried (i) turning \"Enable Java\" off and on; (ii) clearing caches via \"Reset\nSafari...\".\n\n*In Java Preferences, tried (i) turning \"Enable applet plug-in and Web Start applications\" off and on; (ii) clearing cache via \"Delete Files...\".\n\n*Note that Java itself seems to be working fine: (i) Processing (which uses the JDK, I think) continues to work; (ii) typing java -version into Terminal gives the correct version; (iii) Java works in Windows.\n\n*Java applets also do not work in Chrome.\n---- Now, for why this seems to be a proxy issue ----\n\n*I have no problems at home, where I don't use a proxy! This is only a problem at work, where I've configured proxies for HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and SOCKS with Automatic Proxy Configuration selected. This was all done in the Network preferences panel, and the settings all show up in /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist. They show up in the Terminal via sudo scutil --proxy.\n\n*Firefox works fine at home, but it doesn't load any http sites via proxies at work (it does load simple hostnames on our network, though). Note that Chrome and Safari both seem to obey the system-wide proxy settings. If I specify Firefox's proxy settings manually, then Firefox both (i) loads http addresses correctly (via the proxy) and Java applets load correctly too.\n\n*In Windows, the situation with IE9 is similar to #8 above. Manual proxy settings make all problems go away: Java works, and pages load. Please note that I never had to set the proxy settings manually before. Windows seemed to pull the appropriate settings from OS X via VMware Fusion.\n\n*I checked the Java net.properties file to make sure that the \"java.net.useSystemProxies\" setting wasn't affecting me. According to the comments in this file, even though this is set to \"false,\" the setting will be ignored by OS X. I tried changing it to \"true\" anyway, with no effect. (Changed it back to \"false\" afterwards.)\n\n*This one's odd: I just noticed that in Terminal, the hostname is showing up as something set by our network, rather than as my computer name. I think that this is a new behavior that has cropped up at around the same time as the Java issue.\n\n*By the way, tried repairing preferences via Disk Utility. No repairs were reported.\n\n*Created a new user. Problem was present in this account as well.\n\n*Tried starting in Safe Mode. Problem present.\n\n\nSo, all of the above leads me to believe that the problem is based on programs (Firefox, Fusion, Java) being unable to access the system-wide proxy settings. Again: I can't recreate any of these problems when I'm not using proxies, and they go away in instances when I can clearly specify them for specific applications (Firefox, Windows).\nHow can I fix this problem? After trying tons of stuff and searching for everything I can think of, I'm at the end of my line here. I'm absolutely trying to avoid reinstalling Lion, but that's the last option I can think of. I'm hoping that someone comes up with a better solution. Your thoughts?\n\nA: I have the same issue. When I use a proxy.pac file certain applications fail to pick up the settings. Among these are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Firefox\n\n*Chrome\n\n*Java apps (like eclipse)\n\n\nSome apps that do work with the pac file are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Safari\n\n*Skype\n\n*Adium\n\n*Evernote\n\n\nWhat I have found though, is that when I manually add a proxy server to the system preferences it is picked up by all applications. So something in the pac handling is broken. Maybe old/new APIs in Lion?\n", "Q: Is it possible to boot OS X 10.6 from a USB drive with VMWare Fusion 3.1.3? I have USB drive with a partition containing OS X 10.6. I boot from this drive to use an app which doesn't run in Lion (Xcode 3.2.5).

I have tried Booting Operating System from USB Drive in VMware Fusion 3.x but it doesn't work for OS X (I changed the settings to OS X 10.6 Server instead of Windows 7). I have VMWare Fusion 3.1.3.\n\nA: You need 10.6 Server. It does not help to change the settings to 10.6 Server, you have to use 10.6 Server as operating system on the USB-Stick… or you can try some hacks, e.g. Hackintosh (search for it in Google) in a virtual environment but that's a little bit more complicated you can check\nhttp://wiki.osx86project.org/wiki/index.php/Installation_Guides#VMware_Install_Guides\nfor this. \n", "Q: Gmail account in Mail on SnowLeopard: how well does it work?

Does a gmail account work correctly in Mail (also via IMAP) on SnowLeopard? If not, what are the issues?\n\nA: It works just as well as in Lion.\n\nA: I'm assuming you are configuring Gmail for IMAP and not POP. Google has posted extensive instructions on optimizing Gmail with Apple Mail. You should check them out.\nApple Mail 4 with Gmail\nGmail Recommended Client Settings for IMAP\nThere is also this excellent article from MacWorld, March 14, 2011: How to make Gmail work well with  [Apple] Mail.\n", "Q: How to set a default font for outgoing messages in Mail on Lion Mail in OS X 10.7 (Lion) doesn't allow me to set a default font for outgoing messages, and it's finicky when I change it in the message.\nWhen I show the font bar (by clicking the A button at the top right of the message window), the font bar doesn't retain its value if I set it before typing any text.  If I change it and then start typing, it changes to what I set it as, but if I delete all my text then it reverts to default (Helvetica).\nHow do I get around this?  Is there a plugin to solve this, is it considered  a bug...?  I found the Universal Mailer plugin, which is now open source.\n\nA: Mail has lacked the ability to set a default outgoing font via its Preferences since at least 10.4.  Users who really need this, often switch to Outlook/Entourage or Thunderbird. There are also some plugins, such as Universal Mailer or Message Font that can do this.\n\nA: Unfortunately Matt Love has it wrong. I was pulling my hair out because of this issue, particularly when sending to people who use Outlook. I did some digging, and if you take a look at the message source you'll notice that Mail does not use the font-family tags around the body text. Therefore, the Mail client will default the body text to whatever it's default is. In the case of Outlook, it's Times New Roman. Beyond that, it's particularly frustrating if you've created a signature and clicked the \"Always match my default font\", because in that case Mail will wrap the signature with size and font-family, but the body text will look totally different. Worse, in some cases where text is wrapped to indicate font size, it's using the relative CSS term \"medium\", which can produce strange results. Also, since no font-size for the body text is declared, in Outlook it ends up larger than my signature which is set at 14px, but when viewing through Gmail in a browser, the body is smaller than the sig.\nYou can also poke around with the actual signature files to get a feel for what's going on:\n~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/Signatures (Mountain Lion, exact paths may differ)\nI stripped the font-family declarations (so at least if it does end up as the mail client's default all the text is the same font) and made sure every font-size declaration was in px, and it's somewhat consistent now other than the difference between sig and body.\nIn my opinion this is a bug; maybe we should all go file it as such through Apple to get their attention. In the meantime, Tom Gewecke's suggestions might be the only solution.\nUpdate: I tried Universal Mailer and as the commenter above describes it works perfectly. You have to pay $4 to get the full version otherwise you get additional text put on the bottom of every email.\nUpdate: It looks like Apple has fixed this is OS X Mavericks.

If you want to use a font that is not installed by Apple, your only option is to represent the text as an image. \nI occassionally do this for a font-critical headline but best practice dictates use of iOS compatible fonts in Keynote presentations intended for those devices.\nI wouldn't even trust that iOS would (necessarily) default to Helvetica in the scenario you present. \n\nA: I think Keynote on the iOS Device will use a default fallback if you're using a font which is not available on iOS. \n", "Q: Concatenating Lots of Small MP3 Files I have lots of MP3 files that make 1 book. But they're all only about 5 minutes long. Is there an easy way to concatenate all of these that runs in OS X 10.7 (Lion)?\n\nA: For audiobooks, I prefer AudioBook Builder, which takes a bunch of mp3 files and merges them into the audiobook format instead. Advantages of this format is chaptering and the ability to remember where you left off listening. \n\nA: You can actually use the unix command line utility 'cat' to do this. Open terminal.app (in your /Applications/Utilities folder). You then need to get to the directory these files are in, so if in ~/sys.stderr/book, then cd ~/sys.stderr/book/)\nThen you can run \n\ncat *.mp3 > audiobook.mp3 \n\nAssuming these are all in the right order name wise, they will be added. \nSome tips would be to:\n\n\n*\n\n*backup the original files\n\n*make sure they are all the same bit rate\n\n*strip any current ID3 tags out of the original files\n\n*rename them in the order you need (file1.mp3, file2.mp3, etc) \n\n*do the ID3 tagging after you are done through iTunes or another tool. \n\n\nThere's more information in this Mac OS Hints post as well. \nIf you don't want to use cat, you could also open up GarageBand, make a new file, and then open all the current mp3's and join them together. Then export that new large file as an MP3 of the audiobook (sorry, not on my Mac right now, so don't have screenshots). \n\nA: There's a piece of software called JoinTogether that should do the trick.\n", "Q: How do I share and play music in my office? I would like to use my old Macbook that is hooked up to stereo equipment, as a media server to allow everybody in my office to play or upload music, jukebox style.\nThe best case would be a web interface where I can change the music, an upload feature is not mandatory.\nA solution using Ubuntu would be fine too. :)\n\nA: Check out 'play' from one of the guys at GitHub. Ive had an interest in it, but never had a chance to use it yet. \n\nA: iTunes has this feature built in. Turn on iTunes DJ and let it play. Individuals using the Remote app (iTunes App Store link) can vote for the next song, or outright start the next song.\nIt's not a universal app, but being an iPhone/iPod app means at least it can run on iPads as well.\n\nA: I haven't tried it (was interested by your question so I googled around) but Subsonic looks like a winner imho. Free download available for Windows, Mac, Linux and Unix.\n\nSubsonic is a free, web-based media streamer, providing ubiquitous access to your music. Use it to share your music with friends, or to listen to your own music while at work. You can stream to multiple players simultaneously, for instance to one player in your kitchen and another in your living room.\n\nFrom the features page :\n\nUpload and download files to/from Subsonic, with automatic zipping and unzipping.\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to monitor which disks are spun down in a Mac Pro? I have an 2009 Mac Pro full of disks, most of them seldom used (boots on a SSD). Is there a way to see which disks are spun down at a given time (currently running 10.6.8)?\n\nA: I'm afraid this isn't made possible by the S.M.A.R.T (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) system that is used to provide details of Hard Drive operation, I was hoping to find a SMART attribute that details the current 'park' status, but it seems that there simply isn't one, and as this is a low level activity that is fully handled by the drive itself without any OS input I cannot see a way of ever retrieving the status as the value isn't available in the first place.\n", "Q: Burn Movie to DVD on a Mac \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I convert MKV files and burn them to DVD? \n\nDoes anybody know a good program for Mac that can burn a .avi or .mkv movie file to a DVD to play on any regular DVD player? I am looking for something like ConvertXtoDVD for Windows.\n\nA: Sounds like you need Toast Titanium. Toast will take individual video files and put them into a DVD player compatible format. It doesn't have many options for the DVD's menus, but it's a quick and easy way to burn video files to DVD. It supports both AVIs and MKVs.\n", "Q: Can I upload my Garmin Forerunner running track data from my iPad 2? I use a Garmin Forerunner 405CX GPS watch to track my running.\nAt the moment I have to use an ANT+ USB dongle to get the data (GPX) from my watch on to my computer/laptop.\nI upload the data to the Endomondo and Runkeeper websites either by way of a Firefox/ActiveX plugin or by manually uploading the GPX file.\nI want to remove the laptop from this process so is there a dongle (or similar) that will allow me to perform the same process(es) directly on the iPad?\n\nA: There are a few devices I found that have been recently added to the market\n\n\n*\n\n*Garmin Ant+ adaptor for iPhone\n\n*Wahoo Key for iPhone\nBoth allow you to connect and record in real time exercise data in association with their and other third party apps (Garmin Fit and Wahoo have a list here)\nWhat I have not been able to confirm is whether it will provide upload facility from devices after being out of range as you want. \nMy assumption is yes it can, since you can get swim watch data entry.\nAll the products were originally designed for iPhone and I don't see any issue with running them on an ipad\n", "Q: Is iCloud Document Sync \"delta sync\" or \"full file sync\"? I don't mean iWork docs but for example personal docs in GoodReader iCloud folder and perhaps Mac OS ~/Library/Mobile Documents.\nIs there any official documentation about it?\n\nA: Delta. It splits this intelligently into chunks and only updates the relevant chunks using Rabin fingerprinting.\nYou can see this in Apple's WWDC iCloud presentation, and \nslides.\nA pretty good description of this chunking can be seen in Siracusa's Lion review, however the review describes this process in terms of document versioning, but the fundamentals are the same.\n\nA: I think that it is full file sync.  The delta aspect that you are wondering about would be with Versions (or Time Machine), and that is a separate set of functionality beyond the scope of iCloud's Documents.\n", "Q: Long command in terminal.app cause a bug If I am in the last line of Terminal.app and enter a long command, it does not create new line, but instead overwrites the same line.\nHow can I solve this bug?\n\n\nA: I have a hunch that this is primarily caused by your accented characters (çã) in your directory name, because this is not a problem by default:\n\nSpecial characters, unprintable or otherwise, frequently cause problems with classic terminals / shells.\nTry opening a new terminal tab/window, and see if this problem occurs immediately, or if it doesn't occur until after you enter a directory with special characters.\n", "Q: Problem with returning to iTunes when in full-screen mode I've a problem with full-screen mode in Lion.\nLet's say I opened iTunes and set it to full-screen mode. I start a video in iTunes and when I exit from the video it turns back to iTunes as it should but the iTunes window is in another desktop even though in the header I see iTunes as the active application.\nIn order to see the iTunes window I've to click to the iTunes icon in the Dock or use the application switcher.\nBUT this problem doesn't appear when I don't use iTunes in full-screen mode.\nIn my opinion it's an issue with me upgrading to Lion from Snow Leopard. I'm thinking of a fresh install but even though it's easy to do it will take some time so I would really appreciate your suggestions on the matter.\n\nA: I've had similar problems with other applications running in full screen mode. This is not a problem with your install per say, it's a bug/feature/the way things are. Don't do anything drastic like reinstall the OS because you won't solve the problem.\nWhen this happens I generally move back to the full screen app using Quicksilver. You can do the same thing using the built-in spotlight search ⌘ + spacebar or through Mission Control.\n", "Q: Can iPhone 4S use Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy channels simultaneously? iPhone 4S comes with full support of Bluetooth 4.0, which means it can work in \"low energy\" mode. As far as I know it's a completely different protocol on the physical level, but on the application level in many ways similar to the classic BT.\nMy question is, are there separate radio units for BT and BLE, i.e. can iPhone 4S use both channels simultaneously? For example, can you connect an audio device via BT classic and some low energy heart rate monitor at the same time?\n\nA: Yes, I can confrim it by doing some test. I have do the below experiment, after connect the bluetooth ear to play music, then open app BLE Utility on iphone4s, hit scan with BT2.0 device and BT4.0 device, which can find BT4.0 device on same time.\nThough BT4.0 and 2.0 have physical difference, I think dual-mode BLE can work with two mode on same time by integrate those two parts into one.\n", "Q: How can I use a Linux box's display as a third display for my MacBook Pro? At work, I have a MacBook Pro that I use as my primary machine. I also have a RHEL6 box that has a dual-head graphics card. When my KVM is switched to the Mac, the second display that is hooked to the Linux box is not being used.\nI know there is software the enable other computers to act as displays over a network without an additional physical display connection. Is there software that supports a Linux workstation being the third display for my Mac?\n\nA: I'm not 100% sure if it'll meet your needs, but Synergy works very well as a software KVM and it supports any mix of OS X, Linux and Windows. \n", "Q: How do I determine what is locking up my machine? My MBP is suddenly locking up to the point that only a power down will fix it. Neither command+alt+esc or command+alt+shift+esc do anything. It started by getting some nice screens in multiple languages that told me I had to power down. That happened about four times, now I don't even get those screens it just seems to lock up. I used to get crash reports to send to Apple, the details of which were nebulous but I don't get those anymore either. I am looking at the log but see nothing. Am I missing something?\n\nA: That message means that there is a kernel panic. This may happen if you connect new hardware to your computer. For possible reasons/fixes, see this article from the Apple website. Here is a section from the \"Troubleshooting\" section...\n\n\n*\n\n*Was the computer starting up, shutting down, or performing a\nparticular task when the recurring kernel panic happened?\n\n*Is the kernel panic intermittent, or does it happen every time you do\na certain thing?\n\n*Does it occur only when a certain external device is connected, or\na device is connected to a certain port?\nReading through that article should give you a general idea what is happening and possible ways to fix it.\n\nA: I am presently experiencing the same and, as a former MacGenius, I may be able to shed some light. Does everything freeze? That is, if you are watching something in QuickTime, does that still work but you cannot switch to another app? Can you force quit? Does the problem occur if you are using another user, say, a test account? There was a firmware update for the disk controller. Have you seen if your device is covered? Is there a correlation or series of actions that seem to evoke the behavior? For instance, does the lockup occur while idle for a long time, or after performing transcoding with handbrake (which maxes out the CPUs, thereby causing maximum stress on the machine, the fans, etc)? Have you verified the disk is OK, for example, booting from the install CD, using disk utility or booting from an external HD and running techtool's suite? When I did this, my hard drive and RAM proved to be working correctly and the problem manifests when I use handbrake. In consulting with others, I believe it is a problem with the disk controller on my MBP even though Apple hasn't addressed it with a firmware.\n", "Q: How to share and project Powerpoint presentation with ARD I would like to present a Powerpoint 2011 presentation in a classroom with ~20 student machines equipped with Apple Remote Desktop 3.5.1.  There is also a projector and small screen in front.  I have two closely-related questions: \n\n\n*\n\n*When I project the presentation, I can get the presenter view on the instructor machine, which is great, but, when I share my desktop, students see the presenter view, not the full-screen slide show being projected.  Is there a way to choose which of my displays to share?\n\n*Is Share Screen even the right feature to use?  In the Apple forum, users recommended creating a Powerpoint show and pushing that to user machines, rather than using Screen Share; however, I would like to control the pace of the slides (because of animations, etc.)\n\n\nA: In answer to the first query - When the students connect they should see both of your displays and then be able to select Display 1 or Display 2 for a closer look at either one. These options appear (or not) depending on the display arrangement setup under Displays in System Preferences.\nThe bottom line is, ARD is not really suited to this task. There is a piece of software that does exactly what you're after, but it does cost. It's called LANSchool. \nThe killer LANSchool feature that you're looking for is - 'Show Teacher's Screen'. This overlays your screen onto a selection of student machines. There's a 30 day trial available, I highly recommend you try it out!\n\nA: The built in Lion screen sharing (and older OS) is VNC technology, and on a local network there is no reason why you can't have 5 to 10 macs mirroring the main machine especially if it has a recent CPU and smallish screen (less than 24 inches).\nApple Remote Desktop is nice, and can assist with lowering the quality of the screen / bandwidth.\nDo look into Apple TV and iOS using AirPlay as it's generally far superior and works well with remotes, other iOS devices and can integrate presenter notes using the keynote software and keynote remote. You will need some hardware to get from HDMI to older projectors, but the increase in agility makes it superior and usually worth the expense for a regular setting where you will be presenting.\n", "Q: How can I get Unix (brew/xcode/vim) acting like Unix under Lion? I \"upgraded\" from Snow Leopard with Homebrew and vim both chugging along happily, to Lion. Now vim hangs/segfaults, and when I invoke brew, it complains xcode is missing, and continues to do so after downloading Xcode from the app store. I wanted to install vim from source, but that requires Mercurial, which I may be able to use to create a tarball from a Linux virtual machine, but overall Unix-like functionality is broken on Lion.\nHow can I get Unix acting like Unix under Lion?\n\nA: You may already know this, but downloading/installing Xcode from the app store doesn't actually install it. It just leaves an installer in your Applications folder, which you have to run to actually install Xcode.\nDon't know if this is contributing to your problem, but it tripped me up.\n\nA: If /usr/bin/vim is segfaulting, you might need to disable your dot files or make a new user to get a cleaner environment.\nHave you checked the contents of /Developer/usr/bin to make sure Xcode installed the command line tools correctly?\nmac:~ me$ ls -1 /Developer/usr/bin/ | wc -l\n     167\n\nRerunning the latest Xcode installer (4.2 or later) should get the correct binaries in your path /usr/bin as well as the directory listed above with the whole assembly of tools needed for brew and make to work as expected in a traditional unix sense.\n", "Q: How can I connect to one server using two user names - at the same time? I am struggling to find a way to allow users to connect to two different shares on a server at the same time. It seems like it should be possible, but no matter what I try I am always forced to disconnect one user to connect as another.\nI have tried using aliases like this:\nafp://user1:password1@ServerName._afpovertcp._tcp.local\nafp://user2:password2@ServerName._afpovertcp._tcp.local\n\nThe first one connected works, and the second one ignores the name/password when connecting and just offers to connect as the first user again.\nIs there a user friendly way to make this work?\n\nA: I'm not entirely sure it would work, but try this, from Terminal:\nmkdir /Volumes/foo /Volumes/bar\nmount -t afp afp://foo:foopass@ServerName._afpovertcp._tcp.local /Volumes/foo\nmount -t afp afp://bar:barpass@ServerName._afpovertcp._tcp.local /Volumes/bar\n\n\nA: You can always cheat and use a different protocol for the second connection.  OS X works with SMB.\n", "Q: How do I downgrade Java on OSX 10.6.8? Software Update recently updated Java with update 6, for my 10.6.8 installation.

Thanks for any help!\n\nA: If anyone still cares about downgrading Java on Snow Leopard, the answer that advises removing Java manually and reinstalling from download or Snow Leopard DVD doesn't work for Snow Leopard, but it can be made to work.\nInstead of using the freestanding Java packages on the DVD, use the app Pacifist to open the main Snow Leopard installer .pkg.

I'm wondering if there's any way to enable more key combinations to be used for various actions than those we can use through the standing keyboard shortcuts preference page. For instance using left shift+right shift as a keyboard shortcut to change the input language, or using fn+s for grabbing a screenshot, etc.\nPerhaps there's some hack I can use, or an external tool, or just some hidden preference?\n\nA: QuickKeys allows you to record actions or define macros and assign them to keyboard shortcuts. I don't know if the Macintosh draws a distinction between Right Shift and Left Shift though.\n", "Q: How can I get multiple computers to use my iTunes library on an external hard drive? I have two Macs -- on usually at home and one carry around. I'd like to keep my music, movies, iPhone apps, etc. on an external drive so that I can always use the same library regardless of which machine I'm at.\nI bought a 1 TB external drive for the purpose.\nOn my first Mac (the one that stays at home one) I went to settings > advanced and set the iTunes library to the external drive. A long filesystem operation ensued. Afterwards, iTunes on that machine seemed to be playing TV shows from the external drive as intended because I could see the drive activity light flashing when I played something. Also, when I try to play something and the drive isn't connected iTunes complains that it can't find the original file. So I think that part is all good.\nHowever, when I plug the external drive into my other computer, launch iTunes, and go to Preferences > Advanced and set the iTunes media folder location to the external drive, none of my media is visible in iTunes.\nHow can I get iTunes to \"see\" the media folder on the external drive and play stuff from it and acknowledge the apps that are stored on it?\nMac OS 10.7.2\niTunes 10.5.2\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks.\n\nA: You're missing the \"Library\". The media folder contains the actual audio files, but you need a library pointing to it. The 1st approach is, move everything and make all the iTunes open the same library. \nWon't work because when Machine 1 opens the Library.xml, it locks it. Bummer. But turns out that there's a way to do it, if you're willing to involve Dropbox and some patience, check the link but for reference, the idea is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move your entire iTunes folder to your home network drive.\n\n*Copy the iTunes library (database file, XML files) to your Dropbox folder\n\n*Create an alias of the network drive’s iTunes Music folder and place it in your Dropbox folder. Be sure to rename it to iTunes Music (remove the word “alias”). Create an alias of the Album Artwork folder, too. If you skip this step, whenever you import music to your library, it will be copied to your Dropbox folder instead of your network drive. The aliases ensure iTunes places all new library items on the network drive.\n\n*On each Mac, configure iTunes to use the library file located in the Dropbox folder. Do this by holding option on your keyboard when clicking the iTunes icon in your dock. You will be prompted to choose an existing library or create a new one. Click “Choose Library” then navigate to your iTunes database file in your Dropbox folder.\n\n\nYou can now access your iTunes library on each Mac without using Home Sharing. iTunes will behave identically on each Mac; you can add music, edit playlists, and sync your iDevices without Apple’s usual restrictions.\nThere are a couple of Caveats and Gotchas, so check the link for more information.\nOr you could just do what I did… get iTunes Match and enjoy a simple easy to use environment. I am really happy the way it works, the caveat is, of course, you will be using bandwidth (or needing it) to stream/download a song. So if you have no connectivity, you can't listen (you can always have one or more machines with a copy of the songs, I have my \"master\" machine with the 90GBs of music locally, but the Macbook Air and iPhone 'stream' on demand). \nThe other caveat is that if you \"save\" local tracks (you can), then you're effectively duplicating your copy. But hey, you can remove/download as you please, as long as it's in the \"cloud\".\nFinally, iTunes Match is for music, so for videos and such, you will have to use Home Sharing (with the annoyance that it's \"read only\" for the connecting computers), but for music, you can buy/add from any authorized device… and you need to be in a country that supports it (and willing to pay 25 dollars/year). :p\n\nA: If you move the library files to your hard drive as well as the actual video and audio files to the hard drive you will be able to connect multiple computers to the library.  \nNote that you MUST tell the computer where the library files are located. To do this, you launch iTunes by holding alt while you click the icon. You will get a menu asking if you would like to Quit, Create, or Choose a library. Select Choose Library and the drive where you moved the files to. That's it.  \niTunes will recognize the library files and allow them to be used.  Note this does not allow more than 1 person to simultaneously use the files. For that, use Home Sharing.  But if you wanted to connect your 2nd Mac to the same library (for example a laptop that you use on the road), connect the drive and again launch iTunes with alt held down to select the library. \nI've been using this method for the past year without any problems, but note that if you don't allow the drive to be mounted before you try to use iTunes, it will try to create a new library on the local hard drive. But you can again bypass this by holding alt when you launch iTunes (so you could, for example, have a few movies on the local library and a 2nd library on the external drive with all your files).\n", "Q: Is there a shortcut which invokes the \"Login Window...\" fast user switching command? Firstly, let me say that there's two questions on Think Different that claim to answer this question but do not:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does the MacBook Air have a Fast User Switching (Login Window) shortcut key?\nThe answer to this question seems to \"lock\" the mac, but doesn't invoke the \"Login Window...\" command.\n\n*Can I assign a keyboard shortcut to bring up the Mac OS X Login Window?\nThe answer to this question provides a shortcut which initiates a log out, not a user fast switch.\n\n\nSo, is there a shortcut for this command?\nthanks.\n\nA: There is a fairly convenient, fully native way to do it, with only a small amount of setup. It's not a single keyboard shortcut, but it is a keyboard shortcut.\nSummary:\nPut fast user switching into the menu bar, then enable a keyboard shortcut to focus it.\nSteps:\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Users & Groups pane in System Preferences, then to the Login Options section. Choose to show the fast user switching menu (in any form).\n\n\n*Cmd-drag that new menu item as far left as possible. (This makes it the first to be selected by the keyboard shortcut, but really it can be placed anywhere.)\n\n\n*Go to the Keyboard pane in System Preferences, then to the Keyboard Shortcuts tab. Continue to the Keyboard & Text Input category, and choose a shortcut for the \"Move focus to status menus\" item.\nResult:\nIf you followed step 2, then pressing your keyboard shortcut will focus the fast user switching menu. You open the menu by pressing the down arrow, then select a choice with either enter or space.\nThis shortcut lets you directly select a user, so you can choose to bypass the login window or select it from the menu.\nI would recommend a shortcut of control + fn + enter, as this puts your fingers on the return key, and hence just above the arrow keys. Plus, I don't know of any other shortcuts it would collide with.\n\nA: Control+Shift+Eject\nor\nControl+Shift+power-button\nThe latter doesn't seem to work in Mac OS X 10.11(.6), but the former still works.\nTo guarantee that the login window is shown immediately after entering one of the above shortcuts, make sure to change the relevant security setting to require a password (i.e. require logging-in) immediately \"after sleep or screen saver begins\":\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter ⌘+space to open Spotlight search.\n\n*Type \"security\" and hit Enter when \"security & Privacy\" is suggested; the \"Security & Privacy\" settings should be shown.\n\n*Ensure you're on the \"General\" page.\n\n*Change the \"Require password ...\" setting to \"immediately\".\n\n\nSource for info about the password security setting:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to lock your Mac like you did on your PC - fixedByVonnie\n\nA: The short answer is no. OS X Lion doesn't have a way to assign a keyboard shortcut to Fast User Switching (which is going to the Login Window without logging off the current user).\nThere are, however, various alternatives to achieve that. You've pointed to different workarounds (I haven't tested those), I'll name a few more:\n\n\n*\n\n*What I use: Launchbar. Simply invoke it, type \"log..\" and you already have the option to press enter to go to the login window, can't get much faster than that (you could assign a shortcut to that if you wish).\n\n*Although I haven't used it in a while, the \"competitor\" Alfred + Powerpack had something similar, the command was \"lock\" as far as I can remember.\n\n*BetterTouchTool: recommended by other users (I've seen this app in friend's Macs but never used it myself). It will also do what you want (shortcut to go to the Login Screen). It's been also recommended in the answers you linked. I add it here for reference and because someone mentioned it in the comments by @Steven Fischer\n\n*Using pure Scripting like the one used here. Note however, that most of the scripts that you will find, will make you write and hardcode the account's password, which is not a good idea. But if you check there, there's an alternative that doesn't do that. I haven't tested that myself, but if that script works, assigning it to a keyboard shortcut via Automator/Service ought to be a simple task. This Super User answer better explains the process (thanks @andy)\nIn any case, there's no built in method by default, but as you can see, with some digging and/or third party, you can do it. Using something like Launchbar or Alfred is a good idea for other reasons anyway ;)\n\nA: There is a sleep command i Guess so. it's ctrl + shift + eject key. But you have to make sure in \"Prefernces>Security & privacy> Reuiquire Password\" is checked if you want password after sleep\n\nA: If you have the Alfred Powerpack, you could assign a shortcut to the Lock command (which logs out to the fast user switching screen):\n\nAnother option would be to save a shell script like this to ~/Library/Scripts/ and assign it a shortcut using FastScripts:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend\n\n\nA: Not at all a need to go through so many workarounds when simply the following key combination (as rightly mentioned by @daniel answered Feb 1st, 2014) does the needful:\n\nCtrl + Shift + Eject\n\nHowever, for some unknown reason, the same didn't work on my friend's Mac Mini. Even then, the following worked smoothly:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences\n\n*Security & Privacy\n\n*General\n\n*Require Password immediately after sleep or screen saver begins\nAfter this, either:\n\nEnable Screensaver after some time\n\nor, just like I did:\n\nSet \"Start Screen Saver\" as one of the screen \"Hot Corners\"\n\nNow I simply use a Hot Corner before leaving my desk to lock the system.\n\nPS: I guess, @daniel's answer should be marked/ticked as the correct one, as the current answer seems kinda redundant since new, relevant options negate the need for external tools. #JustSaying ;)\n", "Q: Floating row in Numbers for iPad Is there a way I can make a row float on top of everything else. So, no matter how many rows you add, the row will always be visible?\n\nA: Yes, you can make the header row(s) or column(s) float on top of everything else.\nTap the information button (the circled i) in the toolbar at the top of the screen. Under the \"Headers\" tab, select how many header rows or columns you would like, and set \"Freeze Rows\" to ON.\n", "Q: Transfer values between tabs in Numbers for iPad I have two tabs in one spreadsheet in my Numbers for iPad. Is there a way I can transfer a value between those tabs?\n\nA: There are two ways, depending on what you want to do.\nIf you just want to copy the current value or formula, make sure you are not in edit mode (i.e. there should be no keyboard or number pad visible). Click once on the cell you want to copy, pause so it doesn't think you are double tapping, and then tap again. A popover menu should appear. Click copy and then go to the other tab. Select the cell where you want to paste and repeat the \"slow motion double tap.\" Then click paste.\nIf you want a cell to reference a cell from another tab you can do this to. Start by (quickly) double tapping the empty cell where you want the value from the other tab to appear. This should put you into edit mode. Push the equal sign button. Now navigate to the other tab and select the cell with the value you want to reference. Tap the cell once, and push the green check mark.\n", "Q: why cant i update my ipod 4g to IOS 5? I keep trying to update my iPod to iOS 5, and it keeps telling me I don't have enough free space on my computer. I put basically everything from my computer onto my external hard drive, I also tried moving everything in iTunes to a media folder. I also dont understand why it isn't updating and saving from my iPod. It's saying I dont have enough memory to update my iPod and keep the media that's on it. \nHow do I update my iPod and still keep everything that's on it, and how do I move everything in iTunes onto my external hard drive?\n\nA: It sounds like part of the problem here is that your iPod is out of free space. Major iOS versions require more space than the previous version. My advice would be to free an additional 1GB of space on your iPod before attempting the update. Perhaps you have a movie, large game, or other data that you can temporarily remove from the iPod to ensure enough free space for the OS update.\n", "Q: Poor battery performance after SSD install I recently installed a Crucial SSD into my Macbook Pro (2.66 GHz Intel Core i7), and now the performance of my battery is probably about 50% of what it used to be.  \nI've tried to reset the PRAM, but the OS loads so quickly that it I've never been able to trigger, even though I'm quick with hitting the keys. \nAny suggestions for improving performance, and/or resetting the PRAM?\nThanks\n\nA: Modern Macintosh computers store very little information in PRAM so resetting it is seldom a useful troubleshooting step.\nHave you checked the condition of the battery using System Information? (It's in the Utilities folder and also accessible from the menu: [Apple] > About this Mac > More Info… > System Report —assuming you're running Lion) \nIf you're seeing Service Battery under the Hardware > Power:Battery Information/Health Information section that's probably your issue.\n\nYou might improve the battery life with a System Mangement Controller reset. Assuming your MacBook Pro doesn't have a removable battery, the SMC reset procedure is:\n\nShut down the computer. Plug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power\n  source, connecting it to the Mac if its not already connected. On the\n  built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and\n  the power button at the same time. Release all the keys and the power\n  button at the same time. Press the power button to turn on the\n  computer.   Note: The LED on the MagSafe power adapter may change\n  states or temporarily turn off when you reset the SMC.\n\n\nA: Any electric device that has a rechargeable battery will face the same issue if you overcharge the device. If you overcharge, you'll short the life of the battery and if you leave it charged for too long it might cause a fire. \nI recommend you charge any electric device that has rechargeable battery to 95-98% and unplug it. In general, rechargeable battery life will decrease but if overcharge, you help short the life faster. To avoid replacing the battery within a year or so, charge to 90-98% and unplug. \nAlso do not use your device or put it in a hot area. If your device becomes too hot put it away to cool it off. Heat decreases your device's battery life. If you want to charge the battery the whole time, you must remove the battery to avoid overcharge. However, most Apple laptops do not have removable battery so you're better off by unplugging it between 95-98%.\n\nA: To reset PRAM you need to press and hold cmd+optn/alt+p+r right after pressing power button and wait till it restarts with startup chime.\nThis shortcut triggers PRAM reset during POST procedure. It doesn't matter how fast or slow your disk is because it happens before any disk activity at all. Try press the combination after you send system to reboot from booted state.\n", "Q: Purchasing music with two Apple accounts I purchased some music from iTunes some time ago but recently made a new Apple account when I bought an iPod Touch 4Gen. Now the music purchased on the old account will not play on the iPod set up with the new account. Any idea why? Is this because of some type of permissions issue? \n\nA: Yes. The music is assigned to the old account. In order to play that music you will have to sign into your iPod with your old accounts credentials. There may be a way to merge accounts but I am unaware of that. Apple does this to ensure everyone on different accounts actually has to purchase music separately hence more profit for Apple. \n", "Q: Cannot Unmount Mac OS X Base System Disk My Mac running Lion was being slow, so I was decided to reinstall OS X. I don't have any Time Machine backups.\nEverything went file, but in the middle of the installation, it got stuck, and later the installation failed without any reason. So, I tried to reboot again, but it said that the reinstallation failed and asked me to reinstall again. I tried to reinstall, but nothing came up.\nSo I tried to use Disk Utility to erase the startup disk and make a new partition. But, when trying to partition, Disk Utility said that it cannot unmount the disk. In Disk Utility, I found another disk called disk2 and Mac OS X Base System. As far as I know,  I didn't see that disk2 in my disk list before.\nI tried to unmount it or erase that disk2, but it won't let me. So I tried using Terminal to force unmount that disk, but still it doesn't let me.\nIs that disk2 the reason why I cannot partition my main HD? How can I unmount or erase that disk2 Mac OS X Base system ? \nI would like to clean install OS X lion again. I already have a boot image on my USB drive. I just cannot start it because the installation fails and something is still running, I guess.\nScreenshot of Disk Utility:\n\n\nA: The Mac OS X base system image is not the cause of your problem. See What is the 'Mac OS X Base System' disk image on my 2011 MacBook AIr? for an explanation.\nMy best guess, based on the screenshot, as to why you can't repartition the Hitachi disk is that it's the current startup device. You need to restart your computer from an an external device—preferably a device that has the Lion Installer on it-if you want to reformat the drive. Otherwise, assuming you have a valid recovery partition, you can erase the Mac partition itself and reinstall Lion without an external device.\nPerhaps Apple's Mac OS X 10.7 Help: Recover your entire system document will help you. \n\nA: I think you need to reset your PRAM (for older Mac computers) or NVRAM (for newer Mac computers):\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1379\n\nResetting PRAM or NVRAM\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the computer.\n\n*Locate the following keys on the keyboard: Command(⌘), Option, P, and R. You will need to hold these keys down simultaneously in step 4.\n\n*Turn on the computer.\n\n*Press and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys. You must press this key combination before the gray screen appears.\n\n*Hold the keys down until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for the second time.\n\n*Release the keys.\n\n\nThis should get rid of the \"Mac OS X Base System\" virtual mount, and allow you to clean install from your Lion USB drive\n", "Q: Warn if a Time Machine backup is still in progress before shutting down or sleeping a Mac Before I shut down or sleep my Mac, I want to be warned if a Time Machine backup is still in progress.\nIs there such a thing?  Or at least something that makes it very obvious that a backup is in progress, so that I avoid shutting down the machine before it is finished?\nRight now the only visible sign that a backup is in progress is the little spinning circle up in the \"task-bar\", it's very easy to miss.\n\nI searched but could not find a solution for this.\n\nA: You've asked what you want, but not why you want it.  I am guessing that this is a preconception that you think it needs to complete in order to be successful.  Time Machine isn't just a standard \"backup job\" that will create individual backups that depend on the success of each backup, it's more a permanent process.\nEffectively each time you change a file, whether by addition or alteration of the contents or metadata, it gets added to the list of files that need to be backed up.  The list grows and grows all the time, and it's built into the actions of the filesystem that whenever it makes a change, it also adds the file to the list.  Every hour (or whatever you have set if you are using a non-standard config), Time Machine will start at the beginning of this list of changes, and start to plough through them and copy the changes to the backup disk.  At the end of the process, when there are no more files to include in the backup, it stops.\nBut there is no need to wait for it to stop.  If you have say 100 files in the queue, and it only processes 45.5 of them when you shut the machine down, the completed files are removed from the list only after Time Machine confirms they were completely backed up -- any partly-completed files will not be flagged as complete. Then, next time you boot up, wait another hour, the process will start again.  You will have the 55 files that were not transferred last time at the front of the queue, followed by any other changes that have been made in the first place.\nSo, in summary, unlike a traditional backup which requires completion to ensure validity, the Time Machine backup is an ongoing process that can be interrupted at any time, and you do not have to wait for it to finish before shutting down.  Indeed, if you are doing something disk intensive, feel free to temporarily turn Time Machine off or interrupt a backup that is in progress while you do stuff, then when you turn it back on it will just pick up where it left off. \n\nA: Time Machine is effectively a backup program. The program is a daemon called \"backupd\" that runs via an automated system job controlled by launchd.\nWhen time machine is active there is an active \"backupd\" process running. Once the Time Machine process finishes, backupd needs a few minutes to close down and quit.\nAs for shutdown/logout, it's easy to write a script/program to check for the running process and throw up a warning.\nPre-sleep this is a little more difficult because there really isn't a simple sleep intercept like \"Logout items\"\nFor further information on the backupd task: Adjusting the Time Machine Backup Interval\n", "Q: How do I stop Safari from occasionally downloading \"mlingos9.html\"? When I'm browsing with Safari, a download of a file called \"mlingos9.html\" is started on some sites and I end up with several of these in my download folder. How do I stop Safari from doing this?\n\nA: It's a problem with a specific web page — this one.\nIt specifies the content type application/octet-stream in the HTTP response headers, which is usually used for files meant to be downloaded — and that's what your web browser does. HTML web pages usually use text/html or similar HTTP headers, never application/octet-stream.\nIf you were browsing web sites with similar topics that might link to this web page, and you clicked a link, or the web page was included in another web page using a frame/iframe, that's the cause for the downloads.\n\nA: I'm the owner of that page.  Strangely I have no problems seeing it myself.  I am contacting Apple to ask them to fix the header sent by the server.\nPS It turns out I was able to fix the problem by replacing that page with a local copy.  Something about the one on the server was causing it (and only it) to be served as an application.  I have no idea what could have caused that or how the copy of the file on the server got that way.  If anyone else does, I'd be interested to hear it.\n", "Q: How can I create a folder named like the current date in bash So I'm messing around in my .bashrc making different aliases and playing with my prompt. I'm trying now to make an alias that will move into a specific directory, make a new directory based on the date, and make a new file. All in one alias. Here's what I've done...\nexport DATE=\"$( date +%d-%b )\"\nalias hw='cd ~/Java/Homework/257; mkdir $DATE; cd $DATE; vim'\n\nNow if I go out and run hw Client.java it should move into ~/Java/Homework/257/27-Jan/ and open a new file called Client.java in vim. It all works beautifully except the date variable doesn't work right. It moves me into the ~/Java/Homework/257 directory and makes two directories. One called date and another called +%d-%b and puts the Client.java file in the date directory.\nI thought my date variable export simply wasn't working but when I type $DATE at the command prompt it gives me 27-Jan like it should. So does anyone know what could actually be causing this? A friend of mine did something very simliar to this using a slightly different format string for the date and his works just fine. The only thing I have different on my computer is bash-completion from homebrew but I don't see how that would effect my date...\n\nA: export DATE=\"$( date +%d-%b )\"\n\nYou need to actually execute it. Otherwise you just assign a string value. Since you're missing quotes around the $DATE, it will be interpreted as two separate arguments, date and +%d-%b.\n\nA: Try to define go as a function in .bashrc or .alias:\ngo() {\n    DATE=$(date +%d-%b)\n    mkdir \"$DATE\"\n    cd \"$DATE\"\n    vim \"$1\"\n}\n\nThis ensures that the date is determined every time you use the command and not just when you login/start bash. \n\nA: Along the lines of the other answers: you need to execute the date command.  Probably the simplest solution would be to change your quotes to back ticks:\nexport DATE=`date +%d-%b`\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to time adjust push mail on iOS 5? Is it possible to time adjust push mail on my iPhone? What I want is that the phone automatically adjust the push setting for some time slots a day. E.g. that it should push mail between 9-17, but after 17 it should not push mail for an account. Is there an app for that? \n\nA: There is no simple app for this in the default Mail app as unfortunately there is no way for an app to change this setting. You either have to accept notifications all of the time, or manually turn them on/off in the Settings app every time you want to change them as @afragen said.\nThere may be other email apps that will provide this functionality, but I've not come across any.\n\nA: This isn't currently an option, but in iOS 6, Notifications will have a \"Do Not Disturb\" feature, so you can mute them at certain hours of the day. It won't stop your phone from receiving mail, but the alerts won't bother you.\n\nA: Turn off Notifications from the Settings > Notifications tab. Search for Mail and turn off all notification settings.\nIf you also want you might need to go to Settings > General > Sounds and turn off the New Mail sound.\n\nA: It might be possible to set your home WiFi router to disable internet access in general or for a specific device or specific service (like Mail) during certain hours. This would normally be under a Parental Controls section of the router setup.\n", "Q: How can I keep a clone of a folder? I have a folder with Docs in on a Time Capsule, I would also like this same folder to be in Documents on Mac.\nI want both to update whenever a file is changed or added.\nDo you know of an automate command or a piece of software that will do this without me having to initiate it manually.\n\nA: I Just found SynkPro with a google. Not used it but it says it can \"sync your home and work computers—even if they're not connected—by syncing them both with an external hard drive serving as a \"shuttle\" for your data.\"\n\nA: There are two options for you. First is a paid app such as Folder Watch (App Store link) that offers a simple GUI to select folders to keep in sync.\nThe second option would be to set up an Automator workflow that executes the following rsync command:\nrsync -va --delete \"$source/\" \"$target/\"\n\n(Where $source and $target are paths to the folders you wish to keep in sync.)\n\nA: If you are using Mac OS X 10.7.2+ (Lion) on a Mac, you can try using iCloud.\nSet up both machines with the same iCloud account, and ensure that \"Documents & Data\" is checked in:\nSystem Preferences > iCloud > [√] Documents & Data.\n\nNavigate to \"~/Library/Mobile Documents\" and create an alias of this folder on your desktop on both machines.\nAny item placed into that folder should appear on the other within a few seconds.\nBare in mind, this solution is officially unsupported, and as far as I know uses your WAN connection to sync rather than do so locally. Also, it is most likely subject to the space limitations of your iCloud account, so going with something like Dropbox or Synk may be a more suitable solution in the short term.\n\nA: To sync both ways, and without using Internet storage clients like Drop box, I recommend using Chronosync.  It's not the cheapest, but it's massively flexible.  You set up a source and a destination, and provide configurable options for when and how to sync.  You can sync both ways, sync but archive any files that are deleted, sync one way, sync when a machine logs into the same LAN, sync on a timed schedule, perform trial syncs to check what will change, filter against files within the sync area etc etc.  I'm not affiliated with them in any way, but I use it to maintain 2 home directories on seperate Macs.\nIf you want to sync one way, you can use Folder Actions to make a copy for added files, but I don't think it will cater for file modification.\nYou say the folder is on your time machine drive, but you don't say how you connect to this drive (USB/Wireless etc) - you need to ensure that the drive that the folder is mountable on in available when performing a sync, whatever method you use.\n\nA: If you are willing to switch \"Time Capsule\" for \"some service in the cloud\" this is exactly what Dropbox does really really well :) \n", "Q: Printing to HP DesignJet 4000, no official or open source drivers? I want to use an HP DesignJet 4000 (Not the PS version). I don't find the way to print on that device because it prints the actual postcript code instead of the image or text itself. Is there a way to send \"raw\" or bitmap file to the printer ?\n\nA: There is not a supported driver from HP, only for the PostScript model.\nI have had the same issue in the past with a non-PS LaserJet 5, and I now use the 'Generic PCL driver' for mine.\nThe Gutenprint drivers currently do not have a version for your printer, although you may find some success using a similar model with a driver.\n\nA: The DesignJet 4000 is not supported by any of the open-source printer drivers for other HP printers.  The problem is that the non-PostScript version, unlike most inexpensive laser printers, does not speak HP PCL (Printer Control Language).\nThere are two problems with trying to print to the DesignJet from a Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do you get it networked so the Mac can see it?  If it's got an Ethernet port and an IP address, that part is easy (and if it isn't that's a separate question).  This page at HP's support site says that there is an embedded webserver in the printer you can upload files to.  Alternatively, OS X versions at least since Snow Leopard can print to Windows shared (SMB) printers, which is easy to set up--here is an explanation of how to print to an SMB printer on OS X.\n\n*How do you produce documents on the Mac in a format that the printer can understand?  As you've noted sending PostScript to a non-PostScript printer just prints the raw code, which is interesting but not useful for present purposes.  There's a list of file formats supported by the DesignJet 4000 at the HP link above.  First on this list is HPGL, the language used to make huge drawings on HP pen plotters back in the Dark Ages before large-format inkjets.  Assuming you are trying to print a PostScript file, you just need a PS-to-HPGL converter.  This page has a somewhat out-of-date list of graphics conversion software that can handle PS files, many of which are commercial but some of which are free. (Also, notably, the HPGL Viewer from CERN listed there looks like an excellent tool for manipulating HPGL files directly.)\nSince the list from HP in item 1 above also says that the DesignJet 4000 can accept JPG, TIFF, and other bitmap file formats,  I would first try the simple and free solution of using ImageMagick to convert the PostScript files to TIFF and then uploading the TIFF files to the printer.  If that doesn't produce acceptable output quality, look into one of the vector-to-vector conversion formats.  \n", "Q: What's the best way to transfer ALAC files between computers when subscribed to iTunes Match? I've pretty much uploaded everything to iTunes Match now, but my collection is across two computers and so it has merged everything together... Which is fine. However, I was planning on moving some of my items from one computer to another (i.e. from my smaller iTunes Library on the MacBook to the main iTunes Library on my PM G5).\nSince it is all nicely synced now, I've discovered that if I use Home Sharing, then transferring the files manually seems to duplicate them on iTunes Match. So instead of doing this, I'm downloading them from the cloud on my PM and then deleting them on the MacBook once they're done... All good so far. However, a bunch of my music is in ALAC and so I don't want to do it this way because I'll end up downloading the files at 256kbps AAC instead.\nSo I just wanted to know, is there a good way of getting already-synced ALAC files from one machine to the other without having to get iTunes Match to re-sync them all over again?\n\nA: *\n\n*Turn off iTunes Match on the PowerMac.\n\n*Use Home Sharing to move the ALAC files to the PowerMac.\n\n*Re-enable iTunes Match on the PowerMac.  It should re-scan the library and match the ALAC songs.  \n\n*Don't ever delete the ALAC songs from the PowerMac, otherwise your only choice will be to download a 256Kbps file from the cloud.\n\n", "Q: Transfer of Snow Leopard license from broken MacBook Pro I use a Mac Pro with Lion installed and I own a broken MacBook Pro with Snow Leopard on it. Am I allowed to install Snow Leopard on the Mac Pro in parallel to Lion? The MacBook Pro is totally dead and useless.\n\nA: If it is a retail copy of Snow Leopard, then yes. If it is a machine copy, then probably not.\nIt's unlikely you'll have any problems installing it from a licensing perspective, there is no serialisation in Snow Leopard. You may run into strange problems down to the incorrect build of 10.6 for the hardware though as discs that come with machines are machine specific.\nSnow Leopard is cheap though, you should buy it if you think you need to!\n", "Q: Will installing Lion on a MacBook 5,2 improve performance? Will Installing Lion on a MacBook5,2 with 4GB or ram, currently running Snow Leopard, improve or decrease its performance?\n\nA: I was going to add only a comment, but it was too long. The truth is that Speed/Performance is almost always relative when the difference is not too big. The question is, would Lion be a better option for you? I certainly find some of the Lion \"new features\" almost a must-have for my daily workflow. The overall OS improvement makes it better for me.\nThe truth is, that the first releases have proven to be more disk intensive/CPU intensive in a few tasks, presumably because there are more services (autosave, resume, etc.) running in the background. This alone may be the culprit of most of its \"performance\" problems. It has slightly improved, but I've seen very fast Snow Leopard installs. To be fair, SL have had a few point releases already, and Lion only 2, so one can assume that it will get faster over time as things are optimized (at least this is what has been happening with Apple for the past eight years). \nAll in all, evaluate wether you find Lion a good addition to your OS rather than the raw performance. Some people really like the SL \"Spaces\", Dashboard, Exposé, etc. on the other hand, Launchbar, Mission Control, AutoSave, etc. are features that some people hate, and most of the time, there's no way to revert to the \"previous\" behavior. \nIn the end, you get used to it, but it takes some time. \n\nA: Many have tried to do some benchmarking see e.g.\nhttp://www.anandtech.com/show/4485/back-to-the-mac-os-x-107-lion-review/23\nhttp://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20081987-1/snow-leopard-vs-lion-performance-head-to-head/\nhttp://lifehacker.com/5822435/lion-vs-snow-leopard-which-is-faster\nand looks like differences are small. One remarkable exception is FileVault 2\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2011/08/10/filevault-2-benchmarks-disk-encryption-faster-mac-os-x-lion/\nIn my (not very extensive) experience with Lion I noted no difference (but Lion is definitely more buggy and less dependable than Snow Leopard)\n\nA: I don't have figures to back it up, but my impression is that Lion doesn't do anything faster (on my 8GB MacBookPro6,2) than Snow Leopard did, and it does some things slower and/or requires more memory to do them. From a recent straw poll around my workplace, most of the other upgraders there are in general agreement.\n", "Q: how do I disable preview autosave? Today I was scrolling through my photography gallery with Preview app. I was playing around with files rotating them etc, only to discover that it was actually saving those files (overwriting originals) without giving me a notice!\nIs there any way to make it ask me for changes everytime? not only when file is locked... \n\nA: Are you using Lion?  If you are, you can check your versions by clicking the file title on the top of the window, then select Browser all Versions to revert back to the previous save.\n\nA: This looks like it might provide a decent solution: How to Install the Older Preview App from Snow Leopard in Mac OS X Lion.\n", "Q: How to identify explicitly saved versions when reverting a document? I suspect I know the answer to this, but...\nIn 10.7, versions of a document are saved automatically. You can also explicitly save a version by selecting \"Save a Version\".\nWhen I wish to revert to a previous version, in the Time Machine-like display that appears, there seems to be no way to identify which versions it's showing me were saved automatically by the system, and which were (what I consider to be) the \"milestone\" versions that I saved explicitly.\nAm I missing something? I know you're given the opportunity to revert to the last-saved version when you select File->Revert, but what if I just want to look at that version first, or revert to the last-but-one saved version?\n\nA: You can't.\nKeep doing the manual versioning series that you should always have been doing. At each milestone save a new copy with a new file title that describes what it is.\nAll that's new with a Lion Autosave/Versions app is that you'll have to suffer horrifically each time you do so.\n\n\n*\n\n*Start with your working document, save it as \"MyReport - workingcopy\".\n\n*When you want to save your manual milestone version, first press CMD-S to \"Save a Version\" (or you may get a dialogue about reverting to a previous version).\n\n*Then select File / Duplicate , which will pop up a second window of your open document (not prompt you to save a copy to disk).\n\n*The new window will be titled \"MyReport - workingcopy copy\". This is very confusingly a tentative filename only that doesn't actually exist as a (user accessible) file on your drive yet.\n\n*Now press CMD-S to save that open duplicated document window. This will give you the normal file save dialogue where you can rename it \"MyReport - Milestone 1\".\n\n*Now CLOSE THAT NEW DOCUMENT \"MyReport - Milestone 1\" and go back to working on the previous document \"MyReport - workingcopy\" -- leaving your new milestone file safe (for now) in its saved state.\nIf you've cleverly thought of going to System Preferences / Keyboards to create a CMD-D keyboard shortcut for that Duplicate command, TextEdit at least will completely ignore it. \nThe shortcut will not appear in the File menu next to the Duplicate menu item.

I put a disc in it recently, and it failed to do anything other than make odd noises then eject it.  Then on certain discs it would make an awful grinding noise repeatedly like a circular saw, then eject the disc (no apparent damage to it).  Then it took a disc in, buzzed a bit, and the drive just dissappeared, even system report couldn't see the hardware, never mind the disc inside.\nI reboot holding option down allowed me to software eject, and since then I can repeat the above behaviour until the system seemingly abandons it.\nFrankly, I always thought it was a bit dodgy (I bought it 2nd hand), as it was really SLOW to install the OS from and rip CDs etc compared to a cheap USB one I have.\nSo, the question is, how do I replace it, and what should I replace it with?  I'm happy to use a non apple part, so long as I can still use it in the same way without it complaining about being incompatible in iMovie/iDVD etc.\nI know I can go external, and indeed have 2 external drives, but I don't like the clutter, and it seems that DVD player won't touch them anyway:\n\n\nA: Getting the glass and LCD panel off without snapping cables is tougher than you may think, my recommendation would be to have it repaired by a professional. I'm not sure how much prices vary around the world but we would charge around £90 for the part and £40 for labour (if it's an optical drive) plus taxes. As things go, it's not an expensive repair.\nIf you're hell-bent on DIY then I'm sure there are places out there you can get parts and manuals/take apart guides. It may end up more expensive if you damage anything yourself, and of course there's no warranty on the repair!\nThe other option would be to use an external drive. There are loads of options out there at varying price points.\n\nA: IMHO best (well cheapest if you already have another networked PC with an optical drive) Superdrive replacement is remote disk hack. In Terminal \ndefaults write com.apple.NetworkBrowser EnableODiskBrowsing -bool true\ndefaults write com.apple.NetworkBrowser ODSSupported -bool true\n\nAnd then read this instruction from apple.\n", "Q: What's the Mac equivalent for CTR+ALT+Backspace on Linux? I need to regularly shutdown brutally my Mac, due to program misbehavior (Starcraft 2 and EVE Online), which take control of the graphics and never surrender it back. \nWhile I admire the tenacity of those embattled programs... I'd rather nuke them with a single stroke, as I would on Linux by killing the X server.\nThe irritating part is, the underlying OS runs fine, since I can move the mouse around, change luminosity or sound. I just can't switch back to anything, work, email... so I have to fully reboot.\nHow do I do that? What's the secret key combo?\n\nA: Command ⌘  + Option + Esc opens the \"Force Quit Application\" \ndialog, which lets you select and kill running applications. \nIf that does not work, \nCommand ⌘ + Option + Shift + Esc held down for 5 seconds kills the foremost application.\n", "Q: How can I setup different \"environments\" I want to create different environments on my mac, for example work 1, work 2, and at home. The environments have different icons in the doc, different desktop background images etc. Is that possible? I do not want to create different users, because some files are used in every environment.\n\nA: In \"Computer -> Users\" there's a folder called \"Shared Folders\". You can put shared files for all users in there (including the iTunes library etc.). With fast user switching enabled it's very easy to handle multiple environments.\n\nA: There is an application Dockspaces that allows you to switch between different sets of applications in your dock (and I think different desktops but I don't use the desktop at all so I don't know if this does what you want)\n\nA: I've never had a change to try the app in Mark's answer, but it seems like it is a great solution to one of your requirements. These two might also help you get the setup you are looking for:\n 1. ControlPlane (http://www.controlplaneapp.com)\nControlPlane allows you to build configuration profiles, contexts in ControlPlane lingo, for your Mac based on where you are or what you are doing.  ControlPlane determines where you are or what you are doing based on a number of available evidence sources and then automatically reconfigures your Mac based on your preferences.\n 2. Foreman (http://www.flyingmachinestudios.com/foreman)\nYou define app groups by dragging apps from the Finder into the space that says \"Drag Apps Here To Create New Group\".\nClick a group to hide all applications which aren't in that group; shift+click to close apps instead of hiding them. Foreman also opens all the apps in the group that aren't already open.\n", "Q: Install Snow Leopard Server I'm considering buying Snow Leopard Server, however, the person I'm buying it from will be providing me with the server discs that came with his Mac Mini Server and a serial number. If I have an iMac already running Snow Leopard, will I still be able to take the server discs included with the Mini and install server on top? Are the discs compatible with the iMac? Thanks.\n\nA: Unfortunately, the disks that come with a Mac are Mac-specfic. They have special drivers for the machine they came with, and usually don't include drivers for other machines. The serial number he's providing you with should still work with no issues, but the disks themselves will probably not work. I would suggest getting the Snow Leopard Server disks from another source and using the serial number you're buying. \nAs for installing Server on top of the existing OS, this shouldn't be an issue. I would still recommend having a backup, but it shouldn't erase any data.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I realize this post is old, but a search for Snow Leopard Server brings this up first. \nI just bought SLS from Apple. It'snot listed on the web site. I called Apple and the agent didn't find it. I told her the part number is MC588Z/A and it came up for her. If by chance someone is in the same situation looking for SL server, I hope this helps.  \n", "Q: Can a Netgear ReadyNAS be used as a Time Machine Backup Destination? We have a NAS (a Netgear ReadyNAS NV+) in our office with tons of free space that we'd like to connect to our Mac Mini Server, mount as a disk and then use as a Time Machine Backup Destination. \nThis way the clients back up to the Mac Mini, while the data is actually saved to the NAS behind the scenes.\nProblem is that I can't figure out how to make Server.app show anything other than the two built in drives. \nI've tried mounting a share from the NAS with both SMB and AFP (it shows up fine in Finder). Maybe there's a way to use a \"local\" destination and NFS that directory? \nOr is this not even possible? \n\nA: To use the Time Machine Server function in Lion Server, you'll need to use a built in drive. As long as the NAS is able to be seen on your network, you should be able to use it as a Time Machine backup destination on each client Mac. While you won't be able to configure this for all machines at once in WorkGroup Manager, you should still be able to set up each client Mac to back up to the NAS. \n\nA: I believe the readynas comes with its own built in time machine software.\nhttp://www.readynas.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/ReadyNAS_Comparison_Home.pdf\ninstructions can be found here but as I don't have a net gear (mines an LG) I haven't been able to test them.\nhttp://www.readynas.com/?p=1097\n", "Q: To have TV Out from iPad 2's any application via Apple Composite AV Cable I know about this previous thread asking about iPad TV out. I have not managed to have my iPad 2's screen mirror from all applications to my TV. It only shows YouTube at the moment from the YouTube application.\nI want to mirror my iPad 2's screen on my TV. How can I accomplish this?\n\nA: From what I can discern from question, you are actually looking for Video Mirroring, not Video out.  They are two distinct features, using different API's.  \nVideo Mirroring, i.e. everything that you see on your iPad screen, from home screen to various apps, is only available via Airplay, using an Apple TV, or using Apples Digital AV Adapter(HDMI) or VGA Adapter.\nVideo Out, which is what it sounds like you are currently using, is available with Apples Composite and Component AV Adaptors, and provides an output link for applications that are specifically outputting a video source, such as the Videos App, or YouTube.  This would be why you can see YouTube Video's in YouTube, but not say when they are embedded in Safari.\nYou should also know, even Mirroring doesn't work for all Apps as you would expect.  HBO Go for example, actively disables Video Mirroring and only supports Audio, so when you hook the iPad to your TV, all you see is and HBO Go Logo on your TV Screen.  There is currently no official way around these restrictions.\n", "Q: How do I remove video noise & grain in iMovie '11? I'm attempting to remove some video noise/grain in iMovie 11 taken in low-light but haven't found a way to do this within iMovie itself. I've looked for plugins but the only ones I've found don't have free trials and I don't trust paying for software if I can't be assured it will work.\nIs there a way to remove video noise/grain in iMovie?\n\nA: Unfortunately iMovie doesn't take plugins. \nBest bet is external software OR Final Cut Pro 7 has numerous plugins that reduce noise and grain, but they are all very expensive.\n", "Q: Where do I go to download the correct software to do an untethered jailbreak on 4.2.6? I have already jailbroken my iPhone 4 with redsn0w using iPhone3,3_4.2.6_8E200_Restore.ipsw but my mom is making me sell my laptop and I need to find a way to make my jailbreak untethered. \nIs this possible?\n\nA: Better option if your iPhone 4 is not unlocked would be to update to 5.0.1 and then jailbreak it.  There are untethered jailbreaks available for this firmware. This would give you the benefits and new features of ios5. \n\nA: http://www.ijailbreak.com/?p=32039\nTry that link, i don't know if the other links are dead but give it a shot.\n\nA: Personally I'd restore to non-broken and then re-jailbreak. I've found lifehacker a pretty good source for jail-breaking instructions (http://lifehacker.com/5771943/the-always-up+to+date-guide-to-jailbreaking-your-iphone-ipod-touch-and-ipad-%5Bios-433%5D) - and they were great for jailbreaking my iPhone 4 to untethered. \n", "Q: 'script' command in terminal, looking for a flush open When I use 'script' on a unix terminal the -f option flushes the data straight to the file - from the man page \"-f      Flush output after each write. This is nice for telecooperation: One person does mkfifo foo; script -f foo' and another can\n             supervise real-time what is being done usingcat foo'.\" \nThis is a really handy option for me - but the version of the script command on my mac appears to be lacking this option. Are there any ways I can achieve the functionality? \n\nA: You can achieve more or less the same result by running\nscript -t 0\n\nFrom the man page:\n-t time  Specify time interval between flushing script output file.\n         A value of 0 causes script to flush for every\n         character I/O event.

Since iOS5, when I want to find out how much space I have left on my iPhone I go to\n\nSettings > General > Usage\n\n \nWhere can I find out how much space is being used by the Camera Roll?\n\nA: For whatever reason, iOS doesn't break out the size of the Camera Roll as well as other data that is potentially in the cloud like mail, contacts, calendars and photos and videos in the camera app. \nIf you absolutely must see the size of your Camera Roll without the help of a Mac or PC, you can measure it indirectly by turning on iCloud backup and seeing the space that did/will take on the last/next backup.\nOpen the Settings app and go to:\niCloud > Storage & Backup > Manage Storage\n\n\n", "Q: How do I copy a user profile between Macs? I have an Mac Pro running Lion, my wife has a Macbook Air also running Lion.\nWe have the same apps installed.\nI want to steal my wife's Macbook while I'm out of town on business.\nTo do so, I'll have to bribe her, but I'll also need to give her a seamless experience using the Mac Pro for the week.\nHow can I easily copy her profile, including all settings, mail, and documents, over to my Mac Pro so she can use it, and then send it all back to her Macbook when I get back?\nI know there's a migration wizard, but neither of these is a new machine, and I only want to copy one profile (hers).\n\nA: Run migration assistant on both Macs. If you can update each to the latest patch for your version of OS, that often is good but remember you have to always move data to a same or newer OS this manner. Moving data from a newer system to an older one is not supported.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204350\nIt will let you bring over one user account with ease. Her password and desktop and settings and preferences will all be preserved to the maximum extent possible. If both macs are the same version of the OS - it's even very easy to delete (back up) the older user and move the newer one back when the portable returns from its trip.\n\nA: Use iBackup to create the backup containing the user's data and any third-party app's data as well, and then restore it to your wife's laptop using the related feature.\nYou can directly create the backup to an external hard drive, so you can move the data to the laptop really fast.\n", "Q: How can I revert to Snow Leopard? Lion is crashing on me all the time and I am sick of it.  I would like to do a clean install of Snow Leopard, but when I insert the dvd and hold 'c' on boot the computer just locks up and I have to do a hard reset.\nWhat do I have to do?\n\nA: The issue is likely due to the fact that the build of Snow Leopard you're using is incorrect and thus does not have the necessary drivers for your iMac. If it's a Mid 2011 or even Mid 2010 model, the reference release of Snow Leopard (10.6.3) was release before these models and does not have what is needed to use the hardware in your iMac.\nIf your iMac was purchased before or on Lion launch day, it should have come with some gray disks that will have the correct build of Snow Leopard on them. If you purchased your machine a few weeks after Lion launch, you may not have these disks. \nIf you don't' have these disks, I would suggest making an appointment at your local Genius Bar. Both Apple Stores I worked in always had reference releases of all major OS releases within the past 5 years, including a universal Snow Leopard build. They should be able to do a quick NetRestore and downgrade you to Snow Leopard (you will lost all files if they do it this way, so have a good backup!).\nHope this helps...good luck.\n\nA: I had a client awhile ago wanting to return to 10.6 from 10.7. It is a BIG problem. Best is to use time machine, but in his case, NO BACKUP. Suggestion is to back up what you think you need - safari bookmarks.plist, documents, etc. Then re-install the OS after re-partitioning and start over. Even migration asst won't perform correctly. I had AppleCare on the phone and didn't have any better info than to re-format and start over.\n", "Q: What apps for OS X exists to ease the writing of emoticons? I want an application like TextPics on iOS, but for use in OS X. I want to use it with chat programs, web sites (twitter, facebook, et al), etc.\n\nA: Emoji is the one that's gained the most notoriety.\n\nA: Currently the application that I'm using is Crazy Text it lacks the ascii emoticons, but so far is the better one that has the TextPics capabilities on OS X\n", "Q: Include additional data into iPhone backup files I have two iPhone backups available, one recent and one older.  \nIs it possible to inject/include/simply add content from my recent backup to the older one?  \nSo that when the iPhone is restored from the older backup, the content from the recent one would be restored as well.\nI have some apps installed that don't give me any option to export my content but I have to restore to the earlier backup missing the app or its content. \n\nA: You can using various third party backup and restore software. I like iMazing and know there are a few others out there.\n\nA: I do not believe you can insert extra data into an existing backup. \n", "Q: Is there an application like Connectify for Mac OS X Lion? There is a well known app for Windows named: Connectify, used to share a wifi connection between a computer that only has wifi with other devices which requests that connection from the computer.\nWhat's the best alternative for this app on Mac OS X Lion?\n\nA: The above answers a good except for one thing: that you can share wi-fi to wi-fi as long as you have two adapters. I use an extra usb adapter to share the internal wi-fi of my macbook. Works perfectly fine.\nOther users have done the same thing, and it worked like a charm. This was after struggling to use two different travel routers that were equipped with \"cafe mode\" capabilities which were supposed to allow WiFi to WiFi sharing. \nAfter reading Andre's post, I zipped out and picked up the EnGenius EUB9801 wireless USB adapter. This has a driver for Mountain Lion which can be downloaded online. I then used the Sharing capability built into the Mac as described above. I connected to the available WiFi network using the EnGenius (so the input to my sharing is 802.11n) and shared through wireless (the internal \"airport\" wireless card). Once you have a USB adapter hooked up, WiFi to WiFi sharing becomes possible in this way. And, it's possible to connect multiple devices to the hotspot created by the airport, and to set up WPA2 Personal security (just click on WiFi Options on the sharing screen to set up security and to change your hotspot name if you'd like).\n\nA: Mac OS X has an \"internet sharing\" feature in the Sharing panel in System Preferences.\nAs several people have already figured out in the question and answers here, it lets you share the connection from one hardware interface via any other hardware interface, but it can't use a single Wi-Fi interface as both the main connection and to re-share. (Windows 7 can do this, thanks to \"network virtualization\" features added by Microsoft, which essentially allows a single hardware Wi-Fi interface to respond to multiple SSIDs, and that's the underlying feature that Connectify leverages.)\nOne option that Mac OS X has that isn't quite an answer to this question, but is useful in some of the same situations, is that it can use Bluetooth to create a Personal Area Network (PAN), and its internet sharing feature can share the internet connection from Wi-Fi over the Bluetooth PAN, as documented here.\nI've used this successfully to get an iPad to piggyback on a Macbook's Wi-Fi connection, so both were able to access the internet simultaneously in a hotel where I could only get one device on Wi-Fi. I was not able to get an iPhone 4S to connect to the PAN in the same situation, but supposedly it works for iPod Touches. I don't know if other computers (Mac OS X, Windows, Linux or otherwise) are able to join the PAN and use it as their internet connection.\n\nA: You don't need to use a separate application. You can share wi-fi without any app. Go to System Preferences>Sharing>Internet Sharing:\n\nYou will be prompted to enter a network name and a password (if you choose to).\nIt does also require you to have a hard-wired Internet connection.\n(If you are wondering why my sharing checkbox is greyed out, it's because I don't have a hard-wired connection)\nYou can also click on the Airport icon in the menu bar and then click \"Create Network...\"\n\n\nA: The network architecture in Windows 7 has been redesigned and is more advanced than being able to just create a WiFi hotspot.\nOn a Mac, you can create a WiFi hotspot, only if it is from an Ethernet/RJ45, modem (3G/dun/PPP), Bluetooth or FireWire Internet connection as your source. The built-in hotspot will then use either of these source Internet connections and make it available via a WiFi hotspot through the built-in wireless interface. But, if you are connected to the Internet on a Mac via WiFi in the first place, then you cannot use that same built-in wireless interface to create the hotspot. In short, what you are asking does not work on a Mac running OS X. But it does on Windows!\nIn Windows 7, the OS can \"split\" a single wireless interface in two (a WiFi card + a wireless router), so the OS and applications can connect to a wireless network with internet, and use the same wireless interface to create a separate WiFi hotspot (on which internet sharing can be enabled and multiple devices connected).\nThis is very handy if you want to connect only your laptop to the Internet on public WiFi, and the configure the other devices to connect via the laptop's hotspot instead of the public one. I have a proxy & VPN software running on the laptop and the other devices are then invisible to the public hotspot.\nAnother use for this Windows-only functionality is for software like Connectify that allows you to use your laptop as a wireless access point (AP) when you travel. For example, you might settle into a hotel room, pay for an Internet connection for your MacBook, and then want to share that connection with your iPhone, iPad, and other devices.\nLastly, if you use the \"create network\" option on a Mac, you can join a wireless network (like ad-hoc mode), but will NOT be able to use your wireless Internet connection. Good for sharing printers and files, but not Internet.\n\nA: To share a wi-fi connection, click on the wi-fi icon in the menu bar and choose \"Create Network\". Specify a network name, channel, and security option (non, 40-bit WEP, 128-bit WEP). If you specify one of the WEP security options, you will also set a password. Press \"Create\" to establish the new shared network, and other computers and devices can join the shared network.\n", "Q: How do I deploy a custom app to my iPhone? I'm taking a mobile phone app development class, and will be making custom apps using Xcode.  I'm able to run the app from Xcode on my iPhone 4 no problem, however when I disconnect the phone from the Mac, I'm unable to run the program anymore.  I'm wondering how install the app so that I can run it.\n\nA: You are required to possess the $99/yr developer account with Apple. Without it, you'll lack the sufficient certificates to have the app permanently installed on your device.\n\nA: The school certificate allows you to develop your app and test it on your iOS devices, however, you are not allowed to publish your app into the iOS App Store, therefore, you are not able to keep it on your device without the Xcode. You need the $99/yr developer account\n\nA: Having the schools certificate is sufficient to deploy the app on the device.  After turning off the simulator, or simply unplugging the device from the machine, the application will stay on the device for further use.  There is no further configuration that needs to be done.  However, you will not be able to deploy the app to the store UNLESS you have the rights to do so (which most students do not). \n", "Q: Deleted /Library/Python folder. Is it possible restore? I am on Mac OS X 10.7.2.\nI deleted old python library folder before upgrading to newer python.\nBut I found later that I should never delete the factory-shipped python.\n\nThe Apple-provided build of Python is installed in /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework and /usr/bin/python, respectively. You should never modify or delete these, as they are Apple-controlled and are used by Apple- or third-party software.\n\nIs there a way to restore what I deleted in the folder?\n\nA: I guess you may either restore from your Time Machine backup, or copy it back from another Mac running the same 10.7.2\n\nA: /Library/Python is empty in a new installation.\n", "Q: bind application to file of particular names(rather than suffix) I want to open all makefiles with TextWrangler. But since makefiles have no suffix so binding a type of file to TextWrangler does not work.\nHow can I tell Mac to open any file named Makefile with TextWrangler?\n\nA: There is no way to do this, you can change the application opened on a per instance basis using the standard methods, however this will not apply to all other files of the same name.\nThere are two workarounds, but those do involve a slightly more user movements, click->mouse move ->click) instead of double-click\n\n\n*\n\n*TextWrangler adds an menu item to the right click (ctrl-left click) menu for all files to \"Open File in TextWrangler\"\n\n*Drag the files into the TextWrangler app (or a shortcut) to open the files directly.\n\n\nA: I don't know any way to change the default app based on filename, but you could assign a default application for text files with no extension (and executable shell scripts). f=~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.launchservices.plist; plutil -convert xml1 $f; open $f -a TextEdit and add the entries below to the LSHandlers array:\n<dict>\n    <key>LSHandlerContentType</key>\n    <string>public.plain-text</string>\n    <key>LSHandlerRoleAll</key>\n    <string>com.barebones.textwrangler</string>\n</dict>\n<dict>\n    <key>LSHandlerContentType</key>\n    <string>public.unix-executable</string>\n    <key>LSHandlerRoleAll</key>\n    <string>com.barebones.textwrangler</string>\n</dict>\n\nApplying the changes requires restarting the OS (not just logging out and back in).\n\nA: There is a way, but I wonder if LaunchSerivces would honor it on Lion or not.\nAny how, it is setting the file's creator & type code.\nI read some time ago that Lion's LaunchServices no longer honors those codes and they are Legacy tech from the old Mac days.\nI can think of one possible solution for this. That is to change, if that is even possible, the kMDItemContentType to have a type unique to Makefile's. Also that type must be some how constructed and listed in the field below that which is kMDItemContentTypeTree. You can lookup those fields while running % mdls Makefile in Terminal.app.\nEither way, setting the creator & type codes or setting kMDItemContentType field, is not an easy task. But I hope I have put you on the right track for a possible solution.\n", "Q: Why would 2 sticks of 2GB RAM not work together, but work individually in my Macbook? I have an older Macbook, specifically this model, and when I am upgrading the standard 1GB that it came with. I bought DDR2 667 PNY Memory - 2 X 2GB. According to those specs, my unit can manage 4GB. I called Apple just to verify and they told me the same thing.\nWhen I put both sticks into the unit, the machine doesn't boot up.\nWhen I take out one, and put in the old 512MB, it boots up fine and when I get into OS X it tells me I have 2.5GB of RAM (which is right).\nI have tried both sticks in both slots (all the possible combinations with the two original 512MB sticks). All combinations work (i.e. 2GB A with 512MB A, 2GB A with 512MB B, 2GB B & 512MB A and 2GB B & 512MB B), except with the 2 x 2GB.\nWhy is that?\nI can't remember with certainty, but I think just the 2GB stick alone (with nothing in the other slot) does NOT work.\nI am running memtest now on one of the sticks, to see if there is anything wrong with the actual sticks, so will update this once I have those results (could be a few hours though).\nAny thoughts on what may be causing this and how I can fix it?\nP.S. The PNY sticks are brand new.\n\nA: This is down to a limitation in some memory controllers and how they handle memory sticks with different memory characteristics (also add into the fact that you have no control over these settings in EFI as you might have in a non-EFI BIOS)\nWhen you put both new sticks in, the memory controller is trying to set up the memory according to the specs advised by the PNY SODIMMs, however it is having problems with that configuration and fails to initialise the memory.\nWhen you put in a stick of the older RAM, it changes the configuration to use the slower RAM's settings and the second stick of RAM is actually running at the slower speeds and timings of the old RAM and these are invariably \"slower\" and more conservative than those the PNY sticks can run at.\nThe other posters are correct, the only solution is to get different RAM and try those. I would also advise to use a more reputable brand, the cost differences are minimal and the warranties are better.\n\nA: It's just a problem with particular memory. Maybe its timings are different than your system expects.\nYou should just swap it for another DDR2-667 SODIMM. I can't find a somehow full list of mac compatible memory so just try to search if memory you are going to swap with has any positive feedback on the topic.\n\nA: I have seen this many times, it just happens. The chips are most likely fine in another machine but not yours. \nReturn the modules and request a refund/exchange. \nTry another brand. \nIf it happens again with exchanged/different brand RAM then your machine could be faulty. If it's an out of warranty system it would be an expensive repair.\n\nA: http://www.crucial.com/store/advisor.aspx\nIf you follow that link it will bring you to Crucial which can run a client that will tell you all the compatible RAM for your Mac. Don't know if it helps though. \n\nA: Too late for sure. But it could help. Try to update SMC following that link according to your mb model. \n\nA: It's true older MacBook like my 2.1 can only address 3GB of RAM. Personally I have installed 2x2GB Kingston DDR2 667MHZ SODIMM without any issue. It's running quite fast. Although the computer reports having 4GB, the activities monitor only says 3GB are able to be used. But having 2 identical matching RAM is still better than having a 2GB and 1GB. The price of memory is quite low so having 1GB of 'wasted' RAM is no big deal. \n", "Q: Open youtube link in Safari In iPad Safari, when a page has a link to a youtube video, if I click the link, Safari will open youtube app. Is it possible to change this behavior? I don't want to use the youtube app and I want to open the youtube page in safari.\niPad 2, iOS 5.0.1.\n\nA: Do you use the Youtube.app at all? Because if you don't use it, you can disable it. Go to Settings > General > Restrictions. There you can disable several apps, one of them being the Youtube application. With the youtube.app disabled a youtube link in Safari will no longer redirect you to the native Youtube.app. The Youtube application icon will also no longer appear on your home screen/springboard and you will not be able to launch it from spotlight either, so you'll need to use the mobile youtube site in Safari if you want to browse through Youtube video's.\nIf you're not willing to disable the native Youtube application there is no way to change this behavior.\n", "Q: What happens on the other end when you press \"End call\" If someone is calling you and you press \"End call\", does that mean that the caller is \"cut\" off, or does the ringing continue on the callers phone?\n\nA: If you press \"End Call\" you effectively terminate the call and the other person is also immediately disconnected. \nIf you don't want this to happen, you have to press the \"hardware\" volume down button to \"silence\" the phone or mute the phone with the hardware button (as far as I can remember). This way the phone will keep ringing but you won't hear it, and the other person won't notice it.\n\nA: When you press \"End call\", you hang up.\n\nA: No the call ends on both ends once either party presses end call. \n\nA: The difference between End Call and using another form of silencing your phone (e.g., the volume rockers) is as you say: If you \"End Call\", it immediately forwards them to voicemail, and they'll know that you're choosing to not take the call. Whereas using the volume rocker to merely silence the call will let the call to continue on their end.\n", "Q: Minimum virtual memory (swapfile) size setting Is possible set the minimum swapfile size in OS X?\nCurrently OS X allocating swapfiles on demand, e.g. when when need 3.2GB will allocate 4GB and so on.

Running Lion with all updates applied, and booting off an external optical drive due to my Mini not having one.\nHas anyone experienced a similar issue? Is it perhaps to do with my display?\nMany thanks\n\nA: this link identifies an black screen issue when installing Windows 7 on some iMac's, it may be relevant even though you have a Mac Mini\nthis link is the Apple FAQs for Installing Windows 7 in Bootcamp, there are some good resources there for the main issues most users meet.\nthis link is the Apple Install Guide for Windows 7 which I think you have already been following, but I'm linking it here for other people if required.\n\nA: Essentially the answer is to create a bootable USB drive, by copying the boot sector from the original CD/DVD using bootsect. You can then drag and drop the contents of the original DVD onto your pendrive and away you go.\nThis blog post really helped me:\nhttp://liza.id.au/installing-windows-7-through-boot-camp-with-no-optical-drive-on-a-mac-mini/\n\nA: Just another possible answer for anyone else with a similar situation to mine....\nI'd been battling all night thinking there was issues with my USB stick etc or some weird partitioning problem etc.  In the process I think I've understood a lot more about how my Mac Mini (Late 2014) boots now for Boot Camp.\nFirst, I thought the USB stick it prepared (I was using Windows 10 Preview ISO) was the actual boot device.  When my computer rebooted for Windows it was simply going to a black screen so I figured the USB boot wasn't working.  Not so.  The boot partition is part of the partition that the 3rd tick box does in BCA, which seems to tell the Mac \"use this boot loader (EFI) in the partition I created, and use for the USB disk you just created for the install files\" - so it purely uses the USB as a storage device for the Windows install.\nIt's important to note that it's obviously a damn good idea to remove other USB devices from the system during this process, or it may boot and pick the wrong USB device.\nAnyway back to the black screen.  So it turns out everything had been installed and partitioned correctly, and my Mac mini was booting into the new Windows boot partition, but using HDMI output!  So the black screen I was seeing was because it was outputting the display to HDMI, not my VGA monitor via the display port adapter.  \nThis was only for the initial \"Setup Windows\" phase - once Windows had installed its files (remember to select the BOOTCAMP disk listed, format it, and then choose it for the install) it rebooted as Windows installs normally do (note to self, hold down option here so we can choose Windows boot again).  Once it was booting and finishing the install for the 2nd time, it activated the VGA display (presumably has drivers now).   It continued installing and then again rebooted for a 3rd time (this time it went back into the Windows boot automatically), again via VGA.  My bluetooth keyboard and mouse were also activated at this point (had to use wired mouse for the very first initial setup part).  \nOnce Windows 10 was fully installed I manually ran the Bootcamp/Setup.exe on the D: disk (my USB stick) which seems to have installed the rest of the drivers (Wireless driver for WiFi, correct display driver, sound driver, chipset etc).  It also installs Boot Camp systray icon to let you restart back into OSX.\n", "Q: iTunes sync error -50 I recently tried to sync my iOS device, but I got a message similar to this one:\n\nI tried googling around, and people generally recommended to disable syncing photos to fix this, but in my case syncing photos was already off.\nAny ideas on how to fix this?\n\nA: I just fixed this by deleting a large video from my iPhone.\nEven though I still had about 3 GB left, it seems that iTunes wants there to remain some free space on the iPhone before syncing.\nOnce I had about 4 GB left, it started syncing again normally.\nI hope this helps someone, and for god's sake Apple you could've included a less cryptic error message for such a simple issue.\n", "Q: Comparing MacBook Air sleep resume times Q1. Which MacBook Air models have the fastest resume-from-sleep times?\nIn other words, how long does it take (in the most common scenario, not the theoretically-shortest) between opening the display lid and getting a keypress echoed in an open TextEdit window?\nQ2.  Do the newer (or newest) MBA's have faster resume time?\nQ3.  How does this compare to the resume time of the iPad?\nFor the purpose of these questions, milliseconds matter!\n\nA: This is not an actual answer to your questions, but more information on the subject:\nMacBook Airs go into \"deep sleep\" (hibernate) when left with the lid closed for a longer while. Basically, the current state of the machine is saved to the hard drive (the SSD in the case of MacBooks) and the machine turns off, thus not consuming any power while in standby. When you open the lid, the machine state is retrieved from the SSD and restored.\nSo, the wake time is determined by the speed of the SSD inside the MacBook Air.\n2010 MacBook Airs have SSD speeds in terms of 100 MBps, while latest MacBook Airs (2012) have SSD speeds in terms of 400-500 MBps, so wake time should be a lot faster with the 2012 models.\nComparing with the iPad is irrelevant, as iPads do not hibernate, as far as I'm aware of.\n\nA: In any case, the resume times for most macs are pretty much instant. You might find that the biggest delay in resume time is the responsiveness of the display, as the computer will usually be ready before the display is\nIt helps to know the various \"types\" of sleep available through the pmset command\nfrom this this article\n0 - Old style sleep mode, with RAM powered on while sleeping, safe sleep disabled, and super-fast wake.\n1 - Hibernation mode, with RAM contents written to disk, system totally shut down while “sleeping,” and slower wake up, due to reading the contents of RAM off the hard drive.\n3 - The default mode on machines introduced since about fall 2005. RAM is powered on while sleeping, but RAM contents are also written to disk before sleeping. In the event of total power loss, the system can be boot off the sleep image to resume previous operation\n5 - This is the same as mode 1, but it’s for those using secure virtual memory (in System Preferences -> Security).\n7 - This is the same as mode 3, but it’s for those using secure virtual memory.\n\nModes 1 and 3 will have the same speed of resume (they both retain RAM contents during sleep, wake is practically instant), but mode 3 will require a longer time to fall asleep (usually 15-60 seconds). In the case of power failure, mode 3 allows you to boot your laptop, and after about a minute, the RAM contents from before the last sleep would be restored from the sleep image file to RAM. Mode 1 lacks this, so all running applications and unsaved data will be lost in event of a power failure, but sleep time is almost instant \n\nA: I have a 2010 MBA and resume time is very fast but I noticed the time it takes to sleep is much longer with Lion than Snow Leopard it came with.  Not sure why that is but I have stopped using sleep because it shuts down faster, obviously dumping what is in memory rather than saving it, to shut down and just as quick to boot as to wake from sleep or at least negligible difference.\n", "Q: When does the arp cache get emptied? does anyone know when the arp cache in OS X Lion gets emptied? Or which automatism causes it to get emptied? Is it a time period, which can be set somewhere?\nThanks!\n\nA: According to arp(4) on an OS X Lion system:\n\n The ARP cache is stored in the system routing table as dynamically-created host\n routes.  The route to a directly-attached Ethernet network is installed as a\n ``cloning'' route (one with the RTF_CLONING flag set), causing routes to individual\n hosts on that network to be created on demand.

Which post-chicklet models have a keyboard feel most similar to the keyboard of the pre-2008 MacBook Pro?\n\n\nA: None, to be frank. They all feel approximately the same in my opinion - the MacBook white 2010 has a lighter feel than the Pro or Air which to my senses are pretty much the same. \nBoth the current models and the now out of production white macbook have the same keyboard, to all intents and purposes, apart from the air and pro have a backlit keyboard which possibly leads to a heavier key press - although that might just be because my white machine is older and slightly more worn.\n\nA: I think it is a subjective question but there's nothing wrong with that. We all have different experience and sensitivities to keyboards and in my opinion, those of us who touch type probably have the most sensitivity to small changes in hardware.\nI touch type and have been using computer keyboards of various types for over 30 years. I've used every Macintosh keyboard that has ever been up to this point and I've never found one that I couldn't get used to in time including my current one which is on a one year old MacBook Pro. \nInitially I didn't like the look of the chicklet style keyboards but they're fine and I don't notice any accuracy or speed issues with them.\n\nA: Having owned a 2008 MacBook (Aluminum), 2010 MacBook Pro and 2011 MacBook Air, I can safely say the way each key press feels is consistent across the line - and extend the same experience to the latest Wired/Wireless Apple keyboards (with exception of the sounds they make)\nThe only key press action that feels different is the smaller Function keys that are found on a MacBook Air. \n\nA: one thing to consider is the keyboard angle.\nthe macbook air keyboard sits lower to the desk & has a slight angle\nvs macbook pro is flat. the edge of the computer is a little sharper on hands/wrists with a sharper edge - more noticeable while using the trackpad\n\nA: None of the newer keyboards have the soft touch of the old-fashioned MBP keyboards, frankly. Here's a summary of differences that I can remember:\nOld Pro keyboard vs new 'chicklet' keyboards\n\n*\n\n*The \"old fashioned\" pro keyboard of the 2007 15\" MBP has no empty space in-between the keys.\n\n*Whereas the new keys are merely flat, the old keys were \"hollow\".\n\n*The pressure point is lower, thus pressing the keys is 'softer' or 'easier'. (old keyboard)\n\n*If my memory is correct, the old keyboard was also a quieter, but over all every mobile keyboard Apple has made has been very quiet. So this is not an issue.\n\nSince all of the unibody (retina) Macbook Pros/Airs now have the same keyboard design, the typing experience is fairly similar. Other factors become more relevant when judging the subjective experience:\n\n*\n\n*tilted typing angle (Airs)\n\n*larger palm rest area (15\" Pro).\n\n*cold surface due to more efficient chipsets\n\nI have worked with a 2007 15\" MBP, 2007 13\" Macbook, 2011 15\" MBP and 2012 13\" MBA.\n\nA: I have a MacBook Pro 13\" 2012 and a MacBook Air 13\" 2014, and the MBP has longer key travel distance when you press it. Not much, but noticeable. I also think the MBP 2012 keys are more \"hollow\", formed after the finger tips, whereas the MBA keys are flat.\n", "Q: How do I transfer text messages from my old Blackberry to my new iPhone?

No matter if the move is large or small, the cursor goes exactly where I send it.\nOn my Mac, when I move the mouse, it seems to do what I want on large moves, but on little moves the cursor does not respond as well as on the PC. It seems to slow down, as if it had missed some move instructions, as if it was responding only one on two impulsions.\nFor example, when I try to catch the cross to close a window, I have no difficulties to reach the cross area, but to put the mouse exactly on it to close the window, it's as if I were moving the mouse on a badly responding surface. It's hard to reach the cross, like if the mouse was suddenly 2 times slower. Same problem to put the cursor beetween 2 letters on a text to make a precise selection, and other similar things. It's a nightmare!\nI had tried many settings into the mouse control panel but it does not change anything on this problem.\nI have also tried 3 other mouses, one wireless Logitech Mac OS compatible, one wired Microsoft and one wired Trust: all have the same problem.\nWhat is happening? Do you know how may I solve this issue? \n\nA: See https://superuser.com/questions/5150/make-mac-os-x-mouse-acceleration-more-windows-like/540150#540150 for a variety of things to try.\nI personally am using SmoothMouse right now and have used mousefix in the past. \n\nA: It seems like what you are referring to is not a problem with your mouse (as you've tried several). I'll also rule out the silly possibility that you are using all those mouses on a sub-optimal surface, like glass or uneven and rough wood, etc. I think you're simply experiencing the effect of different mouse acceleration algorithms between different operating systems.\nAs the physical hand/mouse movement cannot practically be mapped 1:1 to the cursor movement (you'd need a trackpad as big as the screen!), some kind of mapping algorithm between the hand movement and cursor movement is necessary. Mac by default implements it so that slow hand movement maps to a very slow cursor movement (for precise targeting), and a relatively fast hand movement maps to a very fast cursor movement (for moving quickly in a general direction but without fine-level accuracy). On Win machines a bit of this kind of acceleration also exists but it is not nearly as pronounced as it is in OS X. Some Win users switching to a Mac might find this maddening as their muscles and motor skills are used to something different. But same is true for a Mac user switching to Win. I.e. a Mac user might feel that mouse is traveling way to slow when reaching distant parts of the screen, and it's harder to do fine targeting in a small area. The Mac way does seem to work better the larger the displays are since it's benefits are more obvious in that case.\nThe good news is that if you just give it a week or two of constant usage, your muscles will likely get used to it and you won't perceive a problem at all. Based on your description, you might want to increase you mouse speed a bit though, to split the difference between big broad moves, and tiny, precise ones.\nAs a last resort, there are apps like Controller Mate:\nhttp://www.orderedbytes.com/controllermate/help/?show=configaccel \nthat let you adjust the acceleration algorithm used yourself.\n\nA: I just experienced the same problem. Out of the blue, blam.\nNo luck with changing USB port or rebooting.\nLooked here but defaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.mouse.scaling -1 didn't shake it loose.\nHowever switching the mouse to different machine and then immediately back to my original iMac did!\nMy guess is that it is some kind of firmware glitch & running on fresh machine reset something.\n", "Q: Why is \"recently added\" playlist under iCloud control empty on iPhone? The playlist \"recently added\" is a smart playlist (created by iTunes) and lists quite some songs in iTunes on the Mac.

But \"recently added\" always is empty on the iPhone (unlike most other playlists).\n\nA: You're not the only one suffering from this issue. A lot of people are complaining on the internet about this.  \nA solution would be to turn off iTunes Match on your iPhone, delete all your music on your iPhone (it's all in the iCloud, right?

If I'm about to play a demanding 3D game, would closing this background apps be of any benefit to my battery or overall performance?\n\nA: Think of the apps that show on double-click as simply a list of most recently used apps, not a list of apps currently running in the memory (this list is separate from the previous and not visible to a user).\n\nA: No, iOS handles all the allocating and de-allocating of memory(RAM)on its own in the back round. Apps have three states, open, suspended and closed. If an app is suspended which is what usually happens when you close an app and it winds up in the tray (when you double tap home) and you need more RAM for you game lets say then ios will automatically make room on the stack for the game by closing the apps that are suspended(in the tray, in the order they were opened, first to last) which will open up more memory for your game.

Check what apps are running in the background using the Activity Monitor (found under Applications > Utilities), and get rid/uninstall of any third-party unnecessary apps that might be using too much memory.\nYou should also have a look at the apps that open at login by going to System Preferences > Users > Login Items. Also check how much Disk Space you have left: If its less than 10-20% of the original I strongly suggest you clean up a bit.\nHope it helps!\n\nA: You can use this tutorial to burn Lion to a pen drive (or CD but I prefer the former) and reinstall your computer from scratch - however be aware that in doing so iLife will not be reinstalled and you'll need your original disks for that. Also don't forget to back up the stuff you want to transfer across :)\n", "Q: Selecting Default Playlist Columns in iTunes When you create a new playlist and select it in iTunes, it displays the following columns (renamed for clarity):\n# Song Title iCloud Status Length Artist Album Genre Rating Plays\nIs it possible to remove any of these defaults, or more generally pick a specific set of default columns to apply to new Playlists? I have no need for Genre, Rating, or Plays, and always immediately choose 'Auto Size All Columns' in a new playlist view after adding tracks.\n\nA: New playlists use the current columns in the main music list. If you want to remove those columns, just remove them from the main browsing window (Music under LIBRARY). Then create a new playlist and you should see the new columns appear.\n\nA: After much agonizing, I discovered that claytron's answer above is correct, with the addition of only one very important detail.\nThe default All Music view's columns will be your default columns when in the same view mode of other items like playlists.\nWhat do I mean by 'same view mode'?\n\nList View, Album List View, Grid (or Icon Mode), and Cover Flow.\nThe trick is that playlists start in the normal list view, where I use Album List view when browsing all my music. When I made this realization, I entered standard list view of all my music, fixed the columns I wanted displayed, and more importantly resized them, and then created a new playlist, and it looked identical to what I had just set up.\nOut of curiosity, I went to an existing playlist and switched to Album List view, sure enough it looked identical to the setup I normally see on my all music view.\n", "Q: Lion always explicitly moves files to and from external drives In Lion, whenever I drag and drop a file to or from an external drive to the local drive it always moves the file. If I'm not mistaken the default behavior is to copy the file right? Does anyone know why it might be doing this or know of a preference anywhere that I can set it to explicitly copy the files?\n\nA: To copy files instead of move them, you can use menu items in the Edit menu, or their associated keyboard shortcuts. I am running Lion, and I have an external usb drive. If I select a file on this external drive and open the Finder's \"Edit\" menu, there's a \"Copy\" menu item with the shortcut Cmd-C.\nChoosing that menu item, then selecting a folder on my internal hard drive, gives a menu item of \"Paste\" (again in the \"Edit\" menu) with the shortcut Cmd-V.\nAlso, dragging and dropping with the option key held down will copy a file rather than move it.\n", "Q: How do I pause the installation of iOS apps? How do I pause the installation of an application? I started the download and installation of two apps from the app store. Now those are showing \"waiting\" and I want to cancel the installation of those apps.\n\nA: *\n\n*To pause the download or installation of an app you need to tap once on the icon of the app in question. To resume the installation you need to tap once again on the same icon.\n\n*To completely cancel the installation of an app you need to tap and hold any application icon on your home screen/springboard until all the app icons start to wiggle. Then you can delete the apps you want. (The ability to delete apps that aren't completely installed yet is only available since iOS 5)\n\n", "Q: Buying a mac - help needed with specs I am a mobile developer. I have some expertise in Android development, and now I wish to start developing for the iPhone \\ iPad. I plan to be using xcode for iOS 5.\nI found this deal on a second-hand shop:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac - 17\"\n\n*Processor - Core 2 \\ 2 GHZ\n\n*RAM - 2 GB\n\n*hard disk - 320 GB\n\n\nPrice : 485$\nWhat do you think? Is it worth it?\n\nA: If you're developing for iOS, you are going to want a more recent machine than that - the 17\" iMac dates back past snow leopard and possibly even leopard itself, which you are going to need to run Xcode. \nAlso, as mentioned above, a 17\" screen is likely too small for iOS development to be comfortable - I use a 24\" and even then sometimes it's cramped. \nLast but not least, to me $500 for long outdated hardware is a lot of cash. Second hand stores are rarely amazingly good deals - they buy cheap and hike up for their own profit. If you are going to go down the second hand route I'd definitely advise going to a private seller (of some level of trust). \nIf I were you I'd put the bucks into a brand new machine and recover the cost with the app sales, as a new machine will last longer, perform better and definitely accept all the software you need. \n\nA: it would be a wise choice to get a recent mac mini for your $500.00\n", "Q: virtualbox running win7 64bit, too slow I have a MBP, i5 CPU and 4G ram.\nI run win7 using virtualbox and I allocate 2G ram for win7, only to find my Mac acts too slowly.\nWhat can I do for that? Am I allocating too much ram?\n\nA: A Mac, especially one running Snow Leopard or Lion, requires at least 2 GB of RAM for decent system performance. \nEven through the system requirements for Snow Leopard are 1 GB, it doesn't perform well with 1 GB. Lion requires 2 GB of RAM just to be able to run. If you plan on running a virtual machine setup and expect decent performance from both machines, I'd have 8 GB of RAM in my machine. You can get 8 GB of ram for less than $50 from OWC. \nAlso, If you're not doing anything major in Windows, I'd lose the 64 bit installation, bump it down to 1 GB of RAM and try again. I use 32 bit Win7 Enterprise for work through a Parallels VM and only allocate 1 GB of RAM for it and it runs great, especially in coherence mode. \n\nA: In addition to the more RAM suggestion from Matt, I would look at investing in a solid state disk (SSD). Generally, user experience is bottlenecked on disk input/output, and an SSD has much higher throughput. Ever since I installed an SSD in my machine I no longer have 2nd thoughts about firing a VM and slowing down my system - I see almost no performance impact.\n", "Q: I want to change the country on my app store account and I am having some problems? \nPossible Duplicate:\nDo I need to repurchase apps if I moved countries? \n\nSo I wanted to change the country on my app store account but I was told that all of the purchases made in that region will be blocked and won't work so I wanted to make a new app store account but I need to know if I won't get all of my other apps blocked when I log into this account or when I create it. So lets call my current country on the account A and what I want to change it to is B. If I made a new account and logged into the account for country B, will it be the appstore of that country? And if so then when I want to log back to my account on country A will I be able to do it just by signing out and then in again?\n\nA: First you create an account for country B (the easiest way to do this is to create the account in the iTunes Store on your computer). Then when you log in to the account for country B, you will be redirected to the App Store of country B. While you're logged in to the account for country B you will still be able to use apps, music, books, etc. you purchased with the account for country A. When you want to go back to the App Store or iTunes Store of country A, you just need to log out en log in again with your account for country A.\nSo the short answers to you questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes.\n\n*Yes.\n\n", "Q: Is iPad 2S already available or not? I thought it would be out only in March but here I can see a video from an University which says they bought 50 iPad 2S\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HhBm9doR6E\nSo I'm confused.\n\nA: No. You're misreading 2s. Concordia didn't purchase a new model, they bought multiple units. iPad 2s is the plural of iPad 2. \nAlthough the rumor mill continues to grind away there has been no announcement from Apple about the release of the next iPad model, its specifications or release date. \n", "Q: iPhoto: How to only set the year of a picture? I use iPhoto to manage my pictures. Unfortunately I have many pictures from the 80s. These pictures are actually slides that I have scanned in during 2008. So my problem is that the creation date of all these pictures is set to the date when I scanned it in. Now I want to set the real date of these pictures. Unfortunately I don't know the exact date, but at least the year.\nSo is there any function available to only set the year field of a date without a specific date?\n\nA: Select the photos you want to set a date for. In the menu, select Photos > Batch Change, then select date from the dialog pop-up. \n", "Q: What prevents iOS and iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch from having an official screen recorder? I have searched all over Apple's help and documentation I can't find any built in or app store apps that provide screen recording. \nWhat prevents such an app to exist ? Are there any obvious technical reasons?\n\nA: The technical reason no store app has screen recording is simply that no official API is provided from Apple to developers to perform screen recording. \nThe hardware is clearly capable of snapping still frames and storing / processing a video feed of the screen's size, so it's probably not a purely technical reason why it's currently not a feature of the OS.\n\nA: Apple limits the degree to which iOS applications can communicate and \"share\". I'm not a developer, but I would be surprised if a screen recorder application is allowed under the rules or possible with the iOS APIs. \nIf this feature is important to you, send feedback to Apple explaining what you want and why it's important to you. \n", "Q: Powerbook g4 not fully booting to login screen FireWire problems I posted earlier about this and I got an answer that told me to use a FireWire cable to connect to another Mac and load the files onto that Mac. Here is a link to the earlier question: Powerbook G4 not fully booting to login screen\nWell I finally got a FireWire cable and tried it. It worked, and I connected that Hard drive to the iMac as a device. I can open up the hard drive and look inside and see all of the folders that would normally be on the hard drive. However, when I look inside those folders, they are totally empty. Is this a cause of what happened earlier? Or is it a problem with the FireWire? How can I fix this? When I tried unhiding files and that didnt help. I also looked at the hard drive with get info and it looks like there might be more than just the folders on it, or folders are actually larger than I would expect. \n\nA: From what you're seeing I'd guess that the startup drive on your Mac has some sort of file system or directory problem.\nIf this were my computer, I'd reformat the hard drive and (assuming that went without a hitch) restore from my backup.\nIf a backup wasn't available, I'd run DiskWarrior (be certain it's a version compatible with the OS on the \"borked\" drive.) If that failed, I'd try the repair disk function in Disk Utility as a last resort.\nNote that it's quite possibile that Disk Utility will repair this disk. Given that Disk Utility is free, one might wonder why I'd opt for the utility that costs money. My reasoning is that DiskWarrior is non-destructive and allows you to preview the \"repaired\" drive before committing to changes. If you absolutely can't or won't use DiskWarrior, at least use Disk Utilities \"verify\" mode before attempting the repair.\nUnix Gurus might advocate using fsck instead of Disk Utility but I prefer the GUI approach. \nI would also advocate casting a suspicious eye on any disk that you've had to use drastic methods to recover. Given the age of the computer in question, and assuming an original disk drive, my tendency would be to immediately transfer recovered information to a new disk and install that into the computer. In the old days I might put the old disk to work as a \"shuttle\" drive but in this era of keychain jump drives and DropBox I'd just strip it for bits or send it to the ewaste recycler. \n", "Q: How do I tell if the Flash Player Installer is a virus? There's been a couple of trojans recently that imitate the Adobe Flash Player installer one of which is called OSX/flashback.A. (More info here) I've been wary of updating Adobe Flash Player due to this trojan. How do I tell if the installer is the real thing, or if it's just a trojan? Also, where does it come from? I'm pretty sure the DMG for the trojan downloaded automatically, opened the installer, and wanted me to install it.\nI know that I can download the official installer from the Adobe website, and will probably do this. However, my questions remain.\n\nA: There are a couple easy ways to identify the trojan in it's current form (aside from downloading directly from Adobe or using AV software):\n\n\n*\n\n*The trojan is an installer package that opens with Installer.app, the real installer is an application (it doesn't use Installer.app). \n\n*When run, the trojan installer looks like the screenshot of the trojan installer in the CNET article you linked to, the real installer looks like the screenshot of the real installer in that same article. (Screenshots reposted below.)\nThe trojan is found exclusively on sites that are not adobe.com, generally from malicious sites.\nLegitimate Flash Player Installer:\n\nTrojan Installer:\n\n\nA: If you want to be sure, grab the official installer from Adobe's website.  http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/\n\nA: From the start of 2021, Adobe no longer supports Flash Player and has blocked Flash content from running in Flash Player. Adobe strongly recommends all users immediately uninstall Flash Player to help protect their systems.\nConsequently, it's now safe to assume that any Flash Player update you come across is malware.\nhttps://www.adobe.com/uk/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html\n\nA: Try either Onyx (Free) or Cocktail ($) that will, among a myriad of things, will also search for malicious known stuff.\n", "Q: ipod classic is not listed under source list in iTune after restore After connect to usb, winXP can open itunes but there is no device on left bar. \nI tried re-install iTunes. Reboot iPod, disable anti-virus daemon etc etc, still no go. \nAnything else I can do?\n\nA: Apple's Knowledgebase suggests a multi-step process for troubleshooting this issue. \n\n  \n*\n  \n*Try the iPod troubleshooting assistant: If you have not already done so, try the steps in the iPod Troubleshooting Assistant\n  (choose your iPod model from the list).\n  \n  \n  If the issue remains after following your iPod's troubleshooting\n  assistant, follow the steps below to continue troubleshooting your\n  issue.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Restart the iPod Service\n  \n*Restart the Apple Mobile Device Service\n  \n*Empty your Temp directory and restart\n  \n*Verify that the Apple Mobile Device USB Driver is installed\n  \n*Change your iPod's drive letter\n  \n*Remove and reinstall iTunes\n  \n*Disable conflicting System Services and Startup Items\n  \n\nApple's iPod: Appears in Windows but not in iTunes contains more details about these steps. \n", "Q: How much time would pass before overwriting data on iPod/iPhone flash memory results in failure? Just for the sake of this question.\nLet's say I have a file that fills my iPod completely, and I set an automated test to save this file into my iPod and overwrite it, non stop. How much time will pass until the flash drive cannot write the file anymore?\nI tried to Google this, but \"Stress test\" only means smashing your device to pieces.\n\nA: Flash controllers generally degrade gracefully, so once a block has failed, it no longer is usable, so you would expect a slow, gradual shrinking of the usable space over time. Once the majority of the blocks start reaching the limit on write cycles (you need to store different data - not just the same bits to make real change on most flash controllers) then this reduction of space increases more linearly with time / write cycles.\nSo - it will be quick to not store the entire file, but a much longer time until you can't write to 50% of the drive.\n", "Q: How do you check how much current a Mac USB port can deliver? This question is similar to the superuser question \"How to check how much power a USB port can deliver\", which is answered for Linux and Windows. \nHow do you check the same on a Mac?\n\nA: Simply open About this Mac -> More Info... and go to USB on the left side of System Profiler. You will get current (now power or voltage) in milliAmpere but I guess this is what you need to know.

I'd say 6/10 it fails.\nI'll:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start playing the media\n\n*Press the AirPlay button (either from within the app or on the task bar)\n\n*Choose the Apple TV receiver\n\n\nand after a few seconds it'll revert back to displaying on the local device.\nI select the AirPlay option either before the media starts, or during it. It doesn't seem to make a difference.\nSome times it'll look as though Apple TV tries to load it, other times it does not.\nThis happens with any application I use (eg. Safari, Spotify, Downcast).\nMy setup is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*My iPad and iPhone 4 are connected to an Airport Express\n\n*My Apple TV is wired to a Netgear DG934G (a Sky Broadband router).\n\n*The Netgear and Airport Express are wired to each other.\n\n*I also have a laptop running XBMC which is acting as a AirPlay receiver. This is connected wirelessly to the Netgear. This too is flakey in terms of supporting AirPlay.\n\n\nIs it common for AirPlay to fail this frequently, or do I have problem?\nThanks.\n\nA: No - that is not at all common.\nSomething is certainly causing the instability so you might need to isolate the potential causes one at a time.\n\n\n*\n\n*network issues (the most likely culprit but by far not the only one)\n\n*Apple TV needing a restore or perhaps just a reboot.\n\n*iOS device needing the same (restore or reboot).\n\n\nBefore restoring your iOS device, you might try the other steps first or also you could take your device to another network / Apple TV such as a retail store to test and make sure that's not the cause.\n\nA: I've had similar airplay flakiness. I can usually fix the issue by toggling AirPlay off and on, but I've also had to reset the Apple TV.\n", "Q: Using iMac in Home Cinema I am currently considering buying an iMac 27\" to replace my PC, and also to have at the centre of my home cinema/media system.  \nThe iMac would be used to play DVDs, stream video, play CDs, MP3s etc.\nI want to send both the video and audio to a Home Cinema Reciever, ideally all through an HDMI cable (avoiding a separate cable for the audio), connected to the iMac via a MDP to HDMI converter.

How can I prevent that other than plugging and unplugging the HDMI cable?\nUpdate: covers similar ground to Best practices for 2011 Mac mini connected to monitor + HDTV?\n\nA: I had the same problem, this happens because the TV is still sending a signal to the HDMI port even when powered off so the Mac still thinks that it's active. To solve this you need a HDMI switcher that will fully kill the HDMI signal when it's not used.

How do I make it stop asking me?\n\nA: As you phrased this, it generally occurs because the login password was reset at some point, and now the \"login\" keychain is protected with a different password than the account as a whole. The other possibility is that the keychain is set to lock automatically. Both issues can be addressed using Keychain Access, which lives in your Utilities folder.\nIf you do not know the password:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose Preferences from the Keychain Access menu.\n  \n\n*Click Reset My Default Keychain\n\nIf you do know the password, but Keychain is auto-locked\n\n\n*\n\n*Highlight the \"login\" keychain on the left of the main window.\n  \n\n*Choose Change Setting for keychain \"login\"… from the Edit menu\n  \n\n*Adjust settings as desired.

Do PDF documents in iBooks get backed up to iCloud?\nIt is very strange that there is no answer to this on official Apple forums. Searching for this online often brings up Wifi iTunes sync or using file sharing services like box.net to do this.\n\nA: Yes, as long as you have the iCloud backup enabled your documents will be backed up. I have first hand experience. After exchanging a defective iPad the new one, after entering my iCloud account information, had all my books (both epub and pdfs, I don't buy books from the iTunes store because of DRM), links, gamecenter data, and application data.\nWhat didn't synchronise was music and videos.\n\nA: Based on my tests, PDF files and non-iTunes store eBook content are backed up to iCloud. However, Video and music files not purchased through the iTunes Store are not backed up to iCloud. (For this discussion I'm ignoring music backed up using the premium iTunes Match service.) These media files are synchronized with (and presumably backed up from) an iTunes library attached to a computer.\nApple doesn't specifically call out PDF files in iBooks, but they do provide some reference: iCloud: Backup and restore overview\n\nYou get unlimited free storage for:\nPurchased music, TV shows, apps, and books *\nYou get 5GB of free iCloud storage for:\nPhotos and videos in the Camera Roll Device settings (for example:\nPhone Favorites, Wallpaper, and Mail, Contacts, Calendar accounts) App\ndata Home screen and app organization Messages (iMessage, SMS, and\nMMS) Ringtones\n…\n The following items are not backed up to iCloud.

I also keep dozens of tabs open.\nEvery single time I take the Thalys, or I get into some Hotel \"pay-per-use\" Wifi network, my MBA stupidly loads the accesspoints' login-or-register-with-credit-card-number page. While I ignore it, I do lose the pages I had open, since the damn things rewrite the URLs.\nFor example:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/somenumber/somequestion\n\nis turned into:\nhttps://portal.thalysnet.com/?hostname=stackoverflow.com\n\nwhich means I don't know what the page was about, since I might have a dozen SO tabs open at the time... all called this :/ .\nIs there any way I can block \"URL rewriting\" on the Mac, unless specifically authorized by me?\n\nA: Disable \"Ask to join new networks\", when selecting Wi-fi in the Network preference pane. You might also need to explicitely forget those networks if you joined them in the past, by clicking on \"Advanced...\" and removing any undesired network.\nOnce you are connected to these networks, there is no way in changing this behavior. As every request passes through their access point, they can modify it in every way they want (and return a redirect response instead for example).\n\nA: Unfortunately the rewriting is done by a proxy. You could try to disable automatic CaptiveNetworkSupport probing by editing /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/CaptiveNetworkSupport/Settings.plist\n\nA: I had a similar problem after travelling on Thalys between Belgium and Netherlands.  I also use Linux and Firefox.  Clicking \"Restore to Default\" in Prefernces did not work for me.  As soon as I tried to restore my homepage, it again redirected to the Thalys portal. In addition, a couple of saved pages in my Bookmarks menu also redirected to the Thalys portal.  \nI solved it using \"Tools --> Clear Recent History\".  I set \"Time range to clear\" to \"Everything\" and checked all boxes under \"Details\". I probably should have checked the boxes and \"Cleared\" one by one to see what was causing the problem, but clearing the whole lot worked for me and there is no history that I need to keep.\n\nA: I had a similar problem today after I had travelled with Thalys to Paris. I run Firefox under Linux, but perhaps this is helpful to Mac users as well.\nWhen I got home and connected through my home network, Firefox displayed the Thalys start page instead of my regular homepage. In \"Preferenses -> General\" it still said my regular homepage, but it was the Thalys page I got anyway.\nThe problem was solved when I clicked \"Restore to Default\" in Preferences. After I had done that, I could set it to my regular homepage again, and this time Firefox went to it.\nA colleague sitting beside me on the train who had a Mac told me that connecting through Thalys always screwed up things with the bookmarks on his Mac, so it appears that this is a general problem\n", "Q: How to disable animations on iPhone? iPhone has many miscellaneous  animations. For example, there is a “maximize window” animation whenever we open an app, and a “minimise window” animation whenever we close an app.\nOn Android, we can opt to disable animations via Settings → Display → Animations → No animations.\nHow do we turn off animations on iPhone?\n\nA: Since iOS7 there are a couple of options for reducing animations and other UI effects such as translucency:\nSettings > General < Accessibility > Increase Contrast: On/Off and\nSettings > General < Accessibility > Reduce Motion: On/Off\n\nA: The only way I'm aware of to do this is to use a jailbreak tweak called Springtomize. Apple will not allow you to do this natively since it affects the aesthetic quality of the device. That's just Apple!\n\nA: I also had the same problem on my iPhone 5s.\nWhen I checked my Reduce Motion setting, it was disabled. Which means there must be motion.\nSo I powered off my iPhone and powered on it again. After that everything was back to normal.\n", "Q: sudo password incorrect all of a sudden sudo ls\n\nAll of a sudden it says password incorrect. I am 100% sure of my password. I don't know what happened. Hacked ?\n\nA: Have you verified your password is correct by authenticating through the GUI? An easy way is to go to System Preferences > Accounts and click the lock icon. Also, verify that your user account has not lost administrative privileges (you can do this from the same preference pane). If you've lost administrative privileges the issue may be related to something else.\n", "Q: How can I stop my iPhone displaying \"iCloud Backup requires that you verify your password\" repeatedly? Due to what turned out to be a (I assume unrelated) sim card problem, I recently wiped my iPhone 4, and then reinstalled from a backup.\nSince then, multiple times per day, my iPhone displays a \"iCloud Backup requires that you verify your password\" message, and then prompts for my iCloud password. If the correct password is entered, the prompt is dismissed, only to return after a few hours (I've not noticed any specific triggering action I'm performing).\nHow can I stop this prompt from appearing repeatedly?\nPresumably disabling the iCloud backup, as suggested at https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3406796 would do the trick, but I do still want the backup enabled.\n\nA: I personally had this same message. I turned off iCloud backups, then turned it back on. Settings > iCloud > Backup. While it did ask for my password the first time, it has not asked since.\nIf that doesn't work, I suggest to again, turn off iCloud backup, delete the backup, then turn it back on.\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings > iCloud > Backup, turn off.\n\n*Settings > iCloud > Storage >\nManage Storage, locate the backup, tap edit in the top corner, and\ndelete.\n\n*Settings > iCloud > Backup, turn on.\n\n\nA: You can turn it off, but then you wouldn't be able to backup.\nIf you have a Mac or PC, iTunes installed, your lightning or 30-pin dock connecter cable, a resonable amount of free space, you can backup with iTunes. It won't nag you. Plug in your iPhone, open iTunes, click your iPhone, and scroll to where it says backups, click iTunes, you can backup Health and HomeKit data, and click backup now! If it still nags you about iCloud later do this, go to Settings>iCloud>Backup, and turn it off.\n\nA: If you delete your iCloud account and start a new one it should work again.\n", "Q: Why does my iPhone turn on when I plug it in to charge? If my iPhone 4 is turned off and I plug it in to charge, it automatically turns itself on again.  Anyone know why this happens?\nIt appears to happen with all three iPhones in the house (a 3G, and 2 x iPhone 4).  All the chargers are the chargers that were bundled with iPhones.\nThe cable on the chargers range from the original iPhone cable, the original dual charger cable for the iPhone and Apple Bt headset, and the newer low profile connector cable that came with the iPhone 4.\n\nA: The short answer is: there's a better chance you want your phone ON than OFF. \nThat's why Apple chose to make it turn on whenever there's a power source available.\n\nA: Apple designed the hardware to power on when it detects charging power.\nWhen the operating system is off, the hardware still remains sensitive to the introduction of charging power. Not only does this help in cases where the OS has frozen and run down the battery past the point where available voltage can even run the system (including the charging circuitry) but it also helps in the more common case of \"my phone is dead\" and I'd like it back without having to press buttons. Depending on how long the battery self-discharged after crossing the \"empty\" line, it may need tens of seconds or even minutes of charging to get back to the minimum viable voltage. At that point, the sleep/wake button can become effective again for starting the OS.\n\nYou can of course plug in the power and then shut off the operating system phone to Charge with the OS halted. The charging circuitry runs whether the OS is running or not, and that circuitry is what kicks the OS to start when the 30 pin, lightning, USB-C or wireless charging commences while the OS is not running.\n\nA: Software and hardware failures are being cared for.\nThis is a very important fail-safe for mechanical hardware failure and has been implemented since the first editions of iPhones.\nThe Standby / Power button on the older model iPhones commonly broke, jammed, or failed eventually. The iPhone 4 & 4s models had issues with it jamming and not working anymore, for example.\nThe feature has a legitimate reason for existing beyond software, conspiracy, or theories being posted.\n", "Q: How can Siri recognize a contact's name, but be unable to call that person? My wife and I have the same problem with Siri.  In our contacts database, each person has at least one associated phone number (usually associated with 'home', 'mobile' or 'iPhone').  However, even though these numbers are the typical 10 digits used in N. America, Siri frequently will be unable to dial the number despite finding the contact and the number in the database.\nQuestion: can this be fixed without re-entering the numbers to the contacts database? What causes some 10 digit numbers (and numbers with the +1 in front of them) to be unrecognizable for purposes of making Siri-initiated phone calls?\n\nA: Believe it or not, this is often a minor activation issue–assuming the iPhone is on Sprint or Verizon. On Verizon, Dial *228 from the Phone app.  On Sprint, dial ##UPDATE# (##873283#). Follow the voice prompts, if any.  The process takes a minute or two.  After you get a pop-up message indicating the update was successful, wait another minute.  You should see your service indicator go away for a moment then come back.\nAfterward, try Siri again. This will likely resolve your text message issues too, though a restart of the iPhone (hold sleep/wake button, swipe to shut off, wait, start back up) may be necessary there.\n", "Q: How do I prevent automatic mounting of all the partitions on a flash drive? I have a flash drive that I use for various diagnostics on macs. Most of the partitions on the drive are accessible by holding down the option key on boot.\nI also have one extra partition that is not bootable and used strictly for diags after the macs OS has loaded. My challenge is finding a way to not mount all the option boot partitions when trying to use the non bootable one.\nAny ideas?\nThanks\n\nA: Borrow a trick from Apple - set the partition type to something besides Apple_HFS. The Apple_Boot partition type is used by Lion Recovery, and should provide the exact behavior you want. This process is NOT for the faint-of-heart, and you should definitely have a backup. If any of this process is unclear, DO NOT DO IT. Note that all numbers and drive names will be different on your computer.\nFirst, determine which \"BSD disk\" your target drive is.  Very likely disk1, but not necessarily. For example, this is my current system:\nbash-3.2$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *120.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh SSD           119.2 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *320.1 GB   disk1\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Secondary HD            319.7 GB   disk1s2\n\nWhat follows is a copy-paste-edit job from Dmitry Dulepov:\nWe need to change the type of this partition. This involves noting partition parameters, deleting and creating a patition with gpt. Firsts, let find out parameters:\nbash-3.2$ sudo gpt show disk1\n         start       size  index  contents\n            0          1         PMBR\n            1          1         Pri GPT header\n            2         32         Pri GPT table\n           34          6\n           40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n       409640  246725744      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n    247135384     262144\n   247397528    1269528       3  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n    248667056    1402591\n    250069647         32         Sec GPT table\n    250069679          1         Sec GPT header \n\nNext, delete and add the partition.

That is important because it tells OS X the type of the partition.\n…\nCheck if everything is ok:\nbash-3.2$ diskutil list disk1\n\nYou should see what had previously been an Apple_HFS partition should be listed as Apple_Boot.  Such partitions are bootable on an Intel Mac without being auto-mounted by a running system. Repeat this general process with each partition that you want to \"hide\" normally.\n", "Q: Searching Contacts in iOS It seems that you can only search for a name or a company name in iOS's Contacts app. You can't search for an address, a zip, a note or any text outside of those fields. The same holds true for searching in iOS/Spotlight.\nBesides the third party app for finding contacts via phone numbers mentioned before on this site, is there any way to search for an address, a city, a zip code, or a note in the Contacts list in iOS?\n\nA: Not that I am aware of.  Contact searching on iOS is particularly limited, it will only match whole words in names too when used via Spotlight, although you do get on the fly as you type results when searching directly in the app.\nNo real reason why it works this way, other than every extra piece of data that you want to search requires indexing, which requires time and space.  The search function in the iPhone doesn't scan your data for matches, this would be far too slow. Instead as you create or update data (including contacts, calendar events, receive email etc) iOS indexes certain components of the data.  With contacts, it clearly decides not to index all fields, and just does names and numbers, skipping addresses, email addresses etc.  Just one of those decisions I suppose, there is limited storage available, and we already complain when a 16Gb iPhone only has 14Gb available out of the box etc.\n", "Q: Batch conversion of xlsx to xls via CLI? I'm trying to convert a bunch of xlsx files to xls (because some other software<cough>matlab<cough> can process xls but not xlsx on the mac).\nI've tried unoconv but it has issues (which apparently stem from pyuno's shared object not being 64-bit-compatible -- even trying to override this with \n$ VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT=yes ./unoconv\n\nstill dies, this time with Fatal Python error: Interpreter not initialized (version mismatch?) which I'm surmising has to do with a mismatch between the python used with OpenOffice and the one shipped with MacOS X). \nI'm using the Microsoft-provided \"Open XML Converter\" in the meantime, but I'd really like to figure out a way to do it with FOSS tools and via the shell.  Any ideas?\nOh, I'm running on Snow Leopard if that makes any difference.\n\nA: I've not tried this with .xls(x) files per say, but I have used LibreOffice to batch convert .doc(x) files to .pdf using the convert-to option.  OpenOffice has the same options, afaik.\nCheck the help option for your app.  In my case it was:\n/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice -help\n\nIn particular, for my switch to .pdf files, I did something like this:\n/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice -headless -convert-to pdf:writer_pdf_Export *.doc\n\nThe -headless flag just prevents the whole GUI from loading.  There is likely a similar output file extension and filter (the pdf:writer_pdf_Export) for your .xls(x) case.\n", "Q: Add RSS feeds to google reader from iPad When using iPad, with Safari or some other application, once I find an interesting blog with its RSS feed, how can I add it to my google reader feeds?\n\nA: If you use an RSS reader like Mr Reader or Reeder, you can add new subscriptions using the + button on the main screen of each. \n\nA: The easiest route is to add a bookmarklet.

I have a D-Link 655 (or something close) and I want to extend my wireless network using a Airport Express and a \"powerline\" (Ethernet over main power cables).\nSo to make it clear, the D-Link 655 will be used as wifi access point in one end and I want to use the powerline to be able to use the airport express as an extender and repeater in the other end. \nWill this work provided the powerline provides a internet connection to the other end of the apartment?\nSecondly, if all this works, using the Airport Express as an Airplay unit as well as an extender shouldn't be a problem right?\n\nA: There shouldn't be any issue with using the Airport as an extender in that scenario.\nNormally an Airport can only extend the wireless network by providing a bridge over Wifi between itself and another Airport (or Time Capsule)\nUsing an Airport as an extender with a non-Apple router requires you to connect the two using ethernet, usually with a physical cable however by using a powerline connection that will replace the physical cable with the Ethernet over powerline.\nA few caveats, if you are using MAC address filtering on the ethernet interface of the devices, make sure you add the MAC addresses of the Powerline module connected to each as required.  Normally most routers only limit MAC address filtering to the Wifi interface, but there are some that will alow you to enable this on all interfaces.\nEdit: There shoudn't be any issue with using the AirTunes functionality under this scenario either as well as it providing the required Wifi extension.\n", "Q: Why doesn't my Macbook detect network after sleep? every time that my 2007 macbook with lion goes to sleep, either manually (closing the lid) or timing out, i have to restart my computer to connect to the wireless network.  It fails to detect any networks at all until I restart, then it connects to my default network no problem.  What can I do?\n\nA: Clear the network out and re-setup it.\nOtherwise, I've run into this issue before, what brand of router are you using? And does it happen with other networks apart from this one? \nRelated: Why doesn't Airport reconnect after sleep or shutdown?\n\nA: Apple claims to have addressed this issue with the OS X 10.7.3 update which, amongst other things, has a fix to:\n\nResolve a Wi-Fi connection issue when waking from sleep\n\nArs Technica reports that some people have had problems with the update but they are resolved by reinstalling using the Combo Updater.\n\nA: I also had this problem on Retina running Mountain Lion.\nAfter waking from sleep, WiFi doesn't automatically reconnect although it connects just fine when I manually select the network from the list.\nI found a working fix here, kudos to Morris for posting.\nFor convenience, I reproduce his post here:\n\nThe first step is to create a new 'Location' under 'Network Preferences' and use that as default. I have deleted all old locations, don't know if that is necessary though.\nThe second step is to follow Apple's advice in Troubleshooting Wi-Fi issues in OS X Lion and Mac OS X v10.6.\nExpand the Solution section under Symptom: The network connection drops unexpectedly and follow the steps listed under Symptom: After restarting or waking from sleep, my computer might not connect to the Internet.\nJust make sure you write down all the passwords for the networks you want to keep as deleting the keys in keychain will permanently remove them.\n\n", "Q: Prompt when sending text message as SMS instead of iMessage? Is there a way I can get Messages to prompt when it wants to send a message as SMS rather than an iMessage ?\nI hate noticing that when a message fails to send, its sent as SMS instead of imessage, which I get charged for. This happens when I activate the SEND AS SMS option.\nHowever I would still want to send a message as SMS if necessary (emergency etc). Is there an option/app/tweak that can help me accomplish that?\n\nA: This is something I wish iOS5 had. Alas, it does not - however if it fails to send as iMessage with send as SMS disabled, it will allow you to tap / hold (I forget which) and specify to send as text. \nThe main caveat to this, though, is that it doesn't 'alert' you per-se. \n\nA: Messages does give you an indicator of when a message is going to be sent as an SMS or an iMessage.\nThe recipient's name, and the send button will be in green. \nAlso it will say Text Message. in the text field where you would type your message.\nIf it is going to send it by iMessage. All of the above will be blue. And it will say iMessage. in the text field where you would type your message.\n\nA: One solution you could test is using your recipients email address.\n\n\n*\n\n*Your recipient has to have one, his iCloud address, that he used to log in (and he can add as many as he wants).\n\n*If the message is not sent, it shouldn't be sent as SMS.\n\n*You can still send message to his phone number, if you want to be sure he receives it.\n\n\nA: I found a solution to anyone wondering.\nGet a cydia app called xMessages ..

Over the weekend the behaviour of the right shift key changed in such a way that if I use it to capitalize a letter or shift a number to get '*' or '(', etc. it will randomly lose focus on the window, or jump to another part of the screen (often highlighting part of it so I end up over-typing what was highlighted (say in a text entry form such as this).\nI can really reproduce this in Terminal, just by typing ********* (and have reproduced it just now in Chrome by doing so).  This is frustrating beyond words, and I've gone through and disabled Mission Control keyboard shortcuts, I've stopped almost every program to see if something like that was reproducing it (new things installed/updated shortly before this started happening was MenuPop and iTerm2).  Initially I suspected LaunchBar (having read about oddness with the clip merge feature, which I've disabled) and MenuPop, but with both of those not running, I still get the same behaviour.  In Terminal it's the worst, but does happen randomly with other apps where I'm entering text.\nHas anyone seen this before?  Google isn't giving me much help.\nThis is a screenshot:\n\n\nA: Alright, just 'fixed' it. It's caused by that plastic divider on the Magic Wand! I guess the way it's holding the trackpad with the keyboard causes it. I've removed the plastic and moved the trackpad and keyboard in contact with each other. No more problem!\n\nA: Well, it's been a few days and the answer was most definitely the magic trackpad was what was causing this.  I cannot explain why, but removing the batteries and re-inserting them did the trick.  It's possible that it was due to a phantom mouse-event and when I removed the magic trackpad from the magic wand, and then put it back into place it didn't sit as snug as it had earlier (but I hesitate to think it was that since some apps seemed to register the strange behaviour more frequently than others did).\n\nA: Alright, so this is happening to me as well but removing the batteries didn't solve it. First, thanks for figuring out that it's interference from the MagicTrackpad rather than just the bluetooth keyboard. I was going nuts trying to fix the keyboard. However, when I turned the trackpad off, problem solved. \nThe issue I'm having is if I type anything with the right Shift key pressed, it doesn't register until I let go of the key. So, if I'm typing an entire word in all caps with the right shift key pressed, my screen displays nothing until I let go.  Really strange. \nWhen I turned off the trackpad, no problem. And I am also using the Magic Wand combo bar. I'm curious if you did anything else besides the batteries as that's not working for me.\n", "Q: How to run a downloaded run-only Applescript I am trying to run an Applescript, but when I double-click it, it tries to open Applescript editor and informs me that it was saved as \"run only\". This is fine -- I just want to run it!\nThe script in question comes from here. \nI did not write the script, I just want to run it. Looking at it with Textwrangler, I can see there are perl files and config XML files in it. The exact message I get when double clicking is, Unable to read the file because the script is not editable (it was saved as run-only).\nI have tried using chmod to set it to executable, with no luck. \n\nA: You could run it from the script menu by putting the script in ~/Library/Scripts/ and checking Show Script menu in menu bar in AppleScript Editor's preferences.\n\nA: Does the script have an .scpt extension on it? For run only, the script is saved as an application; it should have an .app extension. When it has the wrong extension, you get exactly the error message you describe.\nYou need to change the file name extension.\nThe finder can be picky about changing extensions, so choose 'get info' on the file, and type in 'thefilename.app' in the \"name and extension\" field of the window.\nClose the window, and wait for the Finder to figure out you've changed the name (takes a few seconds), then double click on the App, and it should run properly for you.\n", "Q: Upgrade Mac mini's graphic card I am doing well with my Mac, but I don't want to buy another computer for gaming, then I'm thinking on upgrading it.\nSearching in the web, I've seen that there is no way to upgrade the Mac mini's internal card, but anyone have experienced or knows if it works well with an external graphics card? \nDo you think it's worth? Suggestion for an external graphics card?\nMac mini's model is mid-2011 with 8 GB RAM.\n\nA: If your Mac mini has a Thunderbolt port (which the mid-2011 models do), you should be able to add an external graphics card when those become available. Until then, there are no external graphics adapters for Macs except the DisplayLink USB adapters that @bmike mentioned, but those won't work for gaming.\nAn external graphics card is usually PCI-Express x16 and Thunderbolt only carries an x4 signal, so you won't get full speed out of that, but it's better than integrated (or maybe even just old) graphics. (Heck, many, if not most, PC motherboards only run x8 signals to attached x16 graphics cards, so they're not using the full bandwidth anyway.)\n\nA: The graphics card is soldered onto the logic board of all of the Mac Mini with Intel chips.\nThe only sort of external graphics card that will work are USB adapters which are great if you don't need fast GPU shading / polygon fill rates and simply want more real-estate and screens rather than a faster gaming or 3D modeling performance.\n", "Q: Can I increase the resolution of a 13-inch MacBook Pro? I have a 13-inch MacBook Pro with the default resolution 1280x800. I would like to know if there exists the possibility of having a better resolution?\n\nA: There is an app named Retina Display Menu. You can find it like rdm.tar on google and it allows you to switch to whatever resolution you want on your Mac. I have a MBP mid 2012 running 1440x900 as native and it works perfectly.\n\nA: You can do it virtually using SwitchResX, but it looks really bad. I changed back within a few minutes.\n\nA: Retina Display Menu actually works perfectly, and is exacty what you're looking for.\nI personaly like to play poker, and by adjusting up the resolution I can have multiple games going on at my 13\" screen without any trouble, beforehand the desktop size was to small to allow multiple games\nhttps://roaringapps.com/app/rdm-retina-display-menu\n\nA: Sorry, no. The resolution of the display panel itself is only 1280x800, so there is no way to display more without physically replacing the panel.\n\nA: Whilst not quite for the same reason, I have displayed a higher resolution on my Macbook that it is physically capable of producing natively, by screen sharing from my macbook onto my iMac.  I've found that any increase in screen real estate is massively negated by the poorer quality of the display, which is by necessity reduced in detail in order to maintain the appropriate size.  Not worth it, in my opinion.\nWhat you can do, in an attempt to also \"fake\" the overscan method that bmike mentions, is to enable screen sharing on your local macbook, and then using a seperate VNC client, connect to yourself (i.e. localhost, or 127.0.0.1), and configure the VNC client to provide a larger overscanned/panned/scrolling display, but this is also a fudge, and can be proper irritating, especially when you consider the fixed dock and menubar that may both be hidden at any one time.\n\nA: You can just plug in a 21\" flatscreen to act as a 2nd screen using a DVI adapter. Then change the resolution of the new screen (via dock settings) to 1600 x 1400 (or similar), then you have a 13\" display plus a 21\" display. The 21\" display isn't just a scaled up 13\" picture either. You can see whole documents that you would need to scroll through on the 13\" screen. I've dragged large documents across from one screen to the other: on the laptop screen you only see half the document at any one time, on the 2nd screen you see all of it plus margins!\n\nA: you can do it as a \"devoloper\".

One for normal use and another for when I use a proxy, which I start from the command line.  It would be very useful for me to be able to switch network location from the command line at the same time.  Is this possible? \n\nA: Yep, pretty easy too.  You may need to 'sudo' the command depending on your system's configuration.\nnetworksetup -switchtolocation \"location name\"\n\nThere are some other options, too:\nnetworksetup -getcurrentlocation\nnetworksetup -listlocations\nnetworksetup -createlocation <location name> [populate]\nnetworksetup -deletelocation <location name>\nnetworksetup -switchtolocation <location name>\n\n", "Q: How do I create a custom resolution for my display in Lion, running in a virtual machine? I need to create a custom display resolution for my install of lion because it doesn't have the size I must have for a project.\nIs there a way to create a custom resolution set in lion osx 10.7?\n\nA: I'm running OSX under VMWare, and as long as you don't run the VM in full screen, Display Preferences shows the screen size as the current window size, minus any host window borders.\nWith this you can resize the window manually to get close to the resolution you require.\nThe caveat to this is that you can't \"set\" the screen size to an exact amount, but with a bit of playing about you can get the resolution within a few pixels.\nYou will need a monitor with a larger resolution as the VM window does take away some pixels, so if your monitor is only 1280 wide, you will never get a full 1280 width with this method.\n\nA: You could enable screen sharing, then connect via VNC to localhost/127.0.0.1, and set a custom resolution in the client screen.  This could be larger, or smaller than you native display, and may be set to different aspect ratios if that is what is required.\n", "Q: Random iOS Mail App Freezes? I've found myself depending more and more on the Mail app's ability to pull down mail from the servers immediately upon their arrival, and for the most part it works flawlessly.\nEvery now and then, however, the app will freeze and I won't know about it until I feel I haven't received new mail in a sufficient amount of time. Then re-launching the app, I find it's frozen. After a few seconds, it force closes, and I can re-open it.\nRe-opening it after a freeze shows me several e-mails that I'd received and interacted with at the approximate time of its last freeze, even if they're not present in Gmail anymore.\nRunning iOS 5.0.1 (jailbroken), but it did it just as much back when I ran stock iOS.\nAny idea what causes this?\n\nA: Mine did this a couple times - I rebooted it (and left it off for about 15 minutes, although this doesn't make a difference in the real world I don't think) and the issue went away - although I presume you've tried this.\nI'd try properly restoring the software back to non-jailbroken state (so you have fresh software entirely) and then (if necessary) re-jailbreaking it. Otherwise, depending on your model, restore back to vanilla setup and take it into the Apple store.\n", "Q: External monitor has \"snow\" at 1080p/i when connected to MacBook Air When I connect an external monitor to my new MacBook Air via Mini DisplayPort to HDMI, I see the extended desktop but there are snow-like artifacts. When I change the resolution to 720p, the screen looks normal.\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook: 13\" i7 MacBook Air (late 2011)\n\n*Monitor: 23\" ASUS VH236H LCD\n\n*Adapter: non-Apple Mini DisplayPort to HDMI\nI have tried other standard resolutions (1024x768 and higher) with the same effect. I have also tried toggling between 50hz and 60hz, 1080i and 1080p, each of which causes the same issue.\nI get the feeling it has something to do with my relatively cheap adapter cable, but am unsure. Thoughts?\n\nA: Likely to be the adaptor cable if it's cheap - might not be able to handle the HD throughput (although outputting to HDMI, you'd think it'd be able to). \nWhile this sounds counter-intuitive, try moving around the alignment of the second screen as this might ditch the 'snow'. \nAlso, have you tried the screen with any other HD inputs?  \n\nA: In my experience this can also be caused by something as simple/stupid as having your HDMI cable rolled up.  The EM field put out by the signal traveling through the cable can throw off the integrity of the signal itself... so, unwrap your cable if you havent already :)\n\nA: I changed the cable to the monitor buying a £8 ($12) cable from Amazon and it stopped immediately.\nThe cable prior that I was using was a Belkin one that lasted for 4 years and was 5 times the price, before the snow started and just got worse.\n\nA: You may have mirroring on.\nWith mirroring it seems to only match the resolution of your internal display (1440 x 900, native).\nThis doesn't always scale up the best to a 1920 x 1080 monitor and at 23\" you might start to see some pixelation when you zoom in.\nI noticed this on my 22\" Acer with my 2012 13\" MacBook Air.\n", "Q: Why does my iPod Classic cut off the end of certain songs? I have an iPod Classic from 2007 (Generation 5.5, 80GB hard drive). \nSomething that I've been noticing happening more and more is that some songs will play just fine but then at some point they'll just stop. The little time counter will jump to where it appears there is two seconds left in the song. And it will just sit there for several seconds and then then proceed to the next song.\nAnd what I've noticed is that it tends to happen consistently with the songs that are problematic. \nI've searched all over to figure out what might be causing this but I haven't had much lock, possibly because the symptoms are so vague (\"some songs cut off\", etc.)\nMy music collection, which is always pretty much filling the device, is 100% MP3 from a wide variety of sources (ripped, bought from Napster, etc.) and everything plays fine in Winamp on my PC so it doesn't seem as if the files themselves are completely corrupted. \nMy guess is that there is something about the files that the iPod is choking on but I can't figure out what that might be. If I'm lucky it's some weird tagging quirk (i.e., can be fixed in the individual files) but I really just don't know, and it seems to be happening on an increasing number of files, including files that played just fine before. Sometimes an entire album or artist will consist of files that cut off. \nIf this is just some known issue, do the latest iPod Classics (Generation 6, 160GB hard drives) still have this issue? I'm almost hoping that this is a sign of a dying iPod so I can upgrade :)\n\nA: The first thing to check is to see if iTunes has marked those specific songs to end early. Next, try re-encoding the song at a lower or different bitrate and syncing it to the device. Often a glitch in the file can cause iPods to skip to the next song, but the same binary file plays through on macs with better code for handling errors. Lastly, it could be error creeping into the filesystem structure on the iPod. Once you're sure you've backed up everything from the iPod, you can enter disk mode and use Disk Utility (on the mac - on Windows there are lots of disk formatting tools) to zero the drive. That will test the actual hard drive for errors and spare out any bad blocks.\n\nFeel free to edit this or comment if you find none of these helps narrow down the cause.\n\nA: This happend to me in the past with the same model you have, though I dont think its neccessarly model specific. \nThe error is coming from a glitch in the music file, try converting the file to AAC and syncing the new file to your iPod, should fix the issue. \n\nA: I just posted this to the Apple support community, but thought I'd answer here, too:\nI think I found a possible answer/solution: apparently the Nano can't handle 256kbps data rate. You need to covert the files from 256kbps to 128bps and the problem should go away.  I've had this problem with audiobooks ever since I started getting them from Audible at the higher quality bps.  At seemingly random times, the audiobook would pause for a few seconds, then continue.  It had the feel of the Nano pausing or cutting off to catch up, so I can believe that this was the problem.\nYou can convert individual songs or audiobooks by going to Advanced>Create [Format] Version. That will save both versions of the song or audiobook.\nYou can also do this globally in iTunes by going to Edit>Preferences>General>Import Settings\n\nA: I have found a bunch of these songs cut short and I thought maybe because I loaded too many songs at once. I have had a few that I checked on iTunes and they stopped at the same point. I deleted those and reloaded the song to the iPod playlist and that fixed the problem.  \nTonight though, I found somewhere the iTunes version wasn't short, just on the iPod. So I resynched and it's fixed a few songs on the iPod, resynched again and fixed some others,... \nIt's a 160GB classic that I got in 2012. I dont have any real answers but here's my experience with it. Frustrating because it seems like random songs to me. \n\nA: Are these by any chance songs you either a) purchased from the iTunes Store, or b) downloaded from iTunes Match? There was a period, a few months ago, when there were lots of downloads from Apple's servers that were truncated. I blogged about it, and got lots of emails from people who had the problem. \n", "Q: why does my print job fail? 15 page PDF, freezes on page 7 I'm trying to print a 15 page document from Lion wirelessly to my HP 1102w printer.\nThe first 6 pages print fine then it freezes half way through page 7, and I have to power the printer off/on for it to work again.  I tried printing just page 7 and that works so it doesn't appear to be the content of the page.\nI'm wondering if maybe the printer is running out of memory or something.  Is it possible there's a setting somewhere that will cause the Mac to send the document slower or something?\nAny help is greatly appreciated!\n\nA: If you think its buffer issue then try to print from page 1 to 6, then 7 to 10, then 11 to 15. You should have the options.\nIf you do not see:\n\nThen click the Show Details in the print Dialogue\n\n\nA: Never figured this out, so there appears to be no answer.  I'm adding this 'correct' answer because I don't want to look like a douche who don't indicate 'correct' answers. :(\n", "Q: Transfer my iPad to different user account on same computer? I'm trying to transfer ownership of my iPad to a different user account on a different computer. Obviously this is basically the same thing as transferring it to a new computer.\nI don't want to lose all my apps and have to remember what I had installed. I thought I might be able to make a hard backup and move it over to the other account, and wipe and restore the iPad on there, but the backup seems to persist the information about which user account / iTunes combination owns it.\nIs it possible at all to move my iPad onto a new computer without endless pain and manual work?\nThere's no option to 'transfer purchases' when I try to sync the iPad. Both are using the same Apple ID on the iTunes store.\n\nA: Why not tether the iPad to iCloud, then it doesn't need a computer at all? If you do that and turn on backups, you can then set it to manage music (or media, if you do videos too) manually, and then you can drag stuff on and off from either computer, and none of your purchases will be lost. \nWhen you plug into the new computer it might ask you to authorise your account but you can have up to five devices or something so that shouldn't be a problem.\n", "Q: Mac Mini Insists on Shutting Down When I Unplug Mouse and Keyboard I have a Mac Mini I usually use as a server, but sometimes I need to work on it. I prefer to use my keyboard and mouse on my primary computer, a laptop. These peripherals and others are attached to a USB hub, and I would like to be able to plug this hub into the Mac when I need to do something and then put it back. I can often do this (but not always) once, but inevitably there comes a time when Mac OS thinks there is a problem when I either unplug or reiplug in the hub.\nIs there any way to stop this need to reboot? I don't have room for another keyboard nor do I want to get more equipment that I will almost never use.\n\nA: In support of this, next time it happens, make a note of the time you pull the plugs out, and then when you are rebooted, run the Console application, and check your logs for the same timescale.  This should provide a handy clue.\nAlso, do you have any other devices on your USB hub that provide any more than just mouse/keyboard services?  Any card readers, storage devices etc?  These may need umounting properly before just pulling the plug and may be a part of it if you have them.\n\nA: Sounds like a kernel panic. Screen goes gray, with a box in the middle demanding to be shut down in a few languages?  If so, you likely have a bad keyboard, mouse, or hub.\n", "Q: Why do some apps only Airplay the audio? For the background info: I have an iPod Touch [4g] running iOS 5.0.1 and an AppleTV 2 running the latest software.\nI've noticed that while the majority of third-party video apps do AirPlay just fine (like Crackle, YouTube, AirVideo, etc.) there are some apps (like CNET TV, and NBA Game Time) that only send over the audio portion of the video to my Apple TV.\nIn other words, when I try to AirPlay a video it will continue showing the video portion on my local device while playing the audio on the Apple TV.\nThis seems very strange. I was wondering if this is because:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm doing something wrong?\n\n*The developers of those apps have blocked AirPlay?\n\n*The developers of those apps have not implemented AirPlay properly?\n\n*Or something else entirely?\n\n\nA: The developers of those apps have blocked AirPlay video. Though the default is to allow video streaming, individual developers can make that call for their app. Older apps (before iOS 5) will all do it, as well many released after iOS 5 came out.\nSee the developer documentation, specifically \"allowsAirPlayVideo\" here.\n", "Q: Upgraded iphone now won't sync calendars or contacts!

Lion's Mail app smoothly setup my connection to our company's Exchange server. However I cannot see the pubic folders anywhere.\nAny hints how I can integrate them into Mail?\n\nA: Krumelur\nMail.app used to be able to see Public Folders on Exchange, but no longer has this ability.\nOutlook 2011 and Entourage both support this feature.\n", "Q: Email on iPad not showing after some days After a few days my older emails on iPad2 stop showing in the inbox.\nDont find any clue where they went.\nDoes the mail program store the older emails elsewhere? How can i show all the emails and not just the newer ones?\n\nA: If you have an Exchange account or even a Gmail account configured as an Exchange account, there is an option in the email settings for Exchange to only sync up to a certain number of days worth of email. By default, it it set to 3 days. You can change this by going to Settings > Mail, Contacts & Calendars, tap on the email account in question and change the \"Mail Days to Sync\" option from 3 days to whatever you desire (I use No Limit).\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Go to:\nSettings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars\n\nScroll down to the \"Mail\" section and look at \"Show.\"  Mine is set to show the 50 most recent messages.  Maybe this is why older emails seem to disappear?  To test, try setting this to a higher value; it allows you to set it as high as 1000 messages.\n", "Q: Why does iterm2 close new sessions immediately?

I often have my MacBook Pro in clamshell mode attached to the second monitor. On my first monitor I have Windows machine and I use Synergy-Foss software to share only one mouse+keyboard between them.\nProblem is, sometimes I forget to turn on Caffeine (that prevents screen from sleeping) when I don't use Mac for a bit longer and the screen goes to sleep.\nUnfortunately mouse/keyboard activity through Synergy-Foss software isn't waking the screen. Is there a terminal command which would wake the screen?\n\nA: That sounds like your Mac is actually sleeping (suspend-to-ram) and not just turning it's screen off. If the screen was just turned off, simulated mouse/keyboard input from Synergy should wake it back up. If it's sleeping it won't, because your Mac isn't listening for Synergy network traffic when asleep.\nYou can either adjust the power save settings to only turn the screen off, but not actually go to sleep (but then you're sort of already doing that via Caffeine when you remember to) or wake the Mac via a Wake-on-LAN magic packet that will awaken it even from sleep mode, which can be sent from a command-line utility on the Windows machine.\nIf that doesn't work to your satisfaction you can also wake the Mac up in scheduled intervals via pmset (see man pmset for more information). For example, to wake up every Monday to Friday at 8:30am:\n pmset repeat wake MTWRF 08:30:00\n\n\nA: Not sure if you have already tried this but you could make the MacBook pro the synergy server, this should force it to wake up.\nI'm guessing that currently the windows machine is as ive used a similar setup with MacBook as the server and it worked okay. \n", "Q: How to eject minidisc from MBP Friends, I've by mistake inserted minidisc in MacBookPro and it seems like it is stuck.\nWhat we've already tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*shaking device, hoping the gravity will solve the problem\n\n*ejecting programmatically.\n\n\nI do realize that problem sound quite stupid, but if one have encountered this problem it would be nice to hear his story of salvation. \n\nA: Ah, the downfall of slot drives - getting a disc stuck in it when it dies :(\nAs per the comment to your question, I presume that this is a smaller CD, not an actual minidisc that is more akin to a floppy disk in a plastic case?\nOddly, some slot loading mechanisms can support these smaller discs.  For example, the Nintendo Wii is a vertical slot loader that will accept Gamecube discs that are smaller than regular CDs/DVDs.\nObviously, the MacBook won't tho.  I would recommend the use of a pair of slim \"shims\" that you can use to make a pair of tweezers with.  They would need to be both slim, but strong enough to get a grip with.  You may need to cover the ends if you don't want to risk scratching the disc.\nAlternatively, a piece of double sided sticky tape on the end of a plastic ruler may help.  Just insert an inch (don't go too far, don't want to touch the laser with sticky stuff), and wobble it up and down a bit, see if you can get contact with the edge of the disc, then slowly pull it out.  If this is tricky, try it with the drive/laptop upside down.\n\nA: I just had this problem, and turning off the laptop and gently shaking it toward the floor worked easily. No need to stick anything else into the drive.\n", "Q: What could cause MacBook battery cells to swell up? I have a problem with my 3 year old MacBook. The battery has \"swollen up\" (I could post a picture if that is of help).\nOne side of the battery is much bigger than the other. Since it no longer works, I opened it. Inside it is 6 cells covered in metal envelopes. 2 of the 6 cells are about twice as big as they ought to be.\nWhat do Apple's batteries contain? What could be the reason for battery cells to swell up?\n\nA: Apple battery packs contain a set of 6 lithium Ion (Li-Ion) cells (the metal covered envelopes), connectivity circuitry, and a small logic board.\nThe main cause for battery cell swelling is what is known as thermal runaway.\nIf a cell reaches a certain temperature then a chemical in the cell (usually Cobalt Oxide for Lithium Ion batteries) starts an unintended reaction which is exothermic in nature (i.e. it creates heat).  More heat raises the cell temparature further which causes more of the same chemical reaction\nThis creates a runaway thermal overload which can end in one of two ways, the cell and therfore the battery pack, catches fire or the reaction fizzles out with the cell in a swollen state.\n", "Q: Automator Service that does predefined simple calculations I'm working as a salesman and what I need to do a lot of times a day is calculating the price +VAT and -VAT which is 19% here in Germany.

There is an option to hide accounts that might be selected. \n\nA: Kudos to @jaberg for the hint, which let me get to the root of this. \nThis problem actualy related to my boss, who for some convoluted reason has two exchange accounts, one of which appears in the GAL, and one which does not.\nThe account that does not appear in the GAL was the one failing to sync with iCal - and lacking the power to fiddle with the GAL, I tried entering the email address of the first (GAL-listed) account into iCal. To my suprise, this allowed iCal to sync the calendar entries of the second account.\nI still need to check for any side-effects of this hack - the whole thing seems to be bugs stacked on bugs - but we've got somewhere. \n\nA: I found this problem was the Exchange password expiry. \nIf you log into the webmail version of exchange and get prompted to change your password performing this change will make your accounts work again\n", "Q: Where does MacVim keep its themes?

What am I doing wrong?\nThe file is read in without errors but the scheme doesn't change. Also, if I download alternate themes, where do they go?\n\nA: By default, you should put custom colorschemes/themes into: ~/.vim/colors\nNote that you may need to create the .vim directory in your home directory if it does not already exist.\nAfter doing so, your :colorscheme command should automatically pick up the theme.\n\nA: This is what I have in my ~/.vimrc\nif has(\"gui_running\")\n  syntax on\n  set hlsearch\n  colorscheme macvim\n  set bs=2\n  set ai\n  set ruler\nendif\n\n\nA: \nWhere does macvim keep it's themes?\n\nThe themes that MacVim ships with can be found in \n/Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/Resources/vim/runtime/colors\n\nbut MacVim will also load any custom themes you have on disk.

I have a simple network setup, and have read some initial reviews that say the new Airport Utility 6 for Mac OS X lacks some of the advanced settings that the older utility provides. I depend on those settings for my network to operate properly.\nCan I still keep the old utility around and use either tool or should I wait to upgrade until I'm sure all the bells and whistles I might need are added to the 6.0 version?\n\nI am going to need to keep the older Airport Software around since some of my devices are too old for the new software, but I'm mostly interested in knowing that I won't be forced to abandon my current advanced settings if I try the new firmware or the new client software.\n\nA: Mavericks has made some changes which means that AirPort Utility 5.x will not work. Specifically, /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Apple80211 has been updated and will break the older versions of AirPort Utility.\n\nThere are two ways to get around this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get an older version of Apple80211 and replace the one in Mavericks with it, then run the AirPort Utility binary through Terminal.\n\n*Use a modified version of AirPort Utility which includes the file in the app bundle.\n\nA: On OS older than 10.9 - you can follow these instructions. You'll want to use another answer for Mavericks and later.\nGet the upgrade (to 6.0) via Software Update. If it doesn't do what you want then download the (also new) 5.6 update that has the same UI that you're familiar with in 5.5.3 but adds the new functionality (minus the UI) found in 6.0.

But i really don't want to configure everything again :(\nThanks!\n\nA: Some apps that 'update' their dock icons with information (e.g. Mail, App Store, myriad third-party apps that might 'monitor' things such as temperature, processes, network connections) can definitely cause big resource draws. I've had the whole machine move in slow motion because of this.\nAs a result, I generally turn off any dock icon updating, or as Apple calls them, 'badges', both from Apple and third parties, regardless of nature/flavour/complexity. I much prefer my information to reside in the menu bar anyway (where possible), and it generally doesn't eat up so many resources. This way I avoid the behavior in question, that I have only ever had intermittently, not constantly like you did (obviously this is not guaranteed to be what was causing your troubles).\nYou could also try deleting the dock cache file* (at least in Lion/10.7): com.apple.dock.iconcache inside…\n/private/var/folders/**twodigitfoldername**/**crazystringalph+nums**/C/\n\nSome people just go into Terminal and type:\nsudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.dock.iconcache\n\n…however, this shows you all users' dock icon cache file. That's why I prefer to move through the GUI filesystem, because the other users' folders will be unreadable, so you can just find this through browsing/elimination. It's the only one you can actually read.\nTo get started\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure Finder is the front-most application\n\n*Press ⌘ cmd + ⇧ shift + G\n\n*Paste/type in /private/var/folders/ and click Go.\n\n\n*Note: when you update the Finder dock icon this is one of the steps included in the process for Lion.\n\nA: You could try removing all of the icons from your dock that you can and then slowly add them back until you find the app that is causing the memory leak. \n\nA: I know this post is very old, but I ran into the same exact problem.\nThe Dock tracks every single changes in the Application folder. In my case, an application was creating tons of files in the application folder which brings the Dock to its knees.\nThe only solution for me was to move the application into an other folder.\n", "Q: Where is the cron log file in MacOSX Lion? I want to troubleshoot a cron job that worked fine until a recent modification, but I can't find the cron log file, where is it?  \n\nA: By default, cron does not log output of executed jobs. It is possible to log the fact that cronjobs have been executed, but that is not the default on OS X either.\nIn order to investigate cronjob execution output, I suggest modifying your cronjob line to redirect STDOUT and STDERR to logfiles. In your crontab file or after running crontab -e, however you go about it, add something like the following to your job line:\n0 0 * * * yourcommand >/tmp/stdout.log 2>/tmp/stderr.log\nDoing this should send STDOUT (normally printed or echo'ed output to STDOUT) to a text file named stdout.log in the /tmp directory, and STDERR to stderr.log in the temp directory. Many utilities use STDERR to print special error messages out when they're application errors, and not errors generated by the program's actual execution. (You can read more about STDERR on Wikipedia.)\n\nA: Turned out when cron was running the job (as me), /usr/local/bin was not in the PATH.\nI found this by trial and error and building the job from scratch from a simple things that I knew would work and gradually added things until I found the problem.\nAbout the other suggestions and answers:\nFor some reason (at least on my machine, which is running a Lion upgraded from SnowLeopard) cron does not use the parameters specified in the plist files that launchd is supposed to read /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.vix.cron.plist or maybe cron on Lion does not write anything to stdout or stderr.\nBy the way I am using http://s3tools.org/s3cmd to sync a folder with an Amazon S3 bucket as a backup (like a primitive DropBox).\n\nA: By default, \"logging\" is not enabled.

I've just got a new iPhone and I want to sync my iPad apps between the iPhone and the iPad.\nHowever when I try to enable synchronization for apps for my iPad, it says that if I try to synchronize, all of my apps will be deleted.\n\nAm I doing something wrong? I understand that I should first synchronize my iPad apps into iTunes and then enable app synchronization for the iPhone ... but I don't want to lose the apps that are installed on the iPad in the process.\n\nA: No, you're not. The iOS device is a consumption device - every time you toggle the app sync option it will try to \"reset\"/wipe the existing apps and re-transfer them. Either leave that option on or tweak it and set your sync to Manual. \nTo sync your apps to a new device, you have to transfer as to it as a new device. Existing folder structures you had on the iPad do not transfer to phones. You cannot restore configs between different devices.\nNew phone = new setup of apps and their folders. You sync between your iTunes library and device not device to device.\n", "Q: Can I create a chat room for 3 different clients for Gtalk service?

How do you open two or more simultaneous sessions of Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection in Lion? The RDC client comes with Office for Mac 2011. I work on a MacBook Pro but have to remote into Windows servers for a number of reasons.\n\nA: Microsoft's Remote Desktop Client has two very interesting (and very un-mac like) designs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Invoking the app a second time simply raises the connection in process. You've no doubt tried to launch a \"second instance\" of the app this way, and been annoyed that it doesn't work. Don't worry, you're not alone, that's un-expected behavior.\n\n*As you see from my screenshot, it's as simple as File -> New Connection\n\nHowever, don't try and use the ⌘n shortcut. If you're connected to a remote computer then shortcuts no longer work, and in fact, shortcuts are actually completely unbound after you connect to something. That's invariably due to the fact that because most keyboard shortcuts get sent through to the remote computer.\nSo, File -> New Connection. A new icon will appear in your Dock, and you will be prompted for the remote host address. One advantage to this 'un-mac like' convention is that it's simple to switch between remote hosts with one icon per connection in your Dock.\n\nA: Check out the CoRD app. I use it for my RDP connections and it works great. Not as good as mRemote for Windows, but it'll do the job.\n\nA: I think rdesktop is the only workaround.\nYou need to switch to the \"other\" Microsoft RDP client application, identically named however it has a different icon (Incorrect one is v8.0.18, correct is one is v2.1.1. Typical dogs breakfast approach from Microsoft). \nIt can only ever have one instance, and one connection which is just retarded.\nAlso Cord doesn't support Windows NLA so thats not suitable either (CoRD_0.5.7)\n", "Q: Set constant in Pages '06 Is it possible set a constant in Pages (iWork '08, version 3.03) to be used all over the document?\nFor example I have some T&Cs where the company name and dates need changing throughout the document, rather than using Find & Replace I wanted to know if there was something like constants or variables I could use?\n\nA: You can use a Merge field.  \nThe first thing you need is a merge source.  This can either be your address book, or a numbers spreadsheet.  Ensure that the details you wish to include are available in the relevant source document.  Then enter Insert > Merge Field > Name/Email/Phone etc etc in the relevant places in your document.  This will create place markers for the relevant fields that you can populate later.\nOnce you have done this and created the fields, you can fill them in.  Click Edit > Mail Merge, check the settings and click merge, it should create a new document with the details all filled in.\nI've not tried with the numbers file route, but I have found that the easiest way to produce a single document is:  Create a contact group within Address Book, call it Temporary, or anything you like.  Create the main document as above, and save it as your template, setting the group you just made above as your merge source.  Then each time you want to create a new one for a client/contact, just move them to be the only contact in the temporary group, do the mail merge, and hey presto, a new document tailored to a single contact/client.\nFrom my limited testing just now I would expect a new document to be created for every contact in the group, but for some reason it's only doing the first contact for me, however this should still be fine for you, as you are not actually needing to do a real mail merge, just steal some of it's functionality.\nEDIT: In addition to the above, I did some more testing, if you create a template document inserting the merge fields as previously described, then when you wish to populate the fields, just open address book up, and drag a contact onto any of the fields which will be highlighted as you drag.  When you let go, the contacts details will replace the place text for the field names and you will have your document.  The benefit of this method is that should a contact change their details you can just repeat the above.  The previous mail merge actively replaces the field markers with plain text than cannot be subsequently amended in this way.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: 85W MagSafe adapter only delivers 77W? My late 2011 17\" MBP was delivered with an 85W MagSafe adapter.\nUnder heavy stress (either CPU and/or GPU) the MBP has to draw additional power from the battery in order to keep everything running. Though I can't imagine this being particularly healthy for the battery (as it keeps starting to charge a tiny bit every chance it gets, and stops again when power consumption goes up), this seems to be 'expected behavior by design', if I'm to believe the various discussions on the internet.\nWhat strikes me as odd though, is that the 85W adapter isn't actually delivering a full 85W when the MBP starts pulling additional juice from the battery. It stalls at about 77W, according to the DC In sensor. This doesn't seem right to me.. why leech power off the battery if the preferred supply has energy to spare?\nSo, in essence, my question boils down to this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is anyone else seeing similar behavior?\n\n*Does anyone measure higher throughput from the 85W adapter than 77W? (charging / leeching both maxes out at this rate more or less)\n\n*Would the adapter be actually delivering 85W, and is the DC In sensor just plain wrong?\n\n\nA: When measuring the usage of power adapters, it is important to keep in mind the efficiency of the PSU when making calculations.\nFor PC builders, it's important to ensure that you choose a suitable PSU for the components you intend to use, to ensure it's big enough etc.  As such, the rated capacity is shown as what the PSU is capable of delivering, rather than what it uses.  So, for example, a 600w rated PC power supply for a desktop computer that is rated at 80% (considered the minimum in order to get the \"80 plus\" certification) will actually use up 750w at the wall.  750W * 80% = 600W.\nFor laptops, the maths is often considered the other way around.  As you are unlikely to be putting extra drives, graphics cards, PCI cards etc in your laptop, its internal power delivery capability should be of little interest to your average user, but the external wall-draw might be.  Given that a laptop power adapter will likely be more efficient (as it is smaller, uses less power, will therefore run cooler, and require less  active cooling in terms of fans etc etc), then it wouldn't surprise me to see it up around the 90% efficiency mark.  Add to that the fact that your average laptop user should only really need to know the wattage rating when using the laptop somewhere unusual, say a plane, or some other mobile/portable power source, it may well be more useful to know the exterior power rating rather than the internal delivery rating.  Therefore, 85W at the wall * 90% efficiency is 76.5W in the laptop, and likely explains the discrepancy.\n", "Q: Web Inspector (Safari & Chrome): A/B testing changes? Is there any technique for A/B testing CSS changes made to an element in Web Inspector?\nThat is, evaluating before & after states (loaded vs changed) for a given element.\n\nA: You can do a sort of this if all your changes live in the same external stylesheet. Once you are done with the CSS tweaking, switch to the Resources panel and find the affected stylesheet resource. It should have a subtree of revisions beneath. The topmost revision is the current one, the deepest one, called \"(original)\", is the original resource version. Right-click any revision and choose \"Revert to this revision\" in the popup menu (the original version in your case). The stylesheet will get reverted and the revision with the changes will become the second-topmost one. You can revert to this revision once again to re-apply your CSS changes.\n", "Q: Does Find My iPhone use location services only when necessary? If I have location services enabled and only Find My iPhone checked, will it use my battery constantly or only if I go to icloud.com and try to locate my iPhone?\nI noticed that disabling location services saves a lot of battery but I still want to keep Find My iPhone enabled. I tried to do this but it looks like it's using location services all the time.\n\nA: The location services are only used when specifically required to do so.  You should see a small compass symbol in the menu bar when the services are being used.  You can see what apps have made use of the service recently by checking in the settings app.\nFor Find My iPhone, what happens is that the device maintains a connection much like being logged into a push mail account to the iCloud services.  This allows the iCloud service to communicate with the phone, and when you log into iCloud and request a location for the device in question, it is able to send a message to the device over this IP data connection, and request that it turn on the location based services, locate the device and report back the findings, as well as tell it to display a message, play a sound etc etc.\nSo you are quite free to leave it turned on all the time and it will only use it when you need it.  You can test this by setting yourself a reminder with a geofenced alert - if I am at work and I set an alert for when I get home to feed the cat, the icon will display constantly as it needs to know exactly when I arrive at a location, and the services and as such battery drain associated with it will also be used during that time.  Clear the reminder, and it will turn off.\n\nA: I believe if I understand how it works, it only uses power when called. You can look in your location services menu, and any purple direction arrows mean that app is currently using it. Otherwise the arrow is grey, or not there.\n\nA: I do not believe this is enabled constantly - You can confirm this by going to Settings -> Location Services -> Find My iPhone and turn on \"Status Bar Icon\". That will indicate and confirm when the service is being used.\n", "Q: Why does Image Capture crash when downloading pictures from my iPhone? image capture crashes when I try to download photos from my iPhone to my MAC. It works OK with my wifes iPhone, but not mine anymore. I don't know why as I have been able to download from my iPhone previously.\n\nA: You may have a malformed/corrupt image on your phone.  Have you tried with alternative software like iPhoto?  It may simply be a case of identifying the culprit and removing it.  \n", "Q: Why are some icons sideways on my desktop? On the current version of OS X Snow Leopard (10.6.8), I have an icon sideways on my desktop:\n\nAny idea why or what it signifies?\n\nA: It's not that the icon is sideways, it's that the small thumbnail for the file that's used as the icon needs to be wide because the CSV file has at least one really long line of data in it. The thumbnail you're seeing is a dynamic preview of the contents of the file and in the case of the file on the top of the image, the data contents demand a lot of horizontal space to show you the preview.\nHere's an example: I've created two CSV files on my desktop. One file has ~500 columns of data on one row. The other has 10 columns of data on one row. The thumbnail for the 500 column file is wide because that's what previewing the data demands.\n\nPretty smart of OS X really.\nEdit: Someone asked where the threshold for change was in the thumbnails. I did some quick experiments. I saw changes in the thumbnail dimensions at 61, 81, 101 and 121 characters of text on the one line. Note: that is characters, not columns of data. So it includes the data and the separating comma. Here is how the thumbnail icon evolved as the file contents changed:\n\n\n\n\nFor all of these snaps I just changed the length of the text on the one line in the file via TextMate and save the file, viewed my desktop and there was an updated thumbnail.\n", "Q: how do I turn free space into a useable partition? I have read a few answers to this sort of question already, but don't know how to do it. I had some problems with my partitioning, it seems the operating system has been somehow installed on bootcamp, not Macintosh HD.\nObviously Bootcamp is the bottom partition regardless of this and so when I decided I'd just delete the other partition and expand bootcamp I got left with about 70gb free space i can't seem to expand into.\nThe answer seems to be turning the free space into a new partition and going from there however, the thing I think is meant to be doing this has been saying 'modifying partition map.' for a very long time now and I don't know if it's even doing anything...?\n\nA: As far as I know you may resize MacOS Extended partitions with Disk Utility but not foreign partitions like ExFAT. One option is to use the restore facility in Disk Utility: restore e.g. on an external disk, erase and recreate a bigger partition, restore from the external disk to the new partition.\n", "Q: Are there any other iOS apps other than Mail which can send email?

In the settings for email accounts you can set up aliases. You can also set up a custom signature and SMTP server for each alias:\n\n\nWhen composing a message, by default it will be sent from your default alias. If you want to change this, tap the \"From\" in the top center and you will be able to select which alias you want this message to come from:\n\n \nSparrow is available in the App Store.\n\nA: There's a Gmail iOS app made by Google.\nYou can also use web mail accounts from Safari (I do this for temporary email accounts that I don't want to always be fetching email from.)\n\nA: Within a few weeks, you'll be able to download the brand new Sparrow iOS app. The Mac OSX version works like a charm and I'm sure the iOS version will do to!\n\nA: Sparrow is available now and is quite good for a 1.0 product.

I have a 64GB SanDisk SDXC memory card which I would like to use with my MacBook Pro and its SD card slot. However, I am having some trouble formatting/partitioning my SD card and I can't figure out what's going on.\n\n\n*\n\n*When I insert the SD card into the slot, I get the following from Lion: The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer.

But then I started using sabnzbd http://sabnzbd.org/ to download and write files directly to the SD card. Something happened (I can't remember what the error was!) and since then I've been unable to write to my card. I've been trying to format it to solve the problem, but it looks like the issue runs pretty deep.\nWhat is the best way to format the card to exFAT via terminal? That may be the next thing I try.\nDo you have any suggestions for formatting/fixing this SD card?\n\nA: The following procedure should format your SD card to make it usable again and cause bad sectors on the card to be remapped if that is part of your problem.  Warning, erasing the wrong drive could make you cry so make sure that you know what you are doing.\n\n\n*\n\n*Before inserting the SD card into your Mac, make sure that the write protect (lock) switch is turned off\n\n*Open a Terminal window and type diskutil list\n\n*Insert card\n\n*If an OS X messages pops up asking you to \"Initialize...

I already tried the second answer on this page, but every time I type su from the command prompt, it still asks for a password that I don't have anymore. Is there another way to reset the superuser password?\n\nA: The best solution for 10.7 and 10.8 is to boot in recovery mode (CMD+R). Then, open a terminal window and type the command \"resetpassword\". This will open a window which will allow you to reset any user's password.\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2011/08/24/reset-mac-os-x-10-7-lion-password/\n\nA: This answer assumes you have the login and password for an admin account within Ventura (possibly earlier version but I have not tested these).\n\n*\n\n*Login on the Mac as an admin user.

Nonetheless, you could get hold of the files in the Home Folder before the account is deleted, or even after, as OSX allows you to delete an account but keep the files in it.\nThe files will be protected, though there are some ways in which you should be able to remove the restrictions on them. You could simply use Terminal to chown the directory and all it's contents, and once you remove the permissions all the files in your previous account should be accessible to your new account. \nIf you decide to follow this method I could provide more information on how to chown the directory, though a web search should do.\nHope it helps!\n\nA: Open Terminal.app and run:\nsudo passwd root\n\nType the current admin password\nType the new password to root\nRe-type new password to root  \nDone!\n\nA: If you have an administrator user account set up on your Mac in addition to the root account, you can use the Directory Utility to do the following: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Directory Utility from /System/Library/CoreServices or in OS X 10.11 and later, System/Library/CoreServices/Applications.\n\n*Click the lock button and authenticate as an administrator:\n\n\n*Go to the menu Edit > Change root password...:\n\n\n*It should prompt you to enter a new root password:\n\nAgain, you have to have access to an administrator account to do this (so you can authenticate).\nGood luck.\n\nA: \"Change Root Password\" is only available if Root User is enabled.\nsudo passwd root command will NOT work unless Root User is enabled.

I don't think any of the previous questions on this topic cover this particular nuance, but please edify me if I'm mistaken. \nI have a Macbook Pro 15\" (the model that was released around March 2011) with Thunderbolt port. My office has two Dell monitors joined with a DVI splitter (which were originally connected to a Dell desktop). I have a Thunderbolt to DVI adapter that I was hoping to connect to the DVI splitter. However, the connector on the end of the splitter is different from the connector for a single-monitor DVI cable, so I can't plug the output of the splitter into the DVI end of the Thunderbolt-to-DVI adapter. \nDoes this mean I need either (1) an adapter to connect a \"standard\" DVI connector to a \"splitter\" DVI connector, or (2) a thunderbolt adapter that will plug directly into a splitter DVI connector? If so, do either of these items exist or am I out of luck?\n\nA: There are many types of DVI adapter, I could type a load of stuff or just point you at Wikipedia.\nThe key point is that there is no such thing as a DVI adapter.  It's just a generic term that covers the overall outline of the cable end, but what you really have is either a DVI-I or DVI-D adapter, in either Single or Dual link capability.  Or it may be a DVI-A.  Or there are others...!\nIt's possible that your splitter cable must be of the dual link types, characterised by the longer horizontal bar pin, and your Thunderbolt adapter may or may not be.  Shouldn't matter which type, either I (Integrated with analogue signal in the pins above/below the horizontal bar in addition to digital) or D (Digital only) as I imagine you are not subsequently adapting them down to DSUB further down the line, the only thing that matters is if they are both dual link.\nSo it looks like you need a Thunderbolt/MiniDisplayPort to DVI Dual link - the official apple one is the digital only one without the analogue pins (DVI-D Dual Link), and thus should work, if you are worrying that you do not have the same pinout (i.e. you have DVI-I Dual Link on your splitter, and it looks as though the analogue ones have nothing to connect to) then don't worry, it won't need them.\n\nEDIT - Additional Info\nAfter the comments, I have decided that you have a DMS-59 connector that looks like this:\n\nSo what you really need is a MiniDisplay > DMS-59 adapter, and my google-fu suggests that this is not looking like a possibility, I think you would be better served abandoning this cable, and looking for a total replacement, Mini Display Port > 2 x DVI (Single is fine, I or D if you have 2 ports).  This may also be a pain to find, and you may end up needing a MDP/Thunderbolt to Dual Link DVI, followed by a Dual Link DVI > 2 X Single Link DVI splitter cable!\n\nA: Zotac announced a displayport to dual-hdmi adapter (I think a dual DVI version was also announcted) that you could possibly use with a HDMI-DVI adpater.

I use iJam to record my guitar into GarageBand on my iPad. iJam connects via the 30-pin connector. Before long, my iPad's battery drains. Is there a way to charge the iPad and use iJam at the same time? It seems a male 30-pin to two female 30-pins splitter cable isn't so simple because I can't find one anywhere.\n\nA: The cableJive dockStubz may do the trick. Designed to extend the port in bulky cases, it features a MicroUSB port on the side to charge with older accessories that don't support charging.\nMicroUSB should also support an iPad charge, though it may be very slow. See here for someone saying they can charge their iPad with a MicroUSB adapter (admittedly officially supplied by Apple, but the point is the protocol and cable can handle it). Worst case it will say \"not charging\" and will charge in sleep, and when not charging the drain will at least be significantly slowed. You will probably need to plug the microUSB adapter into a high power USB port – ideally the iPad 10W charger itself.\nI can't guarantee this would work but, were I in your situation, I'd give it a shot and let us know. You could always return the adapter if it didn't suit your needs.\nGood luck!\n\nA: It works. I tried it and it kept the ipad charged while I used my iRig HD 30 pin connector.  The only issue I did have was that if it got even bumped a little it would come slightly loose and would not charge or worse would loosen the iRig from the ipad creating a very loud feed back and crackle.  Your best bet is a Griffin Studio Connect.  $39 from Sweetwater music.  I bought in and its terrific for home use.  If you want to use it in a live music situation I might go for Begringers iPad Dock.  Its $99 but worth every penny.\n", "Q: Terminal shortcut keys I've recently immigrated from Ubuntu to Mac OSX Snow Leopard. I use the terminal (iterm2) extensively, and I am a great fan of shortcut keys.\nThe standard shortcut keys (which work in any GUI textbox) are:\n\n\n*\n\n*⌘+← Jumps to first character in line\n\n*⌘+→ Jumps to last character in line\n\n*⌥+← Moves one word forward\n\n*⌥+→ Moves one word backward\n\n\nHow can I impose these shortcuts in iterm (or terminal)?\nAre there any standard key bindings for these operations in Mac I should know and use?\n\nA: The standard shell shortcuts (M- = meta = option or esc, C- = control):\n\n\n*\n\n*M-b and M-f correspond to ⌥← and ⌥→\n\n*C-a and C-e correspond to ⌘← and ⌘→\n⌥← and ⌥→ are bound to M-b and M-f by default on Lion's Terminal. On 10.6 you'll have to add them manually:\n\nI haven't found any way to reassign ⌘← and ⌘→ in Terminal.\n\nA: For iTerm2 you can customize hotkeys easily. A similar question was asked here\nHow can I move through words when typing a command in iTerm2?\n\nA: You'll also find Ctl-e (end of line), Ctl-a (start of line), and Esc-d (delete word from cursor) work nicely in terminal and other apps, too (along with Ctl-k and Ctl-y mentioned above), as does repeat-letter (Esc-NNN d; Esc-22 d for example to output 22 letter d's).

I'm a windows user looking to make the jump across.  I have narrowed my choices to Mac mini or Macbook Air.  Looking at the tech specs I don't fully understand the sound hardware.  I use speech recognition extensively is there a clear favorite between these two when it comes to specifically looking at that use case?\n\nA: I believe I am correct in saying (without a Mini to cross check against) that they both (along with all the Mac lineup) use the integrated Intel HD audio chip, and as such there should be no real difference between the 2.\nI would say that you limiting factor would be that the Mini does not have an integrated microphone, whereas the Air does, so you will need to bring your own mic.  Also, neither have separate mic input/audio output ports, and require you to use something like an iPhone headset (modified 3.5mm audio connector with both channels on the same connector), which may not provide the quality (or comfort) you need.\nSo, on the Mini, you will need to buy a headset in order to get mic input, and if you already have one you may need to replace it with a USB one or iPhone one.  On the Air you're good to go unless you are already a regular headset user, in which case you may beed to replace if it uses 2 discrete connectors for headphone/mic.\n", "Q: Does 4th gen iPod Shuffle comes with iPhone earphone that has mic and volume buttons? My iPhone earphone went bad today. I need an iPod shuffle too for jogging, so I wanted to buy one. I'm wondering if it actually comes with the same earphone as the one that iPhone comes with?\nBonus: What does this mean:\n\n\nA: It certainly does't come with the same ones at the iPhone, which are characterised by the 3 button inline controls & mic\nChecking with a touch I bought recently, it seems it came with just plain old earphones.\nPrevious models of the shuffle had the full inline controls on the headphones, but this was due to the lack of controls on the actual device.  They took some stick for that decision, and since reverting to the old shape they no longer do this, and as such I think they have also reverted to using standard headphones.\nAs for your picture, I think it means that the headphone connector, unlike on the iPhone/iPod touches/Airs etc, is a normal 3.5mm headphone only adapter, without the extra internal pinout to support a mic.  The mic is now actually located on the shuffle itself, thus not requiring you to need a headset to use the voiceover functions - check the tiny hole next to the headphone socket:\n\nSo it means that while the headphones will still work if you use iPhone headphones, or any of the other headset style ones with inline controls, the mic will not be used, and the one on the device will always be used, although it seems the remote functions for volume and next/back might be available.\n", "Q: Can I save an HTML file to my iPhone and open in Safari? Does anyone know if its possible to save an HTML file to your iphone and then open it with Safari so that you can then favourite it and have it appear on the launcher as an icon?\n\nA: I do it using the 'Notes' app on my iphone.\nQuick and free download. \nI emailed the file to myself, then opened it on my phone via email. \nInside the email, I clicked the html file.\nThis opened it. I then clicked the download button on the top right of my particular iphone. After that I clicked \"Add to Notes\". \nInside the notes app, my html file is there and also all functions work as there is also javascript involved. \n\nA: Once the page is opened on your iPhone all you have to do is tap the Sharing icon, middle icon on bottom, and select 'Add to Home Screen'\nIf you want to load an html file that you've created on you Mac to your iPhone you'll need to do the following. From System Prefs > Sharing > Enable Web Sharing. Place the html file in your ~/Sites folder. Go the the URL listed in the Web Sharing panel from your iPhone, while on the home network, and open the html file. It will load in Mobile Safari.\nIf you want this to stay on your iPhone you'll need to have the page written in html5 and have a properly setup CACHE MANIFEST. This includes the appropriate tag in the html file and have the proper manifest file. Then you can follow the first step and add it to your home screen and always have it on your iPhone.\n\nA: I just put the HTML file in my DropBox and then opened it in my iOS DropBox app and then touch the ThreeDots and MakeAvailableOffline. It then opens thru the DB app while I am in airplane/offline or outside cell coverage.\n\nA: HTML file I'm assuming you are talking about some pages on the web.\nIf so yes you can by pressing on the:\n\nand you will have the icon on your homescreen to use it next time.\nBut for your information this is not the actual saving of that page it just like a favorite bookmark icon which can make you easily access to that page with a touch!.\nBut if you want to really save that page in an offline mode then you have to jailbreak your phone and get a tweak from Cydia which will give you an option to save it as an offline to open it next time.\nAnd last thing if I was wrong for the above answer. And you were talking about actualy HTML code page and you want to save them and open to view the code [Source codes]\nthen you probably need an app from appstore [or even from cydia] or tweak from cydia to do that otherwise you can't. \n\nA: The only way I know of without jailbreaking is to use Dropbox. \n\nA: What works for me is to actually save the desired web page as a Web Archive from within Safari on the Mac, then have this file emailed to myself. On the iPhone, the only software I have that managed to open this Web Archive file successfully is GoodReader. \n\nA: I've done this using Microsoft OneDrive to generate a URL for an uploaded file. iframe embed code can also be used to display and interact with an Excel spreadsheet online.\n\nA: To get the Page to your Phone there are a lot of ways to do this. You can use any Cloud Drive App you like (iCloud, OneDrive, Dropbox) it will also Work via Mail or if you have an App that Supports in App Transfer via iTunes etc.\nTo open/view thre Page you can use any HTML Editor App on the Phone but i have found none of them beeing able Preview the Page in Safari all of them had their own HTML Preview.\nA Second Downside is that if you are somehow able to Preview the Page inside of Safari from within an App the actual File of the Page is just put to a temp Folder and when you exit the Editor App the File will get deleted.\nNow if you later open the Page again over the in the Homescreen saved Icon it won't work cause it isn't there anymore.\nIf you don't mind opening a App before opening the HTML File you can use one of the Editors or even GoodReader which can also handle HTML Files.\nIf you really need it to be a Icon i recommend you to write a Simple App with Just a UIWebView in it which displays your Page.

Like many others, the number of photos that we are storing these days is growing.  Also, we have multiple iPhoto libraries on various computers.  \nSo it makes sense to consolidate photos into a single library on an external drive and have every computer reference this library.\nFor starters, I moved the biggest iPhoto library to the external drive.  Then, using the hold-down-option-button method, I changed the referenced iPhoto library for the iPhoto app.  Aside from some expected extra latency, all seems to work.\nThe problem lies when I attempt to attach a photo to an email or upload a photo to the website.  The file chooser dialog's media browser does not seem to work with with the new iPhoto library location.  In other words, when I go to the Media section and select Photos, I do not see my photos.\nIs there some extra step that I am missing?  Or does the media browser only work with local files?  I cannot seem to find the answer to this question, though I know many will probably run into this.\nI am currently using the iPhoto Library Manager to rebuild the iPhoto library, however it is taking a long time.  I'm uncertain whether it will even work once its completed; probably should have tested with a tiny library to see, but I didn't.\nAny help or references to resources would be appreciated.\n\nA: Couple of things: \n\n\n*\n\n*What format is the external?  iPhoto needs to have the Library sitting on disk formatted Mac OS Extended (Journaled). Users with the Library sitting on disks otherwise formatted regularly report issues including, but not limited to, importing, saving edits and sharing the photos.\n\n*Is that a wireless connection to the disk?  A strong warning: If you're trying to edit the Library (that is, make albums, move photos around, keyword, make books or slideshows etc.) or edit individual photos in it via Wireless be very careful. Dropouts are a common fact of wireless networking, and should one occur while the app is writing to the database then your Library will be damaged. Simply, I would not do this with my Libraries. \n", "Q: How can I make a keyboard configuration become default when I hook it up? At work, I have a MacBook Pro and a RHEL workstation that share a HP keyboard and mouse via a KVM switch.

This is working just fine.  The Time Capsule is upstairs and needs to remain there.  I recently bought a TV that has Internet capabilities if connected by a LAN cable to the Internet.  I do not want to run a LAN cable from the basement to the upstairs.\nI also happen to have an unused AirPort Express Base Station lying around unused.  What I would like to do is plug in this Base Station next to the TV in the basement and run a LAN cable to this Base Station to the TV.\nMy question: Can I set things up so that the Base Station receives WiFi signals from the Time Capsule?\nI've found hints on how to do this on the Internet.  What I really need are detailed steps on how to do it.  I don't want a bunch of options in setting this up, I just want one straightforward path on how it can be done.\n\nA: I do not have an Airport express (or Time Capsule...), but the method is not as scary as you might be worried about.  First, setup your wireless network on the Time Capsule, make sure the settings with regards to B/G/N etc are ones that your Airport Express can read (you don't mention model numbers), so ensure you are not using N only if your Express cannot do N also.  Network mode should be \"Create a Wireless Network\".  Then, on your Express, set the mode to be \"Extend a Wireless Network\" - it will list the networks it can see (that it is capable of extending, hopefully), and with luck you will find that they are within range of each other.  You just need to apply the same settings re passwords and security etc here, and hey presto it should repeat the same wireless network, thus extending it's range.  The network settings tab within Airport Utility should be greyed out, as the device should just be passing on what the Time Capsule presents, and it's not capable of overriding them.  Anything you subsequently plus into the ethernet port should effectively drop you into the same LAN, using Wireless connection between the TC and AE to allow communication from your telly to the internet.\n\nA: I do exactly that at home.\nI setup the TimeCapsule:\nWireless ->\n\n\n*\n\n*Network Mode: Create a wireless network\n\n*Wireless Network Name: SomeName You create yours.\n\n*Wireless Security: I would recommend WPA2\n\n\nAnd the Airport Express:\n - Network Mode: Extend a wireless network\n - Wireless Network Name: SomeName You use yours.\n - Wireless Security: Use the same parameters\nAfter this it should work... You might have to adjust your internet settings though.\n\nA: When using any wireless router/device to extend a network you must use EXACTLY the same security method AND password on the remote device as is set on the main router. You must also ensure that the remote device is set to bridge mode ie. that it is not handling the distribution of addresses by DHCP for example.\n", "Q: How do you prepare or secure your Mac for the possibility of being stolen?  I'm using the great applicaton Prey which hopefully never has to get used, but just in case, I want to be prepared.\nSo basically I have a request for password after sleep/screensaver enabled, but that would propably lead the thief into the direction of re-installing the OS X, all my data would be gone and Prey would be useless.\nTherefore I created some other users without a password, so the thief can use the Mac anyway and herewith send me some signals so I can receive his location and all that good stuff.\nMy problem basically is just that he still can see some Applications, which I can restrict, but the user will see them anyway and get the idea that they aren't full users, so the thief still might have the idea to reinstall. I basically want to make the thief as comfortably in my OS X as possible without giving anything away. What did you guys do? How do you prepare your Mac for the use with Prey ??\n\nA: My preparation doesn't answer all of your concerns because my priorities are different. I place a higher value on data security than I do on the Macintosh itself. Tracking software doesn't assure the recovery of a stolen laptop. If you're concerned about the cost of hardware your best protection is an insurance rider specifically covering the theft of your computer gear. \nSo with that qualification, here's my list:\n\n\n*\n\n*A reliable, robust backup system that works from any location that has an internet connection  and archives data to an offsite cloud server. I use Crashplan Central. When I'm at my desk, I also make daily system clones to a local drive using SuperDuper!\n\n*Set a firmware password for the Mac to prevent unauthorized booting from alternative startup drives. Warning: If you set this password, don't lose it. \n\n*Encrypt the hard drive using  FileVault (2).\n\n*Use a strong password for login.\n\n*Set  a short idle interval to lock the screen when computing in non-secure locations. I consider my home, office and most client sites to be secure and I use a longer interval. If I'm traveling or working in a public place I set the screensaver/lock to activate after one minute of idle time. . Regardless of location, I am in the habit of manually locking the screen from the Menubar when I walk away from the computer. \n\n*Activate Find My Macintosh via your iCloud account. Don't expect to get your computer back, but it can't hurt, and it will allow you to remotely erase the data from your computer if necessary. I've used this feature to locate a computer that I'd left in a client's server closet.\n\n*Develop a workflow that lends itself to getting back to work on a replacement computer quickly. I minimize the applications I use regularly so there are fewer to install and purchase apps from the Apple App Store when possible so they're easy to install from a single source, even from the road.  I use DropBox to store current projects. When needed, older projects are available to me remotely by logging into CrashPlan.\n\n\nIn addition, I carry a mini flash drive in my (real) wallet that has a recent copy of my Password Wallet file and a few other \"key\" data files. I keep this up-to-date using an Automator action that runs whenever that flash drive mounts on the system.  The current copy of the passwords file is also on my iPhone, iPad and on Dropbox..  \nMost of all, I try to maintain situational awareness to minimize the likelihood of theft. Even so, my laptop sits unguarded in hotel rooms and offices all the time, yet I rest easy because I've taken the necessary steps to secure my data and implemented plans for a rapid recovery.\nOne more thing… I have my contact information (phone number and email) displayed on the login screen of my MacBook Pro and the lock screens of my iPad and iPhone. Perhaps I'm naive, but I believe the greatest risk is loss, not theft.\n\nA: Great question, this is all essential info every mac/laptop owner should know. In addition to the excellent advice offered I'd like to add that you can use a Kensington lock to attach your mac to an immovable object like so:\n\nIt may not be perfect to avoid a determined thief, but it can still be a deterrent in public places like hotels, libraries, cafes etc..\nYou might also be interested in reading how hackers are doing it.\n\nA: The first thing to do is go to System Preferences » Security & Privacy and enter your name and phone number in the \"Show a message when the screen is locked\" field. That will give someone who finds your computer a chance to return it to you.\nTo address the specific issue that you raised about Applications:\nYou can install the Applications to ~/Applications (that is, create an \"Applications\" folder inside your home folder) and install apps there instead.\nNote that the Mac App Store will automatically install apps to /Applications but you can easily relocate them. You could even automate the process using Hazel or something like it.\nOther ideas:\nlaunchd is your friend. You can create scripts or programs which will run whenever anyone is logged into your computer, or you can do the same for when specific users log in. For example, create a new Gmail account and create a script which will send the IP address of your computer every 15 minutes:\ncurl -s http://whatismyip.org | Mail -s \"$HOST address as ofdate\" yournewaddress@gmail.com\n(Note: you will have to setup your Mac to send email from the command line. I wrote a HOWTO for that.)\nDynDNS is another good idea. That will give you a hostname to use with ssh.  (Be sure that \"Remote Login\" is enabled via System Preferences » Sharing.) Make sure that it works (i.e. daemon runs/updates) while you are logged into your 'dummy' account.\nMy Preference\nI set a Firmware Password on my Mac so they can't boot from another drive (i.e. trying to wipe it) without entering a password. \nI use FileVault 2 (Lion) to encrypt my drive. They only get access to Safari. See Can FileVault 2 and Find My Mac foil thieves? for more details (I didn't write that, I just recommend it).\nIn sum: I do as much as I can to protect my data, and I do as much as I can to give someone the opportunity to return it if I lose it and they find it (vs being stolen).\nI have thought about (but have not actually checked to see if it can be done) going to a jeweler and asking to see if they can inscribe my name / phone number on the bottom of my MacBook Air.\nThose are my thoughts, FWIW.\n", "Q: Does iOS now delete text messages on iPhone without warning? It appears that my iPhone 4s have silently and completely by itself deleted a number of messages from the beginning of this 2012. In the place of a longer messaging thread, there's now a load more messages button in the affected text conversations, but it doesn't actually load the previous message history. \nI am nowhere near any sort of limits storagewise, so I don't see why the iPhone would perform any housekeeping on its own. Digging into this, it appears that only the conversations using iMessage have been cleared out but not the ones that only transfer via SMS.\nIs this a known behavior that is either documented officially by Apple or currently an undocumented feature?\n\nA: Have you changed any of your iMessage details in that time frame? \nAs I understand it, if anything changes in your iMessage settings (for instance, removing a 'receive at' or changing the account you use, your phone will purge all of the messages it no longer thinks belong to it (as, I suppose, you would expect). However, I added an email address to mine fairly recently and all my iMessage history with my mum vanished. \nI would check with the other party and see if they still have the record - if so, then your phone has elected to purge it and probably thinks you don't need it. If not, is there a time limit on iMessage storage on Apple servers? (seems unlikely and that shouldn't cause it to purge from the phone).\n\nA: Yes and no.\nYes - there appears to be a feature where the messages app will not initially draw older messages based on some combination of time and activity where it used to show everything more reliably. \nNo - In all cases I've seen, messages are not deleted due to this feature so it's hard to know why your \"load more\" button is displayed, but doesn't actually retrieve more messages.\n\nFor example, I have SMS and iMessage conversations that exist in the app from 2010 and 2011. Some conversations started as SMS and moved to iMessage in October 2011 and haven't been shortened with the \"load more messages\".\nFrom my usage - all of the older conversations that are not more than 10 or 20 items in the history are all presented perfectly on iOS 5. Only conversations (both SMS and iMessage) with more than 30 or so messages have the display shortened and the option to ask for more messages to be loaded on demand.\nI'm fairly certain that all the messages are still stored - just not rendered and taking space on the view until you ask for more content.\n\nI have never had a problem with iMessage deleting messages on me due to no space or other considerations - but I do use PhoneView to periodically archive both my messages and other contents (voicemail, call history) to a Mac since keeping this history is something I prefer to have.\n", "Q: Can I have different Apple IDs on my iPhone 4S? iCloud has an Apple ID:\nSettings > iCloud \n\nMessages has an Apple ID:\nSettings > Message > Receive At\n\nStore has an Apple ID:\nSetting > Store\n\nDo these all have to be the same ID?  If not, which ones can be different?\nOr to ask this question a different way... \nMy wife and I both have a 4S.  Can we share the same ID for iCloud (calendar sync) and Store (app sync) but not for Messages (distinct text identity)?\nTIA\n\nA: Each place you mention is separate so you can use a unique Apple ID in each. Other than the App Store / Music Store where you can only enroll 10 devices in a 90 day period), you can use one account on many, many devices.\nIn addition, the iCloud account that is entered into iCloud does control Photo Stream, Documents and Backup for the entire device.\nYour additional iCloud accounts can be entered into Mail, Contacts, Calendars to have additional:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mail\n\n*Contacts\n\n*Calendars\n\n*Reminders\n\n*Bookmarks\n\n*Notes\n\n*Find My iPhone\n\n\nA: You can both use separate IDs for iCloud—email, calendar and backups—and still share a calendar. iCloud allows you to share calendars with other members on read only or read/write basis. iMessages can be tied to your iCloud Apple ID or phone number. \nYou should both use the same Apple ID for iTunes store purchases so you can share media and app purchases. \n\nA: To answer your first question, you can have separate ID's for iCloud / Messaging and iTunes\nYour iCloud and iTunes store Apple ID can be different and I am using that configuration.\n\nA: So we have ONE iPhone5 between 2 of us. My wife has her APP store id associated with the iPhone. It appears only one APP store id is allowed per iPhone device. It would be nice if I could logon to the APP store with my Apple ID on this iPhone, without her losing her application information.\nExample: APP X has information sent only to me on my macbook. APP X has an APP Store application that we can load onto our one and only iphone5. But if we load APP X's APP store application onto our iphone5, the information sent to me will not be displayed nor coordinated with APP X's APP store application.  \nApple should really allow 2 different APP store ID's to be used on one iPhone. The users could then logon to the other ID to load up other app's!    \n", "Q: What functionality does the in built Mac speech recognition have? At the moment I use windows speech recognition which is quite good out of the box.  Specifically, I find it quite good for the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*List item \n\n*Dictation for emails \n\n*Macros for programming \n\n*Mouse clicking and dragging \n\n*Spelling character by character for command prompt/unix\nshell\n\n\nDoes the in built speech recognition support all of the above?\n\nA: Speech does support dictation, menu item and button selection, and some programs have \"speakable items\" for their own features.\nIt doesn't natively support the rest, but you can write scripts or Automator workflows to do what you want, and make them \"speakable\". When you've finished writing the scripts, use Speech to \"Make this speakable\" while each file is selected in the Finder, one at a time. This will put an alias in the Speakable Items folder, so make sure you put them somewhere where you won't then rename, move, or delete them.\n", "Q: What is Boot Camp? Is Boot Camp some sort of virtualization system, or will it run Windows 7 on a Mac the same way it runs on a Dell or an HP machine? I need to run Visual Studio in Windows 7. and I need it to work smoothly.\n\nA: Bootcamp allows you to install and run Windows 7 natively on your Mac as if it were just any other PC.\nIt allows you to co host a Windows installation on the same drive as your Mac OS one, allowing you to dual boot.  In addition to being what is effectively a simple boot manager, it includes a full package of drivers for all your integrated peripherals like the trackpad, FaceTime camera, odd Mac keyboard layout etc etc, that makes it easier to use without having to struggle getting things to work.\nIt does not allow you to virtualise Windows to run within Mac OS, but a handy side affect is that many virtualisation tools such as VMWare Fusion and Parallels desktop  will open your bootcamp partition as if it were a virtual machine, allowing you access without a reboot at the cost of performance.  Booting directly into windows via bootcamp should be just as fast as on any comparable spec PC\n\nA: From the Apple KB doc:\n\nYou can run the Windows operating system on your Mac at native speed--without the performance penalty that comes with software emulation or \"virtual machines.\" Windows applications have full access to multiple processors and multiple cores, accelerated 3D graphics, and high-speed ports and networking such as USB, FireWire, Wi-Fi, AirPort, and Gigabit Ethernet as well as drivers for audio and Bluetooth. \n\nSo, to answer your question, no, Windows is not virtualized on your computer through Bootcamp, but actually running natively on your hardware. You shouldn't have any problems with running applications on Bootcamp. However, your hardware may not be supported for that application, so you may need drivers.\n\nA: \nIs bootcamp some sort of virtualization\n\nNo.\nBootcamp is a multi boot utility. You use it to create a windows partition on which you install Windows 7 like any PC.\n\nA: Up till now, most Windows-based computers have used what is called the BIOS, or Basic Input Output System, to launch the operating system. The BIOS detects the Windows bootloader, then puts it into memory to start up Windows.\nIntel-based Macs have never had a BIOS. Instead, they have the more advanced EFI, or Extensible Firmware Interface, to perform the same task. \nThe BIOS and the EFI are not compatible with one another, which is why OS X will not natively boot on a PC, and why Windows shouldn't be able to boot on a Mac. \nHowever, you can boot Windows on a Mac. This is thanks to Apple's Boot Camp. Boot Camp is a set of tools, including a set of drivers, a partitioner, and, most importantly, a BIOS simulator. The Boot Camp BIOS simulator is written into the EFI, and it allows the EFI to act like a BIOS and boot up Windows for installation on Intel-based Macintosh hardware.\nYou can access Boot Camp by going to Applications->Utilities->Boot Camp Assistant. It will take you step-by-step through the process necessary to run Windows natively on your Macintosh hardware.\n\n", "Q: How do I show if I am the BCC'ed recipient in Mail.app? I recently received an email from a collaborator in which I was the BCC (Blind Carbon Copy).  The original \"To:\" recipient was another collaborator who has a very similar email address to mine.  Because of the similarity in addresses, and because I didn't see anything indicating I was a BCC (even in the detailed header information), I responded back to the original sender and the \"To:\" recipient pointing out the \"mistake.\"\nObviously this defeated the whole purpose of being BCC'ed by the original sender.\nIs there a way in Mail.app to show if I am the BCC of an email?

I am unsuccessfully sending a file from my smartphone Huawei Ideos X5 with Android 2.3.5 to my iMac. I paired the devices successfully. Android phone receives successfully anything from iMac, but iMac cannot receive anything. I disabled my firewall and disabled the stealth mode too but still problem persists.\nHow can you make iMac able to receive a file by Bluetooth from Android smartphone?\n\nA: Provided you have done what Vlad said (enable the Bluetooth sharing) and paired the devices (which you seem to have done), I have absolutely no problem to send files via bluetooth using my Nexus-S. I have ICS 4.03 now, but I had 2.3.x (where X is 3, 4, 5 and 6 if I'm not mistaken). \nOnce you have the devices Paired, if the Mac is in range and with BT enabled, the phone can send files because the Mac should be on the phone's list of paired devices. I recall that in 2.3.x sometimes it won't work, but retrying to turning on/off BT was usually enough.

My iPhone refuses to switch over from WiFi to 3G when the WiFi signal gets too weak to be usable. It will sit there indefinitely, unable to load a web page because I'm too far from the router, and not switch to the strong 3G signal that is available. Has anyone else had this problem? Is there anything I can do about it? Would it be better if I bought an Apple router? Do Android phones do this? I already submitted a bug report to Apple. It seems like such a simple thing to switch to 3G when WiFi stops working.\nI know how to switch manually, but that's not a good solution. I think it's an iOS bug. I don't think it's the router's fault either, because the phone should be the one to determine when to switch to 3G. It should happen when WiFi fails to respond for a certain amount of time. I have a high-end Linksys router and an iPhone 4S. Router works great with all other devices and iPhone works well besides this one problem. This only happens when I'm outside my house and the router signal is no longer strong enough for data to get through. Once I go far enough down the street the signal switches to 3G, but there's about 30 yards where it hangs onto WiFi even though it can't get anything through. \n\nA: The expected behavior is probably for the phone to stay on WiFi as long as it can connect, and then switch to 3G; as of iOS 5, I don't think the capability is there to automatically notice a dead WiFi connection and switch to 3G.  So what you're seeing is perhaps a lack of functionality, but it's not strictly speaking a bug.\nI can't really see Apple making that the default functionality, though.  They'd get a lot of flak for making the iPhone too smart; nerds would complain that they don't have control.  If it was done, it would probably be an option.\nIt also would be very difficult to do well automatically.  How does iOS know a connection is bad?  What exactly does \"when WiFi stops working\" mean?\n\n\n*\n\n*Lack of public internet access?  Windows 7 (and maybe Vista) does this by requesting a text file from Microsoft's website with predetermined content; that's how it knows if your connection has internet access or not.  But what if you're on a network at work that only offers access to intranet sites, and not the public internet?\n\n*Lack of data transfer despite network requests going out?  What if you're repeatedly trying a site that's experiencing a lot of traffic?  How many repeated failed requests mean a bad connection?\n\n*Long response times for outgoing requests? How long is too long? It could be averaged over time, but where's the threshold?\n\n\nIt could probably be done, but it would be difficult to do well, and the gain in widespread user satisfaction probably isn't that huge in comparison to other things.\n\nA: I had the same problem, and I contacted a technician from my Service Provider since Apple wouldn't want to help me because the warranty on my phone had expired. The technician guided me through these few options. If the 1st one doesn't work go to the 2nd and so on. I had to go all the way to number 4 before it worked. \n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your 3G network is ON.\nGo to Settings → General → Cellular → Enable 3G: ON.\n\n*If #1 is OK, try switching ON the \"Airplane Mode\" for about 10 seconds and then turn it back OFF.\nGo to Settings → Airplane Mode: ON,  wait 10 seconds and turn OFF.\n\n*If #2 doesn't work, reset the network settings.\nGo to Settings → General → Reset → Reset Network Settings.\n\n*If #3 doesn't work, back up your iPhone using iTunes or iCloud and reset your phone to the factory setting:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up using iTunes: Plug your phone to your computer and open iTunes. Click on the \"File\" icon on the upper left corner go to \"Devices\" and select the Back Up option.\n\n*Back up using iCloud: Go to Settings → iCloud → Storage and Backup → Manage storage → Delete the backups that appear there by tapping them and selecting Delete Backup.\nOnce you have deleted the old backup, go to Settings → iCloud → Storage and Backup → Make sure iCloud Backup is turned ON then tap Back Up Now.\nOnce your iPhone is backed up, you can reset your phone to factory settings.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset using iTunes: Plug your phone to your computer and open iTunes. Click on iPhone in the upper-right corner. It will open your iPhone information. Click on Restore iPhone and follow the instructions.\nOnce your phone is reset, go to File button in the upper left corner and go on Devices and click on Restore from Backup. Your phone will then restore from the last iTunes backup.\n\n*Reset using iCloud: Go to Settings → Reset → Erase all Content and Settings. When your iPhone restarts, tap Restore from iCloud Backup. Connect your device to WiFi and enter your Apple ID and password.\nIf these steps don't work for you, contact your service provider as you might be in a 'dead zone' for 3G. They will ask you for your Zip Code or Postal Code and verify what's going on. They might even give you another option that they didn't need to give me since the #4 worked for me.\n\nA: It does not know if Wifi \"works\" or not.  Simply the signal strength.  Just manually turn off wifi when the signal becomes unacceptable.\n\nA: It's a bug, plain and simple. The phone should route your traffic thru the best connection. It does this well when you are in 3G and it finds wifi then gives you that better route. It just has a lousy algorithm to switch back to 3G or LTE. In some cases LTE is better than wireless so apple has some work to do here.  \n\nA: Try switching iphone messaging off in Settings Messages but leave MMS Messaging on - then the phone will thinks its a phone and not a computer.

I had an old iPod with the same account that it would all sync onto fine, however, when I try to sync it to my iPhone, nothing happens. The songs are definitely in my iTunes library. I have the settings for my iPhone to sync all songs when plugged in to the computer.

When sending iMessage to more than one person, you create a group chat, and everybody will be able to see all the conversation.\nTo actually send an MMS/SMS, you can disable iMessage in the Settings before sending the group message, then re-enable it later.\n\nA: Unfortunately, this is something that you cannot change in iOS. There is a Group Messaging switch in Settings > Messages, but my experience has been that it does practically nothing.\nOne thing you can do that still isn't as fast as one single text to a number of people, but is faster then re-typing it, is forward the texts. Write one text, tap the Edit button in the upper right corner, tap the text you just sent, then tap Forward.\n", "Q: How do I access the user Library from a Time Machine backup? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do you access the user library on a time machine backup \n\nI need to access my library folder in a time machine backup that is from a different mac.\nHow can I do this?\nThe real problem is that I backed up with time machine, reinstalled the OS and when I tried to put everything back I ran into problems.

I was able to right click on the time machine icon and browse what is in the backup file - thus manually restoring all of my data, however, without having access to the library folder there are many things I am unable to copy over.\n\nA: The Library folder is probably just hidden by Finder.

Is it pretty much done? My old iPhone 3Gs got dropped into water (completely submerged for a second or two).  When I took it out, the screen was barely visible.  Then it went off completely, but it appears from time to time (barely visible though).\nOddly enough, I can still sync it to iTunes.\nIs the phone pretty much done or can it be repaired?  Obviously the warranty is long over.\n\nA: When this happens don't turn the device on or try to sync it right away. Instead, remove the battery (if possible) and put the device into a sealed bowl that's half full of uncooked rice, crystal cat litter (make sure it's pure crystal) or the desiccant crystals often sold in garden centers. These will all draw the moisture from the device and absorb it. \nLeave the device in the sealed bowl for at least 24 hours. 48 is better, but you might want to check/change the rice after 24. No need to bury the device either--just rest it on top or suspend it on a block of wood, a couple of dowels, or whatever else you can one up with. After 48 hours inspect the device.  If you think it's dry go ahead and test it. \nNo guarantees, but with luck you'll be pleasantly surprised. \n\nA: Actually, water is not the issue; it's the contaminants in the water coupled with long drying times in enclosed spaces with narrow gaps that does the most damage due to corrosion. \nTo be completely successful against corrosion, you need to CLEAN or flush the contaminants out. Working against this is the competing problem of water damaging some of the elements like the battery or causing an electrical short.\nRemove the screen and LCD off your 3GS, and place the rest of the phone (without screen) in 99% isopropyl alcohol. Alcohol will damage the LCD, so that's why the removal is necessary. \nAlcohol is NOT conductive (neither is pure water), it will chase the water & debris out (ever had swimmers ear?) and evaporate much faster.\nWorks every time, as long as you didn't plug in or keep turning in the phone prior. \n\nA: If it's still dripping wet and the water it fell in wasn't clean (or worse, was salty), and you have distilled or deionized water handy, don't turn the device on, but promptly redunk it in distilled water to flush out any contaminants before they start drying on the internal circuits.\nThen leave in a bag or container of desiccant (uncooked rice is common) in a warm (not hot) place (windowsill, etc.) for a few days.  You can wrap it in a handkerchief or paper towel to keep dust out of the ports while in the desiccant container.  48 hours may not be enough, some people have reported their device not coming fully back to life until around a week or more later.\n", "Q: Accidentally deleted login.keychain file. No backups, but able to recover something I used \"Data Rescue 3\" to recover a folder full of files called login-00001.keychain (to 587). How do I join them?\nThanks!\n\nA: The system will create a new login keychain the next time you log in. You will have to re-enter passwords for email accounts, wifi networks, etc., but in general loss of the keychain file isn't too traumatic assuming you have a list of your passwords stored securely elsewhere. This may not be so trivial if your keychain contained security certificates issued by your company or institution. If that may be the case, call IT. \nFWIW, I suspect that the multiple recovered files reflect multiple copies (or portions of same) reflecting various versions of the keychain as it was modified. I don't believe they're disjointed fragments that need to be combined. If anything, I'd try renaming the latest file (by date) and if Keychain Access opens it, run Keychain Repair (First Aid?) against the file. But I personally wouldn't bother. (You can give the file a temporary name like \"recovered\" for testing purposes, then rename it if you decide to use it--or just copy its contents into a newly created login keychain.)\n", "Q: What is the best way to charge I'm currently using Late 2008 MacBook (Aluminum).

And also charge whenever I found a power source? So that the battery cycle will not increase tremulously.\nWhat are the proper steps to charge MacBook batteries for long lasting life?\n\nA: The battery cycle is exactly what it says, a cycle. This means that it will count charge and discharge cycles as a whole.\nAn couple of apple genius guys I talk to recommend at least 2 charge cycles per month, and trying not to leave it plugged in at all times will keep it relatively healthy.\nYou don't need to completely drain a battery before you charge it either, but the more complete the cycles are, the better accuracy will be on the battery meter.\nIt's a hotly debated subject, but apple do have information on their website.\nhttp://www.apple.com/batteries/notebooks.html\n", "Q: Any other major difference between iPhone and iPod Touch except telephone function? Any major difference between iPhone and iPod Touch except telephone function?\nWhat does the iPhone have but the iPod Touch doesn't have and vice versa?\n\nA: Graeme got most of them, but here are a couple more I've noticed about the iPod Touch:\n\n\n*\n\n*previous generation CPU (A4 vs A5)\n\n*less support (1 free support phone call vs 3)\n\n*no LED flash for camera\n\n*no vibrator\n\n*USB power adapter not included ($30 extra)\n\n*headphones have no remote/mic\n\n\nA: So far, between iPhone 4 and iPod Touch the minuses (on iPod side) are:\n\n\n*\n\n*No phone\n\n*No 3G/CSDMA/GPRS\n\n*No GPS\n\n\nA: The differences aside from design, size, glass back cover and weight is that the iPod touch has:\n\n\n*\n\n*No cellular data\n\n*No GPS, cell tower, or other non-WiFi Location data\n\n*The iPod touch is not available with a 16Gb HD, only 8, 32, or 64.\n\n*No Digital Compass\n\n*Display is not fingerprint resistant\n\n*Video is 720p on iPod and 1080p on iPhone\n\n*Still photos are .6 megapixels in the iPod and 8 megapixels on iPhone\n\n*No image stabilisation in video mode\n\n*No Siri\n\n*256Mb RAM compared with 512Mb\n\n*£330 more in your pocket.\n\n*previous generation CPU (A4 vs A5)\n\n*less support (1 free support phone call vs 3)\n\n*no LED flash for camera\n\n*no vibration function\n\n*USB power adapter not included\n\n*headphones have no remote/mic\n\n\nThis compares the most upto date iPod Touch (4th gen) with the most upto date iPhone (4S) at time of writing\n12-17 were added after Ken suggested more. +1 to Ken for spotting the additional differences.\n\nA: Additionally, there's the Siri functionality that's currently limited to the 4S.\n\nA: Additionally, we have found that the battery in our iPhone 4S lasts longer than the battery in our 4th gen iPod Touch.  From what I can find, it seems that the 4S has a 1,432mAh battery, while the Touch only has a 930mAh.\n\nA: If I remember reading about this correctly some time ago, the displays, while both having \"Retina\" resolution, are different models from different OEM sources.

The problem I'm finding is that when I arrange them one way - every now and then some of them move down by 20-100 px approximately.\nI think it has to do with the weather graphic that is being loaded (i.e. sun, snow, rain, etc.). Sometimes they're taller than expected by the widget and it repositions itself which messes with my arrangement.\nQuestion\nIs there a way to make weather widgets stick to the place I position it at?\nDoes anybody know how to stop the rearrangement of the weather widgets?\nArranged:\n\nDisplaced:\n\n\nA: The reason the weather widgets jump around is because the icon pictures of the current weather stick out above the widget itself. For example, the clouds or rain images. When the weather changes, the images change, and since they stick out different amounts, they move around to accommodate the change.\nThis is fixable but results in a tiny bit of chopping-off of the top of the widget image. Worth it in my opinion, you can hardly notice the chop-off.\nEdit the file:\n/Library/Widgets/Weather.wdgt/Weather.js\n\nOn line 359, change:\nmaxOffset = entry.voffset > maxOffset ? entry.voffset : maxOffset;\n\nTo:\nmaxOffset = 0;\n\nIt may be a different line number - 359 is correct for Snow Leopard. You should search the file for the correct one.\nYou need to redo this when you update OSX.\n\nA: I know this isn't a very technical solution. Place the weather widgets side by side at the bottom of the screen, so when an image changes it doesn't bump into another widget. \n", "Q: How can I fix a weird WindowServer bug which only occurs on one machine? I've got an odd bug on one of my machines.  It only occurs on the one Mac so it's not a bug in the OS per-se, but it's very annoying and I can't work out how to fix it.\nBasically panel windows which are not set to Hide on Deactivate (such as Mail's Activity Window) aren't properly hidden when I hide their parent application.

I've had my MacBook since 2006 and, on the odd occasion, I've used the FireWire 400 port for connecting an HDD caddy or for networking between two Macs. I've always hot-swapped devices without a worry. I've always assumed that's what FireWire was designed to do.\nHowever, recently I purchased an M-Audio ProFire 610 - it's a multi-channel digital audio interface - and plastered all over its documentation (and the website) are warnings that you MUST turn the device off before plugging or unplugging. I was quite surprised by this, and wondered if it had anything to do with the device being dodgy.\nhttp://forums.m-audio.com/showthread.php?17235\nApparently then, this is not an issue with M-Audio devices, but with ALL FW400 devices... Although it's the first I've ever heard about it, which I find a bit odd... If there really is such a fundamental flaw in FW400, why wouldn't I have heard people complaining on Mac forums about fried FireWire controller chips?\nIs it dangerous in general, or do you think that perhaps M-Audio are trying to cover-up for shoddy manufacturing? Like I said I've never had any problems hot-plugging FW devices before and now I'm really paranoid, turning the computer off every time, which is really frustrating.\nNot only that, but supposedly the issue is power arcing onto the data pin... But if you power down any Mac device (MacBooks included), they still deliver power to the FW device. So how safe does powering it down really make it anyway?\n\nA: The issue is not with M-Audio or with the firewire standard, but with a oxford bridge controller design flaw which makes the controller susceptible to power spikes.  \nThe flawed chip was in a lot of computers in the late 2000s, which means that it was a good call for m-audio to issue the warning.  It wasn't their own butts they were covering, but it did mean a lot of down time and troubleshooting for their customers.\nI learned this the hard way, as the firewire 400 port on my old macbook was fried by hot-swapping the pro-fire 2626.\n\nA: It's probably M-Audio covering for shoddy manufacturing. FireWire is designed to be hot-pluggable. You should be able to plug and unplug at any time with no issues.\nAnd regarding the thread: not yanking cables at an angle is general good advice, whether they carry power or not.\n", "Q: Stop iTunes hiding sidebar when browsing store?

The Finder allows a non privileged user to perform a shutdown assuming there are no other users logged in, however shutdown is a privileged UNIX command. Does anyone know by what mechanism it does this?\n\nA: Please clarify how Finder lets you do a shutdown. On my 10.7.3 system \"shut down\" is part of the Apple menu and always present, it is not part of the Finder menu.\n/sbin/shutdown is indeed a restricted command, the Menu \"Shut Down\" feature may use a different mechanism (or it may not). I'd imagine the exact mechanism exploits the Unix suid bit feature in some way. Suid allows a command to be run as though the file owner were running it, e.g. the command is owned by root but can be executed by non-root users. This is a common (and risky) method to enable non-privileged users to run privileged commands. \n", "Q: Is there any way to reduce an app's usage of storage space on iOS 5? Is there any way to get any iOS app to clean up its cache etc? I heard there's a new 'cleaning' feature in iOS 5 where apps do that automatically. But I haven't seen any of my apps do that. I really need Facebook to clean itself up because it's taking up a lot of space.  Is there any way to initiate an app clean up?\nWhen I go to Settings > General > Usage, Facebook is listed as using 182 MB even though the app itself is only 10 MB.\n\nA: You could delete the Facebook app and then reinstall it. When you delete an app like Facebook, there's a little warning saying that deleting this app \"will also delete all of its data\", which is exactly what you want.\nI just tried this on my iPhone - deleting the Facebook app and reinstalling it made its usage go from 47 MB to 16 MB. This is only a temporary solution of course, since as you use Facebook it'll cache images etc. to speed up your browsing, so it'll start using more space again.\n\nA: I believe there is no way for a end-user to do this. All iOS apps will have Application_Home/Documents, Application_Home/Library, Application_Cache folders. All the files stored in these folders should be managed by application itself. So, it's true that you can't do this without jail breaking.\n\nA: It is definitely possible to access app sandboxes via an AFC client such as iFunBox or iPhone Explorer.\nTo emulate the criticized aggressive cleaning of iOS 5.0 you would empty the […]/Library/Caches/ and […]/tmp/ directories of the involved app(s), but due to the manual access involved one can perform a finer-grained selection.\nThe PhoneClean app also performs fully automatic or app selective cache cleaning.\n\nA: Had the same problem.. Went into my FB  settings, and went  into apps and deleted a lot of the ones I don't use. \nFrom 3gb storage down to 300mb.\nGo into the settings from your iPhone. Now to figure out how to do it on twitter\n", "Q: How can I automatically launch an application whenever the Mac goes idle? Is there a way to launch an application, such as Transmission, every time the computer goes idle (instead of sleeping)?  \n\nA: This is a very hard feat to accomplish, primarily because there is no specific definition of \"Idle\". The only programs I've seen to actually have idle features are Instant Messaging Clients and the recent Mac App Store releases of Growl. And those simply have a configurable time that goes off after the set number of minutes when there's no mouse/keyboard activity occurring.\nThere's been similar discussion on the Macworld Forums some years ago, and a specific post that essentially entails creating and running an AppleScript that will monitor your usage and launch an application when you go \"idle\".\n\nproperty idleCheck : 20 as integer\nproperty idleCheck_usr : 120 as integer\nset timer to 0\non idle\n    --Check idle time\n    set idletime to do shell script \"ioreg -c IOHIDSystem | awk '/HIDIdleTime/ {print int($NF/1000000000); exit}'\"\n    set idletime to idletime as string\n    set idletime to idletime as integer\n\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        if idletime is less than idleCheck then (* 20 is 20 seconds. If a key was tapped within the idleCheck seconds, it quits the app. *)\n            tell application \"TextEdit\" to quit\n\n            return idleCheck -- checks again in ... seconds\n        else\n            if idletime is greater than idleCheck_usr then (*  If a key was tapped after the idleCheck_usr seconds it opens the app. *)\n                tell application \"TextEdit\" to launch   \n            end if\n\n            return idleCheck\n        end if\n    end tell\nend idle\n\nIn this case idle is only after 2 minutes, but you can easily change that to be longer if necessary. You will also want to modify the line to open Transmission instead of TextEdit.\nNote that you will have to open this AppleScript and leave it running in order for the action (launching an application on idle) to ever occur.\n\nA: Have you tried using Scenario? It is on the Mac App Store. While I haven't tried it myself. It seems that it might do what you need. Hope this helps. \n\nA: How about Sleepwatcher?\n\"SleepWatcher 2.2 (running with Mac OS X 10.5 to 10.7, source code included) is a command line tool (daemon) for Mac OS X that monitors sleep, wakeup and idleness of a Mac. It can be used to execute a Unix command when the Mac or the display of the Mac goes to sleep mode or wakes up, after a given time without user interaction or when the user resumes activity after a break or when the power supply of a Mac notebook is attached or detached. It also can send the Mac to sleep mode or retrieve the time since last user activity.\"\nTo launch an app (using a command), you'd have to do something like the following:\nopen /Applications/Transmission.app\n\n\nA: Power Manager can be used to launch an application after inactivity.\nAs Jason mentions in his answer, Apple's implementation of idle time is difficult to predict. Power Manager uses a measure of inactivity based on user activity; this is easier to predict and more likely to be what you are looking for.\n\n\nA: If the screen saver starting is what you mean as idel you could look at ScriptSaver which makes itself into a screen saver and then when it is called it calls your AppleScript ad a screen saver.\n", "Q: Two windows on Mac OS X full-screen How can I open related windows of the same app in the same full screen workspace? For example, in Safari, when in fullscreen mode, if I click on Preferences it opens the window in another desktop.\n\nA: You can't. Fullscreen Mode in Lion moves the given window to its own Space to be presented full-screen. Any other window created by the same application defaults to the Primary (\"Desktop\") Space.\nAn obvious workaround while browsing in Safari is to open new pages in tabs rather than windows, but that doesn't apply to the Preferences (or any other app-) window.\n", "Q: Email addresses contain @HOSTNAME.domain.com when mail is configured using Profile Manager I'm setting up a Lion server environment for an entire office full of MacBook Pros, all running Lion. Lion server is 10.7.2, running Open Directory, DNS, and Mail.  I have successfully set up the mail server to relay mail for two domains.  Let's call them domainA and domainB.  Everything works if I set it up manually from the Mail client, but I'm trying to use Profile Manager.  Now, this requires quite a bit of explanation, so apologies in advance for the long post:\nThe \"Settings for Everyone\" profile, when auto-populated via the \"Include configuration for services\" setting in Server.app > Profile Manager seems to use the setting from Server Admin > Mail > General > \"Host Name:\".  If I set the hostname to one of the two domain names, the \"Settings for Everyone\" profile works fine, populates the user's Mail configuration with an address username@domain.com.  However, if I use the actual host name for this setting, it populates the email address as username@hostname.domain.com.  This is regardless of what is set in the \"Domain Name:\" setting on the same page.  This leaves me with an issue.  I can't choose the address / domain the user will use, as it would be defaulted to domainA or domainB via the \"Hostname:\" setting, not to mention that it just does not seem right to have to use \"domain.com\" as the hostname, and have DNS records pointed at a mail server.  (I would usually point the .domain.com DNS record to a web server, like many domains are set up)\nSo, I have set up a Group and Group Profile called MailTest, where I have specified the settings for the mail server.  I cannot use the \"Settings for Everyone\" because of the issue I mentioned above, which is why I thought I could just have two profiles, one for each domain.  I found this doc on Profile Manager variables, and used a few of these to set MailTest up so that it would dynamically configure Mail the way I wanted it.  Everything seems to work, EXCEPT for the Email Address setting.  \nI have tried using %email% for the Email Address setting, and verifying that the user's OD account has the correct address.  When I used %email%, it seems that the Incoming Mail > Mail Server and Port setting from the profile is actually used.  I also tried using %short_name%@domain.com, and experienced the same behavior.  The only time this setting seems to be recognized is when it is left blank.  Then, you are prompted for the email address when installing the profile.      \nFor those of you that are still with me, has anyone experienced this issue?  Are there others that found that they could not use a hostname in the Mail server's settings or else their mail users would have a user@hostname.domain.com address?  Does anyone know why the \"Email Address\" profile setting seems to be overridden by the \"Incoming Mail Server\" setting?\nI can certainly work around this by having multiple Profiles, and by using A records for domain.com that point to my mail server, but this is not desired.  I would like to use the %email% variable in my Profile so that I can use a single profile, in hopes of controlling users' email address from their OD account settings.\n\nA: Another update...  I started fresh with a new install of Lion.  Updated to 10.7.3 first, having read about everyone's nightmares after this update.  \nAnyway, my Kerberos realm is now set to domain1.com, but Profile Manager still insists on using the incoming server name (hostname.domain1.com)as the email address.  I tried using both variables, %email% and %short_name%@domain1.com.  No luck either way.\nWhat I find aggravating is that if you view the Profile when it is installed, or in Systems Settings > Profiles, the email address is correct.  This was also the case before I started over.  This leads me to believe that the profiles are somehow not implemented correctly by either Mail or the profile installation process.  I looked at the XML in the profile, and do not see any settings that would be responsible for the behavior.  Everywhere I used a variable, the resulting values were precisely as I expected.  \nI again tested the default \"Settings for Everyone\" profile that is configured automatically based on your server settings, and the Server Admin > Mail > General > \"Host name:\" setting still takes precedence.  So, if you put your actual hostname in this field (i.e. mail.domain.com) your users will all end up using user@mail.domain.com as an address. \nI am admitting defeat for now, and just set up A records for domain.com that point to the mail server.  This way, I can set my two profiles up, one for each that use domain1.com and domain2.com, respectively, as their incoming servers.  The email address will then default to %short_name%@incomingserver    \n\nA: Same problem here. It is a bug in Apple Mail on 10.7.3.\nIf you open the downloaded mobileconfig file in a text editor you will see that the correct email address is listed.\nI can confirm from testing that Apple Mail incorrectly populates the email address's domain part from the config's incoming mail server hostname.\n", "Q: Where did /usr/bin/git come from? I have a small problem. At some point I used git but I don't remember if it was installed by default on Lion.\nHere is the version and path of git:\n$ git --version\ngit version 1.7.5.4\n$ which git\n/usr/bin/git\n\nI also have a newer git in /usr/local/git\nI would like to use the newer version but I don't know if by removing the old one (/usr/bin has precedence in the path variable) I'll break something.\nWhat is the proper way to resolve this conflict?\n\nA: You don't need to go hacking the other version out unless you are really tight for space. Edit your .bash_profile and make sure that /usr/local/bin occurs in front of /usr/bin in your PATH variable\nPersonally I prefer to adopt a scheme with tool paths defined and the path built from these e.g.\nGIT_HOME=/usr/local\n\nPATH=${GIT_HOME}/bin:${PATH};export PATH\nMANPATH=${GIT_HOME}/share/man:${MANPATH};export MANPATH\n\nThis means that anything that searches for tools using the PATH will find your version of git, and anything that \"really must\" have the /usr/bin version will most likely have that path hard wired in and can still find it\n\nA: I had the same problem: an old version of Git that was the Xcode version. I've tried to install a new version of Git from http://git-scm.com/ and updated the bash_profile with\nPATH=/usr/local/git/bin:$PATH\n\nThen reload your bash and try git --version\nWorked for me :)\n\nA: git is installed by Xcode. I doubt you'll have any problems if you replace it, but I can't give you a definitive answer to that…\n\n\n*\n\n*What I'd do is rename the old /usr/bin/git to git_old, then rely on your path to select the new one.\n\n*If that doesn't work, move the new one to /usr/bin. I doubt Xcode is picky about which version of git it's using.\n\n*If that still doesn't work, move git_old back to /usr/bin/git and use either a direct path, rename, or alias for your new one.\n\n\nI doubt you'll have to go past #1 above, though. That should be enough.\nEdit: I read your original post backwards. The first thing you should do is make sure your path includes the new git directory BEFORE the directory that contains the old git.\n\nA: On my system (10.7.3, Xcode 4.3.2) Xcode's git is not installed in /usr/bin/git.  All of Xcode 4 (like all apps from the App Store, I think) is in its .app bundle.  Specifically, its git is at /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/git.\nI use git (via Xcode) all the time, and I have no /usr/bin/git here at all.  So it's not part of the default Lion install, either, or at least, not at that location.\nFWIW, the git in the Xcode.app bundle has a --version that reads:\n\ngit version 1.7.7.5 (Apple Git-26)\n\nso I bet your /usr/bin/git is your own installation, and updating it can't hurt anything.\nAlternatively, you could install Xcode (it's free!), and put /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/ in your $PATH, but that's overkill if you only want git.\n\nA: Ken is correct in that git was only available through the Xcode.app path.\nWhen I installed Mountain Lion (10.8), suddenly I had git in /usr/bin/git, so it was a Mountain Lion addition as far as I can tell...\nAlthough...I have installed quite a few things since and am not entirely sure it wasn't a dependency for something else.\n\nA: I really don't know, I think I haven't installed git or XCode for the momment but after install homebrew and run brew doctor it says:\n$ brew doctor\nWarning: /usr/bin occurs before /usr/local/bin\nThis means that system-provided programs will be used instead of those\nprovided by Homebrew. The following tools exist at both paths:\n\n    git\n    git-cvsserver\n    git-receive-pack\n    git-shell\n    git-upload-archive\n    git-upload-pack\n\nConsider setting your PATH so that /usr/local/bin\noccurs before /usr/bin. Here is a one-liner:\n    echo export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\" >> ~/.bash_profile\n\nSo why? I just installed Command Line Tools for XCode (mountain Lion) and I think this one is the one who installed it.\n\nA: I've tried many things.  Finally I was able to get brew's version of git to run instead of Xcode's by simply deleting Xcode's additional tools folder:\nsudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools\n", "Q: Repeating Mail Calendar Reminders?

The alarm occurs once only.\nIs there any way to set the alarm/reminder to repeat? \nIs this set on the phone, or in Outlook when creating the calendar event?  I can't see an option for this in Outlook 2007.\n\nA: Edit:  If you're connecting an Exchange account or to a Google calendar via the Exchange setting, the Second Alert option is not available, because these systems do not support a second alert.\nIf you are not connecting via the Exchange setting you can access the Second Alert like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your iPhone, start Calendar.  \n\n*Navigate to the day that has your event.  \n\n*Select the event, which brings up the Event Details.\n\n*Click the Edit button.\n\n*Scroll down until you see Alert.\n\n*If the event does not already have an alert, it will say \"none\" and you click \"none\" to add an alert. \n\n*Once the event has an alert, you will see a new entry just below it called Second Alert.

I have a single app that needs to be reinstalled. I have tried all tricks known to man in attempts to get it to work, but all have failed. There is a lot of data in this app that I'd rather not lose. It isn't explicitly iCloud-enabled, and it's not a game, so there's no hope of Game Center restoring anything. How, if possible, can I reinstall it without losing my data?\n\nA: While I never tried it myself, in theory you could use something like PhoneDisk to open the app's private folder and copy all the content to your computer. Then, after deleting and reinstalling the app, you should be able to copy the content back.\n\nA: Xcode can reinstall an app. Go to Window -> Devices and click on your device on the left. You can tap the '+' button and browse for an app, or just drag any app you want onto the 'Installed apps' section. You can even drag an app icon straight from iTunes. The app will be reinstalled, over the old one, without erasing any data, documents, caches, etc.\n\nA: Reinstalling the application will almost certainly not solve your problem.  iOS applications are digitally signed.  If even a single byte is changed, iOS will refuse to run it.  What you will be reinstalling will be identical to what you currently have installed.\nThe problem is far more likely to be with your data or the interpretation of it.  There's probably a bug in the application that has either deleted your data or fails to recognise it.  You should contact the developers to try to diagnose what is happening here.\nYou can get your data off your device by using a tool like iExplorer, or, if the application has enabled it, iTunes File Sharing (which is available in the Apps tab for your device in iTunes).\n\nA: As Hui explained, an app can be reinstalled without the loss of it's data by deleting or renaming the iTunesMetadata.plist file in it's directory.\nTerminal works as well as iFile for this purpose, but it's tiny and free.\nA Terminal command to accomplish this for Facebook:\nrm $(dirname $(find -name Facebook.app))/iTunesMetadata.plist\n\nI've just had to reinstall after two failed updates and I've had to do this fairly often in the past, everyone suggesting that doing so is unlikely to help with whatever issue timothymh is experiencing might have terrific net connections. No, iOS won't allow the failed installs to run, but it won't let you retry AND keep your data either.\n\nA: The only way to reinstall an app is by deleting the app and all it's data and then installing again. Unless you have a way to export/copy the data (for example: in app export/import, iTunes file transfer, DropBox/iCloud sync etc).\nI would try to do a full backup and restore of the device to see if that fixes it for you (I don't know if all tricks known to man included this).\n\nA: If your iPhone is jailbroken, you can delete the app's metadata and then re-install the app.\nYou can use SBSettings to find the app's path, then in iFile go to this directory and delete iTunesMetadata.plist. The App Store will no longer see the app as installed and you can re-install it and keep your data.\n\nA: I had the same problem so I went to the app's store page thing and updated it from there\n", "Q: Will iRig connect my electronic guitar to my MacBook Pro? I know Apogee iJam can do this, but it's a little expensive for me. iRig can connect a guitar to iOS devices, but will iRig connect a guitar to a MacBook Pro?\n\nA: If your Macbook Pro has the single 3.5mm jack that can take input and output then iRig should work just fine for you.\nSomeone asked a similar question here. If you're looking for something ultra cheap you could always get a 1/4\" to 3.5mm adaptor to plug your guitar into your Mac. I did this for a very long time until I could afford higher quality hardware. These things run as low as $2 at some places, here is one for example. Hope this helps!\n", "Q: Does the iPhone compress emailed videos? When you open a video in the Photos app and choose to send it via email, does the video get compressed, or is it sent using the same resolution it was shot in?\nI'm mainly wondering about the iPhone 4.\n\nA: You are correct. The video will be compressed to a smaller size before sending out. \nEDIT: If you want to try to send uncompressed video, you can try the trick from this guy, http://www.quora.com/How-can-I-share-an-uncompressed-video-from-my-iPhone\nIn the Camera Roll or Photos app, press and hold on the photo. A menu should pop up with Copy as an option. If you want multiple photos, you can hit the Share button the toolbar and select all the photos you want and then hit Copy. Either way, you'll end up with the full-quality photo in your clipboard, which you can then paste into an email.\n", "Q: How to sync mail accounts between iMac and iPad2 properly? I'm trying to sync my email accounts between my new iMac and an iPad 2.\nThe problem is that if I read or delete a message on the iMac, the same email appears on iPad as not deleted and not read.\nAny help?\nCheers\n\nA: It sounds like the account type might be POP instead of IMAP. POP stores messages and all message attributes on each client (iMac, iPad, etc). IMAP stores messages and attributes on the server, so every client has the same view of the messages (including unread/read state). So, the solution for you is to use IMAP if the account supports it.\n", "Q: New Apps Windows with Mission Control I am using Mission Control to help manage my various Desktops.

I know this is possible, I'm interested in hearing from people who have actually done it and learn from their direct experience.\nCurrently, I'm running Snow Leopard, dual booting 10.6.8 and Win7 x64 on a MacBook Pro with a single internal HD using Boot Camp.  For software development, I need to run linux on the metal (not through VMware or the like) so that I can use Linux KVM.  I know I need to repartition and upgrade to 10.7 in the process, but I'm struggling with the best/easiest process to do so.\nI have one of the very first aluminum uni-body macs from late 2008.\nHardware Overview:\n\n\n*\n\n*Model Name: MacBook Pro\n\n*Model Identifier:   MacBookPro5,1\n\n*Processor Name: Intel Core 2 Duo\n\n*Processor Speed:    2.8 GHz\n\n*Number Of Processors:   1\n\n*Total Number Of Cores:  2\n\n*L2 Cache:   6 MB\n\n*Memory: 4 GB\n\n*Bus Speed:  1.07 GHz\n\n*Boot ROM Version:   MBP51.007E.B05\n\n*SMC Version (system):   1.33f8\n\n\nCPU Features:\n$ sysctl -a | grep machdep.cpu.features\nmachdep.cpu.features: FPU VME DE PSE TSC MSR PAE MCE CX8 APIC SEP MTRR PGE MCA CMOV PAT PSE36 CLFSH DS ACPI MMX FXSR SSE SSE2 SS HTT TM PBE SSE3 DTES64 MON DSCPL VMX SMX EST TM2 SSSE3 CX16 TPR PDCM SSE4.1\n\nRoadblocks:\n\n\n*\n\n*My internal superdrive is old and shot, no read or write\n\n*4gb of ram is not enough and I frequently run out with the programs I run like Xcode, Eclipse, Visual Studio 2010, etc\n\n*My primary hd is damn near completely out of space\n\n*I've tried booting both Fedora 16 and CentOS 5 live cd's from an external firewire BD-R to no avail.\n\n\nSilver lining:\n\n\n*\n\n*With the external BD-R I have successfully booted a SL install DVD, so I know it's bootable at least with that one DVD\n\n*I have iDefrag and have successfully used it to  re-organize the data toward the front of the disk so that I could shrink the primary HFS+ volume.\n\n*I have an external 3TB drive that's completely HFS+ that I can use to dump files on from OSX.  There is important data on this disk and it cannot be lost.\n\n*I also have an external 256GB usb hd that's currently formatted NTFS with some windows stuff on it but could be easily formatted for whatever purpose.\n\n*I love me some hot terminal action ;)\n\n\nI found this guide which is a bit outdated, but I think the fundamentals should still apply.\nAfter reading this guide, my plan was to get 2 4GB sticks of ram, a new SSD, install that as the primary drive and load Lion onto it.  Exactly how, TBD, you tell me the easiest way.  I would then move the current internal HD to an opti-bay expansion like this one (but maybe not exactly this one) and have two internal disks.\nWith the new hardware in place, the SSD would be one partition, guid partition table (EFI), osx 10.7 only.  Then, if I understand things correctly, I could partition the second HD with MBR and install Linux on one half and Win7 on the other half.  Presumably, I would need to use rEFIt to see all three in the menu.  This guide also talks about Windows having to be the final partition on the disk, I don't know if that still applies if it's the second drive?\nAny extra space I could mount from external disks after getting the environments booted, but it's my understanding that you have to boot from internal drives.  So far any attempt I've made to boot from external linux usb sticks and live cds have all failed, but it could be to me not blessing or formatting things properly.  I honestly think I did things correctly, but I'm not perfect and I could have done something wrong or missed a step.  I've tried Apple's own Disk Utility, PenDrive and unetbootin.  I've also burned Fedora 16 and CentOS 5 live cds and had no success booting either.  Both of them dump me into my existing Windows (oh the irony) when I boot with C or use option and select the cd.\nNow, if this is even possible, and you've done this, I have a ton of questions for you.  Primarily, how would you suggest a plan of action / order of things I should do so I have a checklist I can run through to get the installations going.  However, I'd also like to know more information about any snags you ran into, drivers needed, kernel modules, x11 configs, distro hacks, or anything else you've run into with linux on your macbook.  I've read some horror stories about high-pitched speaker squeal and things like that.  Everything from precisely what distribution you used to what window manager, no detail is too small.  \nUPDATE:\nOver the weekend I got my internal SuperDrive to read, not write.  Don't ask me how or why please.  I'm not quite sure what I did, I just jacked around with different CD-R DVD-R media.  I'm guessing it's still on it's last leg, but it is having an easier time with this new media.\n\nA: I have found this guide to installing ArchLinux with Triple Boot on a MacBook Aluminum that was the level of detail I needed, so I will be proceeding with that.  It appears to cover everything from the special things needed during install to getting the light sensors and other internal do-dads working post-install with respective drivers.\nThe main points to overcoming the challenge:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install all the bits before the upgrade to the existing HD by booting from the internal CD\n\n*When installing linux install Grub to the PARTITION, not the device, but since that's fruity you've got to set a few flags on the files to make sure the blocks don't move around on you afterward\n\n*After things are installed, remove the superdrive and put in the new HD and install Lion to the second drive using a USB disk install procedure then boot into Lion off that.  Refit has problems with booting other OS's off the second device, but off the first device it should work fine.\n\n*Post Lion install, optionally re-claim / re-cycle SL disk space.  I plan on leaving it alone while I can, but probably two or three months from now wiping it out once I'm confident my Lion workspace is completely functional\n\n\nOnly real potential trouble I can see with this is that if anything goes sideways I've no longer got the internal super drive to boot from which seems to be a necessity for the third-party OS installs.  As I said, OSX dvds will boot just fine from the external firewire BD-R.  Perhaps having a usb-enclosure for the superdrive would work?  I'm just guessing since USB tends to be much more broadly supported than fw.  Worst case scenario I open it up again and rip out the functional drive and re-insert the SuperDrive for the repairs, then remove it again, but I can see this potentially causing headaches with device ids and such, particularly in linux where things will reference /dev/sd*  If anybody can confirm they have booted a third-party os install from an external USB stick or USB superdrive enclosure I would feel much better.\nEDIT:\nNew partition scheme for those interested:\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *320.1 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Mac                     200.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                  Apple_HFS Linux                   10.0 GB    disk0s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data Windows                 109.6 GB   disk0s4\n\nNote the Apple_HFS next to linux, I specifically formatted this HFS before the windows install so that Windows would not pick it up as C during the installation procedure.  During the Linux install procedure I'm going to format with ext3 or ext4.  \nOrder of installs is OSX, Win, Linux.  OSX boots from EFI, Windows boots from MBR, and Linux is chain loaded from EFI (refit) to boot from the partition.\nEDIT2:\nThe latest ArchLinux bootable ISO could not boot properly with the default parameters.  It would hang infinitely waiting for UDEV UEVENTS.  The newer ISO's apparently ship with an open source nVidia driver that blows up on at least a couple of MacBooks.  I turned the module off at boot by pressing Tab instead of hitting enter and appending nouveau.modeset=0 to the vmlinuz load parameters.  This allowed me to get to a root shell.\nEDIT3: \nI ran into some trouble getting refit to see Linux after the installation. The installer would only install grub to the device, so I had to manually install my boot loader. It was a bit tricky, and not really well documented in any of the linked guides so I'll attempt to capture exactly what happened. \nInstallation went through fine, but when I selected Grub, it would only allow me to install it to the device. Knowing that I did not want that, I hit cancel and tried installing it manually.  Grub install failed at first. The trouble with that was since I only formatted the partition ext3 and did not adjust the partition table, the Linux partition was not flagged as bootable. So, I had to tweak and re sync.  \n\n\n*\n\n*From the install cd, drop to an alt console with FN+alt+f2 and run parted\n\n*From the GNU Parted console, flag the partition bootable by doing toggle 3 boot for me it was 3 since it was /dev/sda3 \n\n*This jacks your partition table, so, exit to get back to bash and shutdown -h now then, with a fresh set of electrons, boot into refit console and run gptsync\n\n*With GPT and MBR now in sync, reboot yet again into the install cd\n\n*mount /dev/sda3 /mnt to get back into your hard drive\n\n*grub-install --root-directory=/mnt --recheck --no-floppy /dev/sda3 to install grub to the partition \n\n*Go double check /mnt/boot/grub/menu.lst to see if everything is ok.  For me I ended up having to add the /boot prefixes on the file paths\n\n\nTo try to summarize, neither formatting ext3 nor installing the boot loader to the partition was enough, I needed to touch the partition table to get refit to see it was out of sync and adjust things.  I am now successfully triple booting SL, Arch, Win7.  I have yet to install the second hard drive.\n\nA: I don't have a triple boot, but because I don't have enough hhd space for it. Right now I have lion and Ubuntu. My macbook is more or less like yours, it isn't pro but its from the same date.\nSo here is how I done it:\n-First I installed rEFIt, wich is a boot manager that allows you to boot from cd in a easier way and also to manage dual or triple boots. Nota that it is installed on your primary partition so it ALWAYS appears. Also note you can still use boot camp since it is a system feature, but I do not recommend it.\nrEFIt can be donwloaded here: http://refit.sourceforge.net/\n-Then I freed some space on the hard drive and created some unallocated space on it with the disk utility. I think linux installers are not capable of resizing HFS+ (OS X's file system) . I left 30 GB for the linux partition and 4 GB for its swap memory.\n-Last thing I did was o install it, it was tricky because my superdrive is also a bit broken and it kept spitting out the disc. You can install from a usb drive anyway.\nWhat can I say. It works out of the box nicely. You only have to activate restricted drivers for the graphics card (and it isn't even that important). If you are used to Lion's inverted scrolling, I would recommend installing a plugin called natural scrolling.\nI think thats all my experience on the subject. When you have gotten to that point you can easily contract Mac OS X's partition again to install windows.\nGiven your starting configuration I would recommend erasing windows completely (of course backing up data in your external hard drive) and then to start this steps from the begining. You can try to follow this steps over your current configuration, and although I think it would work (and rEFIt would detect the windows partition) i do not recommend it.\nI hope I helped.\n", "Q: Why does a jailbroken iPhone always ask to restart Springboard after installing a new app? I just jailbroke my iPhone and it went well. \nWhy does a jailbroken iPhone always ask to restart springboard everytime an app is installed from Cydia? It's so annoying. It's like installing an app on a Mac and having to reboot the machine. I jailbroke using redsnow.\nAny answers?\n\nA: It doesn't always - only when the new app directly affects the interface. So when you install command-line only functionality there is no need to respring - at the other end of the scale you would also need to respring every time you change a theme in, say, winterboard, even though you are not installing a new app.  \nThe reason for this behaviour at both ends of this spectrum is that none of the jailbreak 'tweaks' can affect the springboard while it's running - they have to change the filed copy and then restart with a new version of springboard...  \n\nA: Often jailbreak apps hook into springboard to be able to control views that get displayed or user interactions. A good and popular example of this is MyWi. It uses the build in tethering bar to display when the device is currently tethering. To do this is needs to restart springboard so it can hook into it properly.\n\nA: When the application needs to be \"installed\" as a \"icon\" app, it will install as a system app even when CyDelete is installed. System apps differ from normal apps as system apps CANNOT be deleted easily while normal apps can be deleted from the Settings app but system apps, when installed, because they cannot be deleted from Springboard, it requires a respring to \"update\" Springboard.\n", "Q: Can my Macbook Pro's display receive inputs from other sources? Is it possible to use my Macbook Pro's display to receive inputs from other sources?\n\nA: \nIs it possible to use my Macbook Pro's display to receive inputs from other sources?\n\nIt is generally not economically feasible to build a custom display around Apple panels.\n\nA: Yes, but it's not worth it.\nYou would have to take the laptop apart, design and engineer a custom converter to drive the LCD interface (internally, it's going to use LVDS to handle the interface between the laptop's motherboard and the screen), and power it somehow. It also would probably render the macbook from which you removed the screen unusable as a laptop.\nIt would take a few hundred hours of engineering time, and cost a lot in prototypes.\nYou are better off just buying a separate LCD.\n\nA: If your other input sources are networked computers that are on the same network as your MacBook?  You could use a VNC like program such as ScreenRecycler to let other computers show their screen on your Macbook. \n\nA: If you're looking to preview video from various analogue/digital sources, you could also use a video capture device to capture analogue video, HDTV, or digital HD source material.  \nThe Macbook itself will still need to work, but this would be one way of displaying video from other sources on your Macbook's display.  You could probably even use the HDMI interface on BlackMagic's thunderbolt capture device to display the (DVI) video output from another computer.  It'll be awkward and cumbersome, but should probably work.\nOf course, the answer you're probably looking for is that you should just buy a traditional LCD monitor if you need a second display for your desktop.  All of the solutions described above are considerably more awkward and expensive than doing that.\n\nA: Well, not in the conventional sense. No you can't just plugin HDMI source and use the Pro as a monitor. \nHowever, Napkin Studio is working to achieve AirPlay mirroring on the Mac. That is, you can mirror your entire iOS screening the Mac. Here: http://www.napkinstudio.com/\nAlso, there is conventional airplay, where you can just play the video that is on your iOS device on the Mac monitor. Again, this isn't from Apple(yet), rather from developers. Here: http://www.airserverapp.com/\nSo yeah, if you are in the Apple ecosystem, yes your Pro can receive input from other \"sources\".

When I can no longer play without having to wait 30 seconds for a new coin, I just delete the game and reinstall, I have been receiving more coins than the original starting point. Are these coins from bonuses or am I being charged for them?  I have not purchased more coins, that's why I delete then reinstall, so  I don't have to buy coins.\n\nA: You will know if you are being charged an in-app purchase fee for extra coins by checking your purchase history from within the Account Section of the iTunes App on your PC or Mac.  Just log into the store, check your account, and look in your history.  Even free purchases are listed, so you will see if you are being charged.\nOrdinarily just noting that a password request for your Apple ID would be required for any purchases would be a good hint if you are being charged or not, but in your specific case because you are downloading the game each time from the App store and playing immediately, it may be that the stored credentials from when you downloaded the item are being kept valid - it will not re-ask you for your password for a small period of time (I think 15 minutes).  It's hard to say, so you should just go and confirm.\nAs for specific gameplay details, I am not familiar with it, so I cannot comment.\n", "Q: Use MacBook Air or Pro for app development? I need to replace my old Mac and I am wondering which one should I get between:\nMacBook Air or MacBook Pro\nThe primary goal will be to develop iPhone and iPad Apps and OSX Widgets.\nIs there a better one I should get for these purposes?\n\nA: This is a very difficult question to answer, it depends so much on what sort of development you are doing, even if you will have access to an external monitor or not.\nReally, what I think you are asking is if an Air is capable of running Xcode for minor development tasks.  As if it isn't, you know that the Pro would be.\nCertainly an Air is capable of running XCode, but on the smaller screens it's not going to be a comfortable experience as XCode does enjoy vast amounts of screen real estate if it can get it.\nAlso, the lack of a full size keyboard may be annoying when coding on a laptop keyboard, whether it's the Air or the Pro, I bought an external keyboard simply to have access to full size keys for forward delete, home/end etc etc.\nSo you may find that a Mini, with external kb/monitor may be your best alternative, depending on your financial limits etc.\n", "Q: How do I identify if an email address is already used as an Apple ID?

So for example while my Apple ID is from a personal domain, say xyz@1234.com, I also have an icloud email address xyz123@me.com that is associated with my Apple ID.  If your wide used a mobile me account, maybe as part of a family pack, and you migrated it to icloud, it's possible that it has gained such a link in some way.\n", "Q: View usage of Photos app I'm wondering how you can view the size of each photo or video in the Photos app on an iPhone 4S. I have a lot of photos/videos and want to see how much space they are using. I go to Settings > General > Usage but don't see the Photos app listed under Storage. Thoughts?\n\nA: One way I know of, which would be tedious to use for all of your photos unfortunately, is to email a photo from the camera roll. When you hit Send on the email, you're offered choices of sending a compressed photo (Small, Medium, or Large), or the original size. Each of the choices lists what the resulting image file size would be, and this includes the original size.\n\nA: There is no convenient built-in solution but LightLoupe from Boinx Software will let you browse a \"thumbnail page\" for your Saved Photos, or any Album in your Photo Library, and provide image (W x H in pixels) and file (bytes) size for any photo selected. You can also view a histogram and other data.\nI'm certain there are other Photo Utility apps with similar functions. \nLess than ideal but less labor intensive than the faux email export technique. \n", "Q: How to receive notification of HTTP access I have a web server running on my Mac and I'd like to be notified (via Growl for example) when someone accesses my server.\nI searched for something like that in Automator but found nothing.\nDo you know if this is possible ?\nThank you.\n\nA: The key is your access logs.  Assuming your webserver is properly configured, each time a page is served it should provide some level of detail in the access logs.  This can be turned off for sites with enourmous traffic loads, but for your bog standard (assuming) apache install on a local machine I imagine you are not looking as a massive load.\nSo, what you need is a method to examine the access log periodically (or real time) either by checking timestamps, or tailing the content etc.  Once this is sorted, you need a way to push it into growl.  Growlnotify is a command line utility that will accept output from other commands and use it as the basis to provide a graphical growl notification.\nAt this point you need to decide if you want a simple \"You have visitors!\" message, or something that includes the details, say which page was served to which IP address etc.  That's your choice, and makes the code you need to write that bit more complex or simple.\nCheck the following example (sorry, I use ksh, you may need to modify):\n#!/bin/ksh\nwhile read access\ndo\ngrowlnotify -t \"HTTP_Access\" -m \"You have visitors!\ndone < /http/access/log/folder/log1.log\n\nObviously this will churn out far too much info and be generic, so you need to add your own special blend of a) configuring Apache to only log to the level you need, and b) filter out the entries anyway, possibly formatting while you go, e.g.:\n#!/bin/ksh\nwhile read access\ndo\nformatted_access=`echo $access | grep -v \"unwanted strings\" | awk '{print \"Time \"$1\", IP\"$4}'`\ncount =`echo $formatted_access | wc -l`\ncase $count in\n(0)\n# No line matched criteria\n;;\n(*)\ngrowlnotify -t \"HTTP_Access\" -m $formatted_access\n;;\nesac\ndone < /http/access/log/folder/log1.log\n\nThrow this into an automator service, and away you go.\n\nA: One of the most powerful methods of getting notifications from a web server is to build in support for webhooks. The fine folks behind this software stack have a nice blog that helps describe how this might work if you wanted to code this into the web site.\n\nA: Growl can probably do this for you automatically:\n\n", "Q: OS X Lion Safari and Chrome's Vertical Scrollbar (overlay versus next to content) What determines how the scrollbar is rendered in OS X Lion? On my home and work machine, I see the scrollbar next to the content like this:\n\nA co-worker, also running Lion has that same scrollbar overlaid ontop of the content (partially transparent), rather than in a \"column\" next to the content.\nWhat determines which of these you get? Only difference I can figure out is because he's using a magic mouse, and I'm using a Logitech. Systems preferences for scrolling (in the general pref), we both have \"Show scrollbars\" set as \"Automatically based on input device.\"\n\nA: That's your reason right there, you are using a traditional mouse, and so you get the traditional scrollbar, it should always be on view.  Your friend is using a touch input device, and like with trackpad users this does not rely on accurate positional use of the cursor, and so the scrollbars disappear unless active scrolling is happening, as they do not need to be seen for a target, and when they do show they overlay so as not to cause a nasty screen artifact (namely an 8 pixel wide scrollbar flashing in and out of existence, possibly causing screen repagination etc)\n", "Q: Guest account on MAC OS X 10.5 can go to Finder and see all the files I created a new Guest Account with restrictions and parental Controls but if I am in the guest account and I go to Finder and click on All images or documents it shows all of it.....

Depending on how this happened, you may have a little or a lot of clean up, but let's verify this is what is happening:\nHere are two screenshots of the default permissions for your administrator's home folder as well as the Documents folder within the home folder.\n\n\nYou can edit things by clicking the lock icon, entering an admin user/password and then using the +, - and gear buttons. Don't forget to apply the changes to enclosing folders. Also, getting a little help from Apple or a tech is often needed if many folders have incorrect permissions. The ~/Library and ~/Shared folders have permissions different than most as well as files that are constantly in use so try to stick with Photos or Documents until you're sure you're fixing things appropriately.\n\nA: That depends on your definition of \"all\", which in this instance mean \"all the files I have permission to see\", which will include anything in shared folders like applications, certain library areas etc\nYou should only worry if it can see files that are supposed to remain specific to a set user.  If you have a fair amount of programs installed, you will have all sorts of example images (for, er, example!) and so on strewn in loads of folders that all users including guests will have access to.  This access is required, or a guest user would only have permission to log out, and not use any of the apps etc.\nGo back and check the files, if required make one called ZZZ in a normal users home folder somewhere, then use the guest account and check you can (or cannnot) see it.  Even if you can see it, check if you can or cannot open it, modify it or delete it.  If any of these is still the case, then modify your question to clarify it, if you can;t see it and it's just a large amount of shared files for all users, then you should be good to go.\n", "Q: External Display is not behaving as expected When i plug my cable into my macbook pro it will show the default home screen on the tv but it doesn't show anything from my desktop. \nI can swipe over and see one thing from my dashboard but nothing else. What do i need to do to get to work?\n\nA: When you plug in an external monitor (or TV, etc) to your Mac, it merely extends the desktop area into it, so it can look blank except for your desktop background.  You can get it to mirror the display, so what you see on the external screen matches the Macbook itself, but that's not the default option.  There are various reasons for this, it nothing else the external screen is unlikely to have either the same display resolution or screen ratio, and so a mirrored display may well look odd as well as being a bit of a waste of the extra space.\nSo, you should be able to drag your apps and windows into it, although it's guesswork until you configure it whether it thinks that the display is left, right, above or below your existing screen.  Experiment by dragging a finder window across all edges, and note when it starts to appear on the TV.  The TV might be to the right of your macbook, but it may require pushing content off the left edge in order to use it...\nIn order to change this, and if you want it to become your main display so that the dock and menu bar and other desktop icons appear on it and don't want to just mirror the display (useful for example when connecting a Macbook at 1280x800 resolution up to a 1080p tv) then open up display preferences from system preferences, where you will be able to identify, position and configure both monitors, and drag the menu bar from one screen to another in order to make it the primary screen.\nIf you make the TV your primary screen, then unplug it, it will automatically revert.\n", "Q: What are the most modern browsers available on Mac OS 10.4 I have two old Mac Minis both running OS X 10.4 Tiger.\nOne is a G4 so I'm using TenFourFox for PowerPC.\nThe other has an Intel processor and I'm having some trouble with Opera 10.62.\n(The point is I want to use trello.com and old browsers like FireFox 3 or standard Safari from the 10.4 OS won't work). \nWhat other options am I missing?\n\nA: Sorry to resurrect this thread, but the answer has changed since last year. I'm posting this mainly for the benefit of people who will find this thread by googling \"modern web browser for tiger\". If you still use this computer, I would have to recommend you upgrade from Camino to Omniweb. \nCamino stopped updating their browser a few months ago and has no plans to continue support. Omniweb on the other hand is still being updated and supported and still runs on Tiger. Here is Omniweb running Trello.\n\n\nA: I would highly recommend downloading Camino. Camino is modern enough that it loads Trello:\n\n\nIt's based on the Mozilla project, so the GUI is very similar to early versions of Firefox:\n\n", "Q: Automator: pass-through input I have an \"ask for finder items\" step in my Automator workflow, which produces a list of files selected by the user.\nI then use these files as an input for a second step.\nAt that point I need to execute a bash command (third step).\nIn the fourth step, I need to use the original list of files as an input. How do I refer to it in Automator? Is there any pass-through for inputs?\nPlease note that re-ordering the steps is not an option.\nUPDATE: It seems the proposed solution does not work for me:\n\n\nA: It's very easy to do this; all you need to do is use the 'Set Value of Variable', execute your bash script, then use 'Get Value of Variable'. You can also set multiple variables, name them, etc. as you need. Take a look at the quick example I created, which should resemble what you are intending to do. You'll notice that after I set the variable my bash script searched for files elsewhere, then after that was completed I easily recalled the variable (files a, b, c).\n \n", "Q: How do I combine these two shell commands into a Service? I run the following two commands on markdown files to get a nicely formatted PDF.\npandoc file.md -o file.html --css=markdown.css \nprince file.html file.pdf\nrm file.html\n\nHow would I automate this? I'd like to right-click a markdown file, navigate to services, and choose convert markdown to PDF.\nI know I should use Automator and I tried but couldn't link the right steps together. In my example above, file is the filename that needs to be the argument.

I've tried the Shutterfly iPad app, which allows uploading photos, but doesn't support any other functionality available on the website. And I can't edit photos or design cards and books from the Mobile Safari browswer on the iPad, presumably because those features use Flash.\nAre there any other photo websites that provide either a full-featured iPad app (that includes creating cards and books and ordering prints) or an iPad or iPhone app that allows uploading photos and a website that allows one to create cards and books and order prints in Mobile Safari?\nNote: I download photos directly from my camera to the iPad, so I'm trying to figure out how to avoid any need for a PC.\nUpdate: Someone (on vark.com) recommended Apple's MobileMe.  But the official features list doesn't show that it supports editing photos and ordering prints, cards, and books.  Does anyone have experience with MobileMe?\n\nA: *\n\n*Adobe apps which fit your need according to editing photos or graphic designing.\nhttps://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/catalog/mobile.html\n\n\n*Canva online editor and app. I haven't used it, but have seen people.\nhttps://www.canva.com\n\nA: When using an iPad you will have to use an app for anything complex. Mobile browsers aren't built to deliver the desktop experience to mobile devices because they don't function like desktop and laptop computers.\nLook for apps that you can use to edit photos, then an app to create cards, then an app to order prints. There maybe a few apps that do all three, but you will be limited in one way or the other regardless of which apps you choose.\n", "Q: Software to balance sound levels and quality for iPhone Is there software that will balance the sound level of the songs on my iPhone so that all the songs are at the same sound level and quality?\n\nA: The \"Sound Check\" feature will ensure all your songs play back at approximately the same volume. In iOS 5, tap Settings -> Music -> then switch Sound Check to ON. \n", "Q: Unusual wifi issue with iPhone 4S I've had the iPhone for less than a week. And the issue occurs while using my home WiFi network. Basically, Siri does not work, and I also have difficulty with logging in to specific sites using the app for the site (as opposed to using Safari). \nWhile away from home using the carrier 3G network, Siri works very well. Also, as an example, I can use my local library app for using my library account. The App Store works fine.\nAt home with a strong wifi signal, Siri tells me that it can't deal with my request right now and the library app continuously loads and then times out. I also have endless loading/timeout issues with the App Store.\nMy guess is that it's either an issue with the wireless router/modem or the iPhone itself? \nThe router uses 801.11b/g. Other devices in the home (MacBook, Mac mini, a Windows machine, iPad 2, Nook Color) have no problem and perform as expected within the WiFi network. \nI have Googled and visited forums to troubleshoot this to no avail; and I'm not sure where to look next. Are there any ideas on possible router settings or iPhone settings that I need to consider at this point?\nMore info from a test:\n\nCellular Data Off / Wireless On:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Safari browse to various websites - OK \n  \n*Library App - Links in the app work except for the login page.\n  \n*Siri - Always says it can't help me right now and to try again in a little while.\n  \n  \n  Cellular Data On / Wireless Off:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Safari browse to various websites - OK\n  \n*Library App - Works properly - OK\n  \n*Siri - Works as expected - OK\n  \n\n\nA: I managed to solve this on my own: I gave my phone a static IP address different from the router assigned one, and everything works fine now.\nI discovered that my roommate had set up a particular IP address for VPN while working from home a while back. When I got the phone and joined the network, the router assigned my phone that IP address which had various Application and Port forwarding assigned to it. Simple but took digging around in the router settings and logs.\n", "Q: starting mysql from the console and my.cnf Is this possible to start mysql from the console. \nI tried with mysqld start but it fails to start, how to start it?\nI didn't find my.cnf in Mac, I wanted to change datadir settings, if there any way to do this?\nThanks!\n\nA: To start mysql, run mysqld_safe &. The ampersand at the end starts the process in the background, so you can continue to work while it runs. Most likely, it needs root privileges to run, so add sudo to the front if it doesn't work without (you will need to be logged in as an administrator).\nBy default, there is no my.cnf file. Defaults are used automatically. There are a few different starting files in the support-files folder, for different usage styles. You can copy any of them to start with, and place the file in any of these locations (in order searched): /etc/my.cnf /etc/mysql/my.cnf $MYSQL_DIR/etc/my.cnf ~/.my.cnf\n", "Q: Can't save files in my own directory due to insane permission error I was working on my mac and saved a file. Continued to work on the file. One hour later, when I tried to save that file, I saw the message \"The document could not be saved. You don't have permission\". What??? Now I see I cannot save any of my files. I can open them, but I cannot save. Any file. But this is selective. TextEdit can save the files, Mail.app can open emails and save attachments. Xcode can create and save new projects, but I cannot modify them, or I will see the error if I try to save.\nThis is what I have tried to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*chown, chmod -R 755, etc. on the directory containing my projects doesn't help.\n\n*Disk Utility > Repair Permissions doesn't help.\n\n*Reinstalling the app, clearing their .plists, etc. doesn't help.\n\n*I can create a new project or document with these apps (Xcode and Photoshop for example, just to name a few) and it saves the file on my documents directory, but if I change the document and try to save, I see the error.\n\n*I have rebooted the computer and also turned it off and on.\n\n*I did a safe mode boot and scanned the disk using /sbin/fsck -fy and no issues were found.\n\n*I have deleted all caches and application support files.\n\n*I did a chmod -R -N ~ on my documents directory, suspecting that some ACLs could be the guilty. No change.\n\n*I did a recursive chown to take ownership of my own files. The ownership was correct before, but I just did it again to clean anything that could be wrong.\n\n*I reinstalled both apps and nothing.\n\n\nWhat more I can? Cry?\nThoughts? Thanks\n\nA: I had the same problem.  I tried what Matt Love has suggested and still had the problems.  I then downloaded Cocktail and ran permission repair, rebooted and all worked again.\n\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, you're attempting to reset the permissions on a user's home directory. This is easily accomplished by resetting ACLs on the desired home directly by using the Reset Password utility in the Recovery Partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your computer from the recovery partition (if running Lion) or the gray disk (if not running Lion). \n\n*Open Disk Utility and run a permissions repair on your startup volume. \n\n*After this is complete, close Disk Utility and open Terminal from the Utilities menu. \n\n*Type in resetpassword and select your user account (NOT System Administrator/root) from the drop down menu. \n\n*Click the Reset button at the bottom of the window in the Reset home folder permissions and ACLs section. \n\n*Quit the Password Utility and go back to the main recovery screen. On your keyboard, hit ⌘ + Q and restart your computer.\nIt's very important that you don't hold down the power button to exit the recovery session, or the ACL reset won't occur.\nLet us know how it goes.\n\nA: It may be file ownership issue. Try changing the file's ownership to yourself. \n\n\n*\n\n*Run Terminal\n\n*Go to your file's folder\n\n*run sudo chown <your-user-name-here> <file-name-here> OR\nsudo chown -R <your-user-name-here> <folder-name-here>\nWhy does it happen?\nOne Reason: Sometimes applications or we use \"SUDO\" (which is to perform actions as a super user)  command to do different things. If any file is created as a super user (which is usually root) then \"root\" owns that file or folder.\n\nA: I have a simple answer. Go to Save As, under Where make sure you're saving it to your documents. I kept getting this error and realized it was saving to lines. Don't know how that happened but once I changed it to saving in Documents the problem went away. \n", "Q: How do I silence the message ringtone while talking? During a phone conversation on my iPhone (iOS5) today, I received three text messages. Each one caused my phone to play my message ringtone rather loudly in my ear.\nIs this normal behavior? Is there a way to adjust the volume of the ringer while on a call?\n\nA: Switch the Ring/Silent switch to Silent.\n\nA: Here is how things work. The alert volume can be controlled from the sound preference pane. If you have change with buttons on, you cannot use the physical buttons during a call since that changes the call volume and not the alert volume. (the two are distinct sliders). \nYou can use the slider to change things (requires the phone to move away from your ear to disengage the proximity sensor) or simply flip the silent switch when you are talking to avoid hearing any alerts except for the call in progress. \nMy read of your description is things are working as designed / normally and you can use the silent toggle rather than the volume buttons. \n", "Q: Time Capsule as media server? I want to set up a media server for streaming of my music library via AirPlay and AirPort express to my hifi. Is there any way to use time capsule for this or do I need to get (yet) another device? \n\nA: My best advice would be to invest in a NAS. Their software is much better for doing what you need. Synology is my favorite as their software is very intuitive and Mac like. A NAS also lets you do more with it like backup files, use it as a web server, host a blog, download files directly to it and stream both music and videos. If you check out our forum, @ mkvxstream.blogspot.com we have links posted to live demos of both Qnap and Synology.

Can I do any damage to files if I remove ACLs from them using something like\nchmod -RN /directoryWithABunchOfFiles\n\nWhat is the purpose of these ACL attributes?\n\nA: It depends on the purpose of the file you are removing them from.  Remove them from system files, and you may find a world of pain if you do it wrong or remove from the wrong file.  Your own files, less of a problem.\nACLs are a way of extending the normal permissions system that is used to control access to a file/folder.  Ordinarily the permissions system works by explicitly allowing either read, write or execute permissions against the owner, members of the same group, and other people.  An ACL allows you to extend that by providing exceptions and additions to these normal operations, so a file might be writable by the owner, readable by members of the same group (say Users), but not accessible to anyone else.  However you could drop an ACL in that allowed user Bob write access, even though the standard permissions should only allow him read access through his User grown membership.\n", "Q: Connect iPhone to Internet through laptop? I have a laptop at work that's connected to the the office LAN.\nI have an iPhone that sometimes can sort of connect via Sprint, but usually it's pretty slow.\nHowever, when I'm at the office, my iPhone/Sprint can barely connect at all. It's hopeless.\nIs there some way my laptop can create a WiFi network that my iPhone can use and thereby share my laptop's fast connection?\nI've tried going to \"Create network\" on my laptop, then \"Create computer-to-computer network\" and then on my iPhone going to Settings > WiFi > Choose a Network and actually connecting to that WiFi network I just created.\nOnce I do that, I can look in the iPhone's settings and verify that the phone is supposedly on that WiFi network and it has an I.P. address.\nHowever, in the upper-left area of my iPhone screen it still says, \"Sprint\" and there's a little circle after it. (Circle???)\nIn terms of functionality, the phone is still ridiculously slow as if it were still trying to use the more-or-less useless Sprint service.\nSo is there some better way to do this that allows my iPhone to get a fast connection?\n\nA: Sounds like Internet Sharing is what you want (go to System Preferences > Sharing). This post and video shows you how to switch it on, although I've not actually tried it myself.\nIIRC, the \"circle\" icon means you have a GPRS connection, not the faster EDGE or 3G connections.\n", "Q: Need help taking a screenshot during Keynote presentation I know Cmd+Shift+4 is how screenshots are normally taken of visible areas on Mac OS X, but this shortcut does not work during a Keynote Presentation. \n\nA: ⌘+Shift+3\n\nA: You can export a Keynote presentation in a number of formats, including jpg, tiff and png–no need for screenshots. \n⌘+Shift+4 snaps a picture of te selected portion of a screen, ⌘+Shift+3 is the shortcut for a full screenshot. \n\nA: OS X has a command-line tool called screencapture that makes a screenshot.

To use the example from @Daniel Beck, the new version would be like this.\nproperty NSWorkspace : class \"NSWorkspace\"\nset workspace to NSWorkspace's sharedWorkspace()\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell application process \"Terminal\"\n        click menu item (name of theWin) of menu of menu bar item \"Window\" of menu bar 1\n        workspace's launchApplication_(\"Terminal\")\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThe added code will use the Cocoa class NSWorkspace to \"launch\" the application, which raises only the frontmost window of that application to the front with focus.  For more detail on the process that brought me to this, I have a more thorough writeup on my website here.\n\nA: Here's another attempt, tested on macOS High Sierra. Alas, this is only works when the given window is on the current desktop! The AppleScript API to control windows seems to be incomplete, making this impossible.\nSubstitute \"Safari\" and \"WhatsApp\" for your use case.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Safari\"\n        try\n            set theWindow to (first window whose name contains \"WhatsApp\")\n            perform action \"AXRaise\" of theWindow\n            do shell script \"open -a Safari\"\n        end try\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThis does (visibly) raise the windows in two steps, however. It first raises the window to the top of the windows of the application, and only then raises it to the top of all windows. Not perfect, but functional.\n", "Q: What's the normal operating temperature for a unibody plastic Macbook? My Macbook seems to be running pretty hot lately.  iStat Pro is stating that my CPU temp is nearing 180 degrees F, and that the heatsink is approaching 150.  The laptop is noticeably warmer than normal on my lap even as I type this.  \nThe usage patterns for the laptop really haven't changed all that much, except that my wife takes it to work with her now that she's started her new job as a realtor.  \nThanks for any advice.\n\nA: It's the fans. They are clogged with dust and other debris from the years of use. Notebooks are not air-tight and intake quite a bit of air over their lifetime (they need to push the air to the central components like the CPU/GPU to cool them). The units must be opened and cleaned periodically (depending on environment) to maintain peak operating performance. High fan speeds and poor thermal dissipation are signs that the fans aren't doing their job (they are likely clogged with dust and the exhaust is also likely blocked, preventing the output of the hot air blown off from the processing units). Computer fans work by pushing air taking from the environment onto the CPU/GPU. The hot air blown off the chips move through air vents in the back of the unit. Over time, dust settles on the fans, dropping their efficacy, and the vents, preventing the hot air from escaping. This bakes the components and results in the spike in over temperature.\nVisit www.ifixit.com and pull up a guide on how to partially dismantle your notebook. If you are not technically proficient, bring it to a credible repair shop.\nThere are no \"normal\" operating temperatures for Apple notebooks, but there is an acceptable gradient. 82 degree Celsius is pushing the limits. The CPU's thermal threshold is 105 degrees Celsius (when that temperature is reached, the system will shutdown to prevent thermal damage).\nAnd just an aside, regardless of locale, all temperatures should be reported as Celsius, never Fahrenheit when dealing with computer components. Official documentation always refers to Celsius.\n\nA: I've got a late-2007 white Macbook and 180/150 isn't unusual.\n", "Q: How to reset the MissionControl/Expose/Spaces settings to defaults on Lion? I set Mission Control to \"Show Application Windows\" (Expose) with a mouse button or hot corner.  Great, it shows all of the windows of the current foreground app across all spaces/desktops.  \nHowever, I can't seem to get it to switch to the desktop containing the window I select, making it rather useless.   Is there another hidden option to do this?  How else are you supposed to use Expose to find app windows across spaces and bring the found window to the front?!\nAlso it would be great if there were a way to go directly from the Mission Control display (multiple apps, pile of windows, scroll to spread 'em) directly to the Expose showing all of the windows unpiled for the selected app.  Anyone?\nSeems Apple is about 80% of the way there on this one but despite the fancy graphics is missing the most basic use case. No wonder people want to revert to Snow Leopard.\nUpdate:  seems there is a problem with the settings, perhaps due to the system being migrated from a SnowLeopard machine.  Creating a new user acct on Lion does not show the problem--Expose works correctly (it switches) for the new user.   So, now I've updated the question to  \"How to reset the MissionControl/Expose/Spaces settings to defaults on Lion?\"\n\nA: just go to system preferences click keyboard and disable launchpad and mission control then \nclick trackpad and go to the third tab and disable mission control and launchpad\n", "Q: How can I tell if my iPad is syncing to my PC or iCloud? My iPad \"synced\" to iTunes once so I could set some settings. My iPad (iPad 2 iOS 5.0.1) is set to sync to iCloud. However when I set off a backup, iTunes opens on my PC and it seems that iTunes is doing the sync.\nIs my data being saved in iCloud, on my PC or both? Can I get it to sync just to iCloud but be able to manage it via iTunes? I don't want the backup to eat space on my PC.\n\nA: You can tell if you are backing up to iCloud by going to Settings > iCloud > Storage & Backup on your iPad. Look at the bottom of that page and it will indicate when the last backup was. \nIn iTunes, on the Summary tab there is a check box to backup to iCloud. If you ever want to backup to the computer you can Cmd-click on the device in the iTunes sidebar and select backup now ( or something like that). \nSyncing and backup are not the same thing.\n\nA: Here's one way to tell:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPad to your computer (via USB cable).\n\n*Start iTunes.\n\n*Look for your iPad on the left in the Devices section.\n\n*Select your iPad.\n\n*Look at the Backup section.\n\n\nYou should have the choice to either backup to iCloud or backup to this computer.\nTo save your data to iTunes, select the first option.  And you can still manage your iPad's content via iTunes, using it to add apps, music, movies, etc.  This is what I do with multiple iDevices.\n", "Q: What should I do when the menu bar seems frozen/unresponsive? Several times the menu bar on my Mac has frozen and I've had to restart the whole computer. I know that there must be a better way to fix a frozen menu bar than restarting. How can I kill the menu bar via Terminal?\n\nA: In addition to the Terminal option @Nathan Greenstein gave, you can also force quit the SystemUIServer process using the Activity Monitor utility.\nBTW, SystemUIServer is only responsible for the menu items (i.e. the right side of the menu bar).  If more than that is frozen, this may not do the trick.  OTOH, if it is just SystemUIServer, you probably have a buggy menu item and should try to isolate which one is causing the problem and remove or update it.\n\nA: SystemUIServer is the process responsible for the menu bar and any menu extras. You can restart it in Terminal using:\nkillall SystemUIServer\n\n", "Q: Is there an iTunes Visualizer that displays the full song's waveform? Is it possible for iTunes Visualizers to access the entirety of song data in order to display a full, un-animated waveform of the currently playing song? Perhaps the extent of the visualization would be a progress bar that sweeps over the song as it plays.\nAssuming this is even possible, does something like this already exist?\n\nA: I don't think it exists, since Quartz provides limited input for the iTunes track, and mostly real-time.\nQuartz is the graphic layer of Mac OS X. Quartz Composer is a tool used to easily create animations, transitions, filters, visualizers, etc that work with this technology. As far as I know it is the only way of making an iTunes visualizer.\nWhen you attempt to create a new visualizer in the latest version, you get a pretty straight-forward of the input you'll get from iTunes:\n\nHere´s a closer look:\n\nThere is no file input of any kind. Not even the filename/path, and even if there were Quartz are graphic libraries, thus it's ability for processing data, including sound waveforms is limited. All this input is received in real time, sent by iTunes: Quartz can only receive the numbers/text it is being given in real time, but not actually call any read operations on the sound file, and decode it to a sound wave.\nI'll have to say, at least with Quartz Composer, no, it is not quite achievable. I don't think you can create iTunes visualizers in any other way, and I haven't seen a visualizer with such functionality.\nHope it helps!\nKevin\n\nA: There is nothing within iTunes that can do this, but there is an external audio editing program called Fission (US $32), from Rogue Amoeba Software, that will display a full waveform for any file in your iTunes library (without the need to convert the file to another format first). Fission has a free trial. Select a song in iTunes, go to File: Show in Finder, and then open the revealed file in Fission.\n", "Q: Is there a way to auto-complete the open command in Terminal?

Thanks @Lri\n\n*It can handle spaces in application names, and quotation enclosed program names, but it's rather hacky. It requires the quote to be the first character: While Scan\" to \"P is valid in bash, this program will not detect it.

I know that instead of HDD it uses flash memory but how can it save more power and boot faster?\n\nA: There are a number of benefits to flash memory over HDD:\n\n\n*\n\n*No moving parts\n\n*No spin up time\n\n*No electric motor using your battery charge\n\n*\"Seek Time\" isn't really a thing, since there's no drive head moving to read a different sector of HDD platter\n\n\nDuring boot, your computer reads a lot of software from your boot volume into memory. The time it takes to do this is drastically reduced when using a SSD (flash) instead of an HDD.\n\nA: An SSD (flash memory) uses less power, so battery life tends to increase (additionally, a Macbook Air uses less power than most other computers in general, which also helps battery life).  \nAdditionally, a SSD is much faster.  There are two important methods of accessing data on a drive - sequential and random access.  Sequential access is when you are accessing a large amount of data in the same spot (a movie, for example).  Hard drives are best at this, though SSD's are still a few times faster (2x-5x, depending on the drives in question - the one in the Macbook Air will tend towards the lower end of this range).  \nRandom access is when you are accessing data that is stored in small amounts all across the disk.  Here, SSDs are much better than conventional hard drives (20x-100x faster).  This is because there is basically no seek time for SSDs (there is no spinning disk).  Seek times are what slow conventional hard drives down so much.  This sort of access is common when booting up, launching applications, and switching between applications, which is why the Macbook Air boots quickly and will generally feel faster than its other tech specs would suggest.\nIn short, an SSD provides a massive performance boost over a normal hard drive.  The only issue is that they tend to be expensive, which is less of an issue with the Macbook Air (though it does explain why the hard drive in the Macbook Air is so small).\n\nA: Access time from flash memory is faster. Traditional platter-based hard drives are operated by a motor to spin the platters; flash memory does not use any motors.\n", "Q: Are the downloads for OS X updates different depending on the language?

The folder contains subfolders which have images and video files.\nI am burning by dropping the folder onto a blank DVD on the desktop, opening it up and clicking \"Burn\", then using maximum speed to burn. At the end of the burn finder brings up a message saying that it couldn't verify the burn, and ejects the disc. \nIf I insert the disc back into the Mac, I get a message saying that it cannot be read.\nI have done this 4 times only one disc has worked. All four times were done in the same method. The discs are Verbatim 4.7GB 16x DVD-R\nHow can I complete the burn successfully?\nUpdate\nThe error codes is:\n\nThis disc can’t be verified and might be unreliable. Try again using a new blank disc (error code 0x80020063).\n\nI have researched the error and not a lot is written, just that I should try to close the finder window as soon as the disc starts to burn. This would seem like a very simple bug that Apple would have fixed by now.\nI tried this and it didn't work. However I used a Verbatim DVD-RW 4x speed and the message poped up again, yet when I inserted the DVD it worked and all the data was on it.\n\nA: Try burning the DVD at the lowest data rate possible - the higher the burn speed, the more likely you might get burn errors. \nI normally burn at 4x and have never had a problem. Though if your drive is having a problem, a lower rate will help (eg 1x)\n\nA: 1) Make sure you're using good media.  If it comes on a spindle, it's probably too cheap to be very good. Taiyo Yuden is very highly-regarded when it comes to recordable discs.\n2) If good media does not solve the problem, you most likely have a failing optical drive.\nAddendum: Just because the data is \"all there\" when the disc is inserted does not mean it was recorded properly. disc table of contents (TOC) is written separately from the actual files, the files may very well seem to be \"there\" while still being unreadable. The only way to verify after a disc burn is to actually open and read all the recorded files. This is in essence what OS X does when it is \"verifying\" the recording—it is reading back everything that should be there and comparing it to the original.\n\nA: You are not doing anything wrong procedurally, so there are only 2 possible culprits:\n1) your drive is on the way out\n2) your media is not suitable.\nBlank media will have a suggested maximum write speed, but there is nothing to stop you exceeding this speed.  Check what the disc wants, and ensure that your drive does not exceed this.  If you can borrow an external writer and test with the same media/settings etc, this may help pinpoint if the drive or disc is at fault.\nMany unbranded blank discs will not show maximum write speeds, and shouldn't be trusted.\n\nA: I had the same problem. For me it was a dirty superdrive. I was going to replace it when  I saw that the superdrive was possible to open! So I opened it and it was ALOT of dust. As I diden't really have any actual hope for it I used my breath to get som moisture on the optical thing and brushed it of! Then put in a new disk and it actually succeeded.\nI love my laptop it been through soo many drops and even replaced the display! Good Luck! \n", "Q: What could be wrong with an Ethernet port on a black macbook? In my house is an older black macbook. If I plug it into the house ethernet with a cable, youtube videos pause and spin the throbber and other network operations are also sluggish.\nIf I disconnect the cable and turn on WiFi, all is well. The TimeCapsule supplying the WiFi plugins into the same hub as the aforementioned cable (though there are many more feet of wiring involved).\nIs there an log on Lion that would tell me if the ethernet interface was getting errors, or getting sick?\n\nA: You would normally expect better performance from a wired connection, even it it is slower on paper, so there would seem to be a problem, and it would be anywhere on the physical connection from the macbook to the internet router.  I would first check what sort of connection you have, 10 half duplex would be bad, 100 full better (1Gb full best, but I don't know if the blackbooks had gigabit ethernet).  Check this out on your switch/router and your macbook if you can.  It could be set/requested at either end of the connection.  A bad cable could force a slower auto-negotiated rate too, so try swapping it out.\n\nA: I advise you to look at the output of the following command:\nnetstat -I en0\n\nThe Ierrs & Oerrs columns should be stucked to 0.\nIf your network location is the infamous Automatic one, check that it isn't automatically\nswitching your connection from Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and whatever may have been detected magically.\nThis magical switching is your first ennemy when you are trying to trouble shoot any network problem.\n", "Q: Time Machine forgets old backups? I use a 2 TB drive for Time Machine and have used the disk for about a year or two.\nToday I wanted to check on an old file (an old version of MonoDevelop) and found out that my oldest backup is from January this year.\nI checked the disk itself and found that it really only contains folders for dates starting in January.\nWhat did Time Machine do to my old backups???\n(There was always enough room on the disk and there are 1.4 TB free now. I never deleted anything in the backups.backupdb folder.)\n\nA: The system will delete old backups if it has an estimate that it will need the space for the impending backup. Normally the system over estimates a backup by 2 to 4 GB in routine use, but I have seen some cases where it had estimates of 250 GB or more due to some folder changes. Even without an error in estimation, you could have attached an external drive that increased this estimate drastically. \nOnly you have the logs and data to know how plausible this is. Check out BackupLoupe if you like to have better measurements on how each backup differs in size from the others. \nFor this reason, I periodically duplicate my Time Machine drives (or choose to rotate them monthly) so that if there is a bug, I can look when I swap in the new drive to make sure I don't lose some of my older history.\n\nA: bmike's answer is correct. Time Machine will delete backups if there isn't enough space on your hard drive. However, he did leave out a key bit of information. There is a checkbox in System Preferences>Time Machine that tells Time Machine to notify you when it deletes old backups.\n\nIIRC, this checkbox is not checked by default, so it probably isn't on.\n", "Q: Mail.app doesn't load new emails because is synchronizing a deleted email with large attachment I created a new message in Mail with some pictures attached. When I noticed it was more than 10 MB, I didn't send it and deleted the draft. But my settings included \"synchronize drafts with server\", which I turned off now. Mail.app apparently tries to load the message again and again, and it appears in a local folder (recovered mails) even after I deleted it several times. Meanwhile there are four duplicates of the message with about 45 MB worth of attachments in this local folder.\nThe worst thing about it: Mail does not get new incoming emails.\nWhat can I do about it?\nOS X 10.7.3 and Mail Version 5.2\n\nA: First disconnect from the internet AND quit Mail.app.\nSecond, click on the Finder icon in the Dock. Choose the 'Go' menu in the menubar and hold down the 'option' key on your keyboard. With the 'option' key held down, you'll see an item in the menu called 'Library' - this is your user library, and not your hard disk or system library.\nFrom this Library folder, you'll see the Mail folder. Navigate through V2/{yourEmailaddress.mbox)> and hunt around for either /Recovered Mail/ or /Drafts/ folders inside. It's in there somewhere. Delete the file or the entire folder if there's nothing else inside that you want.\nOnce that's done, reconnect to the internet, but do not start Mail. Go to your webmail provider and ensure that the file you found above is not on the server. I know you said you checked that already, but you should check again that there is no 'recovered mail' or you're going to have to start this whole process all over again...\nOnce that's done, restart Mail and reconnect to the internet. \nFrom the menubar at the top choose Mailbox > Rebuild.\n\nA: You may be able to control what Mail is doing by opening the Activity window. From Mail's Window menu, choose Activity. This shows the tasks that are in progress, and if you see any related to saving, syncing, or duplicating drafts or attachments, hit the red stop sign icon on the right of the applicable row.\n\nA: Try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a webmail option with this account, you might be able to delete the message from there.\n\n*Alternately, in the Account prefs under Mailbox Behaviors, uncheck the \"Store draft messages on server\" option. Restart Mail and see if you can then delete it. You may just have to let Mail run for a while till it loads this.\n\n*A third option may be to delete the Drafts folder at ~/Library/Mail/V2/your_email_account/Drafts.mbox. Then restart Mail and it should be recreated. This may only work after #2 above.\n\nA: I find that I often have to force quit Mail.app and then problems like this resolve themselves.\nApple has a KB article on How to Force quit that can be found here: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3411\n", "Q: No sound from speakers on MacBook Pro except the startup chime After plugging my headphones out, suddenly there is no sound from the internal speakers.\nWhen I press volume buttons, I see a circle-backslash symbol below the speaker icon.\nRestarting doesn't help.

Or how to solve a problem at all?\nI'll be very grateful for reply.\nP.S. Also when some page hangs while loading and I hit refresh, it usually loads instantly. So it's now a problem with an internet connection.\n\nA: The characters you posted are what you get if you take the text at the bottom of this post, encode it as UTF-8, and then (mistakenly) decode it as UTF-16BE.\nUltimately, Safari is decoding the data incorrectly (it should be decoded as UTF-8, but it is being decoded as UTF-16BE). It might do this for any one of several reasons:\n\n*\n\n*The server incorrectly told Safari to decode as UTF-16BE (e.g. via a charset parameter in the Content-Type header of the server’s HTTP response).\n\n*The server incorrectly prepended a UTF-16BE BOM before the UTF-8 data.\n\n*Safari is configured to default to UTF-16BE.\nI am not sure how this would be actually be accomplished though. The only UTF entry in the manual encoding list†  is “Unicode (UTF-8)”, which would seem to preclude forcing UTF-16BE (unlike TextEdit where you can actually select UTF-16BE, if you customize its list of encodings).\n\n*Safari auto-detected the encoding incorrectly.\n\nYour particular problem seems likely to be a server (or proxy‡) problem since you say that it is only happening intermittently.\nThe Network tab of Safari’s Web Inspector can show you the server response headers (to confirm or deny an erroneous charset parameter), but it would be probably be annoying to always have to remember to open/enable it for each tab you open (to capture the information it must already be active before when the page of interest is loaded—which may be difficult to predict if your problem is intermittent).\nA packet capture could identify an erroneous BOM (and/or an erroneous charset), but such tools are much less convenient (also usually useless for encrypted (HTTPS) requests). If you know that the problem occurs fairly often, you might be able to send many requests through curl and try to identify erroneous BOMs/charsets by looking at the data it can report (server response headers and the raw content bytes).\n†You can manually choose an encoding (in Safari 5.1) via the View menu’s Text Encoding submenu.\n‡Such a proxy might be a “transparent” proxy that you might not otherwise suspect.\n\n<!-- LOCALIZERS: Each localizable piece of the page is marked with a comment -->\n\n<HTML>\n<!-- LOCALIZERS: If in a right-to-left locale, add dir=\"rtl\" to the HTML element. -->\n<HEAD>\n    <LINK rel=stylesheet type=\"text/css\" href=\"page-load-errors.css\">\n    <!-- LOCALIZERS: You might want to change the font family.

The exact update was probably the 10.7.3 update which added localization for several languages, including Ukrainian.\nI do not have a 10.7 system, but the above content (apart from the Ukrainian <title> text) is largely identical to the content of files from 10.6 (Safari 5.1.3) with names like /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Resources/*.lproj/StandardErrorPage.html; all these files (on 10.6 Safari 5.1.3) are UTF-16LE encoded with a leading (UTF-16LE) BOM. This points strongly to the second possible reason I described: the “server” (actually just a local file) is supplying content with an incorrect BOM.\nIf you can identify the file used for your particular localization, you can probably “fix” it. As a guess, the Ukrainian file is probably something like …/ua.lproj/StandardErrorPage.html.\nNote: Modifying this file might break Safari’s “code signature”. On 10.6, the English version of this file is listed in the …/Safari.app/Contents/_CodeSignature/CodeResources file as “optional”, so it might be okay (I have not tried it). If you do try editing/replacing the file, make a backup first! To be safe, you could make a copy of the whole Safari.app folder.\nYou can use a hex editor (e.g. HexFiend) to adjust the leading BOM bytes. If you are actually dealing with a file that starts with (hex) FE FF (UTF-16BE BOM) and is followed by UTF-8 encoded data (i.e. the following bytes are for <!-- LOCALIZERS: without NUL (hex 00) bytes between the characters), then you can probably just delete the first two bytes (Safari should then be able to auto-detect the content as UTF-8). Alternatively you could replace the leading, two-byte sequence FE FF with the three-byte sequence EF BB BF (i.e. the UTF-8 encoding of U+FEFF).\nYou can practice on a copy of the file if you want to try out the result before replacing the file that Safari actually uses. Just copy the file to your desktop (or wherever), hex edit that copy, then open it with Safari. After making the correct modifications (and reloading the page) you should see the Ukrainian title in the title bar and several lines of %@ in the page itself (instead of the old page of Chinese/Korean/etc. characters).\nHopefully, Apple will fix all this in some new Safari/Lion update.\n", "Q: How can I manually delete old backups to free space for Time Machine?

If you want to be safer, you can pick one snapshot to delete first to be sure the command works as intended. This is nice since it could take hours to clean up some larger backup sets and you want to leave the Mac confident it's deleting the correct information store.\nYou can use the tmutil tool to delete backups one by one.\nsudo tmutil delete /Volumes/drive_name/Backups.backupdb/mac_name/YYYY-MM-DD-hhmmss\n\nSince tmutil was introduced with Lion, this will not work on earlier OS versions.\nIf you want to get the current directory of backups (there can be multiple destinations defined and only one will be \"current\")\nsudo tmutil machinedirectory\n\nIf you back up to a network share, you may have sparse bundle storage and if so, that needs to be compacted as well.\nsudo hdiutil compact /Volumes/drive_name/Backups.backupdb/mac_name.sparsebundle\n\n\nA: This script will automatically find the oldest TM backup for your computer, tell you which is the oldest and newest backup and provide you with a prompt to delete the oldest backup.

However there's an aspect that's lacking which may be a new implementation \"detail\" that didn't exist when this question was answered.\ntmutil delete does indeed delete backups, but doesn't actually reclaim the space they took, at least not in any guaranteed way. I spent about 2 whole days deleting backups from >2y ago, which according to final completion message amounted to approx. 400Gb of data. I did see the free backup space indication go up correspondingly once, but after the next backup I was down again to only 7% available space (858Gb used instead of around 450Gb). That really had me stymied.\nThe answer to that mystery is given here: http://blog.hawkimedia.com/2012/08/reclaiming-a-timemachine-volumes-disk-space/\nIn short, you have to compact the sparse bundle that actually holds the backup if it is hosted on a networked disk, or on a disk that is not formatted in HFS+.\nI don't have TM backups that are not hosted in a sparse bundle so cannot check if using tmutil delete does reclaim free on those. It might well do and the fact it doesn't on a Time Capsule may simply be a peculiarity of the sparse bundle protocol.\nThe command to execute after sudo tmutil delete is sudo hdiutil compact /Volumes/YourTimeMachineDisk/YourBackupName.sparsebundle . In my case that reported\nStarting to compact…\nReclaiming free space…\n...................................................................................................................................\nFinishing compaction…\nReclaimed 403.2 GB out of 583.5 GB possible.\n\nThe good news is that this command took only a fraction of the time tmutil took, spending much less time seeking on the disk and using less RAM (in fact it completed in the time it took me to write this answer).\n\nA: If Time Machine is really only backing up differences, deleting in reverse order is not what you want. Plus given that each delete can take some time, having a script that will delete the next one when the current one completes would be nice.\nFollowing user36971's sample script above, I've written up one that'll delete all backups from the one specified and earlier:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ -z \"$1\" ]\nthen\n    echo \"must specify backup id: YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nFOUND_BACKUP=0;\nBACKUPS=\"\"\nwhile read line; do\n    if [[ \"${line}\" == *$1* ]]\n    then\n        FOUND_BACKUP=1;\n    fi\n\n    if [ \"${FOUND_BACKUP}\" == \"1\" ]\n    then\n        BACKUPS+=\"${line}\"$'\\n'\n    fi\ndone < <(/usr/bin/tmutil listbackups | tail -r)\n\nif [ \"${FOUND_BACKUP}\" == \"0\" ]\nthen\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nprintf '%s' \"$BACKUPS\"\n\necho -n \"Delete above backups?

Even when the volume on my MBP running 10.7.2 is set to only one bar - it is too loud for my use.\nWhen using headphones, the minimum and maximum volume configuration is just fine. This is not the case when using the internal speakers.\nHow can I set a lower minimum volume on my Mac?\n\nA: An alternate way to control the volume is one from the terminal. For example:\nsudo osascript -e \"set Volume 3.5\"\n\nThis will set the volume to 50% (the scale is 0-7 using the terminal). \nYou can use whole numbers or decimal numbers. A higher or lower number will make the volume go up and down in intensity (again 0-7).\nThis will put your volume at super quiet:\nsudo osascript -e \"set Volume 0.1\"\n\nThis will put the volume at an even quieter setting:\nsudo osascript -e \"set Volume 0.01\"\n\nAs @timothymh stated, for 1/4 (0.25) increment control without the terminal, you can hold Shift + Option while using the F11 or F12 keys to adjust the volume by 1/4 (0.25) increments.\nUsing the keyboard will only give you 64 adjustments of volume control 16*4 = 64\nUsing the terminal you can achieve 700 options for volume control 7*100 = 700\n\nA: starting in 10.7.4 (and versions prior to Lion) you can adjust the volume in 1/4 the normal increment. You can get down to 1/4 bar using ⌥+⇧+F11 and ⌥+⇧+F12\n\nA: This only gives you one more notch below 1, but it might do as much as you need it to. Use the decrease volume button to lower the volume to 0. Then, press the Mute button once. This will let sound play, but at a lower volume than 1.\nAlso, you can change the volume in 1/4 increments with the following shortcuts:\n\n\n*\n\n*⇧ + ⌃ + volume buttons in Snow Leopard\n\n*⇧ + option + volume buttons in Lion or later\n\n", "Q: What traffic is sent over the build-in VPN connection? Under System Preferences > Network > VPN > Advanced > Options I can choose to \"Send all traffic over VPN connection\".\nContrariwise, this would mean that if this option is not enabled (which is default) some traffic is treated as if no VPN connection was established: e.g. The IP address when surfing is still the same.\nWhat traffic is (not) sent over VPN when this option is disabled?\n\nA: This really depends on the routes your VPN server is pushing when you connect. It could push only routes to private networks or it could push a route for the default gateway.\n\nA: If you're using Windows PPTP VPN, all traffic will be routed through the VPN by default.  Your computer becomes literally a part of your office network just like you were at work.\nIf you don't want that, going to the advanced TCP/IP properties and disabling Use Default Gateway on Remote Network will change the routing of your internet traffic.  You'll still be able to access your office network, but then internet traffic will go to your network card's default gateway locally (just like you were not connected to the VPN).\n", "Q: Ubuntu on Mac (dual-boot).

Situation: Filevault 2 passwords can be stolen\nPassware has released the Passware Kit Forensic 11.3 which is able to steal the FileVault 2 password from the RAM by performing a DMA Attack via the FireWire port.\nThey state that their software:\n\n*\n\n*recovers Mac User Login passwords and FileVault keys from computer memory and\n\n*decrypts TrueCrypt and FileVault volumes in minutes.\n\nVarious suggestions have been made trying to describe how to protect a Mac with Filevault 2 from such an attack:\nsudo pmset -a destroyfvkeyonstandby 1 hibernatemode 25\n\nThis will remove the full volume encryption key from RAM when the system is put into sleep mode and forces the system to immediately write RAM to disk and remove power from memory upon sleep.\nQuestion:\nWhat user behavior is necessary and what steps does one have to take for maximum protection with FileVault 2 on the Mac?\n\nA: Could someone steal your machine? Besides preventing electronic access, you'd need to keep it under lock & key.  \nSeriously, at each step, you get the most improvement by covering the then weakest point; once your software defenses are better than the physical ones, better software defenses add no (or barely any) improvement.\n\nA: Your question contains the most important thing needed to secure a computer against a motivated attack to compromise a FileVault 2 protected Mac volume.\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't connect FireWire to a device you don't or can't trust while you are logged in to an account that has file vault keys active.\n\n*Pick good single use passwords to reduce the chance of other compromises degrading the security of your FileVault password.\n\n*Update to 10.7.3 and verify sudo pmset -a destroyfvkeyonstandby 1 hibernatemode 25 power management settings that force hibernate mode to secure your keys from compromise when the device would normally \"sleep\"\n\n\nI do follow Rich Trouton to keep up to date on his blog for nice commentary on securing macs. The mix of up to date topics seasoned with experience as a real world system administrator make his writing very valuable to me.\nThe crux of the issue is your parsing What user behavior is necessary to have security. I always like to think of security as a mindset and ongoing attempt to plan, implement, measure and adapt. Security isn't something you buy or something you \"set up\" and training users to actually not divulge the passcode they have used to store their unlock phrase is the weakest part of FileVault's security layer. Not reusing that passcode - having a system where you get your users to understand why their keychain password needs to be unique and secure is far, far harder and takes far longer than just setting up a plan for implementing file vault initially. Best of luck in your quest for security!\n", "Q: Apple TV works with my iPhone but not with my PC on the same wireless network I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows 7 PC with latest version of iTunes connected to my network (wired).

I don't see the Apple TV from iTunes on the PC. (I don't see the iPhone either under sharing but I don't know if it should show up there or not).\nI don't think it's a router issue otherwise it wouldn't work with the iPhone either.\nI have reinstalled iTunes on the PC and rebooted all devices (router, PC, Apple TV).\nWhat do you think could be the problem?\n\nA: This sounds like a home sharing issue to me. I would check that the Apple ID you have set in iTunes on your PC matches the ID you have configured for home sharing on the Apple TV and that the password is correct for both.\n\nA: Okay, AirTunes uses a protocol that is different from AirPlay mirroring, used by the iPhone.\nThe AirTunes part of the AirPlay protocol stack uses UDP for streaming audio and is based on the RTSP network control protocol.\nWhat I would do first:\n1) Turn off QoS or any protocol-dependent traffic shaping on your router.\n2) All apple technologies are bonjour-dependent, I would check if there if there is an avahi service running on your router, using one of the following apps:\nhttp://hobbyistsoftware.com/bonjourbrowser\nhttp://www.stg.com/zeroconf_explorer.html\n\nA: The best way to troubleshoot this will be to get WinDump or some other tcpdump equivalent program and verify that the mDNS packets being broadcast by your Apple TV are being seen by client programs running on your PC. You can power cycle the Apple TV or just exit and re-join the network while capturing to ensure it's not a network or firewall issue.\nOnce that's decided, you can look into iTunes drivers or software conflicts or address the networking issue as your specific circumstances dictate.\n\nA: It seems everybody is having problems with this, including myself. You could try to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change wireless security from WPA to WEP (couldn't test)\n\n*Turn off wireless sync between your iDevices and iTunes (did no good)\n\n*Reinstall Bonjour (unistalling everything Apple/iTunes related and then installing iTunes again didn't help me)\n\n*Restart \"Apple Mobile Device\" service on your Windows computer (again no good)\n\n*Buy a Mac ;) - it seems it all comes down to this\n\n", "Q: Using FileVault 2 on non-boot disk with moved home directory I have OS X Lion installed on an SSD which is encrypted with FileVault 2. I have a second magnetic hard drive that I've moved my home directory to in order to not take up space on the SSD. \nMy question is, will it cause any problems if I encrypt the second drive (the standard magnetic HDD) using the command line?\nI've read through this:\nhttp://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7.ars/13#lion-file-system\nbut I didn't see my specific case mentioned. Has anyone successfully done this without losing their data or boot capabilities?\n\nA: You don't need to reformat your disk to enable encryption. To encrypt a drive on Lion, you can use the following command:\ndiskutil cs convert /Volumes/your_drive_name_here -passphrase\n\nYou’ll then be prompted for the passphrase you want to set and get output similar to what’s shown below:\ncomputer name:~ username$ diskutil cs convert /Volumes/your_drive_name_here -passphrase\nNew passphrase for converted volume:\nConfirm new passphrase:\nStarted CoreStorage operation on disk2s1 your_drive_name_here\nResizing disk to fit Core Storage headers\n[ - 0%..10%.............................................. ]\nCreating Core Storage Logical Volume Group\nAttempting to unmount disk2s1\nSwitching disk2s1 to Core Storage\nWaiting for Logical Volume to appear\nMounting Logical Volume\nCore Storage LVG UUID: D1EAB2C3-EC21-41DA-AD60-75E1302E247B\nCore Storage PV UUID: 991C89E9-A628-408C-AAFF-39A561FCB95C\nCore Storage LV UUID: 36483526-6C2C-43FA-A4B7-6F503473F1C2\nCore Storage disk: disk3\nFinished CoreStorage operation on disk2s1 your_drive_name_here\nEncryption in progress; use diskutil coreStorage list for status\n\nYou’ll want to leave the Mac up and running while the drive is encrypting, as the encryption process may fail if interrupted. To check on its progress, run the following command:\ndiskutil cs list\n\nCheck the list displayed for the name of the drive you’re encrypting. When you find it, look for Size (Converted):, as that will tell you how far along the encryption is.\nOnce the encryption is finished, it should report Conversion Status: Complete\nFor more information, see here.\n\nA: FileVault on Mac OS X Lion uses full disk encryption, where the encryption level is beyond the file system. This means that software is oblivious to the fact that your data is encrypted. If you were using an earlier version (or the legacy option) of FileVault, then this would pose a potential problem, but all data on the disk will be encrypted, and OS X wouldn't even care.\n", "Q: Open app in current directory when another app with the same name exists, from command line I have an app name foo.app I want to open from command line (using open).\nMy folder structure is like this:\n~\n+---bar\n     +--- foo.app\n+---baz\n     +--- foo.app\n\nI want to open the app located in the bar folder, however if I do open -a foo.app, the app located in the baz folder will open, even if my current working directory is in the bar folder.\nopen -a ./foo.app or open -a ~/bar/foo.app doesn't work either.\n\nA: In this case, open -a is NOT what you want; the -a option is for launching known applications (indexed in the Launch Services database that lets you open a document and get the right application) by name, not by pathname, or for opening files with a given application.\nWhat you are looking for is just plain opening foo.app, just like you double-clicked it in the Finder. To do that,\nopen foo.app\n\nThis will open exactly that application, without involving the Launch Services database at all.\n\nA: \nopen bar/foo.app/Contents/MacOS/foo\n\nIf you're using the -a parameter to open, then you need to omit the .app extension.\n", "Q: How to recreate libraries in iTunes My problem is this. I have my language lessons and my music in different folders on an external hard drive. For some reason my libraries got mucked up (by opening iTunes when the hard drive wasn't connected). So I need to set up my libraries again.\nWhat I want to do is set up two separate libraries: Language Lessons and Music. I know this is possible because I've done it, and set the location to the respective folders. The problem is that the new libraries I set up are empty -- there are no songs or lessons in the playlist! So how do I get iTunes to populate my playlists? I've found two alternatives but neither is satisfactory:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on each individual song/lesson in the folder to play it, and iTunes then lists it in the playlist. This is ridiculous as I have about 4,000 songs.\n\n*Physically drag the folder containing the Songs or Language lessons onto the window. This copies all the songs in the folder into that playlist. The problem is that I don't want it to copy my 4,000 songs into a new folder (which exceeds the space limit on the hard disc drive), I just want iTunes to populate each library with the songs in the existing folder.\nI'm sure this is a dumb newbie kind of question, but there is nothing in the Mac documentation that even suggests how this can be done.\nUsing MacBook Pro, MacOS 10.6.8.\n\nA: You can add your files to your iTunes library without having iTunes copy the files to its own folder. Go to iTunes > Preferences > Advanced and un-check Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to Library. This will let you drag-and-drop entire folders into iTunes, and it will add them to its iTunes Library xml file without making copies of all of your files. \n(If you keep that checked and un-check the other option on that preference pane, Keep iTunes Media folder organized, iTunes will copy all of the files you drag into it, but it will preserve the naming and file structure of the original source folder.)\n", "Q: How can I stop Finder from converting and loading videos to display in movie icons?

We use the package name \"odcctools\", due to a lineage from OpenDarwin. Regardless, if you use the version of strings from there on a binary that was not linked by the linker in that same package, you will get an error, but can solve that by putting strings in raw mode using \"-\"; so: \"strings - myBinary\".\n", "Q: SophosAV slows the dictionary pop-up I've got the virus scanner from Sophos installed on my Mac with on-access-scan enabled.\nThe on-access-scan delays the dictionary pop-up for several seconds for every first prompt after boot up.\nYou can prompt the dictionary pop-up by using either ctrl+⌘+D or three fingers double-tab.\nI can choose to disable on-access-scan for /Applications/Dictionary.app in the SophosAV preferences. However, this does not solve the problem. What should I do?\n\nA: I'm stupid.

A user with an\n  administrator account can access your entire computer.\n\nYou can see the drive because you are an administrator, and you entered your password on the windows machine. If you hadn't entered your password (or had used a non-administrator account) you wouldn't have been able to see the drive. \n\nA: I had the same issue so I looked around a bit. The info you guys are providing is correct. However I would like to add that this strange behavior is associated with the Apple ID used in both computers.\nI saw this using two computers A (old) and B (new). I needed to pass information from A to B. So I shared files on B and acceses it from A. To my surprise I got access to HD and my home folder. Then I realised that I had set up the same Apple ID on both computers so it was being used for login purposes.\nThis behavior could be replicated accessing the remote computer using the credentials on that computer or as I'm saying using the Apple ID.\n\nA: No matter what folders are \"shared\" on your system, authenticating as a user on that particular system will enable you to access the user's home folder, the the system's root directory in the case that the user is an admin.\n", "Q: Is it possible to disable auto mount of external devices? How can I disable the auto mount of usb/firewire devices or basically any external disk in MacOSX?\nMy motivation for this is that in Windows there have been possible attacks via USB trojans that would copy to the internal hard drive just after the auto mount. I thought that disabling auto mount of external devices is a good counter measure. But I'm be open to solutions that protect from such a threat using other methods.\nEdit\nI assume that a solution to my problem would have to look like the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Auto mount disabled for all devices.\n\n*Opt-in of auto mount for my private devices.\n\n\nA: You should be able to use Disk Arbitrator to do most of what you want. Certainly requirement 1 is met and you should be able to achieve most of 2 with it too.\n\nA: As far as I know, such attacks rely on the auto-run feature, not the auto-mount feature, meaning that even manually mounting a disk will trigger the auto-run program.\nHowever, OS X doesn't support auto-run at all, so even if a volume auto-mounts and it does have a trojan on it, the trojan will not start automatically.\n\nA: This is how I disable auto mounting of APFS volumes on macOS Catalina.\nFor macOS volumes, both Macintosh HD - Data and Macintosh HD type volumes need to be referenced in /etc/fstab.\nFind volume(s) using diskutil list and set VOLUME_PATH accordingly.\n# Disable auto mounting of \"macOS - Data\" volume\nVOLUME_PATH=\"/Volumes/macOS - Data\"\nVOLUME_UUID=`diskutil info \"$VOLUME_PATH\" | awk '/Volume UUID:/ { print $3 }'`\ncat << EOF | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab\nUUID=$VOLUME_UUID none apfs rw,noauto\nEOF\n\n# Disable auto mounting of \"macOS\" volume\nVOLUME_PATH=\"/Volumes/macOS\"\nVOLUME_UUID=`diskutil info \"$VOLUME_PATH\" | awk '/Volume UUID:/ { print $3 }'`\ncat << EOF | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab\nUUID=$VOLUME_UUID none apfs rw,noauto\nEOF\n\nHere is what is going when running above commands:\nSet VOLUME_PATH variable to /Volumes/macOS - Data\nVOLUME_PATH=\"/Volumes/macOS - Data\"\n\nSet VOLUME_UUID variable to volume UUID of /Volumes/macOS - Data volume\nRunning diskutil info \"$VOLUME_PATH\" outputs volume details of /Volumes/macOS - Data (which includes its UUID).\nPiping (|) these details to awk '/Volume UUID:/ { print $3 }' extracts the UUID.\nVOLUME_UUID=`diskutil info \"$VOLUME_PATH\" | awk '/Volume UUID:/ { print $3 }'`\n\nAppend UUID=$VOLUME_UUID none apfs rw,noauto to /etc/fstab and output to console (see tee)\ncat << EOF | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab\nUUID=$VOLUME_UUID none apfs rw,noauto\nEOF\n\n", "Q: Can I view system stats in the Terminal?

Any problem with that?\n\n\nThanks\nEdit:\nIs a macbook 13' late 2008 aluminium unibody\n\nA: To answer your questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Per the MacBook specs, your MacBook shouldn't have a problem pushing video to a 1080p display, as the GPU can support up to 2560x1600 resolution.\n\n*You'll want to use the Moshi Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter if you want to use HDMI. Note: on your model this will do video only, not audio. This shouldn't make a difference on your display, but I thought you should know. Support for through Mini DisplayPort is added in the Mid 2010 models.\n\n*You can accomplish this by using clamshell mode.\n\n*As you'll read in the above clamshell mode support article, you actually have to use an external keyboard to get it to work in the first place, so you're good here. You can use a wired or wireless keyboard/mouse for this. \nHope this helps.

I have an Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S2) and an iPad (v1, wifi only, but I can use the tethering on my phone to get online). I'm a Wikipedia administrator, and there are a variety of public noticeboards for discussions of interest to administrators, like the administrators' noticeboard and the usually drama-filled administrators' noticeboard for incidents. I'd say there's probably about 10-20 pages I want. I'd rather like it if I could get either my iPad, wake up in the morning, push the \"update\" button, go brush my teeth and by the time I'm leaving for my commute, have all the pages up-to-date and readable on the train.\nAnswers you may suggest that are wrong up-front:\n\n\n*\n\n*Instapaper/Readability/Read It Later: those are for saving things broadly like newspaper articles for later reading.

In Mac OS X Lion (10.7.3), is it possible to create a new user account with settings identical to an existing user account?  Or put another way, is it possible to set-up a user account template?  I do not want to duplicate all of my documents, music, and photos.  Rather I would just like to create a new user account that has all / most of the settings and preferences that I have customized and tweaked over many months in my existing account.\nMy goal is to maintain two separate accounts:  one for personal use and one for work use.  My office shares files over Dropbox, and I'd like to sync all those on my Mac, but I'd rather not intermingle them with my personal documents.\nI've seen a few suggestions online that use Terminal to copy my existing account's home folder to a new directory with a different shortname.  But (1) that solution might be outdated, and (2) it seems like it might duplicate documents, music, and photos.\n\nA: I realise you are not looking to duplicate all of your files, but this method is quick and at the end you can just delete the files you don't want on the new account. To create a duplicate account based on the settings of your current account, try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Making a Time Machine backup of the current account. \n\nNo extra disk for backing up? Go to Disk Utility and create a partition on your current disk. Assuming you have space (I will, since you are looking to add an additional user account), you can add a partition to your startup disk without losing any data (you can also remove it or change the size after you are done). Make this new partition your Time Machine backup disk.\n\n\n*Launch the Migration Assistant utility (search for it in Spotlight).\n\n*In Migration Assistant, indicate that you want to import settings from a Time Machine backup.\n\n*In Migration Assistant, select to import the user account from the backup.\n\n*Because the name is the same as your current account, Migration Assistant will prompt you to rename the account. \n\n*Continue the migration and your new user account will be made–a duplicate of the current account except for the username. \n\n\nI'm doing this right now in Lion and it is working a treat. Good luck.  \n\nA: Mac OS X has a template for users, it's located in /System/Library/User Template/.lproj (in most cases,  will be English.) In that folder, there's the whole basic structure of a user directory.\nThese folders only can be read/written by root, so you have to access it in a root shell.\nIf you want to use the \"copy home directory method\", you could do this:\n1. Create a new user.\n2. Copy the sub-folders you need of your current ~/Library to the new one; especially you'll probably need to copy the folders Application Support (data from apps) and Preferences (app preference files), and delete unwanted stuff from it afterwards.\nHope I could help...\n\nA: You should be aware that the methods stated so far can cause trouble with the new user account if there is configuration that explicitly references the users home directory.\nFor instance, after cloning the a user with the 'Migration Assistant' from the Time Machine backup I ran into the Google updater executing in an infinite loop because it looked for a file in the initial users (\"xxx\") home directory:\n\nCould not find and/or execute program specified by service: 2: No such file or directory: /Users/xxx/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/Resources/GoogleSoftwareUpdateAgent.app/Contents/MacOS/GoogleSoftwareUpdateAgent\n\nI suspect there is no generic solution to this. This particular problem could be solved e.g. by executing\n> ~/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/GoogleSoftwareUpdate.bundle/Contents/Resources/GoogleSoftwareUpdateAgent.app/Contents/Resources/ksinstall --uninstall\n\nin the command line of the cloned user account, which uninstalls the updater (see also http://wireload.net/products/guu-google-update-uninstaller/ for older versions of the updater).\n\nA: Adding info to @Michael's post (this procedure still works in Yosemite):\nYou can also do this (without TimeMachine), with a Virtual Machine also running OS X, by using Migration Assistant on the HOST and in the VM and:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the VM indicate that you want to transfer settings FROM another Mac\n\n*On the Host indicate that you want to transfer settings TO another Mac \n\n*Copy the user account from the host to the VM\n\n*When finished:\n\n*Start Migration Assistant again\n\n*Copy the user back from the VM to the HOST, and select a new username\n\n", "Q: GUI C debugger for OSx Lion Does anyone know a good GUI C debugger for Lion, I looked into DDD since thats what I use in linux but i couldn't find a clear way to install it for Lion.\n\nA: To install ddd you can do it via installing the Macports package manager http://www.macports.org/\nAlso You can use the GUI implementation of gdb  in Apple's Xcode.

I recently bought a 15\" MacBook Pro (Late 2011) with 4GB of RAM. I want to upgrade to 8GB, but I've read that MacBooks can be kind of picky when it comes to RAM and will not operate right if it is given low quality RAM. So, barring RAM that you buy from Apple (Which is $400 for 8GB of RAM), what is the best RAM I can get for performance and price?\n\nA: Looks like thats the same RAM as in my 13\" Macbook Pro (Late 2011) 204-pin PC-10600 (1333 MHz) DDR3 SO-DIMM?

I know a lot about general problems with iOS and jailbreaking, so this isn't something simple..\nI jailbroke my iPhone 4S on the day that the untethered Absinthe jailbreak was released and everything has been working seamlessly for the past couple of weeks, more or less - a few apps wouldn't run, a few white/disappeared/appeared icons here and there, system apps appearing out of nowhere, but nothing that bothered me. But recently I've been having some severe glitches, as follows:\n1.) Anything Twitter-related results in a crash - tapping on Twitter in Settings crashes Settings, activating iOS Twitter via Activator crashes Springboard, opening the Twitter app crashes the app. This is the most annoying, as I use Twitter regularly.\n2.) Tapping the delete button on any App icon results in a catastrophic crash and Springboard relaunches in MobileSubstrate Safe Mode.\nIt's logical to think, from the timing, that this is likely caused by a recently-installed tweak, but I don't understand how both things still happen even when in MobileSubstrate SafeMode! Either of these glitches causes the iPhone to restart in SafeMode, which is understandable. But what's even more bizarre is that if I provoke one of these glitches in SafeMode, it resprings in jailbroken mode! What is up with that?!\nHas this been happening to anyone else? More importantly, has anyone found a fix? I don't want this to result in the \"start from scratch\" answer that people are always so eager to dish out unless absolutely necessary. I mean, I have no problem with re-jailbreaking and re-installing the all tweaks, but I have a 64GB iPhone 4S.. Resyncing all that data is going to take a LONG time, and I really don't want to do that unless I HAVE to.\nUpdate:\nI reset to factory settings, restored from a backup, reinstalled Twitter and it's STILL happening, even though it's not even jailbroken anymore! Help Q.Q\n\nA: I'm inclined to think something has corrupted your preference files or application data, as those will be brought back after a restore from backup. \nIn order to test this theory, you will need to wipe the phone by putting it in DFU mode, then restoring to the latest Apple firmware through iTunes. Then set up your device as a new device. If the problems still occur (unlikely), then I would take it in to an Apple Store and have a Genius look at it.\nIf, however, it fixes the issue, then you will have to play \"hunt and go seek\" with the culprit. Restore your backup, jailbreak (but don't install anything from Cydia except OpenSSH so you can access the file system), and root through your \"home\" folder (/private/var/mobile).\nYou should try deleting the preferences (plists) first (~/Library/Preferences), then rebooting. Don't worry, iOS will recreate them. If that doesn't fix it, try removing the sqlite database in ~/Library/Twitter, although I have a feeling the preference files should take care of it.\nI wish I had an easy answer for you, but it's going to take some study of the file system and tracing back to the package that \"infected\" your system.\nNot everything in Cydia is deemed safe and you may wish to exercise more caution in the future. MobileSubstrate (which is only made possible be reverse engineering) provides the hooks for many deep level APIs that shouldn't be messed with.\nAdditionally, you may want to hit up jailbreakqa for additional help, as that is the official forum for help on these matters. From my experience, there isn't much help here regarding this process.\n", "Q: Is that possible to change PPTP VPN password on mac? Could I directly reset my password for VPN on mac?\nFor Windows, I found the instruction below \n(source from ehow, not tested as I only has a mac):\n\n\n*\n\n*Log on to your VPN.\n\n*Enter the \"CTRL+ALT+DEL\" keys simultaneously and select the\n\"Change a Password\" menu option.\n\n*Enter a new password. Then depress the \"CTRL+ALT+DEL\" keys\nsimultaneously and select the \"Lock the Computer\" menu option.\nImmediately unlock your computer. This action will update your\ncached VPN login information and your VPN password will be updated.\n\n\nCan I do this on mac too? Thanks.\n\nA: No.\nTo my knowledge, the native VPN client on Mac OS X does not have functionality for changing your password. There is some code in directory authentication that can do this, but in order to change a password used for VPN, you'll likely have to log into a web-based password utility that's bound to the directory the VPN is authenticating to.\nAdditionally, those ehow instructions are quite vague. It looks a little like the system is authenticating to a VPN at login, much like how OS X can authenticate to a directory service at login. Perhaps it is possible to connect to a VPN prior to login on Windows? On Mac, on the native client, this is not possible: VPN sessions happen AFTER a user has logged in.\nNow, if your VPN is authenticating to a Directory Service used for login, it may be possible to change this password inside loginwindow (as changing your account password).\n\nA: For a 2019 Mac, try Fn + Ctrl + Option + Delete.\nI know this is 8 years too late, but leaving this here for any future seekers.\n", "Q: Safari freezes on pinch-to-zoom in Lion I have noticed this since upgrading to Lion. \nMany times I accidentally use the pinch to zoom feature on the trackpad for Safari. Safari will zoom in a bit, but then the entire tab becomes frozen. No buttons or hyperlinks work, if you enter a new address into the address bar it will load, but it won't show up, etc. The only solution is to close Safari and reopen it.\nOthers have reported similar problems here\nhttp://forum.notebookreview.com/apple-mac-os-x/634076-safari-causes-pinch-zoom-freeze.html\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3196200?start=0&tstart=0\nI have no extensions installed.\n\nA: Not sure I like it, but I think it's by design.  I don't really use the zoom function, but occassionaly activate it by accident when srolling.  When you zoon in, it seems to remove all navigation functions other than scrolling or further zoom operations.  You need to zoom back out in order to get it all back, however due to either inertia or some other feature it's possible for you to sort of bounce in again and zoom in a small amount again, making it seem unresponsive.  It's very subtle, especially as the text will render beatutifully.  So, in short, zoom out, check that you have really actually zoomed out all the way, then try again.\n\nA: I have the same issue on my machine. I have 10.7.3 installed. I've found that if it freezes on you, you can pinch to zoom out and Safari will go back to normal. It should allow you to zoom in normally after this too. I'd be interested to know if anyone else has an actual fix for it rather than a band-aid. \n\nA: I'm annoyed by this Safari bug all the time, thanks for pointing out pinch zoom, never considered that.\nAfaik, there is no support for pinch zoom in Safari, certainly pinch zoom has never worked in Safari v5.1.3 or earlier on Lion.  I therefore suspect that pinch zoom has activated despite not being correctly supported in Safari.\nIf so, you might fix this Safari bug by disabling pinch zoom completely in System Preferences.  I'll try this myself and report back.\nI've found that pinch zoom works well enough in Preview, but I'll happily sacrifice that functionality to fix Safari. \nI have never managed to fix this by unzooming as Matt Love suggests, certainly the command and + or - keys don't fix it, nor does double tapping, nor does pinching or unpinching.\nUpdate :  It appears disabling pinch zoom fixes this problem.  As I said, Safari apparently never support pinch-zoom anyways, but this disables pinch-zoom in preview.  Anyone know if pinch-zoom can be disabled for specific applications?\n", "Q: Change EXIF meta-data of multiple images in single click I ran into big problem yesterday night.\nI took out my old digital camera, and started using it without setting current date and time.\nAll photos clicked now have date as Jan 01, 2009\nI want to change the date and time (and other EXIF image meta-data) of multiple images.\nPlease recommend some software which can process on multiple images in single click/go.\n\nA: ExifTool is the one to go for.\nIt has a time shift feature that allows you to shift the dates.\n\n\nDate/Time Shift Feature \n\nHave you ever forgotten to set the date/time on your digital camera\n  before taking a bunch of pictures? ExifTool has a time shift feature\n  that makes it easy to apply a batch fix to the timestamps of the\n  images (ie. change the \"Date Picture Taken\" reported by Windows\n  Explorer). Say for example that your camera clock was reset to\n  2000:01:01 00:00:00 when you put in a new battery at\n  2005:11:03 10:48:00. Then all of the pictures you took subsequently\n  have timestamps that are wrong by 5 years, 10 months, 2 days, 10 hours\n  and 48 minutes. To fix this, put all of the images in the same\n  directory (\"DIR\") and run exiftool:\nexiftool \"-DateTimeOriginal+=5:10:2 10:48:0\" DIR\nThe example above changes only the DateTimeOriginal tag, but any\n  writable date or time tag can be shifted, and multiple tags may be\n  written with a single command line. Commonly, in JPEG images, the\n  DateTimeOriginal, CreateDate and ModifyDate values must all be\n  changed. For convenience, a shortcut tag called AllDates has been\n  defined to represent these three tags. So, for example, if you forgot\n  to set your camera clock back 1 hour at the end of daylight savings\n  time in the fall, you can fix the images with:\nexiftool -AllDates-=1 DIR\nSee Image::ExifTool::Shift.pl (download in PDF format) for\n  details about the syntax of the time shift string.\n\nSome things to note:\nTest on a small batch of copies first until you get the date syntax you want.\nI suggest you copy or move your images to a new folder first.\nAnd run the command on that directory.\nIf you run exiftool on a directory it will look in sub directories and modify any image files it finds.\nExiftool WILL automatically append '_original' on the end of your original files and create a new copy for you with the modifications.\nYou can override this by using the '-overwrite_original' option.\nexiftool  -overwrite_original -AllDates+=\"0:2:1 10:48:0\" /Users/UserName/Desktop/testFolder\n\nThis example shifts forward   0 years, 2 months, 1 day,  10 hours, 48 minutes, 0 seconds.\nUsing a single set of time shifts i.e instead of \"0:2:1 10:48:0\" you use \"10:48:0\". Exiftool will see this as hh:mm:ss.\nAnd you can omit 0 where you do not want to put a shift.\nexiftool  -overwrite_original AllDates+=\"9::\" /Users/UserName/Desktop/testFolder\n\nThis example shifts forward 9 hours.\n   exiftool  -overwrite_original -AllDates-=\"9::\" /Users/UserName/Desktop/testFolder\n\nThis example shifts back 9 hours.\nNotice AllDates-=\"  and AllDates+=\"  , one has a plus one has a minus.\nAlso Remember you are shifting time not stamping a time stamp.\nSo if my original date was :\n2011:07:21 01:41:29\nand I used exiftool  -overwrite_original -AllDates-=\"24::\" /Users/UserName/Desktop/testFolder\nThen I would get : 2011:07:20 01:41:29\nDo download the PDF with the syntax\nAnd make sure you look at the difference with the options -overwrite_original_in_place  and -overwrite_original\nDocumentation \n\nA: iPhoto and Aperture can do this too.\nOn iPhoto, select the images. Go Photos -> Adjust Date and Time and make the calculation you need to correct the date. tick the box to adjust the Original files and click ok\n\nA: OS X Photos app has this functionality built in, under Image -› Adjust Date and Time.\nIt opens a dialog showing current time stamp and prompting for corrected one.\nIf multiple images were selected, date and time of the first photo is shown; the adjustment is used to calculate time shift to apply to all selected photos.\n\nA: I haven't tried any of the other answers, but GraphicConverter is a great program for batch processing images (as well as good standalone image editing software) and can edit metadata as well. GraphicConverter is available through the developer's web site or the Mac App Store.\n\nA: my best pick for you would be Xnview with its \"change timestamp\" option under \"tools\" menu.\nIts robust and let you change all five (3x Exif and 2 file) date/time attributes belonging to a single photo.\nThis tool works in batch mode with adjusting days, hours, minutes, seconds and picking the correct date/time of specific photo.\nYou can see which date/time attribute will be applied and you can choose which of those five date/time attributes will be affected\n\nA: I used EXIF Pilot with Batch Edit Plugin when I had this issue.

Without you get something to cover the whole rear panel your sticker be as obvious as the logo it's trying to replace, and will probably look a lot worse as there will be some light bleeding through the vinyl unless it's a serious thick sticker, which will then catch on things and have edge-peel issues etc.\nSearch on Amazon for Macbook and Gelaskins for an idea for covering the whole rear, this is an example:\n\nIf you want something smaller, you can use something to take the edge off it by highlighting it in a way that marginally masks it:\n\n", "Q: How can I disable pop-unders when using Chrome? I know it's possible to disable pop-ups, and that's the default behavior, but It's not affecting the pop-unders.\n\nA: Yes,\nbut you need to block all scripts on a domain using Chrome's own script blocking feature.\n\nWhy?\nPop-unders are usually via JavaScript. In order to disable them, I block javascript on the specific site using the extension ScriptNo  Chrome's build-in script blocking in:\nSettings →  Show advanced settings → Content settings → JavaScript → JavaScript Exceptions\nAt the moment Chrome's API do not allow proper script blocking which is also why Firefox' NoScript developer has not yet ported his extension. Third-party extensions like ScriptNo suffer from the same problem.\nThe lack of needed API can allow scripts to still load the first time you visit a website.\nBy design there is no option for extensions to effectively block scripts like in Firefox, therefore the only way to stop this behavior is to block all scripts on a domain using Chrome's settings which I mentioned at the top.\n\nA: Chrome allows you to set preferences for EACH specific site.\nClick on the icon in the browser. \nOpens a window allowing to set Java and so on specific to that site.\nNow to the pop-unders.\nI personally use the Chrommes Poper Blocker extension.\nIt works for me, but then I have not visited your websites.\nPoper Blocker 1.69 \nBlocks all these annoying popups and popunders that pop no matter!\nIf interested, get it here:\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/poper-blocker/bkkbcggnhapdmkeljlodobbkopceiche\n\nA: I have tried lot of different options, addons, scripts, but sorry to disappoint you mate, none of them works perfectly.

I know about the other third-party options out there, this is more to do with the native stuff that comes bundled from Apple.  For years Snow Leopard has had notoriously bad NTFS read-write support hence it was disabled by default.  We could enable it like this, but it was dangerous at best.  So, has this improved in Lion, or is this still a neglected dangerous feature?\n\nA: I haven't seen any credible reports that NTFS write support has improved with Lion.

I'm looking for one of those ⌥+? shortcuts to type a minus sign (−) from the keyboard, without touching the mouse.\nI'm looking for the minus sign (−). It should have the same width as a plus sign (+), and its Unicode code point is 8722 (x2212 in hexadecimal).\nWhat I'm not looking for:\n\n\n*\n\n*The hyphen minus (-), already on the keyboard, is not the typographically correct symbol for subtraction.\n\n*The em dash (—, ⇧+⌥+-) is used to signify a break in thought and is far too wide to be confused for a minus sign.\n\n*The en dash (–, ⌥+-) is used for ranges of values or relationships and connections and shouldn't be used in place of a minus sign.\n\n\nA: If you need to do this a lot, you might get ukelele and use it to create your own keyboard layout. That's what I did, and now I can type all kinds of mathematical symbols with ease, such as lots of integral signs (∫, ∬, ∭, ∮), ∅, ∇, ∀, ∃, ∑, ∏, ⊂, ⊆, ⊃, ⊇, not to mention arrows: →, ←, ↔, ↓, ↑ and so on. (However, you probably don't want my keyboard layout, as it is based on the Norwegian keyboard.) I admit it took me a while to put it together, but I feel it was worth the effort. Your mileage may vary, however.\n\nA: Here's a really fast way to insert a minus sign (or any other sign for that matter).\nUse Emoji & Symbols\nYou can get to Emoji & Symbols by going to the Edit Menu on the Top Menu Bar on your screen\n\nBut, the easier way is to invoke the keyboard shortcut by typing  ^ Control⌘ CommandSpace\nYou will then be presented with the Emoji & Symbols search box; just type \"minus\" and you will be presented with all the options for \"minus signs\"\n\n\nA: I found a new, better solution, but it's also not free. You can use the popular Mac productivity utility Alfred with a workflow extension to search for and copy any unicode character.\nIt's the fastest solution I've found to find and insert any unicode character out there. You simply press a keyboard command to launch the Alfred prompt, type in keyword and search term, use the up/down arrows to highlight the result you want, and then press Enter to copy it to the clipboard. Here's what it looks like:\n\nInstallation\nHere are the steps to get this set up:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, install Alfred from alfredapp.com.\n\n*Next, to enable workflows, you'll have to buy the Alfred Powerpack upgrade. (If all you want is to look up Unicode characters, buying the Powerpack probably isn't worth the cost. But it does come with lots of helpful enhancements.)\n\n*Then go to the unicode-symbols-search repo on Github and download the ZIP.\n\n*Open the ZIP and the contained folder to find a file named Symbols Search.alfredworkflow. Open that file and Alfred should take over and install it.\n\n\nOptional stuff\nI make two customizations: I change the keyword for this workflow and I turn off automatic pasting.\nThe default keyword is uss, which means nothing to me. I change it to char.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, press the keyboard shortcut to show the Alfred prompt and then press Cmd , to open preferences.\n\n*Navigate to the Workflows section and you should see Symbols Search. Double-click the left box labeled Script Filter to open its configuration.\n\n*Change the keyword to char (or whatever else you want).\n\n\n\nI also don't like that the default is to immediately paste the character when you press Enter. To turn that off:\n\n\n*\n\n*As above, go to Alfred Preferences > Workflows > Symbols Search.\n\n*Double-click the right box labeled Copy to Clipboard to open its configuration.\n\n*Uncheck the checkbox labeled Automatically paste to from most app.\n\n\n\nUse it\nNow let's actually use it!\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the keyboard shortcut to show the Alfred prompt. (Alfred Preferences > General)\n\n*Type char minus. (Or replace char whatever keyword you chose for Symbols Search workflow.)\n\n*Press the down arrow until minus sign is highlighted.\n\n*Press Enter to copy to the clipboard.\n\n*Go back to whatever app you want to paste the minus sign into and do it.\n\n*Declare victory.\n\n\nThe first time you do this isn't fast. Every other time is.\n\nA: There's a way of entering Unicode values on the Mac: go to System Preferences, then Language & Text. In the Input Sources tab, scroll to Unicode Hex Input, check it.\n\nThen if you switch to Unicode Hex Input in the Mac menu bar, you can press\n⌥+2212 for the minus sign. Here's what the input switcher looks like:\n\nIf you want to switch between your input and hex input via keyboard, you have to click \"Keyboard Shortcuts...\" in the same window, disable \"Show Spotlight Window\" in the Spotlight section, and maybe activate \"Select next source in Input Menu\". ⌥+⌘+space will then swap input language. (You can check this in the menu bar.)\n(Alternatively, there's the low-mouse-use option via Special Characters:\nGo to Edit > Special Characters...;  in there, select the Unicode tab, and Code tables (or however it's called in English) at the top.\nNext, scroll down the list until you see 00002200 in the Unicode column. Click it. Down below, look for the row that begins with 2210, and it should be the 3rd char.)\n\nA: One option would be to create ~/Library/KeyBindings/ and save an old-style property list like this as DefaultKeyBinding.dict:\n{\n    \"~M\" = (insertText:, \"−\"); // opt-shift-m\n}\n\n\nA: It's not free, and you have to use the mouse briefly, but the fastest way to do this is with an app named Characters from the Mac App Store for $2.99. You click the icon in the Mac menu bar, search for a character, and use the arrows and Enter to copy it to the clipboard.\n\n\nA: In word, you can create a new shortcut:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click Insert --> Symbol --> Advanced Symbol. That will open the Symbol browser.\n\n*In the lower left side, click the \"Autocorrect\" button, which will open the autocorrect window.\n\n*Under \"Math Autocorrect\" tab, activate \"Use Math AutoCorrect rules outside of math regions\"\n\n*In the \"Replace\" box, type the code you want to use. (I have it set to \"-\")\n\n*In the \"With\" box, enter the \"minus\" symbol. I had to \"cut-and-paste\" it from a text document.\n\n*Click OK.\n\n\nDone. Next time you type - it will be replaced by the minus sign.\nHope it helps!\n\nA: You can set up just a regular autocorrect shortcut for this as well, which I found much simpler. \nFirst, insert a proper minus sign into a Word document somewhere using the \"Insert symbol\" function. Highlight that minus sign.\nGo to \"Tools\" --> \"Autocorrect\". The proper minus sign you have highlighted will show up in the \"replace with\" field on the right; all you have to do now is type whatever shortcut you want to use on the left. I like to use letter combinations that won't show up in other contexts, but are somehow reminiscent of what I actually want to type; I chose \"mnsgn\" in this case. \nClick \"add\" and then \"OK\". Now, whenever you type whatever your shortcut is, it will be autocorrected to a minus sign.\n\nA: I don't know shortcut for actual minus sign in macOS. However, you can insert one using-\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences --> Keyboard \nand (make sure you are on tab 'keyboard') check mark option of \"Show Keyboard, Emoji, and Symbol viewers in menu bar\"\nthis will put an icon on your mac menu bar right side.\n\n*Click on that icon, will open a menu.\n\n*Choose \"Show Emoji & Symbols\". It will open a dialog box.\n\n*Choose \"Math Symbols\". You can insert the minus sign from here as shown below.\nHope that helps!\n\nA: On my Mac, running OS X El Capitan, I can get a minus sign by invoking the special characters table: control+command+space. I use minus signs pretty often, so it's listed there as frequently used. Just click it or press enter if it's already highlighted, and in it goes. \nIf you need to enter several minus signs in a text, you can copy it to the clipboard and then paste it back freely until you need the clipboard for something else. \n", "Q: How can I create a photo slide show of one face from iPhoto's faces? I really like the view in the Faces section of iPhoto when you are identifying possible matches.  You get the closeup of just the picture and you can see all of the ways the person has changed over the years (assumine you are actually looking at a match).\nI would like to automate the process of generating a slideshow that shows only the person's face.  Does anyone know of how it might get done in iPhoto or with a third-party product that could leverage iPhoto's faces data?\n\nA: First: You can't do it with iPhoto, it's just not a feature.\nNext: Those faces thumbnails are stored inside the iPhoto Library package - in the Data folder on some versions, the Thumbnails folder on later ones.\nIf you make an alias to that folder you could possibly access them that way using another app. However, they are scattered hither and yon throughout the folder, in multiple subfolders and may well be difficult to find. That said they include they all include _face0 in the filename so a Smart Folder will help find them\nBut... However, these are very small (200 - 300 pixel on the longest side) images and it's unlikely that they will perform well in a slideshow.\n\nA: I haven't used iPhoto in a long time, since I'm using Aperture now; but there, you can just open a person's pictures, and just start a slideshow.\nSince Aperture (and I think iPhoto too) always uses the currently shown set of photos for a slideshow, these pictures will be shown in the slideshow.\nAlternatively, you can create a smart album with one condition: Face is [person's name]; you can then make slideshow of it.\n", "Q: Changes in /etc/hosts are undone I have a computer on my local network for which I would like to use a nice alias, and therefore I put an entry in /etc/hosts.

I use Bootcamp to install windows 7 on separate partition (200 GB for OSX & 50 GB  for Windows) Now I decide to delete my windows and want my 50 GB  partition back and stick to the 200 GB partition, How can I do this?\n\nA: Using the tool Disk Utility, select your hard disk, then select the \"partition\" tab that appears on the right.  This will allow you to list the partitions on your drive.  If you used a standard bootcamp install, you will probably find that the windows partition appears after the end of the Mac one, and is at the end of the disk.\nSelecting this partition, and hitting the minus button should remove it, and will leave a blank hole in it's space.  Now you should be able to select the first partition, and increase it's size in order to fill the available space vacated by the windows partition.\nTop tip: Backup your Mac partition!  Use Time Machine, Super Duper, Carbon Copy Cloner of similar tools.  This should be perfectly achievable without even a reboot, but you are mucking around with your disks partition table, risks do exist, there is always a chance of failure ruining both partitions.  I wouldn't worry it about it too much, but if your data is important, you should do this first.\n", "Q: Remotely SSH to IP address in home network I've got a device at home I want to SSH to from work. The device has port 22 open locally and I have port 22 opened on my AirPort Extreme. However, on the AirPort Extreme it says the open 22 port only goes to my main server IP (10.0.1.100). \nThe IP I need to access is 10.0.1.104. Again, the device at 10.0.1.104 has port 22 open on it, as I am able to SSH to it on the local network. I can also SSH to 10.0.1.100 with no issues.\nWhen I try to add an additional port forwarding entry, AirPort Utility says there is already a port forward listed for 22 since it's already open, but is pointing to 10.0.1.104.\nI feel like there is a way to specify the IP in the SSH syntax, but I'm not sure what it is.\nThanks.\n\nA: One way to do what you want here is to add a port mapping in your Airport Extreme that points a non-standard remote port (e.g. 8022) to port 22 on your local 10.0.1.104 machine. Then, you can specify a different port in your SSH client (e.g. '-p 8022') to gain remote access.\nYou could also SSH into 10.0.1.100 first, and then SSH into 10.0.1.104 from that machine.\n\nA: If connecting from another Mac, the easiest way would be setting up Back to My Mac. All you need is a working iCloud account with Back to My Mac enabled in the iCloud preference pane. There is no need to configure any port forwarding with this set-up, and you can still connect to the default port 22.\nOnce you set it up on both Macs, in Terminal.app you can go to Shell - New Remote Connection, select Secure Shell (ssh), and your Mac at home should be listed there. You can also take note of the host name to use to launch a connection from the shell.\nIt is often overlooked Back to My Mac works with all the different services you can enable in the Sharing prefpane, and not just for accessing your files over a fileshare.\n\nA: Is there any reason you cannot configure your Airport Extreme as a bridge?\nIf you really need routing from your Airport Extreme, then of course this won't work. But unless you're using its built-in modem or WAN port to connect to the Internet, I'd suggest just using it as a bridge. Then everything \"Just Works,\" and there's no port-mapping making things difficult.\n\nA: From my experience, I'd use IPV6 instead of IPV4 if your ISP permit.\nUsing IPV6 you can address each machine on your local network because part of the IPV6 is the MAC address of the machine.\n", "Q: Why can't you create/open multiple instances of iTunes? In terminal, the open -n ~/Applications/iTunes doesn't create a new instance of iTunes, just switches to the one already open.  Why?\n\nA: iTunes uses a database file to maintain a track of all the meta data on the contents of the iTunes library.  Opening multiple instances of iTunes would potentially result in the 2nd instance being unable to gain the correct access to these files as they would be locked by the first instance.\nOK, you can have multiple iTunes libraries (hold Option when starting to choose or create a new one), but this is a relatively edge case scenario, and even for users of this functionality, I cannot see many instances where it would be useful to have more than one open simultaneously.  Playing 2 files at once would sound awful, and if you want to copy from one to another, you can still gain access to the files directly through the finder.\n", "Q: Is there a Safari plugin to remove mackeeper ads?

I think it started with the iMac that came out in the late 90's, but still have always wondered where the \"i\" came from in terms of the product.  Thanks.\n\nA: How about How did Apple choose the 'i' naming convention?\n\nWe returned with five names, one of which we all loved: iMac. Each option came with a presentation board briefly describing why it was a good name. For iMac, it was obviously all about the i. Most important, it stood for Internet. But it also stood for other valuable i things, like individual, imagination, i as in me, etc. It also did a pretty good job of laying a solid foundation for future product naming. The “i” naming nomenclature became so pervasive Steve became the iCEO for a number of years. There was even a Time magazine story that cemented this title.\n\n\nA: According to Wikipedia, Apple declared the 'i' in iMac to stand for \"Internet\"; it also represented the product's focus as a personal device ('i' for \"individual\").  \nThe following is interesting to see the order, which is effectively iMac, iPod, iLife, iSight, iWork, iPhone, iPad (Where's the iBook?, iTunes?)\n\n", "Q: Why are some iTunes Store songs marked as CLEAN when no EXPLICIT version exists? I have downloaded a number of items from the iTunes store which are marked as CLEAN.  I understand this is common in tracks (I'm looking at you, rappers!) where an EXPLICIT song has has the swear words removed or bleeped or reversed etc.  However, the tracks I have are the original recordings, and are not clean versions of tracks that were originally explicit:\n\nWhat makes iTunes decide to add these flags to certain songs, and what is the point of a CLEAN tag?\nIn the example given every track is marked as clean, but I have seen it on individual songs also.\n\nA: I just had a look at differently tagged files.\nThe responsible ID3-tag is rtng (short for rating). If set to 1 the song will be marked as EXPLICIT, while 2 shows up as CLEAN. Every other value leads to no label.\nI recommend Kid3 as a tag editor.\nEDIT:\nAccording to this and this, the values should be 2 (CLEAN) and 4 (EXPLICIT). I can't reproduce those, maybe someone copied it wrong...\n\nA: This is a hypothesis, but I expect it's because those songs have been explicitly (no pun intended) listened to by iTunes staff to make sure there aren't swears or R references. Another possibility is that artists, when submitting content to the Store, have the ability to flag them this way, and often do so even when no explicit version exists.\n", "Q: Make a file a Stationery pad via command line Is there a way to set make a file into a Stationery pad from the command line? \nYou can do it by clicking \"Get info\" on a file and checking the box, but I would like to do it without clicking.\n\nAn AppleScript solution would be useful also, but GUI scripting is off limits.\n\nA: The SetFile utility is provided with Xcode, which Apple distributes at no cost.

If your answer includes a link please link to manufacturers' sites, not to sales sites, which change more frequently.\n\nA: There's always the various Mac mini stackable USB hubs - those usually look pretty nice.\nIf you can't find a hub you like the looks of, you could always hide it:\n\n\n*\n\n*A shelf that goes on the monitor stand to hide items behind the monitor\n\n*Or you could just tape (or velcro, thanks to @jaberg) the hub to the back of the monitor to keep it out of sight.\n\n", "Q: App suggestion for low-friction way to log regular text entries? I would like to keep a log of what I have been doing every hour during my work day.\nI would like something (say, an app or menu-bar utility) that will pop-up every hour and ask me what I have been doing, allowing me to enter a few lines of text.\nThe fact that it would automatically pop up, and that it only expects me to fill in one text field would mean that it is a very low-friction way of entering information.\nIt would, of course, then have some way to let me view what has been logged post-facto.\nCan you recommend anything that will let me do this?\n\nA: Whilst not being the intended purpose, the app \"Day One\" which is available on iOS and Mac OS is a journal/diary program that is focussed on hassle free text entry.  It will sit in the menu bar on Mac OS X, and you can configure reminders for how often you would like to enter something.  Th eexpection is more along the lines of twice a day etc, but you can tell it as many times as you want/need.\nWhen the reminder is due, it will produce a small popup box under the menu bar icon that allows you to type a few words in (Markdown supported, but no fancy formatting toolbars etc) and then save them, you can postpone or ignore entries if you like.\n\nIt will collate all your entries together, sync them between other instances inc. the iOS app via Dropbox or iCloud, and you are then able to  search for entries specifically, or list by day/month/year all in a timeline style like a diary.  It won't do fancy stuff, like applying time or entries to specific codes etc, or produce reports and so on, but if you just need manuall adhoc review of contents it's a good fit.\n\nA: I would check out TSheets time tracking software. I have my account set up to shoot me reminders and alerts so I'm assuming you can do the same for an hourly pop-up reminder. And there is a place to insert notes. Good luck!\n\nA: Take a look at TimeXchange.net. The timer feature would be useful to you.\n", "Q: Best way to copy all files, ignoring errors? I have a partially corrupted HD that can not be repaired by Disk Utility, but which can be mounted read-only making the data on it accessible.\nI am trying to copy all the recoverable contents onto a spare HD, but every method I try fails when an error is encountered - leaving the remaining files un-copied.\n\n*\n\n*Finder - Fails\n\n*SuperDuper - Fails\n\n*Ditto (terminal command) - Fails\n\nI was hoping that Ditto would do the trick, the Ditto man page says:\n\nditto returns 0 if everything is copied, otherwise non-zero.  ditto\nalmost never gives up, preferring to report errors along the way.\nDiagnostic messages will be printed to standard error.\n\nI have submitted a bug to Apple re ditto failing to perform as advertised.\nAny other ideas?\n\nA: This Macworld hint suggests using dd to make a bit-by-bit copy (ignoring errors) then mounting the resultant image in Finder to recover your files.

You can get it for OS X if you're using Homebrew by typing in an Terminal window:\nbrew install ddrescue\n\nA guide on arstechnica describes how to rescue a failed disk using ddrescue. Make sure you read through the guide, as it contains helpful information. Here is a gist on how to get there.\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate the drive using diskutil list.

(I think the dd command would be preferable if you can do that).\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select 'backup all files' as the backup strategy\n\n*In options select 'smart update' (otherwise this process will take a ridiculously long time if you have more than one or two errors, you'll need the paid version for this)\n\n*Run the copy\n\n*When the copy fails read the logs to find which file failed to copy, then hit ok/close to get back to the 'start' screen\n\n*Select 'edit selected copy script' from the using dropdown\n\n*Under Script commands add the file which failed to copy, it should say 'ignore' once it's added to the list of files\n\n*Save your script with some name (e.g. ignore-corrupted-files)\n\n*Select your script and repeat steps 3-7 as many times as necessary to ignore all corrupted files.\n\n\nA: If your drive is still accessible, and you can see the files hirrarchy, but just the copy process stop because of errors, you can use the Unstoppable Copier (windows only) program.\nhttp://www.roadkil.net/program.php?ProgramID=29\n\nA: The ditto command should work, I would use ditto in conjunction with the -v option for verbose so you can see exactly what gives you an error of what it copies.\n", "Q: iPhone 4S does not get detected in Windows When I connect my iPhone 4S to my computer, iTunes does not detect it. iPhone pops the message of USB connectivity and defaults to Mass Storage.

Like BeTwin. For example, I have Macbook Pro with one Mini DisplayPort (for additional monitor) and two USB port (for additional mouse and keyboard).\nHow can i implement it on Mac OS Snow Leopard?\n\nA: Not aware of anything quite like BeTwin, but you may not be aware that is is possible to run 2 user accounts simultaeniously out of the box without the need for any extra software, at least in Lion (And I have seen, but cannot find, that this can be retroconfigured on SL).  You mention SLin your question, but have also tagged, Lion, so I will reply anyway.\nWhen you use screen sharing, you are able to choose which display to connect to, either the physical or the virtual display.  Connecting to the physical display will allow you to take over the screen of the target computer, taking control of the kb/mouse etc.  But if you use the virtual display, you are able to log in as a new user, and run processes entirely independently of the peron who is physically logged onto the machine.\nWhilst I have only tested this with a a Mac initiating the screen sharing, there is no reason why with an up to date VNC client any old netbook, or thin client etc shouldn't be able to connect in this way, as the Screen Sharing technology is only VNC under the hood.\nEdit: Read this for more information on getting this working using Snow Leopard\n", "Q: How to group images in iWork Pages?

I've only recently become a Mac user so it might be a newbie question but, how do I get to it?\nMacBook Pro, OS X 10.7 Lion\n\nA: The package contains some files to be installed somewhere in the file system, not necessarily in ~/Library/Application Support\nA simple way to find out where files installed by the package will go in the file system is to use the suspicious package QuickLook plugin. Note that install script in the package might still alter the filesystem in other ways.\n\nA: Mac OS X will only create this /Users/~/Library/Application Support/app directory when you open the application for the first time. Even then, not all apps require an Application Support directory as some are self contained. \nWhat application are you attempting to run?\n", "Q: How can you limit your use of time-wasting apps on iOS? How can I limit my use of some time-wasting apps on my iPhone for a few days? Temporarily removing the apps so that I would have to first go through a reinstall to use them is not an option because I don't want to lose their data. There are some Mac applications to limit access to websites and other applications: Obtract and SelfControl for example. Is there anything similar for iOS?\n\nA: No, there is nothing like that.  Your choices are simple and stark:\n1: Willpower \n2: Backup your iPhone and remove them from the sync list, this way yopu will not lose your data.  Reinstalling the App direct from App Store will not bring your data back, meaning you need to be at your computer to sync properly in order to get your data too, which may be handy if it's at home and you are at work/school etc.\nIn order to make option 1 a little more palatable, you can try any number of tricks.  For example, if the apps you want to a void are strewn all over the place, try to put them on teh last page, and simply ban yourself from visiting the last homescreen.   This may assist in not tempting you when the app you need to use is right next to the game you shouldn't be playing.  Also, you could invent some reward system to give you some motivation to not use them.  If you don't use the timewasting apps homescreen all day, you get to treat yourself to an in-app purchase, or a half hour uninteruppted game slot once your works done etc.  Whatever works for you.\nUpdate:  Loïc Wolff reminded me of a question I answered before that has a similar answer.  In summary: \"Anything you can do or install or configure in order to produce a technical block to stop you running these apps, can also be undone\", so the only real answer is to work on yourself.\n\nA: There's no native way to disable an app. \nMaybe by jailbreaking, there's an app called Poof that can hide the app icon. It's still there, you can find it through Spotlight but you won't see it.\nIf you don't want to jailbreak, just put them in a folder on the last screen called \"Close me, you're just bored\". And just let guilt do its part.\n", "Q: How do I tighten the screen hinge on my Macbook Pro (2010)? I have a 2010 MBP and the screen has started to wobble - not un-usably, but just enough that when it is sitting on its stand the screen bobbles around a little when I type. \nI took it back to a Genius at the Apple store and he said this was expected behaviour, and because it held its position, they weren't able to do anything about it. With that said, he was in a massive rush and running waaay behind - and I wanted to get a second opinion. \nShould it sit still / can I ask them (within the 3-y Applecare I bought) to tighten it? Or is there anything I can do? \n\nA: Try calling Apple Care, and or taking your MacBook Pro to a  Apple Authorized Service Provider, they may offer a much higher level of services satisfaction than a \"really busy\" Apple Retail Store in my experiences (East Cost, USA).\n", "Q: Unchecking \"Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps\" doesn't work Unchecking \"Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps\" under\nSystem Preferences -> General doesn't work - for example, when I re-open an app (e.g. Preview) it restores a window (call it 'PDF 1') I had open before quitting that app. (At least when I quit it by logging out, even with 'Reopen windows when logging back in' unchecked.) Any pointers?\nI've found people describing similar problems, around the web and on StackExchange (in answers/comments, but not dedicated questions). But no answers that work for me. I've tried the solutions suggested at Disable resume for all apps in Daniel's answer (after which ~/Library/Saved Application State/ has stayed empty) and joelseph's comment on his answer.\n\nA: The following Terminal command (found it here) will disable Resume for applications that ignore the \"Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps\" settings (for Preview in this example):\ndefaults write com.apple.Preview ApplePersistenceIgnoreState -bool yes\nSwap 'Preview' in the above command with 'TextEdit', 'Safari', 'Xcode' etc.\nAlso, check out this Terminal command that not only disables Resume, but also Auto Save and Versions.\n\nA: It's a bug. According to the release notes, it was fixed by 10.7.4 which came out a few days ago:\n\nThe OS X Lion v10.7.4 Update includes fixes that:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Resolve an issue in which the \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" setting is always enabled.\n  \n\n\nA: I think it's more or less the intended behavior. Even if Resume was disabled\n\nand reopening windows was unchecked\n\nthe state of applications is still restored after you log out and back in and open them manually (or they are opened as login items). The checkbox should be called something like \"Reopen applications when logging back in\" instead.\n\nThe behavior changed on Mountain Lion. It no longer keeps the state of applications if both types of resume are disabled:\n\n\n\nA: Try TinkerTool: Its Resume tab has a global \"Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps\" option, maybe that will help.\n\nA: RestoreMeNot, a free preference pane\n\nThe window restoration feature of Mac OS X Lion is one of the coolest features of Apple's new OS. Sometimes however, one might not want the windows of a certain application to be restored when launching it. Unfortunately window restoration can only be disabled system-wide and not on a per-application basis.\nThis is where RestoreMeNot comes in and provides a simple preference pane for disabling window restoration for individual applications.\n\n", "Q: Itunes music moved over, but the rating did not I transferred music from one PC to another using Home Sharing.\nThe music all came through, but the ratings did not.\nHow do I make it move my ratings over?\n\nA: I'm afraid you cannot do it, or at least you cannot do it via the home sharing mechanism at least.\nCertain items of Meta data, (including play counts, last played, ratings etc) are not stored as a part of the songs own Meta data (Title, Album, Track number etc), but instead belong to the iTunes library as a whole.  When you transfer a song using home share, you are effectively making a copy of it and placing it into a second library, where the flags are effectively zeroed out as if they have never been set (which, they haven't, for the new library that is).\nThat's just the way iTunes works, it all revolves around your library as much as the individual items within that library, so a play count would not copy over as it is not considered a part of the song itself.\nYou may be able to script up a method of transferring such library Meta data, but it's by design that you see this behaviour using Home Share.  Tools may exist, but I'll leave it to others that may have used them to mention them as I have no relevant experience.\n", "Q: Updating software from App Store not available for purchased items. I have recently purchased Growl for handling my notifications. I had enabled my account from Greece since I was living there years ago before I got my mac. Now I have moved to Denmark and I followed the relevant procedure for changing country. Finally I purchased software after I switched my account to Denmark.\nThe issues come when there are updates for the software I bought. I am getting a message saying: \nTo update this application, sign in to the account you used to upgrade it.\n\nI followed the instructions from here and now App Store doesn't even recognize I have spend money on software and asks me again to purchase it.\nHow can I configure my App Store account properly so I don't have these issues?\n\nA: The solution is to keep 2 separate AppleID accounts:\n\n\n*\n\n*One for the country you used to live in, with a valid address for that country. Credit Card may be expired as it's not needed for updates.\n\n*Another for the country you live in now with your current details.\n\n\nI've had a long email conversation with Apple re the subject, but they don't allow for purchase transfers between countries. They treat each country's store as a separate entity with no option to transfer purchases between.\nUnfortunately this means, that in order to get an update for the apps which are attached to different AppleIDs you have to log out and log back in with different details. This is a bit of an inconvenience, but still cheaper than buying all the apps again.\n\nA: If by 'switching account' you mean that you created a new one for the new country you live in, I believe that was a mistake. Two accounts are two different identities for Apple, hence the software that was bought by the first person should not be used by the second. Why didn't you use the 'Change Country or Region' feature of iTunes? On MacOS, it's under Store > View My Account. \n", "Q: Removing right-command as \"show desktop\" I just got my Mac several months ago, and set my right-command as show desktop shortcut. Now, I want to remove it, but I totally forget how to remove this silly thing. I have checked several places as shown in the images below, but both shows that show desktop shortcut is F11, and I don't know where else should I find the configuration where I set my right-command as the show desktop, so could anyone help me?\nPS: I use OS X Lion 10.7.2\n\n\n\nA: For those who like me didn't find the right answer ;-).\nI accidentially turned on \"Show desktop\" on left \"Command\" key.\nIt has nothing to do with \"Keyboard shortcuts\" preference!\nGo to \"Preferences\" -> \"Mission Control\" and change \"Show Desktop\" key from listbox to something useful.\nRemember even if it doesn't show \"left Command\" key it uses it ;-), so change it.\n\nA: System Preferences does not allow you to assign the 'meta' keys by themselves (command, option, shift, control) to take some sort of action, I believe you installed some sort of third party program to set this up.\nThe first one that I could think of would probably be KeyRemap4MacBook, but there are many other apps that it could be.\nI would suggest that you review the icons located in your menu bar, and see if any of them have to do with keyboard customization.\n\n\nA: There is a second place (at least in Ventura) to configure this behaviour:\n\n*\n\n*Open System Settings -> Desktop & Dock\n\n*Scroll to the very bottom, and click on 'Shortcuts...' (which is actually under another set of 'Mission Control' settings)\n\n*A small window will popup, the last/bottom option defines the 'Show Desktop' keyboard shortcut\n\n*Change that thing to anything you want, F11 seems to be a safe choice\n\n\n\nA: Answer from Maciej fixed it for me (can't comment or vote because I'm too new). 'Show Desktop' in Mission Control was set to F11, but left command still showed desktop. Set show desktop to left command, tested, then back to F11, and tested again. \nAll fixed, left command is back to normal.\n", "Q: I've uninstalled Xcode and many apps were uninstalled too I've uninstalled Xcode 4 to reinstall it:\nsudo /Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all\n\n...and now I don't have Terminal.app and the Activity Monitor.app and I don't know what else apps were uninstalled.\nI'm running Lion 10.7.2. Is there a way to recover this apps?\n\nA: Both of those tools should be in your /Applications/Utilities folder. They should not be removed when uninstalling Xcode using that tool. \nIf they are no longer there, you can copy them from another machine running 10.7.2. I would make sure to pull them from another machine running the same version of the OS. This is only if you know you are missing a particular application. \nThe better route, if these applications are truly missing, would be to reinstall the OS, since as noted in the comment below, there could be many other items missing as well. With Lion, there is a new recovery tool built in. Make sure you backup your data first though. \nTo recover, just hold down Command + R when rebooting. More information is available on Apples website.\n", "Q: In Lion, the \"Open File\" dialog doesn't refresh until 30 to 60 seconds after the window appears I'm running Lion (10.7.3).  In any application, when I bring up the \"Open File\" dialog, it shows an outdated list of files — files I deleted hours ago still show up; files I recently created don't show up.\nIf I leave the dialog open for 30 to 60 seconds, it will eventually refresh and the current folder contents will be shown.  But this really slows me down.\nAny ideas about how I can speed up the refresh time so I can get back to work?\nGoing to a different folder and then back to the first folder doesn't help — the list of files is still outdated.\nClosing the dialog and then reopening it doesn't help — the list of files is still outdated.\n\nA: I don't know if this is relevant, but many times when I go to any kind of file dialogue or even just click on some tool or something, I get a few seconds (or more) of beach ball while my second HD (non-boot drive with most of my documents/non-OS files) wakes up and gets up to speed. I can hear it revving up and when it gets to speed the OS unfreezes… so maybe if your file directories are being cached in memory or the drive cache, when the HD wakes after 30 secs for whatever reason, it updates the directory lists in memory?\nI'm thinking this isn't super common complaint so maybe it's HD settings specific like my problem (I think I set my 2nd HD to have energy saving options somewhere when I installed it and haven't found a way to have it spinning 24x7.\n", "Q: Removing pictures transferred from PC to iPhone I transferred some pictures from my PC to my iPhone 4G. I am unable to delete these pictures that were sent to my iPhone.\n\nA: If you are using an iPhone 3GS, then you may still be on iOS 4.  At this OS level, the ability to delete synced photos was not available, and you would only remove photos that you took with your camera in the camera roll.  The only way to remove them, is to remove it from your sync list, and sync again.\n", "Q: Running GNU Screen with 256 colors on OS X Lion Terminal.app in Mac OS X Lion has a feature that took a long time to get implemented: 256 color support. The colors work fine. The issue I'm having is that when I run GNU Screen I do not have access to 256 colors. In screen, $TERM is set to \"screen\".\nI've read different things in different places and am very confused. Some of these include:\n\n\n*\n\n*GNU Screen must be compiled with color support (How can I tell if OS X's screen was compiled this way?)\n\n*A special terminfo file for screen-256color must be installed. Does OS X have this?\n\n*In .screenrc, term should be set to \"screen-256color\".\n\n*Certain functions in Emacs must be called for Emacs to be colorful (http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnuScreen#toc6)\n\n\nI tried variations of these procedures and have been unsuccessful and uncertain of why I have failed. What is the most direct way for me to enable 256 colors in GNU Screen?\n\nA: By default, screen is not aware that it is running in a 256-color-capable xterm. To make programs in screen recognize this feature, you need to set a couple of things in your ~/.screenrc:\nterm \"screen-256color\"\n# terminfo and termcap for nice 256 color terminal\n# allow bold colors - necessary for some reason\nattrcolor b \".I\" \n# tell screen how to set colors. AB = background, AF=foreground \ntermcapinfo xterm 'Co#256:AB=\\E[48;5;%dm:AF=\\E[38;5;%dm' \n# erase background with current bg color \ndefbce \"on\" \n\nIf this doesn’t work for you, your version of screen probably wasn’t compiled with ./configure --enable-colors256. You can check this in the welcome screen when starting screen. The default version that comes with OS X doesn’t support 256 colors. You could check out the source and compile your own version, putting the resulting binary in your $PATH (I put it in ~/bin which I added to my $PATH):\ngit clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/screen.git\ncd screen/src\n./autogen.sh\n./configure --enable-colors256\nmake   # I got a lot of warnings here, but they don't seem to matter\nsudo make install\ncp screen ~/bin/screen\n\nSources: 1 and 2\n\nA: Add the following to your ~/.screenrc\nterm \"screen-256color\"\n\nAnd then try, it should work. \n", "Q: Lion won't give out DHCP addresses with Internet Sharing Lion doesn't seem to be giving out DHCP addresses when I turn on Internet Sharing.

In Network Preferences the Wifi connection shows as yellow, with a self-assigned IP, and any device I try to connect (e.g., iPad) doesn't get an address. Help!\n\nA: I finally figured it out.\n\n\n*\n\n*You said your Firewall is off. You should double-check. This will definitely cause Internet Sharing to not work. System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Firewall.\n\n*In the \"Sharing\" panel, change your Computer Name to something simple.

In the \"DNS\" tab, delete any existing entries.\n\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: This thread along with https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2108373 helped me.\n\n\n*\n\n*I turned off all internet connection sharing.\n\n*I deleted the following files:\n/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.nat.plist\n/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist\n/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist\n\n\n*Restarted\n\n*Turned on Internet Sharing\nThis resulted in Internet Sharing sharing giving the client the correct DHCP lease details.\n\nA: This worked for me on 10.9 Mavericks (build 13A598)\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal and run \nsudo launchctl remove com.apple.bootpd\n\n\n*Re-enable Internet Sharing\nThis guy below has a basic explanation of what he's doing if you want more of an explanation and debugging process.\nhttp://ben-collins.blogspot.com/2010/08/mac-os-x-internet-sharing-problems.html\n\nA: I have OS X El Capitain and the following works for enabling the sharing of internet connection by devices connected to the ethernet connection (the local network) via the wi-fi network (the internet connected network).\n1) Network Connection --> the local connection in automatic\n2) Sharing --> Internet Sharing (set Share your connection to the Wi-Fi in the drop-down menu and tick the ethernet connection)\nAt this point if you go back to network connection you will see the wifi with a green dot and the ethernet with a yellow dot. Keep going, as (1,2) may not be enough, yet.\n3) Security --> Firewall Options --> remove the tick to \"Block all incoming connection\". (NB this is different than disabling your firewall!).\nThen you will start getting queries like \"do you want service XYZ to accept incoming connection?\". The answer to most of those questions depends on your security paranoia (mine is high) except for one!\n4) Accept bootpd (which is the daemon for DHCP).\nIn retrospect the last step is sort of obvious: when the poor device on the (local) ethernet network send a DHCP request to your Mac to get an IP address from the perspective of your Mac this is an unsolicited incoming request and therefore the Firwall will quietly drop it.\nIf you don't want (3,4) then you may set up manually the IP of the local device and your Mac to a pair of addresses on the same subent. So somenting like n0.n1.n2.nDevice and n0.n1.n2.nMac where the Ns are any number in 1-254.\n\nA: I'm using it. InternetSharing and Firewall: on do work together.\n(It's already huge enough a security shame to have to start a wireless\nnetwork with WEP).\nBeware: you should not ride the raw Internet with your Firewall: off.\nOn the other hand I'm also sure of another behaviour.\nInternetSharing doesn't start bootpd if the network connexion to\nEthernet isn't up, i.e. doesn't have an IP valid address. (And bootpd\nis the daemon which distribute IP addresses on the Wi-fi side).\nWithin the valid network configuration on top of which you want to build a sharing of your Ethernet connexion,\n\n\n*\n\n*the Ethernet connexion should be marked as green, with a valid IP Address,\n\n*the Wi-Fi connexion should be marked as yellow, with Network Name: No network selected.\n\n\nWhen you start Internet Sharing 2 details will change:\n\n\n*\n\n*the Wi-Fi icon in the menu bar should switch to grey with a white\narrow,\n\n*the Wi-Fi connexion should be marked as green, with Network Name: Internet Sharing: on.\n\n\nA: This issue can also manifest itself when you go to the Firewall Options and Block all incoming connections is enabled.\n\nA: On El Capitan, the following steps worked for me:\n1. Open security and privacy under system preferences\n2. Click on FireWall\n3. Click FireWall Options...\n4. Uncheck \"Block All Incoming Connections\"\n5. If it was unchecked, look for \"bootpd\" in the box below it\n6. Click where it says \"Block Incoming Connections\" next to bootpd\n7. Select \"Allow Incoming Connections\"  \n", "Q: Is there any way to view word documents within Safari on the Mac? The title pretty much sums up the question. I have looked, and could not find anything, neither paid, nor free. I know about the DocPreview plugin, however that does not work in Safari 5.1+. There is also the Word Browser Plugin, it was last updated in 2009, and also appears to no longer work.\nIs there another method to view Word documents inline in Safari? That is, if I click on a link, I would like to see the document full window in safari, and not be downloaded, forcing me to find the file and open it separately.\n\nA: One solution is to use Google docs — unless you hate Google :)\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the NinjaKit extension so that Safari will be able to use GreaseMonley scripts\n\n*Install the Google Docs Viewer script from userscripts.org\n\n*Now Safari will show a small icon next to Office documents that redirects to Google for online viewing\n\n\nIncidentally, NinjaKit is a great extension and there are plenty useful scripts on userscripts.org\n\nA: Also found this\n\nThis is a hack, at the moment, for the Google Docs Viewer extension\n  that exists on Google Chrome.\nI hope to develop it further and clean up the code.\nThis extension, if you don't know the original one,\n  enables you to preview PDF files and MS Office files using Google Docs\n  Viewer.\n\nIt works for Safari 7 too.\n", "Q: Is it possible to switch to a specific keyboard layout via `defaults`, *.plist or similar? I have figured out a workable shell script using osascript (AppleScript) to automatically switch to US keyboard layout when MacVim activates (triggered by Keyboard Maestro), and Swedish layout when it deactivates:\nosascript > /dev/null 2>&1 <<-RAW\non changeKeyboardLayout(layoutName)\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"SystemUIServer\"\n        tell (1st menu bar item of menu bar 1 whose description is \"text input\") to {click, click (menu 1's menu item layoutName)}\n    end tell\nend changeKeyboardLayout\n\nchangeKeyboardLayout(\"Svensk - Pro\")\nRAW\nexit $?\n\nHowever, AppleScript is truly slow and I also don't prefer to see the text input menu in the statusbar to flash open when switching back and forth.\nQuestion:\nIs there an alternative to my AppleScript approach to instantly switch layout?\n…I envision something like a defaults command or altering any .plist file as potential candidates for the job, only I don't know any specifics.\nTwo things related to the answer(s) I'm seeking:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm keen to have the change propagate instantly – faster than the sluggish AppleScript execution.\n\n*I prefer not installing new software daemons to achieve this. (Suggestions are always welcome, though, but 3rd party apps will likely not qualify as the accepted answer.)\n\nA: ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.HIToolbox.*.plist has an AppleSelectedInputSources key, but modifying it directly doesn't seem to actually change the layout.\nMost of the solutions posted at MacScripter just use UI scripting as well.\nThere's a small Objective-C utility called changeInput though that should change the layout almost instantly.\n\nA: I write a little program on objective-c cover it in an Alfred Workflow, and you can try it: https://github.com/bimawa/alfredWorkFlows/blob/master/DirectlySwitchKeyboard.alfredworkflow\nAnd now compile binary for cli 64 bit: https://github.com/bimawa/alfredWorkFlows/blob/master/Utilites/DirectlySwitchKeyboard/KeyboardSwitcher/bin/KeyboardSwitcher\non enter wait one argument like \"com.apple.keylayout.US\"\nWith BTT working faster.\n", "Q: uTorrent remote asks to touch screen and move to login without success When I browse from my iphone 4 it takes me remote.utorrent.com/srp\nThe it asks me to\n\nTouch screen and Move\nTouch the screen and move your finger to fill the progress bar below...\n\n\nThis worked both on my PC and MacBook, but now does not work on the iPhone.\n\n*\n\n*Can anyone reproduce?\n\n*What could the problem be?\n\n*Is there any way around this?\n\nI have iOS 5.0\n\nA: As soon as the question was ready I solved the problem.\nI was on inPrivate mode and for whatever reason, it does not detect the moving.\nAs soon as you go to the normal browsing mode, it detects correctly the movement.\nIf anyone can figure out why that happens, it would be great to know.\nAnyway, I hope this can help someone else in the future.\n\nA: I don't have specific details, but certain events and media types are disabled when browsing in Private Mode. A notable one is any sort of audio/video media.\nIf you enable private mode you can't view embedded video or audio. For example, enable private mode and visit YouTube or Vimeo, you will get a play icon with a cross through it. Same goes for any sites that embed MP3s or other media into a page, these will not work. It seems that there are certain events included in this list; location tracking will not be allowed, and while I don't know exactly what uTorrent employs on that page, it's obvious that it doesn't work for the same reason as the above either.\nI can't find any documentation on the matter on Apple nor anyone else's site, nor info on why this change was made. I have to believe it was intentional, but I don't how playing media will eventually result in leaking private data even with Private Mode on.\n\nA: If you want to keep Safari in private mode, you can download Chrome for iPhone. That happened to me too and using Chrome is all OK.. \n", "Q: How to set up so on the Mac the default new user will have a single color wallpaper? We are trying to set up multiple user accounts on a Mac and wish to have all the users' desktop wallpaper to be single colored (such as aqua blue). It can be done manually but I would like to know if there is a way or script out there so that when a new user is created in \"Users & Groups,\" the default wall paper in that account will be automatically set to a single color.\nThank you.\n\nA: The only way I know how is to modify the System's \"User Template\". Here's the steps I used to test on Lion.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a current account to specify the desktop wallpaper you want. (If\nyou use \"Solid Colors\" there's a button in the lower right to pick a\ncustom color.\n\n*Copy the current account's com.apple.desktop.plist file to the user template:\nsudo cp ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.desktop.plist /System/Library/User\\ Template/Non_localized/Library/Preferences/\n\n\nA: Mac OS X Lion Server has a profile manager that can assist in pushing settings to both new and existing users. Similarly, you can edit whatever localized versions of the default user template as they are stored in /System/Library/User Template. This might be simpler if you prefer to make changes on the machines directly and not bother with setting up a server.\n", "Q: How can I view iTunes metadata lyrics without using Get Info in iTunes? I want a third-party application which will show me the lyrics I've entered in my songs' metadata, preferably without a dock icon. Either a pop-up of some sort or displaying them on the desktop would be acceptable.\nI've tried Get Lyrical, but I don't want something that will search for lyrics automatically. I can't use Cover Version, as it purportedly doesn't work on Lion. LessLyrics/LessDJ doesn't quite fit my needs, as I'd rather have something a bit less visible.\nAnother possibility, and just as acceptable, is if there are individual files stored with the lyrics of the currently playing track. That's unlikely, but please let me know if it's the case.\n\nA: Have you tried Lyritop? It's an app that displays the current iTunes song lyrics on the desktop. It does display a dock icon. You can also adjust font, size, position, color, shadow, etc.\nThere are no individual lyric files that are stored on your computer. The lyric information is embedded in the id3 tag of each song file. There is an app called MP3LyricsExtractor that will batch extract song lyrics into individual text files. \n", "Q: Is it possible to use 6GB of memory in my MacBook Pro 3,1? The specifications of my MacBook Pro say the maximum memory supported is 4GB using two 2GB DDR2 667MHz each.\nHowever, some say that this model can support up to 6GB of memory, putting a 4GB Memory DDR3 1066MHz in one of the slot and 2GB (or 4GB, 6GB directing in this case memory).\nThe bus is 800MHz MacBook Pro. How should I install memory in the two memory slots to get the highest memory capacity and performance in my MacBook Pro?\n\nA: Yes. I own a MacBook Pro 3,1. I installed 6GB memory and have been using it like that for more than two years. Note the specifications below. You can call the tech support people at Other World Computing if you have any questions.\nThe RAM in my system is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bank 0: 2GB DDR2 SDRAM 667 MHz\n\n*Bank 1: 4GB DDR2 SDRAM 667 MHz\n\n\nA: Your Macbook Pro does support 6GB of RAM.\nApple states that it's 4GB, but OWC continuously check the max. supported RAM.\nSee this list here.\n\n", "Q: Choosing the default application does not stay as default after reboot When I'm opening .avi files, I want to open them with VLC Media player, when right clicking the item, I see this:\n\nAs you can see QuickTime is the default player, I want to change it to VLC, so I change it:\n\nAfter changing it, every .avi I open gets opened by VLC, however, when I reboot my Mac, the default goes back to QuickTime... how do I prevent this and keep VLC as the default.\n\nA: I was doing it the wrong way like you try to for a long time and also have retreated to using RCDefaultApp in the past... but there's actually a way to do that natively which works.\nDo the following:\n1) right click your file \n2) choose \"Get Info\"\n3) in the popup find the \"Open with\" strip (this is by default closed) and open it\n4) from the drop down choose the program you want to open that type of file\n5) click \"Change all...\"\n\nAnd that's the correct way to do it\n\nA: There's a great preference pane RCDefaultApp. It should do what you want.\n\nRCDefaultApp is a Mac OS X 10.2 or higher preference pane that allows a user to set the default application used for various URL schemes, file extensions, file types, MIME types, and Uniform Type Identifiers (or UTIs; MacOS 10.4 only). MacOS X uses the extension and file type settings to choose the application when opening a file in Finder, while Safari and other applications use the URL and MIME type settings at other times for content not related to a file (such as an unknown URL protocol, or a media stream).\n\n\nA: For anyone Googling for the same issue: as the venerable RCDefaultApp is now broken under 10.12 and later, there's a open-source equivalent SwiftDefaultApp\n\nThis Preference pane is chiefly intended to be a modern replacement for the amazing RCDefaultApp developed way back when by Carl Lindberg, which stopped working in 10.12 due to deprecation of ObjC Garbage collection\n...\nThis Preference pane will let you view and change default application\nassociations for basically any URI Scheme and/or filetype in macOS.\n\nThe UI is practically identical to RCDefaultApps, exception that \"Extensions\" (i.e. file extensions) is now rolled into \"Uniform Type Identifiers\", and it can be a little harder to find a specific extension. However, it works beautifully, both as a solution to the issue and as a replacement for RCDefaultApp.\n", "Q: How did iPhone 4 know to switch timezone in Airplane Mode? I have both an iPhone 4 (from work) and an iPhone 3GS (personal). Today I took a cross country flight from BOS to LAX. Upon boarding the plane this morning, after having stayed up all night packing (and procrastinating from packing), I stowed my bags, put my iPhones in Airplane Mode, and promptly fell asleep. When I woke up after what felt like a long time, I checked the time on my iPhone 4 and was disappointed that only two hours had apparently passed. Then I flipped on the flight map and was surprised to see that we were soon to descend into Los Angeles.\nSomehow, despite being in my pocket in Airplane Mode the entire flight, the iPhone 4 had adjusted its clock to the Pacific timezone. Meanwhile, the iPhone 3GS had not. It was still on Boston time.\nHow did the iPhone 4 know to do this while in Airplane Mode?\n\nA: Since your phone is a Verizon iPhone, it got the time from the cell towers. (Verizon, along with Sprint and unlike AT&T and T-Mobile, uses CDMA which broadcasts the local time from the cell towers.)\nIt must be that Airplane Mode is actually \"don't transmit\" mode instead of \"don't transmit or receive\" mode as I'd always assumed.\nEdit my reasoning:\n\n\n*\n\n*I know that CDMA phones get the local time from the cell towers (if you're driving, you can watch your phone switch time zones as you cross the border). \n\n*I also know that cell towers broadcast their availability so they can be found by phones. It makes sense, then, that the time signal might be in this broadcast signal. \n\n*One of the reasons Airplane Mode exists is to prevent transmissions from potentially disrupting aircraft systems. \n\n*Turning off transmit functionality does not necessarily preclude receiving data. Leaving receive on may actually be a benefit, as the phone can passively monitor cell towers in the area so as to know which one it wants to talk to when/if Airplane Mode is turned off.\n\n*If you're passively listening to the towers already and they're broadcasting the time anyway, it would be logical to update the system time to whatever local time is since you already have the data available and you can give the user the most accurate information possible.\n\n\nA: Wi-Fi can be enabled even in Airplane mode, maybe your flight had Wi-Fi in it and your phone connected to it?\n\nA: GPS... My guess is your phone got an update from GPS satellites and when it fixed it's position it realized it was in a new timezone and made the change to the internal clock.\nAll GPS signals contain encoded time data, as the correct time is required in order to triangulate and determine position.\n", "Q: Move contents of one directory to another I have a Time Machine backup of my entire system on a hard drive (the system folder and everything else seems to be there). How do I move all of the contents of this directory to another directory? There are files not shown in Finder (/etc, /usr, etc) that cannot be moved, and there are too many to move over manually by Terminal. Thanks for your help.\n\nA: You can try using something like Unison to sync folder contents and then delete the source directory once it's synced up.\n\nA: Use Disk Utility to create a disk image of the contents. Then scan the image for restore. Finally, restore the image to the correct volume.\n", "Q: Advanced WiFi network settings are not per-network? Like most people, I move often with my laptop, and thus I also often switch WiFis networks. There is a WiFi network I often connect to which requires the IP to be entered manually.\nSo I opened Network Preferences, picked WiFi, clicked Advanced..., TCP/IP, and I told it to \"Configure IPv4: Manually\". I entered all the info and it connected just fine.\nBut now I am back home, where I always get the IP using DHCP. To my surprise, the \"Configure IPv4\" stayed at \"Manually\". Why didn't it revert to DHCP?\nIn short, why isn't the \"Configure IPv4\" option per-network as it should be? What's the idea behind making it a global setting for all networks?\nAnd finally, can I make it a per-network setting?\n\nA: You can change your location in the apple button in the menubar, that way you won't have to open the system preferences, there are apps to change system preferences according to wi-fi connection: at the bottom of this post some are mentioned\n\nA: Create a new location using the Network preference panel for the manual/static IP network rather than changing and re-changing the settings for Automatic.\n", "Q: How can I backup and restore Wi-Fi profiles in Lion? I want to reinstall my Macbook, but i do not want to loose all my saved WPA/WEP Wi-Fi profiles.\nIs there a way to back them up and restore them after the reinstall?\n\nA: If you backup your keychain as well as the file /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist\nand restore them on a new installed Lion, you won't lose them.\nAnother way would be to use the Migration Assistant on a Time Machine Backup of your old system, but this would restore ALL your system settings. That's probably not what you want, otherwise you wouldn't consider reinstalling.\n", "Q: How can I mount a remote SSH folder on Mac? I do not like SFTP client applications, like Cyberduck. I want to access the SSH folder as a local disk driver, where you can read/write/copy/paste files.\nI tried fuse4x+sshfs. It works but has a bug: the mounted driver disappears when Mac OS X wakes up, and I can not mount it again except by resetting Mac OS.\nIs there a better choice?\n\nA: Transmit - The ultimate Mac OS X FTP + SFTP + S3 app can do this.\nAnother choice would be ExpanDrive - SFTP/FTP/S3 Drive but I think Transmit is the better option (I own both and am affiliated with neither).\nThere are demos of both programs available, so you can try both.\nNote that Transmit is sold both through the Mac App Store and directly the developer (Panic). You would be better off buying it from Panic directly because of the impending sandboxing rules for the Mac App Store.\n", "Q: Eudora crashes under Snow Leopard when checking mail I have a weird Eudora problem that I don't even know quite where to start to solve.

I started using Reminders.app as soon as I got iOS 5.0, and for me it mostly works very well. As soon as I got an iCloud account, of course I turned reminder syncing on there as well.\nHowever I soon found that reminder syncing is still quite buggy at this stage. In particular, it doesn't seem to handle moving to-do items from list to list very well. I often got duplicate items and had other problems. (Note: This is not the topic of my question.)\nSo I finally decided to live without reminder syncing, and just use Reminders.app on my iPhone only. I turned off reminder syncing in iCloud. This did solve the problem with duplicate items, and I'm mostly happy with it.\nBut... I noticed that Reminders.app still seems to be accessing the network, even though I haven't configured reminders to sync with anything. (I am basing this observation on the little spinner in the status bar at the top of the iPhone screen.)\nAnd whenever it does this, some of the old problems come back -- mostly sluggishness and jerky scrolling, etc.\nI have verified that when I put the iPhone into airplane mode, the problem doesn't happen.\nDoes anyone know why Reminders.app would still try to access the network when iCloud syncing is turned off? What is it trying to do? Any way to turn it off completely?\n\nA: Settings > Locations Services > Reminders > Off\nIf this is on, it'll be periodically checking your location, having nothing to do with iCloud.\n\nA: Try and turn off Reminders under the following setting pages and see if it helps:\n\nSettings > Cellular under Use cellular data for: (will be a long list)\n\nMight have nothing to do with Reminders trying to connect to the internet, but it's worth a shot:\n\nSettings > Notification Center under Today view: \n\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu via Boot Camp on 1st gen Macbook running Lion Does anyone know if it's possible to install Ubuntu via bootcamp on a first gen Macbook running Lion? I'd prefer not to use Parallels/VMware due to the fact that it's only got 1GB of RAM in it and I'd prefer not to upgrade it.\n\nA: Boot Camp steps\n\n*\n\n*Download Windows drivers for your Mac.\n\n*Partition your hard drive to make space for Windows.\n\n*Sets your Mac to default boot into Windows after installation.\n\nNone of these options will help you  with your Ubuntu installation except for the partitioning. But this can also be done using Disk Utility. Therefore, I recommend using Disk Utility to change your partition scheme. This will also take care moving your Recovery HD partition (which GParted on the LiveCD will not do that easily).\nEasiest Ubuntu Install\n\n*\n\n*Using Disk Utility, add a second \"partition\" and make that free space.\n\n*During the Ubuntu installation process choose to install Ubuntu next to the Mac OS. This will also automatically partition the free space for your needs.\n\n*Install rEFIt to sync the partition tables.\n\nFurther options\n\n*\n\n*creating a file exchange partition for Ubuntu and MacOSX\n\n*manually formatting the free space using the LiveCD in order to create a separate /home directory\n\n", "Q: Can I connect 3 screens to my iMac? I am trying to connect iMac to 2 other monitors as well as my TV. That is a total of 4 displays.\nHERE IS MY PLAN!!!-(I'm not rich)\nI have a 21.5 inch iMac that has one thunderbolt port but can also be used as a mini-dvi port. I want to connect that to a Cirago HDX3DP01 HydraDisplay X3 DP to 3 DP Multimonitor Adapter \nThis in theory will allow me to connect to 2 monitors with an open slot for my TV.  I do question the resolution output. The HydraDisplay supports up to 3840 x 1024 (3x 1280x1024). I'm not sure what that means. Which resolution is it? I know that the 21.5-inch iMac has a native resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels, while the 27-inch iMacs are 2560 by 1440 pixels. This means at top resolution of the HydraDisplay is cannot support the native resolution of the IMac 21.5 nor the 27-inch. Will this matter when mirroring or sharing the screens as one? (disregarding the TV)\nSo, I have several questions:\n1. Will this work?\n2. Is resolution a big deal when sharing screens?\n3. Has anyone ever tried this or have a better way of doing it besides expensive thunderbolt? \n\nA: From the link I can only find the interface used is DisplayPort (not Mini Display Port or DVI) which to my knowledge are different standards which means item 1) would not work\nFor item 2) what is the purpose of having multiple displays? Are you repurposing extra displays or actually have an alternate need?\nFor item 3) I use a USB display monitor which allows me to connect multiple additional screens trough different USB ports in addition to my standard display out.\n\nA: I have three screens.... \n\nI'm using a kensington universal adapter to add the extra one - I've ordered another (expecting delivery today actually) so I should be able to run four... will let you know how it goes... \nEDIT - adding another kensington adapter did work... \n\nEDIT2 - as a follow up I should mention that this is running Lion (worked with snow leopard) and to run the Kensington adapter on OSX you have to download drivers from the manufacturers site. Regarding CPU usage - there is an overhead - but it does depent on what you are doing with the screen.

ZEVO support for Time Machine\nCan I use a ZEVO-managed USB hard disk for Time Machine backups? \nZFS dedup\nWill ZEVO and Time Machine give me de-duplication (which is sorely missing from Time Machine on HFS+, especially if you backup multiple machines to the same disk)?\n\nA: In the Time Machine pane of System Preferences, add any ZFS dataset. \nFor the first backup to that dataset, the operating system will: \n\n\n*\n\n*create a sparse bundle disk image (….sparsebundle) at the root of that dataset\n\n*attach the image, after which you'll see a volume named Time Machine Backups.\n\n\nFor each subsequent backup to that dataset, the OS will: \n\n\n*\n\n*attach the image, after which you'll see the Time Machine Backups volume.\n\n\nTime Machine routines with ZFS are similar or identical to the routines that apply when backing up to a device – such as an Apple Time Capsule – that uses AFP. \n\nHow can one recover from TM after new/reinstallation? New OS installation knows nothing about ZFS to TM image is unreachable.\n\nA: Time Machine backups can only be stored on HFS+ volumes. The reason is that Time Machine relies on the ability to create new hard links to existing directories, which you cannot do in ZFS.\n", "Q: How can I stop \"Word is finishing analyzing your document\"? I'm writing a document about 100 pages with MS Office 2011 for Mac. While I'm editing the content, Word would halt almost every minutes with \"Word is finishing analyzing your document\" message and a running progress bar.\nAt first it's only a short pause; however, as the document gets larger, the halt time gets longer too. Now it would take about 10 seconds to finish each \"analyzing\", and while Word is \"analyzing\" any operation is not accepted, until the progress bar runs to the end. And that's driving me crazy.\nI've done the search and I know that problem existed since 2004. But all this year it seemed not to be fixed with some consistent method.\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm using a Apple Mac OS X version of Office, and I don't have any pieces of software from Adobe installed. No PDFMaker, no PDFWriter, no PDF{anything}, no Acrobat, no Acrobat Reader, no CS, even Flash is manually removed.\n\n*The \"Add-Ins\" folder inside Office folder is empty -- I've just ensured that with \"sudo rm -Rf *\" terminal command under that directory.\n\n*The \"Startup/Word\" folder is also empty, too.\n\n*There is no such template called PDFmaker.dot or PDF{anything} in the template tree: I've check them all.\n\n*Auto spell check is off. Auto grammar check is off, Auto correction is off. Auto saving is off.\nThe only thing I've suspected now, is Auto-Text. That document is a technical spec and it's filled with figure captions, table captions, foot-notes, and cross-references. That message would almost surely show up when I'm performing adding something in the middle of document that will push some content to the next page. But I can't find a way to turn-off the auto-update of Auto-Text.\nAny idea would be appreciated -- but please focus on MS Office. That's my job and I've to be \"compatible\" with others.\n\nA: How to stop word 'finishing analysing your document' - Go to: \nWord/preferences/edit. Then untick 'keep track of formatting'. It'll stop this from happening. \nNote however - if you want to 'select all' (from the 'style' box - when selecting a style-type to change), you need to re-tick the above box.\n\nA: The problem is inherent to Word, and has nothing to do with any add-ins or any of the settings you mention in your list. The process can be stopped by pressing Command ⌘ + ., but as soon as you take any other action, it will start again. Based on tests I have done, it results from a combination of having tracked changes in the document (even if revision-tracking is turned off) plus automatic page numbering plus a table of contents (or of figures or tables).\nIf you accept all changes and do no more tracking, Word will stop analyzing the document, regardless of TOCs or automatic page numbering. Or if you leave the tracked changes, Word will stop analyzing the document if you delete both the automatic page numbering (in the footer) from all sections AND the table(s) of contents.\nI work on lots of huge Word documents, so I took the trouble to do systematic tests to figure out why Word was constantly stopping to analyze the document. Unfortunately, most of my clients require revision-tracking!  \n\nA: I had this same problem. I tried all the various suggestions--including those that clearly did not apply to me--and nothing worked. I was literally going to return this MacBook Pro...then I notice a note about copying and pasting the whole document into a new black document and it worked! My starting point was a ~500 page Word 2003 document from a PC. I had already \"Converted\" it in Mac Word and that hadn't helped. I selected all, copy, and pasted the entire thing in a new blank document and it worked. In fact, I doubled the document size just to be sure and no issues. I've been trying to stress-test it by running various commands and trying various options. So far I've been able to make it go into \"finishing analyzing\" for only a few seconds at most. I'm so relieved.\n\nA: I think I found a way to run from it - at least has been working. Open Word and create a blank page; don't write anything; then open the file that you wish to edit and it will open without analysing. \n", "Q: Is it possible to arrange the order of movies in iTunes?

I'm interested in getting an SSD for my MacBook Pro (2.2Ghz Early 2011) and I can't find out if it's possible to, when I first get the SSD, put it inside my MBP and then boot up with my OS X Lion USB stick which I created back when I did a clean install of Lion.\nCan I do a completely clean fresh install on the blank SSD? And then transfer over a few of my files from an external hard drive that I want on it?\nI'd rather do this as most of my files are easily transferrable and the amount of clone software and mirroring software etc. I'm reading about just has me confused to be honest.

Hold the ⌥ key while booting up to select your install USB.\nAlso note that if you upgrade to the most recent version of Lion you should get the recovery partition to boot up without having to use the USB (internet connection required).\n\nA: Yes.\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have the latest SSD firmware installed. The hardware reseller should provide needed instructions. You may do this later.\n\n*Install your new SSD.\n\n*Insert your Lion Install USB. Hold ⌥ on bootup and select your install USB.

Every time I plug it in, a pop up comes up that says: The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer.\nI opened up Disk Utility and tried to erase it, in the hope of making it readable. It shows the loading bar and after a couple minutes, a pop-up appears and says: Disk Erase failed with the error: Unable to write to the last block of the device. So I remove it, and try again with no avail. I even tried using terminal and the diskutil eraseVolume command and I get: \nnewfs_hfs: write (sector 0): Invalid argument\n\nMounting disk\n\nCould not mount disk2 with name (null) after erase\n\nError: -69832: File system formatter failed\n\nSo I tookit out, and tried again with diskutil randomDisk just to see if I couldeven write on it. and then I got this:\nStarted erase on disk2\nError: -69879: Couldn't open disk\nUnderlying error: 2: POSIX reports: No such file or directory\n\nDoes anyone have any idea how I can make this drive readable?\n\nA: Can you get the disk identifier? In Disk Utility, select the drive and choose \"Info\" – it should read something like disk1 or disk2 or so. (But NOT disk0; that's your internal HD!)\nThen open a terminal, and type in\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/diskX\n\n(where diskX is of course the disk identifier you got earlier.)\nType in your admin password, and it should overwrite every block of the disk with 0x00 (i.e. erase it).\nThen, you can format your drive.\n[Please be cautious when doing this; I'm not responsible for anything if anything goes wrong ;-)]\n\nA: You've said in your question that you've been trying to erase the flash drive; not format it. Try formatting instead by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility\n\n*Select your flash drive\n\n*Select the Partition tab\n\n*Select Partition 1 under Partition Layout\n\n*Name the drive what you want under Partition Information\n\n*Make sure Mac OS Extended (Journaled) is selected under Format\n\n*Select Apply\n\n*Now sit back and watch your Mac do the rest\n\n*Rejoice!\n\n\nLet me know if this works, or if you have any other questions.

Apparently the sensor in macbook pros and air can get stuck.\nCrazy, but after hours trying different things in terminal and disk util, the solution was to blow really hard in to the SD drive then remount SD card and erase it as per instruction.\n\nA: need to reinstall the firmware of the drive using a windows computer\n", "Q: Where are System Preferences settings stored? Trying to script equal brightness settings for two monitors Does anyone know where the System Preferences settings are stored on Mac OS X? I presume there's some .plist with them somewhere.\nI think that they might be stored in multiple .plist files. I'm looking for the setting for the brightness slider in particular because I'd like to be able to write a script that sets the brightness to be exactly the same for two monitors.\n\nA: Preference locations\nSome system-wide settings are in /Library/Preferences, and some user settings are in ~/Library/Preferences. I say \"some\" because I have found settings in these locations before, but have not done an exhaustive search. Also, this is what could be called an implementation detail. It's not documented publicly by Apple, is not intended for users to manipulate directly (by editing the .plist files), and the way it works could change without warning in a future version of OS X. The fact that Apple made ~/Library hidden by default on Lion is a good indication that the contents of this directory are not intended to be modified by typical users. So, for best results, you should modify the settings indirectly through System Preferences itself.\nHaving said that, I changed the brightness of my iMac running 10.7.3, then went looking for changed plist files in the directories listed above. I couldn't find anything pertaining to screen brightness.\nHowever, I was able to use Automator to record a workflow that opens System Preferences, goes to the Displays pref pane, and adjusts the brightness slider. This may be an easier and more reliable option for you. A quick Google search indicates that automator workflows can run from the command line, but I didn't try this.\nI'll also add that one of my setups is a MacBook Air with a 30\" cinema display. Setting the brightness to the same percentage on both (25% for example) does not mean that the brightness matches visually. You will likely need to choose different brightness levels for each display to get them to appear equally bright.\nMonitoring filesystem usage by System Preferences\nEDIT: The way you can see which plist files are accessed or modified while running System Preferences is to run a command like this in Terminal:\nsudo fs_usage -w | grep \"System Pref\" | grep plist | grep -v \"Info\\.plist\"\n\nThis command outputs a huge list of paths and files, some of which don't exist. File updates continued logging for a few seconds after I quit the app.\nIf you go this route, here's what I recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dump the list to a textfile\n\n*Eliminate duplicate paths\n\n*Look at the files which have been modified. Files with states such as \"stat64\", \"open\", and \"getattrlist\" are just being opened for reading, but files with states of \"chmod\" or \"rename\" are being modified. I saw my ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.systempreferences.plist file get renamed with an extension of .CvkFEbo, which I believe is the system's way of performing an atomic file write (write the entire file under a different name, and if that is successful, rename it to the original filename).\n\n\nUnfortunately, I still didn't turn up anything regarding a screen brightness setting persisted to disk, but I have only lightly skimmed the fs_usage results to now.\nCommand-line tool to control brightness\nI found an article that lists source code for controlling screen brightness on OS X using the CoreGraphics framework. The article is a little over two years old, and I haven't tried it myself, but it may be useful to you.

Leopard was released 2007 and Snow Leopard was released 2 years later in 2009. They both look pretty much the same, with a few minor GUI exceptions. They almost work the same, again with a few minor exceptions. I know that the whole Finder was re-written, but I want to know more detail about the differences between the two. What are the major difference between Leopard (10.5) and Snow Leopard (10.6)?\n\nA: I remember watching the keynote when Snow Leopard was introduced: Steve Jobs pointed out how fast Mac OS X was being improved and new features were added. Several major upgrades have been shipped, while Microsoft took years to ship Vista.\nFrom the beginning, Snow Leopard had the focus on improving the overall system performance and optimizing already implemented features. Also, cleanup was required as PowerPC support was dropped.\nBecause no major end user related features have been added, it's been widely assumed that this is why the price dropped from $129 to $29.\nChanges:\n\n*\n\n*support for 64-bit applications (you can also boot the kernel in 64-bit mode if supported)\n\n*Grand Central Dispatch helps to get more out of your multi core processor.\n\n*OpenCL offers GPU hardware acceleration for any application.\n\n*PowerPC support was dropped.\n\n*Microsoft Exchange Support for Mail, iCal, Address Book.\n\n*QuickTime X (full screen view, http live streaming...)\n\n*Safari introduced Top Sites, Cover Flow and sandboxing for plug-ins.\n\n*Anti-malware alerts.\n\n*Finder rewritten in Cocoa.\n\n", "Q: Contacts in a calendar appointment I've noticed that I can add contacts to a calendar appointment.

So far I've checked cornerstone and versionapp, neither of which allows to do that.\nI've also tried mounting a remote disk (SFTP) using Transmit 2, but that resulted in an error when I've tried to checkout the SVN or add a working copy later on.\n\nA: This may be a silly to suggest, but Nautilus on Ubuntu Linux has mounting of network drives, and ssh repositories and such built it very nicely. I used to edit code using this method with gedit. As for the mac, I would say that Transmit with its MacFUSE plugin is probably what I would use. What error are you getting?\n\nA: I think your best option is to mount the remote working tree locally so it appears like a network file system, that way you can use all your exisiting SVN tools.\nAs to how you can mount the remote working tree, that's depends on how much access you have on the server and whether you can install new software on it.\nSSHFS \nYou can use sshfs (included in macfuse), that's probably the most straight forward to setup, no commericial software needed.\nhttp://code.google.com/p/sshfs-gui/\nVPN + LAN Sharing\nYou can VPN to the server (using OpenVPN, PPTP or LogMein Hamachi) then mount the working tree as a Samba/NFS share locally.\n", "Q: How do I set up a Mac to use both FileVault and Boot Camp?

Can I explain to the Boot Camp software that I want a third partition accessible to both systems?\nCan I use Microsoft's disk encryption for the Windows partition at the same time?\n\nA: It is possible to use Bootcamp with the new Filevault.  The exact method of achieving this may differ depending on if you already have Filevault turned on, and want to install bootcamp, or if you already have bootcamp, and want to turn on Filevault...\nEither way, you will need to ensure that you use the very latest bootcamp drivers package (4.0), which either need applying to your existing windows install or writing to CD/USB stick prior to beginning the bootcamp installer.\nTo check your current BootCamp level, run Boot Camp Assistant and select About from the menu bar, at the present time the current version is Version 4.0.1 (429).\n", "Q: How do you clean dust from the inside of a MacBook Pro? I have a 2010 MBP and lately I've noticed dust showing up underneath the keys and above under the screen hinge. I've looked at the ifixit.com tutorials here but they don't have any guides on how to clean dust. I also have AppleCare, but this thread mentions it doesn't cover cleaning dust. I imagine \"dusty\" would be subjective, but they could give you 2 cleans a year or something. Can anyone verify that they don't clean dust from parts? In the end I'll probably open it up and use a dust-buster, but thought it'd be good to check first.\n\nA: Yeah, on a 2010 MacBook pro, there is no way to separate the keyboard from the top case without disassembling the entire machine. The best way to clean out those keys is to get some compressed air and go to town on it. \n", "Q: How to make the pcscd daemon load at startup on Lion?

The standard behaviour is for the last selected item in the source list to be selected on launch, except when a device is connected, in which case iPhoto attempts to show you photos ready to import from the connected device.\nHow can I get iPhoto to ignore the connected device and just show me last item selected, which in my case is always Photostream since I'm constantly posting screen grabs of app defects?\n\nA: Iphoto>Preferences>General>Connecting A Camera>Opens No Application.\nor \nyou can do it through the Image Capture application. There is a pane in the lower left where you can change the preferences when the iPhone is connected.\nSo\n1. connect the phone\n2. open Image Capture\n3. change the settings for the iPhone which is treated as a camera. \n\nA: I'm afraid there isn't a way of doing this.  Either plugging your phone in after starting iPhoto, or starting it with it plugged in immediately switches to it.  I can't even think of a workaround, so the only advice I can offer you is to file a feedback entry suggesting it as unwelcome behaviour.\n", "Q: Inconsistent App Store ratings stars representation In the iTunes App Store for iPhone, the rating is often displayed near the application's icon. Sometimes, when there are no ratings, the empty stars have an orange outline and sometimes they don't. \nIs there a significance to having the orange outline?

When I connect and sync my iPhone to iTunes it only transfers over purchased songs and not songs I ripped from a music cd.  How do I get all of them to sync?\n\nA: There are multiple ways to get around this issue, and I've detailed one below. Before trying that, though, see if this solves your problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the iPhone in the iTunes sidebar. Go to the Music tab and look at what music is syncing.\n\n*I expect maybe only the \"Purchased\" playlist is syncing, and that's why. If that's the case, simply select  and you're set!\n\n\nHere's the other fix, if that doesn't work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the iPhone in the iTunes sidebar. Find the tick box that looks like this:  and make sure it's checked.\n\n*Go to Music in the sidebar and select everything (Tip: ⌘ (command or control) A!).\n\n*Drag everything to your iPhone.\n\n\nA: Another small suggestion.  Select some song in iTunes that is not being transfered to the iPhone.  Look in the Advanced menu and see if the option \"Create iPod or iPhone Version\" is available.  If so, use it.\n\n", "Q: Is it okay to install OS X on an external drive, and then install that drive as an internal drive? My internal drive is suffering hardware failure, so I bought OS X Snow Leopard (to upgrade my iMac from Leopard), a new drive, and a cheap external USB 2.0 enclosure.  My plan is to install a clean copy of Snow Leopard on the new drive as an external drive, restore a time-machine backup to it, and then finally swap the new drive into the iMac.\nThe main reason I'm doing it in this order, instead of just putting the drive in first, is timing.  It's easier to install OS X on a fresh drive and restore the time machine backup during the week, when I have less time to mess with it, because those are fairly hands-off activities.  I plan to do the drive swap this weekend when I have time for it, as I hear it is a fairly involved process to replace the internal drive on an iMac.\n\nA: I've done this several times and never had a problem. Just make certain your external drive uses the correct partition scheme (GUID for Intel Macs) and format.\nI once forgot to change the partition scheme and, as a result, couldn't run firmware updates until I reformatted the drive.\n\nA: After going through this same type of issue, I'd suggest using an approach of getting a new external drive, migrating your programs and data then installing it as  you suggested.  Afterwards, I'd go ahead and do any software updates you had planned.  \nThis entire process is outlined at Other World Computing (www.macsales.com). you can buy the drive, get the transfer software (carbon copy cloner) and instructions on how to do it.  I used this process twice and it worked great.\n\nA: It is fine, I have done this countless times when I moved to SSD, just remember to go to Preferences --> Startup Disk and select the correct boot up drive after swapping. You only need to do this once otherwise you'll notice the boot sequence takes longer\n\nA: For posterity, and for anyone else that runs into the same issue as me, here is the general steps I followed, and other important notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Alsoft DiskWarrior ($99) was an invaluable tool for rebuilding the directory structure on the failing drive when Disk Utility tells you that the drive is unrepairable.  It let me restore the drive to copy recent files that hadn't made it to my Time Machine backup yet.\n\n*I purchased a new drive and cheap $10 external case from Otherworld Computing.  I liked dealing with them because they are very Mac-centric, and have tools to select your exact model Mac to be sure the drive will work with yours.  You can certainly use other vendors, but make sure the drive is compatible with your Mac!\n\n*I put the new drive in the external case, and bought a copy of OS X Snow Leopard (you can pick it up for under $29 single-user, or $49 family pack in the Apple Store).  This was handy, as we had misplaced our original install disks, so otherwise had no way to format the new drive and copy the Time Machine backup over to it.  Plus now we can upgrade to 10.6, of course.\n\n*If you are not comfortable with working inside a computer, you may want to find a friend or repair shop to help you with opening up the computer to replace the drive.\n\n*Several guides are available on YouTube and on the internet for opening up an iMac and replacing the drive.  The key is, make sure you look up the guide for the correct model iMac that you have.  If you are not sure what exact model iMac you have, you can use a site like Wikipedia to look it up and get your model number (you probably also need this to order your new hard drive, forgot to mention that!).\n\n*Don't forget proper static precautions when doing surgery on your Mac!\n\n*Hopefully once you succeed, then the first thing you should do is make a back up of your new drive.\n\n*Now I was free to finally do the 10.6 upgrade, with a new drive and freshly backed-up contents.\n\n*I'll likely keep the spare external $10 case handy, either to pull forgotten data off the old failed drive, or to buy and install a new, larger backup drive down the road.\n\n", "Q: How do delete pictures from the iPhone 4S camera roll but still keep them in my album? I made albums for my pictures and want to keep them in the albums and delete them from the camera roll.  When I try to delete the pictures from the camera roll it says it will delete from everywhere. Then I no longer have them in the albums.  \n\nA: Download your photos to your computer and put them in albums in iPhoto (or whatever photo software you use). Then sync those albums back to the phone using iTunes. \nI don't think there's a no-PC solution to this yet. \n\nA: If you delete pictures from the camera roll on iPhone you get only one option: Delete from everywhere.\nTo solve this headache connect your iPhone to your pc, then look for the iPhone icon click on it and it will show only pictures on the camera roll.\nHighlight these pictures copy or move them to a folder you create on the hard drive then delete all the pictures you don't need from the pc and the pictures you have in albums on iPhone will not be touched, now sync the iPhone using iTunes and you won't see the deleted pics again.\n\nA: Apple has an answer here (HT3603):\n\nPictures and screenshots taken with your iOS device are stored on the Camera Roll (or Saved Photos for devices without a camera). When you sync or perform a restore, iTunes creates a backup of the contents of your iOS device, including the Camera Roll and Saved Photos. The more pictures or other multimedia files that are on the Camera Roll, the longer a backup or restore will take.\nImprove backup and restore times by regularly importing the contents of your Camera Roll or Saved Photos, and then sync that content back to the iPhone.\n\n", "Q: How to auto join my hidden SSID home network from my iPhone on iOS5 Ever since upgrading to iOS 5 my iPhone(s) have problems auto joining my home wifi network.\nThey seem to auto join it for a few days and then it just stops working.

That works for a few days and then stops working again, if i bump the channel number in either direction it then works for a few more days.\nThis was a problem with my iPhone 4 after upgrading to iOS 5 and has been a problem with my iPhone 4s since purchase.\nMy (original) iPad has no issues and remains connected regardless of what I do to the router channel.\n\nA: Apple recommends not using hidden SSID's. There's no security in hiding them and as you have found out, it causes a problem with iOS devices discovering and joining the network after they come out of sleep mode.\n", "Q: When Updating or Downloading an App on my iPod touch, it Only Appears as \"Waiting\" I have an iPod touch 4th gen and the software is all up to date. I've had it for about 14 months, but the other day I was updating quite a few apps (maybe 16 or so) because I hadn't used my iPod touch for awhile. I don't know if this has anything to do with it but at the same time I was downloading some podcasts from the iTunes Store (which was also having some minor problems). \nI typed in the passcode then clicked \"ok\". It took a little longer then normal, but it closed the app store, went to home screen then the screen where all my apps are in files like usual. \nFive minutes later I realize that nothing has happened (all the updating apps are on \"waiting\") so I go back to the App Store and update it again. The same thing happens three more times with no luck. I turned my iPod touch off then on again and try uploading. Still nothing. \nA few days later I was trying to update again and then, after the tenth try and three restarts, it started updating. \nTwo days after that I try updating 3 more apps and it works fine after the second try. \nToday I was trying to download Magic Piano from Smule (and I recently got the Glee app so it doesn't seem like there's something wrong with my iPod touch and Smule) and it won't download at all. I've tried restarting, pausing, deleting and re-downloading everything and nothing seems to be working. Right now I have some TV shows downloading onto my iPod touch, is that the problem? Help!\n\nA: Requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*iExplorer (free) for both PC and Mac\n\n*You do not need a jailbroken device to do this\n\n\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug your iPod/iPhone/iPad into your computer. You don't need to let it sync\n\n*Open iExplore and let it load\n\n*Open the directory labeled \"Downloads\" (On jailbroken devices that should be \"/var/mobile/Media/Downloads\")\n\n*Delete all files in this folder*\n\n*Close iExplore and reboot your device\n\n\nA: This method worked perfectly for me when I had this problem. I was suprised how easy and obvious it is. \nAll you have to do is restart your iPod (shut it down) and it will not lose any data. Hold the sleep button and the home button together until the screen is blank and then the Apple logo appears. Then try downloading something and it will most likely work!\n", "Q: Mail app; how to change default preference of attachment to be at end of document? I always want to place a photo somewhere other than at the end of a document. How can I change the default setting so this is allowed without having to go to Preferences, attachments and un clicking the default setting?\n\nA: Drag and drop the photo into your message.  Wherever you let go, that's where it will be.  So if you let go in the middle of your message, it will be in the middle.\nEdit:  Here's another option:  There is a paper-clip button on the compose new message window, which you can use to attach a photo.  If you do that, the photo will appear wherever your cursor is at the time you click the button.  So put your cursor in the middle of your email, then click the paper-clip and select your photo.\n", "Q: How can I launch a daemon process as a specified user at boot without an interactive login? I'm trying to setup a TeamCity Build Agent on a Mac Mini Server running 10.7.3. I have successfully got it running and building but only if I login and launch the process manually. \nWe'd prefer to have the process kick off at startup which appears to be easily done by putting a plist file in the /Library/LaunchDaemon folder. Unfortunately this doesn't work for us as the process fires off as root rather than as our specified user. We really would prefer to keep things constrained to the user's folder and moreover need access to a keychain to handle the iOS code signing mechanics. Unfortunately, using ~/Library/LaunchAgents doesn't work as that seems to require someone visit the terminal and login -- this needs to kick off from boot and stay running when the user is logged out. \nIs there a way to launch a process as a specified user on boot?\n\nA: You can easily run as another user with sudo -u like so:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nUZER=jsmith\n\nsudo -u \"$UZER\" /path/to/program/you/want/to/run\n\nexit 0\n\nJust change 'jsmith' to the appropriate short user name, and then save that as a script somewhere, and call from /Library/LaunchDaemons\nRemember that all files in /Library/LaunchDaemons must be owned by root to be run.\n(I think this is what bmike was suggesting)\nAnother option\nHowever, I wrote up a HOWTO for making auto-login more secure:\nTerminally Geeky: use automatic login more securely\nThe executive summary is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on Automatic login\n\n*Put this launchd plist in ~/Library/LaunchAgents\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nWhat it does:\nAs soon as you login, launchd will throw you back to the login screen using:\n\"/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession\" -suspend\n\nNote that is all one long line.\nConsidering that someone with physical access to your computer has a lot of potential exploits, I consider this relatively safe, but of course everyone has to make their own determination. I run this in my small office, but my iMac is in my private office which I can lock when I'm not there.\nAlso note that automatic login doesn't work with FileVault 2.\n\nA: The easy way is to set that user to auto log in and then lock the screen with fast user switching enabled. Otherwise you will have to do the hard work of creating an admin level user and having your script or process launch itself with a specific user.\nProcesses launched before the user login session starts are functionally root and need to demote themselves if you don't want them running as root. Apple does this with the web server and the user _www and on the client side, some processes are running as users nobody, _spotlight and , _mdnsresponder.\n", "Q: Can I use a PC3-10600 memory on a MacBook with PC3-8500 slots? I have a MacBook (13-inch, Late 2009) with the default 2GB of RAM, I want to update it to 8GBs, but I only found this model of memory to buy.\nThe question is since the memory is more \"powerful\" than the slot it will work? Will I have any issues? If not, what should I buy? only PC3-10600?\n\nA: You should be able to use the faster RAM without a problem.  No guarantees when it comes to RAM compatibility that hasn't been vendor qualified (which is seldom an option) so make sure you buy from someone with a good return policy.\nYou might consider buying through somebody like OWC (macsales.com) that specializes in Mac parts.\n\nA: I recently upgraded my Mid-2010 13 inch MacbookPro 7,1 to 16 GB using cheaper PC3-10600 DDR3 modules.\nIt did involve taking a chance on a program called Thaiphoon Burner to modify the EEPROM on one of the modules so it could pretend to be PC3-8500. The OS would not boot otherwise. I would not recommend trying this unless you're comfortable with all the steps involved.\nAn alternative is to use one 8 GB PC3-10600 module along with a 4 GB PC3-8500 module for a total of 12 GB, but there would probably be a speed penalty from having mismatched module sizes.\nOWC has a blog post Certain 2010 MacBook, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini models join the ’16GB’ MaxRAM club going into more detail.\nThey list the following requirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*A Mac mini (Macmini4,1), MacBook (MacBook7,1), or 13” MacBook Pro (MacBookPro7,1) from 2010\n\n*OS X 10.7.5 or later\n\n*Latest EFI Update for your machine\n\nA: Good article explaining how to use Thaiphoon Burner to change RAM clocking speed. By default faster ram most likely will have an issues and the computer may not even start (depends on RAM setup)\nhttp://forum.notebookreview.com/alienware-13-m11x/576475-how-update-spd.html\nCAUTION:\nUSE THIS ON YOUR OWN RISK! YOU MAY DAMAGE YOUR RAM/NOTEBOOK!!\nI Use Thaiphoon Burner 7.X on my Windows 7 64 bit.\n(you need the \"full Version\" to be able to write the modified data to RAM!)\n1.)

Press \"Editor\" to open the timing editor\n4.)Choose the frequenz where you want to change the timings\nThe ratio FSB to RAM is 1:3.\nThe default FSB is 133mhz so the RAM is running @ 400 Mhz (you can not change this!) so i change the value (Min SDRAM cycle time) so the Clock frequenz is showing 400Mhz.\n\n5.) Choose the latency you want to use at 400Mhz\nChange the value \"Min CAS latency Time\" so that the \"DEF CAS\" is showing the Latency you want to use. ( in my case: CL7)\n\n6.) change the timings\nOf course you have to change all the other timings.\nWell - i use 7-7-7-20 and i changed the other values a little bit - maybe someone know how to calculate the other timings - i just raise them up a little bit.\n\n7.) Press next to choose what you want to do with your new config.\nI always update the Hex editor.\n\nAfter that i check the checksum (EEPROM - correct Checksum).\nNow you can write the timings to RAM and make a reebot.\nIMPORTANT:\n- After the first \"READ\" save your config in a file to have a backup!\n- DON'T ever change the CL over CL8! The Bios is not able to work with the RAM using CL9 or higher!\n- I don't know whether my timings are perfekt - but they work fine ;-)\n- When you \"killed\" a ram and the notebook will not come up anymore: use a working RAM, start your notebook and plugin the not working RAM while the System is running (ON YOUR OWN RISK!) it works fine - Thaiphoon Burner is able to work with this RAM an you can restore the timings from your backup.\nWhy to change the timings?\nThe Bios is using the RAM @400Mhz with the specific timings (6-6-6-18 in my case.)\nWhe I use an overclocked FSB from 166 Mhz, the RAM is working at 500Mhz (you overclocked your RAM very much!!!)\nSo you have to slow down the timings to get a stable work of the RAM.\n\nA: Since they use different clocking, there could be issues, up to the new RAM being inaccessible by the system.\nI also have a MBP (15\", 2010) which uses PC3-8500 RAM, and it has 8GB in it; I purchased the memory banks at Amazon.\n\nA: The easiest way to get the steady work of DDR3-1333 and higher DRAM modules with your Macbook is to derate the speed bin to DDR3-1066 since NVIDIA MCP79/MCP89 memory controller is not capable of operating at 667MHz. Thaiphoon Burner can do this work perfectly.\n", "Q: Mac Ports keeps on re-installing Perl, Python, etc Every time I want to install something, mac ports keeps on re-installing Perl, Python, etc. although the same packages are already installed on the system. Is there some setting to avoid this?\n\nA: What you are seeing there are most probably upgrades for your ports. MacPorts will automatically upgrade all dependencies before installing new ports. Check port outdated to see a list of available upgrades and sudo port upgrade outdated to install them.\nIt is usually recommended to let MacPorts upgrade dependencies before installing new ports to get the latest fixes. However, if you really need to install a port quickly, you can use sudo port -n install to avoid this behavior and just install the new port only.\n\nA: It also might be worth your while checking out Homebrew. Unlike MacPorts it tries to work with the unix software that comes with your Mac rather than installing alternative versions.\n", "Q: Configuring yahoo messenger on iChat Is it possible to configure Yahoo Messenger on iChat?

But I did not get any document or evidence to configure Yahoo Messenger. I do not know why? Is it possible to fix this problem??? I am talking about Mac OS X Lion.\n\nA: You will need to sign up for a Yahoo! account by going here. \nOnce you have done that, you can configure Yahoo Messenger in iChat by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iChat\n\n*Open iChat Preferences by going to the menu item iChat > Preferences or by hitting ⌘ + , on your keyboard\n\n*Go to Accounts\n\n*Click the + button\n\n*Select \"Yahoo\" from the drop down menu under Account Type:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Authenticate using your Yahoo account credentials\n\n*Enjoy using iChat with Yahoo.\n\n\nA: This method works for text chat. iChat claims to support video and SMS via Yahoo, but used the method above to configure Yahoo, and I got no option for video chat.

Basically, is there any way to trigger the native OS X spellcheck context menu using a keyboard shortcut. I know the command keys ⌘+: activates spellcheck, but what I'm trying to do is get the result of a right-click without taking my hands off the keyboard. Is there an OS X equivalent to emacs' flyspell-correct-word-before-point command.\n\nA: If you're on Lion, you can turn on iOS-style spelling corrections in System Preferences under Language and Text. I don't always have luck noticing or reacting to these corrections while typing, but moving back over the misspelled word with your cursor will bring up the iOS-style popup and you can select the correct spelling with the down arrow and Return.\nA similar question was asked on superuser, see Keyboard Shortcut to Right Click. To paraphrase that answer here: \n\n\n*\n\n*Use Cmd : to activate spellcheck\n\n*Focus the floating window with Ctrl F6. (You need \"Full Keyboard Access\" shortcuts enabled in System Preferences.

Whenever I wake my monitors, the iChat screen below pops up:\n\nWhen I let my Mac idle, iChat was NOT open. I never use iChat and would really like this dialog to go away permanently. I don't want to use iChat, period. And I certainly don't want to have to quit iChat every time I wake my monitors. iChat is not in my login items, all of the accounts have been removed or disabled, and I don't know of any other setting that might be causing this.\nI thought I had licked this problem before, in fact I was so proud of myself (after searching for a solution for hours) that I blogged about it.

We just want to link directly to one particular episode so I can be assured I'm gonna' download the right one.\nHow can this be done?\n\nA: This is how it would work on a Mac; I don't see a way of obtaining a podcast episode URL from within the built-in iTunes iPhone app.\n\n\n*\n\n*In the iTunes app, navigate to the podcast episode and copy the episode link by clicking the little triangle next to \"FREE\" in the right column:\n\n\n*When the link is opened on the Web, you can see what specific episode was linked to in two ways:  \n\n\n*It's slightly highlighted in the list (that is, until you start hovering the mouse over that list).\n\n*Part of the episode's name is in the URL:\n\n\nA: I don't think it is possible to obtain the link to a specific episode, either from the iTunes app on iOS where you can browse the store, or from the iOS music app after if has already been downloaded.\nOften a direct link to the episode is included in the show notes that are included, but the built in apps have scant support for allowing you to actually view these properly, they just overlay the text (or the top section of it) without giving you a way to interact with it.\nTo be honest, and I know you specifically asked not to suggest other apps, but given the above should hopefully be a suitable answer in it's own right I will do so anyway.  Try Instacast, it's a far superior app for both downloading/subscribing and actually listening to podcasts.

The iPod Touch is obsolete enough that most new apps won't run on iOS 3.1. Also, there is a growing number of apps that I own and use daily that have updates that the Touch can't run. \nI sync my Touch with iTunes to keep my podcast library up to date. My iPad syncs with iTunes via WiFi. \nI use several universal iPod/iPad apps. If I update one of these apps to a version that my Touch doesn't support (because the app now requires iOS 4+), the Touch loses that app. When I try to turn off app syncing for my Touch in iTunes, iTunes warns that it will delete apps and their data on the device. That's not what I want. \nHow can I sync my iPod Touch with iTunes to keep podcasts up to date, but keep the older versions of the apps around for the Touch and use the latest versions of the apps on my iPad?\n\nA: Thats a tough one, the only solution I can think of is to have two separate users accounts on the machine you run iTunes on.  Each account has its own iTunes file system and this includes the cache of applications, even though both user accounts may use the same iTunes account.\nIt's a bit of a hack, and not very elegant but here goes...\nYou would make a backup of your existing iTunes directory from within your profile and place it in a readable location for the other user account.\nLog into the new user account, start up iTunes so it initialises your new folder structure for iTunes under that account. Shut down iTunes and copy your existing backed up iTunes account data over the new.\nBarring file permissions changes, you should now have two users accounts on your machine that you can control the upgrade path for your applications on.\n\nA: I know this is an old thread but decided to post this in case it helps somebody.  I had deleted some apps from my old iPod (1st gen), and when I tried to add them again, they had been upgraded for my new device and were no longer compatible with the old one.  I managed to get them back and keep them using the following steps.  This is in iTunes 10.7.\n\n\n*\n\n*Removed newer versions of apps to a safe place, out of the Mobile Applications folder.\n\n*Copied older versions of apps into Mobile Applications.\n\n*Deleted library entries for those apps.  (I found it helpful to look at the Apps category in list view.)\n\n*Used Add To Library from the File menu to add the old versions of the apps back to the library.\n\n*Attached iPod and synced.  Apps were loaded without complaint.  Disconnected iPod.\n\n*Removed old apps and their library entries.  Put updated apps back in folder and added back to library.\n\n*Realized that at next sync, apps would be wiped.

Keep!\n\n*Synced iPod and disconnected.\n\n*Set preferences to allow automatic syncing again.\n\n\nBoth devices are syncing without any problem, and iPod has retained the apps.\n\nA: Have you considered not synching the iPad to the computer at all? With iOS 5, you don't have to sync to a computer anymore. You update the iPad apps directly and backup to iCloud.\nI realize this isn't really an answer to the question that you asked and may not be helpful in your case. Just thinking that it might something you hadn't considered.\n\nA: Regarding your comment of 'an obvious way to stop syncing', the answer to your problem is in iTunes' Preferences.\nOpen iTunes Preferences, click the 'Devices' section, and check the 'Prevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing automatically' option.\nIt will unfortunately affect both devices, iPad and iPod, but clicking a single button when you want to sync is a big preference of mine.\n\n", "Q: iPhone iCloud contacts and over the air sync As I understand, the \"over the air sync\" is different from iCloud sync (for the contacts). Is it the case?\nIs the over the air sync just a sync with my Mac itself? So it is just an cordless version of the iTunes sync?\n\nA: You are correct: the iCloud sync sends data to and from the iCloud servers, and the Wi-Fi sync sends data to and from your computer running iTunes.\n", "Q: I Can connect Mac OS Lion to Win 7 via cable but not via wireless...help! I have a macbook pro, and netgear n600 modem/router (DGND3700) and a win7 PC that is working nicely with homegroup networking.\nwhen I plug the macbook into the router via a network cable I can 'connect to server...' and get the the win7 shares just fine. but when I try whilst using wireless it refuses to connect.\nWhat should I tweak to make it work? I assume its a problem with the mac because other non-mac computers can see the shares on my win7 box just fine via wireless. \n\nA: When i connect on a 2.6Ghz range rather than 5Ghz it works. so its probably that the netgear router (or the macbook) is not supporting ipv6 properly on the 5Ghz range.\n", "Q: Share internet connection from a PC to an iPhone through the USB cable In the office where I'm working now, my network carrier has very poor reception, so my iPhone 4 cannot access the internet reliably.\nI have a pc running Windows XP SP3 that is connected to internet through LAN, and it does not have a wi-fi card.\nIs it possibile to share the PC connectivity to the iPhone through the USB cable?\n\nA: This works well for iOS 10 and macOS 10.12:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I share my iMac's internet to iPhone or iPad over USB??\n\n\nYou're not the first to ask this question. Searching with Google shows that it's been discussed here and here. \nUnfortunately, iOS 9 and earlier do not support what you're describing.\nYou mention that you don't have a wireless card but perhaps you can share your internet connection wirelessly, through an Ad-Hoc network. I think that's the best way to go, honestly.\nThis doesn't work for internet:\n\n[PC] --->--(USB)--->--> [iOS Device]\n\nBut this probably would, since the iOS device doesn't care, for the most part, where the WiFi is coming from:\n\n[PC] --->--(WiFi)--->--> [iOS Device]\n\nSo, you might consider grabbing a wireless card for your PC. Alternatively, a jailbroken iPhone might be able to get more mileage with a  USB cable than a vanilla one would.\n\nA: With the standard iOS Version: NO \nBut if your iPhone is jailbroken, this may/could work for you: Use PC Internet over IPhone via USB Cable\n\nA: Here’s how to set up a pc to work like a Mac for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I share my iMac's internet to iPhone or iPad over USB??\n\n\n*\n\n*plug laptop to ethernet cable (has internet)\n\n*create adhoc wireless network on laptop, call it mylaptop, give it open or wep security.

When would the overwriting occur on a 32GB iPhone? \n\nA: Text Messages are stored in a Database format, and not as individual files.  It's unlikely that they will ever be \"overwritten\" in the sense you ask, but may well remain in the database tables either forever, or until such regular purge mechanism clears them out on a schedule.\nDepending on your OS version, you may be able to open and inspect the files.  See this question for more details.\n", "Q: Discovering which PCMCIA Wifi card can work on OS X Leopard I've got an old PowerBook G4. I've installed Mac OS X Leopard on it. Now, i want to buy a PCMCIA wifi card for surfing internet. But I can't understand, which cards are compatible and which not. Information in internet is very old, and I found information only about OS X 10.4. Also, I've read, that all cards,based on broadcom chipset are compatible. For example, does Linksys WPC54G works with my computer?\n\nA: There is a list of such cards on Low End Mac up to 10.4\nBut I believe better way would be just to go to ebay for native Airport Extreme if your particular model is aluminum one.\nIf it is Titanium then CardBus is the way to go since original Airport 802.11b cards are rare, pricier and don't support WPA2.\nP.S. And I wouldn't recommend 10.5 on Titanium Powerbook \n", "Q: Why does iTunes continually reset the play count of select songs to zero? Many of the recent additions to my iTunes library, including songs that I have bought in the iTunes store and Amazon, keep having their play counts reset to zero. All are songs that I know I have listened to, and iTunes knows this as well; even though the play count has been reset, the \"last played\" field notes when I last listened to the song. This seemingly has only happened with songs I have added to my library after I installed iTunes Match. \nOne song in particular, for example, I purchased a week ago in the iTunes store. I listened to it 8 times and that play count appeared. A few days/syncs later, the play count was reset to 0. I listened to it a few more times, the play count then being 5, and after a few more days/syncs it was again reset to 0. The same thing happened again last night after I had listened to the song 5 times in a day (yes, the song is awesome).\nI've turned off iTunes Match, and have yet to test to see if this is the real solution. Apple's forums don't seem to have any solid information on this, aside from people just griping that it is happening. Is there any information on why this is happening? Is there a way to override it? Is there a way to restore all my missed play counts?\n\nA: This is an ongoing bug in iTunes Match. The few users that seem to have any success at all manually update by going to Store > Update iTunes Match. This may or may not work for you because it really is a bug. Play count updates also appear to be delayed by days for some users.\n", "Q: Is there a (free) graphical SSH file transfer client for Mac? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat's a good graphical SFTP utility for OS X? \n\nI'm looking for an SSH client that includes drag and drop file transfer functionality. I'm aware of CyberDuck, but it's a bit pricey. I found one or two other programs, and they're not free. I need it for my computer science class this semester. (I'm technically ok using the Terminal, but some of my Mac using classmates are not.) \n\nA: Apparently, I was wrong. Cyberduck is donation ware, so it will serve my purposes over the semester. \n\nA: If you feel guilty about not donating to Cyberduck even though you've found it useful, Fugu is the daddy of SFTP clients for OS X... completely free and open source. The stable versions are PPC only, but there's a pre-release Intel version available.\n\nA: FileZilla can also do full SFTP (FTP over SSH) and it's free.\nThe downside obviously is it's not a very pretty application under OSX.\n", "Q: Where are Microsoft Office for Mac My Templates stored? Where do Word for Mac and Powerpoint for Mac store user templates?\n\nA: According to this page, and confirmed by experiment, the path has changed for Office 2016.  It is now ~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content/Templates.  (This is what you see in the Finder: if you use Terminal the last two directories have \".localized\" appended to their name, which Finder evidently suppresses).\nBe aware that if you performed an upgrade of Office, you will still have the ~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/User Templates/My Templates directory, but Powerpoint, at least, won't look in that location.\n\nA: In the English version of Word and PowerPoint 2011, Templates are stored inside your Home folder in ~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/User Templates/My Templates. In other languages, the User Templates/My Templates part is localized (e.g. Benutzervorlagen/Eigene Vorlagen/ in German).\nThe User's Library folder is hidden in 10.7 and later, but you can go there by holding down option while clicking the Go menu in the Finder, then selecting Library.\n\nA: The location changes with newer Microsoft Office versions for Mac. The location for my MacBook Pro 2021, using Microsoft Office 365, matches that from TechnoCat's comment under Dave Mulligan's answer. /Users/[your_username]/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content/Templates][1].\n\nThe location is normally invisible, so you will need to reveal hidden files to find it. There's more than one way to do this. The easiest is simultaneously pressing cmd + shift + .. Using Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles true\nkillall Finder\n\nAnd then to hide the files again:\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles false\nkillall Finder\n\n", "Q: Mask editing for Pages When trying to edit the mask, I am stuck with this blue dot that only rounds the corners of the mask and I can't get rid of it. How do I go about editing the mask borders?\n\nA: You should also see the white squares defining the borders of the mask. Those are the handles for resizing borders.

Monetarily, I have worked the cost to be around £100 which is not too bad?\nI would appreciate your feedback on the following especially if you have done this or similar\n\n\n*\n\n*ease of replacing the RAM\n\n*ease of replacing the HDD\n\n*whether 8gb does indeed work (well)\n\n*whether SSDs do work as well as benchmarks and hype suggest (in this context)\n\n*any problems that can be incurred by doing this (I'm not to concerned re. void waranties more breaking hardware)\n\n*anything I need to take in to consideration that I possibly am not\n\n\nThe hardware I am looking at getting is Corsair CMSA8GX3M2A1066C7 and Crucial CT064M4 though I may go for the slightly cheaper Vertex 2, any comments on these choices would be much appreciated also.\nIf anyone from the UK has had experience with getting a second HDD 'dock' to replace the optical drive with a second HDD/SSD then any infromation surrounding this (both obtaining and installing - though the latter I guess is regionally unspecific) would also be very helpful.\n\nA: The 2009 and earlier model Mac Mini all lack the black small round access port, so are much easier to get at the hard drive than the newer thin \"unibody\" Mac Mini computers.\nI really like RamJet for checking which machines can run more ram than Apple places in their \"what we support at the time the hardware is released\" manuals. They only sell to Macs, so really have to work hard to mix up your models or get the wrong ram. Where you buy is certainly up for debate, but the RamJet tools are the nicest I've seen.\nAs to your hard drive exchange - the SSD will replace the HDD easily. Putting a second drive will be less easy as I'm not aware of a mounting kit for the optical drive attachment in that class of Mac Mini. Do your homework well or get a good return policy if you find out your drive doesn't work when connected to the optical drive SATA connection.\n\nA: Replacing the RAM and the hard-drive on this Mac Mini is a moderate to challenging task, check out iFix's Guides for RAM and Hard Drive install guides.\nAnd 1 GB is not enough ram, to do development work with. The 8GB should provide a night and day difference just itself, since its going to stop your mac from paging out to the slow 2.5\" laptop disk drive. \nWith that said, the SSD drive should also provide a dramatic speed increase too. Although, one consideration with SSD drives is that its performance might degrade over time so plan on being able to make time to Recondition[...] [your] solid state drive (SSD). \nI would also recommend keeping your user directory on an external drive (firewire 800 will give you the best speed) to avoid the space limitations of moving to a 64GB drive. This is suggesting a popular configuration of using a SSD for just the OS and applications and a regular hard drive to store all your files see Installing a solid state drive (SSD) and SSD and Hard Drive Combo: How and Why for some guidance . \nAs for ram make sure to get it from somewhere that has a good lifetime warranty and return policy as well as a good price.\nOther than that take your time and have fun, should be a nice speed improvement for you when your all completed.\n", "Q: How do I get the Mail app to use its configuration settings? The Mail app is configured to send the downloaded attachments to my downloads folder, yet it keeps burying my downloaded attachments in my library. I've tried resetting the download location in the app settings several times but can't get it to save to the correct location.\n\nA: What I did is quit Mail and make a shortcut of the Mail Downloads in Library to where I want it in the Downloads folder, from there I can just delete what I don't want and maintain the folder to my liking.\n\nA: thanks to @ismail for the suggestion that lead me to my final answer. So at the suggestion of Timothy the best answer I could come to is to create an Automater Folder Action that will move files from the Mail Downloads folder to the User Downloads Folder.\nTo do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a Folder Action\n\n*Add an action for \"Get Specified Finder Items action\" and target the Mail Downloads folder\n\n*Add an action of \"Get Folder Contents\" (with repeat for each subfolder checked)\n\n*Add the \"Move Finder Items\" action and specify the downloads folder.\n\n*Save the Finder Action with a relevant name (I named mine Mail Download Mover)\n\n*Now go find the Mail Downloads folder in your User Library folder.\n\n*Right click the Mail Downloads folder and select \"Set Folder Action\"\n\n\nThis will move all your \"downloaded\" mail attachments directly to the download folder (usually it takes a second or 2 for the automater to kick in)\nI tested this using a zip file I emailed myself. After double clicking the zip file it went to the mail downloads folder and unzipped there. Then both items were moved to my downloads folder.\n\nA: Mail assumes you don't want to automatically download every attachment that's sent to you. That makes sense, as otherwise you'd end up with lots of emoticons and company banners in your downloads folder. To save one to Downloads, right-click (or ctrl-click) the attachment you want to download and select \"Save to Downloads folder\" or \"Save attachment…\". This will do what you want.\n", "Q: How do I open images in Preview at full size? Is there a way I can get Preview to open images in Actual Size by default and not have it fit to screen?

You would think that after a while it would finish indexing it and cause no problem, so that may not be the issue here.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: It could be that you have open applications using files on your flash disk. \nYou could try running the terminal command \"lsof /Volumes/_NAME_OF_FLASH_DISK_HERE\" and if you see an output, that means you have open/active files on your flash disk.\nYou need to close those and you can now eject.\nHope this helps,\nIsmael Casimpan\n", "Q: How do I prevent widgets from moving around on the dashboard?

The CD is UDF formatted and I have read the following on another site: \n\nThe Mac simply doesn't understand the UDF format which is widely used\n  by many Windows and Linux computers, along with various consumer DVD\n  burners, video cameras and other devices. OS X gets confused when\n  reading files, thinking they have read-only privileges or locked files\n  or different owners, depending on what software was used to write the\n  disc.

I don't want to have to modify permissions everytime files are copied.\n\nA: One way would be to copy the files from the command line using rsync: It supports a flag --chmod, so you can say, e.g.,\nrsync -a --chmod=u+w /Volumes/name-of-the-CD/ /wherever/\n\nto turn on writable flag for the user (you).

I have a Mid-2011 MacBook Air (13\"). Recently, the 45 watt MagSafe Adapter grew extremely hot (painful to touch) and smelled slightly singed while I was using the machine and plugged into the wall. It appears to still work.\nI am using the extender cord, not the duck-head plug, and I live in the United States.\nWhat is a normal high temperature for the MagSafe to reach? At what point do I visit my friendly local Genius Bar?\n\nA: Painful to the touch - especially when the device hasn't been that hot since day one - is a great time to unplug and take your rig (computer and power adapter) in to have things checked out. You might power off everything and try hooking just the shut down mac and see if drawing less current helps, but keep a very close eye on things and don't leave it plugged in just in case if you have any concerns.\nI've got an 85W adapter that started buzzing faintly and now it's getting hot as well so I've stopped using it until I can have things checked out.\nAlso, ambient temperature is a big factor. Since things are air cooled, if you are 85 degrees F then the charger can't dissipate heat as well as if you were in a server room cooled to 62 degrees or so. \n", "Q: Why do my applications keep crashing on Lion 10.7.3? Once every couple of days an application crashes on my MacBook Pro with Lion (10.7.3).

Not all of my photos go to Photo Stream, some still go to my Camera Roll.  I'm trying to get them on my Photo Stream so they will be on iCloud.\nWith 30 photos on my camera, 10 in stream, I took 6 photos.  2 appeared in stream, 4 did not.  Some of my subsequent photos also appeared in the stream, but not all.  This is arbitrary behavior by the program.  How to fix?  Assume ios 7.0. \n\nA: Any photos that exist in the Camera Roll that didn't come from the device itself had to come from another device. The primary method for getting these pictures into iCloud's 1000 picture buffer is to enroll that other device into iCloud.\nYou have one case of a picture that was taken either more than 30 days ago or 1000 pictures ago or you deleted your entire Photo Stream and want to start over. In this case, you may need to sync those photos to a computer or another device using the Camera Connecton Kit to inject them into your current Photo Stream.\n\nA: You can go to any picture in your Camera Roll, select it and then copy it by pressing the Home button and the Sleep button. This will make a screenshot of the picture in your Camera Roll and send that up to iCloud. \nWith iOS 6 you can select photos from your camera roll and share them to a personal photo stream to yourself. \n\nA: It's possible the photos you are looking for are in the stream, but just ordered differently than you expected. For example on my iphone I imported some images from mail. Because the pictures had been taken a while ago they were at the top of the stream instead of the bottom, where I expected them to be. The stream orders them by date taken, where as the camera roll orders them by date imported. \n\nA: From iPhoto or Aperture, copy the photo you want or drag into the Photostream folder on the sidebar\n", "Q: How to get Gmail priority inbox sections on Mail? I use Google priority inbox so I've a Starred section, Important, and Everything else as separate sections on the web gmail. \nNow, I just set up my \"Mail\" on Mac OS X (using IMAP) but Mail will just show 1 inbox, is there a way to prioritize the mails like the web version of gmail.\n\nA: In Mail.app 9.3 (and possibly earler versions—I've never tried) this can now be done fairly easily—more or less, anyway:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the mailbox list, beside \"Smart Mailboxes\", click \"Show\" then click \"+\" to create a new smart mailbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n*For \"Important\", select messages that match all of the criteria \"Message is in mailbox Inbox\" and \"Message is in mailbox Important\".\n\n\n\n\n\n*For \"Starred\", create a new smart mailbox that matches all of \"Message is in mailbox Inbox\", \"Message is not in mailbox Important\" and \"Message is flagged\":\n\n\n\n\n\n*…or, if you're like me and instead have Gmail show \"All Starred\", you can use the \"Flagged\" mailbox.  This isn't quite the same as the (misnamed) \"All Starred\" section of Gmail's Priority Inbox view, which excludes starred items already shown in any of the sections further up the page (notably: threads which are both important and starred), so if you want to be really pedantic, create a new smart mailbox that matches \"Message is Flagged\" and \"Message is not in mailbox Important\" (and make sure that's the smart Important mailbox; select the regular Important mailbox and you'll unintentionally exclude important starred messages not in the inbox!)\n\n\n\n\n\n*For \"Everything Else\", create a new smart mailbox that matches all of \"Message is in mailbox Inbox\", \"Message is not in mailbox Important\" and \"Message is not in mailbox Starred\":\n\n\n\n\n\n*Finally, drag these new smart mailboxes to the favourites bar at the top of the window:\n\n\n\nCaveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mail.app will only show one of these mailboxes at a time, whereas Gmail's smart inbox will show up to four different sections all at the same time.\n\n*Because Gmail keeps track of labels and important status per-message (even though they are displayed as if they apply to the whole thread), you will occasionally see threads appearing in more than one of these smart mailboxes at the same time.\n\n*No guarantees about what happens to important status when you start dragging messages to other mailboxes!\n\n\nA: The folders in Gmail are not really folders when accessed in most IMAP clients. They are not \"children\" of the main inbox. In Mail, you should see a Gmail section on the left well below the Inbox, Sent, Trash, Jun, Reminders, Smart Mailboxes, and On My Mac. \nThere you should see the full hierarchy of the folders that exist in the Gmail web interface. \n\nA: You can see them in the Gmail section on the left sidebar. To show the left sidebar, click the \"Show\" button on the top left.\n\n", "Q: Can my Thunderbolt Macbook Air drive my Mini DisplayPort iMac as an external display? I've run an iMac as an external display for a Mac laptop before, but am wondering if my new setup can work like that. I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*2011 Macbook Air with Thunderbolt\n\n*2009 iMac with Mini DisplayPort\n\n*mini DisplayPort cable\n\n\nCan I drive my iMac from my laptop? I've had no success so far, despite manually putting my iMac in Target Display Mode using cmd-F2. I can get the setup to the point where both screens turn blue (as expected) but then my iMac reverts to showing the iMac's desktop, not that of the laptop.\n\nA: According to this source, this should work. This other source confirms it. These are the troubleshooting steps I would try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run all software updates on both the iMac and MacBook Air. A lot of times there are firmware updates that address issues like this.\n\n*Open System Preferences > Displays and click Detect Displays.\n\n*Reset the PRAM on both the iMac and the MacBook Air by restarting the computer and holding ⌘+⌥+P+R on boot but until you hear the POST chime twice. Then you can let go and boot normally. Be sure to do this on both machines.\nTry going through these steps and let me know if you're able to resolve the issue. \n\nA: Yep, this should work no problems at all. Here is the relevant support article from Apple on the steps to take.\nActually, no. It looks like Macs with Thunderbolt will only use Target Display Mode with other Thunderbolt equipped Macs. This is according to Macworld and also TUAW\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Make ls command sort by file type (e.g. directories and file extension) How do I make ls sort by file type (e.g. directories first and then by file extension)? The answers suggested in (Super User) Make ls sort by file type result in unknown option errors from ls.\n\nA: As you've found out, the Darwin version of the ls command doesn't support the -X | --sort=extension option. This option is unique to the GNU version of ls.\nYou can obtain the GNU version of ls for your system. The easiest way to do this is through the Homebrew package manager and porting system. With Homebrew installed do:\nbrew install coreutils\n\nto add the GNU Core Utilities package to your system. All the utilities will be prefixed with g so they don't collide with the default Darwin utils that OS X ships with.\nWith the GNU Core Utilites installed you can now do:\ngls -X\n\nAnd you'll see the output sorted as you desire.\nIf you want to use the GNU Core Utils instead of the utilities that come with OS X you can put the following line in your ~/.bashrc file:\nsource /usr/local/Cellar/coreutils/8.14/aliases\n\nAnd you won't need to use the g prefix on the commands any more. I'll say this isn't an entirely safe thing to do as some of the GNU utils differ from the bash built-ins and Darwin tools in how they behave, enough so that they might screw up other things in your shell session. So do this with caution.\n\nA: Based on an answer in the linked Super User article:\nls -l |sort -d -k 1.1,1.1r -k 9 | cut -c 50-\n\nIf you want to see the whole output of ls -l, just leave out the cut part.\n", "Q: Why can't ripped movies import to into iTunes on Windows XP when they work on Mac? I am unable to copy movies or videos into my iTunes library. I have had the concerned videos converted using Handbrake (version ??) with Apple presets but still when I try drag and drop to iTunes (10.1 on Windows XP) it shows no error (like \"cannot be played\" etc) and neither does it show up on the list.\nI can copy songs/ebooks/apps got a problem with video only.\nSo I updated to iTunes v 10.5.3 still can't drag drop video/movies. I even tried adding the files to the Automatically add to iTunes folder (as suggested in one of the comments) but got a Not Added folder. The files work when copied to the library on a friend's, so I can't tell if the problem is iTunes or Windows XP or my computer.\nAm I missing something?\n\nA: I have been facing the same problem with iTunes (both 10.5 and 11). You need to upgrade to iTunes version 10.5 or 11, and you would need Quick Time to play older media or videos.  \n", "Q: How can I report security vulnerabilities for open source OSX applications? In the event of finding a security vulnerability in the Linux world, the procedure involved would be to report the vulnerability...\n\n\n*\n\n*...to the developers or the maintainers of the package in a particular operating system.\n\n*...to the security team of that particular operating system.\n\n\nThen patches are made and CVE's are released.\nI'm curious about how does open source vulnerability reporting work in the OSX world? Do the developers release CVE's if a security issue is brought to their notice?\n\nA: You can contact Apple about this at product-security@apple.com (or you can open a Radar report if you're a developer), or you contact the maintainer of the package.\nOften the mail addresses can be found in the README (or AUTHORS) of the source code, or on the project's website.\nYes - both Apple (specifically) and the open source developers (in general) do reference CVE in patch and security emails and participate using that mechanism for tracking reported vulnerabilities.\n\nA: Apples official security posture is Apple Product Security.\nBut I would say that your best bet would be to submit vulnerabilities via the Apple Bug Reporter and their  product-security  email address . Additionally, if the part with the vulnerability is an open-source project, you should also notify the open source project as well. \n\nA: The procedure for reporting security vulnerabilities varies but the place to report would be directly to the open source project.  If the application is hosted in the app store then you could report directly to Apple.\n", "Q: Getting list of Apps instaleld on my iPad from iTunes Is there an easy way to get the screens of my apps and list of their names from the iTunes App management tab? I would like to post them on my website. \n\nA: I assume you mean from the App tab for your iPad within iTunes desktop app, that allows you to select which apps to sync, and re-order your home screens in.\nIf this is the case, then no.  To start with, the sort options are only for Name/Kind/Category/Date/Size, so there is no way to separate between installed and not installed.  Even if there is, there is no way to cut that information in any way.\nThird party tools like Phoneview and such may be able to provide a directory listing of installed apps which you can then manipulate to use on your website, but I don't use any so I will just throw it out in case it jogs anyone else's memory.\nThe only simple way to share, is to either take screen grabs of the iTunes windows to just screenshot (hold HOME and tap POWER) your whole iPad.  Or type them up...\n", "Q: Edit phone number in phone app Is there a way to edit a manually dialed phone number before re-dialling? Occasionally I have a typo in the number or forgot to add the country code prefix. \nThe only ways to handle this I know so far is \n\n\n*\n\n*write down the number and re-dial, or\n\n*copy the complete number, paste into a notes/text app, edit there, copy again and paste into the phone app. \n\n\nNot exactly user friendly.\n\nA: I'm afraid you are correct in your assumption, once a number has been typed and a call initiated, it is not able to be edited within the phone app directly, and needs to be either sent to a new contact where you can then amend the number, or cut/paste elsewhere to allow you to make changes.\n\nA: I found that using VoIP apps, you can edit a number after copy/pasting into the calling/dialing field, but you cannot do this with the native iPhone app.\n", "Q: How can I find out how much toner is left in my printer, which is connected to an Airport Express via USB? My Samsung ML-2850D printer is connected via USB to an Airport Express. I print to it from my Mac over WiFi. I want to check how much toner is left, so I know if I need to purchase a new cartridge soon. However, when I check the Supply Levels via system preferences, it says \"Information Not Available.\" What is the best way to reliably find out how much toner is left?\n\nA: Attaching a printer using Airport does not provide the same capabilities as attaching through USB, and one of the things that will not work is querying the printer for paper/ink levels etc.\nWhen you have the printer attached locally, the driver has the ability to talk over USB for lots of things, including these services, reading from a card reader that may be on the printer etc.  Once the printer is made wireless, these facilities are lost, and it effectively just becomes a dumb queue that you can drop a print into.  About the only feedback it can give is if the printer is offline or not.  If your printer is multifunction, you'll likewise lose the scanning/fax stuff also.\nSo unfortunately the only way is to hit up the printer direct, walk on over there and take a peek.\n", "Q: How to check installed OS X version from the command-line on each partition? I'm managing a lot of Macs and each machines has several partitions with different OS versions.\nI would like to create a script that I could run to do an inventory of all partitions of all machines and take note what OS is installed on each partition.\nOn the active partition, it would be easy to get it via the sw_vers command. But what about on a different partition?\n\nA: The following command will give you the OS X version installed on  volumeName:\ndefaults read /Volumes/volumeName/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion ProductVersion\n\nTo get a list of each volume's OS version, you need a simple script that will get a list of volumes, search each one for the SystemVersion.plist, and report any that are found.\nI found a script on on Mac OS X Hints, by Hal Itosis, that does just that (reposted below for convenience).\n#!/bin/bash -\nPATH=/bin:/usr/bin\nexport PATH\nIFS=$'\\n'\n\nvList=$(df -l | sed '1d;s:^.*%[[:space:]]*::')\nsPath=$(find -x /Volumes -maxdepth 1 -type l -not -inum 2)\npFile=/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion\n\nSysVers ()\n{\n   if [ -e \"${1}${pFile}.plist\" ]; then\n      n=\"$1\"; if [ \"$1\" = '/' ]; then n=\"$sPath\"; fi\n      x=`defaults read ${1}${pFile} ProductVersion`\n      b=`defaults read ${1}${pFile} ProductBuildVersion`\n      printf '%-16s %-8s %-8s\\n' \"${n##/*/}\" \"$x\" \"($b)\"\n   fi\n}\n\nif [ $# -eq 0 ]; then for v in $vList; do SysVers \"$v\"; done\nelse while [ $# -gt 0 ]; do SysVers \"$1\"; shift; done; fi\nexit\n\n\nA: You can use the diskutil command in terminal, which roughly speaking provides the ability to script up and perform the same actions as you can in the GUI version.\nUsing this it is possible to create a script that trawls for the info you need, but you have to be careful in specifying which disks you look at - if you do a blanket check on all disks, you will get disk images and all sorts included if you are not careful, plus you will end up with the recovery partitions and so on etc.\nAlso, the disk utility only provides the partition format, although that gives you a hint on what you can subsequently search on, i.e. look for a file called \"mach_kernel\" and chances are it's got OS X on it, it's it's got a \"/windows\" directory...etc etc, even then you will find partitions that are formatted on Mac or Win formats with no OS installed, so all in all not a trivial task.  If you know where the OSX/Windows installer logs are you may be able to insert such logic as to pull out a service pack level, or a patch level etc, but I can't find out how to do that just yet.\nDans-iMac:~ stuffe$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *640.1 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            639.3 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        *18.7 MB    disk1\n   1:        Apple_partition_map                         32.3 KB    disk1s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS SMARTReporter           18.7 MB    disk1s2\nDans-iMac:~ stuffe$ diskutil info disk0s2\n   Device Identifier:        disk0s2\n   Device Node:              /dev/disk0s2\n   Part of Whole:            disk0\n   Device / Media Name:      Customer\n\n   Volume Name:              Macintosh HD\n   Escaped with Unicode:     Macintosh%FF%FE%20%00HD\n\n   Mounted:                  Yes\n   Mount Point:              /\n   Escaped with Unicode:     /\n\n   File System Personality:  Journaled HFS+\n   Type (Bundle):            hfs\n   Name (User Visible):      Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\n   Journal:                  Journal size 49152 KB at offset 0x129d000\n   Owners:                   Enabled\n\n   Partition Type:           Apple_HFS\n   OS Can Be Installed:      Yes\n   Media Type:               Generic\n   Protocol:                 SATA\n   SMART Status:             Verified\n   Volume UUID:              7B3DEC51-1C86-37B5-95CE-888AE0EBD610\n\n   Total Size:               639.3 GB (639275270144 Bytes) (exactly 1248584512 512-Byte-Blocks)\n   Volume Free Space:        343.5 GB (343520002048 Bytes) (exactly 670937504 512-Byte-Blocks)\n   Device Block Size:        512 Bytes\n\n   Read-Only Media:          No\n   Read-Only Volume:         No\n   Ejectable:                No\n\n   Whole:                    No\n   Internal:                 Yes\n   Solid State:              No\n\nDans-iMac:~ stuffe$ mountpoint=`diskutil info disk0s2 | grep \"Mount Point\" | awk '{print $3}'`\nDans-iMac:~ stuffe$ ls -l $mountpoint | grep -E \"mach_kernel|windows\"\n-rw-r--r--@  1 root  wheel  15565404 10 Aug  2011 mach_kernel\nDans-iMac:~ stuffe$ \n\nPutting all this together in a suitable loop that identifies all the disks you are interested in, removing disk images USB sticks etc, and setting to either run remotely via SSH or whatever....is left as an exercise for the interested...\n\nA: Here is sample one-liner which gets the version info from SystemVersion.plist:\nex -s +'%s/<[^>].\\{-}>//ge' +'%s/\\s\\+//e' +'%norm J' +'g/^$/d' +%p +q! /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist\n\nYou may use head, tail or awk for further parsing, for example to get ProductVersion, try adding:\n| grep ^ProductVersion | cut -d' ' -f2\n\n\nHere is the alternative approach:\negrep \"<string|key>\" /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist | paste - - \n\n", "Q: Import iCal data from other mac I need to consolidate two iCal installations: the data from my old laptop should be merged into my new laptop’s iCal data.\nI tried exporting the old iCal data and importing it on the new laptop.

I've noticed that downloading apps continue to download in the background as well as when the iPad is locked. Is there a speed decrease in either of these situations (assuming the foreground app isn't using network)?\n\nA: \"Background\" is a confusing term, I don't think Apple refer to it at all, but prefer to use \"Multitasking\" and \"Fast App Switching\".  As introduced in iOS4, there are a limited number of functions that can maintain running when it is not the foremost app:\naudio / VoIP / GPS & location / push notifications / local notifications / task completion / fast app switching\nWhen you download stuff, say a podcast etc, you are really using the \"task completion\" service, where the program is allowed to continue running while a download completes, or even an upload etc.  This is limited to (I think) 10 minutes, and really is a request for more time.  Some apps game the system, particularly twitter style apps, by staying running and requesting 10 minutes of task completion time even through they don't have a specific task in hand, and just want to still be there when you flip back (hopefully in less than 10 minutes)...\nAs such, and of these 7 services are afford the same system priority as any other foreground task, so the only thing that should impact on a \"background\" download, is either a) the 10 minute slot running out, or b) the foreground app sharing the connection to do it's own thing.\nAs when you flip back, it will (if it supports the Fast App Switching feature) continue to download anyway, even if the 10 minutes have passed, it may well still have got 10 minutes of extra download, but with more to go.  This can make it look as though it has been downloading slowly in the background, when in reality it's been going full speed for 10 minutes, and then stopped until you switched back.\n", "Q: How do I batch convert a lot of .doc file to .html? I have some archive documents in .doc format, and I want to convert them to a searchable data base. I know that .pdf is searchable, but PC users seem to find .html documents more easily searchable ( I don't understand this).\nHow can I do this conversion, preferably as a batch conversion?\n\nA: Open terminal and navigate (cd) to the directory containing the .doc files and run the following:\nfor i in *.doc; do\ntextutil -convert html $i;\ndone\n\nI am using zsh so not sure if that would execute right in default bash shell. However, you can always invoke zsh for this purpose by just typing zsh at the prompt and hitting enter. The textutil command line has many options and capabilities. Just type textutil to see the options or look up the manual pages.\nOr:\ntextutil -convert html *.doc\n\nThat also does the trick in default shell settings from within the directory containing the .doc files.\n", "Q: How to omit apps from external drives in \"Open With\" menu? I maintain a SuperDuper! clone of my primary boot drive for backup purposes. When it's mounted, Finder's \"Open With\" menu shows duplicate applications.

However, it's not related to external backup drives and its answer -- rebuilding the LaunchServices database -- does not solve my problem.\n\nA: You can prevent the applications on your external drive from appearing in the Open With… menu by preventing Spotlight from indexing the drive.\nTo do this navigate to System Preferences > Spotlight. Select the Privacy tab and add your external drive to the list. Mutineer in the screenshot below is my SuperDuper clone drive.\n\nUpdate:\nMy best recollection is that this was all I did to solve the problem, but if the problem persists, two additional steps may be necessary:\n\nMake Launch Services reload the list of available apps with the command /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -all local,system,user. As apps on the second drive are not available via Spotlight anymore, the new database will only contain those on your main drive.\nRestart Finder to rebuild its Open With context menu (Option-right click on its Dock icon to get the restart option, or do killall Finder in Terminal).\n\nCredit to @kopischke for providing this concise answer on SuperUser.\nIf you want to avoid the terminal incantations, you can use Onyx to rebuild the spotlight index and launch services database.\n", "Q: What's the safest, cleanest way to jailbreak my iPad 1?

It's not hard to do, plus it has a lot of other tools in it that can help if you mess up. The link to the official download and a quick tutorial can be found here. You'll need to upgrade to iOS 5.0.1 beforehand.\n\nA: I haven't used it myself, but this came to light after a quick Google search.

How do I detect failed remote login attempt on my MacBook Pro and how do I block them? My MacBook Pro is on a network with built-in firewall, if that's relevant.\n\nA: Login attempts are logged in the file /var/log/secure.log, but there's a lot of other entries in the file also. You could search for lines containing the phrase \"Failed to authenticate user\" to narrow down the failed login attempts.\nIn Mac OS X, by default, telnet and rlogin are not enabled at all. As far as ssh is concerned, it can be turned off and on using System Preferences. If you deselect \"Remote login\" then it should not be possible to ssh into your computer.\n\n", "Q: Internet connectivity on 3g iPad when on a non-internet-connected wifi Imagine the following scenario, which I am proposing to a client for their service technicians' trucks.\nI have a very small wireless LAN that exists only for the purpose of providing print services for iOS devices (using a Lantronix xPrintServer, a portable WiFi router, and a mobile printer, all wired into the truck's electrical system). \nI have an iPad that is connected to the WiFi in the truck, and also has 3G service.\nOn that iPad, I go to check my email. What happens? Does it try to connect to the mail server over WiFi and fail? Or does it know it can't route that way and use the 3G instead?\n\nA: When connected to both Wi-Fi and 3G, you have two IP addresses. One handed out by DHCP on your portable Wi-Fi network and one from AT&T (or Verizon, as may be the case). \nTo my knowledge and from my experience, your iPad will use the IP address obtained by Wi-Fi first, and then 3G. So if you're connected to a Wi-Fi network that doesn't have internet connectivity, the email address you're trying to check has nowhere to go since you don't have internet service connected to your portable Wi-Fi network. \nUnfortunately, this means that in order to check your email, you'll have to disconnect from the portable Wi-Fi network, allowing the 3G IP address to become active.\n\nA: I have a similar setup in this question, but I sort it by turning off the DHCP Gateway on my router. When a device attaches it knows it's not going to get internet access from the Wifi so it should fall back to using 3G.\n", "Q: How to disable automatic wifi connection? When OSX already knows an wifi network it auto connects to it, but when it doesn't know the wifi network it will auto connect depending of the setting of the \"ask to join\" toggle setting in system preferences.\nHow do you force OSX to ask to join for every wifi network, whether it is known or not?  I don't want OSX to ever connect automatically.\n\nA: The only way to stop from automatically joining a preferred, or known, wi-fi network, is to not store the password for that network and type it in each time without clicking the \"save password\" button.\nAs soon as you save the password the network will be added to the preferred list even if the remember networks button isn't selected, and it will connect to it automatically (or rather it will connect to the first one on the list that is finds in the order in which you have them listed).\n\nA: In System Preferences | Network Preferences, click the Advanced button. On the Airport tab (should already be selected) of the dialog that comes up, untick \"Remember networks this computer has joined\".  In the \"Preferred Networks:\" box above it, select all of the known networks and delete them.  You should have a naive WiFi after that.\n\nA: Hold down Option key while clicking on the wifi icon in your menu bar.  Then select \"Disconnect \" - I'm using Mavericks.  Not sure what version this was introduced into.\n\nA: Turn off the wifi til you are ready to go online. A top of your screen you see the little airport symbol..click on it and there is the option to turn off the wifi\n\nA: Currently I have achieved this with my keychain settings and some wifi network settings in Mavericks.

I've got a MacBook Pro connected to an external display. Right now the notifications come through on on the primary display (MacBook Pro built in display) and not the external display. I know I can change this so that it shows on the secondary display but not the primary, but I want the notifications to show on displays. Is there a way to do this?\nThanks.\n\nA: Currently there is no way to accomplish this. The Growl mailing lists have discussed allowing Growl to always place the notification on the display that you have a window focused in.\nFor example, you have 3 displays, oriented in a horizontal line, and you're doing some file management on the far-left display and web browsing on the far right. If Finder has focus, the notification will be shown on the far-left display, if Safari/Chrome/Firefox/$BROWSER has focus, the notification will be shown on the far-right display.\nBut this feature has not yet been implemented, so you are limited to explicitly configuring Growl to send notifications to a single display.\nThis feature has been written up on their Google Code Project page, so you can star the issue in order to receive further notifications.\nNote that you can star it on an issue detail page by clicking the star outline to the left of the title \"Issue 122: [...]\", or at the bottom of the page just above the comment box. After clicking the star in either location, it will turn yellow and have a thicker blue outline, that means you've subscribed, and in essence, \"voted\" for the feature.\n", "Q: External monitor has wrong resolution I have a 23' external monitor (through VGA) which always worked at 1440x900 and looked amazing.

From time to time, retailers will discount iTunes Store Gift Cards and I'm tempted to stock up since discounts are enticing ways to shop. It appears that Apple has three sorts of gift cards available in the US. I am interested in the usually colorful or music related one.  \nOriginally, these cards only worked to buy music from the iTunes Store, but now my Apple ID works with several other store fronts in addition to the expected iTunes music store on iOS, Mac and Windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*iBookstore on iOS\n\n*iCloud to buy additional storage space annually\n\n*iTunes match annual subscription service\n\n*App Store on iOS\n\n*App Store on Mac OS\n\n*Apple Store app on iOS for ordering product online or for pickup in Apple Retail Stores.\n\n*Apple Store on the internet at http://store.apple.com\nWhich of these will accept a US purchased credit from a physical or electronic iTunes Store Gift Card if your Apple ID has a US billing address? Which of these will not be able to spend credit redeemed from the iTunes gift card. I do know that the Apple Store gift cards are accepted at the Apple Retail stores, but I've never seen them discounted or available anywhere but from Apple Retail.\n\nA: The front side is actually irrelevant for the card. If you buy any iTunes gift card for and with US dollars, you can redeem it with any US Apple ID.\nIt will at least work with the Music store, iOS App Store, Mac App Store, and iBookstore.\n(I've been using those cards ever since, since I don't have a credit card.)\nYou can use up to 8 Apple Gift cards (not iTunes Gift cards) at once to pay for your purchase at an Apple Retail Store, according to the the Apple website. (I don't know about the Apple Store app or the online store, since I don't live in the US.)\n\nA: You can use redeemed value from an iTunes gift card to buy from the following stores:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes music, movie and TV stores for iOS, Windows and Mac\n\n*iBookstore on iOS\n\n*App Store on iOS\n\n*App Store on Mac OS\n\nThe only gift cards that are accepted at an Apple Retail Store are Apple gift cards. The Apple Retail Stores and the Apple Store online do not accept iTunes gift cards as forms of payment. \nYou can not use redeemed value from an iTunes gift card to buy an Apple gift card or anything else from the following stores:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Retail Stores\n\n*Apple Store on the internet at http://store.apple.com\n\n*iCloud yearly storage space increases\n\n*iTunes Match service\n\n", "Q: Where can I find statistics for most searched apps in the App Store?

You can't. Apple does not provide any specific metrics about apps nor searches except those provided in Keynotes (we have $x apps, paid $y to developers, etc.). You could really only make assumptions based off the list of \"Most Popular\" apps in the App Stores.\nYour closest bet would be whether or not a third-party ad network like AdMob or LinkSynergy publishes statistics of their own.

How can I hide the unread count?\nMail.app provides an option to disable it, I'm hoping there is a setting in Outlook too.\n\n\nA: Previous answer does work now for outlook 2016. Outlook 2016 is present in the Notifications center where the badge can be disabled.\n\nA: If you are using Mac OS 10.8 Have a look in the notifications menu by clicking the apple button in the top left and then choosing 'System Preferences' and then choose 'Notifications' and you will be able to disable the red badge icon from there. \nCheck out the link below for more info.\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2013/04/29/disable-red-badge-app-icons-mac-os-x/\n\nA: You can set up a rule to mark all of your incoming mail as read.

It might not be a good solution for everyone.\nTo set this up, go to Outlook > Preferences > Rules. Then add a new rule, as shown here.\n\n\nA: I was able to hide the unread count by opening Notifications in System Preferences and under Microsoft Outlook I de-selected the Badge app icon setting. \n\nA: Deselecting \"Badge app icon\" in Notifications Center preferences worked for me (Outlook 2016 for Mac).\n\n\nA: I found an alternative way to solve this by completely removing the app from the Dock.

This occurs in restart or shut down mode.  Any thoughts?\n\nA: Zap the PRAM and reset the CMS\nA small amount of your computer’s memory, called “parameter random-access memory” or PRAM, stores certain settings in a location that OS X can access quickly. The particular settings that are stored depend on your type of Mac and the types of devices connected to it. The settings include your designated startup disk, display resolution, speaker volume, and other information. \n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the computer.\n\n*Locate the following keys on the keyboard: Command ⌘, option, P, and R. You will need to hold these keys down simultaneously in step 4.\nTurn on the computer.\n\n*Immediately press and hold Command+option+P+R. You must press this key combination before the gray screen appears.

Ideally I'm looking for a solution that doesn't involve GUI scripting the System Preferences app, although that would be slightly better than nothing.\nI've explored defaults write com.apple.universalaccess useMouseKeysShortcutKeys 1 and various other forms of that statement, but to no avail.\n\nA: Here's the GUI scripting solution:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal anchor \"Mouse\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.universalaccess\"\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell process \"System Preferences\"\n            tell first window\n                tell first tab group\n                    tell radio group 1\n                        if value of radio button 1 is 1 then\n                            # enabled, so disable\n                            click radio button 2\n                        else\n                            # disabled, so enable\n                            click radio button 1\n                        end if\n                    end tell\n                end tell\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    end tell\n    quit\nend tell\n\nIt will launch System Preferences if required, but doesn't show the window and quits it afterwards, so from a UI POV, it at least doesn't show the window.\n\nYou can change the persistent setting on which the System Preferences configuration is based using the following commands:\ndefaults write ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.universalaccess mouseDriver -bool YES\ndefaults write ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.universalaccess mouseDriver -bool NO\n\nUnfortunately, this only changes the configuration file and does not apply the changes to the running system.\n\nWhile you can programmatically press Option keys using AppleScript, like the following:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    key down option\n    key up option\nend tell\n\nThe press Option five times to toggle setting is at a higher level and doesn't get triggered by this.

However, the latest package (marked as beta) does not support KeyBindings that use the control modifier. If I try to modify the Programmer Dovarak bundle with Ukelele, it seems Mac OS X then ceases to recognize it, even after restarts.\nI then settled for remaking the Programmer Dvorak layout from Ukelele's built-in Dvorak template. This keyboard layout lets me use the Cocoa text shortcuts (^A ^E ^F etc), but I can't do things like dealing with system dialogs (e.g., do a Software Update and press spacebar. In general, outlined button : spacebar :: solid shaded button : enter). In addition, some apps won't let me use Command- shortcuts. For example, I can't use Command-C, -X, or -N in Mental Case while I'm using my remade Dvorak, but I can't use KeyBindings like ^D if I'm using the official Dvorak. BUT if I use the normal US keyboard, I get no problems; both control- and command- stuff work fine.\nSo, my main question is: how do I merge the functionalities of these two layouts? Phrased a different way: Why is it that, given the below XML, I run into the phenomena described above?\n\n\n*\n\n*a GitHub gist for my recreated Programmer Dvorak layout\n\n*another gist, posted to save you time from downloading the whole package\nNote that the official layout (2nd link above) actually installs itself with a .bundle directory in /Library/Keyboard Layouts/ whereas I have my recreated layout simply at $HOME/Library/Keyboard Layouts/name.layout.\nIf there's any other information that would be helpful, please let me know; I'd be happy to take screenshots or something if necessary.\n\nA: There is now a new version of Programmer Dvorak that works with key combinations like ⌃A.\n\n◊  Option modifier is currently non-functional. Also, you cannot replace a default Roman layout with this one. Control keys should now be functional.\n\nOption worked everywhere I tested, so non-functional could just mean that states under option don't output non-ASCII characters. If you want to disable all default input sources, you can edit the HIToolBox plist.\nIn previous versions you could have added a keymap where all keys output a control character like &#0000;.

I am laying out a long document in Pages '09 v4.1 (923), using the \"Hoefler Text\" typeface for the body text. On certain characters (k, e, and others) at the end of an italicized word, the advanced type features of Pages use the swash variation of the last character, though there is an otherwise \"normal\" italic of the letter. My client does not like the look of this, and I'm looking for a way to disable this behavior.\nI have tried going to the Font panel, click on the gear to select Typography, and there are Smart Swash options shown in the window that appears. However, no matter which swash options I enable or disable, Pages seems to ignore them, and continues to add the swashes.\nHow can I disable these swashes?\nClarification: This happens at the end of an italic span, not for letters that may end a word inside the span; and the span is often in the middle of roman body text. For instance:\n\nNote the swash on the end of the 't' in \"not\" and 'k' in \"Trek.\" Not also how in the last line, the 'e' in \"stare\" gets no swash, but the 'e' at the end of the italic span, in \"Trekkie,\" does.\n\nA: You cannot disable these swashes using the Smart Swashes section in the Format » Font » Show Fonts » Typography… window, because they're not Word Final Swashes. Those are disabled by default anyway.\nWhat you're seeing are Line Final Swashes, applied only to the end of a line or a text run with consistent formatting.\n\n\nI found no option to disable them from the Typography window or any menu option.\nWhat seems to work is to end a line by pressing Shift-Return instead of Return.\n\nNote that this will not end the paragraph and allow you to apply a different paragraph style to the second line, so depending on your circumstances (e.g. use in Headings), this will not be an optimal solution.\nYou can, for example, make the next line font size 1 and only insert a single space character. In the following example, I entered a single A character of font size 1 to the next line so it's visible as a black dot:\n\nIt's an ugly hack, but it might work for you.\n\nA: The new Hoefler Text that comes with Mountain Lion doesn't have this problem.\n", "Q: What is the blue section of a partition in Disk Utility?

I've received a bunch of MDI files which I need to open on a Mac Snow Leopard. Any way around this e.g. free readers available?\n\nA: MDI files were a proprietary file format used by Microsoft Office 2003 and 2007 on Windows. Searching around online, some people have luck opening them with QuickTime (which is already on your Mac), or GraphicConverter. Not having access to these files, nor a direct Mac equivalent, without more information we would be unsure if this would work or not. Office 2008 and 2011 on the Mac won't open them.\nThe best way to view these (and free too, really), would be to have a Windows using friend to open them in Windows and export as another file type. \n\nA: If you have access to a Windows system, Microsoft has a MDI to TIFF that you can use.

Unless you've used vim before, the folder likely will not already exist, so to create the folder, open Terminal.app and type\ncd ~\nmkdir .vim\n\nAssuming you downloaded ColorSamplerPack.zip to your Downloads folder you can then proceed with\ncd .vim\nunzip ~/Downloads/ColorSamplerPack.zip\n\nto unpack the content into the folder.

When a phishing email presents a link, they often send you to a webpage that redirects you to another webpage that they harvest your data from. Does the Quick Look feature in Mail follow these redirects?\nIf it doesn't, can I assume that this is a safe way to do an initial quick check that a link is from a nefarious source?\ni.e Would I expect to see the Redirecting... message in the Quick Look window? Would the people who created the exploit get any indication that I \"clicked\" on the link?\n\nA: The simple answer is no, QuickLook will not follow links.\nThe more complex answer is as follows and excuse the exposition and some of the generalisations, it's a bit of a minefield is email.\nIf you think of QuickLook in general, applications provide an interface to their core logic to allow QuickLook to provide its functionality to the user, i.e. preview of different files types.\nQuickLook on emails within Mail.app may differ to what is seen within Entourage or Outlook simply because the email is stored within the data storage of those applications, and QuickLook will use the registered app for that type to provide the preview functionality.\nSo in general, it is the registered email application doing the work of providing the preview.\nEmail applications regularly provide a certain level of protection for rich text and HTML formatted emails (unless you were using Outlook Express in the last 10 years haha) as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Image preview turned off for unknown senders/email marked spam (sometimes a configurable option)\n\n*Non-execution of Javascript\n\n*Non-execution of Flash (Mail.app - bad, bad app allows this)\n\n*Non-rendering of embedded images/files\n\n*Detection of obfuscated content\n\n\nLinks within the email are part of the text content of the email, spam filters may validate the link URL against the domain the email was sent from but will never crawl the link to determine the links validity.\nAny links that are not pure HTML anchors and are Javascript based will not be executed and therefore not followed either. \nSome corporate email gateways will crawl standard links to determine link validity which cause some major nightmares for those people whose business is to track valid commercially sent emails, but the process they use just records the HTTP response from the link URL rather than the HTTP content of the response.\nSo as you can see from the above, the answer is categorically no, QuickLook will never follow the links in a previewed email, as long the the QuickLook provider for the email provides the minimum amount of security for reading emails.\n\nJust for context, I worked for 3 years for an ESP (Email Service Provider), one of those companies that send emails on the behalf of major corporations and retailers.\nA lot of the time, marketing departments would ask these same questions and ask us how to work round them.

I discovered the export option from OS X does not export things like: proxies, or DNS settings from the VPN configuration.\nHow can I export all of these?\n\nA: Well I found a thread here that seems to accomplish what you're asking.  I can't put it any better than forum poster himself, so here's what he said in case the page isn't working:\n\nI figured out a way to do this, so thought I would post for anyone\n  following me that has a bunch of VPN settings and doesn't want to\n  manually key them back in. You will basically have to copy & paste a\n  few GUIDs to make your old prefs data match your new system. This\n  worked for me going from one Mac OS X 10.6 SL system to another SL\n  system. I would imagine similar steps would work for Mac OS X 10.5\n  Leopard and possibly 10.7 Lion. Here we go:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*First, go to Network Preferences on your new machine and add VPN (L2TP), VPN (PPTP), or whatever VPN \"interfaces\" you need. Do not\n  create any new VPN configurations at this time. Close Network Prefs.\n  \n*Open System Profiler, select and copy to the clipboard the Hardware UUID from the Hardware tab.\n  \n*Navigate to ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost and find your old NetworkConnections prefs file. It will have the form of\n  com.apple.networkConnect..plist. Make a copy of this\n  file. Replace the  portion w/ the one you copied in\n  step #2. Don't forget to remove any spaces and the \" copy\" tag. You\n  should now have a new file called\n  com.apple.networkConnect..plist.\n  \n*Open 2 files in an editor that can handle .plist files (I used TextWrangler): the com.apple.networkConnect..plist file\n  you just made, and\n  /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist.\n  \n*In preferences.plist, look for the GUID of each VPN interface that you've created. The \"UserDefinedName\" string at the end of the key\n  will tip you off:\n<key>14A4B264-C231-41FE-857B-EE5557B69851</key> <dict> <key>DNS</key>\n  <dict/> <key>IPv4</key> <dict> <key>ConfigMethod</key>\n  <string>PPP</string> </dict> ... <key>UserDefinedName</key>\n  <string>VPN (L2TP)</string> </dict> \nThe first long string (\"14A4B264...\") is the part you need. Copy this\n  to the clipboard.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Now move over to your com.apple.networkConnect file. Find the key that has all of your old VPN settings for that VPN type contained\n  w/in it. Select all of the key name (which is the GUID of your VPN\n  interface on your old Mac), then paste to replace it w/ the new GUID.\n  \n*Repeat steps 5 & 6 for each VPN interface you need. In my case, there were 2: L2TP and PPTP.\n  \n*Save your changes and close the com.apple.networkConnect file. Close the preferences.plist file WITHOUT saving anything.\n  \n*Open your Network Preferences, select your VPN interface(s), and you should see your past configurations.\n\nHope this helps you!\n", "Q: How to restore PHP to the original configuration?

I don't quite understand why certain websites like Twitter render text so badly in my Safari browser 5.1.2 (under Windows 7 x64). The same problem doesn't occur in Chrome or Firefox or IE. And it doesn't happen on all websites but quite often. Anyone have insight on this? I've attached a screenshot with the example.\n\n\nA: Read this for background\nIn short, Apple and Microsoft use very different methods to render fonts on Mac OS X and Windows.  Both systems have their merits, and frankly a lot of the time people prefer the one they are used to, and when the see the other they dislike it not so much because it's bad, but because it's different.\nOrdinarily this isn't an issue, Mac users have their way, and Windows users have their way.  However, for Safari on Windows, Apple decided in their wisdom to haul over the Mac OS X font rendering mechanism, which is why pages loaded in Safari look not only different to the same page rendered in other web browsers, but different to every other Windows app you have.\nPersonally, while (likely for the reasons I stated earlier) I prefer the Mac way of doing things, I think that they should not attempt to enforce this on Windows users who are likely to see it as different first, and dislike it.  Even if they like it, it's inconsistent.  Even though I prefer it, I don't want to see it on Windows, as I prefer consistency more.\nSo, to answer your question, what's happening is that Safari is attempting to render this font in a completely different way to the other browsers, and occasionally it comes across a font or typeface that it frankly handles badly compared to Windows own technology (the opposite happens too, it's horses for courses), this can happen if a font is specified that has been tweaked to work particularly well with one system or another.\n\n\nA: The effect of worse rendering is really the opposite situation in most cases. \nUnfortunately for me, I'm forced to use Windows 7 x64 but glad for Safari when I use it from time to time just because of the wonderful font smoothing which I'm enjoying only in Safari but nowhere else. It's clear to me that Apple was able to pack their font smoothing technology into Safari, therefore that means they can pack it anywhere they want.  I really wished if they packed this font smoothing technology into an app and let us - windows users - buy and use it on our Windows machines. \nI really love it and it makes my eyes less strained and fatigue from lots of reading and for my bad luck, the Mac OS is not for me to adopt. So yes, in some cases worse rendering is had, but my experience is the opposite - it's better than normal on Windows :(\n", "Q: Why does stock Mac OS X allow me to rip CDs but not DVDs? When I insert a music CD into my iMac, iTunes opens and gives me the option to \"rip\" (i.e. import the content and save as files) the tracks using any of these encoders: AAC, AIFF, Apple Lossless, MP3, or WAV.\nWhen I insert a video DVD into my iMac, DVD Player opens, but I don't see any menu item to rip the DVD.\nWhy are music CDs and video DVDs treated differently in the software that ships with OS X with regard to ripping?  Why does Apple allow me to rip CDs but not DVDs?\n\nA: This could get very technical but the answer is actually relatively straightforward.\nThe act of \"ripping\" takes place in 2 stages, reading the source material, and writing out a converted version of same.\nFor music this is straightforward, mainly because the technology is old enough to predate stuff that was later incorporated into DVDs.  Music CDs do not have any form of encryption.  The data is laid bare for you to use as you see fit.  This means anyone can read it without requiring the use of a licensed decoder which you can them laden with prohibitions on use.  Once you can read it, you can convert it, so long as you have a suitable encoder, which Apple provides to allow encoding into the formats you list.\nFor a movie, this is different.  The source material is encrypted and copy protected in a way that Music CDs never were, and never will be.  This means you need a licensed decoder just to be able to read them.  The terms of the license will often dictate that you can only decode for playback, and not for conversion.  Most often this is purely a legal distinction, and not a technical one.  Obviously Apple have to abide by the terms of these licenses or they could not provide you with them, and as such they will not allow you to subsequently decode a film, then instead of watching it immediately encode (rip) it into a different format.  They do provide an encoding mechanism for movies, but it will only work on unencrypted and decoded files.  Of course, there is nothing to stop other programs that Apple do not supply from ignoring such paper restrictions (or providing replacement decoders that are less inhibited in what they allow), and happily ripping away.\n\nA: I Am Not A Lawyer, but I'd imagine this is because allowing you to import the DVD would put apple in breach of their license with the Format/Logo Licensing Corporation for the DVD-Video standard. This would depend on what the specific terms of the license were.\n", "Q: How can I remotely delete sensitive data and log out from a stolen Mac?

I realize this may be a minor point for some, but it's a feature I used all the time in Snow Leopard and I can't get used to the change in Lion.\nIs there any way to change this setting in Lion so that clearing the desktop functions like in did in Snow Leopard?\nThanks in advance for any help.\n\nA: I assume you have 'tap to click' enabled?\nInstead of just tapping on the stack in the dock, do a mouse click and hold down until the stack directory opens.\n\nA: I know it would have been a lot more convenient to have the stack open as it were in Snow Leopard. But I don't think this is possible. \nWhat I do as an alternative:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the stack first to open it  \n\n*Start dragging the file I want to move  \n\n*Drag the file to the bottom right corner of my screen (I have Hot Corners map Bottom Right Corner to Show Desktop) -> The Desktop is visible now  \n\n*Drop the item onto the desktop  \n\n", "Q: Is there a definitive reference or introspection capability for Applescript? Is there some canonical place I can find a reference for the scripting capabilities various things have in AppleScript?\nFor instance, I'd like to automate iTunes a little bit. Looking around on the web I see iTunes supports get album of current track and current track has several properties: name, artist, etc. But nowhere can I find a reference for all of iTunes' properties, or capabilities other than current track. That info may be on Doug's AppleScripts for iTunes somewhere, but then that's iTunes specific, I want a general reference for all apps.\nSimilarly, Google Chrome has some scriptability. How can I discover what it can do? It's a third party product and Google has written some of their own docs, but they seem incomplete.\nA website AppleScript reference would be great. Even better would be if AppleScript has some introspection abilities so I can just ask iTunes itself what it supports with AppleScript code. (Honestly I hate the language, but it seems to be the only way to access a lot of neat things in MacOS apps.)\n\nA: Most apps that can be scripted with AppleScript will have a dictionary you can open with AppleScript Editor (File > Open Dictionary). The app's dictionary will then list details for each of the commands and classes that can be used with it in an AppleScript script.\nCreating an AppleScript dictionary is up to the app's developer, so you may occasionally come across apps with poorly documented, incomplete or outdated dictionaries, but it's still usually a good place to start.\n\nA: You could open the application's dictionary in AppleScript Editor from the ⇧⌘O dialog.\n\nA few basic commands for examining objects:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    properties\n    properties of window 1\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Finder\"\n    UI elements\n    {name, value} of attributes of some UI element\nend tell\n\n", "Q: How can I extract video clips from a non-encrypted DVD? I have a non-encrypted DVD (of my wedding, if you must know) and I was wondering if I could extract clips from the DVD into files in some standard video format (i.e. clip1.mp4) so I can look at them on my iMac and perhaps upload them to YouTube.\nI suppose I would be willing to install software for this, but I'm especially curious to know if the software that shipped with my iMac (i.e. iLife) can do this.

A DVD is encoded in Mpeg2.  Good for DVDs, or it was when it was when DVDs were new, but woefully poor compared to a modern codec like H.264.  A 3-hour film might take up 8Gb of space on a dual layer DVD, but perhaps as little as 1Gb in a more modern format.  Certainly, if the intended recipient is YouTube, then reducing the quality and resolution can easily also reduce file size 20x +, which makes for quicker uploads.\nSo, considering that, what you will end up doing, regardless of what program you use, is decoding the Mpeg 2 and re-encoding it into something else rather than snipping out (Could be h.264, DivX or any number of others, all of which provide the same quality or better (You can't improve a bad source) at massively lower file sizes).  h.264 is a good choice, YouTube use it directly for delivery to mobile devices.\nHandbrake lets you choose by DVD chapter, DVD Chapter Episode, or just a section of seconds and quickly re-encode it into something more modern and more suitable for computing use rather than brown box DVD player use.  It will do loads of other things, including messing around with subtitles and multiple audio channels (think directors commentary) which your wedding video is unlikely to have, but it's nice to have the ability if you need it for something else later.\nHandbrake is free, works on Windows/Mac/Linux, and is actively developed & updated, so a popular choice.\n", "Q: Change tabstop in TextEdit.app How does one change the tabstop in TextEdit.app for Snow Leopard? \nThe current tabstop is 8 spaces. I would like to change this to 4 spaces.\nIs there any way to achieve this?\n\nA: For plaintext tabs, you don't need to replace the entire TextEdit app to change it. I looked at the source code and it provides the simpler answer: Open the Terminal and type\ndefaults write com.apple.TextEdit \"TabWidth\" '4'\nWhere '4' is the number of spaces a tab should be.\n\nA: Yes. \n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure Format > Text > Show Ruler is enabled.\n\n*Locate the tab stops in the ruler (Fig. 1).\n\n*Move the first one to 1/4 inch (Fig. 2).\n\n\n \nAlternatively, you could use something like Keyboard Maestro, TextExpander, or BetterTouchTool to map four spaces to the Tab key. This is the only way I'm aware of to do it for plain text files (.txt).\n\nA: A kindly soul has slightly modified TextEdit to add a field, \"Tab Width\", at the bottom of the \"New Document\" tab of the \"Preferences\" window.\nType in a number between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and it will change the width of tabs to that number (in character widths).\nDownload at code.google.com.\nSince I couldn't replace the main TextEdit app, I used \"show package contents\" and replaced the inside of the app.\n", "Q: Is it possible to virtualize PowerPC... FOR a PowerPC? (absolutely not Intel-related) As my question states,\nIs it possible to virtualize PowerPC... FOR a PowerPC?\nConsider that you're using Linux for PPC.  You want to run apps written specifically for Mac OS 7.x through 9.2.2, all of which require PPC (let's say).  Let's also say that you don't want to set up a dual-boot configuration on your PPC Mac because... well, you're lazy.\nEmulators like Sheepshaver (for Linux on PPC) are fine for most basic needs, but for more intensive programs like games, complex math software, and pretty much anything that requires the MMU (memory management unit) will simply NOT run.\nA PPC virtualizer written FOR the same PPC machine could allow those complex programs access to all the appropriate system resources it needs.... because its ALREADY THERE.  There is nothing to be emulated!\nSo, even at least hypothetically... is it possible?\n\nA: Hypothetically, it may be possible, but the tools may not exist. The best tool I could find though was QEMU and Mac on Linux. It says it can virtualize, but I have not tested it or used it. Qemu also says its for embedded PPC - which would be like the Xbox 360, and not an older Macintosh - so therefore still not allow PPC virtualization. \nI see two problems that make this a bit harder:\n\n\n*\n\n*It depends on the chip you are trying to virtualize - the chip needs to have some virtualization instruction sets to allow this. Some of the G5s had this, but since I don't know what machine you have, its hard to verify. Thats what allows Intels to virtualize all types of OS now. This is pretty much what you are talking about 'its already there', but its not always there in all cases - the processor needs to know how to virtualize itself.\n\n*Power of the machines today - even when the first Intel Macs came out, some were just as powerful or even more powerful than the G5's of the time. Now that years have gone by, many of the tools (like MoL) look like they haven't been updated in a while, probably due to community involvement. Thats probably because too, if you really needed to run a much older machine, you could emulate the older machine faster than the older machine could virtualize itself. \n\n\nFor most of the people that I have seen in your situation, the easiest route is to just get another machine in most cases (and thats what I have done before, years ago). You can even get pretty powerful G5's for pretty much nothing today. I had a friend about 2 years ago just give a dual proc G5.\n", "Q: iPhone making no noise except ringtones My wife's iPhone is playing up.  It won't make any noise except for when it revceives a call.  Messages, etc. only vibrate.  Just now it made the unlock sound when I unlocked it, but I can't get it to make the sound again.   When you press the volume keys, the ringer icon appears with no volume bar:\n\nThe lock button was also playing up for about 12 hours.  It would randomly press itself, causing the power off slide to appear or the phone to lock randomly.

It seems to be a software based issue. I would suggest backing up and restoring the device using these steps. Make sure you set it up as a new device so as not to transfer any old software back to the phone after the restore. \n\nA: It seems that the hardware in the docking port was damaged.  The phone thought there was an accessory permanently plugged in.\nAlso, my wife subsequently managed to smash the screen.\nWe paid the replacement fee for a new phone.\n\nA: All you need to do is, to clean up the headphone plugging in dock and you shall be good to go ..\n(reason being - your phone is considering a headphone always being plugged in)\nhow to verify this fact ...?\nswitch the mode from silent to ringer.\nIt shall never show the as ringer, but shall show as headphone-silent or\nheadphone-ringer.\nonce the headphone plugging in dock is cleaned all the sounds shall work fine.\n", "Q: Tabbing between application windows while using spaces The weirdest thing happened to me. I reinstalled OSX Lion on my macbook, and when all done I noticed how I could not switch between application windows on different spaces using cmd + tab. \nI'm positive I've been able to jump to different application windows that are on different space before. Now it will only switch to another application window if it's on the same space. If it's on another space, it will switch to the app but remain on the same space.\nI've also noticed how I cannot jump to application windows on other spaces when I single click their icons in the dock.\nIs there a stupid setting I've missed, or have I been living in a wonderful fantasy for many months while using Lion?\n\nA: Have you got an existing screen sharing connection? It is one of the main reasons why switching between applications does not work. Failing that try restarting the dock by opening a Terminal window and enter the following command:\nkillall Dock\n\nA: Solution: I had overlooked the option \"When switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application\" which can be found under System Preferences » Mission Control. Check this box and tabbing between all the windows works. \n", "Q: How to avoid Mail.app grouping mails While i generally like the newest Mail.app, i particularly dislike that it groups all messages that i receive from a specific sender.

One is a DVI monitor (it also supports VGA) and the other is VGA-only.\n\n\n*\n\n*The DVI monitor is currently hooked up using the HDMI port on the Mac Mini, with, of course, an HDMI to DVI adapter.\n\n*The other monitor is currently hooked up using a DisplayPort to VGA adapter.\n\n\nThis all just works fine. But whenever I want to watch a video on my TV (for example), I have to put the TV into the HDMI port, thereby disconnecting my main monitor. I was wondering if it is possible to daisy chain this.\nI want to just hook up an adapter or something like that, put my two monitors in there and then just hook up the TV, being able to use it whenever I want to. \nIs it possible to do such a thing? I know it's possible by using two Thunderbolt monitors, daisy chaining them and then plug in the other display (a TV for example...) to the HDMI port. However, I don't want to buy two new display's...\nThanks in advance,\nRobert\n\nA: Unfortunately, it is not possible to daisy chain displays through Mini DisplayPort. \nHowever, there is a company called DisplayLink that makes software drivers for USB video adapters. They also have links in their store to Mac compatible, DisplayLink approved USB display adapters. One of my coworkers uses this to connect a MacBook Pro to two external displays and a TV in his office. It uses the extended desktop feature for each display. It's a pretty sweet setup and works flawlessly. \nI see no reason why this wouldn't work for you. Good luck!\n", "Q: How can I keep Mail.app's archive from becoming too big? I'm trying to reduce my hard drive space used to prepare for a move to an SSD. I've got a wonderful application called DaisyDisk that allows me to visualize data segments on my hard drives.\nI have three internal drives, and for the time being I'd just like to slim down the size of my startup disk, so I can move it to a smaller SSD.\nBy far the largest segment of my hard drive is a section under Macintosh HD/Users/joelglovier/library/Mail/V2/Mailboxes. This directory is over 75GB. You can see the visualization from DaisyDisk here: http://cl.ly/E7OJ\nI found this directory before, when trying to slim down my hard drive, and simply deleted it's contents, then changed my settings in Mail.app to not archive attachments, thinking that would resolve the issue.\nHowever, some months later this directory has again creeped up to a ginormous size.\nCan anybody please help me understand what this directory is for, and how to permanently reduce it's size - via Mail.app settings, or whatever I need to change to stop it from becoming so huge.\nThank you!\nNote: I'm on OSX Lion 10.7.3 using Mail.app ver 5.2.\nEDIT: SO I dug through the files in the directory in question. There was one particular mailbox in /Library/Mail/V2/Mailboxes called \"Recovered Messages (account name).mbox\" which contained a very strange subdirectory structure of a single email duplicated thousands of times under different subdirectory structures. For example, there was a subdirectory in it that had /1, /2, /3, etc., and each one of those directories had /attachments and /messages. The /attachments on each had hundreds of subdirectories each containing this one same attachement from a particular email, and the /messages under each had hundreds of copies of the email all with different numerical file names. But the weird thing is ALL were from the same exact email.\n\nA: Go ahead and delete that \"recovered\" folder, and there is also going to be an .OfflineCache folder that needs to be removed.  Note the period at the beginning of the file name; you will either need to show invisible files or use Terminal to delete that folder.\nThis most often happens when an unsuitable large file is attached to a message.  With GMail for example, any attachment over 20MB will be rejected.  Mail sees the rejection by the mail server and tries to recover from it by sending the message again.  Over time, these half-attempts to send mail stack up and start using all your drive space.\nIf you want a quick and easy way around the problem, remove the account in Mail's preferences, then re-add it. This will discard the offline cache for the account and free up your mangled space, at the expense of having to re-download the real messages.\nAnd in the future, don't sent huge attachments.  Use a specialized service like Dropbox instead.\n\nA: I was having problems trying to migrate my email data when i updated to lion. i eventually gave up trying and just moved my /Library/Mail folder to my desktop and re-added all my email accounts. when i started to delete the Mail folder i realized it was 150 GB.\nFor the last 3 years I would notice that emails i had sent years ago were reappearing in my sent folder. Its funny that someone would mention using a specialized service to send large files, because that's exactly what i was doing. I was sharing files on my idisk. However the emails were not just limited to my idisk shares, there were also emails without attachments that would keep appearing in my sent box. \ni contacted some of the people from these recurring messages and they confirmed that they had not received any duplicates. so i just shrugged it off. Little did i know this glitch was eating away at my hard drive. I had noticed that no matter what i did, my hard drive was always gradually decreasing. \ni reinstalled more times than i can count, but for the past 6 years i have always synced my mail accounts with my dotmac/mobileme account. I realize now that it would have been better to re-add my mail accounts manually after a fresh install. i don't believe that would have solved everything, but it would have slowed down the rate of which my hard drive was filing up.\nI see now why Apple has abandoned their mobileme platform and gave the mail app a major overhaul. Hopefully the issues are resolved now.\nFor me, the strategy to manage Mail is to not migrate in the data and start over regularly so I can see what syncs down from the cloud and what mail came from older Macs.\n", "Q: How can I change the modified date of a symlink? I would like to change the modified date of a symlink.

I would like to hear the album in sequence.\nI also have playlists that I'd like to listen to in sequence.\nWhen I look at the list of songs in the playlist the controls at the top available to me are \"Edit\" \"Clear\" \"Delete\" and under that \"Shuffle\". But \"Shuffle\" doesn't seem to be a toggle switch. It's more like it means \"reshuffle.\"\nSo anyway where do I set the music play to just play the songs in order?\n\nA: Is it possible that you have shuffle enabled? The shuffle button in the playlist list is not a toggle, so that wouldn't tell you. Here's how you can find out:\n\nIf the shuffle icon is blue, it means your iPhone is playing on shuffle. \nSomething else you could check is if Shake to Shuffle is enabled:\n\nIf it is, you could accidentally activate shuffle without knowing it.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Since iOS 8.4, you can play songs in sequence by clicking on the 1st song; when the song title is showing at the bottom, drag it up and you will see the controls. Unlock the shuffle button by clicking on it.\n\nA: I'm on an iPhone 6 plus IOS 8.4.1, if that matters.  To get my songs to play in order (not shuffle), I hit the song bar at the bottom of the screen as the first song was playing.  When that opened, I shut off both the shuffle icon (interlocking arrows) and the straight icon (looped arrows.) With both of them off (not highlighted), my music plays in order.  Go figure.....\n", "Q: My iPhone 4S won't text my friend's Android, my phone thinks she still has an iphone with iOS5 My friend used to have an iPhone 3GS with iOS version 5. Our text messages showed up blue being that we were on the same software. She now has updated her phone to a Galaxy S II and my phone still thinks that her phone number is operating on iOS 5 software. Her phone cannot receive messages from my phone, but my phone receives messages with no problem. No matter what I do (even restarting my phone and deleting her and reading her) her text messages are still in blue instead of green. When I send a message, it shows that it's sent but her phone never receives it. It's extremely aggravating.\n\nA: This is a known issue with iMessage. In your case, what has happened is that the SIM was registered on Apple's servers as capable of accepting iMessages. When your friend swapped phones, they likely kept the same SIM card. So now their old iPhone (bound to Apple's servers by its UUID) and the SIM card (bound by its own ID) are both registered with Apple to receive iMessages.\nThis article talks of possible fixes, and the possibility that Apple has something cooking (after all they should provide some capacity to remove the devices, perhaps from your Apple ID account). You can also head over to this article for additional reading and perhaps more solutions.\nI wish I had a simple solution for you, but it may require calling Apple and discussing the matter with them. I would say you should also ask them to cover the cost of a new SIM should your friend require one.\n\nA: Well it is a bit of a heavy handed solution, but if you were to go into Settings -> Messages and set iMessage to off, then all of your outbound messages would be sent as regular old SMS. Your friend would get them then.\n\nA: If your friend has registered her iPhone with Apple in the past, she can unregister it on the My Support Profile website.\nThis article (How to turn off iMessage without iOS device) on Apple’s forum pages implies that this device is then also removed from iMessage, the original problem being:\n\nMy iPhone got stolen, but when my friends message me their phones keep\n  trying to send me iMessages.\n\nGood luck!\n\nA: Having similar issue between droid and iPhone… Cannot get each others texts. We both downloaded the app 'WhatsApp' and with a super easy set up we are now able to text without any issues. We can send photos and the app even says you can make calls with it.  Its a quick, easy fix to this problem.  So glad we found it!\n\nA: I had come across this issue regarding the same phones. We figured out that, because the old iPhone was switched on, my iPhone picked up on iMessage, once we turned the iPhone off as It wasn't needed then the Samsung S3 recieved all msgs as a normal text.\nBut if you have sold your iPhone, and not deleted your iTunes account, this will not work. You will need to delete your account. If for any reason you don't wish to do this because you have other apple products it will result in registering a new SIM -- which takes five minutes once you have a new SIM. \n\nA: Check your phone plan with your carrier.  My plan is the same one I started with in 1994.  Make sure that your carrier does not show text messaging blocked for your account.  I finally went to my Verizon store and there was a guy there who recommended the person who was helping me check my account for any blocked services.  Apparently my vintage flip phone did not allow texting; as soon as he unblocked my account, I could finally send a text to my droid contacts.  I've been dealing with this problem since last August.\n", "Q: How do you encrypt a file or a single folder worth of data? Looking for a way to easily encrypt a file or a folder with a password without having to make up an encrypted read write image in Disk Utility?\n\nA: There are plenty of utilities that will create a simple encrypted volume/image for you, I've used Exces, but I got it in a bundle, otherwise seems a little bit expensive. I know there are others. Exces does what it says and nothing more. \nIt creates a volume where you can drop anything (folders, files, etc.). \nAfter you close it, you need the password to re-open it and access its contents. If you lose it, you're hosed. \n\nA: Found some interesting solutions in the article How to password protect folders. Someone in the comments of this article mentioned the app Espionage 2 and this seems to be more along the lines of what I was looking for with more a seamless Finder integration and maintaining folder appearance, not sure if it works on just single files the same way, will need to try it.

I am trying to add my gmail contacts from the address book/ adding just the gmail addresses. Noone seems to get my invitations. Why so? Is @me.com account only for adding @me.com accounts?\n\nA: If you create a me.com account in iChat, this will serve as an AIM account. If you want to add your Google Talk/Google+ friends with Gmail addresses, then you will have to add a Google account in iChat. This is very simple to do in Lion, simply go to iChat>Preferences, click on Accounts, and hit the small + button in the bottom left. Then you will be prompted to add new account information and just select the option from the popup box called Google Talk. Then all you need to do is enter your Google account information and you will now have all your Google friends in iChat.\n", "Q: OS X Snow Leopard installer hangs I installed Linux on my MBP.

They each have an iTunes library, where mom keeps the pictures from the family's digital camera and her music collection, and dad maintains his music and the family's movie collection. Also, they each have an iPhone, which is synced to their respective music library. \nWe recently got them an Apple TV, so that they'd be able to enjoy the content on their tv. We've gotten both picture viewing, music streaming and movie watching work, but the problem is that all content is not accessible at the same time.\nTo me it appears that the culprit is the fast user switching. Both libraries appear on the Apple TV, but usually only one of the libraries is accessible. I have not been able to establish a pattern with regards to who is the active user on the iMac, i.e. it does not appear to matter if dad's the foremost user on the mac when trying to access his library from the tv (or if mom's foremost when trying to access dad's library).\nAny suggestions as to what can be done to solve this problem? The goal is that all content should be accessible from the Apple TV at all times.\nThey are using iTunes 10.5.3, unfortunately I can't tell the software version of the AppleTV right now.\n\nA: Firstly, in order for AppleTV to see the iTunes Library a user must be logged in and running iTunes. If both of these are not present then AppleTV won't work.\nSince they are on the same physical Mac might I recommend combining the iTunes Media folder and placing it in the /Users/Shared/ directory. As all users have access to the Shared directory the actual media files wouldn't be duplicated and they can each maintain their own iTunes Library. After moving the iTunes Media folder to the Shared folder you will need to go into iTunes Preferences for each user and under the Advanced tab select the new iTunes Media folder location.\n\n\nA: The malfunction was apparently a bug in the Apple TV software, after updating to the release from a few weeks ago (presumably 5.0), it all works as expected.\nThanks for all suggestions, though.\n", "Q: Adding a bookmark or a web page to the reading list in Safari causes freeze When I try to add a bookmark or a web page to the reading list in safari it freezes.\nHow do I solve this problem and what is causing it?\n\nSysteminfo\nMac OS 10.6.8\n\n\nA: Try to reinstall Safari.\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall by...\n\n\n*\n\n*...dragging /Applications/Safari.app to the trash.\n\n*...using a free cleaning tool.

Since all the software available seem not able to do it, I've tried by installing the bootcamp drivers on Windows. First manually (placing AppleHFS.sys and AppleMNT.sys into system32/drivers and adding the proper regedit keys) and then, since this didn't work, using the whole bootcamp installer. When I connect the drive, it's still unrecognized (even in the Drive Manager). What should I do? (or maybe: is it possible?)\n\nA: Apple's BootCamp drivers do not have the driver or other software support needed to mount a volume using FileVault 2's encryption (otherwise known as CoreStorage encryption.) \nTo the best of my knowledge, there's no way to unlock and mount a CoreStorage encrypted volume on any OS except by using a Mac running Mac OS X 10.7.x.\n", "Q: Checklist and tools for confirming a Macbook is working correctly Thinking about buying a used Apple laptop computer, and wondering if there are any manual checklist or tools for confirming an Apple laptop is working correctly via some sort of automated diagnostics.\nI'm not concerned about the state of any software on the computer, and the best solution would be me just running the diagnostics on boot from a thumb-drive, since I'd like to avoid having to install software on a computer I would not own at the point it's being tested.\nAlso, it'd be nice if the diagnostics output a report and any data it was able to discover on the spec of the hardware present.\n\nA: You should be able to use Apple Hardware Test and selecting the More Info button from the Apple menu > About This Mac to get all the info you need.\n", "Q: How feasibile is it to run a newer version of OSX on a used Mac? Thinking of buying a used Apple MacBook and wanted to know the best way to tell based on the hardware specs provided by Apple online by entering in the serial number for the MacBook here:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/specs/\nAfter pulling up the specs for the hardware on Apple, how do I figure out what the feasibility of running a newer version of OS X on that used Mac is?\n\nA: As long as it is a Core 2 Duo processor or better (read: 64-bit architecture), you can put Lion on it. The sole exception seems to be early 2006 model with an Intel Core Duo (32-bit); this one will only support Snow Leopard.\nReference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook\n\nA: As long as you have minimum 2 GB of ram, sufficient disk space, and any mac within the past few years (mine is almost 3 years old running lion like a charm), you'll be fine. 4Gb of ram REALLY helps though.\n\nA: What do you mean by how will the hardware respond? If you're trying to install a previous version of os x on a mac that shipped after lion shipped, you won't be able to. You can only revert back to the version of os x a mac came with.\nThe reason for this, I believe, is old versions of os x won't have newer firmware and drivers for new machines.\n\nA: It really depends on the model of the used Mac you are thinking of buying. \nFor example, I have a Mac Pro from 2006 or 2007 that will not update past 10.7.5, though it has plenty of disk space, RAM, and has a dual-core Intel Xeon processor. I see no reason why it won't update beyond 10.7.5, but Apple has restrictions in place....\nI think your best bet would be to ask the seller if they know. If it's an Authorized Apple Reseller, they ought to know, or should be able to find out quickly enough. If the seller isn't savvy to that knowledge, contact Apple directly, perhaps by dropping by an Apple Store. \n", "Q: How do I mount ejected external USB flash storage?

The long answer is there are a few general rules with mac software support. If an app is built for PowerPC, it will only work up to 10.6 Snow Leopard as Lion dropped PowerPC support.

My mother got an iPad 2 and rarely ever uses her old computer anymore. She mostly uses it to look things up and watch video in the different Swedish TV-channels apps (like SVTPlay or TV4Play). The problem is that she has no way of viewing them on anything else but the iPad so she told me that she and my dad actually sat on the sofa in front of the TV looking at the iPad screen to see a show that they had missed. I was thinking that I should solve this problem for them for her birthday in a month. \nWhat is the best, and most importantly, easiest way for them to watch these videos on their TV instead? I'm not sure if the apps support video out but since she has an iPad 2 I was thinking of video mirroring. \nThe real question is if it would be better to only use the cable directly to the TV or if they would gain from having an Apple TV so that they could wirelessly control the program from the sofa. The cable is a very direct and physical interaction that is easy to understand but it's not very long so you'd need to get up to pause the program.\n\nA: If money is not a problem I would recommend Apple TV.\nApple TV has the advantage of begin wireless, and as you said, your parents will be able to control it from their seat. This quite useful for watching watching shows, but even better for other things, like looking at pictures on your iPad on the big screen, for example. \nOn the intuitiveness, if your parents already know how to access the multitasking bar at the bottom of the iPad it is pretty easy: just a switch away. Practically speaking, easier than dealing with walking, plugging it in, and having to stand up to input things to the iPad, or dealing with a long cord.\nApple TV has many other advantages/features: Photo Stream through iCloud, Netflix, Youtube, flickr, Internet Radio, WSJ, Movie Rentals, TV Show Store, etc. I don't know how many would your parents use/need, and of course Movies and Shows come for an extra cost, but its something to keep a thought on.\nIt's $40 dollars more expensive though. If your parents don't need such features, they don't mind a cord, and if they don't really need controlling their iPad while displaying something on the big screen, than it's some good $40 to save, but if you can spare it I think you get plenty of extra features and wireless commodity from it.\n\nA: Your simplest option may just be the Apple Digital AV Adapter and a long HDMI cable. \n\nA: The easiest thing to do would be to buy an Apple TV. I don't know about you, but I find cabling to the TV cumbersome and how far away you can sit is an issue. You want to have your iPad on your lap when you're viewing content on the TV, getting up each time to change something isn't very practical, call me lazy I guess.\n\nA: Another option is if you have an old Mac lying around just hook that up to your parent's tv and use AirServer.  Alternatively you can pick up a Mac Mini on ebay quite cheaply and use that.  Then you have the full power of a Mac that can be used for many things (backup hub for other Macs in the house) as well as an AirPlay terminal.\n", "Q: How do I stop my iPad's passcode buttons from lighting up? I have a jailbroken iPad 2 and I was wondering if it is possible to stop the passcode buttons from lighting up when they're pressed.

This post suggests that the command tell application “System Events” to key code 37 in AppleScript should move the mouse pointer one pixel down and to the left if run when MouseKeys are enabled. In OS X 10.7.2, however, it has the effect of generating a lowercase l, and not moving the mouse at all.\nSimilarly, I had hoped tell application “System Events” to key code 34 using control down would sent a control click at the current point of the mouse cursor, but that does not seem to be the effect.\nDoes anyone know a way that works in Lion on a mid-2011 MacBook Air to generate a click or control-click at the current mouse location using AppleScript? It is okay if it relies on MouseKeys and/or UI scripting.\nI would prefer if it did not involve installing compiled command line utilities, but if such utilities exist and are Lion compatible, that is far better than nothing.\n\nA: There are tons of command line utilities to do this... and I'd reckon that going this route's your best bet... One benefit? is that these solutions should work, irrespective of whether or not \"mouse keys\" are on, right?  One of my particular faves is cliclick\n\nCliclick” is short for \"Command-Line Interface Click\". > It is a a tiny shell / Terminal application that will emulate mouse clicks or series of mouse clicks (including doubleclicks and control-clicks) at arbitrary screen coordinates.\nHence, it is a tool for automating / scripting things that cannot otherwise be scripted (for instance, using AppleScript). Other than GUI Scripting, it does not require \"Access for assistive devices\" to be activated in the System Preferences.\n\nUsage:\n$ cliclick c m\n\nwill \"control-click\" the current mouse location, but you can also specify the coordinates, shift-click, double-click, etc.  It can also return the coordinates of the mouse with a -q argument, and return the mouse to the original location (when specifying coordinates) with the -r argument.\nIn your case.. I guess you'd just...\ndo shell script \"cliclick c m\"\nfrom inside your AppleScript / Workflow / whatever...\nThere's a GREAT post on this subject on MacWorld's site (née Mac OS X Hints) - that I've gleaned lots of good info from, over the years.  If you don't care for my answer you will surely find a solution you DO like, there... there's hacks to make everyone smile - from an Automator freak = to a grumpy C diehard.\nUpdate:\nThere do seem to be some ways - to \"do it\" in AppleScript.. but they all seem to require knowing where your mouse is... which i assume you don't.

I know this is OS-X-specific, but it's also highly technical.\n\nA: No, there isn't really a better way to force a process to reload its preferences other than killing it.

At home, my primary computer is an iMac with an external USB hard drive. The external drive is shared so that other computers can use it for Time Machine. I have a MacBook Air that I take to work every day, and it uses the shared Time Machine drive when I am at home. However, I have to manually mount the drive.\nHow can I set up my MacBook Air to automatically mount the shared drive when I'm on my home AirPort network?\nCurrently, I perform these steps to mount the shared drive and back up:\n\n\n*\n\n*In a Finder window, select the iMac from the Shared list\n\n*Press \"Connect\"\n\n*Authenticate with my iMac user credentials (I just saved the password to my keychain)\n\n*Choose the USB drive from the list of available volumes to mount\n\n*Use the Time Machine menu extra to choose \"Back Up Now\"\n\n\nUltimately, I want to make this a zero-step process, so I can come home, turn on the MacBook Air, automatically detect and mount the shared drive, and back up with Time Machine. I assume this can be automated, with an automation script set up as a login item, but it would be preferable to avoid explicitly scripting it.\n(I originally wanted to attach the hard drive to my AirPort Extreme and share it from there for Time Machine, but this failed or was not allowed on SnowLeopard; I don't remember. I haven't attempted it since upgrading to Lion.)\nThanks for reading!\nBoth of my computers are running Lion.\n\nA: I think I can get you started, but using terminal commands, which you said you'd prefer to avoid. Apologies, but it might give you a starting point. All of the following you could put in a bash script and run as a login item. \nYou'll need to first share out the target drive(s) (MyBook in the examples below) using file sharing (System Preferences > Sharing > check the File Sharing box, add the drives you need and set appropriate permissions - I just use Everyone to keep it simple).\nYou can mount a remote machine and/or its associated drives using mount like so:\nMake a directory as the mount point (obviously call test whatever you want):\nmkdir /Volumes/test\n\nNow mount the remote drive. I'm assuming this is already connected to your iMac and appears when you connect to your iMac using Finder:\nmount -t afp afp://<your mac's name>/<drive name to mount> /Volumes/test\n\nOn my remote Mac Mini, to connect to my MyBook attached to it via USB, that would be:\nmount -t afp afp://bobs-mac-mini/MyBook /Volumes/test\n\nIf you need to authenticate (I got error -5000 when trying to mount my home folder), you can also do this using\nmount -t afp afp://<username>:<password>@<your mac's name>/<drive name to mount> /Volumes/test\n\nHowever, the password would unfortunately have to be in the clear. So again, this might be:\nmount -t afp afp://binarybob:password123@bobs-mac-mini/MyBook /Volumes/test\n\nYou can also connect to your home folder using the above method, just by replacing MyBook with the name of your home folder.\nThe drive you mounted should now appear in the finder and you should be able to use it like any other locally mounted drive. When you're finished, you can do:\numount /Volumes/test\n\nto remove it.

Does anyone know of a USB floppy drive model that can read old 400K & 800K Classic Mac OS (HFS) floppies? I have an Iomega Floppy Plus, but it can only read 1.44MB HFS floppies.\n\nA: It looks like you are going to need to use an older Mac to read the disks, due to the complexities involved with the variable speed drives used to format those disk, unless you want to re-program your floppy drive. I am not sure if you can do it with the Iomega drive especially since its USB, you would probably have to take it apart to do the next option.\nAccording to this forum there is a way to control a floppy drive to get it to read those 400/800K disks. So it looks like you need a internal floppy drive and KryoFlux a USB-based floppy controller. Note This is going to require some hacking fun to accomplish...\nIf that is not your thing, then you should find an old Mac with a floppy drive to read the files and move them to more modern media via networking / apple-share etc. I am not sure what model of macs with floppy drives could read and write 400K and 800K disks, so there is another question to ask, and here is the answer Floppy Drive Observations: A Compleat Guide to Mac Floppy Drives and Disk Formats. So it looks like any Mac with a SuperDrive 1.44 MB type floppy drive will work at reading those older 400K and 800K diskettes. \nFYI, a really good source on this information relating to the Mac 400/800K drives.

My CDMA iPhone 4 (model MC677LL) running iOS 5.0.1 (9A405) doesn't have any problems connecting to my Time Capsule's Wifi Network (firmware: 7.6.1), but most of the time, the connection doesn't seem to be of any use. The phone shows good signal strength, but attempts to use that connection- Mobile Safari, Tweetbot, syncing OmniFocus- mostly time out. Note: the connection will still work for laptops/desktops running OS X while the phone is having problems.\nThis used to happen before updating to iOS 5, fwiw.\nThe only other thing that might be of any use in diagnosing this is knowing that I also have an Airport Express (firmware 7.6.1) in the living room which joins the Time Capsule's network so I can AirPlay right to the stereo.\nTo fix this, I've tried: \n\n\n*\n\n*switching the connection's DNS server(s) between the Time Capsule (10.0.1.1) and Google's DNS (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4), plus switching the Time Capsule's DNS server(s) between the default for my ISP and Google.\n\n*Forgetting the network on the phone\n\n*Doing a hard reset on the phone\n\n*Hitting \"Renew Lease\" on the connection through the Settings panel on the phone\n\n*Switching the Time Capsule's wireless settings from a specific radio channel to automatic and back again\n\n*Turning interference robustness on and off\nLike I said, though, the problem isn't that I can't connect. The problem seems to be a level or two up from connecting, but I can't think of any way to diagnose that. I guess the next time I catch it happening, I can try opening a site in Mobile Safari using a known IP address, but where could I go from there?\nI'd love to get some good recommendations for diagnosing this on a deep technical level, including suggestions for specific tools, or links to helpful walkthroughs.\n\nA: Have you tried testing the connection coming straight from the modem? The only good way to really test this is by connecting a computer directly to the modem over ethernet and seeing what kind of connection you have.\nDoes Airplay work for you? If so, another reason why I think there's nothing wrong with the router. Have you done a hard restart of your modem. Try that first as it's the resist thing to do.\n\nA: Switched wireless security on the Time Capsule from WPA/WPA2 Personal to straight WPA2 4 days ago and haven't had this problem since.\n", "Q: How do I restore a jailbroken iPhone 3G?

The preferences in question let you allow or deny each cookie, domain-by-domain and get IE to remember the setting for each domain.\nIs there an extension for safari that will emulate this behaviour?\nIn essence, I want to be prompted when whatever.doubleclick.net tries to save a cookie and tell safari to reject the cookie, and all cookies for that domain.\n\nA: Safari Cookies (10.5-10.6?)\n...is a cookie manager that I've used in the past. It's the only cookie manager I know of for Safari. I couldn't install it in Lion just now. I assume this is because they released a non-free version for lion.\nI don't recall whether this extension prompts the user when cookies are stored. Features which you need are:\n\n*\n\n*Automatic mode: Only keep cookies/Flash cookies/Databases from sites which are in your Favorites, BookMarks, Top Sites, or History.\n\n*Save favorite cookies to a whitelist.\n\nUsing the latter feature, you will accept cookies on a per website basis - not per cookie basis. This allows you to block vast amounts of cookies without spending too much time managing them.\nThe developers have released a version for Lion which is not free:\nCookie (Mac App Store)\nYou can download a trial on their website.\nOther stuff\nAlso consider the following extensions to block cookies and protect privacy.\n\n*\n\n*Ghostery: Full detection of tracker scripts, img tags, and iframes from over 600 data collection services.     Blocking capability for each detected element.\n\n*Adblock: Hides ads and also prevents some related cookies from being download. You can include lists which will allow you to block more than just ads. E.g. EasyPrivacy List, Antisocial List, Malware Domains List.\n\n*Incognito: Incognito protects your privacy by blocking Google Adsense and Google Analytics on non-Google pages. In addition, it allows you to optionally block Facebook and Twitter content on third-party websites as well as embedded YouTube movies outside of the YouTube website. Google also provides other extensions to opt-out of their tracking. However they are not yet available for Safari. (IBA Opt-Out, Keep my Opt-Outs)\n\n*Google Analytics Opt-out (beta): Official Google extension.

How do I keep it open?\n\nA: When you double click a .command in the Finder, the Terminal opens and runs /path/to/your.command ; exit; The exit at the end exits the shell, and you have Terminal's preferences set to close the window when this happens.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Terminal -> Preferences -> Settings -> Whichever Theme is marked as the Default -> Shell -> When the shell exits: and choose \"Don't close the window\".\n\n\nAlternatively, if you don't want to change Terminal's preferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your command outputs something to STDOUT that you want to read after the command exits, you can pipe the command's output through less, which will then stay open allowing you to scroll around through the output with the arrow keys until you quit it with q. Just add |less to the end of the command in your script.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\n\n*\n\n*Found a more flexible option. If piping something through less isn't practical for whatever reason, or your script is too complicated, you can add a last command that waits for input from the user before completing.

As a result there is some confusion.\n\nLion’s new way of arranging and sorting in Finder\nIn previous versions of Mac OS X, the Arrange By function in Finder simply changed the order in which files and folders were displayed based on the user’s selection. In OS X 10.7 Lion, there are two ways to sort: Arrange By and Sort By. Arrange By now groups files and folders into categories.\n\nAn arragement is set on the list view and that is why the directory looks abnormal. To re-enable column header that can sort one needs to first un-set the currently selected arrangement.\nA way to stop the arrangement of a list view:\n\n*\n\n*While in a Finder window with an arrangement set, select the \"View\" drop down menu on the menu bar and select \"Show View Options\"  or type Command+ J\n\n\n*Under Arrange By: pop-up menu select \"None\".\n\n\n*Now the Finder window should have the clickable column headers as expected in a list view.\n\nA: In the Finder window, \n\n\n*\n\n*under the Gear Symbol \"Actions\" \n\n*select \"Show View Options\" at the bottom of the drop-down.  \n\n*From the new pop up window, you can change the default view options to \"Arrange by: None\" & \"Sort by: Name\" (or any other method)\n\n", "Q: What's the equivalent of windows explorer?

I came from Windows and Linux to OSX and i thought maybe it is possible to simply change the bootloader config after copying all system files to the SSD like in GRUB?\n\nA: I believe that simply copying the files manually won't be enough. I'd use SuperDuper for getting a \"true\" clone of the old drive.\n\nA: Doing a copy will not make the drive bootable. There are all kinds of hidden files and \"blessing\" that needs to be done to make it bootable. For a really good description, see What makes a volume bootable?  And yes, programs like Carbon Copy Cloner and SuperDuper! make this task very easy. Additionally, programs like those will let you select and choose what files and folders you do not want to copy to the SSD, if you are in a situation where you need to cut down on things to fit everything on the SSD.\nAdditionally, you can use the built-in Disk Utility program  if your current disk is smaller than the new SSD. Using the Restore tab. Select your old volume as the source and select the new SSD as the destination, and that should work as well, but the above choices are the best way to proceed, since they are more polished for the task. \nAlso, there is \"One More Thing\" and it's kind of important. Since this is Mac OS X Lion we are talking about.  To truly get a complete Lion installation copied over to the SSD, we should account for the hidden lion recovery partition. I can't say for sure, but I think if you use CCC or SD! and pick the disk aka \"Macintosh HD\" and say copy that to disk \"mySDD\", it's going to miss the lion recovery partition.

Also, there is no menu item for which I could create an overwrite of the default behaviour by adding a new shortcut.\nIt is quite difficult to teach a new trick to an old dog, so I appreciate any help that would point me in the right direction. By the way, I am using Lion.\n\nA: According to this blog post, you can create a file called ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.Dict (you might have to create the KeyBindings folder in your Library folder).\nIn that file, you need the following content:\n{\n   \"@\\UF702\"  = \"moveWordBackward:\";\n   \"@\\UF703\"  = \"moveWordForward:\";    \n}\n\n(see the linked blog post for other Windows features you might want to recreate)\nNot all programs that use text fields will use the default keybindings, but this will help with many programs.\n", "Q: How do you extend the time required to trigger hot corner actions? I like the concept of hot corner actions but the trigger time for hot corner actions is too quick for me to make good use of them.

I'd be inclined to start a new question once you have more details and have narrowed down the issue.\n", "Q: Remotely brick a stolen iPhone or iPad I asked a similar question on android.stackexchange.com and I'd like to see how the answer compares for iOS devices:\nIf my iPhone is stolen, can I remotely brick the thing, so resale value drops to zero?\nFor apps like Apple's Find My Phone, how feasible is it for a thief to remove the apps? The answer to this sort of motivates my asking the first question about bricking. The more possible it is to remove the remote tracking/data erasing apps, the higher incentive I might have to just brick the thing, cut my losses, and deprive the thief of any profit from his/her crime.\n\nA: Before iOS 7 this was not possible or feasible since iTunes would restore an image of the OS that would be free from any locking. Now there is Activation Lock which neatly pre-empts any attempt to remove the Find My iPhone feature of iCloud. Effectively, with Find my iPhone, your device is effectively locked to your Apple ID.\nFor iOS 7 and later - enable Find My iPhone to prevent anyone else from erasing or using the device.\n\n\nIf my iOS 6 or less iPhone is stolen, can I remotely brick the thing, so resale value drops to zero?\n\nNo.\nThe best you can do is to wipe the data from the device with an app like Find My iPhone from Apple or the open source Prey application. The device will no longer contain your applications or personal data, but it will still function normally and the thief could then initialize it for their own use.\n\nFor apps like Apple's Find My Phone, how feasible is it for a thief to remove the apps?\n\nWithout wiping the device? Hard to impossible. And that's the whole point of these applications: to keep your data safe and the cost of losing the hardware. You're essentially cleaning it for them and getting it ready for their use or resale. But you're ensuring that they can't gain access to your personal data, your PayPal account, your bank accounts and anything else you might have your phone connected to.\nIn the UK, cell phone carriers will blacklist phones that are reported stolen so they can't be used on the network again. The bigger UK carriers do it. Not sure how common a practice it is in North America, or if carriers here are willing to do it all.\n\nA: In the US, CDMA carriers (Sprint, Verizon) can blacklist the hardware. GSM carriers (AT&T) cannot (read: won't) do anything - if a thief has your stuff, they can do an iTunes restore, insert a new SIM and have a new phone. It's happened to me twice.\nYour idea does sound really good though. I wouldn't be surprised if the jailbreak community has come up with a remote \"self-destruct\" button in case your hardware is stolen. Find my iPhone is more of a novelty than a tool. Law enforcement cannot use the location to get a warrant, so it still leads to nowhere...unless you're into vigilante justice \n¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nA: Since this question has already been bumped back to the front page, I might as well add some new information.\nIn the iOS 7 preview, Apple demoed a feature called Activation Lock. From the iOS 7 features page:\n\nNew security features in iOS 7 make it harder for anyone who’s not you to use or sell your device. Now turning off Find My iPhone or erasing your device requires your Apple ID and password. Find My iPhone can also continue to display a custom message, even after your device is erased. And your Apple ID and password are required before anyone can reactivate it. Which means your iPhone is still your iPhone. No matter where it is.\n\n(Emphasis mine) If you remotely wiped a stolen device (to avoid loss of private data), the phone would prompt a thief to enter your Apple ID and password before it would reactivate. If they don’t know them, then the device is effectively bricked.\niOS 7 is still in developer preview and features are subject to change, but since that was mentioned in the WWDC keynote, I’d guess it’s here to stay. It also means that nobody has given Activation Lock a thorough testing, to see how easily it can be bypassed (or they have, but haven’t spoken about it because of the NDA). I would guess it will probably be beyond your common thief, thus providing an effective bricking mechanism.\n\nA: unfortunately this is not true  all they have to do is put the phone into recovery mode plug it into the computer and re-download the latest IOS no passwords are required and poof they have a working iPhone then even if you've call Verizon or sprint to have a phone blacklisted there is an computer program that will un-blacklist it the best thing I can tell you is to look online immediately find out where your phone is and then go there immediately with cash in hand & buy your phone back.\n\nA: If a law enforcement officer contacts Apple, as long as they have the serial number of the device, Apple can and will upon law enforcement request permanently brick the device and render it permanently useless through software. \n", "Q: Application Switcher is minimizing apps At some point when I reinstalled Mac OS X Lion, the application switcher started minimizing apps so that when I switch to one all others minimize.  \nThis causes problems when working with my developer IDE and a browser.

I didn't use to have any problems, but as of recently I am running into gaps/skips in the sound. This happens mostly in third party music players (including flash/youtube videos) although I see it in iTunes, just less often. I know my headset is ok, because it works perfectly with my phone. Also, interference is unlikely the problem, since the headset works well with the phone one foot away from MacBook, and one would think that whatever is interfering with the computer talking to the headphones would also mess with the connection to the phone. Anyway, I know it's a Bluetooth issue because I have absolutely no problems with wired headphones. That said, I have no idea where to start debugging it. I played with all the Bluetooth options I could find, and reset everything to factory defaults (erasing all devices and re-pairing) yet to no avail. \nOn top of this, maybe related or maybe not (this is an older problem) the Bluetooth audio connection sometimes becomes \"garbled\". What I mean by this is that, whenever  music is playing on the computer I just hear crazy digital noise on the headphones. No errors, no nothing, just continuous garble. I have to turn off Bluetooth on the computer and re-connect to make it go away.\nIs there anything else I can do, or am I stuck with using wired headphones with my MacBook? \n\nA: The best step to isolating your issue would be to collect some data about the bluetooth environment where you are using your mac. Radio waves come and go with other devices, new phones, degrading antennas and changes in bluetooth firmware.\nThe Bluetooth Explorer is the best tool I have found to troubleshoot bluetooth hardware and data. It's free as part of Xcode from the Mac App Store.\nYou can debug data issues, see the protocols that connected devices are using, and get to all manner of engineering data relating to bluetooth such as errors, relative signal strength indication (RSSI). It's hard to tell if this will help you, but it lets me know when a microwave or home phone was causing noise issues on several occasions when my hardware was otherwise working properly.\n\n\nA: My bluetooth audio over AptX was choppy, too. This fixed it for me:\ndefaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent \"Apple Bitpool Min (editable)\" 53\n\nAnother great hint I found is to alt(option)-click the bluetooth icon on the top menu bar of os x: Then navigate to the bluetooth music device on that menu and it will show you the type of codec being used (atpX in my case).\nThank you bmike♦ for the hint to using Connection Quality Window of Bluetooth Explorer! Thanks to it, I was able to determine what's the best position for my bluetooth audio receiver[1]. Surprisingly enough, the best position was on one of it's narrow sides! The position that it is designed to be in doesn't actually give the best RSSI :P\n[1] ProCaster Bluetooth Audio Receiver BT-02\n\nA: I have also suffered 'popping' and crackling using a Bluetooth stereo headphones on a MacBook Air running Lion.  The headphones work perfectly when paired with other devices such as my iPhone 4.\nI have had substantial improvement by reducing microphone input sensitivity. Open the  'open sound preferences' submenu under your bluetooth devices, and reduce microphone sensitivity to zero.\n\nA: Run all the related processes on a higher priority:\nI made a script to do that: https://gist.github.com/redolent/61e5db9d9685689e21e7\n#!/bin/bash\n\nlist=\"$(\n    sudo ps -A \\\n    | grep -iE '([h]ear|[f]irefox|[b]lue|[c]oreaudiod)' \\\n    | cut -c 1-90\n    )\"\n\n\npids=$( cut -c 1-6 <<< \"$list\" )\n\n\necho sudo renice -5 $pids\nsudo renice -5 $pids\n\n\nA: Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect the bt-keybord, the bt-trackpad, the bt-mouse and all the other bluetooth devices one by one while listening the bt-speakers.\n(While doing this, in my case, I discovered that the bt keyboard is interfering, and when I disconnect it, I start hearing the bt speaker working fine.)\n\n*Then, re-connect the bt devices one by one, and you may see that things continue to work fine on the bt-speakers. \nI don't know exactly what happens in my case, but maybe, the bt-keyboard reallocate itself to another \"free channel\" or something that does not interfere with the already connected bt peripherals. \nThis solved the problem for me.\nI suspect that also the wifi may cause interferences, so while trying to find the responsible of the issue, you may also try to disable the wifi devices while listeing the bt-speakers to identify the guilty device.\n\nA: OK, so after a whole lot of debugging and reading internet forums, I came to the conclusion that this is a hardware issue. Apparently the bluetooth cable/antenna in a 2009 unibody macbook is inside the screen assembly, on the same cable as the iSight. A while back I replaced the LCD, so I must have nicked the cable/antenna while doing this. I am not opening the display all over again just to fix this, I just got a bluetooth dongle that works flawlessly --- that's how I know it's not a software problem, since I'm pretty sure OS X uses the same bluetooth stack for both transmitters.\n\nA: Go to a store and buy USB bluetooth dongle (I bought the smallest I could find for $8). Plug it in and MacBook automatically shuts down onboard Bluetooth and uses the new USB. After that the music plays perfectly without any stutters at all!\n\nA: My speakers were set as an input device. \nChanging this back in SystemPreferences > Sound > Input fixed things.\n\n\nA: I have the same issues and have determined that the bluetooth antenna location in my mid 2012 MB Pro is the culprit.  I have an Apple BT keyboard and Apple BT Magic Mouse.  It is not capable of streaming the BT audio satisfactorily to my 3rd party BT speaker.  I've attempted to back off both the keyboard and mouse, but alas, this defeats the reason for them.\nInterestingly enough, I'm able to stream beautifully to the 3rd party BT speaker with either my iPhone 5s or my mini iPad.  This is the case whether I have WiFi enabled or not.\nNasty flaw in El Capital 10.11.5\n\nA: I uninstalled Avira antivirus software and the choppiness immediately went away.\n\nA: My issue has been solved! I have a Huawei Bluetooth Mouse, it uses 2,4GHz too.\nAfter disabling that I have no audio problems anymore.\nI'm checking how to solve the issue between them, but I know what is the root cause.\nThank you\nMOV\n\nA: In my case it seems that turning WIFI off/on helps.\nHoping that this is the only cause.\n\nA: I had the same problem and tried tons of different solutions. After a lot of tries, this solved it:\nGo to:  → System Preferences → General and uncheck the option Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices.\n\nA: I stopped leaving my phone on top of my laptop. Turns out that the phone's bluetooth adapter messes up the signal b/n the laptop and my headphones. Another more crude solution is to turn off the phone's bluetooth.\n", "Q: Safari keeps refreshing itself Safari is keep refreshing itself multiple times a day which is quite annoying. \nIt prompts a message to me: \"Force Reload\" and then it reloads every tab in every window. This is unacceptable.\nAny idea what is going wrong? \n(Safari 5.1.3 / OS X Lion 10.7.3)\n\nA: Safari on Lion exhibits similar behaviour to on IOS, in that it can decide to arbitrarily drop a loaded page in order to save memory, regardless of the fact that you likely have many many more times more Ram than on your iPhone...\nWhen you switch back to a tab that has been dropped, it will then proceed to redownload it to get it back to how it was.

It doesn't matter which version you start or end with; just end up with 10.6.6 or newer.\nApple only sells SnowLeopard (10.6) on DVD. I'm not aware of a legal download for SnowLeopard. I recently bought the DVD for a relative and it had an older version, like 10.6.3. I installed from the DVD, then updated to 10.6.8 with Software Update.

Can anyone suggest a command I could use which would match these files?\nFor example, I've tried\nfind -name *ü*\n\nhowever none of the files are matched. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: A somewhat dangerous solution is this, from the commandline:\nfind . -type f ! -regex '.*/[ -.0-~]*' -exec rm {} +\n\nReplace the lone . with the name of the top directory if you haven't changed to the relevant directory first. To be safe, however try first the shorter command\nfind . -type f ! -regex '.*/[ -.0-~]*'\n\nand ensure that it only lists files you wish to delete. The regular expression (regexp, or regex) here will match any pathname that ends in a slash followed by any combination of printable ASCII characters excluding /, the space characters being the first such and ~ the last, while . and 0 surround / in the ASCII sequence.\nOne caveat among many: I don't know for sure if your current locale might change the collating sequence of characters, and hence perhaps change the meaning of the regexp. I don't think it does, but if it does, running the commands as\nLC_COLLATE=C find …\n\nshould remove the danger.\nYet another caveat: Please ensure you have a backup before you try this. I will not take the blame for any loss of data if you get it wrong. The commandline is a great tool for shooting yourself in the foot! Sometimes just a misplaced space can spell disaster. (In this case, for example, missing the single space after the left bracket is deadly.)\n\nA: It seems that your problem is related to the difference of display of characters in both the terminal and the Finder. I'd suggest going into the directory where any of the files you want to remove resides and issue an ls to find if the filename in the UNIX environment matches that of the Finder's.\nI find the above suggested solution a bit confusing. So my version of the find command would take two steps:\nfind . -name \"*ü*\" -print\nThis would print out the files that match. \nfind . -name \"*ü*\" -delete\nThis would delete the files that match after you check that none of the files you need are listed in the previous print out.\nYou should also take into account the various LC_* environment settings that are involved here, as per @Harald Hanche-Olsen,  and what kind of effect\nit has on the find command. Not to mention the Terminal display encoding settings.\n\nA: You can try another way by using 'A better Finder Rename' (Link). It has the benefit of a Preview Pane, Presets and Multi-Step Actions. You can use the free Trial to experiment. \n\n", "Q: How can I initiate a Google Voice phone call from the command line? Thanks to Brett Terpstra I can easily send an SMS through Google Voice in Terminal, but now I want to be able to initiate a phone call via Termainal too.\nThere is no Google Voice API (yet?) so I know there is no official way to do it, but I'm hoping that perhaps someone else has had this same issue and already found a solution.\nA proper solution would have to not only let me say which number I want to call, but also which number Google Voice should use to call me.\n(For those unfamiliar with Google Voice, calls are initiated by your phone receiving an incoming call from Google's servers, and then you are connected to the number that you wanted to call.)\nI took a look on Github, but the only potential solution I found was https://github.com/tylerhall/google-voice-dialer which hasn't been updated in 2 years, and I'm not sure how to use it.\n\nA: You can find the google voice command line script Here\nWith it, you can simply type \n./googlevoice.pl call 12345678\n\nTo do a call.

This totals to just under $60.\nThe other alternative is buying Lion on a USB sick. It's $69 here. According to the page, Apple seems to want you to buy Snow Leopard before using the USB installer (although you should be fine skipping SL technically), making this even more expensive.\nIf you really want to have a physical USB disk with Lion, you can make your own either before or after you install using instructions you can easily find here (on Ask Different) or elsewhere on the Internet.\n", "Q: How do I burn a bootable CD from a .toast file? I bought a used G3 couple of days ago and I want to reinstall Mac OS 9. I got the OS in .toast format. Any knows how I make that into bootable CD? Just burning with Disk Utility didn't work, although there might be a way to use that which I don't know.\n\nA: Yup, just use Toast Titanium and burn the .toast file to a CD. That will create a bootable CD that will be usable on your G3.\nBurn is a free application for burning CDs/DVDs. I don't know if it supports .toast files, but give it a try if you don't have Toast, since it may save you from buying it. I couldn't find online documentation for it, so let me know how it works.\n", "Q: What's the best way to login to remote servers? I'm currently logging in to a remote server by opening terminal, starting ssh-agent, adding a key, launching xterm and then connecting via ssh.\nWhat tools should I be using for this?  I've looked at keychain, but the docs don't explain how to use it for ssh.\n\nA: It should Just Work. In more detail: First, don't run ssh-agent yourself, since launchd will run it for you on demand. Make sure your private ssh key is in ~/.ssh/ with appropriate permissions, i.e., not readable by anybody but yourself:\n; ls -l .ssh/id_dsa\n-rw-------  1 user  13799  736 Oct 12  2001 .ssh/id_dsa\n\nNow run ssh remote-hostname. A dialog should pop up to let you unlock the key. The dialog has a check button for storing the pass phrase in your keychain. Check it, and hit OK. (You need to do this with /usr/bin/ssh, I think, and not any ssh that you might have from macports or fink.) If you don't get the dialog, it could be that ssh needs to be told about the name and location of your private key. If so, specify it using the -i flag, as in\nssh -i .ssh/id_dsa remote-hostname\n\n", "Q: When my external display is on, my Mac thinks it's off.

I have rules in outlook that routes certain emails to folders. These still appear as \"unread\" in the mail app, but not in the inbox, so I'm not getting notifications. Is there a way to enable notifications for new, unread emails that are not in the inbox folder?\n\nA: There is not a native way to do this in iOS, but there are many possibilities for workarounds. Here's one:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up Boxcar and install the helper app on your iDevice.\n\n*Create a rule in Boxcar telling the helper app to get a push notification every time a message is received at the forwarding address provided. If you need help with this, see this help article.\n\n*Create a rule (or whatever they're called in your email service) which automatically forwards folders' new messages to the Boxcar address.\nIf this fix doesn't suit you, you may want to do a similar thing with ifttt.\n\nA: I have test in iOS 9.3 but surely this will be available in previous version as well.

I am trying to delete a friend's old email address so it doesn't automatically pop up when I enter his name while addressing an email. I have removed it manually from the address book, but it still shows up in Mail.\nHow do I stop this happening?\n\nA: Under Mail's \"Window\" menu select \"Previous Recipients\" and you can delete any address you don't want.\n\nA: *\n\n*Fire up a \"New Message\" from the File menu (or use command + N)\n\n*Begin typing the address\n\n*When Mail starts to complete the address you want, hit the Return key to tell Mail to go ahead and auto-complete the address\n\n*Hover the mouse pointer over the address; a blue arrow will show up on the right hand side.\n\n*Click on the arrow, which brings up a drop-down menu. The menu contains several options, one of which is \"Remove address.\" Click it, and it will remove the address from auto-complete.\n\n\nA: When the suggestion appears, just use the navigation to reach it then press delete on it, that's it.\n\nA: I just wanted to add a note here that it is apparently not possible to delete previous recipients on iOS.\n\nA: This only works to effectively \"hide\" the previous recipient from the previous recipients list on your phone.  Apple still keeps a file with all your previous recipients in iCloud.  When you completely \"Erase all Content and Settings\" and set up as a new phone, then sign in to iCloud all the previous recipients are restored.\nIn other words you have to do this painful process of deleting every previous recipient you don't want in the list individually every time you get a new iPhone/iPad or otherwise want to start from scratch and do a complete erase on your current device, even if you set up as a new device.  This is easily replicated and proved.  In fact I intend to go to an Apple Shop soon to demonstrate and question the behaviour and whether it's possible for Apple to delete information about who I've emailed.\nThe inconvenience is one thing but I'm more concerned about the privacy implications that Apple keeps a \"previous recipients\" master file that you don't have access to and whose entries can't be deleted.  A similar situation exists for Mail on OS X though it appears to be a different previous recipients master file.  That is, every time I do a clean install of OS X or even set up a new account and log in to iCloud, the Mail app shows a bunch of previous email recipients that aren't present in any email message!\nFantastic information for the government along with all your other metadata.\n\nA: To delete a person’s old email address, in Mail  go to the ‘Window’ drop down menu (just before 'Help') and click ‘Previous Recipients’.\nThen click on the old email address you want deleted and click the ‘Remove from List’ button.\n", "Q: Connecting to a remote machine with a public key using Fugu How do I connect to a remote server with a public key using Fugu?

When you get that ready and can successfully connect to your EC2 server via ssh in Terminal, then you can use Fugu for further file transfers.\nIn the main Fugu window, if you expand \"Advanced SFTP Options\", you'll see a field where you can enter Additional SSH options.  You could enter something like:\n-i ~/.ec2/ec2-keypair\nto indicate the appropriate ssh key to use.

They can be synced with any device (up to 10) that is authorized to the ID.\nThis is an extract from the apple support website:\n\nIf you want to transfer iTunes Store purchases from an iOS device or\n  iPod to a computer, be sure to authorize the computer before\n  connecting the device.\n...\nImportant: Clicking Erase and Sync will delete any existing content\n  currently on your device. The content will be replaced with whatever\n  existing content is in the current iTunes library your device is\n  connected to. If there is no content in the iTunes library, nothing\n  will be synced to your device, and your device will be empty.\niTunes\n  will begin copying any purchases made with any account for which the\n  computer is authorized.\n\nJailbreaking might offer possibilities to bypass the restrictions, but it'll be against apple's licensing terms (copying the content to unauthorized devices that is).\nI believe this would require to jailbreak iTunes on your Mac aswell for syncing to work - and I do not know if there are solutions to this.\n", "Q: Why firefox 10.1 uses full screen on Snow Leopard while Chrome and Safari do not? I am new to the Mac World, I am stuck with the fact that on my 15 inch Mac Book Pro only Firefox 10.1 uses all the screen, while Chrome and Safari only use a portion of it. Chrome is the thing I miss most because it's the browser I usually use. \nHow do I set it to use the full screen space?\nI use Snow Leopard 10.6.8\n\nA: I love Divvy - it's something that I feel OSX needs and that would allow you to set a shortcut for it. Otherwise the green orb on the top left will take you to full height, and then you can drag out horizontally to your chosen width. \nAlternatively, should you upgrade to Lion, Chrome has a full-screen mode which hides all the other apps. \n\nA: Mac OS X doesn't resize windows like Windows when maximized. Logically, having a browser window take up an entire screen is very verrrrryyy inefficient, since you end up with the two blank spaces on both sides. OS X makes a window big enough to show the content, but no bigger as to prevent wasting of screen space.\nYou can of course look for utilities to restore a more windows familiar feel - some I am aware of are moom, cinch, and divvy.

Not on a regular basis (daily/weekly/monthly etc) but as and when we're sure the update isn't going to break stuff...\nMy question is a little more general than that: how should I schedule one off jobs like this? Presumably more than one way of going about it, interested to hear what people think, whether it's scripting it or 3rd party utilities, whatever.\n\nA: There are 3 options I can think of, all of which rely on your setup/tools you have. For this, I am also assuming you are working with Mac servers. \n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Remote Desktop and Scheduled Tasks\n\n*iCal and alarms\n\n*the bash 'at' command. \n\n\nApple Remote Desktop\nARD will allow you to run tasks on remote machines, and they can be either done instantly or at a scheduled future time. You could create your task that you need to run, click on the machine you want to run it on, select the task, then schedule it for when needed. This queues up the task for that time. More details on how to use ARD to do this are available on Apple's website under RemoteDesktop 3.0 help. I no longer have ARD to verify, but I think the remote task is queued on that machine, and therefore ARD does not need to be running on your machine to run the update.\niCal and Alarms\niCal will allow you to add an event that can execute a script at a defined time. \nYou do this by adding an event in iCal, and where the Alarm option is for the event, you can select Run Script, and then pull up the AppleScript you would like to run. \nThere are pitfalls with this. The local computer you are on (that had iCal) would need to be able to connect to the remote machine, and most likely be awake (I have not tested if this will wake the machine to run). This is also much less reliable than the ARD or 'at' option (I assume this was made for users to simply automate something on their machine, versus a sysadmin tool).\nThe 'at' command\nThe bash 'at' command will allow you to run a task at a specified time. You will need to make a bash shell script for your task, and then save it, as well as set the correct execution/permission settings. Once that is done, you can use the 'at' command to schedule it, using something like: \nat -f updatesoftware.sh -v 10:30\nThe script should then execute and send you feedback if mail is set up correctly. According to this site, you need to make sure you enable 'at' on the Mac though, using the following command:\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.atrun.plist \nI would review the man page (using man at) to determine the exact configuration you prefer. Using this option though, you can schedule the task on the particular machine you want to run on, therefore taking extra machines (like the previous two examples) out of the equation. \n\nA: I'd probably use a combination of a bash script and the 'at' command; if your tasks are generic enough you could build a small library of task scripts to pull from when you needed to run a job.\n", "Q: How to assign to the \"home\" key the action \"Go to the start of line\" Globally Is there a way in which I can replicate the Windows way of going to the start of line by using home and not ⌘ + ← ? \nI did it in Eclipse, but I'd rather do it globally.

From it I found the script that applies sed to the track names. Once you follow the instructions to install the script, put the following code in the popup box:\ns/\\([:alpha:]\\)+ \\([:digit:]+\\) \\([:digit:]+\\)/\\3 \\1 \\2/ \n\nN.B. This is actually the first time I've used sed, so I recommend testing this out on a few individual songs first. \n(Also, if you don't have any programming experience, then it's likely that the Regular Expression above looked downright arcane. Don't worry! That's totally normal.)\n\nA: You should check out Doug's Applescripts for iTunes.

Does anyone know a mac app for converting a movie (.mov) to a series of images ? I know quicktime could do this in the olden days, but that features has been deleted.\n\nA: Yup, you still can do it with Quicktime Player. Download it from here. I believe you can also install it from the Snow Leopard install disc. I'm not sure about the Lion install download. \nOpen the movie and click File>Export:\n\nThen you can select Movie to Image Sequence:\n\nSet your destination folder and watch Quicktime Player do its magic.\n\n\nA: You can also use ffmpeg:\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -r 0.05 image_sequence%06d.png\n\n-r 0.05 = 0.05 Hz = 3 images per minute.

Is there a way to preserve their location after the restart?\n\nA: Ok, I found a solution that's working for me, and now my application windows doesn't switch Desktop randomly on restart.\nFor the two desktop setup as in the question, first I go to the desktop where I want to stick an application window. Say, we want to stick web browser to desktop 1, we \n\n\n*\n\n*go to desktop 1, \n\n*open the application on this desktop, \n\n*right click on the application icon on the dock, then Options > Assign to > This desktop\n\n*similarly, stick applications on desktop 2\n\n\nNow, after system restart, the applications are starting where they were sticked! \n\nA: Have you considered using Divvy to keep all your windows in check ?\n\nA: That is a bug that needs to be fixed by Apple. What also happens that switching between applications on different desktops would switch to that desktop and the application's menu would be displayed, but none of the application's windows would be coming to the front. To add to that, also the Finder wouldn't stick to the option of \"All Desktops\" at random times as far as my poor attention to what caused it goes.\nIf Divvy is free maybe you should give it a try until that bug is fixed.\n", "Q: How can I edit a .docx file in Dropbox on my iPad? I have all my papers in a .docx on Dropbox and I'd like to be able to edit them on my iPad. How do I do this? All the free editors I've tried only support reading .docx files and they don't have formatting.\n\nA: I suggest QuickOffice Pro HD for iPad. It will allow you to connect to Dropbox and edit any Microsoft Office file.\n\nA: Possibly a suggestion moving forward, if you change those .docx files to .doc, there are many more programs out there that can edit the files, e.g., Pages. \nIf you prefer to stay with .docx, previously mentioned QuickOffice Pro HD is a great solution, Documents to Go Premium is another solution and CloudOn also tries to emulate the Office interface. CloudOn is still pretty new and a bit buggy, but it's free and may help in a pinch. I found myself in the same situation with school and found that batch editing my .docx files to .doc was well worth it in the end. Hope this helps!\n", "Q: Does Time Machine Copy Renamed Files? Okay - so I have a relatively simple question but can't find a clear answer.\nSay for instance I have a large video file in FolderA named something.avi.  Time Machine then makes a pass and backs this up.  Afterwards, I rename this file somethingelse.avi.\nDoes Time Machine physically copy all of this data a second time, or does it create a new link with the changed file name, which points to the data which has already been copied?\n\nA: Anytime you make a change to a file Time Machine makes a new copy of the file:\nJohn Siracusa's Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard: the Ars Technica review/Time Machine:\n\nIt's unfortunate that Time Machine's cleverness does not extend just a bit further. The smallest unit of data that Time Machine will backup is an individual file. That means that if you change one byte in a 10GB file, that entire 10GB file needs to be copied to the backup volume. Hard link can't help you here. There's no way to make a hard link to \"9.99999GB of the old data, plus this one byte of new data.\"\n\nThe beauty of Time Machine is that it automatically deletes the older copies of files from the backup when it needs to recover the space.\n", "Q: How can I screen share and use Pages? Via Remote Management (VNC) I am connecting to a virtual display on a Mac running Lion. VNC is working as expected, except Pages '09 documents show up blank. If, however VNC connects to the Mac and controls the physical display then Pages documents show up as expected.\nIs it possible to use Pages using a virtual display over VNC?\nVNC Clients that I've tested are: TightVNC & RealVNC running on Windows, or Apple's Screen Sharing app on Lion.\n\nA: Excuse the large picture, but I have used Screen Sharing to share the screen of an iMac running Lion and Pages '09 over the virtual display, and it works just fine.  I suspect that the assumed problem of with pages inability to work over a virtual VNC connection is not accurate, but there is something more local to your machine that needs attention.\n\n", "Q: Can I access my Time Capsule remotely if I haven't set it up at home? My Macbook has frozen on the start-up screen. I'm not sure if it's a serious fault or whether it just needs to re-start from a back-up, but I'm overseas at the moment & the back up is my Time Capsule at home. I need urgently to retrieve files from my Time Capsule. I'm aware that I could have set up my Time Capsule up to be accessed remotely before I left, &  I was wondering whether it is possible to set up remote access remotely, if that makes sense? \nThanks very much\n\nA: If You Have a Time Capsule or an AirPort Extreme Base Station with Shared USB Hard Drive \nIf you have either a Time Capsule (which is basically an AirPort Extreme Base Station with a built-in 500 GB or 1 TB hard drive) or an AirPort Extreme Base Station (AEBS) with an attached USB hard drive, you can share out the Time Capsule/AEBS hard drive and make it accessible via the Internet. To do this: \n\n\n*\n\n*Start the Airport Utility. \n\n*Select your Time Capsule or AEBS. Make a note of the IP Address shown on the right -- you will need it later. \n\n*Click Manual Setup. \n\n*Check your \"Connection Sharing\" setting under the Internet Tab. The following tutorial is valid if your \"Connection Sharing\" is to \"Share a public IP address\", the normal setup for a home network. You will need to have a static IP address, or use a free dynamic DNS service. If you have a different type of \"Connection Sharing,\" you probably don't need a tutorial to set up remote access to your disk; adapt this one as needed.\n\n*Click Disks (at the top of the dialog box), and then click File Sharing. \n\n*Select (check) the \"Enable file sharing\" checkbox and the \"Share disks over Ethernet WAN port\" checkbox. It is strongly recommended that you also set Secure Shared Disks to \"With base station password\" and Guest Access to \"Not allowed\"; not making these changes may allow unauthorized users to access your Time Capsule/AEBS hard drive. \n\n*Click Airport (at the top of the dialog box), and then click Base Station. \n\n*Enter a Base Station Password and verify it in the Verify Password box. \n\n*Click Advanced (at the top of the dialog box), and then click Port Mapping. \n\n*Click the plus sign (+) to add a new port mapping. \n\n*In the Public UDP Port(s) and Public TCP Port(s) boxes, type in a 4-digit port number (e.g., 5678) that you choose. In the Private IP Address box, type the internal IP address of your Time Capsule or AEBS that you wrote down in step 2 (for example, 192.168.0.1). In the Private UDP Port(s) and Private TCP Port(s) boxes, type 548. Click Continue. \n\n*In the Description box, type a descriptive name like \"Time Capsule File Sharing\" or \"AEBS File Sharing\". Then, click Done. \n\n*When you have made all changes, click Update. \nYour Time Capsule/AEBS will restart. Once it does, you are now ready to connect to the Time Capsule/AEBS hard drive via the Internet. To do this when your MBA is away from home: \n\n\n*\n\n*In the Finder, click Go > Connect to Server. \n\n*Type in the correct domain name or external IP address for your network, plus a colon and the port number you specified in step 11. For example, \"www.myhomedomain.com:5678\" or \"123.123.12.123:5678\". \n\n*Click Connect. \n\n*You will be prompted for your user name and password. The user name can be anything you like; the password should be the password for the Time Capsule/AEBS which you specified above. \n\n*Click Connect. \n\n\nVoilà! You are now connected to your Time Capsule/AEBS hard drive from your MBA. You can access files, copy files back and forth between your MBA and the hard drive, delete files, whatever you want, as long as your MBA remains network-connected. The next time you go to connect, it should go even more quickly (especially if you save your password in your keychain, and if you add your home IP address/domain name to your list of Favorite Servers in the Connect dialog box). \nNote that the Time Capsule/AEBS will appear in the Shared section of your Finder's sidebar as a server, with the Base Station Name of the Time Capsule/AEBS as the server name. \nTaken from http://forums.dealmac.com/read.php?4,2800627\n\nA: If you happen to know your home's public IP, you could try using Airport Utility and connecting to 'Other...', and using the public IP address. This may or may not work depending on port forwarding or if 'enable remote administration' is enabled. \nIf not, really the easiest other option is to call a trusted friend and have them do it for you. Airport Utility also works on Windows (the older version does), so you could have said trusted friend go by your house (even just staying outside), give them the credentials to log into your Time Capsule, enable disks (and maybe remote admin while at it). Then you can log in and change credentials once friend has enabled. \n", "Q: Install VMWare Workstation on Mac Boot Camp Can I install VMWare Workstation in a Mac's Boot Camp partition that has Windows 7 installed in it? Is there any technical restrictions? Will there be a problem if I load the Boot Camp partition in VMWare Fusion, after VMWare Workstation is installed?\nTks\n\nA: When in Boot Camp, you are running Windows 'on the metal', as in really no difference than Windows on any other PC, except on Mac hardware with some Apple drivers for that hardware (like fan control, iSight, etc). \nWith that in mind, there would be no issue with installing VMWare Workstation in Windows while in Boot Camp. \nAs for what happens when you launch the Boot Camp partition in VMWare Fusion, I have not tested that, and not entirely sure how it will work. I think that it will launch, and possibly even work (except for being rather slow, because you would start virtualizing while virtualizing). The only limitation I can think of is that if the hypvervisor has a way of knowing it is currently already using a VM, and therefore not able to virtualize again.\nOne advantage of using Fusion on the Mac though would be that they can use the same .vmdk files. Therefore, you theoretically could put the disk images on a shared disk (for example on the Boot Camp Partition itself, since the Mac can easily read it), and then launch the vmdk no matter which host you were using (Mac or Windows).\n\nA: I installed VMWare Workstation on my Boot Camp partition, and it worked fine. However, I cannot boot my Boot Camp partition from VMWare Fusion from my Mac anymore, because I get BSOD on Windows 7 when I try.\n", "Q: Can I see which iPad apps I use most frequently? I have many games on my iPad which my kids play.  I'd like to remove the games and apps that aren't used but I don't know how to find this information.\nIs there a way to see the most used apps on your iOS device?  Or possibly a list of apps with a \"last used\" data field?\n\nA: In a pinch, you could look through the multitasking bar that appears when you double-click the home button. The apps are arranged in order of most recently used. It is not a measure of how frequently an app is used, but it could at least tell you if it was used recently, or if other apps have been of more interest lately.\n\nA: If you're jailbroken, you can use one of a few Cydia tweaks:\n\n\n*\n\n*App Stat\nApp Stat is an extremely simple tweak which tracks how many times you've opened an app, how long you spent in the app, and the last time you opened it.\n\n\n*App Analytics\nA much better looking (paid) alternative to App Stat, which includes the same information and also lets you narrow down the results on a monthly basis.\n\n\nA: There is no facility to do this in stock iOS. I agree, this would be useful.\nThe most effective way to ask Apple for this sort of thing is through their bug reporter. Unfortunately, you need a (free) developer account to post a bug and you're not likely to get much of a response, so don't get your hopes up. \n\nA: In my business we reatinoalize old reports clients say they need.  At some point we reach the area called \"remove it and if no one complains, you really don't use it\"\nSince it is so easy to put them back on the ipad, this might not be a bad approach with the games\n\nA: You can always go to battery usage in settings and it will list the apps that have been used in the last 7 days and how long they have been used for. \n\nA: no unforitunetly not, however, if all of the apps which you use, all depend on data. you can use an app like Onavo to see witch app use most data, hence which app you use the \"most\" \nThis is not scientific, and results can vary because of numerous reasons but it might give you a better insight\n", "Q: Is it possible to clone the operating system to a different machine? I have spent a lot of time setting up a speech recognition profile which would be a pain to do all over again. I have configured this on a Mac mini. Suppose I now wish to buy a MacBook Air. Would it be possible to transfer my entire current setup including software and settings across to a different hardware platform?\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to clone the OS between machines. SuperDuper! or Carbon Copy Cloner are the recommended ways to do so. Make sure both machines are on the same OS version (i.e. 10.7.3) before you do so.\nHowever: Migration Assistant is really good.

The English language doesn't really include any accented words but other languages do.\nYet I like to write using accents and diacritics, as needed in each language (Romanian, French, German, etc.).\nUnfortunately Mac OS X has never really made it easy to accent a letter before. Lion has simplified it, now accenting a letter is easy thanks to the Accent Menu -- example:\n\nStill, if you take Romanian as an example, most of the specific diacritics are not reachable via the Accent Menu:\n\n\n*\n\n*a » ă\n\n*s » ș\n\n*t » ț\n\n\nIs there a way to edit the Accent Menu to add the accents that are used for a specific language?\n\nA: This menu does include the Romanian diacritics when you're using the Romanian input source. I've provided a tutorial on quickly changing the input sources in:\nHow can you customize the keyboard layout / shortcuts?\n\nA: I've seen this asked quite a few times since Lion was released last year, but as far as I know, nobody has found how to customize it yet.\nI don't think it is that difficult to make accented characters, however, with either the US or US Extended layouts.  A chart is at\nhttp://homepage.mac.com/thgewecke/diacritics.html\n", "Q: How can you customize the keyboard layout / shortcuts? I've recently migrated from Ubuntu to Mac, but one of the features that I'm lacking most is the keyboard layout for alternative languages. I don't like to switch keyboard layouts all the time, yet at the same time I like to write using accents and diacritics, as needed in each language (Romanian, French, German, etc.). \nThe Romanian keyboard layout provided on Linux offers a very nice \"compatibility variant\", specially for programmers.

To make this function useable, you'll need to do a little setup.\nOpen System Preferences: Keyboard and select the Keyboard Pane. Check the option to Show Keyboard & Character Viewers in menu bar (1), then click on the Input Sources… button (2).\n\nThe Language and Text preference pane will open to the Input Sources tab. Select the input sources (3) you want to access on a regular basis. Fewer is better, remember you can always return to this tab and change your selections.

Select Keyboard and Text Input from the column on the left (5). Then check the options to enable the keyboard shortcuts to navigate between input sources. (6).\n\nIf you stay with the default shortcuts, they will conflict with  the default Spotlight shortcuts. Select Spotlight from the column on the left, and either deactivate or change the keyboard shortcut assigned to the Spotlight functions.\n\nNow when you need to type a special character, use the hotkey to select the appropriate Input Source and use Lion's long hold function to bring up the choices for each character. \nI am currently using Romanian as my Input Source . I know this because it's displayed in the Keyboard and Character Viewers menu item. A long press on a provides:\n\nOnce I've typed the Romanian character, I can use the keyboard shortcut to return to the U.S. input source.\n\nA: Since you're coming from a Linux background, I think you'd feel right at home with my suggestion of reading about DefaultKeyBinding.dict file.\nYou use Ukelele as suggested above for the layouts of accented letters and such. But the keyboard bindings comes handy for programmers shortcuts and special keys.\nGoogle up the file name and you'll have many links and tutorials on the subject. One reference link would be Apple's NSResponder Class Reference which lists all possible actions you can perform in any Cocoa applications using custom keybindings.\n\nA: The US Extended layout may suit your needs.

Would it hurt the computer if I carry it around without shutting it down? When I first got my MacBook Pro, it took less than 30 seconds to start up. Now, after several months, it takes about two minutes to startup and I can tell that it is not as responsive when using some applications (it was fast before). \nI am wondering if it is because I'm not shutting it down that causes the lag during startup.\n\nA: MacBooks are designed for close and go operation and you're not doing the system or hardware any harm by following the practice. That being said, there have been past issues with MacBooks not going to sleep properly when the lid is closed—the indicator being that the Mac is hot to the touch and the battery level is lower than you would expect when you remove it from your bag. There are some reports of wake from sleep issues, generally caused by a \"stuck\" process. \nAssuming you have adequate RAM, the slowdown in your startup process is most likely caused by applications and processes being loaded at startup. The startup on my own MacBook Pro (Mid 2007 model) is measured in minutes as various mission critical utilities—QuickSilver, TextExpander, Growl, etc.—load and populate the menubar If you login to an alternate (preferably clean, stock) user account is the startup process faster?\nTo get a better idea about what you're loading at startup, navigate to System Preferences and open the Users and Groups pane.

Select your user account from the panel on the left, then open the Login Items tab.\n\nThis screen grab is from a MacBook Air that runs only a subset of the login items of my personal MacBook Pro.\nIf Applications that you don't need are running, you can remove them. Do this with caution, because sometimes there are login items necessary for other software to run as expected.\nBeyond that, you might want use Activity Monitor to discover what's running on your Mac. Run it right after a system startup. If you amend your question to include a screenshot of your login items and/or the running processes, we may be able to help you further.\n\nA: Not shutting your MacBook Pro down won't affect performance that much. There could be other factors playing a role there.\nTo answer the questions in your title,\n\n\n*\n\n*By default, closing the lid on your MacBook Pro will put it to sleep. Here is some more information about sleep and other energy saving methods.\n\n*As long as your hard drive has spun down, as it does when it goes to sleep, you should be fine to put your computer to sleep and carry it around. Just make sure the sleep light starts pulsing. Once this happens, your computer has cut power to most components and has spun down the hard drive platters and parked the heads. \nSorry about the previous answer, I had not done my research there and was going off of personal training from an individual with a strong background in Windows. Most Windows machines do not spin down the hard disks when closing the lid.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I was told by the apple store it could damage the hard drive.

There's been a lot of posts about memory in OSX.  None have really documented what the screen below speaks to.  Especially the difference between private memory, and virtual private memory.  Also does port represent just network ports, or does it include open file handles on that screen? The link right here What's the difference between Real, Virtual, Shared, and Private Memory? is not the same question.  They're speaking of a different screen in OSX, which makes different measurements.  The screen I'm referring to in the image below is per process, not per system.  I would greatly appreciate if any one can provide information to what memory statistics in the image below represent, and what ports details.\n\n\n\nA: Yes - the per process memory statistics and mach call counters mean the same thing as the system wide statistics.\nActivity Monitor helps you break down which specific processes are making up the conglomerated statistics if you use the screens shown above.

The functions readXPRAM and writeXPRAM can be used to access the raw bytes, although these days they are just wrappers around IOKIT functions which access the APL,MacOS75 partition in NVRAM.\nThe nvram command line program only manipulates the firmware variables stored in NVRAM, and so does not let you access the PRAM partition.\n", "Q: Why can't Safari open RSS feeds? I'm using Safari 5.1.3 on Lion.\nEach time I click the RSS icon in the address bar (or directly visit the feed), Safari will report can't open page, saying operation not permitted with the NSPOSIXErrorDomain: 1 error.

I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit and the wifi sync used to work properly, but due to lack of memory, I shut down some of the processes / services that would run automatically to make my computer run a bit faster.\nNow I'd like to sync my iPod Touch with iOS5 again but I don't know which services need to be turned on to sync again.\nWhen I go to my iPod to sync, the button for wireless syncing in Settings isn't tappable. \n\nA: Okay so here are the prerequisites for making this work over wifi:\nPrerequisites:\nPrograms Running:\n\n*\n\n*iTunes\n\nServices Running:\n(Located in Start->Control Panel->Administrative Tools->Services)\n\n*\n\n*Bonjour Service\n\n*Apple Mobile Device Service\n\nwifi:\n\n*\n\n*iPod connected to wifi and so is your computer\n\niTunes Issues:\nIf you have all of the prerequisites above set, and on your iPod you enter (Setting->General->iTunes Wi-Fi Sync) and you find the Sync Now button is still disabled do the following:\n\n*\n\n*In iTunes click edit->preferences\n\n*Click the Devices tab.\n\n*Click the Reset History button.\n\nNow if you look at your iPod Touch again the Sync Now button should now be enabled.\n(found in the apple documentation)\n\nA: I would add that simply downloading the latest iTunes installer, running it and choosing \"Repair Installation\" should re-enable whatever services you have disabled.\n", "Q: New password after restoring iPod Touch from backup I restored my iPod Touch from an iTunes backup and my old password no longer works to get into the iPod. Any idea how I can figure out what the new password is? How can I change it back to the old password?\n\nA: The passcode would be whatever the passcode was at the time of the backup you restored to. When you restore an iOS device from a backup, it puts all the software configuration back on the device, including the passcode that was set at the time. \nIf you want to get past this passcode, I suggest trying all your most recent passcodes. Be careful though, after a certain number of attempts your iPod may lock you out and prevent you from entering any more passcodes.\nYou can remove the passcode, but you will have to restore your iPod and you will not be able to restore from a backup.\nYou can do this by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug your iPhone into a computer running the latest version of iTunes.\n\n*Hold the home button and the sleep/wake button for exactly 8 seconds.\n\n*After this 8 seconds is up, release the sleep/wake button, but continue to hold the home button until iTunes recognizes your iPhone.\n\n*Then, choose the Restore option (this should be the only option) and wait for iTunes to download the necessary software and restore your iPhone.\n\n", "Q: Can I force GPU rendering on my MBP when connected to a power source?

Might they be related? I have a MacBook Air which was working fine. Now I have awful network issues since the 10.7.3 update.\nMy home router is a D-Link DIR-615. I was securing the Wi-Fi network using WEP which worked great on Windows 7/XP/Vista, Ubuntu, iOS, and Mac OS X Lion. \nThen I installed the 10.7.3 update on my MacBook Air and the Wi-FI stopped functioning on it. I started to receiving error messages saying, \"Select a certificate and enter username and password\". I googled this and decided to switch to WPA security since is more secure and though this issue would be resolved. Easily done. No more error messages, internet is working fine everywhere...except on the MacBook Air. \nNow when I attempt to connect to Wi-Fi on my MacBook Air, it attempts to connect to my network and connects but gives the error message \"Alert: No Internet connection\". I checked and it is not getting an IP address. After two minutes or so, it receives a proper IP address, but the internet is not working. Sites simply won't load. When I try to ping my router, I get timeout messages. I have verified that my DNS settings are correct.\nHere's what I've already tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turning firewall on/off/on again\n\n*Removed Wi-Fi configuration from System Preferences > Network, and added them again\n\n*Rebooted my router (several times)\n\n*Cleared /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration folder\n\n*Installed 10.7.3 combo update\n\n\nAll other Wi-FI devices on my network work with no issues. It's just the MacBook Air that is having this problem.\n\nA: From what I've seen - this seems to be more a network routing issue than a hardware / link level problem.

I currently use Little Snitch to control network traffic on my Macbook Pro, and see what my apps are connecting to.\nUnfortunately, Little Snitch only shows you the hostname that an app is connecting to. Is there a tool which will show you the full URL of the requests that apps are making? Even better if you can view the headers.\n\nA: I recommend ProxyMan. It's hands down the best client in this space IMO. The free tier is amazing for most non-pro users. They also have a mobile app. https://proxyman.io . I love this app!\n\nA: The most full featured way to peek into web traffic is to install and configure your system to use a web proxy.\nThe mitmproxy proxy (and mitmdump tool) is mature, reliable and well documented so I would start there unless you have another that meets your specific needs.\nAlso, widely used, superbly documented and well regarded is Charles Proxy\n\n\nA: Whilst it won't give you the full URL, if you're a fan of the command line, then iftop also comes in quite handy and shows you both incoming and outgoing hosts, port numbers (names for well known ports) and cumulative totals for each - as well as live updating \"graphs\" on the command line :-)\n \n\n\nA: Sounds like you need a packet sniffer.\nWireshark will log and do full disassembly on all traffic going through your network interface.\n\nIn other words, it will not just show you the full URLs of each request, but it will let you look inside all the packets, so you can see the headers and content too (except in SSL connections, as they are encrypted).\nIt works on just about every platform out there, including Macs.\n\nA: HandsOff!\nis very similar to Little Snitch. I've explained differences in an answer here.\nThe network monitor shows hostnames, but it will distinguish them if they have different IPs.  Via right-click you can get the specific IP address - you don't get to see the full URL request. But the IP address is more specific anyway.\n\nThe developers are open to feature requests. You might see such a feature added in the future.\n\nA: A newer application which is available now is Proxie.\nCompared to Charles Proxy, which is $50, Proxie is only $10. (Charles Proxy does have a demo available, and is an excellent app, but Proxie has worked very well for me.)\nYou can use Proxie to see both http and https URLs. There is a fairly simple process required to setup the https monitoring (you need to generate and install a certificate), but it only has to be done once, and the instructions are quite straight-forward.\nI believe that this is the easiest solution to the OP’s question.\n", "Q: OSX Lion Server Security If lion server runs on osx lion, what is accessible from the \"outside\"?\nIf I open a port and connect it to the ip of the lion server, will that traffic be intercepted by the server app and limiting the scope of the access to what the server app allows access too?\nWill my entire file directory be available to the outside if I open the port? E.g. the lion OS running has some other apps running and files stored on it, will this be accessible from the outside? Or does the server app intercept the incoming requests and, depending on what has been made available as a service through the server app, that is only what the outside can access?\n\nA: OSX Lion isn't an app as such but a collection of additional services and applications running on your Mac. Accessibility from outside is the same as for a plain vanilla OSX installation.\nAny port you open allows access from outside, but access is always (as long as there are no security bugs) restricted to the service provided. So if you enable Web Sharing, access to the local web server is possible (including ~user/Sites) but not (unless you reconfigured the web server in an insane way) to your whole filesystem.\n", "Q: Can I make push notifications for some email addresses only and not others on my iphone?

In chat there was an emoji icon posted recently. You can view it here. I am using Google Chrome and I can't see the icon. I can, however, see them on my iPad. How can I view them in Google Chrome on my Mac?\nFor clarification: I am running Snow Leopard (10.6.8).\n\nA: If they are using real Unicode emoji, you cannot see them without the Apple Color Emoji font, which only works in 10.7, or possibly by downloading and installing a black/white font that has them, like Symbola or Quivira.\nUnicode emoji were only standardized in October of 2010 and I think there are various apps which may not recognize them anyway.  Here is Timothy's test using the Symbola font in 10.6\n\n\nA: Here's a GreaseMonkey script: http://photar.net/emoji/ I haven't tried this myself, so I don't have firsthand experience, but some reviews say that it causes serious lag, so I'd recommend only enabling it when you see a \"character not supported\" box. To run it in Chrome, you'll need to first install TamperMonkey. The script is designed for Firefox, so it may not work completely, but there's a good chance it will.\n\nA: You can use an extension called Chromoji which will display emojis in Google Chrome correctly (works with older versions of Mac OS X plus Windows and Linux as well).\n", "Q: Looking for a tool to automatically two-way sync SFTP with local folder I use OS X for development and I want to push changes to dev server on every ⌘+S.\nWhen I check out  a different branch, I want the local folder to update accordingly.\nSo I figured I need an automatic, two-way sync solution.\nMy editor of choice is Sublime Text (which is awesome, you totally should check it out).\nI began my quest with Sublime Text SFTP plugin by Will Bond but found it unstable and slow.  \nThen I attacked the problem with Panic Transmit.\nIt is stunningly beautiful. However, it didn't help me either.\nTransmit offers two options:  \n\n\n*\n\n*two-way sync between local and remote folder;\n\n*mount SFTP to the filesystem.\n\n\nAlas, its two-way sync is manual and has to be invoked by pressing a button.\n(I could probably get around this by writing some clever AppleScript—but I don't know it.)\nSFTP mounting is great—unfortunately, it has major disadvantages: file searching is predictably slow and there seems to be no way to tell Transmit that files have changed on server. You need to unmount and mount again to see the remote changes. This makes branches impossible to work with.\nI'm really confused now and I don't feel like wasting a couple of hours on a wrong solution. I'm open to suggestions for a tool to improve my workflow.\nHere's what I found so far. I'm not sure any of those can actually watch remote folder for changes.\n\n\n*\n\n*writing some AppleScript to sync Transmit both ways each ten seconds;\n\n*using rsync and Folder Actions;\n\n*using rsync and FSEvent;\n\n*using DoubleDown (open source);\n\n*buying FolderWatch (commercial);\n\n*doing something else.\n\n\nNote that I'm looking for a solution that works out of the box. I don't want a tool that can't handle new/changed/deleted files or folders without fiddling with its source code.\n\nA: Old question, but here's my answer:\nI use a Unix tool called Unison. This is a command-line tool that allows for two way sync.\nThe good is that it's highly configurable: ignore certain file names, directories, synchronize multiple folders, which side wins in a conflict, many other things.\nThe bad is that you have to not be scared of the command line and both the server and the client have to have Unison installed; both installations need to be the same version and built with the same version of OCAML.\nBut I've been using it multiple times an hour every work day for the past year and it's been awesome -- it's really fast, really easy to fire off from the command line.\n\nA: Have you considered using something like Git? Hosting the files on GitHub or setting up your own git server.\nThis should help: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/455698/best-visual-client-for-git-on-mac-os-x\n\nA: The following AppleScript allows you to sync a remote folder with a local folder using Transmit\nhttps://github.com/lmullen/AppleScript---Transmit---sync-local-directory-to-FTP-directory\nUnfortunately, it appears to default to syncing the remote folder with the local, and what I want is the opposite: to download updated files from the server onto my computer.\n\nA: A very old question, but maybe my own answer helps. I also used SublimeText (I think I've still got it somewhere) because I like the way it opens files so fast — especially on older Macs. However, for more serious work, a better IDE would definitely fit your requirements better.\nSince you're fine in acquiring new/different software, give Panic's Coda a try. You already liked Transmit, which is also a product from Panic. Coda sits between SublimeText and super-sophisticated IDEs like, say, Eclipse, and it can do pretty much what you wish — keep folders in sync between your local computer and the remote server, publish and sync on demand, and, additionally, keep your local data also in sync with GitHub, Google Code, or any other popular versioning system based on either Git or SVN.\nCoda suffered a bit from performance in the past (namely in rendering code in colour when fast-scrolling), but current versions have been completely revamped and are almost as fast as SublimeText. It's also plugin-based — the PHP/JavaScript/HTML validation plugin is a must, since Coda's internal code validation features are not stellar in comparison. And, these days, you can use your Transmit server settings on Coda and vice-versa, as well as on any iOS device you might own, via their clever apps which sync the settings among themselves.\nThis almost sounds like propaganda for Panic... I wouldn't have mentioned Coda if you hadn't mentioned Transmit!\n\nA: Another option is Mountain Duck. It definitely works out of the box. I was seeking a utility that does what I think you're looking for. I have a remote web server that is running sshd and the web application server. I am also using Sublime Text to edit the components of the web application located on that server. I was using Transmit just like you were, and I was encountering the same problem: I needed to manually run it to perform the sync. It was not automated easily. Here is how I have this setup with Mountain Duck:\nFirst, I have a \"bookmark\" in Mountain Duck's lingo. This roughly corresponds to the same information that one places in Transmit's configuration to connect to the remote server.\n\nYou then navigate to Mountain Duck's menu, find the new bookmark entry, and select \"Connect\" from the submenu. The remote directory specified in the configuration then opens as an ejectable Finder location.\n\nI can then drag any of the items in that folder that I wish to edit into Sublime Text and make the changes that I want. When I hit save, the changes are automatically sync'ed with the mounted directory on the remote server.\n\nThis has, so far, satisfied my requirements for sync'ing the files. The development server that I'm using, Django, is able to sense that a file has changed when I save it and it is then sync'ed. The server then automatically restarts and I can immediately see the updated change in my browser.\nDetails about what those icons in the new Finder window mean as far as sync status can be seen in the documentation.\n", "Q: How can I change the number of times my iphone tries to notify me when I receive an SMS message?

This is the \"Visual Indicator\" that you asked about, but this indicator is for when the IPhone is unlocked, and you are doing something with it. You can set it to None (no indicators); Banners (it shows who sent the message, as well as a part of the first line of the actual message) which appears on the top of the screen, you only need to click it to go to the message; and Alerts (tells who sent the message, approx. 3 lines of text, and asks to dismiss or reply) {Note: When Alerts is activated, you MUST select either dismiss or reply before you are allowed to continue with your work}\nOther options are:\n\"Badge App Icon\" > on/off\n\"Show Preview\" > on/off\nThe one you were looking for, \"Repeat Alert\" > Never (this is never REPEAT, it will still ring when you receive the message), Once (again, this means it will repeat exactly once), twice, 3 times, 5 times, and 10 times.

This question is an extension of this question. While my answer did answer the question, there was one part that wasn't answered: how do I share a Wi-Fi connection via a Wi-Fi hotspot?\n\nA: Mac OS X has an \"internet sharing\" feature in the Sharing panel in System Preferences.\nAs several people have already figured out in the question and answers here, it lets you share the connection from one hardware interface via any other hardware interface, but it can't use a single Wi-Fi interface as both the main connection and to re-share. (Windows 7 can do this, thanks to \"network virtualization\" features added by Microsoft, which essentially allows a single hardware Wi-Fi interface to respond to multiple SSIDs, and that's the underlying feature that Connectify leverages.)\nOne option that Mac OS X has that isn't quite an answer to this question, but is useful in some of the same situations, is that it can use Bluetooth to create a Personal Area Network (PAN), and its internet sharing feature can share the internet connection from Wi-Fi over the Bluetooth PAN, as documented here.\nI've used this successfully to get an iPad to piggyback on a Macbook's Wi-Fi connection, so both were able to access the internet simultaneously in a hotel where I could only get one device on Wi-Fi. I was not able to get an iPhone 4S to connect to the PAN in the same situation, but supposedly it works for iPod Touches. I don't know if other computers (Mac OS X, Windows, Linux or otherwise) are able to join the PAN and use it as their internet connection.\n\nA: Install Windows (using rEFIt if you're on a Mac). Install Connectify.\nIf you're a developer and use Linux, it should be possible to develop a new kernel module that will accomplish the \"full duplex endpoint + repeater\" functionality. For starters, target one specific device that you can get the wifi chipset datasheets for; you need bus architecure, register numbers, memory addresses, interrupt numbers, signal timings, radio boot routine, and the function list (synchronous and asynchronous).\n\nA: You can't \"share\" a Wi-Fi connection via a Wi-Fi hotspot.\nWhat is misleading everybody is the inapropriate use of the technical\nterm of sharing when the function we are talking of is a redistribution.\nWhen 2 PC are connected on the same Wi-Fi hotspot they are truly\nsharing the same connection: they are using the same Wi-Fi channel,\nthey are sharing the router IP public address.\nWhen you start up InternetSharing within System Preferences > Sharing\nyou are not starting a sharing, but the redistribution of a main network access toward a secondary network access. On this secondary network access,\nyou are acting as an access router. You are distributing IP private\naddresses.\nOn your primary network access you have a public IP address, on your secondary network access, you have a private IP address, and you translate the traffic IP addresses from the\npublic side toward the private side and the other way around.\nTo be able to perform this redistribution of IP traffic coming\nfrom your primary network access toward the same physical access\nyour OS should be able to present you this physical interface as 2\ndifferents virtual interfaces, typically en1 and en2.\nMacOS X doesn't provide such a virtualisation function.\nYou can't redistribute your Ethernet connection toward your Ethernet\nconnection.\nYou can't redistribute your Wi-Fi connection toward\nyour Wi-Fi connection.\nConnectify (on Windows 7) is simply selling a standard function of Windows which permit to create 2 virtual Wi-Fi interfaces on top of\none physical one (see: Wi-Fi hotspot for Windows 7). Then Windows\nredistribute the network access of the primary Wi-Fi toward the second one.\n\nA: I made a video on how to do this with a virtual windows PC running inside the Mac OS.  The video is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoLxujScJSY\nThings needed for my answer to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*any virtual box (free-vmware if you want to pay, parallels is good) \n\n*a wireless network adapter \n\n*windows iso file which you have to install on virtualbox\n\n\nA: If you mean on a computer, you can use Connectify. I use it it work it's great if you are connected to WiFi; your computer acts a router to all your other devices. If you mean a hotspot on your iPhone go to Settings > Network > Turn Cellular Data On and then enable the hotspot. \n\nA: You can share using USB wifi modem.Connect to internet using usb wifi.In  settings->sharing configure sharing from USB wifi to wifi.Make sure to turn off firewall if not your hotspot doesn't allow DHCP to assign IP to client devices. \nThis worked on my Yosemite.\n\nA: Use a Wifi repeater on the original network you are connecting to.\n", "Q: Is it possible to play 1080p MKV files on iPad2 over uPnP? I have just configured my Drobo FS to be a uPnP server on which I have lots of 1080p MKVs.\nMy little boy loves his movies (Nemo / Cars / etc), so I was hoping to be able to let him watch them on the iPad streamed from the Drobo.\nAm I dreaming the impossible dream here?\nOr have I hit some hardware limitation of the iPad and/or the bandwidth limits of my wifi?\nEDIT\nThe files are mostly AVC for video and DTS for audio\nEDIT 2\nSince I already had plex installed on my iPad (which I bought on iTunes) I re-enabled the software on my PC server and just pointed it to my Drobo movie share. I was really hoping to not have to transcode, but I guess that will have to wait until I've got faster wifi and a more capable tablet ;)\nEDIT 3\nI was having a play this morning as I would quite like to watch some 720p TV shows I have (stored on my DroboFS) on my iPad2. But it seems I cannot even watch those. About the only things I can watch smoothly are SD AVIs (very low bitrate)\n\nA: Personally, I do this with a DLNA intermediary running on a Windows machine. In my case I use ZumoCast. It has a server-side component (I run the Windows-based component on but you could use the Mac one if you have a Mac in your house) and then an iDevice player that connects up to it. The server-side component does transcoding on the fly for you and I've certainly been able to use it with high-resolution files that are in MKV containers without any issues.\nAt its heart, ZumoCast is a DLNA server and client that just kind of keeps it all within the family. The ZumoCast client will only talk to ZumoCast DLNA servers.\nThere are app store apps that purport to any DLNA or uPnP server for streaming. I have no experience with them though. Some are free so you can try risk-free at least. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*AirPlayer\n\n*media:connect for DLNA and UPnP media streaming\\\n\n*GoodPlayer\nThose are just a few that showed up in a quick search.\nHow well they work? Hard to say. It's going to be very dependent on your device and your network. A 1080p video+audio stream over your WiFi network might push it to the limit. Add transcoding and resolution downsampling (your iPad 2 only has 1024 x 728 pixels so it has to resample 1080p content to fit it on the screen) on the iDevice and you may not get the greatest viewing experience.\n\nA: It really depends on the codec used (MKV is just a container). Fuppes and XMBC might help you but you need to jailbreak:\n\niDevices can playback most videos saved as high as 1080p.\n[..]\nXBMC on iOS can playback all formats supported by XMBC in standard definition. Due to technical limitations only H.264 (up to High Profile) encoded videos are supported for high definition. The iPad 2 and iPhone 4S are the only exceptions to this and will play some other HD codecs (means anything with 720p resolution and above) due to the more powerful CPU inside.\n\n", "Q: NFS mounts without automounter, which seems to grab everything We have some NFS mounts we place in the fstab, via \"vifs\" which we want to manage separate of the autofs subsystem.    The mounts were created in a separate location (/mnt) which should not be managed by the automounting system.   But it appears that no matter where you place a mount, somehow the autofs/automount subsystem grabs ahold of it and tries to remount it when you unmount it.\nThis is a big problem and I'm trying very hard to figure out why and how to fix it.   I wonder if there is a flag in the /etc/auto* files that might have to do with this?   Something else?\nDoes someone know how to get around this annoying behavior.\nThanks!\n\nA: I'm not sure if this will help you. If all your looking to do is save the connection information, finder will solve that problem. http://support.apple.com/kb/TA22243\nJust add it your list of favorite servers and it's point and click. The information appears to be outdated, but I'm sure the process is still similar.\nI just checked and there is another way to mount NFS shares:\n$cd /net/\"ip or computer name\"\n\nand browse the shares.\nYou can easily write a script to do this for you. I can confirm that the above method does work, because I tested it in Lion, and I read about this technique in a book I think is based on Tiger/Leopard.\nEDIT: Here is an output of my /etc/auto_master file\n#\n# Automounter master map\n#\n+auto_master        # Use directory service\n/net            -hosts      -nobrowse,hidefromfinder,nosuid\n/home           auto_home   -nobrowse,hidefromfinder\n/Network/Servers    -fstab\n/-          -static\n\nI'm guessing you would delete the last two lines according to the manual.

I have also been looking around 2 of these 3 days trying to find the best way to achieve my objective, and I have found similar questions around the internet, but I have not been able to do it.\nI am running an Apache2 server on localhost:8080 from a Mac OS X fully updated Lion. This Mac is connected through Ethernet (interface en0) to a wireless Access Point. In the AP, I have set up the gateway to be 192.192.192.1, and I have given that IP address to en0. The objective of this network is redirecting anyone's http/https petitions to the localhost of the gateway, showing them the page that apache is serving.\n-If before this point there's any conceptual mistake, please let me know-\nAs far as I have understood, the best way to do this redirection is using the pf.conf file and pfctl, but the man page of pf.conf left me with a bit of a WTF face. I have found in freebsdonline.com these instructions to do something similar:\n# --------- pf.conf ----------\nint_if=\"fxp0\"\next_if=\"fxp1\"\n\nrdr on $int_if inet proto tcp from any to any port www -> 127.0.0.1 port 8080\npass in on $int_if inet proto tcp from any to 127.0.0.1 port 8080 keep state\npass out on $ext_if inet proto tcp from any to any port www keep state\n# ------- end pf.conf -------\n\nThe thing is that this pf.conf seems to be forwarding packets between 2 interfaces, and I dont need that (do I?). Could you help me to adapt, or at least understand that lines? And is there anything else I need to do once that lines have been added to pf.conf?\nP.S: If you know any easier way of doing this redirection stuff, I'll be glad to hear it. I though about using dnsspoof, but I haven't been able to find it for OSX.\n\nA: Since you didn't mention it, I would make sure to navigate to:  \n/private/etc/apache2/  \n\nand open (using your text editor of choice; vi/m works, of course)  \nhttpd.conf  \n\nOnce you're there, make sure that lines 39 and 40 (or thereabouts) read:  \nListen *your_web_site's_address*:8080  \nListen 8080  \n\nIf it reads  \nListen 12.34.56.78:80  \nListen 80  \n\nThen that is certainly a big part of your problem, as the server is listening on the wrong port altogether.

Apple sells two Mac minis; one is a server edition, the other is a standard Mac mini. What are the differences between the Mac mini and the Mac mini server?\nI know that the server doesn't have an optical drive and runs a server edition of OS X. Besides this, what are the other differences? What is the advantage of buying a Mac mini over buying a Mac mini server? (besides, of course, that the server runs OS X Server, and one is faster than the other) Will the server last longer, be able to handle running 24/7, whereas the standard one won't?\n\nA: Comparison of Mac Mini and Mac Mini Server (as of mid 2011)\nProcessor:\n\n\n*\n\n*Server: Quad core i7\n\n*Mac Mini: Dual core i5 \n\n\n*\n\n*The base model of the Mac Mini does not support AES-NI which is recommended when using FileVault 2.\n\n\n\nGraphics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Server edition and Mac Mini base model: integrated HD Graphics 3000\n\n*High end Mac Mini: dedicated graphics, AMD Radeon HD 6630M with GDDR5\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: This is very recommended for Lion on large external displays.

Some differences are that the server version runs off of a Quad-Core i7, has dual 500 GB HDDs and a more powerful graphics processor.\nCheck out the side-by-side comparison here.\n\nA: The only real difference is that the so-called “server“ has a quad-core i7 processor, while the standard Mini has a dual-core i5. Otherwise, they are the same machine.\nNote that the i7 uses more power and needs more cooling, but the cooling system (fan) in the “server” version is the same as in the standard Mini.\nSo Apple used a processor worth a few bucks more, called it a “server”, and charged a hefty premium. Anyone who knows much about Apple also knows this is typical of them. They also charge big premiums for added storage in all their products. It was once possible to upgrade your own Mac. Adding RAM and upgrading the HDD, even adding a SATA SSD if you wanted. But those days are long gone. Nowadays, you pay the “Apple tax” to get what you get, and that’s that. No upgrading later. And if your RAM or storage ever fails, you have a very expensive doorstop on your hands.\nP.S. The reason I posted this now, in 2023, is because I was looking at buying another used Mac Mini to add to my little home server setup. A 2012 Mac Mini can be had now for about $99. The used price is double for the ”server” version, which is ridiculous. Also, considering the overheating issues of the “server“ versions, it’s a poor idea to buy a used one. With a computer that old, you definitely want to replace the thermal paste, and you don’t want to buy an undercooled/overpowered one that could have seriously overheated with the factory paste still in it.

I wanted to get this straightened out.\n\n\n*\n\n*Are named forks the same as extended attributes? If not, what are extended attributes?\n\n*Is the resource fork still implemented as a fork or as an extended attribute? If it is implemented some other way, then how?\n\n*The metadata stored with a file (creator, date modified...) is there any relation or overlap in terminology between the other three mentioned. An example would be, are extended attributes just extra metadata pairs (key + value) stored on a file.\n\n\nAny answers that can clarify how all four of these are interrelated, especially regarding the three question would be greatly appreciated, and contribute to settling disputes I see occurring across different resources. \n\nA: Confusion arises from the fact that the relationship between these concepts is complex and has changed over time. In current systems the difference between a named fork and an extended attribute is largely academic. \nFor an extended attribute, the actual data is stored in the attribute data record. \nFor a fork, what's stored is the list of disk allocation blocks that contain the data. A resource fork is still a fork. \nBasic file system metadata is stored in dedicated elements of the file system record itself, independent of the attributes and named fork references.\n\nA: I am not an expert on this, but I have read a bit to try to understand what is going on.\nI would say \"Confusion arises from the fact that:\n\n\n*\n\n*the relationship between these concepts is complex and\n\n*has changed over time and\n\n*Apple have implemented both program level APIs and tools like ls or cp is such a way as to hide many of the differences between the concepts.\"\n\n\nAIUI, the HFS+ Catalog file contains Catalog File Records (among other things). The Catalog File Record contains the normal sort of information about the file such as creation date, access date etc. The Catalog File Record also contains two structures that give information about the location and size of the data fork and of the resource fork.\nAIUI, HFS+ also has (copied from Wikipedia HFS+) an \"Attributes File [which] is a new B-tree in HFS Plus that does not have a corresponding structure in HFS. The Attributes File can store three different types of 4 KB records: Inline Data Attribute records, Fork Data Attribute records and Extension Attribute records. Inline Data Attribute records store small attributes that can fit within the record itself. Fork Data Attribute records contain references to a maximum of eight extents that can hold larger attributes. Extension Attributes are used to extend a Fork Data Attribute record when its eight extent records are already used.\"\nAIUI, the data stored in (or referenced from) the Attributes File (whether inline, Fork Data or Extension Attributes) are known as Extended Attributes.\nThose are the data structures, so how are they used?\nAIUI, early versions of the operating system (possibly versions before 10.4 Tiger, which John Siracusa seems to indicate had some major changes in this area), pointed to the data fork and the resource fork from the Catalog file.\nAIUI, once we get to 10.4 Tiger, the Attributes File becomes widely used to store all sorts of data.\nIt is possible (but I don't know) that in 10.4 and after, any Resource Forks are pointed to from the Attributes File. I.e. in answer to your first question, I would say named forks are Extended Attributes, unless they are the Resource Fork, and the Resource Fork is referenced from the Catalog file.\nThe problem in knowing how things are implemented is that in order to preserve backward compatibility, and probably particularly to support access to file systems written by one version of Mac OS from another version, different things and mixtures of things need to be supported transparently.\nWe can't tell from the normal Terminal command line tools where data is actually being held.\nSo, access to rsrc might suggest that the Resource Fork in the Catalog file is being accessed.\n$ ls -l Icon^M/rsrc\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin  486 23 Jul  2004 Icon?/rsrc\n\nHowever, we know that although the syntax looks like a file below the Icon^M directory is being accessed, this is not really the case, because \n$ ls -lR Icon^M\n-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 root  admin  0 23 Jul  2004 Icon?\n\nso Apple have implemented a special case for Resource Forks. \nIf instead we do\n$ ls -l@\n-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 root  admin   0 23 Jul  2004 Icon?\n    com.apple.FinderInfo    32 \n    com.apple.ResourceFork  486 \n\nThis suggests that we are accessing the Attributes File. But again, the implementation of ls may have a special case for Resource Forks.\nJohn Siracusa points out here that the ACL lists are stored as 'Extended Attributes', but are specially masked out so they are not shown in xattr. So again there is special case processing in the implementation of xattr.\n(Note that this special case processing may be in the code of the tool, or in the code of the underlying APIs that the tools access.)\nGregW, if you see this, it would be nice to get a more expert opinion as to whether I am along the right lines, or just hopelessly confused.\n", "Q: Lion Server: If I create two websites with the same domain name but different ports, web service won't start So, I upgraded my business server to Lion yesterday - BIG mistake. However I really want the WDE that comes with FileVault 2, so I'm trying to cope with all the fuzz. One thing that I can't figure out, however, is why the web service can't start when I add a domain name twice, but with different ports. \nHere's what I do:\n1. example.com is added with an SSL certficiate (port 443). All is good, site can be accessed.\n2. example.com is added without SSL (port 80). Web service dies, can't start, and all my sites die instantly.\nAny ideas?\n\nOK, so I figured out the problem at least; whenever an SSL domain is added, Server.app also saves a redirect for the port 80 equivalent of the SSL domain, named 0000_any_80_example.com_shadow.conf. It must be the _shadow.conf that's crashing with the regular port 80 domain .conf.\nWhen I realized this, I stopped the Web service, removed the shadow file, wrote a new \"regular\" .conf file which I then renamed to _shadow.conf, and turned on Web service... Only to see it be overwritten by the service. :(\n\nOh, well - problem solved with an easy workaround. I just saved the port 80 domain differently, so I did this:\nPort 443: example.com, additional domains: *.example.com\nPort 80: www.example.com, additional domains: *.example.com, example.com\nWorked great, luckily. :)\nI still would like a \"real\" solution, though. Any ideas?\n\nA: The creation of __shadow.conf files might not be stopped in Lion Server.\nApache can be stopped from loading these __shadow.conf configuration files by modifying /etc/apache2/httpd.conf. \nThere is a section at the bottom that looks like:\n<IfDefine WEBSERVICE_ON>\n    Include /etc/apache2/sites/*.conf\n</IfDefine>\n\nYou could change that to for eample (expand the list to match all tld's that your are hosting):\n<IfDefine WEBSERVICE_ON>\n    Include /etc/apache2/sites/virtual_host_global.conf\n    Include /etc/apache2/sites/*_.conf\n    Include /etc/apache2/sites/*.nl.conf\n    Include /etc/apache2/sites/*.com.conf\n</IfDefine>\n\n", "Q: How do I access CGI-Scripts Not Stored Under WWW-Root? How do I access cgi scripts from the browser if the CGI-Executables directory is above the www-root folder? I don't want to use something\nlike ../.  I tried browsing to localhost/cgi-bin/ but it gave an error. It said permission denied.\nHow do I configure these settings? Also can /~user-name directory aliases run cgi-scripts?\n\nA: If you have a look at the main Apache2 config file, /etc/apache2/httpd.conf you will see that there are two things that have to be done to allow /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables contain the cgi files.\nFirst, since it isn't covered by the permissions for the document directory next to it, it will need a \"Directory\" block to define the permissions for all the files and directories under it. In the case of this directory it allows absolutely nothing to happen. This is why when you pointed your browser at the directory it said permissions denied. Don't worry, the second thing allows cgi files in the directory to be run.\nSecond, it needs a \"ScriptAlias\" command that tells the server what URL will be used to point to it so that the server finds the files and allows them to be run.\nScriptAliasMatch ^/cgi-bin/((?!(?i:webobjects)).*$) \\\n\"/Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/$1\"\n\nThis basically says \"after you remove the hostname then any URL that starts \"/cgi-bin/\" and continues with a piece of text followed by a period followed by another piece of text points to a file with a name matching the last bit in the directory \"\"/Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/$1\"\nIf you want to place CGI files in one of your user directories then you will need to make some changes to a different config file. You will find the config file for user shares in /etc/apache2/users with a config file for each user. Here is an example:\n<Directory \"/Users/jessica/Sites/\">\n    Options Indexes MultiViews\n    AllowOverride None\n    Order allow,deny\n    Allow from all\n</Directory>\n\nTo this you will have to add either \"ExecCGI\" to the \"Options\" line so that you can have CGI files anywhere in your Sites directory or under or add a new Directory block for your CGI folder. It would look like this :-\n<Directory \"/Users/jessica/Sites/CGI\">\n    Options ExecCGI\n    AllowOverride None\n    Order allow,deny\n    Allow from all\n</Directory>\n\nSince this is under our DocumentRoot we don't need to use the ScriptAliasMatch.\n(The second option is the more secure.)\n\nA: I usually hate doing this but with some experimenting I figured out how to solve the issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a script to the CGI-Executables/ folder, and set it's permission to 755 (chmod 755 ./file-name.\n\n*If you want to change this configuration, $cd /etc/apache2/ and edit the httpd.conf file.

So to modify this as being the folder, simply change this setting here to a different location.\nI'm still not sure about setting up a cgi-bin for a ~/user-name directory if anyone can help with that\n", "Q: iOS and Firmware differences Is the iOS operating system the same thing as the phone's firmware? Basically, when reinstalling the firmware (such as with DFU mode), are the system files being reinstalled, or something else?\nWhat is the purpose of the firmware on iDevices (iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad)?\n\nA: Heres a short overview.\nThe term \"firmware\" for iOS devices covers some or all of the following items dependant on the device:\n\n\n*\n\n*the baseband (the phone code implementing the cell tower\ncommunications for voice and data)\n\n*the device firmware (akin to the BIOS) otherwise known as the boot\nROM\n\n*the device software (iOS itself)\n\n\nDevices like the iPod touch and the non-3G iPads don't have basebands, however the builds for the devices may cover both the WiFi only and 3G enabled devices so will include the baseband update.\nBuilds that target different generations of devices may contain multiple baseband's for different versions of phones since the baseband chip may be from different manufactuer's as in Qualcomm for the newer devices or Infineon for the older devices.\nSo when the phone turns on, the code in the Boot ROM runs, it activates the hardware (the phone and the baseband), and then proceeds to start the software (iOS)\n\nA: Wikipedia describes firmware like this: \n\nIn electronic systems and computing, firmware is a term often used to\n  denote the fixed, usually rather small, programs and/or data\n  structures that internally control various electronic devices.\n\nWikipedia describes the major layers of iOS like this:\n\nIn iOS, there are four abstraction layers: the Core OS layer, the Core\n  Services layer, the Media layer, and the Cocoa Touch layer.\n\nThere's a site called theiphonewiki, and its firmware page links to what appear to be complete .ipsw images including all of the software for a given iOS release. So, theiphonewiki considers firmware to be all of the software.\nAfter reading the Wikipedia definition, I consider the firmware of iOS to reside entirely within the Core OS layer, and consisting of the operating system kernel, device drivers, and other hardware-facing software components. Without knowing exactly how iOS is implemented, I can only speculate that these components are clearly defined and distinct (although this is not always the case in practice).\nEdit: This TUAW article indicates that all non-bundled applications and user data is erased from the phone during a DFU restore. This suggests to me that the internal storage is completely erased, and all of the device software is reinstalled (low-level operating system, baseband if applicable, and bundled iOS applications).\n", "Q: How can I scroll to the top/bottom of web page with a three finger gesture?

The last time I connected my iPhone to my MacBook Air was last week, and everything was fine.\nSometimes my MacBook Air shuts down when I connect my iPhone to it. What should I do about this?\n\nA: The Macbook Air tries to supply a full charging current to the iPhone, but when the Air is running on battery and doesn't have a full charge, it loads the battery down enough for the Air to go into low power mode.\nWhen you connect you iPhone, make sure you have a full battery on the Air, or are plugged in.  This will also happen less frequently if the iPhone battery is full, but the main issue is making sure the Air has enough power to give a full amp to the iPhone without shutting down.\nThis doesn't affect the larger notebooks as noticeably due to their larger battery packs, but as they age and when they have low charge you would see the same issue from them.\n\nA: Have you checked if this happens with an specific cable and an specific port.

My example song here is 'Sentimental Johnny' by Flogging Molly (not that it matters).  This song's track length is 4:47.  At 3:13 into the track, it ends abruptly. If I try to \"fast forward\" past this point by clicking on a further-forward moment on the \"track time\" bar at the top of iTunes, the song ends (and its \"plays\" and \"last played\" update as described above).\nThe problem isn't resolved, though. I am inclined to reinstall iTunes and see if that makes the issue go away.\n\nA: Well I'm afraid that I resorted to the obvious Windows thing -- I uninstalled iTunes, renamed my iTunes library, and then reinstalled.  After reinstalling, everything appears to be OK (my \"test song\" now plays completely).  I assume there was a problem somewhere in iTunes's metadata repository.\n\nA: I'd recommend checking the 'crossfade' settings in the Preferences, if something weird has been set there iTunes could be assuming it needs to just kill the song and start again.\n\nA: In the Options tab of the Get Info box for a particular song, you can set the start time and stop time of a song. (I use this when there's an extra ten seconds at the end of a song, or an outro that goes on forever, or whatever.) Is that set to the wrong time on the tracks you're having trouble with?\n\nA: I've seen this a lot with music downloaded from the iTunes Store. Deleting the offending song and downloading it again fixes the problem for me.\nI haven't tried it, but it may be that you can simply delete the song from iTunes, then reimport the file.\n\nA: I fixed iTunes ending songs early on Windows 10 by exporting my library as an XML file and re-importing it as a playlist. This had the benefit of preserving my song metadata, playlists, and folder structure.\n\n*\n\n*In iTunes select File > Library > Export Library.\n\n*Save your library as an XML file somewhere.\n\n*Close iTunes.\n\n*Open your iTunes folder (%UserProfile%\\Music\\iTunes)\n\n*Rename iTunes Library.itl to iTunes Library (backup).itl.\n\n*Open iTunes.

But one thing you can try is to drag the window to the edge of your screen toward the space to which you wish to switch. After a brief pause, you will slide over to that space, hopefully bringing the iTunes mini window with you.\n\nA: I don't have this problem... have you tried restarting iTunes and/or your computer? In any case, you have two other methods to do it: either drag the window to the left or right edge of the screen and hold it there until the space changes, or do a four-finger swipe up and drag the window to the desired space. \n", "Q: How do I safely eject or unplug an iPad, iPhone, or iPod when iTunes is not running? When I connect one of my many iOS devices to a computer for synchronization purposes, I have iTunes running. In the iTunes left-hand area, I see an eject button to the right of the device's name. I always use \"eject\" after a successful sync, before unplugging the device cable.  I'm presuming this is meant to be similar to Windows' \"USB Device Safe Removal\" feature (though iOS devices don't appear to show up there?) .. or when I choose \"Eject\" from the context menu of a USB-connected disk on my Mac's desktop.\nYet, sometimes I'm connecting my iOS device to a computer without having iTunes running.  For instance, when using the device for USB-based \"Personal Hotspot\" connections, I don't need iTunes running.  My questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a need to safely indicate removal of an iOS device from a computer, prior to removing the device cable?\n\n*If yes, must I fire up iTunes simply to access the \"eject\" button, or is there another easily accessible mechanism available?\nI use both PCs and Macs so answers covering the two are appreciated. Good answers will also provide definitive supporting references.  Thanks!\n\nA: In the Finder in Mac OS X, press Command-Shift-G to Go to folder. Type /Volumes. This will take you to the “Volumes” folder. If your iDevice is mounted as a drive, it will appear here. You can select it and press Command-E to eject it. If it does not appear here, it is not mounted as a drive, and you can simply unplug it. Note that it may or may not appear on your Desktop or in a Finder sidebar depending on your settings, but it should always appear in the /Volumes folder.\nOn Windows, in the system tray, there is an icon you can click to “Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media.” Right-click the icon, find the name of your iOS device, and click it to eject it. If it does not appear on this list, it is not mounted as a drive and you can simply unplug it.\n\nA: If you see the \"idevice\" as a mounted drive, ⌘+E while it is highlighted should \"eject\" it (or just drag to the trash). If you do not see it as a mounted drive, simply unplug it.\n\nA: Older iPods mounted their filesystem however for operation with a host computer however iOS devices do not mount with a Mass Storage Profile and do not (natively) appear as mounted filesystems. Unless it is actively communicating with iTunes or some other application you can usually just unplug without a problem. \n\nA: *\n\n*Go to Control Panel > Hardware and Sound\n\n*View Device and Printers\n\n*Select iPad from Portable Devices\n\n*Go to Properties\n\n*Click Disable\nTo connect iPad next time, connect the USB and come to this window and enable the iPad under Portable Device\nTrust this is the safest way\n\nA: Go to iTunes.

I have shutdown my Mac many times, so the post-login sparsebundle resize should have kicked in.\n\nA: As I understand it, when you login, the encrypted disk image gets automatically mounted (and a link created to it). Thus, making your home folder /Users/moo point to the sparsebundle file within /Users/.moo. If you right click (or CTRL + click) on your home folder in the Finder and select Get Info, you should see thats its a Volume of a disk image with something like /Users/.moo/moo.sparsebundle.

The software for editing icons needs to run on OSX Lion.\n\nA: EDIT: This answer is now out of date. Apple recommends using \"Asset Libraries\" instead of creating icns files.\nApple provides Icon Composer as part of their free developer tools.\nThis is the only officially sanctioned way to create icns files. Most other editors don't support all the possible features.\nThe idea is you create a png file for each size you want, then create an icns file in Icon Composer, and import your various png files into it.\n\nA: Is depends on the kind of editing you need to do. icns Editor is on the App Store. Maybe this one too?\n\nA: In 10.5+, Apple's built-in Preview.app lets you do edit .icns files!\n(Preview used to be pretty bare-bones back in 10.2 days, but with every OS release it has gotten more and more powerful.)\nAfter opening the file, use the up/down arrow keys to switch between the different sized icon and bitmask images contained in the .icns file.\nThen with each image you can:\n\n*\n\n*Cut/Copy/Paste\n\n*Annotate (draw rectangles, add text, lines, arrows, ...)\n\n*Change transparency\n\n*Scale\n\n*Adjust color (saturation, tint, sharpness, etc)\n\n\nA: I would think that the program Opacity would be a good place to start for designing icon art as well as all manner of math and code drawing options.\nIt was designed from the ground up to do vector drawing and output many sizes of a master drawing as needed for icons to work well. Due to both limited resolutions for small icons as well as beefy artwork scaled up for resolution independence, the layers and tools work well.\nThe free trial should let you know if the tutorials and help on building icons is suitable for your skill level and needs.\n\nA: Use web tools:\n1.

I am new to Mac OS X, and I have a MacBook Pro. I am developing a web application with PHP and MySQL. I already installed XAMPP on my Mac. I discovered the option for hosting in System Preferences > Sharing > Web Sharing, but I don't know how to use it or how to tell my friend to view my web application remotely. Can someone help me?\n\nA: Web Sharing opens port 80 (http) on your machine and points any incoming requests to ~/Sites. You'll want to put your PHP app there for it to work through Web Sharing. I'm not sure if there is any further configuration you have to do on the PHP/MySQL side since I don't know anything about either of those languages. That's probably a question for SuperUser.\nAs far as accessing it remotely, you'll need to open port 80 on your router and point it to your computer's internal IP address. Then you'll want to give your friend either your domain name or your current IP address from your ISP and have them type it in their web browser.\n\nA: You just tick the box, an then anyone who doesn't get blocked by your firewall can view the site, either by domain name or IP address.\nPHP is installed but disabled by default, you need to enable it i httpd.conf (not sure what the exact path is). Just search for PHP and uncomment anything relevant. Any change needs a restart of Apache (untick web sharing, wait, and tick it again).\nMySQL isn't installed by default, but mysql.com has a pkg installer for it, and apple has already configured PHP to connect to it (via root@localhost with no password).\n", "Q: Mach Kernel vs. XNU When I ran $ls on my root directory a file /mach_kernel was found.  I'm assuming this is the OSX kernel.  I always thought that OSX used the XNU hybrid kernel, so why is this file called \"MACH\"? I'm running Lion.\n\nA: Based on what the Wikipedia page on XNU says, XNU is based on Mach. Since OS X started using the Mach kernel and now uses a derivative of it, they probably just kept the kernel's file name the same so they didn't have to tweak firmware during upgrades or with new machine releases.\n\nA: The file is called /mach_kernel for historic reasons; XNU is, indeed a hybrid of Mach and a BSD layer (forget Wikipeida, there's http://www.amazon.com/Mac-OS-iOS-Internals-Apples/dp/1118057651 which seems more definitive).\nIn actuality, this kernel isn't the exact image which gets loaded - there is a pre linked kernel cache (with all the necessary kexts) in /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kext.caches/Startup.\n", "Q: In Xcode 4.3, where do I put the additional tools?

Where am I supposed to install these programs?\nI suspect the answer might be \"Anywhere you want.\" — But I don't like that idea. I want to put them in some standard or conventional location.\nOddly, there is no README file saying where these should go.\nFor now, I'm putting them in /Applications/Xcode Tools, but that seems kludgey.\nAlso odd:  There was a .dmg file for the the Command Line tools, which I installed, but that actually was a .pkg inside the .dmg, which is different from the other 6.  I'm not sure why Apple is providing a .dmg for the Command Line Tools when they are installable via Xcode > Preferences... > Downloads > Components. I think it's just confusing.\nAnd finally: The \"Audio Tools\" image contains a directory called \"CoreAudio\", which contains a whole bunch of source code and include files.

From the \"Activity Monitor\" I noticed that even when the computer is idle, and with all browsers closed, it is still sending data out (several hundred bytes per second).

You don't have to be explicitly browsing the web to be using network traffic \nBonjour - Is a set of networking protocols to allow different machines to see each other with zero configuration.\nDaemon - Is just a process that runs unattended in the background.\nSeveral hundred bytes is a tiny amount of traffic, it's nothing significant.

I use Magican to monitor my Mac, it displays the programs are take high CPU usage.\nIf they will slow down the Mac, should I need to cut down some process?\n\nA: No matter what platform you are on, if you have multiple programs all running at once, they are using resources and therefore yes, will slow down your computer. There is a big difference between many applications running, versus actively doing something. \nFor example, if you are watching a movie, playing music, and working in Photoshop, all are actively using resources and the system will have to share them.\nIf you are not actively using something, the a large amount of its resources are given back to the OS, and therefore while still running (and consuming resources), they are not consuming as much. For example - on a Mac you can close all the windows of an application, and most of its resources are released, but it is still consuming 'something'. \nOS X Lion (10.7) takes this a step further with a new feature, called Automatic Termination. According to some of the dev documentation:\n\nWhen an application that supports sudden termination goes unused or\n  has no open windows, Mac OS X may terminate it behind the scenes. When\n  a user wants to use the application again, it usually relaunches\n  instantly. Users who want to quit applications manually can still do\n  so, but it is no longer necessary.\n\nWith Lion, applications that support this Resume/Automatic Termination feature will quit for you behind the scenes to gather resources back for the system if it starts running low. Preview and TextEdit are two apps I have seen this actually happen too. They won't do this if you are working in them, but if you leave TextEdit running and go off to other stuff, eventually it will quit itself for you. \nSo, the takeaway is this: Yes, too many processes running will slow down your Mac (and any computer for that matter). This is because resources are limited (obviously more RAM helps you run more stuff, but still a limit somewhere). \n\nA: On average, I run 10 to 12 apps simultaneously, all day long.  Photoshop, ScreenFlow, Citrix, Keynote, Dreamweaver, Safari, MS Messenger, Twitter, Illustrator, and iOS simulator.  Also, quite a few utilities.  My Mac runs fine, but it would run even better if I wasn't multi-tasking so much.  In short, get as much RAM as you can 8GB and you will be fine, but less apps means more speed in general.\n4 years ago (OS 10.4 Tiger) I posted a video to YouTube that demonstrated my app madness:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dh8TQr68iaM&context=C39a2431ADOEgsToPDskLtuBrV7mTwMYkeXh-EnOnN\n", "Q: How do I enable CTRL + Scroll zooming?

In an Open File dialog, I can press Return or Cmd-Down to go into a folder. But is there a key sequence to actually select the folder as the item to open? It seems I can only just use the mouse to press the Open button while the folder is highlighted.\n(BBEdit is an example of an application in which I often want to open a folder.)\n\nA: Return (with the ↩ symbol) opens the folder for browsing its contents (unless you're in column view). You need to press Enter instead. It's a different key, and its symbol is ⌤.\nIf you don't have that key on your keyboard, you can press Fn-Return to achieve the same effect.\n\nA: Not all applications allow you to open multiple documents simultaneously but you can open an entire folder from a BBedit (Version 10.0.1) Open Dialog by using the Column view, selecting the folder you want to open, and hitting return.\n\n", "Q: Run java bundled in .app from command-line The question is how do I run some application written in java and bundled into .app package from command-line?\nThe main purpose of this is to run an application under JDK7.

I really struggle working with iTunes on Windows XP Pro sp3.\nI have lots of mp3s, movies and TV shows, but it is a huge pain to get all the metadata into iTunes in the first place.\nThen I tried looking at the files in Windows Explorer, and the data is just not there, not in the extra columns, not in the properties.\nHow can I get all the data put into the actual file properties?\n\nA: I think your problem is with Windows XP and not with iTunes.\niTunes does indeed put the meta-data into each music file, according to the standard ID3 meta-tag specification.\nI have checked with my iTunes 10 library in Windows 7, and Windows Explorer in Windows 7 displays the meta-data for those music files from iTunes correctly.\nI can't test this, not having a Windows XP system anymore, but I wonder if perhaps Windows Explorer in Windows XP displays file meta-data in some different manner that causes it not to recognize the ID3 tags placed in the files by iTunes 10.\nI know that the way that Windows Explorer displays meta-data changed radically when Windows Vista was released, and works basically the same way in Windows 7.\nI suspect that iTunes works fine with Windows Vista and Windows 7 in this respect but that Windows XP, being a 2001 technology and more than a decade out of date, doesn't do this according to the standard \"modern\" Windows conventions.\nHere is a file from iTunes 10 displayed in Windows Explorer in Windows 7.\n\n\nA: I found out that iTunes will force write to the MP3 if you input all the meta data in and paste the artwork, press OK, and then go back to the Artwork Menu, select the artwork, use CTRL + X (Cut) and CTRL + P (Paste) and click OK to force it. After that, then all the metadata starts showing in Windows Explorer along with all my other devices.\n\nA: You could try using MP3Tag The Universal Tag Editor I found it on Google and it looks like it will allow you to edit the metadata tags for MP3 as well as a bunch of other files.\nEDIT:\nHere is a link to a MetaData editor that can edit Microsoft Office® documents (Word, Excel®, and PowerPoint®), OpenOffice.org documents, JPEG, JPEG 2000, AVI, MP4, F4V, WAVE, PNG, SVG, and XMP files.

Is there any way on iPad that I can write text on iPad using Touch Typing technique, as this is the way I use keyboard?\n\nA: The onscreen iPad keyboard offers no way to (re)orient your fingers to the home keys, which makes touch typing nearly impossible in my experience. However, with practice many iPad owners become skilled at using the onscreen keyboard well. \nIf you absolutely need to touch type longer documents, you can use a bluetooth keyboard with the iPad.\nI rarely carry the external keyboard when I'm out and about, but if I plan to settle in to write I toss it in my bag and when traveling I keep one in my hotel room for evening writing marathons.\n", "Q: Homebrew installed libraries, how do I use them? I'm a bit confused.\nI've installed a bunch of libraries (e.g. vtk, gsl,...) that I need for a  c++ project for school. I used homebrew to install them (luckily there were formulas available).\nMy question is, does Homebrew link these into /usr/include or something comparable? Or is this something I would need to do manually? \nHomebrew usually does this kind of stuff for executables, yet I can't seem the find the libraries anywhere other than in the /usr/local/Cellar/... directories. I have a bunch of libraries installed so I can't simply use -L/... for each of them.\n\nA: They are usually linked in /usr/local/lib (Intel Macs) or /opt/homebrew/lib/ (M1 Macs). If they are not there, try brew link <library-you-are-installing>; that should solve it.\n\nA: For recent versions of Homebrew, installed libraries (for example, SDL) will be located in $(brew --prefix)/lib as symlinks. You can update the LIBRARY_PATH variable to use this location like so:\nexport LIBRARY_PATH=\"$LIBRARY_PATH:$(brew --prefix)/lib\"\n\nThe header files will similarly be available in $(brew --prefix)/include so you can add this to your include directories.\n\nA: Use brew info <package> to find where a package is installed. You can add the --verbose option to see the full list of installed files.\n", "Q: Monitor a folder for changes, and run a command when a change is detected Is there a simple way to automatically run a (Terminal) command every time a file is changed in a specific folder? \nThis should be possible via the command line, or a system built-in application, no third-party applications.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Save a property list like this as ~/Library/LaunchAgents/test.plist:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\nhttp://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd>\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>test</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>say</string>\n        <string>yy</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>WatchPaths</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>~/Desktop/</string>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThe agent can be loaded with launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/test.plist or by logging out and back in. Applying changes requires unloading and loading the plist.\nTilde expansion (~/) works in WatchPaths by default. EnableGlobbing adds wildcard and tilde expansion for ProgramArguments, but it doesn't affect Program or WatchPaths.\nIf a watched file is modified within ten seconds from the last invocation, a message like this is added to system.log:\ncom.apple.launchd.peruser.501[146]: (test) Throttling respawn: Will start in 7 seconds\n\nOne way to get rid of the messages is to add something like sleep 10 to the end of scripts. Setting ThrottleInterval to 10 doesn't help.\nChanges in subfolders of watched folders aren't detected.\nSee man launchd and man launchd.plist for more information.\n\nA: Folder actions are fine for triggering when a file is added or modified.\nHowever, if your definition of changed includes deleting a file, OSX Folder actions does not detect if a file has been removed.\nTo answer the question:\n\n*\n\n*Download the FileWatcher dependencies from here: https://github.com/eonist/FileWatcher\n\n\n*Familiarize your self with running swift in the comandline: http://krakendev.io/blog/scripting-in-swift\n\n\n*Use this code to watch a folder.\nCode:\nvar fileWatcher = FileWatcher([\"~/Desktop/test/\".tildePath])/*<---the fileWatcher instance must be scoped to your class*/\n\nfileWatcher!.event = { event in\n    Swift.print(self?.someVariable)//Outputs: a variable in your current class\n    Swift.print(event.description)//Outputs: a description of the file change\n}\n\n\nA: You could use Folder Actions, which lets you execute (Automator) scripts whenever contents in a folder change. As far as I know, Automator has a template that lets you easily create a new folder action and attach it to the desired folder. And by adding a \"Run Shell Script\" action, you should just get the desired effect.\n\nA: entr(1) is a utility for running commands when files change. It reads a list of file on STDIN and uses kqueue(2) to avoid polling.\nExample:\nls my_project/*.html | entr echo \"file changed\"\n\nIt can be installed directly from the project site or via Homebrew.\nFor 2022, simply % brew install entr to install.\n\nA: Automator has a type of workflow called a \"Folder Action\" which automatically runs when something is added to a folder. Create one, then use the action \"Run Shell Script.\"\n\nA: I've found fswatch which claims to be \"a cross-platform file change monitor\", and seems to support all the proper platform solutions like Filesystem Events on macOS.\n# Monitor all files in a directory, execute script once when something changes\nfswatch -o -r path/to/directory | xargs -n1 -I{} your-command-here\n\n\nA: You might want to try something like this:\ntouch /tmp/dirb.tmp\nwhile true do \n  ls /thedirtocheck > /tmp/dira.tmp \n  diff /tmp/dira.tmp /tmp/dirb.tmp || echo \"something changed\" \n  cp /tmp/dira.tmp /tmp/dirb.tmp \n  sleep 100 \ndone\n\n", "Q: OSX able to throttle down CPU on heavy usage? I have a company macbook with a 4 core 2,8Ghz i7 (to much power for a \"laptop\" if you ask me, whatever). Sadly the cooler seems not to be able to handle 100% cpu usage. Sometimes filevault stresses the CPU with the process \"discimages helper\". Every time this happens I hear the cooler goes crazy ... a few seconds later programs randomly crashes and shortly after the complete macbook freezes.\nAny actions I can do to avoid too much heat on the CPU? Maybe limit discimageshelper to one core or software the holds back processes that consume to much CPU time?\n\nA: You may want to run Software Update. It could be that you're missing a SMC update, which addresses freezing at (continuous) high CPU loads:\nMacBook Pro SMC Firmware Update 1.5\nOr this EFI update:\nMacbook Pro EFI Firmware Update 2.3\n\nA: The best action to take is to ensure you are not giving the CPU work to do. When you throttle a CPU in hardware it slows down everything, and what seems simple in practice \"slow down the bad stuff\" gets incredibly complicated and not so effective in practice.\nCrashing and freezing of the OS are fairly serious unintended behaviors, so that should be your first priority in isolating. Have you looked into the Console app to see if there are system panic logs getting created or if you will instead need to profile the system to see what is happening when the freezes and crashes are in process.\nAs an analogy - you're looking to tune your running stride to go from a 2:25 marathon to a 2:20 marathon at the same time as you have a sprained ankle and perhaps a broken knee. Fix the big problem before you try to tweak a small one. Small doesn't matter when the house is on fire - and system totally freezing is your software saying your system is on fire and needs attention.\n", "Q: Where is the httpd error log file on Lion? I'm running a local web (development) server on my mac with apache installed.\nI'm sure it depends on my apache config but basically I just want to run tail -f /var/log/httpd-error.log in a terminal so I can see the error and warnings that occur during the development of my websites.\nSo my question is where or how do I find where this log file is placed since it is not placed in /var/log/\n\nA: Is /private/var/log/apache2/error_log what you are looking for?\n\nA: As morth pointed out, for the default Mac OS X Apache installation these are located in: /var/log/apache2/error_log.\nThe location can be changed in the httpd config using the ErrorLog directive, even for individual virtual hosts. Also note that if you installed another Apache besides the built-in one (like through MacPorts, or MAMP), this probably is different for you too. In that case you should have a look at the httpd.conf or equivalent for your installation.\ntip: If you have Growl installed, also have a look at this 'growltail' script. I think it's great to get notified of errors while developing, without having the need to switch back to the Terminal all the time.\n\nA: The Error Log is located at:\n/var/log/apache2/error.log\nThis is for Lion...\n\nA: It's normally /var/log/apache2/error_log but...\nNote that there's certain types of errors which can occur before apache starts logging, which might lead you to believe that you're looking in the wrong place. If you seem to be having trouble starting apache, and it's not logging any new errors, try doing:\nsudo bash -x /usr/sbin/apachectl -k start\n\nor try\nsudo apachectl -e debug\n\nor bypass the apachectl script and try just\nsudo httpd -k start\n\n\nA: #/usr/sbin/httpd -V\nServer version: Apache/2.2.24 (Unix)\nServer built:   Aug 24 2013 21:10:43\nServer's Module Magic Number: 20051115:31\nServer loaded:  APR 1.4.5, APR-Util 1.3.12\nCompiled using: APR 1.4.5, APR-Util 1.3.12\nArchitecture:   64-bit\nServer MPM:     Prefork\n  threaded:     no\n    forked:     yes (variable process count)\nServer compiled with....\n -D APACHE_MPM_DIR=\"server/mpm/prefork\"\n -D APR_HAS_SENDFILE\n -D APR_HAS_MMAP\n -D APR_HAVE_IPV6 (IPv4-mapped addresses enabled)\n -D APR_USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZE\n -D APR_USE_PTHREAD_SERIALIZE\n -D SINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT\n -D APR_HAS_OTHER_CHILD\n -D AP_HAVE_RELIABLE_PIPED_LOGS\n -D DYNAMIC_MODULE_LIMIT=128\n -D HTTPD_ROOT=\"/usr\"\n -D SUEXEC_BIN=\"/usr/bin/suexec\"\n -D DEFAULT_PIDLOG=\"/private/var/run/httpd.pid\"\n -D DEFAULT_SCOREBOARD=\"logs/apache_runtime_status\"\n -D DEFAULT_LOCKFILE=\"/private/var/run/accept.lock\"\n -D DEFAULT_ERRORLOG=\"logs/error_log\"\n -D AP_TYPES_CONFIG_FILE=\"/private/etc/apache2/mime.types\"\n -D SERVER_CONFIG_FILE=\"/private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf\"\n\n#find / -name error_log\n\n\nA: The answers above work great for the default apache that comes pre-installed on the mac.

I upgraded my MacBook to Lion and am less than impressed. I figured I should re-install Snow Leopard.\nCan I do that without destroying the lion partition?\nIf not, can I at least keep my Windows 7 Boot Camp partition? (And can I re-install Boot Camp on Snow Leopard and point it to the existing Boot Camp partition?)\n\nA: Yes - the Macintosh installer only touches data within the partition when re-installing Snow Leopard, but there's no guarantee the windows software will still start since Apple doesn't support going backwards like that. (i.e. they don't test it so you have even less support that what they provide for Boot Camp in general)\nYou may have issues on the Boot Camp side if the older Boot Camp software sees that your boot camp partition is newer than it expects. This means it may not work, so you need to be backed up and prepared to reinstall the Windows side of things unless someone else can edit or answer that they have tested this out several times. It might be fine, but I would feel bad if you took the Mac side being easy as assurance that everything would work perfectly on the Windows side after you go backwards.\nThe prudent thing would be to install Snow Leopard onto an external drive and swap that inside the mac to test whether Boot Camp will work on your new setup. This involves time and potentially tech money, so you might want to check into virtualization costs if that is a viable alternative to you.\n\nA: The answer appears to be no. The Snow Leopard installer refuses to install over a newer version of Mac OS.\nSolution was to use Snow Leopard DVD to revert to pre-Lion state.\nThe good news is that there are no issues with Boot Camp as such, only with finding the Mac OS partition from the Windows Boot Camp control panel. It's very difficult to find the Boot Camp software for Windows on Apple's site (legendary ease of use) so it helps to keep that software around for a re-install. After the Boot Camp re-install on Windows everything worked fine. Snow Leopard's System Preferences just finds the Windows partition.\n", "Q: How to control a scanner via an iPad? i've an HP AirPrint enabled scanner / printer.

After just discovering the line out jack I have helped uncovered another problem. Now, while then engine is on there is a high frequency buzz aka alternator whine, that varies pitch based on the engine RPM. Are there anyways to stop the high frequency noise, or at least reduce it. I  think my volume level is quite low from the line out, and is requiring me to turn the radio volume up much louder near maximum, which might be revealing the issue. How can I fix this? Do I need an amplifier?\n\nA: You're discovering the joys of noisy electrical grids in cars.\n\nDo I need an amplifier?\n\nNope. You need a filter.\nAnd filtering noisy car electricity is...tricky. You can't just create new, separate paths to ground because there aren't a lot of choices for where ground is in a car.\nYou can try putting a simple choke filter on the line between your player and the input to the stereo. That's the cheapest and easiest way to try and fix the problem. Something like this is sufficient.\nIf that doesn't cut the noisy you need to filter the power. Finding one of those car DC to AC inverters with a built-in USB port is likely your best bet. Something like this is what I'd suggest you try if the choke doesn't help.\n\nA: Chasing down electrical interference like this is the bane of car audio installers and all-too-often is an exercise in futility. The line level cable coming out of the TuneFlex is unbalanced and prone to such interference. This situation is made worse by the close proximity of the 12VDC accessory plug and the audio output circuit. (The 12VDC power outlet on most cars isn't particularly clean and is often a seemingly direct pipeline for alternator whine.)\nThings you can try:\nClean the dock connecter, audio jack, and audio cable ends with rubbing alcohol or a suitable electronics cleaner.\nIf you have the skill, check to make sure that the power connection to the back of the lighter plug is solid and \"clean\". There are various noise chokes and filters that you can try too, but the specifics of choosing and installing them is a science onto itself.\nReroute the audio cable. Sometimes a slight change in path will make a big difference in interference noise.\nChange audio cables, and switch to the shortest cable you can use when doing so. Try to go for a quality cable. You don't have to go completely overboard with this but some of the cables that ship with devices, or the type that retract on a spool, are of a lessor quality.\nThis may help, but I don't hold high hopes. The proximity of the audio out jack to what is apparently a dirty power source is going to be difficult to overcome. Good luck.\n", "Q: Why is my host name wrong at the Terminal prompt when connected to a public WiFi network? For three days straight, I have connected to the public WiFi network at my local library. Each day, I have seen a different prompt in Terminal. Here are some of the prompts I've seen:\nzp-pc:~ russell$\nmary-pc:~ russell$\nnormob05:~ russell$\n\nI have check under System Preferences -> Sharing, and my computer name is \"Russell's Mac\". Also, I set the DHCP Client ID to \"RUSSMAC\" under System Preferences -> Network -> Advanced -> TCP/IP, but I still see the random host names at the Terminal prompt.\nWhy is my computer name changing every day?\n\nA: Very simple easy solution ...\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo hostname [name-of-host]\n\n*Enter hostname and see your new hostname set\ne.g.\ndoolally:~ sjohnson$ sudo hostname AllTheRage\ndoolally:~ sjohnson$ hostname\nAllTheRage\n\nLogin back in or restart terminal to refresh ...\nAlso, check usage of hostname in man hostname.\n\nA: Found the answer here, though there is some discussion about the details.\nIn short, the Mac will pick up a host name from the DHCP server. This does not affect your computer's name as you have assigned it. This will only affect what you see at the command prompt.\n\nA: Type in Terminal:\nscutil --get HostName\n\nIf there's no HostName available, what you see is probably coming from the DNS or DHCP server.  \nSet your HostName with:\nsudo scutil --set HostName 'yourHostName'\n\nThat should do it.\n\nA: I noticed my hostname listed in the terminal prompt had changed.  I found the same name configured in my network settings in the WINS tab.  Seemed to be associated with a workgroup from my office (perhaps from connecting to my corporate VPN).  Anyhow, I left it alone and simply used the sudo scutil command listed above to set my hostname and it resolved the issue. Closed terminal and opened a new one; all is good.\n\nA: This is very late, but hopefully this helps those in the future who run into this problem.

If you’re\n  experiencing difficulty with a small number of windows, the simplest\n  solution is to use Stay’s window linking feature to manually link the\n  troublesome windows to their stored counterparts.\nIf you’re having trouble with a large number of windows you may find\n  it easier to recreate your stored windows on Lion.\n\n", "Q: Access the system library folder rather than the user library folder with Terminal I am trying to chmod a folder in the library of my Mac but I can only get to the folders below the user level.\nI need Library/WebServer/Documents/..., but I can only get to user/me/..., etc.\nDoes anyone know what I need to do?\n\nA: Even administrator users should use sudo -s or sudo chmod /Library/Webserver since the default group structure on OS X is to protect system resources from modification without the logging the privilege escalation.

I just updated to 10.7.3 and can no longer find the FileMerge application, which is part of the Xcode developer tools package. Did apple remove this in 10.7.3?\nI've checked in my developer directory, and used Spotlight, but it is nowhere to be found.\n\nA: With Xcode 4.3, Apple has moved the content of /Developer to the usual places for applications etc. Filemerge is accessible by starting Xcode and then accessing Xcode -> Open Developer Tool. If it's not listed there, select \"More Developer Tools\" to install it.\nPhysically it's part of Xcode.app (Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/FileMerge.app) and can be executed stand-alone by inspecting the package content of Xcode.app. If you really need it outside of Xcode often, you can also create an alias/symlink to start it directly (or just drag it into the Dock).\n\nA: If you want to launch it from Terminal:\nopen -a FileMerge\nopen -b com.apple.FileMerge\n(Both are case insensitive.)\nYou can also save this as a shell script and make an app with the following directory structure:\n+ Launch FileMerge.app/\n  + Launch FileMerge\n\nHere's a shell script that will make such an app:\nEXE_NAME='Launch FileMerge'\nmkdir \"$EXE_NAME\".app\ncd \"$EXE_NAME\".app\necho -e '#!/bin/sh\\nopen -b com.apple.FileMerge' > \"$EXE_NAME\"\nchmod a+x \"$EXE_NAME\"\n\n\nA: You can save an AppleScript as application to launch FileMerge inside Xcode:\ntell application \"/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/FileMerge.app\" to activate\n\n", "Q: Getting Siri to say 1 and not one When I ask for directions and say any single digit number, Siri spells it out instead of writing it numerically. Is there away to change this, because directions does not recognize numbers spelled out?\n\nA: Just say \"numeral\" followed by your number\n", "Q: Is the installation of Xcode from App Store enough for having the developer tools? today I tried to install the new version of Xcode.\nBefore that I removed the developer tools with the following command:\nsudo /Library/Developer/Shared/uninstall-devtools --mode=all\n\nI also had other folder in /Library/Developer such as 4.2 4.2.1 ...\nAfter that I installed the new Xcode and I noticed that the folder /Library/Developer contains only the Shared folder, which doesn't contain the command uninstall-devtools.\nDid I install the developer tools or do I have to do something more?\nAnother related problem is that when I try to install Flann through Homebrew it reports the following error:\n\nxcode-select: Error: No Xcode folder is set. Run xcode-select -switch <xcode_folder_path> to set the path to the Xcode folder.\n\nHow can I fix it?\n\nA: Installing Xcode 4.3 does install the developer tools, but not for command line access. With this version, everything has been moved into the application bundle, which means there is no need for a uninstaller, since you can just delete the application. If you want to install the command line tools, open Xcode and go to Xcode > Preferences > Downloads, select the Components tab, and click the button next to Command Line Tools. (This might add an uninstaller somewhere, but I'm not sure.)\nAs for Homebrew, you might have to wait for an update before it supports Xcode 4.3, since everything was moved. I would suggest trying /Applications/Xcode.app as the <xcode_folder_path>, since most of the hierarchy appears to be the same.\nThe homebrew developers are tracking these changes in their bug database so, you may want to monitor this thread for workarounds and notification of when the homebrew system will effortlessly work with the new changes for Xcode 4.3.\n\nA: Apple is providing these command line developer tools as a stand alone package now, so you may wish to get a free developer account if you don't want to wait for homebrew to change and locate / link to the new directory structure.\nA nice summary of the state of affairs on Xcode 4.3.x and older as well as the upcoming changes and benefits of having the command line tools packaged by Apple officially with headers is on Kenneth Reitz's blog.\n\nA: xcode-select -select \"/Applications/Xcode.app\" fixed this problem for me.  Everything is peachy now.\n\nA: When you download Xcode from the App Store, you're actually downloading an app called Install Xcode. You need to run that if you haven't; I'm not clear on whether or not you performed this step. Once you do that, you will have \n/Developer/Applications/Xcode.app\n\nand other components (assuming you install to the default location), but look for Xcode.app first.\n", "Q: Is there a native/cocoa REST client for Mac OS X? I'm looking for a cocoa REST client for the OS X. I prefer something native so that I'm not in the terminal interface and not looking for any browser extensions.\n\nA: Here's one client: \nhttp://code.google.com/p/cocoa-rest-client/\n\nA: This is a bit tricky to answer. REST is a style, an idiom, for software design. It isn't unto itself something you can have a generic client for. Rather, you can have tools that can interact with services via their REST-compliant APIs.\nIt's quite popular to use HTTP/S as the transport layer for REST-compliant APIs. And these days REST APIs can be found in a lot of web-based services. So it follows, some what naturally, that you'll find a lot of browser plugins that make it easy to do PUT, POST, GET and DELETE calls against arbitrary URLs using HTTP/S because that's where a lot of these REST-compliant services are listening and doing their thing.\nIf you'd rather not work within a browser you can, in OS X, quite easily move to the command line. cURL ships by default with OS X and is a rather invaluable tool for working with HTTP/S-based APIs, including ones that are REST based, but certainly not limited to just them (thought, admittedly, it's much harder to work with interfaces that require you carry state in your URL or in the body of the request, which is one of the reasons why the REST paradigm is so popular).\ncURL is...unbelievably powerful. It's one of those tools that always seems to be able to do what you need it to do as soon as you've had the thought, \"Man, I wish cURL could do X...\". As a quick start to cURL Linux Journal has a nice primer and, of course, the official cURL website has a tutorial to help you get started.\nI like real-world examples, so I'll pull this from another Linux Journal article where they give an example of posting to Twitter with cURL:\ncurl --basic --user \"$user:$pass\" --data-ascii \\\n   \"status=testing123\" https://twitter.com/statuses/update.json\n\nWith one modification: I'll make the call over https instead of http like they do in the article because there's no way I'd want to risk sending my username and password in plaintext over the public wire to Twitter.\n\nA: There is Paw. It is not freeware but there is a trial so you can test it. It has a lot of nice features and UX-wise it has been a pleasure to use.\n\nA: I've used the aptly named HTTP Client in the past to great avail. The app is deadly simply for setting custom headers, changing the user agent, testing APIs, etc.\nOne of the features listed on the homepage is \"HTTP Basic Authentication (with Keychain integration)\".\nIt's a simple and obvious app, and lets you review your full Request and the server's Response in detail.\n\nA: There are many native OS X HTTP / REST clients, some more or less advanced. A while ago I would have recommended Echo as its UI is quite nice, and there is the ability to keep multiple requests at once and it has outline view for JSON responses. There are also a few basic tools that allow you to send a request and eventually save them in files (RESTed which is well known, Rest Client, GraphicalHttpClient, RESTtest, Simple HTTP Requests).\nThough, now I could only talk about Paw. My input may be biased as I'm the founder of Paw, but it has many advanced features like Environments, Cookies / Sessions, Dynamic Values (to generate any kind of token: OAuth 1 & 2, Amazon S3, hashes, HMAC signatures, random strings or numbers \"nonces\"), Extensions so you can write custom JavaScript-based plug-ins, native editors for JSON or URL-encoded bodies, warnings when you make something suspicious (like a body in a GET request, etc.). We're extremely thankful to all users we got so far, and who left stellar reviews on the Mac App Store.\nHope this gives an overview of what's available. Other than native apps, there is Postman (a Chrome plug-in), Hurl (a web-based service), and probably more.\n\nA: Some other options available today:\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/rested-simple-http-requests/id421879749?mt=12\nThe free version of https://insomnia.rest/pricing/\nthis used to be available, but gone today, so had to use internet archive to retrieve:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20110714065650/http://apikitchen.com/downloads/ApiKitchen_0.1.dmg\n", "Q: Migrating old Xcode project to version 4.3 Today I moved to the latest version of Xcode (4.3). I tried to open an old project and when I try to launch the iOS simulator it returns me the following error:\nXcode cannot run using the selected device.\n\nNo provisioned iOS devices are available with a compatible iOS version. Connect an \niOS device with a recent enough version of iOS to run your application or choose an iOS \nsimulator as the destination.\n\nI also tried to create a new project and there I am able to launch the simulator.\nHow can I fix this problem and run all my old projects again?\nThanks!\n\nA: The problem is that Xcode 4.3 ignores the schema you had selected in older versions, and automatically sets it to run on device for iOS projects. Since you don't have an eligible device attached to your computer, you get this error. The fix is simple. In the toolbar, click on the menu which says iOS Device and choose one of the simulator options instead.\n\n\nA: Check to make sure the SDK for the targeted iOS version in the old project is still on your machine. For example, if you built the app against 4.0 and have since removed that SDK (upgrading Xcode may have done that), I would expect Xcode to present such an message.\n", "Q: Missing autoconf/automake in Xcode 4.3? After I purged Xcode 4.2 and installed Xcode 4.3 from App Store, I can not find autotools (automake/autoconf) through the command line. I've tried to run find /Applications/Xcode.app -name 'automake', but apparently they are not there..\nDoes anyone knows what is Apple's point to remove these essential toolsets?\n\nA: For what it is worth- (and others stumbling onto this problem like I did) in the latest XCode (4.6, 4.5 and friends) autoconf is not even available in the command line tools. \nI have manually installed just autoconf and a few friends, but still have trouble with some of the automake-ish software out there. \nSee http://jsdelfino.blogspot.com/2012/08/autoconf-and-automake-on-mac-os-x.html for a how-to to manually install.\n\nA: They moved them in 4.3 into a separate download afaik.\nTry install the command line tools via Settings -> download.\n\n\nA: I am running Mountain Lion and have XCode 4.5.2 installed.\nI have installed autoconf using MacPorts:\nsudo port install autoconf\n\nI have not tried but I am sure that sudo brew install autoconf should also work for those that prefer Homebrew.\n\nA: Are you certain your PATH hasn't been corrupted?

So this above is probably not helpful in the least.\n\nYou could try using the autoconf package from homebrew. It does not appear to be a keg that's available by default with homebrew, but you can still get it from here by placing the following in to /usr/local/Library/Formula/autoconf.rb:\nrequire 'formula'\n\nclass Autoconf < Formula\n  url 'http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-2.13.tar.gz'\n  homepage 'http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/'\n  md5 '9de56d4a161a723228220b0f425dc711'\n\n  def install\n    system \"./configure\", \"--program-suffix=213\",\n                          \"--prefix=#{prefix}\",\n                          \"--infodir=#{info}\"\n    system \"make install\"\n  end\nend\n\n", "Q: How do I view title text for a web page on a mobile device? XKCD on my kindle or phone just doesn't cut it.  I do all my other morning reading from the comfort of the ivory throne, but always have to revisit XKCD when I'm at a full blown computer with a mouse because I can't access the title text for the comic.\nIs there any way to display the title text on a mobile device?\n\nA: It's not generally possible unless specifically supported in some way by your browser, but you can create bookmarklets in JavaScript that add image title text to the web page as regular text paragraphs. How well that works depends on the layout of the web page.\nOne possible implementation is the following as URL of a bookmark:\n\njavascript:(function(){for(var i=0;i<document.images.length;i++){var t=document.createTextNode(document.images[i].title); document.images[i].parentNode.insertBefore(t, document.images[i].nextSibling);}})();\n\nThis will add the image title text just after every image on the web page. For XKCD, it looks like this:\n\nIt's not easy to type on iOS, but you can use iCloud to sync it between desktop and iOS device.\n\nA: Not easily without preparing a tool for the job - the title text from XKCD uses the mouse pointer and a hover timeout to present the title text as shown below:\n<img src=\"http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/good_cop_dadaist_cop.png\" title=\"NOW INVENT AN IMPOSSIBLE-TO-TRANSLATE LANGUAGE AND USE IT TO TELL US WHERE THE MONEY IS.\" alt=\"Good Cop, Dadaist Cop\" />\n\nOn iOS in the mobile safari, there is no mouse pointer that exists to hover, so that information does not surface in the normal interface. You may be able to get at it using VoiceOver, but the learning curve and delay in turning that on or off makes it a very slow workaround.\n", "Q: Is there a way to run one application in Full Screen mode on one display and still be able to view and access applications on a second display? When I make an app go full screen on my primary display - a 24\" Apple Display - everything previously visible and accessible on my second display - my MacBook Pro screen - is hidden by the default Lion background image.\n\nIs there a way to run one app in Full Screen mode on one display and still be able to view and access applications on secondary display(s)?\n\nA: The built in full screen (Lion) dominates both screens - and I've not been able to find any setting which lets me use the other one for anything else. \nThe fix I use for this is Divvy - which enables me to maximise on each screen - but this isn't quite full screen and doesn't provide entirely the same experience.

All it says on the CD is \"Snow Leopard\" How can I tell what version of the DVD it is? The DVDs were only released in versions 10.6.0 and 10.6.3. \n\nA: You should be able to see the OS version by going to System Preferences > Startup Disk. If it doesn't show in Startup Disk for some reason, you can run the following command in Terminal:\ndefaults read \"/Volumes/Mac OS X Install DVD/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion\" ProductVersion\n\nIf your DVD is not called \"Mac OS X Install DVD\" then you'll need to replace that part of the command with the actual disc name.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro appears to be completely dead and the charger is showing only a very dimmed green light After doing a suspend I wasn't able to \"revive\" my early 2011 MacBook Pro.\n\n\n*\n\n*MBP does not respond to: power, long-power, SMC reset or even battery test button.\n\n*the charger is showing a dimmed green when connected (almost invisible in day light)\n\n*the charger does not have any problem (tested)\n\n\nThe computer is still under warranty (only 6 months old).\n\nA: In the absence of a repair shop to run diagnostics, you might try isolating things in the following order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect all external devices\n\n*Different power adapter\n\n*Remove RAM\n\n*Disconnect / remove the battery and then reset the SMC\n\n*Disconnect hard drive and optical drive\n\n\nAs you remove items, you remove causes of failure. The mac should still POST and beep if everything listed is taken away from the mac. Often, it's an odd part that is causing a failure of the system to charge or drawing too much power when these isolate the issue. In reality, it's likely the DC in board or main logic board, which means it's good you have warranty to cover that eventuality. Do use prudence in doing the above steps, you don't want to physically damage things and run the risk of warranty service being denied due to external damage or someone not technically capable doing work on your mac.\nEven if you don't do all of the steps, you can rule out a few more things than you listed initially in the question. Also, Apple service providers will possibly be able to revert your firmware or at least confirm you have a working firmware install as well as be faster to isolate the cause than most consumers doing the steps listed above as they are set up to do this day in and day out.\n", "Q: Can I move Applications to another partition? My Startup disk partition is just 20 GB and I'm running out of space.\nWhat's the safe way to transfer Applications folder to the other partition?\nCan I just move all apps into a folder on the other partition and create a symlink to it?\n\nA: Just move them is probably the best solution. The user caches and preference files stick with the user home folder, so other than convention - most cases it doesn't really matter which volume contains an application. You'll need sudo or file permission tweaking to actually delete some of the apps, but I've found no downsides to moving any apps to an external drive.\n\nSpotlight still indexes them, updates to the App Store work as long as the drive stays mounted when you want to see that an update is available.\nTools like LaunchBar and others will probably need hand-holding to find your moved applications - especially if you don't place them in /Applications on the destination volume.\nYou will need to re-introduce the moved copies of the App to Launchbar, but in some brief testing, the following apps worked flawlessly when moved to the root of an external drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mail\n\n*iWork 09/Keynote\n\n*Utilities/Terminal\n\n", "Q: How do I merge System partition with another HFS+ partition without data loss? My hard drive is split in three visible partitions: System, Data and Backup.\nI'd like to merge System (OS X Lion) and Data into one partition without data loss.\nDisk Utility won't let me resize the system partition:\n\nThat's my complete setup:\n\nApparently, I can't use mergePartitions because diskutil man says:\n\nmergePartitions [force] format name fromDevice toDevice\nMerge two or more partitions on a disk.\nAll data on merged partitions other than the first will be lost.\n\nI can imagine decreasing Data size, creating a New partition, moving all files from Data to New and proceeding with mergePartitions, thus merging System and Data into System+Data. Then I probably can move stuff from New to the merged System+Data partition and merge them all.\nHowever I'm unsure what will happen to Recovery HD that stands between System and Data. Will it get erased? If so, how can I restore it?\n\nA: There is absolutely no way that you should even think about doing any of this without a complete backup on a separate disk. Verify the backup before beginning.\n1) If you have a complete backup, the easiest way to do this would be to wipe everything, make the partitions you want, and then copy the information back from your backup. If your Recovery HD is deleted, there is no way to re-create it without reinstalling the OS. (At least none that I could find when I was searching recently.)\n2) Assuming you have a backup OTHER than that Backup partition, if you want to attempt to merge these, I would try it in this order: \na. Delete the 'Backup' partition.\nb. Merge 'Data' partition and former 'Backup' partition.\nc. Merge System partition and other partition.\nd. Re-create the 'Backup' partition and restore it from whatever backup you have.\nI have done several live-system partition resizings with no problems. However, the one time that there was a problem, I had to reformat the entire drive and start over.\n\nA: I marked TJ Luoma's answer as correct since his approach looks cleaner, however I decided to take a risk and do a live resizing. In case this might help someone plan their own steps, I leave here a list of my actions. They may not be most rational or correct but they worked for me.\nTHIS IS TERRIBLY DANGEROUS IF YOU DON'T HAVE A VERIFIED, FULL BACKUP. \nNo, really. You can lose all your data, including the system. Don't do it.\nAnd this will work only if Data partition is less than 45% full.\nAnd I'm not even sure this will work for you anyway.\nYou have been warned.\n\nMy steps were as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Recovery HD loader by pressing ⌘R during the boot.\n\n*Open Disk Utility, select my HDD and open Partition tab.\n\n*System partition now has a resize grip. However it is “blocked” by Data partition that comes right after it. I don't have much information on Data so I split it equally in two partitions—let's call them Data A and Data B. Data A is large enough to fit everything Data contained. Data B is empty.\n\n*Click Apply\n\n*Select the disk (the first root item in left pane), open First Aid tab and click Verify Disk. Wait for the verification to end.\n\n*Now we want to move everything from Data A to Data B. I selected Data A in the left pane, clicked Restore tab and dragged Data B to the Destination field. Source is A, destination is B.\n\n*Click Restore and wait for Data A to be copied into Data B.\n\n*Again, select the disk (the first root item in left pane), open First Aid tab and click Verify Disk. Wait for the verification to end.\n\n*Now you have two identical partitions, Data A and Data B. The first one prevents System from resizing. Open Partition tab, select Data A and click the minus glyph (it may not be visible so I included an image—it's just below the list).\n\n\n*Select the disk (the first root item in left pane), open First Aid tab and click Verify Disk. Wait for the verification to end.\n\n*Go to Partition tab and resize System so it takes space that was previously owned by Data A and now is unallocated. Click Apply.\n\n*Select the disk (the first root item in left pane), open First Aid tab and click Verify Disk. Wait for the verification to end.\n\n*Rename Data B to just Data so your volume name doesn't change.\n\n*Quit Disk Utility and boot into OS X.\n\n*Copy whatever data you need from Data to System (it has enough space now).\n\n*Check you really copied the files you need.\n\n*Check again.\n\n*Are you sure?!\n\n*Open Disk Utility in OS X, remove Data and resize System. \n\n*I wish you the best of luck.\n\nA: You don't need to merge them.\nYou can resize partitions right?\nDo such a socoban:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup \n\n*Shrink 'Data' partition (leave just a couple gigabytes free).\n\n*Enlarge 'Backup' partition so you can put stuff from 'Data' somewhere (at least temporary).\n\n*Put everything from 'Data' in some folder on 'Backup'\n\n*Make sure that 'Data' is empty and delete it.\n\n*Now you must have a lot of free space between 'System' and 'Backup' so you can grow 'System' partition or redistribute space between them as you like :)\n\n", "Q: myCloud: Is self-hosting iCloud possible? It seems that Apple is pushing cloud integration all the way now, but also that they have no interest in providing the ability to choose between their own server-side offering (iCloud) and what other companies may have to bring to the table. That seems to make all the nice iCloud client features unusable for certain people (such as Europeans that are forbidden by law to upload certain documents to data centers in North Carolina).\nIs it in any way possible to trick OS X and iOS devices into talking to servers of my choosing other than Apple's, at least for part of the services ? Is there any documentation how iCloud is built? Does it use any standardized protocols at all?\n\nA: Somewhat. Not exactly.\nYou can run an Exchange server which will give you push email, calendar and contacts. This can be configured on all your devices (even pre-iOS 5). This is pretty much what you get from the equivalent iCloud stuff.\nBut there isn't a way to access the Documents in the Cloud or iTunes in the Cloud features without iCloud. (Although you could use Dropbox to store stuff, it doesn't work with iTunes or iWork). This is primarily because Apple wrote the services from the ground up, they aren't using an existing service. So while there are APIs, there aren't standards.\nApple might conceivably open a EU data centre in the future.\n", "Q: How can I compare file structures before and after a software install? I'm writing a new formula for Homebrew for some software I maintain and as part of my testing I'd like to ensure that files are only added to the correct places on install and that all files are removed on uninstall.\nWhat's the best way of going about comparing file structures before and after my test installs and uninstalls?\n\nA: In Terminal I can think of two choice:\n\n\n*\n\n*ls -R.\n\n*tree directory-name/ (after you install it; i.e. brew install tree). The slash at the end preserves the display of special characters in the file the output is saved to.\nIn both case you redirect the output to a file before and after installation and compare the two files possibly using Apple FileMerge.app shipped with Xcode.\n\nA: I like using \"find\" and \"shasum\" for this sort of task.  Two different invocations, 1 for the structure, and another for the sha-1's of the files:\nfind -s /path/to/directory -ls > files-before.txt\nfind -s /path/to/directory -type f -exec shasum \\{} \\+ >> files-before.txt\n\nRun your installs/uninstalls, and then use the same process to \"files-after.txt\".

Any suggestions as to where I should look for memory or any spec I should be looking for in order for it to be compatible ?\n\nA: Do not worry about getting one that is specifically \"for iMacs.\" Any 168-pin PC 100/133 chip should fit just fine.\nI have been working with several iMacs over the last few weeks. From my experience with them, a slot-loader seems to max out at around 1GB (two 512mb chips.)\nIf your RAM is not working, you likely got a bad chip.

At the moment I have my Mac mini connected to my amplifier through HDMI.  The volume button is grayed out so I can only adjust through my amplifier.  The problem is the mini is significantly louder than TV, BluRay etc so I need to constantly adjust the volume when switching between devices.  Is there any way to turn the volume of the mini down when connected to an external device?\n\nA: Data, including video and audio, is sent over the HDMI cable in digital form, not analog.  The only way you could adjust that would be to adjust the content of the digital data, which is a destructive operation.\nDepending on the software used it is also possible that your machine is sending compressed data, such as AC3 or DTS audio, directly to the receiver which decodes it.\nGenerally the solution is on the receiver side, which often has a \"source volume\" adjustment option.\n", "Q: Is there a more-accurate indicator of an app download's progress than what appears in Launchpad? While downloading an application from the Mac App Store, you are presented with a progress indicator in Launchpad, like so:\n\nFor a large install (like Xcode, as shown) this doesn't provide a terribly useful picture of the download's performance (how fast it's going / how much longer it's likely to take).\nIs there any way (perhaps via a command-line tool) to get a more-accurate look at the progress of an App Store download? Something more along the lines of, say, 585,789 Kb / 1,768,231 Kb Downloaded?\n\nA: When you are in the App store, click on the \"Purchases\" button on the top bar. This will give you the total size of the app as well as how much has been downloaded. I think it even gives you an estimated time frame until completion.\n", "Q: Strange user named \"Other…\" on 10.6 Recently, I tried logging out of my machine (rather than just shutting it down) and I noticed that a user with the name \"Other ...\" was present. I don't recall adding the user. I tried checking out System Preferences >> Accounts and it just lists a disabled \"Guest\" account and my main account.\nWhy is this?\n\nA: \"Other\" is not a user. It just allows you to enter a username and password into textboxes instead of clicking on an icon. \nIt can be used to connect to a network domain user. It can also be used for special users, such as \"Root\" (which gives you unlimited control over all hidden and restricted files) and \">console\" (which logs into your Mac in command-line-only mode.)\n", "Q: Improving security of Mac OS X 10.6 I own a 10.6 Macbook Pro with which I have to use a public IP (that does not change) frequently. I'm also required to idle at various IRC channels. As part of security, I use pretty strong passwords, have my firewall up and I do regular updates. I use the Google Chrome browser (again updated) for online browsing. I have file sharing turned off.\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there any more suggestions you'd make to keep my machine more secure?\n\n*Are there any ways to detect if I have keyloggers installed on my machine?\n\n*Any anti-viruses that you would recommend?\n\n*I use colloquy to connect to IRC channels, is there any way I could mask my public IP from people who query it?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Turn on FileVault, don't run suspicious applications, don't use public networks too much, etc. I would also suggest you have a look at Little Snitch or HandsOff. These are applications that detect all incoming and outgoing network connections and allow you to block them. Great apps to see what processes are communicating to what servers, and if you see anything suspicious, you can deny the connection.\n\n*For Keyloggers I suggest you have a look at this site. It has some useful recommendations. \n\n*I don't actually recommend any antivirus for mac. Macs are pretty virus-free: I'd say you are pretty much completely safe if no one hates you, and if somebody does they aren't going to infect your computer with a virus; they'll attempt to hack you, so anti-viruses seem pretty useless on Macs.\n\n*As far as I know, Colloquy should automatically mask your IP. I'm not completely sure about this, and I suggest you have a look at websites that talk about IRC security, such as this one. The final option, I'd say, would be to use a proxy.\nLast, if you would like a complete security guide to Mac OS definitely have a look at this manual by Apple. It has pretty much all the security options you might encounter on Mac OS X. It's quite long, but a few chapters (4, 5, 8, 9, etc) might prove useful to you.\nHope it helps!\nKevin\n\nA: Do not log into an administrator account on your Mac.  Create a user account with limited privileges and use that for IRC and browsing.

We have a family iPad that is registered to my Mom's Apple ID. I'd like to be able to use iMessage, but with my Apple ID, not her Apple ID. Is there a way to do this without deregistering the iPad?\n\nA: iOS devices allow you to use different Apple IDs for different purposes. You can set the Apple ID to be associated with Messages in Settings > Messages. \n\n\n \n\n", "Q: Change bitrate from the default 128kbps for syncing songs to iPhone I have a rather large (>25GB) music collection, and my iPhone is currently almost full.\nI just saw this option in iTunes:\n\nThis would probably be very useful to me, but I'm concerned about sound quality at such a low bitrate. Is it possible to change it to at least 160kbps from the default 128kbps?\nAlso, if I check the box, will the conversion occur on the fly (i.e., seamlessly while copying songs to the iPhone), or will iTunes basically create copies of all my songs in 128kbps AAC (thus causing to take up a lot of space on my Mac)?\n\nA: As far as I know iTunes does not offer any other options for bit-rate conversion. This conversion does indeed happen on-the-fly, as you sync your iPhone with iTunes, which makes the syncing take longer but saves space, so you have not to worry for duplicates on your mac.\nIf space is an issue and you have some spare $25 I also recommend you give a look to iTunes Match: it will allow you to store your music on the Cloud, so you can download the songs as you listen to them thus you have not your huge iTunes library sitting on your iPhone but it still is available when you need it. \n\nA: iTunes will convert the music on the fly. It takes a little time to add a large number of new songs. \nI don't know of any way to change the bitrate when using this feature. \n\nA: I just found out that starting with the latest update to iTunes (10.6 (40)), it is now possible to choose another bitrate.\nOnce you update, you will be able to pick a bitrate between 128 kbps, 192 kbps, and 256 kbps:\n\nMusic will be converted on the fly (without creating additional copies on the computer).\n\nA: There is a severe chance that your headphones won't be capable of producing sound so well that bit rate will make a noticeable difference\n", "Q: How do I get Finder windows to reopen on start up? I just got my new computer with system 10.7.2 and this is really bugging me. I like having a few Finder windows always open. When I shut down and then start up my computer the next day, all the windows I had opened in the Finder are closed save one. It always just has a single Finder window open. If I have 5 windows open when I shut down, I want all 5 of them open the next day. How do I make this happen? I can't stress this enough. The windows won't stay opened on restart.\nIn the general preferences I have the \"Restore windows when quitting...\" button checked. When I shut down, the \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" button always remains checked. I can find no other mention anywhere regarding windows maintenance and it's driving me nuts! This should be a no-brainer but I can't find any way of correcting this situation. It seems everywhere I look on-line, people are having the exact opposite problem.\n\nA: There might be several answers to that.\n\n\n*\n\n*Your restore for finder could be corrupted somehow. Delete the ~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.finder.savedState and give it a try\n\n*Your finder app may be configured NOT to restore the windows.

I don't want to delete the email or the attachment from the email server, I just don't want it to take up space on the iPhone.\nAnd also, is there a way to remove all downloaded attachments, so I don't have to go through each email and find which I have downloaded earlier?\n\nA: The attachments will not remain on the phone past the point that the email itself is in the default number downloaded by Mail (on my iPhone it's 50 most recent messages). Once the message falls out of that, and/or is deleted, its attachments should be removed from the phone memory. \nThe other way to be entirely sure they are gone is to disable 'Mail' in settings for the account you are using, wait a couple of seconds (let it do its thing) and re-enable. This will purge everything related to that mail account and let you redownload just the messages. If you download a lot of attachments versus the amount of mail you receive, it might be worth doing this on a weekly-or-so basis. \n\nA: This is same my problem which I had it.I format my phone completely to solve the memory problem.

Say for example in a program it lets me select one folder and copy it to another location, on a very basic level is that application running commands that I could run in terminal or is it using some internal OS API to make that move?\nPlease spare me any vicious responses; I'm just curious and totally aware it can be perceived as a question a 13-year-old would ask.\n\nA: I'm afraid the answer is \"it depends, but usually the second.\" Actually, even if a GUI program is running terminal commands, it runs them by calling an API.\nA program that is simply a list of terminal commands is called a shell script. Such programs can run in Mac OS X, but they have to either run in a Terminal window or launch a program that uses the GUI if you want to see their output. Other programs can call command line programs through internal APIs.\nWhile most development questions are off-topic for this site, one example that is actually on-topic involves running Automator.\nOne option within the list of internal commands a program created in Automator can call is the ability to call a shell script, or list of Terminal commands. But that is just of of many options available within its internal API.\n\n\nA: One of the great ideas behind Unix is (was) that if you got an idea for a program, then you would first write it as a shell script - essentially calling a series of commands.\nThen, if the program proved to be useful, you could improve on its interface, have users test it, and finally, when you were convinced it was worth it, write a \"real\" program.\nThis, of course, was before graphical user interfaces took over, so a \"program\" here is a CLI command in itself.\nYou still see this approach in some modern programs, especially if they show system information. Want to build a simple app to list all files in a folder? Just run ls -al, parse the result and show it a table. Have fun with the various parameters, and you have your material for version 2.0\n\nA: Conceptually, it always uses OS API - the question is only in what way. There are essentially three options.\n\n\n*\n\n*using low-level OS API (system calls) directly. In your example the task is quite involved: get the list of items in the folder, check the type (folder, file ...), for each of them create the corresponding item in the target folder, for files read the content from the source, write to the target file etc. Since the task is so complex, it is easy to get something wrong, so most applications will avoid this.\n\n*use a library (API) that simplifies the task. For example the Apple Cocoa framework provides NSFileManager class with the copyItemAtPath:toPath:error method which does all the dirty work using low-level OS API, so the application doesn't need to use low-level API itself but can rely on something that requires less work and is always present in the system. Also Apple is likely to make sure that it works well.\n\n*use an external process to do the task. In this case the external process will be using one of the two methods above to do the work. The application has to start such process, monitor it and wait until it is done. It is likely that such process can be run as a command line tool, so this would likely be a command you can run in Terminal. It is not guaranteed, but very possible.\nMost applications will use option 2. because it is more simple than 1. and more safe and efficient than 3. In order to run an external process you need to set it up properly and you have no control over what it does. For example it is much harder to figure out what exactly went wrong in case of a failure and it is hard to know what it is doing (e.g. show progress). That is why in most cases developers will likely choose option 2, but there is no guarantee. A notable example are applications that use shell scripts for customization - such as installers.\nAdvanced user note: you can use dtrace facility of OS X to find out what a particular application is doing. For example, you can check any processes it is spawning so you would see the tools it is using (see execsnoop).\n\nA: Applications can run CLI commands to perform a certain task, and some actually do; but due to efficiency issues, professional application developers avoid running the command and rather use the APIs that the command uses to perform the task required.\n\nA: One class of programs that run terminal commands (even though it all starts with an API call) is the integrated program-development environments such as eclipse or Xcode.  The collection of tools required for program development is prohibitively large to be contained in, and maintained for, an IDE.  Instead, it builds a makefile (a kind of script) and runs it with unix 'make' (or an equivalent) to step through the compile, link, load, and debug process.  Make, in turn, runs the compiler, linker, etc. using their command-line interfaces.  This lets the IDE be relatively independent of the tool-set chosen by the programmer, and insensitive to updates to the tools.\n", "Q: DC++ software for Mac?

I installed a file *.developerprofile. Then I went to the keychain and deleted 3 certificates (they were expired). Everything is OK. But deleted certificates appeared when I rebooted my Mac.

If I jailbreak my iPad, will I be able to use the App Store to download apps and also test the apps I develop?\n\nA: As @Timothy pointed out in the comments, the App Store will work normally on a jailbroken device. As for your own apps, you can run them, but if you don't have a paid developer account it is harder to get them on the device. If you have a paid account, you can use the normal methods to install and run them.\nA device which is not jailbroken will refuse to run any app which is not signed with an Apple-approved certificate. When you jailbreak, the code which performs the checks is modified. It will still only run signed apps, but those apps can be signed by any certificate. Therefore, you can create your own certificate to sign your apps with. However, the normal methods of installing an app will perform the check and refuse to install it. This means you need to find an alternate method of installation, most likely using SSH or USB to copy a package over and modifying permissions.\n", "Q: How to force coloured display of visited links in Safari 5+? Relatively recently most browsers, including Safari disabled the colouring of visited hyperlinks for privacy concerns.\nI do not give a damn about this type of privacy and I consider that this is a huge downgrade of accessibility.\nIs there a way to re-enable this via a hidden setting or extension?\n\nA: You could create a text file, name it visited.css, and put this text in there:\na:visited { color: #6611cc !important; }\n\nThen go to Preferences > Advanced, click Style sheet and select the .css file you just created.

I've been using macports for my MAMP projects for quite some time, but I don't think that the command line server management for Apache and MySQL Server, both from macports, is the best way to do it. I'd like to be able to control those server from one GUI. So, I was wondering if it's possible to configure Lion Server to work with macports' apache version instead of it's native version. Is it possible? What about MySQL Server? Is there a way to control it using Lion server?\n\nA: The short and easy answer is no - you can't just flip a switch to point all the Lion tools and scripts to the same (or similar) programs at a different path.\nThe longer answer, is yes - you can of course replace binary files, and test to make sure all the scripts work and patch any issues that arise either out of changed functionality or in the event that the Apple tools depend on a specific version of your web or database server.\nEveryone I know that wants to install different software on top of Lion just turns off the Lion versions and controls the deployment with other tools like explicit paths, controlling the $PATH variable and alternate control and reporting structures.\n", "Q: Why does iOS take so long to start up? My MacBook Pro running Lion boots in maybe 30 seconds. My original iPad, however, takes several minutes. Why is this? I understand the MBP has a much better processor and more RAM than iPad, but surely that can't cause that much difference—especially since OS X is vastly more complex than iOS.\nRelated: Why do iOS devices take such a long time to turn back on?\n\nA: Well - at the most basic level iOS and Mac OS X are the same kernel and startup processes using launchd and standard unix-heritage programs.\niOS has full sandboxing and arguably tighter access control infrastructure to build up - so in some ways, iOS does more to start up than Mac OS X does.\nOnce you add on mac things, of course it is more extensible so many people have much bigger loads to lift on an OS X reboot than an iOS boot.\nI would argue that all the above arguments are moot and to a first approximation, you are seeing the CPU capability of the Mac hardware shining as well as the read speed of the mac storage as opposed to the iOS storage and the effects of more RAM being a better advantage and more than offsetting the larger library and binary size on Mac OS X.\n", "Q: Reinstall Office 2011 without dmg? I currently run Lion with Office 2011 and need to re-install Lion after wiping out my HD. I however no longer have the DVD with which I installed Office. How shall I go about re-installing it again having no access to the DVD anymore?\n\nA: You can download the Office 2011 Trial and enter your product key in the Setup Assistant. If you also lost your product key, you'll probably need to contact Microsoft Support. You can find info about replacing your DVD at this Microsoft Support page.\n\nA: If you have a working backup on Time Machine, you can reinstall Lion, then run Migration Assistant, restoring both user accounts and applications from the Time Machine drive.\nFor me, this worked to reinstall Microsoft Office without resorting to the physical media and without having to download or re-enter product keys.\n\nA: The trial software download is no longer on Microsoft's page above -- just Office 365.

If you had a NAS and you were going to store all your applications on there, would it be safe to - on the computers accessing it - replace their application folder with a symlink to the folder on the NAS?\n\nA: It would be possible to use the NAS as your applications folder, however you would not be able to create a symlink, as symlinks do not work across different partitions, or network shares.  You would instead mount the share as your applications folder.\nThere are other considerations you may want to be aware of, the first of which is that most NAS shares using windows file sharing would (samba, cifs) do not use a unix style permissions system, so there may be some issues with application permissions.  This could be handled by using a NAS that allows you to export shares using NFS which allows for more compatible permissions on the files.\nThe second issue is that of network connectivity.  If there is a problem with the network, your applications folder will disappear, and this could cause instability with your systems.  To overcome this issue, you may want to only mount the users applications (/Users/username/Applications) over the NAS, and not the system applications (/Applications).  This way important applications such as Finder, etc will be local, and other applications can be installed to the users applications folder.  Be aware, that most shortcuts point to the system applications, not the users applications folder (e.g. in Finders Sidebar the applications folder shortcut usually points to the system applications folder, and applications purchased via the Mac App Store install to the system folder too).  Users may still have problems with certain applications when there are network issues, however it will not effect the whole system.\nThe third issue is your question seems to imply that this applications share will be mounted by multiple users.  This may cause some issues, but applications are not supposed to store user data in the application itself, so you should be fine, however not all applications follow all the guidelines 100%.\nTo mount a share as your applications folder use the command: 'mount shareIpAddress:/pathToShare /Users/username/Applications'  for further information on automating this, you might want to read the Apple document: http://images.apple.com/business/docs/Autofs.pdf\n", "Q: Anyone know about /private/var/keybags/backup_keys_cache.db Today I got a popup message in my iPad2 (jailbroken using absinthe) that it have 0 free space.\nUsing ssh, I check the size of folders in the iPad and found out an interesting file that took 4.1G space and keep growing.\nThe file is /private/var/keybags/backup_keys_cache.db\nThe owner is root user and wheel group.

If so, I would appreciate confirmation that it is possible and steps on how you set things up would be even better.\nMy LDAP is apacheDS and the port it runs on is not 389, so I'm at a loss how an iPhone or iPad can connect to the LDAP.\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge, iOS doesn't (as of 5.0) support accessing an LDAP server on any port other than 389.\n\nA: Most hostname/address fields accept a port in a standard syntax form. I can't test this as I don't have access to an LDAP server on a non-standard port, but hopefully this works for you:\n\nNote the :5385 is my made up port number, obviously you want to enter whatever your LDAP server runs on. Most fields such as browser address bars and other connection strings accept port designation in that matter, immediately following the hostname or IP address, before any additional information.\nHTTP web browsing has an implicit :80 that browsers don't show, ditto for HTTPS and :443.

That said, Time Machine at least used to be able to create a new encrypted disk image on network shares and back up to that. (In fact, under Leopard this was the only way to create an encrypted backup volume for use on a local drive.) \nUnfortunately, I don't know whether the Time Machine service on your Mac Server will store your backup in a per-machine encrypted disk image like Time Machine on Leopard would.

Keep in mind that (a) I am using two screens, (b) Google Chrome is not presently active window.\nIs it even possible?\n\nI am trying to bind this script https://gist.github.com/51b459e5e93210f37e24 with hot-key. What I did is: created a service using Automator (no input, any application). Using services hot key, I've set cmd+r. However, that doesn't do anything.\nMy expected result is: cmd+r does what it should already do in the present app + executes my apple-script.\n\nA: You can put either of these in an Automator service using a applescript Action.\nThen set a keyboard shortcut with the Services in keyboard system preferences's Keyboard Shortcuts. \nNote the  'Service receives' settings in the screen shots. This will make sure the Menu appears in all app's services.\n(The other apps may need to quit and re open before they pick up the short cut) \n\nChrome.\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    reload active tab of (get window 1)\nend tell\n\n\n\n\nSafari.\ntell application \"Safari\"\n    tell document 1 to do JavaScript \"javascript:location.reload(true)\"\nend tell\n\n\n\n\nServices.\n\n\nService Menu -In iTunes\n\n\nA: Well, you could do this over an AppleScript that does this:\ntell application \"Google Chrome\" to activate\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    keystroke \"r\" using command down\nend tell\n\nand then invoke that script over a shortcut. There are some free apps out there that do this job; Mac OS X doesn't offer this, I'm afraid.\n(Maybe you have to replace \"Google Chrome\" with the actual name of the Chrome app; I don't have it installed, so I can't check what its name is.)\n\nA: I recommend using an extension to auto-reload tabs.

How can i change StarDict dictionary language?\nI want to set it to English.\n\n\nA: There is a freeware, Language Switcher, to launch an app in a different language.\nOr, you check another thread for more detail: Is it possible to launch a program in a specific language?\n", "Q: OS X won't boot. errno 19 I have a MacBook with OS X on one partition, a few other partitions and a Bootcamp Windows 7 on another partition.\nRight now, I can boot into Windows but I cant boot into OS X. I am typing this while using Windows as the host OS.\nWhen I boot into OS X I get the prohibited sign, and boot into OS X via Safe Mode, I see hfs_mountroot failed: 5\ncannot mount root, errno = 19\nAt first glance this seems to be an I/O issue, that my harddrive is dying or something, but the Windows partition works flawlessly.\nSo something has happened to the boot on that OS X partition. Other places on the net say the drive is done and that I need to image it or that I need the OSX startup disc but even then its a gamble. But I disagree since it is clearly that one partition that is having some issues with its boot protocol and not the entire hard drive.\nTo further illustrate my point, my Windows 7 has MacDrive installed, and I can browse all the files on my OS X HFS+ partitions!\nWith that in mind, is there anything I can do to get my OS X boot partition to work again? Thank you!\n\nA: What you may be able to try is running the fsck command in Single User Mode. As soon as you press the power button on your computer, press and hold Command+S until a terminal interface appears. When you see this: root:$ or something similar, type fsck -f and press enter. This will start a file system check which will most likely solve your problems. When it is finished, type reboot and press enter.\nFor my own curiosity, can you perhaps take a picture of the results? I'd be curious to see what it finds.\n\nA: I would boot from the OS X start up disc that came with your machine as a first step. From there you can launch Disk Utility and run \"Verify Disk.\" Although it may not be a hardware issue, this is a good, safe place to start your diagnostic workflow from, since it does not involve any wipe or reinstall of your root OS. If Disk Utility reports that the disk is damaged, it may be able to fix the problem. See if that gives you any clarification or resolves your problem before anything else.\nGood luck!  \n", "Q: Safari Web proxy I have a question about setting proxies in Safari for the Mac. In Network preferences one can configure a Web proxy - HTTP, which has the field: \"Bypass proxy settings for these Hosts&Domains\". Is there a way to bypass any host or domain, but apply proxy only to one specific host?\nEDIT: Found a good link about that - http://nscsysop.hypermart.net/proxypac.html\n\nA: You should not use the Web proxy, but to use the Automatic Proxy Configuration, and setup a .pac file.  In this file, you specify which domain/hosts you want the proxy.\nCheck wiki, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config, for more information.\nA sample may looks like:\nfunction FindProxyForURL(url, host) \n{\n  PROXY = \"PROXY 127.0.0.1:8000\";\n  DEFAULT = \"DIRECT\";\n\n  var domain_list = [\n    \"blahblahblah.com\"\n  ];\n\n  for (var i = domain_list.length - 1; i >= 0; i--){\n    if (dnsDomainIs(host,domain_list[i])) {return PROXY}\n  };\n}\n\nThe other simple way is to use the Firefox, and install an extension, Autoproxy.\n\nA: Don't know too much about this, but I've used glimmerblocker.org to muck around with the  appearance of a few individual sites (via tweaking their css). I know Glimmer Blocker is far more powerful than that, so it might be of some help to you.\n", "Q: Can macOS system open zip and tar archives natively? I have to upload an archive for some Linux, Windows and Mac OS users. I'm using Linux so I'm sure everybody could handle a tar file, Windows users will get some problems, so I think zip is the best way. \nAre these formats native?\n\nA: OS X can handle both by default from Finder. The Archive Utility that ships with OS X knows how to extract both formats. Just double click on the file or Cmd-Click (or right click) on the archive and select 'Open' from the list and OS X will unarchive it.\nUsers also have access to zip, unzip and tar from a Terminal window command line. These all come with OS X.\nThere's also the free, and most excellent, Unarchiver that they can install that allows for a few more options when dealing with compressed files. It also supports a few more formats. But it's completely unnecessary for extracting gzip-compressed tar archives and zip archives.\n", "Q: Organize iOS App Icons, Sort, Rearrange Is there a faster way to sort hundreds of iOS app icons on app pages than to use iTunes?\n\nA: I like to use \"MultiIcon Mover\"\n\nYou hold your finger down - like usual - but then instead of having to drag each one individually...  you just tap on the ones you want to move... even if they're on separate pages.  they get \"highlighted with a checkmark... and then you navigate to the \"page\" that you want to put them on. Hit the home button and they'll all plop onto that page. (space permitting)\nYou can sort hundreds of icons in just a few minutes.  No more ridiculous dragging around.\nJailbreak only.  Find it on Cydia.\n\nA: It's still manual, but one way to organize icons a bit more more efficiently in iTunes is to hold SHIFT to multi-select icons (or folders) on a single screen. You can drag them to another screen (or into a folder, or out of a folder) all at once.\nDefinitely makes things easier.\n\nA: Springboard app icon layout order data is stored under IconState.plist. It is located under /User/Library/SpringBoard or /private/var/mobile/Library/SpringBoard/.\nYou could use plutil -xml IconState.plist to convert the binary plist file to XML and plutil -binary IconState.plist to convert it back to binary.\nTo sort by app category, use plutil -showjson /User/Applications/*/iTunesMetadata.plist > appmetadata.json.\nUpdate: This website, IconState, can convert plists and sort icons.\n", "Q: How can I convert AC3 audio files to AAC? I had a friend with a BluRay drive extract the audio from my copy of a concert BluRay disc into AC3 files which he returned to me, but now I'm not sure what the best way would be to convert those AC3 files into AAC files.\nI've read that it's not possible to go directly from AC3->AAC, but instead have to use WAV as an intermediary; AC3->WAV->AAC. I can probably figure out how to do this, but why should I be the one to make two steps? Is there software already available (free preferred, but not required) that will simply let me plug in an AC3 file and get an AAC equivalent out?\nWhen I say AAC equivalent, that means identical channel setup to the source AC3 files by default, but perhaps also preferences to constrain it to 2 channel or anything else I'd like.\nI've already tried using Handbrake and Max to no avail.\n\nA: VideoLAN can do this. Select \"Streaming/Transcoding Wizard\" from the File menu. Choose \"Transcode/Save to file\". On the next page click \"Choose\" and open your AC3 file. On the next page tick \"Transcode audio\" and choose \"MPEG 4 Audio\" and choose the desired bitrate. Click \"Next\", choose \"MPEG 4 / MP4\", click \"Next\" again and \"Choose...\" where to save the file. \"Next\" and \"Finish\".\nThe file VideoLAN creates has the extension .mp4, change it to .m4a and there you go.\n\nA: Would using Automator to run Apple- or shell-scripts that call ffmpeg be a workable solution? This site has some ideas on AC3 to MP3 using ffmpeg. The first comment mentions this which seems pretty close:\nffmpeg -i audio.ac3 -acodec libmp3lame -ar 48000 -ab 256k -ac 2 output.mp3\n\n\nA: I was playing with this problem today and while I didn't find a batch process solution, I did learn something that may me useful to others faced with this problem.\nIf you install the Perian QuickTime components, QuickTime Player X will open and play AC3 files. Unfortunately, it will not export them. However, if you use QuickTime Player 7 Pro (again, with Perian installed) you can export an AC3 file into an AIFF or WAV format. Once you have the file saved in one of those formats, it is trivial to create an Automator Droplet (or service) to convert the files into an AAC/MP4 format.\n\n\nA: The Audacity 1.3 beta claims to import AC3 files and will export M4A/AAC so long as the ffmpeg libraries are installed.\nI can tell you the software opens cleanly and imports an AAC file, but I have no AC3 files with which to test it.\n\nA: It's not pretty, but if you'd prefer a GUI app, Audio Converter should do what you need. It's 99¢ on the App Store, or free from their site.\n\nA: Personally recommend some tools or guides which I have used to convert AC3 to AAC to help you solve your issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Format Factory: it supports converting AC3 to AAC and is free.\n\n*VideoLAN: this tool is free too and I can use it to convert AC3 to AAC. Just follow the guide Max Ried offered.\n\n*A useful step by step guide: this guide tells us how to convert AC3 to AAC, MP3, WAV, etc.\n\n\nHope the above all will help you more or less.\n", "Q: I know how to repair disk permissions. But... Who broke them? One of the common Mac troubleshooting steps everyone always seems encouraged to try first is to \"repair disk permissions\" in Disk Utility.\nThis process usually finds random odd problems, fixes them, and on rare occasions it actually makes a difference.\nBut...\nHow on earth are random files ending up with their disk permissions changed in the first place?\nThat seemingly crucial operating system files are ending up randomly tampered with is actually a bit disturbing to me. What is causing this? Why after a decade of telling people to \"repair permissions\" hasn't some sort of lock been applied to prevent permissions from being inappropriately changed in the first place?\nWhat is the real story here?\n\nA: Many factors might come into mind. A process with root privileges is the main cause.\nThink about an Application that you grant permissions to install using your Admin password. This Application might not have permissions set properly for certain folders that are installed in key OS location (i.e. /Library) would cause the permissions to change.\nThink about a process in an Application that is granted a root privilege and does tamper with permissions in folders incorrectly.\nThe idea of locking the permissions is nice, but that would be implemented at this time with a no-write permission. Unless of course there is lock-permission-only flag is used; something I don't know if it exists.\n", "Q: Malware possibilities in jailbroken iPad 2 iOS 5.0.1 Yesterday I asked a question here:\nAnyone know about /private/var/keybags/backup_keys_cache.db\nToday after corresponding with my friend via email about this, I found another suspicious file:\nAbiFathirs-iPad:~ root# ls /private/var/mobile/ -al\ntotal 10256\ndrwxr-xr-x   7 mobile mobile      340 Feb 19 07:15 ./\ndrwxr-xr-x  30 root   wheel      1156 Feb 18 23:52 ../\n-rw-------   1 mobile mobile     3738 Feb 19 07:15 .bash_history\n-r--r--r--   1 mobile mobile       10 Oct  6 10:31 .forward\ndrwx------   2 mobile mobile      170 Feb 16 17:34 .ssh/\ndrwxr-xr-x 252 mobile mobile     8568 Feb 19 00:40 Applications/\ndrwxr-xr-x   3 root   mobile      102 Jan 26 15:26 Documents/\ndrwxr-xr-x  43 mobile mobile     1496 Feb 18 23:22 Library/\ndrwxr-x---  17 mobile mobile      612 Feb  1 11:30 Media/\n-rw-r-----   1 root   mobile 10485760 Feb 19 07:15 log.0000000001\n\nI transfer the log file above into my ubuntu machine, then try to see the content of the file:\n➜  Downloads  hd log.0000000001\n00000000  00 00 00 00 1c 00 00 00  7e 04 55 18 88 09 04 00  |........~.U.....|\n00000010  0d 00 00 00 00 00 a0 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n00000020  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|\n*\n00a00000\n\nMy friend suggest me to check the log.

Does anybody know how songs hold genius info, and does changing a track name affect this?\nOriginally, I assumed each track had some sort of metadata which said how it should be turned into a genius playlist. This way, only songs with entries in gracenote would be able to make a genius playlist.\nHowever, the other day, I bought an album, and when importing it into iTunes, fount it had no gracenote recognition. I added all the details (artist, track name, ect) manually.\nA day or so later, I discovered that a couple of tracks could make a genius playlist, even when they weren't recognised on gracenote!\nSo now I assume that the data is held using the details that the track has (artist, genre ect.).\nMy problem is, if the data is stored by the details a track has, will changing the details remove the ability to create a genius playlist? I have many tracks where I have changed the details (ie. \"Track\" by \"Artist feat. Artist\" to \"Track [feat. Artist]\" by \"Artist\")\nSo does anybody know how this data is stored, and will it affect my genius playlists?\n\nA: The song name, album name and length are used for recognition by Gracenote - which means when you changed and added the song details manually, it was recognised. \nAs far as I know, the same details are used for Genius, so anything that Gracenote recognises will work - and the playlists are made on Apple servers. \n\nA: I found a large (140,040 KB) file named \"iTunes Library Genius.itdb\" in my iTunes music folder.  I tried to view it but it is all non-printable characters. I think the Genius information is stored locally.\n", "Q: Better tabs management in Safari 6.x I'm looking for extensions to allow the Safari 6.x versions to manage a large number of open tabs better than the current implementation.

However, I never started having the issue until after I installed the update.\n\nA: Have you tried this Apple KB article Troubleshooting Wi-Fi issues in OS X Lion and Mac OS X v10.6\n", "Q: A programmatic method for disabling all sharing services? I'm seeking a programmatic method for disabling all the sharing services on a Mac. My preference is for an AppleScript or a shell script.\nI'd like to have the services shown in the picture below disabled when I execute the script. The solution should be compatible with Alfred, Keyboard Maestro or any other global productivity tool.\nThe services I'd like to disable are:\n\nI could come up with the following with some googling:\nFile sharing (on/off)\ndo shell script \"/usr/sbin/AppleFileServer\" password \"x\" with administrator privileges\ndo shell script \"/usr/bin/killall AppleFileServer\" password \"x\" with administrator privileges\n\nInternet Sharing (on/off)\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.InternetSharing.plist\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.InternetSharing.plist        \n\n(I would prefer terminal commands or batch scripts to apple scripts.

I have a MacBook Pro with Mini DisplayPort and I want to use target display mode to use a Thunderbolt iMac as an external display. If this works, would I need a Mini DisplayPort cable or a Thunderbolt cable?\n\nA: According to this source, you won't be able to do that. You have to have a Thunderbolt Mac and use a Thunderbolt cable to use a Thunderbolt iMac as an external display. This other source has a table that confirms it. Sorry!\n", "Q: Exclude IPod from play count in iTunes Is there a way for avoiding the update to my play counts when I sync my iPod?\n\nA: A forum post from 2005 suggests that \"Manually manage music and videos\" prevents play counts from syncing, but this may have changed in the last 6-7 years. This option is found on the Summary page when the iPod is selected in iTunes.\n\nA: I can confirm this. Play counts and ratings don't update to iTunes if you select to manually manage music and videos on your iOS device.\nIn iTunes 10.6.3, there's no option to ignore play counts and ratings when you sync with certain iOS devices.\n", "Q: Why does the iPhone 4S treat a generic 30 pin cable as a line out source? I have an iPhone 4S, the original iPhone 4S AC to USB adapter, and a generic Dynex brand 30 pin cable. When ever this cable is connected to the iPhone sound will not play over the built in iPhone speakers. If headphones are plugged in they work fine, but when they are removed sound will not play on the iPhone's built in speaker. If I swap in the original cable that came with the iPhone it works as expected. Any ideas why the iPhone 4S thinks this cable and configuration is a line out source?\n\n\nA: That's a third-party cable, not an official Apple cable, so what's probably happening is that for some reason that cable is bridging the 2nd and 11th pins, telling the device to send the audio out the 3rd and 4th pins:\nFrom http://pinouts.ru/PortableDevices/ipod_pinout.shtml:\n\n\n2  GND     Audio & Video ground (-), internally connected with Pin 1 on iPod motherboard\n3  Right   Line Out - R (+) (Audio output, right channel)\n4  Left    Line Out - L(+) (Audio output, left channel)\n11     AUDIO_SW    If connected to GND the iPhone sends audio signals through pin 3-4, otherwise it uses onboard speaker.\n\n", "Q: What is another source for Dashboard widgets? On the Apple Dashboard widgets page, the most recent app (found at the top of the Just Added section) is The Weather Channel Widget, released on February 14, 2011. Where can I find some more recent widgets?\n\nA: The widget download page was a curated approach to enabling a single place to locate and install widgets from.  Developers would submit a Widget and associated details and host the file for downloads.\nThe lack of updates is down to 1 of 2 things:  1) Apple stopped accepting additions and ammendments to the listings, 2) Developers stopped submitting updates.\nBoth are probably true, and certainly a lot of developers stopped writing widgets in order to write iOS apps and such like instead, at least according to the anecdotal information I am aware of.\nHowever, the listings as they stand are useful for identifying good widgets, just because no updates are listed doesn't mean none are available.  I searched for Time Machine Buddy which is a useful widget I use.  It's still listed, but at an older version on the Apple site.  However the link to the developer is included which allows me to check and download an updated version direct from the developer.\nUnlike iOS apps, widgets can be hosted and downloaded from anywhere, they didn;t have to go onto the Apple site alone.  So you can use the directory to find interesting things, and then hit the developers direct to find updated version.\nIf a download link is dead, or the developer is no more, you can still find the download site useful to get the name of a widget, and then use tools like osx.iusethis.com to search for alternatives.\n\nA: Here are some Mac OS X Dashboard related links where you can get new widgets, tips and help:\nhttp://the.dashboard.onemac.org\nhttp://macwidgets.onemac.org\nEnjoy ;-)\n", "Q: Deleting undated files from Time Machine I just bought a new MacBook Pro with Lion.  I restored my files and apps from the MacBook with Snow Leopard, etc., from Time Machine.  All seemed to have uploaded correctly, but after using several weeks, I did find missing files . . . which I recovered by going back into Time Machine and simply uploading those files.  Recently, while attempting to back up my machine, I got an error message stating, \"This backup is too large for the backup disk. The backup requires 467.34 GB but only 155.61 GB are available.\"   I realized that all the old data needed to go, except I wanted to save 3 backups from the old computer to ensure that I could recover the files, should I find others missing. Easy enough, I thought!  Wrong!\nI opened Time Machine, navigated the window to the MacBook Pro setting, went back in time to select the date before which and including I wanted to delete the old files.  Much to my dismay, only files after February 12 were dated, the others were gray, contained no dates and were impossible to select.  So, now what?\nSadly, I could have avoided this, had I delete old data before I uploaded files to the new computer.  But, I'm afraid my learning curve runs behind my needs.  \"Coulda, woulda, shoulda!\"  So, now what?  Help, please!\n\nA: Your best bet is to turn off Time Machine, eject the backup drive and get some help from someone trained to know what Time Machine looks like.\nIt's entirely possible, the software deleted the old files and over-wrote them with new backups. It's also possible you had a minor glitch in the permissions and all is well.\nAssuming you are near a retail store, you can usually get a quick read from someone in the store or worst case, make a support request at the bar. Phone support is also an option, but I've found that taking the backup drive and the mac (as well as your old mac drive / CPU) in to the store is the fastest way to get someone seeing exactly what is going on and your data uncertainty sorted.\n\nAs much as I like to help guide people, it's really best to disconnect the drives and reduce the risk of more files getting deleted and not learn on this one instance if you can get some professional help on this.\n", "Q: Can I use wifi on my iPhone 3G without a sim card? \nPossible Duplicate:\nCan you use an iPhone without a SIM card as an iPod Touch? \n\nI bought an iPhone 3G that is currently off and doesn't have a sim card. Is there any way I can enable the wifi without having a sim card?\n\nA: Yes, this works fine.  Just use it as normal, so long as it is not in Airplane Mode it should be no different to having one in.  You may see the odd \"no sim card\" message at the lock screen, but just ignore it.\nTo test, I just removed my sim, I received a \"no sim card\" message (which you cannot \"ok\" to make it go away), but proceeded to unlock, open a webpage, re-lock and the message had gone.  Everything worked.\n", "Q: How to configure postgresql in Lion I am new in mac os. I was trying to install Postgresql.

I have a plan to install Postgis and PgRouting package in my PostgreSQL for one of my project.\n\nA: First up, what's the error you're getting, and how are you getting it? Are you trying to re-run the installer?\nIn answer to two, take a look at http://www.jonathandean.com/2011/08/postgresql-8-4-on-mac-os-x-10-7-lion/ who seems to have gotten it sorted.\nThere absolutely is a GUI for PostgreSQL, it's called pgAdmin 3 (or pgAdmin III). If you successfully installed the OS X version of PostgreSQL from their site, then you should already have it (take a peek in Launchpad). If it's not there, you can get it at http://www.pgadmin.org/ but read the downloads page carefully---it isn't well sorted and the most up-to-date version is in the middle of the list.\nAs EmmEff said, in future Homebrew or MacPorts might be easier (especially if you like playing around!) since you can wipe the install cleanly.\n\nA: To avoid all those heartaches, you might want to check out Postgres.app. Just copy to the Applications folder and you're done. From the Github page:\n\nPostgres.app is the easiest way to get started with PostgreSQL on the\n  Mac. Open the app, and you have a PostgreSQL server ready and awaiting\n  new connections. Close the app, and the server shuts down.\n\nAs for the client, check out Navicat. Good luck!\n", "Q: Error 1 when restoring iPad I bought an used iPad 2 recently.

The logic board, graphics card, and hard disk were replaced in October 2009. \nSometime in the last few months the machine began to 'spontaneously logout' - I'll be using the machine normally, there's an unexpected pause - then blue screen/login dialog. The console logs show that the window_server has crashed. I can't find a way to reliably reproduce this, other than to simply wait - it now happens daily. The problem occurs in response to some interface event, typing or moving the mouse - I (still) use Spaces, and the most common trigger seems to be switching between spaces. \nI've spent a lot of time reading various threads describing similar problems, often associated with the nVidia graphics card, but haven't yet found a solution (or even been able to localize the problem). I've tried many possible fixes: backed out all 3rd party kernel extensions, minimized the set of active applications, purchased/installed new memory, run the apple diagnostics, tested/verified the disk appears ok, removed all apps which were starting on login, disabled the screensaver, the hard disk sudden motion sensor, the battery has been replaced, I'm not actively running (but have loaded - Office 2008) some Rosetta apps... none of this has made a difference.\nAny advice is appreciated.\n\nA: Although I can't be 100% certain I've fixed the problem, it's now been 3 weeks w/o a reboot - in my case, I believe the fix was turning OFF the 3D graphics acceleration option in VMWare (I run VMWare Fusion, w Win XP vms, constantly).\n\nA: Create a new user account, login to that, and use the machine \"normally\" to see if the same issue exists.  At least that will pinpoint whether it's a software or hardware problem.\n", "Q: Can't relaunch Finder and the menubar is missing I booted up my MacBook Air (running Mac OS X Lion) and the desktop doesn't have a menubar.  I used option+right-click to relaunch Finder and there isn't an option to relaunch it.  When I launch an application the menubar shows up.  When I cmd+q to quit the application the application's window closes but the menubar then defaults to the last currently open application.  Even if it's on a different virtual desktop.  \nWhen I reboot the computer I notice that the keyboard is no longer backlit by default.  The keyboard only becomes backlit after I correctly enter my password.  I don't know if this is related to the problem stated in the first paragraph.  It may or may not be relevant.  I don't know.  \nAny thoughts or ideas?  I've never seen a desktop in Mac OS X that didn't have a menubar.  \nTo recap: No menubar, no date, time, Spotlight icon etc. when all applications are closed.  They show up when I launch an application.  Option to relaunch Finder is gone.\n\nA: Try quitting Finder using Activity Monitor (in Utilities). It's in Launchpad there too. Scroll down the list of processes till you see Finder, click it and then choose Quit Process from the toolbar. Choose \"Force Quit\" at the dialog.\nIf Finder isn't in the list of applications in Activity Monitor, you can manually start it. It's located at /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app. If you can't get to it by browsing (because Finder isn't running!) you can always use Terminal. It's in Utilities too. Just type\nopen /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app\n\ninto the window and hit return.\n\nA: try restarting the process called \"SystemUIServer\" and post what happens as a comment to this answer. I'll update my answer with any possible insight i can give.\n\nA: I know a really easy way to fix this(if you have an Apple TV). Go to someone else's laptop and duplicate finder and put on a USB flash drive. Put the flash drive in your computer and turn on the Apple TV and aim and press the button on the remote at your computer (iTunes should open up). In iTunes, go to the Apple icon in the top left corner and open System Preferences. Go to accounts and press the plus sign next to the minus sign. Something should come up that has your USB drive on the sidebar. Go to your flash drive drive, select Finder and click \"add\".\nOnce you have done that, select Finder in the list of things to open up once you log in. Log out of your account and log back in.

For instance how is root mounted and such? Also for instance, how is removable media mounted?\n\nA: I know this is probably a bit late for your uses, but my understanding is that this is determined by the file /etc/auto_master.

With some key combo (can't remember what I did!) I managed to get a black screen with text output - see image. Can anyone offer an interpretation? I'm imagining the logic board is fried.\n\n\nA: Not necessarily a logic board issue (but it is possible!).\n1) It may be a RAM Issue: easiest way to test is crack it open (if it's the old non-unibody one then that's not too bad) and try running it with either stick removed. If you get the same issue it's onto...\n2) An issue with the installation: there's a chance it could be a weird problem at a very low level of the installation, if you've still got the install discs and don't have any data you can't afford to lose try reinstalling.

However...\n4) The processor/logic board is done: and either way if it's either then you're down to opening that puppy up and replacing it. \n\nA: If you have access to a FireWire cable and another Mac, consider booting your MacBook in target disk mode. If your computer responds and boots, you can then copy files off your machine and also attempt a permissions repair (not that I think this will cure your problem.\nFor this discussion, your problematic MacBook is Computer #2 and the other Mac is Computer #1.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Computer #1.\n\n*Plug a FireWire cable into #1.\n\n*Connect Computer #2 to power.\n\n*Connect the FireWire cable to #2.\n\n*Boot #2, holding down the T key until the FireWire logo appears.\n\n\nAt this point you should be able to see Computer #2 in the Finder on Computer #1. It will act as a regular hard drive as far as Computer #1 is concerned.\nRetrieve your needed files, use Disk Utility to Repair the disk and Restore permissions. You can even check it with a program like Drive Genius for errors.\nIf the MacBook boots to Target disk mode, you know it's not the motherboard or RAM.

When I restart my Mac it quits and saves the buffers for each tab properly, since it's there again when the computer starts back up. But the command history is not buffered properly per window/tab. They're all the same buffer. \nI'm assuming it's because bash uses the same ~/.bash_history for all terminals but is there a way to avoid improve this? To make bash, or maybe Terminal, store them separately?\n\nA: I implemented this by adding\nexport HISTFILE=\"$HOME/.bash_history_$TERM_SESSION_ID\"\nif [ ! -e $HISTFILE ]; then cp \"$HOME/.bash_history\" \"$HISTFILE\"; fi\n\nto my ~/.bash_profile file. Now when I close terminal and open it again, each tab has its separate command history restored. Also when I create new tab, default history is initialized from .bash_history\nAlso to make Terminal app to preserve opened tabs between quit and restart you need to make sure that option \"close windows when quitting app\" (on Yosemite) is disabled in System Preferences -> General.\n\nA: You could do something like this in your .bashrc:\nMYTTY=`tty`\nHISTFILE=$HOME/.bash_history_`basename $MYTTY`\n\nThis will create separate history files in your home directory such as .bash_history_ttys002.  When you create a new terminal window, it will use the history file corresponding to the tty name, which will usually be determined simply by the order in which you create the terminal windows.\n\nA: You can set a custom $HISTFILE for each of you Terminal instances.\n", "Q: Will this brand of third-party RAM work in my Mid 2010 iMac? I am looking to update my iMac's Mid 2010 RAM from 4GB to 12GB and wondering if this RAM is alright to use and what is the difference between the two sets of RAM because they are the same price, both for the iMac/Macbook Pro but have slightly different configurations.\nhttp://www.scan.co.uk/products/8gb-(2x4gb)-corsair-apple-imac-macbook-macbook-pro-ddr3-so-dimm-pc3-10666-(1333)-non-ecc-unbuffered-\nhttp://www.scan.co.uk/products/8gb-(2x4gb)-corsair-apple-macpro-ddr3-so-dimm-pc3-8500-(1066)-non-ecc-unbuffered-cas-7-7-7-20-150v\nUsing crucial.com, their system scanner tells me my system is a mid-2011 iMac even though I am 100% sure it is Mid-2010 because my system was bought in 2010 and says it in the system preferences.

Upgrading from 10.5.8 to 10.6.3\nAs I understand I need to back up my files. Is this a precautionary measure or do I necessarily have to reinstall all my files after upgrading the os?\n\nA: This is just a precautionary measure, for the case if something goes wrong. If the update runs w/o any troubles (which should be the case) you don't need to reinstall all your files.\nI've just configured time machine before updating my mac, and in that way you are on the safe side.\n\nA: It's always wise to have backups of your stuff, not just for when you upgrade, but always if you have even a single document of photo that you do not want to lose.\nAdvise to backup is a common precaution before attempting any major upgrade, either to an application or to the whole Operating System.  Whilst any upgrade failure is unlikely to harm your data, it could result in (rare cases) a system that you cannot boot, which effectively leaves you unable to access your data even though it's still actually perfectly fine. \n", "Q: How to restore Airport settings? I've just reverted from Lion to Snow Leopard while maintaining a time machine backup of Lion.\nIn Lion I used to 'remember' many wireless networks, and also have configuration for connecting from my phone. How can I recover all that using Time Machine?\n\nA: The stored passwords for Wi-Fi networks (as well as many other things) are stored in your keychain file.  the easiest way to get stuff out of this is if you have a MobileMe account which has the option to synchronize the keychain, so it will appear automatically just by logging in to MobileMe.\nThere are 2 drawbacks to this:\n\n\n*\n\n*You need network connectivity to login, and so if you don't have an available network because you don't have the key you are out of luck,\n\n*MobileMe is deprecated, and the functionality is not subsequently available through it's replacement iCloud.\n\n\nYou could always boot from your Time Machine backup, open up the Keychain Access command and export the keys you want.  They will be stored as files within the backup, but are encrypted so not a lot of use. It may be possible to import the keychain if you can find it (I'm not at a Mac right now so can't check for location) and you know the administrator password for the system is came from, but I'll leave that for another user to comment on or provide an answer for.\n", "Q: Using the \"find -name\" command on OS X In the command find theres a switch called name but it doesn't exist in OS X, whats the equivalent switch for OS X? \n\nA: Actually you can use the find command as in unix e.g.: find . -name \"*.log\"\nAt least on all of my mac systems works this.\nsee 'man find':\n-name pattern\n         True if the last component of the pathname being examined matches\n         pattern.

I have my windows all laid out as I like them.\nOn Fridays, I telecommute, using my Macbook Pro (1440 x 900) to connect to my work iMac using screen sharing. I use SwitchResX to change the resolution of the iMac to 1440 x 900. I then rearrange all of my windows to the new resolution.\nI have Optimal Layout and it helps in positioning the windows, but it does not support any mechanism for remembering groups of window positions and sizes.\nIs there any alternative program that will allow me to configure my windows for 2560 x 1440 and save the sizes and positions for all of them as a group, then reposition them for 1440 x 900 and, again, save them as a group? Then on Fridays I will only need to tell the application to lay the windows out for 1440 x 900 and on Mondays for 2560 x 1440.\n\nA: I found a nice application, Stay, that seems to do exactly what I need. I'll try it out this next Friday when I telecommute.\n\nA: It seems you can also go the Unix way and use an .Xdefaults file in your home directory. The syntax for the file is here.\nThis should work on OSX too, by following these steps (taken from here):\n\nYou can just make your own .Xdefaults file in a text editor and save it to the root of your home directory. However, since Apple's X11 does not look for it (it doesn't look for a .Xresources or .Xdefaults - you can name your file either one), you will need to point to it in your .xinitrc file.\n  use a line like xrdb -load $HOME/.Xresources in your .xinitrc file to load the .Xdefaults (or .Xresources) file you create.\n  P.S. if you don''t have your own custom .xinitrc file in your home directory, X11 will use the one in /etc/X11/xinit. You can just copy this one to your home directory (rename it as .xinitrc) and edit it rather then the default copy. \n\n", "Q: where do I get openGL driver monitor? I stumbled upon this interesting documentation from Apple mentioning OpenGL Driver Monitor. So I searched for that tool but is nowhere to be found. How can I get that tool?\n\nA: In the latest version of Xcode (4.4), OpenGL Driver Monitor and similar tools are no longer included. You need to download \"Graphics Tools for Xcode\" from Apple's Mac developer downloads (requires free developer account).\n\nA: You would need to install the developer tools, which is on the App Store for free if you have lion.  If not, you can download Xcode 3.2 from Apple's developer site.  Then, the app should be in /Developers/Application/Graphics Tool/\n\nA: You won't find it in the Open GL ES Performance Detective. It is for iOS devices only. Instead open up Open GL Profiler and under Open GL Profiler's Views menu, you'll see Open GL Driver Monitor. You'll get these when you download the Graphics Tools bundle accessible from Xcode's Menu Xcode | Open Developer Tools | More Developer Tools.\nYou will need the developer tools installed and that will need an installation of Xcode 4.2.1 or earlier.\nThat said, it is a hack, I get this message on starting the Profiler\nApp version 4.6 (68) is not the same as nub version 4.5 (66) at path: /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/PlugIns/GLProfilerFBDisp.bundle\n\nProfiler will not function correctly and may quit unexpectedly\n\nYet it does work.\n", "Q: Do I need Lion on a MacBook to use iCloud? As a new user, I'm trying to wrap my brain around iCloud for backup and am wondering if the following things are all true:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I use iCloud to back up all the files on my MacBook?\n\n*To use iCloud, do I need Lion installed (as opposed to older Mac OS)?\n\n*After I've bought Lion, is there a fee to use iCloud with my mac?\n\n\nA: 1. Can I use iCloud to back up all the files on my MacBook?\niCloud is used to store the data that an iCloud enabled application has saved.  It is not a backup mechanism for your Mac, however in principle it can form part of a backup system.  iCloud doesn't show up as one simple folder on the mac that syncs (the DropBox model of cloud storage) but instead has a fairly well hidden folder in ~/Library for ad-hoc syncing/backup and instead requires each application to tell the mac which documents should be cached locally and \"stored in the cloud\".\nFor example, if your system is modern enough to support internet recovery, then you effectively have the OS not exactly backed up as such, but available for a restore withut the need for having copies of the physical media.  Of course, you lose your system preferences, user accounts and indeed everything else, but you can recover an OS installation to a default level easily.  On top of tis, if you then login to your Apple ID on the App Store, you can then download all your apps that you have purchased.  Of course again there is no guarantee that this will be all of your apps, but for some it may well be.  Once you have recovered your OS and your Apps, any Apps that use iCloud will then have their data available for use.\nSo, in certain scenarios it's the final pin in the recovery of your data, but it's by no means by itself a full backup solution, and you will need to cater (preferable via Time Machine) for a better solution unless you never change your prefs, and only use app store apps. Think of iCloud as storing just a few critical documents from just a few critical apps, and not currently a viable total backup solution.\n2. To use iCloud, do I need Lion installed (as opposed to older Mac OS)?\nLion (OS X 10.7) is the minimum OS version required to use iCloud, You can gain access to the App Store from 10.6.6 onwards which is the only place where you can download iCloud enabled applications anyway, but be aware that just because you can buy an iCloud Enabled App Store app pre-Lion, you may not be able to use it.\n3. After I've bought Lion, is there a fee to use iCloud with my mac?\nThere is no seperate iCloud fee, accounts are free in perpetuity, although obviously the apps that use it may have a cost associated with them. Additionally, the free account includes 5 GB of cloud storage, so you may run into fees should you need to store more data off site than the free allotment. Yearly storage costs begin at $20 (USD) to add another 10 GB (so 15 total storage).\n\nA: *\n\n*True and False. iCloud only backs up such things as reminders, calendar events and such. AND it also backs up documents created in Pages, Keynote, and Numbers, as well as other programs that are designed to work with iCloud, which is especially useful when you would like to access them on your iOS device. It does not backup your entire Documents folder.\n\n*True.\n\n*True. iCloud comes with 5GB free. After that there you must buy more storage at their set price.\n\n\n(While talking about backups, you should checkout Backblaze. I've been signed up for about a year and have been really impressed with them - besides it's only $5 per month)\n", "Q: Where does the Messages beta pull my buddy picture/user icon from? I'm using the new Messages beta with my Gmail account and my iMessage account (which is linked to the same Gmail address). It's using a photo for my buddy picture that I've used before on various things, but I can't figure out why it's showing up here. It's not the picture associated with my Gmail account or my user account on this computer. I can't find the setting in Preferences where I can select a buddy picture, so it must be pulling it from somewhere in some account. \nSo: where does Messages get its user picture from?\n\nA: Gmail may be set to synchronise with your Address Book.  Go to your address book, and select the \"me\" card that you will previously have chosen as your own identify within Address Book.  Whatever picture is being used by your \"me\" card (or potentially by whatever card has a matching email address as the one your messages app is linked to) should be the one Messages uses.\n", "Q: Help identify what uses the CPU when the Activity Monitor list of all processes does not help Problem\nAfter rebooting, and with only Activity Monitor open, my MacBook Pro (10.6, i7) shows a very high idle % (98% or higher) but then shortly after drops down to 40% - 50%. \nIn the Activity Monitor list of all processes: \n\n\n*\n\n*nothing accounts for this drop.\n\n\nFive questions\nWhat is the reason for the drop in the idle percentage?  \nDoes OS X run something that is not listed as a process in Activity Monitor?  \nDoes it shut a CPU or two down?\nIs there a way to force it to give me the full attention of the CPU, even though I'm not using it? \nFor what's below, are there better ways to measure how much total system impact an app has, since the app cpu% doesn't show all the secondary activity an app causes a system to complete?\nBackground\nI'm trying to measure the performance of a particular app, and one of the metrics, since some of the app activity is performed inside the kernel in the form of system calls, is CPU idle %.  \nIf OS X runs stuff in the background I can't see, or turns CPUs off or slows them down, then it obviously impacts my measurements.\n\nA: Testing seems to show that the culprit is Intel's Turbo Boost technology, which disables processor cores on the fly without telling the OS.  Since they aren't running the CPU idle process, activity monitor doesn't account for them, and it appears that the machine is under 50% idle when the reality is that it's near 100% idle.\nAt the moment it doesn't appear as though this can be easily disabled or controlled under OS X: How can I disable CPU throttling and CPU disabling?\nTurbo boost is built into many Core i7 and i5 processors, and some of the latest Core i3 processors.  You will have to check your processor version against intel's list of Turbo Boost capable processors to find out if yours has it.  If you don't have sandy bridge, you probably don't have turbo boost.\n\nA: By default, the activity monitor shows only the processes running under your user account and not system tasks as well as tasks by other users of the machine.\n\nSelecting another view from the toolbar control should help in knowing what is taking CPU time on your mac. I highly recommend getting Xcode from the app store and using Instruments to do any advanced profiling and tuning. It's a far more capable tool for that job once you've noticed something amiss using Activity Monitor.\n", "Q: How do I search all hidden files that are in hidden folders using Terminal? I need to find some configs buried in some hidden folders and can't recall where they are to navigate to them directly Cmd+Shift+G.\nI did a sudo find -name Foo* (slow), but none of the returned files were in hidden folders.\nWhat is the easiest way to search all hidden files?\n\nA: Assuming that by “hidden file” you mean files whose name begins with a dot or that are located somewhere under a directory whose name begins with a dot, and not other forms of invisible files, the following command prints the names of all hidden files. It's slow as it goes over all the file names everywhere on your system.\nsudo find / -name '.*' \\( -type d -exec find {} \\; -prune -o -print \\)\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*-type d -exec find {} \\; -prune executes find on every directory (whose name matched .*), and skips descending into that directory because of the -prune.\n\n*-type d … -o -print causes all non-directories that match .* to be printed.\n\n\nIf you're looking for a file with a specific name or pattern:\nsudo find / -name 'Foo*' -path '*/.*'\n\nThe */.* pattern on the whole path forces matches to be under a hidden directory.\nYou may want to add -xdev after the / to avoid traversing special filesystems and removable disks.\n\nA: Try the locate command. You will have to sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist first and wait for the locate DB to be generated.\n\nA: EasyFind is an excellent alternative app to get the job done. It's free and easy.\nYou can search for text in files (even invisible ones). <= This may be an easier way to find your config files.\nYou can get it from the App Store\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/easyfind/id411673888?mt=12\nDisclaimer: I am not affiliated with the developer.\n\nA: mdfind seems to ignore a lot of hidden files. mdfind 'kMDItemFSInvisible==1&&kMDItemFSName==filename' does list .DS_Store files, but not for example .bash_history. I haven't found any way to search for files in some hidden directories like /private/etc/.\nAnyway, Find Any File is a lot faster than find.\n\n\nFind Any File is a program for Mac OS X that lets you search for files on your disks.\n\n*\n\n*Contrary to Spotlight, it does not use a database but instead uses the file system driver's fast search operations, where available. This lets you search for file properties such as name, dates, size, etc., but not for file content (use Spotlight or EasyFind for that).\n\n*Find Any File can find files that Spotlight doesn't, e.g. those inside bundles and packages and in inside folders that are usually excluded from Spotlight search.\n\n*Finally, it is quite fast. A search only takes a few seconds on an internal hard disk or SSD. Try for yourself!\n\n\n\nA: ag can search hidden files by file name. \nFor instance:\nag --hidden -g \".swiftlint.yml\" ~/\n\nHow to install\nbrew install the_silver_searcher\n\nhttps://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher\nrg is faster than ag.\nrg --files --hidden ~/ |rg  \".swiftlint.yml\"\n\nHow to install\nbrew install ripgrep\n\nhttps://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep\n\nA: If you want to search .DS_Store hidden files, this command works well. \ndu -a | grep .DS_Store\n\n", "Q: How can I disable CPU throttling and CPU disabling? On a 2011 17\" MacBook Pro (i7, 10.6, 16GB ram) I do not have any options in the energy saver preference panel to control CPU throttling.  I need to be able to disable CPU throttling for short periods of time - or at least force OS X to a certain state and stay there so that I can get consistent results from test to test in a performance comparison situation.\nAre there methods or apps that allow me to control the energy saver features and particularly CPU throttling and CPU disabling for recent (sandy bridge) Macs?\nCHUD does not appear to support this machine (it doesn't correctly report the CPU type) and while I can manually disable hyperthreading and processor cores using /Library/Application Support/HWPrefs/CPUPalette.app it doesn't give me the option to tell OS X not to throttle anything.\n\nA: This particular machine is a second generation Core i7, which includes Intel's Turbo Boost technology.\nThis is, essentially, a power management processor that has the ability to change the clock speed and disable/enable processor cores on the fly.  It requires no software intervention, the entire algorithm exists in silicon on the i7 processor itself.\nWhile utilities to control it are starting to appear for windows, Apple doesn't provide a method to disable it, nevermind control it, and I have not yet found any utilities that would allow me to disable or control it on OS X.\nSo, at this point, the answer is that you cannot disable CPU throttling or power control under OS X for Turbo Boost capable processors - it's all automated inside the processor, and Apple doesn't have a public API to control it.\n\nA: sudo pmset -a dps 0\n\nThis is supposed to disable or enable dynamic processor speed changes.\nAlso, there is a kernel ext you can remove off your system (copy to a thumb drive etc) that is responsible for this behavior I believe. It is IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext in the /library/extensions folder. Replace when you're done; you don't want to remove it permanantly.\n\nA: There are two apps I have found. Both require you to disable Macs kernel level protection.\nBut you should first also download intel Power gadget https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-power-gadget.html Because its cool.\n\n*\n\n*Turbo boost switcher.\nhttps://www.rugarciap.com/turbo-boost-switcher-for-os-x/\nworks for me.\n\n\n*Volta\nhttp://volta.garymathews.com/installation.html\nI found very buggy.

Network Settings reports a green light for Bluetooth PAN, but my browser can't connect to anything at all.\nMy Mac reports very similar IP addresses for both, starting with 172.20.10 and differing only in the last octet.\nAny idea why I can't successfully tether via bluetooth?\n\nA: This fixes what i presume to be a corrupt internet sharing preference file. It will also remove all other network settings such as wifi access-points and their passwords so keep that in mind. Other data such as pictures and contacts will be completely safe.\n\n\n*\n\n*On your iPhone, go to Settings -> General -> Reset and choose Reset Network Settings. \n\n*The iPhone will ask you to confirm and then restart.\n\n*In Settings -> Internet Sharing reenable it and choose to turn on bluetooth if a dialog asking to do so appears.\n\n*Reconnect to your wifi-network if applicable.\n\n*You're probably done, try connecting. If it doesn't work go on.\n\n*In Settings -> General -> Bluetooth tap the blue arrow beside your computer and choose to forget the device.\n\n*On your computer go to System Preferences -> Bluetooth and remove your iPhone from the list.\n\n*Go to System Preferences -> Network.

Magically it worked with nothing further required.\n\nA: A self-assigned IP may be another problem when using Bluetooth PAN with internet sharing.

I've created a calendar in iCal that I share with colleagues, who I have given permission to edit. Everything works fine except that I see no way to receive alerts or notifications when they make changes to events in the calendar. They all report that they were given the option to see alerts when they subscribed, but I (as creator of the calendar) was not given any (that I saw).\nIs there a way to configure a shared calendar so that the creator of the calendar can be notified when other users make changes?\n\nA: When viewing your calendars at iCloud.com, click the \"shared calendar info\" button next to the calendar of interest (Button is white for unshared calendars, green for shared). In the new window, check the \"email me when this calendar is changed\" box.\nNow, whenever someone else updates the calendar you will get an email with the change. \n\nA: If the idea of subscribing to your calendar seems odd or has other side-effects, you could always set up a second account to receive / process / forward the change notices.\nIt seems odd we have to resort to these workarounds since the machinery is there to be self notified or bcc when updates get sent from the server directly.

You'll need to use Photoshop or your preferred photo manipulator to split the image in half and apply the wallpaper to the individual displays in System Preferences. \n", "Q: What do the checkboxes that appear when editing the card for \"Me\" do? When I edit my address card in OS X (10.7) Address Book, checkboxes appear next to all of the entries. What are these checkboxes for?\n\n\nA: It's for selective sharing of details when exporting a contact card, as this Finer Things in Mac post suggests. It allows you to keep the unchecked items more private by omitting them from the sharing aspect of Address Book (soon to be Contacts) on OS X.\n\nLion’s Address Book allows you to select which details to share with others when exporting your contact card. As long as you have told Address Book which card is yours using the Card > Make This My Card option, editing your card will display a checkbox to the right of each detail you’ve entered. Deselect a checkbox, and that detail will be excluded when you drag your card out of Address Book or click the Share button at the bottom.\n\n", "Q: iTunes incorrently splitting the songs in an album. Metadata problem? I have these albums and songs in my iTunes Library. They should appear grouped, but for some reason, iTunes splits them up and shows them as separate albums with the same name and details:\n\nI check the metadata and everything seems to be in order. Here are screen shots of the first two songs:\n\n\nWhy is iTunes doing this? Thanks for your help!\n\nA: I've only ever seen this happen when the metadata absolutely differs in some way between tracks. There are two ideas that come to mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Highlight each individual character and make sure 3 dots ( ... ) haven't been transformed into a single character elipses ( … ). Highlight each of the dots above and you should understand the difference.\n\n*Check the 'Sorting' section too and make sure all of that data is identical, notably in the 'Grouping' fields.\n\nA: I would suggest selecting all four songs and doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete metadata from the tracks: at least Grouping, Album, Artist, Sort Album, and Sort Artist, but more wouldn't hurt.\n\n*Save the absence of the data by selecting \"Done.\"\n\n*While they continue to be selected, Get Info again and fill in the relevant information.\n\n\nI've found that no matter how much some fields may look identical, resetting them to be identical together often solves the problem.\n\nA: For all the tracks, selecting \"Part of a Compilation\" - \"Yes\" solved this one for me (though it was not part of a compilation, it was the only way I could get it to cooperate).\nThis works, due to the way iTunes organizes compilations.  The likely problem is that some of the files incorrectly have a compilation tag in the metadata and iTunes is looking for the same tag in the rest of the files and - not finding it - is placing the files in separate albums.  Use a metadata editor to open up the files and clear the tag from the offending files and re-add them to your iTunes library and it should be all grouped under one album.\nI tested this by adding a compilation tag to two files out of an album and importing to iTunes and did indeed get the files split into two separate albums.  Removing the tag fixed the problem and iTunes imported correctly.\n\nA: I've had the same problem before, even with identical info, artwork, etc. What helped me was that I right clicked one of the songs of the identical albums and clicked \"Create AAC Version.\" This created a double of that one song, and automatically grouped the two identical albums, and then I just deleted the AAC version. \n\nA: I could sometimes change the metadata as suggested by other answers, but for some albums, couldn't find any metadata differences, and any changes I made had no effect.\nWhat worked for me was the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate the folder Automatically Add to iTunes in the iTunes > iTunes Media folder. Keep it available in the Finder.\n\n*Go into iTunes and select the song which is split from the album\n\n*Right click on it and choose \"Show in Finder\". It should be in the same folder as the other songs. If not there probably is a difference in the album name. \n\n*Go back to iTunes\n\n*Select the song and press Delete. Answer Keep File in the popup. \n\n*Go back to the Finder and drag the song file into the Automatically Add to iTunes folder.\niTunes should put the song back into your library, this time with the other tracks from the album.\n\n", "Q: Advanced Mail Rule I want to write a rule like that does the following:\nact on\n    all messages from contacts that are in my address book\ndo\n    move it to the folder <known>\nexcept\n    if another rule matches\n\nOptimally I would like to provide a list of rules to match.

I didn't find any iPad app that's supporting samba.\nWhat is the best way to access Windows shares from an iPad?\n\nA: Because there is no normally-accessible local filesystem on an iOS device, an app that \"supports SMB\" doesn't tell us enough. Because you can't simply copy files from a SMB share onto the iOS device.\nThere are plenty of apps that support SMB shares, three I can think of off the top of my head (at least as far as I recall) are: Goodreader, OPlayer, and Air Sharing.\nAir Sharing is probably the most compatible for whatever you want to do, as it opens almost anything. Goodreader is primarily a document reader (txt, pdf, etc.), and OPlayer is a multi-format video player. It plays almost anything, MPEGs, AVIs, MKVs, etc.\nWhat you want to accomplish beyond merely 'connecting to a SMB Share' will dictate the app you'll be able to use.\n\nA: Additionally to the OPlayer app suggested by @Jason Salaz I've found several other apps that can connect to Windows smb shares: \n\n\n*\n\n*Cloud Connect Pro $14.99\n\n*FileBrowser $3.99\n\n*Files Connect $3.99\n\n*NetPortal $2.39\n\n*ezShare Pro $15.99\n\n\nUnfortunately I couldn't find any free apps. \n\nA: It's easy to hook up dropbox--not quite the same as you are asking but supported on pc/mac/iphone/ipad/android/linux/... and really does a great job of syncing your files together. \nI haven't seen any other apps that would allow you to accomplish the goal you are after, but you will find some that will let you stream media from a certain type of media share--but that's not what you asked.\n\nA: The files app on iOS and iPadOS can connect to network file servers directly so there’s no need for a third party app unless you want features they provide over Apple’s native SMB client solution.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206481\n(This wasn’t implemented when the question was asked, but it’s a great solution for now.)\n", "Q: Why doesn't my MacBook recognize my USB keyboard when it wakes from sleep? I have 13-inch, early 2008 MacBook running OS X 10.7.3, and recently, the trackpad started developing some problems, so I attached an external keyboard and mouse. \nIt works great, except that when the computer wakes up from sleep, about 50% of the time the keyboard is unresponsive until I unplug and replug the USB connection. Any idea why this would be?\nThe keyboard and mouse are attached directly to the computer, not going through any USB hub.\n\nA: I sometimes have this problem with my built-in keyboard (and trackpad).  It seems to be related to static electricity build-up (in me).  In dry environments prone to static generation (e.g., carpeted offices, fabric-covered chairs, etc.), I always try to ground myself on something (say, a filing cabinet or a metal wall) after I sit down but before I touch the mac.  If I forget and I zap the keyboard when I start to type, there's a very good chance that the keyboard and trackpad will be unresponsive. Based on my recovery action, I'm guessing that the macbook's internal USB controller has sensed the transient voltage spike as an over-current condition and has shut down (suspended) the offending devices on the associated port.\nTo recover the keyboard and trackpad, I either plug in an external keyboard (or vnc in via an ssh tunnel) and run the USB Prober app (part of the Developers tools, under /Developer/Applications/Utilities).  Inside Prober with the Bus Probe tab selected, I then check Probe suspended devices and hit the Refresh button; my built-in keyboard and trackpad immediately start working again. My assumption is that the probe causes the suspended devices to re-negotiate their bus membership --which, if I remember the USB protocol, means that they are essentially new devices and not subject to the previous suspension -- and lets things go back to normal.\nThis doesn't happen often enough for me to automate the recovery, but I'm guessing there are associated system events/messages that could be used to drive an applescript-controlled probe.\n\nA: Solve the problem – Your power cord must be connected to a socket with Earth (Protection Earth typical marked PE).   \nI have had this problem for a long time without solving the problem, besides unplugging a million times. But reading the thing about static electricity... rang a bell for me \"EARTH Connection\" I was only connected with 2 pin connector (Phase and Zero) I was running without protection Earth. I replaced my power cord with a 3-pin cable (Phase, Zero and PE) and connected that to a 3-pin socket. It worked right away. Why because PE eliminates static electricity besides being a protection against hazard electrical chock.\n\nA: I seem to have had the same problem (USB keyboard and mouse freeze OS X when being reconnected (MacBook Air)).\nI did see an error appearing in the OS utility USB Prober under the USB Logger tab (Level: '7 - Most Detail' and hit the 'Start' button).\nThe issue has vanished upon upgrading to OS X Mountain Lion (10.8.2).\n", "Q: Option to choose reply from address on mail.app in Lion My default position is to stay within the OS X ecosystem unless their is a compelling reason to use use a 3rd party product.

I'm hoping someone can answer this to save me doing the work just to find out - Can I choose which of my accounts to reply from or am I limited to the address it was sent to ?\n\nA: *\n\n*On the fly in the reply dialog:\n\n\n\n*Set default in the preferences:\n\n\nA: Once you configure multiple accounts, or even different aliases for the same account, you can reply to messages from any account/alias combination, even different from the one that recieved the mail.\n\nA: Yes, that's no problem, you can have multiple accounts, and you get to choose which is the default, as well as reply from a different account on a per-mail basis by choosing from a drop down.  You can even choose different SMTP servers from the same mail account, allowing you to (for example) route the same account through your own SMTP server as email address X, or choose to route it through GMails own SMTP server which allows you to transform your sender address in the Gmail Web App Settings.\n", "Q: Two finger left and right swipe on trackpad does not work under Lion On one user account on one of my family macbook air machines (all with the latest version of Lion) the two finger trackpad swipe left and right to switch back and forth (e.g. between pages in safari) does not work .

The best you could do is choose 'None' as the SMS Tone, and hide message previews.\nSince you unable to upgrade to iOS 5, you cannot change nor remove the SMS Message popup box. Under iOS 5 you could change it to the less intrusive banner, or remove any sort of on-screen notification at all.\n", "Q: How do I prevent iOS devices from being backed up in iTunes when plugging into a friend’s computer? Say you plug your iPhone or iPad into a friend’s computer. If iTunes is installed on this computer (which it will be on every Mac, for instance) it will automatically open and take a full backup snapshot of the device onto the computer.\nThe backup will be obfuscated but everything will still be totally accessible on that computer.\nHow do I prevent this from happening from the iOS device side? (As I do not control the computer in this scenario.)\n\nA: There are two viable options to prevent backing up to any computer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on iCloud backup and any iTunes will know not to make a duplicate back up and just get on with syncing.\n\n*Lock your device with a passcode so that no matter what the computer asks, the device won't enable a sync/backup session until the passcode has been entered.\n\n\nYou can also set a \"don't sync\" bit on a per iOS device, but that may not be respected by some computers and also won't help if the operator of the computer wants to try to save any information it can access. I'm fairly certain your photo roll is safe if you use the passcode option, but you might want to test that if you have any sensitive photos in the camera roll.\n\nA: You can't, it's controlled by iTunes.  You can ask the owner to turn off the \"automatically sync when iPod is connected\" setting, or you can watch for the sync starting and swipe to cancel, but those are your only real options.\n", "Q: How do I retrieve my photos/messages? I went to the apple store a few days ago because of a tech issue I had with my iphone 4s. They deleted everything and had me start with practically a new phone. When I plugged my phone into itunes today, it synced up with the last time I backed up and deleted all NEW photos I took since I went to the apple store and all new messages. Is there a way I can retrieve these messages and photos?\n\nA: There is no way, unless it was backed up somehow. If iCloud was enabled, and backed up recently, you will be able to restore it from an iCloud backup. Here is an article detailing the restore of an iCloud backup http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4859 .\nWhen you restore a phone, or start over, there will be three options on the initial wizard (iOS 5 only - which is on the 4S). The three options are Restore from iCloud backup, Restore from iTunes backup, as well as Setup as new iPhone. As a result, the only real restores you can do is iCloud (which is extremely easy), as well as iTunes (which is very similar, only you must connect to your computer). iCloud automatically backs up every night if (1) your phone is connected to wifi (2) your phone is locked and (3) your phone is locked, therefore it often can be more recent then iTunes.\n\nA: If the photos are deleted from your iPhone, try some data recovery program. Just google then you will get them. Some are free. \nBy the way, don't save any data file on your file before retrieving your photos back.\n", "Q: How to include iLife with a NetInstall Image of Lion? I've got a NetBoot server set up on Lion server that pushes several NetRestore and NetInstall images. \nWhile I have a NetRestore image that already has iLife '11 on it, I want to have a NetInstall image that has iLife '11 as well. That way, I can do a reinstall of the OS and iLife without having to erase data. \nI've found this article that says adding some iLife packages to the workflow with the \"Add Packages and Post Install Scripts\" automator action, but the guy who answered did this with iLife '09, wasn't completely sure, and used the NetRestore option. \nIs there a way to run iLife install scripts with a NetInstall image?\n\nA: A recipe for deploying iLife 11 using DeployStudio just rolled across my twitter stream, so almost all the credit here goes to Steve Yuroff for the recipe.\nIt is available on github and lists the package names and checksums for verifying the install.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/swy/iLife-11-InstaDMG-catalog/blob/master/iLife11.catalog\n", "Q: Hosting a remote Aperture image library on a Mac mini server We take a lot of pictures, and it would be very convenient for us if we were able to organize all of our pictures into one massive, remote \"Aperture image repository.\" So, I got this idea to get a Mac mini server which could host all of our pictures, and possibly set it up to \"replicate\" (in whole or in parts) to several Macs via our local area network.\nThe basic goal would be to set this up so that several Macs can \"connect to\" and work with one remote image repository, without needing to have the files locally on their local harddrives. And possibly download selected images when needed.\nI am familiar with programming and scripting for Mac OS X, so it is okay if the solution involves some light programming. I just wanted to check first if anyone here knows if this is something Mac OS X Server and Aperture can do \"out-of-the-box?\" Have any of you set up something like this, and if so, how is it working? Do you have any better suggestions on how to do this?\nOne other thing that I thought about was to set up a Git or Mercurial repository on the Mac mini server, and check all the pictures into that, and basically check stuff out on the separate machines locally when needed. This could work as well, but I'm afraid this solution might be a little bit \"overkill\" and add too much \"headachey.\"\nI don't own a Mac mini yet, so I can't play around with it to figure it out. The answers to this question will help me decide if we should buy a server or not. Oh, and I am aware of this question, which is similar, but I would like to know how well this would work with Aperture.\nThanks in advance!\nUpdate:\nI found this post on StackOverflow, talking about using Git as an image repo. Adding it here, for future reference.\n\nA: The approach we have used is a simple shared folder containing an Aperture library. I can report that this solution is ok but fragile -- permissions on the shared folder need to be fixed every so often. \nDropbox would certainly work in your case, but I suspect that you'll need substantial storage space, which would be rather expensive. If cost weren't critical, though, Dropbox offers a very reliable way of replicating an Aperture library file locally while keeping the copies synced smoothly. Your solution of a GIT repository may be a labor-intensive way of re-creating what Dropbox is already offering.\n\nA: Hello have you looked at:\ncocoaslideshow or gofoto\nYou should be able to do that, alternatively there are other ways to host your iamges in your own Mac Mini Server or any other server using a blog or a CMS such as WordPress or Joomla with a photo/image gallery module that can just point to your photo directory and load the directory straight into the browser. \nUsing such tools you can make certain folders public or private. Also you can just setup an FTP to load files directly to the site including direct from your phone or camera using eyefi card. \nIf you find this too general and would like a detailed solutions as to how you can implement this please feel free to email me the contact form on our website Hosting Mac Mini \nHappy to help\nRegards\nH.A\n\nA: This really depends on what your usage scenario is:\n\n*\n\n*If you want cost-effective and reliable storage shared across your LAN then the best option is to use a NAS with RAID. The users can either work remotely or locally and sync their work.\nA good NAS will also give you plenty of storage or expansion options and an HTTP/(s)FTP interface which you can map to your external IP to securely acces your content from remote locations.\n\n\n*If you also need an extra computer to work with the pictures or display/showcase them on a TV/monitor, a Mac mini might be a good investment. Again, you can share its storage in with other computers on your LAN and use tools such as rsync to keep specific folders synchronized.\n\n\n*If you want to keep track of changes to the images, it's a good ideea to use a repository of some kind. Bear in mind though that most tools have been optimised for text files versioning and will probably not be efficient to store changes to binaries (will keep full copies of each version) or inspect differences (see this).\n", "Q: How can I configure my keyboard to be backlit at the login screen? I recently had to reinstall Lion.  Now, when I boot the keyboard is not backlit when at the login screen.  It used to be backlit when at the login screen.  \nI'm using a Macbook Air 11\" July 2011 model.  In System Preferences I have the checkbox: Automatically illuminate keyboard in low light checked.  The setting for Turn off when computer is not used for: is set at Never.\n\nA: It appears that the problem is related to FileVault.  When I turned FileVault off and rebooted in safe mode the problem went away.  I could change the brightness of the screen and the keyboard at the login screen.  Volume controls worked too.  Now that I've turned FileVault back on the problem is back.\n\nA: Have you tried turning up the keyboard backlight brightness at the login screen, logging in and restarting to see if it will keep your setting? Typically, the setting for the backlit keyboard is stored in the PRAM. Once setting the brightness to your desired level, it should retain the setting after a restart providing you don't reset the PRAM. Give it a shot.\n", "Q: Mail app and templates for emails?

Firewire connections can be a little touchy. Since I use my MacBook to record audio - sometimes on location, hooked into an interface or Firewire mixing board - I'm often concerned that the cable will get jostled and disconnect in the middle of a critical operation. \nDoes anyone know of any method or device that will secure the cable to the Macbook's Firewire port more effectively? \nLow-tech solutions would be welcome. (For example, I use a thick rubber band to do the trick on my portable hard drive, running the cable back through the rubber band and holding it against the top of the drive.) However, I wouldn't be averse to purchasing a small gadget or connector of some sort. \n\nA: It is very low tech, but some tape is both cheap and effective at holding a cable securely when you start the tape around the cable and then have an inch or two of tape holding the cable securely along the bottom surface of the mac.\nChoose one with adhesive that cleans with alcohol and most cables and bottom cases are safe for cleaning any adhesive residue that may remain after your session.\nI have also seen people use velcro cable wraps with the hook portion affixed to the cable and a loop pad semi-permanently affixed to the bottom of their MacBook Pro. The loop isn't that disruptive in daily use and you only have the hook portion of the velcro on the cable so it can be tucked away when not in use. This is far superior to tape or rubber bands for a more heavy duty connection under repeated use cycles.\n\nA: I found that adhesive velcro eventually came adrift due to the heat. i have now come up with a fairly cranky solution which words as long as you intend to use your mac on a flat surface somewhat bigger than  the footprint of the MAC\nGet a strip of plastic that just fits under your mac. I guess any size will do but i just use a thin strip. Affix the loop side of sticky velcro onto it just to provide a bit of extra grip. This side will face down toward the surface you rest the mac on - you will not be using the hook side. Attach your firewire lead onto the plastic strip with sugru - or something similar. You need to build it up to the height of the firewire port but it needs to stay slim in order not to disrupt access to the ports either side. Here is the picture not pretty but it works\nas long as you don't need to keep moving you laptop about\n\nA: A very flexible FireWire cable will help. You may also want to try using a thunderbolt to FireWire adapter to provide more flex and then taping the FireWire cable into the thunderbolt adapter.\nTaping the cable to a table (and not moving the laptop) will also help.\nAs for the tape, try gaffer's tape. It is frequently used in the live event, broadcast, theater and entertainment industry to secure cables without leaving residue. It is cloth-based and easy to rip.\n", "Q: Can someone read production week from this serial? The serial looks like this\na13038xxxxxxxxxx\nI know that I have to look for 3rd digit for the year, and 4th and 5th for week of that year to get the week when my iphone was made. \nDo I count the first letter or not? Or I start form the first digit after the letter 'a'?\n\nA: The iPhone 3GS model number is A1303, so I'm guessing that if you're looking at your serial number, it's somewhere with the model number appended to the beginning. To see just your serial number, go to Settings > General > About.\nOnce you have your serial number, the 3rd character will be production year, the 4th and 5th characters will make up the production week.\nFor additional info, check out \"iPhone Serial Number Secret (Decode Color, Size, Production Year and Week)\" on My Digital Life.\n\nA: I'm not sure that is how a serial works as that is a 3GS Model number, but if you count it yourself...\nThe 3rd character is a 3 which suggests 2003 or 2013. As 2013 hasn't happened I would assume 2003, however no iPhones were made in 2003 \nThe 3rd number is a 0 (suggests 2000 or 2010) no iPhones were made in 2000. \nThat is why I strongly think that this idea of a production date being included in a serial doesn't exist in this form.\nThe other reason is that my iPhone 4S serial only has 3 numbers in it and is in this format A38BBCDEFGF2, this is totaly out of sync with all possibe formulas on iPhone serial number production dates.\nMy 3GS has 881270*** \nUnder this principle the phone would have been made in 2011, I got the phone in late 2010 - it was a refurb, so I doubt that is the case. \n", "Q: Where can I find the task manager in Mac OS X Lion?

Each time it happened I restarted the system but it happens again. I also got \"he's dead, Jim\" error many times on Chrome.\nIs there anyway to get rid of this issue?\n\nInstalled memory(RAM) : 4.00 GB (3.87 GB usable)\n\nA: According to this page, \"He's dead, Jim\" message appears \n\nif the operating system has terminated the tab’s process due to a lack of memory\n\nSo it seems to be a RAM problem.\nIf your Mac is still under warranty, take it to an Apple Store to get it look at.\n\nA: If it happens consistently, remove one of the sticks of RAM and use the computer normally, then use the other one alone and use the computer normally.  Usually you'll find that one stick is exhibiting the problem, and not both, if it's a hardware problem.  Replace the bad stick.\nMake sure you haven't disabled virtual memory.\nHave you installed any drivers, for instance for USB, display, or networking devices?  Try uninstalling them.\nIf it doesn't appear to be a RAM stick problem, or a driver issue, the next troubleshooting step is to backup your system, then reinstall OS X fresh.  Install only those applications you absolutely need, then use it for awhile.  If it continues to exhibit the problem, take it to apple for hardware problems.  If the problem goes away, then add your applications and data as you need it, keep track of what you're adding, and if the problem starts happening again then suspect the items you most recently added as the cause.\n\nA: \"He's dead, Jim\" error is usually thrown by Chrome when the system goes out of memory. The first things you should check are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is your RAM ok? Does the system see all RAM amount correctly? You could use Rember to test your memory for faults.\n\n*Did you recently install new software or updates which might be using a lot of memory?\n\n*Did you install any plugin/extension for Chrome which might be using an excessive amount of memory?\n\n*Did you change your using/browsing habits? Ie: how many windows/tabs are you opening and what's their content? Flash websites/games/movies might be eating a lot of your available memory.\n\n\nA: As others have said, this sounds like a memory problem. Why not try opening Activity Monitor (you can find it in /Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor.app) and checking which applications are the memory hogs to begin with. \nSet the dropdown list at the top of the window to \"All Processes\". You can then order the list of processes by the \"Real Mem\" column, or click the \"System Memory\" tab at the bottom of the window to see current memory status.

Is it possible to use Time Machine to back up to an external hard drive connected to a Mac on same wifi network?\n\nA: The answer by Ian C. is correct. However, one small (but important) detail has been overlooked (one that took me a good hour to figure out!).\nIf the drive is not showing up in Time Machine on your Source Machine (the machine you want to back up), do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open 'System Preferences' on the Target Machine (the machine that has the External Drive attached).\n\n*Click 'Sharing' then 'Options'.\n\n*Untick 'Share files and folders using SMB'\n\n*Make sure 'Share files and folders using AFP' is ticked.\n\n\nNow go back to your Source Machine and your External Drive should show up in the list of Time Machine Backup Disks! \n\nA: If the Mac is running OS X Server (In 10.7, not sure if this is available for 10.6) then you can turn on Time Machine Server, which does exactly what you need.  There's no need to run any of the other server tools if you don't want.  this is the only officially supported way to do this that I know of.\n\nA: I am running High Sierra on the source and target machines and ran into some difficulties with this process but then got it to work. I didn't bother with SMB vs. AFP as noted above (left them both turned on), but what I discoverd on the System Preferences, Sharing screen is that in addition to the Options button which has general choices about sharing SMB and AFP, you can two-finger click on the Shared Folder itself in the Shared Folders list and then choose Advanced Options from the context menu to get other options that apply to that particular share only. Specifically, there is a checkbox for 'Share as a Time Machine backup destination\" and a sub-choice to limit the size of backups. Once I set those parameters and went back to the source machine, the share was visible as a valid backup destination.\n\nA: Yes. I've been doing this since Snow Leopard. All my MacBook Pros in the house do their Time Machine backups to an external USB drive that's hanging off an iMac running the standard OS X install (i.e. not Server). At the time of writing the iMac has been upgraded to Lion as has one of the MacBook Pros.\nFirst, configure your target machine (the one with the USB drive attached):\n\n\n*\n\n*Format the drive as OS X Extended Journaled. Give it a useful name. I use 'Remote Backups'.\n\n*Go to System Preferences -> Sharing\n\n*Make sure File Sharing is turned on and has a check mark next to it\n\n*Under the 'Shared Folders' list click the + button and add your newly formatted USB drive to the list of shared folders\n\n*Select the drive in the list and under 'Users' make sure everyone shown has read/write access to the drive.\n\n\nNow you need to configure your source machine (the one you want to keep it's Time Machine volume on this drive):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder on the machine. Find your target machine and click on it. Mount the drive on this machine.\n\n*\n\n*If you're asked for a user name and password use the user name and password on your target machine that you used to login and setup the share. Make sure you save this user name and password to your keychain\n\n\n*Go to System Preferences -> Time Machine\n\n*Click Select Disk...\n\n*The list should include the mounted drive, select that. Pick your encryption options and hit the Use Backup Disk button\n\n\nYou're now all set up to use this remote drive as your Time Machine backup location. When Time Machine runs you'll see this drive appear as a mount on your system, and when it's done the mount will go away.\nIf you browse this drive from the target machine you'll see sparsebundle files, one for each machine that's doing a Time Machine backup to this drive, on the disk. These are the actual \"disks\" that Time Machine is using on each machine to keep the incrementals. If you click on one, it should mount and you should be able to browse it like normal.\nIf you have a complete disaster and need to do a fresh OS X install and recover from Time Machine you can point the recovery process at the remote drive and it will ask you to pick a sparsebundle from the drive to recover from. Or, and this is what I recommend, you can unattach the drive from your target and attach it via USB to your machine and do the restore over USB which is much faster.\nI can confirm that complete restores from Time Machine backups kept in this manner work well. I've had to do two of them in the past few years on machines that keep their backups this way and both went smashingly well. Browsing Time Machine history in the Time Machine viewer can be a bit laggy, but it does work.\n\nA: If your backups are really important and you need a much more stable system for doing backups either remotely, wirelessly, online or an external drive, then I describe the best way how to do this below.\nA hard drive used for Time Machine backups requires an HFS+ journaled partition which gets corrupted and unmountable very easily. Your signal getting cut off, a cable getting detached, the power going off, or your computer crashing during a backup is all it could take to have big problems. Often Disk Utility cannot repair the disk and you lose all your stored data. \nThis is why using Time Machine over wireless is risky (time capsules are expensive but do seem to be more reliable); be really sure that you have a good, reliable WiFi signal and set up your router to use a channel different than any other WiFi sources. (The free program WiFi Scanner is great for analyzing WiFi interference.)\nMy backup hard drive had a habit of mysteriously disconnecting without properly ejecting numerous times and I have lost files; most of my video, graphics, and photos which take up more storage then my laptop can hold.\nI do video editing and design and for my situation I need something more reliable and flexible. It's worth it to me to spend a little extra money on this software because losing data had cost me in more ways than one. Here is an excerpt from their website:\n\nThis is the most flexible and reliable online backup solution for OS X, compatible with most Internet servers: FTP, FTPS, SFTP, WebDAV. It even supports offline backups to external drives.\nxTwin  preserves Finder info, resource forks, ACLs, Privileges and comes with an elegant user interface and a powerful assistant. It also provides numerous high-end features like AES-256 encryption, efficient bz2 compression, powerful exclusion rules and scheduler, support for splitting large files during network transfers, network-error recovery, individual digital signature for backed up files, multi-cores machines optimization and more.\nIt has a powerful Backup Assistant to make it even easier to create or update backups. \n  xTwin is designed to be very reliable and  handles small or very large data sets (hundreds of gigabytes and dozens of thousands of files). It is made to be impervious to network errors or even interrupted backups. \n\nI use xTwin with an external USB teradrive. HFS+ Journaled formatting is so easy to corrupt and lose your data with but Time Machine requires it. So far the best solution I believe is to use xTwin with NFTS formatted drive. I learned that NFTS is much more stable and a lot easier to do data recovery with.  Disk Utility does not come standard with this format, but you can get  software such as Paragon which adds this option into disk utility. \nIt is much more important to me to have reliable backups than versions and the cool time machine way of accessing older files.\nI will stick with this until Apple proves they have made a more stable filing system for backups. \n\nA: I had the same issue with TM not recognizing/mounting a TM-formatted NAS volume.  After 2 days of reading forums and tinkering, my solution was a variation on the SMB - AFP issue.  As I have not seen my issue & solution explained elsewhere, I am posting it here.\nRunning 10.7.5 on a MBA.  Backup destination is a Synology DS214play, running DSM 5.0 with native TM-support.  \nWe also have Mac Mini's running 10.6 and the process for pointing TM to the Synology NAS was very straight-forward which ruled out a problem with the Synology NAS.  This was the major source of confusion.  The different OS versions seem to create a subtle, but crucial difference in how TM handles this.\nOn the MBA (10.7.5), mounting the drive through finder and setting it to always re-mount during start-up was straight-forward.  I paid attention to the SMB / AFP formats when setting everything up on the partition on the NAS.  When mounting the drive on the MBA, it recognizes and displays only the drive name (\"DiskStation\").  In the background, it was defaulting to an smb format despite me having specified the afp format on the destination drive.  \nSolution:  instead of selecting and mounting the drive with a mouse-click, manually enter the IP address of the destination with an afp-prefix.  TM then instantly recognized the destination volume.  Somewhere between 10.6 and 10.7.5 something was changed causing TM to default to adding an SMB-prefix to the destination volume.  Tricky because it is then hidden.  Hope this helps.\n\nA: It works even though Apple support told me it wouldn't.\nImportant step that I missed:\nOpen Finder on the machine to be backed up. Find your target machine and click on it. MOUNT the drive on this machine—i.e. make sure that the back up drive on is visible on your Finder sidebar as a separate entity (File Add to Sidebar).\nI also portioned my backup Mac with a 500G partition for the backup to ensure no corruption etc. on the backup Mac with other applications.\n\nA: Not possible that I know.\nOnly if connected to AEBS (Airport Extreme Base Station)\nor server as far as I know\nsee : https://help.apple.com/machelp/mac/10.7/help/index.html?lang=en#mh15139\nGreetZzz\n", "Q: How to play music from iPod in Macbook iTunes? I would like to play music from iPod in MacBook's iTunes with wireless (over Wi-Fi).\nPlease advice how to setup to get that function.\n\nA: That feature is only available on iOS 5 for the iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch. If you have one of these devices with iOS 5, connect your device via USB, open iTunes. After your device shows up, under the primary device tab (should default to it), towards the bottom, there will be a checkbox to \"Sync this i(Phone, Pad, or Pod) over Wi-Fi.\" Check the box, and you should be set.\nYou must be on the same Wi-Fi, and have your computer on with iTunes open for it to actually sync in the future.\n", "Q: how to revert default Mac Apache install to original I've had major issues with my default Apache install ever since I installed MAMP. I've uninstalled MAMP now but I'm still getting issues such as multiple Apache processes running, not stopping/starting/restarting, and the Web Sharing option not showing the correct state in System Preferences. I'm assuming MAMP has changed something within the default version of Apache, is there any way to easily replace the entire Apache install?\nThanks, Alex\n\nA: No easy way that I know of, but if the MAMP FAQ is correct, MAMP doesn't alter the default apache install in any way, so no guarantee it would help anyway.\nIf spurious apache processes is the problem, maybe look for any launchd jobs that MAMP has installed and not cleaned up (Lingon can help if you're not familiar with the command line)?\nIf all else fails of course, there's always the (annoying but effective) backup + clean OS X reinstall + migration assistant option, which might be a more effective use of a couple of hours of your life than fiddling about trying to fix it, if it's critical to get things working again...\nEDIT: You might also double-check the complete list of files that MAMP claims to touch, just to make sure none of them have been left lying around on your machine, or have been altered in any way. \n\nA: Has another Apache been installed? From a terminal (Applications-> Utilities-> Terminal.app) try:\n\nps ax | grep httpd\n\nYou should see something like the following if your local web sharing is enabled:\n\n25829   ??  Ss     0:00.04 /usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND -D WEBSHARING_ON\n25831   ??  S      0:00.00 /usr/sbin/httpd -D FOREGROUND -D WEBSHARING_ON\n\nThen try\n\nps ax | grep apache\n\nThis should return nothing if you are using the default install, but might if another server was installed.\nIf apache is running from anything other than /usr/sbin, then you may want to investigate your PATH environment variable in case it has been altered.\nYou could also try using the default httpd.conf file supplied by Apple (in case yours has been edited).\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup of the current one\n\nsudo cp /etc/apache2/httpd.conf /etc/apache2/httpd.conf.bak\n\n\n\n*Copy the 'original' httpd.conf file\n\nsudo cp /etc/apache2/original/httpd.conf /etc/apache2/httpd.conf\n\n\n\n*Restart the web server\n\nsudo apachectl restart\n\nOn a side note.. If you are or will be doing any long term web development, I would advise installing apache2, php, mysql, etc from MacPorts or Homebrew. There is a little bit of a learning curve, but it's easy when you get the hang of it and you will benefit over the long haul. Example port commands:\nSearch for applications to install\n\nport search apache2\n\nInstall apache2\n\nsudo port install apache2 (currently version 2.2.22)\n\nUninstall apache2\n\nsudo port uninstall apache2\n\nUpgrade..\n\nsudo port upgrade apache2\n\nAlso, MacPorts installs everything into the /opt/ directory (I think Homebrew does as well), so you can always just delete the entire directory if you do not want them anymore. Again, if you do not mind digging in the trenches a bit and can be patient while your computer compiles these apps from source code (this can be lengthy), it will be worth your while.\n", "Q: Is Apple ID the publisher name for apps or books created with iBooks Author? I'm about to sign into the Mac Apps store for the first time.\nI have an Apple ID -- my Apple ID is my email address.\nWhen I publish something in the Apps store, for Mac or for iPad or for iPhone, will my Apple ID appear as the publisher of the App?\n…This question relating to apps that I publish either through iBooks Author or without iBooks Author...\nI'd like the name of the publisher not to be my email.\nEg. Where it says \"More Apps by Name\" -- the name that appears there, is that name my Apple ID, or do I choose that name elsewhere?\nI can't see how names appear in the iBookstore yet because I haven't signed in yet.\nI want to figure this out before I sign in because signing in means linking my credit card to this account, and I don't know if I'll need to create another account instead of this one.\n\nA: No - when you actually sign up with iTunes connect to sell (or distribute for free) a podcast, music track, iBook, iOS app or Mac app - you enter into a much more formal relationship with Apple.\nThe forms are fairly self-explanatory and allow for you to specify the name of the business in a separate form that the name of the person filling out the form on behalf of the business. Of course, you can sell things in your own name and enter the same information in multiple places (which isn't what you are asking, but it's possible in general).\nAs with any contract, lawyers and accountants are advisable if you wish to know the costs and advantages of doing something personally versus as a business or corporation. That's far above our scope here, but in your case, iBooks Author will guide you through this sign up process. I have had 4 acquaintances sign up and all of them completed the initial sign up process in less than an hour. One decided to not use their personal account and is in the process of forming an LLC to sell books, but the others are intending to sell under their real names.\nAt worst, you will have signed up and wasted time and can just close your account and open another if you determine you didn't do it correctly or can't change some critical piece of information. I've seen plenty of app developers change their selling names and presume it was without signing up again, but once you sign up, you will have Apple to field questions on how to use their service and modify certain information you submitted if it needs to change.\n", "Q: Apps purchased on iPhone 'timing out' I buy quite a few apps on my iPhone, but as of late I am noticing a weird issue: any app that cost money, 'times out' after a few days use. 'Timed out' apps don't appear on my iTunes purchases history, and I am forced to buy them again(?) and re-download them before I can use them again. When the app 'times out', the icon remains, but the app immediately exits when pressing on the icon. It seems as though my iPhone may have lost the connection to the store somehow? Any ideas?\n\nA: It sounds like your iOS software is corrupted. I would back up your iPhone to iTunes or iCloud, follow these instructions to enter your phone into DFU mode, download the newest iOS version, and restore your iPhone with the newest iOS version. Contact iTunes support and get your purchase issues resolved. Let me know in comments if you have any questions!\n\nA: IMHO, the better you can do is to see this webpage:\niOS: Troubleshooting applications purchased from the App Store\nIf it can't help you, you can report an issue as described here:\nHow to report an issue with Your iTunes Store purchase\nWhenever I had a problem and I reported in this way, Apple has always been very responsive, always solving my issue.\n\nA: It does indeed sound like buggy Apps. Sometimes I notice newly installed Apps are more reliable after powering the iOS device off and on again. I may just be making that up, of course. I have no proof.\nIf your iOS needs reinstalling, I recommend iTunes: Backing up, updating, and restoring iOS software as an easy alternative to the sometimes finicky DFU route.\nIn addition, if you re-download an App you deleted (or otherwise went missing), you will not be charged again.

I am currently running iOS5 on all devices and have some of the third party apps.\n\nA: Since these apps are packaged as part of the Core iOS image, you will need to jailbreak the iPad OS to allow modification/installation of the apps currently shipped as part of the iPhone / iPod touch such as Calculator, Clock, etc...\nThe best technical description of /Applications on iOS is from The iPhone Wiki where it calls out the differentiation between iOS images and major release versions. I haven't ever used it, but the jailbreak package \"Belfry\" purports to do precisely what you ask and might make interesting reading as well in case you change your mind about jailbreaking in the future.\n\nA: On the new Apple stores, for iOS 7.0 and 8.0 I think, at the top there is an option to switch between \"iPad only\" apps and \"iPhone only\" apps.\n", "Q: Is it possible to copy Firefox bookmarks with iOS Safari?

I can easily shut down the process from activity monitor but is there a way to prevent this? Thanks in advance for any suggestions. Test is the file the loop went into. I created it to show an example.\n\nA: MacVim forks (spawns a new process) to launch external processes, but it waits for the external process to return before resuming execution. Thus, killing MacVim simply detaches the child process (your program) from MacVim and attaches it to the main process running, in essence, OS X on the whole.\nYou have to quit, or Force Quit, your program explicitly in order to kill it.\nIt's also very likely that if you kill your program, and NOT MacVim, you can continue using MacVim without issue.\n", "Q: Failed to install ghostscript, during Imagemagick installation I'm kinda new to those CLI installations so I don't know exactly what I'm doing I'm just following the installation steps of the guide:\nI want to install Imagemagick on my Mac 10.5.8:\nI typed ´sudo port install imagemagick´ and I got this error in return:\nlocalhost:~ giorgio$ sudo port install imagemagick\n--->  Computing dependencies for imagemagick\n--->  Dependencies to be installed: ghostscript liblzma urw-fonts webp\n--->  Building ghostscript\nError: Target org.macports.build returned: shell command failed (see log for details)\nError: Failed to install ghostscript\nLog for ghostscript is at: /opt/local/var/macports/logs/_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_release_tarballs_ports_print_ghostscript/ghostscript/main.log\nError: The following dependencies were not installed: ghostscript liblzma urw-fonts webp\nError: Status 1 encountered during processing.\nTo report a bug, see <http://guide.macports.org/#project.tickets>\n\nI've also tried to look inside the main.log file, but I couldn't understand anything with my knowledges! \nI've pasted it here with the hope that you can help me:\nhttp://pastebin.com/YeAGJQkF\nThanks in advance!\nGiorgio\n\nA: \n:debug:main Privilege de-escalation not attempted as not running as root.\n\nIt seems from the error log that you aren't running as root even though you used sudo.

To my surprise, the terminal reported that valgrind couldn't be found. Additionally, there seems to be no man page for valgrind either.\nI am certain I used to have valgrind on this computer, but haven't used it in a while so I can't say when it disappeared. Could this have something to do with my having updated to OS X Lion? Anyone know?\n\nA: I'd start with a spotlight search from terminal mdfind valgrind as well as checking your path variable to rule out some simple errors before digging deeper. You will want to ensure you have Release 3.7.0 of valgrind as it's the first that states compatibility with Lion in the release notes.\n\nA: It is possible that the Lion installation process could have modified your PATH settings to not include the location for valgrind. I would do a search with the locate command or similar and see if its sill installed on you mac, somewhere. If you find it on your mac, then you should add valgrind back on to your path . Also it might not be a bad idea to look for an update to it to better support the Lion upgrade. Worst case you will need to re-download and install valgrind.\n", "Q: Applist upgrade available on Cydia? Can someone tell me what this is ?? Can I remove it ?\nIt says : Allows developers to query the list of installed apps and provide a preference pane based on that information\nupdate This is given in the the app's info.\nApplist\n1.4.2\nAuthor Ran Petrich\nAllows developers to query the list of installed apps and\nprovide a preference pane based on that information\nExports depslayidentifier, displayname, icone and smallicon\nvia a remote messaging center that its easy to write a prefs pane \nthat presents a list of apps.\n\nI have a feeling it has something to do with Activator, and maybe removing this will delete Activator as a whole.\nI don want developers scooping around my installed apps...But  what happens if I remove it ?\nedit\nHaven't found anything about it yet .. Can anyone help me ?\n\nA: Applist is a small code library that allows jailbreak app developers to get limited information about the apps that you have installed. Ryan Petrich is a reputable developer, and many popular jailbreak apps use this library. To name a couple, Activator and SBSettings use it. All jailbreak apps have access to everything on your device, so if you're worried about privacy, I'd suggest restoring your device to factory settings. Applist is a dependency to these apps, so if you uninstall it, it'll uninstall them, too. Applist is harmless, so just keep it.\n", "Q: Changing home network on SIM card I have an iPhone 4S from Verizon, which they've \"unlocked\" for international use. I say \"unlocked\" in quotes because it's still restricted from US SIM cards. I'm able to use any international SIM, but I can't use a SIM from AT&T, T-Mobile or AirFire.\nI'm guessing this restriction involves checking if the Mobile Country Code is from the United States (310-316, I think). Since AT&T's MCC-MNC is 310-410, it's obvious the phone shouldn't be happy with it. However, with a SIM from GiffGaff (a virtual carrier on o2's network), I'm able to use AT&T in the US because their MCC-MNC is on the list, but not in the home position.\nArmed with this information, I'm guessing I can take an AT&T SIM card, bump all the MCC-MNC's on the list down a position, and add a UK carrier in the 'home' position? That way my phone will look for the UK carrier and believe that it's a UK carrier's SIM, not find it and then move down the list to the roaming networks?\nIf anyone has any information on if this will work, or can point me in the right directions for the tools to try this, please let me know!\n\nA: Afaik Verizon can only unlock the phone completely and not block certain carriers.\nUntil the iPhone 5, there was no model that supports CDMA and GSM.\nThe reason your phone doesn't work on an AT&T network (or most international networks for that matter) is because AT&T doesn't run a CDMA network.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht3939\n\nA: I don't think that you would (and should) be able to do that. AFAIK the SIM cards store data on an EPROM, which means you cannot rewrite it. Furthermore, this data is most often encrypted.\nWhat you could (theoretically) do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a SIM card reader and download SIM data from your AT&T SIM card.\n\n*Decrypt SIM data.\n\n*Alter SIM data and fix CRCs.\n\n*Encrypt new SIM data.\n\n*Write new data to an empty SIM card.\n\n\nI have strong doubts about how legal steps 2 and 4 are and even stronger doubts you can complete these and step 4 successfully with publicly available information.\nThat said, searching for rewrite sim card and having a look at this Hack-A-Day project might help you on this quest.\n\nA: I once tried to change the MCC and MNC codes to my country, my iPhone is AT & T and tried changing the codes to the network (Claro) in Dominican Republic available since I jailbreak my iPhone with iOS 7.0.4 but only it worse, so I rebooted and immediately submitted to the welcome screen, and when trying to activate the SIM card aT & T did not work, did not work with the contract that I have in my country, so I restored\n\nA: I don't think Verizon is to blame for this. This is a technical issue. The Verizon iPhone 4 uses Qualcomm MDM6600 chip capable of doing CDMA and GSM; however, Apple failed to provide support for GSM, so from the hardware point of view alone it is useless for GSM.\nVerizon iPhones only work in select European countries. See the list here.\n", "Q: How can I modify a package from the Mac App Store? I used to hack at apps on my Mac all the time (change the icons/sounds etc... in the resources folder of the package). I have tried with apps downloaded from the App Store, but it no longer seems to be possible. In fact, even creating one empty file will stop the app from launching. I assume that Apple are doing some kind of one way hash of the application folder, and checking if it has changed.\nIs it possible to either bypass the code-signing check or be more sophisticated about modifying apps that are signed and downloaded from the Apple Mac App Store?\n\nA: It depends upon the app. For example, I've been able to replace the icon of djay (bought it in the MAS) with the one from Cyberduck, and djay launches just fine (except it's got a rubber duck as its icon now :-))\nIf the developer does an integrity check at start time, you're out of luck.\n", "Q: how to delete files from iTunes without Time Machine deleting from external hard drive If I delete files from iTunes, does Time Machine automatically delete them when I plug in my external hard drive? And if so, how do I change this?\n\nA: No - when you delete a file on your mac Time Machine explicitly keeps all copies of that file that have been backed up previously.\n\nThe only caution is now you have all those copies on one drive (presumably) and it is one mistake / error away from being lost. \nAlso, if when your backup drive fills, Time Machine will start deleting from the oldest backup to make room for the estimated space needed for the current backup. Normally you won't lose all backups and all copies, but it is possible even if you have the \"warn me after deleting backups\" selected. In cases where new drives are added or there is an error / corruption to a file system causing a lot of data to get newly backed up, I have seen all but the most recent backup get deleted before you, the user is notified of the deletion.\n\nYou can prevent this one copy deletion by periodically cloning your backup volume or otherwise archiving a copy of your machine separately than the normal Time Machine process to ensure you always have more than one backup copy of a file that you have now deleted on your main iTunes library.\n\nA: Time Machine provides a backup of files currently on your system, plus an archive going back as far as drive space allows.\nYou can remove items from your iTunes library but not delete the files from your hard drive, in which case Time Machine will continue to treat them as \"current\" files.\nIf you're trying to remove the files to clear up space on your main hard disk, you'll want to transfer the files onto another external drive. A backup drive is not an external data store. You'll also want to be sure that the new external drive is somehow backed up. An external data store is not a backup.\n", "Q: Why does OS X format MS-DOS filesystems so much faster than Windows does? When I format a MS-DOS filesystem using Disk Utility in Mac OS X it takes only a few seconds, but when I format a FAT32 filesystem in Windows it takes several minutes.\nWhat is OS X doing differently?\n\nA: The format process can be handled differently depending on what the OS actually accomplish by during the format.\nFormatting should leave a clean and cleared file system. This can be done very fast by only clearing the file allocation table (FAT). This means writing to a very limited blocks /sectors on the disk.\nAlternatively formatting may include clearing all the data previously on the disk/drive. This obviously involves writing to ALL of the disk and is a lot more time consuming.\nWindows have the \"fast\" option and Mac OS X also has the \"slow\" option - OS X even has options to multi-wipe data with random garbage data (this usually takes forever).\n", "Q: OS X right click/context menu via keyboard Is it possible to access the right click/context menu of the currently selected item (not the item under the mouse) by way of using a keyboard shortcut?\nIf not, is there any way to achieve this, either by Applescript or utility?\n\nA: There is no way in general on the Mac to determine the screen coordinates of the current insertion point.  So there is no way to automate a click at the current insertion point.\nIn some apps, there might be a way to get the coordinates via AppleScript, or it might be possible to get them using some sort of private API or other system hackery, but there is no general solution to this problem that is supported by Apple APIs.\nIt is, apparently, quite a common UI gesture on Windows, but it is not something you can do on the Mac.\n\nA: I was also looking for this kind of feature and found a good alternative. \nMost context menu items in OS X can also be found in the top menu bar, and you can access this with a keyboard shortcut. By default it's set to ctrl+F2, however this often doesn't work. You can change the binding on the Keyboard preference pane.\nThis this post has more details http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-57591609-263/access-menus-via-the-keyboard-in-os-x/\n\nA: For files in the Finder, you can reach an \"Actions\" menu (not the built-in context menu) with Alfred's File Actions feature.\nThis is only in the paid version of the application, but I have it because of this and other functionality that really makes it worth it.  For instance, one of the actions you can choose is \"Email to...\" and then start typing and choose a name read directly from your Contacts, press enter, and the \"compose email\" window is opened up with the recipient and subject filled in and the file attached.\nWith these and other features, it's not the same as the context menu, but I've never needed to access a file's context menu since I installed Alfred, so I think it accomplishes the purpose of this question, at least for the Finder.\n\nA: The context menu can primarily be opened by a right mouse click (or a control click) only. \nHowever, if you want to right click on a specific area on the screen without using the mouse, you may use Mouse Keys from Universal Access settings in System Preferences. With it, you can control the mouse by using the keyboard number pad. When activated, a right mouse click then can be achieved by Ctrl+5 on a keyboard with a numpad or Fn+Ctrl+i on a laptop. This will allow you to 'right-click' your word.\nGo to System Preferences --> Universal Access --> Mouse --> Enable Mouse Keys (ON)\n\nFound on: https://stackoverflow.com/a/11238186/1919382\n\nA: One could probably write an Applescript that moved the mouse over the selected item and do a right-click. Other than that, no, I don't believe there is a way.\n\nA: The latest version of BetterTouchTool has an action you can trigger: \"Open Current Finder Selection with Specific App,\" and another one: \"Open Active/Selected Folder with Specific App.\"\nThis handles all my use cases for right clicks in Finder, personally.  I use ⌥' to open the active/selected folder in the Terminal, and a gesture (two finger swipe up from bottom of trackpad) to open the current Finder selection in Adobe Bridge.  Works perfectly.\n\nA: It's far from appealing, and there really is no concrete way of doing this, but if your left with no other options this can work quite well (in macros that is).\nHold Cmd+F5 (turns voiceover on)\nPress Tab\nPress Space\nPress Esc\nPress Cmd+Ctrl+Alt+Space\nSelect menu item \"Show menu\"\nHold Cmd+F5 (turns voiceover off)\n\nIt's a really really messy system, and it doesn't work consistently. But sometimes it is the only option which works well enough to be useful...\n\nA: I was actually looking for this shortcut to do quick grammar checking on a selected word in gmail. Usually, painted the word (option+shift+left arrow) and then right click to see the options (and I hate using mouse).\nFor this particular case, there's Chrome shortcut, which is [cmd + shift ; — or — cmd :] to display grammar check. Then you can cycle through suggestions using arrow keys.\nThat did the work for me for that specific issue.\nHope it helps.\n", "Q: Lion OS X Installer Does not recognize any HD What would be the reason if Lion OS X installer does not show any HFS+ partitioned hard drive on the installation step, \"Select a destination volume where \nyou want to install the Mac OS X software\". The Disk Utility cannot see it either! \nI am sure the hard drive is working fine C: Ubuntu NTFS and D: Windows 7 NTFS I can run windows or ubuntu fine.\nThe problem is not partitioning the HD, the HD does not appear at all hence the disk utility cannot perform any operation on HD. \nThanks \nLooking forward to hearing from you...\n\nA: Have you configured the disks to use a GUID partition table?\nThis was not required prior to Lion, but is in order to install Lion.\n\nA: Did you create the HFS+ partition yourself?  If you have a disk that already has other partitions on it, you may need to start Disk Utility from the installer and create the partition manually before installing.\n\nA: If it can't see your hard drive, then you have a hardware problem. The data on the drive (the partition structure itself is data!) is completely irrelevant.\nDisk Utility is capable of partitioning any drive so long as it can see the hardware, though it may need to erase it first. It sounds like the hardware itself isn't being detected.\nWhat hardware are you running? Is it under warranty? Make sure all the cables are plugged in properly, any jumper settings are correct, etc. Perhaps try plugging a different drive in or the same drive into a different mac.\n", "Q: Lion: Arrange Bug?

They are shown just as folders. I cannot select them or move them. \nDoes anyone else have this bug? What can I do about this?\nThe bug persists, even after I did a clean install.\n\nA: I too have seen this bug.\nThis is an issue with Finder's styling of headers in column view (and maybe other views).\nThe list interface headers are not \"interactive\" per-say (meaning selectable and movable), however there is a bug with Finder's styling of the headers for arrange/sort by kind which when rendered incorrectly, makes the headers appear as a regular named folder in the list of files.\nClosing all Finder windows and reopening them is not a proper solution, however it does reset the Finder \"styling engine\" (for lack of time to term it properly) so that it shows the header as a list interface header, and not a folder in the list of files and folder in column view.\nI cannot reproduce the problem consistently, however, I often notice it when I have multiple finder windows open, and may even go so far as to tie in the blame with network folder listings in Finder.\nI can't verify this but that's my environment a lot of the time.\n", "Q: Create Lion DVD from Lion USB flash drive Is it possible to convert a lion Dvd from a Lion flash drive?

Why do emoji like  appear when I use Safari, but not Chrome on the same MacBook running Lion? Both browsers use WebKit, and I'd imagine font support comes from the OS, not the application.\nFor reference purposes this is the page rendered in Chrome 17.0.963.56:\n\nAnd this is the page rendered in Safari 5.1.3 (7534.53.10):\n\n\nA: The difference is the rendering engines for the browser windows.\nWe know Safari renders the character set differently than Chrome. But the Window UI elements (the tabs in Chrome) are okay. That's our biggest clue.\nThe window UI elements are likely (emphasis on likely, I may not be correct here) all being rendered by the OS. So they get the full OS-level emoji-expansion treatment.\nBut what happens inside a web browser window is all very browser dependent. The rendering engines are a big part of each browser's secret sauce.\nBoth Safari and Chrome use WebKit, but the similarities between the WebKit instances they use stop somewhere around the name of the engine. They're both forks from the main version and they're both heavily customized to improve the performance in ways that each browser development team thinks is meaningful for their end users.\n@JasonSalaz found a great bug in the Chrome bug database that gives us the final clue that it's down to WebKit forks: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=90177 -- that bug is talking about the differences between the fork in Chrome and the mainline of WebKit from the open source project. There are rendering differences in the mainline that have yet to make it in to the version Chrome is using. And it looks like they intend to merge the changes in at some point.\nUpdate: Paul Irish has a great blog post on how WebKit differs for all these browsers that currently use it. If you really want to understand just how diverse the WebKit environment is, this is a great read.\n\nA: The problem is that your browser is using a different character encoding from that of the document you're viewing.  \nSo how does the browser know which character encoding to use?\n\n\n*\n\n*It can be specified in HTTP using the Content-Type header.\n\n*It can be specified for the HTML document using the meta element.\n\n*It can be specified for a specific HTML element using the charset attribute.\n\n\nIf none of these are specified, then different browsers use different techniques to guess at the right character encoding.  Some use heuristics.  Some allow the user to specify a character encoding.  Some select the default character encoding of the operating system.\nIf none of these pan out, you get the gibberish, also known as mojibake.\nSo to answer your question directly:  Safari and Chrome are trying different things to find the right character encoding.\n\nA: You can use the Chrome extension Chromoji. It's a workaround that will replace emoji with embedded images in web pages.\n\nA: Go to the Chrome menu bar, click on \"More Tools\" → \"Encoding\" and choose a new encoding format. I am using \"Unicode UTF-8\", it seems to work for me.\n\nA: The symbol is a character made by Apple. Safari uses its own character set. \n\nA: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=62435 was marked fixed recently; starting in version 41 emoji should display fine in Chrome.\n", "Q: Unaccessible folder in Trash Whenever I try emptying my Trash, the progress bar freezes at a specific point. \nI narrowed down the problem to a folder containing a mercurial repository:\nlocalhost:~ dennis$ cd .Trash/Mercurial.1/xardias_cfg/.hg/store/\nlocalhost:store dennis$ ls -la\n\nThe last command does not do anything. It just blocks and does not return to the shell. \nRemoving the folder has the same problem.

Is there a special way that i need to do it?\n\nA: You can only install iOS 5 on the 32/64GB versions of the 3rd Generation iPod Touch. The other versions are technically 2nd Generation and so iOS 5 causes seriously problems when someone tries to install it on one of those.\n\nA: It is, at least in theory, possible.

The sidebar is far less frequently accessed. Over the past week, entire folders are disappearing from bookmarks bar, taking countless sites that I use. I updated Safari recently to 5.1.2, and security update. I am running OS X 10.6.8. I booted from an external drive with SuperDuper, backed up a few days ago, but it was missing the folders.  These bookmark folders have been stable for years (as a system).   \n\nA: Do you have iCloud turn-on for your bookmarks? I did and found horrendous anomalies with my bookmark folders between my iMac, MacBook Pro, iPhone, and iPad. I could not get the issue solved and so far no solutions for it.

Is there any software like \"Clipper\" for Mac?\nI am looking for an application like this.\n\nA: I think you will find something like what you are looking for here 9 Crafty Clipboard Utilities for Mac.

In Windows, one can create a new file using Right Click -> Add New -> Type of File. Is there an analogous action in Lion?\nI just want to create a new blank file on my Desktop.\n\nA: A simple drag-and-drop solution works for me.\nCreate a folder called \"New documents\". In this folder, save a blank document of each type you want. In my case, I have a blank TextEdit document (.rtf) and a blank TextMate document (.txt).\nLock this folder (select, cmd-I, click 'Locked').\nPut the folder in the Dock.\nNow, whenever you want a new document, you simply drag it from this Dock folder to wherever you want it. Because the \"New documents\" folder is locked, the original won't be deleted; rather, the Mac will make a copy for you.\n\nA: To-Do's\nIf you just want to create a To-Do list, you might look at third-party solutions like:\n\n\n*\n\n*NotesTab (free) which 'rests' in the menubar and has a beautiful GUI.\n\n*Wunderlist (free) which provides sync between OSX, Win, iOS and Android\nHowever, if you want to use a feature provided by OSX, try Stickies.

Doing so brings up a semi-opaque bezel (much like the built-in Application Switcher) containing document icons from which you can choose to create new documents. By default, a plain text, rich text and HTML file are available, but you can add your own document types simply by dragging a document into the Document Palette application list window.\n\n\nA: You can also use the Evernote, http://www.evernote.com/, to manage your To-Do list, which can also be synced between devices.\n\nA: (I just re-read the question and am uncertain whether this post applies. My answer below is a solution for simple To-Do creation. If this question is really about creating a blank text file, though, my solution doesn't apply. Perhaps the original question could be clarified?)\nI use LaunchBar, in conjunction with Wunderlist and a little Applescript. This is a fluid action for me now: Cmd-Space, then \"AW\", Space, and my To-Do text.\nFor those not familiar with LaunchBar, Cmd-Space brings up LaunchBar itself, \"AW\" is a shortcut to my \"Add to Wunderlist\" script, \"Space\" brings up a text field, and the contents of that field go to my Wunderlist task list.\nThe Applescript is really simple, it just takes a string and emails it to Wunderlist.

Sometimes it is under 'Services' menu item.\n\nA: I am using XtraFinder plugin for Mac OS's built in Finder. It has most of the features including create new file in finder options.\n\nA: Provided that you have a terminal open:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type cd (with a trailing space)\n\n*Do you see the blue folder icon in the Finder title bar? It is draggable - so drag that folder icon into the terminal window after the cd and press enter to switch to that folder.\n\n*Type echo some very important note > mynewfile.txt\nThe echo command achieves two tasks: creating a file and adding text to it. \nTo add some more text to an existing file use echo more text >> mynewfile.txt. \nWarning: if you do echo some text > existingfile.txt on an existing file the original contents will be lost! Therefore it is safest to always use >> (append) instead of >, because >> will create the file if it does not exist.\nTo paste multiline text from the clipboard to a new file:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Terminal type cat > newfile.txt.\n\n*Paste the text.\n\n*Press Control+d.\n\n\nNote: the icon in the title bar of most apps, including text editors, and apps like Pages, TextEdit, Preview, etc is draggable which means it can be dragged into the Terminal, into any app with editable content, into form fields on web pages, into chat windows of your favorite messenger or address bars in web browsers. Also if you select the URL in the browser address bar (e.g. ⌘+L) you can then drag and drop it into any editable field. And if you drag the icon right to the left of the address bar into a rich text field (i.e. Pages or Notes) you will get a nice link with the page title.\n\nA: There is an affordable App store app \"New File Here\": https://itunes.apple.com/ch/app/new-file-here/id777221999?mt=12\nIt works nicely, and also has built in templates, which could come in handy.\nWhat I'm missing: You have to point on a folder (not in the empty space in the finder), keyboard shortcut.\n\nA: This really annoyed me and I could not find a viable solution anywhere.\nNothing worked for me so I created my own solution.\nWhat I wanted it to do.\n1: Command + n to create a new file ( with any extension eg. file.php .htaccess info.json etc... )\n2: The active finder window should be the location for the file to be created. ( Even Desktop. Most solutions fail to create files on desktop. )\n3: The input text prompt should be active after pressing the hotkey. (The normal method to prompt with workflows does not focus to the input text causing you to have to go to your mouse to click on the input field and focus on the text every time you create a new file.)\n( How it works: The workflow finds the active finder instance and runs a shell task to simply touch the filename relative to the current path. Thus files that already exist will not be modified or overwritten. )\nhttps://github.com/SplicePHP/workflows\n(Currently only has New File in there and will add some more workflows later.)\nDownload and install Keyboard Maestro or something like it.\nCreate a group called Finder Macros and only have these items triggered if finder is active.\nNow create a new hotkey for command + n and point it to the NewFile.workflows file downloaded from my repo.\nThat's it. Enjoy never thinking about this issue again.\n\nA: I'm using an app called Easy New File Creator\nYou can download and install it for free. (no need to buy full version)\nThis is how its preferences look like:\n\nAfter configuring it's preferences, customize the finder by selecting its extension at System Preferences > Extensions > Finder and select box besides Easy New File Creator Extension which looks like this\n\nNow when you right click (or control+click) you'll get options like this. \n\nBy selecting on New File Here, you can create a new file there itself.\nWhile creating new file name the file according to your requirement.\n(If you want to create a python file, name it Untitled.py)\n", "Q: 1440x900 no longer available on my external display after \"MLB for NVIDIA\" fix My early 2008 Macbook Pro was recently fixed for the known \"MLB for NVIDIA\" issue.

It jumps to the URL bar of the browser.\nHow can I troubleshoot this problem?\n\nA: Several postings on the Chromium issue tracker, such as this one and this one, suggest that this is because some plugins (such as Flash) are consuming the keystrokes whilst running. Does this happen whilst Flash is running, or can you pinpoint an occasion when it always happens if a certain plugin is loaded?\n\nA: Using something like fastscripts, override the shortcut of your liking.\nAn app like fastscripts listens globally (overrides both flash and chrome) but will act locally.

I have a project on Xcode and I am pretty beginner so I started designing my code of course using segues and now I realized that this project will only work on IOS 5!\nI guess I will give up before I even started! What am I gonna do now? Is there anything I can transform my project to IOS 4? I am so disappointed and wish I didn't have to design for IOS.\n\nA: Actually the concept of segues was introduced first in iOS5, however it is also stated in the library documentation.\nNevertheless, you can try to create standalone nib files and copy your UI*ViewControls from the storyboard into the nib file(s). Of course you are still not allowed to use segues but you can easily reintroduce IBActions to handle transitions between the views. It's still some effort to migrate, but not an impossible mission.\nIn order to avoid such a situation, I would suggest you to make a short requirement analysis (functional as well as non functional) before coding.\n", "Q: Create a new port for Macports I hate to wait for Macports to update the packages that I need. I would like to learn how to create a new port and submit it to Macports server. How do I do that?\n\nA: An easier way probably does not exists \"they would have it listed on the site if there was a fast track\" you are going to have to read and understand many of the things listed under MacPorts Development. It is a complicated system, you have to take the time to understand how it works, and what the rules and guidelines are for using and working with it. \nI am not currently a MacPorts developer but you could try asking / searching the archives for your question on MacPorts Mailing list, but I suspect if you do ask this question they are going to tell you the same thing I just did above.

The basic steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new partition using Disk Utility.\n\n*Install the new OS on the new partition.\n\n*Set default boot partition using Startup Disks.\n\n*Manually select boot partition at startup holding down the ⌥ key.\n\n", "Q: In a Service, how to get a URL from rich text? I'm interested in making a Service (using Automator if possible) that allows me to perform an action on a URL.\nIf the URL exists as plain text, this works just fine.\nHowever, if the URL is a link in rich text, then my service gets the link's title, rather than it's URL.\nHow can I obtain the URL when activating a Service on a rich text link?\n\nA: You can do it using the app TextSoap.

The album is there, but I cannot select it after tapping on the \"Add to\" button.\nThe album I am trying to copy the photo is an iPhoto album synced to the phone.   Can this be the reason of the problem?\n\nA: Asked and answered. The iOS 5 Photo app allows you add photos from the camera roll to the albums you create on the device, but not to albums created on the Mac using iPhoto or Aperture.\nWhen those photos are downloaded to the computer (manually or by Photostream) you can remove them from the device, which removes them from the device-created album, and add them to the appropriate album in iPhoto. They'll be added to the iPhoto album on the device the next time the device is synced with iTunes.\n", "Q: Can iSight be used by more than 1 application at the same time? Just what the title says. Is it supported? If so - does this depend on application or on the system?\n\nA: The simple answer is no - in general the one camera only sends data to one app.\nThe more complicated answer is that the API (application programming interface) that Apple publishes enforces this restriction. If a developer hooks into the hardware directly or there is a bug in the API, it is possible to share that stream.\nSo for most Apps made by someone other than Apple, once the iSight is in use by one application, it is unavailable to other applications until the application releases the use of it or the application closes. User Gentmatt rightly points out that this is not the case for Facetime and Photobooth, where Apple is either using an undocumented or private API or accessing the hardware directly so that both apps can share the camera feed.\n", "Q: iCal events on the desktop; Dashboard widgets vs. GeekTool vs.? Over the last few years I've become very dependent on the Amnesty Widget Browser and a little Dashboard widget called \"iCal Events\" to embed a well-styled list of upcoming iCal events into my desktop background. The beauty of the system is that the information is staring me in the face -- I don't have to go anywhere special or take a special action to see my diary.\nBoth Amnesty and iCal Events are long-abandoned, but I've managed to keep them limping along. The limping is becoming rather bad in Lion, though. I was able to modify the Javascript in iCal Events to let it access my iCloud calendars, but I can no longer move or resize the window it creates, and I can't assign it to \"all\" desktops under Mission Control. The whole thing feels a bit too fragile now, and I need a modern solution.\nI've tried GeekTool and NerdTool, and both offer straightforward ways to get iCal events displayed on the desktop. The trouble is that the output from both is too ugly to look at daily! Fonts and colors can be customized, but I want CSS-level control: spacing and placement, varying colors and shapes depending on the type of information displayed.\nI see three possible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*A modern way to embed Dashboard widgets into the desktop in Lion.\n\n*A way to style GeekTool output more elaborately than just changing the font\n\n*Another solution to getting my iCal Events \"in my face\" that I haven't considered.\n\n\n(I am aware that Dashboard can be run in a developer mode that allow one to drag apps out of the Dashboard itself. I've had several problems with this solution. First, the Dev mode doesn't embed the released widgets into the desktop, so when you use a gesture to sweep aside all the windows, the calendar is swept out of view too. Second, when you restart the computer, you have to drag the widget back out again -- it's not automatic.)\nThanks for your thoughts on this.\n\nA: If you decide to look at new solutions, there are a handful of applications that can do this including Blotter and TimeWorks.\nI prefer the slightly less in my face menubar solution that Fantastical provides.\n\nA: This may not be exactly what you're looking for, but it may help additionally.\nHave you tried OmniGrowl?  It uses Growl to notify you of upcoming calendar events.  By default you will get a notification 1 hour, 30 minutes, and a set amount of minutes before each normal event. You'll get similar appropriate notifications for all-day events and birthdays, etc.  The best is you don't set alarms in iCal, which are annoying for most normal events.\n", "Q: What (un-)documented multitouch gestures exist in Lion and common applications? Safari allows to go back to a previous website using the two-finger-swipe gesture. All of the standard multitouch gestures are very nicely documented in the More Gestures section of the Trackpad system preference:\nI was looking for a similar gesture in Finder. During my research I stumbled upon a MacWorld article to discover:\n\n*\n\n*Use ⌥ + three-finger-swipe to go back/forward in finder.\n\nQuestion:\nThis feature is not documented anywhere I looked.\n\n*\n\n*Are there any other gestures implemented in Lion and common applications (e.g. iLife) besides those in the System Preferences?\n\n\n*Are these \"hidden\" gestures documented by Apple in a help file or knowledge base so I can look for them as I wish to learn more?\nLet's collectively maintain an answer listing of which apps have specific functions controllable by gestures or gestures and keyboard keys.\n\nA: The best resource I have regarding gestures in OS X is: http://www.danrodney.com/mac/multitouch.html\n\nA: Not really a gesture in itself, but I have found that certain gestures (at least on my Magic Trackpad) do not require the requisite amount of touches for the duration of the gesture, just during the initiation, for example starting a 2 finger scroll will happily continue if you then lift one of those fingers off the surface and continue scrollng with 1 finger, giving a more iOS feel to the movement.\n", "Q: How do I close a password-protected numbers spreadsheet on iPad to preserve security? How do I close a password-protected numbers spreadsheet on iPad to preserve security? In apple discussions there is a suggestion to put spreadsheet in trash (supposedly at bottom). There is no trash at bottom. Deleting the spreadsheet doesn't close it, it deletes it. \n\nA: In short - if going back to the linen background doesn't ask for the password again, you may have to force the issue in the same manner as killing a program that is crashing and needs a clean start.\nUsing multitasking, you can try to force the Numbers app to quit on iOS and see if that requires entering the password before viewing that spreadsheet.\n\n\n*\n\n*Close out any spreadsheets you have open so you are at the main screen in Numbers with the linen background.\n\n*Double tap the home button to bring up the multitasking bar\n\n*Swipe left or right (if needed) until you see the numbers icon\n\n*Tap and hold the numbers icon until they all shake and have a small red circle icon with a minus sign in the left corner of the icons\n\n*Tap the minus icon on numbers to cause iOS to terminate numbers and force it to launch from a clean start the next time (rather than resuming the prior state)\n\n\nThis shows how iOS behavior of normally resuming exactly where you left off can have unintended consequences if the app should also have a check against a password and a time out period.\n\nA: When you open such a spreadsheet you get informed that it will become a \"Numbers for iOS\" spreadsheet and you can Open a Copy, or just Open it. If you choose to Open it, you have converted it to Numbers for iOS, and the password is permanently removed. If you choose to Open a Copy, only the copy is converted and has its password removed. When you are done viewing it, delete the Copy, and you will still have the password protected version in iCloud.\nUnfortunately, it means that if you want to preserve the password, you only have read-only access to that file.\n", "Q: Should FaceTime work without a defined Proxy Server on restricted networks? We are having some problems with FaceTime video calling on our network where some traffic is restricted and firewalled from going out to the internet. \nIn order for the iPads on the wireless network to connect to the Internet, a Proxy Server needs to be configured on the iPad.\nUpon making that change, the user can then browse to google.com etc within mobile Safari. Without the Proxy Server set the user can no longer access external webpages within mobile Safari.\nHowever FaceTime works regardless of whether the Proxy Server is set. A faceTime call is initiated from 2 seperate wireless connections.\nThe network configuration here allows users to ping google.com for example regardless of whether a Proxy Server is defined.\nSo.... should FaceTime work without a Proxy and if it does, how does it work?\n\nA: This depends on the limitations you have in your network. If you're only limiting HTTP traffic and forcing the clients to go through a web proxy, then you're probably not cutting off FaceTime's custom TCP and UDP connections.\nThe exact protocol for FaceTime hasn't been released to public by Apple, but they do publish a guideline regarding network configuration (open ports) needed for FaceTime and iMessage: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4245\n", "Q: How can I extract the *.icns from the Get Info dialog?

Sometimes I want to keep an item in the Unread section of the Safari 5.1.3 Reading List after I have read the item. The All section is too cluttered to use as a place to quickly find items. I realize I am trying to use the RL beyond what it was intended to be used for. Nonetheless, is there a way to mark an item in the Safari RL?\n\nA: As you've suggested, the Reading List has fairly limited functionality. While you can't mark a page unread directly from the All list, a simple solution is to open the page and add it to the Reading List again.\n", "Q: Is Thunderbolt backwards-compatible with mini-DP for both input and output?

Right now, it is serving the Netboot and DHCP services. I'd like to set it up as a Software Update server so Mac users in my office can run their software updates more quickly. \nThis is the only Mac server in the office. All of our other servers are all Windows based. Most of the machines (Macs included) are joined to our Windows domain. All the Mac users in the office use portable MacBooks Pro that go home with them at the end of the day. They need to still be able to run use the Apple Software Update server when not in the office. \nI'm looking for a way to have these Macs only use the Software Update server on my Mac Mini Server when in the office and for it to default to the Apple Software Update server when they're not in the office. \nI found this, but it does not run on Lion.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: There is a way to do this, but it involves fiddling with DNS to make a 'transparent' software update server. When clients are on your network, their requests to \"Apple's\" SWU servers go to yours, without any modification of client settings, it truly is transparent.\nCheck this article out. It's a little old, but this is the general idea that you want to be going with.\n\nIn your internal DNS set swquery.apple.com, swcdn.apple.com, and swscan.apple.com as CNAMEs for the server running SUS.\n\n\nA: You could also script a defaults write com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL triggered by a network change, such as grepping for ifconfig or scutil's State:/Network/Interface/en0/IPv4.  Probably easy to do with Lingon etc as well.\n\nA: I have found a link that might be useful to some. There seems to be a workaround for 10.7 server to make the SUS Transparent.\nWe were sticking to 10.6 because we hadn't found a solution that allowed us to upgrade to 10.7 and keep our SUS server working transparently.

I'm seeing some unusual activity on my computer (late 2008 MacBook Pro )\n\nA: Yes, quite a few - ranging from the simple to the more complex. Depends on what you're after in terms of detail, but if you want a nice, easy GUI frontend (that ties up process names with activity) then you could use something like Little Snitch or Hands Off!. They are actually firewalls, which have their own network monitors. So if you find something you don't like, you can always block it.\n\nI also use iStat Menus or iStat Pro (free) which can give you differing view of process and network activity (but not combined like Little Snitch can).\nOr for something more detailed you could investigate the terminal netstat command.\n", "Q: How can I use an Applescript from within a program?

I know how to change the permissions to allow myself to write to the file, and I'm aware of the security implications.\nMy question: will I break anything by modifying the ACLs on /etc/hosts through the Finder?\nI'm running OS X Lion 10.7.3.\n(Since someone is going to ask, I have a Windows 7 VM in VMware Fusion that likes to change its local connection IP address every time it resumes from suspend (VM pause) or reboots.)\n\nA: Nothing will break (or hasn't for me whenever I resort to this on occasion) - you'll have to remember to re-do the permissions if and when the OS updates that file systematically. You'll also want to watch the permissions if you ever \"repair permissions\" since that file is likely recorded in a system receipt. I'd go so far as to set a launchd task to daily enforce your \"custom\" permissions if you feel it's worth that much work and log something to the console about the need for this \"adjustment\"\nThis is a far faster and simpler (and therefore probably better) solution to setting up your own DNS or NIS even though a trip down memory lane would be fun for a few moments:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd /var/yp\n\n*make\n\n\nA: IMO, you're doing it wrong.  mDNS, static IP addresses, all sorts of options are better, but if you insist on making /etc/hosts writable and are willing to accept the problems that this can introduce, why not?\nEvery time a 'repairPermissions' from diskutil is called, you may have to reset them.\n", "Q: What can I use for multi-person, single conversation, instant messaging in a serverless local network? We have a number of Mac's in a small, simple local network at the office (all running Snow Leopard or later) that I'd like to use for instant messaging with multiple participants.\nThe trouble is, at present, they are not internet connected and we have no server machines, so I'm using iChat with Bonjour networking to chat with other users. This all works fine, apart from the big problem that you can only chat with a single user at a time in the same conversation (you can talk to multiple people in separate conversations on a one-to-one basis, but this isn't ideal).\nIs there any way of configuring iChat that I haven't considered? Or another instant messaging client that will allow me to chat with multiple participants, in the same conversation, in a local network without a central server?\nEDIT: Further reading suggests running the iChat service on a OS X Server machine within the network. Is this the only way? I was hoping not to have to add another machine just for this.\n\nA: You don't need the iChat service. Any Jabber (aka XMPP) server will do (the iChat server in OS X Server is also one, basically), and it can run on virtually any machine in your network.\nI'm afraid I can't recommend one, but Google should be able to help you.\n", "Q: How can I use a Macbook Air to provide a TV with an internet connection? The television we  have supports the use of the internet through an Ethernet cable or wireless USB network adapter (bought separately). The television has no built-in wireless and the nearest ethernet port in the house is too far away to be practical.\n\nA: You should be able to do this via Ethernet or wireless, depending on whether you want to buy a wireless dongle for your TV or whether you have the Ethernet adapter for your MacBook Air.\nIf you have the USB Ethernet adapter, you should be able to follow the instructions found here:\n\n*\n\n*Set up the Sharing -The first step is to set up sharing on the host Mac. Head to System Preferences > Sharing\n\n*Set up the client - make sure your TV uses DHCP\n\nGeneral instructions from Apple support:\n\nTo set up Internet sharing:\n\n*\n\n*Choose Apple menu > System Preferences and\nclick Sharing.\n\n\n*Select Internet Sharing.\n\n\n*Choose the Internet connection you want to share from the “Share your\nconnection from” pop-up menu. For example, if you’re connected to the\nInternet over Ethernet, choose Ethernet.\n\n\n*Select how you want to share your Internet connection in the “To\ncomputers using” list. For example, if you want to share your Internet\nconnection over AirPort, select AirPort.\n\n\n*If you share your Internet connection using AirPort, click AirPort\nOptions and give your network a name and password.\n\nEither approach should work - it's most likely a matter of the hardware that you have (or are willing to acquire).

I'm registered with Apple with a Belgian account, though I hope this wouldn't make a difference to updates.\nAny suggestions appreciated.\n\nA: According to Apple, the 3rd gen iPod Touch can be upgraded to iOS 5. However, you may want to confirm that your iPod is not a 2nd gen version - those can only be upgraded to 4.2.1. \nApple Support has the following information to confirm your version (full page):\n\niPod touch (3rd generation) features a 3.5-inch (diagonal) widescreen\n  multi-touch display and 32 GB or 64 GB flash drive.

It's possible that the creators of the video podcast changed their video format to high definition. If that is the case,  these items will not sync because the 3GS can't playback certain HD video formats that are targeted for other more powerful Apple devices like iPad or Apple TV. \nMore info on supported video formats: http://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/iphone-video-format-supported.htm\n", "Q: 6th generation iPod Nano video out Is the 6th/7th generation iPod Nano capable of sending video out through the 32 pin connector into a suitable digital dock?\nIf so, could the camera adapter kit be used as it can for the iPad to stream digital video out to a DAC?\n\nA: 6th and 7th gen iPod nanos aren't capable of playing videos to the screen, so I highly doubt they'll output any video to the dock.\n(They're probably entirely missing the video decoding hardware needed to do either.)\n", "Q: How can I make a soft link in Lion? I realized today that an alias is not the same thing as a soft link in Lion.

In Ubuntu, I can, however, cd into a soft link.\nHow can I create a soft link in Lion? It would be convenient for me because I write python scripts that rely on soft links.\n\nA: You can create soft links (a.k.a. symbolic links or symlinks) from the terminal, the same way as in any other Unix system.\nI'm not familiar with Dropbox so I'll make up an example assuming that there is a folder Dropbox in your home directory:\ncd ~\nln -s ~/Dropbox/aFolder Desktop/aFolder\n\nNote that ln takes the link to create as its second argument; think of it like cp.\nAlso, a warning: if you create a soft link with a relative path, for example\ncd ~/Desktop\nln -s ../Dropbox/aFolder aFolder\n\nthen the link will be relative to its location at the moment, not to the current directory when you created it! So, for example, if you moved it into ~/Desktop/Folders then it would be pointing at ~/Desktop/Dropbox instead of ~/Dropbox.\n\nA: You must use the Unix ln command from Terminal.\nln -s existingname newname\n\n", "Q: the iCloud IMAP server \"p01-imap.mail.me.com\" rejected the password for user xxxxxx I reset my Apple ID (@me.com - Only have ONE account) as Apple asked me to update my information with a more strong password.

To see such a feature in the Finder would be nice. \n\nA: According to Apple Support, you can change the default Download directory in Safari:\n\nIf you like, you can change the default folder for storing downloads\n  by using your browser’s preferences. To specify a different folder in\n  Safari, choose Safari > Preferences, and then click General.\n\nYou should then be able to switch to use your external HDD by default.\nAs other posters have noted, Firefox and Chrome can also be configured to use a different download directory.\nIt might be possible to directly save a file (if a link is provided) by right clicking and selecting the Download Linked File As... option. Select your desired location and save the file.\n\nA: Have you tried using the native FTP app under File Sharing? Not sure if it will allow you to save to an external disk though. Haven't tried that but it works great for saving into the local desktop and from there moving it to whatever location you want or you can put an Automator script to move the file after it's being downloaded.\n\nA: Well, by definition the standard \"end user\" tool to download a file accessible via URL is the browser. If you don't want to use the browser, there isn't an OS provided tool other than curl. \nIf you want to make it more user friendly and don't want to use a third party tool (like Cyberduck for example, although it doesn't support http downloads), your best solution is probably to wrap curl in an AppleScript.\n", "Q: App for hi-res frame capture from a webcam I need a simple app to capture single frames from a high-res webcam.

However, it appears that in the latest updates to Lion (I am using 10.7.3) that this functionality has been removed/disabled. FWIW, I'm trying to access the documents on my iPad stored in GoodReader from my Mac.\nDoes anyone know any workarounds or alternative approaches for this?\n\nA: I posted a solution here that doesnt require any special apps/tricks:\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/63026/28551\n\nA: I don't have a 10.7.3 system to test on, but on 10.7.4 the folder ~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents exists and is populated with whatever cloud documents I have from iOS.\nPerhaps something else is preventing you from getting the files. Have you tried turning of iCloud Documents in your user account and making a new user on the Mac.\nIf the folder appears on the new user when you turn on document syncing - perhaps turning it off and then on the first account will nudge things. Worst case, you will be narrowing it down to an account or a software issue with these steps.\n", "Q: Restoring track information for iTunes Match files I made the mistake of editing a bunch of songs at once. Now, the changes have propagated to all of my iTunes Match registered devices. I tried Advanced > Get Track Names, but I get the following message\n\niTunes cannot get CD track names for songs that were not imported using iTunes\n\n\nThe thing is, the songs were originally imported using iTunes before syncing with iTunes Match.\nIs there an easy way to restore track information, or must I manually go through the tracks and fix them?\n\nA: You must fix the track data yourself, however, that doesn't mean that you have to do it manually (but of course you can).\nThere is a myriad of software that aims to do this for you automatically. One that I can think of off the top of my head for Windows is TuneUp. It's a bit expensive, $40 for a year or $50 for \"Lifetime\". It runs along side iTunes and fixes it up when requested, or even automatically if configured.\nThere is plenty of other software I'm sure, some that aids the process of doing it manually, others that try to do it completely on it's own ala.

Does turning on WiFi (without connecting to any wireless network) use battery?\n\nA: Yes, turning on features will use more power. According to Apple, you can save power by turning off WiFi if you're not using that feature:\n\nOptimize Your Settings \nDepending on how they are configured, a few\n  features may decrease your iPhone battery life. For example, the\n  frequency with which you retrieve email and the number of email\n  accounts you auto-check can both affect battery life. The tips below\n  apply to an iPhone running iOS 5.0 or later and may help extend your\n  battery life.\n\nand more specifically:\n\nTurn off Wi-Fi: If you rarely use Wi-Fi, you can turn it off to save\n  power. Go to Settings > Wi-Fi and set Wi-Fi to Off. Note that if you\n  frequently use your iPhone to browse the web, battery life may be\n  improved by using Wi-Fi instead of cellular data networks.\n\nThe same principle is true for all other features (bluetooth, push email, etc.). Turn off what you don't need to conserve power.\n\nA: Interestingly enough some people have found turning on WiFi to actually cause them to have better battery life. This is very much dependent on how you use it, but the people that I know who have experienced this say they are in strong wifi buildings with weak 3g signal. Having all of their email going over WiFi has saved them battery life.\nBut apart from that, all of the other guys are right, it will pull more power since you aren't actively connected but still pulling for networks.\n\nA: Yes. Your phone will be polling periodically for available networks, which will use battery. Even you set it to not ask to join networks, the radio is powered up and that takes some amount of power to do.\n", "Q: Where do I learn to manage a Mac OS Server network? I inherited a network with 2 Mac OS Servers and 20+ Macbook Pros. My background is all Windows server so I get the concept of Open Directory, Server Admin, and Workgroup Manager, but the nuts and bolts are more difficult to pick up.\nCan someone recommend a starting point to learn all of this? So much of the resources I found out there are for home users and not necessarily for a work environment.\n\nA: Ifskills has a great tutorial of Mac OS X Server. I'm still going through it myself. It is massively helpful.\n\nA: Apple has a certification program analogous to Microsoft's MCSE (Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer) certification. They have classroom training at authorized training centers, but they are offered in far fewer cities and less often than those for Microsoft or Cisco. If your employer is willing to pay for it, it would be a good idea to pursue this.\nI hold three Apple certifications (see my Ask Different profile here on this site) although none of mine are in network administration.\nYou might want to pursue the Apple Certified Technical Coordinater certification. If not, at least look at the training materials and third-party books that cover preparation for the Apple OS X Server Essentials 10.7 Exam (9L0-515), or the previous exam for 10.6, which is still available.\nLook at Apple's Training and Certification web site to learn about their program.\nIn the meantime, I would steer you to the Apple-authorized training books from Peachpit Press.\n\nA: If you are looking for a learning place you can check: \nhttp://www.certifiedtraining.com/coursedesc.php?id=101\nhttp://www.learningtree.com/search/search.aspx?Submit.x=0&Submit.y=0&Submit=Submit&q=Mac\nhttp://training.apple.com/classes\nhttp://www.lynda.com/Mac-OS-X-10-7-tutorials/Mac-OS-X-Lion-Essential-Training/85081-2.html\nIf looking to learn on your own at your own pace... there are great resources/books out there.

I've got a couple of DMGs that should fit on a CD (one per CD) but burning softwares (Disk Utility & Toast) say that they are 2 or 3 times bigger and thus need a DVD.\nWhy is that ?\n\nA: Different file systems and disk formats have different block sizes, which all files are rounded up to in size.  If you have a lot of small files on one file system, and try to move them all to a different file system or media format with much larger block sizes, the total space required can balloon.\n\nA: Is the disk image compressed?\nIf so, then the .dmg file is probably going to be about 2 or 3 times smaller than the data it contains.  When you mount the image, you can do Get Info on the mounted volume to see the volume size, which is how much space you will need on actual media.\nEven an uncompressed image file may be smaller than the volume it contains as the image file may not include unallocated space.\n", "Q: Rotating a video in QT player 10 I'm trying to rotate an iPhone 4S vid 90degrees Counter Clockwise.\nI've seen lots of posts and answers that say there is an 'Edit > Rotate Left' option in Quicktime Player.

Without resorting to editing the host file (as shown in this Apple.SE thread), is there any way to add a new search engine option to Safari for Windows? Glims works great on OS X, but unfortunately is not an option since my work machine is a Windows 7 box.\nEDIT: I'd prefer a generic solution, similar to Glims, that would allow me to add any search engine to the search options.\n\nA: There are a few Safari Extensions that will enable this:\nhttp://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/35036/popsearch-safari-extension\nhttp://safariextensions.org/detail/Search_All/\nhttp://safariextensions.org/detail/CustomSearch/\nhttp://safariextensions.org/detail/OpenSearch_for_Safari/\n\nA: This is not possible. Safari currently does not let you use anything outside of Google, Bing, or Yahoo, without doing hacks like those you linked to. \nThe only other option would be to use a Safari Extension if the search provider you want to use offers one.\nMany of the Safari plugins on the Mac use very Mac-specific API's and are more of additions to Safari through the Mac OS versus plugins that would be less platform-specific. Therefore, many plugins like this would have to be completely redone on Windows. \n", "Q: Using tmux and pbpaste, pbcopy, and launchctl I have discovered that tmux breaks pbpaste, pbcopy and launchctl.\nIs there a good way to make it play nice with these tools?\n\nA: Okay, I found a solution...\nChris Johnsen has a good writeup of what causes this problem on github.\nHis tools work, but a better solution, if you have homebrew installed to:\nbrew install reattach-to-user-namespace\n\nThen in your ~/.tmux.conf add these lines:\nset-option -g default-command \"reattach-to-user-namespace -l zsh\" # or bash\nbind C-c run \"tmux show-buffer | reattach-to-user-namespace pbcopy\"\nbind C-v run \"reattach-to-user-namespace pbpaste | tmux load-buffer - && tmux paste-buffer\"\n\nThe first line ensures your shell can talk to pbpaste, pbcopy and launchctl now with no worries.\nThe second line lets you copy the tmux paste buffer into the Mac's paste buffer by typing control-b control-c (replace control-b with your tmux prefix key).\nThe third line will directly paste the Mac's paste buffer by typing control-v.  As a side-effect it copies the Mac's paste buffer into tmux's paste buffer.\nI'd prefer if I could nuke tmux's paste buffer entirely and have it paste directly into the Mac`s paste buffer, but... oh well.\n", "Q: How can I sort Safari bookmarks in Lion? I used Bookmarkdog in Snow Leopard and Lion but since I'm using iCloud that app no longer works and its successor BookMaster does not seem to be doing the sorting like Bookmarkdog used to do.\n\n\n*\n\n*What others tools are using to sort Safari's bookmarks?\n\n*How do you keep your Safari Bookmarks sorted?\n\n\nA: Bookmarks bar:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bookmarks in the bookmarks bar can be sorted using drag-and-drop.\n\n\nBookmarks menu:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you toggle Show All Bookmarks ⌘+⌥+B and click on collections → bookmarks menu, you may manually sort bookmarks which are located in the bookmarks menu.\n\n\nYou can sort bookmarks alphabetically using SafariSort (free). This applications works with the latest version of Safari in Lion (5.1.4, march 2012) and sorts folders and 'simple' bookmarks seperately. Unfortunately, such an option is not provided with Safari out of the box.\n\nA: I have been using Bookmark Sorter on Lion and like it a lot. It installs itself as a Safari service and almost feels like sorting from within Safari itself. It can also run as a background process and automatically sort new bookmarks. It is a great little utility. \n\nA: Use SafariSort its super fast and free. \n\nSafariSort will alphabetically sort your Safari bookmarks in just one click! All your folders, sub-folders and bookmarks will be sorted enabling you to actually find what you're looking for.\n\n\nA: I keep all my bookmarks in (subfolders of folders of) the bookmark bar, and use the excellent free service called Xmarks to sync them across computers. Unlike iCloud, Xmarks allows me to sync across browsers and operating systems (I do use iCloud for bookmark sync with the iPhone).\nNever had any sorting issues to date: my custom (non-alphabetical) sort order seems to be preserved. But then again, who cares about the sort order, when Quicksilver instantly finds any bookmark upon typing a few characters of its name or URL...\n\nA: I have the same problem where sorting bookmarks in Safari, manually or using an app, does not work - the sorted bookmarks automatically get re-sorted in a messed up random order. This is iCloud randomly rearranging bookmarks when it syncs. \nSo I don't use iCloud for bookmark syncing, xmarks is excellent, free for PCs, laptops etc, and only $12 a year for the premium version which covers mobile devices.\n", "Q: Icons on the desktop may slow down Mac? When I ask a question about if I run too many process will slow down my Mac for Magican measured my Mac is high CPU usage. A Mac user tell me the icons on the desktop may still influence the performance of my Mac. Is this true?\n\nA: Reputable sources like Macworld indicate that the Finder draws non-generic Desktop icons the same way it draws open windows, and the more of them there are, the more memory and processor time it takes to refresh the Desktop. I have not found any sources that indicate this is a major factor in system speed, but yes, more custom icons on the Desktop take more resources when the computer redraws the Desktop.\n\nA: What do you mean with \"icons on the desktop\"? Having files (docs, pictures, etc) does not slows your machine down though. Now, if you are referring to the apps on your Doc if you have a lot open and depending what apps you have it might. Widgets can slow somewhat the system. You might want to look also into upgrading your memory if your system just came with the minimum. I have a MBP and after upgrading the memory from 4 to 8 GB I saw a huge positive improvement.\n", "Q: My external disk made a clicking noise. What should I do? I have a USB2+Firewire external disk that made a clicking noise, and Mac OS X immediately unmounted it and put up a dialog box saying that a peripheral is misbehaving. The disk made a clicking noise several times in a short interval, and each time it did, the dialog box on screen would flash. So I unplugged it, waited for a few seconds, and plugged it in to another Mac, and this time it worked perfectly. I copied all 800 GB of data out of the drive over some 9 hours, and it worked perfectly and at its usual speed of 30 - 40 MB/second.\nNow that all my data is out of the disk, I repaired the filesystem using Disk Utility. What else should I do? Should I run some kind of disk scan tool that checks the entire disk for bad blocks? Can you suggest a tool for the Mac? Since the disk has a HFS+ partition (and a FAT32 partition), I think I should run a disk repair tool on Mac rather than Linux. Is that correct?\nI don't have SMART data since it's an external disk, and I don't want to break open the enclosure.\nThanks.\n\nA: Clicking noises are generally signs of immanent disk failure. Backing up your important data on that drive is a good idea, and you should do that first thing. \nMost HDD manufacturers have tools that will perform thorough checks on your disks health and come in different formats (most require an image to burned to a CD/DVD and then boot to it).\nDo you know what the model of the external drive or the hard disk it houses?\n\nA: Does your drve use external power supply? If not, there may be not enough current supplied through the USB connector. \n\nA: A clicking noise can mean anything from an isolated bad block to imminent failure of the drive motor.\nSomething else to consider is power.  Low voltage to a hard-drive can mimic all manner of failures.  If it was running on bus-power, try wall-power instead.  If it was running on wall-power, try a different power supply (if one is available).\nBacking up your data was the absolute right thing to do.  If the problem does not happen again, it was probably just an isolated bad block.  But if it does keep happening, particularly after the drive has been running for a while, then check the power supply and if that isn't it assume the motor is dying.  But since it worked for 9 hours to copy the data off, it was probably just a bad block which has since been reallocated.\nKeep making backups!\n", "Q: What malware has actually affected Jailbroken iOS devices? Are there examples of malware that affects jailbroken iOS devices that doesn't require installation of shady packages (e.g. something that can compromise a device just by opening a PDF or visiting a site)?\n\nA: I hate to say it, but in all my years of jailbreaking I have yet to see any type of malware have any real impact on the iOS community. Sure there was the infamous SSH vulnerability, but that was patched rather quick. That's the beauty of jailbreaking; we don't have to wait for Apple to release a fix. Most people fear that jailbreaking is insecure and puts your device at risk. That's far from the truth. My favorite example is the jailbreakme.com PDF exploit for iOS 4.3.3. At the same time they released the exploit, they pushed a patch to Cydia. As soon as you jailbroke, you were advised to install the patch, so that your device could not be further compromised. It took Apple a lot longer to implement and roll out their fix. In that situation, it was better to jailbreak than to not, because unless you had the patch, someone with bad intentions could have abused the exploit and done anything they wished with your device. Sure, you can be careless and install some malicious software, but most of the time it's the user's fault, because you always should be careful with what you do in a limited-regulation environment. As a final answer to your question, there were a few PDF exploits that were triggered merely be visiting a website (jailbreakme.com), but those vulnerabilities were never used for evil.\nEdit: Another malware example has popped up, but it's not specific to jailbroken devices; it can remotely jailbreak any device without user interaction. This is the first time we've seen a remote jailbreak being used in the wild for malicious use. Apple has already patched it - they patched it quick. But the jailbreak community took a few months to patch it.\n\nA: If you leave your device unattended for just a couple of minutes a trojan horse can be quickly installed.

And the current generation, Thunderbolt-equipped, MacBook Airs do not support more than one external display via the Thunderbolt port. The graphics chip used in these Macs isn't up to the task of driving extremely high resolution display combinations.\nReference:\n\nUnfortunately, this ability is lost on the 2011 MacBook Air, due to the weaker Intel HD 3000 graphics chip and a stripped down Thunderbolt controller.\n\n\nA: As has been mentioned, you couldn't daisy-chain multiple Thunderbolt displays on pre-2012 Airs. Two possible add-ons that'll allow you to connect an additional external display:\n\n\n*\n\n*Matrox DualHead2Go (in action hooked up to an 11\" Air)\n\n*DisplayLink adapter\n\n\nI've used the latter and they work pretty well for non-intensive applications.\n\nA: Your Air supports the internal display as well as only one ThunderBolt external display.

I just bought my first 13\" MacBook Pro. Before purchasing new games for my Windows notebook, I used to check the compatibility with Can You Run It, but that site doesn't list Mac compatibility or requirements.\nIs there any other website where I can check game compatibility for Mac computers?\nSpecifically, I'd like to play Call of Duty 4 and Civilization V.

In the small window that shows up on your screen click the More Info... button and you'll be given a detailed run down of all the hardware in your Mac.\n\nAs for:\n\nIs there any other website where I can check game compatibility for my MacBook Pro?\n\nYou've already hit on one source: the App Store.\nAnother route is to use Steam. You can filter games to purchase based on OS and within in each there is a general description of what you need to play the game in terms of hardware.\nGame manufacturers also list compatibility and hardware requirements on their websites for any given game. Though, looking at the Civilization V website, I suppose they don't keep this information up to date as games are ported.\nAnd as the final, canonical source, you can always ask the manufacturer of the software.\n\nA: If your Macbook Pro 13\" is brand new, then you have an integrated graphics card, the Intel HD Graphics 3000. \nCall of Duty 4's page on the Mac App Store says that \"Intel Integrated video chipsets are not supported (GMA 950/GMA X3100); X1900 not supported.\" \nI read that to mean that your computer won't run the game (or won't run it well). While I've been typing this I see that better answers have been posted, so I will defer to those!\n\nA: About the graphics of the MBP\nThe Macbook Pro 13'' uses integrated Intel HD 3000 graphics. But Intel HD 3000 graphics are used in different processors. The performance varies depending on whether it's a mobile or desktop CPU. You need to read benchmarks with caution:\n\n*\n\n*ULV processors core ix-2xx7 (base freq. 350MHz, turbo 900-1000MHz) (Macbook Air)\n\n*LV processors core ix-2xx5 (base freq. 500MHz, turbo 1000MHz)\n\n*standard dual and quad-core  ix-2xx0 (base freq. 650MHz, turbo 1100-1200MHz) (Macbook Pros)\n\n*desktop K processors (base freq. 850, turbo 1100-1350MHz)\n\nGaming Performance\nOn notebookcheck.net I've looked up some statistics. They keep benchmarks on how different games perform. I find these real world tests quite useful.\nIf you follow the link, you can click on the single fps results to see each system configuration.\n\n\nConclusion\nYou should have a minimum of 24-30 fps to enjoy playing. Considering this, I'll say that playing those games on a MBP 13'' of 2011 will possibly work, but not result in the maximum fun :).\n", "Q: Can't I use different Wi-Fi networks for different Locations? I'm having trouble understanding what I'm doing wrong here: I'm trying to set up two network Locations, one for my home network via my cable modem and a second for Wi-Fi tethering via my mobile phone. What I'd like to be able to do is change the Location (under the Apple menu > Location) and have my Mac automatically connect to the proper Wi-Fi network: either my home network SSID or my WiFi tethering SSID.\nI defined two locations, switched between them, and set the preferred network list for each location. But when I change the preferred network list for one Location, it changes the list for the other Location as well!\nAm I doing something wrong or is it really not possible to maintain a separate list of Preferred Networks for each network Location? It seems doubtful it's not possible since just about every other netrok setting depends on the location...\nI am using OS X 10.7.2.\n\nA: The Sidekick app (which used to be called NetworkLocation) is an ideal tool for automating changes based on the location of your Mac. It's a veritable swiss army knife of tools, works well in Lion and has plug ins and terminal support for extending it should the built in tools not cover your additional use cases. For simple network location changes, you are covered with this app.\n", "Q: Any reasons that prevent Apple Remote Desktop to wake sleeping Macs? Is there any known reason why I cannot wake up sleeping Macs with Apple Remote Desktop?\n\n\n*\n\n*I have checked the Energy Saver Prefs \"Wake for network access\".\n\n*I have checked the Sharing Prefs \"Remote Login\" and \"Remote Management\".\n\n\nA: \"Wake for network access\" refers to the system receiving a special \"Wake On Media\" or \"Wake On LAN\" packet from the local ethernet network.\nSimply trying to connect with a network application will not wake it up.  That's because while the computer is sleeping, it cannot process any network traffic.  WOM works at the hardware level of the ethernet card: the card stays powered on and when it sees an ethernet packet with its MAC address and a certain byte pattern, it wakes up the computer.\nBecause WOM is based on ethernet frames, it generally cannot not work by itself outside of your local LAN.  Some routers provide utilities which let you remotely instruct the router to generate a WOM packet, but not typically consumer grade routers.\n\nA: Have you checked this archived kbase article?  In my experience, wake-on-LAN has never worked very reliably with ARD 3.

They provide a cheap and ready source of ridiculously expensive to replace parts, including such things as small metric screws. \n\nA: iFixit is a good place for parts. They seem to sell complete screw kits for different models. \nAlthough one screw missing won’t hurt the unit.

I am really looking at getting a used Mac Pro, and there are a lot of good used machines out there that will meet my needs that are around $1500. I was wondering what options I can get to help cover the repair / replacement of a used Mac Pro in the rare event that something goes wrong with it? A lot of the machines I am looking at are used and not refurbished and are not eligible for AppleCare any more. What do you use to cover your pre-owned and somewhat pricey used Macs?\n\nA: Your best bet is probably to look for a third party insurance company that offers policies for used computers. I ran a Google search for \"third party insurance for used computers\" and come up with one example insurance company, Safeware.\nWhether such a warranty or insurance policy is worth the cost depends on how much you acquired your used Mac for and how much you value \"peace of mind\", since these policies are likely to be expensive and come with fairly strict limitations in coverage.\n\nA: If they're no longer eligible for AppleCare, there is no warranty available. Period.\nThe closest I can think of would be to get a rider on your homeowners' or renters' insurance to cover the computer, but it would likely cover different events than a warranty would (more on the order of theft, probably not hardware faults). \nTalk to your local Apple Genius, your local Apple Authorized Reseller, and your insurance agent, in that order.\n\nA: What I ended up doing was purchasing the used mac from a 3rd party vendor, that offered a basic 1 year warranty for no additional charge.  \n", "Q: Fixing old G3 and G4 laptops After I replaced the hard drive in my old iBook G3 (with the help of iFixit guides), it will not boot connected to mains power, only with the battery.

In addition it has a yellow vertical line on the monitor at the beginning of its rightmost third part to the left. \nI suspect a logical board problem on the G3, and some physical damage on the G4's HDD. \n\nA: Your G3 probably has a dead motherboard battery.  Depending on the model, they are usually not that hard to replace and cost between $2 and $30. \nAs for the G4, I'd say physical damage from the fall is a pretty good assumption.  Since it sounds like multiple components are damaged, it may not be worth the effort to fix unless you just like to tinker.\n\nA: Usually when the date is reset after every boot it's a sign of a dead motherboard battery.

I work on a college campus with a number of iMacs hooked up to projectors. For some reason, after imaging, they all default to 800x600 resolution on both the iMacs and the projectors, despite their shared maximum display resolutions. Is there any way to automatically tell the Mac to default the resolution to something higher and maintain that for all users regardless of what it's hooked up to? Alternately, is there any way I can change the default resolution for all users after the imaging process is complete?\nI've found the com.apple.preference.displays file in /Library/Preferences/ByHost, but because it relies on the machine's UUID I don't think it will allow me to push that out remotely...\n\nA: I've used this little app before and it works quite well. \nhttp://www.mowlem-enterprises.co.uk/screenutil/ScreenUtil_v1.0.zip\nYou'd just throw that into your image in your terminal path somewhere (/usr/sbin) then you can ARD shell command the terminal command you need or script it into the image. \n", "Q: Is it possible to have 2 iCloud email accounts in IOS 5? Under a Mobile Me Family Pack, I set up a secondary email account for myself, giving me two \"username@me.com\" addresses. When I transitioned to iCloud, I used my primary Mobile Me account, which I set up on my Mac and iPad. In June of 2012, Mobile Me will cease to exist, but I still need to use that second account. Is it possible to have both my primary iCloud email, and that secondary account on my iPad? (On my Mac, i just set up another User Account, and used it to \"migrate\" that second Mobile Me account to iCloud.)\nI would Only need to sync Mail to my iPad for the latter, so would not be concerned with duplicating Adress Book contacts, Calendar etc.\n\nA: It sounds like you've already discovered that you can migrate each MobileMe Family Member sub-account individually to iCloud. Having done that, you can now add the second account to your iPad as a secondary iCloud account by going to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Add Account… > iCloud.\nYou can also add secondary iCloud accounts in OS X by going to System Preferences > Mail, Contacts & Calendars > Add Account… > iCloud. This way you don't have to switch users in OS X to access the second iCloud account's mail.\nYou can migrate remaining MobileMe Family Members by going to me.com/move, instead of having to create a new user in OS X to do the migration.\nPrimary iCloud accounts can use a few features that secondary accounts can't:\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS 5: Photo Stream, Documents & Data, and Backup\n\n*OS X Lion: Bookmarks, Photo Stream, Find My Mac, and iCloud Storage\n\nA: iCloud has a feature called \"iCloud mail aliases\" which allows users to create up to three so-called alias emails.

I have no applications on my external drives.\nHow can I stop the spinning beach ball from happening when selecting \"Open With\"?\nIt seems to be related to the external drive being in power save mode. Although I can't confirm this.\n\nA: Usually, you can stop the startup disk from spinning down by going to System Preferences > Energy Saver, then unchecking \"Put the hard disks to sleep when possible\". However, whilst this is certainly true for the startup disk, whether this is adhered to by external drives seems to be wholly dependant on the drive itself.\nThis page has more information, including a description of your problem, but also says\n\nSecond, some non-startup drives simply ignore the setting of Put the hard disk(s) to sleep when possible and spin down on their own schedule. This appears to be a function of either the drive itself or, in the case of external drives, the firmware or chipset employed in the drive's enclosure. In such a case the drive's Standby behavior cannot be changed. One can contact the manufacturer of the drive or enclosure to see if a firmware update is available to improve its cooperation with Mac OS X power management.\n\nThe only other way I can think of around this, if the above doesn't work, is forcibly keeping the drive awake. To do this you could simply set up a script to touch a file on the external drive at fixed intervals.\n\nA: I can't reproduce this behavior, but troubles with the \"Open with...\" menu are often caused by an outdated or damaged launchservice database.\nTry to rebuild it with\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\n\nin Terminal.\n", "Q: Edit Lion default web site pages The first part of the question is: where are the actual files that are displayed by apache for the default web server in Lion Server?\nSpecifically as simple task I would like to change the title of the default web page.\nWhen the address is bookmarked it shows as \"OS X Lion Server\" and I want to change that.\nI looked everywhere and I couldn't find the actual files.

On Lion Quicktime, the trim function still exists. But there is no option in the File menu to save the trimmed video as .mov. The only option is to \"save for device\" which actually trancodes the video (instead of just putting it in a different container) and takes an awful lot of time.\nMy question is twofold:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will Snow Leopard QuickTime work on Lion? (e.g. if I restore it from backup)\n\n*Are there any free programs for cutting videos without transcoding?\n\n\nA: Not sure whether Snow Leopard Quick Time will work if you restore it on Lion, since I don't have that version to restore. \nHowever, there are a few freeware utilities that can clip videos:\n\n\n*\n\n*According to this Super User thread, VLC can both cut clips of video without transcoding and also transcode entire streams/files into different formats (see the VLC wiki).\n\n*How-to Geek has a guide that shows how to quickly cut clips from videos with Avidemux.\n\n*SimpleMovieX has a free (unlimited) trial that can also do the trick.

The program should run in batch mode to resize all files in a folder and then save new files to different folder. An option for setting jpg quality would be great, too.\n\nA: Several people have mentioned ImageMagick. Here is a recipe:\nFor simplicity, assume all the files are in one folder (and the folder contains nothing else). Open a terminal window, cd into this folder, then run\nmkdir ../resized\nfor x in *.jpg; do convert -geometry 800x600 $x ../resized/$x\n\nwhere you replace the 800x600 by whatever size you want.\nAdvantages include a great amount of flexibility in ImageMagick's convert, such as the ability to select different quality settings for the target image, or setting the resize option by percentages. Or you can use -geometry 800x800, in which case the aspect ratio will be preserved, but the maximum of the width and height will be 800 pixels.\nDisadvantages are the obvious ones: It requires a certain familiarity with the command line, plus a willingness to plough through the command line options of convert for the settings you want. This is not a task for the faint of heart.\n\nA: I second GraphicConverter. I've been a registered user for 16 years. Its main purpose is batch-processing image editing, and it has a good user interface for designing custom workflows and saving them.\nYou can also use it in conjunction with Automator, but you probably won't need to.\nHere is some information from GraphicConverter's page explaining their batch processing image editing functions.\n\nBatch conversion with additional functions \nGraphicConverter offers you sophisticated batch  processing which\n  fully automates repetitive tasks applied to a selection of pictures:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Convert all the selected source pictures easily and quickly into a new format - regardless of whether there are 5 or 5,000 picture files;\n  you just define the type of conversion and set the details \n  \n*During the conversion process you can apply up to 60 additional batch functions such as rotation, resize, change the resolution, etc.\n  \n*Automate the removal of the Mac OS Ressourcefork before documents are uploaded if there are compatibility problems when the picture\n  files are placed in the internet \n  \n*Create catalogs in HTML format for publication in the internet and adjust the colors, sizes, etc. to your individual requirements (see\n  examples)\n  \n*Rename a selection of documents according to special criteria  quickly and easily\n  \n*Join pictures together (e.g. for QuickTime VR)\n  \n*Insert or extract IPTC information into or out of a variety of  document formats \n  \n*and much more ...\n  \n\n\n\nA: This is yet another simple, clean and effective batch image resize script.\nIf you are dealing with graphics and different resolutions a lot, you can use this script and save it with different values for occasional uses.\nDo so, by changing this target_width 120 value to your needs and save the script. Now drag your image(s) onto the saved script-file to start resizing your image(s).\n\nOpen Script Editor, and create the following new script:\n-- save in Script Editor as Application\n-- drag files to its icon in Finder\n\non open some_items\n  repeat with this_item in some_items\n    try\n      rescale_and_save(this_item)\n    end try\n  end repeat\nend open\n\n\nto rescale_and_save(this_item)\n  tell application \"Image Events\"\n    launch\n    set the target_width to 120\n    -- open the image file\n    set this_image to open this_item\n\n    set typ to this_image's file type\n\n    copy dimensions of this_image to {current_width, current_height}\n    if current_width is greater than current_height then\n      scale this_image to size target_width\n    else\n      -- figure out new height\n      -- y2 = (y1 * x2) / x1\n      set the new_height to (current_height * target_width) / current_width\n      scale this_image to size new_height\n    end if\n\n    tell application \"Finder\" to set new_item to ¬\n    (container of this_item as string) & \"scaled.\" & (name of this_item)\n    save this_image in new_item as typ\n\n  end tell\nend rescale_and_save\n\noriginal source\n\nA: I'm a little surprised that no one has mentioned the easiest, cheapest, and least technical option:\nAutomator\nFirst, open Automator, which is in your Applications folder.\nNext, choose to create a new workflow:\n\nNext, add the following steps to the workflow by dragging and dropping:\n\nWhen you run this, Automator is going to:\n\n*\n\n*pop up a window asking you to pick some files (as many as you want)\n\n*pop up another window asking where you want to save the resized copies\n\n*ask you how big you want the resized copies to be.  You'll be able to choose either a fixed size or a percentage.  All the images will be resized to either that size or by that percentage.\n\n(The \"show this action when the workflow runs\" checkbox means that the workflow is going to pause, display the option, and allow you to change it then)\nOnce you do that, Automator is going to churn and burn, and when it's done it'll beep at you.\nUnfortunately, it doesn't seem to have an option to choose JPEG quality.  However, for the price (free), it's pretty dang convenient.\n\nA: Preview is certainly a good solution for some occasional resizing. There are also other nice free options, such as ImageMagic (command-line utility), Preview or something else plus Automator, etc.\nHowever, if this is a part of your job and you need a true flexibility, a special-purpose application will save you a lot of time, and offer much more opportunities.  Many users chose our batch image resizer Resize Sense (http://veprit.com/resizesense) for its outstanding flexibility and convenience.\nDisclaimer: I am the developer. You better judge Resize Sense yourself. The introductory video on the product website will tell you exactly what is so special in Resize Sense. There is a free demo version.\n\nA: Graphic Converter\nThe best for this..\n\nA: I like to use ImageMagick. sips and Automator (which use an identical resizing method) make images look too blurry without additional sharpening in my opinion.\nYou can install ImageMagick with brew install imagemagick after installing Homebrew or with sudo port install imagemagick after installing MacPorts. Then run a command like this:\nmogrify -filter lanczos2 -resize '500x500>' -format jpg -quality 90 -path /tmp/ *.jpg\n\n500x500> makes images wider or taller than 500px fit to 500x500px. 500x would always change the width to 500 px and 500x500^ would make all images at least 500x500px. -path /tmp/ saves the output files to /tmp/ instead of modifying files in place.\nLanczos2 or the 2-lobe Lanczos is very similar to Catrom. Compared to Lanczos (Lanczos3), they are slightly less sharp, produce less ringing artifacts, and produce more Moiré patterns. The default filter for making images smaller is Triangle, which often makes images too blurry in my opinion.\n-quality 100 creates files about twice as big -quality 95, which creates files about twice as big as -quality 88.\nMore information:\nhttp://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/resize/\nhttp://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/filter/\nhttp://lri.me/shell1.txt\nHere's a similar command that uses sips:\nfor f in *.jpg; do sips -Z 500 -s format jpeg -s formatOptions 80 \"$f\" /tmp/; done\n-Z 500 is like 500x500> in ImageMagick.\nIf others have less than 100,000 images, you might also use Preview:\n\nPreview used to use the same resizing method as sips and Automator, but it has used a different one since 10.7. I prefer ImageMagick's Lanczos2 though.\nI uploaded a comparison of the different options to http://19a5b0.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/imagemagick-osx-resizing/index.html.\n\nA: ImageMagick is a command line interface program and made for this purpose. The use and installation of ImageMagick can intimidating, but this image manipulation package is the most powerfull I have encountered so far. As the installation from source can be a hassle for native OS X users I advise you to use Homebrew.\nTo install ImageMagick using Homebrew run this oneliner in your terminal:\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)\"\n\nHomebrew is now installed, it is wise to follow the installer's suggestions after installation. Now we install ImageMagick using brew.\nbrew install imagemagick\n\nImageMagick is now installed and it's convert program can be used for your purpose. To convert a big jpg image to a smaller png image your can run\nconvert input.jpg -geometry 800x600 output.png\n\nTo answer your question \"How to resize all files in a folder and save them in a different folder\" you can run the following script.\n# create output dir\nmkdir -p \"../resized\"\n\n# Convert all .jpg files in the current folder\nfor image in *.jpg; do\n    convert $x -geometry 800x600 resized/$x\ndone\n\nImageMagick can convert over 100 different image formats, and almost all tricks you can do with Photoshop you can do with ImageMagick.\n\nA: I usually import all of the pictures into iPhoto and then export them to the different sizes. I have done it on batches of 300 or so images, but never on the scale you are wanting. Still, it may be an option.\n\nA: No one has mentioned Apple Aperture.\nWhile by no means the cheapest, it comes with a lot of other things that you may find useful. It basically replaces iPhoto and then some. It does 95% of what photographers commonly use Photoshop for. (It won't do flaming text. :-)\nBut unless you need the other things Aperture gives you, I second both the ImageMagick approach -- if you're not intimidated by downloading, installing, and running command-line programs, and the Automator approach, which despite @markhunte's claim, is free.\n\nA: I use wine (and XQuartz) and IrfanView. Of course you could also use imagemagick from the command-line. For wine and imagemagick I would recommend Homebrew.\n\n", "Q: Compressing server into .jar file Currently I'm attempting to compress a decompressed jar file that I have changed into a jar file. How can I do this via the command line? I know that there is a jar command in terminal, I'm just having trouble learning how to compress that folder.\nIf the folder's directory (probably not correct term, but hopefully you get the idea) is /Users/Odinulf/folderone/foldertwo (foldertwo is directory that I want compressed), what would be the exact code to do this?\nThanks in advance,\nOdinulf\n\nA: cd /Users/Odinulf/folderone\njar cvf myjar.jar foldertwo\n\nFor example:\n/Users/ian/code/tmp [ian@Ian-Cs-MacBook-Pro] [19:13]\n> jar cvf myjar.jar 8779 \nadded manifest\nadding: 8779/(in = 0) (out= 0)(stored 0%)\nadding: 8779/.DS_Store(in = 6148) (out= 355)(deflated 94%)\nadding: 8779/logs/(in = 0) (out= 0)(stored 0%)\nadding: 8779/logs/MasterLog.txt(in = 3044043) (out= 207357)(deflated 93%)\nadding: 8779/logs/StartLog.txt(in = 6984480) (out= 685836)(deflated 90%)\n/Users/ian/code/tmp [ian@Ian-Cs-MacBook-Pro] [19:13]\n> ls *.jar\nmyjar.jar\n\nBreaking it down, the options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*c - create a jar file\n\n*v - be verbose when you do it\n\n*f - put the bitstream in to a file instead of standard out\n\n\nThen you give it the file to put the bitstream in to. In this case myjar.jar. And then you give it a list of directories and files to put in to that jar bitstream. Relative and absolute pathing for contents is generally maintained so be careful with that.\n", "Q: What will happen to iChat in Lion once Messages beta expired? Messages will replace iChat on OS X Lion when installed but it will expire at some point in the future.  \nWhat will happen to my Lion's iChat application when Messages expire? Will I be able to use/reinstall iChat again?\n\nA: \n...\nSo there really isn’t a Messages.app. It’s still iChat.app but with some magic causing the Finder to show it as Messages. [...] [T]he magic is in the Bundle name entry in the Info.plist file in /Applications/iChat.app/Contents\n...\nWhy did Apple choose to do it this way? My guess is that Apple wanted Messages to inherit all your old iChat settings so you wouldn’t have to redo everything. Also, because Messages is in beta, Apple wanted you to have an easy way to uninstall Messages and go back to iChat as if you never left. I’m not sure this shallow rebranding was the best way to achieve these goals, but it does seem minimally disruptive.\n...\n\nFor the complete information I will point you to Dr. Drang post that answers this question, and more, about iChat/Messages.\n\nA: In the Messages menu you'll find: Uninstall Messages beta. Choose it and a dialog will ask if you'd like to reinstall iChat. I haven't yet followed through with that but I'm assuming iChat is still stored on the computer somewhere or gets downloaded and installed from Apple's servers.\n\nA: This is pure speculation on my part, the worst kind of Ask Different answer, but it's based on past experience with the Apple ecosystem and supported by the technical answers already provided:\nYou can rest assured that Apple won't leave Lion users who have downloaded the Messages beta without iChat capabilities. The Message client will either be reverted to an iChat client or, more likely in my view, a non-beta Message client will be made available for Lion.\n", "Q: What's a good, actively-developed status-bar-hosted mail client? I currently use Notify, but it has gone out from under active development and there are a few bugs in Lion. Is there something that does an identical or nearly identical thing, but hasn't been abandoned? Free would be preferable.\n\nA: Sparrow is $10 on the MAS and does have a status-bar only option.\n", "Q: Installing Aperture from the App Store when a previous version is installed I have installed Apple Aperture some time ago using a serial (likely pirated) that I searched for on the internet.\nNow, I want to purchase a legal version through the App Store, but it is seeing the prior version as installed. When I try to buy it, the App Store will not let me complete the purchase or download.\nIve tried to completely remove it and reinstall using this tutorial:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/1259711?start=0&tstart=0\nThe steps listed did not work for me and I would appreciate additional steps to help.\n\nA: You will want to drag the following to trash and then quit and re-launch the Mac App Store:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Library/Application Support/ProApps/Aperture System ID\n\n*/Applications/Aperture.app\nIf restarting the app store does not work, a reboot should clear any remnants of the older licensed Aperture product and let you install. Apple support is also very helpful if you need assistance removing an old serial number from a Mac. You don't have to necessarily tell them how you got the old serial number if you feel it may make them or you uncomfortable. I can't imagine a scenario where they wouldn't be delighted to assist you in procuring a legitimate license of the latest version of Aperture.\nYou can also use the mdfind command to search the entire hard drive for files with Aperture in them. Be prepared for a lot of files. I've never heard of people needing to delete all the Aperture directories, but you might also look to move these to trash as well:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Aperture.plist \n~/Library/Caches/Aperture\n~/Library/Application\\ Support/Aperture\n\n", "Q: Grayed-out tracks in iTunes library In my iTunes library there are many tracks that have the cloud with embedded arrow (indicating that I need to download them from the cloud), but which are grayed-out, so that I can't download them, play them, or do anything. Can you tell me what is wrong?\n\nA: You have probably already looked into this, but it sounds like \"iCloud Status\" is enabled in iTunes, but \"iCloud Download\" might not be. Go to\n\nView > View Options \n\nand make sure that \"iCloud Download\" is checked off.\n\nA: Check that \"iCloud Status\" is being included in your current View->View Options, and see what it says for your greyed-out tracks.  For me this shows all my grey songs as \"Waiting\", even though my iCloud Download icon shows the download arrow -- indicating that these songs never uploaded to the iCloud like they should have (for whatever reason), but that iCloud knew they were supposed to.  \nAnd troubleshoot from there...\n", "Q: Adding a new executable to the PATH environment variable? I'm trying to install this library called phantomjs.\nThe instructions include this line:\n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/wiki/BuildInstructions\nFor convenience, copy the executable\n  bin/phantomjs.app/Contents/MacOS/phantomjs to some directory in your\n  PATH.\n\nHow do I do this?\n\nA: While symlinking the file from another directoy works, I prefer to actually copy/move the file to usr/local/bin, to not have it \"twice\".\ncp bin/phantomjs.app/Contents/MacOS/phantomjs /usr/local/bin\n\n\nA: The cleanest way to achieve this would be to symlink the binary in the /usr/local/bin directory (which is included in PATH by default). You might need to create this directory if it doesn't exist yet. You can check to see if these directories are already in your PATH by opening Terminal.app and typing:\necho $PATH\nThis will generate a colon delimited listing of all directories in your PATH.\nIf the directories /usr/local or /usr/local/bin do not exist yet, execute the following:\nsudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin\n\nSymlink the binary, replace (/Applications) with the path to phantomjs.app if it differs:\nsudo ln -s /Applications/phantomjs.app/Contents/MacOS/phantomjs /usr/local/bin\n\nNow you should have no problems executing phantomjs from the command-line.\n\nA: Going back to the root of your issue, if you are installing phantomjs you can use npm to make it easier.\nIf you do then you can just run:\nnpm install -g phantomjs-prebuilt\n\nwhich will install the binary inside of the proper bin directory.\n(the -g flag indicates to npm that the package is to be installed globally)\n\nA: To find out what's in your PATH, open a Terminal window and run this command: echo $PATH . The output is a colon-separated list of directories, the contents of which you can run without specifying the full path.\nSince /usr/bin is in my path, I can run the w command simply by typing w instead of the full /usr/bin/w.\nAlso, you don't have to move the executable into one of the listed PATH directories. Other options include\n\n\n*\n\n*Leave the executable where it is, and symlink to it from one of the PATH directories\n\n*Add a directory to your PATH by explicitly setting it in a login script for your shell\n\n", "Q: DMG mounts but does not auto-open I have a DMG which I downloaded using Safari. When I double click it, the volume mounts but it doesn't open in a new Finder window.\nAny idea why this would happen, and how I can fix the DMG so that it does? (PS - I've created the dmg and hope to distribute it, but it not auto-opening sucks)\n\nA: Here are a few online guides to creating auto-opening DMG files.\nFrom the first guide by Bill Bateman, step 23 seems to be the key:\n\nClick Convert on the toolbar. Enter a new filename and make sure the\n  image format is compressed.  Click Save.  This creates a new image.\n\nAnother guide (via this post) has a bunch of information. The info regarding the auto-open piece is here:\n\nBut we found that the .dmg doesn't always open up its window when\n  mounted. This “autoOpen” utility solves that problem:\n       http://autoopen.nibfile.com/\n\nOne of these two guides should help you set up the auto-opening DMG.\n\nA: The autoOpen feature is a simple flag that needs to be set within the header of the file.\nThe file format details is there:\nhttp://www.dubeyko.com/development/FileSystems/HFSPLUS/hexdumps/hfsplus_volume_header.html\nIt is explained that the offset 0x58 of the \"header\" section should be set to an Int32 representing the ID of the directory that needs to be opened (0 for none, 1 for root's parent, 2 for root, 0xXXXXXXXX for the directory with ID 0xXXXXXXXX).\nAlso don't forget that the header itself is starting at offset 1024 (0x400) so the total offset should be 0x0458.\nIt tested the following command successfully:\nprintf '\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x02' | dd conv=notrunc of=$dmg_file bs=1 seek=$((0x0458))\n\nwhere $dmg_file is your dmg file.\n\nA: It can be much simpler. The DMG will behave just as the folder/volume it was created from. That includes open windows. So if you create the DMG while that window is open, it should automatically open up again when mounting that image. This includes view options, size and position. Keep in mind that other users may have different options set for the various toolbars which may result in a smaller window than you expect. Just make the window a little larger to compensate for that and prevent scroll bars from appearing.\n", "Q: Unflip mouse buttons in Microsoft RDC client I have used an older version of Microsoft RDC client on an old MBP with mouse on the left side of the keyboard. I had flipped the left and right mouse buttons of the mouse in preferences, which made the right button behave as primary mouse button also in remote sessions.\nI synced settings to mobileme from that computer.\nNow on a different computer that has ~/Library synced from mobileme, Microsoft RDC client still has my left and right buttons switched. Even when I'm using a trackpad.\nHow do I set the one finger click of the trackpad as the primary mouse button in RDC?\nI've looked at the RDC client specific settings in ~/Preferences/com.microsoft.rdc.plistand ~/Preferences/com.microsoft.rdc.LSSharedFileList.plist, tried plugging in a mouse and made sure that left and right buttons are not flipped, checked ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/.GlobalPreferences.[yourMACaddress].plist as suggested in a blog post, looked everywhere in RDC client's settings and in connection specific settings, even had a look which files it has open, but with no luck. The one finger tap keeps on acting as the secondary click in RDC sessions.\n\nA: Not sure if this would help but it was a strange find when troubleshooting the below issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut off wireless mouse\n\n*Connect USB mouse\n\n*Check mouse settings to be sure primary button is set to Left, exit settings\n\n*Disconnect USB mouse\n\n*Reconnect wireless mouse\n\n\nIn my situation the user was using a new Magic Mouse and MS RDC 2.0.1.  In MacOS the buttons work correctly but when the user logged into their RDC session the mouse buttons would switch as if it were taking settings from somewhere else.  My theory is that the USB mouse settings had been set to primary button: Right and when you connect the Magic Mouse you can no longer access the same configuration screen but RDC seems to still be using the settings.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Not sure if this is related and still relevant but in case somebody needs it, there is a \"swap mouse button\" in RDP on macOS when you configure a new connection (Edit -> create new connection):\n\nNot showed in the \"preferences pane\" of RDP.\n\nA: I have spent several fruitless hours trying to figure out this problem.  I cannot reproduce the issue with new user accounts that I create, so it seems to be some legacy feature or corrupt configuration not present in the current version.  The mouse is reversed regardless of what the primary assignment in the GlobalPreferences file is.   That seems to be the issue - RDC respected the original change, but not the change back.\nI have two workarounds:  \n\n\n*\n\n*The Microsoft RDC client works fine in other user accounts.  It even worked when I copied my entire ~/Library/Preferences folder.  So theoretically I can copy all my files to another account and make that my new account.  This is crazy because the issue must be somewhere in my profile folder, right?\n\n*iTap mobile RDP is a third party client (€20) which seems better than the Microsoft one.  \nI posted this to the Mac Office support forum.  I'll update this if we figure it out.\n", "Q: iOS administration: Fleet Management / remote setup / remote control **without jailbreak** I have a fleet of more than 10 iOS devices (iPhones 3GS, 4, 4S, iPad2...) to manage, setup, etc.\nOften, users are very lost with configuration and usage (device configuration, e-mail, calendar sync, Apps installation and usage... I even have question like \"How can I send my photo by e-mail?\", or \"How to transfer this PDF?\" sic.).\nI cannot allow me to jailbreak professional devices, so it's a prohibitive constraint.\nI seek a solution to guide them simplest, that in trying to explain to them what to do by phone.\nSo far I have found nothing better than to send them screenshot through IMessage, and it is very laborious.\nMoreover, even with detailed pictures, users make regular errors, which can further complicate the matter!\nSo, if there is a secure and legal way, without jailbreak, to get a remote access, or the possibility (even limited) of a remote setup of an iOS device, it would be an deliverance for me.\nAlthough the ideal would be to take remote control (like VNC or TeamViewer), I'm interested in every little thing, with idea like the ability to send auto-configuration files by iMessage.\nOr anything else to what you might think...\nEven commercial applications, because all of this is very time consuming.\nI almost regret the days of Windows Phone 6.*, which it was possible to send Security Policies and use other corporate tools very helpful in such cases...\nAnyway, thank you in advance for any help you could provide!\n\nA: It's now 2017 so this is much easier than in 2012.\nStart with either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Configurator\n\n*Jamf Now\nBoth are free to start, well documented, capable in the long term. As you get started in what you need, then look to see if perhaps a different single solution or combination of solutions makes sense for your budget, number of devices, and skillset(s).\n\nFor those interested in how it was in 2012 and the next several dozen months, it was a bit harder to manage iOS since the tools and iOS itself didn't have the hooks and maturity for this function. Then, the least expensive way to manage iOS mobile devices is to use the iPhone configuration utility. It is free, runs on Macs and Windows PC and you can email and host the configuration profiles on traditional web and file sharing solutions. I'm amazed it's still called the \"iPhone\" utility since it long ago became the iOS configuration profile utility.\nThe free support method would be FaceTime and iMessages and you can have your users take advantage of Apple's free tutorials, guides and retail worships and training. Past that, some businesses prefer to enroll in Joint Venture for training where your core team can get personalized business level training from Apple.\nThe next level of mobile device management would be Lion Server or one of the pay as you go MDM solutions like Robot Cloud where you can get started with MDM for $5 a month before deciding if your workplace needs the extra features of a full management suite like JAMF Software's Caspar Suite or Mobile Iron type solutions.\nWhether you use profiles made by the Configuration Utility or a server based solution that hooks into Apple's Push Notification Service (APNS) so you can push remote wipe and remote updates to the devices in the field - all of these MDM solutions use the built in iOS management hooks and have various costs and expenses to acquire, learn and automate controlling change to 10 or 10,000 iOS devices. \nStart small, and consider that your users will be highly motivated to learn on their own. You will want to make sure you have open feedback channels and learn from them. iOS deployments generally are less IT headache than many expect and much of the learning and support can be self-paced, on-demand and as needed. Getting iPads into the hands of the decision makers and support people months ahead of a wide scale deployment is critical to remaining nimble and avoiding making decisions before you know how the devices work in your work environment. Small pilot programs are also ideal to measure and adjust deployment when you are unsure how you will ultimately be managing these devices. Hang on, iOS deployment is a fun ride.\n\nA: There are quite a few commercial programs for iOS Mobile Device Management (MDM) (see Vlad's answer for a list of MDM software)\nThe only one that I could find that believe meets all your feature requirements is Soti's MobiControl\nAlong with standard MDM, application and policy management, they provide a Remote Desktop management for mobile devices.\n\nMobiControl equips support personnel with a powerful remote agent view and live two- way chat to optimize help desk interaction. This feature allows remote technicians to monitor and support the MobiControl agent user activity on any iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch devices. Capture remote screen shots and live video recording of the application screens for review and demonstration purposes. For efficient help desk communication to and from end- users, a convenient two-way chat utility offers a real- time exchange of clear text messages in a familiar iOS user interface. Communicate clear instructions and information to end users in seconds without having to spend the time or money to pick up the phone!\n\n\nA: You need to use MDM (Mobile Device Management) to wirelessly configure your fleet of devices. Here's a comparison table for MDM providers.\n\nA: I work for Bomgar.

Dimensions\nThe (unoffical) dimensions which I found are:\n\n*\n\n*9.5mm slot load\n\nSoftware\nThere is free Blu-ray player software available for the Mac and Toast Titanium 11 is able to burn Blu-ray discs.\nAs it turns out, there are only few Blu-ray drives which are compatible (dimension-wise) with a unibody MacBook Pro and the lack of Apple support for this media makes driver support, associated software and other requirements makes reliable information on using a BlueRay drive with OS X and Macs hard to come by.\nQuestion\nHow can I know if a specific internal Blu-ray drives will work when installed in the unibody MacBook Pro? (both specific models you know work with specific OS answers and answers to explain this in general would be of use)\n\nA: The following YouTube video by breakbeet808 confirms that\n\n... It is now possible with the Panasonic/Matshita UJ167 9.5mm slot-loading BD-ROM drive, and/or the UJ-267 BD-Recorder drive, and some extra software: Mac Blu Ray Player from MacGo.\n\nHowever, these blu-ray drives are not a \"100% direct swap out replacement\":\n\nThere is a slight difference with some mounting points on the top side\nof the drive. The problem is solved by swapping the drives' upper\ncasing out. (see \"How to upgrade to the Panasonic/Matshita UJ167 drive\")\n\nOnce you finish the upgrade, OS X will \"recognize blu-ray discs and it will be available to the file system like any other optical disc\".\n\nHow to upgrade to the Panasonic/Matshita UJ167 drive\nThis may void your warranty. Try this at your own risk.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the original superdrive. (You can follow instructions by ifixit, for example.)\n\n*Remove the top metal shell of the drive itself, by removing its four screws. You'll also have to peel off a strip of silver tape that connects the top shell to the bottom shell. This will expose the internal guts of the superdrive. It's this top metal shell that we need to keep, it has the mounting holes in the right spots, so be very careful not to damage it. Do not touch any components inside of the drive. You may want to look up how to do this, it's a little tricky to free it up successfully.\n\n*Now remove the top metal shell of the new blu-ray drive in the same fashion.\n\n*Swap out those top metal shells, and screw the drives back together. The top metal shell from the original superdrive should now\nbe on the new blu-ray drive.\n\n*Now also swap out the small Y shaped mounting bracket from the plug-side of the superdrive and screw it to the new blu-ray drive - those two screw holes do match up exactly already.\n\n*Carefully unplug the flexible data connection cable from the old superdrive and plug it onto the new blu-ray drive.\n\n*Reinstall blu-ray drive.\n\n\n\nA: Edit: Slimline drives are 12.7 mm thick; Super-slimline drives are 9.5 mm thick (these fit in current portable Macs smaller than 17\")\nPhysically these two should fit for slimline dimensions (12.7 mm) - don't know about the software support (I guess it will be difficult to find someone who actually uses an internal Blu-ray drive in a portable Mac):\nTEAK BD-C24SS-A slimline BD combo drive\n\n\n*\n\n*Slot Load «Combo-drive», plays Blu-ray disks (no recoding for Blu-ray), writes DVDs & CDs \n\n\n\n\nSony BD-5850H slimline BD burner\n\n\n*\n\n*Slot Loading Mechanism, Max. 6x BD read, 6x BD write, Max. 8x DVD+/-R read/write, S-ATA interface\n\n\n\nYou would have to remove the plastic bezel/cover (which is normally not too difficult).\n\nA: Wonderful question! I am looking to do the same thing and found it difficult to find the right drive so that the wireless card will fit nicely over the top. So after a little searching, here is a  Panasonic  as well as the  Sony  drive perviously mentioned, these should both fit perfectly (with a little thinning down aka removal of the sony faceplate). So now we have the drive. If you are going to be installing this yourself there is a great walkthrough on drive replacement over at iFixit. Luckily apple got with the standard and any macbook 2009 or later will have a SATA hook-up which fits our replacement blu-ray drives. As far as software goes, the web is an endless source for compatible software. Although, VLC is a great media player that will handle blu-ray playback in keeping with a comfortable GUI.\n\nA: For the software, I have to say you won't be able to play a Blu-Ray drive onto your Mac since their is no decoder for Mac OS X integrated.\nHowever, you can play your Blu-Ray movies by using Windows. And of course, some clever guys did find a work around to play Blu-Ray movies onto your Mac. \nFor the hardware, it seems it's pretty hard to find an internal drive with a 9.5mm hight to fit in your 15\" MacBook Pro. Take a look at this picture with the supported models:\n\nIt seems like Apple, with his eagerness to design the thinnest notebooks, has made it almost impossible to install an internal Blu-Ray drive inside a Unibody MacBook Pro.\nTheir are some with 12,5mm in height, but they will only fit in a 17\" MacBook Pro. And since you mentionned the height of 9.5mm, I assume it's a 15\" MacBook Pro you're talking about. \nSo in my opinion, it's not possible to fit an internal Blu-Ray drive into a 15\" MacBook Pro Unibody. It's like Steve Jobs said once, Blu-Ray is a bag of hurt (to implement it in a Mac).\nI think you should look out for an external one. I would recommend one with maximum versatility, one with Firewire, USB, and eSATA connectivity.\n\nA: A quick look at OWC doesn't show any internal BR drives for portable Macs, only in 5.25\" format.  CDW only shows a single model internal BR drive, and I doubt it would work well in anything other than its intended laptop.\nSo I don't think a compatible product exists.\nThat said, I have a LaCie BR external drive that I occasionally use with my MBP 15\" as well as other Macs around my office (including file servers).  It's not an internal, but its small, fast, and reliable.\n\nA: I did not test it, but this one should be right.

Is there any application that can be installed in OS X (Lion) that will allow a person to run applications from the host system on a guest system, displaying only the windows for the application? In other words, can Cocoa applications display their windows on another OS X Desktop than the machine on which they are running?\nX11 allows you to run an application remotely without sharing the whole Desktop.\nI am currently using VNC (Screen Sharing), but because of screen resolution differences, it isn't ideal.\n\nA: Short answer is no. \nCocoa is not designed as a remote procedure call (RPC)-esque protocol, while X is. You cannot tunnel the interfaces of Cocoa applications like you know it from X11 natively, only using protocols like VNC that transfer the actual bitmap rather than the rendering instructions.\nOn the other hand, you are able to use remotely running X applications via SSH.\n\nA: Asking myself a similar question, I've found iRapp and \"AquaConnect\" seem to offer remote applications served from a OSX device, which is great.

The only way to operate is to plug the computer in My battery says 0% charge, there is no x over my battery icon. The MacBook runs fine on corded power but dies as soon as I unplug.  What could be the problem?\n\nA: Is your MacBook a plastic one made before 2008? Did you buy a new charger for it at some point after 2008? If so, the issue could be an outdated System Management Controller (SMC).\nFor some reason, the SMC's in the pre-'08 MacBooks will not allow charging via a Magsafe cable made after 2008. It will run off of it, but it will not charge.\nFortunately, Apple has a patch. Download the SMC firmware updated located here, and your MacBook should start charging from the newer charger.\n\nA: This can be one of two things.\n\n\n*\n\n*Battery\n\n\nYour battery could be dead. Check this by going to the system profiler and click on power, this will give you information on the health of your battery, and how many charge cycles it has done. Take a look at the 'Full Charge Capacity' if this is below 1,000 then there is a problem, if teh battery doesn't charge at all the value is likely to be at 0.

I don't have a Mac or Exchange (which seem to be two ways of doing this.)\nWhen I open the iPad Gmail app (from Google) there are no Contacts and the email \"to\" field doesn't autocomplete. I effectively can't email unless I've memorized the email address.\nI don't want to sync 1000 contacts. I just want to see a contacts link like I do when I use gmail on a computer. It couldn't get much simpler than that. \n\nA: I don't know why everyone seems to over complicate this, you don't need to export contacts and import them somewhere else nor do you need exchange. Steps to sync contacts with your iDevice are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug your device into your computer and open iTunes\n\n*Select your device in iTunes and click the \"info\" tab\n\n*Check \"Sync Contacts\" and then \"Sync Google contacts\"\n\n*Enter your google login info\n\n\nDone! Contacts will sync with gmail.\n\nA: Here is how to export your Gmail contacts to your iPad Contacts list, so they will autofill when using the Mail app.\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to your contacts page and choose \"Export…\" under the More menu.\n\n*Choose All Contacts, and use the vCard format.\n\n*Open the downloaded file.\n\n*When Address Book asks if you're sure you want to import them, choose yes, and quit Address Book when it's done.\n\n*Select your iPad in iTunes and navigate to the Info tab.\n\n*Turn on Sync Address Book Contacts if it isn't already, and customize the settings how you like.\n\n*Sync your iPad with iTunes.\n\n\nDone! I did notice from your question, though, that you're using the Gmail app. This fix will only work if you use Mail.app; for more information regarding setting that up, see this Apple help article.\nAlso: if you're running Windows, replace steps 3 and 4 with the instructions on this page.\n\nA: You don't need to have Exchange. \n\nYou have to add an Exchange Account in the Mail-Settings with your GoogleAddress and password.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Add an Exchange Account\n\n*Username is   usernamen@googlemail.com, password is password, Server is: m.google.com and Domain is empty\n\n*Now you can sync your Contacts and Addresses to the iPad, too.\n\n\n\nYour GMail App takes the contacts from the address book, and the\n  address book gets its contacts now from Google.\n\n\nA: I had the same problem and didn't want to sync the contacts since its a shared ipad.  If you just need an occasional contact, you can access your contacts directly via this link:\nhttps://www.google.com/contacts/#contacts\n\nA: I figured a way around it. To recap, even if you sync your google contacts on iphone, if you create a new contact on your phone or even receive a new email and want to add them as a new contact, you cannot. It won’t recognize the new email address in autofill in the “to” field because it is not yet added to gmail contacts. If you are using gmail app you cannot add new contacts. Instead, what I did is go to https://www.google.com/contacts/#contacts\nand copy new contact from your phone or from the new received email and add to your google contacts. To make things easier each time, you can save this page to your safari favourites. Just press the share button at the bottom (when you are changing tabs) and press add to favourites. Now every time you open a new tab you can instantly access google contacts to manually add new contacts. I went back to check and lo and behold it pops up in the autofill in the “to” field.

I've read instructions about connecting a MacBook Air to a VGA monitor but I can't translate it to my situation. At present the monitor is connected to a pc running Joli OS.\n\nA: It depends on which version of the Mac Mini you have. According to this Apple Support KB article, older Mac Minis can connect with a normal DVI port, which you can buy a DVI-VGA adapter for.\nWhile the generation after that offered Mini DVI and Mini DisplayPort outputs, both of which can be adapted to VGA output. \nThen immediatly after that there was a generation that offered HDMI and Mini DisplayPort output options, only the Mini DisplayPort could be adapted to VGA output.\nThe current Mac Mini uses HDMI or Thunderbolt(which is compatible with Mini DisplayPort) for output. Only the Mini DisplayPort / Thunderbolt output can be adpated to VGA output \nWhy no VGA on HDMI that is found here KB article:\n\nCan the HDMI port drive analog displays (VGA displays for example)\n  using adapters?\nNo.  The HDMI port will drive digital connections—such as DVI—using\n  the adapter that came with the Mac mini, but cannot be used for analog\n  displays such as VGA. You can purchase a Mini DisplayPort to VGA\n  adapter separately to drive analog displays.\n\nFor Mac Minis with the Thunderbolt or Mini DisplayPort, the Mini DisplayPort to VGA\nadapter would be the same as that used by MacBooks.\nThird party adapters are also be available and at a lower price usually. A good low price source for compatible cables and adapters is MonoPrice.com \n\nA: There is a solution to have both computers hooked up to the one display and that is getting a KVM . In your described situation a 2 port  USB-VGA-KVM  would allow you to share your keyboard, mouse and display between your Mac Mini and your PC.\nAdditionally you would need to obtain the necessary VGA adapters for your Mac Mini as mentioned in JWO1's answer as well.\n", "Q: How can I boost the performance of my MacBook? I know that upgrading my MacBook with extra RAM can help boost the general system performance.\nRecently, I upgraded from OS X 10.5  to OS X 10.6.8. I thought that my RAM upgrade would speed up my MacBook, but it didn't.\nWhat measures can I take to boost the performance of my MacBook?\n\nA: Upgrade your HDD with a SSD\nThe hard drive is a common bottleneck in computing these days. This is due to the fact, that processors have become faster at computing. The hard drive cannot keep up with the CPU. Because it's slow, the CPU is not stressed as much as it could be: bottleneck effect.\nSee these videos for a comparsion of a SDD to a HDD in a Macbook Pro.\nUpgrade RAM\nIf your amount of RAM is insufficient, you will see lots of page-outs. Data which should be written to the RAM will be written to the hard drive instead. Because the hard drive's input/output operations are much slower than the RAM's, this slows down your computer.\nHowever, if your amount of RAM is sufficient already, you will not notice a benefit from a RAM upgrade.\nYou can check how much page-outs there are using the Activity Monitor.app which is located in /Applications/Utilities/. There are no official recommendations I know of as to what the ratio of page-ins to page-outs should be. Generally, you need to know that the more page-outs you have, the better your system could perform if you were to upgrade your RAM. I myself aim for a ratio of no more than 5 to 1 (20%, page-in vs page-out)\nActivity Monitor → System Memory:\n\nClean install\nIf you installed the upgrade 'over the top' this will be like a 'software factory reset'. Mostly you'll notice a better performance because no other software has been installed yet.\nStill, a clean install helps in removing remains of uninstalled software but should be an ultimate measure for tackling problems that do not want to be solved otherwise.\n\nA: When my 2007 MBP (also running 10.6.8) seems sluggish I check CPU usage in Activity Monitor. Typically it's a runaway flash process in Safari or Chrome. Find the offending page, close it, and the machine gets snappy again.\nMore ram really is a good idea though. I just put 6G in my laptop for $100. \n\nA: Here are some things you can do to pep things up without buying more hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*Repair your disk permissions using the Disk Utility. I try to do this monthly.\n\n*Check for start-up items that you do not need. See the blog post below for some tips on this.\n\n*When the Spotlight indexer is running it can make your computer sluggish. In System Preferences-> Spotlight (on the Privacy tab), you can tell the indexer to ignore directories-- I ignore most (I also do this in TimeMachine).\n\n*There is a nice little utility in the AppStore that allows you to FreeMemory on demand from the menu-bar. I am sure there are other similar utilities out there.\n\n\nHere is a nice blog-post with some more tips: http://www.kaisblog.de/2010/02/03/speed-up-your-mac/ However, use caution and make sure you have a good backup before you poke around the Terminal. His tips increased my boot times by half and I had services running that I thought I had deleted a long time ago.\n", "Q: How can I pair my Magic Trackpad with multiple Macs? I have a Magic Trackpad that I'm using with my iMac.\nEverything works great, but I would also like to use the trackpad with my MacBook.\nFor some reason, it seems that I can only pair the trackpad with one computer at a time.\nWith the iMac turned off, I turned on the MacBook and went to set up a new Bluetooth device. The trackpad was not found.\nI know that nothing is wrong with my connection procedure (I pressed the power button, it was within range, etc), and that nothing is wrong with the trackpad itself (it works fine with the iMac).\nI finally got the trackpad to pair with the MacBook by unpairing it with the iMac, turning the iMac off, and power cycling the trackpad.\nThen, when I went to re-pair with the iMac, the device was not found (the MacBook was completely off; it was not connected to anything). Only by unpairing with the MacBook and power cycling was I able to re-pair with the iMac.\nSo, I think the trackpad is trying to tell me that it can only be paired with one computer at a time.\nI would like to pair the trackpad with both my iMac and my MacBook not for simultaneous use, but for using with one when the other is turned off or far away.\nI have other Bluetooth devices that let me do this just fine, and I can't think of a reason why it would be different for the trackpad.\nHow can I pair my Magic Trackpad with both my iMac and MacBook for non-simultaneous use?\nIdeally without any third-party software.\n\nA: No, it can only be paired to one computer at at time according to Magic Trackpad Manual. You would need to un pair and then re pair it to another computer in order to use it on both computers.\nHere's the extract from the manual: \n\nAfter you pair your Apple Magic Trackpad with a Mac, you can pair it again with a different Mac. To do this, you first remove the existing pairing and then pair the trackpad again.\n\n\nA: What about considering http://synergy-foss.org - an open source tool for sharing mouse and keyboard between multiple machines on one desk?\nSupport for Maverics is not ready yet :-( but it seems to be coming soon.\n\nA: Keep it simple folks.   It can only be paired with one Mac at a time.\nSimply make sure you have the \"Show Bluetooth in menu bar\" Ticked on in your Bluetooth preferences on both machines.\nThen simply left click the icon in the task bar (its normally between the sound and wireless icons) then pull the mouse pointer down to the keyboard in question and click 'Disconnect'\nHead back to the mac your using and do the same choosing 'Connect'\nAs long as the keyboard is already paired with each device its as simple as deciding which computer you want to use :)   Job done\nWhen you do get around to getting more than one Keyboard be sure to rename them differently add a number or simply add mac mini/ iMac etc..so you know which is which. If you move them much I suggest marking the keyboards underneath also....sigh\nEDIT (extra info's)\nOk, battery condition, or simply your Mac's inbuilt cussedness can make pairing frustrating at times, turning your device off and back on again is often the preferred method with reluctant bluetooth devices (remove and replace batteries to be absolutely sure)...on my keyboards I often tap the caps lock to see if the light comes on after I have supposedly turned it off. But, more often than not, the main problem with pairing your bluetooth device will be that it has paired itself to another of your devices (my iPhone is often the culprit as I paired one of my keyboards to it ages ago) Once paired you can then turn bluetooth back on on any other machines or devices you wish (shutting down your connected device may however cause reconnection problems on boot up... so it may be easier to 'remove' the keyboard, or other problem BT device from the machine,iPhone,iPad, or tablet in its bluetooth preferences[ie:\"forget this device\"]) It really is much easier to have each computer with its own personal keyboard/trackpad.\nOne last tip I can share for those of us who run multiple machines is to simply 'share screen' to the computer you mostly use. I currently run as my main machine a 27\"iMac, but I also have a Mac mini as my main media device(has iTunes and is in charge of all updates,charging etc)And an old Mac Pro just cos I love it... and its still damn quick! so... just allow screen sharing from the other machines to the one you sit in front of the most and your mouse/trackpad and keyboard will give you full control as soon as you can see it in finder. Simply select the machine (Mac mini most often in my case) and you will see in the top right corner of the finder window a 'share screen' and a 'connect to' button. I choose 'share screen' and I can control, modify or use my Mac mini directly from my iMac screen.\n\nA: If you're willing to use the Magic Trackpad 2 with cabling instead of wireless with bluetooth, just changing which computer it's plugged into will quickly change the connection. If you're already using some sort of wired docking station, then this is even easier.\nAt the time this question was asked, the Trackpad used replaceable AA batteries only. Now that it's rechargable over USB, using wired mode fully is also an option.\n\nA: The simplest solution I found is to have the lightning cable ( that comes with the trackpad to charge) in both the devices. Have it paired in both the devices already.\nnow when switching to another device, just plug in the cable and disconnect, it will automatically connect to that machine.\n\nA: According to this answer, Magic Track Pads can be paired with multiple devices, just not, as you stated, at the same time.\nAs long as the track pad is not connected with another device, it will be pairable with an additional one. The trick is to make sure that it's not connected to the other device, since it will connect with the first paired device it sees.\nIf your machines in question are more than 33 feet apart (the range of bluetooth), you should be fine, but it never hurts to turn devices off when not using them and in-between pairings, just to be safe.\n\nA: FYI, After answering another question similar to yours specifically How can I operate 2 XServes and 2 iMacs from 1 keyboard and 1 mouse (both bluetooth)?, I think I may have found a way to let you share your Magic Track Pad between two Macs thanks to Jagra's question. Here is a solution to try.\n\nActually, it looks like this may work, as note here Share your Magic Mouse between 2 Macs. This should be able to be extended to where both the keyboard and the mouse are Bluetooth and replacing the KVM with a USB switch.\n\n\n\n\nFor the setup we used the following hardware:\n    1 mac mini (running 24/7 as a home server)\n    1 Mac Pro (it’s a hackintosh inside a Mac Pro case)\n    1 Apple USB Keyboard and 1 dual-link DVI Monitor\n    1 Apple Magic Mouse (Bluetooth)\n    1 Belkin Flip KVM Switch (DVI-D 2-Port)\n    1 small Bluetooth 2.0 USB dongle\n\n\n\nAlso I am currently trying to confirm how this works with the following question With a USB bluetooth adapter does the devices pair with the dongle or the computer? My guess that it is paring with some kind of unique Identifier in the USB Bluetooth dongle's hardware.\n\nA: Simply remove the trackpad batteries for 20 seconds, put them back on and re-pair.\n\nA: One issue I was having was that sometimes even though one computer was closed, it was still connected so the keyboard and trackpad wouldn't be available for pairing on the destination computer. It was also annoying to have to pair each time.\nI ended up using Sleeepwatcher to run an Applescript that turns off Bluetooth when the computer goes to sleep or turns on Bluetooth when the computer wakes. The AppleScript varies by macOS version, check out https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19752438/applescript-to-toggle-bluetooth for some variations.\n\nA: connect track pad to a usb switcher. and connect the usb sticher to your two computers.\n", "Q: Why does \"Chromium Helper EH\" crash when I try to launch Chromium?

I just discovered a \"stuck pixel\" which shines red when it's supposed to be black.\nI can't find any pixel policy on the web page. Do they have such policy? Does anyone have any experience from trying to return / change the product?\n(Bought it in Sweden if it matters.)\n\nA: Your Macbook comes with a worldwide one year limited warranty.\n\nApple [...] warrants this Apple-branded hardware product against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use for a period of ONE (1) YEAR from the date of retail purchase by the original end-user purchaser (“Warranty Period”). If a hardware defect arises and a valid claim is received within the Warranty Period, at its option, Apple will either...\n\n*\n\n*repair the hardware defect at no charge, using new or refurbished replacement parts, or\n\n*exchange the product with a product that is new or which has been manufactured from new or serviceable used parts and is at least functionally equivalent to the original product, or\n\n*refund the purchase price of the product.\n\n\nSee to your preferred Apple-Certified-Reseller with your Macbook and state your claim. You should be proposed a fix at not cost if the defect is due to bad material or workmanship under normal use.\n\nA: What I can tell you from personal experience in working at the Genius Bar is that there is actually a minimum number of pixels that have to have issues in order for them to replace the display. If memory serves, it's 3 or 4 for a 13\" machine. However, if you're within 30-90 days of purchase, they will probably make an exception, especially if you mention that it's only 30-90 days old. \nAlternatively, if you want to avoid going through Apple you can try running the Flurry screen saver overnight.

Speaking from direct experience, Apple can be\nfar more generous than this support document suggests. Case in point;\nI purchased a MacBook Pro 13″ earlier in the year and discovered a\nsingle dead pixel glowing bright red smack in the center of the\nscreen, you couldn’t miss it. I took the Mac back to the Apple Store\nand an Apple Genius swapped the machine out immediately, saying he\nwanted to be sure I was happy with my purchase. The new MacBook Pro’s\nscreen was flawless, and yes, I was happy.\nMy advice to anyone who is dissatisfied with either a dead or stuck\npixel is to talk to Apple, at the end of the day customer service\nseems to always win out over official policy.\n\nYour best bet is to bring in your machine to be checked out - it's quite likely that the Apple Genius that you're working with will do his/her best to make you a happy customer.\n", "Q: How can I use an iTunes smart playlist to find and delete audio files? I just imported 300 AIFF files into iTunes in order to easily convert them to AAC. That part is done, and now I want to delete the AIFF files. I know how to do this from Terminal, but I'd like to find the best way to do this from iTunes.\nI created a smart playlist with these rules:\n\n\n*\n\n*date added is 2/24/2012\n\n*kind begins with \"AIFF\"\n\n\nThis smart playlist contains all 300 AIFF files that I want to delete, as expected. But when I select the files in this playlist, the Edit > Delete menu item is disabled, and the context menu does not display any menu items related to deleting or trashing the files. If I go to the smart playlist, select all the files, then change the source list selection to the entire Music library, the selection is lost.\nSince my iTunes library only contains these 600 files, I could do the manual step of showing the Kind field in the list, sorting by kind, and selecting the 300 AIFF files. But I was hoping to be able to do this from the smart playlist. Does anyone know how to do this?

(You can configure this in the Keyboard preference pane.)\nSo whenever you need to use the ⌥ key to navigate, you can punch the three keys, do your navigating, punch them again, and be back in Unicode mode (if you only have two input sources; otherwise you'll cycle through them.)\n\nA: Downlolad Ukelele and copy System Keyboards/Unicode/Unicode Hex Input.keylayout from the disk image to /Library/Keyboard Layouts/.

One of the most annoying things about working on my Mac is when I am using an open file dialog from any application. For some reason beyond me it shows all the files that are invalid to open greyed out. Then any files that are of the correct kind, or folders, are in black, and mixed in. Of course I can sort by kind, but it still doesn't make any sense to have to wade through all the files I cannot open. I could kind of understand it if I could force it to open one of these other files, but I cannot even select them.\nIs there a way to tell the open dialog to only show me folders and valid files to open? \n\nA: Spoke to the Apple Geniuses today. They said it wasn't possible. Best I could come up with was to group the files by type. \n", "Q: Is there a way to circumvent the 20MB file limit on iOS without jailbreaking? I travel often enough that I decided to activate tethering through AT&T. I'm not on unlimited data, but I do have a fairly high limit now (tethering comes with more bandwidth) I am often downloading new podcast episodes over 3G, but find I am still limited by the 20MB file limit. So I have to tether to my Mac Book Pro to download the podcast (over the iPhone), and then sync it to my iPhone.\nI guess the reason for the 20MB limit was when AT&T offered unlimited data, but now it is just annoying as it requires me to take an extra step to download the same 20MB file over the same 3G network.\nShort of having another iPhone and tethering them together, is there a way I can download a file over 20MB directly to my iPhone? I'd prefer not to jailbreak it, but I guess I am not completely opposed to it if that is my only solution.\n\nA: This is a limit imposed by Apple. \n\nCellular downloads are limited to a file size of 20 MB or smaller.\n\nSee comment below, iOS 5.1 has increased this limit to 50 MB.\n\nA: A practical solution to your stated problem would be to use Instacast as a podcast manager. You can download large episodes using 3G.

I recently installed a SSD on my Early 2009 Mac Pro. While searching the site, and finding many questions on the subject of SSD to HDD swapping, linking, and cloning. No one actually mentioned the folders that would be best to link.\nI have symlinked /Users/user and /Libray on SSD to HDD, but feel like I might be missing one. Also, I noticed that this also saves most of my app settings, as Dropbox was able to simply startup without any configurations. Would this also be the case for mail, since I linked the whole /Library folder?\nCurrently I have Lion, and the Apps folder on the SSD. My goal is to have the data hogs linked from HDD to SSD. Would it be better to hard link them versus symlink?\nEdit: I am running my OS on SSD, and want to symlink to folders from OS on old HDD. Which are the best candidates?\n\nA: For my Hackintosh SSD-HHD \"separation\" purposes, I moved my /Users directory to be mounted directly on my (spinning) HDD partition.  Details here.\nI view symlinking /Users to be generally risky for MacOS.\nHaven't yet moved my /Library mount; not certain merit of doing that (eg: hard to gauge /Library disk activity).  Would be great if someone could detail the default system log paths for MacOS (I'm running Lion) to help sort this out.\nIn any case, my /Users dir definitely gets hammered with lots of write IO + storage capacity (both things not optimal for Flash-memory-based storage), so definitely moved that off.\n", "Q: How to force include files in Time Machine I'd like to force-include some files in Time Machine.

Everything is just grabbed from Time Machine which gets automatically updated, for free.\n\n\nAll this works pretty well :) …that is until some Aperture or OS update started excluding the folders above for Aperture.\n\nA: $sudo tmutil removeexclusion <file name>\n\n\nA: Open Terminal.app, type \"cd \" (Take care of the space after the cd) and drag your Aperture library in that window, then hit return. Now type\nxattr -d com.apple.metadata:com_apple_backup_excludeItem \"iPod Photo Cache\"\nxattr -d com.apple.metadata:com_apple_backup_excludeItem \"Thumbnails\"\n\nHit return again and do a backup. \n", "Q: iWork '09 Numbers: How to set the default language of the document I would like to set the default language of a Numbers document. I figured out how to do it for a Pages document:\nHow Do I Set the Default Language in Pages?\nbut I cannot find the corresponding inspector tab in Numbers.\nHow can I set the default language of the Numbers document to e.g. German? The OS and other programs should remain in English, however.\n\nA: According to what you've done in Pages, I assume that you want to change the language of the document cells in numbers.  What you did in Pages changed the language of the document, not the application.\nChanging the language of document cells\nEdit > Spelling > Spelling...\n\nChanging the language of the applications\nThis is not possible from within pages. As of iWork '09 the used language follows the set language defined under System Preferences → Language & Text.\nHowever, you can start applications in a custom language via Language Switcher (works in Lion). But even with this tool you cannot set the language in which an applications starts permanently. You have to start it via Language Switcher every time.\n\n", "Q: Remove link to something that is not a folder in the Finder sidebar Somehow I managed to have a link to a document in my Finder sidebar (Mac OS X Snow Leopard, 10.6). It does show up under my “Places” category on the left. I can move it around and it sticks where I put it, but I can’t remove it from the sidebar.\nIf I perform a right click on it, the only option it gives me is “Open Sidebar Preferences...”, while that menu on a folder also gives me the option to remove it from the sidebar. I can not simply pull it away using drag and drop. It can not be focused, so I can’t even hit Cmd+Backspace or Fn+Backspace (for Del).\nAny ideas? I want to remove it from the Sidebar and I guess I need to tweak some properties file. What to do?\n\nA: This behavior got changed with the 10.6.7 update - apparently to avoid accidental deletion from the sidebar. Now the behavior is consistent with removing system icons from the menubar.\nHold the ⌘-key while dragging the icon away from the sidebar to remove it.\n", "Q: Lion won't start after EFI update I installed the new EFI update for my MBA Mid 2011 (the software updater said it is recomended). The update went fine and restarted the mac afterwards.\nThen while booting the apple logo turns into a grey forbidden sign and nothing happens from there. I turned the mac off and tried again. Same thing.\nThen I booted the recovery partition and tried to repair my disk. It says that it can't repair the disk because it is corrupted.\nAn ideas but erasing the disk?\n\nA: The only thing that may work for you is this (although, I wouldn't get your hopes up):\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Start your computer and hold the ⌘ + S keys to get into Single User mode.\n  \n*Once you're in Single User mode, type in unmount -uw / and press enter.\n  \n*Now, type in fsck -fy and press enter. It should go through several stages of checking and repairing the file system. \nIt will most likely give you an error stating that it cannot be\n  completed for some reason, but it's worth a shot.\n\nAlternatively, if the issue is isolated to the file structure, you can try doing a reinstall of Mac OS X from the recovery partition. Doing just a reinstall should not erase any of your data. \nHowever, you may want to try to back up your computer first. The only way that I can think of to do this on a MacBook Air 2011 is to use Thunderbolt target disk mode. This will require that you have access to another Thunderbolt equipped Mac as well as a Thunderbolt cable. \nIf you don't, I'd take a trip to the Genius Bar at your nearest Apple Store. They'll have the extra Mac and equipment necessary to do this. If they/you decide to do this while you wait at the Genius Bar, expect to be there for a couple hours just in case. If they/you decide to leave it with the Geniuses, there is a $99 data transfer fee that they'll most likely charge you.\nThe only other option is to: \n\n  \n*\n  \n*Boot your Mac to the recovery partition\n  \n*Open Disk Utility from the Utilities menu\n  \n*Follow these steps to erase your SSD\n  \n*Reinstall Lion on your MacBook Air\n\n\nA: I had the exact same problem and the latest version of Alsoft's Diskwarrior fixed the problem and now all seems good. hopefully it will work for you as well.\n\nA: \nSymptoms\nInstead of seeing the Finder or the login window after startup, your computer may stop responding and the display may only show a persistent gray screen (you may also see an Apple logo, spinning gear, spinning globe, prohibitory sign, or a folder with a flashing question mark on it).\n\nYou were confronted with the prohibitory sign.\nApple hosts an official support website which has troubleshooting guidelines.\nAs the troubleshooting tips are quite long and detailed, I will not copy them here. Please see the link instead and follow the described steps.\n\nA: If it is a corrupt partition table then you can use TestDisk, the site has information on the utility. Also you might find these instructions useful.\nFor the above, you need another machine to use the utility and boot your Mac into target mode then connect it to the machine which the utility is installed in. Or you can start from an external drive which has an OS installed and you can install the TestDisk onto it.\nI would use another machine to backup the drive in its raw format before I start the procedure. You can do that using the dd command. This also requires another machine (dd is a *nix command). Check the manpage of dd or check one of these links for usage of dd. I am putting links because I don't know what kind of setup you will have before hand (i.e. linux, mac, *BSD, etc). You can also connect and mount an external drive on the corrupt machine and use the dd command to backup the corrupt drive to the attached external drive.\nI hope the above is helpful. Good luck.\n", "Q: Accessing 3rd party app files in iCloud from Windows Very closely related to this question: Are files saved to iCloud via 3rd party applications accessible from icloud.com web interface through browser?\nIs there any way to access files stored by 3rd party apps in iCloud from a  Windows PC? \nIn my specific case, I use IAWriter on the iPad, and love the automatic syncing feature it providers through iCloud. However, I can't seem to be able to access the synchronized files anywhere else - at least not through the web interface.\nIs there any way to do this?\n\nA: I don't think one is able to access 3rd party app data via www.iCloud.com. You may have a couple options despite that, the first being to get a Mac. Honestly, that's probably not very practical for you. Otherwise, IAWriter, may have a way to log into your account there and access files - a feature not uncommon with apps like that. If neither of those options work, then you will probably have to wait until they put out an app for Windows (which may not be very high on their list if it is on it at all.\n", "Q: How to launch a file in vifm I installed vifm through macports.\nIf I press enter on a file, it just opens it for editing.\nHow can I launch a file with it's associated program?\ni.e. if I have a file highlighted, is there a key I can press so that it does the same thing as \nopen %c\n\nWhere %c is the name of the file that's highlighted?\n\nA: I almost accidentally saw this question and decided to provide an answer in case you're still didn't find one in the documentation.\nTo open files with associated programs you need to add the following command to your ~/.vifm/vifmrc file:\nfiletype * open %c\n\nThen both l and i keys will work for you as expected. See help on :filetype and :filextype in the documentation.\nThis doesn't work out of the box, since different systems have different open commands and the default behavior is to open all files with Vim (for example, xdg-open for Ubuntu 16.04, as opposed to the aforementioned \"open\", which is specific to Mac). Maybe new version will contain a set of open commands for different systems in sample vifmrc file, so it will work from the beginning.\n\nA: Using i will open the selected file with its associated program. This is per the online documentation from the Vifm site. I am not sure how or if you can alter which application opens a file from within vi; that might have to be switched elsewhere. \n", "Q: General purpose video editing software I am writing an assignment about basic video editing software, and I need to mention video editing software that is Mac OS X compatible.\nAs a Linux user, I personally don't have access to a computer running Mac OS X and have never used one. I would therefore like to know what software comes pre-installed on Mac OS X (I'm not sure if this may vary for each release, but say for the 3 latest releases (10.6 - 10.8)), as well as the most used paid / free software available.\nI'm not interested in every available application, but only the most commonly used for basic purposes.\n\nA: Like Ian C. mentioned, Quicktime is the only thing pre-installed. You can do the basics: rotate, scale, and merge clips.\n\niMovie is the consumer standard. It comes with the iLife suite. It has an easy to use interface and can create some pretty fancy and professional looking videos. The current version has a tool to make trailers for home movies, includes great control over the audio, has facial recognition, and supports the AVCHD format.\n\nFinal Cut Pro X is the prosumer application for video editing. It is the successor to Final Cut Express 4 and Final Cut Pro 7. It, like iMovie, is a paid application. It has a important feature which is not in iMovie: multicam editing. Final Cut Pro X allows you to overlay multiple video tracks, then edit them simultaneously. It also is a 64-bit application.\n\n\nA: Pre-installed? QuickTime is really the only thing pre-installed. You can rotate and merge video clips with it, but not much else.\nYou can buy, for very little money, the iLife pack of applications. You'll find that it's pretty common for Mac owners to buy this one. This bundle comes with iMovie and that's the entry-level video editing application most Mac users know.\n\nA: Just to note that iMovie can be considered to be a pre-installed App when you buy a Mac, it is merely not included with OS upgrade disks.\n\nA: There's also avidemux for Mac OS X.\n\nA: Apple iMovie is the best for Mac\n", "Q: Best way to switch the signed-in iTunes Store account on an iPhone without affecting apps I have an iPhone 4S that uses account \"B\" for iCloud and account \"A\" for iTunes.\nI also have an iTunes installation (on a Windows 7 machine) that is authorized for account A.\nI have many apps installed and configured on the iPhone, several of them cost money.\nI now wish to switch over to using only iTunes account B on both the iPhone and the iTunes installation.\nWhat is the smoothest way to do this?\nI am worried about several aspects, mainly apps:\nWhat will happen to the apps? Will they be erased? Will they keep their settings?\nI am not looking to avoid paying, I am fully prepared to pay (on account B) for the apps that cost money. Should I do that on the PC before switching accounts on the iPhone? \nDo I have to do anything about the free apps? Will all apps keep updating after switching account?\nThe FAQs I've read about this action state that it is possible, but not really what will happen to apps and settings:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1311#\n\nA: If you switch your iTunes account on the phone from account A to account B all your apps from account A will still exist on your phone and will function properly.\nThe only issue you will face will be with updates. Every time an update wil exist for one of the apps in account A, you will get the numbered badge on the app store app. However, you will not see the update in the app store itself until you switch accounts back from account B to account A.\n\nA: To completely switch over to your Account B and ensure that it all goes smoothly, I would suggest that you redownload (and repurchase) all your apps via account B. As you backed up your account to the Account B iCloud, you will easily be able to restore your app data by restoring it from there. \nFirst, backup everything. Then reset your iPhone by deleting all content and settings and while setting up your iPhone, choose to restore from your iCloud backup. All you apps will be downloaded automatically in the order on your screen. \nHere is a simple guide: Link\nFrom Apple's knowledgebase :\n\nBacked-up information includes purchased music, TV shows, apps, and\n  books*; photos and video in the Camera Roll; device settings (for\n  example, Phone Favorites, Wallpaper, and Mail, Contacts, Calendar\n  accounts); app data; Home screen and app organization; Messages\n  (iMessage, SMS, and MMS), ringtones, and more.

I have added a symbolic link from: /usr/local/bin/bash to /usr/local/Cellar/bash/4.2.20/bin/bash and added the line: /usr/local/bin/bash to /etc/shells\nWhen I load my terminal I am still getting the older version of bash, also when i execute the command: /etc/local/Cellar/bash/4.2.20/bin/bash my prompt changes to bash-4.2$ but when i do bash --version it still says I am in version 3.2. Does anyone know what step I am missing?\n\nA: You'll need to change your account's login shell from System Preferences, Users & Groups. You need to access the Advanced Options by right-clicking on your username and changing your shell to /usr/local/bin/bash. Once you've done that, restart Terminal.app (to make sure no old sessions with the wrong shell are left hanging around) and you should be set.\n\nYou can do the same using dscl:\ndscl . -change /Users/<username> UserShell /usr/local/bin/bash\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to change the order of previous recipients in Apple mail? John Doe is someone I email often.  John Dee is someone I emailed recently and will probably email again, but not nearly as often.  I don't want to remove John Dee from my previous recipients, but I want John Doe to come up first again for quick compleion.  (I'm sure that otherwise I'm going to accidentally send John some mail meant for John.)  I can't find any way to reorder entries in the Previous Recipients window.  Is there any way to make Doe come up first again?\nI tried adding Doe but not Dee to my Address Book, but that didn't help.\n\nA: You can type Doe instead of John in the address fields (To, Cc, Bcc, Reply-To) when composing an email message.\n", "Q: Can I reverse the iPhone 4s scroll to top in Safari I just figured out the scroll to top thing on my iPhone which if you accidentally hit it in a long article makes your life rather miserable trying to find out where you were. Is there some way for me to undo it?\n\nA: This is baked into iOS and works in most iOS apps that have long text fields. There's no way to disable it.\n\nA: This is a system-wide feature of scroll views. There is no system-wide undo. However, some applications (such as Instapaper) implement their own way of undoing it.\n", "Q: Is there a remote file transfer solution for TextMate? Currently doing some php in Eclipse but want to switch to something like Textmate because Eclipse runs like a fat dog. Eclipse has Esftp installed as well as subclipse. This way when i want to work on a new project, I connect to the SVN server and fetch the project from there. The project then has all the configuration already set for esftp most of the time so that you can just save changes to the server directly. \nMy question is can if I can assign a rootfolder for the project on a remote server as well after I've imported the project from SVN? So I can just upload changes to the server directly?\n\nA: While TextMate doesn't have built-in FTP or SSH capabilities there are a few bundles for it that have tried to remedy this shortcoming.\nIn particular the FTP/SSH Bundle aims to provide what you seek: a way to define a \"project\" that can be synchronized (both up and down) with a remote file system. The bundle is a touch dangerous if you're using FTP as it requires your password be left in plaintext in the .ftpssh_settings file that you leave on disk at the root of your project folder to tell the plugin how to connect to your remote file system.\nThe other option, if you're not set on TextMate and just want something like TextMate, is to take a look at Sublime Text 2. I'll be honest, I was a die hard TextMate guy, but in the last six weeks Sublime Text 2 has won me over. The active development from the company on the product, the very active bundle community, and it's incredible speed when it comes to working on large files have really taken me in. There's an FTP, FTPS, SFTP plugin for ST2 that's a cut above the plugin for TM I mentioned above. It leverages keychain for password storage and doesn't require you keep your passwords in plaintext on disk for it to work. It also lets you set up mappings for remote <-> local connections directly from the editor UI.\n", "Q: mac mini for software development I intend to start to develop for Apple products. My question is if a Mac mini with the below configuration will suffice for this purpose.\n\n\n*\n\n*2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5\n\n*2GB memory\n\n*500GB hard drive\n\n*Intel HD Graphics 3000\n\n*OS X Lion\nI intend to develop in Objective-C but the question is if Apple will farther allow native code apps on their mobile hardware.\n\nA: I have dual core i5 macbook pro with 4GB memory. I am working on an iOS game in my free time. I am happy with build times and debugging performance.\nOn my system (running OSX Lion) I have around 200MB free memory while debugging on the simulator, around 300MB while not debugging. Debugging on the device consumes less memory than the simulator. I have iTunes and safari open which consumes a lot of memory too. So 2GB memory may be somewhat insufficient. You should have 4GB to be safe.\nAs for the native code question, Apple will almost definitely allow native code apps. They don't allow Flash. They don't allow Java. They don't allow just-in-time compiling of .NET/mono. They actively develop, advertise and enforce their SDK. They allow freely mixing C/C++/Objective-C in your code. They also allow script based games for example, Corona SDK uses Lua as scripting language, and there are many games developed with Corona SDK. You should have a look at such SDKs since they allow developing both in MS Windows and OSX. Also such SDKs allow you to develop cross platform apps, which means you can develop for iOS and android at the same time. However, you must have a mac and iOS developer account (99$/yr) to debug and publish for iOS (no such restrictions for android).\n\nA: Xcode will work on that system, but performance will be bad with only 2GB of RAM, especially with some of the debugging tools, or if your app is only half finished and you haven't optimised it's memory usage yet (I like to get my app working first, and then figure out how to reduce memory usage later).\nIt will be absolutely worth spending a tiny bit of money to upgrade it to 4GB, and honestly I would upgrade to 8GB instead.\nRAM is usually cheaper if you buy from a third party and install yourself. There are many RAM companies who will tell you exactly what RAM to buy for your specific mac and how to install it (sometimes installation is easy, sometimes it's difficult, depending on the model).\nEven if money isn't much of an issue (boss paying for it, etc), I still prefer to install it myself because build-to-order configurations can add weeks to the delivery time, when it only takes 10 minutes to install the RAM yourself (and you can use it with only 2GB if the mac arrives before the third party RAM). The only drawback is if you break something installing the RAM, it won't be covered under apple's warranty, and you may need to install the old RAM before doing a warranty claim, to prove that your third party RAM isn't the problem (bad RAM can cause all kinds of crazy issues).\nThe CPU and Graphics card are both plenty fast enough, as long as you're not working on 3D games.\nNote there are plenty of mac programmers who always buy the most expensive Mac Pro available and still wish it was faster. If you buy a budget mac, don't expect Xcode to be blazing fast! But it will be plenty fast enough to get work done even on old second hand hardware.\n\nA: Yes - Xcode makes native code targeted for iOS devices and objectively, anything that runs Lion is fully capable of developing software for iOS. \nSubjectively, some developers prefer specific CPU and RAM/SSD and screen layouts ( say a pair of 30 inch displays mounted portrait) but these performance and usability preferences are highly personal choices and also depend highly on \"how much $ is your time worth\". A full time developer that bills at 150/hr and has months of backlog would easily \"need\" an 8 core MacPro with 32 gig of ram and SSD drives from an ROI standpoint, but not from an \"Xcode won't work on lesser hardware\" standpoint. \n", "Q: New Snow Leopard ... \"Select All\" won't Trash Just ran Snow Leopard on my 10.4 Tiger iMac6.1 desktop.  All has gone swimmingly.  But now ... the way I work, I have several icons, photos, on desktop when I'm finished and I Trash them.\nClicking Edit, \"Select All\" highlights all, and when I drag all into Trash, it doesn't Trash.  I can individually select an icon, click and drag, into Trash.\nBut \"Select All\" doesn't work.\nIdeas?\n\nA: Likely there's an item in your 'select all' that cannot be trashed; a .dmg in use or a mounted disk (your hard drive, a CD-ROM, a flash drive), for example.\nThat'll prevent anything in your selection from going into trash.\n\nA: Hold Command when you select the trash empty button\n", "Q: MacBook Air slow shutdown time I have a late-2010 MacBook Air and I've been experiencing pretty slow shutdown times recently. I know that there's always the \"how often do you shutdown your computer?\" argument but I see that as invalid because throughout the life of this laptop it has thus far had a roughly 3-5 second shutdown time. My concern is that the slow shutdown time is an early warning sign that the SSD is beginning to fail, or that there is some other component that is beginning to fail.\nAs an experiment I created a new user and performed a shutdown with that account and the slow shutdown issue persisted.\nI also have FileVault enabled, but I disabled it and the shutdown time was the same.\nFor comparison, the boot time has remained roughly the same since I bought it. Fresh from the box it had an 18 second off-to-browsing time, and now that time is about 24 seconds counting the time it takes for me to enter the password and fire up Safari.\nI was thinking it could be an application that is causing the issue, but I have no idea how to diagnose that other than uninstalling everything one app at a time to see.\nIf it's important, here is a list of installed apps, just in case anyone knows of an issue caused by any of these:\nWunderkit\nOffice for Mac\niWork (Pages, Numbers, Keynote)\nXcode\nPhotoshop, InDesign, Dreamweaver, Illustrator, AfterEffects, Contribute - All CS5\nWunderlist\nMySQL Workbench\nSymantec EndPoint Protection (completely disabled and not running, just installed because it has to be for work)\nFirefox, Opera, and Chrome\nNVAlt\nFilezilla\nThat's all the non-apple software that's installed.\nIs it possible to somehow inspect the shutdown process, like booting in verbose mode as is suggested here: MacBook Air has suddenly become very slow at booting and shutdown\nAny help is appreciated\n\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\nEdit - March 13, 2012\nI finally had time to try a reboot and this time it took a long time again (sometimes it is slow and sometimes it's nearly instant, which is what is making this hard to track down).\nAnyway, I grabbed the following from my system.log between the shutdown and BOOT_TIME:\nMar 13 23:37:23 MyLaptop [0x0-0x1f91f9].com.apple.iTunes[2323]: Parent: Error or timeout on select\nMar 13 23:37:23 MyLaptop [0x0-0x1f91f9].com.apple.iTunes[2323]: Child with pid 2548 exited normally\nMar 13 23:37:23: --- last message repeated 1 time ---\nMar 13 23:37:23 MyLaptop [0x0-0x1f91f9].com.apple.iTunes[2323]: ATHostConnectionDestroy 0x7fe5f53e3010\nMar 13 23:37:25 MyLaptop com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[139] ([0x0-0x125125].com.apple.iCal[1410]): Exited: Killed: 9\nMar 13 23:37:25 MyLaptop mds[65]: (Error) Server: ==== XPC handleXPCMessage XPC_ERROR_CONNECTION_INVALID\nMar 13 23:37:25 MyLaptop com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[139] ([0x0-0xe00e].com.apple.iTunesHelper[187]): Exited: Killed: 9\nMar 13 23:37:25 MyLaptop com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[139] ([0x0-0x22022].com.apple.AppleSpell[260]): Exited: Killed: 9\nMar 13 23:37:25 MyLaptop com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[139] (com.apple.quicklook[2414]): Exited: Killed: 9\nMar 13 23:37:25 MyLaptop com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[139] ([0x0-0x236236].com.apple.ImageCaptureExtension2[2549]): Exited: Killed: 9\nMar 13 23:37:25 MyLaptop com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[139] (com.apple.mdworker.pool.0[1777]): Exited: Terminated: 15\nMar 13 23:37:25 MyLaptop loginwindow[67]: DEAD_PROCESS: 67 console\nMar 13 23:37:25 MyLaptop loginwindow[67]: LWCASProcessNotificationManager UNEXPECTED NOTIFICATION of type: kLSNotifyLaunchFinished\nMar 13 23:37:25 MyLaptop airportd[2596]: _doAutoJoin: Already associated to “network_wifi”.

After about a minute, the system forcibly kills it.\nUse the Console utility to check your system.log.  Look at the entries around the time of a shutdown for messages indicating that an app is not shutting down as it should.  These would most likely be generated by com.apple.launchd or SystemStarter.  Also look for the keywords SIGINT or SIGKILL, which is what the system would use to terminate a process which is not cooperating with shutdown.\n", "Q: iMac as a print server for iOS?

I'm an iTunes Match subscriber, and since I signed up, Smart Playlists haven't been working in conjunction with my iPhone.\nI have several Smart Playlists and each one has a song limit.\nOn my iPhone, the Smart Playlists completely ignore the limit, which makes them sort of useless, because I can't download a playlist without filling up my phone.\nIt also seems that my Smart Playlists aren't updating, even though they're all set to \"live update.\"\nIs there a way to get Smart Playlists working with iTunes Match and iOS?\nMy recently added and recently played playlists were my way of keeping my phone up-to-date without having to manually manage my music. Not having functional Smart Playlists is a pain.\n\nA: There are a couple of potential solutions to this problem. I say potential because everyone's listening habits and needs are different, so your mileage may vary. Here goes:  \nThe Smart Playlist problem is not new, and certainly not unique in your case.  There seems to be an overall problem with Smart Playlist syncing through iTunes Match (1) across different devices, (2) with any expediency (usually takes >= 48 hours), and (3) with respect to honoring certain rules (e.g., number of songs allowed).  Another common theme seems to be that \"nested\" playlists cause even more of a problem than standard Smart Playlists. Nested lists are those that are created when you use your option key to turn the + into an ellipsis (...), which creates a sub-rule for your master rule. \nSolution 1: Dumb it down\n\nCreate a standard playlist (Dumb) and give it the same name as your Smart playlist. Copy the content from Smart to Dumb. Sync your device, computer, whatever. Rinse, wash, repeat for each Smart Playlist you want to have properly represented on your other devices. This works. \n\nSolution 2: Really Dumb it Down  \n\nDo your best to avoid the aforementioned nested playlists. This may require you to build several smaller smart playlists with limited criteria. Not the easiest workaround, but we're going for functionality here, right? \n\nSolution 3: Really make your \"Recently Added\" folder songs that are \"Recently Added\"    \n\nFor your \"Recently Added\" folder, tack on just one more rule to force songs added after a date, rather than only within the last two weeks (see pic below)  \n\n \nSo, I hope this gets you at least a little closer to your goal. I tried to add as much info as I could here since, one more time: everyone's listening and categorizing habits are different :-)\nYou may find other variations on these, but do realize that, at least for now, this is a server-side problem and workarounds like these represent the best available solutions.   \n", "Q: Triple boot (Lion, Win7, Ubuntu) I currently have my MacBook Pro set up to dual boot OS X Lion and Windows 7. I am in the middle of a development project where I need to write some custom software that depends on proprietary drivers that only work in Linux. I have been using a vm but it's getting tedious. It would be nice to be able to boot up into Ubuntu natively.\nCurrently I have one 500 GB drive that has a 130 GB Windows 7 partition (bootcamp), Lion recovery partition, and my OS X Lion partition with the remaining space. When I try to partition the space i get \"Partition failed, couldn't modify partition map because file system verification failed\". \nI am doing this through Disk Utility running from a Lion recovery flash drive. First aid shows no errors on the drive, but I repaired it anyway and still I get the same error when I try to repartition. \nAs a last effort I thought it might have to do with fragmentation of the free space so I defragged the drive (against my better judgment) using iDefrag, repeated the above process from USB recovery disk and still I get the same error.\nWhat is the most efficient way to get 4 partitions: OS X, Lion recovery, Windows 7, Ubuntu Linux (booting using refit) without having to wipe everything and reload (reloading OS X and Windows 7 would be unpleasant)?\n\nA: You should be able to use iPartition to solve this problem. I've had a lot of success with re-partitioning drives that failed when trying to use Disk Utility. It also depends on the partition scheme on the drive. If the scheme doesn't support repartitioning you will have to wipe the drive and start fresh.\nI would suggest a GUID partition scheme.\n\nA: I can't speak directly to how this works in Lion, but on 10.6.8, you cannot repartition your startup disk on the fly. You have to erase and reinstall first. On the initial installation procedures, you then use Disk Utility to partition and format the disk as you'd like it. You can use Boot Camp to set up partitions ex post facto, but that is restricted to Boot Camp only (again, this is in relation to Snow Leopard, but I imagine the process is the same for Lion).\nI hope I am wrong about this so that you don't have to spend hours reinstalling your stuff. Good luck! \n\nA: Partition the disk while you're booted on it not from the recovery disk.\n", "Q: How do I speed up new Terminal tab loading time? How can i speed up the terminal startup in Lion?\nI'm not referring to the startup of the Terminal application, but to the startup terminal windows, like when i open a new tab.\nI don't have anything in my .bash_profile file and i run rm -rf  /private/var/log/asl/*.asl every 4 hours (which clear those files that usually make terminal slow ).\nCurrently, when i open a new tab, it takes 3-4 seconds until i can run something.\n\nA: It is all about investigating the cause. You can see what's being done while the process starts by inputing bash -x which will print out the process of starting up the shell.\nPersonally, I only notice the delay between activation and de-activation of the app and in the first tab created after a period of activity. It always makes me think that it is about memory pages being moved around.\n\nA: In my case, after trying the above on my work machine without success, I found that the culprit was Active Directory. The fix was to go into Directory Utility and edit the AD service settings (double-click on \"Active Directory\") to enable \"Create mobile account at login\":\n\nThis apparently causes the AD credentials to be cached locally, so the system no longer has to go out to the server every time it tries to validate your password.\nYou can get to Directory Utility with Spotlight or via the \"Login Options\" section of System Preferences / Users & Groups (select the \"Edit…\" button next to \"Network Account Server\"):\n\n\nA: What I needed was changing from login shell to command /bin/bash -il\nin iTerm's Preferences > Profiles > General > Command.\nI needed the option -l (Make bash act as if it had been invoked as a login shell) added in order to set environmental variables from ~/.bash_profile\n\nA: .hushlogin\nCreate an empty file in your home folder called .hushlogin; this will significantly decrease the time it takes for a Terminal.app tab to appear.\nYou can create the .hushlogin file in Terminal.app using the following command:\ntouch ~/.hushlogin\n\nThe file will take effect immediately.\nYou can learn more about the .hushlogin file and the login process in general in the login manual.\nQuietening the login process\nWhen you create a new Terminal tab, you are going through the login process. The process involves fetching various information about your previous login session, message of the day, and displaying system messages. This can be the source of significant delays. Try hushing these messages to see if the delay disappears.\n\nA: Reduce your history to something between 4 and 10 thousand lines and perhaps try quitting and discarding all saved windows. I have seen both make a difference on slower machines - especially ones without SSD for storage. \n\nA: Short Answer:\nThe problem is caused by a (potentially) expensive ASL system log lookup.  To see this in action, run sudo fs_usage | grep 'asl.*login' in a Terminal window, then open a new Terminal window.\nTo solve the problem, configure Terminal to launch a non-standard shell:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a symlink to your preferred shell.  E.g.: sudo ln -s /bin/bash /usr/local/bin/bash\n\n*Open Terminal Preferences and select the \"General\" tab.\n\n*Select \"Shells open with: Command\" and enter the symlink you created in step 1.  E.g. \"/usr/local/bin/bash\".\n\n\nNote 1: You may also need to add bash and -bash to the process list at \"Terminal Preferences > Profiles > Shell > Ask before closing\".\nNote 2: /usr/local/bin is writable in OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) Rootless mode.  \nTo verify the fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a new Terminal window.\n\n*\"Last Login:\" should not be displayed at the top\n\n*Open the inspector (Command + I) and select the Info tab.\n\n*The command should read login -pfq username /usr/bin/bash or login -pfql username ...\nImportant: If the login command does not include the -q parameter, then you have not fixed the problem.\nYou can also use sudo fs_usage | grep 'asl.*login' to verify that /var/log/asl is not accessed when opening a new Terminal window.\nDetails:\nThere are a number of bugs at play here.\nThe actual cause of the slowness is /usr/bin/login, which by default will display the date of your last login.  To get this last login date, it searches the ASL (Apple System Log) database at /var/log/asl/.  These log files can be very heavily fragmented and it's this file fragmentation that causes the delay when opening a new window or tab.  (Bug 1)\nThe only way to suppress the ASL search for last login is to pass the -q parameter to /usr/bin/login.  The .hushlogin file will also suppress the \"Last Login\" display, but it does not suppress the expensive ASL search. (Bug 2)\nTerminal always uses /usr/bin/login to launch each new window/shell.  There is no option to launch a shell directly nor is there a way to directly control the parameters passed to /usr/bin/login (Bug 3).\nAs it turns out, Terminal will pass the -q parameter to /usr/bin/login when it is configured to use a non-standard shell.  (Bug 4)\nThe -q parameter is what we need to avoid the problem, hence the symlink to /usr/local/bin/bash.\n\nA: OK I have a similar conclusion to Darren, though slightly different profiling mechanism (NB slow login can still occur in Yosemite).\nHere's a way to tell what is actually running when you start a new login window, using the OS X sample profiler command.\nFind out what command a normal login executs\n$ ps -ef | grep login\n\nYou'll seee something like login -pfl username /bin/bash -c exec -la bash /bin/bash\nCreate a script file name profile_login.sh with the following contents by adding a \n-c \"\" \nto the end of the discovered command to request that bash return immediately, with contents like this:\nlogin -pfl username /bin/bash -c exec -la bash /bin/bash -c \"\" &\nsudo sample $! -mayDie # sample the above command\n\nMake it executable \n$ chmod u+x profile_login.sh\nand run it using sudo (sample command requires it)\n$ sudo ./profile_login.sh\nOK so go ahead and run it.  For instance by executing the purge command first.  On my box, I got a large output graph.  Looking for the \"biggest numbered branches\" (typically at the top) I saw the following two biggest offenders:\nOne from something called pam_start which appears to opening pam auth lib images\n+   ! 1068 pam_start  (in libpam.2.dylib) + 132  [0x7fff97295ab0]\n+   !    :   1066 openpam_dynamic  (in libpam.2.dylib) + 120  [0x7fff97293d14]\n+   !    :   |   +   !   1042 coresymbolication_load_image(CSCppDyldSharedMemoryPage*, ImageLoader const*, unsigned long long)  (in dyld) + 143  [0x7fff66725411]\n+   !    :   |   +   !   :     1042 mach_msg_trap  (in dyld) + 10  [0x7fff6674a472]\n\nand that is sometimes followed by another offender getlastlogxbyname\n+   ! 583 getlastlogxbyname  (in libsystem_c.dylib) + 212  [0x7fff92b3ef7a]\n+   !       : 566 asl_file_open_read  (in libsystem_asl.dylib) + 143  [0x7fff8c27030d]\n+   !       : | 566 __open_nocancel  (in libsystem_kernel.dylib) + 10  [0x7fff97b39012]    +   !       : | 566 __open_nocancel  (in libsystem_kernel.dylib) + 10  [0x7fff97b39012]\n\nSo basically, there are two offenders.  One is pam (some type of authentication system) and the other it the asl \"detect your latest login\" stuff.  So apparently just deleting your /private/var/log/asl/*.asl files is not enough.  The pam loading is much more expensive on my machine, anyway [SSD].  Feel free to run the above script and see if your system is the same.  Interestingly, the source code for these method calls seems to also be available online, for instance openpam_dynamic\nIf I follow Darren's answer, and replace my \"shells open with\" preference to something other than /bin/bash, I then see the following lines used to start new terminal tabs:\n $ ps -ef | grep login\n  ... login -pfql packrd /bin/bash -c exec -la bash /usr/bin/bash\n\nSo if I now use the same sample trick on the new login command\nlogin -pfql username /bin/bash -c exec -la bash /usr/bin/bash -c \"\" &\nsudo sample $! -mayDie\n\na much smaller stacktrace is generated, the biggest offender being:\n+         8 pam_end  (in libpam.2.dylib) + 190  [0x7fff97294ebb]\n+             !           6 coresymbolication_unload_image(CSCppDyldSharedMemoryPage*, ImageLoader const*)  (in dyld) + 143  [0x7fff6e0f634f]\n\nI think this is because the login \"-q\" parameter is now being used.  Apparently this parameter skips both loading the pam modules and looking up the last login time (both offenders). According to the docs of the login command, touching the ~/.hushlogin file should do the same thing, but apparently this no longer works [at least for me with 10.10].\nSo, in summary, removing /private/var/log/asl/*.asl is not enough (in my experiment, it only accounted for at most 1/3 of the actual slowdown, though if you had mores files there it could account for a greater percentage I'm sure).\nAnyway using similar scripts, you should be able to tell what's causing your local machine to bog down, and see if the above fix applies to you.  Feel free to comment here.\nUPDATE: seems that coresymbolication_load_image can still take tons of time, even when login -pfql is invoked (presumably some pam authentication module or other is having to \"dial out\" to a central login server or some odd, so has to wait for a response from a 3rd party).  So the only real workaround I have found is to use iTerm2, and change the preferences -> profiles -> general -> Command to /bin/bash instead.\n\nA: For those with with slow startup times but none of the above work, \nmy .zprofile was littered with eval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\" repeated 50x.\nSo profiling was giving me super fast speeds and the terminal took 4 to 10 seconds to load.\nYou can access this file at ~/.zprofile\\\nRemove all the lines and it'll immediately be an instant prompt again.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Just run:\nsudo creatbyproc.d\nsudo newproc.d\n\nin separate terminals and open the new open to see what is being executed during that time.\nIf nothing obvious, try the following:\nsudo dtruss -an Terminal\n\nThis will print all your details which are happening on tab loading time. \n\nA: Open /etc/profile and add the line PATH=\"\" so it looks like this:\nif [ -x /usr/libexec/path_helper ]; then\n    PATH=\"\"\n    eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s`\nfi\n\n\nA: The problem for me was that the active directory domain server was invalid.\nChanging it then rebooting the mac fixed it.\n\n", "Q: IPod touch 4th generation, USB connector is broken and password is lost - how to reactivate? The USB connector of my iPod was broken some time ago. I was not able to connect the device to a computer or to charge it. Now - a few month later - an iPod repair store told me that it is not possible to repair the USB connector because it has a fixed connection to the mainboard. But they were able to make some pins working again. Now I can charge the device, but a connection to iTunes is not possible. \nNow the problem is that I do not remember the unlock password. I tried some of my most commonly used, but after a few failures the iPod gives me only one PIN try and then locks the device for ten minutes. Resetting with iTunes is not possible because of the missing physical connection. Is there a way To make the iPod work again? There is no important data on it that has to be saved.\n\nA: Unfortunately, you cannot reset a PIN without iTunes.  \nThe last thing that you could try is going to Genius Bar and hope that they can help.  Apple Stores have been known to completely replace broken devices, in some cases even if they aren't under warranty.\n", "Q: Protect a Mac from all unwanted inbound/outbound traffic?

I am seeing images of iPhone white with only white background, while the front is black (or it looks on images). I am looking to buy used iphone 3gs and many images from different sellers are like this. \nSo, is white iphone 3gs all white or only the back of the phone is white? Or the front is of such color that black dominates and white cannot be seen on images?\n\nA: No. The white iPhone 3GS does not have a white face, just a white back cover.\n\n", "Q: In Spotlight search results, how do I find which folder contains a specific file? In OSX Spotlight, how do I find in which folder a document is? It used to be that hovering the mouse over the doc would show the folder. I miss that functionality!\n\nA: Hold option and command for a second. (Edit: On 10.9 and later, hold command only.) It'll show you the path. Well, part of the path. It's really not as useful as it used to be.\nOther than that, command-R (or command-return) will reveal the original file, just as with the previous version.\nAnd, of course, you can Show All In Finder. If you have the status bar showing, it should show the path there as well. (And in a slightly better form.)\n\nA: With OS X Yosemite's new Spotlight search, if you hold down ⌘ with a file selected the path bar will be displayed which shows you the path to the file:\n\n\nA: If you want the path in a copyable form:\n\n\n*\n\n*press ⌘ + i\nYou'll get the standard File Info dialog.\nUpdate: In Yosemite, for some reason, the dialog opens behind other windows, so might not be visible.

I'm trying to test out how my website looks on the iPhone, but all I have is an iPad. Is there a way to force the iPad into iPhone size view window?\n\nA: Nope, you can't do that. But if you have a Mac, you can install Xcode from the Mac App Store for free.\nIt comes with an app called iOS Simulator which will let you run Mobile Safari on your Mac, including the resolution of older iPhones/iPods (non-retina display), new retina display iPhones, and the iPad's resolution.\nIt also implements all the touch screen Javascript events (eg: onmouseover is triggered when you tap instead of onclick, then onclick is triggered when you tap again), double tap to zoom into a DOM element, and will properly show you how things like fixed position CSS elements will appear, which is very different on Mobile Safari compared to regular desktop Safari, and it gives you all the iOS form elements (<select multiple> fields are completely different for example).\nI'm not aware of any way to properly test your website on Windows or Linux, changing the browser window size is not good enough.\n\nA: Well, you could find a third-party browser app that is only for the iPhone and use that on your iPad.  There are plenty of free ones.  Just search for \"browser\" in the App Store.\n\nA: More or less any browser which has a special iPhone version (not universal) will work. I recommend the Perfect Browser, or Aquari iPhone browser.\n\nA: You can use Dolphin browser. Just download it for iPad from iPhone apps section. You can also use service like http://testiphone.com\n\nA: If you can use a desktop version of Google Chrome, it can emulate an iPhone.  In the debug mode, click the \"emulate devices\" icon near of top left of the debug panel, and it can let you emulate iPhones, iPad, Samsung phones, and many other models (the list is about 20 items long).\nIt not only emulate the width and height, but it will act according to your meta tag for viewport as well.  So if you have this line in your HTML <head> section:\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\n\nThen the emulator for iPhone 6 Plus will show a \"yes I am a small screen and I will act accordingly\" version of the page.  On the other hand, without the above line, iPhone 6 Plus will pretend itself to be a powerful browser with a wide screen, and show you the page -- but in this case the text will be very small and not very readable.  So what I mean is, Google Chrome will emulate your phone with the HTML code being displayed faithfully, as if it is a real device.\nCompare that with Firefox version 44.0, which can only emulate the device size, but it won't care about the meta line above, so you could see one version of the page on Firefox, and see a different version of the page on a real device.\nHere is a screenshot of emulating an iPhone 6 Plus:\n\n", "Q: Unable to set previously used resolution, 1600x2560 I just came back to the office after being away for a month, plugged my mac into the 30\" Dell display I have at work (rotated 90 degrees), and it the resolution is now 1536x2048 and that is the highest resolution available in System Preferences. Before I went away, I was always using 1600x2560, which is the native resolution.\nIf I remove the \"90 degrees\" rotation, it will let me use 2560x1600, but changing it back to 90 degrees drops the resolution back to 1536x2048.\nThe only thing I changed while away was upgrade from OS X 10.7.2 to 10.7.3. Perhaps this was the problem?\nHow can I change it back to 1600x2560?\n\nA: This is a bug in 10.7.3. I have the same exact problem. I suggest filing a bug with apple: bugreport.apple.com. It doesn't look like there is any workaround for it.\n\nA: Well, this is a third part app called SwitchResX that I use for similar situations:\nhttp://www.madrau.com/indexSRX4.html\nIt's a \"powertool\" and can be used to force a monitor into non-detected modes.\nI'd love to find a command line option like xorg's xrandr on OS X, but despite a lot of searching I've yet to find anything equivalent.\n", "Q: Possible to access/restore past versions of Notes in iCloud? If I mistakenly delete or otherwise mess up a Note that is stored in iCloud, is there a way to restore a past version of the Note?\n\nA: Assuming you have 2 devices, let's say an iPhone and iPad, there is only one thing you can do:\n\n\n*\n\n*delete something on your iPhone\n\n*as soon as you notice, enable airplane mode on your iPad\n\n*unlock iPad & open notes\n\n*copy note to somewhere else\n\n*turn off airplane mode\n\n*copy note back to notes\n\n\nOther than that, there unfortunately doesn't seem to be anything you can do.\n\nA: Whoo hoo. Found a great solution for this issue in this question\nNotes.app - how to access history?\n\nYou can use Time Machine to recover notes by restoring the 3 .sqlite\n  files in\n~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.notes/ Quit Notes.app\n  Restore those 3 files If you use iCloud, disconnect from Wifi so the\n  notes aren't synced from your iCloud devices when you re-open\n  Notes.app Re-open Notes.app\n\nSo just make sure your time machine is up to date and that you open notes regularly on your Mac.\n\nA: Short answer is no :(. That is, unless you can get to the note before iCloud updates it, but that would not be much time at all.\nNot that they are in the same class, but one can do that with Time Machine. It allows one to go back through, and it has saved and kept track of the changes that have been made to documents.\n\nA: This isn't an ideal solution, but when you have notes that you absolutely need to recover, this will do. I was able to recover partial aspects of the note I had written a day later.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Run:\ncd ~/Library\ngrep -r \"[Some string you remember from your note]\" ./\n\n\n*A lot will come up. Apen any file that has a match in TextEdit (you can ignore most of them i.e the ones that are from the Calendar app etc as your note probably will not be there)\n\n*When I did this my notes were in several pieces scattered across the file. Try to piece together the different chunks, pasting the pieces in their own new text files and saving them as .html\n\n*Open the html files in your browser - you should be able to see the content\n\n*Piece together your content\n\n\nAgain, not ideal, but this just saved me on a note that got wiped, but really needed!\n\nA: Here is one tricky way that worked for me.\nThe local database actually stores the history version. However, the UI might not show all the historical version. So the first step is to check if the database still contains the hidden historical version that you are looking for.\nTo do that, you can click on the top right search bar, and search for some keywords that you can remember the historical version has but not in the latest version.\nFor instance, if your historical version contains a keyword \"Summary\", but you accidentally deleted the last section which contains \"Summary\", then searching for keyword \"Summary\" would still return the doc you wanted to recover. Meaning, when you search for keyword \"Summary\", the search result shows the doc you want to recover contains it, however, you can't find it. That means the Search functionality not only visits the latest version, but also visit the historical versions. That gives you chance to recover!\nOnce you have confirmed the text you want to recover exists in the historical version, now is time try a trick to force recover.\nStep 1. open ~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.app.notes/\nYou should see three files:\n\n*\n\n*NoteStore.sqlite-shm\n\n*NoteStore.sqlite-wal\n\n*NoteStore.sqlite\n\nThe sqlite-wal file is the write ahead logs, it keeps the latest changes.\nThe sqlite file is a snapshot of an old verison.\nCheck the modified date of these two files, if your changes happen between the modified date of these two files, then you might be able to recover.\nStep 2. Quit Notes app\nStep 3. Make a backup of these three files first (VERY IMPORTANT). Also make a backup of your important notes.\nStep 4. Delete the sqlite-wal file, again make sure you have made a backup of the above three files before deleting it.\nStep 5. Turn off WIFI\nStep 6. Open Notes app\nFind and check your note, and see if it's the historical version.\nStep 7. Recover the latest version\nOnce you've made a copy of the historical version of your doc. Now you may want to recover the notes to the latest version again. Simply replace the three files with the original backup.\n\n*\n\n*NoteStore.sqlite-shm\n\n*NoteStore.sqlite-wal\n\n*NoteStore.sqlite\n\nWARNING. better to do the above steps with WIFI off, so whatever change made won't be synced to iCloud.\n\nA: View → Show Note Activity\nIf the changes you want to roll back are small, you can trace back changes to a notes with View → Show Note Activity. When you select a history item in Note Activity, it highlights changes associated with that edit.\n\nWhile you can't directly restore a version, this feature gives what you need to identity and manually redress small, unwanted changes. This answer applies to the aforementioned question, Notes.app - how to access history?.\n", "Q: How to fully 'uninstall' an app on OS X So, I've been a Mac user for about seven or so months now. And one thing I've been wondering is how to fully remove an application..\nI know a lot of times applications leave extra junk on your computer; and, deleting the app from the applications directory doesn't fully remove it. I'm just wondering how I can 'search for and destroy' the files the apps leave behind.\n\nA: If you buy the app from the Mac App Store, you can completely uninstall it using Launchpad. Click and hold to start the apps wiggling, then hit the X by the app you want to delete.\nFor apps installed outside of the Mac App Store, I use AppZapper.\n\nA: I use AppTrap. I it is free and installs a pref pane. Whenever you move an app to the trash, it asks you if you want to move all files associated with it to the trash. It works really well, and I highly recommend it.\n\n\nA: 01) You can manually un-install your application(s), but that requires solid knowledge of your file system for once and depending on the software it sometimes does not make much sense, since some software is deeply nested within your system. (also sometimes requires root access.\n02) you can use software of course, that actually enables you to see where every single file related to your installed application is located on your system. That makes sense for beginners and even advanced users. \nFrom experience i can suggest the following:\nCleanApp or\nTrashMe (recommended)\niTrash or\nAppDelete or\nAppCleaner (i can't say much about them)\nsome are available for trial, so you might want to test them, before you purchase!!\n\nA: If the app is a driver or some kind of system hack, then you better read it's documentation or contact it's tech support team to find out how to uninstall it.\nFor most apps, simply quit the app and drag it to the trash.\nMost mac apps won't create much extra \"junk\". It will leave a few configuration files/etc around, but they're usually really small and you want them to be there, incase you ever decide to install the app again.\nIf you really want to get rid of it all:\nOpen Finder, and bring up the Go menu. Hold down the Option key to make the Library menu item visible, and click on it.\nType the name of the app into the top right search box (eg: \"TextMate\"), and when it suggests \"Filename contains: textmate\" in the menu, click on that. By default, it will search \"This Mac\", click on \"Library\" to only search the folder you were in before doing the search.\nMake sure everything you see is actually related to the app, and move it to the trash. When a file is selected, the \"Path Bar\" at the bottom of the window will tell you where the file is, which can help figure out what app it belongs to.\nBe careful, modifying anything in a Library folder can screw up your system. Don't do it at all unless you have a backup to restore to incase something goes wrong. It's usually pretty safe though, most files in the Library folder in your user's home folder will be re-created as necessary, if something important has been deleted.\nYou might also want to search your entire system instead of just ~/Library, but if the app installs anything elsewhere in the system then that's a pretty good sign that you should be checking the documentation for the correct uninstall procedure and/or contacting their tech support, to make sure it is actually safe to delete those files without screwing up your system.\nIf you are the type of person who regularly installs random apps from the internet and then deletes most of them... then you should either test these apps in a virtual machine or at least using the \"Guest\" account feature (where pretty much everything is deleted as soon as you log out).\n", "Q: How can I resize OS X 10.7 Lion display screen resolution during install? I have a Mac Mini (2011) with no OS installed currently (drives are RAIDed and I lost Recovery HD partition). \nWhen I boot, I start the Internet Recovery, which I am viewing through a Samsung P50 Plasma TV. The max. resolution of the TV is 1366x768 pixel. \nAfter Recovery begins, it tries to open the installer with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixel and won't let me access some parts of the screen. Unfortunately, that also includes the \"Continue\" button and progress bar to install Lion. \nIs there any way I can force a smaller resolution or get the window to move, so I can start the installation?\n\nA: Ran into the same issue.  Followed YouTube video of installation in order to figure out the following:\nOnce the disc is booted, select Reinstall OS X.  You will then reach the screen where you cannot see the Continue button.  Using your keyboard, press TAB followed by SPACE.  You should then reach the User Agreement screen.  Press TAB, TAB, TAB and SPACE.  Click the Agree button which should be visible.  Click the installation drive and press TAB, TAB and SPACE.\nThis should get you to the point where Lion is installing.\n\nA: Didn't work on TV. I ended up just connecting to a monitor during install and then plugging into the TV after the desktop booted.\n\nA: Try holding down the shift key during boot. It works for some displays, but maybe not your TV.\n", "Q: iTunes U: How can I extract audio from video lectures? I download lots of lectures from iTunes U. The problem is, they usually come with video and there is no audio-only version for many.\nHow can I, using any software available for Snow Leopard, free or paid, extract the audio from a series of video files and end up with a series of audio files?\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I suggest using Max or ffmpegx, which is a GUI for ffmpeg.\nYou can also use ffmpeg from the shell:\nfor f in *.mp4; do ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -vn -c copy \"${f%mp4}m4a\"; done\n\n-vn (video none) removes video streams and -c copy disables re-encoding the audio. You can install ffmpeg with brew install ffmpeg after installing Homebrew.\n\nA: You can import the clip into iMovie, then export it as an AIF audio file using the iMovie Share menu's Quicktime export feature. Then you can import the AIF file into iTunes. Once it's in iTunes, you can create a much more compact MP3 version.  All rather cumbersome. Too bad iTunes U doesn't just upload audio versions of all the lectures. The video files are big and unwieldy and difficult to use on an iPod. \n\nA: Old question, but one you can do that nobody mentioned is, download a bunch of Video Lectures using Itunes U.\nAdd the selections to a Playlist in iTunes.\nRight click the Playlist and select Burn Playlist to Disc:\nThere will be Disc Formats : Audio CD. and MP3 Cd.\nselecting either of those options will strip just the audio out of the disc.  Selecting Mp3 CD will give you the list of Mp3 files you were after. \nThe only catch is you have to write them to disc first. But it requires no third party tools or downloads and if your car doesn't have an easy audio hookup for the iPhone you can play them right off the CD.\n\nA: Please try it with VLC, see Extract Audio in the Videolan wiki.\n\nA: I use AudioHijack Pro it costs money though.  I can rip audio from DVDs and Internet streams.\n", "Q: Can I reset Notification Centre badge counter for Messages? The new Messages beta app (based on iChat) is stuck with one incoming message.\nCan I somehow reset the badge?\n\n\nA: The correct answer to this issue isn't to message all your contacts. \nFirst close the Messages app.\nThen simply open up Activity Monitor and quit the Dock process to restart it.\nHere's how it looks:\n\nYour badge count should be reset after that.\nPS: You can access Activity Monitor from Spotlight (⌘ Space) by simply typing its name and pressing Enter.\nEdit: update thanks to @JjP and @Toland H\n\nA: Sometimes you may miss reading a message from a friend. And sometimes Messages may not pull up the previous conversations as it should (it is still in testing and I hope those bugs are worked out for the final product).\nI would suggest sending a test message to all the previous contacts you've IM'ed. It'll pull up the respective conversation thread and hopefully kick off the unread message from your notification badge.\n\nA: Before you kill Dock you need to close Messages to make it work. I had this issue on Mountain Lion (Mac OS X 10.8.2). When Messages was open and I killed Dock it didn't help. But when I closed Messages and then killed Dock, the badge was gone and after opening Messages the unread messages appeared so I could read them.\n\nA: Go to Terminal and write:\nosascript -e 'quit app \"Messages\"'\nosascript -e 'quit app \"Dock\"'\nopen -a Messages\n\nThat's all\n\nA: Try to restart the dock. In the Terminal located at /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app type:\nkillall -KILL Dock\n\n\nA: Click and hold on the Messages icon in your dock. A context menu appears with unread messages. Navigate to the previously unlisted and unread message that way. Then \"read\" it.\n\n\nA: I'm not certain how the badge works, but I suspect the bug isn't on your computer, it's on apple's iMessage server somewhere in the cloud.\nTo fix it, you would have to have access to their servers, which you don't have.\nBasically, the solution is to stop using beta software if you are worried about glitches like this one.\n", "Q: iTunes Match + manually managed music? My iPhone is set to manually manage my music, and I'd prefer to keep it that way. However, I also like some of the features that iTunes Match offers. Is there any way that I can enable Match on my phone, download what I need, and then disable it again without it deleting my existing, manually-copied music?\n(The reason I don't want to switch to iTunes Match full-on is a) I have a lot of unique masterings and recordings that iTunes Match will match generically, b) I listen to a lot of one-off tracks that I don't want stored permanently, and c) it feels wrong that I can't copy music from my computer if I so wish, even if my phone is plugged into it.)\n\nA: Note that iTunes Match is fairly precise in how it matches songs.  A unique recording will probably be uploaded, not matched -- certainly, if the unique recording has a different length than the standard ones, it won't be matched.  If you are willing to potentially lose $25, get iTunes Match and see what is matched.  If stuff that you want to be uploaded is matched instead, don't use iTunes Match.\n\nA: You could turn Match on on your computer and not on the iPhone. That would allow you to keep manually managing your music on the phone. \nUltimately, though, it seems like iTunes Match is not a good match for the way you use music, particularly the \"unique masterings and recordings\". If you've got $25 to burn and you're willing to experiment, back up your library (and iTunes preferences) and turn it on. If your music disappears or comes back in a way you don't want it, turn Match off and restore your library and preferences. \n\nA: When you enable iTunes Match on your iPhone, the music you already copied manually to your  iPhone will stay on you iPhone. iOS will only delete tracks if/when there's not enough storage on your iPhone anymore. So if you make sure to leave a big enough part of your iPhone storage free, the songs you copied manually should stay on your iPhone.\n", "Q: iCloud storage is almost full I have an iPhone 4 and an iPad 2.  I've only had the iPad for three weeks, and iCloud is almost full.  How can I free up space?  I prefer not to buy more space.  It looks like the iPhone is using most of the space.\n\nA: Go to Settings > iCloud > Storage & Backup > Manage Storage > under \"Backups\" select the device you want to free up space on (i.e. \"Jim's iPhone\"). Go through and turn off different apps that you would like to not backup to iCloud. You can also see the applications that store data in the cloud (i.e. Camera Roll) and how much space each application has in cloud. This should show you where you can go to delete things and free up space. Or you could just turn off that apps backup. \nThe iCloud backup list sorts applications with the greatest users of backup space are sorted to the top of the list, so you can quickly assess whether you can thin out the content or need to either purchase more backup space or perhaps disable iCloud backups and instead back up to iTunes and then delete your iCloud backups to allow the space there to serve document sync and email storage.\n", "Q: Desktop Background is blank I change my background in system preferences and it says my background is a picture, but my desktop is still a blank gray. How can I fix this?\n\nA: Try opening Terminal, type killall Dock and press return. Dock controls the desktop background in Lion.\nIf it's still grey after that, try rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.desktop then killall Dock\n", "Q: How do I go invisible in Messages (OS X)? I am using Messages for OS X and Google Talk. I'd like to be able to go invisible in Messages. How can I do this?\n\nA: You don't get invisibility using Apple's Messages app on OS X. According to Google, their client also does not support invisible status, so perhaps it's a limitation of their API and only something you can set using their web app. They get to serve you ads when you are on the web, but not on a client so perhaps that was a factor in deciding to code that function in one place over the other.\nApple's Messages app on OS X will set an invisible status for AIM accounts, but not for Google Talk, so it's less like a Messages oversight as an account/API design issue from Google.\n", "Q: Restoring Lion/iCloud iCal from Time Machine Well I managed to delete my calendar, which was being synched via iCloud with my Mac, iPad, and iPhone. \nCan I repopulate my iCal calendar from a Time Machine backup?  ~/Library/ contains a folder called Calendars, but its contents look complicated and I don't dare simply restore the Calendars folder from yesterday's Time Machine backup.\nThanks.\n\nA: From what I can tell, Time Machine doesn't allow you to restore iCal calendars through the iCal app. And actually, you should be able to restore that calendars folder. \nWhile the directory contents are complicated, iCal should translate them back to what you had before. The only other thing I would bring over just to be on the safe side is your iCal's list file, located in ~/Library/Preferences. It should be called com.apple.iCal.plist. I would recommend moving this from your Time Machine backup to the same directory on your Mac. \nThat should do it for you.\n\nA: This worked for me but I had to clean things up before it actually did work :\nrm -fr ~/Library/Calendars\nrm -fr ~/Library/Preferences/*iCal*\ncp -fr $TimeMachineHome$/Library/Calendars ~/Library/Calendars\ncp -fr $TimeMachineHome$/Library/Preferences/*iCal* ~/Library/Preferences\n\n\nA: I found another solution using Time Machine.  You will have to look deep inside that Calendars folder though.  This was the only way I could find that would get around iCloud's penchant for re-syncing my lost calendar back into oblivion.\nI think these are the steps that will work.  For reference I am using Mavericks with iCloud Calendar syncing.\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Calendar.\n\n*Move the entire contents of the ~\\Library\\Calendars folder to a temp folder - both as a backup and for comparison below.\n\n*Stop iCloud Calendar syncing in System Preferences > iCloud\n\n*Enter Time Machine on the now empty Calendars folder.\n\n*Restore the contents of the Calendars folder to a time before you deleted/lost your calendar.\n\n*Now compare the temp folder with the restored Calendars folder to find your missing calendar.  I believe it will be in the .caldav folder - a folder in there will not be in your temp folder.  You can verify by opening the Events folder inside the missing folder and use Quick-look to view the lost events.  \n\n*Copy that Events folder out to your Desktop.\n\n*Open your Calendars application - your iCould synced calendars will not be there, but they are still in iCloud.\n\n*Create a new calendar \"On My Mac\" - it has to be local - if you turn on iCloud syncing before this step you won't be able to create a local calendar \"On My Mac\".\n\n*Drag the contents of the Events folder from your Desktop to the new calendar.  Wait for the events to copy over.\n\n*Close Calendar.\n\n*Turn iCloud Calendar syncing back on in System Preferences > iCloud\n\n*Open Calendar.  \n\n*Calendar should now re-sync all the iCloud calendars back - and - it will copy the new \"On My Mac\" calendar to iCloud - restoring all you lost events.  You can rename the new calendar.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\nA: These answers are all okay and I eventually got the first answer (from Matt Love) to work BUT ONLY AFTER I found that the Library Folder referred to is invisible on the desktop. This had kept me baffled and angry for an hour. You can't find it - either on your Boot Volume or on Time Machine - unless you search for \"Calendars\" and select the right one. Then, on the desktop you can force Library to reveal itself by selecting \"Open enclosing folder\". In Time Machine you search for \"Calendars\" and get a whole heap of items, you just have to keep checking inside each one until you find one that looks something like the old one you've already inspected on the desktop (and, yes, it does look confusing inside!). Time Machine hung repeatedly while I was doing this, which made me even happier! But finally I just restored \"Calendars\" and it worked. I didn't need to do the extra copying of plist files. This was on a MacBook Core2Duo 2GHz 3G/500G OS10.7.5\n", "Q: YouTube App streams much slower than YouTube mobile site on iPhone I noticed recently that the YouTube app for the iPhone (4s) streams movies significantly slower (or sometimes, not at all) compared to using Safari and the mobile YouTube website. \nI have tested this using 3g and various Wi-Fi connections. There is inconsistencies between the App and the Mobile Website on the same device over the same connection.\nWhat is the difference in technologies between these two interfaces that may be causing this, or is this just a localized problem to my device?\n\nA: The same thing is happening to mine but looking at the difference in video quality the YouTube app videos are a lot better so that could be why..\n", "Q: How to repair damaged mkv file on mac I tried Meteorite.

However, I can nudge it using the arrow keys.\nMac OS X Lion 10.7.2\nPhotoshop CS 5.5\n\nA: I had the same problem on my Mac. The problem was iCopy app in the taskbar.

Now my Pages doesn't work anymore I did this with pages because I thought that it would uninstalled it (I'm brand new to mac os). It didn't uninstalled it, but it did remove it from the list of installed applications.\nNow when I visit the Pages page in the app store, it shows that I must purchase it again. What did I do? How can I get Pages back? I bought it already and all I want to do is fix the installation. It doesn't work at all at the moment.\n\nA: So the cross in the list of installed applications actually just hides the app but does not uninstall it. When you open the app store go to Account -> Hidden purchases. It will be there.\n", "Q: iPod Nano (6th Generation) Lyrics Support I'm thinking of getting an iPod Nano (6th Generation) and I'm not sure if it has support for lyrics.\nDoes anyone know if it does?\n\nA: It certainly does; I've had one.\n", "Q: What is the current Apple policy on purchases outside the App Store? We are developing an app for a customer that will sell content. There will also be an Android and web app and they don't really want to pay Apple 30% and would rather use their own site to sell.\nFor what I've read online, I understand that it's ok to sell content for the app elsewhere, but it is not allowed to link to the store from the app. Do I understand this correctly? There was also something about prices.\nSorry, not sure if this question is more appropriate here or on StackOverflow. It's not really a coding question either.\n\nA: The rules of iTunes connect are only really available when you sign in to the service, and agree to the terms. I am not currently a developer so I don't know even if the details are protected by an NDA.\nI don't have a link to a good press article covering the current state of affairs, but my understanding and gross oversimplification of the rules are:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's OK to enable extra content if the iOS app does nothing to link to, process, enroll or advertise the paid portion of the service or app.\n\n*It's always OK to handle purchases through in-app purchase where Apple will take their cut of the sale in return for providing the accounting, customer service, billing, returns, server hardware, software and bandwidth for distribution of your app and the handling of the paid content sales. It's probably very not OK to sell in the app and not use Apple for the payment.\n\n*Newsstand apps are different and I'll let someone who knows edit in how a subscription might be different than a one time sale, but I would be surprised if it was overall different than the normal in-app purchase policy.\n\n\nIf your work for your client is to advise them, you'll really want to just spend the $99 and join and have your team participate in the developer program NDA / restricted chats and or just read the terms of iTunes Connect. If not, it's their problem and make sure your contract with them is clear as to under whom all responsibility of knowing and adhering to the Terms and Conditions fall.\n", "Q: Will the Airport Extreme card from the 2006 Mac Pro work in the 2008 Mac Pro? An Airport Extreme card that claims to work with the 2008 Mac Pro and the card that I am using in my current 2006 Mac Pro. The cards look similar and since the ram is transferable from the 2006 models to the 2008 models I was wondering if the same is true for the airport extreme card? The cards appear to be the same physically. Has anyone actually tried it before or know of a definite answer?  \n\nA: Yes it will! Just tried it with success! \nMy largest indicator that it would work was by reviewing high reputation eBay sellers who where selling similar cards and claiming a wide range of Mac Pros. \nSuccessfully transfered the Airport Extreme Card from the Mac Pro 2006 in to a Mac Pro 2008\nI have the following Airport Extreme Card that identifies itself in System Information as :\nCard Type:         AirPort Extreme  (0x14E4, 0x8C)\nFirmware Version:  Broadcom BCM43xx 1.0 (5.10.131.36.11)\n\nThe card as pictured is:\n\nInstallation Note:  There were 3 wires to choose from inside the Mac Pro (Both models), labeled 1,2,3.  The longest one I thought was for the Bluetooth module, clearly not the case in the Mac Pro 2008. Anyways, I connected the shortest wire to the top antenna port and the middle length to the lower antenna port on the Airport Extreme Card. Test working great, with this configuration and logic. This is the same logic I used when I initially installed the card in the 2006 Mac Pro as well. Not really sure what the long length cable is for as pictured below. \nI would assume this would be for a true 802.11n card since those had 3 antennas in their spec?\n\n", "Q: Can you recommend an editor for both iOS and Mac OS X designed for writers? Is there an editor designed specifically for writers of short prose? Currently I am using Microsoft Word and it is very heavy weight. \nLarge technical reports need indices, chapters, heavy formatting (provided by tools like Word and InDesign), and programmers desire all sorts of code hooks, definition lookups, and integration with other tools like Xcode or code control tools.\nI want a tool for putting out prose and haven't found good solutions for this need.\nBetter for writers means:\n\n\n*\n\n*fast - especially on older macs without SSD or large amounts of RAM\n\n*lightweight in feel as well as in visual impact\n\n\nIdeally this tool should be available for both Mac OS X and/or on an iPod Touch.\n\nA: Scrivener for OSX.\nPlan is to build an iPad/iTouch app. Developed by a writer who couldn't find an app to meet his needs.

The first time I grabbed my iPad to see if I could edit a Pages document I was working on in a Mac in another room (which could just as well have been another building/city/country), rather than leave what I was doing to get to that Mac, and the document popped up, to the character the same as what was open in Pages on the Mac, I got the silliest grin ... how many other computers produce that effect?\nThere are some differences between the iOS and OSX Pages document support, managing hyperlinks and finer typographic things like superscripts/subscripts are absent from the iOS version.  I'd be surprised if footnotes are part of the iOS Pages repertoire.  If those are a factor, it allows you to edit a copy or replace the original with the downgraded format.\nFor me, the only thing that is missing is the ability to export into HTML.\n\nA: Byword (OS X) <> DropBox <> Writing Kit (iOS)\nByword is a wonderfully simple prose editor that includes Markdown preview and exports Markdown formatted documents into a number of common formats including RTF and PDF. It also features a focus mode that keeps the line of text you're currently composing in the middle of the screen and scrolls the previous lines up—like a typewriter.\nBecause my writing workflow is Markdown based I make use of Brett Terpstra's Markdown Service Tools on the Mac, particularly the Service that allow me to quickly bring a series of Safari tabs into a Markdown document as linked references.\nI previously used Elements on iOS but recently switched to Writing Kit because of its integrated web browser for research  and the ability to quickly bring web URLs into your document. \nI save current projects to DropBox so that I can work on them from any of several Macs or from my iPad and (if absolutely necessary) iPhone.\n\nSince this answer was originally posted, Byword (iOS) has been released and Byword (OS X) was updated to include iCloud support so that documents sync automatically in near-realtime between Byword running on different devices.

I have Mac (OSX Lion) and PC (Windows 7) with a shared folder. To mount Windows shared folder I use \"Connect to Server\" in Finder. All files and folders are copied ok except for the files that begin with dot (e.g .htaccess). In Windows these files are created with hidden attribute.\nHow to copy file/folder beginning with dot without hidden attribute?\n\nA: Let's assume for this example that your \".htaccess\" file is located in the root directory of your mounted Windows share. Let's also say the Windows volume is called \"WindowsShare\". Finally, let's say you want to copy this file to your Desktop.\nOpen Terminal. Type in cd /Volumes/WindowsShare.

Besides using Windows in a virtual machine, has anyone found any type of workaround to enable Exchange 2003 access with OS X apps (Calendar/Address Book/Mail)?\n\nA: A little amplification of what \"apps\" you are specifically referring to would be helpful. Assuming your company is using Exchange 2003 SP2, you should be able to use Active Sync with Microsoft Outlook for Mac or Entourage. This should allow you to sync your contacts, email and calendar events. Beyond that an app would need to suport active sync to interact with an Exchange 2003 server natively.\n\nA: The current Outlook for Mac does not support Exchange 2003 and below, it requires at least Exchange 2007.\nEntourage will work if you have a copy of that.\nIf you don't have Entourage a program like DavMail may be the trick. I was never able to get it working properly with our Exchange server though so mileage may vary.\nPersonally I ended up using Windows Outlook in Parallels until we upgraded to Exchange 2010.

It is a religious preference, so rather than discuss why to choose one over the other, I just wanted to make you aware of both. \nAnother commercial gem is Keyboard Maestro, which is very much overkill for this sort of job (Automator is the simplest approach, as described by @Lri and @gentmatt), but if you are the sort of person who likes keyboard shortcuts to folders, you will probably find a lot to love in Keyboard Maestro. \n\nA: One option would be to create an Automator service and assign it a shortcut in the Keyboard preferences.\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    reopen\n    activate\n    set p to (system attribute \"HOME\") & \"/Downloads/\"\n    set target of Finder window 1 to POSIX file p\nend tell\n\nYou could also save the script to ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Finder/ with AppleScript Editor and use FastScripts to assign the shortcut.\n\nA: Butler rules for this type of thing and MUCH more.\n", "Q: How to setup mail when using iCloud plus 2 external mail accounts I believe that as a user of 2 iMacs , 1 iphones and one iPad the best is to use my xx@me.com  account on iCloud as main account and alias my other external accounts to xx@me.com\nThe 2 external accounts are pol@myname.lu     and po1@myname.eu\nCan anybody confirm this approach or tell me what's better?!\nThanks all!\nPol\n\nA: What I do is forward my other mail accounts to my @me.com address.\n", "Q: Some iPhone/iPad photos do not appear on the map of iPhoto It happens to me sometimes that using iPhone or iPad, I take pictures in open air environments, but later, when photos are exported to iPhoto, they do not appear on the Map. What could be the cause?\n\nA: You can add or correct wrong GPS-data to your photo with the app iMetaPhoto.\nI had the same problem, I took 4 photos at the same location, but only the last photo was correctly geotagged. Wit iMetaPhoto you can take this correct GPS-data and save it to the wrong ones.\n\nA: Most likely the device did not have a GPS fix at the time you took the picture.  If I really want a photo to have a location tag, I bring up the map application and wait for it to get a precise fix before taking the picture.  This can take up to a minute, so you have to plan ahead if you really want an accurate GPS tag.  \nNote that if you don't do that, the photo may still be tagged and that tag might be correct, or it might be completely wrong.  If the device has not moved much since it last ran a location aware app, or if the photo app has been running for a minute or two, then it may have enough of a fix to generate an accurate tag.  Or it might wrongly think it has enough of a fix and generate a completely incorrect tag.  Running the mapping program is just a way to improve the odds of an accurate tag.\n\nA: The Map function requires that the photos be tagged with GPS co-ordinates, either these photos do not have any recorded in the metadata, or as is sometimes the case, GPS info is wrong.\nSelect a problematic photo in iPhoto and \"Show Photo Info\", the GPS co-ordinates appear under the Exposure tab as:\n\n\n*\n\n*GPS Latitude\n\n*GPS Longitude\n\n*GPS Altitude (not always present)\n\n", "Q: Has Apple solved the problem of new iPods not charging on old Bose docks? New ipod classic (purchased 2-25-12 from Target) DOES charge on our OLD Bose dock (pleasant surprise) whereas ipods purchased 1-2 years ago do not.  I am vaguely aware that the non-charging situation was deliberate by Apple (something about the pins) to avoid the possibility of the old Bose dock \"zapping\" the ipod (pardon my lack of correct tech lingo).  We even bought a new Bose dock to solve the problem, but kept the old one too.  Now, my daughters brand new ipod classic charges in the OLD dock!  Has anyone else experienced this and/or know what is going on? Thanks!\n\nA: The difference you're referring to is the ability to charge over the FireWire pins, which Apple removed from most iPods/iPhones several years ago.\nHowever, as you've discovered, iPod Classics are still able to charge via FireWire. I expect this functionality could be removed at any revision, but for now, consider yourself lucky ;)\n", "Q: Sharing Bluetooth Keyboard and Mouse I know \"teleport\" will work between two Macs, but is there a way to share a keyboard and mouse between a Mac Mini and an older Dell PC? I'm asking because I received a Mac Mini and iPad for Christmas but still need the PC until I get familiar with the Apples and start tranfering stuff to them. I know just enough about computers to be dangerous, viz-- I just bought a Logitec MX 5500 Desktop with software for the PC with a USB Bluetooth dongle and it does work with the Mac Mini, but I didn't realize you cannot pair with more than one computer even if the other is off.\nMy son says I can do it with something called a Bluetooth KVM, is this true?\nI can use the same monitor because it has both digital and analog inputs and is easily switchable.\n\nA: If you have a local network you can use Synergy to share Bluetooth mice and keyboards with up to 5 computers. \n\nSynergy lets you easily share your mouse and keyboard between multiple\n  computers on your desk, and it's Free and Open Source. Just move your\n  mouse off the edge of one computer's screen on to another. You can\n  even share all of your clipboards. All you need is a network\n  connection. Synergy is cross-platform (works on Windows, Mac OS X and\n  Linux).\n\nHere is a good implementation for Mac and Linux: http://code.google.com/p/quicksynergy/\n\nA: If you have a monitor for each, you can control both with Synergy over your network.\nHere's a good example.\nhttp://www.mattcutts.com/blog/how-to-configure-synergy-in-six-steps/\nYou'd use one keyboard and mouse connected to your PC, and then via Synergy when you move your mouse off the PC monitor, it will change focus to the Mac. It's a good setup if you've got the monitors.\nIf you haven't got a second monitor, give VNC a shot. You would use \"Screen Sharing\" from the mac mini, and connect with WinVNC from your Dell. A window will appear that has your mac's desktop on it.\nIf you can't be bothered with VNC, use LogMeIn Free. https://secure.logmein.com/\nWorks for PC/Mac, and you can access it from anywhere in the world!\n", "Q: How do I copy a calendar from one iCloud account to another? I had to stop using my original iCloud account (because of an uncorrectable configuration mistake I made) and create a new one.  I'd like to move the contents of the Calendar to the new account. \nI tried exporting each calendar from iCal on my Mac (creating .ics files), switching to my new iCloud account, and then importing those files into iCal, but the import process simply hung.\nExporting as an iCal Archive and then importing doesn't work, because the archive preserves info about what iCloud account it's tied to.\nI'd appreciate any help!  Thanks.\n\nA: If it appeared to hang (rather than throwing an error) how long did you let it run?  I found that iCloud took rather longer to import a .ics file of only a few hundred KB than my available raw upload speed would suggest: 1-2 orders of magnitude longer!\nIf it really won't complete, try importing .ics file into a local Mac calendar first - it may not work any better but it's faster if your calendar is large; and just maybe iCal will be able clean up the calendar or continue past a bad entry that stops iCloud.  \nIf that doesn't work (and you're patient!) you can try exporting & deleting, then importing to another calendar, half your events, then half the remainder, etc., til one segment fails to import. Now that you know which half contains the error, export, then import, the other half of the remaining events.  Now repeat the halving process with the events left in the source calendar.  When you get down to only a few remaining events (that must include the bad one), enter the rest by hand.\nNow export that reconstructed calendar and upload it iCloud.\n", "Q: Does Apple's wireless keyboard work cross-platform such as in Ubuntu, Windows and *ixes? My friend bought me the mStand here and it is quite cool passive heat conductor, placing the screen to the right level and I can use it for books etc besides laptops. It requires a wireless kbd and the only such kbd I would tolerate is probably by Apple (because it is small and function at least in Mac). Now I have different laptops such as Ubuntus, Windows and Linuxes. Can I use this keyboard with them also through Bluetooth?\n\nA: Sure, there's nothing keeping it from working with Windows other than the fact that it's missing some keys. I'm not sure if it's compatible with the various distros of Linux, but you can try it out and look on their associated forums.\nAlso, for Windows, be sure to check this out:  http://www.kudzuworld.com/blogs/Tech/20080101.EN.aspx\n", "Q: How to convert a RAW 16-bit audio file to something else on Mac?

On closer examination, it would appear that something is catching the disks around the middle of the entrance of the SuperDrive which is preventing them from simply gliding in as they used to. I'm unsure whether its something broken, or perhaps a locking mechanism that has somehow got stuck. I did think that something might be stuck in there, but I am not missing any DVDs and I have tried restarting holding down the mouse button to eject, and while it makes the eject noise (which sounds healthy), nothing comes out.\nI have tried all the obvious things - resetting the PRAM and SMC, to no avail.\nI don't imagine that anyone has a fix for this as its probably a physical problem, but I thought I'd try as I am not currently near an Apple shop and I don't particularly want to be without my computer for too long, so I'd rather attempt to find a fix myself before doing anything else.\n\nA: I just had this problem with my 17\" mbp early 2009.\nODD was blocked like there was disc already in, but of course there wasn't.\nTried many times SMC & PRAM reset and Force shutdown. Sometimes the drive clicked and I managed to insert one disc, which was read just fine.\nBut after ejecting it, the block was again there.\nThen googled some more and typed \"drutil eject internal\" few times in terminal and all was OK again.\n\nA: Take a photo of (or examine closely) the side of the MacBook - usually a difficult insertion is caused by a bend in the body. Most photos of iPhone 4 quality will show that clearly. The eject lever can also flip into the closed position, so in that case you'll need to get inside the drive mechanism itself to reset the mechanism or replace the drive.\nThe repair for this is quite rapid, and if the shop has your drive in stock, ask about waiting for the repair if possible. Worst case they can diagnose what it needs and confirm the part and you can ship the Mac for repair at a time more convenient to you.\n\nA: I don't think it will make the eject noise unless the drive is registering that something is in there (my 2011 doesn't, tried holding eject button on restart). Do you have any children in the house? You may not be missing any DVDs but how about business cards or other portable objects?  \nI would reach for the screwdrivers, and so armed go look at the Unibody MacBook Pro teardown at iFixit. I hope I've linked the right guide but you should be able to find the right one if it is not. Once you have the optical device removed it should be easy to clear whatever is in there. Fortunately the optical drive is fairly easy to access.\nYou will at least be able to decide whether the drive is out of alignment with the external slot, or whether the drive mechanism has a fault.\n\nA: Here's what worked for me on a 2009 17\" MBP:  As suggested above, and with the computer turned on it's end with the disc drive in the air, I forced a disc in - not all the way, only as far that I could still pull it out manually, I pulled it out and nothing changed, but I then opened Terminal (located in Utilities folder, which is inside the Applications folder) and typed \"drutil eject\" and hit return.  The first time, I heard a click, but the drive didn't open.  I typed it again and hit return and this time I heard a click and the drive did open.\nUpon reflection, this probably would have also worked while the disc was forced in, or if I had pushed it in all the way.\n\nA: I now had the same issue. I read all the answers here. This worked for me: I typed \"drutil eject\" in Terminal several times. Every time the sound from the drive was slightly different as if the mechanism was stuck but starting to get loose. At the same time I gently pushed a disc inside the drive to help the mechanism to loosen. Suddenly the disc slipped without any force in and everything now works fine. I used the \"drutil eject\" command 11 times.\n\nA: shut down the Mac. Restart holding down the trackpad.... worked for me.\n\nA: No body is going to like my answer. But after typing the command into terminal and it not working, i just took a blank dvd disc (that i don't care about) and just forced it into the drive. I know, I know, you bought a $$$$$ premium laptop, why do something so risky. But honestly, there is just a mechanism preventing the addition of new media in the drive bay because it thinks something is already in there. You gotta force the dvd up and wedge it in there so that the latch forcibly opens when you pull the disc back out. Your force the disc in, it catches the lip of the mechanism blocking entry, and when you pull the disc back out, it pulls open the flap. Not sure if anyone will do this, but it worked for me. No issues/sounds afterwards. \nOf course it goes without saying, never force/shove a disc in when its normally working. It is delicate in the drive bay and you don't want to scratch the optical lense in there. We are just trying to get the flap to open, so only putting half the disc in there at most is sufficient to open it up.\n", "Q: Restoring iPhone contacts from backup immediately undoes itself By accident, I deleted most of my contacts on my iPhone. They were also on another device, and were deleted from that one as well when they were deleted off of the iPhone. I restored the iPhone from a backup and they appeared for a minute…then disappeared again. I tried to restore it from the backup again and the same thing happened.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: It is possible that, after restore, you are syncing your iPhone with some source where the contacts have been deleted as well. If so, you will need to stop syncing and/or restore the contacts in that place as well.\n\nA: There are some apps that allow you to extract the contacts from the iOS backup and to restore it on your idevice like ibackupbot or maybe one of these apps. \nHope it helps. http://iphone-contacts.blogspot.com/#!/2012/02/iphone-contacts-apps.html\n\nA: You can also try to check if your data shows up in your backup, using the iPhone Backup Extractor tool at iphonebackupextractor.com. Then you can try to recover it with this tool and importing back to your phone. Hope this helps.\n\nA: Try these steps\n\n\n*\n\n*export as vcard (using iBot)\n\n*Sign in to your iCloud account (if you don't have one, make one)\n\n*upload the vcard to your iCloud account\n\n*sign in to your iCloud on your phone and sync\n\n", "Q: LaunchBar script that returns the path of a folder \"dropped\" on it I want to make a LaunchBar script that displays in a dialog the path of a file or folder that's chosen in the first pane and then \"dropped\" on a script.

Files will be passed to the script’s open() handler, URLs will be passed to the handle_string() handler.\n\nA: The open() handler gets passed an alias (which is a kind of a pointer to a file or folder). You can then simply convert the alias to text, but it will show you the path with colons as separators (e.g. \"Macintosh HD:Users:Username:Documents:Folder:\").\nUse POSIX path of to convert it to a UNIX-style path with \"/\" separators, and if you want to paste it into Terminal, especially if the path has spaces in it, you should use quoted form of to properly enclose it in quotes.\nThe following script works with both folders and files for me, when an item is passed to it via LaunchBar:\non open (thisItem)\n    display dialog (thisItem as text) -- alias\n    display dialog quoted form of POSIX path of thisItem -- POSIX path\nend open\n\n\nA: I see you know about LaunchBar's \"large type\" feature -- did you know you can send selected text to it with the \"Display in Large Type\" action?

I am using an iPod touch, but my friend has an iPhone and is in an area where they have Wi-Fi access.  My question is, does that \"call\" count toward data or voice minutes, or is it unlimited and free as it's all going over Wi-Fi?\n\nA: According to Apple Support:\n\nCheck that each person has an active Wi-Fi connection.\n\nSince both parties must use Wi-fi, no cellular data or voice usage will be charged.\nMore information can be found in this Apple.SE post, as it may be possible to use Facetime over 3G if the phone is jailbroken.\n\nA: No cellular data is supposed to be used when accessing FaceTime in an area with wifi. But in order to be sure of this it's smart to turn off cellular data in your settings to avoid any fishy usage activity. \nIt's located in Settings>General>Celullar.\n\nA: It is unlimited and free because it is over wifi.

There are way too many app icons on my dock.  Is there a way to add drawers of apps on the dock so each drawer contains a list of apps?\n\nA: While the Dock doesn't have the concept of \"folders\" for the apps that are pinned to or running in it, as of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard the Stacks feature can provide something similar.\nDragging the Applications folder from the Finder into the \"Stacks section\" (right of the white-dashed line) of the Dock will add it as a Stack. You can then click the folder to see something like this:\n\nIf you want subsets of your Applications as separate Stacks, you can create folders for each somewhere in your filesystem, and add aliases for the desired applications. (Note that dragging an app from the Applications folder to another folder makes an alias by default. Convenient!)\nThe results look like this:\n\nAll this being said, an alternative if you have OS X 10.7 Lion is to use Launchpad to organize and access your apps, keeping the contents of your Dock as minimal as possible.\n\nA: I realize this question was asked awhile back, but if someone with a newer OS stumbles upon it, here's another trick you can try.\nAdd comments or tags to the applications you want to group, making a new Smart Folder in /Applications, and then setting the search criteria to be the comment or tag you chose. Then, save the search, which adds it to your Finder sidebar. \nFrom there, right click on the new Finder sidebar item, and choose 'Add to Dock'. Note that some built-in applications like Safari won't allow you to modify tags or comments. But, that's when you just make an alias and add the tag or comment to it, instead.\n\n\n", "Q: How to read .awz ebooks on Macbook Pro (Mac OS X 10.6.8)? How to read .awz ebooks (Kindle format) on Macbook Pro (Mac OS X 10.6.8)?\nCan it be converted to PDF with hyperlinks properly supported?\n\nA: I believe the easiest way to read a Kindle ebook on your Mac is to download Amazon's application for that purpose (either from their site or the Mac App Store). As Thilo points out in the comments, however, a DRMed Kindle title can only be read on the device which downloaded it, so moving the .azw to your Mac won't help. Instead, assuming this is a book you acquired from Amazon's store, you can download another copy and have it sent to the Kindle app on your Mac.\nAs for converting to PDF, .azw files are DRM-protected Mobipocket files. Assuming you can remove the DRM somehow, there are many resources online that can do .mobi -> PDF conversion.\n", "Q: You don't exist, go away!

I've been poking around with dscl, and everything seems normal – I can see all data on my own user – but I am not very familiar with directory services, so I may well have missed something. (How do I lookup myself by uid using dscl?)\nSo my question is twofold: Does this problem ring a bell? My google-fu is not up to finding anything relevant. And can you suggest things to try to get a further handle on the problem, tests to run, things to look for?\nWhile I have been typing in this question, today's event ended, and I exist once more. So it may well be a week or more before my next chance to debug this. I'm on OS X 10.7.3, btw, on a MacBook Pro.\n\nA: This does indeed ring a bell, as I've seen similar issues on a variety of systems ranging from 10.3 through 10.6.  Here are some of the causes I've observed, in no particular order.\n\n\n*\n\n*Incorrect DNS server addresses in the network configuration\n\n*Incorrect LDAP server or server aliases (if the machine is part of an LDAP or OpenDirectory network)\n\n*Faulty PAM modules (if you have installed third-party software which uses PAM or installs into /etc/pam.d)\n\n*Mixing Local/BSD accounts with LDAP/OpenDirectory accounts.  This can happen if you have accounts which have been repeated migrated across many versions.\n\n*Account GUIDs becoming out-of-sync due to migration or other corruption of the OpenDirectory database.\n\n*Note that it can take up to a minute after the machine wakes from sleep or finishes booting before the authentication system is fully operational.  Network connectivity issues can delay this substantially, especially if the system is part of an LDAP/OpenDirectory network.\n\n\nSince you've been migrating accounts, try setting up a fresh new account and see if the problem occurs there.  It may be possible to fix the problem by digging into the OpenDirectory database, but it may be easier to just recreate the problem account from scratch.\nUpdate\nSince the UID was changed at some point in the past for NFS reasons, it is likely that the GUID and UID are out-of-sync.  Try the following Terminal commands to see if unix and Directory Services are on the same page:\ndscl . -read /Users/sbnoble GeneratedUID\ndscl . -read /Users/sbnoble UniqueID\nid\n\nThe UID output by \"UniqueID\" and \"id\" should match each other and the NFS UID you expect.\n", "Q: Ejecting USB-Partitions on boot - works but not entirely I have an USB drive with four partitions. SuperDuper uses these partitions to back up my mac. Since SuperDuper is scheduled, I have the USB drive constantly connected. But quite frankly the noise of the USB drive is driving me nuts. So I eject the partitions every time I boot the mac up. SuperDuper is configured so that it mounts the partition when it is scheduled to back up and unmounts it again. \nI am trying to find a way so that I do not have to manually eject the partitions. I have two methods that work. I edited the /etc/fstab file with the UUIDs and prevent the partitions from mounting and I tried the method of making a logon script that calls a \"do shell script \"diskutil unmount.....\"\". Both methods work. The partitions do not get mounted. BUT the drive motor does not \"turn off\". I have to go into Disk Utility and eject the unmounted (light-gray) drive again for the USB drives motor to be quiet. It doesn't really matter which one of the four drives I choose to eject again, ejecting one does the trick.\nI also noticed that if I automatically eject three of the drives on boot and then manually eject the fourth one that the USB drive powers down. So there seems to be a difference between ejecting via script and right-mouse click \"eject\".\nDoes anyone know why this is? Is there a way to eject the partitions so that the USB drive understands this?\nThanks \n\nA: As Harald suggested the solution is to use \"diskutil eject\" not unmount. \nFor anyone else looking at this thread, my login script looks like this:\ndelay 5\ntry\n   do shell script \"diskutil eject \\\"/Volumes/MYPARTITION\\\"\"\nend try\n\nThanks again!\n", "Q: Spanish to English and English to Spanish dictionary for Dictionary app? For quite a while now, I have been looking for English and Spanish conversion dictionaries (both ways) for Apple's native Dictionary application. So far I have not had any success.  \nIs there any free, decent quality solution such as \"New Oxford American Dictionary\" and \"Dictionnaire de l'Académie Française\"? \nAny links or information would be highly appreciated.\n\nA: Look at this link: clasqm's virtual home. Here you can find the requested \"eng-esp / esp-eng\" dictionaries.\n\nA: As a follow-up to ccpizza's answer, here's what you need as of today:\n\n\n*\n\n*Auxiliary Tools for Xcode: http://developer.apple.com/downloads\nYou need an Apple Developer account to get that.\nOnce you downloaded it, you can just create a new folder at /Developer/Extras and copy the Dictionary Development Kit folder from the Auxiliary Tools there.\n\n*Python. This might be preinstalled.\n\n*beautifulsoup. Fire up a Terminal and launch this command:\nsudo easy_install beautifulsoup4\n\n*pyglossary: https://github.com/ilius/pyglossary\nNow you can download a dictionary in any format pyglossary can read. All English - X Babylon dictionaries are here: http://www.babylon.com/free-dictionaries/languages/english\nNow do what ccpizza said. I had to change the command a bit to\npython pyglossary.pyw --read-options=resPath=OtherResources --write-format=AppleDict webster.bgl webster.xml\nmake\nmake install\n\nNote that the output name (in this case \"webster\") will be the dictionaries name in Dictionary.app's toolbar; I used Spanish.xml for the Spanish dictionary. The last command will automatically install the dictionary file, so you can then enable it in Dictionary.app's preferences.\n\nA: The latest MacOS versions already include Spanish dictionaries which can be enabled in preferences in the Dictionary.app (⌘+,).\nThe answer below is for converting and installing third-party dictionaries from other popular formats.\nTo create a dictionary for the built-in OS X Dictionary.app you will first need pyglossary to convert to the AppleDict format from the input format which can be ABBYY Lingvo DSL, Babylon BGL, Stardict IFO, etc (see all supported formats).\nOnce the AppleDict source XML is generated, the Apple Dictionary Development Kit is used to generate the native binary files that the Dictionary.app can use.\nProceed as follows:\nInstalling dependencies\n\n*\n\n*Install Xcode command line tools:\n xcode-select --install\n\n\n\n*Install the Additional Tools for Xcode from https://developer.apple.com/download/ (search with  )— you'll need to login with your iCloud or Apple Developer account. Mount the DMG file by double-clicking it in Finder, and copy the folder Dictionary Development Kit to /Developer/Extras (as root) (or to ~/Developer/Extras as a normal user as pointed out by richard-möhn):\n mkdir -p ~/Developer/Extras/\n cp -r '/Volumes/Additional Tools/Utilities/' ~/Developer/Extras\n\n\n\n*Install Python 3 via homebrew (OS X comes with Python 2.x preinstalled):\n brew install python3\n\n\n\n*Checkout the pyglossary project:\n mkdir -p ~/projects\n git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ilius/pyglossary.git ~/projects/pyglossary\n\n\n\n*Install lxml and BeautifulSoup, the parsers that pyglossary depends on:\n pip3 install lxml beautifulsoup4\n\nNow everything is ready to do the actual conversion.\nPerforming the Conversion\n\n*\n\n*Convert the source dictionary (in this case Babylon BGL) to AppleDict:\n python3 pyglossary.pyw --read-options=resPath=OtherResources --write-format=AppleDict webster.bgl webster.xml\n\n\nNOTE: This operation can take significant time if the dictionary is big.\n\n\n\n*Compile the generated AppleDict sources to OS X Dictionary.app binary files. Pyglossary creates the AppleDict sources in a subfolder named the same as the source file.\n\n\n\nOPTIONAL: By default the dictionary name will be derived from the file name of the input file. If you want to modify the name to something else then open Makefile in a text editor, and set the title in the DICT_NAME variable (make sure you include the quotes).\n\n    cd webster ### subdir name is derived from the source file\n    make\n    make install\n\n\nNOTE: make can take significant time if the dictionary is big. For huge dictionaries it can take over 10 minutes.\n\nmake install copies the generated dictionary to ~/Library/Dictionaries.\nNow if you restart the dictionary app and and open preferences (⌘+,) the new dictionary will appear in the list. Click the checkbox to enable it.\nOther formats, for example ABBYY Lingvo DSL require more steps such as re-encoding from UTF-16 to UTF-8. Here is a wrapper script for DSL to AppleDict conversion.\nHere are some Free dictionaries in Babylon BGL format. There are also literally hundreds of dictionaries available in DICTD, Stardict and ABBYY Lingvo DSL formats.\nSee also:\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/ilius/pyglossary/blob/master/doc/apple.md\n\nA: Starting with at least El Capitan, Apple provides one of these:\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to find the timestamp of a photo in an iPhone4, without syncing with a computer?

I usually have my iPhone in \"vibrate mode\" (ringtone off, vibrate on). However, I'd like to additionally have it turn vibrate mode off automatically between for example 11 PM and 7 AM because I don't want to be awakened (or have my wife woken up) by some spam mail that arrives at 2 AM.\nSome apps allow to define periods where notifications are suppressed, but it seems the Notification center (or at least the Mail app) does not. Is there any way to achieve this (on a non-jailbroken iPhone)? \nI know I can turn it off manually in Preferences, but that's cumbersome, and I'm going to forget either to turn it off or to turn it back on.\n\nA: EDIT:\nThis is a feature in iOS 6. You can schedule notification suppression by opening the Settings app > Notifications > Do not disturb.\nOriginal Post:\nUnfortunately, there is no native way to do that in iOS 5.\nLike you thought, the notification center, currently does not allow customization in that way. I think Apple could have added features similar to that one, but have chosen not to, either because they haven't wanted to take the time (but that hasn't seemed to stop them in the past), or because they have a big focus on keeping things simple.\n", "Q: Is it safer to use a guest account when streaming from projectfreetv?

Is this wishful thinking or do you think it helps to do this? Thanks so much!\n\nA: In this Top 10 list (for Mac Internet security), one recommendation is:\n\nSpecial bonus item (for advanced users):\nConsider running your Mac as a non-administrative user most of the time. This is an advanced technique that provides few immediate\n  benefits, but, similar to anti-virus applications, acts as \"insurance\"\n  by limiting any damage that could result from a security breach.\n  Someone gaining access to your machine would still have access to many\n  of your files, but not to most of the underlying machine and OS\n  itself. The easiest way to run as a non-admin user is to create a new,\n  administrative account and then change your normally used account to a\n  non-administrative one.\n\nThis step would be part of a layered security approach, and probably could be applied to any OS - one wouldn't normally use an admin/root account in Linux, for example.

This is a similar question to this one, but since I can't tell how well that translates to the iPhone, I'm asking it again. \nI've recently been abroad on holiday, and with very expensive data roaming charges, it's very tempting to use an open wifi, for example for downloading app updates. I expect that communication with the App Store goes over HTTPS, so it should be safe entering my iTunes password there, right? \nI know the risks of using HTTP over an unencrypted wifi, but I have no idea what protocols other apps besides Safari use. Anything I need to be aware of?\nWill using a VPN client to connect to my university's network effectively make my connection secure?\n\nA: The iTunes Store uses HTTPS for most of it (if not all), at least that's how it was when I checked. \nRegarding your specific question, you have to consider the iPhone is another regular device, albeit full of limitations in the tweaking department, it still runs a OS X variant, with derived UNIX parts, etc. So for the sake of this question, let's say your iPhone is a computer running some form of Unix Operating System; with that in mind, all the security risks that affect a computer are valid. Should the iPhone (and iOS) have a remote vulnerability, you would be exposed, just like your Macbook or your Windows computer or even your Linux Box. \nUsing 'open' Wi-Fi means anyone can log in and inspect the traffic. Anyone trying to do malicious stuff will be eavesdropping and listing for traffic in the network. \nIf you send an email, it will likely be unencrypted and visible. If you use IM (MSN, Yahoo, iChat/AIM, Jabber, etc.) you are likely not encrypted either (nor using a secure channel by default). \nWhen using Safari, anything that doesn't go though some form of HTTPS is visible. Cookies and Data, with all the associated risks. \nSo as you can see, and excluding particular OS vulnerabilities, we're very exposed when using open networks. Most people doesn't really care or know but the risks are there (and so are the malicious users) :)\nConnecting through a VPN will help with your traffic, but I have never used a VPN on an iPhone and thus I don't know what the capabilities of that are. \n\nA: Considering that SSL has been cracked (and HTTPS relies on it), the biggest risk is theft of private data which could result in: loss of money, privacy violation, harrassment/stalking/blackmailing etc.\nAlso, most websites/apps (hint: POP3 Mail) might not even use HTTPS and transfer clear-text information. I would recommend at least some sort of secure tunneling for your traffic (there are services offering VPN tunneling for anonymity/privacy).\nIt is also possible (though I've seen no exploit demonstrated using a free wifi for a man-in-the-middle attack) to get an iDevice infected or rootkitted with harmful software which otherwise could not reach that device. This will result in further, long term losses (from private data to media, phone recordings). For the paranoid, this eHow article is a good starting point.\n\nA: To complement both valid answers (Martin Marconcini and Vlad), I want to point out that you can massively improve your situation, by using an encrypted VPN connection.\nBy doing so, you don't have to care much about if you still have apps that send unencrypted data or metadata. Just every packet that you exchange through an unsecured wireless network will be encrypted. But be aware, the encryption of previously unencrypted data will only last until it reaches your VPN server. After that, your data will look like you put it into your VPN tunnel. Nevertheless, you can atleast be sure that eavesdropper from the unsecured WiFi won't be able to see unencrypted data.\n", "Q: Do I need to take special steps to fully restore an iPhone after jailbreaking it? I heard that the iPhone has some sort of counter that counts every unauthorized connect or something like that, and with said counter, Apple Geniuses can tell if it has been jailbroken and they won't fix it. I was also told that when you perform a restore on the iPhone, the counter is saved so anyone can tell if it's been jailbroken even after restore.\nIs there a way to fully restore the iPhone and leave no \"fingerprints\" behind ?\n\nA: This is the first I hear about this so-called \"counter\". I don't believe in such and I'm pretty sure when you restore an iPhone using DFU modus, the iPhone is completely wiped clean.   \nAs a matter of facts, I've jailbroken all my iPhones so far and passed by the Apple Genius bar several times. Once I even forgot to restore the device when asking a Genius for help. And he just smiled at me and said \"jailbreak, right? What's your favorite app?\" :)\nSo, no. I don't think there is such a counter and you're safe with a DFU Full restore.\n", "Q: Reset the password for a user when Snow Leopard is running as a VM?

My Dad wants to be able to sync his iCal calendar across a Lion MBP, a Leopard MB, and an iPad running iOS 5. Since the Leopard MB doesn't support iCloud, I can't use that. How can I sync an iCal calendar across all these devices?\nI've tried to use Google Calendar, but with no success. Maybe it's the way I'm importing it, but I can't get the colors to show up correctly in iCal. When I link iCal to Google Calendar, I want the calendars to look the same in the sidebar. It is a bit confusing with out a screenshot, but I will post a screenshot as soon as I have my Dad's laptop.\n\nA: I suggest you use Google Calendar (CalDav). You can import these into iCal (both on iPad and Mac). It sync automatically too, so you can have all iCloud-benefits.\nI use it with my girlfriend (who is, sadly enough a windows user) and with my company PC. It works like a charm!\n\nA: I have found a suitable work around that I have been using for a couple of months\nWhile using iCal on a Mac running Snow Leopard, I needed to add an account to iCal. This account would point to iCloud and sync with it.\nSo, open Preferences and select accounts, enter the add account window by hitting +.\nthis takes you to:\n\nYou need to choose CalDav and enter your Apple ID email address (not your .me.com email address created when you signed up for iCloud)\nenter in your password and the server name which in most cases is p06-caldav.icloud.com\nOnce this has been added you will need to uncheck some of the calendars in the 'on my mac' menu.\n\nA: I assume you can make an iCloud account with either the MBP/Lion or the iPad/ios5.  Do that, if you haven't. Then read this article that describes connecting to your iCloud calendar to Snow Leopard using CalDAV.  \nThe gist of it is that you run a quick experiment that helps you determine which iCloud server your calendar is on, and then create a link to that account from your iCal.  I don't have a Leopard here to test with, but it does work in Snow Leopard, which, as of Feb 2012, also doesn't support iCloud, so it seems worth a try.\nEdit: It seems I failed to link to the article; that link is present now.

This is great for me because my iPhone is generally pretty full, so as I add new music/apps/podcasts, I can go back through and delete stuff I no longer listen to in order to free up space.\nHowever - when I sync my iPhone with iTunes, it copies everything I deleted right back! It must see that I have music on the computer that I've told it to sync, recognizes that those files aren't on the device, and copies them back over.\nIs it me, or is this a bug? What would be the purpose of being able to delete files directly from the device if they get copied back over every time you sync?\n\nA: You will need to use the manually manage music and videos option - otherwise, as you've already experienced, a sync will restore the deleted music to your device.\nSteps for doing this are available at this Apple Support KB:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Connect the device to your computer.\n  \n*Open iTunes.\n  \n*Select iPhone, iPad, or iPod in the Devices list.\n  \n*Click the Summary tab and select \"Manually manage music and videos\".\n  \n*Click Apply.\n  \n*Even when you have enabled manual management, you can still sync some content automatically.

I have a Wii Remote and a mid-2011 MacBook Air. What do I do to pair the Wii remote with the Air, and what software can accept input from this Bluetooth device and send it to Keynote?\nI'm looking for much more than a link to a piece of software. What software do you use, how do you go about setting up the pairing, and how do you go about using the Wii remote?\n\nA: I believe that you'll need to download Darwiin Remote form here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/darwiin-remote/. This software will allow communication between the Wii Remote and your computer.\nI haven't played with this for a long time, but I believe that when I did this app allows the Wii Remote to act as your mouse and provide direct interaction with the system (I used a candle to provide the required infrared source for tracking).\n\nA: Remote Buddy supports using a Wii remote to control a Mac and lists Keynote as a controllable application. You can also customise button-presses to perform a range of different actions. Although I've never tried it with a Wii remote, I do use it with an Apple remote to control a Mac Mini as a media centre and its a great piece of software. \nThe iospirit FAQ's contain information on setting up and pairing the Wii remote. Once paired you should be able to use the Mapping tab to assign functions to the buttons, or pick from a standard set of modifiable 'behaviours'.\n", "Q: Is there a Terminal-like app for iOS? I am looking for an app that has some of the same functionality (ssh specifically) as the Terminal application on the desktop. What different apps exist for iOS that have this functionality?\n\nA: There are plenty of SSH apps for remote connections (see Matt's answer), but it is likely impossible that a local Terminal-like app could ever exist for the iOS device itself. The three main reasons would likely be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Numerous bash builtins and GNU/BSD utilities (ls, cp, mv, cd, even echo) would be completely disallowed because of the inability to directly access the filesystem, I believe this even extends to arbitrary access into the sandboxed directories too.\n\n*License incompatibility. This is only relevant to Bash, which is most likely the shell you use (the actual functional/interactive part of a terminal program), Bash is licensed GNU v3 which is known from previous incidents to be completely incompatible with Apple's App Store terms. Though there are numerous alternatives that appear to allow distribution/existence on the app store, for example: tcsh and zsh.\n\n*A terminal is almost worthless without 3rd party/command line applications. SSH? 3rd party binary. grep? 3rd party application. vim, svn, curl, ping, all 3rd party binaries. A terminal app would have to ship all of these, and would be incredibly difficult to ensure appropriate licensing with all of them. Not to even say how Apple would feel about so many binaries stuffed in an application bundle.\n\nA: If you are willing to jailbreak, there is MobileTerminal, which together with jailbreaking, gives you many of the common GNU utilities that operate directly on the iOS device's filesystem.\nIt would be a fair bit or work, though, as the version of MobileTerminal available through Cydia (the jailbreak App store) is out of date, and doesn't work on many devices. You would probably have to compile + install the current version from it's sources.\n\nA: It's worth mentioning you can have a proper local UNIX shell if you jailbreak your device, and there are a few apps available for it.\nI've never done it myself, perhaps someone who has can edit my answer to include more details.\n\nA: Prompt for iOS\nPrompt allows you to remotely SSH into another machine. Without jailbreaking, there is no way to use Terminal to access your file system. However, I've found that if you do jailbreak your phone and want to use Prompt as a Terminal, you can set it to SSH to server 127.0.0.1 and authenticate with the standard iPhone root credentials. \nRemoter: Remote Desktop (VNC) for iOS\nThis app does basically the same thing just a little differently. By default it allows a VNC connection for screen sharing, but it has different add ons that you can purchase that allow SSH, Telnet, and RDP.\n\nA: iTerminal for iOS\nNot an unmitigated joy, in terms of UX, but it gets the ssh / telnet job done.\n\nA: OpenTerm\n\nOpenTerm is a sandboxed Command Line Interface for iOS\n\n\n\n\n\nA: *\n\n*https://github.com/blinksh/blink is an SSH/MOSH client\n\n\n*https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell is a custom shell that has some local unix commands (https://github.com/holzschu/a-Shell-commands)\n\n\n*https://github.com/ish-app/ish uses emulation to run a full Linux including any shell you want (it's slow and iOS kills it so you can't rely on it for long background commands)\n", "Q: iCal can't add event invitations to iCloud calendars When someone sends me an iCal event invitation over email, I can't seem to properly add it to a calendar I'm storing on iCloud and accessing via CalDAV. \nAfter accepting the invite, I get the error \"https://p06-caldav.icloud.com:443/150624888/principal/ is not a location that supports this request.\" and I must choose \"Revert\" or \"Go to server..\". Sometimes, hitting \"Revert\" will keep the event in my calendar until the next update, when it will vanish. Hitting \"Go to server\" will immediately remove the event from my calendar and act like I never saw the event invitation in my email. \nIf I try to duplicate the event and store it on my mac instead of on iCloud, iCal thinks that I've created a new event and proceeds to email everyone who was invited. \nQuite annoying, and embarrassing. Anyone know a fix?\n\nA: Apple discussion boards point to a name collision between calendar or reminder lists:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3384144\nTry deleting or renaming the Reminder list on icloud.com (after backing up reminders)\n", "Q: How can I force my iPad to lock? There are certain times when I would like to be able to force my iPad to go to passcode lock mode immediately, rather than waiting for the usual 15-minute timeout. \nI currently have \"require passcode after\" set to 15 minutes. There is also an 'immediately' setting, which requires a passcode every time that the device is brought out of sleep mode, no matter how much time the device was asleep. \nI am wondering if there is a way to put the iPad into 'require passcode immediately' mode on a one-time basis, without changing the 15-minute default that I have in settings. The instances where I need an \"immediate lock\" are few and don't outweigh the utility of keeping the 15 minute delay most of the time.\nIs this possible? If so, how?\n\nA: Turning the iOS device off will require a passcode to be entered no matter the timeout value if you have one other than requiring the passcode immediately upon locking.\nYou can also utility any of the \"Find my iPhone\" or MDM tools that allow remote locking of the device, but these are often not feasible and much more time and work than simply powering off the device or rebooting it.\n\nA: There is unfortunately no way to do this on a situational basis. My suggestion would be to just set it to immediately and get used to entering in your passcode every time. It'll be a habit before you know it!\n", "Q: Can't read my Windows (Boot Camp) partition from OS X I have a Boot Camp problem. Both OSes boot correctly, but when I'm in OS X, I can't access my Windows partition and vice versa. I know that I can't write, but it should be able to read. But I can't access the partition at all. \nIn disk utility, I can see a disk0s4 grayed out where my Boot Camp disk should be. \nTo add, I tried to go with a 3 partition setup (OS X, Windows 7 and a data disk). This is after a clean Lion installation.\nHere are additional details on my setup in case it helps narrow things down:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed a clean version of Lion after installing a new HDD.\n\n*Using Boot Camp assistant to install/setup Windows partition.\n\n*Before installing Windows 7 I created a new partition.\n\n*Restart and install Windows 7 from CD/DVD.\n\n\ndiskutil list shows:\n  GUID_partition_scheme                        *750.2 GB   disk0   \n                    EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n              Apple_HFS OS X                    270.0 GB   disk0s2\n              Apple_HFS DROPZONE                208.9 GB   disk0s3\n   Microsoft Basic Data                         270.8 GB   disk0s4**\n\n\nA: NTFS support was removed in Lion, follow below to re-add it (you should be able to write to the drive as well, after installation)\ninstall and enable ntfs-3g:\nhttp://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/24481/ntfs-3g/\nand install fuse_wait:\nhttps://github.com/bfleischer/fuse_wait\n\nA: It appears that OS X is not mounting the Windows NTFS partition. This is probably for one of two reasons:  either there is something wrong with the NTFS driver for OS X, or there is something wrong with the NTFS partition.  What happens when you select the NTFS partion and click \"File->Mount\" in Disk Utility?\nIf you have not installed any OS X software like NTFS-3G which modifies the built-in NTFS driver, the problem is probably with your Windows partition.  You can have a state where Windows will still boot from the partition, but the NTFS driver for OS X will detect that NTFS was not unmounted cleanly  and left the partition in an inconsistent state and refuse to mount it.  \nIn that case, you should reboot to Windows, and check the disk for errors (chkdsk /F).   Then see if you can mount it in OS X.\n\nA: It is solved! You can find the solution here:\nhttp://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-20090187-263/boot-camp-partitions-not-working-after-installing-os-x-lion/#postComments\nBasically, I had same problem that I could not see my BOOTCAMP partition in MAC OSX. I had \"Paragon NTFS read/write software\" and this was the problem. When I searched for it in my mac spotlight (it is in top right corner of your mac environment) it was there.

I want to display my iPod screen in my PowerPoint slide show, or on a projector through WiFi.\nHow can I do that?\nI mean something like what TeamViewer can do.\n\nA: Three possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use AppleTV.\n\n*Use an appropriate adapter, such as an Apple Digital AV adapater or Apple VGA adapter. (Works only if you have a 4th generation iPod Touch.)\n\n*Use a document camera to record and project your device's screen. For demos where you want to show interaction with the device, this is a common setup.\n", "Q: Where are photos imported via iPhoto stored on disk? I imported some photos from iPhoto and want to attach them to an email message after exporting them.\nHowever, Pictures -> iPhoto Library is not a folder. Where is the actual folder that these photos are stored in?\n\nA: iPhoto Library → Right-Click → Show Package Contents\nYou have to search for your pictures. The order is not logical - i.e. sorted by events.\nIt's easier to choose the following options if you send an email:\n\n*\n\n*In iPhoto go to Share → Email or ...\n\n*...export your pictures so that you can attach them manually File → Export\nWhy is the iPhoto Library stored in a package?\nThe reason is actually quite simple: People break things. When you accidentally mess around with the pictures by unintentionally moving them - you break the library. Photo Booth has its own package for the same reason.\nHowever, if you want to have control over the hierarchy of your picture folders in Finder, you should not import pictures into iPhoto. The setting is located at iPhoto Preferences → Advanced → Importing.\n\nA: Within iPhoto, you can also right-click on a photo and choose Show File. This will bring up the photo file in the Finder without having to browse for it. As the other answer says, though, there aren't very many circumstances under which this is a good idea, since most photo management and sharing can be done from within iPhoto. \n", "Q: Can I efficiently make a pdf out of 10 jpeg images? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I combine two or more images to get a single pdf file? \n\nIn Lion, how can I efficiently combine 10 jpeg files into a single pdf in which each image is a page? I have preview. \n\nA: If you have Acrobat, you can simply select create Pdf from the file menu, then merge files into single pdf, it then gives you the option of small, medium or large size options\n\nA: You may want to watch this YouTube video - it shows the scenario that I believe you're looking to solve - it uses Preview to create a multi-page PDF.\nThe steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your images in Preview\n\n*Select Print from the File menu (or ⌘P)\n\n*Click on the \"PDF\" button in the Print dialog and select \"Save as PDF...\" from the dropdown\n\n*Provide a file name and Save\n", "Q: Can I record iPad screen contents over AirPlay to an Apple TV and then recording the HDMI output? Does the AppleTV HDMI output include any copy protection (e.g. HDCP)? If so, is it always present, or only when playing DRM'd content?\nI'd like to use the AppleTV (with AirPlay mirroring from an iPad) as a cheap and simple way to record iPad activity (at a school, for their private use only) by simply plugging the AppleTV into a DVD recorder (no computer is available - so capture cards or other tools needing a computer are out). \nIf the AppleTV output is set to prevent recording, what about the output directly from the iPad via the HDMI dock connector (\"Apple Digital AV Adapter\")? This isn't as convenient, since it's a physical tether to the recorder, but it would be ok (and still cheap and simple). \n\nA: There is a more elegant solution: Reflector\nUnfortunately, it is a $15 app, but it serves a perfect function for your case. You can use your computer as an AirPlay receiver, and screen record the screen via ordinary computer screen capture software. No need for an Apple TV nor any cords, just a $15 app and a WiFi lan.\n\nA: No - Apple TV (currently) engages HDCP only when needed to protect content that requires HDCP. This is called out in the specifications page as a footnote in teeny tiny grey text:\n\n\n*\n\n*Requires HDCP when playing protected content.\n\n\nYou should be able to use whatever HDMI recorder you please as long as the software doesn't detect protected content being played. You can be sure the engineers have considered that they need to pass the HDCP status from say Hulu or rented movies on iOS to the Apple TV when playing protected content. So if you want to record a demo of your normal app usage, this will work well, but not so much for bypassing HDCP by indirection.\nIf you can gat a computer, a much more robust recording solution is offered in XAleXOwnZX's answer.\n\nA: Apparently you can record the HDMI output of the iPad. As mentioned in this answer and shown in this video.\nAnd you may find the other answers to How do I record a screen cap video of the iPad? useful.\n\nA: I am a business owner that uses iPad for some of the software we sell and support.  If you have a Mac or a PC with XP or higher, there is an app that will allow you to mirror your iPad to the Mac (same process as Apple TV) and the app also records.  It is called Reflector, you can download a 10 minute free trial to see if you can get it to work.  I found it here https://reflectorapp.com.  It has solved my problem for less than $20.\n", "Q: Used boot camp for windows - cannot select partition at boot up I'm used boot camp and created a partition for windows. It gave the usual directions to insert windows CD. I did that and follows the installation instructions. When windows started up I inserted the OSX Leopard disk to install the drivers.\nNow I cannot restart to OSX. It automatically starts to windows every time. I cannot hold down option and choose the partition. I didn't overwrite the OSX partition. It shows up when I click on \"My Computer\". Whats going on? Did I accidentally overwrite the OSX boot loader?\n\nA: I believe once you install Boot Camp, the computer will boot into Windows by default unless you change it. Presumably, you're holding down the option key immediately on startup, it should be pressed as you hear the startup chime? \nApart from holding down the option key at startup, if you find you can only boot into Windows, this Apple support page tells you how you can change the default startup volume from Control Panel.\n\nThis startup volume selection is temporary.  To set the default startup volume for your Mac after your computer is running, open System Preferences and choose Startup Disk from the View menu (in Mac OS X) or open the Boot Camp control panel (in Windows).\n\nAlso, do any of the other Startup key combinations work, e.g. Safe Boot or Single User Mode?\n", "Q: Copy system bundle to a Mac on network? I screwed up while using Monolingual and removed the \"AppleKeyboardLayouts.bundle\". Before I realized what happened, I logged out and now I can't type a password to log back in.\nI have tried to copy the bundle to the right location, using Sharing but I get \"not enough write permissions.\" I tried using scp in Terminal but I get \"no such file\" on all the bundle contents.\nWhat is the best way to copy a bundle to one of the System folders /Systems/Library/Keyboard Layouts/ from one Mac to another over the network?\nI know that I can probably restore from a boot disk but I'd prefer to just do it this way if possible.\nHelp! Thanks.\n\nA: To copy your \"AppleKeyboardLayouts.bundle\" to a system folder you need \"root permission!\" use cp (copy) or mv (move) with sudo (super user) to copy files.\nIf you let's say try to copy folders or files that have a recursive structure/architecture you need to add the -r flag, like so: cp -r ~/Desktop/myFolderA ..\nsudo cp ~/yourPath/AppleKeyboardLayouts.bundle /Systems/Library/Keyboard\\ Layouts/\n\nIt is always a good idea imho, to have a second partition ready on the same HDD in order to copy files back and forth, if needed, or at least to have a second user account with sufficient permissions.\n", "Q: Replacing HDD on iMac G3 I bought a used iMac G3 recently and I am trying to get it at max performance. Atm I am at the phase of replacing the HDD.\nI read on some places that 7200 RPM drives may have overheat problems in the G3 is that true? I probably wont be stressing the drive too much since most files come from network but its good to know. Also what type of drive do I need ? The ones I am considering have :\nEIDE ATA100\nIDE Fast Ultra DMA ATA/133\nBoth are 7200 rpm refubrished drives at 80 gb and 2mb catche.\nIs one of those better choice ?\nAs an alternative if 7200 rpm is not good idea/ interfaces not compatible i got this :\nATA/133 HDD Hard Drive IDE\nThanks and hope I didnt put too many questions there ^^.\n\nA: The iMacs range from supporting EIDE ATA-3 to Ultra ATA as noted in EveryMac.com under the \"Int. HD Interface:\" section for each iMac, but the good news is that they are all backwards compatible.\n\nFortunately, the technology itself is pretty easy to use, even if the labels given to it often stink. So one useful way of dealing with all the standards and labels is simply to ignore them! Look past the hype, and focus on what the drive's actual capabilities are. If you want to really understand what a drive can do and what it supports, you should look at its specification sheet and see what features and transfer modes it is designed to use. Ignore labels like \"EIDE\" or \"Ultra ATA/whatever\" and find out what modes and functions the drive supports. Getting the real scoop on the drive means you don't need to worry about the pretty stickers slapped all over the box, or whatever the manufacturer is trying to claim.\n\nOne thing you need to be aware of is the 128GB size limitation. Your iMacs IDE controller can not address more than 128GB of a given disk.\nAlso overheating issue is probably not an issue? Eg if you go though OWC's MyOWC upgrade guide for any of the G3 iMacs even the oldest, they are recommending a 120GB 7200RPM drive as a replacement.  The best way to be sure would be to figure out the power requirement specs for that original drive and see how they match up, and use that to pick a new one.\nAlso there is some discussion on newer 7200 RPM drives producing less heat than the early on 7200RPM drives 7200 rpm Drive Doesn't Overheat My G3 iMac\n\nThree or four years ago I installed a 7200 RPM hard drive in a 500 MHz G3 iMac (Summer 2000). I lent it to a friend, who ran it round the clock for weeks on end. Never had heat issues. It runs Tiger well enough for basic Internet, email, word processing, and old versions of iTunes and iPhoto. A fast hard drive and 1 GB of RAM really did a lot for it. The drive is an 80 GB Samsung. It is out of production, but Western Digital still makes 3.5\" ATA-100 hard drives. Any modern one-platter hard drive will probably run cooler than the iMac's original hard drive.\n\n\nI put a 120 GB 7200 rpm Seagate hard drive in my 600 MHz iMac and ran it 24 hours a day for years with no overheating. One time I left home for two weeks during September in Texas with the air conditioning off the entire time while I was away. There was a hot spell while I was gone. When I got home the house, was 95 degrees. I'm sure it got hotter than that while I was gone. The little iMac ran perfectly the entire time.\nToday's 7200 rpm hard drives have better bearings, use less energy, make less noise, last longer, and make less heat that the old, slow hard drives that came with the G3 iMac. I say put a 7200 rpm hard drive in it and don't worry about it. Expect to see a small performance increase as a result.\n\n\nA: Yes, since iMac G3s rely on passive cooling, a 7200 RPM drive can easily overheat in one. Go for the 5400 RPM drive.\n", "Q: Any Twitter clients for iPhone with larger font size?

When I attempt to open the file on Mac OS X Lion using KeyPassX, I get the error \"Wrong signature.\"\n\nA: I discovered I could solve the problem by exporting the .kdbx file (2.x) to a .kdb file (1.x).\nTo do this, open the password file on a Windows computer using KeyPass 2.x. Select File -> Export, choose the file type as *.kdb and enter a filename. Then, you can open the new file on Mac OS X using KeyPassX.\nSince my passwords don't change that often, I simply export a new copy for my Mac every time I modify the original on Windows.\n\nA: You probably have the old (0.x) version of KeePassX. The latest 2.x or newer is needed. :) \nThe same applies for Linux. If using Arch Linux, note it has several packages: \n\n\n*\n\n*keepassx (0.x)\n\n*keepass2 (2.x)\n\n*keepassc (community 2.x with keypasshttp support))\n\n", "Q: Parenthesis don't show in built-in iPhone calculator app When you open the iOS's built in calculator app and rotate iPhone you get the scientific calculator.\nI am trying to use parenthesis ( ) to write something like (2+2)/4 but the parenthesis don't appear!\nHow do I enter that expression?\n\nA: The built-in calculator doesn't offer any visual clues to let you know you've opened a sub-group operation in an expression. The only thing that tips you off is you'll get a sub-result after you close the group show up in the display. For example, enter the following:\n5 + ( 3 + 3 )\n\nAfter you type the opening ( you don't see anything on the display. But when you press the closing ) the display shows you 6 to tip you off to the fact that the 3 + 3 operation was performed.\nI prefer the TouchCalc app myself. It will show a small ( in the lower left corner of the display when you open a sub-expression grouping so you know you're actually perserving your order of operations as intended.\n\nA: It does not function correctly depending on the equation.

I have a Parental Controls limit on my child so I have to type in my password when they open a new application. I have recently discovered a problem though. They have tried programming in terminal. The problem is that the Mac thinks of each command as an application, so if they want to use a new command, I have to allow it. Is there a way to allow all of the commands, but not the actual applications?\n\nA: Well, allowing all commands would probably allow your child to bypass some or all of the other Parental Controls on the system. Perhaps a simple Linux Virtual Machine without networking capabilities would suit your purposes better? Your child wouldn't be able to bypass any settings on the host machine and if they break the VM, it's trivial to fix/reinstall.\n", "Q: ssh terminal window closes immediately when opened I am seeing some odd behavior when using the Terminal app to open an ssh window to a remote machine. I normally connect to many different Linux servers from my MacBook Pro running Mac OS X 10.7.3, with Terminal 2.2.2 (303).\nI have a list of the servers' IP addresses in the New Remote Connection window's ssh group. When I select one of the servers (10.x.y.120, for instance), enter a username, and click Connect, an ssh window opens and I can enter my password and get to work.\nHowever, starting yesterday, for a couple of the machines (10.x.y.182 and 10.x.y.194), when I follow this procedure an ssh window opens and then immediately disappears. For other servers, the window opens as usual.\nHere's the kicker: If I open a terminal window on my MacBook Pro itself, then run ssh on the command line to the machine that I can't reach through the New Remote Connection window, the connection works perfectly. It only fails when I do it through Terminal.\nI have tried deleting the entry in New Remote Connection, and creating it again, but that didn't help. This is happening on a machine that was just restarted. One thing that did change was that I applied the latest Mac OS updates over the weekend. I don't remember which versions they were.\nThings used to work last week, so something broke recently. Are there any logs I could look at for more information? Are there any configuration or data files that might have become corrupt? Thanks in advance for your help.\n\nA: Here's what happened. On the machines I was trying to reach (10.x.y.182 and 10.x.y.194), in the time when I was not using them they had their hard disks replaced and the OS reinstalled. This gave them new SSH keys, invalidating the ones I had in my ~/.ssh/known_hosts file. Unfortunately, Terminal.app did not surface this problem to me.\nBy deleting the entries for those machines in ~/.ssh/known_hosts, I forced the system to pull down the new keys and ask me if I wanted to use them. With this done, connections worked perfectly as usual. Oddly, however, even before I changed ~/.ssh/known_hosts, connections using the DNS name of the machine (svr10 and svr20) worked. Weird.\nThanks, everyone, who looked at this problem.\n", "Q: Copy/paste OmniFocus actions for iOS on iPhone? Is there any way to copy/paste actions in OmniFocus for iOS on the iPhone?\nIf I recall correctly, there used to be a beta feature you could enable in the settings which allowed you to press and hold on an action to show the \"copy\" option, but it's no longer there in the latest version.\nIs there any other way to duplicate actions in OmniFocus without having to use another client?\n\nA: If you click on an action or a project in the latest version of OmniFocus Universal for iOS, it provides a system share sheet that has a copy extension, which allows you to copy it as Taskpaper. That can then be pasted back into the application or you can use an application such as workflow to make a new project or action based on your copied data, which may be slightly more convenient.\n", "Q: Is there a way to have AppleScript output displayed in the menubar? Before reading further:\nI know about butler and similar programs.  I am looking for a BUILT-IN way to do this without a third party app.\nAnyway, I wrote an AppleScript that runs a shell command.  I want to display that output in the menubar at the top... without Butler how can I do this?\n\nA: As a generality, without a third party program, such as Growl, there is no built in way to do this.\nHowever, you could write a script or other program such as one I found here that provides the menulet service for you.  I'm sure that Growl integration would be much easier to accomplish.\n\nA: There isn't a built in way to do this in OS X. However, using Growl, you can have notifications. Here's a sample script for that:\n--Make sure Growl is running\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set isRunning to (count of (every process whose bundle identifier is \"com.Growl.GrowlHelperApp\")) > 0\nend tell\n\nif isRunning then\n    tell application id \"com.Growl.GrowlHelperApp\"\n        set the allNotificationsList to ¬\n            {\"Test Notification\", \"Another Test Notification\"}\n        --Notifications can be enabled in System Preferences>Growl>Applications>Display Options\n        set the enabledNotificationsList to ¬\n            {\"Test Notification\"}\n        register as application ¬\n            \"Growl AppleScript Sample\" all notifications allNotificationsList ¬\n            default notifications enabledNotificationsList ¬\n                    -- Set the icon.

NSMenu's methods) to achieve what was probably not possible in 2012.\nI found an interesting script to create custom menus from within AppleScript; from this I extracted suitable code to place text in macOS's menu bar. In fact it uses just a menu's \"title\" for inserting some content.\nIn order to demonstrate this I implemented a very basic dialog script that asks users for text input (waiting 6 sec.) which is then displayed in the menu bar temporarily (5 sec.).\nHere it is:\nuse framework \"Foundation\"\nuse framework \"AppKit\"\nuse scripting additions\nproperty StatusItem : missing value\nproperty newMenu : class \"NSMenu\"\n\ndisplay dialog \"Write something:\" default answer \"\" giving up after 6\nset myText to text returned of the result\nif myText is \"\" then set myText to \"TOOOOO slow … try again !\"\nset myText to \">>    \" & myText & \"    <<\"\n\nset bar to current application's NSStatusBar's systemStatusBar\nset StatusItem to bar's statusItemWithLength:-1.0\nStatusItem's setTitle:myText\nset newMenu to current application's NSMenu's alloc()'s initWithTitle:\"Custom\"\nStatusItem's setMenu:newMenu\n\ndelay 5\ncurrent application's NSStatusBar's systemStatusBar()'s ¬\n        removeStatusItem:StatusItem  \n\nThis AppleScript code can be used in any script of yours.

Currently, running an iPad 16GB Wifi only model with iOS 4.3.5. I have been noticing some slow redraw issues using Safari, generally when scrolling down length pages. I am seeing the checkerboard background, then the page renders.  Would upgrading to the latest version of iOS fix this or make it worse?  \nIs there a way to roll back to iOS 4.3.5, should I find iOS 5 latest version to be worse?\n\nA: The version of Safari that ships with IOS 5 has much better performance than the versions that ship with iOS 4, as reported in this blog post and this article. This increased performance may address the checkerboard rendering issue that you've mentioned. HTML pipelining was introduced in iOS5, and may help with the latency that results in slow rendering. Anecdotally, viewing web pages in Safari does seem a lot faster after I upgraded to iOS 5.\nRegarding a rollback to iOS 4 if you don't like iOS 5 - cksum's provides some detailed info in this Apple.SE answer.\n\nA: The checkerboard is displayed to make the scrolling smooth while the page loads. It may be faster or it may not but you will probably still see the checkerboard on your original iPad. It is not a bug, it is just what happens when the iPad needs to load what is off screen. There are plenty more reasons to upgrade to iOS 5, though, even if this particular issue isn't resolved.\n", "Q: Wifi connection has password issue with my Macbook Pro I have a 2010 Macbook Pro (running Snow Leopard) and I connect to my home internet thru Wifi (via Thompson router).\nThe problem is, after I choose my Wifi from a list of Wifis and enter the password, majority of the times it fails to connect saying \"Incorrect password\", even though its correct. All I have to do is keep pressing the return key until a connection is established.\nVery few times I get connected automatically without a need to enter the password and sometimes I get the connection on the first attempt, but usually it takes around 5-10 tries.\nIt doesn't happen to my Windows (vaio) laptop though.\nAnyone seen something likely and got it fixed?\n\nA: You could try 'Forget this network' in the Airport settings through System Preferences -> Network, then reconnect fresh again\n\nA: For others finding this thread because they too have the problem:\nOn my wife's MacBook Pro, the answer turned out to be that the laptop could not differentiate between the 2.4GHz and 5GHz version of the wireless, and if it connected to a different one than last time, told her the password was wrong. The cure was to 'split' the two wi-fi networks by adding '-5' to the 5GHz version SSID, then the Mac could tell them apart. It has the same passcode for both networks (although they could be different) and is now happy to connect to either, every time.\nWhy this suddenly crops up for some, is down to relative signal strength on each frequency, and maybe a new router having the 5GHz band for the first time, but with the same SSID. (That is how they are normally set up, but Apple has problems with that).\nHTH someone.\n\nA: The problem was solved by a firmware update. It specifically addressed this password issue. \n\nA: I have the same issue, and it's driving me nuts.\nIf I leave MB running unattended, say, overnight, or even if I shut it down, the next time I log in it fails to see the the router.

In one I had set it to 'WPA2 Personal' and in tho other as 'WPA2/WPA Personal'.

After you connected and select which volumn to mount it will mount it as a volume on the Mac you are using and then you can drag and drop to or from that volume.\nAirdrop is not available on all Lion installs, it depends on the age of the Mac, see OS X Lion: Can I use AirDrop with my computer?\n\nA: AirDrop\nOpen Finder on both Macs, on the left you'll see the AirDrop icon with the parachute and box. Click that on both macs and you should see each other. Then just drag files to the other computer's picture.\nYou don't even have to be on a wifi network at all, you just have to have wifi enabled on both Macs.\nEdit: As mentioned below, not all Macs have AirDrop. The next best solution is to choose \"Create Network\" under the wifi menu on the Menu Bar (or join the same wifi network on both machines).\nThen enable file sharing.\nNow open finder and choose \"network\" on the left of a finder window, or in the top most folder (ctrl-click on the title  at the top of the finder window, mine's called \"Lance's MacbookPro\") you should see \"network\" there.\n\nA: Dropbox\nTry Dropbox. It has LAN support (which Airdrop operates on) and a filesystem, so if you register an account, download the client for Mac onto both machines, setup the Dropbox folder to be somewhere handy (e.g. Desktop, where you can just drag-drop) it would be at least as speedy as Airdrop, and far more versatile, as it supports online uploading and more operating systems. Only limit is the 2GB of free folder space, which you can either expand via referrals (to 8GB) or by buying more space.\n\nA: Connect to the same WIFI network\n(Create one if needed)\n\nEnable guest login or add a user\n -> System Preferences -> User & Groups\n(Guest login may be enabled only if you solely control your network)\n\nSharing files\n -> System Preferences -> Sharing -> File Sharing\n(enable File sharing, add folders to share and write rights if needed)\n\nNow, you should be able to see a shared mac in Sidebar of a Finder window from another computer.\n\nTroubleshooting\ntry to reconfigure TCP/IP Settings to use DHCP with manual address(es).\nWIFI logo -> Open Network Preferences -> Advanced -> TCP/IP\n\nA: Have you tried AirPort? Assuming they are on the same network. It works fairly well, and should be located in the upper left of any finder window you use. Click it on both computers, and drag and drop.\n\nA: My wife and I use DropCopy, which you can download from the app store.  The link is to the free version, which is for less than three computers.  It's a nice and easy way to share.  If you want to send link, it pops up on their computer - they click the window and it opens in a browser.  Files are equally as easy.   \nI love Dropbox, but I don't think it's ideal for link sharing, etc.  For large files, it's probably better.  Airdrop only works on newer macs too, which might be a problem if you're working on older hardware.\n\nA: Liwi\nDownload the Liwi App on both Mac and Liwi automatically discovers the devices which are on same WiFi. Then you can transfer files from one mac to other.\nEven it allows to browse the shared content of other devices and download the content on demand. It is available for Android and Windows OS as well.\n", "Q: How to find where files reside on a partition I'm trying to use Bootcamp to install a Windows partition. But it gives this error message.\n\nI remember there was a program that let you see where all the files are on the partition and how much space they took up. I figure that this can help me in this situation, but I forgot what the name of the program was.\nWhat are some programs that can help me see where files are located on the partition?\n\nA: A disk defragmenter might do what you want for this. Possibly.\nOS X since 10.3 automatically defragments files, but doesn't do anything to move them all to the 'top' of your volume. A 3rd party defragmenter might do this, which theoretically would clear out all the cruft that's preventing non-destructive repartitioning from taking place.\nThe other option is what Apple recommends in that dialog: clone the volume at the filesystem level, reformat, and then clone it back--when it rewrites, all of the files will be written one by one at the 'top' of the volume. Of course, if you need to do that, you might as well repartition while you're in the process of reformatting the disk.\n\nA: There are a few third-party utilities that show disk usage graphically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disk Inventory X\n\n*GrandPerspective\n\n*DaisyDisk\nIf you're comfortable with the command-line, there's also du.\n\nA: Sounds like you have a virtual memory page file, or a hibernation file or similar stuck at the end of the disk.  I would boot from a CD or other media (Recovery partition if on Lion), startup Disk Utility from there so you have access to the whole drive without the encumberence of actually running on the drive you are trying to play with, and rezising the partition from there to the desired size.  This will stop you encountering any files that are \"locked\" which prevented the resize from taking place previously.  Then you can boot back into it, and carry on with the Boot Camp Assistant.\nTake a backup first, this applies regardless of what method you are using, if you are resizing your partitions, then a power cut could easily screw the lot.  Another method would be to backup, recreate the partition smaller, and restore into it like the dialogue screenshot you provide says, but this is overkill and you should be able to do it without needing to complete all those steps, just have the backup handy as a safety net, and resize while booted from another OS instance.\n\nA: I had the same problem once while installing Bootcamp on a Snow Leopard machine.\nThe disk utility (which partitions the drive) actually tries to move your files around to create a large enough space for the new partition. Therefore you don't really need to worry about that yourself.\nBut two things are needed for that to work:\n\n\n*\n\n*There has to be enough free space on your disk. Not just enough for the new partition, but more than that, so it actually has some room to work with.\n\n*It can't move files that are in use. And while you're logged in normally, there are always some files in use (see stuffe's answer). For me it helped to boot up in safe mode, then running the bootcamp assistant.\n\n", "Q: What do I do when I get \"Cannot Connect to iTunes store\" when downloading an app? I'm using an iPad 2, iOS 5 and trying to download apps/updates. Occasionally I get the \"Cannot connect to iTunes Store\" message and my downloads cancel. The iTunes store loads, all my Apple ID services work, I can view app descriptions on the App store, but when I go to download or update, I get this message.\nSometimes it's intermittent, but I've gotten it every time I tried for a week now. This also happened the day after I got my iPad; in that case I had to do a factory reset of the iPad's settings.\nResetting to factory settings (not resetting data) didn't help at all this time. However downloading updates over my phone's mobile tehering does work so it's some combination of my home wifi and iPad settings. I reset my cable modem and wireless router to no avail however. \nWhat else can I do to fix this?\n\nA: What seems to work is signing out from my Apple ID (using the Apple ID link at the bottom of the App Store), then shutting off the device (hold the power button). Then I turn back on the device, go to the App store, enter my Apple ID info, and then try to download/update an app again. \nJust restarting or relogging in to my Apple ID alone didn't seem to be enough.\n\nA: My iPad has been doing this as well. I'm not sure what the cause of it is, but it seems to go away for a little while if you:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open the multitasking menu by double tapping the home button.\n  \n*Close the App Store app by pressing and holding down the icon and pressing the red line\n  \n*Re open the the App Store app and keep plugging along.\n\nAgain, not sure why it's doing this. I've tried restoring the iPad and it doesn't really fix it. Perhaps a software update will come along soon.\n\nA: This could be due to a missbehaving wifi/data connection which cause interruptions in communication. You could check signal level or even try to turn off and on your wifi/data connection. Also, you could try to download smaller chunks (ie not update all apps at once) and hope they get done before next interruption.\n\nA: I had same problem...

Is there a good way to more or less \"delete\" this feature from Lion?\nI've heard that if the Recovery Partition fails to load that Safari Only mode will also not work, but I think the Recovery Partition is read only, and I don't think I can change that. \nThank you!\n\nA: Figured it out today!\nHere's what I did.\n\n\n*\n\n*I downloaded and installed Lion from the Mac App Store. \n\n*I then used the Lion Recovery Disk Assistant to put the recovery partition on a USB flash drive. You can test it by restarting your machine while the flash drive is plugged in, holding option and selecting the USB drive on the boot menu. This should take you to the Lion Recovery Disk Assistant on the flash drive.\n\n*Since Safari Only Mode uses the built in recovery partition, removing it resolves this issue.

One is called \"Home\" and the other called \"Work\". When you sent an invite from your iCloud \"Work\" calendar it will automatically use your Apple ID email address because that is the email account that is \"hosting\" the calendar. This can be confusing because it's the same email but two different calendars.\nGmail addresses (and most others), for example, come with calendars in the same way that iCloud does. In order to send invites from your work account, you will need to create a calendar with your work email address, and make sure that you select that calendar when you create an event. You should be able to make invites from that calendar and they should send from your work email address.\n", "Q: How to rebind Go Back and Go Forward in Preview on Lion? It seems that in Lion, standard shortcuts were added for the Go menu items Back and Forward. The shortcuts (⌘+[ and ⌘+]) are unusable on Finnish keyboard, and I'd like to rebind them. By unusable I mean that e.g. [ is produced with Alt+8 on a Finnish keyboard, and pressing ⌘+Alt+8 does not do anything in Preview.\nI have added Forward and Back shortcuts for Preview.app under System Preferences, Keyboard, Keyboard Shortcuts, Application Shortcuts, but Preview only shows the default shortcuts. In Snow Leopard I was able to (re?)bind the actions this way, but it seems that this doesn't work in Lion.\nWhat to do? Navigating huge PDF files without back/forward is painful.\n\nA: If the System Preferences way of doing that doesn't work, the only other way I can think of remapping the command would be to use something such as Keyboard Maestro or TextExpander.

If you want to remove such files as well, you can use tools like AppCleaner which @james.garriss has mentioned. \nBesides this, applications which have not been installed via the Mac App Store sometimes provide their own uninstaller in the installer .dmg image. I usually keep them in a folder Applications/Uninstaller which I created.\n\nA: I recommend using AppCleaner from FreeMacSoft.  You simply drag-and-drop the application you want to uninstall from your Application folder onto AppCleaner.  It does the rest, including finding and deleting other related files on your system.\n\nA: Yes, it is possible under macOS Catalina. Not sure when this became available. When in App Store, click on your account in the bottom left corner, the list of the apps installed under the account will show up.

When extracted on OSX it does not extract them into sub-folders but puts them all in one folder and then takes the subfolder names and adds it to the file name so you have a super long file name like this:\nfolder/sub-folder/itemname.extension\n\nBut it's not in subfolders.\nthat make sense? Anyone figure out why this happens? I'm not sure what the character length is that triggers this because other files extract fine, just certain ones that exceed a character limit in the name...\n\nA: This isn't answering your question, but might I suggest you try The Unarchiver - I find it much better than Archive Utility.app. I've used it for years and never seen the problem you've experienced with Apple's utility.\n", "Q: Internet Sharing stuck on after 10.7.3 update I use Internet Sharing at work to create a local WiFi network (sharing the GigE connection) for my various iOS and tablet devices to connect through. After the 10.7.3 update, I cannot turn sharing off after I unplug the Ethernet cable. All the checkboxes in the system pref pane are cleared, but I am unable to join a WiFi network.\nAfter I plug the Ethernet back in, I can then disable sharing, but only while it's plugged in.\nAs best I can guess, there might be some xinetd cruft laying around, but I haven't the slightest clue as to how to look for it or fix it. Any ideas?\n\nA: I found a relatively simple solution not involving a system restart - just bring the WiFi interface down and then back up:\n$ sudo ifconfig en0 down\n$ sudo ifconfig en0 up\n\nIn my case en0 is the AirPort interface of my MacBook Air.\nNote that turning the AirPort off and on again doesn't work, but bringing the interface down does the job.\n\nA: I've had this problem regularly. The only way I can find to fix it is to turn off internet sharing, then reboot. It seems to hang once you've shared the Ethernet connection.\n\nA: I have the issue intermittently, and so far the only simple way I have found to fix it is to plug into a wired connection, then turn sharing off. This usually fixes it. What is strange is that I have the problem often enough that I am now regularly checking to ensure that I have disabled sharing prior to leaving work, but I still have problems when waking the system from sleep after arriving at home. Something is getting stuck; even when sharing has been disabled, it often acts as if it is still active. I'm wondering if sharing needs to be disabled for a certain amount of time before the setting is cleared internally?\n", "Q: None of my apps are keeping a list of recent documents? Example:\nIf I open an image in Preview, the \"File/Open Recent\" menu lists the name of the file.\nIf I then close the file, but still leave Preview running, the \"Open Recent\" menu still lists the file.\nIf I quit Preview, the \"Show Recents\" menu does not show any files.\nIf I reopen Preview, the \"Open Recent\" menu does not show any files.  \n\nI have a feeling this is a permissions problem, but repair permissions has not helped.\nIn Console, Preview is reporting the following error upon opening:\n\"29/02/2012 14:45:57.183 com.apple.Preview.TrustedBookmarksService: Failure to de-serialize bookmark data file.\"\nI'm using Preview as an example here, but it holds for every app - whether they are bundled or downloaded - on my system.\nSystem Preferences/Appearance/Number of Recent Items is set to 10.\nI am running Lion 10.7.3 on an iMac 12,1 with a dual SSD and HDD internal drive setup.\n\nA: I would trash your preview .plist file located at:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Preview.plist\n\nRestart Preview, and it should create a new one.  It sounds corrupted.\n\nA: This worked for me:\n\n*\n\n*Turn on the Mac whilst holding down ⌘+R in order to boot from the recovery partition.\n\n*On the top menu, click Utilities, then click Terminal.\n\n*Type resetpassword and press ↩.\n\n*Click on your main hard drive.\n\n*In the dropdown box under Select the user account make sure to select your username.\n\n*Underneath where it says Reset Home Directory Permissions and ACLs, click the Reset button.\n\n*Press ⌘+Q to quit the Reset Password application.\n\n*Press ⌘+Q again to quit the Terminal.\n\n*Press ⌘+Q one more time and click Restart.\n\n*Click Mac OS X Utilities in the top left of the screen and click the Restart button.\n\n\nI got the solution over at Apple Discussions:\n\nI'm not sure where that list is stored, but I agree with your feeling that this is a\npermissions problem.  However, repairing permissions with Disk Utility is not likely to\nhelp.  That only repairs certain things, and doesn't affect the user folder at all, which is likely to be where the problem lies.  You could try resetting the permissions\non your home folder.\n\n", "Q: Can I use 16GB DDR3-1600MHz RAM in an early Macbook Pro 8.2? I found Macs which had:\n\n*\n\n*16GB RAM installed\n\n\n*8GB RAM installed, but running on 1600MHz instead of 1333MHz (link in dutch)\n\nQuestion\nIs it possible to put 16GB running at 1600MHz in my Mac?\nIf you've done this, please post a screen shot.\nApparently you need a Macbook Pro with an i7 processor of at least 2.2GHz or more in order to use memory running at 1600MHz.\nMy hardware\n\n*\n\n*Macbook Pro 8,2  early 2011 - 2.0GHz i7 quad\n\nedit:\nI recently found this sleepimage. Basically it's just a swap file of your RAM. so your mac can 'sleep'. But when you install 16GB you're gonna have a 16GB RAM file sitting on your disk as well. Which you can safely delete but it will be recreated when your mac goes to sleep. just something to consider when your working with limited disk space.\n\nA: It's not possible to use RAM running at 1600MHz in your Macbook Pro 8.2, because it's not supported by the processor.\nYour Macbook Pro has the Intel® Core™ i7-2635QM Processor which only allows DDR3-RAM running at 1066/1333MHz according to Intel. (see link for official specs)\nWhile the 2635QM processor does not support 1600MHz memory, it does support 16GB RAM:\n\n\nA: 16 GB should be possible - but I'm quite sure it will always run at 1333 MHz, as the firmware sets the clock speed. Thus, even if you buy a 1600 MHz module it should run at 1333 MHz (edit: 1600 MHz is possible, see comments)\nAnd I could not find any 8 GB module at 1600 MHz.\nSo I would recommend to get 16 GB at (at least) 1333 MHz.\n\n\n\nA: I successfully bought and installed a 16GB Patriot kit (2x8GB) of PC3-1600 (12800) in my 15\" MBP 8,2 (2.3Ghz Early 2011). Used to have 2x4GB PC3-1333, now it runs 2x8GB at 1600 speeds! No extra software needed, and even Boot Camp (Win 7) had no issues... so far. 48 hours since I installed it, and I feel good. While I know YMMV, just make sure you have HIGHER than 2.0 Ghz (2.2 and up) CPU and 2011 or newer, and you should be ok.  No idea about the 13\" models, though.\n\nA: A bit late, but I'm running the Early 2011 MBP with the 2.0Ghz intel core i7 2635qm (or 2630qm not sure) which by intel does not support 1600Mhz memory. \nBelieve it or not; I've got 16gb ram buzzing at 1600mhz. My about this mac reports I can have two bars of 1600mhz and extended system information reports that my RAM is running at 1600mhz. \nAnd by the way, 1333mhz and 1600mhz doesn't differ a lot in price now so why not take the chance. I can assure you it will work at 1600Mhz anyways. \n\nA: I have  a Late 2011 13\" MacBook Pro 2.4 GHz i5. Bought a PNY PC3-12800 16GB (2x8GB) at 1600MHz for an upgrade. System profiler sees the full 16GB and at full speed of 1600 MHz. The box says the kit is backwards compatible to 1333 and 1066 MHz DDR3 speeds anyhow. So I recommend buying the PNY kit as it worked great for me and so long as it works according to the package it should down clock to be compatible if it doesn't run the full 1600 MHz. So either way you'll get your capacity upgrade but this way you might get lucky and receive a small speed boost too. Best of luck to you all!\n\nA: Check your computer make and model on Crucial. It'll give you all the valuable intel you'll need to make the right decision.\n\nA: I just installed 16gigs 1600mhz ram in a 2011 17 inch MacBook pro i7 2.2 and it's working great and is running at 1600mhz in the system report. \n\nA: I'm running 1600Mz on 2011 17 MacPro that originally came with 1333Mz\n\n\nA: i also upgraded to 16GB 1600MHZ on my early 2011 i7-2720QM MBP. runs all good :)\n\n\n\nA: I installed a 1600 MHz 16 GB RAM on my Late 2011 17 Inch MacBook and its running blazingly fast now. The Apple store denied me the request saying its un-supported for you Macbook and were also charging me almost double the price of the usual upgrade.\nI ended up by adding Two Kingston 8 GB modules in my Macbook and it worked just fine.\nFor people in India they can get it from Amazon\nhttp://www.amazon.in/Kingston-RAM-LAPTOP-1600MHZ-PC3L/dp/B00CQ35HBQ/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1456807582&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=Kingston+8+GB+RAM+FOR+LAPTOP+1600MHZ+PC3L+-+KVR16LS118+macbook\n\nA: I took my Mac in for a service in 2015, it went in with Crucial Ram 1333Mhz and has come back with 1600 MHz RAM. They had to change the logic board so I think they accidentally changed the ram also.\nIt's interesting to see that replaced it with \"Unsupported\" RAM.\nYes, I think your Mac should run with 1600 MHz RAM as well.\n\nA: Im late also but the latter part of my post might assist someone to. My Late 2011, 15.4AntiGlare 2.2Ghz MBP,is running 16G of Corsair Vengeance- 1600Mhz, for 9 months now. Coincidently Apple just(in Dec) replaced my Logicboard+GPU under the extension program for certain models. **I did find out the OEM Factory Toshiba256G SSD only runs at 3G,Max its capable of. Kind of a Ripoff Apple on an SSD?!!?  Both Bays support 6G sata in my v8.2\n.(Which I achieved a Sandisk240G Uktra6G/ Sale price $60. Along with a 1Tb Seagate SSHD running 6G in the optical bay).\n", "Q: Can I unlock my iOS, or access it's data some way, via PC? In other words, if my iOS device is stolen, will the person be able to get my data by pluging it in a PC and use some trick (or by being able to jailbreak my device while it is protected with a passcode lock)?\nFor the discussion, please assume my iOS device:\n\n\n*\n\n*is in airplane mode, so I can't remote wipe.\n\n*not currently jailbroken\n\n\nA: In general, no. iOS devices where you have enabled hardware data protection on iOS 4 or later require the correct passcode to be entered. If you haven't enabled a passcode, the data on the phone is easily available to the thief assuming they have either minimal training and/or money.\nSo, as long as they can't guess the passcode from looking at smudges in the glass or recording your motions before the device is stolen - you are as secure as the passcode you have chosen. Most times when the government needs to bypass the passcode locks, they get a warrant for your home computer and take the key that iTunes uses to unlock the device and use specialized software to send that key.\nOnce someone is willing to spend thousands of dollars on either specialized hardware and software or thousands of dollars to hire someone trained in iPhone forensics to do the work, the chances of \"cracking\" into the device are higher, but still not assured if you have chosen a good passcode and not allowed your keys to be stolen by a backup to iCloud or let the thief get to your computer as well.\n\nA: One principle to remember is that no form of security is perfect. If someone has your device in their physical protection and has sufficient skill and/or the right tools, they will be able to get your data.\nOne example - in an article titled \"Limitations of Data Protection in iOS 4\", Professor Anthony Vance from BYU notes that:\n\nUpdated August 6, 2010: Elcomsoft has announced that its iPhone\n  Password Breaker tool can recover iPhone keychains (probably the\n  escrow keybag) from password-protected iPhone backups.\n\nWhile this announcement is dated and relates to iOS backups on the computer and the security in iOS 5 have improved, tools that can be used to extract data has also improved. Further, iOS 5 still has some security flaws, as this article points out - one example is of the security bypass in iPad with Smart Covers.\nBottom line: you can't completely count on device security to ensure the protection your data if the device is in someone else's physical control.\n\nA: 1) Answer is yes, they may be able to get your data if you \n\n\n*\n\n*are using a device model prior to iPhone 3GS. \n\n*jailbroken the device and didn't secure published security loopholes (google for more details).\n\n*didn't set Settings.app->General->Auto-Lock to a time period, and didn't set  Settings.app->General->Passcode Lock->Erase Data to On after X number of unsuccessful password attempts.\n\n*didn't encrypt your backup (on your Mac or PC that has iTunes). Prior discussion Stop my old iPhone from backing up\n2) Another question is will they be able to quickly make sense of the data. Prior to iPhone 3GS, yes;  post 3GS, the data on the Flash Memory is hardware encrypted. Each successive (newer than 3GS) devices use encryption algorithms that are more computationally-expensive to decrypt, except perhaps for 3-letter government agencies whom Apple (by law) has to submit their encryption algorithms to.\n", "Q: Pair bluetooth keyboard when not logged in I have a brand new Bluetooth keyboard (replacing an old one I spilt coffee on) and I would like to pair it with my iMac. \nTrouble is, I can't log in to the iMac because the keyboard is not paired.\nHow do I resolve this chicken-and-egg situation? (I don't have any other keyboards to hand.)\n\nA: If you have the Apple Keyboard 2 which has the Lightning port on the back of the keyboard, all you need to do is connect the USB -> Lightning cord to the computer and it will just like a normal wired keyboard.\nRefer to: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201178\n\nA: This is only true if you have already selected \"check for bluetooth keyboard/mouse at startup\"   Otherwise you have to connect a USB mouse and keyboard\n\nA: I just had this frustrating problem.  Simultaneously pressing the command key and the power button worked for me. \n\nA: Here is a solution as noted here: How to unpair keyboard without original computer\nTheir solution was to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnected everything USB, etc. from the computer.\n\n*Restart the iMac while putting the new/different keyboard into discovery mode, and wait for the iMac to detect it.\n\nThe deal is you have to unplug ALL USB devices, have your wireless keyboard and mouse turned on, and restart. The system sees that there are no input devices and searches for them. Then asks you to type a passcode and hit return. \n\n\nA: (Mavericks) Make sure that your new keyboard is on and in the paring mode. then scroll your fingers across on your magic mouse. this will give you a glimpse of your desktop. once you there hold your fingers on the mouse or you will be taken to the lock screen again. \non the desktop you will see the pairing code that you will need to enter on your keyboard. write this down on a piece of paper and then release the mouse and enter the code and hit enter on your new keyboard. you have to be fast as the code resets quickly. then wait for a bit and the new keyboard will connect.\nGood luck :)\n\nA: i just bought a secondhand mac mini and the seller installed Monterey and had it paired with his wireless apple keyboard. when i got it home it wouldn’t pair wi  the my wireless Matius brand keyboard and plugging the keyboard in doesn’t work (seems the usb connection is simply for charging not for usb comms which is bazar).\nThé Matius keyboard has three wireless connection butta so you can set it up with three different devices and to pair you hold one of those buttons down for a few seconds and it will start blinking and continue for about 40 seconds or until it successfully pairs with a new device at which point it stops blinking.\ni can put the keyboard into pairing mode no possibles the issue is with the mini not interested in pairing with devices.\ni suspect if i reinstalled macOS overnight i would be able to pair it.\ni had tu is same problem last time i bought a new mac mini. you’d think apple would have a ios app to be a remote keyboard or some way of resolving this using another apple device. or just an on screen keyboard that can pop up (like the old key caps extension) or pairing menu item. can’t believe thousands of people don’t waste hours of time on this bs. sure if you live in a city or work in an office just borrow a keyboard. if you don’t you are stuck.\n", "Q: How can I save a template email on my iPhone so I can send it repeatedly? I am about to head to a Meetup, and I would like to be able to share my contact information with other people I meet. I wanted to save a \"template\" email on my iPhone containing my contact information with my vCard attached so I could open it up, enter a person's email address, send it to them, and then repeat for the next person I met.\nIf I save a draft email and send it, then the draft goes away and I can't send it again. Is there any way to resend an email from the iPhone to a new address, or any way to edit a sent message and send it again?\nHow can I save a template email on my iPhone so I can send it repeatedly?\n\nA: Use the Note App! Just type your email subject on the first line of the note. Hit return and type your body text. Each time you want to send this info to someone use the email function within the note. Your email is populated correctly and it's a really quick process. I use this system to send payment receipts to my guitar students. \n\nA: You can write a mailto link in Note app like this:\n\nmailto:someone@example.com?subject=This%20is%20the%20subject&cc=someone_else@example.com&body=This%20is%20the%20body\n\nUse %20 to add a blank and %3Cbr%3E for a new line.\nThe Note app on iPhone will recognise this link. You can just tap it to create a new mail.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailto\n\nA: You can send the template message to yourself and then forward it around to others. When forwarding you can select all text, scroll right in contextual menu to quote level, decrease qoute level and then delete forwarding info.\n\nA: There are a few iPhone apps that can help you with email templates. \nOne such app is Email & SMS Templates, an app that I have made. It will help you make a predefined email template with your contact information. It doesn't allow you to add attachments such as vCards in the current version though.\nYou can get the lite version which has all functionality except dropbox backup/restore of templates. And if you like it, support us by getting the full version and/or write a review.\n\nA: I was facing the very same issue with both emails and text messages, as I wanted to be able to send email and SMS templates. So I created an app called Actions - Fast forward everyday tasks for the iOS platform.\nThe app allows you to automate all sorts of repetitive tasks including: email templates, text templates, viewing the news, weather reports, converting currencies and much more.\nI believe my app could be of use to you, you can download it on the App Store: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id993488068\n\nA: I have used the \"Mail Aide\" app from the App Store, which allows for easily saving the draft and sending the same mail multiple times.\n\nA: If your email signature is not to long and if you have several email addresses, you can put your \"template text\" in the foot signature of your email. \nI use it to post by email to Wordpress since there is no \"offline app\" that stores text and pictures accordingly\n\nA: In MailChimp \nSet up a list called meetups.\nFill in the relevant details, email etc. Turn on the welcome email in the list settings.\nIn list settings set up a form which you can access from a website.\nIn list settings, edit the welcome emails to include all the details you need, LinkedIn, website etc. \nAt the meet up use your phone and show the form to the person. They will fill in an email address and receive the welcome email.\nYou will receive their email.\nAnd a list to follow up after.\nThis is great for boot he's set up on a laptop.. Where the welcome email contains special Info. For example contains a link to a special website. Or is the only way to enter a prise draw. \nIf you are brave enough you could live it by itself on a laptop chained to a table and see what happens. Sign optional. \n\nA: Try out Crisp, the email template keyboard, just released for iOS. It allows you to save unlimited templates and has iCloud sync across your devices. The best part - you can quickly send the template from any app (email, messages, social media) just by using the custom keyboard. You can download the Crisp - Email Template Keyboard at\nhttps://appsto.re/us/ax-I8.i \n", "Q: iPhone photos unidirectional sync? How can I get all new photos/movies added to my iPhone to be auto-downloaded into a specified folder each time I connect the iPhone to my Mac? (without deleting the downloaded photos/movies from the iPhone)\nThe \"Image Capture\" and \"AutoImporter\" apps seem to only be able to download all photos each time, which means that unless I choose the \"Delete after import\" option, I get many duplicates for each import.\n\nA: The forum build of DropBox will do that for you. I'm not sure if you can specify exactly what folder (by default it goes in a folder called 'Camera Imports' in your dropbox folder). It will even earn you more space.\nhttp://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=57787&replies=7\n", "Q: Is there a safe way to shut down a Mac that doesn't have a keyboard or mouse? I'm trying to safely shutdown a Mac desktop that does not have a keyboard or mouse connected to it any more, after hardware damage to the only keyboard and mouse in the house. It also does not have network access that I can get to from an iPhone, eg ssh etc is not enabled.\nBesides doing a force shutdown by holding the power button, is there a better way to shut down a Mac in this situation?\nThis is anonther example of when this might be needed.\n\nA: There are two possible ways provided by OSX.\n\n\n*\n\n*When you shutdown via menubar → shut down, you get a one minute counter till shut down. That's enough time to disconnect your devices.\n\n\n*System Preferences → Energy Saver → Schedule\n\n\nA: This solves the problem in the case you link to, but not in the general case:\nUse a plugged-in USB mouse to initiate the restart procedure ( » Restart) then unplug it during the one-minute countdown. A computer with no USB devices attached will restart, but it had a USB device at the time the restart was initiated.\nAnother option would be to use System Preferences » Energy Saver » Schedule to set a time to restart. You need a mouse plugged in to set the time to restart, but not at the time the restart happens.\nAnother option would be using the sudo shutdown -r +n command in Terminal, where n is the number of minutes in the future you want the computer to reboot.\nIn any of these cases, you need an input device attached to the computer to initiate the restart procedure, but not at the time the computer actually restarts.\n\nA: Yeah, is there more to this situation that could help us figure out what's going on?  Wonder if you could use an Apple Remote...\nBut if there's no keyboard NOW and you have no ability to add one to set up a solution, you're toast.  With no keyboard or mouse, it should be yelling at you to connect a bluetooth one on boot, yes?  You could then pair a bluetooth mouse or something (technically an answer, since \"connected\" was the description above) if you're just pranking someone.  Is that the goal?  \nAre you really asking, \"How can I shut down a Mac that's not networked that I can't access physically but have line of sight to?\"  You're very likely toast.\nI can't think of another situation where I've got a Mac that I can't shut down and don't have $4 to buy a used USB mouse from a thrift store...  Strange.  More description needed.\n\nA: Yes, As it turns out there is not really a better alternative to just pressing and holding the power button until the Mac shuts off. \nI thought there might have been some kind of a hidden gem like a S.O.S signal that could be signaled via the power button, to tell the computer to shutdown. \nThat is not the case and there is not really a reason for one, due to the relatively low risk for serious damage by performing a hard shutdown with the power button, thanks to the protections built in to the HFS+ file system to protect against data corruption.   \n", "Q: How do I backup Mac Server? It sounds like Time Machine doesn't backup everything on Mac Server:\nhttp://derflounder.wordpress.com/2010/03/02/restoring-mac-os-x-server-from-time-machine/\nSo what options do I have? Ideally I'd like a backup that I can restore on another Mac Mini and have it up and running instantly. Carbon Copy Cloner sounds like it should work, but I didn't see anything on their site that said it would definitely backup Mac Server (or I missed it).\nDoes anyone have a recommendation on what to do?\n\nA: Your primary option is to test your restore with live data so you can see all the things your server setup does that isn't covered by a Time Machine.\nYou'll also want to get a tool like Bender to handle exporting and importing settings on the server.app itself.\n\nIdeally, you have a setup document where you recorded each and every thing you configured since that will be your checklist that everything is covered. \n\n\n*\n\n*Did you set up alternate data location for some of the services?\n\n*Did you \"correct\" any dot files for users and run any terminal commands?\n\n*Do you have any launchd tasks that are not packaged (I often make routing and other changes that run to set static routes, roll over application log files, etc...)\n\n\nServer is a different beast and you can and will set up many large databases - some of which need to be archived and then restored later like mail, web, LDAP. As your server grows, you will come to think of each data as separate since backing them all up with the same frequency or mechanism isn't a good solution technically. Time Machine is a starting point, not an end point and using mirror technology like Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper! isn't usually the answer since it often takes a day or two to restore terabytes of data when you can instead have that data on a storage appliance and just use your OS and configuration backups to save the glue and code and tools - not the product.\n\nA: Yes pretty much anything that can do a boot-able backup of Mac OS X, should be able to do a back up of Mac OS X server. There are very few differences between Mac OS X, and Mac OS X Server, as demonstrated by how apple does Lion Server. \n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install Lion \n\n*Download and install Lion Server Apps\nSo in this case and as always with OS X server Apple just adds some more Applications that the client version lacks. Additionally, Carbon Copy Cloner support discussion confirms it works with Server.\n\nA: You can go for mirroring your entire Mac's hard drive to an external FireWire drive.\nYou can even boot from that disk using any other Mac and have your entire system at your fingertips, no tedious software installations, System Preference setting or desktop wallpaper hunting required. \nYou need: \n\n\n*\n\n*External firewire enclosure (usb might work just as well on newer macs)\n\n*The free version of SuperDuper.\nStep 1. Partition Your External Drive (Optional)\nStep 2. Confirm Your New Disk Partitions\nStep 3. Start Up and Configure SuperDuper\nStep 4. Confirm the Target Disk Erasing\nStep 5. Grab a Sandwich\nStep 6. In case of emergency => Boot Your Mac from the Clone in Target Disk Mode\nDONE.... Do this twice a week and you get REGULAR, BOOTABLE perfect COPIES OF YOUR OS X SERVER.\nDid i mention you can schedule the backups... wow!\n", "Q: Homebrew permissions & multiple users needing to brew update I'm using Homebrew to manage package installs on Lion (Lion Server actually but this shouldn't matter).\nHomebrew was installed under one user.

Here is a slightly expanded recipe to configure this:\nThe group needs to administer the local homebrew install directory.  So assign /usr/local to admin group (or your preferred group) and enable group write permissions:\nchgrp -R admin /usr/local\nchmod -R g+w /usr/local\n\nThe group also needs permissions for homebrew's local cache of formulae and source files at /Library/Caches/Homebrew:\nchgrp -R admin /Library/Caches/Homebrew\nchmod -R g+w /Library/Caches/Homebrew\n\nIf you run into further similar permissions issues while using homebrew from multiple accounts, note the offending path and consider trying the same approach.\nLeif Hanack has blogged a similar solution, where he creates and configures a dedicated user group brew for the purpose.\n--Update 2015-08-20\nI recently used this answer again to set up a guest account with homebrew access. In order to use Cask from the second admin account I had to also run the following commands:\nchgrp -R admin /opt/homebrew-cask\nchmod -R g+w /opt/homebrew-cask\n\n\nA: I was just going to comment on the accepted answer (but don't have the reputation for that yet.)\nAs a user of Caskroom.io, I would also recommend adding:\nsudo chown -R admin /opt/homebrew-cask\nsudo chmod -R g+w /opt/homebrew-cask\nsudo chmod -R g+w  /Library/Caches/Homebrew/\n\nsince cask, an extremely useful extension to homebrew, puts all its files in /opt/homebrew-cask\n\nA: \nIs this considered bad? I thought one of the advantages of using /usr/local/ for your installs was that you don't need sudo. But clearly we do.\n\nHomebrew, by default, sets itself up for single-user access to /usr/local. So you need to open up the permissions on the directory tree for it to be administered by more than one person.\nPeople don't need to run sudo here to administer homebrew. You just need to change some permissions. Since you already have:\n\nAll users who would need to modify Homebrew are members of admin group.\n\nYou need to do two more things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure everything under /usr/local belongs to the group admin; and\n\n*Make sure anyone from the group admin can write to anything under /usr/local.\n\n\nIn this case the changes to make are:\nchgrp -R admin /usr/local\nchmod -R g+w /usr/local\nchgrp -R admin /Library/Caches/Homebrew\nchmod -R g+w /Library/Caches/Homebrew\n\nAnd any user from the admin group should be able to manage the homebrew installation on the machine.  If you need to add a user to the admin group this can be accomplished like this:\n dseditgroup -o edit -a <username> -t user admin\n\n(that user will need to login again to have the privileges granted).\nFor sanity on the machine, you may want to consider creating your own fork of Homebrew and have your local homebrew git repository point to the local fork. That lets you customize Homebrew for your environment and control the versions of packages that people are able to install with the brew command. With multiple people doing installs you could run in to version issues or dependency issues.\n\nA: You need to give permission to the path. run this in command line and you will be fine to go. It worked for me:\nsudo chown -R $USER /usr/local\n\nA: I would vote for setting the group permission - and to me it seems that's just what it's there for and should not create a security problem.\n\n*\n\n*Don't use sudo.\n\n\ntl;dr Sudo is dangerous, and you installed TextMate.app without sudo anyway.\nHomebrew is designed to work without using sudo. You can decide to use it but we strongly recommend not to do so. If you have used sudo and run into a bug then it is likely to be the cause. Please don’t file a bug report unless you can reproduce it after reinstalling Homebrew from scratch without using sudo.\n\n", "Q: Copy folder & files with labeled files but strip the label? Is there an easier way to copy a folder that contains files with (colored) labels applied and strip those labels than making an Automator droplet/application?\nSo perfect would be having this to happen, but have it happen \"by default\" if I press ⌘ + D...\n\nAutomator goes like this...\nApplication receives files and folders as input\nDuplicate Finder Items\nGet Folder Contents (actually, the \"Repeat for each subfolder found\" should be checked)\nLabel Finder items (nothing selected, with is what happens when you click \"x\")\n\nSeems clunky, but when I've got Smart Folders returning, eg, all yellow labeled files, I don't want copies when I back a folder up by duplicating it.  The app works fine, but wanted to know if there was an easier way.\n\nA: You can set your Automator application as a service instead, and then apply a keyboard shortcut against that service as follows:\nIn System Preferences, go to Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Services\nFind the service on the list.\nTo the right of the service name, double-click.\nEnter the desired shortcut.\n\n", "Q: Accessing files/folders on home machine over internet I have a Mac Mini that I run as a home server and I'd like to share some folders on it over the Internet. I need the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*It needs to be a client app that talks to a central server (like Dropbox), not a server software that requires a public IP or VPN.\n\n*I should be able to access this anywhere over the internet through a web interface, or something else like webDAV etc.\n\n*It should just be an app, not something that requires installing any kexts or filesystems.\n\n\nNote: I'm not looking for a cloud storage service, I'm looking to access the files on my machine remotely, but through a central third party service rather than needing a public IP to that machine or a VPN.\nSo far the only thing I've found that does something like it is the PogoPlug Software. However I find it rather unstable, very inelegant and requires installing a filesystem driver, which I'm not happy for it to do.\nAre there any other services that offer something of the like but with a better made client app?\n\nA: Back to My Mac (iCloud)\nIf you're running Lion and have an iCloud account, you can use Back to My Mac. With Back to My Mac, your server will show up in the Finder's sidebar under Shared, just like it would if you were on the same local network.\nThis solution does not have a web interface, but I personally prefer connecting to my file servers the same way (through the Finder) whether I'm on the LAN or connecting remotely.\nSlink\nAn alternative to iCloud that doesn't require Lion is Slink, which I highly recommend. I've been using Slink as an alternative to VPN for about a year without any problems.\nSlink works similarly to VPN, connecting you to your network, not just your file server, but is extremely easy to setup (doesn't require entering a public IP anywhere). You setup your server by installing a System Preference pane (the Slink Agent), then setup the Slink app on each of the client computers.\nLike Back to My Mac, this solution does not have a web interface. Also, like Back to My Mac, your server will show up in the Finder's sidebar once you've used Slink to make the connection.\nYou can purchase Slink from Slinkware directly or on the Mac App Store. They also have a demo available.\nTeamViewer\nTeamViewer is a common cross-platform solution for remote control and file sharing over the Internet, and it's free for personal use. It doesn't integrate with the Finder as Back to My Mac and Slink do, but being cross-platform definitely has its advantages. It also doesn't have web-based access, but there are TeamViewer clients for OS X, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android, which may make up for it.\nLogMeIn Pro\nFor a web-based solution, you could use LogMeIn Pro. Because it's web-based, it's also cross-platform, and there are client apps for iOS and Android. Unfortunately, the free version doesn't include file sharing.\nYou may also want to check out LogMeIn Hamachi, which functions more like Slink, but with more options. I haven't tried Hamachi in a long time, but when I tested it, it was less reliable and more difficult to setup than Slink, so I went with Slink instead.\n\nA: There are several cloud storage companies offering that, as you mentioned, Dropbox being one of them. \nBox.com is another, they seem to offer more storage from the get go.\nMy lab uses Dropbox with a paid account which we like, but we're considering box.com due to more flexible pricing.\nTo share the files outright, we use URLs from dropbox which we give to collaborators. Are you looking to share files with the world? Or just close friends/associates?\n\nA: I've recently become a big fan of LiveDrive BriefCase. For $140/year you get 2TB of storage space that you can use to sync or share your files.\n\nA: I was going to point out LogmeIn but Joelseph got in first, I've used logmein a few times from the office, since its web based you shouldn't have many problems accessing it anywhere\n\nA: You could always use no-ip.com - they offer a free dynamic dns service (so no need for a static ip, but you do get a domain name) - then you could ftp to it.\n", "Q: What is the data corruption risk of force shutting down a running Mac? Eg when the power supply is cut or someone presses the power button for 5 seconds? How big of a risk am I taking to my data?  Is it a 1% chance of corrupting data? I know most mac these days have a Journal-ed File system, so I am guess the risk is very small? Is this an accurate assumption?\nAssuming the Mac is writing data, whats the risk of data corruptions? \nAssuming the Mac is idling, whats the risk of data corruptions? \n\nA: The journaled file system practically eliminates the chances that the filesystem itself will be in an inconsistent state after the next reboot.  But \"consistent\" is not the same as \"correct\".\nBefore journaling, the filesystem structures themselves could become damaged which could lead to more corruption occurring after the next boot.  So journaling limits the damage to whatever files were being written at the time of the crash.\nIf a file was being written at the time of a crash, the odds of its contents being incorrect are about 100%.  Exactly what manner of incorrectness would depend on exactly how it was being written at the time.  \nIf data was simply being appended, then the last few blocks will probably be truncated off when the journal is replayed.  But if bits of data were being modified throughout the file (such as in a database store), its likely to be in a very inconsistent state.  Applications which write files in that way sometimes have their own consistency checks for that purpose.\nBut most files in a typical OS X system get written sequentially.  In fact, many programs write a temporary file and don't move it in to replace the old version until the new version has been committed to disk.  This ensures that even a forced shutdown in the middle of writing a file only loses the new version, but preserves the old one.\nBottom line: something bad will happen to any data being written at the time of a crash, but how bad depends on the application.\n", "Q: Password lock for shut down screen I just got my iPhone stolen and the first thing they did was shut it off. I have a new iPhone and I noticed you have to slide it to power off. Yes, I had no idea. I owned my last phone three weeks. My question is, if it requires you to slide it could an app or something be made to be able to require a password beforehand?\n\nA: No, that's not likely without jailbreaking the phone.\nThere are only a limited number of features on the iPhone that an app can interface with.  I very much doubt \"shutdown\" is one of them.\n", "Q: Creating wrapper script for Mail.app to send mail from Terminal I'm trying to send mail from terminal with the help of bash and applescript.

The accepted answer provides a bash script that utilizes AppleScript to send an email with an attachment from a Terminal command line. This script may be more functionality than you need, but it's a great starting point. The code from the answer:\n\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"tell application \\\"Mail\\\"\n    activate\n\n    set MyEmail to make new outgoing message with properties {visible:true, subject:\\\"$2\\\", content:\\\"Some Message Here\\\"}\n    tell MyEmail\n        make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {address:\\\"$1\\\"}\n        make new attachment with properties {file name:((\\\"$3\\\" as POSIX file) as alias)}\n    end tell\nend tell\n\" | osascript\n\n\n\nA: Do you need to use Mail.app, or is your goal just to send an email message? If it's just to send an email message from the Terminal, you can use the sendemail command-line utility.\n/usr/local/bin/sendemail \n -f from@my.email.com \n -t my.recipient@their.email.com \n -s your.smtp.server:port \n -xu smtp.username.here \n -xp smtp.password.here \n -m message.body.goes.here\n\nObviously in Terminal all of that will need to go on a single line, with appropriate escapes and string quoting.

I also want them to back up to iCloud in case anything goes wrong with the Mac. Is this possible and how? \n\nA: I have accomplished this by plugging it into iTunes, selecting \"Back up to this computer\" and hitting Apply. It performs a backup to my computer and then I change it back to Back up to iCloud. As far as backing up automatically, I'm not aware of a way to do that.\n’Course, I mostly rely on iCloud, but should get in the habit of doing this a little more often just to keep a copy on my computer.\n\nA: There is no automatic way to switch back and forth or have both backup destinations be active at the same time, but you can easily set a daily or weekly alarm to switch things up.\nI've been in the practice of making sure my local backup is updated once every other week and haven't seen any issues from this. I do the same thing with time machine backups but on a longer scale - swapping a pair (or three with offsite rotation) on a monthly basis. The first backup can take a bit longer, but I've got a few copies of my data in several places for that extra level of protection in case my most recent backup has problems or gets broken in some unexpected manner.\n", "Q: My Mac freezes when using Safari I am using a Mac with OSX Snow Leopard. \nSometimes I am playing some media through Safari and my Mac freezes. I basically cannot do anything. The trackpad does not work anymore as well as the keyboard. The only solution is to restart the system.\nThe question is:\nWhy the system suddenly freezes? Is the any way to prevent it? Or is there any way to avoid restarting the system every time?\n\nA: This is a common Flash interaction issue (sounds like). I use the Safari extension ClickToFlash so I can control what Flash runs and when. And, I also use AdBlock to be sure those pesky side Ads don't bother me. You can still run Flash, but you have control and the freezing will hopefully stop.\n\nA: Like many others, I had some of those same issues on Lion (my computer would eventually become responsive - usually.)  What I did was delete Flash from my computer, and when you really, really want to use Flash, open the page in Chrome, which has Flash built in the browser.  If you enable the developer option in preferences (Preferences -> Advanced -> Show Develop menu in menu bar), you'll have a menu item for just such times.  \nYou'll find a lot of sites have a fallback to HTML5 for the times Flash isn't available, but if it is, they'll use Flash.  This also has the added benefit of making web sites aware that people don't like Flash.  \n", "Q: Lion - override windows resizing restrictions for certain applications I am a long time user of a windows manager tool in osx (SizeUp) that I love as it allows me to tile several different windows on my laptop screen while having a full editing window open on my secondary screen for coding.  \nI recently made the move up to OSX Lion and noticed that certain applications now seem to have restrictions on them for how they resize.

This means that I am unable to tile them effectively on my smaller screen.\nI am wondering if there is a way of overriding these restrictions so that I am able to tell osx to ignore the settings globally (i.e. for all apps) or can I disable the restrictions on a per app basis?  Either solution would help.  \nConversely, if there is another windows management tool that is able to universally override these restrictions, that would work as well,\nThanks.\n\nA: I was hopeful that \"moon\" with it's custom resize window options would work, but if you set a custom window size lower than whatever iTunes doesn't want to go than, it ignores it and uses the iTunes minimum anyway.

I can't execute the file and this is the only thing that's standing out to me.  How can I get rid of it?  \nJust as some background, I copied this from a Time Machine backup.  \n\nA: If the file or directory has extended attributes, you'll see an @ in the permissions field. For extended security information (ACLs), you'll see a +.\nFrom man ls on OS X:\n-@      Display extended attribute keys and sizes in long (-l) output.\n\nThe xattr program can be used to display and manipulate extended attributes. Take a look at what's there before deciding to go while deleting those attributes, though. Definitely take a quick look at the man page for xattr too.\nA quick example from some example PHP compromise code I keep around for reference:\n$ ls -@l php-compromise.php \n-rw-r--r--@ 1 user  group  502620 Jul  5  2011 php-compromise.php\n    com.apple.FinderInfo        32 \n    com.apple.TextEncoding      15 \n\n\nA: Thanks to @Jeff for the correction.

I'm using an external 27\" Thunderbolt display with my 27\" iMac and I want the iMac and display to have the same height. By default, the Thunderbolt display is about an inch shorter than the iMac, which is quite annoying.\nI'm sure this problem comes up all the time. Is there any solution for evening out the heights? I'm open to something as hacky as \"this book is the right height – put it under the display.\"\n\nA: Looks a product was created for this task. Checkout the HiRise by Twelve South as reviewed by MacWorld. Boom iMac and Display = Level.\n\n\nMac accessory maker Twelve South has introduced the HiRise for iMac, a stand that lets users elevate their desktop Mac monitors to a better viewing level.\nThe $80 device is designed to support all generations of Mac that have an L-shaped stand, including the largest 27-inch displays on the latest generation of iMacs. The stand itself looks a little bit like an older, metal-shelled hard drive—a reminder of the days when drives and displays were separate components of the same computer.\n\n\nA: Ars Technica's Eric Bangerman has solved this problem…twice:\n\nvia Ars gear: 2008 triple-headed \"Harpertown\" Mac Pro\n\nA: There's the LapWorks 10\" Heavy Duty Swivel:\n \nUsed under the Thunderbolt monitor, levels the two perfectly and makes the the Thunderbolt monitor nice and swively.\n\nA: A piece of plywood (or, if necessary, two pieces of plywood sandwiched together) or cutting board made from  bamboo or plastic can provide material for risers. You can easily cut and sand these materials with simple tools. Hardwood can also be used, though it will be harder to shape. Fit and finish quality will depend on your skill and patience, but if you use one of the softer materials,  a casual evening's work should produce something that registers okay at three feet.\nOn the other hand, if you have access to a CNC router or a Bridgeport mill you can machine the riser out of a solid block of aluminum to produce an aesthetically pleasing solution.\nYou could take this one step further by extending the riser out towards the viewer and incorporate cut-out trays to store the mouse, paperclips, etc.\n\nA: Carefully tap the outer \"corners\" of the base of the Thunderbolt Display to accept threaded \"leveler\" feet commonly found on the bottom of tables and electronics cabinets.\n\nImage source Edmund Optics. Provided for reference only.\nIf drilling into the base of your monitor isn't something you're comfortable with, you might find self-stick rubber feet that are thick enough to provide the appropriate rise.\n\nA: I know this is an old ask/thread, but thought I'd post in case anyone is still looking for a good and cheap way to accomplish this.  I've been using a book for a few years now and decided to find a better way and more aesthetically pleasing way.  I really don't like the look of the stands that are out there for this specific purpose.  I also think the stands available are too expensive for what I was wanting.  I just fixed the problem for good and for only $9.  I ordered these:\n4 Large Extra Tall #2-1\" H X 1.10\" W Round Rubber FEET Bumpers - Made in USA - Heavy Duty - Non Marking for Furniture, Tables, Chairs, Desks, Benches, Sofas, Chests, Other Large Items.\nI measured the book I was using to lift the display and found the closest thing to it on Amazon (above).  Got them today and they work perfectly.  I just placed them underneath the display in the four corners and can't be happier with it.\n\n\n\nA: I'd recommend buying this book: \nhttp://www.amazon.com/Life-Times-Thunderbolt-Kid-Memoir/dp/0767919378/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1330596630&sr=8-7\nIt's exactly 1\" thick, put it under the monitor.\n\nA: \nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010E8N5E0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\nI just bought a 27\" iMac and ran into this issue and some $24 monitor stands I bought for my 27\" Thunderbolt Displays a few months ago work perfectly.  The support stands are 3-part, 2 plastic and some rubber feet.  I removed one of the plastic support pieces on the stand I use for the iMac and it lowered that monitor perfectly in line with the other 2 that use both pieces.\n\nA: If you want something more elegant than a book under the iMac, you can can add vesa mounts to your iMac and Thunderbolt display and then attach it to a desk or wall mounted adjustable monitor arm.  There are many to choose from but here is one pictured below to give you an example. So you could technically mount both or just one to a VESA stand. Note that most monitor stands allow you to infinitely adjust the height, angle, rotation, with in pre-determined ranges.\nJust be aware of the maximum weight capacity of the VESA monitor mount you choose. The 27\" iMac weighs 11.2kg or ~ 24.7 LBS and the 27\" Thunderbolt display weighs ~ 10kg or ~ 22.1 LBS without their included stands. \n\n\nA: Just saw this post, as I was looking for an answer to the same question. Discovered that two old desktop drives fit nicely side-by-side under the 27 inch thunderbolt monitor. Raises it almost perfectly with the iMac screen and provide plenty of stability.\n\nA: This is such a massive oversight by the apple design team, I myself use books to prop up the display, just had to find the right combo.\nGood luck\n", "Q: How can I download plain .txt files in Safari/Chrome?

I'm thinking about getting a MacBook Pro, one of the 15\" ones in the low end of the spectrum.\nI can see two models in on-line shops that match my price range (namely, the MD318D/A and the MC723D/A). One model is 100 euros cheaper than the other, but weirdly, it seems to have the better specs: the MC723D/A comes with a 750GB hard drive as opposed to 500GB.\nAll the other specs seem identical, down to the size of the L6 cache, the processor, and the make and model of the graphics adapter. The only special thing the expensive one seems to have is OS X Lion instead of Snow Leopard. Can the software update account for a hundred euro's difference? \nHere are the data sheets I'm comparing: MD318D, MC723D - German only, sorry,  Amazon.com doesn't seem to have them.\nWhere can I find reliable information on each generation so I can figure out whether the price difference is justified or not, and what the extra €100 would actually get me? \n\nA: Try this\nhttp://www.everymac.com/systems/by_capability/mac-specs-by-machine-model-machine-id.html\n\nA: I trust the english Wikipedia on technical specs about the Macbook Pro.\n\nA: Check out EveryMac.com's Ultimate Mac Comparison tool that lets you pick and compare between any set of Mac hardware.

The differences are that the 2720 has a better max turbo speed (in some conditions, it will be faster), supports faster ram (which you will probably not use), and has a slightly better integrated gpu.  Amusingly, it appears that the cheaper computer has the better processor.\n", "Q: Can a Macbook Air host a network? I'm going to be away for a few days and will be taking both my Macbook Air and my iPad away with me.\nWhilst we're stuck in a hotel room I may not have internet connection (I'm not willing to pay for hotel wifi) but would like to be able to share the iTunes library between my iPad / iPhone / Air\nWithout being connected to a router can I do this?  Can the Air host its own private network just for local devices?\n\nA: There are a couple of ways of acheiving this:\nAdhoc, peer to peer, computer to computer\nYou can create a peer to peer wireless network between devices that does not require an Access point or other routing device.  This is usually known as creating an ad-hoc wireless network, or a computer to computer one, rather than an infrastructure one.\nI currently only have access to a machine with Mountain Lion on, and things appear different (this method is unavailable), but in Lion or earlier you should be able to:\n\n*\n\n*Go to the menu bar, go to your network indicator and choose \"Create\nNetwork...\"\n\n*Enter a network name, and security settings if required\n\n*On your iPad, go to Settings, go to WIFI and choose the network you\njust created. Enter the password if you set one and you should get\nconnected.\n\nAny devices connected this network should only be able to communicate with other devices on the network, no routing or other traffic is available.\nInternet Sharing\nAnother option is to use Internet Sharing.  On the off chance that you have free or cheap hotel internet:\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences and go to the Sharing pane under the\nInternet & Network heading.\n\n*On the list of services to the left, select Internet Sharing. Don’t\ncheck it quite yet — there’s a few options that need to be set\nfirst.\n\n*Depending on what your current internet source is, select it from\nthe menu next to “Share your connection from.”. Built-in Ethernet is\na good choice, but if you have a mobile broadband dongle you could\nselect that also.\n\n*In the “To computers using” box, select and check AirPort/Wifi from\nthe list.\n\n*Click on the AirPort/wifi Options button to configure security\nsettings if you want any.\n\n*In the window that pops up, type a basic Network Name, Click OK.\nSetting up Mac OS X Internet Sharing\n\n*The configuration portion is finished, so the only thing left to do\nis check the box next to Internet Sharing and enable it. A\nconfirmation message will appear — click Start to complete the\nprocess.\n\n*Now that your Mac’s internet is being transmitted from your AirPort\nWiFi card to other devices, you should see an different icon in your\nmenu bar. If you do, you’re in business!\n\n*On your iPad, go to Settings, go to WIFI and choose the network you\njust created. Enter the password if you set one and you should get\nconnected.\n\nNow any machine connected to the same wifi network can route through the ethernet or dongle connection on the air.

I'd like to find out the computer name of a Windows PC (like the name shown in the 'Shares' section of the Finder, e.g. bill-pc) given only its IP address. nslookup doesn't do the trick.\nI'm also interested in the reverse lookup: given its Windows name, how can I find out its IP address? ping bill-pc or ping bill-pc.local seems not to work in some cases.\n\nA: If you're using Lion, you can use smbutil:\nusage: smbutil [-hv] subcommand [args]\nwhere subcommands are:\n help       display help on specified subcommand\n lookup     resolve NetBIOS name to IP address\n status     resolve IP address or DNS name to NetBIOS names\n view       list resources on specified host\n dfs        list DFS referrals\n identity   identity of the user as known by the specified host\n\nFor example (assuming 192.168.1.9 is a valid IP on your network):\nsmbutil status 192.168.1.9\nsmbutil lookup bill-pc\n\nIf you're using Snow Leopard, you should be able to use nmblookup:\nnmblookup -A 192.168.1.9\nnmblookup bill-pc\n\n", "Q: How can I batch convert image files and PDFs to TIFF? I have a lot .jpeg, .png and .pdf Files and I want to convert all of them to .tiff all at once.\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: However, the Automator solution by @Matt Love will not convert multipage PDF files to individual TIFFs. You would need to run two separate Automator workflows, one to convert PDF files to images and one to change the format of image files. As an alternative, you might consider using AppleScript with Mac OS X's built-in Image Events.\nUnlike a simple Automator workflow, the script given below (syntax-colorized version here) converts images and PDF files to TIFF, does error reporting and does not break down when failing to handle some files. Before running the script, select the files to be processed in Finder.\nEDIT: For multi-page PDFs, only page 1 is converted.\n# this script converts all PDFs and images selected in Finder\n# to the TIFF format and appends .tif to the file name\n\nset t to (time of (current date))\ntell application \"Finder\" to set sel to selection\nset errors to {}\ntell application \"Image Events\"\n    repeat with img_file in sel\n        try\n            set img_file to img_file as text\n            set img to open img_file\n            save img as TIFF in (img_file & \".tif\")\n            if (class of result) is not file then error \"could not convert to TIFF\"\n            close img\n        on error errMsg\n            set errors to errors & ((name of (info for (img_file as alias)) & \": \" & errMsg & \"\\n\") as text)\n            try\n                close img\n            end try\n        end try\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n# error report\nset errcount to length of errors\nset msg to (((length of sel) - errcount) as text) & \" files converted to TIFF in \" & ¬\n    (((time of (current date)) - t) as text) & \" seconds.\\n\\n\"\nif errors is not {} then\n    set msg to msg & errcount & \" errors occurred: \\n\" & errors as text\nend if\ndisplay dialog msg\n\n\nA: Next to an Automator script or a commercial tool to solve for multi-page PDFs, another option is to use ImageMagick's convert tool. For example executing the following from the same directory:\nfor i in *; do magick convert -density 300 ./$i -depth 8 ./$i.tiff; done\n\n\nA: On a Mac, you can also cd into the directory of your image, and use:\nsips -s format tiff input.pdf --out output.tiff\n\nSource: http://www.mactricksandtips.com/2008/07/convert-images-using-terminal.html\n\nA: You can use sips:\nfor i in *; do sips -s format tiff $i --out $i.tif; done\n\nBash.\n\nA: Automator\nYou can batch convert these files by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator from /Applications\n\n*Create a new Workflow\n\n*Drag the Get Specified Finder Items to the workflow builder.\n\n*Drag the Change Type of Images to the workflow builder.

I need to backup Mac data into our NTFS storage partition. Are there any issues/drawbacks I should consider?\n\nA: If connected directly to your Mac, you may need to install something like MacFuse and NTFS-3G or Tuxera NTFS to be able to write to NTFS partitions. Per Apple Support:\n\nMac OS X can read and write FAT volumes, but can only read NTFS volumes.\n\nIf the drive is connected over the network, then your main issues will probably be network speed/latency, authentication, and the size of the backup data compared to the size of the drive.\n\nA: Since you are going over the network. They only drawback relating to NTFS is that if other PCs will be using the file share that are not Macs, you might want to disable some of the files Mac OS is creating on every network volume it touches. Consider adjusting some setting to prevent .DS_Store files from being written to the NTFS drive, that might clutter the \"Windows Experience\" as referenced from Share Files from Mac OS X to Windows PC’s Easily\n\nWhat about the .DS_Store files?\nDepending on the Windows PC settings, you might see a bunch of .DS_Store files on the Mac file system. These are normal but if you’re peeved by them, you can disable .DS_Store files by entering the following defaults write command in OS X’s Terminal:\n\ndefaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true\n\n\nIf you want them back, just switch that to ‘false’ at the end.\n\n", "Q: Does the Mac Pro 2008 display memory speeds accurately in System Information?

It could be that Alfred is closing the transient Terminal.app window that it's using to run the script. To test that add a sleep 60m to the end of the script which should keep the window on the screen.\nOr it could be that all stdout/stderr from the script is going to /dev/null or something similar.

What is the best way to connect the two?\nUPDATE: Considering the price of all the adapters and the fact that the PS3 doesn't support my iMac's resolution I decided to get an other display.\n\nA: A HDMI to display port adapter should work with the iMac in question since it supports Target Display Mode. \nHere is an example of an HDMI to Display Port adapter the StarTech HDMI to DisplayPort Active Converter. Lastly video wise you would need a display port to mini display port cable to plug into the iMac.\nAs for the audio you can use a optical audio cable from the PS3 optical audio out to the line in port on the back of the iMac.\nOr you can use a Digital Audio To Analog Audio Converter such as this and a send the output to the iMac, amplifier, or computer speakers with the proper adapter cable.\nWord of caution: Depending on the speed of the active HDMI to DisplayPort converter, the audio and video may not be in sync.\nNote: that is will not work with  any iMac that has Thunderbolt since these macs can only provide DisplayPort output capabilities, and that may be spotty at best according to Thunderbolt port to mini Display-Port cable, where there were reports of graininess. \n\nA: This YouTube video suggests that the Belkin AV360 can be used to connect a PS3 and an iMac. However, the AV360 seems pretty pricy - currently listed on the site at $149.99.\nAnother YouTube video shows a different solution - a HDMI to Mini Display Converter.

First of all, I only want to disable the standard volume buttons - I do not want to disable the buttons to change brightness, launchpad... \nI need this because I want those buttons to trigger scripts for finer volume adjustment using FastScripts.\n\nA: Karabiner (Formerly called KeyRemap4MacBook)\nallows to intercept the keyplay.\n\n\n*\n\n*Assign your scripts for fine volume adjustment to F11 and F12 (actually it's a combination of fn+vol. up/vol. down).\n\n*Download and install Karabiner.\n\n*Open the Karabiner preferences via the menu icon, which is a black square (like a keyboard key), somewhere in your menu bar.\n\n*In the Tab Change Key select the options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Volume Down to F11\n\n*Volume Up to F12\n\n*F11 to Volume Down\n\n*F12 to Volume Up\n\n\nThis will switch the behavior of the function keys with the volume keys: Now you can use fine volume adjustment with one touch and the usual volume adjustment using fn+vol. up/vol. down.\nNote that there is also an option \"Fine grained volume controls\" that enables fine grained volume controls by default, so you can do this purely within Karabiner, without any other scripts.  You can find this in the giant list, under \"Change F1..F19 Key & Functional Key\" and then the submenu \"Change Functional Key\".\n\n", "Q: There was an error in the Mac App Store.

I am trying to get my head around the difference between the Apple products above.\nTo me, Apple VNC (or rather generic VNC clients) perform the same basic function as Remote Desktop implementations (Apple, Microsoft, Citrix, etc), and various Screen Sharing apps.\nAlso, it seems that Apple Remote Desktop can push scripts down to clients, and change some settings, much the same way as Apple Remote Management, and Remote Events seem to infer they do, by name.\nMoreover, Remote Login is something (unless you wanted a shell) that you would do as part of a Remote Desktop / Screen sharing / VNC operation, no?\n\nA: You are correct, VNC is a simpler version of Remote Desktop (note: Remote Desktop uses the VNC protocol in addition to adding a lot more features)\nRemote Desktop offers more management features; ability to black out host computers screen, push updates, file transfers etc (think TeamViewer but by Apple).\nhttp://www.apple.com/remotedesktop/\nVNC doesnt have any of these options, its just a simple way to access a remote screen.\nRemote Login allows you to SSH to a remote computer (command line - you dont see the remote desktop)\neg You may want to run a command on a remote computer, you could connect using VNC and open terminal or instead you could remote login via SSH and run the command without actually interacting with the screen of the remote computer\nUpdated to include @Wheat Williams notes below\n\nA: Apple remote desktop, remote management etc. are remote support tools provided by Apple Inc. in order to remotely access any Mac or Windows Computers. In addition to it, computers can also be accessed remotely by deploying on premise remote support appliance such as Bomgar or RHUB appliances or using remote support tools such as logmeinrescue, gosupportnow, GoToMyPC etc. \n", "Q: How can I keep my iPhone headset untangled? When I pack away my headset, I loosely loop the cable  around my fingers and then stuff the headset in my jacket pocket. When I retrieve the headset later, it has inevitably turned into a little bird's nest and I need to spend a little while to untangle it. That is annoying.\nThe cable of my iPhone headsets (both the included standard set, and the in-ear variety) are somehow more \"rubbery\" than the old walkman cables so they tend to straighten themselves out, which helps to keep them untangled. But it's not working for me, the bird's-nest problem remains.\nIs there a special trick, or method, to easily and quickly pack the headset away in such a way that it comes out untangled?\n\nA: Oddly, not wrapping the cords is the simplest strategy, just crunch it up and throw it in your pocket. The more grippy cord will avoid tying knots as long as you don't go to the trouble to wind things up.\nIf you prefer to wind, then fold in half, twist once, fold and twist one more time. I find this to stay put when in the pocket and you can get things unfurled in a snap without needing to \"finish\" the coil.\nThat or a small amount of oil or grease to make the cord less sticky.\n\nA: Wrap them around something, even if it's just an inch of card.  You can get nice cable tidy key rings that are really good for this, but a piece of card with 2 slits will do the same job:\n\n\nA: What I always do, which seems to work okay, is to fold it in half repeatedly until I get something about four inches long. After removing this from my pocket, it's usually a bit tangled, but only in a couple places. It never takes me more than maybe ten seconds to unravel it.\nIf you need a product recommendation (I know this isn't SE-frindly, but I do have a non-recommendation answer) to keep them untangled, Quirky's Wrapster ($6.99) works quite well, and also functions as an iPhone stand.\n\nA: Cut an empty plastic shotgun shell off where the brass meets the plastic. Wind cord around fingers and insert cord into the empty shell. \nIn the end it would look similar to this:\n\n\nA: Lifehacker provides another interesting solution to keeping headphones tangle-free: Use Paracord as a Tangle-Free Headphone Sleeve\n\nBy running your headphone wires through some paracord and rebuilding the Y junction, you get an audio set that hardly ever ties in on itself, is far less prone to breaks or rips, and can be changed in color, too, if you don't dig the hue the cord came in.\n\nBe warned, you're going to want to be comfortable with a soldering iron before attempting this hack.\nStep-by-step instructions are provided on Instructables: Sleeving Earphone/Earbud Cords with Paracord.\n\nA: For ordinary earbuds like the Apple stock product I repeatedly fold the cable in half until I have just enough length to tie the bundle into a loose overhand knot. (Sounds like heresy, but I learned this technique for storing cables from a \"big time\" touring concert sound company.) Been practicing it with all sorts of cables for better than twenty years without any negative fallout.\n\nI added this photo of my cord knot after this answer was accepted by Torben, who I believe was most interested in the Devil Horn Technique mentioned below.\n\nAfter tying the initial knot in this particular cord bundle the loose ends were a little too long for pocket carry so I tucked them back into the center of the knot and pulled gently to tighten them into place, converting the initial overhand knot into a Double Overhand Knot\n\nHowever, I do coil my good earbuds neatly and keep them in a little pouch. Same for the Jlab phone headset I use for every day carry.\nIf none of these techniques suit,  there are many practitioners of what, for lack of a better description, is referred to as  The Devil Horn Technique\n\nPretend you’re at a Def Leppard concert and make the devil horns with your left hand. (Don’t pretend you don’t know what I mean — middle and ring fingers bent and held down by the thumb, index and pinky extended.) Tuck the buds underneath the middle and ring fingers to secure them and use your devil horns as posts around which to loop the cord. (Some people advocate a figure-eight wrap, but I find a simple loop works fine.) Leave a couple inches of cord at the end. Slide the loop off the devil horns, and wrap the remaining cord around the middle of the loops, creating a little bundle. Thread the plug end through the loop opposite the buds and give it a gentle pull to tighten the bundle. This little package now fits neatly in your pocket, is almost entirely tangle proof, and unravels with ease.\n\n\nA: The way i did it is by winging it around my fingers, but upon every winding around my hand, i rotate the cord 360 degrees between my index and thumb (of my other hand). This compensates for the rotational tension caused by winding it around while holding it fixed in your other hand. This works so well, i can put it down on a table and not have it unwind, it just stays there\n\nA: What works good too, is to fill your pocket starting with the earbud end of the cable, keeping the jack at the top. Pull on the jack when you need your headset.\nIt's a trick done on a boat to put a rope in a bag and avoid knots.\n\nA: Lifehacker has shared another effortless and zero cost solution to this stone-age problem.

If you package them similarly to how they came out of the box, it works well. \n", "Q: iOS apps \"could not be purchased at this time\" Every time I open the App Store on my iPad, after about 30 seconds, a message appears saying that a number of apps \"could not be purchased at this time.\" This problem seems to originate by attempting to download an app or an update, then canceling when it prompts me for my password. Even if I download it successfully at a later time, the notice persists.\nHow can I stop this notice from appearing?\n\nA: This thread on Apple Support Communities has an extensive discussion of the problem. People there deserve credit for finding this solution.\nIt seems to be caused by a problem in the internal SQLite database file that iOS uses to track downloads from and journal interactions with the App Store. The solution is to wipe the file. The file itself isn't really important; for the most part, it's just a local record of past downloads. AFAIK, the only supported thing you can do to clear that database is a full wipe and restore from backup; however, the free tool iExplorer is able to delete it.\nIn the iExplorer interface:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your device, and navigate to Media > Downloads\n\n*In the Downloads folder, you’ll find a file called ‘downloads.[some number].sqlitedb’\n\n*Delete that file (Optionally: back it up first.)\n\n*Reboot your iOS device. (A clean, empty version of the sqlite database will automatically be created.)\n\n\nTa-da! You should be free of that problem... unless some future download re-triggers the underlying bug. (Only Apple can fix that.)\n\nFor those curious: \nI did some poking around in that SQLite database. It seems that there’s a bug somewhere that is resulting in occasional entries in there with a flag indicating they need to be purchased -- but the App Store itself rejects the purchase attempt for reasons such as “you’ve already purchased that app”.\nSpecifically, a value of 1 in the ‘is_purchase’ field of the ‘download’ table in that sqlitedb file seems to exactly correspond with the name and count of apps that “cannot be purchased” in the super-annoying dialog box.\n", "Q: rebuild itunes library after crash I had a hard drive crash and lost the system files, but recovered all my iTunes folders and files e.g. Books, Downloads, iTunes U, Mobile Applications, etc.  The iTunes library file \"iTunes Library.itl\" went down with the crash.  What's the best way to rebuild my iTunes library now that I have a new HDD?\n\nA: You have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*restore the library from a backup copy (previous libraries folder in the iTunes folder, Time Machine, other backups)\n\n*re-import the songs by dragging the media into the library section and allowing it to add the tracks back to the library - optionally you can import any playlists or library xml documents that saved the playlists, ratings and data relating to the tracks and not embedded into the media files on the drive\n\n\nIf you have enabled iTunes Match, you will also be safe from most data loss since all playlists are stored in the cloud unless it contains exclusively tracks that were not matched to the cloud like podcasts and other oddities like voice memos and low bit-rate recordings.\n\nA: If you still have the 'iTunes library.xml' file, start iTunes and get it to generate a new .itl library file.  Once that's there, close iTunes, and open the .itl file with your preferred text editor.  You'll just see a bunch of unreadable gibberish that makes up the library file iTunes reads.  Delete everything in the document and save it.\nNow when you restart iTunes, it will say it's trying to import your library.  When you tell  it to stop trying (because it won't get anywhere), it will say it's corrupted and rebuild a new one from the information in the .xml file.\n", "Q: How do I stop messages appearing on the homescreen of my iPad2?
