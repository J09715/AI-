["Q: Micromax USB Modem Model MMX 352G not recognized in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS It recognizes my modem as a mass storage device. Can someone provide me step by step instruction on how to get it working?\nBrowsed through some similar questions, none of the answers made sense, but seems like output of lsusb is important, so here goes\nBus 002 Device 004: ID 1c9e:f000  \nBus 002 Device 003: ID 064e:f203 Suyin Corp. \nBus 002 Device 002: ID 8087:0020  \nBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 001 Device 003: ID 0bda:0158 Realtek Semiconductor Corp.

You can keep usb stick connected.\n\n\nNow that you have everything setup, you can create configuration for this USB modem in network connections. \n", "Q: How do I change the Unity launcher color? I'm trying to change the panel and launcher color from gray to green or blue. I've tried myunity ccsm and the stock settings. But everytime I change the color it doesn't stick it reverts after I close the program used.\n\nA: I just installed Unsettings and it's excellent, handles the launcher and panel colour, opacity etc. It does a lot of other stuff too. There's a short piece about it here:\nhttp://www.noobslab.com/2012/04/install-unsettings-tweak-tool-on-ubuntu.html\n\nA: This is a bug and is already reported and confirmed.\nAll you can do is wait till that's fixed. :(\nI can't change my dash and launcher color, too,  let's hope that gets fixed asap. ^ ^\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/975350\n\nA: For Launcher, you can try with MyUnity:\nsudo apt-get install myunity\n\nFor panel, I'm afraid there is an only way to change the color of the panel, but you probably have to edit the theme files manually.\nFor example, to change the panel's color to black for the \"Ambiance\" theme, you have to find and edit the     /usr/shared/themes/Ambience/gtk-2.0/apps/gnome-panel.rs \nfile. Replace the lines at the beginning, in the \"panel\" style from:\nbg_pixmap[NORMAL] = \"img/panel.png\"\nbg[NORMAL] = \"#4b4a46\"\n\nto\nbg[NORMAL] = \"#000000\"\n\nBut the changes might get lost if the theme gets updated.\n", "Q: Getting error on Downloading updates Err http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates/main gnome-control-center-data all 1:3.4.2-0ubuntu0.2\n  Connection failed

There is only sound via USB adapter. My headphones or speakers are working only through this device. The sound setting widget doesn't show any sound card device beside USB. I have updated ALSA driver from launchpad and also I have removed the  ~./pulse directory, I have tried gnome-alsamixer ...but my sound card is just gone. I tred to find out if that is some hardware issue or if that is this unlucky kernel update. Take a look on this output of: \nwget -O alsa-info.sh http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && chmod +x ./alsa-info.sh && ./alsa-info.sh\n\nhttp://www.alsa-project.org/db/?f=80c541c891c4bce51447c9d2f75ea7f9d8b678a4\nHere is the alsa-base.conf (with included blacklist):\nhttp://www.pasteall.org/32574\nand output of: \ngrep \"Codec:\" /proc/asound/card*/codec*\ngrep: /proc/asound/card*/codec*: No such file or directory\n\nWhat else can I provide to find out what's wrong?\n\nA: Based on the information you have provided so far, it appears like the driver module for your internal sound-card has been blacklisted. You said that Ubuntu can detect and work with the sound card if you boot from Live CD. So spend the effort to boot from the Live CD again and do a lsmod | grep snd there, in this way you'll be able to know what extra modules are loaded there for your internal sound-card. Then come back to your Ubuntu installation. Check the file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-oss.conf and search there for those missing modules and if found comment them out by placing a # before them. Finally perform sudo modprobe <missing modules> to load them into kernel.\n\nA: Can you try this, that i used to solve a similar issue:\nsudo modprobe snd-hda-intel\n\nand add a line with snd-hda-intel at the end of /etc/modules.\nI think this can solve your issue.\n\nA: perhaps try this link http://www.mysamplecode.com/2012/05/no-soundcards-found-linux-mint-12.html?showComment=1390338718155#c4449143529292145936\nworked for me !\nOpen a terminal (Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal) and type\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nand then change the line from\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nto\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash pci=use_crs\"\n\nSave the file.\nAfter saving the file run update-grub\nsudo update-grub\n\nRestart the Machine !\n", "Q: Ubuntu One Windows Client 3.0.1 - Sync not connecting I've got sync working at home on Natty and I need to access files at work.

This cycle loops endlessly.\nI'm suspicious that it's a problem with my proxy setup.

I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 with Gnome Shell 3.4. Since day one I had some random crashes mainly after reloading or during search. After a lot of research I concluded that user-theme extension is to blame. Only when disabled Gnome Shell runs 100% smoothly. So my question is: Is there a way to install a theme without using user-theme extension?\nedit: Trying to install it via Gnome Tweak Tool without user-theme extension won't work because of [this][1].\n\n\nA: Yes you can.\nExtract your theme to ~/themes or /usr/share/themes\nI use this command for manually change theme and icon on ubuntu.\nOpen terminal Ctrl+Alt+T and run following command:\nIcon Pack\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme 'theme'\n\nTheme\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme 'theme'\n\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences 'theme'\n\ngconftool-2 --set --type string /apps/metacity/general/theme 'theme'\n\nChange 'theme' with your theme name\n\nA: Install\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell-extensions \n\n\nAfter Installation Press Alt+F2 and type 'r' to restart Gnome Shell, or just logout and login back. Open Gnome Tweak Tool to change/install shell Themes.\n", "Q: Ibus icon isn't displayed correctly in Gnome-shell I'm on Ubuntu 12.04 with Gnome 3 and I'm using Ibus to input Vietnamese.\nThe problem is after starting ibus, the ibus indicator vibrated for a while then the icon and its menu displayed somehow weird like the image below:\nhttp://i48.servimg.com/u/f48/12/18/00/70/ibus10.jpg\nAnyone help me please!\n\nA: This is caused by a flawed icon file, /usr/share/icons/ubuntu-mono-dark/status/22/input-keyboard.svg. You can replace the file with this modified icon. Refer to this bug report.\n\nA: You may try ibus-gjs.\nibus-gjs is supposed IBus UI in GNOME Shell environment.\nThe easiest way to install ibus-gjs on Ubuntu 12.04 is through the following PPA:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~mengzhuo1203/+archive/ibus-gjs\nYou may try upstream version of ibus-gjs also but be warned that it is developed by a Fedora guy.\n", "Q: Remove only 1st page from a LOT of pdf files That's all I have to do: remove only 1st page from a LOT of pdf files...\nPlease tell me that magic exists.\n\nA: You can do this with a free program called pdftk, available here.\nYou can use the following commands to take every PDF in the current directory and copy them to the ‘trimmed’ directory with the first page removed:\nmkdir trimmed\nfor i in *pdf ; do pdftk \"$i\" cat 2-end output \"trimmed/$i\" ; done\n\n\nA: This looks like a job for PdfToolKit. This a command line utility to manipulate pdfs\nFirst, install PDFToolkil, either from the Software Centre or using the command line:\nsudo apt-get install pdftk\n\nNow the command to remove the first page from a normal (non-protected pdf) would be:\npdftk original.pdf cat 2-end output outputname.pdf\n\nIf the pdf is protected you will need to give the passwords to pdftk.\nTo convert a large number of pdf's you will need to write a small script that takes care of running pdftk for each one.\n\nA: You can use pdf-stapler for this task.\nExample:\nfor i in *.pdf; do pdf-stapler del \"$i\" 1 t.pdf && mv t.pdf \"$i\"; done\n\n\nA: I wrote this command line \ntree -fai . | grep -P \".pdf$\" | xargs -L1 -I {} pdftk {} cat 2-end output {}.truncated.pdf\n\nDoes the job, but of course if the file has more than one page, I tested it, it also works with as many levels of folders you have.

I'm running 11.10.\nHow can I change the settings so that a carriage return is added after Ctrl+C?\n\nA: Having igncr set in the stty settings would make your terminal ignore carriage returns (and pressing return would have no effect), although hitting Ctrl+C would still reload the prompt on a new line. To temporarily reset your tty, run\nstty sane\n\nand see below for how to put this command in a file so it is executed each time the terminal is loaded, even though the defaults should already be very similar.\nHowever, even though you mention carriage return, I think you simply mean that ^C isn't being inserted after you press Ctrl+C.\nThis happens when the -echoctl option of stty is set: see the full list of options at the Ubuntu manpage for stty. When a - is appended before an option, the opposite result occurs- i.e. ctrl is not echoed to the terminal. To see what non-standard options you have, just enter stty and see if -echoctl is listed:\nspeed 38400 baud; line = 0;\neol = M-^?; eol2 = M-^?; swtch = M-^?;\nixany iutf8\n-echoctl\n\nTo temporarily change the setting, so that ^C is echoed when you hit Ctrl+C you can run:\nstty echoctl\n\nHowever, to set it 'permanently', you can either place stty echoctl in your .bashrc or .bash_aliases or perhaps, as noted here, you can create a .stty file in your home folder and place the following in your bashrc:\nstty $(cat ~/.stty)\n\nAny other customisations can go in .stty as well, say, for example, if you wanted to reassign the stty shortcuts and have different ones from the default values.\n", "Q: Setting up email for drupal application for linode 12.04 I've installed ubuntu server 12.04 with linode. \nWhat do i need to install to allow my application to be able to send email in and out?

So that i can play audio files in internet explorer. If not, is it possible to change the player of Internet Explorer so that the audio files will get played in another player?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Windows Media Player can be installed using PlayOnLinux and (if I remember correctly) winetricks.\nHowever, with the first solution, you would need to add Internet Explorer to the Wine prefix that PlayOnLinux used for Windows Media Player and run it from there.\nEither way you do it, it may not work though, since both Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player work poorly at best in Wine. Furthermore, I don't think you can download Windows Media Player 9.x and previous versions any longer.\n\nAs for using another player in Internet Explorer, I've never actually tried that, but you could probably install DivX as your media player for Wine, since that does provide a browser plugin and will most likely automatically play your files.\n", "Q: How to install Remastersys?

Also, the freezing seems to be inconsistent\n\nA: I'm dealing with the same thing on an Acer Aspire One 722 - \nAccording to reports in various places, the random and irreversible freezes seem to be an issue with the networking/network card.

I was thinking that, if Ubuntu is based on Debian, and Debian has the GNU Hurd, why there's not an Ubuntu GNU/Hurd? Is there a possible way to install GNU/Hurd in Ubuntu? Thanks\n\nA: Seems like a good idea, but I don't think it would be widely used. For one, I'm pretty sure that programs compiled for Linux don't run under HURD. This would force people to change their system with a clean install. Not many people want to do so. This leaves new users. Most new users don't know much about this system, so why would they use the not-quite-ready HURD system over a Linux system that everyone here won't shut up about? The only way people would use this is if they can set up dual-boot and use their old programs without a clean install (it would have to be a quick sudo aptitude install hurd-kernel).\nI was reading about GNU HURD and its advanced structure, Debian is deploying DEBIAN GNU HURD and it would be very interesting to se how it works as a desktop system althou it is \"still\" (about 15 years) in developement and still not production ready (missing support for a lot of hardware - no sound support).\nmore info about HURD can be found on wikipedia or on http://www.gnu.org\n", "Q: Can't restore unity desktop I'm having this problem.\nTried this:\n$ unity --reset\n\nThis command hangs up on 'Setting Update \"run_key\"'\nAlso tried this:\n$ ccmd\n\nUnity plugin was disabled.

Is it normal for all processes to be sleeping?\nI've tried to include as much info as I could(limited on what I am allowed to post), if there is anything else I should check please let me know... I want to reinstall Ubuntu 12.04 any tips would be helpful.\n\nA: This behavior is normal. 7 \"users\" is not actually 7 users. It is just 7 console sessions that are not doing anything  but sitting at a console ready for commands if you switch using [Ctrl]+[Alt]+N. Also, the \"sleeping\" is normal, as most processes are inactive, but waiting for user interaction, or work delegated from another process. Most processes are sleeping in almost all Linux systems. Also, there are hidden users and groups that do very little except for delegating rights. Also, I am also seeing many network connections. DO not worry. Listening means that they are either ready for data or ready to send data, only a few actually acting. (The Dropbox client, for example, holds its connection LISTENING for the whole session, but it uses practically no bandwidth.)\n\nA: What you see is a perfectly healthy desktop.\nVirtual memory\nVirtual memory has nothing to do with real memory (aka RAM). It's an information that is useful for hackers /Linux developers. Basically on most OS, a process does not map its memory directly to physical memory, but to a virtual memory. If you have enough space, its all in your RAM, but in case you need more space the OS can put parts in the swap file, this is transparent (apart for the performance impact) to the application.\nHow the virtual memory size is computed is a bit complicated, and I even don't know exactly. But it's full of holes, so you should take this figures as maximum amounts \"mapped\" but this is not what the process is actually using physically.\nNumber of users\nAgain nothing to worry about. You have 6 ubuntu users connected to ttys. This are local connection. You can switch to them by using the key combinations: Ctrl+Alt+Fn with n a number from 1 to 7, 7 being your graphical session.\nNetstat\nStream socket are local Unix sockets. Many applications are using those and you should not worry about them. Try the command sudo netstat -tulpen it will give you more interesting results.\nAnd don't worry about \"listen\" state, it means that you have a service running. The above command will tell you which service is running on which port. As you are using a firewall, as long as the firewall has all ports closed, then a listening service cannot be reached.\nExample netstat output:\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       User       Inode       PID/Program name\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:53            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      0          13331       1597/dnsmasq    \ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      0          9494        535/sshd        \ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:631           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      0          9880        899/cupsd       \ntcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      0          9492        535/sshd        \ntcp6       0      0 ::1:631                 :::*                    LISTEN      0          9879        899/cupsd       \nudp        0      0 127.0.0.1:53            0.0.0.0:*                           0          13330       1597/dnsmasq    \nudp        0      0 0.0.0.0:68              0.0.0.0:*                           0          10498       1136/dhclient   \nudp        0      0 0.0.0.0:68              0.0.0.0:*                           0          10492       1115/dhclient   \nudp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5353            0.0.0.0:*                           106        9645        915/avahi-daemon: r\nudp        0      0 0.0.0.0:42730           0.0.0.0:*                           106        9647        915/avahi-daemon: r\nudp6       0      0 :::43066                :::*                                106        9648        915/avahi-daemon: r\nudp6       0      0 :::5353                 :::*                                106        9646        915/avahi-daemon: r\n\nProcesses state\nA process is most of the time idle, it is waiting interactions either from a user, a resource (a file for instance) or another process.

In order to do that, add intel_idle.max_cstate=1 entry to the kernel command line in /etc/default/grub.\nFor instance: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"biosdevname=0 crashkernel=auto nomodeset rd.auto=1 consoleblank=0 intel_idle.max_cstate=1\"\nThen please regenerated GRUB configuration: grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg\nYou will need to reboot your server to apply the new configuration.\n\nA: Was your system a assembled one or the ready-made CPU. The reason is the mother board chip-set is not matching the processor. Win7 will run fine as it is adaptable to the lower chip-set drivers to the next phase of processors and the mother board can also show no resistance to work in that case.\nUbuntu is Linux based as you know and is more secured because of the restriction that it should have the predefined set of chip-set drivers of the OEM recommendation for that security,which is mandatory for running. Try changing your mother board to the latest available chip-set that can suite to Intel i7. I had the same problem and tried many options. finally understood that from the AMD (mine is phenom II X2 555 black processor) that this processor requires a chip-set above AMD 760G while i was using 740G and win7 works for me very fine. now i changed new mother board to 760G chip set and every thing is fine and my performance also increased.

I don't know.\nThings I non-negotiably want this \"back end\" to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Be remote-controllable from a Python program. (As mentioned, I'm open to lots of methods of remote control; a socket, D-Bus, a CLI tool, whatever)\n\n*maintain a library of music - that is, scan my music for metadata and be able to address music by that metadata (so I can search for \"beatles\" and find tracks, not just those which match on the filename)\n\n*monitor a folder for changes and load those changes (new files, altered files, deleted files) into the library without having to be told to do so\n\n*let me provide my own GUI (hence the need for remote-controllability)\n\n\nThings I'd really, really, really like but which aren't strictly necessary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu sound menu integration\n\n*Be packaged for Ubuntu already and in Software Centre\n\n\nI've looked at a few alternatives and rejected them, but I might be wrong: if I'm wrong about any of these, do please correct me.\n\n\n*\n\n*cmus: cannot monitor the library for changes (needs to be prodded with update command). Also, AFAICT the remote control is primarily to make the curses interface do things; it's hard-to-impossible to use the remote control to say \"give me a list of all songs matching 'beatles'\"\n\n*mpd (and some client): cannot monitor the library for changes (needs to be prodded with \"update\" command)\n\n*moc: cannot monitor the library for changes\n\n*banshee (and banshee's back end, Nereid (?)): as far as I can tell, can't be controlled by a Python program: I'd need to write my new front end in C#\n\n*rhythmbox, guayadeque, audacious, quodlibet, clementine, noise, beatbox, deadbeef, gmusicbrowser, xnoise: can't turn the GUI off and replace it with my own\n\n\nSo, I'm looking either for explanations of how to do what I want with the above, or suggestions for alternative tools that I could use instead of those!\n\nA: XMMS2 \nThis command line player is a further development from XMMS. It comes with many features such as:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*play your music.  \n  \n*manage your music library  \n  \n*use collections to help you organise your music as you like  \n  \n*allow you to control it using a variety of clients.\nfrom the XMMS2 Wiki\n\nThere also is a lot of information on how to develop a client for XMMS2.\n\nAnother source of information on how things could be done in Python is the Exaile project.\n", "Q: Adding Liebert UPS (Uninterrupted power supply) psi Range I have an Liebert PowerSure PSI Line-Interactive UPS, 1000VA and using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nI've used it on windows and it came up as and Notebooks battery.

In Ubuntu, I move some file to a USB stick, using mv dir/file /media/7EXXX/swap/. When finishing this, I forget to \"safely remove\" before physically removing usb stick. Now, the file is not shown in usb. Is it possible to retrieve data not yet written to USB (which I assume resides on page/disk cache).\n\nA: The simple answer is \"No, sorry, but your data's gone\" :(\nShutdown as soon as possible (maybe even uncleanly) and use a LiveCD, etc. to mount your source partition and recover the file with testdisk/photorec, etc.\nRemember to append a ; sync next time so you know the file has been written to the USB when the prompt reappears.\n\nIn general it's almost impossible to retrieve data from the file cache unless you can somehow find what the \"page cache\" process is, and then there would be other issues.\nYou can examine and dump the contents of a process's memory from /proc/$pid/mem with a debugger such as gdb -- but the process must be able to be SIGSTOPped. So: the requirements to dump the file cache to a disk file for analysis and possible recovery with testdisk, photorec, etc. are something like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the elusive \"page cache\" process\n\n*Make sure it's stoppable\n\n*Dump its memory to disk\n\n*All without rebooting\n\n\nSomeone who has significant experience with kernel development could probably put together some code to do this...\n", "Q: How do I remove the \"did you mean...\" feature in the shell?

If you just want to disable this for a single user (eg, your own unprivileged account), you can simply do:\nunset command_not_found_handle\n\neither on the command line for the current shell, or in their .bashrc\nThe feature is typically enabled globally by defining command_not_found_handle in /etc/bash.bashrc, so could also be disabled there by default, while still leaving the package available for a power user to define the function and enable the feature in their own account.\n", "Q: How to check if your home folder and swap partition are encrypted using terminal?

The same issue happens if I login using Windows 7.\nDisk Utility detects with SMART that there are \"a few bad sectors\".\nSome of files are perfectly intact, but other files cannot be accessed (nor read, copied...) although they are displayed within nautilus and show the correct file size.\nIs there anything I can do to recover this data? I have thought of using TestDisk but this utility seems more useful for repairing lost partitions or deleted files.\nI have also thought of using ddrescue so I could at least have a low level copy of the disk but I am not sure what use to make of it in order to recover the data!!!\n\nA: Problem solved! I know this is not related to Ubuntu but I think this could be useful for other people.\nI have found out that Window's chkdsk could solve the problem, this is because Ubuntu doesn't support NTFS as well as Windows does. It has taken several hours/days to run the tasks (just Windows scandisk with all options activated) but in the end I have managed to recover 99.98% of the data.\n\nA: Instead using dd you should use a tool which handles errors better instead of filling them with zeros. I ran into many timeouts which makes the process really long and tedious. The alternative is ddrescue which retries failed sectors and also is a little bit faster in skipping bad sectors from my experience.\nInstall (ubuntu)\nsudo apt-get install gddrescue\n\nCreate the image\n sudo ddrescue -d -r3 /dev/sda1 test.img test.logfile\n\nThis will create an image in the current dir named test.img of the disk /dev/sda1. You can of course backup the full drive instead of a single partition. (The r parameter tells it to retry failed sectors three times - don't forget the logfile, otherwise this will not work) ddrescue also allows you to abort/resume the process which is really nice. Remember to set right blocksize: -b \"blocksize\" if you get errors on -d \"direct mode\"\nMounting the image file\nCreate a folder where you want to mount the image and mount the image\nsudo mkdir /mnt/mybackup\nmount test.img /mnt/mybackup -o loop\n\nCheck out the following for more information:\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/manual/ddrescue_manual.html\nhttps://www.technibble.com/guide-using-ddrescue-recover-data/\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/39504/best-way-to-copy-all-files-ignoring-errors\n\nA: If a drive has unreadable sectors one of the choices you have is to make an image of it with dd forcing it to ignore the damaged sectors and then mount that image to read the useful data.\nCreate a image of the drive\nUse the command sudo fdisk -l to identify your USB disk, note his device path, it should look something like /dev/sd[*], where [*] is a letter representing your USB drive.\nWhen you are sure about the path to the drive you want to copy you can use dd to make a image of it and use the options to keep on reading after failing to read data\ndd if=/dev/hd[*] of=/foo_path/foo_image conv=noerror,sync\n\nThis will read the device /dev/sd[*], output it to /foo_path/foo_image and ignore read errors. /foo_path/foo_image should not be on the same disk you are reading.\nSo, lets say you used sudo fdisk -l and you found that your USB drive is /dev/sdb, you can then use any of those commands to make an image just by replacing /dev/hd[*] with /dev/sdb.\nMouting the image file to read the data\nYou need to create a mount point, lets call it /mnt/ddimage\nsudo mkdir /mnt/ddimage\n\nNow mount the image you just created to it\nmount /foo_path/foo_image /mnt/ddimage -o loop\n\nYou should now be able to read any useful data from the cloned drive image.\n", "Q: How can I download the source code for linux-image-3.2.0-*-generic?

How does one connect an MTP device to Ubuntu via USB? Many popular devices, such as all Android 4.0 phone, have only MTP or PTP as a connection option, no USB mass storage anymore.\nConsidering the popular Samsung S3: connecting as either MTP or PTP: neither allows one to see pictures saved as default by phone camera to DCIM folder on external SD card. Similar problems with previous models (with Android 2.x) were solvable by 'usb utilities' in wireless & networking settings, but this is no longer present in Android 4.0.\n\nA: I have been able to do this using the following:\n\n$ sudo apt-get install mtp-tools mtpfs\n$ mkdir phone\n...Connect phone, set usb mode to MTP...\n$ sudo mtpfs -o allow_other phone\n...Trying to do anything with the new filesystem right now will take a minute or so, just be patient...\n...Finally, you can access your phone and do whatever, then...\n$ sudo umount phone\n\nHere is the version this worked on:\n\n$ mtpfs --version\nFUSE library version: 2.8.6\nfusermount version: 2.8.6\nusing FUSE kernel interface version 7.12\n\nI haven't had perfect success with it, but I was able to get some files off of the phone.

You can set it to Charge Only, HTC Sync, Disk Drive, Mobile Broadband Connect.\nThen Ubuntu will simply detect it as a MTP.\n\nA: If you can't transfer songs through Rhythmbox you can, like others have pointed out, transfer files using mass storage.\nOn my Samsung Galaxy S II you do it by going:\nApplications->Settings->Connection settings->USB mass storage\nThen if you plug in the USB cable it should prompt you to go to USB mass storage mode. If you say yes your phone will be available through Nautilus.  \n\nA: The git master branch of libmtp supports the S3. If you know how to install / compile from source, you can use this until a new version is released.\nI'm not on an Ubuntu machine right now, so I unfortunately can't give exact instructions regarding dependencies for compiling, etc. But it should be along the following lines:\ngit clone git://libmtp.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/libmtp/libmtp\ncd libmtp\n\nsudo apt-get install libtool libusb-dev checkinstall\n\n./autogen.sh  (answering yes to any questions)\n./configure --prefix=/usr/\nmake\nsudo checkinstall  (answering any questions)\n\nThen, you should probably make it into a .deb package, so you can install it without breaking dependencies of the programs you want to use.

Do you advise Ubuntu 11.10 or 12.04 ?\n\nA: This may answer part of the question… or not at all:\nI have MATLAB2011b and Octave 3.2 on Ubuntu 12.04 (64 bits), working well.\n\nA: Matlab is commercial software. As such, the vendors should have the authoritative idea on what operating system is best for it. You are paying vast amounts of money for it, so get some value for that money and contact them. They might not have tested it on the latest Ubuntu, or maybe they don't even support Ubuntu and you'll have to switch to Redhat Enterprise. Who knows? They do, and you've given them money. Lots of money.\nDon't just rely on stuff you read on the internet for commercial software. Get the support from the vendor.\n", "Q: Possible to migrate from non-RAID to RAID 1 and then RAID 5? Using software RAID only\nIs it possible to start with a 2TB disk full of data and safely add it to a RAID 1 array?\nIs it then possible to add a third disk and migrate the RAID 1 array into a RAID 5 array?\nOR\nIs it possible to start with a 2 disk degraded RAID 5 array and then add the third disk later to create a health RAID 5 array?\nBackstory:\nI wish to migrate from a 2 disk NAS (RAID 1) to a 3 disk NAS and only purchase one new disk in doing so\n\nA: You can convert a RAID 1 array into a RAID 5 array if you overwrite the RAID 1 metadata with RAID 5 metadata with mdadm.  However, I have never done it nor would I try it without backing up all of my data. If I had a back up of all my data I would just wipe the disks, setup the RAID 5 and restore from back up instead of trying to convert a RAID 1 array into a RAID 5 array.\nThat said, I found an article that is kind of old but has the basic idea:\nhttp://www.davelachapelle.ca/2008/07/25/converting-raid-1-to-raid-5/\nUse at your own risk.\n\nA: I have successfully done this in the past.  It's been a few years, but one of things I love about mdadm is how versatile it is.  No hardware raid I ran across would let me do something like this without doing a clean wipe + restore.\n", "Q: sound problem, spikes, help please I have problem with sound.

The good news: this totally worked to give me screen size options for some games in Ubuntu. \nThe bad news: I didn't take into account the menu bar at the top of the screen, and the resized game doesn't allow me to move the screen up high enough to access the \"OK\" button at the bottom of the screen that would let me change the screen to an even more appropriate size. So now I have a game that runs in a screen about 10% larger than the actual screen, and no way of actually clicking \"OK\" to confirm a smaller screen size. There doesn't seem to be any way to tab to the OK button, or to click it \"below-screen\" -- the mouse stops at the screen bottom. \nIs there a way to force a program or game to start at a certain resolution? \n\nA: While you can't drag up any higher with the title bar, have you tried holding Alt while dragging the window itself with the first mouse button? Some games and applications (VirtualBox in particular) will break this, but in general it should work.\nIf that doesn't work to allow you to drag the window higher so you can click OK, you \nwill most likely have to use a command line option to the game, if it has one, or edit its configuration externally, if it stores that in a game.ini or similar somewhere. While it is possible to generically force most applications to a certain size with some tools such as devilspie, this doesn't generally work on games and such that may need to reload assets on resolution changes, or which require preserving an aspect ratio. Games do tend to have a config file, or a command line option, to specify the resolution to use, though.\n", "Q: Headless OpenVPN server with inadyn The goal:  bypassing the Great Firewall of China while I am there on a contract.\nThe concept:  a micro-minimal install of Ubuntu on a headless machine left behind in the States which boots and runs from a CD or DVD with only three tasks: login, run inadyn to update the external DNS via DynDNS and launch OpenVPN as a server.\nUbuntu, iandyn and OpenDNS because I am familiar with them, I have this working with a full install.

I was running dual boot system (win 7 / linux) and at some point I decided to test fedora ( I am new in Linux ). \nMy hard disk conf: 3 hard disks each 1 TB, 2 set to raid 0 with windows running on it and 1 for linux.

Or the whole disk instead of a\npartition (e.g. /dev/sda, not /dev/sda1)? Or the other way around?\n\n\nA: You need to (re)install GRUB to the RAID device instead of the block device. This is documented in the Ubuntu Documentation though the documentation is a little old and can be confusing. The errors you encounters are correct because the filesystem is installed on the RAID device not the block device[*].\nRAID (actually FakeRAID) devices are named /dev/mapper/[something] instead of /dev/sd[X]. First you will need to find the RAID device for your windows partition with ls /dev/mapper/. This will list all of the active devices.  Since you presumably only have one, it should be easy to find. If the device is not listed, the dmraid man page will explain how to activate your RAID device.  This is usually done with sudo dmraid -ay as root.\nOnce you know the device name, you can (re)install GRUB with sudo grub-install /dev/mapper/[something]. GRUB setup should detect Windows, and Ubuntu. Reboot to test.\n[*]This is not technically correct as the underlying filesystem is actually installed on the block device. In modern versions of Ubuntu is is masked by the raid device to mimic the way the device is mounted in windows.  If this were RAID 1 instead of RAID 0 you could disable RAID in the BIOS and you would see two drives with identical filesystems on them. Since this is RAID 0 the filesystem is split between the two.\n", "Q: Monitor shows 'no signal' after Nvidia driver installation (ubuntu 12.04 amd64) I use Ubuntu 12.04 amd64\nThe last thing I see before this message is ubuntu boot splash screen.\nThe hardware configuration is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gigabyte 970a-ud3 motherboard\n\n*AMD Phenom II X4 975 processor\n\n*8 GB RAM\n\n*NVIDIA Corporation GT200 [GeForce GTX 260]\n\n\nI've tried to remove xorg.conf, but nothing have changed.

I just did the install on my XPS 13 and it looks like it was working pretty well. The touch-pad isn't working too good though and it tends to overheat. Still working out the kinks on those items.\n\nA: Dell XPS should work great as it is the part of sputnik project.

You may need to choose to boot from usb during your computer booting or from BIOS.\nAlso go for manual partition and I recommend creating a /, /home and swap partition. You can create swap as much as your RAM.\nAs far as recovery is concerned, you should keep the partition where your Windows image reside and you need to install windows wiping ubuntu if you are dissatisfied AFAIK.\nWhat are PPAs and how do I use them?\n\nA: I've just done an install for dual-boot from a Pen drive on a Dell XPS 13.\n1) \nFor creating the USB drive, I followed these instructions and they worked perfectly: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nFor booting the USB stick from windows 8: Hold the shift key while clicking \"restart\".

Everytime it starts up it says that vmware needs ~/.vmware to save preferences and that it is unable to create ~/.vmware.\nBut ~/.vmware is already a directory. How do I get this resolved?\n\nA: You should never run as root unless you are explicitly trying to modify your system.  VMWare Workstation does not need root access to simply run a guest machine.  Likely your permission were changed to root owning your ~/.vmware folder during install.  You just need to change the ownership back to your user.\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/.vmware\n\nThis will set the owner back to you and your group.\n\nA: I had the same problem with VMWare Player 6.0 in Ubuntu 13.10\nI solved it by using:\nchown -R $USER:$USER ~/.vmware\n\n\nA: Try running as root, it always helps get things done.\n", "Q: Max ram for computer 16GB or 8GB Manufacturer's specifications for my notebook say memory can be extended from 4GB to 8GB. \nWhereas, running sudo dmidecode suggests the computer can use 16GB as below:\nHandle 0x0037, DMI type 16, 15 bytes\nPhysical Memory Array\nLocation: System Board Or Motherboard\nUse: System Memory\nError Correction Type: None\nMaximum Capacity: 16 GB\nError Information Handle: Not Provided\nNumber Of Devices: 4\n\nWhich one is correct? \n\nA: As I mentioned in the comment, to answer this, the full name of the motherboard is needed. I give an example. I have the Intel DZ68DB as seen here: http://ark.intel.com/products/55744/Intel-Desktop-Board-DZ68DB\nThe motherboard supports up to 32GB of RAM (Right now I am using 16GB). This in a small way depends also on the memory type but for this motherboard, the DDR3 I am using can go up to 32GB of RAM (8GB of RAM per slot).\nWhen I run sudo dmidecode -t memory I get the following:\ncyrex@cyrex:~$ sudo dmidecode -t memory\n# dmidecode 2.11\nSMBIOS 2.6 present.\n\nHandle 0x0027, DMI type 16, 15 bytes\nPhysical Memory Array\n    Location: System Board Or Motherboard\n    Use: System Memory\n    Error Correction Type: None\n    Maximum Capacity: 16 GB\n    Error Information Handle: No Error\n    Number Of Devices: 4\n\nas you can see it says 16 GB but I actually know is not that. It is 32 GB. I should mention I already updated the BIOS to the latest version and tested for 2 whole days the system with 32 GB of RAM (Which also answered a doubt I had about performance and speed between a 16 GB and a 32 GB system.) so I know it works with 32 GB as well.\nSo as you can see, dmidecode will be wrong in some hardware until an update to dmidecode or the way it parses the information gathered is corrected. This also includes tools like lshw which will show the same information. This is not the case with every hardware but you just happened to have the same bug as me. I am guessing in a newer version of the program (2.11 as of now) they will correct this.\nI will point you to the Linux Man Page about dmidecode: http://linux.die.net/man/8/dmidecode\nThere you will find in the Bug section this:\n\nMore often than not, information contained in the DMI tables is\n  inaccurate, incomplete or simply wrong.\n\nSo dmidecode helps but is not 100% accurate.

Now, when I try to run this CD it shows the following error mssage:\n Device driver not found: 'MSCD001'.\n\n No valid CDROM device drivers were selected\n\n Mouse driver was previously installed\n\n A:\\> \n\nIf the drive wasn't working the CD wouldn't even start, I assume....So can anyone help me please!\nThank you!\n\nA: It looks like the CD you burned contains DOS rather than Ubuntu (or perhaps contains both). One possible cause of this is if you told your CD burning software to do something special to make the CD bootable. Ubuntu .iso images are already bootable, so you don't need to do anything like that.\nI recommend making a new CD using one of the officially recommended techniques described here. The problem here appears to be in the way you have used your CD burning software (or a bug in the software), and it would be difficult for us to give you advice about how specifically to correct that unless someone here happens to be experienced with the utility you used.\nAlternatively, you might consider booting Ubuntu from a USB flash drive rather than a CD.\nIf you continue to have trouble, you should make sure to MD5 test the Ubuntu .iso image you downloaded.\nThis answer assumes you are booting from the CD correctly. The term \"try to run this CD\" is a bit confusing, though, so if my answer doesn't help, can you clarify what exactly you are doing with the CD after you burn it?\n", "Q: Why does upgrading to 12.04 on an OpenVZ VPS warn that the kernel size is 0? When I tried to upgrade my server to ubuntu 12.04, it gave this message, but the upgrade process will continue :\n WARNING:root:estimate_kernel_size_in_boot() returned '0'?\n\nThis is a VPS server on openvz. I just upgraded from 11.04 to 11.10 without any problems. But what to do now?\n\nA: \nBut what to do now?\n\nContinue. The warning is expected, since OpenVZ VPSs do not have their own kernels -- they operate on the physical host's kernel. OpenVZ is more like an enhanced chroot rather than a true virtual machine in that respect.\nImportant - if your running kernel is less than 2.6.24\nPlease check your current kernel version with uname -r. If it is less than 2.6.24, the upgrade will fail half-way with a glibc error. That happens because the glibc included by default with 12.04 requires a minimum 2.6.24 kernel -- glibc are the critical C libraries used by every application.\nAt that point, you will need the instructions [from this answer], as pasted below:\n\nI've set up a PPA containing a recompiled libc which is compiled to work on 2.6.18 or newer (please check uname -r!), and it should override the current libc provided by Precise. Just add ppa:izx/ovz-libc, update, and it should let you get past this. Specifically, something like this:\napt-add-repository ppa:izx/ovz-libc\napt-get update\napt-get -f install\ndo-release-upgrade\n\nand continue on until the upgrade completes successfully. I highly recommend NOT replacing any changed or non-existent config files.\nI will be keeping the ppa updated as and when libc is updated upstream. The PPA package includes a pin so that it will only be updated when the new fixed libc is available on the PPA, not when it first appears in the official repositories.\n", "Q: My hardware MAC address is always 00:00:00:00:00:00 until I manually update 'eth0'.

LibreOffice Writer is a text processor and it saves its files with some additional markup which C compiler does not understand.\nTo run gedit, press the Super (Win logo) key and type \"gedit\".\nApart from saving the program in plain text format, you will also need to install the C compiler and stuff, which you can do with\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\n(although I think you already managed to install it)\nBtw, I can confirm that the program compiles nicely and even runs after that :)\n\nA: C source code fila is a  ASCII text file with c extension. In Libre office I have saved fila as txt. Editor adds txt extension so \nI have changed it to c, then I can compile file with no errors using gcc \n\nA: You've discovered the basic computing concept that the file name and extension actually has no bearing whatsoever on the file contents, or the type of information encoded in the file. You can rename cats.png as cats.doc all you want, but that does NOT make it a Word document containing an informational report on feline companions. It will still be an image file in the PNG format, it's just named incorrectly to look like a Word document. Your OS will probably be confused if you double-click on it, but the contents of the file are unchanged and the word processor app that launches when you double-click will probably give you an error dialog.\nYou did exactly the same thing. You took a Libre Office document file, which is basically a Word document (actually Word can open it as well, these days) with all the formatting information, table of contents, and whatever else may be included, and then renamed it to \".c\", leaving all that information intact. The compiler expects plain textual data, with none of that other information.\nFile extensions are a useful convention to give the user hints as to what might be inside, and also to give the OS hints as to which program to use to view the file content. But they mean nothing more. That's why you needed to actually create a plain-text document, using a plain-text editor, rather than use a Word Processor and rename the file to lie to your OS.\n", "Q: Packard Bell Easynote TS1HR-120IT Notebook, is it compatible with Ubuntu?

My envvar files has these lines in it: \nexport APACHE_RUN_USER=www-data\nexport APACHE_RUN_GROUP=www-data\n\nMy apache2.conf has these lines in it:\n# These need to be set in /etc/apache2/envvars\nUser ${APACHE_RUN_USER}\nGroup ${APACHE_RUN_GROUP}\n\nBut when I run apache2 -M I get this:\napache2: bad user name ${APACHE_RUN_USER}\n\nA temporary fix is to hard-code www-data into it my apache2.conf file. There was some speculation here that this was because some configuration script didn't replace the env vars correctly in my apache2.conf file. Regardless how do I get apache2 to consult my envvars file?\nAs another data point this site seems to indicate the envvars is generated at build, but read by apache2ctl at runtime, suggesting that this file isn't just poop leftover by the build process.\n\nA: From http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/configuring.html:\n\nThe values of shell environment variables can be used in configuration file lines using the syntax ${ENVVAR}. If \"ENVVAR\" is the name of a valid environment variable, the value of that variable is substituted into that spot in the configuration file line, and processing continues as if that text were found directly in the configuration file. (If the ENVVAR variable is not found, the characters \"${ENVVAR}\" are left unchanged for use by later stages in the config file processing.)\n\nSo, the variable is indeed retrieved from the environment as expected. Now where does this happen?\nIn /etc/init.d/apache2, APACHE_ENVVARS is set to the path of the envvars file which is based on the initscript path. It usually results in APACHE_ENVVARS=/etc/apache2/envvars being set. Now, since this value equals to the default values as set in apache2ctl, it is not exported.\nFrom /usr/sbin/apache2ctl:\n# the path to the environment variable file\ntest -z \"$APACHE_ENVVARS\" && APACHE_ENVVARS=\"$APACHE_CONFDIR/envvars\"\n# pick up any necessary environment variables\nif test -f $APACHE_ENVVARS; then\n  . $APACHE_ENVVARS\nfi\n\nExplanation: if APACHE_ENVVARS is empty, use the default path which is /etc/apache2/envvars. If this file exists, \"source\" it (execute the commands from that file in the current environment).\nBe sure that the envvars file does not contain any syntax errors. To perform such a check, use:\nsh -n /etc/apache2/envvars && echo Syntax OK || echo FAIL\n\nErrors are printed if any.\n\nA: After looking over the answer given by @Lekensteyn, I tried sudo apache2ctl -M with my apache2.conf reverted to the original. This worked so I dug into the man pages a bit. Here's what man apache2 had to say:\nIn  general, apache2 should not be invoked directly, but rather should \nbe invoked via /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl. The default Debian \nconfiguration requires environment variables that are defined in \n/etc/apache2/envvars  and  are  not  available  if  apache2  is  \nstarted  directly. However, apache2ctl can be used to pass arbitrary \narguments to apache2.\n\nSo, the answer to this question is: You're not using apache2 correctly; use apache2ctl instead.\nThanks @Lekensteyn for pointing me in the right direction.\n", "Q: How to start a task before networking? I've written an upstart task that modifies /etc/network/interfaces. (Actually a file sourced into it.) Which start on condition do I need to declare to let my task run before any networking jobs?\nI've tried start on starting networking, but that's apparently too late. When I log in after booting I can see that the changes were written, but obviously they are not used: the new config states a static IP, but the boot process waits for a non-existing DHCP server (old config) to time out.\nI've also tried start on starting network-interface INTERFACE=eth0, which didn't work either. IIRC there was an error in the log that the change couldn't be written.\nBackground: I need a VM template that can be cloned and the clones configured through a script. Among other settings, I need to give them a static IP address to access them from the host. I use guestfish to write a config file to one of the virtual disks and let a script apply these settings to the system. I don't want that disk to contain an actual system settings file. I can't modify /etc directly, because that disk is shared (copy-on-write/diff) among the clones and guestfish apparently doesn't support that type of image. I could also let them use DHCP and setup a server that assigns IP by MAC, but I'm afraid of the complexity. I could also add just another virtual disk for configuration files, but if possible I'd prefer to store settings directly on the system disk image.\nUsed software: Ubuntu Server 12.04, VirtualBox. The configuration modifier is a self written ruby script.\n\nA: Found a workaround for myself.\nI removed any configuration for eth0 from the VM template. Thus it is not brought up automatically. My config job now starts on starting networking, modifies the config file and explicitly calls ifup eth0.\nWhile this solves my problem, this doesn't fit the general case of how to start a service/task in upstart before networking. Thus I'm going to leave the question open.\n\nA: start on starting network-interface\ninstance $INTERFACE\ntask\nexec mything\n\nand\nstart on starting networking\ntask\nexec mything\n\nifup is run by one of two methods, either by the network-interface job or by the networking job, which is used to configure any interfaces not covered by udev.\nThe instance stanza above makes sure that your job is started for each of the two cases, because the way upstart works, one or condition will not block the other.\n(that is this bug btw: https://bugs.launchpad.net/upstart/+bug/568860)\nIf your job cannot run concurrently or twice, you will need to split it into three jobs. One called 'mything-waiter':\nstart on starting network-interface\ninstance $INTERFACE\ntask\nexec start wait-for-state WAITER=mything-waiter-$UPSTART_JOB-$INTERFACE WAIT_FOR=mything\n\nAnd another with a similar exec line for starting networking:\nstart on starting networking\ntask\nexec start wait-for-state WAITER=mything-waiter-networking WAIT_FOR=mything\n\nAnd the other called 'mything' which is just\ntask\nexec mything\n\nI think an argument can be made to have 'start on starting networking' do all of this, but that will require some redesign of the networking bring-up in Ubuntu.\n\nA: Could you simply start your job at start on startup? Is there any reason to tie it to the start of the networks, if you just need the configuration be changed before networking starts.\nEdit: ok, that didn't work.\nI'm not able to mess up with my init system right now, so I gotta give some advise untested:\nFirst option: add task stanza to your job. It should make Upstart wait until it exits before launching pending networking/network-interface job. I'm fairly sure this isn't fixing the timing issue as there has been plenty of questions in AskUbuntu how to inject stuff into normal boot process.\nSecond option: use override files. I think network-interface.conf is the one you need to spoof. Sadly it uses pre-start section already, so instead of just making one up we need to copy it (and only it) to our network-interface.override file.\nOnce you've copied pre-start section, just modify the content to suit your needs. Original file stays as is, but pre-start section from your override literally overrides the one in the original job.\nHope either helps.\n", "Q: is it good or bad to upgrade kernel for ubuntu? \nPossible Duplicate:\nReasons why not to update an Ubuntu version to a newer/older kernel version \n\nI use Ubuntu 11.10. which has kernel 3.2.\nNow kernel 3.4.1 is available, is it good or bad to upgrade kernel?\nif it's bad, what are the consequences?\n\nA: In my personal view,updating your kernel to the latest version from an older version may not be appropriate,as the newer version of the operating system may contain the newest version of the kernel itself.\nUpdating your kernel will expose new functions which may have changed and as a result,not integrate correct with your operating system.\n\nA: \nGenerally, upgrading from one minor kernel release to the next won't\n  bring any major differences. There are several reasons to upgrade the\n  kernel. One is to take advantage of a specific new feature or driver;\n  another is to be protected against a security vulnerability, or just\n  to maintain an up-to-date and healthy system.\nEven if you choose not to update to every new kernel revision, it is\n  recommended that you at least upgrade from time to time.

To remove a single line, there's a context menu entry.\nThere are two possible approaches to remove multiple lines without much hassle:\n\n\n*\n\n*as proposed in this answer: sort the lines alphabetically so the empty lines get sorted to the start or end, then delete them.\n\n*as proposed in this blog post: use filtering to get only the blank lines displayed, then select and delete them, then remove the filter.\nEDIT:\nTo remove hard line breaks inside cells automatically, you could use the search / replace functionality and regular expressions. Just search for \\n and let the replace box empty. Don't forget to activate \"Regular expressions\" under More Options.... You won't see a result immediately, since Calc doesn't change the row height automatically. So you will have to set the row height using Optimal row height... in the context menu after removing the line breaks.\n\nEDIT 2:\nIt may be possible that there aren't any empty lines in the cells, so the search/replace operation may fail.

I need to delete those recup_dir folders, but also I need to finish recovering and get through the error.\n\nA: I'm not familiar with the Photorec thing, but have you tried to make system repairs by means of the Recovery GRUB menu...? If you don't see the GRUB menu, try hitting Esc while your PC is booting in order to display it...\n\nA: If you use Nvidia:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\n\nIf this doesn't work try to change your download server in order to re-download all updates (Administration -> Update Manager -> Ubuntu Software -> Download from)\nIf you use Tor repository disable it (I don't know if this have to do with the problem but I did before solving it).\nIf you don't use Nvidia edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf as root instead of typing \"sudo nvidia-xconfig\".\n", "Q: how to connect to two wireless network I have two hotspot/wireless network at my home,\nand I have 2 wireless adapter in my laptop,\ncan I connect to 2 wireless network and use both to connect to internet for increasing internet access speed?\nbig thanks..\nXgaptek.tk\n\nA: Yes, you can but you need to have two different IP schemes like 192.168.0.xxx and 192.168.1.xxx.  Once you do that, you need to have both connections bridged.\n", "Q: find everything besides directories How can I use find command to find every type of the file (not just -type f but also specials such as sockets, device files etc.) but ommiting dirs?\n\nA: Use negation.\nfind . ! -type d -print\n\nAlso see http://mywiki.wooledge.org/UsingFind\n\nA: You can have o look at find manual, but I doubt it is the proper way to find sockets and/or device files...

Once you've finished, you can the mount the filesystem with mount -o loop.\nFor more information, you can read this: http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~peterb/linux/raidextract/\nHope this helps.\n\nA: How to add the 4th disk back to the raid? \"From Mike's Question in previous comment\"\nEdit this for your needs:\nmdadm --add /dev/md1 /dev/sdf1\nmdadm --grow /dev/md1 --raid-devices=4\n\nThis then took several hours to reshape the array.\nThe filesystem the needs to be expanded to fill up the new space.\nfsck.ext3 /dev/md1\nresize2fs /dev/md1\n\n\nA: If the only thing you did was blow away the partition table with parted, then all you have to do to fix it is to recreate the partition table exactly as it was before.  Put parted into sector mode with the unit s command, and you can probably look at the other disks in the array to guess how this one was partitioned.\n", "Q: Ubuntu installation disk with updates included I would like to install Ubuntu on a computer but I don't want, right after the installation, to go through the process of installing the updates which came out since the release of the latest Ubuntu version.\nI know there is an option to install the updates during the installation, but I can't use that because the computer I want to install Ubuntu onto doesn't have direct access to Internet. I would like the latest updates to be included in the installation disk.\nWhere can I find an Ubuntu installation disk with updates included?\n\nA: To my knowledge you would need to wait for point release - one is due in August which will have updates included.\nI've successfuly copied the cache from one machine to another, there are other ways of dealing with it though.\nHow to backup programs without using apt cache?\n\nA: Since the updates are released frequently by canonical/ubuntu, Instead of searching for the distro with updates included, you should prefer getting them on the official releases.  So as an alternative, I can suggest you one thing: (How to get updates for machines not connected to internet)\n\n\n*\n\n*(You need internet for this step) First time check for updates using update manager. It would download something like 20 MBs. \nYou can do this by running this: \nsudo apt-get update\n\n*Now run the following command. \nsudo apt-get --print-uris --yes upgrade | grep ^\\' | cut -d\\' -f2 > ~/updatesjune05 \nIt will create a file called updatesjune05 in your home directory with the links to download from.\n\n*Now carry this file with you to a machine with internet connection( with an OS- windows linux whatever).\n\n*Use another software to download the files listed there. \nOn windows: You can use a third party software say orbitdownloader (a freeware) and tell it to import the list from the file you created earlier. \nOn linux: you can use wget -i /patheto/thefileyoucreated. \n\n*After the files are downloaded, carry them to the first machine with no internet. Run the following command.\nsudo cp -r /pathwhereyourdownloadedfilesare/* /var/cache/apt/archives/\n\n*Run sudo apt-get upgrade \nThe updates should install without any trouble. \n\n", "Q: How to remove duplicate entries in Grub menu? After today's update, Ubuntu asked me to replace some files and I blindly accepted. After I restarted PC after the update, I saw duplicate entries in the grub menu:\n\nHere's the image of the grub customizer.\n\nApparently, Grub Customizer can not save edited information.\nIs there a way to remove duplicates from Ubuntu 12.04 grub menu and set Windows 7 on first position?\n\nA: For permanent fix:\nsudo mv /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober /etc/grub.d/07_os-prober\n\nand Windows will be on top even after updates\n\nA: While a sudo update-grub2 should remove the duplicate enties, to bring the Windows menu-item at first position additionally do :\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo gedit /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\n*Cut the portion of text starting from\n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober ###\nmenuentry \"Windows 7...to}\n### END /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober ###  and pest it just beforemenuentry 'Ubuntu, with Linux..\n\n*save the file and reboot.\n\n*You have to perform steps(1-4) every time grub-pc package-update or a kernel-update happens to keep Windows menu-item at first place.\n\nA: i think you've already been helped. But just in case a newbie needs an easy way to change the order of the grub menu and even delete (careful here!!) entries, there is a nice GUI way in linux to do so, with the grub-customizer.\nGo to the terminal and type:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppstrong texta:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\n\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nThen look up the newly installed grub customizer, start it and you can move windows or ubuntu upwards / downwards in the list.\n\nA: You can also remove old unused kernel packages and this effectively removes also the grub entries and frees harddrive space. To do that you need to check what kernels are installed using:\n sudo dpkg -l | grep linux-image\n\nAnd then you can remove the kernel image using:\n sudo apt-get remove linux-image-version_number\n\nwhere version_number is the kernel version you want to remove. I recommend you leave at least two kernel versions available just in case something goes wrong.\n\nA: I have just went from an upgrade from 11.04 to 12.04 LTS. \nWhile I cannot find an \"expected\" listing of /etc/grub.d/ for different OS versions anywhere, from another computer I have access to, the original 11.04 entries are:\n$ ls /etc/grub.d/\n00_header        10_linux      20_memtest86+  40_custom  README\n05_debian_theme  20_linux_xen  30_os-prober   41_custom\n\nOn the updated PC, after the update, I have:\n$ ls /etc/grub.d/\n00_header        10_os-prober  30_memtest86+     40_custom\n05_debian_theme  20_linux      30_os-prober      41_custom\n10_linux         20_linux_xen  30_uefi-firmware  README\n\nObviously, I've gotten some entries there which are duplicates - so not even running sudo update-grub2 as @Samik suggest does not remove duplicate entries in this case. \nThe answer for this case would obviously be to remove the duplicate _os-prober and _linux entries, and then running sudo update-grub2.\n", "Q: LIMBO fails on startup with Internal errors - invalid parameters received I installed LIMBO from the Humble Bundle V and as far as I am aware, this has wine packaged with it (I also installed the latest from the repo's in case is was because of that).\nHowever the game doesn't even start and fails with the message:\nWine Program Error\nInternal errors - invalid parameters received.\nIs there a way to log the error or does anyone know why this happens?\nThis question was asked previously but it seems to have disappeared.\nMy Graphics cards is a Geforce GT 250\nWine outputs the following error:\nwine /opt/limbo/support/limbo/drive_c/Program\\ Files/limbo/limbo.exe\nfixme:system:SystemParametersInfoW Unimplemented action: 59 (SPI_SETSTICKYKEYS)\nfixme:system:SystemParametersInfoW Unimplemented action: 53 (SPI_SETTOGGLEKEYS)\nfixme:system:SystemParametersInfoW Unimplemented action: 51 (SPI_SETFILTERKEYS)\nfixme:win:EnumDisplayDevicesW ((null),0,0x32f580,0x00000000), stub!\nerr:x11settings:X11DRV_ChangeDisplaySettingsEx No matching mode found 1920x1080x32 @60!

1920x1080 resolution while the game tries to set it to 60Hz).\n\n\n*\n\n*You can try to edit the file /opt/limbo/support/limbo/drive_c/Program\\ Files/limbo/settings.txt and change the parameter backbufferheight = 1080 to adjust it to current display size. \n\n*If that does not work, try launching the game in windowed mode by changing the parameter as windowedmode = true and possibly decreasing the backbufferheight = 720 or like.\n\n\nA: I had the same problem with my dual monitor setup. One workaround that was successful for me was to completely disable the secondary monitor (for instance using the nvidia-settings dialog). This may help you until a real fix is provided by CodeWeaver.\n\nA: Per Jeffrey Rosen (Humble Bundle co-founder) via omgubuntu:\n\nThe LIMBO Linux build was created by CodeWeavers who basically take a\n  custom version of Wine and tune the game to make sure it runs\n  flawlessly.\nThis is our first experiment with CodeWeavers and we are watching\n  carefully.\nIf there are any bugs with the game, I don’t want people to think “oh\n  well, it uses Wine” – these ought to be sent to CodeWeavers who should\n  do their best to fix them.\n\nSo, if someone here can help, that's great, but if you can figure out how, giving the details to Codeweavers might be the most helpful.  \nUnfortunately, it's not easy to submit bugs.\nLIMBO is here:   http://www.codeweavers.com/compatibility/browse/name/?app_id=9528 .\nIt redirects you to the support page.\nIt expects you to have bought the actual crossover product, for the most part.  I encourage people to poke around there if you've got time -- we might be able to bug them sufficiently to get a better communication channel open if nothing else. \nI did find a related report in the codeweavers forums . \n\nA: Okay, I've found a \"workaround\" of sorts. It involves disabling pulseaudio and loading alsa instead. To do that I followed this article. I then uninstalled Limbo and reinstalled the earlier version. Voila! Game works. Sound works.\n", "Q: Why is a VYM (View Your Mind) file considered an archive? I use the program VYM (View Your Mind) to draw and manipulate mind maps and outlines. I find it a great application but for some reason the files it creates (.vym files) are considered an archive by Ubuntu.\nSo two questions, why are .vym files considered an archive and how can i change the file association to allow me to click on a .vym file and have it opened by VYM?\nThis is on the Ubuntu 12.04 most current version.\n\nA: There are file formats that actually are just archived XML files or something similar.\nWe can see here that this is exactly the case with VYM format.\nI'm not using GNOME desktop but I guess you should right-click the file, find an \"Open With\" item and point it to the VYM application. Don't forget to save the format association.\n\nA: Right click in the file you want, then click in properties, than click the tab open with.\nSelect the software you want to use to open the file.\n", "Q: HP EliteBook 8440p screen flickers after blank screen (nvidia) When my screen turns blank after 10 min or after locking the screen and I begin using the laptop again, the screen is flickering.\nIt looks as if every second line of pixels is blinking and the flickering is mainly present in the upper part of the screen.\nI am using Ubuntu 12.04 with the latest binary Nvidia drivers (current-updates).\nlshw | grep VGA tells me:\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GT218 [NVS 3100M] (rev a2)\nThe problem doesn’t occur after sleeping or on an external display.

I don't think its OS or driver related but rather that the screen itself or video card may be failing. \nThankfully, the laptop is still under warranty.\n\nA: Would recommend turning dithering off (disabled) using nvidia-settings. If it improves, update /etc/X11/xorg.conf to add the following in the \"Screen\" Section and restart X/or reboot.\nOption \"FlatPanelProperties\" \"Dithering=Disabled\"\nGood luck.\n", "Q: How to restore unity after gnome-shell installation?

No reboot required.\n\nA: Re-Installed ubuntu, the name is missing just because I disable guest-account.\n", "Q: How can I properly see lyrics in DeaDBeef? The solution should be the Infobar plugin - but in my case it doesn't look properly.\nIt should look like this (from the author's site)\n\nbut instead it looks like this, with a large empty space above the tabs:\n\nDoes anybody knows a solution or has the same problem?\n\nA: The latest DeaDBeef 0.5.5 doesn't seem to have this problem - the empty space disappears and the player looks fine with lyrics: but only as long as the File Browser plugin (or maybe some other plugin) is not used. Similar problems with other plugins are very possible.\nThe cause of this is explained by the author of infobar (here) as follows:\n\"Unfortunatelly, deadbeef doesn't provide API which allows to integrate third-party UI plugins into its interface (situation gonna be changed with release of version 0.6.0). In this situation infobar and filebrowser plugins use hacks to integrate themselves into deadbeef's interface and can't work together.\"\nIn v. 0.5.6 the Filebrowser and the gtk2 version of Infobar have the same incompatibility. But there is a gtk3 version of Infobar, and Deadbeef v. 0.5.6 has a gtk2-gtk3 GUI switch.\n\n Installing Infobar gtk3 and the File-browser, which is gtk 2, will result in using the two plugins alternatively: in the gtk2 GUI of Deadbeef only the file-browser will be visible, in the gtk3 GUI, only the Infobar. Switching between GUIs will switch between plugins too.  \nWhen lyrics are not found by Deadbeef/Infobar, use Foobar in wine and install the lyrics grabber addon. \n\n\nBut usually would not need that (the difference with Foobar is that it embeds the lyrics into the file: Deadbeef displays them from internet)\n\n", "Q: Was using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, working fine. now have only Grub prompt. What do I do now ? Laptop shut down due to errant battery. I was updating all programs on auto update option. Now all I have is a Grub> prompt. Where do I go from here.\nLaptop is an NEC Versa and Ubuntu was working fine up until that moment without any issues.\n\nA: If it is a grub rescue prompt, it is likely that grub cant find what is supposed to be booting. If it is just a generic grub prompt then it is likely something in boot files is messed up.\nIf you have a boot-cd that takes you into linux, I would suggest booting using that. mounting the drive under /mnt/my_drive, and running a chroot enviroment. the outline basics are bellow...\nThese commands require you to run them as a root/superuser, the prefered way to do this is prefix the commands with sudo , (alternatively you can use a root shell, created through running sudo -s). Which ever option you choose, beware, you can cause a lot of damage to your system using root, so use it with caution and sparingly.\nsudo mkdir /mnt/my_drive\n\nassuming your main partition is sda2\nsudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/my_drve\n\nthen bind the /dev /proc /sys over to your hard drive\nsudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/my_drive/dev\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/my_drive/proc\n\nsudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/my_drive/sys\n\nthen move into a chroot environment\nsudo chroot /mnt/my_drive /bin/bash\n\ncheck that any package installations are configured\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure -a\n\nfinally run the grub-install to repair the drive in question, often /dev/sda\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nand finally\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: How do I install a puppetmaster? I have a fairly large network, and I need to use some sort of configuration management tool to manage it. I've decided that Puppet Open Source meets my needs. How do I install it?\n\nA: Do note: This should work (and has been tested on) Ubuntu 10.04, 12.04 and 14.04. \nBoot the server, and then change the hostname to \n\npuppet\n\nTo do that, run sudoedit /etc/hosts and then change the $HOSTNAME (not localhost) entry to puppet.\nThen, run sudoedit /etc/hostname and delete the $HOSTNAME line, and then add puppet to it.\nNow, reboot the server.\nTo properly set up puppet, you need to be the root user. So become root by running:\nsudo -i\nand then entering your password when asked.\nNow, we're going to use the official Puppet repo, since it has newer versions of most of it.\nWe will download the latest puppet from http://apt.puppetlabs.com/, the command below will download the version designed for your version of Ubuntu, if the link fails, then your version of Ubuntu is not supported.\nwget http://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-$(lsb_release -sc).deb\ndpkg -i puppetlabs-release-$(lsb_release -sc).deb\n\nNow we have the puppet repository added.\napt-get update \n\nNow we have updated our sources.list, so apt-get knows where to find the puppetmaster package.\napt-get install puppetmaster\n\nNow, you're ready go and pull the strings!\n", "Q: I can't burn a CD in 12.04.

The system automounts the drive.\nPlease help.\nThank you.\n\nA: I assume that you are using Brasero. It seems to be a regression since this error was reported before (9.10, if I remember well).\nMy opinion is to use K3b:\nsudo apt-get install k3b\n\n\nA: Well, from just reading through the comments, and past experiences,  I have come across this problem many times, and it turned out to be that the drive is defective.  You can try removing the drive ( see IBM website for disassembly information) dust the connector, and plug it back in.

I'm not sure when this started happening but I know this used to work via firefox plugin, but since then I've done an in-place upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04\nThe issue is driving me to distraction now so I've done some experimentation and discovered that even from the command line it's broken\ntotem http://users.skynet.be/fa046054/home/P22/track06.mp3\n\nThis says it's streaming then status bar updates to \"playing\" but just stalls and does nothing.\nIf, however I download the file first there's no issue:\nwget http://users.skynet.be/fa046054/home/P22/track06.mp3 && totem track06.mp3\n\nThe symptom is the same calling totem from firefox plugin, regular gui and cli.\nSome additional info:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS: Precise 12.04 (AMD64)\n\n*WM: Gnome 3\n\n\nAd endum\nI do not want to install VLC.

The approaches here were not working for me; I wasn't even able to remove and reinstall software center. The solution from this page solved my problem, and I don't see this solution here:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus-dropbox/+bug/1016559\nSpecifically, the answer #9 provided by Patrick:\nRun, as you did before:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nPress CONTROL+C to before the download of Dropbox [gets to 99%].\nRemove dropbox:\nsudo apt-get purge nautilus-dropbox\n\nThe instructions to install dropbox is provided by the dropbox website.

After that I upgraded the packages.\n\nA: i found that searching for the dpkg and sudo kill the process made the software center unresponsive which worked out well because all i had to do is reinstall software center.\nsudo apt-get remove software-center\nsudo apt-get autoremove software-center\nTo re-install Software Center:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install software-center\nseems to work for me (note that i had tryed reinstalling before killing the dpkg and it still was stuck on \"applying changes\" so make sure to not skip out on that. :) hope this helps someone\n\nA: The best solution to these , is this:\nsudo apt-get remove software-center\nsudo apt-get autoremove software-center\n\nTo re-install Software Center:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install software-center\n\n\nA: Before deleting locks or killing anything, close all windows and make sure there is not a EULA popped up behind the Software Centre. These EULAs are very common, especially with software outside of the main repositories. \nif that fails follow the other suggestions to unlock and kill the install process and try \nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nor \ndpkg --configure -a \n\n\nA: When this happened to me, it was because I had inadvertently installed \"apt-listchanges\". Remove the package to see if it resolves the issue:\nsudo apt-get remove apt-listchanges\nGood luck.\n\nA: You could try a reboot. \nIt would solve your problem.\n", "Q: How do I enlist a server in puppet? I've installed a puppetmaster as described here. Now, I need to add a few puppet agents. How can I do that?\n\nA: Do note: This should work (and has been tested on) Ubuntu 10.04 and 12.04. \nNow, we're going to use the official Puppet repo, since it has newer versions of most of it.\nTo do that, \nwget http://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-precise.deb\nsudo dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-precise.deb\n\nNow we have the puppet repository added.\nsudo apt-get update \n\nNow we have updated our sources.list, so apt-get knows where to find the puppet package.\nsudo apt-get install puppet\n\nmake sure you can ping the puppet master at 'puppet'.\nNow, you need to use the root user for this. \nRun\nsudo -i\n\non both the agent and the puppetmaster.\nNow, on the agent:\npuppet agent --test\n\nIt should return some output like this:\nroot@puppetslave2:~# puppet agent --test\ninfo: Creating a new SSL key for puppetslave2.home\nwarning: peer certificate won't be verified in this SSL session\ninfo: Caching certificate for ca\nwarning: peer certificate won't be verified in this SSL session\nwarning: peer certificate won't be verified in this SSL session\ninfo: Creating a new SSL certificate request for puppetslave2.home\ninfo: Certificate Request fingerprint (md5): 04:8F:9A:99:0F:FF:26:7C:FC:2D:9C:8B:B8:B8:DF:17\nwarning: peer certificate won't be verified in this SSL session\nwarning: peer certificate won't be verified in this SSL session\nwarning: peer certificate won't be verified in this SSL session\nExiting; no certificate found and waitforcert is disabled\n\non master:\npuppet cert list\n\nroot@puppet:~# puppet cert list\n  puppetslave2.home (04:8F:9A:99:0F:FF:26:7C:FC:2D:9C:8B:B8:B8:DF:17)\n\npuppet cert sign puppetslave2.home\n\nAnd then the output should be something like this:\nroot@puppet:~# puppet cert sign puppetslave2.home\nnotice: Signed certificate request for puppetslave2.home\nnotice: Removing file Puppet::SSL::CertificateRequest puppetslave2.home at '/var/lib/puppet/ssl/ca/requests/puppetslave2.home.pem'\n\nnow go do\npuppet agent --test\n\non the agent. it should succeed, if you have a manifest on the puppetmaster for it.

If I'm going to use it as a public cloud PXE boot from client. How I can compute power and traffic for each vm to do accounting for client?\n\nA: I don't think you can compute power for individual VMs, but one way to compute power for the entire rack is to install an intelligent PDU that allows SNMP management. For a vendor specific example, see here:\nhttp://www.dell.com/us/enterprise/p/dell-pdu\nA generic description of PDUs:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_distribution_unit\nAs for MAAS cloud can you be a bit more specific like provide a URL? Most cloud products support some kind of SNMP management so you could for example enable SNMP on the interface and then run an accounting program against the SNMP statistics. One example would be PRTG with it's billing API:\nhttp://www.paessler.com/blog/2011/01/31/prtg-8/billing-tool-for-prtg-version-10-released\nWe've succesfully installed this in our environment but it's quite specific and had to be customized (we needed a Web/PHP developer to get it going).\nAnother way to account for traffic would be to use a Netflow collector and enable Netflow on the interfaces (if MAAS Cloud supports this).\n", "Q: chmod: invalid mode: `+a' System: ( lsb_release -a )\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS\nRelease:        10.04\nCodename:       lucid\n\nThis is my command:\nsudo chmod +a \"www-data allow delete,write,append,file_inherit,directory_inherit\" app/cache app/logs\n\nDocs:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/installation.html#configuration-and-setup\nError:\nchmod: invalid mode: `+a'\nTry `chmod --help' for more information.\n\nWhy doesn't this work?

But if you would prefer to use a USB, please follow the instructions below. Note: this procedure requires an .img file that you will be required to create from the .iso file you download. TIP: Drag and Drop a file from Finder to Terminal to 'paste' the full path without typing and risking type errors.\n-> Download the desired file\n-> Open the Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities/ or query Terminal in Spotlight)\n-> Convert the .iso file to .img using the convert option of hdiutil (e.g., hdiutil convert -format UDRW -o ~/path/to/target.img ~/path/to/ubuntu.iso) \nNote: OS X tends to put the .dmg ending on the output file automatically.\n-> Run diskutil list to get the current list of devices\n    Insert your flash media\n-> Run diskutil list again and determine the device node assigned to your flash media (e.g., /dev/disk2)\n-> Run diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN (replace N with the disk number from the last command; in the previous example, N would be 2)\n-> Execute sudo dd if=/path/to/downloaded.img of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m (replace /path/to/downloaded.img with the path where the image file is located; for example, ./ubuntu.img or ./ubuntu.dmg).\nUsing /dev/rdisk instead of /dev/disk may be faster.\n\nIf you see the error dd: Invalid number '1m', you are using GNU dd.

That's because it makes it so much easier to adjust partition size later, even on live systems and modern file systems.\nThen I would make root small about 1GB, /usr about 6GB, /var about 2GB, /boot about 512 MB, swap same size as RAM, /var/log, /home and /srv large enough. It can be adjusted later.\nI would not used all unallocated space now, as that could later be used to expand the other partitions, as I'm using LVM2.  I could even add new paritions like /tmp, but that is a bit more complicated. I never use anything but LVM2 anymore.

It may happen that you are forced by somebody to decrypt the\n  operating system or to reveal the pre-boot authentication password.\n  There are many situations where you cannot refuse to do so (for\n  example, due to extortion). TrueCrypt allows you to create a hidden\n  operating system whose existence should be impossible to prove\n  (provided that certain guidelines are followed — see below). Thus, you\n  will not have to decrypt or reveal the password for the hidden\n  operating system. See here and here.\n\n\n\nIn order to boot a system encrypted by TrueCrypt, an unencrypted copy\n  of the TrueCrypt Boot Loader has to be stored on the system drive or\n  on a TrueCrypt Rescue Disk. Hence, the mere presence of the TrueCrypt\n  Boot Loader can indicate that there is a system encrypted by TrueCrypt\n  on the computer.\n\nSource: redobackup.org\n", "Q: Ubuntu apps open folders instead of documents? I must have done something to Ubuntu 12.04 on my latop because a few weeks ago, various applications (Chrome, Calibre, etc.) have stopped opening documents (like PDFs, zip files, etc.).  What happens when these applications try to open a file is that I get a new Nautilus window that is opened to the directory that holds the document.\nIf I then double click the document in the nautilus window, the appropriate app is opened up (Adobe Reader, File Roller, etc.). Because of this, I don't think the issue is with the association between file types and apps, but I could be wrong.\nI have another desktop system running 12.04 where everything works as expected.  \nWhat would cause this and how to I fix it?\n\nA: Allthough this question is allready older I just had the same issue.

I suppose there may be a one-line Linux command to check that.\n\nA: I don't know if you can specifically identify what you're looking for, and I'm not entirely sure what you mean since Google Apps is a suite of stuff. Sites are hosted by other products that form a part of Google Apps. I'm assuming that you mean to refer to Google Sites.\nThe function below actually looks for sites that contain GSE in their server name in the HTTP headers. Cursory tests indicate that this will identify Google Sites, but those tests are incomplete.\nDefine this function somewhere. You can type it directly into Bash, or put it into one of your shell startup files:\nfunction hosted_by_google_sites {\n  if [[ \"$(curl --head --silent \"$1\" | egrep '^Server:')\" =~ GSE ]]; then\n    return 0\n  else\n    return 1\n  fi\n}\n\nYou can use it like this:\nif hosted_by_google_sites \"http://www.example.com/some_url\"; then\n  do_something\nfi\n\nOr:\nhosted_by_google_sites \"http://www.example.com/some_url\" && echo \"Yes.

I've recently upgraded my server to Ubuntu Server 12.04.  Previously it was running 11.04.\nEver since then I've been having trouble carrying out root user commands through sudo.  An example of this would be:\n> sudo ufw status\nsudo: ufw: command not found\n> sudo su - root\n> ufw status\nStatus: active\n\nTo                         Action      From\n--                         ------      ----\nOpenSSH                    LIMIT       Anywhere\n\nWith Ubuntu 11.04 the plain sudo ufw status worked fine, but with Ubuntu 12.04 it can't find the command.\nThis seems to just be a problem with the PATH not being set (ufw is found in /usr/sbin/ufw).\nWhat I'm trying to understand is what I need to change back so that root's PATH is set correctly when I just sudo <sbin command>?\n\nA: Have you looked into the man page for sudo?  In the section SECURITY NOTES they talk about how sudo uses the PATH variable.\nYou also want to look into /etc/sudoers as the PATH can be changed there with secure_path. Settings can also be done by files in the directory /etc/sudoers.d/.\nIt is suggested to make changes to your sudo configuration by creating files in /etc/sudoers.d/ because then your changes will remain independent of changes to /etc/sudoers that might occur when upgrading sudo to a new version. You should still use the visudo command to create and edit files in /etc/sudoers.d/.\n\nA: Besides security reasons (as Anders has referred to), keeping the original user's PATH also conforms to the Principle of Least Astonishment.\nSuppose you run a program called foo, but discover that you really need to run it as root. So you run sudo foo. It would be bad if the program run by sudo foo is different from the program run by foo, which would happen if there's a different foo in root's PATH. This would fundamentally violate your expectations and the general assumption that sudo does the same thing as what you put after it, except as root.\nThat's what would happen if sudo prepended root's PATH to your PATH. But suppose sudo appended root's path to your PATH. If this was sudo's behavior, then you'd probably assume that if you can run a program (call it bar) when simulating an initial root login shell (sudo -i), you could also run it with sudo bar. But that assumption would be wrong, because there might be a different bar in your own (i.e., not root's) path.\nRather than sudo's behavior changing from one Ubuntu release to another, what probably happened was that your PATH changed. If you add /sbin, /usr/sbin, and /usr/local/sbin to your PATH, the problem will be solved. Unless you only want sbin in your PATH when running programs as root. In that case, I recommend posting a separate question about that (though one technique for accomplishing this is hinted at in Anders's answer.)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 install goes to blanks screen with cursor Memtest works fine, but \"Try Ubuntu\", \"Install Ubuntu\", and \"Check Disk For Defects\" go to a blank screen with a blinking cursor.\nI'm using the 64bit installer because that is what, I think, works with AMD processors.\nHardware:\nAMD Sempron, Award Bios and a Gigabyte video card\n\nA: The choice of installer selected by you is fine since AMD Sempron is a 64 bit processor.\nBut, the the installation is not going beyond the initial black screen may be because your system is not having the basic requirements for 12.04 satisfied I hope.\n", "Q: system problem! ubuntu 12.4 when I was upgrading to ubuntu 12.4 I had to leave and accidentally turned off the laptop in half update.

Select the area of the screen you want to capture by drawing a rectangle around it and it'll capture that, upload to imgur and tell you the URL.\nIt internally uses imgurbash.sh but has a workaround if you don't want to install that dependency.\n\nA: Imgur provides tools for this. You can even download a shell script from imgur.com which works from the command line. \nOf course, installing software directly instead of using Ubuntu's official repository opens a security hole which makes GNU/Linux vulnerable to trojan malware. While usually not recommended, you can still do it, if you want to. Here's how.\nFirst, if you do not have a personal bin directory to store executables, create one by running the following commands:\ncd\nmkdir bin\nsource .profile\n\nTo download and install the imgur script, run the following commands (you do not need to be root):\nwget http://imgur.com/tools/imgurbash.sh\nchmod a+x imgurbash.sh\nmv imgurbash.sh ~/bin/imgur\n\nNow, simply run imgur with the path to an image to upload it to Imgur.\nFor example:\nimgur /usr/share/banshee/icons/hicolor/128x128/devices/phone-google-nexus-one.png\n\nThis gives the following output:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/SoIwv.png\nDelete page: http://imgur.com/delete/VTtZOI9LOhtZ2oB\nHaven't copied to the clipboard: no $DISPLAY\n\nThe first line is the link to the Imgur page, and the second line is the link to delete the image you just uploaded. If possible, the script will also copy the Imgur url to the clipboard for immediate use.\nEnjoy!\n[Note: this answer previously suggested running the commands as root in order to put the imgur script into /bin. Using root should be avoided whenever possible. In this case, we can create a user's personal ~/bin directory.

Panel would take a dedicated space on the screen and it won't let you maximize any other window over it. So use desktop to solve this issue if you are using newer versions of Conky and Ubuntu.\nEdit: Apparently the definition had the same information ever since but for some reason the accepted answer has panel as the answer.

Can I change this behavior? this one is regarding KDE in Ubuntu 12.04.\nThe thing is that whenever I click below the window title bar in KDE, the window manager always assumes I want to drag the window, not just activate it. Clicking the title bar activates the window without dragging it just fine, however I sometimes find it hard to click because it's rather narrow :) Is there any way to change this behavior (besides the obvious \"make your title bar larger\" thing)?\nI also assume this is happening to Gtk applications only (Firefox, Thunderbird, Synaptic), as I have tried it with several KDE apps (KWrite, KTorrent, Gwenview, Konsole) and noticed no such behavior.\nThanks in advance! \n\nA: Check your \"Window Behavior\" settings.

My guess is that your laptop is like mine (Lenovo T430), where the Intel GPU has access to the the internal display and a VGA port, and the Nvidia GPU has access to the internal display and the two DVI ports.\nI'm guessing from the fact you have to re-configure the Nvidia settings after start-up that by default it uses the laptop display and one of the monitors, and you then make it only use the two monitors?\nAnyway, since you need it to work with Optimus enabled so it can work alongside Windows, you have at most three options available to you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bumblebee (Nvidia / max 2 displays)\n\n*Nvidia Prime (Nvidia / max 2 displays)\n\n*Optimus Prime (Nouveau / Proper Linux Way(TM) / max 4 displays)\n\n\nBumblebee is no good for you since it only uses the Nvidia GPU for 3D offloading, and doesn't allow the Intel GPU to render to display ports that are only connected to the Nvidia GPU. I don't know enough about Nvidia Prime to be sure, but I suspect it has the same limitation as Bumblebee, even though it allows the Nvidia GPU to take control of all rendering.\nI therefore suspect that your only option is to use Optimus Prime, which if it works will allow you to use your laptop display at the same time as using your two monitors. YMMV, but because of various regressions I've noticed with my laptop, I'd say Ubuntu 13.10 may be your best bet. Because Optimus Prime relies on the open source drivers, you can easily test to see if it works using a live install.\nIf you can't find a version of Ubuntu that works for you than you may find that Fedora 19 works — Fedora 20 and 21 probably won't because of these same regressions.

As soon as I turned the headset off the connection was perfect. When the headset was on the speed would drop dramatically and the ping times were about 10x longer.

If I set the panel to have 2 workspaces and I try to switch with the keyboard shortcut, I end up finding that I have 8 workspaces total; four that change with the keyboard shortcut per workspace in the workspace switcher (which I can only change between with the mouse).\nIf I right click on the Workspace Switcher and set it to have 1 workspace, I can still use Ctrl + Alt + Arrow to switch between 4 different workspaces. It's as if I have two nested workspace managers running. If I look at workspace settings in gconf-editor, the settings don't match the ones shown if I right click on the Workspace Switcher in the panel. I want to remove one of the two competing programs, any ideas?\n2) I ended up setting the Workspace Switcher to have 1 workspace, and just used the four other workspaces that show up with keyboard shortcuts to work around my first problem. However, I notice that some windows (Libre Office, pdf viewer) tend to get \"dragged\" with me when I switch workspaces (but only once, they never get dragged back to the original workspace I put them on).\nI'm using Gnome Classic instead of Unity, I feel this has something to do with these problems but I will eat myself alive before I switch to Unity.\n\nA: I had the same problem.\nopen Compiz config setting Manager \nclick on general options\nclick on Desktop Size tab\nsee if your settings are:\n    Horizontal Virtual Size =4\n    Vertical Virtual Size =1\n    Number of Desktops =4 (Change this to 1 and your switcher will work)\nAlso look at your Viewpoint Switcher.

How can I copy, recursive directory, \nonly files with a attribute 1, \nand reset this a attribute to 0?\nThanks, Francisco\n\nA: You will probably have to install the package attr if you want to set and get extended attributes.\nYou can write a script in a shell language, or a higher level language to descend directories and examine each file, copying the ones that meet your criteria. I would use python, personally.\nBy using the getfattr command you can retrieve the value for a user.name you define yourself as an extended attribute. After copying the file you could then set a different value by executing the setfattr command.\nI don't see an option for rsync or dump to do this. Dump is said to ignore files with the d (non-extended) attribute set. These regular attributes are set with chattr and attributes are examined with lsattr. These commands also include setting a version for a file, in case that can be used as a substitute for the bit setting/clearing you are asking about. I suppose you could make the version alternate between 0 and 1 if you like. See man chattr and man lsattr and, in particular, the -v option.\nThe legacy dump command appears to use a file (/var/lib/dumpdates) of its own to keep track of what has been backed-up when so it can backup incrementally, which may be the sort of thing you are getting at.\nIt may be helpful to know more about what you are trying to achieve in case there is another approach that doesn't involve programming.\n", "Q: Upgrade MySQL to 5.5 on Lucid, upgrade server to Precise or switch to Percona? Looking into upgrading mysql on our development server to which is running 10.04 so is stuck at MySQL 5.1, as it appears there is no apt-get support for upgrading to 5.5 except by certain 3rd party PPAs.\nSo I'm looking for which route to take and what other people have done:\na. Follow a couple year old guide to manually install MySQL 5.5 and then invest ongoing time into manually downloading and installing security updates every month or two?\nb. Upgrade 10.04 to 12.04, and from other peoples experience I work with spend several days working out the kinks of that large upgrade, then I'll have access to mysql 5.5 and easy apt-get installation of future security updates?\nc. Switch from MySQL to Percona Server 5.5 and get all the benefits of that version of MySQL, plus easy apt-get updates with their PPA?\nd. Something else?\n\nA: This should be a question you should ask your team. We decided to update Ubuntu but we tend to stick to the same OS once we choose it and only once switched from Fedora to Ubuntu when Ubuntu got useful (that was when 6.06 came out).\nAll of our servers that are in use with data for our clients are updated to 12.04 as soon as we felt it was worth it. We have 3 identical servers synch'd (ie. MySQL data replication, synching our software) where 2 are setup as automatic fallbacks if the main one drops out.\nThe 2nd fallback machine we took offline and informed out clients we'd be running on 1 fallback machine for the next 12 hours as a regular maintenance action. Updated it to 12.04, updated our software and tested the system for a fair amount of time. The update to 12.04 went flawless by the way.\nWe then made it play catch up, turned it into the main machine and did the same actions for the 2nd and 3rd machine. Zero downtime. We could have run into trouble if the main and fallback systems would drop out but if that happens 999 out of a 1000 times it is just 1 machine (and hell would break loose). \nIn short...\nSo B would be my option. It is a proven method so less risky than option A. Option C might be an option but switching OS might be more of a hassle (for us it would involve serveral days, weeks of checking if everything works the way we want it).\n", "Q: GRUB broken again Please help, my grub is broken again, and again, I don't know why, maybe latest update, I'm not sure, it starts to annoy me.\nError I get when I boot:\nSymbol not found: grub_divmod64_fulll\n\nAnd it prompts grub rescue console:\ngrub rescue>\n\nI tried to follow this tut, after booting from live DC I did:\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo fdisk -l\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 163.9 GB, 163927522816 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 19929 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00000000\n\nDisk /dev/sda doesn't contain a valid partition table\n\nDisk /dev/sdb: 640.1 GB, 640133946880 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 77825 cylinders\nUnits = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x3dcf5202\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1   *           1        3917    31463271    7  HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sdb2            3918       77826   593667163    f  W95 Ext'd (LBA)\n/dev/sdb5            3918       43080   314576766    7  HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sdb6           77328       77826     4000768   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sdb7           43081       77197   274041856   83  Linux\n/dev/sdb8           77197       77327     1045504   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nPartition table entries are not in disk order\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ df -Th \nFilesystem    Type    Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\naufs          aufs    1.5G  101M  1.4G   7% /\nnone      devtmpfs    1.5G  700K  1.5G   1% /dev\n/dev/sr0   iso9660    686M  686M     0 100% /cdrom\n/dev/loop0\n          squashfs    658M  658M     0 100% /rofs\nnone         tmpfs    1.5G  216K  1.5G   1% /dev/shm\ntmpfs        tmpfs    1.5G  628K  1.5G   1% /tmp\nnone         tmpfs    1.5G   96K  1.5G   1% /var/run\nnone         tmpfs    1.5G  4.0K  1.5G   1% /var/lock\n/dev/sdb1  fuseblk     31G   12G   19G  38% /mnt\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo mount --bind /dev  /mnt/dev\nmount: mount point /mnt/dev does not exist\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo mount --bind /dev/pts  /mnt/dev/pts\nmount: mount point /mnt/dev/pts does not exist\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\nmount: mount point /mnt/proc does not exist\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo mount --bind /sys  /mnt/sys \nmount: mount point /mnt/sys does not exist\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo chroot /mnt \nchroot: failed to run command `/bin/bash': No such file or directory\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo update-grub \n/usr/sbin/grub-probe: error: cannot stat `aufs'.\n\nAny idea?\n\nA: I have fixed it with Rescatux.\nI still have:\numpirsky@umpirsky:~$ sudo fdisk -l\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 640.1 GB, 640133946880 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 77825 cylinders, total 1250261615 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x3dcf5202\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *          63    62926604    31463271    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda2        62926666  1250260991   593667163    f  W95 Ext'd (LBA)\n/dev/sda5        62926668   692080199   314576766    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda6      1242259456  1250260991     4000768   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sda7       692080640  1240164351   274041856   83  Linux\n/dev/sda8      1240166400  1242257407     1045504   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nPartition table entries are not in disk order\n\nDisk /dev/sdb: 163.9 GB, 163927522816 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 19929 cylinders, total 320170943 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x00000000\n\nDisk /dev/sdb doesn't contain a valid partition table\n\nBut everything works like before.\n", "Q: How to make a lib file (libtxc-dxtn0) used by only the apps that need it?

I have a computer (10.04) that was previously running Thunderbird 12.0.1 just fine (installed via apt-get via official PPA). I don't know what happened at the time the problem started since this is a multi-user computer and I was not here. However, every time we try to launch TB, we immediately get a dialog that says:\nWe're Sorry\nThunderbird had a problem and crashed.\n\nThings I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Running thunderbird from a terminal produces no output.\n\n*I tried apt-get remove thunderbird --purge and then reinstalled\n\n*Deleting the user's .thunderbird folder and launching still results in a crash\n\n*Attempting to run thunderbird -safe-mode still results in a crash\n\n*This problem occurs for all users of Thunderbird on this computer.\n\n\nIs there any way to get more details on why the program is crashing? For example, the specific error that TB is encountering? I tried thunderbird -g but I'm not sure what to do with the debugger.\nUPDATE\napt-cache policy thunderbird\nthunderbird:\n  Installed: 12.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1\n  Candidate: 12.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1\n  Version table:\n *** 12.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1 0\n        500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid-updates/main Packages\n        500 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid-security/main Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     11.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1~mts1 0\n        500 http://ppa.launchpad.net/mozillateam/thunderbird-stable/ubuntu/ lucid/main Packages\n     3.0.4+nobinonly-0ubuntu4 0\n        500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid/main Packages\n\n\nA: Reporting and Getting Information About this Crash Bug\nSince this is a bug (application crashes are definitely not intended behavior), you can do the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable Apport crash reporting, so that when the crash happens next, information will be automatically gathered, displayed, and (if you wish, which I highly recommend) submitted for attachment to your bug report.\n\n*When you submit the information to Launchpad for attachment to your bug report, a new browser window/tab will open. Wait for the information to be processed, and you'll be able to describe what happened (as best you can).\n\n*Launchpad may suggest existing bugs that this is a duplicate of. If any come up, you can read the information written there and see if you think you can be pretty sure yours is the same. If not, submit your bug report--it can be marked as a duplicate of another bug later, if it turns out to be one.\n\n*Before submitting the bug report, please read this thoroughly and carefully, as that explains the important considerations for reporting bugs in Ubuntu. That also explains the whole process in more detail than this answer. (You may want to do read this even before doing the other steps.)\n\n*When you're happy with your bug report, submit it. It may be marked as a duplicate of another bug, and if so, you might find information in that bug. Even if not, triagers and developers, in the process of investigating your bug, may be able to give you information that would help. And even if they cannot, submitting the bug report is the first step to getting the bug fixed, which should help you and anyone else suffering from it.\nA Possible Workaround for Thunderbird Crashes In General\nMany Firefox and Thunderbird crashes happen because of bugs handling your profile or other user-specific data. You should see if the crash occurs when you run Thunderbird in another user account. (If you only have one account, you can create another one to test this.)\nIf the problem does not occur when you run Thunderbird in another user account, then you can move your Thunderbird profile \"out of the way\" by renaming the directory that contains it. Thunderbird will not have access to your locally stored emails, and you'll have to reconfigure it for all your email accounts, but this may solve the problem for you, and this also useful information for your bug report.\nI recommend submitting your bug report before doing this, so that information from the crash gets submitted even if this technique solves the problem and you don't want to reverse it. Then you can edit your bug report to include information about what happened. Alternatively, produce the crash, submit the crash data to Launchpad, try this, and include information about it in your original bug report.\nTo move your Thunderbird profile out of the way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure Thunderbird is not running.\n\n*In your home directory, find the folder called .thunderbird. (You will have to do View > Show Hidden Files--or Ctrl+H--in the Nautilus file browser to see it, as files and folders that start with a . are hidden by default.)\n\n*Rename this file to thunderbird.old. \n\n*Start up Thunderbird.\nAlternatively, you may prefer to do this from the Terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure Thunderbird is not running.\n\n*Open the Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T).\n\n*Run this command:\nmv ~/thunderbird ~/thunderbird.old\n\n\n*Start up Thunderbird.\nI think some older versions of Thunderbird might store your profile in ~/.mozilla/thunderbird rather than ~/.thunderbird, so if ~/.thunderbird doesn't exist, you might want to look in ~/.mozilla.\nEnsuring All Systemwide Configuration Files From the PPA Version Are Removed\nThe output of apt-cache policy thunderbird confirms that the PPA version is no longer installed. However, it's possible that there are some systemwide configuration files left over from it. It may have left systemwide configuration data that the newer version (from Ubuntu's official software sources) is choking on. To account for the possibility that it left configuration files other than those automatically created by the current version, you should purge not just the current systemwide configuration data, but the old one too. And this is an opportunity to reinstall Thunderbird as well, in case the installation is somehow corrupted.\nSo, the following directions do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove Thunderbird and all its systemwide configuration files.\n\n*Install the old PPA version of Thunderbird. (This is temporary, and only to facilitate remove it more completely than before.)\n\n*Remove the old PPA version of Thunderbird and all its systemwide configuration data files.\n\n*Reinstall Thunderbird (the current version, from the official software sources).\nHere's how to achieve this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure Thunderbird is not running.\n\n*Run these commands in a Terminal window:\nsudo apt-get --purge --reinstall install thunderbird=11.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.10.04.1~mts1\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get --purge --reinstall install thunderbird\n\n\n*Run Thunderbird, and see if the problem is fixed.\nThis will probably not help...but it might fix the problem, and it's definitely worth trying. If/when you report this as a bug, whether or not this worked will be relevant. (Though if it does work, you might decide not to report the bug.)\nPlease note that your current systemwide Thunderbird configuration files (if any) will also be purged, but that won't make you lose stored emails or account settings because that is user-specific rather than systemwide.\n\nA: I experienced the same behaviour on 12.04.\nI disabled all Add-ons in safe mode:\nthunderbird -safe-mode\n\nwhat had no effect. \nAfter that I remove and installed thunderbird\nsudo apt-get remove thunderbird\nsudo apt-get install thunderbird\n\nwhich allowed me to restart thunderbird. \nAfterwards I activated the Add-ons one by one. \n", "Q: Privacy: Record activity ON? In Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, System Settings > Privacy > Files, 'Record Activity' is ON by default.\nWhat does this mean exactly?\nWhich activities are being recorded?\nWhere can I find the recorded data?\n\nA: Unity uses information logged by zeitgeist-datahub to improve performance.\nThere is a nice review, with screenshots, here\nI do not think there is a single location where your activity is logged.\n\nContent from above link:\n\nUbuntu 12.04's new dedicated Privacy menu has a lot going for it. Since the new Unity UI records your recent activity for better working of functionalities like Unity Dash, control of what Ubuntu is allowed to record and store becomes paramount.\n\n\n\nAs you can see, Record Activity option is set to ON by default. Also, there are options for deleting every bit of information that has been stored overtime.\nYou can specify the kind of files whose activities you don't want to be recorded. Optionally, you can deselect specific folders from the watch-list.\n\n\n\nSame can be done for applications as well. You are allowed to manually select specific applications that you don't want to be recorded. As you can see, selecting applications has also been made easy since it comes sorted based on their daily activity by default.\n\n\n\nAnd then there is this diagnostics tool which when activated, lets your Ubuntu send anonymous information such as error reports to Canonical automatically. Also, this option is disabled by default.\n\n\n\nA: \nWhat does this mean exactly?\n\nIt means that some of your relevant information is being recorded which can be used to improve the user experience. Please note that none of these info is being sent to any website. It resides solely on your computer\n\n\nWhich activities are being recorded?\n\nIn default install of Ubuntu, only files which you open and application launches are recorded. This log is being used by Unity Dash to find files.\nSo this means if you open a video file, open an audio file or document, it is recorded. \nTomboy or gnote notes are not recorded. You need to install plugin explicitly for that\nRhythmbox comes installed with a plugin to log the activity, but it is NOT activated by default. Check Edit > Plugins\nBanshee also has plugin to record your activity, but the stock install of banshee does not install the plugin.\nTL;DR; Only file activity and application launch event is logged as of now in Ubuntu 12.04\n\n\nWhere can I find the recorded data?\n\nThe data is being stored at ~/.local/share/zeitgeist/activity.sqlite\nIt's an SQLite database. It is recommended not to open it directly and should accessed only via API.\n\nA: \nWhat does this mean exactly?\n\nYour activities are recorded in order to better understand how you are using your system. Using this extensive knowledge, the performance of the system can be improved considerably. \nFor example, knowing which application you launcher when you start your computer would help the system to pre-launch the application in the future, etc.\n\nWhich activities are being recorded?\n\nActivities like viewing and editing audio, video, documents, notes, images, conversations in Empathy, emails, music played are all recorded. Not just the activity itself, but how you carried out the activity are also recorded. \nIn the case of listening to music, how you played the song will be recorded including whether you launched it from Unity dash, Nautilus or from Rhythmbox, etc.\nI would believe the Zeitgeist team is working on adding more plugins for recording more activities like the commands used in terminal, websites visited, etc. \n\nWhere can I find the recorded data?\n\nYour activity data is stored in ~/.local/share/zeitgeist.\nYou can use gnome-activity-journal  to view the recorded activities in a human friendly way.\n\nWe have an extensive tag wiki about zeitgeist that explains how Zeitgeist works and how it is useful on the whole among other things. \n\nA: There are 2 kinds of \"tracking\" questions in this thread. I guess, what zeitgeist records is clear by the other answers.\n\"Recent documents\" etc is not stored by this daemon. It is stored in 2 files in your homedir:\n./.recently-used\n./.local/share/recently-used.xbel\nI, personally, don't like this either (it clutters search results), so, the following commands \"disable\" this. Warning; it does not actually \"disable\" anything, it will just prevent applications from writing to these files.\ncd ~\n> ./.recently-used\n> ./.local/share/recently-used.xbel\nsudo chattr +i ./.recently-used\nsudo chattr +i ./.local/share/recently-used.xbel\n\nSome applications may report errors or warnings when not being able to write to this file, especially when launched from a terminal (\"operation not permitted\")\n\nA: \nWhat does this mean exactly?\n\nNot a whole lot. Even if you change this option to OFF, Ubuntu will still show your activity in Places -> Recent Documents, so obviously, it will still keep a history of your activity.

Last few days I found out that when I open Google Chrome and the laptop's fans start working really hard and I can not touch the mousepad because of heating.\nI use Ubuntu 11.10 on my Toshiba A350-22z laptop and monitor CPU and hard drive temperature. Both cores reached 104 Celsius and I read somewhere \"if your processor reaches 105 Celsius it harms itself\". I cleaned the inside of of laptop a year ago but there is a point when the weather reaches about 20 Celsius there was no problem. I know hardware cleaning is the best solution but how can I solve with another way? I think the problem is related to the hot weather outside. Is there anybody that has the same problem? In addition to Google Chrome, I realized that when I open online video, the processor temperature increases very quickly.\n\nA: If it has been a year, then it is time to clean the dust out again, and make sure that the fan is spinning correctly.  If there is no significant dust and the fan is spinning ( at the correct speed ), then you may try removing the heatsink, cleaning and reapplying the thermal paste.\nYou also might try the boot option pcie_aspm=force as some people have reported that helps.  Run sudo gedit /etc/default/grub and add that option to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT options, then run sudo update-grub and reboot.\n\nA: I put two books under my laptop (one on each side).

I understand that Lubuntu utilizes LXDE over Ubuntu's Unity(Gnome?); But being new to Linux I'm not sure if that change is going to be simply cosmetic, or if there will be functional differences I need to be aware of. The Ubuntu wiki says no, but it is also seems to be a very superficial discussion. I am comfortable(ish) with the command line and I suppose my question is more directed in that direction, but any information would be great. \n\nA: As Ubuntu wiki says:\n\nBoth Lubuntu and Ubuntu share:\nSame Core System\n\nSame Repositories \n\nThe differences between Lubuntu and Ubuntu are:\nDifferent DE - Lubuntu uses LXDE while Ubuntu uses Unity as the default DE.\n\nDifferent Default Applications \n\nRather than that, they are the same. The DE is what makes Lubuntu a\n  lightweight OS and of course the selected applications too because we\n  make sure to use the lightest applications which are not resource\n  hungry.\n\nThe default applications differ. For example, Lubuntu comes with Sylpheed instead of Thunderbird. But you can manually install whatever you need because the repositories are the same.\nAnything you do on the command-line will likely be the same, except that some applications may not be installed by default or you may need to edit slightly. For example, Gnome's gnome-open command to open a file with the default application is xdg-open in Unity, and in Lubuntu may be something else.\n", "Q: How do you bind the Fn key to the Ctrl function?

So it appeals to me that Ubuntu is a download/upload kind of thing.\nApple iMac G4 1.25GHz\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: download the Desktop version for ppc computers from here. \nThen just make a bootable usb or CD, and install it from there. \n\n\n*\n\n*How do I get my Mac to boot from an Ubuntu USB key? will help you further.\n\n*This is the ppc wiki by Ubuntu.\n\n\nA PPC Mac is a loose expression, I can't speak for your computer. You wont know until you try. But, if you look at the recommended system requirements and see that your PPC Mac fits that description, then go for it! Remember make a backup of your original system so you can go back if it doesn't fit your needs in terms of performance and such. \nTo quote the download site:\n\ninstalls on systems with less than about 384MiB of RAM (although note\n  that low-memory systems may not be able to run a full desktop\n  environment reasonably).\n\nThe download link: (check alternate install)\n\n\n*\n\n*http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/12.04/release/\n\nA: I'm also totally beginner and know nothing about Linux command lines etc. After getting an eMAC recently, 1ghz processor and 1gb of ram, and seeing how slow OSx 10.4 is, I thought, cool lets try Linux. Many suggested Debian for PPC because its lightweight. Well, after a netinstall cd and successful net update and installation of the GUI, I couldnt get it to boot beyond a black screen. Eventually with some fiddling got to a command prompt I could see. Back to the net, I found and downloaded the Live desktop version Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS for powerpc, burnt the image using poweriso on a windows machine onto Cd and it wouldnt boot to the disc, then burnt the image to a dvd and it booted the live session and from there it installed with no issues and is currently running. But word of caution, it's damn s-l-o-w on these low specs. Might not be worth it in the end. I cant watch movies beyond say 300MB size without hiccups and you wait for your life to pass while it opens anything. Maybe there are lighter weight versions? Good luck.\n", "Q: scripts in ~/bin don't work when connecting through ssh I have some script in my $HOME/bin folder.\nWhen I access my machine remotely I can't use them and I can't understand\nwhy. They work just fine when I'm in front of my remote computer.\nI think it might have something to do with the .bashrc file. The PATH is set with\nPATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin\nexport PATH\n\nit seems correct to me though.\nI have also tried to copy the file in the /usr/bin folder logging out and in again,\nbut still I can't manage to use my script.\nIf I go in the ~/bin directory and type ./myscript the script work (it is just that I need to run it from different folders where I have some files to process).\n\nA: This is happening because when you log in via SSH, the shell you get is a login shell. In contrast, to use the terminology from the bash documentation, when you open a Terminal window in an already-started graphical login session, the shell you get is still an interactive shell but it is not a login shell.\nFrom man bash:\n\nWhen bash is invoked as an  interactive login shell, or as a\n  non-interactive  shell with the --login option, it first reads and\n  executes commands from the  file  /etc/profile, if that file exists.\n  After reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile,\n  ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and\n  executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable. The\n  --noprofile option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.\nWhen a login shell exits, bash reads and executes commands from the\n  file ~/.bash_logout, if it exists.\nWhen  an  interactive  shell that is not a login shell is started,\n  bash reads and executes commands from  /etc/bash.bashrc and\n  ~/.bashrc, if these files exist. This may be inhibited by using the\n  --norc option. The --rcfile file option will force bash to read and  execute  commands from file instead of /etc/bash.bashrc\n  and ~/.bashrc.\n\nSo you should check if you have any of these files:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/.bash_profile\n\n*~/.bash_login\n\n*~/.profile\nIf you do, then you should edit the first one you find and make it add $HOME/bin to your path. If you don't, create one of them for this purpose. (The best one to create is ~/.profile since other shells will use that too.)\nYou almost certainly have ~/.profile, since Ubuntu's default behavior is to create this with any new user account (including the first account, created when you install Ubuntu).\nHowever, by default this file already contains the necessary lines to add your private bin directory to the $PATH:\n# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nSo it's a bit strange that this is not already working for you.\nDepending on your needs, you might want to make ~/.profile (or ~/.bash_login or ~/.bash_profile) call ~/.bashrc:\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nBut it would be even better to just include lines adding $HOME/bin to your $PATH in ~/.profile (or ~/.bash_login or ~/.bash_profile), but not ~/.bashrc. After all, if you do this for every login shell, it should also happen when you log in graphically, and be inherited by all your interactive shells that aren't login shells.\n\nA: Simply put your config in .bash_profile file in home directory.\nIf you dont have it you can create it.\n", "Q: Step-by-step to run a midi keyboard input device? 12.04 I have a Korg Nanokey, and I'd like to make it produce sound in ubuntu.  I've read that means I should be using Rosegarden, and that Rosegarden uses JACK, but does not install it.  (Although checking out Ubuntu Software Center, apparently some components of JACK are installed by default?)\nI understand there can be a lot of work setting up JACK without it fighting the default sound server.  Can someone give me a step-by-step method for what I need to do to plug in my midi machine and hear music when I press keys as simply as possible (without messing up pulseaudio, ie, so I can still access Skype and ordinary desktop stuff)?  I'm fine installing JACK, but I'd like to sandbox it a little if it has the chance of messing up regular desktop.\nI've looked through a couple resources, but I'm not sure what's outdated, but the following looked helpful...\n\n\n*\n\n*http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1686497\n\n*http://jackaudio.org/pulseaudio_and_jack\n\nA: MIDI on Linux is highly modular and, as a result, initially overwhelming.  It's nice to have a low-complexity solution working before you bother with optimizations, but unfortunately Ubuntu doesn't come with a default working configuration.  Here's the simplest way that I have found...\nsudo apt install qsynth vmpk ## install components\nqsynth & vmpk ## launch\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Qsynth -> Setup -> Sountfonts -> Open : FluidR3_GM.sf2\n\n*Virtual MIDI Piano Keyboard -> Edit -> Connections -> \n\n\n*\n\n*Enable MIDI Thru on MIDI Output : (checked)\n\n*Input MIDI Connection : (Your Controller)\n\n*Output MIDI Connection : FLUID Synth\nAt this point, you should be able to play notes from either your external MIDI controller or from the virtual piano GUI (the GUI works even if you don't have an external controller).\nFrom the Keyboard GUI you can select different instruments (see Program).  From the Qsynth GUI you can manipulate the volume (see Gain) as well as Reverb/Chorus effects.  There is also a Panic button in case the reverb goes off the rails.\nThis was specifically tested on clean install of Ubuntu Studio 18.04, but similar steps worked for Ubuntu MATE 16.04, with a notable automatic configuration difference being that Qsynth -> Setup -> Audio -> Audio Driver defaulted to jack in Ubuntu Studio but to alsa on Ubuntu MATE.\n\nGlitchy static with ALSA [SOLVED]\nOn both 16.04 and 18.04, I have experienced weird static when Qsynth initially starts working with alsa.  This static seems to affect all audio sources, but it somehow works itself out in a minute or two (at least partially).\nI later tried this setup on a less powerful CPU and noticed a similar static that did not seem to resolve over time.  [As an aside, I noticed that this static correlated with the ALSA plug-in [qsynth] line glitching in and out in the Applications tab of Sound Preferences].\nThis led me to play around with some Qsynth Settings, and I found something that seems to solve both static/glitch problems (maybe with a trade-off of a minor latency increase):\n\n\n*\n\n*Qsynth -> Setup -> Audio -> Buffer Size : 128\n\n*Qsynth -> Setup -> Audio -> Buffer Count : 8\nApparently, the CPU can't always keep up with the required burst rate, so a little extra buffering is needed to prevent underruns.  Presumably the are other settings that could also affect this.\n\nvmpk loses its connection to Qsynth when the settings are changed.  The quickest way to experiment with changing settings is to close and restart vmpk to force a reconnect.\n\nAlternative: \"Polyphone\" application (not in Ubuntu repositories)\nI've got my eye on Polyphone as a (nearly) all-in-one solution (essentially a superset of qsynth+vmpk).  Although it isn't in the Ubuntu repositories so far (as of 19.04 Disco), it was easy to build from source on 18.04 (also, there is a pre-built Ubuntu .deb provided).\nThe package doesn't include a default soundfont (it is a soundfont creator/editor), but you can get one with sudo apt install fluid-soundfont-gm (at /usr/share/sounds/sf2/) -- or try downloading from the application's \"Online repository\" (but this may require an account).\nGo to Settings->General->Input/Output and make sure the Audio/MIDI settings are sensible, then open a soundfont and select an instrument under Presets and it should be ready to play music from your MIDI controller, or from the built-in virtual keyboard.\n\nA: I don't know about Rosegarden, but you can run qjackctl from the package manager. Amsynth is an easy little way to make sound midi->jack.\nI don't know how to run jack and pulseaudio at the same time - ie running chrome through jack (looking into it right now, actually).  My experience in 12.04 is easy so far to make sound.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install qjackctl and amsynth from the package manager\n\n*Shut down any web browsers or other pulseaudio things that could be taking the sound hardware\n\n*Start qjackctl (you may have to fiddle with params in settings but I didn't-this time)\n\n*Start Amsynth\n\n*In the ALSA tab of qjackctl (why is it not the midi tab ?!?!) connect your usb midi device (hopefully detected automatically) to Amsynth ...\n\n*Make sure amsynth is connected to the audio out ...\n\n*Play!\n\n\nA: If you just want to get your keyboard to play sound, this is very simple, and you won't need JACK nor Rosegarden for that. These tools are great if you want to record MIDI signal, write notes, and route audio between separate applications, but you don't need that to play sound with your keyborard.\nMy step-by-step would be to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in your MIDI device to your computer. If that's a USB MIDI keyboard, just plug the USB, if it has only MIDI plug, you may want to use a MIDI to USB device.\n\n*Download/Install a synthesizer. There is a large variety of sound synthesing applications for Ubuntu. You may like ZynAddSubFX (really powerful one), FluidSynth or QSynth (support soundfonts), AMSynth, AMS. Make sure to browse Ubuntu Software Center for synthesizer that will grab your interest.\n\n*Launch the synthesizer. Of course it has to be running to produce sound.\n\n*Tell the system to pass data from your keyboard to the synthesizer. You need to create a link between your keyboard and your synthesizer, so that MIDI signal is passed to it. You can either use aconnect tool, or one of it's graphical backends (which are simpler to use), like aconnectgui or kaconnect. While aconnect is installed by default, you can get the other two from Software Center. Once you connect your keyboard, and synthesizer, follow to the final step...\n\n*Press a key on your keyboard. You will hear some sound! If not, make sure if your system sound is not muted, and that our speakers are connected. Also, some synthesizers require you to choose an instrument before they produce any sound.\n\n*Fine tune your synthesizer settings. You will most likely not enjoy the initial sound of the synthesizer. In case of ZynAddSubFX, this will be a plain sine wave, boring! However, you can easily browse a great collection of timbres, and you can customize them fully. All synthesizers provide you lots of customisation, it's worth to spend some time choosing what you like most.\n\n*Proceed to play. Good luck and have fun!\nI have also once written an article on general workflow for music production with external keyboard on Ubuntu, it should be useful in your case.

The 64bit version can only use the server JVM (which still runs the game but slow while textures are enabled) or other JVM that cannot run Runescape.\nLastly your graphic driver will cause issues because it will not be able to utilize OpenGL properly in Runescape. You are instead recommended to use the proprietary driver.\nThere is a community run wiki article that was created by us in the Runescape community tech support team to help Linux users play Runescape at the highest performance as possible.\nThere are even ways to run the Runescape client on Linux (either through Wine or native).

If Firefox is already running, then instead of continuing as a separate instance, the very new instance communicates with the already-running instance, and makes it start a new window, or a new tab. If a URL was specified as a command-line argument to the very new instance of Firefox, it communicates that URL to the already-running instance, so a window or tab is started in the already-running instance, opening a page with the URL you specified. Once this very new second instance has told the original already-running instance what to do, this very new instance terminates, leaving just one instance.\nYou can verify this behavior by starting the first Firefox instance with a URL as a command-line argument (e.g., firefox http://askubuntu.com/q/147059/22949), and then making a new window/tab by running the firefox command again with a different URL (e.g., firefox http://www.google.com). When you examine running processes with ps x, you'll see that the only running firefox instance has the first URL as its command-line argument (because the second command is no longer running).\nIt's often said that you can't run more than one instance of Firefox at a time. It's more accurate to say that you can't run more than one instance of Firefox at a time, for more than a fraction of a second.\nBecause of this behavior, when you invoke a second instance of Firefox from within a shell, that instance terminates almost immediately, giving you another shell prompt like any program that has finished executing.\nAnother commonly used program in Ubuntu that does this is Nautilus (the file browser).\nIt is possible for Firefox to be running but have no windows shown, though typically that should only be able to happen for a short time after quitting all Firefox windows, unless there is a bug. It's possible that this is what was happening when you ran firefox in the Terminal.\nHowever, if Firefox had terminated but not yet been removed from the process table (which is what it means to be a zombie process / defunct process, and which I assume is what you mean by \"ghost process\"), a very new instance of Firefox should be able to recognize this and act like it's the only running instance of Firefox (because it is). If you find that this is not occurring, then you should report this behavior as a bug in the firefox package in Ubuntu (or against Firefox upstream if you're using the upstream distribution of Firefox rather than the version from official Ubuntu packages).\nI don't know how much effort you're willing to put forth to figure out what's going on, but a window manager (compiz) crash shouldn't cause a Firefox window to be hidden, provided that compiz is actually started up again. If this does happen, that's a bug in compiz or firefox.\nIf you can provide the output of ps x | grep -v grep | grep firefox while the problem is occurring--i.e., after finding that running firefox in the Terminal returns you immediately to your shell--that would help greatly in troubleshooting this. You can edit your answer to include this information. You should also clarify if a new Firefox window/tab is opened when you run firefox in the Terminal, or if running it in the Terminal is having no effect.\n", "Q: Change hotkey volume indicator Im using ubuntu 12.04 with gnome shell everything is fine, but I find a bit ugly the image used when I change the sound via fn keys:\nhttp://s15.postimage.org/xn01s5vsb/icon.png\nIs there any way to modify this image or any gnome-shell extension that changes it?\n\nA: It should be using the larger version. Make sure you have gnome-icon-theme-full installed if you're using gnome-shell.\nYou can change the theme you're using in dconf-editor by changing the /org/gnome/desktop/interface/icon-theme entry to be gnome. It looks like you are currently using the Humanity theme (or ubuntu-mono-dark, which is the Ubuntu default), and it does not provide high resolution versions of that icon. The lack of high resolution versions of the icons in any of the Humanity or ubuntu-mono icon themes may be considered a bug, and you should report it in Launchpad.\n", "Q: How can I change an Atheros wireless NIC region (regulatory domain) in Ubuntu?

You can do this with Partition Magic on Windows, or use the Ubuntu installation disc. Ubuntu uses two partitions by default; a small swap partition and an Ext4 partition for everything else. Make sure you only remove partitions that are marked as type swap  Ext4 or ext3 - any NTFS or FAT partitions are for Windows. This removes the Ubuntu data from your computer but leaves the Grub boot-loader.\nYou this need to boot from your Windows CD to remove this. Select the rescue option and run fixmbr.

I've installed Wubi on an SSD on a  Windows 7 x64 system. Wubi and Windows 7 reside on the same ntfs formated drive/partition. How does trim work for this configuration? How do I configure it? Everything I've seen refer to a direct install of Ubuntu on an ext4 formated drive etc.\n\nA: Installing Ubuntu with Wubi creates a container file (root.disk) that occupies the full size you specified on your NTFS Windows partition. As soon as you boot Wubi-Ubuntu, it loop mounts a virtual hard disk within the root.disk container file and boots from it. Note that when you delete files in this virtual hard disk, the free space cannot be seen by Windows TRIM because the root.disk container file still occupies the full specified size.\nThus, TRIM would be only enabled when writing data to root.disk from Windows, but as explained Wubi does not do that. Files are written to this container from Ubuntu. Therefore the TRIM functionality of Windows will have no effect here.\n\nWe can not enable TRIM for write access from Ubuntu booted with Wubi.Source\n\nTherefore you should seriously consider installing Ubuntu as dual boot if possible, if you are running from an SSD.\n", "Q: Why is Lubuntu 12.04 so slow to start up and shut down on my Mac Powerbook G4?

It works, but just barely, with a painfully slow shutdown (about 3 minutes) and an equally painful boot up (5 minutes). Once it boots, applications are reasonably responsive.\nAny ideas or suggestions?\n\nA: Yes, Lubuntu is supposed to be much faster than Ubuntu, but it's just slower.

By default it is ctrl + alt + F#. I have tried making a custom shortcut using Ubuntu's keyboard settings but it only worked while using the graphical interface when i switch back to tty it doesn't work. So I need to figure out how to change the default binding of the ctrl + alt + F# shortcut to make a single key toggle back and forth between two TTYs.\n\nA: There is a command for that chvt.\nchvt command stands for CHange Virtual Terminal. It takes one option which is a number which tells it the virtual terminal to switch to.\nFor example, if you are logged in at the first virtual terminal and you want to switch to the 7th where the xserver usually displays the GUI, then run chvt as follows :\nchvt 7\n\nAnd to return to the 1st virtual terminal, type :\nchvt 1\n\n\nSo all you need to do is add that command to 7 shortcuts and you can switch.\n\nA: EDIT: silly me! Just look into the file /etc/console-setup/remap.inc\nYou will find everything you need in that file. In any case, explanations are given below.\nUnfortunately, \"bind\" will only work with a shell session.\nWhat you need to do is to change the console mappings. You can do that using the program \"loadkeys\" (man loadkeys). First, dump the current mappings to see what the format of the file should look like:\ndumpkeys > default_keys.txt\n\nNote that you need to do that from a text console and not X, so press Ctrl-Alt-F1 first to switch to one!\nHere is an example line from that file:\nalt keycode  59 = Console_1\n\nThat means that the key that generates code 59, pressed with the modifier \"alt\" (defined somewhere else in that file) will generate an \"Console_1\" event -- switching to the virtual console 1. \nHow to find out which key generates which code? Use the program showkey for that. I start the program and press \"F1\":\nkomp $ showkey\nkeycode  59 press\nkeycode  59 release\n\nThe only way to exit this program is to close your eyes and contemplate the nature of Open Source for ten seconds. Or just to refrain touching the keyboard for ten seconds, that works as well. Use this method to find out what line in the keymap file you would need change the key mappings.\nSay, you want to switch to the console 1 using \"ctrl 1\". You will find out that the keycode for 1 is 2. Save the following line to a file called \"myownkeys.txt\":\ncontrol keycode 2 = Console_1\n\nSwitch to a text console (if you haven't done it yet) and run\nsudo loadkeys myownkeys.txt\n\nPresto, Ctrl-1 should move you now to console 1. Add more lines to your files for your shortcuts. If you want to make it permanent, you can [EDIT] modify the file /etc/console-setup/remap.inc\nBy the way, apart from Console_n you also have \"Decr_console\" and \"Incr_Console\" -- switch to console on the left and console on the right, respectively. By default they are bound to alt-left and alt-right.\n\nA: You can use bind to bind a key to some function. Here is what I did:\nbind '\"\\ea\": \". ~/newScript.sh\\n\" '\n\nHere newScript.sh is the file which changes the tty and \\ea means that whenever Alt+A is pressed, the script executes.\nThe contents of newScript.sh are:\n#! /bin/bash\nttyNum=\"$(tty)\"\nttyNum=$(echo ${ttyNum##*y})\nttyNum=$(( (ttyNum +1) % 7))\nchvt $ttyNum\n\nNote that if you want to store the key bindings permanently, you can store them in your `~/.inputrc' file. For more information, you can visit this link: http://www.techrepublic.com/article/find-and-bind-key-sequences-in-bash/5683375\nUpdate:  You can store the bind line in your ~/.bashrc file so that you don't have to do it again.\n", "Q: Move ext4 partition I have an ext4 partition at the end of an hard drive, and want to resize it to the full disk size (the rest of the disk is empty). It's not the root partition, just a data partition, so it's no problem to unmount the partition. The machine has Ubuntu server running, and neither Screen, keyboard, mouse nor optical disk drive attached, so booting a live environment to use this approach would be a bit of a hassle and I'd like to avoid that.\nAnybody know an easy way to do this? For me, this proves to be a far more difficult task than I had anticipated, but let me elaborate:\nOf course the disks partitions were all unmounted during the following operations. \nI first tried via parted: I deleted the first partition which was not needed anymore, then wanted to resize or move the ext4 partition. But parted told me it wasn't able to do so, because of some filesystem features of ext4 (with a weird error message: \"Error: File system has an incompatible feature enabled.  Compatible features are\nhas_journal, dir_index, filetype, sparse_super and large_file.  Use tune2fs or\ndebugfs to remove features.\" - so what are the incompatible features?); what I got from that, and as an answer on comments in another question, it is somehow not possible for parted to change the start of an ext4 partition.\nWhy can gparted, however, seemingly do the trick (see first linked question) but not parted?\nWell, since I had enough space at the start of the drive left (more than the size of the partition to move) I thought I'd try another approach: create a second partition at the front, copy the contents from the one at the back to this one, then delete the old partition and resize the new to the full size. However, this also proved impossible: After creating the partition and copying the contents (via dd if=/dev/sdb2 of=/dev/sdb1), the partition can't be mounted ('missing journal superblock').\nSo at the moment I'm fresh out of ideas. I'll probably copy everything vital to another disk, delete all partitions again and create one big one. I'm wondering that this is such a problem - or am I overlooking the obvious?\n\nA: It is a little bit time consuming, but it can be done if:\nAssuming /dev/sdb1, and that the unallocated space is bigger than the amount of data from /dev/sdb1:\nBefore we start, let's create some mounting point directories in /mnt/:\nmkdir /mnt/old && mkdir /mnt/new\nThe disk now looks like this:\n[(.......UNALLOCATED.........)(xxxx /dev/sdb1 xxxxxx)]\n\n\n*\n\n*e2fsck -f -y -v /dev/sdb1 #just to be sure that it is error free.\n\n*fdisk /dev/sdb\n\n*Press: n p 2 wq  \n\n*mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb2\nNow the disk looks like this:\n\n\n[(xxxxxx /dev/sdb2 xxxxxxxxxx)(xxxx /dev/sdb1 xxxxxx)]\n\n\n*\n\n*mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt/new && mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/old\n\n*mv  /mnt/old/* /mnt/new/ (You will get an error about lost+found, you can ignore it)\n\n*cd / && umount /mnt/old && umount /mnt/new\n\n*cfdisk /dev/sdb\n\n*Delete sdb1\n\n*Choose write\n\n*Delete sdb2\n\n*Choose write\n\n*Create new, choose the whole size available.\n\n*Write and quit.\n\n*e2fsck -f /dev/sdb1\n\n*resize2fs /dev/sdb1 \nNow the disk looks like this:\n\n\n[(xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx /dev/sdb1 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)]  \n\n\n*\n\n*mount /dev/sdb1 /your/mount/point\nFINISHED!\n\nA: Here's how I've done it on headless machines with SSH access only: use VNC and get gparted to do it.

YES, DELETE IT! (I know, it sounds weird, but trust me, the data will remain there, just DON'T USE mkfs.ext4!)\n\n*And recreate it with the size you want.

If you miss this, you will loose the data!\n\n\nresize2fs /dev/sdxY\nWithout giving any other parameters to resize2fs, the filesystem will be extended to the partition's size.\n\nAbout the incompatible features: it is the extents which is used by ext4.\n\nA: First, I would have done as Frantique did, except I would have moved with rsync as it is designed to make copy with all attributes intact. The command mv wouldn't do that.\nBut if I really wanted to do serious work, as I would move stuff anyway, I would have moved the data to a LVM2 volume, as that makes it so easy to manage volumes, disks and partitions in the future. \nAs if you would like to add more space, just add a disk to the volume group. Add, remove or resize partitions, just do that to the logical volume. No need to think about physical layout. To remove data from a disk that is starting to report lots of errors, just add a new disk, and then move data from the faulty one, and then remove the disk from the volume.

The standard packages are out of date, especially for older releases of Ubuntu, so it is probably a good idea to set yourself up to install from the 10gen repositories.\nThe error message you quote suggests that you might have already tried this, since version 2.0.1 is not a standard Ubuntu package. I suggest that first of all, you completely uninstall Mongo and clean up your system. If you have existing data that you want to keep, you could take a backup of it. By default, it is stored in /var/lib/mongodb. So if you want to take a backup, take a copy of the files from there and keep them in a safe place.\nUninstalling existing MongoDB packages\nSince I'm not 100% what you've got installed, I suggest the following to make sure everything is uninstalled:\nsudo apt-get purge mongodb mongodb-clients mongodb-server mongodb-dev\nsudo apt-get purge mongodb-10gen\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nSome of those commands may fail, depending on what packages you actually have installed, but that's okay.\nThis should also remove your config from /etc/mongodb.conf. If you want to completely clean up, you might also want to remove the data directory /var/lib/mongodb, so long as you backed it up or don't want it any more.\nIf you've installed by building from source or using the 10gen binary distributions, then you'll need to manually uninstall and clean up from wherever you put the binary files, config and data files.\nInstalling the 10gen MongoDB packages\nFollow the 10gen instructions for adding their repository:\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 7F0CEB10\n\nEdit /etc/apt/sources.list, delete any lines you have already added for Mongo, and add the following single line (since 11.10 uses upstart) at the end:\ndeb http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/ubuntu-upstart dist 10gen\n\nNote that if you add this repository using the Software Center, it will automatically add a deb-src entry, which will break apt-get. So you will need to edit your sources list by hand to add only the above line.\nThen to install, run:\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get install mongodb-10gen\n\nChecking your install\nInstalling the packages should automatically start up the MongoDB server. So you should be able to run the client from the command line:\nmongo\n\nwhich should successfully connect to the test database. You can quit by typing exit.\nIf that fails, please update your question with further details, including the output of trying to connect and attaching your /var/log/mongodb/mongodb.log file.\n\nA: Follow the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove lock file\nsudo rm /var/lib/mongodb/mongod.lock\n\n\n*Repair mongodb\nmongod --repair\n\n\n*Start mongodb\nsudo service mongodb start\n\n\n*Start mongo console\nmongo\n\n\nA: To completely remove MongoDB from a system, you must remove the MongoDB applications themselves, the configuration files, and any directories containing data and logs. The following section guides you through the necessary steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Stop MongoDB\nStop the mongod process by issuing the following command:\nsudo service mongod stop\n\n\n*Remove Packages\nRemove any MongoDB packages that you had previously installed.\nsudo apt-get purge mongodb-org*\n\n\n*Remove Data Directories.\nRemove MongoDB databases and log files.\nsudo rm -r /var/log/mongodb /var/lib/mongodb\n\n", "Q: Cannot install GNU Fortran compiler due to unresolved dependencies I have a fresh Ubuntu 12.04 install.

There is no other operating system installed. Do I need to install my motherboard drivers too (LAN driver, Audio Driver, Graphics driver)?\nIf yes then where I can get these drivers for \"Intel Desktop Board D865GSA\" that can be installed in Ubuntu 12.04, as the installation files that I am having are in .exe format which I am unable to install in Ubuntu.\n\nA: No, you don't have to use your Windows drivers.\n(Linux based OS-es like Ubuntu doesn't use Microsoft's drivers.)\n\nA: In Ubuntu 12.04, generally all the necessary drivers are installed automatically and there is no need to manually install them. However, sometimes the display driver still needs to be installed manually. You can do this by opening up System Settings... and clicking on Additional Drivers. The application shows you the possible drivers you can install.\nThe real question would be, is there anything that is not functioning properly? If not, then there's no need to worry about manually installing additional drivers.\n\nA: You don't need anything else.\nIf you are experiencing problems with your hardware, you may want to search for proprietary drivers, if available. To do this, go to System Settings and click on Additional Drivers.\n\nA: Your motherboard D865GSA has been discontinued by Intel.\nSince Ubuntu comes with many out-of-the-box drivers and generic drivers; theirs no need to install drivers as such. You many want to install drivers only if some of your motherboard component is not working properly or not being detected.\nYou can have your motherboard's drivers from Intel support page, under the  Discontinued Products > Desktop Boards > 865 Chipset Family > Desktop Board 865GSA\nHere's the Intel support link specifically for your MotherBoard \nunfortunately Intel is having majority windows related drivers, thus you may want to select \"OS Independent\" category.\n\nIf you are not experiencing any problem then you don't need to install\n  any drivers.

I don't exactly remember what I did to get it working but it was enervating. I had to install some old packages not even avaiable for ubuntu (12.04) and in the end I used some stuff from old rpms.\nAnyway the client is more or less working now but I always get a dpkg error when installing or updating something. The (translated) error message is something like:\n\ndpkg: Error while processing icaclient:i386 (--configure): subprocess\n  installed post-installation-script return errorcode 2\n\nI just want to tell dpkg to ignore this or remove this post-install-script but I don't know how.\nThanks!\n\nA: Just install version 12.0 instead of 12.1. It is (still) available on Citrix site (http://www.citrix.com/site/SS/downloads/details.asp?downloadId=2316611&productId=1689163) and works just fine.\nOr you can extract the package:\ndpkg -x icaclient_12.1.0_amd64.deb /some/folder\nmkdir /some/folder/DEBIAN\ndpkg -e icaclient_12.1.0_amd64.deb /some/folder/DEBIAN\nvi /some/folder/DEBIAN/postinst\n\nIn line 2648, change the text between double quotes (\"i[0-9]86\") for \"[0-9,x]86\" an then run the following:\ndpkg -b /some/folder\n\nIt will correct the bug in the postinst script that tries to figure out the architecture of your processor. The 'dpkg -b /some/folder' will then recompile (build) the package. All you need now is to install the recompiled package, which will be named after the folder you used to extract it. I just don't know why Citrix haven't done it yet, for it is a relatively old bug, and with a very simple solution.\nIf you are not interested in doing the dirty job, just download the version I corrected from https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3207848/icaclient_12.1.0_amd64.deb.\nHope I helped!\n\nA: Worked for me as well, but I used the 32bit client on my 64bit system.\nicaclient-12.1.0_i386.deb\n\nProcedure is the same.\n\nA: First, please try the following in terminal:\n\nsudo aptitude update\nsudo aptitude -f install\n\nIf it does not work, then you may want to try:\n\nsudo dpkg --force all --remove\n\nIf these are not helping you than I have bad news.

OTOH, putting on my cynical hat, it wouldn't surprise me too much if such a failure would result in the package uninstalling critical files....\nAnyhow, if your system really is unbootable, my recommendation is to manually install a boot loader using an emergency boot disc. You should be able to get Ubuntu's grub-efi-amd64 package to install via either of at least two methods (using the --root option to dpkg in an emergency boot or by chrooting into your regular system and using dpkg or apt-get in a normal way). Alternatively, you can install any EFI boot loader that you care to try via non-package-manager methods. Typically, you just need to copy a handful of files to the EFI System Partition (ESP) and set up a configuration file or two. There are four major options (in order of reliability, they are the kernel's EFI stub loader in 3.3.0 and later kernels, ELILO, GRUB Legacy, and GRUB 2).

As another suggestion: switching off WLAN before booting might work as well.\n", "Q: Installation never finishes on an old Dell Latitude C400 I am trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 on an old Dell Latitude C400 laptop previously running windows XP using an Ubuntu install CD.\nThe OS runs fine off the CD if a bit slow, and the installation starts off fine. However once the progress bar is filled I get put back to the desktop and nothing happens, first I assumed that the installation was completed but when I restarted the computer and booted from the hard drive nothing happened.\nI tried to install a few more times but the same thing happens.\nAm I doing something wrong? I do not get a error message or a installation complete notification.\nIs there any way I could get some kind of debug screen or log to see if something went wrong or at least follow the installation progress in more detail.\n\nA: The Dell Latitude C400 is a little bit old... Try to install from alternate cd download from here, this is a text based installer.\n\nThe text-based installer is for computers that can’t run the graphical\n  interface-based installer, either because they don’t meet the minimum\n  requirements for the live CD or because they require extra\n  configuration before the graphical desktop can be used.\n\n\nA: Instead of trying to install from the desktop, boot from CD and choose install rather than try Ubuntu. From there you can install the OS without even needing to go to the desktop. \nEDIT: Beat me to the answer ha. Like frantique said you could try the text install.

I am trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 on a home made system with a gigabyte 990Fxa MB.\nI can make it through the install process.\nIt does not boot.\nWindows 7 does boot on the same machine.\nSuse 11.4 boots on the same machine.\nSuse 12.4 does not boot.\nI think there may be an issue with the EFI / GPT system.\nI know very little about these systems. I really expected the machine to boot.\nWhat can I do to get the system to boot?\nPlease direct me to a path to trouble shoot this problem.\nthanks\nJeffrey\n\nA: You'll need to do some troubleshooting of the boot process, beginning with two related questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the computer's firmware attempting to start the boot process in BIOS mode or in EFI mode? (Either is possible on most modern EFI-enabled machines.)\n\n*Did the problem OS(es) install BIOS-mode or EFI-mode boot loaders?\n\n\nBasically, the boot loader installed by the OS must match the boot mode used by the motherboard. If they don't match, the system won't boot. Unfortunately, the EFI specification includes no standardized rules for determining the boot mode used by the computer, so manufacturers have been free to make up their own rules. These manufacturer-specific rules vary from one product to another and are seldom well-documented, so you may end up having to run experiments to figure out how to coax your board into booting in one mode or the other.\nGenerally speaking, if the computer boots Windows 7, the easiest course of action is to install Linux in a way that's compatible -- that is, in EFI mode if Windows is booting in EFI mode, and in BIOS mode if Windows already boots in BIOS mode. You can determine your Windows boot mode in various ways, such as by looking at the partition table -- if Windows is booting from an MBR disk, it's booting in BIOS mode, and if it's booting from a GPT disk, it's booting in EFI mode. See here for more details.\nFortunately, switching the Linux boot mode is usually just a matter of uninstalling the non-functional boot loader installing a suitable boot loader in its place. For Ubuntu, grub-pc is the usual BIOS-mode boot loader and grub-efi is the usual EFI-mode boot loader; but in my experience, GRUB's EFI version is pretty flaky, so I personally prefer to use others. Switching out the Linux boot loader may require using an emergency boot disk. See my Web page on the topic for a more thorough coverage of this topic.\n\nA: Wild guess is that your new mothedoard BIOS support's UEFI.\nWhit EFI / UEFI you have booting point at motherboard memory and\nyou get that easyly lost : \n-After doing FRESH install you must also\nUPDATE starting location to motherboard memory ,you might forget to\ndo that or installation script dose not note that! \n-updateing BIOS will clear out EFI startup info as well.\n-editing EFI BIOS SETTINGS can cause same !!!\nAt Ubuntu 12.4 precise simply BOOT computer WHIT UEFI whit your \nLIVE-CD, RESCUE DISK/STICK/USB and go repair mode.\nYou must get your self loged in / chrooted to your hard disk\nand then reinstall EFI booting information to system memory \nas well update HARDDISK  information as well.\nYou need startup code  (at my system /sda) at starup hardisk loacated at /boot/efi\nand whit my configuration mounting goes like this:\nmount /dev/sda /boot/efi\n\nSo you got mounted booting part needed by grub-efi program to system\nfor reinstallation.\nJust then to update motherboard UEFI memory settings as well\nharddisk whit grub-efi  run:\napt-get install --reinstall grub-efi-amd64\n\nor\napt-get install --reinstall grub-efi\nupdate-grub\n\nThis should do all needed work (memory, harddisk) things and then just reboot!!!\nMORE: http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/UEFI_Firmware https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFIBooting\n\nA: When you make your bootable linux flash drive, make it on a windows computer.

Point 2) is problematic because a user with (apparently) the right permissions can't commit to the repository.\nWhat am I doing wrong in this setup?\n\nA: \nEven though userone is not a member of the myproject group, userone can checkout the whole repository.\n\nThe repositories are probably world-readable. You can change that by running\nsudo chmod -R o-rws /svn/myproject\n\n\n(Is this because userone is member of the sudo group?)\n\nNo, membership of the sudo group just means that you can gain root privileges through sudo. SVN wouldn't take advantage of that. (But, more generally, if a user has root privileges on a machine, they can read anything on it, you can't stop them.)\n\nusertwo is a member of the myproject group, but cannot commit to the repository\n\nWhat probably happened is that userone committed some new files to the repository and they end up owned by him and not writeable by the project group.\nThe usual solution to this is to make all the directories inside the project have the setgid bit set. That will force all files created inside them be owned by the project group.\nsudo chmod -R g+s /svn/myproject\n\nThen you also need to make sure that everyone's umask is set to 002, so that files will be group-writeable by default.\nThis all gets quite complicated, and fragile, so it may be easier to serve the SVN repository via https only.\n", "Q: how to re install ubuntu on the fedora partition I have a windows 7 partition of 200 GB.\nI have currently installed Fedora 16 on the remaining 30 GB partition and now want to install Ubuntu 12.04 on the 30 GB partition. \nHelp me how to do so.

I have installed MS Office 2010 on Ubuntu 12.04 using PlayonLinux. Now to open a .docx file I have to first open Word and then use open to open the file I want. When I double click on the file it opens with LibreOffice instead. \nSo how can I set Word as the default application? Word also doesn't show up in the application list. \n\nA: First of all, you need to have PlayOnLinux 4.1.1 (It won't work with 4.0.x)\nTo upgrade PlayonLinux to latest version, go to this link : http://www.playonlinux.com/en/download.html\nChoose ubuntu, and follow the instructions regarding your distribution.\nThen go to PlayOnLinux options -> File associations (.docx -> Microsoft Word 2010)\nYou need to enter separately each file type (xls,xlsx,dox,docx) and to associate it with the corresponding office program.\nThen, tell Ubuntu to open .docx files with playonlinux. (you can do this by the usual icon right click)\nIf you want to make the opening of office files permanent, with MS Office, you should right click on a .doc, .docx,... and go to properties-> open with-> playonlinux set as default. You have to do this separately for each file type.\n\nA: Solution\nVisit: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1940522\nBY: forrestcupp\nPreface: This is a howto, not a question.\nToday, after beating my brains out trying to install Office 2007 with Wine 1.4 in Precise, I ended up resorting to using PlayOnLinux. What I learned about PlayOnLinux is that it makes installing things a dream, but it makes the general usability of those things an absolute nightmare. When I had Office 2007 installed with Wine, I could easily set filetype associations in Nautilus to Word and Excel. When I installed Office 2007 in PlayOnLinux, it didn't leave any way to associate filetypes. Also, PlayOnLinux created nice shortcuts to the apps on the desktop, but it didn't create any gnome-desktop launchers that will show up in Dash in Unity or Gnome Shell.\nAfter a lot of hard work and headaches, I finally figured out how to do both of those things, so I thought I would share that experience for future reference, and for anyone else who might need it.\nWhen you are preparing to do this, be aware that you will have to create two separate .desktop files for each Office program (Word, Excel, etc.). The first section creates a .desktop file so that a new instance of Word can be launched from the Dash. The second section creates a second .desktop file for associating file types.\nCreating a .desktop launcher file\nThis creates a .desktop file so that a new instance your Office programs can be launched from Dash.\nOpen a terminal, and enter this command:\nCode:\ngnome-desktop-item-edit ~/.local/share/applications/ --create-new\n\nIn the window that comes up, first enter a name for your launcher. For Microsoft Word, we'll enter Microsoft Word as the name. Then in the \"Command\" box, for Word 2007, we'll enter this code\nCode:\nplayonlinux --run \"Microsoft Word 2007\"\n\nFor Excel 2007, you would enter \"Microsoft Excel 2007\" leaving the quotes in it. For anything else, you just would put whatever app name shows up in the PlayOnLinux window, and put that name in quotes. After this, you can click on the icon and use the file browser to point it to whatever icon you want to use for that launcher.\nAfter doing this, your app launcher should show up by doing a Dash search.\nAssociating files with MS Office that was installed with PlayOnLinux\nThis creates a second .desktop file for associating your file types.\nStep 1 - creating a .desktop launcher for association\nSince PlayOnLinux installed apps don't show up in the \"Open With\" dialog in Nautilus, you have to create a custom command for Nautilus. This used to be easy to do with the GUI, but since they changed to Gnome 3 in 11.10, you can't do that anymore. Never fear, that's why we have the command line. Open a terminal, and cd to a folder that has a .doc or .docx file. Once you're in that folder, note the name of your Word document file, and type:\nCode:\nmimeopen -d filename.doc\n\nOf course you would type .docx if that's what type of file it is. When you type this, it will give you options of what you want the default app to be for that file. Enter whatever number says \"Other\" so that you can enter a custom command. For that custom command, enter the following for Word 2007:\nCode:\nplayonlinux --run \"Microsoft Word 2007\" z:%f\n\nNote, that it will try to open the file with Word, and at this point it will not work. By the time you're done, it will work properly when you double click it in Nautilus.\nNow open up Nautilus, press Ctrl+H if hidden files aren't showing, and navigate to ~/.local/share/applications and find the .desktop launcher file with something like \"playonlinux_userdefined\" in the name. Change that name to something like Word.desktop. Now you can right-click on a .doc or .docx file, go to Properties, and go to the \"Open With\" tab, click \"Show Other Applications\" and find \"Word.desktop\" in the list. Now, that filetype is associated with Word, and you can go through all of those steps again substituting the right names for Excel and Powerpoint.\nStep 2 - making it work properly\nUnfortunately, what you just did won't work if there are spaces in the file or folder names. But we can fix that, too.\nOpen Nautilus and navigate to ~/.PlayOnLinux/shortcuts. Double click on each of the shortcuts that were made for Word, Excel, and Powerpoint, and choose to Display the file in Gedit. At the end of the script, you should find this code:\nCode:\n$@\n\nChange that code for the following code in each shortcut script, and save the files.\nCode:\n\"$(echo \"$@\" | sed -e 's:/*/:\\\\:g')\"\n\nMake sure you leave the quotes in. That code will take the path and filename and convert any spaces to be readable by Word, Excel, or Powerpoint when you open the file.\nSince both desktop files will show up in a Dash search, I suggest not assigning an icon to this one to prevent confusion.\nNow, you should be able to navigate to any MS Office file in Nautilus, double click on it, and it will open properly.\nI'm not an expert, and this is just the findings of my experience. Hopefully it works for you, too.\nEdit: I found all of this information scattered all over the net, but I need to give credit to wojox for helping me fix a problem with the bash code I found for the shortcut script.\n\nToday you are You, that is truer than true.

Once Office2007 has been installed, it will place Icons for Word, Excel and Powerpoint on the desktop. These are *.desktop files. They also need to be in folders that nautilus recognizes as associations:\ncp ~/Desktop/Microsoft\\ *.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/\n\nNow I can right-click on a file, select Properties, \"Open With\" tab, click on \"Microsoft Word 2007\" and then the \"Set as default\" button. From now on, opening such a file opens it in word. Bingo!\nRunning on Ubuntu 14.04 with playonlinux 4.2.2-1\nA little unrelated, but one more thing that was missing from my new Office 2007 installation, is that typing :-)<TAB> gets replaced with a tiny square instead of the smiley character that it should be. That is because the WINGDING.TTF font file is missing. The original from Microsoft is copyrighted, but you can use a free version:\ncp ~/Downloads/wingding.ttf ~/.PlayOnLinux/wineprefix/Office2007/drive_c/windows/Fonts/\n\n\nA: Right click on the docx document and choose the option Open with different application... (or similar).\nEdit: You can try this with other document types too.\n\nA: In Dolphin (KDE4) you can rightclick -> properties on any docx-file.\nYou should see \"Type: Microsoft Word Document\"\nOn the very right side should be a small icon (wrench) you can press and change order of programms to open this with, or add new entries.\nOn my system (Office 2010 Pro, wine 1.5.14) I had three entries:\nLibreOffice Writer|Microsoft Word|Ark\nChanged it to:\nMicrosoft Word|LibreOffice Writer|Ark\nNow doubleclick works. docx opens with Word 2010\n\nA: Many thanks, it works fine and it is really fantastic.\nJust a little update for the shortcut script to make it work perfectly :\n$(echo \"$@\" | sed -e 's:/*/:\\\\\\:g')\n\ninstead of $(echo \"$@\" | sed -e 's:/*/:\\:g')\n.\n\nA: I install it through Wine Windows Program Loader rather than Playonlinux. I used Playonlinux  for games.\n.\nYou can double click it or right click and have easy access to the Microsoft Office Document.\n\nBut I recommend to you to used Libre Office which is default of Ubuntu and it's easier to use and have plenty nice feature compared to Microsoft Office. Have a Nice day! Thanks.\n\nA: Another great option is to right click on the file you would like to open and then click on \"PlayOnLinux\".\nEnsure the file associations in PLAYONLINUX are correctly set.\n", "Q: How to repair a corrupted FAT32 file system I'm using the FAT32 file system for my pen drive.

If that command takes too much time for you, avoid -t switch.\n\n\n*\n\n*-w means write to disk immediately. \n\n*-r means to do disk check interactively (ask you what to do to when encountering errors). On newer versions of dosfsck this is the default.\n\n*-l means to list the filenames processed.\n\n*-a means automatically fix errors. Do not use it, if You want to have more control over fixing possible errors.\n\n*-v means verbose mode. Generates slightly more output.\n\n*-t means mark unreadable clusters as bad.\n\n\nIf you want to be sure not to lose your data, create a backup of the source device first.\n\nA: dosfsck cheatsheet\nThese examples will use FAT32 and /dev/sdc1\nfsck.vfat -n /dev/sdc1 \n- a simple non-interactive read-only check\nfsck.vfat -a /dev/sdc1 \n- checks the file system and fixes non-interactively.

However something which is present in B and NOT in A \"\"shall NOT be copied to A\"\".\nIn a nutshell, the backup folder may copy everything from the source folder, however nothing should be copied form backup folder to the source.\n\nA: I always found Unison to be very helpful.  It has a text based or GUI based interface, and quite a few different options to tweak it to what you want (with a little fiddling).  It takes quite a bit of time to do the first sync, but after that it's brilliant.  You can make it sync one-way, as you want, but it will pretty much get that automatically.  It can also delete from the backup or not as you choose.\nYou also may find issues with permissions which are supported in the ubuntu file format, but maybe not in the external hard drive (depending whether the external hard drive is going to be used in a windows machine, this may be a good thing), so you'll want to sync without the permissions potentially.\nAnyway, the nice thing is that with the tutorial it's relatively straightforward to set it up once, and thereafter it's a GUI interface whenever you want to do it.\nHere's some info about it:\nhttp://www.ubuntugeek.com/unison-file-synchronization-tool.html\nAnd here's the tutorial:\nhttp://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/download/releases/stable/unison-manual.html#tutorial\n\nA: Sounds like a perfect task for rsync\nsudo rsync -az /path_to/A /path_to/B\n\n\n-a archive mode (implies recursive, copy symlinks as symlinks, preserve owner, modification times, group, owner, special and device files)\n-z compresses the data\n\nIf you wish to remove files deleted in A from files in B, use the --delete option \nFor additional information see:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/rsync\nYou can run rsync from cron\nsudo crontab -e\n\nAdd in an hourly task\n@hourly rsync /path_to/A /path_to/B\n\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto\n\nA: rsync -avPr --ignore-existing /home/username/Research/ /path/to/other/folder/on/hdd/\n\nThis will sync and copy only that data that doesn't exist in the /other/folder/on/hdd/\n\nA: I agree with the other answers, you can use in rsync in Terminal or the interfaces Grsync, luckyBackup, Conduit or the famous Unison.\nAnother great app is Krusader (a Twin-Panel File Manager for KDE), in the Tools menu you can find \"Syncronize Directories\", is very useful.\nIn last instance you can install Wine and install another great twin-pane file manager like Total Commander.\nAnyway you have plenty of options and all of them are present in the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\nA: I'd suggest using rsync for this purpose.  Rsync is extremely fast, stable, and versatile.  There's a good introduction at http://help.ubuntu.com/community/rsync\nIf you wish, there is an optional graphic front end:  grsync\n sudo rsync -azv --exclude 'dir1' /home/path/folderA/ /home/path/folderB\n\nThe command above will copy from folderA to folderB excluding dir1.  The flags are\n-a preserves time stamps\n-z is to enable compression\n-v verbose\n\nThere are many more options available.\n\nA: I would recommend Conduit for simple synchronization. It's available the software system. It does exactly what you are looking for\n\nA: There is a quite handy shell tool called rsnapshot - http://www.rsnapshot.org/ -  filesystem snapshot utility for making backups of local and remote systems. that uses rsync and hard links which makes it possible to keep multiple, full file system backups instantly available. Just do sudo apt-get install rsnapshot and check info rsnapshot\n\nA: If you want a graphical interface on a system that is highly configurable, give FreeFileSync a try.  See, for example:  http://linuxnorth.wordpress.com/2011/11/29/file-and-folder-synchronization/  In particular, you want the \"Update\" option for synchronization that will \"Copy new or updated files to right folder\", i.e. copy from the left folder to the right folder in a two-window display.\n\nA: You can sync files inside two direcotries by:\nrsync -rv /path/to/directory1/ /path/to/directory2\n\nDoing rsync -rv /path/to/directory1 /path/to/directory2 will create directory1 inside directory2, like this /path/to/directory2/directory1/[files]\nYou can dry run using -n switch, like this rsync -rnv /path/to/directory1/ /path/to/directory2\nReference: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-rsync-to-sync-local-and-remote-directories-on-a-vps\n", "Q: Execute sudo without Password?

That will give you a shell that will be authenticated as root until you exit it.\n\nA: You can configure sudo to never ask for your password.\nOpen a Terminal window and type:\nsudo visudo\n\nIn the bottom of the file, add the following line:\n$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nWhere $USER is your username on your system.\nSave and close the sudoers file (if you haven't changed your default terminal editor (you'll know if you have), press Ctl + x to exit nano and it'll prompt you to save).\nAs of Ubuntu 19.04, the file should now look something like\n#\n# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.\n#\n# Please consider adding local content in /etc/sudoers.d/ instead of\n# directly modifying this file.\n#\n# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.\n#\nDefaults    env_reset\nDefaults    mail_badpass\nDefaults    secure_path=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin\"\n\n# Host alias specification\n\n# User alias specification\n\n# Cmnd alias specification\n\n# User privilege specification\nroot    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges\n%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\n# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n# See sudoers(5) for more information on \"#include\" directives:\n\n#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\n\nYOUR_USERNAME_HERE ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nAfter this you can type sudo <whatever you want> in a Terminal window without being prompted for the password.\nThis only applies, to using the sudo command in the terminal. You'll still be prompted for your password if you (for example) try to install a package from the software center\n\n\nA: Nice one-liner to remove sudo prompts for the current user\nsudo bash -c 'echo \"$(logname) ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\" | (EDITOR=\"tee -a\" visudo)'\n\n\nA: From Super User comes a good answer:\nUse the -S switch which reads the password from STDIN:\necho <password> | sudo -S <command>\n\nReplace <password> with your password.\n\nA: This is a one line solution that also changes files permissions as stated in /etc/sudoers.d/README:\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"$(logname) ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\" > /etc/sudoers.d/$(logname)' && sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/$(logname)\n\n\nA: The preferred way to grant individual (or group) permissions would be to add files under /etc/sudoers.d\nThis separates local changes from the default policy and saves time in case the distribution sudoers file changes.\nTo make the currently logged in user a a sudoer and make sudo not prompt them for a password, use\necho \"$USER ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/$USER\n\nthis will create a file called /etc/sudoers.d/$USER (where $USER is the username of the user that you were logged in as when you ran that command), making it clear which users are granted permission.\nIf you want to do that for a different user, just replace both instances of $USER with some other username in the above command.\necho \"otheruser ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/otheruser\n\nSimilarly, one file can be used to manage multiple directives:\necho \"username ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\" | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers.d/local\n\nSee /etc/sudoers.d/README and man sudoers for more information.\n\nA: One liner\nsudo sed -i /etc/sudoers -re 's/^%sudo.*/%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL/g'\n\nA: Root sudo timeouts are the easiest and safest way of doing this. I'll lay out all examples but be warned it is very risky any way you do this although this way is much safer:\nsudo visudo\n\nThis opens an editor and points it to the sudoers file -- Ubuntu defaults to nano, other systems use Vi. You're now a super user editing one of the most important files on your system. No stress!\n(Vi specific instructions noted with (vi!). Ignore these if you're using nano.)\nUse the arrow keys to move to the end of the Defaults line.\n(vi!) press the A (capital \"a\") key to move at the end of the current line and enter editing mode (append after the last character on the line).\nNow type:\n,timestamp_timeout=X\n\nwhere X is the timeout expiration in minutes. If you specify 0 you will always be asked the password. If you specify a negative value, the timeout will never expire. E.g. Defaults env_reset,timestamp_timeout=5.\n(vi!) hit Escape to return to command mode. Now, if you're happy with your editing, type in :w Enter to write the file and :q Enter to exit vi. If you made a mistake, perhaps the easiest way is to redo from start, to exit without saving (hit Escape to enter the command mode) and then type :q! Enter.\nHit Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter to save your file and exit nano.\nYou might want to read the sudoers and vi manual pages for additional information.\nman sudoers\nman vi\n\nReset timeout value using:\nsudo -k\n\nThese instructions are to remove the prompt for a password when using the sudo command. The sudo command will still need to be used for root access though.\nEdit the sudoers file\nOpen a Terminal window. Type in sudo visudo. Add the following line to the END of the file (if not at the end it can be nullified by later entries):\n<username> ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nReplace <username> with your username (without the <>). This is assuming that Ubuntu has created a group with the same name as your user name, which is typical. You can alternately use the group users or any other such group you are in. Just make sure you are in that group. This can be checked by going to System -> Administration -> Users and Groups.\nExample:\nmichael ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nType in ^X (Ctrl+X) to exit. This should prompt for an option to save the file, type in Y to save.\nLog out, and then log back in. This should now allow you to run the sudo command without being prompted for a password.\nThe root account\nEnabling the root account\nEnabling the root account is rarely necessary. Almost everything you need to do as administrator of an Ubuntu system can be done via sudo or gksudo. If you really need a persistent root login, the best alternative is to simulate a Root login shell using the following command:\nsudo -i\n\nHowever, if you must enable root logins, you can do it like this:\nsudo passwd root\n\nRe-disabling your root account\nIf for some reason you have enabled your root account and wish to disable it again, use the following command in the terminal:\nsudo passwd -dl root\n\nSystem-wide group sudo\nroot$ echo \"%sudo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\" >> /etc/sudoers\n\nLog out, and then back in.\nReset sudo timeout\nYou can make sure sudo asks for password next time by running:\nsudo -k\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Expanding on @upteryx idea.\n\n*This is how I've implemented the non-root, passwordless user in an ephemeral Docker Image for use in a CICD pipeline:\nRUN \\\n    groupadd -g 999 foo && useradd -u 999 -g foo -G sudo -m -s /bin/bash foo && \\\n    sed -i /etc/sudoers -re 's/^%sudo.*/%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL/g' && \\\n    sed -i /etc/sudoers -re 's/^root.*/root ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL/g' && \\\n    sed -i /etc/sudoers -re 's/^#includedir.*/## **Removed the include directive** ##\"/g' && \\\n    echo \"foo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\" >> /etc/sudoers && \\\n    echo \"Customized the sudoers file for passwordless access to the foo user!\" && \\\n    echo \"foo user:\";  su - foo -c id\n\n\nA: To never prompt the current user for a password when that user uses sudo run this command:\necho \"$USER ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/dont-prompt-$USER-for-sudo-password\n\n\nA: Open sudo config:\nsudo visudo\n\nadd following line:\n# Defaults specification \nDefaults:username  !authenticate\n\nwhere username is your usesrname.\n\nA: sudo -i is the way to go if you don't want to be typing a password every 10 mins while doing modifications in your system (or other systems), and you don't want to modify any system files.\nIt will switch you to root using your sudo user password, when you close the console or type exit you are back to your normal user.\n", "Q: Upgrading process terminated! How to fix it? I yesterday started upgrade from Ubuntu 11.10 to Ubuntu 12.04 and i terminated it just when it was installing packages (don't ask me why). Today when i tried to repeat procedure when i turned on update manager it pop out a warning box which says \"Not all upgrades can be installed\" and has some buttons on it. One of those is \"Partial upgrade\", and when i click it it starts some window which says \"Can not upgrade, an upgrade from 'precise' do 'oneiric' is not supported with this tool\" (before that it asks me for my password)  . How can i now upgrade to Ubuntu 12.04 without reinstalling entire Ubuntu ?\n\nA: Run sudo apt-get -f install first. After that, try sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.\n", "Q: Wired connection problem I've recently been updating from Lynx and am currently at 11.10\nHowever when I restarted the computer I couldn't get any wired connection (which is what I use). When I click at the top it just says that the connection is disconnected, which it isn't ... I'm a bit of a newbie at Ubuntu so I may have missed something obvious but if any of you guys could help that would be great! :D\nEdit: My ifconfig result is\nLink evaluate: local loopback\nInet addr:127.0.0.1 Scope:Host\nUp Loopback Running MTU :16436 Metric:1\nRX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\nTX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\nCollisions:0 txqueuelen:0\nRX bytes:0 (0.0 B) TX bytes (0.0 B)\n\nI've checked the cable and that is definately working. I also get Usage: dmesg [-c] [-n level] [-r] [-s bufsize]\n\nA: \nEasy route:\n\nUse sudo dhclient and hope your DHCP server assigns an IP address, default gateway, and name servers (DNS).\n\nLong route:\n\nifconfig on it's own only display configured network cards. It seems for now your network card is unconfigured and you are viewing your loopback adapter which is a default adaptor that should always be there.\nTry ifconfig -a. This will display all cards available and the ethernet interface id for those cards. Look for something like eth0 or eth1.\nTo quickly configure a card, do something like this:\nsudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.2.\nOf course eth0 is dependant on the result of your ifconfig -a and the IP address is dependant on your environment.\nThis will bring your machine online. Now you can hopefully ping your default gateway.\nTo assign your default gateway do this:\nsudo route add default gw 192.168.0.1\nAgain the IP 192.168.0.1 is dependant on your environment. If you have a Windows machine you can do ipconfig -all to get most of the required information.\nNow you can hopefully ping the Internet, but you won't be able to resolve names. So you can ping 196.25.1.1 but not ping www.google.com. For that you have to assign a DNS server. To do this:\nEdit /etc/resolv.conf\nI use mc -e (Midnight Commander) but you might prefer to use vi which is built into most Unix systems.\nAdd the following to resolv.conf:\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\nand save. Now you should be able to ping the Internet and get online using a browser. You are temporarily using Google's public name server at 8.8.8.8.\nAt this point we normally install Webmin :-) http://www.webmin.com/\nWebmin makes is 10x easier to configure and check network cards. In Webmin, use the Networking / Network Configuration and then:\nNetwork Interfaces (IP address)\nRouting and Gateways (Default gateway)\nHostname and DNS Client (DNS servers)\nmenus to configure your card.\n\nChecking /etc/network/interfaces\n\nYou might also want to check /etc/network/interfaces because that is where the resultant configuration information is stored. On a DHCP enabled machine you have something like this:\nuser@computer:~$ cat /etc/network/interfaces\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nOn a fixed IP machine you will have values like this (depends on environment):\nuser@computer2:~# cat /etc/network/interfaces\n# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system\n# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).\n\n# The auto command\nauto lo eth1\n\n# The loopback network interface\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# The rest\niface eth1 inet static\n    address 192.168.0.2\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    broadcast 192.168.0.255\n    network 192.168.0.0\n    gateway 192.168.0.1\n\nPlease note the above file contains just the IP address and default gateway.\nThe sum of our solution is to get the IP address, default gateway, and DNS servers (in /etc/resolv.conf) right. Good luck, this can sometimes be a bit of a nightmare if it doesn't work right out the box / upgrade.\n\nA: he way I fixed mine (same prob)was to go to 'Edit Connection's change the \"Connection name\"\nto Auto(eth0)-MTU:is Automaic(DHCP)-Tick both \"Require IP4 addressing for this connection to complete,and \"Available to all users\"\nIP v6 Settings: Should be \"Ignore\", and also tick \"Available to all users\"\n", "Q: WinRAR installation on Ubuntu How can I install WinRAR on my Ubuntu 10.04 system?

Namely AVR.\nI installed the tool chain all right. It includes: avrdude binutils-avr gcc-avr avr-libc gdb-avr.\nTo test my connection to the micro-controller I used an olimex avr-usb-jtag programmer. When I plug it in and it is seen as /dev/ttyUSB0 (being an FTDI usb-com chip). The programmer is Atmel JTAGICE compatible.\nNow when we try to \navrdude -p c128 -c jtag1 -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -t\n\nAnd we get\navrdude: ser_open(): can't open device \"/dev/ttyUSB0\": Permission denied\n\nSo far it seems that without root's permissions we can't write nor read from the device.

I use ubuntu 12.04 with unity, I want to map may own hot key in order to quick launcher, for example, I can  run ctrl+alt+t to run terminal, can I run ctrl+e to launch emacs?\n\nA: Under All Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts you can define them.\nWhen you add a new shortcut, in the upper input box write the name for it (ex. This is an editor), in the input box below enter the command to start the desired program (ex. gedit), then press Apply (I think,  I am not on English locale, sorry...). After that SELECT the newly added row from the list. You will see that Disabled is changing to  New shortcut... Press your desired combination, and you will see it in your list afterwards.\n\nA: Install Autokey-Qt, it is an amazing automation tool. It can launch programs, send keystrokes, execute scripts. Quite amazing, really.\nEdit: Seems that Autokey prefers not to be a program launcher. As I am quite the Super+ program launcher fiend, I also ran into lots of problems adapting to 12.04 and Unity. Ultimately, this post's answer got it working for me. One of the big problems is having to avoid Unity's built in mappings. It would seem they always \"fire\" regardless of any other setting. \nSadly, the built in System Settings-> Keyboard -> Shortcuts tool does little.

Is there an existing GUI for connecting to OpenVPN or am I expected to go through the terminal and be knowledgeable about certain commands? I hope you can help me out! :)\n\nA: You can use the Network Manager applet to configure VPN connections. You need to install the openvpn plugin first.\nEither from the command-line:\nsudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn network-manager-openvpn-gnome\n\nOr through the software center (search for network-manager-openvpn-gnome).\nThen, your network applet menu will let you configure VPN connections. It will have an additional \"VPN Connections\" menu, with a submenu to \"Configure VPN...\". From there, you can import your existing .ovpn file, enter the location of your key and certificate files, enter the key password, etc.\nDepending on your vpn server configuration and your needs, you may also want to:\n\n\n*\n\n*define special DNS servers ?\n\n*check \"Use this connection only for resources on it's network\" ?\n\n*etc.\n\n\nA: There are excellent resources available, read this and this.\nFor a gui client you could try GOpenVPN or hamachi or gvpnc.

In nautilus and Unity the external drive has a nice short descriptive name \"mcat\", but all partitions on the 4 internal drives are displayed as a size (834 GB filesystem) or a huge 32-character string form of a GUID:\nI'm guessing the external drive is nice, short, sweet and readable because that drive may have no partitions (well, just one I guess) and that name may be the drive label, whereas partitions usually don't have names.

I don't want to install additional software (e.g. Gparted) and backup my system.\nWhen I used the accepted answer here I got this error: Cannot change label on mounted device of type filesystem:ntfs. (udisks-error-quark, 11). I found a turnaround here: https://askubuntu.com/a/1003648/402539 which simply says:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unmount the drive.\n\n*Rename it (as above, in the accepted answer here).\n\n*Re-mount it back.\n\n\nA: The simplest way for me was to set a label in GParted and then in Disks -> Mount Options just to set Identify as and to choose LABEL instead of UUID. And so mounted point has a readable name instead of long string of chars and numbers. That's it! Here some images and my problem explained. How to change mounted HDD UUID to human-readable? \n", "Q: How to improve Ubuntu performance on netbook Most recent Ubuntu 12.04 seems to be quite nice and Unity (3D/2D) works fine for me, however not on my old Acer Aspire One any more. \nThere was a times, when I switched from Windows XP to Ubuntu and was happy about system looks, effects and speed... now I attend to think that XP was really great comparing with 12.04.\nI have found similar questions here but no reasonable answer: how to lower CPU usage for Unity (3D/2D) and memory consumption for Ubuntu 12.04.\nWith new interface I could not find how to disable background services...\nIt's Linux, it's should be the way to optimize without buying new PC... Please share your recipe! \n\nA: I know this is an old question, but I had similar problems on my Samsung netbook and maybe the described steps will be useful to someone. \nMy netbook is an old machine and Ubuntu 12.04 was too slow to be useful. I tried several tweaks, which improved things, but not enough.\nI didn't feel like replacing Ubuntu with Lubuntu and then installing all the software that I like in Ubuntu. \nSo I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*installed the lxde core desktop - this installs the desktop, but not all the other software - I used these instructions: http://complete-concrete-concise.com/ubuntu-2/ubuntu-12-04/ubuntu-12-04-how-to-install-the-lxde-core-desktop\n\n*installed lxterminal (so that I can start the terminal with ctrl+alt+t shortcut, there is a way to map the shortcut to point at the Ubuntu terminal, but I found this solution to be simpler)\n\n*installed \"synaptic package manager\" (it's much faster then Ubuntu software center)\n\n*installed \"synapse\" as the launcher, so I can use it instead of the searching in dash\n\n*moved the window close, maximise and minimise buttons to the left according to the instructions here: http://www.lubuntutips.com/2012/07/moving-close-maximize-and-minimize.html#.UI09auBuHXY\nI really like Unity and I use it on my desktop computer. And while the above doesn't allow you to use some cool features such as the global menu and HUD, I find it's a very good compromise. Everything now works really, really fast.\n\nA: First thing to do to lower memory consumption is to stop using applications that are memory hogs. The applications that I had to switch away from were Banshee, Evolution, Liferea, and Tomboy. The applications which I switched to respectively were Rhythmbox, Thunderbird, Google Reader and none (graduated from school so no longer need a note taking application).\nSecond thing to do is to make Firefox more friendly. In Preferences » General uncheck the Don't load tabs until selected checkbox and set the When Firefox starts option to Show my windows and tabs from last time. Whenever my computer gets slow, I close Firefox and re-open it which causes all tabs to not be loaded except for the one that I am currently using. If you have flash installed then the Flashblock plugin is necessary. Firefox tabs in the background that are using flash are very demanding and Flashblock helps you stay aware when Flash is in use. AdBlock will also help keep Firefox more resource friendly if you are desperate.\nThat is all the advice that I have for you. I have found the Unity 3D interface to be very usable on my older netbook (Intel Atom N270 with GMA 950). My computer does get slow at times but that is almost exclusively a Firefox problem but I tend to open up a lot of tabs so that is easily fixed.\n\nA: You can try zRamswap which is a program that create a compressed RAM block and make it act as a swap disk. Basically, this program increase performances by using a small amount of RAM as a swap area (instead of swap disk which is slow compared to RAM).\nYou can install this program by adding this ppa to your software sources:\n sudo apt-add-repository ppa:shnatsel/zram\n sudo apt-get update\n sudo apt-get install zramswap-enabler\n\n\nA: I would install Lubuntu or Xubuntu as it has lower requirements. In a terminal, execute:\nsudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\nor \nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nI personally use Lubuntu, but you can use either.\n\nA: I am using a pretty smooth 14.04 on my samsung nc10 plus. maybe it will help you out on 12.04 too:\nFirst of all i deactivated the effects in unity using unity tweak tool and compiz config:\nsudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nI also set the swap usage to a more reasonable level:\nopen sysctl.conf gksudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf and add vm.swappiness=10 to the file, then reboot.\nLast of all I deleted all unity-lenses exept the applicaion- and the files-lense:\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge unity-lens-music unity-lens-video unity-lens-photos unity-lens-gwibber unity-lens-shopping \n\nAfter doing that, my netbook runs pretty smooth and good runing unity. If you are only concerned abou the look, try installing the gnome flashback session:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-session-flashback\n\nThat's all I can do to provide some help. Cheers.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 doesn't resume after install nvidia drivers I've install the nvidia drivers from the \"Additional drivers\" menu in the settings,\nand when I try to resume from suspend, I get black screen and I have to reboot for solve it. \nHow can I fix it? It's very important to me, Thanks!!\n\nA: This may not be the source of your issue but I would wager that it is.\nFor older cards sometimes the nvidia_current driver doesn't work very well. \nOn Oneiric there was packages for the 173 and 96 branch of nvidia driver, however when precise was released the nvidia driver for the 127 and 96 branches wasn't released, nvidia have since published an updated 173 driver, but it has not been packaged.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers-173/+bug/948053\nAs you can see it has been assigned now and looks like it will be probably packaged shortly.\nIn the mean time you can either use the nouveau drivers or build the driver by executing this .run file ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/173.14.35/ the problem with doing that though is that kernel updates will mean you have to rebuild the driver.\nOr do what I did and get fed up and buy a new nvidia card, my reasoning is with using that old card I'll probably get hit with this crap again in October...\nI will never understand why X.org gets revved every Ubuntu release with all the inevitable driver issues...\n\nA: Try to install nvidia drivers from X-Swat repo:\n\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\n\nA: First of all, uninstall the current driver via Additional drivers.\nThen select and activate another driver. If you were using Recommended driver use instead Post-release update driver. You wont have problems because Nvidia is more supported than AMD.\n\nA: the x-swat install worked in conjunction with the script mentioned in \nSuspend not properly working with ASUS. - the full script solution is in answer 1.  Now wakeup from suspend works perfectly.  Xorg is very temperamental and was the source of much frustration for me until I was able to cede control to the Debian developers a few years ago.\n", "Q: matlab 2012a install on ubuntu 12.04 64 bit cant specify license file [EDIT] The bug/error was the person sitting in front of my computer.. me.. Go to a more relevant question.. \nDuring installation of matlab 2012a I need to specify my license file but even though I mark the ratio button saying I have the file installation key for my license I'm not able to type any text into the text field.\nSince everything else is working I suspect that it is Java or the fact that my Ubuntu is 64 bit that causes the problem.. So it might not be directly matlab related.\njava -version says:\njava version \"1.6.0_24\"\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.11.1) (6b24-1.11.1-4ubuntu3)\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.0-b12, mixed mode)\n\nAnybody having any suggestions?\n\nA: Ok.. Just to get something out of this.. If you find yourself unable to input the key during matlab install then beware that the input field only allow numbers so trying to input text simply doesnt do anything. You might thing the installer is broken... but that is not the case...\n", "Q: What do the updates do? I am using Xubuntu. What do the updates do? I do not notice any difference after an update. The descriptions do not really them me and they benefit me. A way to find out what each update does is as good as an answer, since I assume that the updates do not all do the same thing.\n--Update--\nAlso, what is the best way to figure what each update does (like a meaningful summary of each individually.) Just edit the already accepted answer.\n\nA: *\n\n*They are bug fixes for installed apps\n\n*Security fixes for OS\n\n*Hardware fixes\n\n*Unity/Gnome/KDE/Xfce Fixes and updates\n\n*Also new features in some cases (Thanks Ashu)\n\n\nThey are helping you just you wont see the benefit of them all. I update regularly to make sure I have the latest security fixes. You don't need to update all the time, if you have a stable install just work with it until you feel you want to upgrade. \nBill\n", "Q: Show all pictures recursively (include any subfolders) Does anyone know an app that allows to get an overview about all pictures of a folder, including all subfolders?\nI would like to browse through my filesystem and then have an overview of all pictures of the current folder, like Adobe Bridge (on a Mac).\n\nA: Shotwell Photo Manager\n\n\nShotwell is a digital photo organizer designed for the GNOME desktop\n  environment. It allows you to import photos from disk or camera,\n  organize them in various  ways, view them in full-window or fullscreen\n  mode, and export them to share with others.\n\n\nIt is installed by default. Import your main folder (and all sub folders automatically) via File → Import from Folder. I also suggest to check \"Watch library directory for new files\" in Edit → Preferences → Library.\nHomepage\n\nA: I came here looking for a solution to the exact same problem. What ended up working for me is XnViewMP. In the directory tree on the left-hand side, just right-click your top-level folder and select Show all files (recursive). \n\nA: Nomacs goes in this direction, but is not exactly what you asked.\nI had the very same question for a long time now since the best organization of pictures is a tree directory, not a set of tags in database you risk to loose whenever you reinstall your linux.\nNomacs has an option in File menu called \"Scan folder recursive\" that enables jumping from a subfolder to another, in view mode, in slideshow mode or whatever. It doesn't show all the thumbnails in a same place though. \nIn panels menu, \"Thumbnail preview\" allows you to view very quickly your folder contents. It just needs a browsing option that shows folders next to another in a timeline fashion. Let's make a feature request, the devs are quite responsive :)\n\nA: try digikam. (sudo apt-get install digikam)\nIt allows you to browse your filesystem, and it shows the number of pictures available rekursively for each folder.\nYou dont need to import the pictures, but digikam will take (maybe hours) some time to scan your filesystem\n\nA: it's question from 5 years ago but nobody noticed this solution - nor here nor in top 3 google answers to this question - so here it goes:\njust use VLC - it's available for bunch of distros and on ubuntu in left \"tool\" box of VLC you have option: \"my pictures\" - it takes all pictures form your /home/user/pictures/ (including sub-folders) and plays it as slideshow\nhope it helps!\n\nA: Not an application but an useful tool to recursively show the pictures of a folder and a subfolder:\nfeh --recursive --auto-zoom --geometry 1600x1000 ~/Pictures\n\nIt can also generate an image with the thumbnails:\nfeh -r -i ~/Pictures -O index.png\n\nIt is not exactly what you (and I) were looking for, but it is the only option I have found in Linux at the moment to recursively explore the images of a directory.\n\nA: You should be able to just do a search for specific file types in the file manager (Nautilus).  Look for the option to search for image file types.\nhttp://library.gnome.org/users/user-guide/stable/nautilus-searching.html.en\n\nA: Try this :\nexiftool -ext .JPG -fast -p '$directory/$filename;$Keywords' -qq -r -m . 2> /dev/null | grep -i '\\;.*keyword1\\|keyword2' | sed 's/\\;.*//'\n\nThis will produce a list of all the filenames (path included) that contain either keyword1 or keyword2 ; Pipe it to your viewer of choice, feh being indeed a valid one.\n\nA: For those who are looking for a more GUI solution, these days gThumb Image Viewer implements the sub folder view.\n\n*\n\n*Select the main folder to browser through\n\n*Click on Search button located on the top toolbar\n\n*Check checkbox \"Include sub-folders\"\n\n*In Rules, select \"All Images\"\n\n*Hit  button\n\n", "Q: Why is my Internet connection randomly dropping? Ever since I have installed 12.04 (clean install not an upgrade), I have been having a drop in the Internet connection. The drop in the connection can be anything from 15 seconds to about 3 mins, and then the connection comes back. This behaviour happens while I am actively browsing the Internet, or if I wake up the computer and open Firefox (sometimes I have connection and sometimes I don't) . Please note that when the Internet connection is on, it is not slow (as speedtest.net results show).\nIn the beginning, I thought it was a problem with the driver r8169 for my RTL8111/8168B Ethernet card, so I downloaded the r8168 from Realtek website, followed the detailed instructions (blacklisted r8169, changed the file to .bsh ...), but still the same problem persisted.\nSo I switched to a wireless connection, and I got the same problem with Internet connection dropping randomly. \nAny ideas?

(try DSL if you connect with a LAN card or try wireless). It MAY work.\nI'm not an expert in Ubuntu and I'm not sure this would work. I am a new user and I'm telling this because it worked for me.\nHope this helps. \n\nA: There are several reasons for that, possible causes:\n\n\n*\n\n*your disk have hardware failure, like I/O errors...\n\n*You have multiple firewalls enabled, and it is better to have only one, maybe \"gufw\" is the best... and it needs to deny all with rules to allow out udp 53 and allow out tcp 25,53,80,110,143,843,993,5060,8080\n\n*Your OS is not with all modules inserted, type: lsmod > list1.txt\nThen create an USB installer with the \"startup disk creator\" using the ISO of your installation CD (a pen of 2 GB is enough) then boot from that USB PEN and choose \"try Ubuntu\" and type there: lsmod > list2.txt and copy this file to the same location the one above and open  both in text editor and see if there is missing modules in list1.txt...\nTo install missing modules use first modinfo \"name of the module\" after the description see if it needs dependencies and install those first if not, just copy the full path of the ko file and type sudo insmod \"paste path/file.ko\", after all modules inserted no need for reboot things should start working fine...\n\n*If you do not use proprietary driver, then might solve the problem due to the fact that the CPU is having trouble to process all the system in realtime, and that lack of CPU speed and Bridge speed causes wi-fi to disconnect, so try to install proprietary driver for your wireless card or disconnect every USB device that is not needed by your system to connect to the internet. If you do not find how to do this, go to \"software center\" and type \"additional drivers\" and if not installed, install it, then start it and activate all drivers available cause it will speed hings up and using less CPU...\n\n*This one is certainly your case, you are booting from an USB disk and using very fast speed which causes system resources to collapse, and has to shutdown one, and because the USB disk is the boot disk it chooses to disconnect the Wi-Fi! Solution is to connect the USB disk to an hub of less speed, like if was connected to USB3, use an USB2 hub which causes the USB disk to work at USB2 speed, if it was using USB2 then use an USB1.1 hub...\n\n*This is a long shot, and at far, your browser internet agent got corrupt or hacked by some intermediary that poses for an \"authority\" of contents provided by you, but this is a false authority, and just a cyberbulling occurence, cause there is no internet content that violates internet rules set by the internet authorities, and besides that you or anyone do not have nothing to do with the contents received, because everyone just enters the URL and the server decides which content to send, like, if two guys access the same URL at the same time, they get different pages content cause the server sends data according to lots of parameters and is configured to apply local country rules, like nudity can be considered ilegal in one country and not in other country. There is also the copyright issue but this also is not possible to violate, cause the copyright is not the act of making copies but the act of posing to be the author, that said, if one uploads copyrighted material without trying to own the copyright does not violate any internacional copyright rule. This two are the most common accusations by false \"authorities\" which makes your agent set your browser ID has an internet criminal act origin, causing every server in the world to disconnect that browser has soon it processes the browser agent, which sometimes takes several minutes... \n\nA: Because you use Ubuntu, you have the possibility to install the Ralink firmware from Debian's repos. To do this, follow the steps below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a new line to /etc/apt/sources.list :  \n\n\ndeb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian wheezy main contrib non-free # Debian repo for Ralink  \n\n\n*\n\n*Install the firmware with this command :  \n\n\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install firmware-ralink\nI hope that this will resolv the problem. (Worked in my case.)\n\nA: I have the same Ethernet card on my laptop. I have the same problem on 11.10 and a blog explained that RTL8111/8168B would have connection problems with the driver in Linux kernel. This blog is written in Chinese:\nfrom linux deepin official blog\nIt suggests that you can download the official driver from Realtek: http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=3&PNid=13&PFid=5&Level=5&Conn=4&DownTypeID=3&GetDown=false\nOr just download here: click here\nSee the README and install it with \"sudo\". Hope this will help you.\n\nA: What I have seen work sometimes in this situation is to comment out the eth0 and wlan0 lines in the /etc/network/interfaces file.  This leaves your network as unmanaged so you won't be able to use network manager to modify settings, but it does stop the connection dropping.  Some wireless cards also don't do well with the 802.11n functionality, I'd refer you to the post which helps you disable that, but for some reason I can't find it again and I didn't save the commands anywhere.\n\nA: Since you are having trouble with both wireless and wired connections I doubt that a problem remains with the firmware for either.\nIf there is something sub-optimal with the way your connections are set up, perhaps from when you were struggling with getting the firmware from Realtek working, deleting and recreating them may help.  There's an answer here for that. If it doesn't here are some ideas.\nI'd suggest that while your connection is working, you find out the IP address of your router by signing on to the router, and the address of your ISP at the other end of your connection to the ISP (you can probably get this from your router, or call the ISP for it). Also collect the output from netstat -rn, ifconfig, and arp-a.\nSince the problem isn't specific to wired or wireless, the question remains what is it specific to. The best way to answer this is to experiment when the connection isn't working. First, is it connectivity or domain name service oriented?\nIf the problem is that you can't get Internet addresses from domain names the problem may lie in domain name server lookup. To check this, try firefox http://74.125.225.212 the next time you are having trouble. That's an address for www.google.com. A problem with resolving domain names is probably the responsibility of your ISP. Your router is probably configured to route domain name requests to your ISP.\nIf you can't get to this  or other Internet sites by address, it would be a good idea to start with your computer and see how far you can get. You can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start by using the ping command and the address of your router and ping n.n.n.n, using the address you got above, as suggested by Eliah. If that works, ping the IP address of the far end of your connection. If that doesn't work look for lights on your connection device and call your ISP. Even if you can ping it but can't ping any Internet sites, it's time to call your ISP. Before calling make sure that netstat -rn on your computer when it is failing has a route for 0.0.0.0 pointing to your router.\n\n*Assuming you can't get to your router with ping, double check your ip address and network route table, ifconfig and netstat -rn can be used to compare your network between times it is working and when it is not. For a personal network with no intermediate equipment, the first 3 digits of your IPv4 IP address and that of your router should match. If they do, immediately after pinging your router the command arp -a should give you an answer for the IP address of the router. If the addresses match in the first 3 of the 4 addresses, you ping, but arp doesn't fill in an address, you have trouble with your connectivity to the router.\n\n*If that isn't working, try to ping the address of your wireless connector or wired connector, whichever you are using.\nIf you are losing the ability to ping your router, one possibility is another device on your network is trying to use the same IP address your computer is using. You can try to turn off any other devices on your network and see if that helps. Another device using the same IP address can mean that sometimes your device will work and sometimes the other one will. Being off for a while gives that other device an edge. If both devices are getting their IP addresses from your router this shouldn't be the problem, but devices configured with a static address can overlap other devices.\n", "Q: Big problem: Complete computer crash (no response when booted) I need your help:\n\n\n*\n\n*I installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my computer (I removed the complete system and installed Ubuntu instead)\n\n*It said that the bootloader installation failed.

I read on canonicals wiki that Amiga-ffs harddrives should be mountable in Ubuntu - but i had no luck in this.

Supported filesystems are:\n\nadfs,  affs,  autofs,  cifs,  coda,  coherent,  cramfs, debugfs, devpts, efs, ext, ext2, ext3, ext4, hfs, hfsplus, hpfs, iso9660, jfs, minix, msdos, ncpfs, nfs, nfs4, ntfs, proc,  qnx4, ramfs,  reiserfs,  romfs,  squashfs,  smbfs, sysv, tmpfs, ubifs,udf, ufs, umsdos, usbfs, vfat, xenix,  xfs,  xiafs.Manpage mount\n\nBefore we can mount the drive we need to define a mountpoint e.g. like this:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/amigadrive\n\nAfter that we can mount an amiga filesystem on drive /sdx (replace X by the letter given to your drive, e.g. /sdc) to this mountpoint by this command\nsudo mount -t affs /dev/sdx /mnt/amigadrive\n\nA prerequisite is that the drive was recognized by the BIOS (which may be an issue for a very old drive).\n", "Q: How can I search a Drupal site with the new Unity lens?

I'm new to to Linux, in this particular case, to Ubuntu. I have a small android project I have to finish until this Friday and I'm still stuck with the install and preparing of the development environment. \nThe only thing I did was install the Eclipse IDE. I'm still missing the SDK, JAVA and anything else that might be needed.\nCan someone help me through this? It's only because I'm running out of time to develop, or else I would embark on a deeper investigation of this OS.\n\nA: Installing the Android SDK to use with Eclipse works the same way on Ubuntu as it does on other Linux-based operating systems. You should follow the instructions in the official documentation.\nAs of the time of this writing, that means you'll download this SDK package, then follow the instructions in Installing the SDK.\nInstall the Android SDK Itself\nTo summarize the Android SDK installation instructions, you'll download the SDK, unpack it wherever you want it, and remember where you unpacked it because you'll be providing that information in Eclipse later, when setting up the ADT plugin (see below). If you have no other preference, a good place for the Android SDK is directly in your home directory (not the Downloads folder it may have been saved to, but to the home directory, which contains your downloads folder, your Documents folder, your Desktop folder, and so forth). To extract the Android SDK, put the .tar.gz file wherever you want it, then right-click on it and click Extract Here.\n\n\n*\n\n*The Android SDK contains 32-bit programs and libraries. This is fine even if you are running the 64-bit version of Ubuntu. But if you're running the 64-bit version of Ubuntu, you probably only already have the 32-bit versions of the libraries that the Android SDK relies on installed. The easiest way to install the 64-bit versions of these libraries is by installing the ia32-libs package. This works on all versions of Ubuntu. See this question for details.\n\n\nInstall a JDK If You Don't Have One Already\nThe installation instructions give you a link to where you can download Oracle's proprietary JDK (Java). If you choose to use the Oracle's proprietary JDK, this answer explains how to install it from the command-line with the packages available on Oracle's website.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you prefer to use the OpenJDK, you can install do this by installing the openjdk-7-jdk package in the Software Center ...or by running this command in the Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T):\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk\n\nThe installation instructions say to use JDK 6 (which you can do by installing openjdk-6-jdk), but they link to version 7 of Oracle's proprietary JDK, so the Android SDK will probably work fine with the latest OpenJDK as well.\nThe installation instructions explicitly recommend that Ubuntu users see the community documentation on Java and Java installation, if experiencing any problems.\nInstall the ADT Plugin for Eclipse\nAs explained in the installation instructions, you'll install the ADT plugin for Eclipse, which is what lets you use Eclipse to develop Android applications.\nInstall Android Development Packages In Eclipse\nIn Eclipse, you'll pick what Android development packages you want to install. Different packages are required for targeting different versions of the Android operating system for different devices, and for using various additional functionality implemented by some mobile device manufacturers. You can have however many of these packages installed at the same time as you wish (although if you select a lot of them, it may take a while for them to download and install before you can begin developing for Android). The installation instructions explain how to decide what you need.\n", "Q: unable to boot from live USB Edit: Welp, I re-made the live USB and now it works fine. Thanks for the replies!

Specifically, when I attempted to install BURG. That's my experience with the first part of your problem with the \"error: no such partition\". \nThe second part of your problem, happened, I don't know when/why, to me as well. If I remember correctly, booting from Flash Drive did not work for me either, but booting from CD Image did. I would try that. Either way, I got through both of the problems.

I have connected a failed hard disk which has a detectable FAT32 filesystem. I Dont know the nature of the damage. What is the easiest way to recover the data from the drive?\n\nA: Quoted:\nThere are lots of utilities to recover deleted files, but what if you can’t boot up your computer, or the whole drive has been formatted? We’ll show you some tools that will dig deep and recover the most elusive deleted files, or even whole hard drive partitions.\nTestdisk includes TestDisk, which can recover lost partitions and repair boot sectors, and PhotoRec, which can recover many different types of files from tons of different file systems.\nForemost, originally developed by the US Air Force Office of Special Investigations, recovers files based on their headers and other internal structures. Foremost operates on hard drives or drive image files generated by various tools.\nScalpel performs the same functions as foremost, but is focused on enhanced performance and lower memory usage. Scalpel may run better if you have an older machine with less RAM.\nRecover Data Like a Forensics Expert Using an Ubuntu Live CD\nOr you can use Redo Backup and Recovery\nRedo Backup and Recovery is a GPLv3 Perl script built with a GTK2+ interface designed in Glade. It is simply a front end to partclone, which performs the actual backup and restore. The live CD is built on Ubuntu to provide a graphical user interface and unmodified binaries of each program, but the script will run on any Linux platform that has the required programs installed. The Perl source code for the backup script is contained on the live CD itself. \nRedo doesn't need Windows. Download and burn the ISO, place it in your CD-ROM drive, and reboot your machine. The system will load a complete mini operating system with a point-and-click user interface into your computer's memory, without writing any information to your hard drive. Then you will be able to perform backup, restore and recovery actions—guaranteed—even if you aren't able to boot into your regular operating system.\nSource: howtogeek.com and  Redo\n", "Q: How do I install Amnesia?

That's how I installed all of the Frictional games.  Did you buy it through the Humble Indie Bundle or just the individual game?  If you got the bundle, you should have the option of downloading the games through the software center or downloading each of the games as separate files from the Humble Indie Bundle servers.

I have already acquired a S/MIME certificate (a .p12 file) issued by an authority. Using it in Writer, I can digitally sign documents by following this procedure : How do I make a digital certificate available to LibreOffice Writer for digital signatures?\nCan I do the same for PDF files? If yes, what method do you suggest me? I would prefer a solution that relies on Free Software.\n\nA: You can sign PDF files with gpg/seahorse.\nLearn more: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto\nYou can for instance use OpenSignPDF, that can be download here: http://opensignature.sourceforge.net/english.php\nI hope this answers your question.\n\nA: There is a GPL tool called AutoFirma from Spanish Government which works quite nice with p12 formatted certificates. For now it's only available in Spanish, but source code is available here or on Github and could be translated.\n\nA: I ended up doing following\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed Virtual Box \n\n*Then installed virtual box extension pack (For usb token)\n\n*Download windows 10 iso available for free from MS website.\n\n*Boot into windows downloaded Adobe reader and signed the document.\n\n\nNot the native solution but it gets the work done.\n\nA: Master PDF Editor has a free version that will sign .p12 files.\nHowever the free version leaves an ugly watermark. Interestingly enough, this can be removed within the program itself or with another PDF editor (ex. LibreOffice Draw). I think version 4 does not leave a watermark.\n\nA: Using LibreOffice with version bigger than 5.3 you can sign PDF documents.\nGo To File > Digital Signatures > Sign existing PDF...\nThe original entry dated from December 2016:\nhttps://vmiklos.hu/blog/pdf-sign.html\n\nA: Your only option is Portable Signer. Download it and run the jar. It requires a private key in a p12 file though (not compatible with SmartCard).\nYou might expect Ubuntu document signing tools like qdigidoc or gpg would do, but no, they don't play with PDF signatures.\nYou might then expect Ubuntu PDF manipulation tools like qpdf, which provides encryption, or pdftk, which provides watermarking, to provide signing features too, but, no, they don't.\nThe total list of opensource tools available for your purpose is:\nhttp://wiki.cacert.org/PdfSigning\nUnfortunately, none of the tools is currently maintained and none can be found in Ubuntu packages. Portable Signer is the most well maintained of all.\n\n\n*\n\n*Portable Signer hasn't been updated since 2014 - this is the most well maintained among all.\n\n*jSignPdf hasn't been updated since 2013.\n\n*jPdfSign hasn't been updated since 2006.\n\n*CACert's PdfSigner uses outdated iText tool.\n\n*OpenSignature hasn't been updated since 2008.\n\n*Footprint's link is broken.\n\n*jPDFSecure (commercial) – updated in 2017 but it is a Java library not a user tool.\n\n\nA: As @fquinto mentioned in a comment:\njsignpdf is a solid option.\n\nPDF signing software written in Java. It supports visible signatures, timestamping, certificate verification and many other cool features\n\n\nA: Good news! KDE's PDF viewer Okular (with backend Poppler) now supports embedded digital signatures in PDFs, similar to how Adobe Reader does it. Details are found in a post by TU Dresden, who has sponsored the implementation of this feature.\nThe feature is expected to appear in releases from April 2021 (Okular v21.04, Poppler v21.01). As of December 2020, it is already possible to compile the current development version of Okular and the Poppler PDF library locally to obtain the feature. Instructions and a build script are provided with the TU Dresden post.\nI have completed the installation using the instructions in the script (watch out for truncated lines in the online-preview!) on KDE Neon 5.20 (based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS) using Poppler as of Commit 407293bf and Okular as of Commit 110ccd61 (future versions should of course continue to work, so this is just for full reproducibility). I have installed under /usr/local/ and created a start script okular-sign with the variable definitions as in the TU Dresden manual. The new version of Okular identifies as \"Version 21.03.70\". As typical for KDE, this \"local\" version of Okular does interfere with the official one from the distribution, which is partly changed to the new version even when starting the old binary (presumably this is due to KDE's system-wide registration of \"parts\" or some such component). I hope that it will be possible to revert to an official version when signing support is released in my distribution's packages.\nAfter successful installation, I could create a digital signature as advertised in the post:\n\n*\n\n*Open a PDF\n\n*Click 'Digitally sign' in the 'Tools' menu. Alternatively add the\n\"Digitally sign\" icon in your preferred tool bar and click it.\n\n*Draw a rectangle where you want to have the visible hint for the\nelectronic signature.\n\n*A dialogue will ask for the private key to use, in case there are\nmultiple. Select the one you want to use.\n\n*Enter the passphrase of your key.\n\nOne is prompted to save the signed PDF under a new file name after that.\n\nA: I found that you can use gpg to sign a PDF in a way that it still opens up in a viewer.\ngpg --clearsign --output=signed.pdf input.pdf\n\nAbove would yield .asc file which is basically concatenation of input||signature but file extension is forced into .pdf making it to open in viewer, produce thumbnails, etc. \n\nYou can verify signature using gpg again.\n$ gpg --verify signed.pdf \ngpg: Podpisano nie, 12 kwi 2015, 19:07:15 CEST z użyciem RSA kluczem\ngpg: Poprawny podpis od \"Arkadiusz Bulski <arek.bulski@gmail.com>\"\n\nBe warned that some pdfs dont work well with signing this way, such as optimised pdfs. You should check the results yourself.\n\nA: If you have the certificate available in Writer and if using its Export to PDF function, you can also digitally sign the resulting PDF from the last tab of the dialog right before the export.\nAs far as I can tell, Acrobat Reader for Android says the document is protected, for what it's worth.\nUpdate '17: Since last December you can sign PDF files with LibreOffice by going File → Digital signatures → Sign Existing PDF.\nThat will open Draw which is capable of signing the PDF.\n\nA: Since google led me here. These are my steps without p12 formatted certificate. based on how to get p12 formatted client certificate file and how to sign documents .\n\n*\n\n*register on cacert.org via join https://www.cacert.org/index.php?id=1\n\n*get client certificate as described in the cacert wiki:\n\n*\n\n*you might possibly need to do this in a another browser (e.g. Pale Moon)\n\n*Instructions: http://wiki.cacert.org/Technology/KnowledgeBase/ClientCerts#To_get_your_client_cert_from_CAcert\n\n\n\n*backup the client certificate as p12 formatted file (make sure to keep the backup password.

As of when I am writing it costs only 125 $.\nAccording to the official website, it is indeed S/MIME signing.\n\nA: You may also want to take a look at the Simple Signer. In addition to LibreOffice Draw, it can also add a visual stamp onto the document (which is linked to your signature) as known from the Adobe Reader.\nIn addition to that, you can choose if you want to sign or certify your document.\n", "Q: Can I use other Desktop environment in Ubuntu-Studio and exchange whenever I want?, Xfce to Unity & Vise I have Ubuntu-studio 12.04 installed and I really want to have both Xfce and unity desktop, can I install both and use one of them when ever i want login?\nIf so can you give me a little guide.\nThanks for answers. \n\nA: Yes, this works the same as in any Ubuntu installation. The only difference is that new versions of Ubuntu Studio use Xfce by default.\n\n\n*\n\n*In a standard Ubuntu installation, Ubuntu provides you with the Unity and Unity 2D desktop environments. You can select between those at the login screen. Click the circular button with the Ubuntu logo on it and a drop-down menu will appear showing your options for graphical session types. (If you're logged in, log out to get to the login screen.)\nIf you want Xfce, install the package called xubuntu-desktop. Then you'll see Xubuntu as an option on the login screen.\n\n*In Ubuntu Studio, you already have Xfce, and the GNOME Unity interface is what you have to install. The best way to get this is to install the ubuntu-desktop package.\nThen log out, and select Ubuntu or Ubuntu 2D as your session type on the login screen.\nTo install any package (including ubuntu-desktop), you should be connected to the Internet. Then you can install it in the Software Center, or you can install it from the Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) by running these commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop\n\nYou'll probably prefer the Software Center, as it uses a simple, graphical interface.\nThe amount you'll have to download will depend on what components you currently have installed, so it would be hard for me to guess that...but both installation methods will give you this information when you go to install anything.\n", "Q: Is there any file password protection (NTFS)? I want to Hide & prevent of use! Is there any file password protection (NTFS)? I want to Hide & prevent of use!\nI know that I can hide with \".folder\", but I want something whithout changing the name and I can Hide or Password it. File is on Windows partition.\nThanks for answers.\n\nA: It sounds like you have a file that you need to access, but only after a password has unlocked it, correct?\nIf so, I would strongly suggest you look at using TrueCrypt - http://www.truecrypt.org/.  You can install it in both Windows and Ubuntu and use the same password to unlock the same file on either system.\nThe only drawback to your situation is that you specifically state \"file password protection\" but TrueCrypt creates a volume with the encrypted contents inside the volume.\n\nA: You can use gpg to encrypt files with symmetric encryption (using a password).\nYou will be able to decrypt these on windows if you need to using pgp or gpg for windows.\nYou can do this on the command line like so:\ngpg -c blah.txt\n\nThere is a plugin for nautilus that allows for encryption and decryption of files, however it only supports asymmetric encryption (it will decrypt symmetric however), which is not particularly useful for encrypting files on the same hard drive as they keys are held IMO. \nIf you want to use that anyway it's called seahorse-nautilus and it's in the repo.\n\nA: Just hiding a file doesn't keep anybody from accessing it. On both Ubuntu and Windows, hidden files can be shown easily in the graphical file browser and in the command-line. In Ubuntu, the Nautilus file browser will show such files if you go to View > Show Hidden Files (or just press Ctrl+H).\nIf the problem is that you want to keep people from reading the contents of a file even if they have access to the file (which includes if they stole your computer or your hard drive), you should use encryption; other answers here explain some options for that.\nIf the problem is that NTFS partitions are mounted in Ubuntu so that all users on your Ubuntu system have full access to them, and you want to control access to individual files and folders on your NTFS volume the same as they are controlled in Windows, then what you need to do is to mount your NTFS partition with support for NTFS permissions.\nTo learn how to do that, see this answer and this documentation. It's a bit complicated, but quite doable. If you have trouble, feel free to post a question asking for help.\n", "Q: Send current workspace to another computer? I have a desktop and laptop, both running Ubuntu 12.04. Frequently when working, I will need to move from the desktop to the laptop and go on the road. Is there any way possible that on the desktop, i could send a current workspace, with windows open, programs up, browser tabs open, to my second computer?\nI dont want to work primarily on the laptop, because it is slower, but being able to queue things up on the desktop and send them to the laptop to have ready for when I leave would be unbelievably time saving. I have explored remote desktop, but it seems overkill to send entire video/image stream between the computers when I basically just need to run some commands on the remote computer (i believe?).\nAny information would be helpful. \nThanks\n\nA: You can use ssh with X forwarding (ssh -l remoteusername -X remotehost), this will allow you to run individual application on remote machine, not the whole X-windows system. See this page and this AskUbuntu solution for details.\n", "Q: How do I digitally sign emails outgoing from different identities? To send emails, I use one SMTP server, say domain1.com. But I use two identities that set up in Thunderbird, say agmenor@domain1.com and agmenor@domain2.com. For those who are not knowledgeable about it, this means that my addressees see emails coming from  agmenor@domain1.com and from agmenor@domain2.com, with no evident link between the two.\nFurthermore, I was issued a SMIME certificate for each identity from an authority, in the form of a .p12 file. This permits me to digitally sign my emails.\nHow do I set up Thunderbird so that it signs my outgoing emails with the correct certificate respectively to each identity?\nThe problem I now face is that I know only how to associate my SMTP server to a certificate, but not to each identity separately.\n\nA: You assign the certificates to each email account by selecting the security option in Account Settings and then selecting proper certificates.\nHowever, if both signing certificates have the same name (for example your name), you will not be able to use both because of this 7 year old and never fixed bug in Thunderbird:\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=278689\n", "Q: Setting up Java Web Start for Firefox when the JDK is in a personalized location Do I need a symlink to make javaws, that is, Java Web Start, work if I have a personalized location for my Java?\nI have installed Java as follows:\nsudo update-alternatives --install \"/usr/bin/java\" \"java\" \n    \"/home/user/programs/jdk6u32/bin/java\" 1\n\nsudo update-alternatives --install \"/usr/bin/javaws\" \"javaws\" \n    \"/home/user/programs/jdk6u32/bin/javaws\" 1\n\nsudo update-alternatives --config java\nsudo update-alternatives --config javaws\n\nsudo ln -s /home/user/programs/jdk6u32/jre/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so \n    /usr/lib/firefox-addons/plugins/libnpjp2.so\n\nThe last line is necessary for Firefox to find the Java plug-in.

The solution should be easy (since Ubuntu fully supports running 32-bit programs on a 64-bit OS)--just install the 32-bit versions of the libraries it needs.\nThe simplest and easiest way to do this is to install the 32-bit versions of all the most commonly used libraries, by installing the ia32-libs  package. You can do this in the Software Center or in the Terminal with:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\nOriginally ia32-libs was provided because Ubuntu, in its default configuration, didn't support installing 32-bit Ubuntu packages on a 64-bit system. Now that this is fully supported by default, the ia32-libs package just causes the same 32-bit packages to be installed on your 64-bit system that would be installed on a minimal 32-bit system.

The partitions and Ubuntu install are still as I want them, but it would be nice to have them back to a clean state without having to re-install them all.\n\nA: I actually had to do this a while back (a couple years ago, so excuse the not quite perfect commands) and this is what I did.\nFirst: \ndpkg --get-selections > installed.txt\n\nI then happened to have a fresh installation around that I did the same thing on. If you don't have one, you could probably find a list somewhere for your distribution. Then:\nsdiff [your install list] [clean install list] --suppress-common-lines > differences.txt\nsdiff [clean install list] [differences] --suppress-common-lines > remove.txt\n\nThe second sdiff is to allow for default packages you might have removed from your installation.

I also ran a couple more commands in vim to remove excess white space and replace the line breaks with spaces, just to make it a bit cleaner. You then run this file through apt-get remove (add in --purge if you want).\nIf you want to be extra thorough you can use different cleaners to get rid of crap, and also run the comparison differently so you can add the packages back that you may have removed [from the default package list].\nAll in all, after I did all that I decided it wasn't worth the effort compared to the relative ease of reinstalling Ubuntu.\n\nA: sudo dpkg -i /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb\nsudo dpkg --configure -a  \n\nAnd then, if something was broken, run a couple of times:  \nsudo apt-get install -f\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\n", "Q: How do I get an Atheros AR242 / AR542 wireless card working?

I have been trying for many days to create a wifi hotspot with my laptop running ubuntu 12.04 and connect it to my windows phone7.5 based HTC Mozart. I have gone through many articles related to this, but none of them help.\nI create a wifi hotspot as suggested by some experts, but it isn't detected either by my phone or on other laptops.\nMy laptop is Sony Vaio VPCEB14EN with these specifications .\n\nA: You can create a wifi-hotspot like following:\nGnome-Shell:\n\n*\n\n*Click on the little network icon, at the top panel.\n\n\n\n*Select \"Network Settings\"\n\n\n*Select \"Wireless\" in the left pane.\n\n\n\n*Click on the On/Off toogle on the right pane.\n\n\n\n*Click on \"Use as hotspot\", You don't need to specify name\n\nThat's it. A wireless wifi-hotspot is created with autocreated name and security key. The network name and security key is displayed immediately.\n\nSee the screenshots below.\nUnity:\n\n*\n\n*Click on the network activity icon,  a menu will appear like the one below.\n\n\n\n*Click on \"Create new wireless network...\", a window will appear like this\n\n\n*Type in your network name and security key.\n\n\n\n*Click on create button.\nA network will be created with the name typed.\nYou can now see in your HTC phone this newly created network. There must be an option for \"checking available network\" or \"refresh network\".\n\nA: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1758347.html \n\nUnderstand that its not the \"gb\" (which I'm assuming means \"gigabytes\"\n  as in you have enough storage space on your hard drive), it's the\n  amount of work that you'll need to do not only for your laptop that\n  will become the Wifi connection, but on the mobile devices, too. That\n  said, let's start (relatively) easy. We'll create a connection between\n  your laptop and another device over the wireless interface.  First, we\n  need to find out what your wired connection settings are. To get this\n  information, right-click on the network manager icon and select\n  \"Connection information\". (NOTE: That's the connection that appears in\n  the upper, righthand corner of your screen and is typically next to\n  the icon for your sound and for your Evolution e-mail.) This will tell\n  you your IP address and, more importantly, the \"Route\" and \"Primary\n  DNS\". Note those two things (route and primary DNS).  We're going to\n  start by creating an ad-hoc network connection on your laptop.\n  Right-click on the network manager icon and select \"Edit connections\".\n  In the window that opens, select the \"Wireless\" tab and click on the\n  \"Add\" button. Here are the values to enter in the various windows:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Connection Name: Whatever you want to call it, such as \"My Hotspot\".\n  \n*SSID: This will be the \"name\" of your hotspot that others might see to connect to it.\n  \n*Mode: Select \"Adhoc\"\n  \n*Band: I suggest selecting \"B/G\".\n  \n*Channel: You can either leave this as is, or choose a specific number. If you're in the US, it will have to be a number between 1 -\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*I've found that 11 tends to work best because most people choose either the default (which is 6 normally) or \n  1.\n  \n  \n*BSSID: Leave blank.\n  \n*Device MAC Address: Leave blank.\n  \n*Cloned MAC Address: Leave blank.\n  \n*MTU: Leave as \"automatic\".\n  \n  \n  Don't hit \"Apply\" yet. Select the \"Wireless Security\" tab and make\n  sure it says, \"None\".\nNow select the \"IPV4 Settings\" tab.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Method: Choose \"Manual\".\n  \n*Next to \"Addresses\" click \"Add\".\n  \n*Under the \"Address\" column, enter \"192.168.100.1\", with a netmask of \"255.255.255.0\". \n  \n  \n  Under \"Gateway\", enter the IP address you got from \"Route\" in your\n  wired connection. For example, here at my house, my IP addresses are\n  192.168.1.x. The router (a Fios-provided router) is at 192.168.1.1. That's the IP address I would put in under \"Gateway\". For you, I'm\n  assuming you have a Motorola cable modem. Put in the IP address of\n  that (which should be the same as what you got from \"Route\" for your\n  wired connection.) Under DNS servers, put the IP address you got for\n  \"Primary DNS\" of your wired connection. For the secondary DNS, I\n  always put \"8.8.4.4\", which is a Google public DNS server.\n  - Leave the box checked that says, \"Require IPv4 for this connection to complete\".\nNow click \"Apply\".\nNow,LEFT-click on your network manager icon and select \"Connect to\n  Hidden Wireless Network\". Next to where it says \"Connection\", click on\n  the drop-down menu and you should see the name of the connection you\n  just created. Select it and then click on \"Connect\".\nAt this point, your laptop can be become part of an ad hoc network.\n  You should see the network manager begin flickering, then it should\n  announce \"My HotSpot connection established\" (or whatever you named\n  your wireless connection).\nLeave it up for a minute or two, then see if any of your other\n  wireless devices can \"see\" it when looking for available wireless\n  connections.\n\n\nA: Here is a link for those who created a network but their phone doesn't recognizes it:\nClick here and get it working \n", "Q: How do I access File Manager and change to List View this is a daft question even to me - but I am new to Ubuntu so pls bear with me.\nI have installed Ubuntu 12.04 lts.

I want to connect to a windows share that only accepts ipsec transport mode. I have a list of security policies and a shared secret. I've skimmed through the man page on ipsec.conf on the web and it seems to be the place to put these polices. If ipsec is part of the kernel (and I think it is, I'm using Ubuntu 12.04) do I need to install some other package in order to get this working? I'm guessing it's either openSWAN or strongSWAN but don't know the difference.\n\nA: Did you see this Article.It might help you.\n", "Q: how to add programs to ubuntu without internet access I don't have internet access at my home and it takes me about a half hour to ride my bike to the library. I have downloaded .deb files to try to install at my home computer but everyone I have downloaded says it can't install because it depends on package X.  The next day I will download package X and it will require package Y.  Is there anyway to find out what ALL the sub-dependencies are for deb files?  \nI have tried to boot from USB or External Hard drive on the library computers but the security settings prevent this.\nAlso, I do not know anyone with a Linux computer.\n\nA: You can go to Ubuntu Package Search and find the packages on any computer, even one with Windows or Mac OSX. You can then download the .deb files and double-click them on the Ubuntu computer after bringing them on a flash drive in order to install them(Or in terminal, execute sudo dpkg -i /path/to/package.deb)\n\nA: The post here has some suggestions. Packagedepends looks like it may be what you're looking for.\n\nA: In ubuntu, Packages work like food.  If you want a cup of coffee, you will need coffee beans and milk.  If you want a bowl of cereal, you will need a box of cereal and milk, just like the coffee.\nSame thing.  You want package X,  and it requires package Z.  You want Package Y, but it also requires package Z.  If you want to download all the packages, the best way to do it is to bring your computer to the library and run sudo apt-get package.\nBut if you can't bring your computer to the library, you can go to the Ubuntu packages search (as ObsessiveFOSS said) and find all the packages you need.  When you found a specific package, click the package, then go to the \"Other Packages Related\" section and install all the packages before you install the main package.  Otherwise it will show up as an error.\n\nA: This is a partial answer; hopefully others will post answers detailing, perhaps in tutorial form, how to use a utility to automatically handle dependencies, download packages to a Windows (or other non-Linux) machine, and install them on your Ubuntu system.\nI've instead focused on answering just one part of this question.\n\nIs there anyway to find out what ALL the sub-dependencies are for deb files?\n\nYes, there is a way to do this with mostly accurate results.\nChecking on http://packages.ubuntu.com/ is not a very good solution because you will usually already have many of the packages it says are dependencies. Instead, you should simulate installing the package you want:\napt-get -s install packagename\nSince you're not actually installing anything, you don't have to use sudo.\nThis will, in addition to some other information, tell you what packages would have to be installed (or upgraded or removed) for packagename to be installed.\nWhile this usually gives the right answer, occasionally it does not, if you have not been able to run sudo apt-get update recently (which you probably cannot do because your machine is never connected to the Internet). This is because some packages will be available in versions newer than the database of package information in your machine accounts for. Such newer packages occasionally have different dependencies (or simply require a later version of a package it already depended on...where you might already have the earlier version).\nRunning this kind of simulation is very useful for situations where you are temporarily without an Internet connection and/or just need to install a small number of packages. For long-term package management, this is inadequate, because:\n\n\n*\n\n*You would never find out about important updates, and your machine absolutely can fall victim to some kinds of security vulnerabilities even without being network-connected. This will become more of an issue as Linux-based systems continue to become used by an increasing number of people (since there will then be much more malware written to target Ubuntu and other Linux-based systems).\n\n*While far less effort intensive than going back and forth between your home and your public library several times for each package you have to install (to retrieve packages as you find out they are needed as dependencies), calculating dependencies with apt-get -s install ... and manually downloading all the necessary .deb files is still extremely time consuming, if you have to install a lot of software, or install software frequently.\nHopefully someone will post about a full solution to this problem. I know they exist, but I am not adequately familiar with any of them to give a good, thorough answer.\n", "Q: Open with Ubuntu Software Center in kde I bought the humble bundle pack and how can i open it with Software-center?

We'll begin by(assuming your hard disk partition is /dev/sdb1, run\nsudo blockdev --setro /dev/sdb\n\nand \nsudo blockdev --setro /dev/sdb1\n\n(At least one should succeed). Then, without rebooting, we shall run \nsudo mkdir /media/mountrecovery\n\nfollowed by\nsudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /media/mountrecovery -o force\n\nThis will mount your filesystem as read only at /media/mountrecovery\nOld answer:\nYou may have corrupted something very important for the filesystem to work.\nTry opening My Computer under Windows XP, right-clicking your failed hard disk and clicking on Properties>Tools tab>Check Now. Run the check. If it wants to reschedule after a reboot, let it do that and reboot with the hard disk connected. Then, it should work.(The damage doesn't look too bad) If not, you'll need to salvage your files.\n You can try getting DiskDigger(Too bad not FOSS), and running it under Windows XP on the hard disk that held the data you lost. You can then restore these files to an external hard disk.(Use quick mode and if it fails, use the long, thorough mode.

The Apple Magic Mouse appears to work with Ubuntu so far, but only a couple multitouch functions seem to work. With the trackpad, there are lots of other functions with utouch. What I'd really like to do is map two-finger swipes to back/forward in a browser. \n\nA: I have set up this and many other gestures with touchegg. Install it via:\nsudo apt-get install touchegg\n\nConfigurate touchegg via its configuration file located here:\n~/.config/touchegg/touchegg.conf\n\nConfiguration for your desired gestures would be the following.\n<touchégg>\n\n<settings>\n    <property name=\"composed_gestures_time\">15000</property>\n</settings>\n\n<application name=\"All\">      \n\n    <gesture type=\"DRAG\" fingers=\"2\" direction=\"LEFT\">\n        <action type=\"SEND_KEYS\">Alt+Right</action>\n    </gesture>\n\n    <gesture type=\"DRAG\" fingers=\"2\" direction=\"RIGHT\">\n        <action type=\"SEND_KEYS\">Alt+Left</action>\n    </gesture>\n\n</application>\n\nIt's important to follow the last hint of the FAQ if you want to setup two or three finger gestures.\n synclient TapButton2=0\n synclient TapButton3=0\n synclient ClickFinger2=0\n synclient ClickFinger3=0\n synclient HorizTwoFingerScroll=0\n synclient VertTwoFingerScroll=0\n\nCreate an executable shell script and fire it up on startup.\nThis deactivates the two and three finger taps and clicks of the synaptics driver as well as the two finger scrolling. If you want to keep the two finger tap to be the right mouse button click and the two finger scrolling you have to do it with touchegg as well.\nI think the magic mouse reports itself as a trackpad as stated here.\n\nA: I'm not sure this will work with Magic Mouse, but with Magic Trackpad I successfully used xSwipe to get browser back / forward navigation, workspace switch, Scale and Expo actions.\n\nA: Have you tried touchegg? I was able to define some gestures on my MacBook's touchpad.\nhttp://code.google.com/p/touchegg/\n\nA: Easystroke Gesture Recognition can map a gesture to an aplication.\nyou can findEasystroke Gesture Recognition in ubuntu software centre.\n\nA: At the moment of writing this, mouse driver hid-magicmouse does not report two-finger swipe any differently than one-finger. So no application level solution is possible. You have to watch the development of kernel module. \nMagic Mouse is seen in system as a very basic mouse with two scrollwheels. It will not be detected by any touchpad software.\nOn the contrary, Apple Magic Touch is seen as a very advanced touchpad and can be assigned many more functions than as in MacOS.  \n", "Q: Ubuntu hangs at the '_' prompt for 15' when booting.

If Ubuntu does \"say\" this, then it is slightly confused.\nIf you look at the entries for the G31 & G33 chipsets in this table on Wikipedia, you can see that they are very similar. The primary difference between them is that the G31 uses the ICH7 southbridge and only supports 4 GB of RAM. The G33 uses an ICH9, can support 8 GB of RAM, and also can support DDR3 RAM.\nIn particular, both the G31 & G33 provide the same integrated graphics: Intel GMA 3100. In other words, there is no difference between the G31 & the G33 in terms of the type of graphics supported.\n\nIf the hang at the _ prompt occurs after the GRUB boot menu (or if you do not see a GRUB boot menu), then you might see if using the nomodeset kernel boot option helps.\nAdding the nomodeset kernel option for a single boot\nYou can edit the boot instructions for the GRUB menu entry to add the nomodeset option to see if it corrects your graphics problem. \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to the GRUB boot menu. An example of the menu is shown in the screenshot below.\n\nNote: If you do not see the GRUB boot menu when you boot, try pressing and holding the shift key immediately after the BIOS portion of the boot completes.\n\n*Select (highlight) the GRUB boot menu entry for the Ubuntu kernel you wish to boot.\n\n*Press e to edit the GRUB boot commands for the selected boot menu entry.  \n\n*Look near the bottom of the list of commands for lines similar to\nlinux /boot/vmlinuz-3.2.0-24-generic root=UUID=bc6f8146-1523-46a6-8b\\\n6a-64b819ccf2b7 ro  quiet splash\ninitrd /boot/initrd.img-3.2.0-24-generic\n\n*Change the middle line in (4) by adding the kernel boot parameter nomodeset to the end of the line (i.e. after ro  quiet splash).\nFor this example you would change\n6a-64b819ccf2b7 ro  quiet splash\nto \n6a-64b819ccf2b7 ro  quiet splash nomodeset\n\n*Without leaving this GRUB edit screen, press either Ctrl+X or F10 to boot using the modified kernel options.\nNote: These changes are not persistent. Any change to the kernel boot options made this way will only affect the next boot and only if you start that boot by pressing either Ctrl+X or F10 while still in GRUB edit mode.\n", "Q: Win7 no longer available after installing 12.04 I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 but my Windows 7 partition seems to have been lost.

Is XTerm able to do all of the things the regular terminal can do?\n\nA: Yes and no. As far as commands go, it's the same since it uses the same shell (bash) that every other terminal on your system does. \nBut xterm is a basic terminal emulator which does not support features you may be used to with the regular (gnome-) terminal such as multiple tabs, etc. Other things such as changing fonts is also more difficult (people often find the xterm default font too tiny.)\nThe reason for this lack of features is that xterm depends only on the core X server, unlike gnome-terminal and the others. It will run even on an Ubuntu that has no graphical environment installed, and uses very little memory (but that doesn't matter unless you have a very old computer)\nNote that you can get additional features within xterm by using a text-mode session manager such as byobu (screen), but for most users it's easier to stick to gnome-terminal or alternatives such as xfce4-terminal, etc. \n\nA: Short answer yes.\nLonger answer Xterm is a terminal emulator, as is gnome-terminal.\ngnome-terminal is more configurable then xterm in that you have greater control over colours can assign keyboard shortcuts etc.\nBut what you type into the terminal is exactly the same no matter which terminal emulator you use.\nWhat makes the difference in the capabilities of what you can do with the terminal is not the emulator, but the shell\nThere are a number of options of shell most common is bash, another option is fish\n", "Q: Problem with executing dssp (secondary structure assignment) I followed a previous post to install dssp on Ubuntu\nHow to install dssp (secondary structure assignments) under 12.04?\nAfter the installation I tried to execute dssp which was in /usr/local/bin/dssp\nBut it gave me the following error\nbash: /usr/local/bin/dssp: cannot execute binary file\nAlso I tried to analyses some trajectory files from a simulation using the code\ndo_dssp -s md.tpr -f traj.xtc\n\nBut it also failed giving me the error below\nReading file md.tpr, VERSION 4.5.5 (single precision)\nReading file md.tpr, VERSION 4.5.5 (single precision)\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\n\nPlease post me a solution for this problem.

I configured my Ubuntu system so that I'm able to start any application in a separate X server. Running games or for example XBMC in a separate X server has some major advantages.\nThe problem however, is that when you switch to the second X server (Ctrl+Alt+F8), you don't hear any sound. Strangely, when switching back to the desktop (Ctrl+Alt+F7) you can suddenly hear the sound from the second X server. This means that the sound is working, but you just can't hear it while you're in the second X server.\nIn older versions of Ubuntu (e.g. Ubuntu 10.10), there is a command (ck-launch-session) which you could run in the second X server and the sound would work. Unfortunately, this command no longer has that effect in Ubuntu 11.04 and later. This is the command I would use to launch XBMC in a separate X server:\nxinit /usr/bin/ck-launch-session /usr/bin/xbmc -- :1\n\nHow can I enable sound when I'm in a second X server in Ubuntu 11.04 or later?\nRelated bug report: 366404\n\nA: When I did that kind of thing, I had to be part of the \"audio\" group. That way the audio from every screen could be heard. One problem: switching screens does not change the audio outputted. If I had an instance of KDE running on one screen and playing music with Amarok, I would be able to hear it on all screens.\nIf you (like me) don't know how to add a user to a group through the command prompt, just install \"kuser\" in Synaptic or the software centre or type sudo apt-get install kuser in the terminal.\nI seem to remember having some problems starting it as root with the default launcher. If it gives you an error saying it cannot access a file, it generally isn't a problem, just make sure you are using the program as root. If it just tells you you need to be root, close the window, press ALT+F2, then type gksudo kuser. The computer will ask for your password, then Kuser will load correctly.\n\nA: Try to make your pulse-audio credentials known on the second x-server by using pax11publish -D :1 -e\n(where :1 is the Display number of your second X-Server, normally :0 is the first one, counting upwards)\nThe application you are running is probably trying to read pulse-attributes from the X11 root windows properties.\nAlternatively you could be stuck in major consolekit f*ckup.\n", "Q: Over-Current condition on port 7 or 8 I am having a problem with my USB ports.

But, workaround or for logging of the error, you could unbind the port, creating the problem.\nThe steps are as follows:\ncd /sys/bus/usb/drivers \nls (There will be usb driver listed, which is creating the problem)\necho \"usb_creating_problem\" | sudo tee unbind\n\nThis ought to stop the message to be logged, as the driver for that port would not be found by the machine. Just when you get your port  fix, bind it again by:\necho \"usb_creating_problem\" | sudo tee bind\n\nAlso, in the above answer use ignore_oc (\"oc\" in small letters).\n", "Q: How to get the procedural interface back? Setting up a new machine, I just discovered the procedural interface to SQLite3 seems to be gone:\nPHP Fatal error:  Call to undefined function sqlite3_open()\nIs there any way to get that back again?

My favorite comes from Ubuntu Forums and is a description of several grub settings that may come into play in this situation.

I even hear the Ubuntu tone as if the machine has reached a logon screen, but all I see is the blinking cursor.\nIt appears that the 12.04 LTS livecd doesn't do well with some graphics cards or certain chipsets, because it relies upon a preset environment (I have a recent nVidia card).  I've been digging and found that in some cases, there have been two solutions that have worked, though neither has for me.  Here's the instruction, apparently issued once the system has booted:\nFirst option -\nCtrl - Alt - F1\n   sudo service lightdm restart\nSecond option -\nF6\n   nomodeset (this often seems to be discussed as some sort of menu option)\n     (There's also mention of Esc followed by adding \"vga = normal\" before a hyphen)\nThere's bound to be a single solution, but it's difficult to filter them out because there are so many incidents where 12.04 seems to have black screen issues.\nIMPORTANT EDIT - apparently there was a marketing decision made sometime back in the Ubuntu boot process.

If he ever has troubles with his installation, he could just put a USB drive in, boot the machine and everything would be resetted for him.\nI know there are many methods of creating/loading an image of a drive, but the ones I've found so far have complicated menus with several options to choose from, etc. Ideally, perhaps only asking a Yes/No question such as \"Would you like to reinstall?\" would be great.\nDoes such a tool exist?\nThank you in advance!\n\nA: As at first glance it seems to be a good idea to have a key that resets a machine to a \"factory\" state, there are some major issues we have to consider before we proceed to do so. \n\n\n*\n\n*User specific settings are stored in /home/user/.  \n\n*Updating or restoring the OS will not touch or restore these.  \n\n*Erroneous user settings are the most frequent cause of trouble, but these will not be repaired by reinstalling.   \n\n*Resetting or deleting /home/user/ is not an option as we will lose important user data (including passwords).\n\n*Replacing the OS by a stored version from USB will restore it to a rather outdated state where many security updates will not be included.\n\n\nTherefore I would like to recommend you to teach the remote user how to make frequent backups of their HOME, and install an easy or eventually automatic backup solution that would make restoring to a previous state easy. Test this for ease of restoring the backups before you give away the machine.\nIf the person you give the machine to agrees then the most convenient additional approach would be to set up the machine to enable remote root access via SSH for administration. I have successfully done so with my 75 years old mother's machine (which was her first computer). By this we are able to solve all minor and even most major problems remotely.

I was trying to get a GUI running, to, and that was really futile.  Too many apps require intel cpus these days.\nIf you're into using the commandline for everything, you can probably do it.  There may still be a community-supported version of Ubuntu available, but nothing official.  Yellow Dog Linux (YDL) is a good candidate, as they are a long-time supporter of PowerPCs.\nIt's something that you probably shouldn't attempt unless you want to learn a lot about Linux, and are willing to spend a lot of time getting it to work.

GRUB gives two options: Linux and recovery mode. \nI tried to open a sessions as root but it says the filesystem is corrupted. I cannot access my files.\nDid I lose all my files?\n\nA: As an alternative to booting a livecd, you could press e at the grub menu to edit the rescue mode entry, and add init=/bin/sh to the kernel arguments.  This will drop you right to a root shell where you can copy the backup file back to the original after remounting the filesystem read-write with mount -o remount,rw /.\n\nA: No, given your description, you did not lose any of your files (except /etc/passwd, which you deleted, but which you had backed up).\nBoot an Ubuntu live CD/DVD or live USB flash drive. Select Try Ubuntu (not Install Ubuntu). When the desktop loads, open a Nautilus (file browser) window. You can find the partition for your Ubuntu system under Devices. Click on it to mount it.\nNow you can restore the backup. You have to do it as root, however. Here's one pretty easy way to do it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T). In the Terminal, type cd and type the Space key, but don't press Enter yet.\n\n*In Nautilus, find the etc directory inside the installed Ubuntu system. (This is not the same as the etc directory for the live CD. The etc directory inside the installed Ubuntu system is in the partition you just mounted.)\n\n*Drag this etc directory into the Terminal, which will paste its full path into the Terminal, completing the cd ... command.\n\n*Press Enter to run the command. Now you're in the directory that contained your passwd file. I am assuming that your backup file, passwd_bkp, is also located here.\n\n*Run this command:\nsudo cp passwd_bkp passwd\n\nThat restores the passwd file from your backup, so now you should be able to reboot, remove the CD/DVD or USB flash drive, and boot back into your installed Ubuntu system. Your installed Ubuntu system should work again.\n\nFor the future, you should be aware that it is not recommended to manually edit /etc/passwd, /etc/group, /etc/shadow, or /etc/gshadow. Instead, you should use the utilities provided as part of Ubuntu to make any changes you need to users and groups on your system. You're probably aware that you can edit this in System Settings or with users-admin. But there are also very powerful command-line utilities for this, which are still much safer and easier than manually editing the configuration files yourself. Here's documentation on the most relevant such utilities in Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*adduser / addgroup\n\n*deluser / delgroup\n\n*usermod\n\n*groupmod\n\n*useradd (lower-level than adduser, you should usually use adduser instead)\n\n*userdel (lower-level than deluser, you should usually use deluser instead)\n\n*groupadd (lower-level than addgroup, you should usually use addgroup instead)\n\n*groupdel (lower-level than delgroup, you should usually use delgroup instead)\n\n*passwd\n\n*gpasswd\n\n*pwck\n\n*grpck\nYou can change your username with some of those utilities. This answer explains one way in detail. However, you should be aware (as is currently touched on by a comment there) that some applications assume your username remains the same. So changing your username might cause some problems.\n\nA: You should read first Eliah Kagan's answer, before continuing reading this answer. He explains how to deal with the situation and why it is usually not necessary to change /etc/passwd manually.\nAnyhow if you really know what you are doing and you need to edit /etc/passwd manually, you can do it, but still you should not simply change the files with your favourite editor. Instead there is the tool\nvipw\n\nFrom the man pages:\nThe vipw and vigr commands edits the files /etc/passwd and /etc/group,\nrespectively. With the -s flag, they will edit the shadow versions of those\nfiles, /etc/shadow and /etc/gshadow, respectively. The programs will set\nthe appropriate locks to prevent file corruption.\n\nFor e.g. if you want to change a users UID, as far as I know, to edit the files manually, is the only way. Also if you want to change a users password and then back to its previous without knowing it, there is no way with usermod or so. But if you save the hashed password form the shadow file, then change the user's password you can afterwards add the hashed password again editing the shadow file with vipw -s.\n\nA: After following @EliahKagan's answer I could not login from lightdm and my account wasn't listed. I discovered that the permission of the passwd file was not set up properly; the lightdm user did not have access to it. Here's how I fixed it:.\nLog in on a tty Ctrl+Alt+F1 \nchange to the /etc directory\ncd /etc\n\nThen change the permissions to 644\nsudo chmod 644 passwd\n\nThen do ls -la\nthe permission string should look like this\n-rw-r--r--\n\n\nA: If you can login just open terminal and try this :\nsudo cp /etc/passwd- /etc/passwd\nsudo chmod 644 /etc/passwd\n\nElse\nBoot  into recovery mode  or from Ubuntu live Cd . Then, mount your old drive:\nmkdir /olddrive\nmount /dev/hda5 /olddrive\nassuming that your old drive is on /dev/hda5.\nthen, cd to /olddrive/etc\ntype:\necho \"root::0:0:Superuser:/:/bin/bash\" > passwd\n\nthen reboot. That will set no passwd for root. \nThen, you can login, create all of your accounts over again, etc.\nYou may also use the back up which is called (I think) /etc/passwd-\nEdit:(another method I haven't tried before but I think it should work also)\n\n\n*\n\n*Start GRUB on boot (press Esc while booting)\n\n*Press e over (recovery mode)\n\n*Press e over the line beginning with kernel\n\n*Press Space and enter init=/bin/bash\n\n*Press Enter\n\n*Press b\n\n*At command prompt type: cp /etc/passwd- /etc/passwd\n\n*Reboot to GRUB again\n\n*Press e over (recovery mode)\n\n*Press e over the line beginning with kernel\n\n*Press Space and enter init=/bin/bash\n\n*Press Enter\n\n*Press b\n\n*At command prompt type mount -o remount,rw /\n\n*Type passwd YOURUSERNAMEHERE (If you don't know your username type ls /home (that is a Lower case L and lower case S) for a list of users)\n\n*Enter new password at prompt\n\n*Reboot to normal boot.\n\n\nSource\n", "Q: Dell XPS 13 Hangs up if attach an external Monitor I have an Dell XPS 13 Ultrabook with Ubuntu 12.04. its works pretty well, but if I attach my Apple Cinema Display with the Mini Display Port then hangs the Notebook up.\nIts totally randomly.

And see if the situation is improved.\n\nA: I concur with Tim, you can ping but not resolve, then it is a DNS issue.  you need to have a line \"\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\n\" at the top or your /etc/resolv.conf file so it is the first server it looks to for resolving DNS queries.  However if your default gateway is incorrect then you will not be able to get out your local network, so if you can ping 8.8.8.8 that is all good and working so must be DNS.   so edit the /etc/resolv.conf file and see whats at the top of that. \nIf this is for your desktop then i would recommend using the GUI from the task bar to set all that info.  \n", "Q: Touch screen support Asus EP121 Has anyone installed 12.04 on the Asus EP121, and if so, what works?\nOf all things, the touch screen would be the most important.

I had it connecting to the network before the problem as I was running updates and using apt-get. Having followed the same steps as I did yesterday and installing the same packages the machine is working without any problems. \nThe only thing I can think of is that either Hyper-V has corrupted the installation at some point or that there have been problems when the machine has gone into hibernation overnight. I've suffered problems with network connectivity after hibernation with Hyper-v & Ubuntu before but that was on an older version of the software and a re-start of the Ubuntu virtual server stopped the problem - this did not work today and the rebuild was the only solution.\nI'd like to thank Pl1nk for sparing his time and taking me through all of the various network settings of the Ubuntu box as he tried to solve this problem.\n", "Q: Sound devices refuse to work on root GUI login (11.10) The GUI for configuration shows an absence of any sound devices.

Any help?\n\nA: This can easily happen when connecting to a computer who's host keys in /etc/ssh have changed if that computer was upgraded without copying its old host keys. The host keys here are proof when you reconnect to a remote computer with ssh that you are talking to the same computer you connected to the first time you accessed it.\nIf the remote computer is within your control you probably know if it was updated and the host keys not copied. If so, and if the system is on your LAN you can be pretty safe in ignoring or circumventing this error message. You probably know its IP address with certainty and know there are no trojan devices on it.\nIf the computer is not within your control but you are certain that it has been upgraded it may also be reasonable to circumvent this error message. (If the remote host publishes the hashes of its ssh host keys you may be able to check these to be safer, or you can call the server's management to obtain the host key fingerprint).\nIf the computer is within your control you should copy the old host keys from /etc/ssh to the new system as part of your upgrade procedure. (N.B. there are both key files and configuration files in this directory.)\nOnce you know you want to ignore this condition there are at least 2 ways to deal with this issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*Pass the StrictHostKeyChecking in the SSH command such as (example) :\n\n\nssh -o 'StrictHostKeyChecking no' user@host\nYou'll have to do this each time. Or ...\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the offending ssh key (real example taken from your answer) :\n\n\nsed -i '4d' /home/users/myaccount/.ssh/known_hosts\nThis is the more permanent solution. Instead of giving you the above message you will be given the option to accept the new hostkey from the server, just as you did the very first time you connected to it. Verify the best you can that you are connecting to the correct remote computer, without going through an intermediary, and then accept the new host key.\n\nA: You have to remove the 4th ssh key from /home/users/myaccount/.ssh/known_hosts file.\n\nA: It seems that you copied your ssh-folder from an old system to your new one.\nOpen terminal and type in:\nrm /home/USERNAME/.ssh/known_hosts\n\nThis will delete all the \"old\" keys.\n", "Q: Super Key doesn't work on Kubuntu 12.04 I have Kubuntu 12.04 installed on HP 430 Notebook PC.

The setup of the node is all handled by maas server. It seems like a simple error of looking at the wrong key or looking in the wrong places, only other suggestions I can find are to destroy the environment and rebuild (but that didn't work umpteen times now) or leave it to build the instance once the node has powered up, but I have left for a few hours, and left overnight to build with no luck. \n\n\nA: The solution I came up with is to set a password for the newly-booted nodes, and then manually insert SSH keys into each of them. To set a boot password for the ubuntu user, ensure that the following lines to /var/lib/cobbler/kickstarts/maas.preseed:\nd-i    passwd/make-user boolean true\nd-i    passwd/user-fullname ubuntu\nd-i    passwd/username string ubuntu\nd-i    passwd/user-password-crypted password <CRYPTED PASSWORD>\n\nOnce this is done, you can ssh ubuntu@ and use the password specified in the crypted password string (easiest way is to use one from an /etc/shadow file you already know) to log in. You can then insert your SSH public keys under ~ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys and ~root/.ssh/authorized keys.\nNote that this is a workaround- once you ssh-keygen, MaaS should either be pulling the id_rsa.pub from your .ssh directory, or from the MaaS WebUI, where the user can specify a public key in his profile. No matter what I've tried, these keys aren't propagated, so I came up with the workaround.\nA further cheat is to just add the .pub key to your MaaS node's .ssh/authorized_keys and then scp it to each of the nodes in the MaaS:\nfor i in `cobbler system list |grep -v default`; \n    do j=`cobbler system dumpvars --name \"${i}\" | grep hostname |grep -v duplicate |cut -f 2 -d \\:`; \n    scp ~/.ssh/authorized_keys ubuntu@${j}:.ssh/authorized_keys;\ndone\n\nThis leaves you able to just repeatedly accept the SSH certificate errors and type the password in the crypted string to populate your entire MaaS with the SSH public key.\n\nA: Ensure that you're generating your SSH keys on the same host as you're using juju from, and add the public half of your SSH key(s) on that machine into MAAS (try: ls ~/.ssh/*.pub to find them all). There shouldn't be any need to manually put keys into ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.\nThe getting started with Juju guide may help if you've not seen that.\n\nA: I'm facing the same problem. Two days ago I started to look out for a answer and the most significant thing I found out is this:\n\nWhen running \"juju status\" you may encounter an error that says\n  \"Invalid SSH key\"\nThe most likely source of this error is that the nodes that juju\n  started up have not finished booting and installing yet. This can\n  happen when the clock on the node is too far out of sync for the OAuth\n  verification to work, which results in the node timing out when trying\n  to download from the metadata service and eventually continues booting\n  to a login prompt without running the Juju preseed.\nTry checking the clock on the node and reset it if it's very different\n  from the MAAS server's clock.\nhttps://answers.launchpad.net/maas/+faq/1979\n\nThis really fixed this problem. I ran ntpdate on my MAAS server and installed the new node, now works great!\n\nA: Ensure that you leave plenty of time for the node to install after bootstrap; it can take 10s of minutes to complete the Ubuntu installation. The error messages appear to indicate that juju is trying to connect to a machine that is not yet running sshd, which to me indicates that the installer is probably still running.\n", "Q: Unable to use HP LaserJet 1010 as network printer after upgrade to 12.04 Since I upgraded all three computers to Ubuntu 12.04, I am unable to use my HP LaserJet-1010 as a network printer.

ATI driver from AMD website, but failed and ended up just like when i try install the 3.4 kernel, the kernel not working with binary driver.\nThen i remove the fglrx using guide from here http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Oneiric_Installation_Guide#Removing_Catalyst.2Ffglrx and run these command\nsudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx fglrx_* fglrx-amdcccle* fglrx-dev*\nsudo apt-get

google and arrived on this link http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1988444 that said there is a patch that can make fglrx work on kernel 3.4, and i try the solutions but once again the kernel

post only 2 hyperlink..\nThanks for the concern, i appreciate it..\n\nA: It appears to me that it is fglrx, the proprietary ATI binary driver, that isn't compatible with the 3.4 kernel. dkms is trying to process the headers for interfacing with it. I assume its trying to compile an interface module.\nThis makes a certain amount of sense since Ubuntu gets new vendor drivers sometime in the development cycle for new releases and 3.4 isn't in a production Ubuntu release. I believe the Ubuntu kernel team's website mentions that binary only drivers might not be compatible with these packages.\nSince you are experimenting I'd suggest that you remove the fglrx driver and use the default radeon one in your current system, and then try the updgrade again. Without fglrx installed there shouldn't be a dkms hook to rebuild anything fglrx related.\nAfter you get it going you might look to the quantal archives for a more up to date fglrx package that would be compatible with the 3.4 kernel. Then you will really be on the cutting edge (or really out on a limb).\nYou might also see Nvidia drivers don't work with mainline kernel for what someone using an nvidia proprietary driver did.\nIf it's any encouragement I was able to upgrade to 3.5 for a while in the last week, but I don't run fglrx. I did have to reinstall a libllvm package to keep unity-3d working and never found out why.\n\nA: As far as I know, AMD recently released catalyst driver version 12.6(3-4 days ago), that is compatible to 3.4 kernel. So I suggest you to try uninstall your current \"fglrx\" driver, upgrade your kernel and then install the latest kernel. Please post your findings, as I am also looking for the solution to over-heating. Heard that kernel 3.4 has some automatic cpu scaling capabilities\n\nA: ERROR (dkms apport): kernel package linux-headers-3.4.0-030400-generic-pae is not supported\nError! Bad return status for module build on kernel: 3.4.0-030400-generic-pae (i686)\n\nI seems that your computer is not compatible with PAE, so you need to compile the Linux kernel yourself. This link may help you: http://verahill.blogspot.com.es/2012/05/compiling-kernel-34-on-debian.html\n\nA: You have the answer there: kernel package linux-headers-3.4.0-030400-generic-pae is not supported\n", "Q: rhythmbox-scope consuming lots of memory I've noticed that rhythmbox-scope for unity-hud's music-lens is taking something above 18% of my memory all the time without doing anything useful.\nActually using it for searching music doesn't change the consumption rate in any way. It's rock steady at 18,xx %, thus making it the worst memory eater on my entire system.\nI'm using a Samsung R710 notebook with 4GB ram (which should be enough IMHO) with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nAny suggestions on how to lower this memory usage other than uninstalling the music-lens or rhythmbox-scope would be very much appreciated.\nThanks in advance for any useful answer!\nBTW: Rhythmbox itself is quite memory hungry as well, making it choke every now and then on title change. Perhaps this is somehow related?\n\nA: If you are using rhythmbox-scope from https://launchpad.net/~markjtully/+archive/ppa, then you may be using something you do not actually require.  The main music lens includes support for rhythmbox by default in 12.04.  \nrhythmbox-scope may be removed from your system using the Software Centre, or by entering\nsudo apt-get remove rhythmbox-scope\nLog out and log back in again to complete the process.  You should still be able to search your music using the music lens's included rhythmbox support, hopefully with lower memory usage (look for unity-music-daemon in System Monitor).\nrhythmbox-scope is a holdover from Ubuntu 11.10 (where it was required to search Rhythmbox) and the early development of Ubuntu 12.04, before it was included in the main music lens by default, rewritten using vala rather than python.  I suspect it uses so much memory because it maintained its own list of music in memory (though 700-800 Mb still seems excessive, even for 34,000 songs).  It may also be conflicting with the main music lens (as both are essentially trying to do the same thing).  I have stopped development of this scope of this scope since it is now redundant.  I really should also remove it from my ppa.\n", "Q: Google Maps OpenGL 3D makes my system unstable (hangup) Running Ubuntu 12.04LTS.  I tried to load Google Maps with the OpenGL 3D new functionality.

Using Ubuntu 12.04. I would like to choose kile as the default application for tex files, but I run into problems. I go through\n\"right click\" -> properties -> open with -> show other applications\nbut kile is not in the list, so how can I choose kile?\nAm I missing something obvious?\n\nA: The answer given by Yusuf is correct but in my case it was incomplete. Since I had no Kile.desktop file in my /usr/share/applications (the .desktop association is hidden, as Cumulus007 points out), I had to create it and simply writing Exec=kile %F isn't enough. This is what I put inside the Kile.desktop file I created using Yusuf's instructions:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Kile\nComment=LaTeX front end\nExec=kile %f\nTerminal=false\nIcon=/usr/share/pixmaps/kile.xpm\nType=Application\nCategories=Office;Database\nMimeType=text/x-bibtex\n\nThis finally allowed me to select Kile as the default application to open .tex files.\n\nA: Open the application desktop file in /usr/share/applications and check if the \"Exec\" line end with this value: \"%F\". If that is not the case, then you'll have to append this value to this line. Here is the command used to edit the desktop file:\ngksu gedit /usr/share/applications/<filename>.desktop\n\nchange the exec line from\nExec=kile\n\nto\nExec=kile %F\n\nand then Kile appears in the list.\n\nA: Open the application desktop file (in this case, kile.desktop) in \"/usr/share/applications\" and check if the Exec line ends with this: %F. If that is not the case, then you'll have to append this value to this line (with a prepending space, if needed). Here is the command used to edit the desktop file:\ngksu gedit /usr/share/applications/kile.desktop\n\nor\ngksu gedit /usr/share/applications/kde4/kile.desktop\n\nHere kde4 might be something else.\nchange the exec line from:\nExec=kile\n\nto:\nExec=kile %F\n\nand then Kile should appear in the list.\n\nA: Kile isn't default in \"Ubuntu\". You need to install it (and its Qt/KDE dependencies) yourself using a Software manager or sudo apt-get install kile. If you wish, you can first run apt-get install -s --no-install-recommends kile to see, as a simulation, what else will come with Kile even without the recommends.  \nAfter you've installed Kile, it's possible you still won't see it as an option in the context menu as you have experienced. That may be a consequence of missing a .desktop file as described in detail here: How do I set kile as the default application for .tex files?.\n\nA: My situation was a little different, but I believe the answer could be helpful here. \nI am using ubuntu 16.04; the default application for opening .tex files was RStudio (i.e. when double-clicking on a tex file, it was opened in RStudio). The kile.desktop file already had the Exec=kile %F ending. To open a foo.tex file with kile (or texmaker) I had to right-click, and choose open with.\nThe permanent solution to change the deafult program for me was:\n\n\n*\n\n*open Files\n\n*right click on the .tex file\n\n*go to Properties\n\n*go to Open With\n\n*click on Texmaker (or Kile) and click set as default\nI don't know how to do this in the command line. \n", "Q: How to install a program with a graphical installer in Ubuntu 12.04?

I also installed grub.\n\n\nNow when I boot my MB only the grub menu shows up. When I select OS X under grub I see a black screen for a while and the machine restarts (when selecting OS X 64 bit) or it hangs indefinitely(OS X 32 bit). Could you please help?\nLink to output of boot info script. http://paste.ubuntu.com/1028017/\n\nA: Try holding down the Option key (or Alt if you're using a PC keyboard) when you hear the chime early in the boot process. That should produce a boot menu that will enable you to boot to OS X. You can then re-install rEFIt (or switch to rEFInd, which is my updated fork of rEFIt, since rEFIt hasn't been updated in over two years). This should fix the problem.\nIf using Option or Alt doesn't give you a boot menu, try using a rEFIt or rEFInd boot CD. (Both projects have them, but the rEFIt CD is more likely to work on a Mac.) Again, you might need to hold down Option or Alt to see the CD as a boot option. Once booted, you can (re-)install rEFIt or rEFInd.\nIf neither of these approaches work, I see three others, but they all carry some risk:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can move or rename the /boot/efi/efi/ubuntu/grubx64.efi file from Ubuntu. This is GRUB, and moving/renaming it will, with any luck, force the Mac's firmware to look for other boot options, and it should find the standard OS X boot loader. Once you're in OS X, you can mount the ESP (\"mkdir -p /boot/efi && sudo mount_msdos /dev/disk0s1 /boot/efi\"), move GRUB back to its normal location and name, and (re-)install rEFIt or rEFInd. The risk is that if the firmware can't find the OS X boot loader for some reason, your system won't boot at all until you use an emergency disc to correct matters, or maybe even until you re-install an OS.\n\n*You can do much as above, but copy the rEFIt or rEFInd files into /boot/efi/efi/ubuntu, renaming refit.efi or refind_x64.efi to grubx64.efi. When you reboot, rEFIt or rEFInd should appear, and depending on which you use and what you do with the original grubx64.efi, you might even be able to boot both OSes right off the bat. The drawback is that subsequent GRUB updates might wipe out your changes.\n\n*You can try using the efibootmgr program to adjust your EFI boot loader configuration to move rEFIt back to the top spot (or to give rEFInd the top spot, if you try to install it). The risk is that efibootmgr has been reported to corrupt the firmware on at least some Mac models. My impression is that this problem has been corrected with post-3.0 kernels, but I haven't found anything authoritative on this. In any event, if you try this, either read the efibootmgr man page and issue the necessary commands to reset rEFIt to be the default, or download rEFInd and use its install.sh script to install rEFInd, which will also use efibootmgr to make it the default boot loader.\n\n\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Upgrade Ubuntu 11.10 to 12.04LTS \nPossible Duplicate:\nProblem on upgrade from 11.10 to 12.4 with CD \n\nHello ! \nAfter installing and checking few times for packages that are not in Ubuntu 11.10.

If you want a video file (e.g. .m4v) instead of an .iso, use handbrake after ripping the entire DVD (don't forget to install libdvdcss!).\nThere are ways to reduce the number of steps, but this seems to be more robust than alternatives.\nI've been especially happy with the archlinux documentation.\nP.S. I suspect that most of the answers were excellent at the time of writing, but I found them to be unhelpful at the time I'm writing this, so I thought I'd write an answer that works for me in case others are finding this question around the same time that I did.\n\nA: I have extracted to an .iso file with k3b (KDE based tool)\nK3b Main Menu -> Tools -> Copy Medium\nOn the left, check \"Create image\" if not already checked\nand uncheck \"Remove image\" if it checked.\nClick on the Image tab and pick a path for\n\"Write image file to:\"\nE.g. \"/home/me/tmp/myDvd.iso\"\nClick \"Start\"\nThen just cancel the copy after the file has been extracted.\n\nA: I used to use dd to rip my DVDs in the past, it required libdvdcss to work though.\nsudo apt-get install libdvd-pkg\n\n\nA: D1g1ta1's answer about using bs=# count=# at the end of the dd command successfully created 4.6GB .iso files of my 4.6GB DVD (of a Qubes OS 4.0 .iso). However upon calculating the sha256 hash, I found that the contents for some reason turned out different.\nUsing dd if=discDrive of=disc.iso, without parameters, works normally and produces and correct hash values. Before, my drive was acting up and it was producing the wrong hash value; in addition, before, my disc drive was not creating the full 4.6GB iso. I think my drive is just broken.\nK3b is a GUI program. I found it successfully creates .iso files and the hashes calculated of the resulting .iso files are correct!\nThe Brasero program also works and the resulting .iso files are also correct.\n\nA: There was a previous attempt to provide a \"complete\" answer, but it did not take CSS copy protection into account. So here's my attempt at a follow-up. I am taking the approach of trying the lightest touch first, and then moving on to increasingly aggressive approaches only as circumstances warrant.\nIf the DVD does not use CSS (content scramble system) encryption, then the simple dd command recommended in other answers will work.\n(All code snippets are borrowed from previous answers)\n# isoinfo -d -i /dev/sr1 | grep -i -E 'block size|volume size'\nLogical block size is: 2048\nVolume size is: 2264834\n\n# dd if=/dev/sr1 of=backup.iso bs=[Logical Block Size from above] count=[Volume size from above]\n\nIf the disc does use CSS encryption, but no other tricks such as \"fake\" bad blocks, then the dd command by itself may not work. This is because the firmware inside most DVD drives will recognize the presence of CSS encryption, and will refuse to allow low-level read access to any sectors that are marked as subject to copyright protection. You must use a program which invokes the DeCSS library (or something equivalent) to \"unlock\" the disc in the drive's firmware first, and then the dd command can do its job. The DeCSS library is not included by default a fresh Ubuntu installation, but there are instructions in the \"Restricted Formats\" section of the Ubuntu Wiki to install it. Be aware that using this software may carry legal consequences in some jurisdictions.\n# apt install libdvd-pkg && dpkg-reconfigure libdvd-pkg\n# apt install mplayer\n# mplayer -dvd-device /dev/sr0 dvd:// -vo null -ao null -ss 10 -endpos 1\n\nNow continue with the isoinfo and dd commands above\nIf the disc has both CSS encryption and additional protective measures such as fake bad blocks, then just unlocking the disc in the drive's firmware is not enough. Even though it is perfectly normal for such a disc to present unrecoverable errors when you attempt to read these fake bad blocks, the video content itself is actually completely intact. However, the normal dd command would likely abort at the first such block it encounters. ddrescue would be your friend in that case.\n# apt install gddrescue\n\nUse the instructions above to use a DeCSS-enabled player app to unlock the drive's firmware. Instead of moving on to isoinfo and dd, use ddrescue:\n# ddrescue --no-scrape /dev/sr0 backup.iso\n\n\nA: mkisofs -pad -J -R -oDVD.iso -graft-points \"/AUDIO_TS=/media/sr0/AUDIO_TS\" \"/VIDEO_TS=/media/sr0/VIDEO_TS\"\n\nmount -t iso9660 -o loop,ro DVD.iso /mnt\n\ngrowisofs -dvd-compat -Z /dev/dvd=DVD.iso -speed=2\n\n", "Q: Nautilus Folders Turned Chinese I am running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with GNOME Shell 3.4.

Here's a list from easiest to hardest:\nFirst Option: Ubuntu Software Center\nLocated in Menu->Ubuntu Software Center.If you are using Unity, open the dash and type software,then the software center will appear.\n\nThen click on the search box at the top right to search for an application(eg if you type \"Ge\" -> gedit will show up).\nAlternately, click on a category such as Developer Tools and search for the software you want to install.\nWhen you find it,click on the \"Install\" button at the top right,(or \"use source\" if you just installed ubuntu), enter your password for verification and wait for the software to install.\n\nSecond Option: Installation of .deb files\nSince all the apps at ubuntu software center are in fact .deb files,you can search for a .deb file at the internet,download it and then when you choose to open it choose \"Open with Ubuntu Sofware Center\"\n\nThird Option: Installation of source files (tar.gz,tar.gz2 etc)\nThat is more like a terminal job rather than easy installation clicks.\n1)First of all,after downloading the source file,unzip it with the archive manager and save the unzipped folder of the file somewhere(eg the Desktop)alternatively you can type the command:\n$tar -zxvf program.tar.gz\n$tar -zjvf program.tar.bz2  \n\n2) Run as root by typing sudo -i , then type your password.\n3)Change to the directory of the folder(if you have the folder at the desktop type cd /home/your_user_name/Desktop/your_file_name\n4)Type ./configure\n5)Type make\n6)Type make install\n\nA: XAMPP is just a bundle of existing tools, all of which can be installed individually from the Ubuntu Software Center.  By using the version from the Ubuntu repositories, security upgrades and other updates will be taken care of for you, and you know they've been tested to work with the rest of your specific system.  \nFrom inside of your VM, the command-line install for the basic webserver with PHP, perl, and mysql installed:\nsudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-php5 libapache2-mod-perl libapache2-mod-auth-mysql mysql-server mysql-client php5 php5-mysql perl\n\nFor the other packages that XAMPP installs that you may or may not need (pick and choose as needed):\nsudo apt-get install webalizer proftpd php5-curl php5-gd php5-imap php5-mcrypt php5-mhash php5-ming php5-sqlite\n\nYou would need to do some additional configuration of each, but you would need to do that with XAMPP as well.  I've left out some of the more oscure things that XAMPP seems to bundle - check http://packages.ubuntu.com to see if you can find them as well. \n\nA: There is kind of a hierarchy for installing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a Package Manager to install automagically from a repository. That Package Manager might be Software Centre, Synaptic or something else.\n\n*Download a .deb. Install it by right clicking on the .deb and installing with Gdebi\n\n*As a last recourse unpack or compile from a .tar\n\n\nLook particularly at \"Installing Software in Ubuntu\" - http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/installingsoftware\nBasic Toolkit\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the Linux Starter Pack - http://www.tuxradar.com/linuxstarterpack\n\n*Look at the UNOFFICIAL Ubuntu Guide - http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Oneiric\n\n*Look at Psychocats - http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu\n\n*Download the Ubuntu Pocket Guide and Reference - http://www.ubuntupocketguide.com/index_main.html\n\n*Download Ubuntu 11.10 Manual - http://ubuntu-manual.org/\n\nA: I think part of the problem here could be that you downloaded the files to your system, then started the VM running Ubuntu.  A virtual machine doesn't get any access to the rest of your hard drive other than what you give it- A virtual machine runs on a virtual drive isolated from the rest of your system.\nYou'll need to make a shared directory that the VM can access and put the files there, or copy them over by some other means such as a USB stick.  You could have also downloaded and installed the programs directly into Ubuntu on the Virtual Machine.  Eclipse is available in the repositories, however there's little more required than downloading the archive and unzipping it.\n", "Q: Is there any encoder for ubuntu like Windows Media Encoder I`m looking for something like Windows Media Encoder.  Which I use for broadcasting.  The reason is that Windows Media Encoder series  is for windows and no support Ubuntu OS.\nI want to boradcast the addressing of one person live.\nPlease help... \n\nA: If what you want to do is just broadcast a video, I would recommend using a service like LiveStream (my favorite) or UStream. In fact I would setup and have both ready in case one has issues with the servers so that you can swap in case one fails. They work on all platforms. All you need is a browser and a camera (can be a webcam). You can find a couple examples in my LiveStream channel.  \nIf you just want to transcode a file you can use WinFF or AutoFF. They are both based on FF-Mpeg. \nTo edit video the best tools is KDEnlive.\n\nA: I would recommend VLC media player.  I would also Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command below.\napt-cache search encoder\n\nwill give you an idea of the staggering list of choices.  I would also look at Fluendo\n", "Q: Shell Scripting for Linux Server Administration I recently started learning Linux(Ubuntu), and i'm aware that Linux has it's own form of language i.e Shell Scripting. What i'll like to know is that is this language enough to administer a Linux Server? I can also code in PHP/MySQL and i'll also like to do some standalone app for Linux based PC (not with PHP/MySQL), will Shell Scripting be enough for me to achieve these.?\nThank you for your time, patience and answer. I most appreciate it.\n\nA: Yes and No. Shell scripting will help you administrate a server and automate tasks.\nYou will not be able to build Applications with shell scripting. Something like python would be better for building software apps in Linux. Or possibly C++ and Qt framework. Shell scripting is used to automate services and tasks at low level on server. Not build apps.\n\nA: Here are the books that I have found most useful on the topic:  \nLinux shell scripting with bash.  It's a great guide.  \nLearning BASH shell from O'Reilly.  I generally like almost all O'Reilly books.  \nAs noted by previous answers, you can certainly administer a server using solely bash scripting.  Python with gtk/qt extensions is more app-targeted.  \nIt is my personal opinion that HTML5 applications based on Ext4JS or SenchaTouch are the ultimate future of desktop applications.  \nSenchaTouch Apps can already be packaged for multiple touch devices.  There is a product in closed beta to package for desktop from the same vendor(reference).  \n\nA: Depending on the standalone application you are making, it may be.\nSome applications to do a series of tasks based on currently-installed technologies can be done in Bash or Shell scripts, others need slightly more complex scripts.\nBut actual applications with GUIs that do tasks that current applications do not would need more in depth coding, whether its Python, Perl, Ruby, C, C++, etc.\n", "Q: Why after a time of inactivity three cores of cpu go off?

I cancelled gparted operation by mistake.Now one of the partition became corrupted,what to next? Should I format it?

Take the time to go through the Guide from CGSecurity that leads you through the steps you will have to take.\nTake extra care to not overwrite other existing partitions. If your backups are old, it may now be a good idea to backup other partitions on that drive before you try recovery. Running testdisk is also possible on an image of your drive.\nIn case the partition recovery fails then you are able to recover your files with photorec (which is installed with testdisk). This will recover the content from all your data files but directories, file names, and permissions will unforunately be lost.\n", "Q: how to safely Uninstall Ubuntu 12.04 and reinstall 11.10 \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to roll back Ubuntu to a previous version? \n\nI upgraded from 11.10 to 12.04 following the instructions here. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PreciseUpgrades. But after the upgrade a lot of my image processing packages don't work some of their dependencies have been removed. Honestly there is not that much difference between 11.10 and 12.04. So please can someone tell me how to safely remove 12.04 and go back to 11.10 without losing documents, and source packages on my old Ubuntu. Thanks\n\nA: There is a rather lengthy HowTo here. It comes with its own disclaimer so I won't bother with that. BUT before you do that, read here why that is probably a BAD idea.\nIt is probably a much better idea to simply backup your files and re-install ubuntu if you can't figure out a way to make 12.04 work for you.\n", "Q: How to install python-igraph? I am following these instructions to install python-igraph. Adding PPA words and update works. But the install complains of the following:\n\nCouldn't find any package whose name or description matched \"python-igraph\"\n\n\nA: The problem is, there is no python-igraph package for 12.04. Because of that, you get the error when you try to install it in 12.04. You can check the PPA for yourself. \nIt does have a package for 11.10 though. If you are desperate, you can download the deb package meant for 11.10 and install it manually. Hopefully, you can install it without much dependency problem.\n\nA: I think it's better you to build it from source like in the Debian Lenny section, present in igraph wiki.\nFollow this link: http://igraph.wikidot.com/installing-python-igraph-on-linux#toc2\n", "Q: Changing mouse behaviour in EOG When I open a photo in eog I can easily zoom with the mouse mouse wheel.

I'm logged into a server as user \"ubuntu\" and I've got files that look like this:\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 www-data www-data 33150 2012-06-04 22:17 file-a.png\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 www-data www-data 36371 2012-06-04 22:15 file-b.png\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 www-data www-data 41439 2012-06-04 22:16 file-c.png\n\nThe ubuntu user is a member of the group www-data:\ngroups ubuntu\n\nproduces\nubuntu : ubuntu www-data\n\nSo shouldn't I be able to change other permissions since I have access to the file? I'm not an expert on the user/group stuff. So this is just perplexing me.\nI'm trying to run:\nchmod o-r *\nI realize I can do it with sudo, easily, but I'm trying to understand why I can't modify the files without sudo.\n\nA: Only The Owner of a File May Change Its Permissions\nAs jackweirdy commented, only the owner of a file (or root) can change the file's permissions. Being a member of a group that has some kind of access to the file does not impart the ability to change the file's permissions.\nThe idea is that a file is owned by a user (whether that user represents a real person, or not), and that user is the one who decides who gets access to the file. Permissions for access by users (who are not the owner) in the group-owner of the file are controlled by the user who owns the file. If anyone in the file's group-owner could change the file's permissions, this security model would be broken.\nFor example, consider these permissions, as in your specific situation:\n-rw-rw-r--\n\nThe owner can read and write the file but cannot execute it. The users in the group-owner besides the owner of the file can also read and write the file but not execute it. Others may only read the file.\nSuppose www-data (or someone with the ability to run commands as www-data or as root) set those permissions with the intention of keeping other users in the group-owner from executing the file. If other users in the group-owner could change the permissions, they could run:\nchmod g+x file-a.png\n\nAnd then they would gain the ability to execute the file. Such an ability would render group permissions worthless.\nIn contrast, the reason for user permissions, even though the user owns the file, isn't to restrict the owner from doing anything with the file, but is rather to protect the user from doing things with the file they don't want to do. For example, files that aren't programs, or that might be programs but have just been obtained from an untrusted source like the Internet, tend to have the execute bit set to 0 even for the owner, for their own benefit. In this case, it's helpful and necessary for the owner to be able to change this.\nA separate problem with allowing members of the group-owner (who aren't the owner) from changing permissions is that this is a separate ability not accounted for by r, w, or x. Even if the group had read, write, and execute permissions wouldn't necessarily mean that they should be able to change the permissions. (For example, suppose you have a file where the owner is not a member of the group-owner. If members of the group-owner could change the permissions, they could deprive the owner of permissions. The owner could change this back...but this would still break any automated tasks the user had scheduled that use the file.)\nAllowing People to Become The Owner\nWhen a file is owned by a user like www-data who doesn't represent any actual person, you might want to allow some people to perform actions as that user. sudo doesn't just facilitate allowing select users to run commands as root. It also facilitates allowing select users to run command as other specified users. You could set things up so that everyone in the www-data group has the ability to run commands as the www-data user, including changing permissions on files owned by www-data. (Make sure you understand the implications of this, though. Depending on how your system is configured, users in www-data may be able to schedule tasks to run as www-data, and will be able to do anything at all to any file owned by www-data and to any process run as www-data.)\nSee man sudoers for information about how to set this up. If you decide you want to do this and you have trouble, you could post a separate question about it.\nAllowing Non-Owners to Change the File's Permissions?\nI think it may be possible to allow some users who don't own a file to change some or all of the file's permissions, using Access Control Lists. I've hardly used ACLs on Ubuntu though. If you're interested in accomplishing this, you might want to post another question asking if it's possible and, if so, how to do it.\n\nA: Basically, your permissions are allowing the www-data user, or any user within the www-data group Read and Write access only. Only the owner may change the group permissions of a file or directory, and to one of which the user is apart of.\nIn your situation, Ubuntu cannot change the permissions because Ubuntu doesn't own those files, and has no right to do so, only www-data or root may otherwise change this.\n", "Q: How to make Evolution mail work with my work email address? this is the 1st time to write here and the 1st time to use a mail client other than outlook.

I desperately need it to work, and don't want to downgrade to 32-bit. \nUPDATE: I ran /opt/GuitarPro6 !$ ldd ./GuitarPro and it reported that libGL.so.1 was 'not found'\nI found the file(s) in the nvidia-current directory, and placed them in /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/mesa/\nThe issue now is, how can I tell Guitar Pro 6 where to find them?\n\nA: You just need to install the libglu1-mesa:i386 package. You cannot downgrade the GL library only as used by the system to 32-bit, but you can have both 32-bit and 64-bit versions installed on a 64-bit Ubuntu PC.\n\nA: Please DO NOT MESS WITH SYSTEM FILES DIRECTLY as long as you are not completely sure what you are doing.\nYou do not 'downgraded' the packages - at least I hope so - you should just install the 32-bit libraries too.\nIn case there's a system message like \"openGL installed by driver\": Note it!\nIf you have proprietary nVidia drivers installed, they ship their own openGL implementation. Install those alongside their 32-bit libraries. Install mesa 32-bit.\nThis should work.\nEDIT:\nAnd revert all those changes with copying some librarirs from one place to another! There's a reason to that why they are there.\nIf you do not exactly knoe what you are doing, you probably do not know enough to \"fix\" the system - the problem is not that Ubuntu is (was) broken but that you just did not install all dependencies.\n\nA: I would suggest you to install tuxguitar instead It can read Guitar Pro tabs.\nsudo apt-get install tuxguitar\n\n\nA: Just create a symlink to the file whose name starts with libgl, inside the directory where Guitar Pro was installed.\n", "Q: Set up Java path for terminal \nTrying to set up a path for the terminal. I already have Eclipse running great. Dual os between windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04.

I included a screen shot of some information about my version etc. Any help would be greatly appreciated at this point I've put 10+ hours into this and this is my last resort.\n\nA: Hi actually you are not following the syntax properly .\nTo Compile a java file you have to do\njavac filename.java  and for your case that command will be javac HelloWorld.java\nto Run a Java file  you have to do  \njava filename and for your case java HelloWorld\n\nA: javac HelloWorld \n\nis wrong in that way, that java*c* is a call for the Java*c*ompiler, and you invoke it on a Java source file, which would be HelloWorld.java in your case. \nThen you can't check the version of javac by looking for java or asking java -version. Do javac -version  and which javac instead. \nTo switch between different versions completely, you use \nupdate-java-alternatives \n\nTo switch an individual program (javac but not java or vice versa, or jar or appletviewer and so on)\nupdate-alternatives --set java\n\nWithout the alternatives system you would change the PATH, and insert /usr/lib/jvm/java-7/bin for example, or sort it  before java-1.6.\n", "Q: How to install dbx?

To prevent this from happening, run:\nfind / -xdev -name bar.ova\n\nBy the way, you only need to run it with sudo if you ran the VBoxManage --export ... command with sudo. Otherwise, it's extremely unlikely that VBoxManage could have created a file somewhere you can't read from. You'll get plenty of \"access denied\" messages running find on / without sudo ...but that's not really a problem. If you want to log the results (but not error messages) to a file in your home directory, you can do this:\nfind / -xdev -name bar.ova | tee -a ~/find-results.log\n\nIf you have a separate partition for /home (which only happens if you set it up that way when you install Ubuntu, or deliberately migrate /home to a separate partition after installation), then find on / with -xdev won't search /home (which contains your home directory). The simplest and easiest solution to this is to do a separate find operation on /home:\nfind /home -xdev -name bar.ova\n\nOr just on your home directory in /home, if you don't think you could've put it in another user's home directory:\nfind ~ -xdev -name bar.ova\n\nYou may want to leave off -xdev in these cases, though it's possible you (or other users) have FUSE or GVFS shares mounted inside home directories. (It's also possible a file got saved into one of those shares...)\nWith -xdev, when running find on /, it will still take a while, but it will complete eventually.\nSomething else you may want to try is to run sudo updatedb, wait for that to finish, and then run locate bar.ova.\n\nA: To find a file that's lost somewhere on your filesystem, run the following commands. \nsudo updatedb\nlocate filename.ext\n\n\nExplanation\nupdatedb - Updates the database used by locate.\nlocate - You guessed it. It locates files.\n", "Q: How to make show desktop work only on the current workspace? I am an active user of workspaces in Ubuntu. Until recently, pressing Ctrl+Alt+D (show desktop) acted only on the current workspace. \nFor example, one might want to minimize the applications in the current workspace, open a file, and then bring some of them back. The current implementation works on all workspaces uniformly which is counter-intuitive to me. The reason for the existence of workspaces is the separation of logic -- one can have a browser open in one workspace, a text editor in another, a terminal in a third. \nThe current functionality goes against this idea. Is there a way to restrict the action of the show desktop command to a single workspace only?\n\nA: There is a bug report about this for 12.04. The bug's status is Fix Committed, meaning the fix will only be available in the next release.\nIn the meantime I can only recommend gnome3. There ControlSuperd works as expected.\nIn case you want to give it a try:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell\n\nRestart, and at the login, choose GNOME (first in the list):\n\nWhere to find the show desktop keybinding:\nopen dconf-editor and navigate to schema org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings.\nYou should find a key named show-desktop with its current value.\n", "Q: Can't install Limbo update 1.2-1 Yesterday an update was released for the Humble Indie Bundle game Limbo.\nI have previously installed Limbo through the Software Center.

After startup the fan controller takes control of the fan, I could here it slowing down, after a few second following a login the fan increases its speed again. Though there are no processor hungry process: top shows only Xorg consuming 4%. Even with the system monitor the CPUs load look ok. Is it a power management related problem?\nThis can cause battery life troubles in general, and electronics is never happy to be overheated.\nIs there a better tool to root the cause of the issue?\n\nA: Thank you all for the feedback. \nAfter a few more hours of hacking I concluded that the problem is the graphics card not being properly configured: It wasn't recognized until yesterday's update where I have seen a new Nvida_connect driver. \nNow if I lspci I see the card as a GTX 555 card while the one on my laptop is a newer GT635M. If I play around with the /etc/X11/ config files the display gets messed up. \nThe heating problem is probably due to a bad initialization of the GPU.\nMy conclusion is that I should wait for NVidia to release the proper drivers and the problem will be solved. The other issue still open now, unrelated to this question though, is how Ubuntu 12.04 is handling dual video carded laptops. I'll try and play with that too and post another question later on.\n\nA: With modern operating systems a standard called ACPI is used by an operating system to control power use, hibernation and suspension, fans, thermal control and so on. Some time during boot the operating system uses ACPI information to take over control of these matters from the computers BIOS. It might be worthwhile to try to leave control of this to the BIOS to test whether that helps.\nPerhaps the easiest way to test this would be to choose acpi=off while using a recent Ubuntu live cd. From the initial Ubuntu menu immediately after booting and selecting your language you can use F6 and select this from the pop up menu.\nThen you should be able to listen for the fan speed and feel if the computer grows as hot.\n\nA: The answer to mine is bumblebee. Nvidia does not yet has a solution for it's optimus feature on linux, so the latter is the best solution, or better yet, a 'workaround' as I have read. Correct me if I am wrong.

While installing Windows make sure that you create atleast two partitions, one on which your Windows OS will run and the other on which you will install Ubuntu.\nOnce this is done, use the Ubuntu cd to install your Ubuntu OS on the partition that is not holding your Windows installation. Make sure you choose the custom option when the partitioning schemes are displayed.

This has really come to my mind lately. \nI was checking the Gnome Keyring and then found out that by simply right clicking the login part, one can see every password I have for authentication on Facebook, Google, etc. \nIs there a way I can encrypt/password protect this? Let's say, in an event someone actually finds my laptop open and decides they should enter my social networks?\n\nA: This is encrypted and password protected, but is unlocked when you log on to your computer. Otherwise you would have to enter your password every time it needed to look up a saved password, defeating the purpose. If you are worried about someone finding your laptop and seeing these, as long as you aren't logged in when they get it, they will just see the encrypted file.\nIf you leave your laptop unattended, set your screen to lock when away (using the Birhgtness/Lock) program or simply press CTRL-ALT-L to lock it immediately, which is also available by pressing the login/settings gear and hitting \"Lock Screen\".\nWhen giving your laptop to a friend you don't trust, simply click on your user name and click guest session. That way they won't have any root privileges or be able to see any of your user files.\nI believe you can also set a separate password for your keyring, so it is not unlocked automatically when you log in. Simply right click on \"Passwords: login\" from the Passwords and Keys program, and select \"Change Password\". You will then be asked for that password the first time you use your keyring, but it will stay unlocked for the duration of your session.\n", "Q: Is there any 'Search Software Center' lens? in 12.04 i have noted that there is a lens for almost everything, so i was wondering if there is any such lens to search USC and GetDeb, I also wanted to know if there is a lens to search Custom Website\n\nA: The 'apps available for download' section in the dash when you press super-A is essentially a search USC lens.

It took me a little while to get Google Earth working. The 64-bit Google earth package requires some 32-bit gtk libraries provided by ia32-libs. However, when I ran a simulation to install ia32-libs and it's dependencies, it wanted to remove a ton of programs, including the xubuntu-desktop meta-package. As a work-around, I used getlibs to get the 32-bit libraries I needed, and then installed Google Earth with the deb package and the --ignore-depend option to dpkg. Awesome, Google Earth is installed and is working great!\nNow, however, Update Manager keeps complaining about a \"Partial Upgrade\", and apt-get won't let me install any new applications.

How can I fix this?\n\nA: Looks like I found my own answer, so I'll leave it here in case anyone runs into this same problem.\nSince Google Earth was working fine without the depencies that synaptic thought it needed, I thought I'd try editing the deb file to ignore said dependencies. I used the synaptic package manager to see which dependencies were missing, and then used the videbcontrol script from this great forum post to remove those dependencies from the deb file. I uninstalled the previous package via deb -r googleearth, and then installed the modified package instead. Viola, Google Earth still works great and synaptic is happy :)\n", "Q: View users connected to ad-hoc network I created an ad-hoc network to share my hard-wired connection with other computers/devices, but I can't find anywhere a place that shows the connections.

What your browser will almost certainly do is use regular DNS to resolve www.wikileaks.org to an IP, but then tunnel all traffic to that IP over the proxy. So your ISP (or a sniffer) could tell that you wanted to visit wikileaks.org, but not what page you wanted to see (or saw).\nThe solution is to also tunnel DNS lookups over the proxy.\n\n\n*\n\n*For Firefox, it's as simple as typing about:config and changing the  network.proxy.socks_remote_dns setting  to true.\n\n*Chromium (or Chrome) will only do this if you are using a Socks 5 proxy!\n\n*The global way to do this is to set your DNS using NetworkManager to localhost, where you forward port '53' over SSH to port '53' on the remote DNS server (possibly with your SSH server acting as forwarder).\n", "Q: Default login screen gone, how to revert? i just installed 12.04 and was playing around, i dont remember what i did, now after one logout beautiful default login screen has changed into gray area, help needed\n\nA: Okay heres what to do-\nopen the terminal and enter the following command-\n\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\n\nthen you will get the following screen-\n\nclick on okay.you will get this screen with lightdm as atleast one of the options.-\n\nSelect lightdm.Hit Enter and logout to get the desired screen :)\n", "Q: Why do lp and lpr return unauthorized error?

Just\nsudo apt-get install dir2ogg\ndir2ogg -r /path/to/mp3s/\n\nAnd it recursively finds and converts all mp3 files under /path/to/mp3s/ to ogg (assuming I read the manual correctly).\n\nA: The parsing/replacing of mp3 by ogg is incorrect. The correct form should be:\nfor file in *.mp3;\n\n   do ffmpeg -i \"${file}\" -acodec libvorbis \"${file%mp3}ogg\";\n\ndone\n\n\nA: Use a combination of FFMPEG and String Manipulation.\nChange into the folder where your mp3's are located:\ncd mp3folder\n\nOne example is to use a simple \"for\" loop:\nfor file in *.mp3\n  do ffmpeg -i \"${file}\" \"${file/%mp3/ogg}\"\ndone\n\nThe double quotes prevent spaces in the filenames being treated as 'newlines'.\nffmpeg has several options to include in the conversion like codecs, bitrate, sample size, stereo/mono, etc... The above is the most generic conversion with default settings.\n\nA: Here's one using mplayer I think this is faster than avconv. Although, firefox should play mp3 files natively.    \n#!/bin/bash\nfor f in *.mp3; do\n newname=`echo $f | tr ' ' '_' `\n mv \"$f\" $newname\n f=$newname\n mplayer $f -novideo -ao pcm:file=tmp.wav\n lame -V 0 -q 0 tmp.wav ${f/.mp3/.ogg}\n rm -f tmp.wav\ndone\n\n\nA: Be careful with conversions from MP3, M4A, etc. to OGG because the result may sound poor!\nWarning: Both MP3 and OGG are lossy formats, unlike say WAV or FLAC. This means that they achieve their compression in great part by throwing away bits of audio information that are imperceptible to the human ear (called psychoacoustics [wikipedia])\nWhen you encode (transcode) from one lossy format to another, most of those psychoacoustically redundant bits are already gone, so the transcoding quality will suffer and may even be \"hearable\" in the result. Hence, it isn't recommended to do such conversions unless absolutely necessary.\n\nMinimize the effect if you do so by choosing a higher destination bit-rate than the source bit-rate\nIf you do this MP3-to-OGG conversion, you can minimize the chance of artifacts (poor quality) by using a higher destination bitrate than the source bitrate, e.g if your MP3s are at 128 kbps, try using Ogg at -q7 (variable bitrate level 7), which is usually around ~200 kbps.\nYou can pass the -q option to dir2ogg (available in the repos as @geirha mentioned) which should do what you want.\n\nA: you can use the avconv a gpl program, I did a shell for exemplify (run it on folder with the .mp3 files):\n#!/bin/bash\nif hash avconv > /dev/null; then\n    for file in *.mp3\n        do avconv -i \"${file}\" \"`echo ${file%.mp3}.ogg`\";\n    done\nelse\n    echo \"avconv not found\"\nfi\n\nor a more simple version, without validation of avconv installation:\n#!/bin/bash\nfor file in *.mp3\n    do avconv -i \"${file}\" \"`echo ${file%.mp3}.ogg`\";\ndone\n\n\nA: In case you are doing only audio use the below code [else FF doesn't play the .ogg]\nfor file in *.mp3;\n   do ffmpeg -i \"${file}\" -acodec libvorbis \"${file/%mp3/ogg}\"; \ndone\n\n\nA: There is also soundconverter.

You can open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T and enter the commandsudo chmod a+r the-image.iso to fix that.\nI assume you are using usb-creator-gtk, the standard Ubuntu tool for this. I've had some trouble selecting the iso file I want with that program because of the small window available to select files. Let me suggest starting it from a terminal by using   \nusb-creator-gtk -i the-image.iso\n\n\nA: This was solved for me by removing any .img files from the folder where the desired Ubuntu iso is located. \n So basically, I had an Android boot.img inside the same folder as the Ubuntu 12.04.1 iso, which is what I wanted to use for startup-disk-creator. I moved the boot.img to a separate folder, re-opened startup-disk-creator, and it worked. I don't know if it's a quirk with specifically choosing img files over iso files; or if there is a general issue with having two or more startup-disk compatible files inside the same folder, I just know that isolating the Ubuntu iso from other types of startup files solved the issue for me. \n", "Q: Can we add back track tools to 12.04?

Sometimes it times out with no response at all.\nI have used the default smb.conf and simply added the following for the share I have set up so far:\n[engineering]\ncomment = Ubuntu File Server Share\npath = /networkdriveshares/engineering\nbrowsable = yes\nguest ok = yes\nread only = no\ncreate mask = 0755\n\nI have tried changing the workgroup setting to the Active Domain name our Windows computer use but didn't notice any difference.\nThe only other change I made to the default smb.conf was adding in the recommended socket settings:\n     SO_RCVBUF=8192 SO_SNDBUF=8192\n     socket options = TCP_NODELAY\n\nLots of information about slow Samba shares online but I have tried all of the solutions I have found and none have made a lick of difference. If there is no solution, is there a better way to set up a file server to be used by Windows clients?\n\nA: Try configuring your server without setting SO_RCVBUF and SO_SNDBUF. Ie:\nsocket options = TCP_NODELAY\n\nand nothing else. Or comment out socket options entirely and use Samba's default.\nI had a similar problem with Ubuntu 12.04 and a Mac client on gigabit ethernet. Reading a file was getting about 100kbytes/second, or 300 times too slow. In Ubuntu 11.10 I was setting both buffers to 8192 as you tried. But when I upgraded to 12.04 I found I had to remove that setting to get performance back to where it should be (about 30mbytes/second, the disk speed).\nAnother solution I've seen suggested is to set max protocol = NT1. I tried that first and it didn't help me.\n", "Q: How can I get lp and lpr to run as if I were root? This post is related to Why do lp and lpr return unauthorized error? However, I am asking this question to find a workaround to my problem.\nI can use lp and lpr using sudo. I'd like to know how I can change permissions, so applications can run lp and lpr as if they were root. For that matter, I'd like to be able to do the same thing.\nI've entered a bug on launchpad to cover this, but have not heard back.\nThanks. \n\nA: Without knowing what is causing your problem it's hard to devise a good workaround.\nI should add that I'm not sure applications normally execute the lp or lpr commands in order to print. I assume they use a library interface. An example would be this.\nWhile it's not recommended for security reasons, you can set permissions so that when you run lpr or lp command, they run with the same permission as the user-id they belong to or the group they belong to (root):\nsudo chmod u+s /usr/bin/lp /usr/bin/lpr\n\nWhether or not it helps applications print it should help you use these commands without using sudo each time, assuming you decide to bear the risk.

Maybe it's even the mouse configs I currently have on the laptop that interacts strangely with 3D environments.\n\nA: I had the same problem. After a little experimenting I discovered that increasing the deadzone setting cleared it up even though I was using a mouse and not a gamepad.\n\nA: I thought I would share this answer, since it seems to have fixed the problem on some other systems. Basically, disable joystick support like this:\nsudo rmmod joydev\n\nHowever, this does not work for me, hopefully it does for someone else.\n", "Q: Middle-click does nothing but makes window controls appear Just did a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop and noticed that the middle-click (actually three finger-tap on the touchpad) on Firefox doesn't work as it used to.

I don't really understand why Ubuntu has two \"notification area\" style things that seem to serve the same functionality.\nI can't use only one because some of the programs seem to only work with Notification Area (e.g. Orage) and some only work with Indicator Plugin (e.g. indicator-sound).  I noticed that the network manager applet will prefer to insert itself into Indicator Plugin and if that isn't available, try Notification Area.\nI don't understand why we have/need both?  Is it normal to keep both running?\n\nA: Is it normal? Yes. Why? For the exact reason you've described: some things don't support IA.\nNotification Area is the older of the two projects and it's been around since the crack of doom. Indicator Applet sprung up a few years ago to address some design concerns Canonical were having.\nThey work in fairly different ways so it's not a drop-in replacement and never really can be.

I am using Ubuntu 11.10, and wish to simply know whether I can dump all physical memory and swap, as due to some kernel restrictions, I can't dd /dev/mem, even as superuser. \nIs there any workaround or option to allow dd'ing /dev/mem or a dedicated tool made to do this correctly?\n\nA: Use fmem\nYou used to be able to simply dd /dev/mem back in the day, but no longer for security reasons (since kernel 2.6, IIRC).\nThe alternative is to either build the kernel yourself wih the option to let root do that (will edit with name later, on phone now) OR better, use fmem, a kernel module which creates a /dev/fmem device pretty much meant for easy dumping.\n\nfmem works great for me on 12.04.

Can someone explain the relationship between the different sound components and if they all need to be installed in order to get sound?\nFor example, I have one called \"Playback: ... (PulseAudio Mixer)\" and another called \"Intel ICH5 Alsa Mixer\" which both seem to affect my sound.  Can I uninstall one of them and still have working audio?\n\nA: There are four layers in this abridged explanation of the audio stack.\n\n\n*\n\n*The hardware.\n\n*ALSA. \n\n*Pulseaudio\n\n*Applications.\n\n\nALSA has all the hardware support. It's great at talking to a whole load of different stuff but it's relatively rubbish at talking to more than one application or providing network-aware features like Pulseaudio.\nIn this sort of stack, PulseAudio is the only thing that interfaces with the main ALSA devices so if you want to make a sound, you either have to kick PulseAudio off, or interface with it.\nPulseAudio can accept connections from clients that only speak ALSA (it pretends to be an ALSA device) for legacy reasons which allows things like Wine, Skype, et al to work (most of the time).\n\nTheoretically you could remove PulseAudio. In practice this would probably completely knacker your system if you're using more than one application that wants to make a noise at once. Our media centre box here only uses ALSA for this reason (plus I need raw HD over HDMI access that old PulseAudio used to interfere with - it might not now).\nI would suggest you keep both. You need ALSA and PulseAudio, for all its alleged sins, does a pretty good job these days.\n\nA: There is a similar question in Super User site, and a Good answer. You can check that. However I am copying most useful info here. All credit goes to original answerer.\n\nALSA is the kernel level sound mixer, it manages your sound card directly. ALSA is a  crap (seriously) and it can handle a few (sometimes just one) channel. PulseAudio is a software mixer, on top of the userland (like you'd run an app). When it runs, it uses Alsa's channel and manages EVERY mixing stuff, devices, network devices, everything by itself. (It's like one more unneeded layer) Actually you can run only ALSA, but you might get mixing problems and Ubuntu comes with PA support/PA dependence. (Some apps are hard coded to use PulseAudio, with custom patches and so on.) (PulseAudio also consumes much more CPU than OSS or ALSA.)\n\n", "Q: Windows VirtualBox can't browse network I'm running Windows XP as a VirtualBox guest OS under Ubuntu 11.10, and I can't browse the Windows network. It seems like I can connect to some specific network shares, maybe only ones that are already mapped to drives.\nIf I disable ufw, it all works fine, and when I enable it again, the network browsing continues to work. I tried looking at /var/log/ufw.log and saw it blocking port 138. When I allowed that port, then I saw it blocking port 137.\nI found this answer, and it led me to bug 360975. The bug originally asked for  both nf_conntrack_pptp and nf_conntrack_netbios_ns to be added to the defaults, but in comment 11, Jamie decided not to include nf_conntrack_pptp in the fix.\nI tried adding it in, and it seemed to solve my problem, but then the problem came back.\nHow can I let the Windows guest OS browse the local network?\n\nA: Changing the VirtualBox network settings from NAT to bridged adapter solved the problem. It continued to work after I removed the nf_conntrack_pptp module, so I guess that was irrelevant.\n", "Q: Upgrade 11.10 to 12.04 on Eee PC failed.

Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Try formatting the USB stick with a FAT32 filesystem and try again. That should do the trick.\n\nA: A possible reason for this error is the inability to access the ISO file. For instance, if the user can list the contents of the directory containing the ISO, but not read the file itself, Startup Disk Creator will let select the file, and then fail with \"Installation failed.\" error.\nIt is surprising that this case was not handled by the tool, for example by showing a more descriptive error message.\n\nA: Format the drive to FAT 32 file system then use terminal first to get the correct device address like (dev/sdb)\nTo get all memory location addresses,run command: df \nGet the correct location of flash drive and type following command:\nsudo dd if=input.iso of=/dev/sdc\n\nSee this if you want more details \nHow to create a bootable Ubuntu USB flash drive from terminal?\n\nA: I faced many USB problem while making it bootable or during formatting.

This process is very reliable. But there are several bugs in the versions of the Startup Disk Creator in previous versions of Ubuntu.\n\nThe cloning process needs no formatting. The process will overwrite whatever is written on the drive.\nThere are several tools that can do the same thing - clone the iso file to the USB drive or memory card also in previous versions of Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*dd is the classic cloning tool. It is very powerful but also dangerous, because it does what you tell it to do without any questions. If you tell it to wipe the family pictures ... and it is a minor typing error away. dd deserves the nick-name 'Data Destroyer'.\n\n*Disks alias gnome-disks can 'restore' from the iso file to a USB pendrive or graphics card.

extract it to the Psychonauts folder from this link.\nI had some bug and with this patch i solved everything.\nPS: The psychonaut folder is in /opt/Psychonauts if you installed it from Ubuntu Software Center.\n", "Q: Google Earth freezes during zoom-in on Intel processors with integrated graphics When I zoom in at a certain zoom level, Google Earth makes my system freeze completely so that I have to power off or reboot\nI use Kubuntu 12.04 and my laptop has an Intel(R)Core(TM)i3-2310M CPU @2.10GHz with HD3000 graphics.\nI installed intel-gpu-tools and tried to fix it with sudo intel_reg_write 0x2120 0x1206800 as explained here, but that didn't work.\nI wonder if there any other solution out there...\n\nA: The best option is to patch the Intel Graphics driver for your current kernel\nThis occurs in OpenGL applications because of a bug in the kernel's i915 Intel GPU driver.\nThe best option is to patch the i915 module for your existing kernel using the solution in comment #12 of that bug report.\nIt will take a little time and effort...\nHere's how...\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal with Ctrl-Alt-T (or open Konsole for Kubuntu)\n\n*Type or paste sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get distupgrade -y, press enter, type your password and let it finish.\n\n*Then type/paste these, one after the other:\n\nsudo apt-get install build-essential patch\nmkdir ksrc\ncd ksrc\napt-get source linux-image-$(uname -r)\ncd linux-3.2.0\nwget -O- https://launchpadlibrarian.net/103494967/fix-intel-gpu-crash-3.2.diff | patch -p1\nmake oldconfig\nmake drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915.ko\nDIR915=/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/gpu/drm/i915\nsudo mv $DIR915/i915.ko $DIR915/i915_old.ko\nsudo cp drivers/gpu/drm/i915/i915.ko $DIR915/i915.ko\n\n\n*Reboot, and hopefully your Google Earth problem should be fixed. In that case, you can remove the linux source by going into the terminal and typing rm -rf ksrc. If there are any graphics problems, you can revert to the old driver with:\n\nDIR915=/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/gpu/drm/i915\nsudo cp $DIR915/i915_old.ko $DIR915/i915.ko\n\n\n*You will have to re-do this procedure whenever a new 3.2 kernel is released, which thankfully isn't often! There is also the chance that the patch will be included (backported) in one of these upgrades.\n\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu 12.04LTS 64bit in Lenovo S205 Failed I have installed Ubuntu 12.04LTS on Lenovo S205 twice, but it would not boot normally.  How can I fix this problem?  I tried to install dual boot, Windows and Ubuntu. but still it would not work properly. Even, when I installed Ubuntu only, it would not boot too. Installation was okay, but it could not boot to Ubuntu. just stuck on a blank screen. \nMore information is posted in my blog below\nhttp://fzakiul.wordpress.com/2012/05/11/lenovo-ideapad-s205-vs-ubuntu/\nextremely need a help.\n\nA: Try using this guide, this combo finally worked for me:\nhttp://pastebin.com/0R1jXyzM\n\n\n*\n\n*Write Ubuntu 64 bit live USB (32 bit won't work due to UEFI)\n\n*Make at least 3 primary partitions:\n\n*\n\n*125MB EFI partition (Only appears in ubuntu installer. Does not appear in gParted, or Linux Mint installer)\n\n*/ partition (ext4 is fine)\n\n*swap partition (swap)\n\n*If you do not see \"EFI\" partition type during the installer, try opening gParted in the live USB and make an GPT partition table before you do the installation. It's in one of the menus (you don't want msdos).\n\n\n*Install\n\n*After your first restart after installing, go into the BIOS boot menu (F2) and rearrange the boot partitions to your HDD as #1 and the new mysterious \"ubuntu\" entry is #2. This will enable your wifi (after all what is a netbook without wifi).\n\n\nA: LUG Bruchsal have fixed your problem.\nJust visit their homepage.\nThe Homepage is in German but it should not be a serious problem.\nYou are able to translate with www.leo.org.\nenjoy yourself with best greetings from a ubuntu- user witch have the same problem in front of his chest!\nReinhard (Germany)\nHomepage:\nhttps://lugbruchsal.de/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=doku:ubuntu_12.04_auf_lenovo_s205_installieren\nGive me just a shout if it will be worked out with your netbook.\n", "Q: How can I add/show current application icon or Ubuntu icon on left of Unity panel? I was wondering if we can put Ubuntu or current (focused) application icon in Unity panel on left like Mac.\n\nPlease let me know if I am missing anything.\nThank you.\n\nA: As of 12.04, that functionality is honestly impossible. Unity is not coded that way. If you've used 11.04, there was the Ubuntu logo there before. That has been removed.\n", "Q: Clear Complete Instructions to Dual-Boot 12.04 on OSX Lion Honestly, google-surfing this question leads to so many half-answers and multi-part communications that it is both scary and frustrating to try to navigate them.\nThe question here is simple:  What are the clear and complete step-by-step instructions that you used to dual-boot 12.04 on your OSX Lion (entrapped) Apple computer. Did you use rEFIt, rEFIind, a special .iso of 12.04?  What?  \nObviously, there is a preference for safer, easier, and more reversible methods.  I can probably assure that the best answer will get plenty of views.  \n\nA: There are many ways to skin that cat. FWIW, I've got a lengthy but thorough description of how I set up my OS X/Ubuntu dual-boot here; however, my system is an older 32-bit computer that's incapable of running OS X 10.7. AFAIK, nothing about 10.7 would require changes to the procedure, although using certain features (such as whole-partition encryption) might need a tweak or two. In brief, I carefully partitioned the disk and installed in BIOS mode. I then installed an EFI boot loader to replace the BIOS-mode GRUB. There are a lot of details and pitfalls to be avoided, though; that's why my Web page on the subject is close to 6,000 words in length.\nAn important caveat is that there are many different Mac models, and some installation methods will work better on some models than on others. Furthermore, what works changes with time, as drivers and support programs are upgraded. Thus, if you read that Procedure A didn't work well on Model 1 in 2010, that may not be true today, or on Model 2.\n\nA: I wrote a complete step-by-step guide here. That's the way I did it and it worked perfectly fine. I also try to tackle some common issues in my tutorial.\n\nA: You can find a detailed guide to install ubuntu precise on an apple macbook air 2012 edition over here.\n", "Q: \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" results in graphical artifacts on MacBook I am trying to bless my MacBookPro 5,3 (Unibody/Core2Duo/Nvidia 9400M+Nvidia 9600M GT) with Ubuntu 12.04 (already got rEFIt running), but every time I select Try Ubuntu without installing, it will lock up and always give me the same coloured graphical artifacts all over the screen. \nWhether I use a CD-ROM or a USB Stick, it does not change a thing.\n\n\nIs there anything else that can be done or am I stuck for now?\n\nA: There is two solutions, that i've already tested on my MacBook Pro 5.3:\n\n\n*\n\n*When you see \"Try Ubuntu without installing\", select it and type e for editing and add as kernel option nomodeset. You must insert it on the most long line who contains \"splash silent\", before the \"--\". After that press F10 key.\n\n*Alternatively you can download and use the special iso for Mac here. Then choose \"64-bit Mac (AMD64) desktop CD.\" Everything works well without touching anything.\n\nA: I have a MacBook pro 5.1 with the same setup of gfx cards.\nIt messes up because of nouveau/Xorg having  difficulties with your dual card setup.\nWhen you boot in efi mode both cards are enabled.\nBut there is a way to fix it.\nIf you disable the card in grub the live cd will boot fine into the graphical environment.\nPress 'e' to edit the grub command line.\nAdd the following on separate lines:\noutb 0x728 1\noutb 0x710 2\noutb 0x740 2\noubb 0x750 0\n\nThis will turn of your 9600 card and switch the display to your 9400 card.\nIf your display turns totally blank. go into OSX , toggle which card is currently active.\nAnd redo the steps above and it should work.\n\nA: I don't know probably because you are trying to install Ubuntu on a Mac instead of PC? It probably blocked Ubuntu or a display is wrong or your install ISO/CD/USB is corrupt.\n", "Q: Can not login to Normal mode I installed ubuntu 12 in my old PC Acer Power Series. After installation i got the Login Screen which appears unusally big. when i logged-in in some fail-safe mode. I got the normal ubuntu running. but if i restart the system i can login using fail-safe mode but i can't login normally.\nI think the problem must be i don't have a graphic card. Even if i do have one that must be very very low configuration one. Kindly help me with graphic card config if that is the problem with my PC.\nI just want to use ubuntu for normal documentation purpose.\nI am new to ubuntu so techcies help me with basic guidance.\nThank you.\nKarthik Muralitharan\n\nA: The easiest wil be to find Additional Drivers application amd hope that Ubuntu picked up your video card's native driver. Install it if it's there.\n\nA: *\n\n*Login in the fail-save mode\n\n*Go to the terminal en type: sudo nautilus (the pogram will ask your password)\n\n*go to file system: \"etc/default/grub an open that file (click on it)\n\n*Search for the text GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" and change it to \n\n*GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset\" \n\n*Save the file\n\n*Close nautilus\n\n*You are back in the terminal.  Type: sudo update-grub\n\n*Close the terminal and reboot the computer\n\n*Try this time the mormal mode to boot.\n\n", "Q: How do I take a screenshot of the alt-tab menu? In Ubuntu 12.04, when I press alt+tab, the following menu comes up:\n(TODO: take screenshot of alt-tab menu)\n\nBut while I have the alt-tab menu up, when I press Print Screen, and therefore Alt+Print Screen, it takes a screenshot of the active window.\n\nA: I had this trouble myself, but there's a sneaky workaround.\nOpen \"Screenshot\" from the Dash and set a timer before the shot, about 5 or so seconds. Then, click \"Take Screenshot\" and hold Alt+Tab. You should get a screenshot.\n", "Q: how can i make ubuntu software center offer 32-bit packages I am developing a 3D game/graphics/simulation engine on 64-bit ubuntu 12.04 LTS.  The 64-bit version of my application compiles, links and executes just fine.  However, I cannot build a 32-bit version of my application.  I get the following build errors:\nld : cannot find -lX11\nld : cannot find -lcairo\nld : cannot find -lpango\nld : cannot find -lfreetype\nld : cannot find -lfmodex\n\nMy assumption is, I do not have 32-bit versions of some libraries installed.  However, when I look for files with -i386 or :i386 suffix in \"ubuntu software center\", I don't see any.  For example, if I enter \"libcairo\" in the search field, it shows:\nlibcairo2\nlibcairo2-dev\nlibcairo2-doc\nlibcairo2-dbg\nplus a other irrelevant files (bindings for other languages).\n\nNo matter how I search, I cannot see any package names that imply 32-bit libraries.\nHow, exactly, are we supposed to develop 32-bit executables on 64-bit linux circa 2012 and beyond (ubuntu 12.04 LTS in my case)?\n\nA: Development packages are usually architecture-independent. For everything else, to get the i386 (32-bit) libraries you need to install the ia32-libs package in Software Center. That should automatically pull in all the i386 libraries you may need (depending on the 64-bit ones already installed).\n\n", "Q: How to open webpage from wireframesketcher link?

Did that work for you?  \n\nThe issue was the motherboard BMC IPMI feature. This has it own MAC\n  address that causes problems for switches with port-security.\nThere is a dedicated LAN-port for the IPMI, but if only one cable is\n  plugged in, the IPMI will \"hijack\" this one and send out ocasional arp\n  requests on the same IP = problems.\n\nHere's a general troubleshooting strategy, to add to what you have.\nFor completeness, can you attach output of netstat -aunt | head, and sudo ufw status?\nThe netstat (with just the head lines captured, you might need a few more than default) should show your ssh daemon listening (default is tcp 22). \nThe ufw status should just corroborate what iptables is telling you (namely, that iptables/firewall is not interfering). \nAlso, do you have a host you can use to do sudo nmap <yourboxname> from?  This should show ssh open if it everything is functioning normally. \nWhat devices are between the source and destination host?  Switch, router, firewall, etc..   If there is third host in your subnet, can it connect to the second? \nDo you have more than one network interface on the box (wired and wireless, e.g.)?\nCan you post ifconfig output as well?\nWhat's upstream from you?  That is, are you directly connected into a router, switch, other switch, etc.?\n\nA: All was wrong only this fixed finally: (the default driver of Ubuntu 11.10 which shifts are not correct was causing this)\nStep 1: get it\n\nhttp://152.104.125.41/search/default.aspx?keyword=RTL8111\n\nhttp://152.104.125.41/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&PNid=5&PFid=5&Level=5&Conn=4&DownTypeID=3&GetDown=false#RTL8111B/RTL8168B/RTL8111/RTL8168<br>RTL8111C/RTL8111CP/RTL8111D(L)<br>RTL8168C/RTL8111DP/RTL8111E<br>RTL8168E/RTL8111F\n\nStep 2: cat README\n\n# tar vjxf r8168-8.aaa.bb.tar.bz2\n# ./autorun.sh  (as root or with sudo)\n\n\nStep 3: lsmod | grep r8168 \n\nnote that: not 8169 was conflicting.\n\n\nWorks perfect now.\n\n", "Q: nm-applet missing after installing Ubuntu under virtualbox After installing Ubuntu under VirtualBox the nm-applet is missing.\nI already tried to restart the applet but nothing has happened.

Additionally I installed the package network-manager-dpg but the terminal apparently doesn't know the package network-manager.

The most likely cause is that it is not running or not installed.\nIf it is installed but not running, try:\nsudo service network-manager start\n\nIf it is not installed, you can install it with:\nsudo apt-get install network-manager network-manager-gnome\n\nThe gnome tools are likely already installed, but it never hurts.\n\nA: It's working again! I had Ubuntu running under VirtualBox and just copied all of the files from /etc/NetworkManager to my actual Ubuntu and it was working again!\n\nA: As Javier pointed out here in his answer, a reason can be that network-manager is not running. That again can have reasons as discussed in askubuntu.com question \"network-manager does not start automatically\".\nThe most likely reason is a network interface that is configured with autostart and DHCP in /etc/network/interfaces, but not connected at system startup. A symptom for that cause is a message \"Waiting up to 60 seconds more for network configuration ...\" at startup.\n", "Q: Will deja dup or any other backup program work with Charter Cloud Drive?

Why? I have recently installed Xubuntu 12.04 alongside Windows Vista on my Acer Aspire 6920G laptop. I installed the latest proprietary fglrx drivers for the ATI radeon mobility 3650.\nIn Xubuntu I felt significant heat coming from the area in which the graphics card is situated, even when the system is idle. After about 10 minutes of playing Quake Live the system shut down suddenly. I opened up the laptop and found that the reason for the emergency shut down was most likely the graphics card, as the heat sink was extremely hot. The heat sink for the CPU wasn't hot and I vacuumed it recently (and temperatures are within normal range) So I have assumed it isn't the CPU.\nI vacuumed the laptop again and booted into Windows. When the system is idle the laptop feels warmish but significantly cooler where the graphics card is situated. After playing UT2004 and Quake Live for a good while I found that even though the graphics card got warmer, the computer never shut down.\nHas anyone else had this problem and does anyone know why the graphics card overheats in Xubuntu and not Windows (if that is indeed the cause)? How can I find out what exactly is causing this problem? is it a power-management issue or graphics drivers issue? I installed Xubuntu to have a less resource intensive system but I might have to go back to Windows for fear of overheating and emergency shut downs.\nAdditional Info:\nOne thing I also noticed was that UT2004 runs with lower frame rate and has to have less demanding graphics settings to run more smoothly in Xubuntu. In Windows I can have very high graphics settings and it runs very smoothly. So perhaps the route of the problem is the drivers. However, the fan/system-in-general seems much noisier in Xubuntu, even when idle, although the CPU usage doesn't seem any higher.\n\nA: Right it seems that the command aticonfig --initial initialized the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file and filled it with the correct configuration for my graphics card. Before I did this the file had almost no information in it so if anyone has a similar problem check that  /etc/X11/xorg.conf is set up correctly (might be in a different folder for others). I played UT2004 after doing this and the frame rate issue is gone, even on higher settings. Although the graphics card got hotter there was no emergency shut down and I played it for a while.\nIf you want a way to check if the file is set up correctly run aticonfig --odgc --odgt --adapter=all (this was suggested in Bill's answer so credit goes to him). This command normally returns performance information about your graphics card. If /etc/X11/xorg.conf isn't set up correctly it will return an error that asks you to run aticonfig --initial.\n\nA: *\n\n*Have you installed the most recent drivers on card? \n\n*Does this happen when the battery is plugged in? or out?\n\n*Have you checked how stressed the GPU is?\n\n\n\naticonfig --odgc --odgt --adapter=all\n\nThis command should display the stress being put on GPU. The memory and GPU usage will appear in percentage. Also it will give you your fan speed to see if that is changing while the GPU is being heavily stressed.\nTry running that as you play Quake on linux machine and compare results with what its doing while on Windows. It may well just be that your linux machine is not controlling the fan as it becomes more stressed. But more likely this is a drivers problem.  \nBill\n", "Q: Problem with GRUB not being on Hard Disk I have just done an install of Ubuntu 12.04 on a new PC with no OS from a USB but the GRUB has not installed onto the Hard Disk but onto Flash, how do I correct this ?\n\nA: You can manually install GRUB onto a device if it was installed to the wrong place by issuing\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdX\nQuoted: However if the above doen`t make it possible to boot the OS you can use \"Rescue a broken system\" at the USB drive's startup menu to install GRUB. \n\nFollow the prompts to start up your system, selecting the hard disk partition when requested. The “Enter rescue mode” screen appears which provides options to mount your system. Your broken system will be mounted and made accessible with a command line interface. You can then use command line operations and editors to fix configuration files. If you need to reinstall the boot loader, you can choose the “Reinstall GRUB boot loader” entry.\n\nSource: Super User: Ubuntu Server installed from USB puts GRUB on the USB drive instead of the hard disk\n", "Q: Why the Enter key in a Mac keyboard is mapped to Level?

Please correct me if I am wrong here....\nWhen I change my system clock this changes the file /usr/share/zoneinfo immediately, HOWEVER, the actual system time doesn't change until the next reboot because /etc/localtime then re-reads /usr/share/zoneinfo?\nI have seen behaviour similar to the above, whereby /usr/share/zoneinfo/ was accessed but the system time did not change until after the system had rebooted\n\nA: Every process knows the time zone (you can alter it on a per-process basis by setting the TZ environment variable). When you change the system time zone, only newly launched processes will \"see\" the new time zone setting. This is why it seems to only fully take effect with a reboot.

In Ubuntu 12.04 (or above), how do I set the GRUB time and the default OS (that I see at boot time) as I'm dual-booting Windows (7/8) and Ubuntu (12.04 or above)?\n\nA: I followed the first answer but it seems to need updating if you are dual booting with Windows 7 Pro and Ubuntu 16.04. Also make sure secure boot is off in the BIOS.\na) First he says use Alt + F2 when I think he wants to use to open a terminal window. In my case it is Ctrl+Alt+T.\nb) In the first entry gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub the gksudo command is not installed by default in Ubuntu 16.04. To get around this do the following in Terminal:\nsudo -i and press Enter and give your password and then Enter again.\nthen type:\ngedit /etc/default/grub and press Enter.\nc) You will now see the grub change menu as illustrated in answer 1. Follow his answer until he gets to Ctrl + S to save the changes. This doesn't work in Ubuntu 16.04 but you should see a save button in the upper right corner of the screen. Click on that.\nd) Ctrl + Q to quit.\ne) Next type sudo update-grub and Enter\nf) Type exit. You need to do this twice.\ng) Reboot\nI found that on my computer after a few logons the boot process would not show the grub screen at start up and therefore I could not get into Ubuntu as I had set Windows as my default bootup with a 7 second delay in case I wanted to get into Ubuntu.\nTo correct this problem you need to get into Windows.\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the start menu and type CMD in the search box.\n\n*Right click on the CMD line which should be at the top of the screen produced by the right clicking.\n\n*Click on run as administrator.\n\n*On the command line type bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi. This entry has the effect of registering the grub menu with the windows boot manager. (Credit to: Grub not showing on startup for Windows 8.1 Ubuntu 13.10 Dual boot)\n\n*Finally, I rebooted back into windows.\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: Using default entry identified with a number astonished me since it was introduction in GRUB. This is really bad idea. There are many situations that will result in a numbering change (i.e. updates with backed up entries).\nInstead, use SAVED to remember last chosen entry. Update /etc/default/grub with:\nGRUB_DEFAULT=saved\nGRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true\n\nThen apply GRUB update with:\nsudo update-grub\n\nReference: http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/grub.html#Simple-configuration\n\nA: If you read the file that you are editing in the example above (/etc/default/grub), you will notice that the very first couple lines instruct you to run update-grub after making changes in order to update the actual file that grub reads to \"get its instructions\" (/boot/grub/grub.cfg). Note that you must actually run it with the sudocommand first as you need root privileges to actually run the command (which is why the poster above said to type sudo update-grub). This will cause the changes you made to be written to /boot/grub/grub.cfg. The very next couple lines tell you that you can read the full documentation of options in that file (again, /etc/default/grub) by typing info -f grub -n 'Simple configuration'.\nThat said, set GRUB_TIMEOUT to -1 if you want to set the \"grub time\" to be indefinite. In other words, it will never automatically boot. You will have to make a selection.\nFinally, to answer your question, here are the descriptions of those \"grub hidden lines\" straight from the above-referenced documentation:\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT\n    Wait this many seconds for a key to be pressed before displaying\n    the menu.  If no key is pressed during that time, boot\n    immediately.  Unset by default.\n\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET\n    In conjunction with `GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT', set this to `true' to\n    suppress the verbose countdown while waiting for a key to be\n    pressed before displaying the menu.  Unset by default.\n\nI hope this helps!\n\nA: *\n\n*Press Alt + F2, type gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub press Enter and enter your password.\n\n*You will see the following contents:\n\nGRUB_DEFAULT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\nGRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=10\nGRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\n\n*You can change the default from 0 to any number, corresponding to the entry in the Grub bootup menu (first entry is 0, second is 1, etc.)\n\n*You can change the \"hidden timeout\" (no menu); and also display the countdown (GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=false)\n\n*You can force the grub menu to show by commenting out the two GRUB_HIDDEN lines with a # at the beginning of the line\n\n*And set the grub menu timeout (default is 10 seconds)\n\n*Make your changes, press Ctrl + S to save and Ctrl + Q to exit\n\n*Important: Open a terminal with Ctrl + Alt + T and type sudo update-grub to apply the changes you just made\n\n*Reboot and you should see your timeout/default entry change\n\n\n\nLinked Question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I set Windows to boot as the default in the boot loader?\n\nA: This doesn't work for me on 16.04, too.\nBut I fixed it by changing the file /boot/grub/grub.cfg\nsudo vim /etc/default/grub\n\nedit grub\nsudo update-grub\nsudo chmod u+w /boot/grub/grub.cfg\nsudo vim /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nchange timeout value\n###segment in /boot/grub/grub.cfg:\nset timeout_style=menu\nif [ \"${timeout}\" = 0 ]; then\n  #set timeout=10 # comment this original\n  set timeout=0 # add this\nfi\n\nsudo chmod -w /boot/grub/grub.cfg\nreboot\n\n\nA: I think you have a line like this:\nGRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden\n\nChange it to:\nGRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=menu\n\nAnd comment all lines regarding HIDDEN features.\n\nA: You can use an application called Grub Customizer. It is much more easier.\nYou can install it by:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\n\nIf you are getting errors adding ppa, it is possible that grub-customizer is already included. Try installing without adding the ppa.\nThere is an How-To Geek article about it, How to Configure the Linux GRUB 2 Boot Menu the Easy Way. Also, there is a solved thread on the Ubuntu Forums, Change boot order in GRUB 2 that mentions this tool.\nHere are some screen shots of this software:\n\n\n\nA: In 20.10 (at least) with an EFI based machine you need to specify GRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT as the timeout due to what is in my opinion a bug (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/1918736)\nAs such your /etc/default/grub should contain:\nGRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT=10\n\nfor a 10 second timeout.\nTO update the grub config and check the correct output:\nsudo update-grub && grep -B3 \"set timeout=\" /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nAnd you should see:\n...\nif [ $grub_platform = efi ]; then\n  set timeout=10\n...\n\n\nA: It can be done easily without any codes. Just follow these steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open file system.\n\n*Open /etc folder.\n\n*Open default folder.\n\n*Find grub file and open it with leafpad (or any other text editor).\n\n*Set GRUB_TIMEOUT to your need and save it.\n\n*Now open terminal and type update-grub.\n\n*Reboot your system.\n\n\nThat's it.\n\nA: About setting Grub default entry, you can use (in at least Ubuntu 20+, CentOS 7+, and Debian 10+) grub-set-default.\nYou use this in combination with a menu entry in your grub.cfg file (on my machine stored on /boot/grub/grub.cfg).\nFor instance, if I wanted to load menu entry:\nmenuentry 'GNU/Linux, with Linux 5.10.0-rc5.bm.1-amd64+' --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os $menuentry_id_option 'gnulinux-5.10.0-rc5.bm.1-amd64+-advanced-f3257130-7310-45a9-990b-d0393ee336f5'\n\nThen I can do grub-set-default \"GNU/Linux, with Linux 5.10.0-rc5.bm.1-amd64+\" to set this entry to be the default. You can verify it worked by checking grubenv (stored on my machine at /boot/grub/grubenv). Mine says\nsaved_entry=GNU/Linux, with Linux 5.10.0-rc5.bm.1-amd64+\n\nMake sure that you have GRUB_DEFAULT=saved in your /etc/default/grub file.\nYou could also set a one-time only boot using the command grub-reboot, in the same way as above.\n", "Q: How to make PPA build for particular release I'm creating my first proper PPA to patch a problem with Compiz. debbuild/dput works fine but Launchpad tells me it's only building it for Quantal.\nI've no interest in doing that for the minute - I'd like it to build for Precise. What do I need to do to get this done?\nEdit: I went into the package page in Launchpad and managed to copy the package I uploaded for another release, but is there a way of setting the default release(s) for a PPA?\n\nA: I would surmise from your question that your debian/changelog file has defaulted to quantal instead of precise for the target.\nFor example - this is an example changelog for a PPA package I have recently built:\nrhythmbox-plugin-albumartsearch (0.1-3) precise; urgency=low\n\n  * folder rename\n\n -- fossfreedom <fossfreedom@somewheremail.com>  Thur, 07 Jun 2012 13:19:18 +0100\n\nYou'll note - the target is precise\nIf you use dch -i to create your change log then this will not only increment your version number but change to the next development release.\nBest use dch -i --distribution [foo] to ensure that the changelog is created correctly for the distro you wish to use - where [foo] is precise in your example. \n\nUseful link:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide\n", "Q: Is there any simple way to access installed programs?

How can I do this?\n\nA: Just create launcher \ngksudo gedit /usr/share/applications/separator.desktop\n\nand paste following details in gedit.\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nIcon=/path/to/icon.png\nName=Unity Separator\n\nthen hit Super and search for Unity Separator and put it on Unity Panel\nRemember, It will consume same space as of other launcher size on Unity Panel.\n\nA: I solved. I just created some shortcuts with empty command and changed the icon. This is the result: \n\n\nA: *\n\n*Create a simple Python script (separator.py) with icon. (see code below)\n\n*Put it in ~/bin/\n\n*Create an icon.png and place it in the same directory.\n\n*chmod +x ~/bin/separator.py\n\n*Launch it. It will appear in launcher.\n\n*While is running, set it to keep in launcher (right click on icon in launcher).\n\n*Repeat from 1-6, changing the name to separator2.py etc.\n\n*Arrange the icons with drag.\n\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport pygtk\npygtk.require('2.0')\nimport gtk\n\nclass HelloWorld:\n\n    def delete_event(self, widget, event, data=None):\n        return False\n\n    def destroy(self, widget, data=None):\n        gtk.main_quit()\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        # create a new window\n        self.window = gtk.Window(gtk.WINDOW_TOPLEVEL)\n\n        self.window.set_icon_from_file('icon.png')\n\n        self.window.connect(\"delete_event\", self.delete_event)\n        self.window.connect(\"destroy\", self.destroy)\n\n        # Creates a new button with the label \"Hello World\".\n        self.button = gtk.Button(\"Hello World\")\n\n        self.window.add(self.button)\n        self.button.show()\n        self.window.show()\n\n    def main(self):\n        gtk.main()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    hello = HelloWorld()\n    hello.main()\n\n", "Q: Configure mounting timeout at boot On remotely rebooting a 12.04 machine I found it hanging at the \"unable to mount soandso: Skip, Manual Abort? \" (That's pretty much how I remember the message) The machine was basically stopped there until I hooked up a keyboard and pressed \"s\". I can see the rationale for the question, but I'd really like to know where to configure it or turn it off altogether. A mandatory question like this makes sense in a desktop environment but for servers I'd like more flexibility.\nSo where do I fiddle and tweak this?\n\nA: Now it is 2020 and this question can be updated to represent current status. In a nutshell, the timeout can be set by using x-systemd.mount-timeout parameter:\nFrom manpages:\n\nMount units may either be configured via unit files, or via /etc/fstab (see fstab(5) for\ndetails). Mounts listed in /etc/fstab will be converted into native units dynamically at\nboot and when the configuration of the system manager is reloaded. In general, configuring\nmount points through /etc/fstab is the preferred approach.\n\nand:\n\nx-systemd.mount-timeout=\nConfigure how long systemd should wait for the mount command to finish before giving\nup on an entry from /etc/fstab. Specify a time in seconds or explicitly append a unit\nsuch as \"s\", \"min\", \"h\", \"ms\".\n\nThus, for example:\n/dev/sdc     /mnt/backupdir     ext4     defaults,x-systemd.mount-timeout=30 0 2\n\nwaits atmost for 30 seconds during the boot for that entry to be mount before give up.\n\nA: Thanks for the hint with the console message; it saved me having to plug-in a monitor to the console of a test server (keyboard sufficed...)\nThat said, up to at least 14.04, Ubuntu supported a nobootwait option for fstab entries, which would achieve what you want; smth like this:\nUUID=8b481900-fb7a-4e9e-929c-e940a6b913a4 /data   ext4   nobootwait  0  2\n\nAlas as mentioned in this other question, the nobootwait option was removed in 16.04 with currently no viable substitute other than the /etc/rc.local workaround described in the other answer.\n\nA: Remove the mount by editing or commenting it out in /etc/fstab and replace it with an explicit mount command in /etc/rc.local.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 OpenCL with Intel and Radeon? I want to setup my Ubuntu 12.04 with OpenCL(Open Computing Language) support for i7 2600k and Radeon HD5870.\nMy Monitor is connected to the integrated Graphics of the i7. Intel OpenCL SDK is installed and working.  Iteration of avaliable OpenCL devices shows 2 entries for Intel.\nAs recommended I installed AMD APP SDK 2.6 first and then the fglrx driver.\nI installed fglrx from Ubuntu repositories. This works fine till here.\nWhen I run \naticonfig --inital -f  \n\nand restart the system I get into trouble.\nXorg starts only in low-graphics mode. \ncat /var/log/Xorg.0.log\n[    21.201] \nX.Org X Server 1.12.2\nRelease Date: 2012-05-29\n[    21.201] X Protocol Version 11, Revision 0\n[    21.201] Build Operating System: Linux 2.6.24-29-xen x86_64 Ubuntu\n[    21.201] Current Operating System: Linux chimera 3.2.0-24-generic #39-Ubuntu SMP Mon May 21 16:52:17 UTC 2012 x86_\n[    21.201] Kernel command line: BOOT_IMAGE=/boot/vmlinuz-3.2.0-24-generic root=UUID=c137757b-486b-4514-9dfe-00c97662\n[    21.201] Build Date: 05 June 2012  08:35:55AM\n[    21.201] xorg-server 2:1.12.2+git20120605+server-1.12-branch.aaf48906-0ubuntu0ricotz~precise (For technical suppor\n[    21.201] Current version of pixman: 0.26.0\n[    21.201]    Before reporting problems, check http://wiki.x.org\n    to make sure that you have the latest version.\n[    21.201] Markers: (--) probed, (**) from config file, (==) default setting,\n    (++) from command line, (!!) notice, (II) informational,\n    (WW) warning, (EE) error, (NI) not implemented, (??) unknown.\n[    21.201] (==) Log file: \"/var/log/Xorg.0.log\", Time: Fri Jun  8 14:22:36 2012\n[    21.247] (==) Using config file: \"/etc/X11/xorg.conf\"\n[    21.247] (==) Using system config directory \"/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d\"\n[    21.450] (==) ServerLayout \"aticonfig Layout\"\n[    21.450] (**) |-->Screen \"aticonfig-Screen[0]-0\" (0)\n[    21.450] (**) |   |-->Monitor \"aticonfig-Monitor[0]-0\"\n[    21.451] (**) |   |-->Device \"aticonfig-Device[0]-0\"\n[    21.451] (==) Automatically adding devices\n[    21.451] (==) Automatically enabling devices\n[    21.466] (WW) The directory \"/usr/share/fonts/X11/cyrillic\" does not exist.\n[    21.466]    Entry deleted from font path.\n[    21.466] (WW) The directory \"/usr/share/fonts/X11/100dpi/\" does not exist.\n[    21.466]    Entry deleted from font path.\n[    21.466] (WW) The directory \"/usr/share/fonts/X11/75dpi/\" does not exist.\n[    21.466]    Entry deleted from font path.\n[    21.473] (WW) The directory \"/usr/share/fonts/X11/100dpi\" does not exist.\n[    21.473]    Entry deleted from font path.\n[    21.473] (WW) The directory \"/usr/share/fonts/X11/75dpi\" does not exist.\n[    21.473]    Entry deleted from font path.\n[    21.473] (WW) The directory \"/var/lib/defoma/x-ttcidfont-conf.d/dirs/TrueType\" does not exist.\n[    21.473]    Entry deleted from font path.\n[    21.473] (==) FontPath set to:\n    /usr/share/fonts/X11/misc,\n    /usr/share/fonts/X11/Type1,\n    built-ins\n[    21.473] (==) ModulePath set to \"/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/xorg/extra-modules,/usr/lib/xorg/extra-modules,/usr/lib\n[    21.473] (II) The server relies on udev to provide the list of input devices.\n    If no devices become available, reconfigure udev or disable AutoAddDevices.\n[    21.473] (II) Loader magic: 0x7f0ad3b9ab00\n[    21.473] (II) Module ABI versions:\n[    21.473]    X.Org ANSI C Emulation: 0.4\n[    21.473]    X.Org Video Driver: 12.0\n[    21.473]    X.Org XInput driver : 16.0\n[    21.473]    X.Org Server Extension : 6.0\n[    21.473] (--) PCI:*(0:0:2:0) 8086:0122:1458:d000 rev 9, Mem @ 0xfb800000/4194304, 0xe0000000/268435456, I/O @ 0x00\n[    21.473] (--) PCI: (0:1:0:0) 1002:6898:1787:2289 rev 0, Mem @ 0xd0000000/268435456, 0xfbdc0000/131072, I/O @ 0x000\n[    21.473] (II) Open ACPI successful (/var/run/acpid.socket)\n[    21.473] (II) \"extmod\" will be loaded by default.\n[    21.473] (II) \"dbe\" will be loaded by default.\n[    21.473] (II) \"glx\" will be loaded.

Do I have to change my python code as well?\n\nA: webserver.py is exiting with a non-zero value. By default Upstart considers this an error and so is attempting to restart the service.\nAs to why webserver.py is exiting - my guess would be that it is assuming a particular environment. When Upstart spawns a process, it clears the environment, just like cron and at, and then sets a very small number of variables, namely:\n\n\n*\n\n*TERM\n\n*PATH\n\n*and a few Upstart-specific ones (see http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#standard-environment-variables)\n\n\nTo see the entire job environment, add a call to set as shown here:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#see-the-environment-a-job-runs-in\nIf your python service needs other variables, you can set them using \"env\" (the Upstart stanza, not the shell command).

I can't find any examples of people actually doing this online but there is a launchpad bug about the clipboard not working in remote apps, from which I can infer that there is some way to run remote apps. \nI've tried many combinations of settings for Client, Startup Program and Startup Path in the Advanced tab when configuring an RDP connection in Remmina, but I can't make it work. I can connect to Windows boxes with RDP just fine, just not running a remoteapp.\n\nA: As far as I know, Remmina doesn't allow for RemoteApp client access. You can however do it with xfreerdp. Just use something like this on the command line:\nxfreerdp -u   --app --plugin ./usr/local/lib/freerdp/rail.so --data \"%windir%\\system32\\cmd.exe\" -- <ip of your windows machine>\nor\n/usr/bin/xfreerdp -u  --app --plugin rail.so --data \"||\" --plugin rdpdr --data printer -- <ip of your windows machine>\nUnfortunately, sharing data between local and remote systems through clipboard is not working so it's no use to include the --plugin cliprdr option. I'm waiting for this issued to be addressed so that I can replace Windows for Ubuntu on 5 more users/machines!\n\nA: We use Thinomenon Linux client. It has much better RemoteApp support than freerdp. At the same time, freerdp renders windows being dragged slightly faster.\n@bmullan - visit thinomenon website and learn what is their product. \nThinRDP [thinomenon RDC application] is free. It supports full RDP7 specification. It should be clear to anyone who understands English.\nGo to www.thinomenon.com and look for RDP client.\n\nA: You can try my packaged WinConn application. \nFrom my website: \n\nWinConn simplifies creation, management and desktop integration of\n  remote windows applications in Ubuntu Linux. It uses RemoteApp\n  technology, implemented by FreeRDP project to provide seamless user\n  experience. The applications run in their own window and can be used\n  like any other locally installed Ubuntu application, without bringing\n  the full windows desktop to the user.\n\ninstallation\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:realender/winconn\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install winconn\n\n\nA: When connecting to a Windows Server 2008 or later you need to have enabled the remote application on the server in:  Start - Administrative Tools - Terminal Services - TS RemoteApp Manager. In there you choose Action - Add RemoteApp Programs, and enable whichever programs you would like to make available as an RDP remote program.\nAll this applies to servers which are licensed for Terminal Services. If the server isn't licensed i.e. is only in remote admin mode, the remote applications options are not available.\nI have found this to be the case using Remmina on Ubuntu 12.10 on my netbook.\nHope this comment isn't too late to be of use!\n\nA: Better try http://www.thinomenon.com/products/RemoteDesktopClient/linux.aspx#details\n\nA: There are currently 2 ways to accomplish this (without cost). \n\n\n*\n\n*The more preferred but harder way. Use FreeRDP2, the only catch with this option is that you have to be running an Enterprise, Education, or Server edition of Windows to enable remoteapp. However the performance is top notch. \n\n*Less preferred but incredibly easy way. After almost a week of searching I came across a program called \"Winflector\". I do not know if its open source or not, but im going to assume not. However for a single home user its a pretty good solution. Winflector does NOT require a special version of windows, and it does NOT use RDP. The free version allows 2 concurrent users to be connected, which is fine, in my case I only need 1. There are no functional limitations to the free version, and its incredibly easy to setup, and they even have youtube videos on how to set it up. \n", "Q: Unity Top Panel spread on both dual monitor. Necessary? I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 with a dual monitor setup. The Workspace is spread between the monitors in Xinerama mode, not mirror.\nNow, the top panel is present on both the monitors. It's simply doubled. Not a big issue but since I added some indicators to the panel, the load of my little netbook started to increase. And seems that the unity-panel-service eat a lot of resources.\nSo, is there a way to run the to panel in only one monitor, like it's already possible to do with the launcher? What do you think?\n\nA: It's not possible, and I see a problem with the menus if it's done that way.\nAnyway, I don't expect that showing the panel in two monitors is consuming much more resources than displaying it only in one. So it makes little sense to remove it for performance reasons.\n", "Q: How to import Windows' recent files into the Unity \"Recent Files\" list? I had an idea to create a script that will auto-run on startup to import the recent files list from Windows into Ubuntu's Unity recent-files list. \nI don't know anything about how Unity stores that information for its recent files but I do know that in Windows, the recent files info is stored in a folder called \"Recent\" as a bunch of .ink files with the names of the files used.\nWhat I would like to do is create a script or maybe later on a small program with a GUI for selecting the Windows recent directory for the desired user account.\nHow would this work? \n\nA: Zeitgeist stores it data in a SQLite DB located at ~/.local/share/zeitgeist/activity.sqlite\nBut you shouldn't really try to add entries directly. You'd be better of using the API: http://zeitgeist-project.com/docs/0.3.1/dbus_api.html\nAssuming that you have straight access to the partition that windows is on (i.e. it is mounted and readable, etc.) \"all\" you need to do then is read out the lnk files and add an entry for each.\nYou'll probably find that the hard parts are \n1) Parsing the lnk file from linux ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/jafat/files/lnk-parse/ might be a good place to start)\n2) Adding entries the correct way.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How to jailbreak iphone 4gs in ubuntu?

This is because you can't really modify those files directly.  Instead, it is better to use this command:\nsudo sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_watches=100000\nThis doesn't cause file editing problems, and to me, looks like a more proper method.\n\nA: With Ubuntu 13.04:\n$ sudo nano /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches\n\nThen change what is in the file (I had 8192) to 100000\nThen \"ctrl o\" to save and \"ctrl x\" to exit\nThen run:\n$ sudo sysctl -p\n\nthen restart Dropbox.\n\nA: Edit your /etc/sysctl.conf file with your favourite text editor, e.g. nano:\nsudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nand append (or modify the value of) fs.inotify.max_user_watches=100000 at the end of the file as a new line.\nAs an option you can use the command sudo sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_watches=100000 or the command below, as described on the Dropbox help guide, the results will be the same.\n\nFrom the advanced help guide from Dropbox\n\nMonitoring more than 10000 folders\nThe Linux version of the Dropbox desktop application is limited from monitoring more than 10000 folders by default. Anything over that is not watched and, therefore, ignored when syncing. There's an easy fix for this. Open a terminal and enter the following:\necho fs.inotify.max_user_watches=100000 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf; sudo sysctl -p\nThis command will tell your system to watch up to 100000 folders. Once the command is entered and you enter your password, Dropbox will immediately resume syncing.\n\n", "Q: Cant access ephemeral storage on Amazon ubuntu instance I want to utilise my ephemeral storage as mentioned in this question but I seem to be falling at the first hurdle.

Unfortunately, it appears the open-source drivers in Ubuntu/Linux cannot.\nThe only solution is to not \"turn off\" the card before you shutdown Windows -- you don't need to do that anyway, it's not like the card will consume power once the laptop is shut down.\n\nApparently I have to keep turned on my wireless on windows 7 in order to work on ubuntu.... this is pretty disappointing\n\nYou can only use either Wubi-buntu OR Windows at any one time. I really don't understand what all the fuss is about.\n\nWhat's the real solution?\nSupport wireless card manufacturers who provide proper Linux drivers or at least disclose enough information for the open-source community to write such drivers. Get a new mini-pcie wireless card; I recommend the Intel 6205/6230/6300 - works great with iwlwifi.\n\nA: There may a setting in the BIOS that will help.

If it's helpful, it used to be 11.10 and it was updated in the VM when it came out.\nAnyway, today I let the update manager have its way with Ubuntu and what resulted was an OS unable to run Unity (it falls back to Unity 2D). I didn't get a Google hit with someone having a similar issue, so I figured I'd ask for advice here.\nI'm not used to having to debug issues with failed updates (since they're usually flawless, and I've never operated primarily out of a VM before) so I'm not sure what the best route would be to figure out which update caused an issue (perhaps an update failed and I didn't notice before the OS was rebooted?).\nMy hope was that I could at least get it working again by uninstalling then reinstalling VirtualBox guest additions (which didn't work) but ideally I'd like to know how I could debug the issue so when it's a package I have no idea about causes an issue I can debug it.\nIn any case, I can log in but I can't use the full Unity non-Unity2D (3D compatible version). How can I fix this?\nEdit:\nThe following is the output of running /usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p:\nanthony:~> /usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p\nXlib:  extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":0\".\nError: GLX is not available on the system\n\nTo clarify, 3D acceleration is enabled in VirtualBox. There is 128MB of video memory given to the VM. The system was running fine prior to running some routine updates today (whatever was there via the Ubuntu Update Manager tool). Afterward, the system is stuck falling back to Unity2D mode (apparently I don't have \"GLX\" anymore?).\n\nA: During the testing in beta release something similar happened to me, installing guest additions from \"Additionals Driver\" did the trick.\n", "Q: Broadcom wireless doesn't work on an HP Mini 110 1199EA under Wubi install I used the Windows install for Ubuntu today, it all installed easily and automatically but I could not go on the Internet. Please tell me how to solve this problem. \nI think it was \"Ubuntu Desktop 12.04 LTS\" but I'm not sure, I did it today, 8th of June 2012. I am using the HP Mini 110 1199EA.\nIt says 'firmware not found' or something like that. What is firmware and why isn't it found?  My wireless device seems to be called \"Broadcom 802.11b/g WLAN\" does that make any sense? \n\nA: \nMy wireless device seems to be called \"Broadcom 802.11b/g WLAN\" does that make any sense?\n\nYes. You need to install drivers for it, in this manner:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your netbook to a wired connection (your router/ethernet)\n\n*Open a terminal with Ctrl-Alt-T\n\n*Type sudo apt-get update\n\n*Type sudo apt-get install b43-cutter firmware-b43-installer -y\n\n*Exit, reboot and give it 30 seconds or so...you should hopefully see the \"Wireless Networks Detected\" popup.\n\n*If you don't have a way of getting the wired connection, please add a comment and I'll include a way using a USB stick.\n", "Q: How can I write files in /opt? while trying to install XAMP from a tar file using the command: tar xvfz xampp-linux-1.7.7.tar.gz -C /opt, I get the following message:  Cannot mkdir: Permission denied\nWhere and how do I set permissions?\n\nA: /opt is owned by root(admin user), you would need to change the owner to you, or just use the sudo command.\nto change ownership use chown\nsudo chown username:username /opt\n\nbut it would probally be esier for you to use the command with sudo precceed to it\nsudo tar xvfz xampp-linux-1.7.7.tar.gz -C /opt\n\nnautilus allows to change ownership as well, but youll need to use nautilus as root\ngksudo nautilus /\n\nthen right click on opt go to properties, then go to the permissions tab, and change as neccessary\nchanging file permsioons can also be done with chmod\nfor any more information with these commands, try using the man manual pages\nby using man followed by the command, you can also use the info command  as well.\n", "Q: Apache2 .htaccess I'm getting really frustrated today, while trying to just set up my development environement and start doing some actual work.\nAfter installing php, apache2 and mysql over apt-get install phpmyadmin I'm trying since about an hour, to make .htaccess files work in my /var/www/projectname/.htaccess\nI tried out multiple solutions, that basically told me to edit /etc/apache2/sites-available/default but none of them seemed to work.\nWhat I tried:\n<Directory /var/www/>\n    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n    AllowOverride None\n    #AllowOverride All\n    #AllowOverride AuthConfig FileInfo Indexes Limit Options=All, MultiViews        \n    Order allow,deny\n    allow from all\n</Directory>\n\nThe commented lines are what I tried, both didnt work. I either get a 500 internal error (when I set AllowOverride All) or the .htaccess doesnt do anything.\nCan someone help me here? I need to get this to work, to finally start working :)\nAs side note, my knowledge with ubuntu or linux in common, is very slim - I just do what google tells me.\ncat /etc/issue: Ubuntu 11.10\n\n\nA: You need to enable AllowOverride all. \nThe 500 error is occuring because there's a bug in the htaccess which is either causing an infinite loop and making apache get confused or doing something else weird. Most likely because of a typo. Paste in the htaccess file and we can have a look.\nAlso, run the command sudo a2enmod rewrite to ensure that the htaccess rewrite functions work.\n\nA: When I get this error it usually is a permission issue make sure apache2's user/ group have read permissions on the files and execute permissions on the directory.. \nI think this could help a little. \nhttp://www.linuxforums.org/forum/servers/5270-apache-conf-html-permissions.html\n", "Q: Why does Wubi installer not find my CD and then abort? When I try to install Ubuntu 11.10 using Wubi I get an error asking to check \n\nC:/users/home/appdata/local/temp/wubi-11.10-rev245.log\n\nI don't know what to do.\nI am not using the internet to install Ubuntu. I have Ubuntu in .iso format and I install it by keeping Wubi and the .iso file in the same folder.\nHere is the log file.\n\nA: Did you check the MD5 sum of the ISO file of Ubuntu? Check it once. \nIf it's the same as the file you downloaded, then try to make a bootable ISO using UNetbootin. Then, boot from USB. Click the \"Try Ubuntu\" option during booting. \nIf everything works, then you can try with Wubi. Wubi works on NTFS, so check the partition. If you want GRUB as boot loader you can install it from the \"Try Ubuntu\" window only. \nI would recommend not to install in \"Try Ubuntu\" if you are not familiar with Ubuntu though. There may be dependencies of the Windows boot loader for a few systems. So, as I already said, if the \"Try Ubuntu\" method through the ISO works, then you can test with Wubi.\n\nA: The ISO is bad:\n06-08 23:19 DEBUG Distro: checking Ubuntu ISO C:\\Ubuntu Setup\\ubuntu-11.10-desktop-i386.iso\n06-08 23:19 DEBUG Distro: does not contain casper\\filesystem.squashfs\n\nSo wubi tries to download the diskimage (but it fails since you're offline):\n06-08 23:22 DEBUG downloader: downloading http://releases.ubuntu.com/11.10/ubuntu-11.10-wubi-amd64.tar.xz > C:\\ubuntu\\disks\\ubuntu-11.10-wubi-amd64.tar.xz\n06-08 23:22 ERROR TaskList: [Errno 4] IOError: <urlopen error (7, ‘getaddrinfo failed’)>\n\nSo download the ISO again. Wubi will check it and tell you if it fails. It's best to MD5 check it yourself if you're offline (as Wubi bypasses the md5 check in this case). Or run it online if possible because it only needs to download a small metalink file to check the MD5 sum.\n", "Q: How to add a shortcut to \"update status\" of Broadcast/Gwibber configuration in Ubuntu In the taskbar at the top of Ubuntu, upon clicking the mail icon, there is an option called Broadcast which when configured gwibber with twitter account adds up an additional option in the menu just below broadcast called \"Update Status\". \nClicking the update status option pops up a tiny window with textbox to update twitter status. I find this very nice. Except that I feel it is more comfortable to have a shortcut configured for this. How do I add it?\n\nA: The specific application that launches when you click \"Update Status\" is called gwibber-poster. The actual application that handles the Broadcast accounts in Ubuntu is (by default) Gwibber.\nTo give it a keyboard shortcut, simply open up System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts, and create a custom shortcut for the command gwibber-poster. I don't have enough rep to post images yet, but here's a link to the image so you know what I'm talking about: Custom Shortcut\nFunny enough, I actually figured this out because I was looking up the exact same question. I knew the application was Gwibber, I just didn't know whether there was an option or another command that launched specifically that \"Update Status\" dialog. So, I typed \"gwibber\" into a terminal window and hit Tab until it showed me the available commands that started with \"gwibber\". That's when I saw \"gwibber-poster\" and decided to give it a shot. Glad I found out about this. Hope it helps somebody else!\n", "Q: Disable trackpad and trackpoint via command line For my rotation script, I'd like to disable the trackpoint when I have the screen rotated.

I need to enter the command line alone with no GUI to install the official NVIDIA drivers. I'm trying to get my computer to work over HDMI and someone on Youtube shows how but you have to be in the Nvidia settings program.\n\nA: If your purpose is to temporarily disable GUI - you can stop the lightdm service ( or whichever greeter you're using ) with sudo service lightdm stop (14.04 and earlier) or sudo systemctl stop lightdm (since 15.04) from tty1, as shown by others already.\nIf your purpose to boot into command line for extended period of time between reboots, you can open /etc/default/grub with the choice of your text editor. I personally use nano, so for me the command would be sudo nano /etc/default/grub. Now, find GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"text\".

The check box is checked for the sound, It just doesn't record sound. I don't know what to do.\nI have Ubuntu 12.04 64bit.\nAnd Nvidia drivers don't work what so ever. So I'm just using the default Ubuntu drivers.\nI looked up the site for this application. But they don't give any instructions on sound for this program.\nThe microphone sound input works with it.

I had also huge problems with recordmydesktop, to also record my sound.\n\nA: If you have Pulse and since you have Ubuntu you probably do, then you have to install the PulseAudio Volume Control with the command \nsudo apt-get install pavucontrol\n\nWhile recordmydesktop is recording, you have to go into Pavucontrol and in the recording tab you will have to change the output to your speakers. If you don't do it while recordmydesktop is recording then it won't show up in that tab.

I found this old ubuntu forum post which got me most of the way there. \nSo far I am able to get the events logged from the router. However since I don't them logged in /var/log/syslog I am trying to set up a working filter in /etc/rsyslog.conf to put the logged events in /var/log/linksys.log.  This is where I am having trouble. \n\n\n*\n\n*First I tried filtering by the router ip address like this:\n:fromhost-ip, isequal, \"192.168.2.1\" /var/log/linksys.log\n& ~\n\nThis successfully redirects the logs as I wanted, the only problem is now I am not getting any SSHD logs in auth.log.  Needless to say this is not acceptable.\n\n*Next I tried filtering by the router name which appears in every event log:\n:msg,contains, \"RV042\" /var/log/linksys.log\n& ~\n\nAlthough this neither logs or blocks anything.\nSo I am stumped. I have no idea why SSHD is getting filtered with the :fromhost-ip filter.  SSHD is local on the machine with rsyslog (192.168.2.2).  I am thoroughly frustrated by this, any suggestions are much appreciated.\n\nA: I figured it out!  These links helped:\nhttp://www.rsyslog.com/tag/udp/\nhttp://www.rsyslog.com/doc/multi_ruleset.html\nHere's what I did:\nOpened up /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf and at the top of the file, before other all of the default filters, I added:\n# process remote messages\n# define new ruleset and add rules to it:\n$RuleSet remote\n*.*           /var/log/linksys.log\n# only messages not from 192.168.2.1 make it past this point\n\n# bind ruleset to UDP listener\n$InputUDPServerBindRuleset remote\n# and activate it:\n$UDPServerRun 514\n\n# switch back to the default ruleset:\n$RuleSet RSYSLOG_DefaultRuleset\n\n\nA: /etc/rsyslog.conf is not the right file to be editing.

I'm looking for a control to be able to change my standard display brightness in Lubuntu.  I've tried How do I set default display brightness? but my system settings does not include a Screen option.  \nI've also tried Power Manager, Monitor Settings and Screensaver under Preferences and couldn't spot anything to control this option.  The function key mappings (this is a laptop) work to change the brightness, but I'm looking for a UI option as the laptop is physically set up to be mouse-based (keyboard is hard to access with how we've got it set up).\n\nA: I tried the xrandr --output VGA1 --brightness 0.9 command from Lubuntu running on my netbook(Samsung NC110, Intel Atom N455 1.66Ghz RAM 2GB). This could only produce terminal's retort of “xrandr: Need crtc to set gamma on.”\n    Afterwards I kept searching on the web and found out about the “xbacklight -inc XX” command, which solved my problem.  The XX stands for % you want increased(-inc) or decreased(-dec), so the actual command that I used was xbacklight -dec 40 since my monitor was too bright.\nP.S.- I still would like to know how to give others with answers written feedback (other than just clicking on a \"Yes\" or \"No\") on this site, as with most of the Linux realm, user friendliness is a luxury rarely found.  Currently I only understand how to provide answers.\n\nA: Well, after a couple of minutes in Google, I came up with this:\nxrandr --output VGA1 --brightness 0.9\n\nThe above command tells the xrandr script to  \"Multiply the gamma values on the crtc currently attached to the output to specified floating value. Useful for overly bright or overly dim outputs.  However,  this is a software only modification, if your hardware has support to actually change the brightness, you will probably prefer to use xbacklight\" (from the xrandr man page). \nChange the name of the output to the one you need. I found this useful instead of all the other advice on the internet because I have a multi monitor setup and the laptop keyboard shortcuts only work on the laptop's screen.\nFinal comment, once you reboot you may have to run this command again. If you don't want to do that, add this to a script and execute that when your system boots.\n\nA: run command \n sudo apt-get install xbacklight \n\nit will install the program, which worked great on my LXDE install on Toshiba Chromebook.\nxbacklight will give you the % of screen brightness, you can see the list of commands, but xbacklight -dec XX will decrease BY XX percentage, -inc XX increase. \n\nA: For a GUI solution you can use this. Link to it from a desktop file. You need to adjust the BACKLIGHT variable.\n#!/usr/bin/gksudo sh\nBACKLIGHT=/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.0/0000:01:00.0/backlight/acpi_video0\nzenity \\\n  --print-partial \\\n  --scale \\\n  --max-value=$(cat $BACKLIGHT/max_brightness) \\\n  | \\\n  xargs -i{} -- sh -c \"echo {} > $BACKLIGHT/brightness\"\n\n\nA: The easiest way to do is by using xbacklight:\nIf not installed:\nsudo apt-get install xbacklight\n\nthen use the command accordingly:\nxbacklight -set 70\n\nExample above sets the brightness to 70% of the maximum brightness.\n\nA: xbacklight -inc XX \nworked for me - although xbacklight wasn't installed on my machine.  I had to install it first. I used inc 20 and that was just about right.\nThanks folks!\n", "Q: Cannot boot after installing 12.04 After I installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my laptop, it can't boot. I don't know why. Because when I installed it, it said installation succeeded but when I restart, it only shows me the Ubuntu desktop image.\nMy laptop specifics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Samsung Rv520\n\n*640 GB HDD\n\n*4 GB RAM\n\n*Processor: Intel Core i3\n\n*Intel HD 1.6 GB\n\nA: Try the rescue option (Ubuntu boot repair) from the LiveCD, as you may be missing the bootloader (GRUB).\n\nA: It looks like your new computer is still too new for Ubuntu 12.04's drivers and packages. I've experienced this on other computers and the most likely period of time when a stable release for Ubuntu Linux is six months after your purchase. I ran a dual-boot configuration with Ubuntu Linux 12.04 LTS and Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit and the grub loader started to quit working. If you have critical data on your Windows 7 partition, send me a message and I will give you the link to Microsoft Answers, in order to restore the Windows 7 partition.\n", "Q: how to install Ubuntu on a fresh hard drive I attempted to install Ubuntu from a USB stick to my Intel 4 3GHz computer with 80GB HDD.\nThe installer was doing well, then it said something to the effect of \"errors on the source USB, or the target HDD\"  The recommendation was to download the installer again.\nI suspected my HDD was going bad so I figured I would investigate.\nWhat I found was a partially formatted 80GB HDD. I repartitioned it via a different computer.\nNow a fresh copy of the Ubuntu USB installer is not able to move past the start-up screen (it freezes).\nI was able to purchase a new / clean HDD, but still the fresh copy of the installer still locks up after the initial opening screen (locks up after about 2 screens worth of installations steps).\nDoes this sounds like a HDD NTHS issue or a CPU/hardware/memory issue?\nor should I move to a CD image file rather than my USB stick?\nNow my computer is stuck... no OS.. no way to go back to Windows (upgrade OS CD only).\nAny insight would be greatly appreciated.\nStuck in Schenectady\nHerman Wiegman\n\nA: In this case perhaps you should create a LiveCD (since you're being told your USB stick might have a problem).\nBoot from the CD (or DVD, whatever you created) and choose \"Try Ubuntu\" when given that option.  You'll end up with an Ubuntu desktop, and if you open the Dash (top button on the Unity taskbar) and then start typing \"gparted\" (it'll probably show the icon for it before you've typed more than \"gp...\"), click on the icon, and GParted will open.  With it you can work with partitions: create, delete, resize, move, format, etc.\nIt'll be interesting to see what partitions there are on your HDD, if it's just one or if there is something else there.  Let us know what GParted shows.\n\nA: Yesterday, I helped someone to install ubuntu on a dual boot system.

Try changing your password again, and then check it out immediately by trying a command which requires sudo, e.g. sudo apt-get update -- the new password is the one that should work.\n\nA: \nPlease can anyone give me reason why this happen, and how I can stop this happening?\n\nAs far as I understood, there is a difference if you command \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo passwd <your username>, which is equivalent to the bare passwd suggested above, and \n\n*sudo passwd which changes the password of the root user. \n\n\nIt gets confusing with Ubuntu, because usage of the root user is actually minimized (you could use sudo su -u to become a fully-fledged one).  \nIf this is correct, you had changed the root password but not your log-in password.\n", "Q: wordpress restored from backup asking for ftp I backed up my /var/www/wordpress folder to my external harddisk and restored it back.

I have logged in to my wordpress as admin root. \nI dont know why I need to setup ftpd, but I tried that too. here\nI am missing something really silly here.\n\nA: While developing a WordPress site, giving www-data write access to your files can make your life a lot easier.\nThe reason is that the admin panel of WordPress allows you to change lots of configurations easily, creates the .htaccess file for you with the correct rewrite rules (depending on how you want your permalinks), installs and configures plug-ins. You even have access to an editor which allows you to edit your CSS and PHP files.\nAlthough, the editor is not that important. When you have access to the files, an IDE would be a much better choice. As for the other functionalities, they can prove to be useful sometimes.\nSo to summarize, the best configuration would be to give user ownership to root and group ownership to www-data.\nsudo chown -R root:www-data /var/www/wordpress\n\nThen give write access to www-data during development:\nsudo chmod -R g+w /var/www/wordpress\n\nOnce you are done with the development, you should revoke the write access from your files to www-data and only give that user write access on the uploads folder (This is where files uploaded from the admin end up).\nsudo chmod -R g-w /var/www/wordpress\nsudo chmod -R g+w /var/www/wordpress/wp-content/uploads\n\nAnd finally, it is best to revoke all permissions from other (You can even do this during development):\nsudo chmod -R o-rwx /var/www/wordpress\n\n", "Q: What tools can I use to download videos from Youtube and Vimeo on Ubuntu 12.04?

When it opens, run the commands below.\nsudo dpkg -i VNC-Viewer-5.0.0-Linux-x64.deb\n\nNow to be able to run the application with administrator privileges after its installed you would type \ngksudo vncviewer\n\nTo run VNC Viewer, and to run VNC Server with administrator privileges you would type\ngksudo vncserver-x11\n\nSource: MozillaZine (which cites RootSudo)\n", "Q: grub recover command line Recently the service provider link suddenly broke,while I was updating. Then suddenly while I was trying to boot, i could not. The message on my screen was grub recover missing, and I had no option but the grub recover command line. I really did not know what to do. So I installed an earlier version of ubuntu 10.04. It started to boot normally. Now my system is back to 12.04 the version i was working with. How does one handle problems like this? \n\nA: When the Service Provider link broke, your computer was probably updating GRUB.  If the GRUB updating process is interrupted, then GRUB will be broken because of the unsuccessful update.\nWhat happened was that your GRUB is broken, so it redirected you to the GRUB command line, waiting for you to type stuff into it.\nAfter that you installed Ubuntu 10.04.  Ubuntu will automatically install GRUB onto your computer, so your GRUB is recovered.  When the installation had finished, GRUB then automatically detects any Operating Systems on your computer.  It eventually found your old copy of Ubuntu 12.04 on your computer and allows you to boot into it.\nGRUB is awesome.\n", "Q: How do I add links to launcher I am new to Ubuntu; I've been using it for a couple hours now, and I encountered one little problem that I was hoping to solve. I got a program on my computer without actually using the software center or packages, it's just a folder with a executable file in it.

I was using the same connection without any problems, in Ubuntu 10.04 and Windows Vista. What might be the reason why my connection is terminating so frequently while using only the Ubuntu 12.04 version? How to resolve this issue?\nI have tried connecting to internet using usb Ethernet through my mobile phone. Then it worked out properly. Connection is not getting terminated as with wlan interface. So I think the problem might be with wlan modem. But then, how come wlan works well in Windows and older versions of Ubuntu. And the problem is for 12.04 alone.\n\nA: Install wicd network manager. It should work. It's available in Ubuntu software Center.\nIts all in the signal strength. The Network Manager would oscillate around -28db to 70db (meaning a large fluctuation). And with Wicked (WICD), it's around a -70 tops.\nI would recommend to install EtherApe or WireShark to analyze your network connection.\nsudo apt-get install wireshark\n\nsudo apt-get install etherape\n\n\nA: I'd look at power management. The card may be disconnecting if the network is inactive for more than a short period of time. You could also look at how often Ubuntu wireless tries to refresh its key.\n\nA: Appreciating the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Like you, wireless networking worked for me in version 10.04 LTS.  This was also true for questions 31483, 67077, and others that are all closed as \"too localized\".  This is an IAQ (Infrequently Answered Question).\n\n*My wireless network is slower on Ubuntu than on Windows boxes, or even the same machine booted into Windows.\n\n*I get a peculiar saw-toothed graph of ping times from my laptop to a wireless router (e.g., 10.0.0.1 or 192.0.0.1 at home).  Here are my ping milliseconds from my laptop to my coffee shop's AP, adding parenthesis to illustrate the saw-tooth cycle.\n\n(36, 59, 81, 104, 127) (47, 59, 92, 116) (36, 59, 81, 104) (24, 150;  73,92,114)\n  (38,48,81,103) (23,45,67,91)  ...\n\n\n*I can connect to some coffee shop APs and not others.  The results are almost, but not always the same.  Once in a blue moon, I do connect to an AP I had written off as not connectable.\n\n*Much of the syslog is verbose, about 50 lines for an attempt to connect.  Much is concerned with the unused IPv6.  In comparing a good connection versus a bad connection, a good connection does (DHCPDISCOVER then DHCPREQUEST then receives DHCPOFFER) while a failing connection does DHCPDISCOVER and has no DHCPREQUEST or DHCPOFFER lines.\nGathering the Information\nMany questions like this have no great information.   Here's a bit of help in gathering information:\nThe usual most relevant log is /var/log/syslog which collects all sorts of random information.  A wireless connection generally generates at least 100 lines.\n# tail -20 /var/log/syslog    ;# see the last 20 lines of the log\n# tailf /var/log/syslog       ;# watch the log expand with usage.\n# logger ====== Trying again  ;# add a message to the syslog\n\nAnother log is dmesg, the kernel ring buffer.  It might, but usually wont say anything useful.  The usual networking message is \"No IPv6 Routers Present\"\n# dmesg | tail -3   ;# look at last three lines\n[  422.328274] eth1: no IPv6 routers present\n[  474.578004] eth1: no IPv6 routers present\n[ 3327.234898] eth1: no IPv6 routers present\n\nThe ifconfig command relates to networking interfaces, both wired and unwired.

Make sure your wireless in enabled, make sure you have the right password, etc.  Boot in Windows to check.  Look for the DHCPDISCOVER but not request in /var/log/syslog.\n\n*Start seeing where networking breaks.   Ping loopback (127.0.0.1), try with wired to the access point, try pinging out (74.125.244.39 is Google), try pinging google.com (using DNS).  Try a wget on http://www.google.com.\n\n*Try blacklisting your wireless card or suspending the hardware probe using files in /etc/modprobe.d.\n\n*Try going into the network manager and giving yourself a fixed, reasonable IP address and see the router then answers you.\n\n*Try rebooting.   There are occasional problems with network cards coming back from power saving modes. \n\n*There are some known issues detailed in Hardware Support as well.\nGood luck, and I'll try to update this answer from comments.\n\nA: I apologies for the late response (since it's already solved), however, one helpful thing I found with this issue was to connect my laptop on to the wired network, and physically create the \"WEP\" password for the connection.\nIt appears Ubuntu was trying to connect to the wireless network, The router asked for a password, but Ubuntu decides to throw an \"invalid authentication\" i.e. \"Connection failed Activate connection failed.\" instead of allowing you to enter the passphrase.\nThis fixed the issue for me.\n", "Q: Psychonauts, what to do with 'psychonauts-linux-06042012-bin'? Psychonauts came in a neat file called psychonauts-linux-06042012-bin.\nThe file system calls it an executable, but I can't find a way to execute it.\nUbuntu suggested using \"PyPar2\" to open it like an archive, which made it into a bunch of .par2 files, but it then couldn't find anything else to open those.\nIt seems that other people have been able to start the game, so what should I do differently?\n\nA: Open a terminal and change to the directory where you downloaded the file, most cases will be ~/Downloads:\ncd ~/Downloads\n\nmake the file executable\nchmod +x psychonauts-linux-06042012-bin\n\nrun the installation / executable file\n./psychonauts-linux-06042012-bin\n\n\nHas an option you can also open your Home Folder and navigate to Downloads, once there right click on the downloaded file and select properties\n\non the permissions tab make sure that the Execute option is set, if not do so and close.\n\nNow you can double click you file.

This solution enables precedence for IPv4 addresses by enabling Ipv4. It did not help to execute it in seconds but did speed up the process a little bit as expected.\nThis is because parsing either IPv4 or IPV6 should not take way much time even if done with each package.\nIt was IPv6 doing it.\nsudo nano /etc/gai.conf\n\nUncomment the following line:\nprecedence ::ffff:0:0/96 100\n\nThis may be a different line for you. Make sure to select the one with /96 rule as seen above. This is CIDR representation for IPv4 addresses. it enables precedence for the same. By default it is commented out.\nSave and exit.\nsudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99force-ipv4 # (this is to make a new file)\n\nThis creates a new file and when the config in next line is added it sets the config to false allowing IPV4 traffic.\nAdd the following line to the new file:\nAquire::ForceIPv4 false;\n\nSave and exit.\n\nA: My ubuntu servers were always very fast at apt-get updates and upgrades.

One possibility is www.speedtest.net. You can also use a simple Google search to look for other sites you could use to test your Internet connection speed.\nIf testing shows that the problem is not a limitation of your Internet connection, then the next step might be to take a look at the answers to this question:\nHow can I get apt to use a mirror close to me, or choose a faster mirror?\nI suggest you start by trying the most popular answer to that question. It boils down to adding the two lines below to the top of /etc/apt/sources.list. This is supposed to encourage the update process to automatically pick a download mirror with better performance. \ndeb mirror://mirrors.ubuntu.com/mirrors.txt precise main restricted universe multiverse\ndeb mirror://mirrors.ubuntu.com/mirrors.txt precise-updates main restricted universe multiverse\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: The lines above are meant to used with Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin). For earlier releases replace precise in the two lines above with the corresponding codename of the release you are using.\n\nLucid (10.04), Maverick (10.10), Natty (11.04), Oneiric (11.10) \n\n\nIf this approach does not help or is simply not something you want to do then you might also consider letting Update Manager attempt to pick a \"fastest\" mirror. This is described in more detail in the other answers to the question I provided a link to above.\n\nA: First, 2 facts:  apt-get uses http (port 80) by default in standard linux distros. \napt-get generally downloads ~20MB of data to update the lists. If you just ran apt-get update and run it again it downloads ~100KB of data only. \nSo if you are able to browse the world wide web (i.e. websites using browser) and you are using standard distros (not customized to use any other port), nothing has been blocked by the admin which is stopping you from running this command. \nThe problem might be that requests from your machine to current servers being used for updates by apt-get are facing some issues (i.e. it might be just a download issue). \nTo solve your problem, my suggestions(as you are using ubuntu):  \nOpen update-manager -> click on settings at the bottom left -> click on first tab ubuntu software -> click on the drop down box next to Download from option -> change the server to some place which is nearer to your location by choosing other in the list. Also check the protocol being used for updates. It should be http for general users. -> Now run sudo apt-get update or use update manager to check for updates. Now things should work fine for you.\nIf things don't work even after following this, comment here.   \nSince it din't help you, it seems to be the problem of obsolete or partial files collected while trying to update some time back.  \nI would suggest you to run this commands in terminal: \nsudo mv /var/cache/apt/archives/partial{,bakjune9}\nsudo mv /var/lib/apt/lists{,bakjune9}\n\nThese commands will rename the directories where files are stored when apt-get downloads them while updating and upgrading. (You can rename them back if something goes wrong. So no risk of making situation worse than present) \nAfter that run: \nsudo apt-get update \n\nIt will download something like 20MB of data. \nIf it runs successfully, your problem is solved. \nNow you should be able to run sudo apt-get upgrade to install the updates. \nIf it does not, comment here back.\n\nA: Run\nsudo apt-get clean\n\nbefore running\nsudo apt-get update\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu can't detect my Nvidia graphics card In system details, I can't find information about my graphics card.

But I couldn't determine which package needs to be downloaded. \n\nA: Your graphics card is not supported with the latest version of the Nvidia drivers, you need to install the legacy drivers called nvidia-173 from the restricted repository.\nTo get a list of packages and dependencies necessary to install the drivers you can use this command to get that list saved to a .txtfile (source), don't worry, it will not install naything in your system:\nsudo apt-get --print-uris --yes --reinstall install nvidia-173 | grep ^\\' | cut -d\\' -f2 > nvidia-173.txt\n\nAfter you have the list and checked the .txt file you can then download the packages with wget or any other downloader tool of your choice:\nwget --input-file nvidia-173.txt\n\nthis will read each line in the nvidia-173.txt file and download it to you current directory.\nAfter you saved the files in a USB drive or any other removable media you can then just go to your other computer, change directory to where you saved the files and use sudo dpkg -i *.deb to install them.\n", "Q: Gnome Shell floating HDD icon Where does the floating hdd icon comes from?\nIt's obviously from my external HDD, but I don't want to have it there.\nOnce I click it, it goes away.

In the United States I would like to know if it is legal to use propriety video and audio codecs in Ubuntu. Specifically I would like to know if I can play mp3 files on Ubuntu, and if I can install and use the libx264 library to do video editing and export mp4 files.\nI went to Computex in Taiwan today and I went to the Ubuntu booth. A person there told me that Canonical  has paid for the right/license to use proprietary audio and video formats/codecs. Is this true? I asked the person if he could show me anything online that said this and he could not find anything. Is there any list of codecs/formats that can be used legally in the United States for the purpose of listening to audio, watching video and audio and video editing?\nI want to use OpenShot to edit some video and export it to mp4 using libx264 but I want to do it legally.\n\nA: Selling/distribution of MP3 codec binaries is illegal because they are bound by patents, mainly by the Fraunhofer Society.\nFor libre use, there are open source implementations of the standard ( iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=31537 ) and it is NOT illegal to distribute their source code. There is:\n\n\n*\n\n*LAME for encoding (http://lame.sourceforge.net/)\n\n*MAD for decoding (http://www.underbit.com/products/mad)\n\n*Mpadec for decoding (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mpadec/)\n\n\nand probably even more.\nFor more information:\n\n\n*\n\n*en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3#Licensing_and_patent_issues\n\n*en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open_source_codecs\n\n\nConcerning Canonical, they can't provide codecs with their installation media, as this would be considered as reselling patented software, that's why they provide such functionality via their ubuntu store:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://ostatic.com/blog/canonical-opens-codec-sales-and-potential-can-of-worms\n\nA: From my own understanding, for Ubuntu to fall under the open-source license, they can't have any propriety software contained, which is why it is installed afterwards.\nSo it is legal.\n\nA: I'm not a legal advisor.  But even if Canonical has paid for the right/license to use proprietary audio and video formats/codecs,  You can edit your own stuff legally, and without any problems.  But if you are editing other person's work, to that is illegal in any country.

What should I do?\n\nA: For the first time when you insert your device; a new drive (like USB Pen-Drive) is automatically mounted.\nJust browse across this drive, and search for a file with .deb extension with most probable name of the file being installer.version.something.deb\nThis deb file is the software and driver for your MTS Mblaze USB modem; which will help your system recognize the device.\nAs an extra piece of information, you USB modem hardware is supplied by a Chinese company ZTE if you are being bothered for the drivers then search ZTE's website. Alternativly just ring the MTS help-center \n\nA: I was having the same prob. How ever found the solution to 90% of the prob. Firstly you might have to add a conf file in etc folder in the system folder. The file being called wvdial.conf you can do this by using sudo command. In other words install wvdial.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install wvdial using:\nsudo apt-get install wvdial\n\n\n*Install usb-modeswitch and usb-modeswitch-data from Ubuntu Software Center\n\n*Edit /etc/wvdial.conf using:\nsudo gedit /etc/wvdial.conf\n\n\n*Add the following lines to the file:\n[Dialer mts]\n\nStupid Mode = 1\n\nInherits = Modem0\n\nPassword = mts\n\nUsername = internet@internet.mtsindia.in\n\nPhone = #777\n\n[Modem0]\n\nInit1 = ATZ\n\nSetVolume = 0\n\nModem = /dev/ttyUSB0\n\nBaud = 115200\n\nFlowControl = Hardware (CRTSCTS)\n\nDial Command = ATDT\n\nHere is the deal. At times the modem may be recognized but will not initialize. Now here is what you have to do. After installing and inserting your modem it will pop up in the network manager in the right top corner of your desktop. Now click on the enable networking option and wait for atleast 10 to 15 secs before clicking on the enable mobile connection option. Then it will connect, the thing is the modem needs that much of time in order to work. I know it sounds silly but yup its true. And if the modem stops working in the  middle after lets say a 3 hour session which is what is happening to me all you have to do is click on the enable networking option again from the start and the same process over again it should work. so far so good.  Any more updates share it.\nWell hope this helps. \n", "Q: Start application without icon in the launcher Is it possible to launch an application without icon in the launcher?\n\nA: Top prevent the application's icon to show up in Unity we may add the following line in the  application's .desktop file (found e.g. in /usr/share/applications):\nOnlyShowIn=GNOME;XFCE;KDE\n\nBy this the application will only be shown in GNOME, XFCE, or KDE but not in Unity.\nSave the modified .desktop file with another name (e.g. app-noshow.desktop) in ~/.local/share/applications to hide the launcher icon when run from there.\n\nA: Of course it is possible.\nA launcher in the Unity sidebar on the left is just an easy-to-use shortcut for launching your application.\nBut, you can also launch an application through Alt+F2 (or through terminal).\nIn order to do this, you will have to do Alt+F2, type in the program's name and hit enter:\n\nIf you want to run it from terminal, you can hit Ctrl+Alt+T, type in the command/program you want to execute and hit enter.\nIf you want, for ease of use, you can create your own desktop launcher for your application and add it to the unity sidebar.

I have Ubuntu 12.04 installed on my HP G62-453 TU Laptop. I cannot access the contents of my hard disk partition E.\n\nA: Under Linux their is no partition E:/  \nOpen your personal folder, in the left panel it should show the diffrent partions found on your system. These could have a name you gven them or just something like '200gb filesystem'\n\nA: This is assuming that you have installed Ubuntu in a dual-boot setup alongside Windows.\nOpen the terminal, and type df -h\nThis will show you the drives mounted as well as occupied and free space.  Look for the filesystem mounted at /\nThis is your Linux partition.\nNow type cd /dev/, then ls.\nYou should see several entries like\nsda sda1 sda2 sdb sdb1 sdg sdg1\n\nEach sd* is a storage volume, and the number is the partition.  The above example has two partitions (sda1, sda2) on the boot drive and two external drives available(sdb, sdg).  You need to mount the partition before accessing it. On my system, I have four partitions set up on my boot drive\nsda sda1 sda2 sda3 sda5\n\nwhere sda5 is my Linux partition, sda2 is the Windows partition and sda3 is the common storage partition.\nTo mount the drives right now, type sudo mount /dev/sdaX, where X is the number of the partion to mount. \nTo automatically mount the drives on boot, install mountmanager by typing\nsudo apt-get install mountmanager\n\nThis installs an application that allows you to configure the auto-mounting of drives upon boot.  Open it up, and in the filetree select the sd* partition available, then enter the mount point for the partition.  I use the /media/ folder as the base mount point, then you specify the mount folder.\nFor example, my /media/ folder looks like\nLibrary/ Storage/ Windows/\n\nOnce you've done this, you apply the changes via Partition -> Apply\nThis should make your partition visible in both Natutilus and the command line in /media/\n\nA: gDisk screenshot\nThe gDisk application part of the Ubuntu 15.04 apps set allows you to edit partitions. But it also displays enough info per partition for you to tell what is what, where it is, etc.\nAnd it also has a convenient \"Mount button\", just below the selected partition, it looks like a standard \"Play\" button.\n", "Q: How do I prevent immediate wake up from suspend and/or hibernation? For a few days, my Ubuntu 12.04 desktop computer has mysteriously been waking up immediately after going to suspend mode.\nSince installation, my Ubuntu 12.10 laptop computer has also been resuming immediately after suspend and hibernation.\nHow to prevent those?\n\nA: To make the fix permanent\n(I am compiling the solutions provided by Bazon, Ilikerobots, and Pavlos Theodorou - together they address my specific issue)\nTo fix the issue permanently, whether it is a USB port waking up the system or something else:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find out what is allowed to wake up your system:\n\n\n\ngedit /proc/acpi/wakeup\n\nYou might get these or similar lines:\n\nEHC1      S3    *enabled  pci:0000:00:xx.x\nEHC2      S3    *enabled  pci:0000:00:xx.x\nXHC       S3    *enabled  pci:0000:00:xx.x\n\nThen open:\n\nsudo gedit /etc/rc.local\n\nand add these lines (or similar, depending on the results above) before exit 0\n\necho EHC1 > /proc/acpi/wakeup\necho EHC2 > /proc/acpi/wakeup\necho XHC > /proc/acpi/wakeup\n\n\nA: This problem was probably caused by strange USB signals. gedit /proc/acpi/wakeup showed me, that wakeup was enabled for USB0 and USB2.\nsudo -s\necho USB0 > /proc/acpi/wakeup\necho USB2 > /proc/acpi/wakeup\n\nswitched them to disabled (checked by  gedit /proc/acpi/wakeup again or refreshing the file-view), and after that, the computer stays in suspend like it should. :-)\n\nA: This is what worked for me on my Mac Book Pro 2015\nI added the following to /lib/systemd/system-sleep/wakeup_disable\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# /lib/systemd/system-sleep/wakeup_disable\n#\n# Avoids that system wakes up immediately after suspend or hibernate\n#\n# Tested on MacBookPro 2015\n\ncase $1 in\n  pre)\n    if grep -qE '^XHC1.*enabled' /proc/acpi/wakeup; then\n        echo XHC1 > /proc/acpi/wakeup\n    fi\n    if grep -qE '^LID0.*enabled' /proc/acpi/wakeup; then\n        echo LID0 > /proc/acpi/wakeup\n    fi\n    ;;\nesac\n\n\nNote this will prevent waking up via the lid opening and via keyboard/mouse/USB device you have to push the power button.\nReferences:\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.debian.org/InstallingDebianOn/Apple/MacBookPro/Early-2015-13-inch#Immediate_wakeup_after_sleep\n\n\n*https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MacBookPro11,x\n\nA: I recently had the same symptom on Asus Zenbook Pro UX501 on Ubuntu 15.04.

In order for the microphone or the button to work on your machine, the headphone jack must also have four leads (which is unlikely) and the drivers you're using must also support the fourth lead.\nIt is unlikely that the manufacturer would provide hardware without driver support, so if you still have the manufacturer-provided OS installed, you could boot into that and test the button there.  If it works there but not in Ubuntu, then it's probably a lack of driver support.\n\nA: Sorry to say this.

I installed Ubuntu using a Live USB.\nI have a Windows partition and used GParted to create an extended partition in order to lay my new distro.\nWhen I rebooted my computer after the installation, no boot managers were displayed leaving me with no choice but to use my Windows as it's always been.\nThe only way to use my Linux partition then is to let my USB plugged and tell the BIOS to boot on it (if so, GRUB is displayed on boot).\nThen I used BCEdit for Windows to manage the OSes at the start. Now on reboot, I have the choice between Windows 7 or Linux (I managed to create a new entry in the bootmgr file).\nAnyways, selecting Linux is useless since no file has been related to the entry.\nMy question is: What file on my USB drive is responsible to load GRUB when booting from it? \nIf I knew what file on my USB drive were responsible of launching the GRUB program, I could upload it on my Windows drive and relate it to the BCEdit program.\n\nA: Try booting from USB again, then running the following command:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda (assuming /dev/sda is your hard drive)\nThis will cause the bootloader to search for all installed OS' and then add them to the list of operating systems present.\n\nA: if you want to boot ubuntu using windows boot manager(BCD perhaps ), you need to install grub on the partition where ubuntu is installed. Then you can create entry with easyBCD for grub2( because ubuntu 9.10 and earlier uses grub2 not grub) and it will be booted up.\nnow if you are able to boot windows using windows bootloader it means you haven't installed grub(actually grub2) on MBR.

What I did was edited /etc/profile as root and added the following line:\nexport PATH = /opt/my jdk 7 path/bin:$PATH\n\nAfter logging out and trying to login, I cannot, so I have tried booting in recovery mode, entering the root shell editing the file in vi but it always opens in read only mode and hence cannot be saved.\nI just need a way to delete that line and boot into Ubuntu again.\n\nA: I know this thread might be old but I had the very same problem, my PC not show grub loader nor had I have a copy of Ubuntu nearby, so on the login screen press Ctrl+Alt+F1, log in and use nano as root to remove the changes made:\nsudo -s\nnano /etc/profile\n\nThen Ctrl+Alt+F7 to switch back to GUI login screen. That's it.\n\nA: First of all, a little late, but you should not be editing the profile in /etc (or anything else in that directory if you're not sure of what you're doing).  You should make changes like that in your home directory, to the file \".profile\".  Then, if you mess up, it's easier to fix, and if you ever have more than one user, it won't affect all users.\nNext, thing is that you need to be careful with spaces for any linux command.  Spaces are what separates parts of the command, so if you actually have a space in your path or filename, you need to either use double-quotes, or a backslash in front of the space, like this: file\\ name\\ with\\ spaces.  This is called \"escaping the space\".\nTo fix your problem, you will probably need to boot from a live CD, either the original or a repair disk.  Once booted, you can find your installation on the hard drive, change to the /etc directory, and edit the file, preferably by removing your changes and making them correctly in your home directory.\nEdit:  Fixing the problem when using wubi\nI've never used wubi myself, but there are ways to access the partition either from Windows, or from a live CD or linux utility CD.  There are details in the Ubuntu WubiGuide, but here is the basic from that guide (untested by me):\nBoot the Ubuntu Desktop CD, or another LiveCD, then mount the windows partition:\nsudo mkdir /win\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /win\n\nReplace sda1 with the appropriate device (a = disk, 1 = partition number), then mount the virtual disk therein\nsudo mkdir /vdisk\nsudo mount -o loop /win/ubuntu/disks/root.disk /vdisk\n\nNow the content of the virtual disk will be visible under /vdisk. 7.04 users will have to install ntfs-3g first and specify it as fstype to gain r/w access. \n\nA: Select recovery mode at the GRUB bootloader, and then it will give you a menu.\nSelect the dpkg menu item.\nSay \"Yes\" when it asks you if you want to continue.\nIt will fix some stuff (or at least, try to). This might take a while, you can safely ignore most of the 'errors' there. \nIt will say \nFinished, press enter\n\npress enter, and then it will be in read/write mode\nso you can then select root prompt, and edit your stuff, and then reboot. \nNow, to add it to your $PATH, add the following to your ~/.profile.\nPATH=/opt/jre1.7.0_04/:$PATH\n\nand then log out, log back in and you should be good to go!\n\nA: I was stuck in a same situation and in my case sudo was not available in my PATH (when I tried in shell). This one worked out for me\n/usr/bin/sudoedit /home/yk/.profile\n\nI changed the .profile file and logged in with no problem.\n\nA: You could avoid all the rebooting & trickery if you just had a way to make the filesystem read-write in recovery mode. The following works for me:\nmount -o rw,remount /\n\nNow root can read and write, and you can do whatever you need to fix /etc/profile.\n\nA: I had the same problem today, here is what I did:\nwhen you get to the login screen:\nCTRL+ALT+F1, login to tty1; now because the PATH is bad, most commands like ls, nano, grep etc wont work. However, you can still read the .profile file with less .profile (not more) and delete it with unlink .profile (maybe .profile~ too). The you can login again.\nHope that helps someone.\n", "Q: How to install zpanel? I have bought a new server and installed Ubuntu 12.04.

Did it wipe my HD ? (I hope so) I installed ubuntu last week on an old laptop once running VISTA. First time Linux user.\nDid the new install completely wipe my HD? including all of the windows crap and documents? I sure hope so.\nIf not how do I get rid of it.\nFinally, do I need to defrag HD ?\n\nA: \nDid the new install completely wipe my HD?\n\nNo, it did not.\nIt only just reformatted and repartitioned the drive to remove references to the windows files and make room for Ubuntu and its ext4 filesystem.\nThere are easy to use tools to recover most of your files and documents from the previous installation (see e.g. this question).\nIn case you had sensible data on the drive that you don't want to be recovered you will need to completely overwrite all sectors of the drive. This was not done by an installation of Ubuntu. See this question on securely removing data.\n\nA: Do the following to see:\nInstall Gparted by opening the Terminal (search for it in the dash) and type:\nsudo apt-get install gparted\nThen, once it installs, open the application. You should see a representation of your hard drive. Look for the partition, then, that is labeled \"Windows\" or \"Vista\" or the one you recognize as the Windows one because of its size. Once you find it and know that it is the correct one, right click it and delete it. Be very careful that you don't delete a partition that you don't mean to.\nAs for defragmenting a hard drive, no. :) That is one of the greatest joys of Linux. Windows runs a filesystem known as NTFS which requires defragmenting. On Linux, we run EXT2/3/4 that stores files differently and does not require defragmenting up to a certain point. Once you get to, say, about 10% free space or so, then you should consider using defragmenting tools. But, until that point, Linux's filesystem does not require it.\nNote: When looking for the Windows partition, keep in mind that it is NTFS format.\n\nA: If you open GParted you'll be able to see what partitions you have on your HD (GParted is available in the Ubuntu Software Center).  You can see how your Ubuntu partition (or partitions, depending on how you did your installation) is formatted, how much free space - if any - you have, and if there are any extra partitions remaining from a Windows installation.  Of course, if you have only one partition, it's Ubuntu (since you're running it).\nAlthough Ubuntu can be installed on an NTFS partition, and you might have done that, if there are other partitions that are also on NTFS that might be a clue that they contain Windows data, but it's not a certainty.  It is more common to format an Ubuntu partition with filesystems such as ext3 or ext4.\nYou can also open Nautilus (the second icon in the Unity launcher, which opens your Home folder) and see if other drives are shown on the left.  Any drives you don't know about?  If you wonder, open one and see what's in it.  If you find folders and files inside, can you tell if some of them are from Windows?  \nIf you do find a partition containing Windows, and you want to get rid of it, the easiest way is to use GParted to delete the partition that it's in.  Of course, doing things with partitions is pretty much a one-way operation (yes, there are some tools to attempt recovery, but they're really for emergencies and not good to work into your plans), so you need to be sure before you commit.\nAnd no, you don't need to defrag your Ubuntu partition, especially if you've used one of the Linux filesystems (such as ext3 or ext4).\n\nA: According to your post, all partitions that existed of the Hard Drive were deleted prior to Ubuntu installation.  So to answer your question YES it Did wipe my HD ?.  and no need to defrag.\nUbuntu by default uses Ext4.

I just recently bought a HP DV6T-7000 Quad Edition. It has an Intel HD 4000 and a Nvidia GeForce GT 650M 2GB with Optimus. I read that I could use bumblebee to make optimus work, so I installed it. I also installed bumblebee-nvidia and nvidia-current from the ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates ppa. I rebooted, but when I tried to run anything with optirun, the computer would wait ten seconds or so, then do a hard shutdown. I got no log messages from bumblebee, Xorg, or optirun, either. I have purged and reinstalled bumblebee, bumblebee-nvidia, and nvidia-current. I have also turned off power management for nvidia in the bumblebee.conf file to no avail. I am out of ideas about this, and I need both graphics options. Any ideas would be much appreciated.\nUPDATE:\nToday (6/14/12), I updated my kernel (to version 3.2.0-25) and reinstalled bumblebee-nvidia and nvidia-current (from ppa:upubuntu-com/nvidia with driver version 295.59) so the new driver would build against the new kernel. I noticed several things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Optirun worked (with various errors).\n\n*I had to modprobe nvidia-current and modprobe -r nvidia-current before I got optirun to stop telling me that the card fell off the bus.\n\n*Once I did that, I was able to run non-OpenGL applications with optirun; however, running OpenGL applications would give me the error Xlib: extension \"GLX\" missing on display \":8\".\n\n*Looking this up quickly yielded the following page: https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/wiki/Troubleshooting which listed my issue. Following the instructions in the section resulted in my having the same issue (shutdowns) that I posted about originally.\n\n\nI also found this article, where someone said in the comments that he experienced the same issue if he did not run a cuda program before running optirun. (comment number 9). I will try this and see if it works, if it does maybe I can add a quick cuda program to my init scripts?\nThanks to everyone who already replied, I really appreciate your help.\nUPDATE #2:\nToday (6/23/12), I switched to the xorg-edgers ppa to see if the newer drivers/xorg/etc would fix my problem. Now I'm getting the same errors listed above in numbers 1, 2, and 3. I have not tried step 4 yet because I do not want to wreck something up like I did last time (at least now non-gl applications run).\nAlso, CUDA is getting me nowhere due to make errors, so for now, that's out of the question.\n\nA: I had the same problem and this solution helped me resolve it.\nIn /etc/bumblebee/xorg.conf.nvidia I put the line with ConnectedMonitor and instead added Option \"UseDisplayDevice\" \"none\".\n\nA: it doesn't work because support for our cards is only available in the latest driver released yesterday. Everything up to this point only breaks your machine. Also wouldn't recommend purging nvidia-* like the previous user has stated that will remove ubuntu-desktop as well causing more issues.\nVersion:295.59 Certified\nRelease Date:2012.06.11\nOperating System:Linux 64-bit\nLanguage:English (U.S.)\nFile Size:55.8 MB\n\nAdded support for the following GPUs:\nNVS 5400M\nNVS 310\nGeForce GT 620M\nGeForce GT 640M\nGeForce GT 640M LE\nGeForce GT 650M\nGeForce GTX 660M\nGeForce GTX 670M\nGeForce GTX 675M\nGeForce GTX 555\nGeForce GTX 560 SE\nGeForce GT 415\nGeForce GTX 460 v2\n\nDisabled the use of certain OpenGL optimizations with Autodesk Maya and Mudbox, due to conflicts between these applications and the optimizations. Some performance loss in Autodesk Maya and Mudbox is possible, as a result.\nFixed a behavior issue where redundant DPMS state transitions were leading to unexpected screen blanking on DisplayPort displays.\n\nA: According to the official bumblebee-project page, you have to undertake the following installation steps in Ubuntu:\n1) open terminal window and type in\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable\n\nIf you are on Ubuntu 11.04 or older and want newer drivers (recommended) than the ones available in the official repos, run:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates \nsudo apt-get update\n\n2) To install Bumblebee using the proprietary nvidia driver:\n\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia\n\n3) Reboot or re-login.\nAs you can see, installing nvidia-current is not required. Following these steps exactly, bumblebee installs the current nvidia drivers with the bumblebee-nvidia package. So solve your problem, undo all customizations and purge the nvidia-* packages (though, a clean install of ubuntu is recommended) and follow the instructions above strictly. I hope this helps.\n\nA: It's a bug. I see it, too, although updating the driver didn't help me. I've opened issue 203 to track it.\n", "Q: What to do when a bootable USB stick doesn't work properly?

There are no programs like disk clean-up or defragmentation in ubuntu, so do we really need it...or if there are some utility packages for ubuntu.\n\nA: Ubuntu/Linux uses a journaling file system but there are userspace defragmentation tools, like Shake and defrag for ext3.\n\nShake\n\nWorks by allocating space for the whole file as one operation, which will generally cause the allocator to find contiguous disk space. If there are files which are used at the same time, Shake will try to write them next to one another. \n\nDefrag\n\nWorks by copying each file over itself (so technically it is not defragging...). However, this strategy works only if the file system has enough free space. A true defragmentation tool does not exist for ext3.\n\nHowever, modern Linux filesystems keep fragmentation at a minimum by keeping all blocks in a file close together, even if they can't be stored in consecutive sectors. Some filesystems, like ext3 and ext4, effectively allocate the free block that is nearest to other blocks in a file. Therefore it is not necessary to worry about fragmentation in a Linux system.\n\next4: Extent\n\next4 uses extent so it has a new program e4defrag as part of the e2fsprogs. So it is possible to defrag ext4. But if you are thinking it will speed up your system you are wrong. \nAn extent is a contiguous area of storage in a computer file system, reserved for a file. When a process creates a file, file-system management software allocates a whole extent. When writing to the file again, possibly after doing other write operations, the data continues where the previous write left off. This reduces or eliminates file fragmentation and possibly file scattering too.\nAn extent-based file system (i.e., one that addresses storage via extents rather than in single blocks) need not require limiting each file to a single, contiguous extent.\nMore info at kernel.org\n\nA: Ubuntu does not need defragmentation because it uses ext4 file system which is less prone to fragmentation. You can install bleachbit package from the Ubuntu software center. It helps you clean junk.

Earlier after installing XP on my system it failed to boot in Windows 7, which I restored easily using EasyBCD.\nIf I install Ubuntu 11 will I be able to boot my Windows 7 also? Will grub overwrite the EasyBCD entry for XP?\n\nA: By installing Ubuntu with the option \"Install side by side with Windows 7\" for a dual-boot installation you will replace the MBR and by this also your Easy BCD bootloader by Grub2.\nBefore you install Ubuntu you will have to delete the partition that holds Windows XP to make space for the Ubuntu OS. No need to format or partition at this point, the installer will do that for you later.\nWhen your disk is fairly standard partitioned then Grub2 will detect any exisiting Windows 7 installation, and will offer a menu choice at boot to choose the OS you want to run. Thus, if you have a spare partition you may also install Ubuntu as triple-boot with Windows 7 and Windows XP.\nIn theory it is also possible to chainload Grub from Easy BCD but this is a rare installation type, and thus not really recommended.\nIn case your Windows Boot Record fails to start Windows 7 you may have to rebuild it with the help of a Windows repair or installation CD.

Will it work OK?\nsudo apt-get install ecrypt-utils\nsudo ecryptfs-migrate-home -u USERNAME\n\nThank you,\nMatthew\n\nA: After you have encrypted your home directory using the ecryptfs-migrate-home command, your home directory is always encrypted, irrespective of what various programs you are actively using.\nYou can see the encrypted files in /home/.ecryptfs/matthew/.Private. What you see in /home/matthew directory is actually the decrypted version of files present in /home/.ecryptfs/matthew/.Private. Note that files present in /home/matthew are not saved anywhere, they are just decrypted on-the-fly.\nFor example, when you try to access /home/matthew/myfile.txt, ecryptfs will look for the encrypted version of this file in /home/.ecryptfs/matthew/.Private, decrypt it and display the decrypted version as /home/matthew/myfile.txt.\nSimilarly, when you write to the file /home/matthew/myfile.txt, ecryptfs will encrypt the content and save it inside /home/.ecryptfs/matthew/.Private instead.\nThis is actually completely seamless and transparent to the user. You can access your home directory just like you used to before encryption.\nYour files are inaccessible until you login (/home/matthew directory is (almost) empty (some files are present to make the encryption work).). However, do note that once you login, /home/matthew will be mounted to show the decrypted version of /home/.ecryptfs/matthew/.Private and any running programs will be able to access files available in your home directory.\nI hope this clears your doubts.\nP.S.

I get to the login window and everything looks ok, then I type my password, the desktop image shows up and... everything goes blank. It does not happen when I just login as a guest.  \n\nWhen possible I work with my laptop connected to an external screen via the VGA port. The problem comes when I boot the computer without that secondary screen connected:\n\n\n*\n\n*The login screen comes out ok.\n\n*After login the screen goes black, but I can hear the login sound.\n\n*If I hit ctr + alt + backwards-delete and login again sometimes it is fixed, but not all.\n\n*If I log in as a different user everything is OK. Then I log in as my user and sometimes it works.\n\n\nTo have a screen I have to plug a monitor. Although I have turned on the laptop display with that monitor on, if I reboot it goes blank again after login, even if I turn off the external monitor before turning off the computer. \nI've managed to get my screen back with my username after going into recovery mode, but only sometimes. Failsafe would not load after second screen asking me what I wanted to do (no mouse to click nor keyboard working).\nMy computer is a LDLC Aurore BB1-i5 -8 -S1.\nWhich is the configuration file that keeps the information about the monitors using Displays under lightgdm and where is it?

E.g.:\nDISPLAY=:0 xrandr --auto\n\nThe monitors.xml config file is what GNOME uses to set up your multihead layout, however it's unlikely to be the source of your trouble.  Theoretically deleting it and rebooting would force GNOME to go back to its defaults, if it was a bug in the GNOME config tool.\n/etc/X11/xorg.conf is what X uses to configure itself.  With your Intel HD graphics system you shouldn't need an xorg.conf at all; if there is one present, you can try deleting it and rebooting.  But I don't think that's the source of your trouble either.\nI don't think your .dmrc is relevant.  You could test going into a guest session and see if you can reproduce it there; if you can then it's not going to be any of your user config files.\nBeyond that, there's a variety of things that can cause this, but without seeing some logs or more test results it's hard to guess what it could be.\nWith Intel video cards, only two of your outputs can be live at one time.  Especially with these newer systems they have a lot more than two possible outputs (HDMI, DVI, VGA, LVDS, ...) and there are various ways the linux kernel can get confused and hook up to the wrong thing.  Sometimes it's a bit of a race condition what outputs get enabled.  Some of the outputs that the video card is capable of aren't even hooked up to a physical port on your computer.\nIf the system were in front of me, the things I'd start looking at would be xrandr to see what possible outputs were present and what ones X thinks are connected.  Next I'd enable graphics debugging (sudo xdiagnose, first option), and then reboot and study dmesg from with and without the problem to see how the kernel was picking which outputs to turn on.\nHopefully that gets you on a productive path.  Blank screen bugs can be caused by a lot of different things and it's hard to diagnose it merely based on symptoms, but the above steps should get you far enough into the problem that it'll become diagnosable.\n\nA: on Xubuntu 13.10 the file you want to delete is \n~/.config/xfce/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/displays.xml\nhave a look for a similar file on your distribution.\nmaybe it is named monitors.xml\n\nA: Refresh your monitor config using the xrandr command line tool:\nxrandr --auto\n\nAccording to xrandr manpage, this will enable all screens that are connected but not displayed; and it will disable all screens that are 'enabled' but not actually connected.\nFor me, my laptop screen didn't wake up after sleep. My dual monitor was literally half awake. When I tried to open settings manager, it opened on my sleeping laptop screen, so was not visible. Fortunately, I was able to open terminal using a keyboard shortcut, and this displayed where I could see it, on the half-awake dual monitor. xrandr --auto restored the screens to their prior state.\n\nA: The symptoms in my case were similar to what you have described. Mine went wrong because I turned off the Laptop display. Here's how I solved it(sounds simpler):\n\n\n*\n\n*In Display, first I tick the mirror displays and apply the configuration. and automagically, my laptop screen goes visible (maybe the config is rewritten).\n\n*I rebooted it (Might be an optional step).\n\n*Then I untick back the mirror display, and the previous configuration goes back as I wanted.\n\n\nA: I used the FN + F8 key on my laptop. It could be different for your but look for the Function + F key that matches displays.\nYou can then go into settings and in \"Displays\" click on \"Primary Display\" and a dropdown appears where you can click \"Built-in display\".\n\nA: Similar problems...\nMonitor goes blank with \"no signal\", but xrandr shows it connected...\nIf I tell xrandr make any sort of change (it must be a change)\nthen the display is reset and it all comes back.\nFor example, have xrandr turn it off and on...\nxrandr --output DP-1-1 --off\nxrandr --output DP-1-1 --auto\n\nHowever it losses its position information and just becomes a clone, until I again reset the position.  Any windows on that display get moved to make them at least partially visible in the other display, though I have found it shift a LOT of windows which should not have been effected too.  Basically it is a horrible fix.\nThis fixes the problem some of the time...\nxset dpms force suspend # or standby or off (same result)\nxset dpms force on\n\nThis is the best solution I found so far, but depends on your setup...\nMove the display just a little (one pixel), then moving it back!\nIt is enough of a change to get xrandr to resurect the monitor and does not cause my application windows to suddenly change position.\nxrandr --output DP-1-2 --pos 1921x0;    # shift one pixel\nxrandr --output DP-1-2 --pos 1920x0;    # shift it back\n\n", "Q: What is an ACPI GPE storm?

It's main function is power management, along with hardware device configuration.\nA GPE in ACPI is a General Purpose Event. Think of it as an interrupt - the hardware is informing the OS (via ACPI) that something happened. The \"something\" usually includes things like plugging/unplugging your AC adapter, closing/opening the lid of your laptop, etc.\nEC is the embedded controller which provides ACPI functions on your motherboard.\nA GPE storm occurs when the EC starts sending hundreds or thousands of \"events\" per second to the OS -- these are either spurious (bogus), or due to some fault in the underlying hardware. e.g. a failure in your battery's charging controller leads the ACPI EC to think that the battery is being removed and reinserted hundreds of times per second.\nTransactions will use polling mode means that to handle the storm, the OS will stop using GPEs/interrupts to be informed of ACPI events and will instead -- on its own schedule -- \"poll\" or proactively ask the ACPI EC if any events it should know of have occurred. This way, the OS can still effectively perform ACPI functions while not being overwhelmed with a \"GPE storm\".\n\nAs for your particular problem, yes, this error can certainly affect system stability and usually means something is wrong with your hardware and not Ubuntu/the kernel.

But it would be easier if I could just do \"$ compiz --replace\" in the other console and not have to lose work or anything. \nBut when I do this it says it can't open the display, makes sense because the display is open in console 7. Is there any way I can easily redirect a command to another console for it to be run there?\nLike for instance, be in console 1 and execute \"$ compiz --replace\" on console 7?\n\nA: It's quite simple in theory and appears to work with compiz --replace, but other programs may not be so cooperative.\n\n\n*\n\n*Login to the console session after Ctrl-Alt-F1, and type:\n\n*\n\n*export DISPLAY=:0.0 (0 is the default display for the GUI/X)\n\n\n*Followed by compiz --replace, etc.\n\n*This simply sets the DISPLAY environment variable in your console session to that of your GUI session, hopefully fooling programs into thinking they are on that display and then operating on that display.\n\n", "Q: How to make JWM work in Ubuntu 12.04? I have installed the JWM on Ubuntu 12.04 via the Software Centre, but it doesn't work. When I choose the JWM session from LightDM, it only shows a black screen. \nIt worked when I had another computer with Ubuntu 11.10, where I had the same problem after the JWM installation. But once, by chance, I chose to start JWM from a Fluxbox session. And after that, i was able to start JWM also from LightDM.\nBut this solution does not work for me on Ubuntu 12.04. JWM never starts.\n\nA: You need a .jwmrc file in your ~/ (home directory)\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=174188\nhas a few examples.  Keep in mind the WHOLE interface must be configured by hand. You actually had successfully logged into the JWM, but with no config there was not even a panel or menu, etc....

First off, try blacklisting airo_cs (It's for PCMCIA cards only) and rebooting. If that doesn't work, read below.\nAlso see this page which says that the Aironet card does not support 802.11g/n or WPA2.\nI also read somewhere that the airo driver makes a shadow of wlan0 as eth1. Try doing sudo ifup eth1 and see if that enables your wireless.\nFrom information I found on the Lenovo site it seems that you have to install the Cisco Aironet Client Utilities (ACU). Here is a link to the search results that will get you where you want to go.

Track names, durations, and even count are incorrect.\n\n*Sometimes, they will first show the tracks for cd #1, then continue onto cd #2 if cd #2 has more tracks than #1.\n\n*Sound Juicer seems to be unable to find any track durations at all, even for single cd's.\n\n\nObviously, this is a pain when I'm trying to rip double cd's. And I have a fair number of them, which I want to rip.\nThis happens on both my machines (a slightly aging iMac, and a 1-year-old Sony Vaio). However, on previous versions of Ubuntu, this never happened. All on the same machines. So I suspect 12.04 is using a different lib for extracting audio cd data.\nJust for kicks, I tried with Linux Mint 13, and there it works correctly, even though it claims to be based on Ubuntu 12.04 and therefore should be using (partially) the same software. So if the Mint guys can fix it, I should be able to do it too, right?\nSo, my question: what changed in 12.04 that could cause this? And more importantly: what can I do to fix it?\nUPDATE Installed versions of relevant software packages, according to Synaptic:\n\n\n*\n\n*libmusicbrainz3-6: 3.0.2-2.1\n\n*libmusicbrainz4-3: 4.0.0-0ubuntu1\n\n*sound-juicer: 3.4.0-1ubuntu1\n\n*rhythmbox: 2.96-0ubuntu4\n\n\nA: Fwiw, I was annoyed by the same problem, and others... Sound Juicer is a decent entry-level ripper but has lots of issues like this which have remained unfixed for a very long time.\nMy own solution was to switch to a command line CD ripper, abcde.  You set up an ~/.abcde.conf file with your preferences for what encoder to use, how to name files, and so on.  It seems to do a much better job of looking up track listings, and even fills in Genre, which I always had to do manually with Sound Juicer.  In my experience of about 40 cd rips so far the track listings are 99% proper, and it lets you edit in a terminal editor to get that last 1% correct.\nSo, it's a bit more technical than a GUI ripper but much more flexible and IMHO less buggy.  I tested it out on a couple double-cd albums and it worked great.\nThis is the tutorial I used; he gives several sample config files for different common cases:  http://www.andrews-corner.org/abcde.html\nPretty much I just went with the mp3 example he listed.  My only significant change was I wanted my music files to be all lowercase with no spaces or special characters, so redid the mungefilename() function like this:\nmungefilename ()\n{\n  echo \"$@\" | sed s,:,-,g | tr / _ | tr -d \\'\\\"\\?\\[:cntrl:\\]\\(\\)\\* \\\n       | sed s,\\ ,_,g | tr [:upper:] [:lower:]\n}\n\nBut the one in that example is perfectly serviceable.\n\nA: Answering my own question:\nThe Asunder CD Ripper (available through the Software Center) solves the problem.\nIt doesn't use MusicBrainz, so I'm guessing that that is the culprit. This bugreport seems to back up that hypothesis.\nI'm not super happy with this solution (Asunder doesn't support a lot of metadata fields and besides, I'd much rather rip my cds through Rhythmbox), so I'm not accepting this answer just yet. But I thought I'd mention this for other people who might have the same problem.\n\nA: Known issue:\nhttp://tickets.musicbrainz.org/browse/MBS-2693\n", "Q: Accessing an old hard drive on a usb adapter with ubuntu 11 I am in search of the information that will help me access my old 3.5inch on an external usb adapter, with my laptop. Or if someone can tell me how to do that right here that would be better.\nThanks\n\nA: In theory, it should just work.  That is, if the 3.5 inch disk is connected properly, when you plug in the USB connecting the external disk to your computer, Ubuntu should just recognize it.  Then, it should either appear on the sidebar, or when you open a folder, you should see it under 'devices.'\nIf that isn't happening, then I would guess that it's a hardware issue and not a problem with Ubuntu.  To verify this, you could try plugging it into a different computer and see if it works there.  \n", "Q: How can I make the Windows game Feltstars work on Ubuntu?

I am thinking of buying a new laptop, and need Ubuntu as my OS. Is it true that the latest Intel i3, i5, i7 CPUs work properly immediately after install, or do I need to install some additional software/drivers for them to work? \nI'm just curious if it is that simple, and I didn't find this answer searching the internet.\n\nA: I tested a Second Generation Sandy Bridge (i7 2600) and a 3rd Generation Ivy Bridge (i7 3770T). In both cases they worked out of the box, like all Intel CPUs.\nIn the 12.04, which uses the 3.2 kernel, many performance improvements were backported from 3.3 back to 3.2 to use in 12.04. So both Sandy and Ivy should work nicely. There are even more enhancements for both architectures that we will find in the upcoming 12.10 which will benefit even more this type of hardware.\nIf you want to see if the CPU is correctly handled a simple command would be:\ncat /proc/cpuinfo this will give you ALL the information about the CPU. Since it is a multi-core CPU, you will see a lot of information. Other ways are sudo lshw -c cpu and sudo dmidecode -t processor.\n\nA: Dell Vostro 3460 Ivy Bridge i5 3210M, nvidia 630M, Ubuntu 12.04 x64\nInstalled without any problems, but then I've encountered random freezes, solved by updating kernel to 3.3.x version. \nIf you are using nvidia hybrid graphics (optimus) I recommend to install bumblebee\nWithout Bumblebee, with additional drivers\nbattery life ~ 2.30 hours, \nwith bumblebee ~5.30-6.30 hours (without using discrete card) with the same load.\n\nA: Be careful Beni. Sometimes things don't work out as smoothly as we expect. I just installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my new laptop (HP Pavilion dv4) which has a 3rd gen. core i7 processor as well as a separate nVidia VGA card. That did not go well. I had issues from the very beginning. First of all my Ubuntu live CD booted into a blank screen. Had to change some kernel mode settings to get past that. The blank screen issue returned after the installation completed. So now I have to always boot my system with the \"nomodeset\" kernel flag. \nThen there were issues due to 2 VGA cards (Intel HD and nVidia). Turns out this hybrid graphics concept doesn't work well on Linux yet. There are lots of related threads on this site regarding these problems. So please take some time to go through them. Right now I'm running solely on Intel HD. The nVidia card is just sitting there doing nothing.\n\nA: Yes, both the 2nd and 3rd generation (latest) i3/i5/i7 processors and built-in graphics will work out of the box in Ubuntu 12.04. The 2nd-gen usually have the suffix -2xxx and HD3000 graphics while 3rd have -3xxx and HD4000 graphics. e.g. i3-2310M is 2nd-gen i3, while i5-3520M is 3rd-gen i5.\nHowever, many laptops also come with a second discrete (separate) graphics card from AMD/Nvidia (called hybrid graphics), and you will need to install the drivers for those for optimal performance. But it's an easy process, and can be done with two clicks from Settings...Additional Drivers.\n\n\nA: On my Sony VAIO laptop with i7 processor, I was initially unable to start a VM with 64-bit Ubuntu.

I assume the built in driver is using a more abstract interface.\nThe problem with using the synclient tools is persisting the changes that you want to keep.

If I go many days without shutting down the computer and instead just put it to sleep, is there risk of any damage occurring to my computer? Is this not recommended or bad for the computer in any way? Sleep does cause a small icon to light up on my computer, will this prematurely burn out this light or prematurely wear out anything?\n\nA: In short: No, don't worry about it.  Sleep will cause very minimal wear and tear.  If you're interested in learning more, read on.\nThe light that you see on when your computer is on standby is an LED (light emitting diode).  LEDs can last up to hundreds of thousands of hours (according to http://www.green-energy-efficient-homes.com/faq-led-lights-burn-out.html), so you shouldn't worry about it burning out.\nWhen your computer is on standby or is in sleep mode, most of the computer is 100% off.  That includes your processor, hard drive, network cards (usually), and just about anything else.  The main exception is your RAM (memory), which is necessary to allow your computer to resume quickly.  This needs to stay on because your computer basically forgets everything in its RAM when it's powered off.  I haven't ever heard of a computer being on sleep for a long time damaging the RAM, though it is theoretically possible.\nIf you're really worried or really energy conscious, you can use hibernate.  This saves a copy of your RAM to your hard drive.  That's basically a compromise between a full shut down and sleep.  Your RAM is saved, so your computer can remember what you were doing, but it's saved to your hard drive, so your RAM doesn't have to stay powered.  It takes a little longer to hibernate and resume from hibernation than it would for sleep, and it doesn't work 100% well on all computers (same deal with sleep), but it's generally pretty good.\nOne other thing to keep in mind is that if your computer loses power (ie, a desktop that gets unplugged or a laptop that runs out of battery while asleep -- because computer still use up a small amount of power while asleep), it will be completely fine if it was hibernating or powered off, but if your computer was asleep, you will lose any work that you didn't save.  It won't damage your computer, but it does mean that you can't completely count on your computer being able to 'wake up' after going to sleep if something bad happens to it.\n", "Q: Which one is the Official Ubuntu Channel?

One is 1920x1080 (the left screen), and the other is 1440x900 (the right screen).\nRight now, I have it set up such that the tops of both monitors are aligned.  That way, when I have my mouse at the very top of the left screen and I move my mouse to the right, it will move seamlessly to the right screen.  However, if my mouse is on the bottom 180 pixels of the left screen and I move my mouse to the right, it won't move to the right screen, so I have to move my mouse up before I move it to the right because the right screen is smaller than the left screen.\nMy desired functionality: if I am at the bottom of the left screen and I move my mouse to the right, it should appear at the bottom of the right screen.\n\nA: I was running into the same issue and as others have pointed out Ubuntu sees your monitors looking something like this (maybe order is the other way around):\n+----------++----------------+\n|          ||                |\n|          ||                |\n+----------+|                |\n            |                |\n            +----------------+\n\nIn this example when your mouse is in the right monitor on the bottom and the mouse is moved straight left you hit a dead zone where you can't cross screens. I modified the bash file that cassm posted to have the mouse height be proportional when crossing so if you cross your mouse 3/4 the way up from the left monitor, the mouse appears 3/4 the way up on the right monitor.\nTo run the script I ran follow the instructions below:\n1) Make sure to setup your monitors right with the picture in the script (ONE ABOVE IS DIFFERENT) in Ubuntu's Displays settings \n2) Make a text file called \"mousejumper.sh\" or anything ending in .sh\n3) Right click on file and change Properties to make it executable\n4) Copy and paste the script into file\n    #! /bin/bash\n    # Cursor relocation script by Cass May <cass@cassm.net>\n\n    # LEFTX and RIGHTX are the screen boundaries, which triggers cursor relocation\n    # LEFTMONHEIGHT and LEFTMONHEIGHT are the heights in pixels of the left and right monitor\n            # minus 1, because computers start counting at 0... so 1920 pixels heigh becomes 1919\n    LEFTX=\"1919\"\n    LEFTMONHEIGHT=\"1080\"\n\n    RIGHTX=\"1920\"\n    RIGHTMONHEIGHT=\"2159\"\n\n    # Size in pixels to jump over the screens with when you hit the boundary (ex: if 5, jumps from x = 1919 to x=1924)\n    BUFFER=\"5\"\n\n\n    # In Ubuntu Displays settings window the two monitors must be setup to look like this:\n    #             +----------------+\n    #             |                |\n    # +----------+|                |\n    # |          ||                |\n    # |          ||                |\n    # +----------++----------------+\n    #\n    # If the monitor setup is in a different order (ex: larger screen on left side) \n    # or there are more than two monitors, then the script will need to be modified\n\n    # Tip: Set \"Sticky Edges\" to On in the Displays settings window because \n    # the script checks coordinates every 0.### seconds, and sticky edges\n    # keeps your mouse there longer\n\n\n    while true; do # keep loop going to run all the time, do a slight pause for performance\n\n        # grab cursor position, and extract x and y position\n        CURSORPOSITION=\"$(xdotool getmouselocation)\"\n        XPOS=\"$(grep -o '[0-9]\\+' <<< \"$CURSORPOSITION\" | awk 'NR==1{print $1}')\"\n        YPOS=\"$(grep -o '[0-9]\\+' <<< \"$CURSORPOSITION\" | awk 'NR==2{print $1}')\"\n        #echo \"Mouse position is: ($XPOS, $YPOS)\"\n\n\n        # if XPOS is 1920 then on right 4k monitor\n        if [ $XPOS = $RIGHTX ] \n        then \n            #echo \"Starting jump function\"\n            # find % height then convert\n            # Input is 0-2159, Output is 1080-2159\n            NEWYPOS=$(echo \"(($LEFTMONHEIGHT+$YPOS/$RIGHTMONHEIGHT*$LEFTMONHEIGHT))\" | bc -l)\n            #echo \"YPOS with floats is: $NEWYPOS\"\n            NEWYPOS=$(echo \"$NEWYPOS\" | bc -l | xargs printf \"%1.0f\") \n            NEWXPOS=$(($RIGHTX-$BUFFER))\n            # Move Mouse to other screen with a few pixel buffer on the screen edge\n            #echo \"Mouse jumped from right to left from: ($XPOS, $YPOS) to ($NEWXPOS, $NEWYPOS)\"\n            xdotool mousemove \"$NEWXPOS\" \"$NEWYPOS\"\n\n\n        # if XPOS is 1919 then on left 1080 monitor\n        elif [ $XPOS = $LEFTX ] \n        then \n            #echo \"Starting jump function\"\n            # find % height then convert\n            # Input is 0-2159, Output is 1080-2159\n            NEWYPOS=$(echo \"((($YPOS-$LEFTMONHEIGHT)/$LEFTMONHEIGHT*$RIGHTMONHEIGHT))\" | bc -l)\n            #echo \"YPOS with floats is: $NEWYPOS\"\n            NEWYPOS=$(echo \"$NEWYPOS\" | bc -l | xargs printf \"%1.0f\") \n            NEWXPOS=$(($LEFTX+$BUFFER))\n            # Move Mouse to other screen with a few pixel buffer on the screen edge\n            #echo \"Mouse jumped from left to right from: ($XPOS, $YPOS) to ($NEWXPOS, $NEWYPOS)\"\n            xdotool mousemove \"$NEWXPOS\" \"$NEWYPOS\"\n\n        fi\n        sleep 0.05\n    done\n\n5) Change these values in the script to match your monitor specs\nLEFTX=\"1919\"\nLEFTMONHEIGHT=\"1080\"\n\nRIGHTX=\"1920\"\nRIGHTMONHEIGHT=\"2159\"\n\nMy monitors were 1920x1080 on the left and 3840x2160 on the right.\nIf you need help finding your monitors values use this little bash script and move your mouse around:\n#! /bin/bash\n    while true; do # keep loop going to run all the time, do a slight pause for performance\n            # grab cursor position, and extract x and y position\n        CURSORPOSITION=\"$(xdotool getmouselocation)\"\n        XPOS=\"$(grep -o '[0-9]\\+' <<< \"$CURSORPOSITION\" | awk 'NR==1{print $1}')\"\n        YPOS=\"$(grep -o '[0-9]\\+' <<< \"$CURSORPOSITION\" | awk 'NR==2{print $1}')\"\n        echo \"Mouse position is: ($XPOS, $YPOS)\"\n\n        sleep 0.1\ndone\n\n6) Run it in terminal with ./mousejumper.sh\nI don't want to have this running all the time so I'm not going to have the system launch it on startup.

I have not managed to test it with multiple monitors, but I think the settings will work for you.

As the two are aligned at the top, your mouse will move smoothly if you move right to left and vice versa.\nBut this won't work for the bottom edge, since the bottom of the left screen has 180 pixels more height than the right screen.  According to this question, it is a known bug in the X window system\nThe solution shown may work for you if you're using NVIDIA hardware and drivers, but otherwise you may be stuck.  I don't have this issue running Windows 7 with different resolution dual monitors.  \n\nA: I wrote this Python script inspired by the answers from @cubash and @cassm. It should be less resource-intensive than using bash and starting a coupld of new xdotool processes at every loop iteration.\nThis script polls the mouse position at the given FPS and warps the pointer to the other screen when it \"bumps\" against the edge.\nThis allows to teleport the mouse to a given location if it gets stuck at a certain x- or y-coordinate. However, it won't allow a smooth interpolation of the coordinates, mapping a 0..1080p to 0..3840, because for half of the edge of the screen, the cursor will go from the area of one monitor to the other without stopping at the edge, and the script won't have the time to detect its position (since it works by polling).\nYou could extend it to record the previous cursor location, and \"scale\" the coordinates when the previous vs. current locations are on different monitors (e.g. the cursor was at 1900x,540y (around the middle of the right edge of the HD screen) at the previous loop iteration, and is at 1950x,540y (around a quarter of the left edge of the 4K screen) at the current loop iteration, therefore there was a HD→4K transition, so the y coordinate can be multiplied by two to place the cursor in the correct position).\nOther alternative: put a large amount of empty space between the monitors, like so xrandr --output DP-1 --pos 0x1080 --auto --output eDP-1 --pos 2920x0, so that the script has enough time to grab the mouse when it is in the limbo between the screens:\n                         +------+\n                         |      |\n+----+                   |  4K  |\n| HD | [1000px of space] |      |\n+----+                   +------+\n\nOther alternative: \"bump\" nearly everywhere by making the screens touch by just one pixel xrandr --output DP-1 --pos 0x3839 --auto --output eDP-1 --pos 1920x0:\n      +------+\n      |      |\n      |  4K  |\n      |      |\n+----++------+\n| HD |\n+----+\n\nIt seems that if the screens are touching by at least one pixel, the mouse will bump against the edges (which gives time for the script to poll for its location and teleport it), but if the screens aren't touching, then the mouse is allowed to go in the \"limbo\" that is not mapped to any screen. There's probably a way to declare \"dead zones\" for the mouse, and prevent it from entering those, which would allow the cursor to consistently bump against the edge and let it be detected by the script.\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nfrom Xlib import display\nfrom time import sleep\nfrom os import system\n\n# Optional: set the coordinates of the monitors here, I have a 1680x1050 monitor centered on top of a 1920x1080 monitor:\nsystem('xrandr --output DP-1 --pos 120x0 --auto --output eDP-1 --pos 0x1050')\n\nfps=50.0\ndelay=1.0/fps\nd=display.Display()\n\nwhile True:\n  sleep(delay)\n  data = d.screen().root.query_pointer()._data\n  x = data[\"root_x\"]\n  y = data[\"root_y\"]\n  # Change conditions and coordinates here, I teleport the two segments on the top left and top right of my 1920x1080 screen to the bottom left and bottom right corners of the 1680x1050 screen:\n  if y == 1050 and (x < 120 or x >= 1800):\n    if x < 120:\n      d.screen().root.warp_pointer(120,1049)\n    else:\n      d.screen().root.warp_pointer(1799,1049)\n\n", "Q: ambiguous package name 'libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0' with more than one installed I tried to update my system Ubuntu 12.04 64bit on amd PhenomIIx4-955BE.

Suddenly, there are two weeks, it restart the session without apparent reason. It occurs without any warning and I lose my job. It worked perfectly until 2 weeks ago. Please, help me!\n\nA: Just a hunch you could have upgraded to an Nvidia driver which has been known to crash X.org in 11.10 and 12.04. The symptoms sound similar: suddenly you find yourself back at the Lightdm login screen. Typically, this happens when web browsing, often with Flash in the page (but sometimes not). No warning. Just a dropped session. Seems random. Let's first verify that you have the problem. \nCheck to see if you have the Nvidia driver. Launch nvidia-settings and look for the Nvidia driver version. The problems are with the default version installed (295.40) and later. If that's the version shown, you should verify you're getting the same X.org crash. \nNext time your system crashes (or if you know when it last crashed), you can check your syslog for the error. Use  System Tools > Log File Viewer in the menu, then click on syslog. Scroll until you're around the time of the crash and look for a line that contains: \"Gdk-WARNING: gnome-session: Fatal IO error 11 (Resource temporarily unavailable) on X server\" If you have the Nvidia driver and see that error, you know you have run into the Nvidia driver bug. \nHere's how to downgrade to the previous Nvidia driver version that works. \nFind the 290.10 version in Launchpad. I found the AMD 64 version here: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/amd64/nvidia-current/290.10-0ubuntu2. The download link is on the right side. Download it to your home folder. \nNow deactivate the old driver by opening a terminal and type \"jockey-gtk\". Select the driver that's got the green dot next to it and select the \"Remove\" button. Close it when it's done. \nNow we're going to install the new driver. Type the command \"sudo dpkg -i nvidia-current_290.10-0ubuntu2_precise_amd64.deb\" to install that version. It will ask you for your password. It will take a while as it runs a kernel module version sanity check, but it will finish. \nYou'll want to force and lock that version so it doesn't get upgraded by accident. There's probably a quick way to do this command-line, but I use synaptic to make it easy. Install synaptic (run: sudo apt-get install synaptic) and launch it with \"sudo synaptic\". Search for the package we just installed. It will just be named nvidia-current. You should select Package > Force Version, and choose 290.10, and hit \"Force\". Now lock it in place by choosing Package > Lock Version from Synaptic's menu. The line in Synaptic will turn red, but have a green square with a lock icon on the right. \nNow it's time to activate it by re=launching jockey-gtk from the command line. Select \"version-current\" and choose \"Activate\". You'll get the green dot next to it again. Close jockey-gtk. \nReboot. Let's make sure everything's in place. Go to nvidia-settings again and check the driver version to make sure you are running 295.10. You may have to reinstall nvidia-settings (sudo apt-get install nvidia-settings). If the version number says 290.10, you should experience no more sudden session losses. \n", "Q: Where can I download the ISO torrents for Ubuntu?

When ls executes, there are no files in the directory yet, right?\n\nA: The > command line directive happens before the ls command is executed.

Every time I try to open Ubuntu's (any version, since from 8.04 with which I started) default wallpaper, named warty-final-ubuntu.png, I get an error:\n\nI reported this as a bug more than a year ago but it is still unresolved. Also I don't get why the default wallpaper is still named as warty-final-ubuntu.png instead of having actual code name prefix to which the wallpaper belongs eg. precise-final-ubuntu.png and so on.\n\nA: You're right that this is a bug. Rinzwind's answer explains what is going wrong--eog assumes the file is a PNG because its suffix is .png. That behavior is itself a bug, since sometimes images have the wrong suffix. Most other image viewers will look inside a file to determine its file type (at least if the initial attempt to open it based on its file extension fails).\nI've verified this behavior and marked your Launchpad bug a duplicate of bug 172416, which is the bug for eog's failure to autodetect image type.\nIf you need to open an image that has the wrong suffix in eog, you can rename it or, if it's needed with its current name, you can make a symbolic link to it (as Rinzwind explains already exists for the background wallpaper you're trying to open).\nTo see how to make a symbolic link, see man ln. Use the -s flag to make symbolic (instead of hard) links.\nFor example, if you have a Pictures folder inside your home folder, and it contains a file called foo.png which is actually a JPEG, you can make a symbolic link to it named like a JPEG with:\ncd ~/Pictures\nln -s foo.png foo.jpg\n\nOne key thing to remember when making symbolic links from the command line is that you specify the target first, and the source second.

Often a proprietary piece of software (aka firmware blob) needs to be loaded by the WiFi driver. If your distribution doesn't have it, maybe another has.

In fact they can hear everything, even the fans turning on.\nThere is nothing tweaked on Ubuntu's fresh installation. Also tried this site:\nhttps://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-audio-dev/+archive/alsa-daily/+packages ,\nbut there are no *.deb files that I can test if any fix the problem.\nThe question is if there is a way to add/tweak something to enable on software level the noise cancellation like the Windows sound drivers have that option.\nI use my build in mic.\n\nA: Apart from changing into a narrow scope mic, there is nothing much you can do, this factor depends on the design of the microphone and not Skype.\n\nA: I had the same problem ;)\nWent to options -> sound devices -> open pulse audio volume control -> input devices \nAnd then reduced the bars in order to be closer to Base. \nHope it helps\n\nA: Your mic is going to forward what it detects.

Did you use Wubi, since wubi only give Windows bootloader. But if you installed logging from USB, GRUB will be your bootloader. And you should not format the whole disk. That might have got the issue. \nTheir might be many reasons for this issue. Recently Windows are coming up with UEFI which blocks other OS and some apps to be installed which aren't licensed.

I was surprised to find that the discard option still isn't added automatically to my fstab, even though I have an SSD. Thus I have to follow these instructions to add it.\nWhy doesn't the installer do this automatically? Is there some hidden drawback to using discard? Are there issues reliably detecting SSDs?\n\nA: My answer here mentions the why, but for the specific reasons to not enable it by default, comes down to several important factors that affect different hardware, hardware configurations and software configurations but they basically boil down to:\n\n\n*\n\n*What file system to use? (Not all filesystems support TRIM. In fact, only a small group of filesystems support TRIM including ext4 and btrfs)\n\n*What SSD to use? (Some are not good with TRIM. Some don't need TRIM)\n\n*Will RAID be used? (There are several RAID issues when using TRIM)\n\n*What performance impact will it have? (Negative, Positive. This varies depending on SSD, hardware, RAID configuration...)\nSo I guess with all of this doubts, the option for one to test it out ourselves is left with the manual approach and to see if there is an actual benefit. I can say that the benefit in an Intel 520 with and without Trim is very little, at least in my case. But still, with all of this performance issues, enabling automatic TRIM even will all of the hype about it would still be a bad idea because for some users it will be good, but for others it could be very bad.\n\nA: I came across information that says it is VERY IMPORTANT TO DISABLE DISCARD MOUNT OPTION on SSD's (-o nodiscard) under Linux.  Here's the quote and link:\nLink:\nhttps://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/ssdc/data-center-ssds/Intel_Linux_NVMe_Guide_330602-002.pdf\nQuote from page 6:\n\n\"Filesystem Recommendations\nIMPORTANT: Do not discard blocks in filesystem usage.\nBe sure to turn off the discard option when making your Linux\n  filesystem. You want to allow the SSD manage blocks and its activity\n  between the NVM (non-volatile memory) and host with more advanced and\n  consistent approaches in the SSD Controller.\nCore Filesystems:\n• ext4 – the default extended option is not to discard blocks at\n  filesystem make time, retain this, and do not add the “discard”\n  extended option as some information will tell you to do.\n• xfs – with mkfs.xfs, add the –K option so that you do not discard\n  blocks.\nIf you are going to use a software RAID, it is recommended to use a\n  chunk size of 128k as starting point, depending on the workload you\n  are going to run. You must always test your workload.\"\n\nAs you can see, the manufacturer itself, Intel, makes the point SO STRONGLY that they repeat it FIVE times in the text, FOUR explicitly and one through logic that professionals understand.

That allows you to keep your Windows XP installation, but also run a Ubuntu Linux installation of wubi.\nAlso, WHY, I run wubi in Windows XP, is that it gives me a good alternative to that gawd awful Windows 8, which I will NEVER upgrade to. I do have Windows 7 Basic Home Edition, but THAT is it, for ANY Windows OS for me.\nBUT, do give wubi a try, and you can also run wubi from a DVD as well, IF you want to just try it out first, before you install it.\nNeill \n\nA: Yes I have my desktop too which got only 40 GB hard disk and I had C D E, with C In windows, And E for Ubuntu which got 15 GB Drive. \nYou too can do as well.

Where can one find them?\n\nA: The literal answer is that Ubuntu doesn't list its torrents as magnet links.\nHowever they do offer something very close: http://torrent.ubuntu.com:6969/ lists all of their torrent's info hashes, which is the main piece of information a magnet link contains. If you paste one into Transmission's \"Add URL\" entry, Transmission will add it and start looking for peers via DHT, just as it would a magnet link.\n\nA: Canonical makes the .torrent file for the various ISO install images available for download. You can download the .torrent file for an install image, as well as various other download meta-files and the actual ISO images files, on the Ubuntu Releases page organized by release. \nFor example, here is the link for the page of the most frequently downloaded files for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. The first line of a \"most frequently downloaded\" page for a release also contains a link to the list of download mirrors and a link to a page where you can download other images, including DVDs and source CDs.\nI personally have not seen a magnet link for an Ubuntu ISO image torrent on a Canonical site. I think they don't bother with them since it is debatable whether doing so would result in a meaningful (i.e. noticeable) performance improvement.\nThe .torrent files for the Ubuntu ISOs tend to be quite small. Typical .torrent files sizes appear to be well under 40 KB for a CD ISO and under 100 KB for a DVD ISO. This is roughly the size of a small to medium sized image file. It is highly unlikely that the Canonical servers will be overtaxed by downloads of these files.\nA more likely problem is that the servers hosting the web pages containing the download links for the .torrent files will be hard to access on high volume days. I don't see how adding magnet links could help with that. One would still have to access the (overtaxed) Canonical server hosting the web page which contained the magnet link to use the magnet link. \n", "Q: How to upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04 without internet without internet connection? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I upgrade from 10.04 or 11.10 to 12.04? \n\nI want to upgrade from ubuntu 11.10 to ubuntu 12.04.

I am setting up a headless music server based on the minimal Ubuntu image. After having installed the packages\nopenssh-server,pulseaudio,\nlibmad0,flac,libogg0,libid3tag0,libvorbis0a,ffmpeg,\nmpd,mpc,mpdscribble,\npaman,paprefs,pavumeter\n\nneither my internal soundcard nor the external DAC where detected by pulseaudio, that is pactl list did only list the dummy devices. Several reboots did not change that. The hardware devices are detected properly:\n~$ lsusb | grep Texas\nBus 002 Device 002: ID 08bb:2706 Texas Instruments Japan \n\n~$ lspci | grep Audio\n00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation N10/ICH 7 Family High Definition Audio Controller (rev 02)\n\nFollowing a hunch, I installed vlc with all dependencies.

The question is: which of the many dependencies of VLC enables proper device detection?\nAnd why on earth is it not a dependency of pulseaudio?\n\nA: Most of the libs at http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/vlc are X libs or other junk unrelated to sound.\nOf that list, the vlc-nox dependency is likely to be what fixed it for you.  You could probably try just installing that.\nHowever, vlc-nox also has a hefty number of dependencies:\n  http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/vlc-nox\nBut filtering out the video and codec packages should leave you with a shorter list to look at.  I'd probably start with ones that explicitly mention alsa or audio.\n\nA: I had a look at all the dependencies form VLC, at first it seems that none one the main ones are directly connected to the detection of sound cards but when you open the dependencies for vlc-plugin-pulse you can see one important one: libpulse0.\nI had system that would not be able to or could not detect the sound card correctly without that package installed. I would bet some money on it that that is the reason everything started working correctly.\nCan you test this and report?\n\nA: You could try installing libvlc.

I'm creating an application that uses symbolic icons from the default theme.\nHowever, there are a few icons that I need that cannot be represented by those from the default theme, so I'm creating my own ones.\nWhat I did was to simply go to /usr/share/icons/gnome/scalable/actions/, copied a few locally into my app's source tree that could serve as a basis, and started editing them.\nSo far so good. But I've noticed the following: all symbolic icons are of a light grey color when looking at the original .svg file, but when they are put onto a widget, they become darker.\nHere's an example, using the /usr/share/icons/gnome/scalable/actions/view-refresh-symbolic.svg icon from the default theme:\n\n\n*\n\n*Here's what it looks like when opening the original with Inkscape:\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*And here's what it looks like on a toolbar on a running application:\n\n\n\nNotice the icon being much darker at runtime. That happens both with the Ambiance and Radiance themes.\nI wouldn't mind much, but I noticed it affects my custom icon, whereby parts of it become darker (the inner fill), whereas parts of it remain the same color as the original (the stroke).\nSo what causes the default symbolic icons to darken and how should implement that for my custom icons?\n\nA: Symbolic icons are usually set by the theme using the \"color\" property, that's their great advantage, they look good on any background. You can however load them with your own color.\nExample vala code:\n//get the icon theme and lookup the icon we want by name, here at a size of 64px\nvar info = Gtk.IconTheme.get_default ().lookup_icon (\"view-refresh-symbolic\", 64, 0);\n\n//now load the icon as a symbolic with a color set in the brackets as RGBA, here as plain red\nvar pixbuf = info.load_symbolic ({1, 0, 0, 1});\n\n//finally we just put in a GtkImage to render it\nvar image_widget = new Gtk.Image.from_pixbuf (pixbuf);\n\n\nA: *\n\n*The symbolic icons are created in a chroma-keyed color, gray with full opacity (#bebebeff). They can then be colored based on the fg_color value defined by the theme in settings.ini (GTK3) or gtkrc (GTK2); or on the fg_color defined in the CSS (GTK3).\n\n\n*\n\n*e.g., for Ambiance the foreground color (fg_color) is set to dark gray (#4c4c4c) in /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0/settings.ini, which is why the symbolic icons appear darker.\n\n\n*To make custom symbolic icons look the same, you must remove the stroke and use only fill with the RGBA value set to #bebebeff; otherwise, the stroke will always appear as set (i.e., gray or whatever color).\n\n\n*\n\n*In Inkscape, just select the object, open Fill and Stroke, and click on the No Paint (x) icon under \"Stroke Paint\":\n\n\n\n\n*This gives us a nice and even-looking \"MyRefresh\" symbolic icon:\n\n\n\nOne user indicated that a different, darker icon was being opened instead of the default gnome symbolic icon; as this strace shows, that assertion is incorrect:  \n\n\n", "Q: How to set the default video player?

You can just use the \"connect to server\" button in files (nautilus). In the popup window you need to type an sftp string like this:\nsftp://username@hostname.local/\n\nwhere username is the username of the other machine, and hostname is the hostname of the other machine. Then you'll be prompted for a password and you're good to go.\nNote that you have to sudo apt install openssh-server on the remote machine.\n\nA: Rsync is probably your best bet. It is an incremental file transmission protocol that allows you to keep folders in sync between machines, so it would be especially good for things like media.\n\nA: Probably easier than that. If in the same local network, just right click on the folder you want to share and click sharing options. Then you get a menu which is self explanatory.

I wish to try MaaS, and there's only two machine, could I install one with MaaS service, and use MaaS and juju to deploy the other bare machine with openstack nova-compute?\nThank you so much for answering.\n\nA: The reason for this is that OpenStack is not really meant for a 2 node cluster. It is meant to scale to thousands of nodes. It has many disconnected components, including mysql, rabbitmq, several API services, etc. For your case of \"just trying openstack out\" you can simply use the local provider to install everything on one box rather than MaaS which wants to put every component of OpenStack on its own machine (and there are about 9 components, plus 1 for juju/maas).\nHave a look at this page to help configure the local provider:\nhttps://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/clouds-LXD\nAnd then follow these instructions:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuCloudInfrastructure\nExcept instead of setting up MaaS, and generating/downloading the environments.yaml from MaaS, you just put this in:\ndefault: local\nenvironments:\n  local:\n    type: local\n    default-series: precise\n    data-dir: /home/youruser/.juju/data\n\nAll of the services will end up in their own containers on the same box, which will have some limitations (like nova volumes not working right).\n\nA: \nBeside that can you please explain what exactly MAAS gonna install on each server?\n\nYou can use community contributed charms where each service like MySQL or RabbitMQ requires dedicated node or write yours where you can combine them.\n\nDoes it has some RAID kind of mechanism inside?\n\nYou can utilize RAID when deploying node into MaaS. \n\nIf one or two servers go down and it may handle everything?\n\nMaaS doesn't provide built in reservation or High Availability for deployed services. If you are talking about OpenStack, the answer is yes: nova-compute can relaunch instances from failed nodes. Best practices for Swift requires 3 copy of your data, so 2 failed nodes is not a problem.\n\nMy final question is it says somewhere on Ubuntu docs that each server should\n  have at-least 16GB RAM ? Is it Must or optional ?\n\nNo, this is not required. Probably, you've mentioned this statement from Mark's blog: \"Add another node to the Hadoop cluster, and make sure it has at least 16GB RAM”.\n", "Q: how to solve error processing /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pygst.pth:?

When I go to System Preferences --> Monitor and I turn that on it doesn't look as it should, and it's rotated 90 degrees clockwise or anti-clockwise. I can't choose Normal on the rotation dropdown menù in the monitor preferences.\nI wonder if there is a workaround to make it look normal.\n\nA: I had this problem just now. It seems that Ubuntu has a limit to how wide the virtual screen can be, so it rotates the second one if that will make it fit under the limit. Try positioning the second screen below the first in the display settings.\n\nA: Ok, just solved it. I typed in the terminal:\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1280x1024 --rotate normal\n\nIf you have the same kind of problem, you have to change \"VGA1\" with the right output (just type xrandr in the terminal to have a list of your your video outputs) and \"1280x1024\" with the resolution you want. \n\nA: After a fresh install, on my system the laptop screen was rotated 90 degrees.  To solve it, I logged off, and selected Ubuntu 2D.  I was confused at first because I had been running two screens previously, and had no problems.  I remember originally when I connected the monitor to the VGA port, it complained thaT I didn't have enough video memory to run the resolution configuration that I asked for.  It told me to switch to Ubuntu 2D.  On the fresh install, I had the monitor hooked up to the VGA port -- and it didn't complain this time except rotate laptop screen 90 degrees which was confusing.\n\nA: I found a workaround to this problem after researching and experimenting on it for a couple hours. I have a Acer 22\" monitor and an HP Pavilion dv2000 laptop. Here are the steps that resolved the issue for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*I went into the Menu for the monitor itself (buttons along the bottom of the display) and found the \"Wide-Mode\" setting and turned it off. At this point the display was still sideways, but in a narrow view that doesn't use the full width of the screen. The display is now centered in the monitor with two black bars on the sides of the screen.\n\n*I went into the Ubuntu display properties and selected Mirror Displays. This displayed the same content at the same resolution on both monitors (my primary display being my laptop screen) and set the second monitor display in a normal upright position. This had the same effect on the laptop monitor as on the secondary, in that the display does not take up the full width of the screen.\n\n*I then deselected Mirror Displays. This turned off the display mirroring but left both displays in the correct orientation with the same resolution. Now neither display covers the full area of the screen, but at least they do both work! Changing the resolution on either monitor results in an error message, but this workaround will serve the purpose for now.\n\nA: I managed to work-around this problem from \"Displays\" (GUI), without having to resort to xrandr, by the following sequence:\n\n\n*\n\n*mirror (& apply)\n\n*turn off laptop's monitor in docking station, whilst leaving (current and low) resolution unchanged (& apply)\n\n*finally, ramp up resolution on external monitor to max. (& apply)\n\n\nNote, though, that this is exactly what I was after:\n\n\n*\n\n*laptop-monitor off\n\n*external monitor on\nwhich might not be what you're after (but in which case xrandr might do the trick)...\n\nA: I had the same problems. At first my second monitor looked good with a resolution of 1440x900, but after I changed my settings, it kept turning the screen and the normal mode was no longer available.\nxrandr --output VGA1 --auto --rotate normal\nDoes solve the problem temporarily, but I have to redo this after login etc.\nI moved back from Unity 3D to Metacity 2D, see:\nIs it possible to change Unity 3D to 2D and will I gain any performance boost after that?\nNow the problem is solved, I can select the right resolution as well as the normal orientation. There is a bug in Unity 3D, because it complains about the resolution not fitting the 2K frame, 1440 is not over 2K!\n", "Q: Why isn't this simple CRON job working?

SHM, tmpfs and zram are all slightly different implementations which lead to the same output - storage of data in RAM instead of a secondary storage device. As far as I know, the differences lie in how they react when RAM starts filling up.\nSince you're asking this question you've probably heard of swap - when memory reaches near-full capacity, the OS starts moving data between RAM and a dedicated partition. From what I remember, and this might be wrong, but tmpfs will only be swapped when absolutely necessary, and will always try to remain in RAM. /dev/shm can be swapped as readily as any other data in RAM, and I don't know about zram but I suspect it's the same.\n", "Q: I have Ubuntu 11.10 and for no apparent reason my sidebar suddenly will not hide, how can I reverse this?

The auto-hide was buggy that is why it was dropped in 12.04. The auto-hide sometimes got stuck If you have logged out and back in or rebooted your computer and it still doesn't work, you may have to download \"My Unity\"       Instructions found here \nI never had any problem in 11.10 getting the launcher to reset by logging out and back in or rebooting but, if for some reason your dconf setting got corrupted, you should be able to fix it using My Unity. Just select the behavior drop-down on the launcher tab.  \nThere are other programs out there to adjust the dconf settings but My Unity is probably the safest and easiest to use.\n", "Q: Netbeans shows only blank window I am not able to launch Netbeans.

I have only installation files of Windows 7. What should I do?\n\nA: First, use gparted to make space for the Windows 7 partition.\nAfter that, you can simply use an ISO with your Windows product key; Microsoft actually makes the ISOs available for download online via Digital River CDN links.\nOr, if you don't want to download the ISO, the installation files option will probably have a means of installing to just the empty space, rather than erasing the whole drive (however, I have never used this installation method myself).\nAfter that, you'll want to boot onto an Ubuntu LiveCD so that you can repair your GRUB installation.\n\nA: I doubt you can do that by Windows 7 installation files which are let free in a drive. And you have to check with Windows forum for the files you got to get a DVD out of it. But if you got ISO of the windows7, than you can make it a DVD,than by making Partition in UBuntu drive using Gparted, than can install it I believe. Since as far I know, if from Windows installation files, it won't integrative together to form the bootable disk\n", "Q: Is there any way to add the toolbar at the bottom of the new Firefox start page to the Ubuntu start page?

It will only work if you are a KDE user. However in that case it will require no additional piece of software. It will have the exact same behavior as when using the \"battery and brightness\" widget. AFAIK it changes the physical backlight, in contrast with xrandr which does does not.\nBeware that the 55 above is not a fraction of 100, the latter being the max brightness.\nInstead it is related to max_brightness:\nqdbus org.kde.Solid.PowerManagement /org/kde/Solid/PowerManagement/Actions/BrightnessControl brightnessMax\n\nThere is also a \"silent\" version that you might prefer in a script:\nqdbus org.kde.Solid.PowerManagement /org/kde/Solid/PowerManagement/Actions/BrightnessControl setBrightnessSilent 2000\n\nRefs: qdbus, solid, brightness\n\nA: As @palacsint said, echo 244 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness path works for me.\nBut max and min values are resent in /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/max_brightness and /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/bl_power files respectively.\nAlso, the actual brightness that your computer is running now is present in /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/actual_brightness\n\nA: ddccontrol is another option for controlling backlighting for external monitors. Here I can set the backlight of my external monitor to 50% of its power with:\nddccontrol -p -r 0x10 -w 50\n\nI looked in possible solutions for this problem to improve the way Redshift handles brightness changes. Through there I found that there is a patchset for the Linux kernel to improve compatibility across devices, so that laptops and external screens could work similarly, through sysfs.\nIn the meantime, ddccontrol is the only thing that works for me here. As usual, the Arch wiki has good overall documentation on the topic as well.\n\nA: To set absolute brightness (for laptop users):\nBRIGHTNESS=50 # 0 to 100\n\ndbus-send \\\n--session \\\n--type=method_call \\\n--dest=\"org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Power\" \\\n/org/gnome/SettingsDaemon/Power \\\norg.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Set \\\nstring:\"org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Power.Screen\" \\\nstring:\"Brightness\" \\\nvariant:int32:$BRIGHTNESS\n\n\nA: Using D-Bus with GNOME\nYou can increase/decrease brightness with gdbus:\n# Step up:\ngdbus call --session --dest org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Power --object-path /org/gnome/SettingsDaemon/Power --method org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Power.Screen.StepUp\n\n# Step down:\ngdbus call --session --dest org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Power --object-path /org/gnome/SettingsDaemon/Power --method org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Power.Screen.StepDown\n\nNotes\n\n*\n\n*No root privileges needed!

So if right now that partition is itself /tmp, you'll need to move its entire contents to a tmp directory in its root.\n\n\n*Give the partition that contains tmp and home its own mount point. A reasonable name for this is tmp+home (unless you plan to use that partition for other stuff too) and reasonable locations for it are /, /mnt, and /media. I recommend putting it directly in / and the rest of this answer assumes that's where it is.\n\n\n*Give /tmp+home its own entry in /etc/fstab. (You will see /tmp has its own entry.)\n\n\n*Make /tmp and /home symbolic links to /tmp+home/tmp and /tmp+home/home.\nPlease note that this will not involve using these instructions for creating a separate /home partition, because in this configuration, /home will be a symbolic link into a separate partition, rather than a mount point for a separate partition.\nFurthermore, you'll have to unconfigure your separate /tmp directory (including removing or, better, commenting out its entry in /etc/fstab), since /tmp will no longer be a mount point for a separate partition, but will instead be a symbolic link into a separate partition.\nThis answer doesn't provide extremely specific instructions (though it should be sufficient, combined with the available documentation). If someone who has experience moving /tmp can weigh in on whether or not it's possible/safe to move /tmp while in the installed system, that would be helpful. I can give detailed instructions for doing this from the installed system or from a live CD, but I don't want to give directions that are ineffective or unsafe (nor directions that are unnecessarily difficult and time-consuming).\n\nA: The easy way would be to make another / partition with an install disk then reboot, and mount that partition temporarily in /media or whatever then copy the /home and /tmp folders in the new / root partition you mounted under media. Unmount it and reboot.\n\nA: Note - Follow instructions at your own peril! I'm confident they will work, but I don't want to be responsible for losing all your stuff\nAs someone who has /home on a dedicated partition (but not hard drive) I can say its possible, although it's much easier to do with the ubuntu installer when you first install ubuntu.\nHowever, if you need to do this without reinstalling ubuntu I would say it's best to put a small linux OS or livecd (I recommend Puppy Linux due to its small size) onto a USB stick or CD and use that to adjust your Hard Disk setup and /etc/fstab file, which contains the list of which partitions and Hard Drives hold which folders. I'll continue assuming you use puppy linux to do this, but the steps are easy to follow if you use - for example - an ubuntu livecd.\nOnce puppy linux is installed (use unetbootin to do this if you are using a USB stick) first need to use Gparted (the graphical partition editor included with puppy linux) to ensure the new hard drive is formatted correctly. It isn't crucial, but it is helpful to use the same filesystem across the two hard drives. I would also suggest you create a partition for /tmp and a partition for /home. The reasoning for this will become clear.\nOnce you have these partitions created you need to mount the HDD containing the Ubuntu installation, and copy the contents of the home folder to the partition you have created for it. There shouldn't be anything in /tmp.\nNext, open the file etc/fstab for text editing.\nNote - ensure you open the file within the ubuntu drive, otherwise you'll be editing the mount details for the livecd/puppy linux\nThe layout of the fstab file is like this:\nUUID=unique-partition-id[TAB-HERE]/home[TAB-HERE]ext4[TAB-HERE]defaults[TAB-HERE]0[TAB-HERE]2\n(The tabs weren't rendered so I put where they go in square brackets. They aren't strictly necessary but they make the file a hell of a lot easier to read)\nappend this line twice, once for the home directory, and once for tmp. Ensure that the ext4 line is changed to match the filesystem used by the partition, and that the unique-partition-id field is changed to match the UUID of the partition. that value  can be found in gparted (or the ubuntu disk management utility on a livecd).\nDelete the contents of the original home directory - ensuring all files copied across - then save the changes to etc/fstab and restart.\n", "Q: How to install and use NIMBUZZ!

I use ubuntu one on windows and ubuntu. \nThe last days I've had multiple times that ubuntu one decided to delete all my files. Fortunately I had just backed up my files and made a local copy of the deleted files. Still, I have no confidence anymore that ubuntu one will safely store my files without suddenly deleting them. So I wondered if there is an option to prevent ubuntu one deleting any files, always keeping a copy of the file in the cloud, even when I delete the file on my computer. \n\nA: if you sync a folder to ubuntu one in your computers then it will be synced in all your computers that have the sync locally option clicked. Example:\n- say you create a folder with files in your ubuntu computer.\n- Then you sync it with ubuntu one. The content of the folder gets uploaded to the server.\n- Now you go to your windows computer and decide to sync that new folder there...then the content of the folder gets downloaded to the windows computer, but STILL REMAINS IN UBUNTU ONE.\n- Now if you delete some files in the windows computer from that folder, that will propagate to ubuntu one and to your ubuntu computer, therefore the files will be deleted.\nTo stop that behavior you have to unclick the sync locally option from your ubuntu one menu in the computer you delete the files.\nbeen using ubuntu one for a while now, keep my backups there and never had such a thing as files deleted by ubuntu one itself.\nhope that helps\n\nA: The bug in my experience is that I do a 'copy to' command of files or a directory from Ubuntu One and it treats the command like a 'move to', and removes the files from Ubuntu One. Nice work Ubuntu One! All the other files on Ubuntu One are stable, so this bug is isolated to a 'copy' as 'move' problem.\n", "Q: can't open youtube or vimeo \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I fix Flash issues? \n\nI can't open Youtube.com on computer with lubuntu and mint.

I use Deja Dup as my back up tool.

Some threads suggest to use the Ubuntu One folder in your system, and that works, but it also keeps a local copy of the back up in my system, and I do not want that.\nAny work around for this?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: I don't believe that it's currently possible to configure Back In Time to save the backups anywhere other than a folder on the filesystem (Deja Dup is able to back up to other places, as you know, such as Ubuntu One). \n(warning: super techie stuff ahead)\nIt might be possible to back up to Ubuntu One with Back In Time by mounting your Ubuntu One storage as a folder -- doing this would require someone writing something like a fuse filesystem or mountable server using the Ubuntu One files APIs, which as far as I'm aware no-one's done, and I personally would be very worried about trusting my backups to such a setup -- what happens if your broadband dies halfway through a backup taking place? Without some cooperation from the backup tool itself (B.I.T. in this case) you'd need to be very careful. If the Back In Time development team are interested in making Ubuntu One a backup target then I (as head of U1's app developer programme) am more than happy to chat to them about how they might go about it!

Delete the folder as shown in the browser.

If you want all the space in both drives to correspond to a single partition, LVM is the way to go. You can make an LVM volume group containing both drives, and create a single partition on that.\nSince you would want to install Ubuntu on an LVM rather than add an LVM to an already-installed Ubuntu system, you can use the Ubuntu installer to create the LVM, then install Ubuntu on it. The GRUB2 boot loader is fully capable of booting directly into an LVM, so you don't even need a separate /boot partition (as was the old way).\nThe regular Ubuntu desktop CD (i.e., the live CD) does not have the ability to install Ubuntu on an LVM. Instead, you must use the alternate CD for this. See the \"Text-based installation\" section on this page. Or, for your convenience:\n\n\n*\n\n*This is the 32-bit alternate install CD for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\n\n*This is the 64-bit alternate install CD for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nWrite this .iso image to a USB flash drive, or burn it to a CD/DVD, the same way you would with the live CD.\nThe official Ubuntu 12.04 LTS installation guide for the alternate CD may help you during the installation process. (Or skip to the 32-bit installation guide or 64-bit installation guide.)\nThat guide is not very specific about LVM so I'll try to edit this post again to provide detailed instructions, based on your specific needs (an Ubuntu system installed in a single / partition on an LVM consisting of two drives of unequal storage capacity).\n\nA: By using RAID.  As Eliah Kagan explained in his answer, But keep this in mind:\nIdeally you should use two identical hard drives for Raid 1 mirroring.  The reason is that both drives will be doing the exact same thing at the exact same time.  When you write to one, you’re writing to the other, creating a mirror image of the first.  That means both drives will be under the same stress.\nKeep in mind too that Raid 1 mirroring will slow your computer because it has to write everything twice.  That’s why I recommend the external storage.  Put one hard drive in your PC, back it up, and save your data externally.\nBack in the days of parallel ATA, it was a no-no to mix drives from different vendors on a RAID controller. Sometimes it would work--more often it wouldn't. With the advent of SATA, mixing vendors is no longer as problematic.\nAlso, though there are controllers that allow mixing and matching capacities without losing storage space (using advanced parity techniques), these are still relatively rare. Using drives of different sizes usually results in total storage capacity that's only a multiple of the smallest drive. For example, combining 500GB and 320GB drives in RAID 1 would be 320GB * 2, or 640GB instead of 820GB.\nIn practice, you'll save yourself a lot of time and sidestep possible issues by building your array with identical hard drives--meaning drives of the same make, model, and size. You need at least two drives for RAID 0 and 1, three drives for RAID 5, and four for RAID 0+1, 1+0, and 10.\nHope that this helps in making your decision.\nSource: pcworld\n", "Q: Need help with creating a form with KBasic I have installed KBasic on my Ubuntu to create a simple form(as of now) which will have a database backend.\nThe problem is ,as per the KBasic help,i have to click on any component i want for eg button n then click on the form where i want to add it...fairly simple...like VB...But,its not happening!

It should use online/inline/synchronous deduplication at the block-level using secure hashing (for negligible chance of collisions) such as SHA256 or TTH. Duplicate blocks need not even touch the disk.\nThe idea is that I should be able to just copy /home/<user> to an external HDD with the same such filesystem to do a backup. Simple. No messing around with incremental backups where corruption to any of the snapshots will nearly always break all later snapshots, and no need to use a specific tool to delete or 'checkout' a snapshot. Everything should simply be done from the file browser without worry. Can you imagine how easy this would be? I'd never have to think twice about backing-up again!\nI don't mind a performance hit, reliability is the main concern. Although, with specific implementations of cp, mv and scp, and a file browser plugin, these operations would be very fast, especially when there is a lot of duplication as they would only need to transfer the absent blocks. Accidentally using conventional copy tools that do not integrate with the FS would merely take longer, waste some bandwidth when copying remotely and waste some CPU, as the duplicate data would be re-read, re-transferred and re-hashed (although nothing would be re-written), but would absolutely not corrupt anything. (Some filesharing software may also be able to benefit by integrating with the FS.)\nSo what's the best way of doing this?\nI've looked at some options:\n\n\n*\n\n*lessfs - Looks unmaintained. Any good?\n\n*Opendedup/SDFS - Java? Could I use this on Android?! What does SDFS stand for?\n\n*Btrfs - Some patches floating around on mailing list archives, but no real support.\n\n*ZFS - Hopefully they'll one day relicense under a true Free/Opensource GPL-compatible licence.\n\n\nAlso, 2 years ago I had a go at an attempt in Python using Fuse at the file-level to be used over the top of a typical solid FS such as EXT4, but I found Fuse for Python underdocumented and didn't manage to implement all of the system calls.\n\nA: This sounds very enterprise (as in pricey).\ndatadomain offers data de-duplication, and maybe netapp with their wafl filesystem. But at a high cost.\nA \"free\" alternative could be zfs.\nAccording to me though the \"best\" and most Linuxy alternative, although on a file level instead of \"block level\", would be rsnapshot. It uses rsync and hardlinks to manage versioning.\nI rather trust old proven tools than using a new filesystems like Btrfs which hasn't been around long enough for people to discover all kinds of nasty bugs.\n\nA: I'm looking and investigating exactly the same, I could sugget https://attic-backup.org/quickstart.html#automating-backups for now, seems to be quiet simple and good for backups of linux. \nThere is also bacula with this feature, but attic seems to be good enough for most cases. \n", "Q: How do I find a proprietary driver for the Intel graphics card I have?

Once I returned the main interface to bridge mode the error changed to the standard BADSIG one which was fixed by grabbing the key again from keyserv and running the apt-get clean stuff. \n\nA: This solution worked perfectly in my case:\nChange the config file that apt uses to look for the update url\nsudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup -- to keep a backup of the conf\nsudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list\nin the editor just find and replace all the http:// to ftp://\nor\ndelete everything and replace it with mirror.\ndeb ftp-mirror name YOUR_UBUNTU_VERSION_HERE main \ndeb-src ftp-mirror name YOUR_UBUNTU_VERSION_HERE main \n\n(can get other mirrors from here)\nI did this because for some reason running in virtual machine http:// was not working with apt. Try this out hope this will work\n\nA: I had a similar issue with 12.04 running as Parallels VM, apt-get update gave med BADSIG for us.achive.ubuntu.com. I switched to a different mirror (see links in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/CommandLine) in /etc/apt/sources.list and now update works again.\n", "Q: Is it possible to get a patch included in the current release? If so, how? So a while back I reported a bug in Compiz's Place Window plugin. It's a fairly major regression for people affected by it: mainly  those using Gnome-Fallback, judging by the reports.\nA patch surfaced a short time later. I created a PPA for testing and everybody involved  so far is reporting the issues are fixed. It even fixes another bug. I've done testing with a standard Unity desktop and can say (for my testing) no adverse effects were visible.\nI want to get this pushed to Ubuntu right now for two main reasons:\n\n*\n\n*I'm selfish. I don't want to need to update my PPA every time a new version of Compiz is pushed to 12.04.\n\n*I don't want Ubuntu users seeing their windows flying around because of a silly little bug.\n\nI want this patch pushed to Ubuntu's version of Compiz as soon as possible, so we can mark these bugs fixed and move on with our lives.\nWhose leg do I have to hump to get this pulled into Ubuntu right now?\nI don't maintain this project and it's an upstream thing but it's fairly integral to Ubuntu. I could go to Compiz but I imagine that if they accept the patch, it'll be months (at least a release) before it's anywhere near Ubuntu.\nAnd when I do find the right person, how can I make the process as slick as possible for them?\nI want them to see my request, go \"Yup, that all looks great, done\" and that be it. I don't want seventeen rounds of emails addressing aspects of the patch. More importantly, I don't want to waste their time either.\nAnd what do I have to provide them? My packaging skills are... lamentable. This was my first attempt at patching a package for redistribution so I've probably made every single packaging error known to man. Will they be happy with the original patch (so they can apply it themselves) or should I repackage things so the diff/changelog is a little cleaner (it took me a few goes and the versioning is all over the place).\nNote: This question is about Compiz but I'd prefer if answers could address other styles of package too so we have an authoritative and comprehensive thread of how to get things fixed.\n\nA: It would require a Stable Release Update to ship it to 12.04. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates for acceptable types of fixes, and procedure for getting them in.\n\nA: As Dobey mentioned, in order for a patch to be accepted into an already released version of Ubuntu, it must got through the Stable Release Update (SRU) process. The bar to entry for SRUs is quite high. A simple way to sum up the thinking behind the process might be: \"The bug we know is better than the bug we don't know about.\" In practice, that means that only targeted bug fixes are allow and no changes that are too \"intrusive.\"\nThere are a number of requirements that must be met in order to proceed with an SRU:\n\n\n*\n\n*The bug is fixed in the current development release (i.e. quantal).\n\n*The bug report's description must be updated to include a justification for why the fix is needed in the stable release, a test case to reproduce the bug and verify it has been fixed, and a discussion of the fix's regression potential.\n\n*The Launchpad team ubuntu-sru should be subscribed to the bug report.\n\n*The package is then uploaded to release-proposed In order for this to happen, you will need to go through the sponsorship process (more info below).\n\n\nAfter all that has occurred, the SRU team will verify that the package in -proposed resolves the bug. Then the package will be pushed into -updates after it passed a minimum aging period of 7 days.\nFinding the right person\nYour question hints at the fact that sometimes Launchpad seems like it is where patches go to die. Sadly, if you don't know the process it can feel like that, but I swear it's not really that bad. Luckily, the main thing you need to know is simple. Check out the sponsorship process for all the details and some hints, but the most important part is to subscribe the ubuntu-sponsors team to the bug report. That ensures that it will show up in the sponsorship queue and get looked at by an honest to god Ubuntu  developer.\nIf you need to talk something over in real time, #ubuntu-devel on Freenode IRC will do the trick. Check the channel topic for the current patch pilot. They're there to help you. If there's no pilot on duty, feel free to ask for help in the channel, but please be patient. \nGetting everything ready to go\nIn order to make the process go as quickly as possible there are a few things to do.\nUpdate the bug description to look like:\n\n[Impact]\nHere's an explanation of the impact of the bug on users and a\n  justification for backporting the fix to the stable release\n[Test Case]\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Step\n  \n*By\n  \n*Step\n  \n*Instructions\n  \n*To Verify\n  \n*The Fix\n[Regression Potential] \nHere's a discussion of any potential for\n  regressions.\n[Original Report] \nEvery thing that used to be in the description is\n  retained below.\n\nNext, prepare your patches. Things will go much quicker if you provide debdiffs that take care of all the packaging bits rather than a patch against the upstream source. This includes using the packages patch system if it uses one. Luckily add-patch from ubuntu-dev-tools  can take care of that for you.\nLet's walk through this. First grab the source and the patch in the bug report:\n$ pull-lp-source compiz precise\n$ wget https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/974242/+attachment/3141645/+files/fix-974242.patch \n\nNow we'll add the patch to the source package:\n$ cd compiz-0.9.7.8/\n$ add-patch ../fix-974242.patch\n\nThis will add the patch to debian/patches and run dch prompting you to add a new entry to debian/changelog Adjust the entry to target proposed and increment the version number so that it will be below the next version uploaded to the development release. Like so:\ncompiz (1:0.9.7.8-0ubuntu1.1) precise-proposed; urgency=low\n\n  * debian/patches/fix-974242.patch: [DESCRIBE CHANGES HERE]\n\n -- Your Name <you@example.com>  Mon, 11 Jun 2012 17:37:59 -0400\n\nThe file at debian/patches/fix-974242.patch also has some headers that you might want to edit:\n## Description: add some description\n## Origin/Author: add some origin or author\n## Bug: bug URL\n\nNow build your new source package:\n$ debuild -S -us\n\nAnd create the debdiff:\n$ cd ..\n$ debdiff compiz_0.9.7.8-0ubuntu1.dsc compiz_0.9.7.8-0ubuntu1.1.dsc > sru-for-lp-974242.debdiff\n\nYou can now attach the resulting debdiff file to your bug report.\n", "Q: 12.04 - sound is laggy when running games through Wine Lenovo U400\nWine 1.5.5\nUbuntu 12.04 with all updates applied\nI'm experiencing severe (~500ms) audio lag in all games run in Wine.  Portal 2, Half-Life, World of Goo, and Fallout are all exhibiting this problem.  When I run winecfg though and click the \"Test Sound\" button at the bottom of the Audio tab, the sound effect appears to play immediately.  So I'm not sure what's going on.  I don't think it's a problem with PulseAudio by itself since totem videos and Youtube clips both play in perfect sync.\nAnyone have any ideas on where to start fixing this?  thanks!\n(edit: I thought this was limited to Steam games but I installed a non-Steam game and I now see that's not the case.  I get audio lag in other apps too.)\n\nA: I disabled PulseAudio by setting the environment variable WINENOPULSE=1 and Wine apps seem to work fine now.\n", "Q: Does ubuntu reduce CPU usage due to overheating? I have been running for a day at 100% CPU and suddenly seems that for the same tasks as before its usage has been limited to 50%. I suspect that overheating may be the cause.\nI am using 11.10. Is this throttle automated?\n\nA: No, Linux does not do this.  Theoretically your hardware is supposed to, but I have not heard of any that does.  You may be able to run sensors to check the temperature and see if it is getting too high ( near 100 C ).\n\nA: are you sure it was not a faulty process eating up all your resources before? Unless you are compiling code, video editing or things alike it is difficult to use 100% CPU, even less nowadays with dual cores or quadcores.\ntry again after a reboot...if you get 50% again it was a ghost process that was taking the CPU time.\n\nA: Canonical claimed to had fixed the unity in 11.10. But it still din't work well. For me, it was unity destkop environment which was eating up the processor all the time. The temperature of cores used to be high (68+) all the time.. Compiz was another role player in throttling the cpu. \nYou may check if its the case for you. You may try different desktop environment say light weight version of desktop environments. Examples would be DWM (from suckless.org) or Awesome (a light weight DE, a fork of DWM). If that helps, I would suggest to install 12.04 in which, unity seems to have become stable and less annoying. \n", "Q: Can I use another computer as a second monitor? Is there a way to extend my desktop's screen onto my laptop's display, as if the laptop was just another monitor in a dual-monitor configuration?\nMaybe with some combination of VNC and Synergy?\n\nA: I believe with the Nvidia-xserver-settings you can accomplish that provided you have an Nvidia card. You select twinview mode and designate the external monitor as primary and the laptop screen as secondary. That should do the trick.\nIf you have other graphic cards I am not sure how to do that.\n", "Q: Setting up a PPPoE internet connection in Ubuntu 12.04 I've been trying to set up my internet connection and router with Ubuntu 12.04 and I've been having some issues. I am currently trying to connect directly through my modem using the PPPoE username and password provided by my ISP. I ran sudo pppoeconf and input my information but was still unable to connect. \nFurthermore, my computer is now unable to connect to my wired network and upon startup spends about 5 minutes configuring network options before allowing 60 seconds to complete its task and eventually booting without all networks properly configured.\nI am new to Ubuntu and Linux and any beginner friendly help that you could provide would be greatly appreciated.\nEDIT: I am still unable to connect to the internet and I've grown to accept that Ubuntu won't successfully interface with my Japanese modem, but I was wondering if there was any way to avoid the 'configuring networks' delay on boot that I have been experiencing.\n\nA: It's quite simple.\nJust click on the NETWORK icon on top right.\nClick EDIT ......\nand in that, go to DSL tab.\nand click for NEW.\nYou will bhave 4 or more tabs.\ngo through each of them. and only fill the information which you know.\nand in the mac address field select your own mac address.\nGood Luck,.\n\nA: You need to look at:\nnetwork manager says “device not managed”\nAlthough, I am not sure this is an instant fix or anything ..\n\nA: I have had the unfortunate experience of tinkering with pppoeconf in kubuntu in the past.\nI was able to configure pppoe easily when I disabled bridge mode in my router settings. Check if bridge mode is active in your router settings and disable it and try pppoe again. Bridge mode requires you to provide a username and password everytime you attempt to connect to internet. Once I disabled bridge mode, I was easily able to connect to the internet. \nI am not an expert, just trying to help. Try tinkering with your router settings which must be accessible if your computer shows lan connection. \n", "Q: How do I choose a resolution? I have 2 monitors.\nThe display settings tool says the resolution of both monitors is 1280x1024, but one of them is actually using 1024x768, and scaling everything down to fit.  Now the text looked ugly!\nHow do I set the resolution of both monitors to 1280x1024?\nObviously, selecting \"1280x1024 (5:4)\" for both monitors didn't work.\n\nA: When you use the display tool, if you click on the second monitor from within the tool, does it still say 1280x1024?  The resolution that it displays is only for the currently selected monitor.\n", "Q: How to install NVIDIA.run? I have a Nvidia Ge force Ge6150 SE graphics card. I am running ubuntu 12.04.

It was the NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-340.76.run \nI switched to the the tty1 using Ctrl+Alt+F1 and also stopped the service lightdm and when running the executable got the same error .\nWhat I did to solve the problem was navigate to the /tmp folder and erase the  .X0-lock file. \nYou will only see it listed if you use ls -la as it is a hidden folder by default(that is why it has a dot in front of the name)\ncd /tmp\nrm -rf .X0-lock\n\nAfter erasing that folder and executing the NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-340.76.run it installed just fine.\n\nA: I installed latest nvidia drivers by this method:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nIt is working fine with unity 3d.

This error occurs when you try to install the Nvidia .run files while logged in.\nMake sure you are logged out.\n\n\n*\n\n*Hit Ctrl+Alt+F1 and login using your credentials.\n\n*kill your current X server session by typing sudo service lightdm stop or sudo lightdm stop\n\n*Enter runlevel 3 by typing sudo init 3\n\n*Install your *.run file.\n\n\n*\n\n*you change to the directory where you have downloaded the file by typing for instance cd Downloads. If it is in another directory, go there. Check if you see the file when you type ls NVIDIA*\n\n*Make the file executable with chmod +x ./your-nvidia-file.run\n\n*Execute the file with sudo ./your-nvidia-file.run\n\n\n*You might be required to reboot when the installation finishes. If not, run sudo service lightdm start or sudo start lightdm to start your X server again.\n\n*It's worth mentioning, that when installed this way, you'd have to redo the steps after each kernel update.\n\n\nA: Try this :\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Alt+F1, then log in.\n\n*Run sudo telinit 3 (if that doesn't work, try /sbin/telinit 3). Check that it is changed to level 3 with runlevel that should output something like 5 3 which means that the current run level is 3 and before it was 5.\n\nIn case that doesn't work, try:\nps ax | grep X\n\nIn the output you would see the PID number of the process X, so you should kill it with sudo kill -9 number where number is the PID number of the process.\n\nA: I had a hangup installing the 3.19 driver today because I did not remove the existing 3.13 driver. I used:\napt-get remove nvidia*\n\nto get rid of all existing files, then\ntelinit 3\nsh NVI*.run\n\nSuccess. I already had DKMS installed, and the driver program asked if it should use DKMS, so no worries about kernel upgrades. \n\nA: I tried all of these things and none of them worked for me, because I kept getting a Stop: Unknown instance error when I ran \"sudo stop lightdm\". I finally killed the x server by going into the lightdm log and finding its process number, then killing it that way:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd /var/log/lightdm\n\n*open the .log file (you may need to use sudo to do this)\n\n*look for something in the file that says \"launching process 'process number'\"\n\n*sudo kill -9 'process number'\nGood luck!\n\nA: I want to add my answer here because I couldn't install the NVidia driver, I couldn't get tty working and I wasn't able to install it in safe mode root shell. What I did was a combination of two answers here:\nNOTE: before doing this, be sure that the NVidia driver is already downloaded and in an accessible directory.\nFor reference, I have NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 750 TI and the following worked for me:\nInstalling the generic Nvidia driver will get tty working, do this with:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current \n\nNow you won't be able to get past the login screen in Ubuntu, but that's OK. Restart the computer and once you are brought to the sign in screen go to tty1 [ ctrl + alt + f1 ]. Now do the following commands:\nsudo service lightdm stop\ncd <path/to/NVIDIA>\nsudo sh ./NVIDIA*\n\nFollow the prompts and viola. After restarting everything should be working fine and dandy.\n\nA: If you have an NVIDIA .run file\n\n\n*\n\n*Remember (or write down) the folder you saved it in!\n\n*Make .run file executable by\nRight click > Properties > Permissions> Allow executing file as program\nor from command line with:\nchmod u+x NVIDIA-blabla.run\n\n*Log out\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to enter the virtual console and log in to it\n\n*Kill the X-server by\nsudo service lightdm stop       or sudo lightdm stop\n\n*sudo /path/to/the/file/NVIDIA-blabla.run\n\n*Follow the instructions in the installer\n\n*sudo service lightdm start   or sudo lightdm start\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+F7 to log in to graphical mode\n\n*If it doesn't work, go back to virtual console and restart/shutdown, e.g.\nsudo reboot now\n\nA: On Ubuntu 16, if you done lightdmstop and telinit 3, but the X server is still running (it will have \"failsafe\" string in process command line in ps), try this. Press Alt-F2 (perhaps try other F-keys for other consoles) and see if you get a graphic dialog window saying something about low graphics mode.\nFor me it had a number of options one of which was to go to the console. I chose it and the X server finally stopped so I could install the driver from Nvidia runfile.\n\nA: I got this error when stopped X server to install CUDA. My system is Ubuntu 16.04 and i installed CUDA 8.0 from runfile. I fixed it just by upgrading my system. When the error message appears, press Ctrl + Alt + F1, log in with your account, and then run the two following commands:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nand \nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nAfterward, sudo reboot it should be working fine.\n\nA: \nnvidia-installer log file '/var/log/nvidia-installer.log' creation time: Mon Jun 11 05:46:17 2012 installer version: 295.53\n\nPATH: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games\n\nnvidia-installer command line: ./nvidia-installer\n\nUsing: nvidia-installer ncurses user interface -> The file '/tmp/.X0-lock' exists and appears to contain the process ID '1062' of a >runnning X server.

After the installation had finished, the computer will shutdown, then you will get a message:\nPlease remove the installation media and close the tray (if any) and then press \"Enter\"\n\nThat's when you should remove the USB stick.  Remove the USB stick before that, bad stuff happens.\nFor the low disk level, maybe Ubuntu cannot read your drive correctly (since your drive can hold 25 copies of Ubuntu).\nI would say that you have to reinstall Ubuntu.  Recreate the Ubuntu USB stick using  Pendrive Linux and then follow the steps on the Ubuntu official website.  Choose \"Erase Disk and Install Ubuntu\" and remove the USB stick after Ubuntu told you to.\n\nA: I was able to solve it from this post.\nIt did install on the USB first. So I downloaded Boot repair: I used boot-repair, ticking \"reinstall grub\" as well as \"purge and reinstall\".\nI did not have to re-install again.\nGuess should have search some more before posting.

I configured a tp-link wr940N router from the windows 7 desktop, and I'd use a windows 7 laptop via wifi.\nI just wiped windows and installed ubuntu 12.04 on both the desktop and the laptop. No problem connecting to the internet, whether on the ubuntu desktop or the ubuntu laptop (through wifi) but the network definition is still a 'windows' network, and I'm not able to see one computer from the other. I guess the router is just doing it's thing, as if nothing changed. \nWhat do I need to do to have a regular home network? \n\nA: Just right click on any folder and select sharing options. You should be able to see the shared folder from the other computer.\nBTW you can still change your router configurations from the Ubuntu machine.

I use Ubuntu 12.04 (64-bit) as host OS and Windows 7 as guest OS. How can I ping the Windows 7 system from Ubuntu? And is that possible even when Internet is off?\n\nA: Assuming you can use the Windows 7 guest system, check its IP address. One way to do that in Windows is to open a Command Prompt (type cmd.exe in the textbox in the Start menu) and run ipconfig.\nYou may be told about IP addresses on multiple interfaces.\nNow try pinging them from the Ubuntu system by opening a Terminal window on the Ubuntu system (Ctrl+Alt+T) and using the ping command. For example:\nping -c 5 192.168.1.120\nReplace 192.168.1.120 with the IP address obtained from the Windows system with ipconfig. The -c 5 part tells ping to send 5 pings, then stop. (You can change that to whatever you want, or leave off the -c flag altogether and it will continue pinging until you stop it with Ctrl+C.)\nYou can repeat that with the other IP addresses, if you got more than one IP address from ipconfig in Windows. But don't ping 127.0.0.1--that IP address always refers to the local computer. (So if you ping 127.0.0.1 from your Ubuntu host machine, you're pinging your Ubuntu host machine, not the Windows guest machine.)\nPlease note that by default, all recent (in fact, all non-EoL) versions of Windows have a firewall enabled that blocks pings. You can turn this firewall off or customize it so it does, though. Details about how to do this would probably be considered off-topic for AskUbuntu (but on-topic for a Windows forum or a general computing support site).\n\nThis will work without Internet access, but this will not work without a network connecting the host machine to the guest machine. If you have a router that provides IP addresses via DHCP and also Internet access, and you turn that router off, then (unless the host and guest still remember their old IP's), this will not work.\nBut you can always set up a \"host-only\" network between the Windows virtual machine and the Ubuntu host machine in VirtualBox. This will permit pinging and other network activity between the host and guest machines even when there is no other network connection. To do this, click Devices > Network Adapters in the menu bar at the top of the VirtualBox virtual machine window, then select Host-only Adapter in the Attached to drop-down menu.\n\nWhile in the above screenshot, I am changing the setting for the single network adapter (thus disabling access to whatever other network there might be), the network settings window shown above also lets you enable another network adapter (you can have up to four easily) and make it \"Host-only.\" Just click Adapter 2.\n", "Q: Will not install on my laptop Tried installing it every which way, none of them even get me to choose language screen.

Occasionally when I reboot the system, I've noticed that some of the ports on the hub get powered down: the green light next to the port is turned off, and the device attached to that port is not visible to lsusb or similar commands.  Devices attached to the other ports on the hub function as normal.\nI am able to restore the ports by disconnecting power to the hub temporarily (from the computer, AC adapter and any devices that might provide any power such as my phone), but this is a bit of a hassle.\nIt seems like something that might be related to power management, so is there some way you can tell the USB hub to power up through software?\n\nA: hub-ctrl will do what you need.\nsudo apt-get install libusb-dev\ncc -o hub-ctrl hub-ctrl.c -l usb\nsudo ./hub-ctrl -v\nsudo ./hub-ctrl -P 2 -p 1 # turn on port 2\nsudo ./hub-ctrl -P 2 -p 0 # turn off port 2\n\nDisclaimer: although I have tested it on Ubuntu 12.04 (precise), I did not write this utility.  It does require a hub with built in power control, but given that your hub is powering down certain ports it is a good bet your hub has it.\n\nA: USB power has nothing to do with the OS.  It depends on the device itself.  Some hubs are self powered, in which case they get their power from the system; others require more power, and those have their own power supply.  \n\nA bus-powered hub is a hub that draws all its power from the host computer's USB interface. It does not need a separate power connection. However, many devices require more power than this method can provide, and will not work in this type of hub.\n  -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_hub#Power\n\nUnder Linux, you can use hwinfo --usb or for more detail try lsusb -v -t if hwinfo --usb is not installed you can install it.  Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command below.\nsudo aptitude install hwinfo usbutils\n\nNote:\n\nSome self-powered hubs do not supply enough power to drive a 500mA\n  load on every port. For example, many seven port hubs have a 1A power\n  supply, when in fact seven ports could draw a maximum of 7 x 0.5 =\n  3.5A, plus power for the hub itself. Designers assume the user will most likely connect many low power devices and only one or two\n  requiring a full 500mA. On the other hand, the packaging for some\n  self-powered hubs states explicitly how many of the ports ports can\n  drive a 500 mA full load at once. For example the packaging on a 7\n  port hub might claim to support a maximum of 4 full load devices \". \n  So I would check with D-Link.\nMost portable media devices sync data to a desktop or laptop computer\n  via the USB port. The batteries in these devices can also be charged\n  by that same powered USB connection. There may be situations, however,\n  when you may need to change the default power settings of a particular\n  USB port so the device connected to it does not interfere with the\n  your computer's performance. For example, some types of devices\n  connected to a computer's USB port can prevent the computer from going\n  into its power-saving \"sleep\" mode.

It worked on 12.10, but not on 12.04.  (Have you tried yours in 12.10?)  I wanted 12.04, however, so what I ended up doing was testing newer and newer kernels.  I ended up with the 3.6.3 kernel, and everything is working great.  (If you try this, of course do the research & take the necessary precautions, e.g. back-up.)\n\nA: Yes I have the same problem with my Dell 5110, the only viable solution to this so far is when navigating while searching the web is to double tap the scroll on the side of the window and keep your finger on the touchpad.  As far as I'm concerned this dell touchpad didn't even work well in windows it's kind of hard to find, since it's incorporated within the pad itself, the touchpad on my girlfriends laptop scroll works fine.  It's an acer laptop with a protruding scroll and not hidden within the pad like on the Dell.  The only other solution is to maybe to buy a usb mouse and try that.  I hoped this helped.  Good luck.  \nAlso, under most of the Dell touchpad reviews most of the people said they were not impressed with it's functionality.  They also didn't like the speaker layout also.

Create and edit the PostgreSQL repository by running the command below:\n~$ sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list\nPress I on keyboard and add the below line into the file:\ndeb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ trusty-pgdg main\nPress Esc on keyboard and followed by :wq to save the file.\n2. Download & import the repository key:\n~$ wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -\n3. Update your system:\n~$ sudo apt-get update\n4. Now you’re able to install PostgreSQL via below command:\n~$ sudo apt-get install postgresql-8.4 pgadmin3\nNOTE: I've omitted pgadmin3 because I had it installed before.\nNOTE 2: The link doesn't mention but if you have another PG version installed, remember you'll have to change port in one of your installations:\n~$ sudo updatedb\n~$ locate postgresql.conf\n/etc/postgresql/10/main/postgresql.conf\n/etc/postgresql/8.4/main/postgresql.conf\n~$ cp /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/postgresql.conf /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/postgresql.conf_yyyymmdd\n~$ sudo vi /etc/postgresql/8.4/main/postgresql.conf\n\nFind the entry that says:\nport = 5433 and change port number to new value.

Alternatively it would also be a good idea to create an image of the whole drive to be able to restore to the previous state in case we further mess up the partition table. We can do so with\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda of=<path>/backup.img\n\nReplace <path> with the location of your backup medium (e.g. an external drive).\nRunning testdisk on an image will save you a lot of headaches if something goes wrong, and it will also allow you to try out what you believe is right without any risk of further data loss.

Also, you can access it from 192.168.25.1 as that IP is inside your network and never changes(Think of an apartment building that moves around and has its street address change but the apartment numbers are constant).

What happened and what can I do that id also recognises it?\n(just starting a new shell didn't change anything)\n\nA: id shows information about the process that invokes it (or more precisely, it shows information about itself, which it inherits from the process that invokes it). The group database is only consulted at login time, and it only affects processes descended from that login session. The login process is granted the groups listed in the group database, and all other processes inherit from their parent.\nStarting a new shell doesn't make a difference, you need to log out and back in. You can test your changes by logging in in another console or with ssh localhost or with su me.\nYou can query the group database with getent group vboxusers. Unless your machine uses NIS or LDAP to obtain user and group information from a network server, this will give the same information as grep '^vboxusers:' /etc/group. Again, this information tells you what happens at login time, it is not consulted afterwards.\n", "Q: When typing, mouse stops moving i did a clean installation of Ubuntu 12.04 recently and all is well, except\nfor one small thing.

I have just tried out Parallels 7 for running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and encountered a few problems. These are:\nUnrecognized Platform\nThe first problem I have encountered is that Parallels 7 does not recognize Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Server (64 bit) or Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Desktop (64 & 32 bit). I have to manually select \"Ubuntu\" from the list of platforms.\nNo fast-track installation\nI also noticed that there is no \"fast-track\" installation of Ubuntu that bypasses all the installation screens. This may be a bug because the Ubuntu version is unrecognized, or perhaps strictly want of a feature. However, I had expected there to be feature-parity with vmWare Fusion 4.\nNo Parallels tools installed\nNone of the tools for Parallels were installed automatically (which is kind of expected given the lack of platform support). It was not apparent where they go or how to run them from the installation. When I run Virtual Machine -> Install Parallel Tools ... nothing seems to be mounted in the VM - /dev/fd0 returns \"is not a valid block device\" and there is no /dev/cdrom or equivalent in fstab; it was not apparent how to mount the install tools. Parallels indicates that it is mounted as device SATA 0:2, but I do not know offhand how to go about tracking this down in /dev.\nNo bridged networking\nFor no apparent reason Bridged networking does not work at all. A Google search indicated that this was a known problem.\n\nAll of the above may stem from the first issue: lack of platform support. Perhaps these are individual and discrete issues. Nevertheless, I encountered them all within minutes of downloading and installing Parallels 7, so I though to raise them here to see if they have been addressed.\nAs some context, I was a vmWare 3 user that clicked on the free trial of vmWare 4. Since vmWare 4 did not seem to offer any particular benefits over vmWare 3 I wanted to \"downgrade\" back to my licensed version of vmWare 3- but this proved to be problematic. As a result, I wanted to give Parallels a try. At first glance, Parallels 7 seems to be snappier than vmWare and seems to use fewer resources, however the above issues make it appear to be less polished. That's my 2ç contribution to the glut of vmWare v Parallels comparisons. :)\nAny thoughts on the above issues would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks for reading!\n\nA: It all seems to be working with the latest version of Parallels 7 (August 3rd - ParallelsDesktop-7.0.15106.786747) that I just downloaded.  I'm guessing that it just took a few revisions for the Parallels developers to catch up with the changes to the new version of Ubuntu.\n\nA: I successfully installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Desktop (64 bit) using the Fast Track installation but I had to complete the installation manually (by choosing 'Installaion -> Complete Manually...') so that Parallels would exit the installation process.\nI downloaded the Ubuntu iso image and physically burned a CD, then pointed Parallels at it and chose the Fast Track installation.\nI then also successfully installed the Parallels Tools. I had to first unmount the current CDROM device. The Parallels Tools disk image is mounted at /media/Parallels Tools. So\ncd /media/Parallels\\ Tools\nsudo ./install\n\nbrings up an installer window. Use space or return to proceed through the prompts, then reboot.\nI am using Shared Networking, though. So no help there, sorry.\n", "Q: Problem with a DNA sequencer I have recently obtained the MinION USB genome (DNA) sequencer, which to my disappointment doesn't seem to be working in Ubuntu properly.\nI'm using the 12.04 release of Ubuntu. The sequencer is properly detected by the script/driver that comes with it, but seems to be unable to detect the sample.\nI'm attaching the screenshot of the process. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\n\nA: Seeing as the device is properly detected by the script, it seems more likely that your problem is on the gene sequencer side of things, rather than being an Ubuntu issue.  Are there any other utilities which will allow you to communicate with your sequencer for any other features, perhaps a calibration routine?  If Ubuntu can communicate with the machine and get it to do other things, I would expect the problem is with the gene sequencer rather than with the computer.  Another possible test is to try using another operating system, if there is software available.  Finally, make sure you sequencer has the latest firmware, and that the software you are using to connect is up to date.\n\nA: A wild guess: Could it be a permissions issue? Some devices work OK for some operations when run as an ordinary user, but require root privileges to perform other operations. Thus, you might try sudo ./gseq and see if that helps. If that helps but you don't want to run as root all the time, you can track down the device file(s) and change their permissions to give yourself access to the device using your normal account. This would probably involve creating udev rules. I won't go into that here since this solution is a bit of a long shot.\n\nA: Is it possible that the 6 hour life of the device has been exceeded? It's seems likely that it's more of a device error or a process problem.  MinION technical support should possibly be your main contact to resolve this issue since it does appear that the program is communicating with the device.\nChris\n", "Q: Should I upgrade from 11.04 to 12.04 directly or upgrade to 11.10 first \nPossible Duplicate:\nCan I skip over releases? \n\nUpgrade manager is talking about doing upgrade 11.10\nCan (and should) I go straight to 12.04 ?

GParted seems to be the more robust and feature-rich application of the two, is there a reason as to why GParted is not installed by default in Ubuntu?\n\nA: A while back I've read somewhere on the net that Disk Utility (Palimpsest) is a udisks graphical front-end included in the gnome-disk-utility package, that gives the opportunity to set up an encrypted partition easily, with a couple of clicks, whereas with GParted you need to use the cryptsetup command line tool. \n\nA: Can't tell you what the developers had in mind, but the way I see it, an OS shouldn't give you the richest tool available for a certain goal, but the tool most people need in an OS.\nBy \"most people\" I mean most people that are part of the destination audience the OS is aimed for, which in Ubuntu's case are probably daily Internet + Office + some Multimedia users, or in other words, the average home user. \nPacking a tool that few people will use regularly is a bad design, as it grabs disk space unnecessarily for people who don't use it. Most home users don't need to and don't want to use the intensive features of GParted.\nI believe Gimp was removed for the same reason. Most home users do not manipulate images, and when they do from time to time they don't need all the features in Gimp. So why waste their disk space?\nBesides, most of GParted's advantage comes into effect only in a live session anyway, because you can not manipulate mounted partitions. Live CD is the natural place for GParted. A few times I even loaded Live CD before windows installation to get GParted for partitioning :)\n", "Q: Problem booting Windows after failed installation of 12.04 alongside Windows 7 I tried to install in my laptop 12.04 so that I can dual-boot with Windows 7. I made some mistakes during this process and I didn't manage to install Ubuntu.\nBut my real problem now is that I'm afraid that I also destroyed the installation of Windows 7. Your help would be precious for me.\nHere are the details of what I did:\n1.) I followed these instructions to dual boot Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7.\nThe only difference from what is described above, is that in my case the device names where:\n/dev/mapper/isw_fdjdhbadc_Volume0* instead of /dev/sda*\nNote that I had created a bootable USB stick to do that.\n2.)

Then, I did something stupid (I think): I run the above command as:\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/home/ubuntu/temp /dev/mapper/isw_fdjdhbadc_Volume0\n\nnamely I tried to install grub in the device isw_fdjdhbadc_Volume0 instead of the boot partition isw_fdjdhbadc_Volume0p5\nThe above command did not fail and was executed OK.\n5.) After that, I tried to boot my laptop, but it seemed that I had no operation system. Not even Windows were detected.\n6.) I thought that I should uninstall grub from isw_fdjdhbadc_Volume0. So following some online instructions that I found, I booted again Ubuntu from the USB stick and run the following command (this was stupid since the instructions were for a totally different case than mine):\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/isw_fdjdhbadc_Volume0  bs=446 count=1\n\nAfte that, I was still unable to boot Windows.

How to get the details like SSID and all that... \n\nA: If you are using network manager, right click the \"Network Manager\" icon, hit \"Connection Information\".  It will show you all those details.\nAnd if I remember correctly, the SSID is the network name (so if the wifi network's name is \"IAmTheEvil\", then the SSID is \"IAmTheEvil\").\nHowever, if you are trying to configure your wireless networking, Network Manager is basically \"click and connect\", just left-click the Network Manager icon, and then choose the wifi network to connect to.  If you don't know the SSID of your wifi, you're kind of out of luck there.\n\nA: \nOver recent years it has become increasingly common for computers to\n  be connected to local area networks and the Internet via wireless\n  Wi-Fi connections. This has spread from the home and public spaces\n  such as libraries and Cafes into the enterprise, especially with the\n  advent of increased wireless security and faster standards such as\n  802.11n.\nSupport for wireless networking in Ubuntu has come a long way since\n  the days of manually editing network configuration files. In fact,\n  configuring access to Wi-Fi networks using Ubuntu is now easier than\n  it has ever been thanks to something called the Network Manager.\n\nIf you're looking for a tutorial that guides you through the process, then take a look at this.\nSource: http://techotopia.com/index.php/Configuring_Ubuntu_11.04_Wireless_Networking\n", "Q: Why does cron.hourly not care about the existence of anacron? This question came up over in Root Access.\nWhy does the default /etc/crontab not check for existence (and executable flag) of /usr/sbin/anacron for the hourly entry?\nMy /etc/crontab:\n# m h dom mon dow user  command\n17 *    * * *   root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly\n25 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )\n47 6    * * 7   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )\n52 6    1 * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )\n\nWhat makes hourly different from the others?\n\nA: anacron is running on a daily basis. It is not built to let jobs run on a hourly basis, so it is useless to test for anacron when an hourly job is started. To quote anacron(8):\n\nAnacron  can  be  used to execute commands periodically, with a\n  frequency specified in days.  Unlike cron(8), it does not assume that\n  the machine is running continuously.  Hence, it can be used on\n  machines that aren't running 24 hours a day, to control daily, weekly,\n  and  monthly  jobs  that  are usually controlled by cron.\n\nThe other regularly executed jobs should only be executed by cron, when anacron is not installed.\n", "Q: What is the story behind the default times set in /etc/crontab? To my understanding, this is the default configuration of /etc/crontab:\n# m h dom mon dow user  command\n17 *    * * *   root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly\n25 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )\n47 6    * * 7   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )\n52 6    1 * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )\n\nWhy were these specific times chosen for the default entries?\nAt first I assumed that they are somewhat randomized on installation to even out the system load, but that doesn't seem to be correct.\n\nA: Ubuntu started in 2004, and is based on Debian. By then, the current crontab was present, so we get to trace through Debian history to find its origins.\nHere is the crontab from Debian 0.93R6 (November 1995). The hour is present, but the minute is different for the cron.daily entry:\n# m h dom mon dow user  command\n42 6    * * *   root    run-parts /etc/cron.daily\n47 6    * * 7   root    run-parts /etc/cron.weekly\n52 6    1 * *   root    run-parts /etc/cron.monthly\n\nBy Debian 2.1 (March 9, 2009), it changed. The cron.hourly entry isn't present yet, but the rest of the times are the same as they are currently:\n25 6    * * *   root    run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily\n47 6    * * 7   root    run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly\n52 6    1 * *   root    run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly\n\nThankfully, Debian has changelogs, so we can see why this change was made. I've linked the bug number, which thankfully Debian keeps around:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do cron.daily a little earlier, try to avoid overlap with cron.weekly (closes: Bug#23023) (from 3.0pl1-46)\n\n\nNow, finding out where 6 AM and 47 and 52 came from, you'll have to follow back into pre-Debian history. I've checked the original Vixie Cron sources, and it doesn't appear to come from there.\nAs far as I can tell, SLS 1.03 didn't ship cron, but SLS 1.05 did. However, it doesn't appear to have come with an /etc/crontab, and the example in the manpage is different. Nor does it have a run-parts.\nLooking at run-parts from Debian 0.93R6 (package miscutils), it seems its a Debian-specific tool (a short Perl script back then). So those cron lines probably originate from very early Debian development.\n", "Q: How to \"LOCK\" D: to my launcher? How to \"LOCK\" D: to my launcher?\nI am not getting option in right-click menu to lock it over LAUNCHER.\nPlease Help.\n\nA: You cannot \"lock\" partitions to the launcher in that way.

I've gone into my sound settings and whenever a notification appears, a \"Skype\" appears under \"Applications,\" and it is muted.  Pressing \"mute\" doesn't do anything, and whenever I slide the volume up, it snaps back to 0%.\nI don't seen anything that could be causing it in my .Skype folder.  Any ideas?\n\n\nA: In the Skype options->Notifications, did you make sure the checkbox was checked for \"Play sound file:\"?\nIf so, did you try highlighting the notification that doesn't work, and checking \"Enable Event\", and then using the \"Test Event\" button?  If the sound does not play, try going to the directory specified for the file (/usr/share/skype/sounds by default) and making sure you can play the sound.\nIf not, then you may be missing a codec or something, and you can concentrate on getting that filetype to work (try other similar files).  \nEdit\nadded one more step...  I played around with my setup, using the Skype \"Test Event\" button with the sound settings open.  I found that I could quickly check the mute checkbox in the applications section when it appeared - I used the \"Call Connecting\" event; strangely enough, many of the events never appeared in this window.  The seem to be controlled by the \"Alert Volume\" in the \"Sound Effects\" tab of this same settings dialog.  I remember having problems at first when this volume control slider was too low, and many Skype sounds didn't work.  Are all the sounds muted in the \"Test Event\" page?\n\nA: You should go in \"Sound Effects\" (in pulseaudio) and unmute volume alert.\n\nA: I had the same problem. It took me a while to fix it. Apparently Skype has at least two possible entries in the Windows Mixer app. If you are logged in to Skype and have the main window open, the entry will be labeled \"Skype - yourname\", but if you have the Skype Options panel open the title changes to \"Skype Options\". My problem was that somehow the volume for \"Skype Options\" was muted and the only place where this is shown is in the Mixer App and then only when the Options page is active.\n", "Q: Why is the kernel module cfg80211 also listed as a kernel process [cfg80211]? I do not understand why the kernel module cfg80211 is also listed by ps aux as shown below:\n$ ps aux | grep cfg80211\nroot 521 0.0 0.0 0 0 ? S< 16:09 0:00 [cfg80211]\n\n\nA: It is the standard behavior of ps to list kernel threads, as these too are processes--just a different kind of process, because they run in supervisor mode (which some people call \"kernel mode\").\nIf you run ps ax (or ps aux) without piping its output to grep, you'll see a whole bunch of kernel modules listed first (and then probably some others interspersed with user processes, if they were started later).\nFor example, here's the first 10 lines of the current output of ps ax on my system:\n  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND\n    1 ?

S<     0:00 [cpuset]\n\nlsmod will list loaded modules. ps aux will list current processes, including kernel processes associated with modules. These are different things, however. For example, a loaded kernel module might have any number of kernel processes associated with it (zero or more).\n", "Q: How can I tell if my hourly cron job has run?

If a cron has run, it would have a line like:\nJun 11 19:09:01 penguin CRON[17376]: (root) CMD (  [ -x /usr/lib/php5/maxlifetime ] && [ -d /var/lib/php5 ] && find /var/lib/php5/ -depth -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type f -cmin +$(/usr/lib/php5/maxlifetime) ! -execdir fuser -s {} 2>/dev/null \\; -delete)\nJun 11 19:17:01 penguin CRON[17799]: (root) CMD (   cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly)\n\nFor troubleshooting tips, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto#Troubleshooting_and_Common_Problems\n\nA: One major pitfall to cron is cron runs in an extremely limited shell environment, as a result a lot of variables aren't exported in to the environment, mainly $PATH. Make sure you use all absolute paths to executable, including common functions like echo, uptime, date, etc all need to use full paths (/bin/echo, /bin/date, /usr/bin/uptime). To determine the path to an executable, you can use the which command like so: which echo - this will show you the full path to that tool.\n\nA: Try changing the first line of your script (the interpreter) to:\n#!/bin/bash\nI've also had problems in the past, with environment variables and PATH issues.

First off let me say a HUGE thanks to all of you here.  I have used your forums frequently with past upgrades (I am on my 4th).\nI recently upgraded to 12.04.\nThe upgrade went perfectly.  The smoothest ever and it even kept the Classic View that I like best.  The only issue that was bugging me was the lack of a Volume Control Icon on the top panel.\nI thought I found a way to change that using windows button-alt -right click, add indicator Applet.  But my novice fingers ended up placing that applet on my top bar 3 times.  In a series of attempts to fix what I did I ended up removing, adding to, then deleting the entire panel.  (I am not ready to give up Ubuntu but sometimes wonder why I even try to mess with it.)\nAnyway, Here are my two big needs:\n1) I REALLY want my top panel to be where it was when I upgraded it.  Right now I have the Indicator Applet on the right and NOTHING on the left.   It was those left side menu bars that I used the most.  Can I undo or redo this?\n2)  Currently, because I do not have those menus on the left side I do not have my Mozilla Firefox icon to get online.  I just ran the Update manager, hoping it would magically fix it, and one of the things listed was the installation of Firefox BUT....   I at this time can not figure out how to open up a browser.

I recently bought a \"noppoo choc mini\" with this specific ANSI US-INTERNATIONAL pc84 layout\nThis specific keyboard only has 84 keys, a 60% (compact tenkeyless) reduced layout.\nMy problem is simple, there is no keyboard layout into Ubuntu 12.04 which corresponds to this English, US keyboard layout ... so it's the same problem with the reduced version and only 84 keys...\nI searched for a template of a normal ANSI US-INTERNATIONAL for xmodmap/xkb, and after that I ccould try to manually map the other keys. I searched on Google, but I couldn't find any other user which has the same problem.\nEdit 1 :\nHere you can see there is probably a bug in Ubuntu, because the layout for USA with dead key is not correct !\nI have this now.\nAnd other users have this for the same layout: \nEDIT 2 \nIt seems after a \"sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration\" :\nfrench standard keyboard pc105 + precision M65 keyboard from dell laptop\nNow I can see the good US layout in the parameters, but I cannot choose the iso layout for French usage...\nEDIT 3\nOk, I'll explain the problem a bit better: I have one laptop with an integrated French keyboard, and I want to use my USB keyboard to use an English, US layout. \nIt seem it's impossible in Ubuntu and \"dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration\" to share two different physical layout (ANSI and EU ISO) on the same computer ...\nEDIT4\nOk, it seems I can switch the physical layout (ISO <-> ANSI) with this command in the terminal:\nsetxkbmap -layout us\nsetxkbmap -layout us -variant alt-intl\n\nan\nsetxkbmap -layout fr \n\nIt's very complicated and it seem Ubuntu 12.04 still has a problem with the keyboard manager because all works great with these two commands, but that doesn't change anything in the System parameters → Keyboard !!!\nSecondly: The image of the layout for FR is buggy, the layout is not ISO, but I can press on the key < > at the left of right Shift without any problem! You can see the image here (french alternative with ANSI layout ? it's crazy ?) : \nCan you help me on this point ? \nI'm lost with xkb, and manual mapping is very complicated ...\n\nA: I may not have a lot of experience with coding, software engineering or even with linux systems, but i do know one thing: a computer, no matter what system it uses, is mostly based on the human brain.\nNow i know it's possible for a brain (and a computer) to learn 2 languages side-by-side, but what you're asking of the pc is a bit different. You're not asking it to use two languages side-by-side, you're asking it to use those two languages simultaniously, so basically to consider 2 outputs for a single input, and let the computer choose which one to use.\nOn itself, this shouldn't be too much of an issue, if it weren't for the fact that this translation process takes place within the software, rather than in the keyboard, making it (near) impossible for the computer to know which one to use. For instance (not entirely sure about the specific layout of the fr-iso keyboard, so forgive me if this is exaggerated) you could type the 'Q' key on the USB-keyboard, but the computer would have to interpret it as \"'Q' or 'A'\". Now yóu know you typed a Q, but all the computer knows is that you typed in a specific key with multiple translations. Which is where the keyboard settings come into action.\nUsing the keyboard layout setting, you tell your computer how to interpret your keystrokes. So you basically tell it what dictionary to use for that keyboard. If you want to use the other keyboard, you should set the dictionary to the appropriate language, or the computer might misinterpret your keystrokes, causing it to think you're still using the standard (fr-iso) keyboard, where you àctually want it to use the en-us dictionary. I would compare it with speaking spanish while in portugal: they mostly know what you mean, but some things just don't make sense due to semantic differences.\nSo, long story short: simultanious use is impossible, unless both keyboards have the ability to automatically tell the computer which layout to use. Imo, your best bet would be to set up shortcuts or scripts to easily change the keyboard settings (like Windows uses the Left-ctrl + Left-shift combination). However, to make sure this happens correctly, it ís recommended to manually map your keys (the only one who knows the correct interpretation for sure is you), and maybe find a way to export this mapping for easy use within either a script or application for ease of changing the layouts. (Like i said, no experience in coding, so although i assume there's a way, i'm not the person to know that way: comments would be welcome)\nHope it helps\n\nA: AFAIK you cannot have two different input layouts at the same time in a non-custom graphics environment; and it is not worth the time to make it receive two inputs with different layouts, just because you can workaround the issue with a shortcut. (Maybe i'm wrong and you can do it editing files for the X server, but nowadays we don't get used to edit those files, but you can try)\nThat small keyboard will work very well with an US International layout, decide if you want dead keys, alt gr dead keys or any variant.\nJust set a shortcut to be able to change between US Int and Fr keyboards and press the shortcut before using each one. It depends on your desktop environment.\nAs a final note, i find the idea of using two keyboards too demanding for the user. In my personal experience i finally decided to use the US Int keyboard layout in every PC i use, just because it works for everything, i was able to input english, spanish, portuguese, japanese and simplified chinese without needing to learn more than one keyboard layout. Keep in mind that the hard part to memorize on the keyboards are not the alphabet characters, but the punctuation characters, and that's why you'll end deciding to use just one keyboard. Before the US Int layout i was comfortable with the Spanish Spain layout, because i just needed to write in spanish and english at the time (with very few words from portuguese and french).\n\nA: I usually change my keyboard between en, fr and es-mydvorak (last one is my own modified keyboard). In order to do so you can create shortcuts, as for myself I use Super+f1, Super+f2 and Super+f3 in your keyboard or system settings (depending on your OS). Another trick that I figure is to create a function which I insert in .profile to be charged also with X11 when I login.\nsetkb () \n{ \n    if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then\n        echo \"you need arguments\";\n    else\n        if [ $# -eq 1 ]; then\n            setxkbmap -layout $1;\n            notify-send \"Keyboard MSG\" \"keyboard changed to $1\" -u low;\n        else\n            if [ $# -eq 2 ]; then\n                setxkbmap -layout $1 -variant $2;\n                notify-send \"Keyboard MSG\" \"keyboard changed to $1 - $2\" -u low;\n            fi;\n        fi;\n    fi\n}\n\nThis function changes the keyboard layout and sends a message telling you that you modified your layout to the passed parameter. Thus said, when I create the shortcut mapping setkb en to Super+f2 and setkb es mydvorak to Super+f1 and so on.\n", "Q: Why get Ubuntu One Music cloud over regular free Ubuntu One?

Where can I find this?\n\nA: \nNote: Users of Ubuntu 12.04 Precise will not experience this issue because Disks 3.4.1 is only available via PPA or in the next Ubuntu release, 12.10 Quantal.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Disks 3.3+ is a complete rewrite of the old gnome-disk-utility (aka Palimpsest).

Strangely enough the rules in resolv.conf seem to take effect only selectively, which leaves me puzzled. Observe:\n[2] user@mach:~$ ssh pangolin\nssh: Could not resolve hostname pangolin: Name or service not known\n[2] user@mach:~$ host pangolin\npangolin.subdomain.domain.tld has address 172.16.7.12\n\nsubdomain.domain.tld is on the search line in /etc/resolv.conf and using host the name is properly searched given those rules. However, with the SSH client ssh I receive the error reproduced above. How can this be? I was always of the impression that the name resolution rules in resolv.conf apply system-global.\nNote: /etc/hosts doesn't declare the name pangolin at all. The package openssh-server is configured on the target machine. The question is purely about why name resolution isn't consistent between those two programs.\nAnother note: the command works fine when I enter the fully-qualified domain name, i.e. pangolin.subdomain.domain.tld.\nMeanwhile I rebooted the client machine (10.04) and the problem still exists.

Removing mdns4 resolved this issue for me.\n\nA: Whereas ssh and other programs such as ping use the glibc resolver to look up the host name ('pangolin' in this case), host looks the name up in DNS directly, bypassing the glibc resolver.  That's the difference.\nHowever, given that the glibc resolver is, on your machine, configured to try dns after files, I can't explain why the resolver fails where host succeeds.\nTo try with the glibc resolver, one can use getent hosts ... in place of host ....\nI have seen this behavior reported before when dnsmasq was used as a local forwarding nameserver (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dnsmasq/+bug/998712) but you aren't using such a local nameserver; but perhaps the problem there and here wasn't in dnsmasq but in the glibc resolver.\n\nA: Your ssh may try to resolve IP6 and time out doing this.

Since dist-upgrading 12.04 LTS in such a manner as resulted in an upgrade of GNOME from 3.2.x to 3.4.1, auto_raise is broken.  \nI have the usual auto_raise* settings set in gconf, in apps -> metacity -> general.  But \nthe functionality just doesn't work anymore. \nFocus follows mouse works fine, yes, but windows just no longer raise after a short delay.  I have tried both gconf and tweak tool-based remedies, to no avail.\nAny ideas on how to work around this?  Auto-raise is a really integral part of my workflow.\n\nA: I think this is because gconf-editor is being phase out in favor of dconf-editor. I had a similar problem (actually the opposite, I was trying to disable auto_raise and it wouldn't work). It seems that the setting in gconf-editor is overwritten by the setting in dconf-editor.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\ndconf-editor\n\nNavigate to org/gnome/desktop/wm/preferences.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 11.10 completely freezes Hello all. My Ubuntu 11.10 installation seems to suddenly lock up. I cannot move my mouse or use the keyboard, all screen activity stops, and I have to do a hard reboot. Is there an y method to repair this? It started a few days ago.\n\nA: Before you panic, try the magic SysRq trick. Find the key on your keyboard labelled PRT SCRN|SYSRQ(Could be arranged differently). Hold that key, ALT and M. This invokes the Linux oom_kill which could aid in recovering. Also, try this with B instead of M and see it it reboots then. If it does, then you are either out of memory(If you have a swap partition, your disk may be active), or you have another software issue. If not, it is hardware. Try pressing CTRL+ALT+F1 during the freeze. Does that work? If so, you can use top after logging in to ascertain the process causing the issue.\nTry running vmstat 1 in the Teminal. In a comment, tell us your swapin and swapout values.\nAlso ,try running top, giving us the top %CPU values, then pressing SHIFT+O, then Q or T, then ENTER. and the RSS and SHR values of the top processes. This can help pinpoint the cause. Also, are you using Skype, by any chance? There is a reported memory leak in it. \n", "Q: Sager NP6165 (Realtek) Wireless Not Working Hello I'm having issues with my new laptop (Sager NP6165) getting wireless.\nI've been searching for a solution, to no avail.\nMy Network Card,\nIntegrated 802.11 b/g/n wireless LAN half mini card module + Bluetooth\nsudo lshw -C network\n*-network UNCLAIMED     \n   description: Network controller\n   product: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.\n   vendor: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.\n   physical id: 0\n   bus info: pci@0000:03:00.0\n   version: 00\n   width: 64 bits\n   clock: 33MHz\n   capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list\n   configuration: latency=0\n   resources: ioport:d000(size=256) memory:f7900000-f7903fff\n\nlspci\n04:00.0 Unassigned class [ff00]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

There was a problem upgrading to Firefox 13. This error kept returning:\n/var/cache/apt/archives/firefox_13.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1_i386.deb\n    W: Waited for dpkg --assert-multi-arch but was not there - dpkgGo (10: There are no \"child\" processes).\n\nNow it seems that there is some problem with dpkg and I can't install anything from software center. I already tried to clean previous packages with sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/* -vf and then sudo apt-get update, it didn't work.\nWhen running sudo dpkg --configure -a, I get this:\ndpkg: problems with dependencies prevent the configuration of firefox-globalmenu:\nfirefox-globalmenu depends on firefox (= 13.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1); however:\n  The package is not installed.\ndpkg: error while processing firefox-globalmenu (--configure):\nproblems com dependencies - leaving unconfigured\nThere has been found errors while processing:\nfirefox-globalmenu\n\nWhat should I do to fix this??\nEDIT: I don't have the necessary expertise to understand why what I did worked and what was causing the conflict, but anyway, since there was a problem with firefox-globalmenu:, I went to synaptics package manager, I removed this particular package and reinstalled it. After that, I was able to install Firefox from synaptics and also any other applications from software center. \nHowever, still there was a problem, when running sudo apt-get update, the following kept returning: \nFailed to get gzip:/var/lib/apt/lists/partial/archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_precise_main_binary-i386_Packages  Verification code hash doesn't match.\n\n    E: Some archives index failed at being downloaded.

So I'll mark the below answer as accepted.\n\nA: \nWhat should I do to fix this??\n\nsudo dpkg --remove firefox-globalmenu is all that should be needed to allow you to install/remove/modify software again, whether from the Software Center or with apt-get.\n", "Q: Java installation problem I cannot install java on my ubuntu 12.04:\n    zero@ghostrider:~$ sudo apt-get purge openjdk*\n[sudo] password for zero: \nReading package lists...

Most Busybox questions are related to the fact that users are dropped to a Busybox shell due to some unknown issues at boot time. This must make Busybox one of the most hated pieces of software.\nMy problem is the opposite. I want to deliberately start Busybox at boot time either from GRUB, or even before GRUB. Is this possible? How can I do it? The purpose is to execute some commands before the boot sequence is reinitiated. So basically I want to execute some commands to make some hardware available to the bootloader.\n\nA: You will need to make a custom initrd.\nExtract an initrd, note I use ~/initrd as a working directory\ncp /boot/initrd_your_version ~\ncd ~/initrd\ngzip -dc ../initrd_your_version | cpio -imvd --no-absolute-filenames\n\nYou did not mention what you wanted to do, so I can only give general advice here.\nNow, add any libs and/or binaries you need into the ~/initrd .

But boot problem can be  caused by your Windows filesystem being corrupt.  First check your Windows disk by following the directions here\nThen tyro to boot into Ubuntu.\nIf that doesn't work here is how to try to get booted into Ubuntu and Install the drivers for your Radeon card.\nOn the boot screen, highlight Ubuntu and then press f8, it should give you several options.  The one most likely to work is \"nomodeset\"  If this works, Ubuntu will boot into low graphics mode.  If it boots, press your Windows(super) key and the type driver, the program \"Additional Drivers\" will come up, click on it with your mouse to open it.  It should automatically search for proprietary driver and hopefully find the one needed for you AMD Radeon card.  If it does install the version listed as \"stable\" first and try to reboot.  If the drivers work, you will boot into Ubuntu, if it doesn't repeat the \"nomodeset\" booting  process., UNINSTALL THE PROPRIETY DRIVERS YOU INSTALLED FIRST.  Then reboot with \"nomodeset\" and try again with one of the other drivers. \n", "Q: How do you enable multi-touch for lubuntu 12.04 on my HP MINI trackpad?

I don't need iptables on my computer, since I'm behind a NAT Server and a router. I, therefore, flushed all the rules I had left to disactivate the firewall. I wonder if I could probably prevent iptables from starting on boot as well. My first trial was do blacklist all modules related to it on /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf, which were all together ip6table_filter, ip6_tables, ip6table_filter, iptable_filter, ip_tables, iptable_filter and x_tables. But it did not worked out.   My question is how can I avoid iptables to get loaded at startup? \n\nA: Flushing iptables rules / accept everything\nYou may skip this step since you mentioned in your question that you have flushed all the rules.\niptables -X &&\niptables -t nat -F\niptables -t nat -X\niptables -t mangle -F\niptables -t mangle -X\niptables -P INPUT ACCEPT\niptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT\niptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT\n\nAfter flushing your iptables rules.\nRun:\n\n\n*\n\n*iptables-save > save-file\n\n*iptables-apply save-file\n\nA: If You are determined to get clear of iptables:\nsudo modprobe -r ip6_tables iptable_filter ip_tables\n\ncould do the trick for you...\nOf course, If You're satisfied with result it could be made permanent...\n\nA: If that can help, for those which blacklist.conf doesn't work, you can easily disable a module this way:\nAdd this line to your favorite contrab user\n@reboot sudo rmmod iptable_nat\n\n\nA: \nMy first trial was do blacklist all modules related to it on /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf, which were all together ip6table_filter, ip6_tables, ip6table_filter, iptable_filter, ip_tables, iptable_filter and x_tables.\n\nWell, if you have no rules and the firewall is disabled, those modules aren't going to be loaded anyway.\n\nMy question is how can I avoid iptables to get loaded at startup? \n\nStrictly speaking, iptables is a utility for managing the firewall functionality (aka netfilter) built into the Linux kernel. So your question turns into how do I remove firewall functionality from the kernel?\nThe answer to that is...build your own kernel, after configuring it appropriately.\n\nA: Ubuntu does not come with firewall enabled by default. However, it does come ufw package/service, which is the default firewall program, as far as I know it is not active by default. You could check if the service is active with rcconf, you need to install the package\n\nsudo apt-get install rcconf dialog\n\nYou will need dialog to run rcconf even though it is not marked as a dependency.\nMore information on ufw here: https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/firewall.html\nThere are other firewall packages, I don't know them all, but you could do a \napt-cache search firewall | less\nAnd see if there are some that sounds you familiar, for a service or package installed. \nOther ones I've seen in some installations are: \n\n\n*\n\n*firestarter\n\n*fail2ban\n", "Q: Blank screen when booting from USB drive Here is what I have done:\n\n\n*\n\n*I downloaded the iso \"ubuntu-12.04-desktop-amd64\"\n\n*I used Universal-USB-Installer-1.9.0.0 to make a bootable USB drive.\n\n*I restarted PC and changed the boot option to USB HDD.\n\n*I got a menu to:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from USB  \n\n*Install to hard drive  \n\n*Help  \n\n*etc  \n\n\n*When I click Boot from USB or Install to hard drive, loads of text flies past and then I get a blank screen and I can't see anything.\nWhat can I do so I can see the installation screen? I'm using a dual monitor setup from my GFX card and my main display is on my HDMI port to my TV.\n\nA: I recommend you use 1 monitor untill you have completely installed Ubuntu, secondly I would need more details about your computer but you should be disabling UEFI boot from the USB and try to run it legacy mode. Please give as much information as possible, thank you.\n\nA: This could be the result of a corrupted .iso image, or a bad write.\n\n\n*\n\n*To check if the .iso image you downloaded is corrupted, MD5 test it.\n\n*To check if the write to the USB flash drive is corrupted (or otherwise not working), verify the installation media. (This says \"Check disc for defects\" but it applies equally to a USB flash drive.)\nThis could, alternatively, be the result of video compatibility problems.\n\n\n*\n\n*If that is happening, then as ObsessiveFOSS commented, setting the nomodeset boot option may help.\n\n\nIf none of these suggestions help, then you should edit your question to described what happened when you tried them, and also to add the exact make and model of your computer to the question.\n\nA: Try to create the bootable USB with UNetbootin\nI also had problems with Universal-USB-Installer.\n\nA: I've had this issue for a long time, now i believe i have the answer. \nJust go to your BIOS, and make sure that SATA mode is on IDE.

We created a new partition for Ubuntu during installation using the partition editor that comes up during installation. \nEverything seems to have gone fine with the installation except that, unexpectedly, there is no option to boot up Ubuntu when the computer is started. We just start the computer and Windows starts up with no option to ever start Ubuntu. \nThe only way we have gotten Ubuntu to start is by putting the USB stick used for installation back into the computer and having the computer boot from it. Then GRUB shows up and the Ubuntu OS that we installed starts up (rather than the live-CD version on the USB stick).\nPrevious times we have installed Ubuntu, GRUB shows up when we start the computer and we can choose among the various OSes installed. \nCan anyone suggest what to do? We want to have the option to launch either Windows 7 or Ubuntu 12.04 when we start the computer, with the default being Windows 7. Right now there is no option and Windows 7 just starts the way it did before we installed Ubuntu.\nNote that if we hit F1 soon after starting the computer, we get some sort of Windows bootloader (not sure of exact name) but there is no option for Ubuntu; just Windows 7. Also note that if we hit the shift key soon after starting the computer, as some help pages have suggested, nothing happens (Windows 7 is loaded as usual).\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Boot into ubuntu with your usb-stick and then bring up a terminal window and run:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\n(Assuming your boot device is /dev/sda, of course -- substitute this with a different device name if your boot disk isn't sda.)\nThen, to build the menu for booting, run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nBefore doing any of this, make sure that you have a way to boot into Windows from a USB disk, in case something screws up.\n\nA: Sounds like their is no functioning grub installed. You should try re-installing grub from the live-cd, info on how to do this can be found on the Ubuntu help page. Using one of the following two methods:\nUsing Boot Repair\nFor more info look here.\n\n*\n\n*In a terminal run:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\nboot-repair\n\n\n*Then try \"Recommended repair\" button. When repair is finished, note the URL that appeared on a paper, then reboot and check if you recovered access to your OSs.\nIf the repair did not succeed, indicate the URL to people who help you by email or forum.\nhere\nManually Re-Install Grub\nTaken from Ubuntu help page:\nThis is a quick and simple method of restoring a broken system's GRUB 2 files from a LiveCD terminal. The user must know the device name/partition of the installed system (sda1, sdb5, etc), which is then mounted from the LiveCD. GRUB 2 files are copied from the LiveCD libraries to the proper locations and MBR.\nThis operation will write to the MBR and restore the modules and core.img to /boot/grub. It will not replace or restore grub.cfg or fix corrupted files. Boot the LiveCD, select \"Try It\", and open a terminal.\nWhen using a LiveCD, due to GRUB 2 changes between Ubuntu releases, it is recommended that the user boots a LiveCD of the same release (11.10, 12.04, etc) as the release to be repaired. If the user has installed a different version of GRUB 2, use a LiveCD with the same GRUB 2 version.\nIf necessary, use the fdisk command to help determine the partition on which Ubuntu is installed. The fdisk option \"-l\" is a lowercase \"L\". Look for one of the appropriate size or formatting. Running sudo blkid may provide more information to help locate the proper partition, especially if the partitions are labeled.\nsudo fdisk -l\nsudo blkid\n\nIn the following commands:\n\n*\n\n*Use the partition number of the Ubuntu installation with mount command.\n\n\n*Do not use the partition number with the grub-install command.\n\n\n*X is the drive letter (a, b, c, etc.); Y is the partition number (1, 5, etc).\n\n\n*--boot-directory is the folder in which the GRUB folder is located. This is normally /boot but should be changed if the grub folder is located elsewhere.\n\n\n*On systems with a separate /boot partition, that partition should be mounted to /mnt/boot. For instance: sudo mount /dev/sda6 /mnt/boot\n\n\n*grub-install will restore missing files in the grub folder but will not restore intentionally deleted or corrupted files. To accomplish these tasks GRUB 2 must be completely removed and reinstalled.\n sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt # Example: sudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt\nsudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sdX # Example: sudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sda\n\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Webpages not loading in 12.04 after upgrading to ubuntu 12.04 lts browser (firefox, chrome) does not load webpages. \nConnection to the network works and also to the internet (skype is working)\nSoftware installaion via sudo apt-get fails ( -5 hostname association ...)\n\nA: This could be to do with your DNS settings.

Grub boots between Windows 8 and Ubuntu; for which I use primarily. Recently, I decided to remove Ubuntu, as I hardly used it. I deleted the Ubuntu partition accidentally before replacing the Grub bootloader. Now, whenever I want to boot the machine, it gives me the \"grub-rescue\" prompt -- I am unable to boot into either Windows (8 nor 7), nor Ubuntu (except via USB, of course). I do not have any Windows 7/8 recovery media, so that isn't an option. Please note that after I deleted the Ubuntu partition, I put the PC into hibernate, and then turned it on. This means the C:\\ [Windows 8] drive cannot be mounted. I don't know if that is bad, but it definitely doesn't make things better.\nI am currently booting Ubuntu via USB, in an effort to restore the Windows bootloader. I have looked into using boot-repair to solve the problem using the instructions here, although after attempting to apply the changes, it gave the error: \"Please install the [mbr] packages. Then try again.\" I don't know why I'm getting this error; is there a way to install the 'mbr packages?' I honestly don't know what exactly they are, nor how to install them. Are there any other options I have not yet exhausted to be able to boot back into Windows, in the case that there is a better way? I want to set the bootloader to boot into Windows 8, but booting into either Windows 7 or 8 is fine (I can use EasyBCD from there). Is there a simple solution to this? I've checked BIOS, and I haven't been able to find a way to boot into Windows.\n\nA: You can install a Microsoft style MBR from an Ubuntu LiveCD/USB. To do so, run \nsudo software-properties-gtk -e universe && sudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get install mbr\nsudo install-mbr /dev/sdX\n\nwhere \"sdX\" is the device node for your hard drive, like \"sda\", not a partition like \"sda1\". \nIf you really want to use boot-repair to do this then simply run everything except the last command\nsudo install-mbr /dev/sdX\n\nThe commands before that one will just install the mbr package. Then try boot-repair again.\n\nA: This is a Windows Recovery CD from Neosmart.net\nfrom the site:\n\nWhat it does: The Windows 7 Recovery Disc can be used to access a system recovery menu, giving you options of using an antivirus, System Restore, Complete PC Backup, automated system repair, and a command-line prompt for manual advanced recovery.\nWhat it doesn’t do: You cannot use the Windows 7 Recovery Disc to re-install Windows – it only fixes (not replaces!) Windows.\nWhy you need it: If you bought your PC from a major retailer, you didn’t get this CD with your hefty purchase.\n\n\nA: Read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreUbuntu/XP/Vista/7Bootloader\nDo not execute \"sudo install-mbr /dev/sdX\" onto the MBR of a HDD which contains Windows VISTA, 7 and 8.

(●'◡'●)\n", "Q: Can you use an SD card for swap in Ubuntu 12.04? I had a smallish (4gb) SD card laying around and I was wondering if it's possible or advisable to use it as swap space. Ideally, I'd like to free up some hard drive space by removing the swap on it and solely using the SD card but if that's not possible/advisable I'd be just fine with having a little extra. \n\nA: All the stuff that can't or shouldn't stay in your RAM is written out to swap and read back in when needed. This means that the swap medium needs to be fast and resilient to lots of writes. \nYour SD card fails on both counts. It is slower at reading/writing than a hard drive, and each of its constituent sectors can only be written to a limited number of times before they wear out and can no longer reliably store data. \nIf you really want to use it to free hard drive space and will be keeping it in your reader at all times, my recommendation would be to consider moving any media files you might have to the card. Media files are usually written once but read many times, and don't need the full transfer speed of a hard drive to play back smoothly in real-time. They are thus the perfect candidates to offload to an SD card. \n\nA: It does actually help a little if you are getting I/O bottlenecks when swapping since its on a separate device from the hard drive you are running your system on. Although it will drastically reduce the life of your SD card.\n", "Q: Kubuntu Problem when Installing - metalink unable to download therefore ISO \nPossible Duplicate:\nWubi fails to install Kubuntu: “cannot download metalink…” \n\nI installed ubuntu with no errors, when I try to install Kubuntu using wubi.exe\nI get this:\n    An error occured:\nCannot download the metalink therefore the ISO\n\nFor more information please see the log file:\nc:\\users\\dell\\appdata\\local\\temp\\wubi-12.04-rev265.log\n\nAny suggestions on how to fix this problem?\n\nA: This could be a bug.

What can disable it?? How can I enable this standard feature? I'm using Ubuntu 11.10\n\nA: Ubuntu uses the Unity interface on top of Gnome 3 by default.\nWhether you are using Unity or you have switched to gnome-shell, the launcher icons on your old gnome-panel have now been replaced by icons on a panel along the left hand side, known as the \"launcher\".\nYou can drag application icons onto there from within the dock (ie, searching for an application, then dragging the found icon onto the left panel).  In addition, launchers you had on your panel back in Gnome 2 should have been migrated to Unity's new launcher if you had set them up manually.\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to add application launcher icons to the top panel, nor is it possible to change the position or appearance of the launcher panel that appears on the left (or, at least, not much).\nIf you don't like the Unity interface, there are others.  I would encourage you to get used to it, because it should be well-supported by Ubuntu people.  However, 11.10 allows you to install the gnome-session-fallback package, which gives you an alternative login option that allows you to have the old gnome-panel back.\nThese similar solutions may help \n\nA: You need to hold ALT and then right click to add applets to the panel.

But, pinning the application to the launcher and then loading the program will allow the icon to be on the switcher.\nHere is my question: Should I report this bug to Unity or to Gimp/TuxGuitar?\n\nA: This happens with multiple applications; the common factor is the Unity launcher. Therefore, as aking1012 commented, you should report this against unity with ubuntu-bug unity.

I just installed Ubuntu and one of the 1st things that I did was - remove my password. I went into settings -> user accounts, clicked on the unlock icon and changed the password to nothing, made it so it doesn't require me to log in, but yet, when I try to install some software I get prompted to type in my password. I tried using nothing and my old password - neither of them work.\nWhat should I do to fix this? Do I really have to re-install Ubuntu?\n\nA: You will need to add a password to your account again.\nYou can do it using the same steps that you did to remove it, or from a terminal.\npasswd\n\nSorry, but Ubuntu doesn't support well blank passwords (it does, the LiveCD runs with it, but usually the system will expect a password). Ubuntu security is higher than windows (is not only about user-root separation) and sometime this means it is less convenient. This is a design decision, a trade-off that you can like or not, but one that you must accept if you want to use Ubuntu, this philosophy is so ingrained in the system, that there are lots of places that expect it that way.\nAll that said, you can enable autologin, but it's not near as convenient as Windows i.e., as soon as you want to connect to a protected wireless network you will be asked for your password , because by default, wireless passwords are encrypted with your login password.\ntl;dr: Ubuntu expects an user with a password. You can run it without it, but you will find some problems.\n\nA: You can change the password back through recovery mode.\nPress and hold Shift right after the BIOS screen on your computer disappears to make the GRUB menu come up.\nFrom this menu select one of the entries like this:\nUbuntu, kernel 2.6.17-10-generic (recovery mode)\nFrom here the system will boot, and you should choose 'Drop to root shell prompt' from the recovery menu.\nYou can now run sudo passwd <USER> where <USER> is the username to set a valid password.

I changed permissions via chmod. chmod u+rx /etc/resolv.conf But nothing changed. I am still unable to write into resolv.conf file. What should I do?\n\nA: From vim documentation:\nIf you make changes to a file and forgot that it was read-only, you can\nstill write it.  Add the ! to the write command to force writing.\nIf you really want to forbid making changes in a file, do this:\nvim -M file\n\nNow every attempt to change the text will fail.

I have an annoying problem. Every time i want to enter a mail adress in evolution, it adds a \",\" when pressing alt (needed to type \"@\").\nSo, when i want to send a mail to info@ubuntu.com, it gives me: info, @ubuntu.com which of course does not work. I can adjust it manually though but it keeps being annoying\n\nA: This is a known bug. It could be, or not, HUD related (*). You can try to disable or change the shortcut key to open the HUD to something different from ALT, see here. If it works please report back here and in the bug report, if it doesn't feel free to downvote this answer.\nOne possible (but highly speculative) explanation is that evolution is programmed so that it adds a comma to the field when it lost focus (to ease adding more addresses). When you hit ALT, the HUD gets focus and Evolution inserts a comma.\n", "Q: Mark a deb package as used, so it's not suggested for autoremoval I have a bunch of shared libs installed on my system which aren't dependencies of some concrete package but are needed for non-apt-managed libraries I've built from source (like latest SDL, Allegro, SFML, ...) and other software built from source. The problem is that those libraries are seen by APT as unused, and are therefore candidates for auto-removal, and those get mixed up with legitimate unused packages that are free to remove.\nIs there a way to mark packages as used so that they are not suggested for auto-removal? My first thought was to build my own metapackage just to hold the dependencies (like for example ubuntu-desktop is), but I don't know how to do that.\n\nA: Although apt-get install marks packages as installed too, it does other things like upgrading packages (if there is an upgrade available). The correct program to change the automatically-installed states is apt-mark.\nUsage\nMarking a package as manually installed (such that it won't be removed by apt-get autoremove):\nsudo apt-mark manual package1 package2 ... packageN\n\nTo mark a package as automatically installed (such that it will be removed by apt-get autoremove if no packages depend on it):\nsudo apt-mark auto package1 package2 ... packageN\n\nMore details are available in the manual page apt-mark(8).\n\nA: Just use apt-get install:\nsudo apt-get install [your-packages]\n\nIt won't actually install them.

I'm a little confused as to whether I should install Ubuntu on its own partition on my hard drive, use VirtualBox or another virtualization package to install it, or use Wubi to install it directly on top of my current OS (Win 7). I definitely want to learn and use Ubuntu, so this is not just for playing around with it. \nAlso, if I choose to partition, should I partition the hard drive myself or should I let the Ubuntu installation menu do it for me? I understand that I am going to need a main partition, for Ubuntu's core components, and also a swap partition. Then there is the option to add a partition for \"home\"- I don't understand what combination of these partitioning options I should choose, or whether it is better to partition in Windows before I install Ubuntu or just partition my hard drive when I install Ubuntu itself\n\nA: If you are starting with Linux and you would like to give it a go then VirtualBox is the best option:\nPros:\n\n\n*\n\n*No modifications to your system;\n\n*No harm done if something goes wrong and you mess up Ubuntu completely;\n\n*Ability to create snapshots and restore them on the fly, ie: Create a snapshot before issuing a weird command that you are not sure about, if something goes wrong you can restore the snapshot and continue with your life;\n\n*Mappings can be done so that the file from your Windows system are shared with Ubuntu without the worry of mounting file systems, its easy pie;\n\n*If you find that you do not like Ubuntu and you want to remove it from your system you can simply remove VirtualBox and delete the virtual machine files and your system will be back to were it was, no harm done.\n\n*No partitioning mistakes! The disk Ubuntu is going to install to is just a file inside your Windows system, delete the file, Ubuntu is out and you can start over.\n\n*\n\n*Create as much partitions as you like;\n\n*Play with mount points as you desire;\n\n*When in doubt go back and re-do it as you like\n\n*No harm done to your Windows installation\nCons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Not as a fast as a live installation, still bearable and great to try and use;\n\n*Eye candy supplied from accelerated graphics is not present or is not as fast as it could be, depending on the system. It will still look imba, but not the same.\n\n\nThe 2 points that would make it a bad choice to install it in a virtual computer do not overcome the pro points, just the simplicity of it should be the main reason to use Ubuntu in VirtualBox if you are using it for the first time.\nLater, when you are confident that you want to use it and you are ready to do a real installation you will have all the steps covered and you will feel confident on what to do.\n\nOther best options are:\n\nWubi\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu is installed in a file in a Windows directory (normally c:\\ubuntu\\root), GRUB will replace your Windows boot manager and will let you choose between booting Windows or the Ubuntu system inside that file;\n\n*Its a good option because you are actually booting to Ubuntu directly\n\n*It makes partitioning easy since everything is done to the file keeping Ubuntu, not really modifies your hard disk partitions\n\n*Its bad because if GRUB for any reason gets messed up you will need to go trough some work to restore it, not hard, but for a newbie nothing is simple.\n\n\n\nWindows partition resize\n\n\n*\n\n*Resize your Windows partition using the Ubuntu LiveCD or the Ubuntu installer and install Ubuntu in to its rightful place!\n\n*It allows your to keep Windows and Ubuntu on the same computer, allows you to fully play with partitioning and choose mounting points directly in your hard disk space\n\n*Installs GRUB to manage the dual boot between Ubuntu and Windows;\n\n*Its bad because it installs GRUB and for the same reasons as a Wubi install, if GRUB gets broken you need to fix it. Also resizing can be dangerous (normally is not), make a backup before you do it. Careful so you don't accidentally overwrite any Windows data!\n\n*Can be a problem if you somehow destroy Ubuntu or mess up your Windows system from Ubuntu and then you can't boot anymore.\n\n\n\nOther options\nLiveCD booting\nJust download and burn the Ubuntu CD from the downloads site, boot from it and use it as a LiveCD. It will be slow because it is using the CD as the system but it wont harm your system or require installation. Once you reboot everything that was not saved in to your Windows disk or a removable media will be lost.\nInstall to a USB drive\nMost systems now a days allow you to boot from a USB drive. You can install Ubuntu to a USB drive and use it as a spare. GRUB will be installed to the USB drive, it will be a real system and act like one.\nGood thing about this is that you do not modify your Windows install.\nBad thing is you need to select the USB drive each time your need to boot in to Ubuntu, or you need to modify GRUB to recognize Windows and give you the option to boot to it.\nThis is a good option if you have a spare USB drive around and your system allows you to boot from USB.\n\nFor a newbie it is always better to have it installed in a way that what ever happens your previous system is safe and that no big changes are done. For the moment stick with a VirtualBox install and when you are more confident move on to the next step. Better a slow start that a fast and disastrous one.\n\nA: Virtualbox:\nUbuntu will run inside your existing Windows operating system.  You'll be able to simultaneously run Ubuntu while using other Windows applications.  However, Ubuntu will run quite slowly, in its own box (which albeit can still be maximised) and it won't be representative of an actual Ubuntu installation - not making full use of your hardware.  It will be frustratingly limited, IMHO, if you want a full desktop experience.  It may, however, be useful if you want to use Windows as your primary operating system but you need to run one specific Linux program, or a Linux server, for testing purposes.\nOwn partition:\nUbuntu will run natively on your machine, separately from Windows.  You won't be able to run the two simultaneously, but you can choose which one to run when you boot.  This is a good option if you want to get a full desktop experience, as long as you are able to resize some existing partitions to make space and you are reasonably confident in doing so (that is, you won't trash your existing partitions, and you are good with backups).  If you are thinking of moving to Ubuntu permanently in the future, this is the only option of the three that will let you do that smoothly, since you will be able to remove or shrink your Windows partition later without affecting Ubuntu.\nWubi:\nOnce installed, this is fairly functionally the same as running Ubuntu in its own partition: you won't be able to run Ubuntu and Windows simultaneously, Ubuntu will have full access to your hardware and you get to choose Ubuntu or Windows when you boot.  This option, however, is for when you don't want the permanence of re-sizing any existing partitions.  It is good for if you want to try Ubuntu temporarily without changing any partitions.  The trick here is that special magic allows you to create the Ubuntu partition as a virtual partition inside your existing Windows partition, rather than creating a real, on-disk partition.  Ubuntu will see it as its own partition though, and Windows will see it as a normal file.  You won't be able to delete your Windows partition though, which is why I said it's good if your use of Ubuntu is temporary.  It is plausible that disk access might be slightly slower using this method than having Ubuntu in its own partition, but this may not be noticeable and in all other ways Ubuntu will run just as fast.\n\nAlso, if I choose to partition, should I partition the hard drive myself or should I let the Ubuntu installation menu do it for me?\n\nThis in itself is a rather broad question and ten different people will have ten different opinions on this.  In my opinion you may as well let Ubuntu choose its own partitioning.  This will result in small partition for swap and a larger one for everything else.  Some say it's worth having a separate /home partition.  You can do this if you like, though if you don't know you need it, though, you probably don't really need it.  The benefits of a separate /home to some people is that they can trash everything but keep the /home partition, so their files remain, when they want to do a clean reinstall.  Of course, if you have backups of your files, then you could choose to restore from backups instead.\n\nA: I think the best and easiest way to test Ubuntu is to take the tour. You can test Ubuntu in your web browser, fast and easy. \n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu online tour\nIf you still want more and don't want to install it, try it via a Live-CD. Then you will know what it's like to use on your computer. \n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04 download site\nI would suggest to download the Desktop 32-bit, it's the most likely to work without any issue. Also download Unetbootin and install the live cd on a Usb-stick. \n\nA: As suggested by neon_overload, installing using VirtualBox/VMware won't be as fast as a regular installation.\nHowever, I suggest that you do use a virtual environment at first, if this is your first experience with Linux. Why? Because you can easily keep your computer clean (no partition, installations, boot screen with double entry, etc...). After you are confident with it, install it completely.\n\nA: Looking at your need (long term use) I suggest you should install Ubuntu separately in a new partition instead of using Wubi (or Vbox).\nAlso, about your question about partitioning, I would always suggest you to partition it manually (Provided that you know how to do it) (I can help you with that too if needed)\nIt's always good to keep your Ubuntu apart from Windows (which is terribly unstable and you would not like to lose anything of Ubuntu in the Format Windows things that happen mostly.)\n\nA: If you want to start the migration to ubuntu, as i understand it, i would recommend the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*install ubuntu using 3 partitions (root, swap, home) alongside your existing windows installation (dual boot). This is by far the fastest and least errorprone approach. for that you have to choose manual partitioning and\n\n*\n\n*shrink your windows partition (no data will be lost, but please do make a backup of all your data first)\n\n*create a root partition, 20GB should be enough, but if you have a large enough harddisk i would recommend 40-60GB.\n\n*swap partition about 2x the size of your ram\n\n*/home parition for all your files. Having /home on a separate partition will prove very handy: if you want to reinstall later, you can just overwrite your root partition and all your settings and files will remain intact!\n\n\n*sometimes you will need access to a windows system. For that you can reboot into windows, or you can install a virtual windows (virtualbox or vmware). I use both: dualboot windows 7 for running windows games, virtualized windows xp from ubuntu for running special applications. \n\n*also, don't forget that many applications run perfectly well under wine, directly inside ubuntu!\n\n\nA: My recommendation is that you use Wubi to install it alongside windows. It will install Ubuntu in a big file on the Windows partition (no partitioning necessary, only about 32GB space on the windows drive) and you can choose the OS to boot in the Windows bootloader at system startup. Later if you don't like it you can even painlessly uninstall it via Add/Remove programs directly from windows  (which cannot be said for a real install described below).\nA VirtualBox install would install it as a virtual machine inside your Windows 7, so it has no benefits over using Wubi other than being able to use Windows in parallel, which you won't need anyway.\nDoing a real install alongside windows would be the second choice, but if you are unfamiliar with things like disk partitioning, MBR, bootloaders, primary/logical partitions, etc. then I wouldn't recommend it until you get the feel for linux and familiarize your self with the boot process, bootloaders and partitioning. \n", "Q: How to uninstall the following?

I have a pair of .idx/.sub subtitle files with multiple languages and I need to convert them to single-language .srt files because neither Totem nor Gnome Mplayer can show that type of subtitles.\n\nA: The Avidemux way is very handy.\nVery good tutorial here: http://write.flossmanuals.net/avidemux/extract-dvd-subtitles/\nWorks very good for me, if you have more questions, please ask\n\nA: idx/sub are called VobSub file and are bitmap images + timecode that are overlay on top of the video during playback.\nA srt file is a simple text file with timecode that is then render on the video.\nThis means that to be able to convert them to text string you need to do some OCR, Optical character recognition. Sadly, most OCR solutions don't support idx/sub.\nAt this point, the best solution I have for you is called SubRip (see also official site) and it's Windows software only. It tends to run well in Wine, so you should be able to use it in Ubuntu (without Windows). You can also use Avidemux according to this guide.\nBoth will present you the bitmap image from the idx/sub, you type what you see and it will build the corresponding srt file. Doom9 has a nice guide for SubRip.\nYou can also burn in the subtitle to the video file, Handbrake will be able to do that.\nFrom there, Doom9 and VideoHelp are going to be more helpful than AskUbuntu.\n\nA: According to http://www.afterdawn.com/guides/archive/convert_subtitles_from_sub-idx_to_srt.cfm you can use a program called SubResync, part of the VobSub package (Windows).\nI tried it with one movie and found that \"teaching\" the OCR all the slightly different shapes of the letters is pretty time-consuming, and if you make a mistake, you can't correct it! So I would only use this method if (a) the subtitles are really important and it's worth spending the time, or (b) the subtitles are in a simple, consistent font and a given letter looks exactly the same every time it appears.\n", "Q: Upgrade or replace a Wubi installation? I've got Windows 7 with Wubi 11.10 installed. I would like to upgrade to 12.04 but I'm not sure what the best path would be.\nI'm not skilled enough to use Ubuntu all the time, and my iPhone requires me to run some Windows version for the damn iTunes software. I would love to run Windows XP but I can't figure out how to install it via USB -- my computer has no cd drive.\nI'd like to run Windows XP and Wubi 12.04 on top of that. Or, perhaps, Ubuntu 12.04 natively and Windows XP alongside of that. So I guess I have 2 questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*(lazy) Should I upgrade my Wubi from inside Ubuntu, or should I remove Wubi 11.10 from within Windows and install a brand new Wubi 12.04?\n\n*(proper) How can I install Windows XP and Ubuntu 12.04 alongside each other?\nUpdate: I am going to create a separate question post about the above #2 question... I realize it's wrong to ask two questions in one post when they are that different.\n\nA: I would not normally link to a page that was not an ubuntu wiki or information source as they often go missing.\nHowever this is by the user on the forum who deals with an enormous amount of wubi threads.\nhttp://ubuntu-with-wubi.blogspot.ca/2012/04/how-to-upgrade-wubi-install.html\nSummary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wait a while for latest fixes to exist.\n\n*Do a backup.\n\n*Do a full backup.\n\n*Really. Do a complete backup!!\n\n*Ensure there's at least 3GB free space. Even more is even better.\n\n*Consider removing any PPA's first (reinstall them later).\n\n*Let Ubuntu upgrade itself.\n\n\nThis usually works. You did make a backup, right?\n\nA: \nShould I upgrade my Wubi from inside Ubuntu, or should I remove Wubi 11.10 from within Windows and install a brand new Wubi 12.04?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Fresh WUBI Install is recommended... if you haven't used 11.10 a lot and don't really have programs/settings you can't easily recreate, just backup your home directory to a USB, uninstall the old and install the new 12.04.\n\n*Update from 11.10 will also work... but may be a problem if your Wubi drive is small (4-6 GB or so).\n\nA: I would suggest you to uninstall WUBI from  Windows and do a clean install of Ubuntu. This will be least buggy.\n", "Q: How can I have sound output before logging in? I have a machine (Ubuntu 11.10) that I would like to have it play audio (typically through an amplifier), but the machine should be headless (where its final placement will be). I will control what is played through ssh.\nHowever, there is no sound output until I login to the graphical console. At first I thought it was an issue with pulseaudio, so I promptly removed it to use the default ALSA, but I have the same issues. I ssh to the machine, I run alsamixer and get the typical cannot open mixer: No such file or directory error (while /proc/asound/cards display correctly what I have). If I login on the graphical console, alsamixer works fine in the ssh session, and I have sound output. I logout, and then alsamixer stops working. So something runs (Xsession perhaps?) when I login that enables sound output, and gets disabled when I logout.\nI remember in older versions of Ubuntu, there was a drum roll when the machine showed the login screen; that is not the case anymore. Perhaps if I somehow can enable that drum roll, I'll have fixed my problem too.\nIn any case, the question I ask is what the title says.\nUPDATE: issue still unsolved. I just wanted to note the information that sound is configured correctly and enabled whether I log in to a Gnome or a XFCE environment, and de-configured and disabled when I log out.\n\nA: Well, I found the answer when I attempted to run alsamixer et al. under sudo (in which case, they run). I had to add the remotely-connecting user to group audio (which had only user pulse from the previous pulseaudio installation).\nIt really would be more helpful if the various ALSA tools reported something EPERM/EACCES related instead of ENODEV/ENOENT.\n", "Q: How to delete kernel entries in the Grub 2 menu whose kernels are removed?

I would like to install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 on a HP G62 Notebook. Although I have installed  Ubuntu in a dual-boot many times before, I found out that this model has already four partitions.\n\nPartitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*SYSTEM (NTFS, 199MB, used 66.59MB)\n\n*Partition without any tag: NTFS (579GM, used 129GB) \n\n*RECOVERY (NTFS 16.74 GB, used 2.42GB) \n\n*HP_TOOLS (FAT32, 103.34 MB, used 13.23MB)\n\n\nSince I am not an expert with partitions I would like to get advice on how to do this.\nMy first idea is this one:\n\n\n*\n\n*Free some space from /dev/sda2 (I don't know if could also free some other space)\n\n*delete the HP_Tools partition (I have already created a backup)\n\n*create an extended partition with the free space in #1 containing three parititions: swap (1gb); / (EXT4, 30GB);  /home (EXT4, 120GB)\n\n\nAnother option is to use wubi instead.\nWhat do you think? Is there any other way to achieve this?\nPS: I really think this HP policy of using 4 partitions is not a coincidence\nPS: I tried using gparted from the live CD and I got a warning message saying that if I freed some space from /dev/sda2 I could create serious issues in the system\n\nA: The 4-partition limit no longer exists with disks that use the GUID Partition Table (GPT). GPT supports up to 128 partitions by default and does not include the concepts of primary, extended, or logical partitions (although many tools refer to all GPT partitions as \"primary partitions,\" simply because those tools were written with the older MBR system in mind).\nIntel-based Macs, the vast majority of computers that shipped with Windows 8, and some computers that shipped with Windows 7 (particularly beginning in mid-2011) all use GPT. Most PCs sold before mid-2011 use the older Master Boot Record (MBR) system, which is limited to four primary partitions, one of which may be an extended partition that can hold an arbitrary number of logical partitions. Thus, increasing numbers of readers of this question are likely to find that there is no problem; if the disk is partitioned using GPT, the 4-partition limit simply doesn't exist.\n\nA: My sister and I have HP laptops that are set up the same way. Here's how I did it for both of us with a dual-boot Ubuntu and Windows 7 system:\nStep 1. Delete HP_TOOLS since its small and can easily be recreated on USB/DVD\nThe easiest solution is to delete the HP_TOOLS partition, since it's usually only 100 MB or so and it can be easily recreated on a USB flash drive if/when you need it. Or you could back it up to DVD before deleting it.\n\n*\n\n*This approach is approved by HP Support, and you can download the HP_TOOLS installer for a USB flash drive from here\nStep 2. Shrink the Windows C drive, and use Ubuntu installer LiveCD(or on USB) to create an extended partition there\nOnce you delete that partition, shrink the Windows partition to create free unallocated space for Ubuntu. You can do this from Windows (disk management), or from the Ubuntu LiveCD with gparted (use \"Try Ubuntu...\" when booting).\nAfter that, you can use the Ubuntu Installer to create an extended partition in the freed-space, on which it will put all the Ubuntu (logical) partitions.\n\n\nNote: You can use gparted to try to move the Recovery partition to the right or left to utilize the 100MB or so of space freed by the HP_TOOLS partition, but I don't recommend it unless you are really desperate for that much space, since the move can take quite a bit of time.\n\n\nA: You are thinking correctly I would say.\nAs you have the tools backup I would remove that partition and resize the sda2 partition. All I would do differently is do the resize in windows. Then leave the space as unallocated. Create your extended and logicals in ubuntu livecd.\nThen boot the livecd/usb and install.\nYou can create the necessary partitions either with the installer - choose the Something Else option or use gparted - that is available  on the livecd/usb (if you do that you still need to use the Something Else option os set the / and /home mountpoints)\nWhatever you do end up doing - make sure you have backups - if you lose power during the shrinking of the partition you'll be glad.\n\nA: An extended partition cannot store any data but it can contain multiple subpartitions inside it, or in Windows it is referred to as a logical drive. An extended partition is needed to overcome the limit of MBR disks, which only allow 4 primary partitions to be created.1 As mentioned in other answers GPT is the new standard and is gradually replacing MBR, and a GPT drive can contain up to 128 partitions.\nBy making an extended partition instead of a primary partition on a disk with 4 primary partitions you end up with 3 primary partitions and 1 extended partition. An extended partition can have more than one partition in it including an ntfs partition for storing Windows files. You can install Ubuntu on any of the partitions including the partitions in the extended partition. You can also grow and shrink extended partitions using GParted partition editor.\nChanging the partition type requires changing how exactly the partition is aligned due to how logical partitions work internally. So just changing the partition type from primary to extended (which in fact would be deleting the primary partition, creating an extended partition and then creating the logical partition within the extended partition) would cause you to lose all the data.2 If you want to save the data on a partition please backup the data before changing the partition type from primary to extended. In order to backup all the data on a partition you will need a something like an external hard drive that has enough disk space to store all the data that is being backed up.\nCreating an extended partition\nCreating an extended partition in GParted is done the same way as creating a primary partition.\n\n*\n\n*Select an unallocated space on the disk device.\n\n*Choose:   Partition → New. GParted will open a new Create new Partition window.\n\n*Specify the size and the location for the partition.\n\n*Specify the alignment for the partition.\n\n*Specify the type of partition.\n\n*Specify the name of the partition when the field is enabled.\n\n*Specify the type of file system for the partition.\n\n*Specify the label of the file system for the partition.\n\n*Click the Add button to add the create partition operation to the operation queue. GParted will display the pending create partition operation at the bottom of the GParted window.3\n\n\nNotice the dropdown menu selection in the \"Create As\" box where Extended Partition is selected.  When Extended Partition is selected, all the file types in the menu below will be greyed out. There is no file type associated with an extended partition. An extended partition is basically a container for any number of logical partitions, which can be of any file system format.\n\nThe created extended partition is shown in the above screenshot. You would normally cover the entire remaining free space with this partition unless you intend to install another operating system which requires free space to be installed into. The extended partition is represented by a box in the graphics portion surrounding the remaining free space. The extended partition can be resized to create room for expansion of the existing primary partition or the creation of an additional primary partition(s).\nYou will notice a third partition type option in the \"Create As\" dropdown menu.  This option is to create a logical partition inside of an extended partition.\nWhen you click on a free space, which type of partition that may be created depends on the location of the free space you are selecting. If it is outside of an extended partition, you will only be able to create a primary or an extended partition.  If the free space resides within an extended partition, you will only be allowed to create a logical partition.  Creating a logical partition is otherwise exactly the same as creating a primary partition.\nBelow all the partitions except for one primary NTFS partition (which would normally contain the Windows operating system) have been deleted and replaced with an extended partition covering the rest of the free space. There are a number of logical partitions inside of it to demonstrate how an extended partition works.\n\nNotice that there are the original Linux partitions and 5 more partitions, called logical partitions, of various filesystems within the extended partition that demonstrate how an extended partition works. Note also the order of the list of partitions in the screenshot. Any partition that precedes the extended partition is a primary partition. Those that follow it in the list are logical partitions. You can create any number of logical partitions of any file type and any size within this extended partition.4\nSources: 1 2 3 4 \n\nA: \nNote: This was an answer to another post which had the same scenario but much less detail; I would have answered differently for this post, either way, hope this helps too.\n\nHere's what you need to do.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from  the bootable Ubuntu USB or CD.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Install Ubuntu.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Click Continue.\n\n*Select the ”SOMETHING ELSE” option.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Click Continue.\n\n*The window below will appear. Select the partition (empty or without important data) wherein you want to install Ubuntu. In this example it is shown as free space, in your case, just select the partition you don't need or would like to put Ubuntu into. It doesn't matter if it is an NTFS partition because you can format it to another partition on the next screen. In the Device for boot loader installation, select your hard drive, not a partition.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*After selecting the partition, click on Change. In the “Use as” option select “Ext4 journaling file system” and select mount point as \"/\". Press OK.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on \"Install Now\".\n\n*Reboot and you should see the grub menu prompting you to choose which OS you want to boot into. By default, the last OS installed (Ubuntu) will be the default OS. You can press Enter to boot into Ubuntu or use the up or down arrow to select another OS (windows) to boot.\n\n\nA: I had a HP netbook cq10 and I deleted Recovery and HP_tools without problems. I think HP_tools is required for updating the BIOS but you can always reinstall it onto to a thumb drive (  find the exe at HP.com). Recovery partition I deleted because there are ways of creating a bootable windows USB drive in Ubuntu.\n\nA: Make a recovery disk - this should let you recover the original install if need be. Better yet, if you have the space, image the whole disk with clonezilla.\nFirst, do NOT delete the first and second partitions - the first one is the boot partition, and the second is windows. I would recommend leaving the first partition completely alone\nIf you made a backup disk, it should have the same contents as the third partition. The 4th partition is likely used to boot the third partition. You should be able to remove both these partitions and reorganise the remaining partitions to your liking. I'd recommend a extended partition with logical volumes with the space for maximum flexibility - since you can have as many logical volumes as you want inside a extended partition.\n\nA: I ran into this problem too. \nHP TOOLS and RECOVERY have saved my computer from turning into a brick. Thanks to these partitions, after 6 years my HP Pavilion dm4 is still running fast and smooth. I strongly recommend keeping these. \nObviously SYSTEM and your NTFS partition has what you need for Windows so you can't get rid of those. \nIn the end, you really want to keep all 4! \nSo here's what I did to dual boot Ubuntu alongside Windows 7:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup all my files from Windows.\n\n*Figure out Windows recovery options in case of horrible failure (recovery DVD/recovery image...whatever you use to return to that fresh clean out-of-box state).\n\n*Download Ubuntu 16.04 iso (so a couple years passed, but the problem persists right?) and put it in a bootable USB.\n\n*Prepare to lose my Windows and all my files.\n\n*Boot the USB with Ubuntu but just Try Ubuntu, don't install.\n\n*Unmount partition drives (Click on the drive and choose unmount--otherwise GParted will yell at you).\n\n*Open GParted Partitioner (type gpart... in the finder search).\n\n*Delete my NTFS (C: or untitled) partition. It will become unallocated.\n\n*Create a new Extended partition in the unallocated slot.\n\n*Within the Extended partition, make a new Logical partition aligned to Cylinder instead of MiB and with file system NTFS. This will be my Windows partition. I made this 100GB and left 350GB free space following for Ubuntu.\n\n*Make another Logical partition in the unallocated region following the NTFS I made, all within the Extended partition. Make this ext4 or whatever filesystem. This can be changed later but this will be where I can install Ubuntu after reinstalling Windows.\n\n*Then hit the green check-mark and make these partitions. (If you messed up, just clear all or undo before hitting the check-mark.) Now I've effectively screwed up my Windows partition.\n\n*Shutdown and start up my laptop and I see that Windows fails to load and startup repair keeps coming up. Since my HP TOOLS and RECOVERY are intact (which they should be) I can now perform a Minimized Recovery of Windows. This will install Windows into that NTFS partition within my Extended partition section. Do this and go get some coffee while my laptop reboots several times.\n\n*Now that my have Windows again (yay!) I shut down and grab my bootable USB and install Ubuntu. This time, I can safely Install Alongside Windows into that remaining slot of the Extended partition--and mess around more with partitioning.\n\n\nBest of luck,\nwashifu\nSad Edit: Factory Image Recovery or Minimized Image Recovery after having installed Ubuntu does not work well. I sadly lost both my SYSTEM and HP_TOOLS. However, System Restore seemed to work fine. In the end, since I lost HP_TOOLS, I just made that as my fourth primary partition. Technically RECOVERY is good enough...(weeps softly in a corner)\n\nA: Pardon the brief answer here, I just wanted to say that I have just added a extended partition to my HP g7-1150us that had 4 primary partitions as others have described, without losing anything.  Here is how:\nSince the laptop is limited to 100Mbps network connection, I took the 640GB HD out of the laptop and connected to a SATA port on my linux PC for the process.  You could just use the network connection and boot linux from CD on the laptop instead.\nFirst, I made a full backup image file of the laptop HD using the dd command.\nThen using gparted I shrank the windows OS partition to make room for the new extended partition I want to install.\nThen I made image files of the individual partitions and the MBR also using dd.  I noted the start sector positions of each partition as indicated in gparted.\nThen using gparted, I deleted the small HP_TOOLS partition from the laptop HD.\nThen I created an extended partition using all of the free space with gparted.\nThen I moved the RESTORE partition into the extended partition as a new logical partition all the way to the right within the extended partition using gparted again.\nThen I resized the extended partition until the starting sector of the RESTORE logical position was the same as before.  I am not sure if this was required or not.\nThen I created a fat32 primary partition at the same starting sector that the HP_TOOLS partition was at before I deleted it, using gparted.  Again I am not sure if lining up the starting sector is required for this to work.\nThen I used dd to copy the HP_TOOLS backup image into the newly created fat32 partition.\nI put the HD back into the laptop, checking windows boot, tools boot (F2) and restore boot (F11).  They all worked just fine.  No need for USB or permanently deleting potentially useful factory installed partitions.\nTo summarize, I just moved the RESTORE partition into a new extended partition and everything works.\nWhat remains to be seen, is how GRUB will work with all of this after I install Linux within the extended partition.  I am almost certain that the HP_TOOLS and RESTORE functions will stop working, but at least they are on the disk if needed.  Additionally, in a serious crisis, I have a full image of the factory HD.  Gparted and dd are excellent free tools to use for all of this.\nUPDATE:  Using a graphical Windows BCDeditor from neosmart.net I made Windows in control of the option to boot Linux.  When I installed Ubuntu 12.04 from a USB drive (I used unetbootin to create the USB image from the 12.04 ISO image) I am now able to boot Windows, use F2 for tools, use F11 for restore and boot into Ubuntu.  So if anyone was wondering, yes, it is possible to install Linux alongside Windows 7 on a HP laptop that was factory installed with 4 primary partitions, without losing any of the factory functionality and without having to burn DVD's and without having to keep a USB drive around for emergencies.\nHappy hacking and cheers!\n", "Q: How do I burn a DVD with more than 3.8 GB data? I use Kubuntu 12.04 with KDE 4.8.3 and wodim / genisoimage 1.1.11, but the problem is on Ubuntu (with Brasero) and occurred in Oneiric as well.\nWhenever I try to burn more than 3.8GB (approaching the 4 GB limit) of data onto a DVD, burning fails, aborts, or gives an \"error 254.\"\nI have lost more than 50 DVDs this way until I learned about the 3.8GB limit. Anything under 3.8GB burns fine, and DVDs burned with more than 3.8GB have usable data up to 3.8 GB, but then the remaining data is garbled, unaccessible, or the disk is just not recognized.\nI'm pretty certain this is related to the replacement of cdrecord / mkisofs with wodim /genioimage (which is a problem that has been described for years). Is there another answer or fix? Re-installing cdrtools/cdrecord/mkisofs in Oneiric and Precise has become a herculean task.  \n\nA: This may possibly be a user issue or a 12.04 issue. I just burned a 4.02gb DVD last night on 14.04LTS(ISO, one file), and have several times burned 4+gb general file DVDs using Brasero, and have had no data loss or errors as a result. The only problem I have ever had was trying to use Brasero in writing video files (due to other dependencies related to video time stamps). Brasero gags on time stamps really badly.\nThen again, terminal command line mkisofs is the best way to handle writing video DVDs, anyhow.\njust create a directory called 'junk', with two sub-directories, 'VIDEO_TS' and 'AUDIO_TS', copy your target files into the video_ts folder, then:\nmkisofs -dvd-video -o junkimage.iso junk/\nthis will make you an ISO image of the DVD that you can burn however you want to. If you get errors, check 'askubuntu' for video format errors and PAL vs NTSC format setting, as well as looking up what the significance of the Video Manager Information File has.\nFOLLOW-UP:\nOk, I took an old video DVD, placed it on my harddrive (in DVD .VOB/.IFO structure, with .BUP files too), total size was 7.9-gb on-drive.\nThen, using mkisofs, I followed the generally accepted practice as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Made DVD folder named 'DVD' (HOME/TEMP/DVD)\n\n*Created two sub-directories, VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS (beneath the structure explained in step 1).\n\n*Placed all .IFO and .VOB files in VIDEO_TS (if you have audio files too, like .AUP, they go in the audio sub-directory), leaving the .BUP and management files in the /DVD folder itself.\n\n*opened TERMINAL, went to the directory given in step 1\n\n*type in the command:\nmkisofs -dvd-video -o dvdimage.iso dvd/ (you will change the .ISO filename and the dvd/ folder, depending on the name of your dvd. If your dvd was named TROLL, then the command would be:\nmkisofs -dvd-video -o TROLLimage.iso TROLL/\n\n*Now, I have a 7.4-gb ISO image sitting in 'home/temp' by the name of dvdimage.iso\n\n*Open Brasero and select the last button (BURN IMAGE), choose your ISO file, choose your destination (ideally, your DVD drive), and accept. When done, you now have a new burn of a video DVD that will play in a DVD player or DVD drive\n\n\nMy test on a 7.4-gb .ISO onto a DVD+R(DL) dual layer disk (capacity 8.5 gb) was successful, and I did play the movie afterwards (I also wasted almost 2-hours watching the movie, afterwards!)\nI did get one initial error when my typing hand decided that I spell 'dvd' as 'dwd', but a quick OPERATOR ERROR check fixed it...Ubuntu performed flawlessly, as did Brasero.\nIf you get errors, look hard at yourself first, then make sure that you have PAL or NTSC (as may be required in your region) set properly, if required. Also, if you are not placing your appropriate files in the right place during the mkisofs process, you are mostly likely failing at this point. Remember, you must build your directory structure first, to successfully use mkisofs for video dvd processes.\n\nA: *\n\n*Try other programs, i.e. gnomebaker or simpleburn:\nhttp://simpleburn.tuxfamily.org/ -- https://launchpad.net/~simpleburn/+archive/ppa\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/gnomebaker/ -- https://launchpad.net/~gnomebaker/+archive/stable\n\n*There are different types of DVDs that support different capacities. According to the wikipedia article (Capacity and nomenclature of (re)writable discs), there are two versions of DVD-R discs, ~3.68 GiB and ~4.37GiB (Don't look at GB, but GiB, that's the actual data capacity).\nAlways look at what's printed on the DVD, they usually mention if they're DVD-R or DVD+R. If they don't mention anything (i.e. no-named), don't buy them, unless you're up for the risk.\nPrefer DVD+R (no specific reason, but if you need one, they don't have 2 versions and are 4.37 GiB in capacity).\nYou could also try the dual layered dvds, which provide ~8 GiB in capacity.\nFor testing purposes buy 2-3 DVD+RW discs.\n\n*Burn at low speeds, 4x recommended.\n\n*Devices such as dvd burners die eventually (at least in my case), after 2-3 years they become faulty. For example, burning worked in my case, except that I couldn't boot using any cd/dvd media. I bought a new CD/DVD burner and recycled the old one. Now the new one after 2 years burns only at speeds lower than 10x. Go figure. :)\n\nA: I have had numerous problems with the CD burning software on Ubuntu. Only one option eventually satisfied me (but unfortunately it is not open source): Nero Linux 4.  Nero offers a free 30 trial before you have to buy. I don't know if Nero will solve the problem you are experiencing or not. But it being propietary might bypass whatever is causing the problem on Ubuntu?\nWhat I would recommend is to try K3B on Ubuntu. You will have to install the KDE libraries to install K3B though. If K3B does not work for you, I would try Nero. Nero for Linux did everything I asked and had all the options I was looking for.\nI'm hoping that the poor quality and dearth of features of the open source CD burning options will be addressed at some point for Ubuntu because I don't like having to use closed source stuff. But, unfortunately, I have not found a better alternative for CD burning on Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Does a purchase from Ubuntu software center of World of Goo include updates and if so what is causing an unauthorized error message when updating?

It's not being detected by Ubuntu. Please let me know what other information you would like me to provide. Thank You!\n\nA: It will not work since HDMI is digital and doesn't support analog signals.\nYou could use an adapter.\nThere are two kinds of DVI signals\nDVI-I, which has both analog and digital output, and\nDVI-A which has only the analog output\n\nSo if you hook in the VGA → DVI cable, the signal will be analog on the DVI-end of the cable. \nSince HDMI is digital, it doesn't support analog signals.\nExtracted from here.\n\nA: The DVI to vga adapters are passive with no active electronics.  The simply connect the analog pins available on some, but not all, DVI connectors to the appropriate pins on the VGA connector.  If you have access to the proper DVI connector they work fine - I have used two of them under Windows for several years.  \nConnecting HDMI digital to VGA analog requires active electronics to convert the digital signal to analog.  \nAn example of a dongle that does exactly that is the DINO DCA106-HV HDMI to VGA Dongle which is available at several well know Internet vendors.  This dongle is specified to work with several versions of Windows - apparently without drivers.  \nThe only question is whether it will also work with Linux, in particular Ubuntu.  \nIf anyone has some actual experience with this device and Ubuntu I would be very interested in your results.  \nAn additional fact that may be relevant, it is reported not to work with Apple OS.\n\nA: I had this same problem.  My HDMI to VGA cable worked on windows, but on Ubuntu, my monitor displayed \"HDMI 1 is not connected\".\nI fixed this problem by switching my cables around.

So far, work on this problem has focused on changing it from /media to /. I suspect there is some way to do that. But a simple, quick-and-dirty solution would be to make it so /media and / are the same folder.\nI can't strongly recommend this, as the system is not designed to work this way, and there may be bugs that exists because developers did not consider this possibility. (Some might even not consider the assumption that / is not /media a bug.)\nBut you should be able to make /media a symbolic link to /, so that when something is mounted in /media/mount-point, it is actually mounted in /mount-point.\n\n\n*\n\n*It will also be accessible through /media/media/mount-point, /media/media/media/mount-point, and so forth, though it would be quite confusing if you were to actually access it by those names.\n\n\nPlease note that while I have not done the necessary research to ensure that this could never create a security problem, it doesn't create one in any of the ways that it would initially seem to:\n\n\n*\n\n*The directories in /, like /usr and /dev, that a non-root user could obtain system access by compromising, cannot be accessed in this way. If you mount a partition whose volume name is /usr, it won't overwrite or give access to /usr, it will mount with an alternate name (usually /usr_).\n\n*This does not give unrestrained access in /, and you do not need to (and indeed, should not) change ownership or permissions of / (or any other file or folder). The ownership and permissions of / and /media are already the same (0755, root:root):\nek@Apok:~$ ls -ld / /media\ndrwxr-xr-x 25 root root 4096 2012-07-15 19:17 /\ndrwxr-xr-x 14 root root 4096 2012-07-23 15:16 /media\n\nIt's only for specific mount points that non-root users may gain access they didn't already have, when the device is mounted on them.\nTo make /media a symbolic link to /, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unmount all your partitions that are mounted in /media so /media is empty.\n\n*Delete /media:\nsudo rmdir /media\n\n\n*Recreate /media as a symbolic link to /, located in /:\nsudo ln -s / /media\n\nPlease note that / comes before /media in the ln command, because when creating symbolic links, we put the target first, and then the source.\nIf you ever need or want to undo this, just perform the steps in reverse:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unmount all dynamically mounted partitions.\n\n\n*\n\n*They're mounted in /, but it's through the /media symbolic link, so you probably won't be able to remove that symbolic link while they're mounted, and if you did, you may not be able to access them, flush data to them, or unmount them cleanly.\n\n\n*Remove the symbolic link:\nsudo rm /media\n\n\n*Re-create the real directory:\nsudo mkdir /media\n\nYou don't have to specify a bitmask, because when you create a folder as root, the default permissions are correct for /media.\nThis method is similar to the previous suggestion to manually create individual symbolic links in / to specific subdirectories of /media. It's different in that the symbolic link is /media itself, which should result in the exact behavior the OP requested, without having to manually make links for each mount point.\n\nA: As far as I know, This isn't possible now, (at least not feasible).

Here's the full gory pastebin.\n\n\nSafely Install GuitarPro without apt-get wanting to remove it\n\n\n*\n\n*I believe the above behavior comes from the deb's dumb dependency on gksu:i386 (which is the graphical root elevation package)\n\n*Unfortunately, the only safe way to install this and not have to deal with apt-get's whining is to manually install it and its dependencies. Here's how:\n\n\nHow to manually examine and safely install a binary i386 deb with its dependencies\n\n\n*\n\n*First, remove the current half-installed packaged with sudo dpkg --remove guitarpro:i386\n\n*Now, change to the directory where your deb file is stored. For easy typing let's create a short symlink - my deb called gp6-full-linux-demo-r11100.deb, yours may differ:\n\n\n*\n\n*ln -s gp6-full-linux-demo-r11100.deb gp6.deb\n1. Examine the deb's architecture and dependencies\nFirst, we examine the deb's dependencies without installing it.\n\n\n*\n\n*dpkg-deb -I gp6.deb shows us:\n new debian package, version 2.0.\nsize 172147458 bytes: control archive= 75020 bytes.\n 375 bytes,    10 lines      control\n335109 bytes,  2770 lines      md5sums\nPackage: GuitarPro6\nVersion: 6.1.3\nSection: non-free/audio\nPriority: optional\nArchitecture: i386\nDepends: libc6 (>= 2.1.3), libstdc++6, libasound2, libxml2, libxslt1.1, libportaudio0, libportaudio2, libglu1-mesa, gksu, libssl0.9.8\nInstalled-Size: 222632\nMaintainer: Arobas Music \nDescription: http://www.guitar-pro.com\nGuitar Pro 6, Linux Version.  \n\n*So this is an i386 application, and all its dependencies are also going to be i386.\n\n*The first thing to do is install the ia32-libs i386 compatibility package, if you haven't already:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\n\n*Let's also copy and paste the package's dependencies in a text file, for later.\n\n\n2. \"Extract\" the deb into a tar archive and examine its contents\n\n\n*\n\n*Let's extract the deb to a tar archive now so we can examine its contents without having to install it:\n\n\n*\n\n*dpkg-deb --fsys-tarfile gp6.deb > gp6.tar\n\n\n*And open up the File Manager (Nautilus), and mount the gp6.tar as an archive by right-clicking and selecting Open in Archive Mounter; after that you'll see gp6.tar added to the bottom the left sidebar, with an eject icon next to it:\n\n\n*Go to the View Menu for File Manager, and change the Sidebar to the Tree view option instead of Places: \n\n\n*Now expand the gp6.tar tree in the sidebar by clicking on the triangles; repeat for each level until you can see the folder structure of the file:\n\n\n*From the structure, we see that the program's files go into two locations: /opt and /usr/share:\n\n\n*\n\n*Anything that goes into /opt is self-contained and will not affect anything else on the system.\n\n*We see that /usr/share only contains icons/bitmaps, which are harmless.\n\n\n\n3. If it's safe, \"install\" the program by extracting the tar file\n\n\n*\n\n*Go back to the terminal, and make sure you are in the directory containing the downloaded deb/tar files. Then type:\n\nsudo tar -C / -xvf gp6.tar\n\n\n*This will extract the program files in the appropriate locations, showing you the file names and progress. (Sample Output)\n\n\n*\n\n*The -C switch tells tar to perform this operation relative to the root directory, not the current directory.\n\n\n\n4. Figure out which dependencies are missing with ldd, install them, and rock-and-roll!\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up the /opt/GuitarPro6 folder in the File Manager:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*We see that the executable is called GuitarPro (with the diamond-\"gears\" icon), and also that a lot of lib-xxxx files are included in the folder.\n\n*This is normal for binary-only programs; they try to include the versions of the specific libraries they need, since those may not be available from the repositories of a specific distribution.\n\n\n*Along with these included libraries and the ia32-libs package, most 32-bit dependencies should have been installed. Instead of blindly installing the dependencies we saw in the deb file info via apt-get--which can cause problems-- let's figure out if we're actually missing anything.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go back to the terminal, and change to the GuitarPro directory with cd /opt/GuitarPro6\nUsing ldd\n\n\n*\n\n*Type ldd GuitarPro | grep found, and the output will be libportaudio.so.2 => not found\n\n\n*\n\n*ldd prints the dependencies (shared libraries) of a program, and whether they exist or not on the system. Here's what the full output of GuitarPro looks like.\n\n*To make life easier, we simply filter for the ones that do not exist via grep found.\n\n\n*Here, only the libportaudio2 library is missing. But the dependencies said libportaudio0? (see step 1.) Which is it??\n\n\n*\n\n*Let's search for the available versions using apt-cache search libportaudio from the terminal.\n\n*That's tells us that both libportaudio2 and libportaudio0 packages are available. Let's install the 2 first, with\n\nsudo apt-get install libportaudio2:i386\n\n*The :i386 part is very important, since our program is 32-bit. If apt-get asks to replace/remove libportaudio2 and/or other files, that's OK, because some libraries cannot be installed simultaneously in both 32- and 64-bit versions.\n\n\n*Let's double-check dependencies one final time: ldd GuitarPro6 | grep found gives us nothing (that's what we want!)\n\n\n*\n\n*If you get the error ./GuitarPro: /opt/GuitarPro6/./libz.so.1: version ZLIB_1.2.3.3 not found (required by /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libxml2.so.2) this means that Guitar Pro is using a wrong version of libz, fix this by removing the libz.so.1 file from the GuitarPro6 directory: \n\nsudo rm libz.so.1\n\nGuitar Pro will fall back to the libz version of your system.\n\n\n*Exit the terminal and go back to the /opt/GuitarPro6 folder in the File Manager. Double-click GuitarPro and...\n\n\n*Clean-up the Download folder by deleting the tar file from the File Manager.\n5. The launcher shortcut has already been added\n\n\n*\n\n*Because the package already contained a GuitarPro6.desktop shortcut that was extracted to /usr/share/applications, there is no need to manually create one. It's sitting there in the Launcher:\n\n\nA: I tried something out and got it to work!\n\n\n*\n\n*I copied \"/opt/GuitarPro6\" somewhere.\n\n*I did sudo apt-get -f install to remove Guitar Pro.\n\n*I copied the folder back into /opt/GuitarPro6 and replaced everything there.\n\n*I installed more packages as follows:\nsudo apt-get install dconf-gsettings-backend python-levenshtein python-indicate libav-tools libstartup-notification0 libxmuu1 libavfilter-extra-2 libbabl-0.0-0 libgegl-0.0-0 libgconf2-4 python-vobject libgtk-3-0 libpam-cap python-utidylib libdconf0 python-iniparse python-xmpp libpam-gnome-keyring libxcb-util0 python-farstream\n\n\n*I downloaded this image GuitarPro icon and saved it in /opt/GuitarPro6/icon.png so i could have an image to create my own .desktop file.\n\n*I created a .desktop file with sudo gedit:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Guitar Pro 6\nComment=Guitar Pro 6\nIcon=/opt/GuitarPro6/icon.png\nExec=sh /opt/GuitarPro6/gp-launcher.sh\nTerminal=false\nCategories=Audio\n\nI saved this file into /usr/share/applications with the name GuitarPro6.desktop.\nNow everything works and I can find Guitar Pro in the dash.\n\nA: I've also been struggling with this over the past few days.\nI've found the best way is to use the Windows executable under wine. Seems a lot more solid.\n\nA: To answer your question, to stop apt-get -f install from removing software you need to add --no-remove to the command you run. This will immediately abort the apt-get run if something is to be removed and your software will not be removed.\nHowever, what you are probably looking for is a way to have a system run normally, yet also have that software installed. What you will need to do is look at the output from when you forces the installation of the package with dpkg, and see what it is failing on, then install that dependency using\napt-get install package-name\nIn your case, it is gksu (specifically, gksu). Now you may find that when you attempt to install gksu that it has dependencies as well that need to be installed. Since you are forcing the 32-bit package install, you will need to manually install these dependencies using the same command above.\n\nA: I simply installed gp6 under LinuxMint 14 32-Bit, ran updater and fixed issues with zlib by copying zlib.so1.2.27 to /opt/GuitarPro, renaming it to zlib.so.1, installed gksu and its dependencies, ran the updater again for bringing all up to date. Afterwards i connected my 64-bit Linux to 3s-Bit Linux via fish://username@mymachineIP/opt in Dolphin and copied the whole GuitarPro6 dir to my home dir on 64-Bit Linux and from there to /opt.

So I ask what would you do? the only thing is it should not involve any money (I know mac soft is rarely free) which also excludes getting any MacOS unless I can use a free macos.img for VM or restore the original Mac for free.\n\n\nThank you\n\nA: If you have access to another Mac this should be fairly easy. Get a copy of Leopard (the last version that supported PowerPC) in dmg format or if you have the disc great. Next open up Disk Utility on another Mac and restore that .dmg file to a USB drive. It is a fairly straightforward process. That drive should then be bootable when holding down Alt during the Mac startup. After this installing Ubuntu should be easy as you will be in Mac OS.\n\nA: You can see if it detects your USB thingy by typing dev / ls in Open Firmware.

A couple of choices are Linux and Linux Extended.\nEdit Interestingly, when I selected Linux for the Partition Type the program proceeded to run the hard disk for about 10 minutes. Scary, I know. The hard disk is run even though the utility clearly shows that it is the USB drive that has been selected for information display and modifications. Then it reported that there was some sort of failure but there was not enough memory to report the problem to developers. \n\nA: One solution is to choose Format Disk and set it to no partitions. Then set the entire volume to ext4. Copy the tar file to the Flash device and use diff to verify. \n\nA: I was having a similar problem.

Remember to uninstall the previous package(s).\n\nA: I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 with kernel 3.2.0-26 and had a nightmare getting the ATI and catalyst drivers installed. I'm running a Radeon hd5xxx card and had tried and failed to install the drivers.  This is what worked for me as I had a broken installation that wouldn't reinstall and gave me the same DKMS error.\nI also followed the binary driver, but as it relies on the uninstall being OK, which mine wasn't, it was useless and refused to fix my driver. I finally amalgamated several fixes from different sites to get mine working.\nI did this after using recovery console to get some display back.  I had access to synaptic at the time so hopefully you have access.\nFirst thing I did was to add a repository and added all the updates.  Graphics failed as I expected.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3 \n\nThis added some libs that the main repository didn't have and fixed a few other issues too.\nThen:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.BAK - for safety\n\n*sudo  rm /usr/share/ati/fglrx-uninstall.sh - stops the purge from failing without doing anything at all.\n\n*sudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx*  (Had errors but carried on)\n\n*sudo rm -rf /usr/share/lib/fglrx\n\n*sudo rm -rf /usr/share/lib32/fglrx\n\n*open synaptic and mark fglrx for installation. This finally added the driver.\n\n*with synaptic again, add the ATI catalyst control center.\n\n\nAfter reboot, I had issues with my dual screens but as catalyst was installed, I fixed this and now everything works.  It even sorted out a flashing I got when moving windows across the dual screens or when activating rotation of desktop cube.\n\nA: The new AMD 12.11 beta drivers (released 2012.10.23) will work with newer kernels (in my case they are working with 3.5). However to install them you must first install linux-headers-generic. Hence:\n    sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\n\nYou will have to reinstall them from the command line every time you have a kernel update (ctrl+alt+F1 to get to a console in low-graphics mode).\nRun the driver as sudo, and use the --force option, e.g.:\n    sudo ./amd-driver-installer-catalyst-12.11-beta-x86.x86_64 --force\n\nP.S.

To test it type \nsudo speaker-test -c6\n\nOh and after you reboot if you don't hear surround sound you might need to type in your terminal alsamixer and change the setting there from 2 channel ( ch2 ) to 6 channel ( ch6 ). You will even need to edit that one config file to set it there too.\ngksu gedit /etc/pulse/daemon.conf\nChange the setting of  default-sample-channels = 2\nto : default-sample-channels = 6 ( This might be commented out with ; or #, uncomment it )\nYou might need to reboot a second time after you edit that file and setup the alsamixer to 6 channels.\nEDIT UPDATE : Even if you do not have surround sound, you can still remove and install using the commands above. They will allow you the alsamixer in a much more cleaner install. Then open alsamixer and try the Microphone again after a reboot.\n", "Q: Live CD doesn't boot correctly!

I am using 12.04. Would my laptop battery last longer if I copy my .mp3 files to a USB memory stick, then play them from there rather than from the HDD?\nThanks,\nDennis\n\nA: No. It would drain your battery faster accessing files over USB.\n\nA: This could potentially drain the battery slower if it results in the hard disk being spun down, and staying spun down more often.\nCompared to the amount of power it takes to run even a laptop hard drive's motor, it seems unlikely that the difference in power consumption between SATA and USB is significant. So I think the idea that accessing data via USB will drain the battery faster is probably not relevant to your situation.\nHowever, this could only potentially help if you're not using your computer for other things at the same time. If you are using your computer for other tasks, then the internal hard drive will probably be accessed frequently anyway. Then it won't be able to spin down, or at least won't stay spun down very long.\nEven if putting your audio files on a USB flash drive does decrease your power consumption, my guess is that it wouldn't be by very much, and the hassle would likely make it not worthwhile.\nIf you're asking about whether a USB flash drive or an external USB magnetic (i.e., traditional) storage drive (that gets power from the computer via USB) will drain the battery faster, then in this case, the external magnetic drive will certainly consume more power than the flash drive.\nUltimately, your pattern of use and your hardware creates a set of circumstances that might be sufficiently unique to require that you do the testing yourself, to see how fast the battery is drained.\nFinally, please note that you may get better, more detailed answers if you ask about this on a hardware forum. Ubuntu and other OSes do (potentially) spin drives down under slightly different circumstances, so you might see Ubuntu-specific behavior here...but all modern general-purpose OSes will spin down laptop hard drives when not in use, so this question is mostly about hardware.\n", "Q: Is it a good idea to install different versions of Ubuntu Accomplishments on different computers? On my laptop, I have Ubuntu Accomplishments 0.1, installed from the stable PPA. On my desktop, I have Ubuntu Accomplishments 0.2, installed from the daily PPA.\nGiven the fact that they synchronize information through Ubuntu One, may there be any kind of conflict? Or on the contrary, is it retro-compatible?\nWhat should be my default behaviour with such apps that synchronize information on Ubuntu One? For example for Nitro Tasks on any other?\n\nA: Yes, most likely this data will conflict. There were significant changes in trophy files format from 0.1 to 0.2, which will probably result in your trophies being not detected - the 0.1 daemon will definitely not see the trophies generated by 0.2. I am not sure, but it is very probable that it will also be the case if you try to open 0.1 trophies with a 0.2 viewer/daemon. Considering that, you may end up in some trouble.\nHowever, if you really want to use such setup, it is possible to use separate directories for your trophy files for each of these systems - just tune the ~/.config/accomplishments/.accomplishments file. 0.2 is now released, so 0.1 is outdated anyway, thus you may prefer to just upgrade your laptops's Accomplishments to 0.2.\nWe hope to stabilize the trophies format, and hopefully future versions will not suffer because of such conflicts.\n\nIn general, this depends on the application. Some applications rely on the format of data they synchronize using U1, others not. In case the data format is not significant (e.g. the application shares photos and music), conflicts are unlikely - if the format is significant however, it would be best to use the same version on application on all synchronized devices, especially if the application is overcoming major changes from version to version.\n", "Q: How can I uninstall Ubuntu? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to remove Ubuntu and put Windows back on? \n\nI have installed ubuntu netbook edition via a bootable-USB and upgraded ubuntu to 11.04 via network connection.

For example, if you wanted to back up the image to sda6, enter the following from a terminal:\nsudo mkdir /media/backup\nsudo mount /dev/sda6 /media/backup\n\nYou are creating the folder /media/backup, which is where we are mounting the drive.\nYou can also just click on the drive that you want to back up TO in Nautilus (the file manager) and it should automatically mount it. If you hover over it, it should show the full path to it, it should be something like /media/LABEL, where label is the label of your drive. \nYour ddrescue command then would look something like this:\nsudo ddrescue -r 3 /dev/sdc /media/backup/ImageFileName.img /media/backup/TextFileName.txt\n\n\nA: Here's a trick to get ddrescue to save an image to and external hard drive. \nIf you try the above suggestion:\nsudo ddrescue -r 3 /dev/sdc /home/yinon/ImageFileName.img /home/yinon/TextFileName.txt\n\nyou will get the error message:\nddrescue: Can't open output file: Not a directory\n\nAs mentioned above, \"You are attempting to write the image (and log) directly to the disk device, instead of a path on the filesystem\"\nTo trick ddrescue into writing directly to an external device do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a folder on the external device (say a portable hard drive)\nand name it \"ddrescue-image\"\n\n*Then create a link to this folder on the Desktop and rename it\n\"ddrescue-image-link\"\n\n*Next open Terminal and enter: \nsudo ddrescue -r 3 /dev/sdb ~/Desktop/ddrescue-image-link/MyImage.img ~/Desktop/ddrescue-image-link/ddrescue-log.txt\n\nNow your image will have been saved on the external device.

Fedora 17 will keep you on the cutting edge of kernels as will Arch.\nSee also\nhttp://communities.intel.com/thread/28472\nhttp://communities.intel.com/thread/29157\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1953734\nIf you do manage to get it working, on behalf of all gma3600/3650 users, please document how on the Ubuntu wiki.\n\nA: I am writing this from Slackware running on the DN2800 in 16:9 using a nonstandard configuration that gives surprisingly high speed streaming video, in particular, the peacekeeper benchmark compares favorably with the W7 version. I have tried this trick on Ubuntu and Ubuntu may support it, but needs some work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the old 915resolution program and add a few lines to recognize the Cedarview chipset from Intel.\n\n*Get the uvesafb.ko module for your kernel and the latest fbdev_drv.so xorg driver.\n\n*Run the following script before running startx (or after):\n915resolution -c Cedarview 54 1366 768 32 /sbin/modprobe uvesafb mode_option=1366x768-32 scroll=ywrap vram_total=8\n\n\n*Make sure the xorg.conf expects fbdev as the graphics driver so that starting, or restarting, has the fbdev_drv.so picking up the mode 54 which is set for 16: 9. (Best set up by Ubuntu gurus)\n\n*Use your administrator privileges to find or download a TTF font with only bold subfonts (you may have to go to /usr/share/fonts/TTF and delete some subfonts). Set your web browsers to use these bold-only fonts.\nThe result works in full screen and gives very fast streaming video rendering, although your monitor will tell you that it is running 1024x768.\nRecommended are any flash plugin that works with Ubuntu and the xine video player with the Ubuntu xine plugin for Firefox.\n", "Q: \"You are not the owner...\" message when trying to access folder In the properties menu of this folder the permission is set to \"root\" user and group, it shows the message \"you are not the owner, so you cannot change these permissions.\"\nI am indeed the owner and only user of the machine, how can I change the permissions?\n\nA: sudo chown -R username /path/to/directory\n\nYou must have sudo privileges though! \nyou should use -R option to operate on files and directories recursively\n\nA: This is not telling you that you don't own the computer on which the folder exists. It's telling you that you don't own the folder. This is a very different concept of ownership.\nOn your Ubuntu system, your user account doesn't automatically have the ability to perform any possible action--some administrative actions can only be performed by root, the superuser. However, this user is not any real person and, in Ubuntu, you don't log in as this user. Instead, Ubuntu provides facilities like sudo and gksu to perform actions as root.\nYou should check out the three links above. Once you've read that, if you still want to change the permissions on that folder, here's one way to do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Alt+F2.\n\n*Type in the command gksu nautilus and press Enter.\n\n*Now you have a file browser window running as root. You can change the permissions with this. Any program you open from this will run as root too. You should use this carefully and sparingly.\n\n*Make sure to close this root Nautilus window when you're done, so you don't accidentally use it for something that you don't need to be root to do.\nBefore you change the permissions (and/or ownership) on this folder, you should be aware that doing this to system files in Ubuntu can have negative consequences: you can make your system insecure...or even stop your system from working.\nIf these files have the wrong ownership/permissions because you brought them over from another system and did so as root (for example, if these are recovered documents), then go ahead.\nBut if these are systemwide configuration files, programs, or you're not sure what they are but you're trying to follow instructions that tell you to do something with them ...then you'll be much better off to ask specifically about them. You can edit your question or post a new question to ask if it would be safe for you to change ownership/permissions for this specific folder (provided that you can disclose what this folder is and what you are trying to accomplish).\n\nA: You need admin privileges to accomplish that.

I want to start toying around with java (eventually getting to the point where I can write basic little programs for android or web), but I've managed to have java messed up on my computer (from past experiments). \nI'm not sure which version of java I have, and would like to know if there is a command to see the version of java that is installed and active. Also, which version works best? All this on 32bit Ubuntu 12.04  \nEDIT:\nOk, so it seems like I have both openjdk 6 and 7, with openjdk 7 in use. I want to use openjdk 7, so how do I uninstall openjdk 6? Is just via USC good enough or is there a command that should be run?\n\nA: This command should tell you what is currently providing the Java virtual machine (java) and the Java compiler (javac):\nfile /etc/alternatives/java /etc/alternatives/javac\n\nThis assumes the \"alternatives\" system is working properly, which might not be the case, depending on how Java has been \"messed up\" in the past. To check this, run:\nfile `which java javac`\n\nIf the alternatives system is working correctly and being used by Java, then you should see:\n/usr/bin/java:  symbolic link to `/etc/alternatives/java'\n/usr/bin/javac: symbolic link to `/etc/alternatives/javac'\n\nOtherwise please edit your question to provide details. Then it should be possible to give a more specific answer.\n\nYou can remove openjdk-6 with the Software Center. There are multiple packages associated with it, so you may need to remove more than one packages. (All the `openjdk-6 packages are listed here.)\nOr you can use the command-line:\nsudo apt-get remove openjdk-6-\\* icedtea-6-\\*\n\nHowever, whichever method you use, you may want to check first to see what depends on these packages--you might have software installed that specifically needs version 6. (Probably not, but possibly.)\nYou can check for this by simulating the removal operation on the command-line:\napt-get -s remove openjdk-6-\\* icedtea-6-\\*\n\nThis will show you the effects of removing those packages, including what other packages would be removed as well. (You'll notice that since this is a simulation, you don't need sudo.)\nIf you want to be able to continue using Java content online in your web browser (this is not the same thing as JavaScript), then before you remove any icedtea-6- or openjdk-6- packages (except perhaps openjdk-6-jdk), you should make sure you have icedtea-7- packages installed corresponding to whatever icedtea-6- packages are installed.\n\nA: This what I did that worked for me :\nOpen your terminal :\ncontrol + alt + T\nThen type ( or copy and paste from here ) these commands one at a time:\nsudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/info/oracle-java7-installer*\nsudo apt-get purge oracle-java7-installer*\nsudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*java*\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer\n\nThen to be on the safe side, I would reboot.\nTo find your java version type\njava -version\n\nand you should see output similar to this:\njava version \"1.7.0_04\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_04-b20)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.0-b21, mixed mode)\n\nAlthough yours will be in 32 bits.\nI highly suggest using Java 7, but the updates will try to install Java 6 too. That is OK. But your default should still come up as 7. Everything I have thrown at it works as long as your video card drivers work.\n\n\n*\n\n*Are PPA's safe to add to my system and what are some \"red flags\" to watch out for?\n\nA: \njava -version\njavac -version\n\nThese commands display what version of java (the interpreter that runs Java programs) and javac (the compiler that creates them) you have installed.\nSee the image above for details.\n\nA: The simplest way is:\nupdate-java-alternatives -l shows you all the Java versions you have installed.\njava -version shows you the Java version you are using.\njava -showversion shows you the Java version you are using and help.\nNormally it would be OpenJDK.\n", "Q: Why dd is not a reliable command to write bootable .iso files to USB thumb drive? One answer here indicates that Ubuntu .iso s are not expected to boot if copied with dd to a USB thumb drive. Why do some Linux distributions have the option to directly write their bootable .iso file to a thumb drive with dd, but others (Ubuntu?) do not?  \nIn Ubuntu I think it has to be converted to .img first.  Is this true?\nIs it for some architectural difference in .isos? Or is it due to any limitation of dd itself?I don't know if it is off-topic here. I can move it to a more proper place if the community thinks so or suggests one. Some explanation would be appreciable.\n\nA: With Ubuntu 12.04 it is possible to dd the .iso file to a disk to create a bootable disk. It only works with some isos (including Ubuntu 12.04, but not earlier Ubuntu versions) because booting from CD and booting from a disk are handled differently on BIOS based systems.\nAmong other things, for a hard drive to be bootable it must contain boot code in the first sector, for a CD to be bootable it must contain boot code \"at sector 11 (17 decimal) in the last session on the CD\" according to the El Torito specification. Since the boot code, at least the initial portion loaded by the BIOS, is stored in different places for CDs and hard drives, a disk image can have boot code in both places so that the bootloader is loaded if the image is booted as a hard drive or as a CD.\nMost iso files are only designed to be bootable as CDs, and so they contain no boot code in the first sector of the image and thus a hard drive containing such an image won't have boot code in its first sector and won't be bootable.\n\nA: Ubuntu's current ISOs are dd-able and have been for some time.  They are \"hybrid\" ISOs: they have an MBR boot sector.  Using dd properly will create fully bootable USB drive.\nThe cited article, btw, only has one answer claiming that Ubuntu ISOs are not dd-able, and this isn't true.\nPlease see my answer here: How to convert a iso9660 ISO to a USB ISO\nThis answer provides a way to determine if an iso is hybridized (you can verify this for Ubuntu ISOs), how to hybridize it if it's not (for other cases), and how to correctly use dd to create a bootable drive.\n\nA: Notes that have no changes on the above posted accepted solution.\nThe question was posed as reliable, bootable iso and using dd. \nIn most cases linux users use the phrase iso to mean a special image of an optical disc. Bootable in that case could be one of a few methods that bios or uefi understands and allows to run from optical disc.\ndd is generally considered reliable however it could fail for many reasons on it's own and have nothing to do with the source or output. In most case it seems to fail only because it doesn't ask \"Are you sure you want to wipe that out??\"\nModern computers tend to view a usb as a real internal hard drive. \nOne could use a tool like 7z also to copy over some iso's to a fat32 flash drive.\nThis all assumes some modern hardware and a modern usb flash drive. \nIn the future we will have to be creating uefi bootable media in most cases. \n", "Q: Cannot uninstall myspell-he I tried to install a Hebrew spell checker for LibreOffice.

I just installed ubuntu and ran an update a few days ago.  I am now seeing 400 some odd packages eligible for update in the notifications, and I am starting to be concerned about system bloat.\nDoes that make sense?\nAt any rate, I am looking for some guidance about how to keep the desktop/laptop update and trim.\nHow often do you update the system?\n\nA: Although that number does seem high, it isn't really alarming. It is because of the way programs are written for Linux as opposed to other OS's. In Linux many programs are really just a bunch of other programs that all do a small function, but can be collaborated into one larger program. This is why we have dependencies. The reasoning for this is because in open source software, the ethos is \"do one thing and do it well\". When programs are written to do one thing and do it well, another programmer doesn't need to write that part of his program, because someone already did that, and they can just piggyback off of that program for that particular function.\nI recommend keeping your PC up-to-date because most of the times the updates are bug-fixes, feature enhancements or security fixes. I personally run updates whenever the default schedule is (I think it checks once a week) and notifies me to run updates.\n\nA: Updates replace the packages you already have installed so I wouldn't worry about adding bloat there. If the process is tedious/time consuming for you you can enable automatic updates to do it in the background:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I enable automatic updates?\nSelecting the \"Install security updates without confirmation\" option in the answer in that question will get you the minimum security updates you need to stay safe, you should probably leave that on \"Daily\". \nThen you can install all the other updates at your convenience but you don't need to install them to stay safe, but you'll want to to fix bugs in Ubuntu, so you can do that by hand at whatever pace you want. \n", "Q: Install Unity 4.0 in 12.04?

This process cannot be undone. You will loose every data on every partition you delete. Keeping a backup is your responsibility.\nSaid that, first you have to decide how you want to install Ubuntu.\nI can suggest three workarounds.\n\n\n*\n\n*By default installation menu: This has an option to use entire disk. the installer will automatically optimize the partitioning process.\n\n*The fail-safe option: To install Ubuntu, use your entire hard disk and delete every partition on it. To do this Boot from Live CD and choose the option to try Ubuntu.\nOnce you are on the live desktop session, find GParted partition editor; or ubuntu disk partitioner. With these wonderful tools you can delete and repartition your hard-disk very efficiently. I suggest you to delete every partition and then install Ubuntu.\nPS: I am not aware out of above said tools, which one is present in the Ubuntu 12.04 (latest) live CD.

Is there a PDF reader for Linux that does this?\nI would like to be able to extract images faster/easier than when taking a snapshot.\n\nA: You may also try pdfmod. It is a GUI (graphical interface) which can extract images and do other basic pdf manipulation.\n\nA: I have a double-column PDF file with embedded images created with LaTeX where the original images were provided as EPS. I tried the proposed solution based on pdfimages, but unfortunately, it didn't return any images. I tried then to use Inkscape, but the SVG images it generated were distorted and I had no luck exporting them as EPS either.\nThe software that worked for we was the MasterPdfEditor. \nHere is the procedure\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your file using Master PDF Editor\n\n*Use the edit tool (Alt+1) to select the image you need to extract\n\n*Copy the figure (Ctrl+C)\n\n*Click on the surrounding dashed frame around the image and check out the right sidebar (Object Inspector) and click on \"Geomerty\". There you can see the size of your selection\n\n*Create a new file (Ctrl+N). It will prompt you to provide the page size. Provide the exact size of your image and create the new file\n\n*Now it's a bit tricky: paste the image (Ctrl+V). The image may not show in the new file. Use the arrows to move it until you are able to trace it.\n\n*Use the arrows to centre the image in the new page\n\n*Save as PDF\n\n\nThe result is of very high quality, but the software is not free of charge. There is a demo version which \"allows you to try all features,\" but comes with \"the addition of a watermark on output file.\" To be frank, I didn't notice any watermark in the produced PDF.\n\nA: I often use Inkscape for this. Load the page, and delete all the other stuff. The advantage is that you can get vector images in SVG and modify them as you choose.\n\nA: If what you need is a cropped image in pdf/eps format, then extract a page with the image using pdfmod (as suggested by To Do).\nThen using pdfcrop you may crop it properly setting margins by trial and error:\npdfcrop --margins \"-15 -50 0 -140\" extracted_page.pdf\n\n\nA: Use pdfimages\npdfimages is a PDF image extractor tool which saves the images in a PDF file to PPM, PBM, JPEG or JPEG 2000 file(s) format.\nIt's a part of the poppler-utils package, which you'll need to install.\nUsage: pdfimages [options] <PDF-file> <image-root>\n\n\n*\n\n*option -all will extract images in original format.\n\n*option -j will extract images as .jpg (caveat: images are converted and usually size is larger than original)\n\n\nExample1: The following extracts all images from a PDF file, saving them in their orginal format.\npdfimages -all in.pdf /tmp/out\n\nExample2: The following extracts all images from a PDF file, saving them in JPEG format.\npdfimages -j in.pdf /tmp/out\n\nWill save images from PDF file in.pdf in files /tmp/out-000.jpg (or /tmp/out-000.pbm; see below), /tmp/out-001.jpg, etc.\n\nThe pdfimages man page explains:\n-j:  Normally, all images are written as PBM (for monochrome images) or PPM for\n     non-monochrome images) files. With this option,  images in DCT format are\n     saved as JPEG files. All non-DCT images are saved in PBM/PPM format as usual.\n\n\nA: With pdfimages the extracted image may be in two or more parts. A simple way to put them together again with no worries about extracted formats is to import the parts into LibreOffice Draw, crop with the image crop dialogue, position the parts, adjust the page size and export in whatever format you prefer.\n\nA: Note that this question is specifically asking about \"Extracting embedded images from a PDF\". The keyword is extracting! That means: I have a PDF; it has some images embedded within it; how do I get them out!? If that is your question, use pdfimages as the main answer by @pl1nk states.\nHow to convert a PDF into a bunch of images:\nMany people Googling around and landing on this question (myself included), however, are searching for a slightly different question on not even realizing the difference until hours of frustration later. So, if you are looking for \"How to convert a PDF into a bunch of images\" instead, which is NOT the same thing as \"how to extract images from a PDF\", here's how: use pdftoppm. \"PPM\" here is an image format, so this simply means \"PDF to image\". It works extremely well, albeit slow for a modern multi-core system, since it's a single-threaded application and doesn't take advantage of multiple cores of processing power.\nUbuntu 18.04 comes with pdftoppm version 0.62.0. Check your version with pdftoppm -v:\n$ pdftoppm -v\npdftoppm version 0.62.0\nCopyright 2005-2017 The Poppler Developers - http://poppler.freedesktop.org\nCopyright 1996-2011 Glyph & Cog, LLC\n\nRead the manual pages with man pdftoppm to see all of its many useful features. \nSupported output image formats:\nAs the man pages show, pdftoppm allows you to output images in the following formats: \n\n\n*\n\n*PPM (default)\n\n*PNG (with -png)\n\n*JPEG (with -jpeg)\n\n*TIFF (with -tiff)\n\n\nIt also allows you to specify output in monochrome (-mono) or grayscale (-gray) (default is color), to specify page numbers, to place output images into a folder, to crop and resize, specify resolution, specify jpeg quality (between 0 and 100), specify TIFF compression, process only even or odd-numbered pages, etc. It works extremely well and is EXTREMELY USEFUL!\nHere's some examples of how to use pdftoppm to convert a PDF to a bunch of image files:\n\n\n*\n\n*Output ppm files as pg-1.ppm, pg-2.ppm, pg-3.ppm, etc, in default 150 DPI x and y resolution:\npdftoppm mypdf.pdf pg\n\n\n*Same as 1, except place all of the output files in a folder called images:\nmkdir -p images && pdftoppm mypdf.pdf images/pg\n\n\n*[My favorite] Output images into \"images\" folder in jpeg format with 300 DPI x & y resolution instead of the default 150 DPI. Note that the output images are at some default jpeg compression level, and will take up approximately 0.1~1 MB in space per file for 300 DPI resolution and assuming standard 8.5\" x 11\" PDF pages.\nmkdir -p images && pdftoppm -jpeg -r 300 mypdf.pdf images/pg\n\n\n*Output images into \"images\" folder in jpeg format with 300 DPI x & y resolution, at the highest quality jpeg level possible! quality values can range from 0 to 100. See the man pages. With quality set to 100 and resolution set to 300 DPI, expect each jpeg file to take up 2x the storage as above, with sizes ranging from ~0.2~2MB, depending on the content, and assuming 8.5\" x 11\" PDF pages.\nmkdir -p images && pdftoppm -jpeg -jpegopt quality=100 -r 300 mypdf.pdf images/pg\n\n\n*Output uncompressed .tif* images with **300 DPI x & y resolution. Output file sizes will be approximately 25 MB for 300 DPI and 8.5\" x 11\" PDF pages.\nmkdir -p images && pdftoppm -tiff -r 300 mypdf.pdf images/pg\n\nNote that outputing each page above at 300 DPI takes 15~45 seconds on my slow computer, meaning that a 100 pg PDF could take as long as 100 x 45/60 = 75 minutes or so for 300 DPI jpeg images, for example.\nTo time how long the process takes on your computer, simply place the time command in front of the pdftoppm portion of any of the commands above. Ex: here's the output from converting a PDF which had 3 pages:\n$ mkdir -p images && time pdftoppm -tiff -r 300 testpdf.pdf images/pg\n\nreal    1m47.572s\nuser    1m45.675s\nsys 0m1.536s\n\nThis means it took a total real-life clock time of 1m47.572s, or 60 + ~48 = 108 sec, which is 108/3 = 36 seconds per page.\nRelated:\n\n\n*\n\n*[How to turn a PDF into a searchable PDF w/pdf2searchablepdf] How to turn a pdf into a text searchable pdf?\n\n*How to turn a pdf into a text searchable pdf?\n\n*How to convert PDF to Image?\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6605006/convert-pdf-to-image-with-high-resolution/58795684#58795684\n\n*https://www.linuxuprising.com/2019/03/how-to-convert-pdf-to-image-png-jpeg.html\n\n*How to programmatically determine DPI of images in PDF file?\n\nA: If you want to crop a image from a pdf with a pdfviewer, you can try okular.

What I'm wondering is this - is Ubuntu-native Gnome being updated? \nI'm asking because I notice a discrepancy - Unity had a problem before in the new mail indicator staying blue if you read the message directly in Thunderbird when it arrives instead of via clicking the indicator itself. \nThis has been fixed in 12.04 from what I've noticed. \nBut transitioning to Gnome returned this issue. Will this fix be applied to Gnome too, or has Gnome been abandoned in terms of staying up to date? \n\nA: If you use GNOME Shell or GNOME Fallback (\"GNOME Classic\") in Ubuntu, they are supported by the community rather than by Canonical, but they updated under the same circumstances under which Unity (and Unity 2D) is updated.\nAs with Unity (and Unity 2D), GNOME Shell and GNOME Fallback can get big changes including new features with each subsequent release of Ubuntu (though GNOME Fallback might not ever change much). Each stable release of Ubuntu ships with the versions of software that are stable in Ubuntu in time for them to be included.\nAs for the specific mail indicator problem you're experiencing, you should report this as a bug.\n", "Q: ubuntu live cd start up error First off, I'm new to the Linux scene. This is my first attempt to make a single boot installation for Ubuntu.\nI tried it for a few days in dual boot with win7 and I was sold, so i removed the tumor my pc had to endure for so long (sorry laptop) and installed Ubuntu from an usb boot device.\nMy dual boot was as follows: Windows 7 was installed on partition C from hdd1, the windows installer for Ubuntu installed Ubuntu on partition I on that same hdd, hdd1.\nIn the live cd installation I did the normal execution for removing windows and it said that after the installation my partition would be 320gb big, that is the total size of my hdd, so I automatically assumed that it would format my whole hdd.\nNow the installation has completed and it tells me to restart my system, and here comes the problem: now I get a dashing white cursor on my screen after the BIOS load and it won't budge... it just stands there and it doesn't move on or load Ubuntu, the system gets very hot at this point...\nThen I tried to reinstall using the same live CD, it is still on my USB drive, but when I boot from the USB, I get the error: no such file with some address and the a grub rescue.\nWhat to do? I can get hold of a win7 copy, but I don't really want to use that crap again.\n\nA: Ok, I have solved this problem.\nFirst I re installed Win7 and made a new LiveCD.

I presumed that perhaps I got a bad download, so I checked the MD5 and it was not correct. I downloaded it again from the official download page, again a wrong MD5. I even downloaded it from the torrent link (the alternate) and AGAIN was given an incorrect MD5.\nAt this point, I checked my download of Linux Mint to see if maybe my MD5 sum program was, somehow, wrong about my Ubuntu downloads, and was given the correct MD5 there.\nFWIW, the install of Linux Mint would freeze as well, even though it had a verified MD5. However it installed in a VM just fine.\nOh also, I downloaded and created a live USB of 11.10, verified MD5 and all, and still no dice.\nAny ideas? My friend mentioned it could be the USB device at fault here. It is a PNY Flash drive.\n\nA: Make sure you're inserting your USB stick in a USB 2.0 port. The newer USB 3.0 ports can sometimes cause problems.\n", "Q: How much memory (RAM) should I allocate to the Virtual Machine? I'm installing Ubuntu in a Virtual Box; my host OS is Windows 7, and I have 6GB of RAM on my system. One tutorial on setting up Ubuntu on a virtual machine (this one, on step 14: http://www.aztcs.org/meeting_notes/linuxsig/ubuntuintovirtualbox/ubuntuintovirtualbox.htm) says to set the RAM at 45% of the total RAM I have available, which would be about 2.7GB in my case. Is this correct? \nAlso, when I allocate RAM to the vm, is that RAM now reserved exclusively for the vm, and if yes, is it only reserved for the vm when the vm is running a guest OS or does it create a permanent division in the RAM, i.e., when I stop running and quit from the virtual machine, will my host OS (Windows 7) regain all 6GB of RAM as its available RAM?\n\nA: You should give virtual machine however much RAM you need for the tasks you're using it to perform.\nIf you're running a single virtual machine, the suggestion you read is OK (provided that your host machine has enough RAM, which it does). However, depending on what you plan to do with your Ubuntu system, it probably doesn't need 2.7 GB of RAM. I give most of my virtual machines, including Ubuntu virtual machines, 1 GB of RAM, even when I have enough physical RAM available that I could allocate more.\nIf you plan to run multiple virtual machines, then giving a virtual machine 2.7 GB of RAM out of a total of 6 GB is probably too much. It would not work out well to have two VM's with that amount of RAM!\nFinally, your virtual machine will typically reserve all the RAM you give it, whenever it is running. When the virtual machine is turned off, suspended, hibernated, or otherwise not running, this RAM will not be in use. For example, I have about 10 virtual machines, most of which have 1 GB of RAM, on a host machine with 4 GB of RAM. This is not a problem; it just means I can only run up to a few of them at a time.\n\nA: There is not a fixed rule on the amount of RAM we assign for exclusive use by a virtual machine. However there are two points we need to take care of:\n\n\n*\n\n*assign enough RAM for the guest OS to run smoothly (> 512 MB for 64-bit Ubuntu)\n\n*leave enough RAM for the host OS including host applications (> 2 GB for 64-bit Windows 7)\nVirtual Box Manager will warn you whenever you assign more than 50% of RAM to a virtual machine, but in case we have plenty of RAM this is a rule of thumb recommendation only. Of course we can assign more than 50% of the system RAM to our VM as long as we have enough RAM left for our host OS.\n\nNote that we don't have to worry too much about the amount of RAM we assign to a newly created machine as we can easily change this at any time later.\n\n", "Q: How to create a unicode combination of keys by pressing one key (Simplify unicode adding) I am trying to simplify the way I add Unicode characters. At least to make them easier as in Windows for ASCII characters for new comers.\nRight now for example to add the letter Ñ I have to press CTRL+SHIFT+U and then type the unicode character 00D1 and then press space.\nWhat I want is to combine the CTRL+SHIFT+U part into one press. For example, pressing a special key I do not use would trigger the CTRL+SHIFT+U behaviour and I would just need to add the code part.\nHow can I combine this 3 keys (CTRL, SHIFT, U) into one, including the property of having to press them at the same time.\n\nA: A program like xmacro may be of help:\n xmacrorec can be used to record mouse and keyboard events on any X11 display.\n .\n xmacroplay can be used to playback recorded events or send any other\n mouse/keyboard events you choose. It is very handy for scripting an\n X display - for example controlling a presentation in mgp or ultrapoint\n from a script, network connection...\n .\n xmacroplay-keys is a script to help use the above.\n\nIf I'm understanding this correctly, you'd first define a macro for ctrl+shift+u (note it's shift rather than control, your original post has a small mistake in this respect), then use use Ubuntu's keyboard shortcuts to execute xmacroplay to \"play back\" your macro.\nI have to admit I haven't really tried this myself, as I think a much better solution would be to ask yourself why your users need to enter cryptic Unicode characters by hand, instead of having a keyboard layout that allows them to do so natively. You mention the specific case of Ñ, which can be very easily entered in spanish or latin american keyboard layouts.\nMoreover, if you have a US keyboard, you can use the \"English (International AltGr dead keys)\" layout to enter special characters for many languages, mainly by using AltGr (e.g. AltGr+n = ñ, AltGr+vowel = accents (áéíóú) and so on) . \nI suggest you configure this keyboard layout and then click on the small keyboard icon in the Keyboard Layouts control panel to see all the key mappings; chances are, most special characters you are likely to need can be entered with this layout and it will be easier to remember than Unicode codes and three-key combinations, since the mappings are generally quite intuitive (AltGr + ? = ¿, for instance).\nI also disagree with the idea that entering ASCII characters in Windows is easier for newcomers. The key is just as arbitrary (Alt + NumPad?), the codes are just as arbitrary to memorize (and it breaks my heart to see the little ASCII code charts pasted on people's desks), and this \"crutch\" also stems from the same underlying problem, which is a misconfigured keyboard layout.\nI do apologize for ranting, and I hope my answer proves useful; if you are unable for some reason to set a keyboard layout as I suggest, maybe you could update your question with more details in this regard so either I or someone else can provide a more useful solution.\n", "Q: What system information is useful in an emergency? I want to store a text file on Ubuntu One containing command-line output in case of a system fault that stops me logging in or seeing my screen. That way I can retrieve the information on my phone if I need to ask for help on here from another system. I got the idea after seeing some questions on here about major faults that had some responders asking for more information such as Ubuntu version, graphics card, what devices were connected and so on. It occurred to me that I wouldn't be able to answer those questions if I couldn't access my system because I'm not really a hardware guy and don't retain that kind of information very well in my memory. So my question is:\nIf I were to ask about a serious problem, such as no screen or can't log in at all, what command outputs would be most useful for you to see in order to help with my problem?\n\nA: Anything that stops you from logging in (even to the console) or seeing your screen is most probably a hardware problem. Hardware is also less likely to change between when you save the information and when you need it, which makes it more useful to troubleshoot than software configuration files which can change often.\nThe two hardware info outputs I recommend storing are:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo lshw > ~/lshw-output-20120612.txt\n\n*sudo lspci -v > ~/lspciv-output-20120612.txt\n", "Q: How do I install KDE or XFCE or LXDE to an Ubuntu 12.04 system with no internet connection?

I just attempted to install Ubuntu 12.04 on my other computer. I downloaded the .iso file, burned it to a disc, and booted from it. Before I continue, I might add that I already have an OS on this computer (Windows 7) and was attempting to install Ubuntu alongside it. \nSo, I selected my language, and clicked \"Install Ubuntu\" when the screen popped up. The window changed and said that I didn't have any operating system installed, what did I want to do? It gave me the option to wipe the disk and install Ubuntu, or \"something else.\" I clicked \"something else\" and setup two partitions on my hard disk for Ubuntu, one for the system files and one for the swap area. These two partitions were created in Win7. I just changed the file systems and mounted one of them with \"/.\" \nThen I clicked install, everything was going well, and then it said I had to restart my computer to use Ubuntu. So I restarted, and then the Windows logo appeared for a second, then it started the startup repair tool. So, I went through that, then restarted again. After the second restart, a screen popped up (purple background, like Ubuntu when it's loading) and there were a bunch of operating systems available. I chose Ubuntu, and it loaded fine. So then I restarted and tried to start Windows. It said there was a problem with Windows and that I needed to insert my installation media. \nSo I restarted (pressed the power button). The BIOS loaded, then it was just a blank screen with a gray cursor like a cmd box in Windows, except there was no text. Nothing will load. What did I do wrong? Any help will be appreciated.\n\nA: Most likely, you installed Ubuntu by mistake over Windows, while keeping the windows MBR (master boot record) information. I'd recommend these two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to run only Ubuntu, put Ubuntu on a USB stick/CD and boot from that. Then choose to wipe your hard drive entirely and run only Ubuntu.\n\n*If you want to run Windows and Ubuntu side by side, I recommend you first of all reinstall Windows completely. You can do this if you have a restore CD or restore partition that still works. When Windows is back, do not install Ubuntu from a CD/USB, install it from within Windows with a tool called \"Wubi\".\n", "Q: How do I bypass \"Do you want to...\" dialog after clicking script when using Unity?

You'll get the gray openbox-session background along with a default xterm and some VNC options:\n\n\n*Start your programs which need a GUI, etc. Right-clicking anywhere will let you open more terminals.

My personal account is in the group vboxsf.\nIt seems that I have to uncheck the option for \"executable\", but I have all my .tex files in the Dropbox shared folder.

In the dialog box that opens go to the Open With tab and select texworks as the Default Application.  \nNo .tex is not an executable file, its a type of text file.\nHow to set default program?  Has some more methods, such as Ubuntu Tweak.\nEDIT:\nAny text file can be considered executable if executable permissions are set.

My screen has a lot of brightness increments, as it's LED backlit and someone thought to take advantage of that.\nsudo apt-get install xbacklight\n# ..and test it..\nxbacklight -dec 20\nxbacklight -inc 20\n# If this works for you, you can proceed\n\nI'm using KDE, but this applies for Gnome as well.  For KDE:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Settings\n\n*Open Shortcuts and Gestures\n\n*Select Custom Shortcuts in the left bar, if it's not already selected\n\n*Right-click on a blank part of the list of actions, and select New->Global Shortcut\n\n*Create one named \"Brightness up\" and one named \"Brightness down\"\n\n*For the trigger, use your brightness-up/down keys. These will conflict with the defaults, but you can just reassign them to this action.\n\n*For the Action, enter (for example) \"xbacklight -inc 3\" or \"xbacklight -dec 3\" (minus quotes)\n\n*\n\n*Larger numbers increase/decrease the backlight more, and smaller numbers less.  \n\n\n\nYou can also set a specific percentage:\nxbacklight -set 100\n\nSometimes, an increment or percentage change may have no effect.  This is because the hardware only allows specific settings, and the closest setting to the percentage selected is used.\nIncidentally, I happily found out that even though this is a more low-level program that is making the change, KDE still recognizes that the screen brightness has changed and displays the brightness percentage appropriately.  :-)\n\nA: Since you haven't specified which desktop environment you use, I'll provide some KDE-specific details as well.\nI've just updated KDE to 4.9.2 and met with the same inconvenience. I decided to dig into the code, and here are my conclusions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Brightness is actually controlled by kernel itself. According to KDE's PowerDevil source code, there exist two basic ways for kernels to provide control interface:\n\n*\n\n*sysctl() system call (likely on *BSD systems, I suppose)\n\n*sysfs interface (likely Linux)\n\n\n*sysfs interface is located at /sys/class/backlight/*your_backlight_type*/. Here's what it looks like for me:\n$ ls -1 /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/\nactual_brightness\nbl_power\nbrightness\ndevice\nmax_brightness\npower\nsubsystem\ntype\nueventTwo files are relevant for us now:  brightness and max_brightness. And here's how they can be used:\n$ cd /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight\n$ cat max_brightness \n976\n$ cat brightness \n176\n$ echo 77 | sudo tee brightness\n77\nFirst command lets you determine the maximum brightness you can set (the minimum is always zero). Second one lets you know what value the actual brightness is set to. And with the third you can set it to any value you desire in the range of [0; max_brightness].\n\n*KDE's KRunner still has the freedom to set any brightness level. Press Alt-F2 and type:\n\nscreen brightness 17\n\n\n*KDE's keyboard Brightness Up and Brightness Down key handling code has increment value of 10% hard-coded. Hence, unless you want to mess with building KDE from sources, there's nothing you can do with it.\n\n*KDE's BatteryMonitor plasmoid  has its own brightness control, whose increment is also hard-coded as 10%, but now we're lucky enough, since it is written in QML: $ sudo nano /usr/share/kde4/apps/plasma/plasmoids/battery/contents/ui/PopupDialog.qml (upd: in KDE 4.11 it has been moved to BrightnessItem.qml), navigate to section that looks likeComponents.Slider {\n        id: brightnessSlider\n        minimumValue: 0\n        maximumValue: 100\n        stepSize: 10\n        onValueChanged: brightnessChanged(value)\n    }and change the step size to what you desire. After relogin you'll see the change.\n\n\nA: Fine-grained control with hardware brightness switches\nFirstly, install xbacklight\n$ sudo apt install xbacklight\n\nSecondly, check whether you have control over the backlight.\n$ xbacklight -1\n$ xbacklight +5\n\nShould these commands result in a No outputs have backlight property error,\nthen follow these remediating steps before proceeding.\nOnce xbacklight -1 and xbacklight +1 work from the command line, proceed with assigning these commands to respectively the XF86MonBrightnessDown and XF86MonBrightnessUp keys. This is done by hitting those keys when asked by the Settings → Keyboard → Application Shortcuts application.\nFinally, reboot for these changes to take effect.\n\n", "Q: I want to install php 5.3.9 in ubuntu 12.04 via apt-get - what repository should I add?

I tried using efibootmgr, and that shows as it it worked:\nroot@kubuntu:~# efibootmgr \nBootCurrent: 0000\nBootOrder: 0000,0001\nBoot0000* EFI USB Device\nBoot0001* Windows Boot Manager\nroot@kubuntu:~# efibootmgr --create --gpt --disk /dev/sda --part 3 --write-signature --label \"GRUB2\" --loader \"\\\\EFI\\\\ubuntu\\\\grubx64.efi\" \nBootCurrent: 0000\nBootOrder: 0002,0000,0001\nBoot0000* EFI USB Device\nBoot0001* Windows Boot Manager\nBoot0002* GRUB2\nroot@kubuntu:~# efibootmgr\nBootCurrent: 0000\nBootOrder: 0002,0000,0001\nBoot0000* EFI USB Device\nBoot0001* Windows Boot Manager\nBoot0002* GRUB2\n\nHowever, on rebooting, as you guessed, the machine rebooted directly back into Windows. \nThe only things I can think of are:\n\n\n*\n\n*The sda1 partition is somehow being used\n\n*Overwrite /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi and /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi with grubx64.efi [but this seems really radical]. \n\n\nCan anyone please help me out? Thanks -- any help is greatly appreciated, as this issue is driving me crazy! \n\nA: First, you don't have two ESPs. An ESP is a partition with a partition type code of C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B, which parted identifies as a partition with its \"boot flag\" set. Your output indicates that only /dev/sda3 has its \"boot flag\" set, so you've got only one ESP -- /dev/sda3. Under GPT, partitions can have names, and you've got two partitions with the name \"EFI system partition,\" but these names are used for human identification purposes only. Thus, my guess is that you (or some automatic utility) created a /dev/sda1 with the intent of making it an ESP, but either there was an error in setting its partition type code or some other utility improperly changed its type code from C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B to something else.\nThere are a number of ways you can correct this. The simplest is to just change the name of /dev/sda1 to avoid confusion. If you think that /dev/sda1 serves no purpose, you could back it up and delete it. This will get it out of the way and avoid confusion, but of course you'll then have 273 MB of unused disk space. Alternatively, you could devote the space to some other purpose, if necessary changing the name and type code to avoid confusion. EFI explicitly allows multiple ESPs, so you could change the type code (by setting the \"boot flag\" using parted, for instance) and use both ESPs; but this could be confusing.\nChances are that this issue is unrelated to your inability to boot Linux, since it sounds like all the relevant files are on /dev/sda3. Several possible reasons for this problem occur to me:\n\n\n*\n\n*It could be you've mistyped something in your efibootmgr command. I don't see any obvious typos, but if the GRUB binary isn't located where you've specified, the command won't work. The \"--gpt\" and \"--write-signature\" options are almost certainly unnecessary, and could conceivably be causing problems, but most likely aren't.\n\n*Your firmware could have a bug that's causing the efibootmgr command's effects to be temporary. Try rebooting and then type \"sudo efibootmgr -v\" to see if the entry you created has survived a reboot.\n\n*Your firmware could have a bug that's causing the boot order variable to be ignored. I've got a motherboard like that; it boots in the order in which the boot entries are created, rather than the order in which they're specified by the BootOrder variable. To work around this bug, you would have to delete all the entries and re-create them in the boot order you want to use.\n\n*Your grubx64.efi binary could be damaged in such a way that the firmware refuses to launch it, and so it goes on to the next item in the boot order.\n\n\nYou can try adjusting your efibootmgr command, locate a new binary, or whatnot to test these possibilities. If all else fails, I recommend you do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete all the boot entries using efibootmgr or your firmware (if it provides an interface to do this).\n\n*Copy grubx64.efi to EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi on the ESP.\n\n*If when you reboot you still get Windows, rename EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi to EFI/Microsoft/bootmgfw.efi.\n\n\nThis should get GRUB booting using the default name for the boot loader (EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi). One problem with this is that GRUB might not have a working entry for Windows. You can probably create one manually; an entry like this should work:\nmenuentry \"Windows 7\" {\n    set root='(hd0,gpt3)'\n    chainloader /EFI/Microsoft/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nAlternatively, you could install rEFIt or rEFInd as EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi. Note that the rEFIt binaries available from its site won't work on UEFI-based PCs; you'll need to use the version in the Ubuntu repositories. rEFInd is a fork of rEFIt with numerous bug fixes and updates, including better UEFI support. (rEFIt seems to have been abandoned about two years ago.) Thus, I recommend using rEFInd rather than rEFIt -- but I'm rEFInd's maintainer, so I'm not an independent observer on this score. Unfortunately, AFAIK rEFInd isn't (yet) included in the Ubuntu repositories, so you'll have to download and install it manually.\n\nA: Same starting position here on a new sony vaio e series.\nThanks Rod for your answer.\nJust in case someone needs a walkthrough, this is what worked for me:\nInstalled ubuntu 12.04 from USB alongside win7. \nmounting /dev/sda3 from live-session \n\n\n*\n\n*copy EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi to EFI/Boot/\n\n*rename EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi to bootx64.efi.old\n\n*rename EFI/Boot/grubx64.efi to bootx64.efi\n\n\nnow it booted directly into grub2, but without win7 entry\nafter loading ubuntu I edited\n/etc/grub.d/40_custom\nadding\nmenuentry \"Windows 7\" {\n    set root='(hd0,gpt3)'\n    chainloader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n}\n\nand after\nsudo update-grub\n\neverything works fine\n\nA: I was eventually able to solve this. I replaced the EFI/Microsoft/boot/bootmgfw.efi with the grub64.efi. I renamed the former to bootmgfw.efi.old and used grub to add a menu option to chainload into it.\nThis implies that the firmware is hardcoded to look for the microsoft windows bootloader, and does not respect efibootmgr settings, or startup.nsh. That's really terrible.\nI found out how the Sony EFI boot process works:\n\n\n*\n\n*Look in /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/fwbootmgr.efi; if present, boot it.\n\n*Look in all sub-directories of /EFI/ for grubx64.efi.  If present, boot it.\n\n*Boot /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi\n\n*Display an error message, such as \"Operating System not found\".\n\n\nUnder Linux, the efibootmgr tool does work, but it displays a lot of auto-generated nonsense, including the last USB drive you've used.\nHere's how I learned all this:\n\n\n*\n\n*I opened up my new machine and collapsed the Windows partition in order to install Linux and Mac side by side.\n\n*I installed Ubuntu 12.10 and the installer overwrote fwbootmgr.efi, backing up the old Windows bootloader.\n\n*I restored the old Windows bootloader, but couldn't boot anything except Windows.\n\n*I renamed the Windows bootloader to something bogus, and then the Grub BL took over.\n\n*I renamed the ubuntu directory to something else, and Grub still loaded, even though I had install rEFInd.\n\n*The only way I could get rEFInd to do what I wanted was this:\n\n*Move fwbootmgr.efi to its parent directory; rEFInd will still find it, and Windows won't complain that you renamed it.\n\n*Rename grubx64.efi to rfgrubx64.efi or something else recognizable.\n\n*Copy rEFInd from /EFI/refind to /EFI/boot, rename /EFI/refind_x64.efi to *.bak, and lastly rename /Boot/refind_x64.efi to bootx64.efi.  You should now be able to boot the Windows BL or GRUB from rEFInd.  I plan to upgrade my MacOS install to Clover, and load Clover from rEFInd as well.\n\n\n(Perhaps it is possible to use the Windows Boot Manager to do all this, but EeasyBCD's EFI support is still a mess in my experience.  I refuse to touch it again for a while.)\n\nA: I suggest two different alternatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't overwrite windows mbr but use it to launch grub\n\n*change bios settings (f2 or f3 at startup) in boot options from UEFI to LEGACY, then it will normally launch the last system installed as ever\n\nA: *\n\n*Run Boot-Repair from a liveCD/liveUSB\n\n*Click the Recommended Repair button. (this will automatically install correct parameters for grub-efi, including SecureBoot parameters if needed, and renaming the EFI files in case the UEFI firmware is locked to Windows files).

Recently I downloaded Ubuntu 12.04 and burned the ISO image on a new blank DVD. After successfully burning DVD, I booted from the DAD. Ubuntu interface appeared asking me to either choose try Ubuntu or install Ubuntu. I chose to install Ubuntu. Again on next screen I choose to install Ubuntu inside Windows 7. After pressing continue button the following message appeared: \n  checking battery state .............. ok\n   checking for running unattended upgrades :\n                                                acpid : exiting\nspeech dispatcher disabled ; edit /etc/default/ speech -dispatcher \n\n* Asking all remaining processes to terminate ............. ok \n\nPlease remove installation media and close the tray (if any) then press enter : \n\nNow the problem is that when I remove the installation media (i.e. the DVD) and press enter then instead of installing Ubuntu the computer reboots into Windows 7!\nI am a newbie to Ubuntu and therefore do not know much about it. What should I do?\n\nA: I had the same problem installing Ubuntu 12.04 alongside Windows 7. In my case it was not the CD. I tried to install with several versions of Ubuntu and using USB or CD.  \nIn my case the problem was fixed when I deleted the partition I made in windows prior to installation of Ubuntu. I don't know what was wrong but I just deleted it and allowed Ubuntu do it's own partition at the moment of installation. Maybe someone will find this useful.\n\nA: Reading your post, you choose \"I choose to install ubuntu inside windows 7.\" I take that to mean that you were attempting a Wubi install.  Many others have opined that the Wubi method is not stable.\nOthers have noticed that \"install alongside Windows\" option isn't available.  I don't have evidence for your situation, but I suspect that option might not be available if Windows 7 is already using 4 primary partitions.\nI recommend\n\n*\n\n*Boot with the Ubuntu 12.04LTS or favorite installation CD, and choose \"Try Ubuntu\" from the menu.  From here, backup any Windows documents, videos...everything to an external drive or DVD-R (really anything).  Many people prefer to backup using a disk image.\n\n*Restart your computer with the disk in, and let Ubuntu replace Windows 7.  (UNLESS you require having access to a windows 7 machine sometimes)  The installer will handle the rest.\n\nMany users will use a WINE compatibility program to run windows program on their Ubuntu machines so that they don't have to dual-boot, but WINE won't work for everything.\n\nA: Reinstalling the GRUB2 boot loader to the Master Boot Record usually solves this problem. It probably didn't get installed properly the first time. The rest of your Ubuntu system is most likely already set up correctly.\nUbuntu's community documentation explains various methods of reinstalling GRUB2 to your MBR.\n\nA: I think there is something wrong with your installer. It might not have been burned to the CD properly. \nThe message you received is what I received when shutting down after the OS install. So if you receive that message immediately after you pressed \"Continue\" from choosing to install alongside Windows 7, you haven't really installed Ubuntu yet and hence you boot up to Windows.\n\nA: NTFS doesn't support more than 3 primary partitions. Use software like \"EaseUs Partition manager\" and check for the \"Partition type\".\nIf you have more than 3 primary make any one (other than windows installed drive) to logical by right clicking on the drive.\nReboot the system and install ubuntu. This worked for me.\n\nA: Don't ever do that again, installing Ubuntu right from the boot menu. The best way to install Ubuntu in a dual-boot configuration with Windows is to boot into the live session with your Ubuntu DVD or USB (choose Try Ubuntu instead of Install Ubuntu from the boot menu).\nOnce you are in the live session, all you have to do is to make sure you have an Internet connection running, and after that you can start the Live Ubuntu installer from the desktop. Choose the 3rd option provided by the installer which is Something else and when you get to the partition table you can use some raw partition at your choice, dividing it into 2 partitions, one large partition for root, and another small partition (up to 2GB in size) for Linux swap. You can format your root partition as Linux ext4 and choose foreslash / as startup or mount point. \nThen you can select your root partition and press Next to begin installing Ubuntu. One last piece of advice, no matter how powerful your machine is, choose Ubuntu 12.04.4 32bit version instead of the 64bit version. It is the best choice if you want to go with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS in dual boot with Windows.\n", "Q: Should I attach the Ubuntu ISO file to the virtual IDE Controller? Steps 31-47 of this guide to install Ubuntu on a virtual machine (using VirtualBox) describe how to attach the Ubuntu instal ISO image file to the IDE Controller of the virtual machine. \nThis has not been mentioned or explained in any of the YouTube tutorials I watched on installing Ubuntu to  a VirtualBox VM. I have no idea what it is doing or what it means. Is this a necessary step? What does attaching the Ubuntu ISO file to an IDE Controller mean? \nThe CD icon on my VirtualBox Manager under the IDE Controller section in the Storage setting shows a CD that reads \"Empty\" at the moment, which is the same as how it is in the guide before they change it to be lined with the Ubuntu ISO file.  \n\nA: It means that this is needed to let Virtual Box know where to install from, so it is a necessary step.  Attaching the ISO to IDE, will simulate having a physical CD in the CD Drive.\nOnce you get to the last screen of creating the Virtual Machine, and Click on Create, you will\n\nSee the screen where you have the option of choosing where to boot from \n\nClick on Empty, and then click on the little down arrow on CD icon to the right of the drop down box that gives you the option to choose a CD/DVD Drive or virtual drive \n\nYou will see a drop-down menu that will let you choose where the installation medium is located.  Click on Choose a virtual CD/DVD disk file \nChoose you file, and then click Open. \n\nOnce done you can start your virtual machine, wich in turn will start the installation.\n\nA: It is an absolutely essential step if you want to install Ubuntu on your virtual machine!\nYou're attaching the ISO to the virtual CD drive which is connected to the IDE controller (not directly to the controller). To the virtual machine, this step will make it look like an actual Ubuntu CD was inserted into its optical drive. It will then attempt to boot from it, and you can run the LiveCD, install, etc. within the virtual environment. \n\nA: Everyone's answers are great, I just wanted to more specifically answer your question:\n\nWhat does attaching the Ubuntu ISO file to an IDE Controller mean?\n\nIDE stands for Integrated Drive Electronics created in 1986 but now most computers use SATA to connect to hard drives. Now in VirtualBox you'll see a Controller: SATA there as well! At first, I thought the I in IDE stood for Interface b/c that is what it is. Here's a picture for visual learners: \nThe file you place or connect to the Controller: IDE is the virtual version of placing a cd in a computer, then booting up. In the old days, people would often boot a new OS from a CD, which is essentially loading whatever iso file is on that CD into RAM. From there you have a running OS! \nA boot device could be a hard drive, floppy disk drive, or CD-ROM and the way we typically connect to these devices is through an IDE or SATA interface (cable if you want the eli5 version). I suppose the creators of this portion of VirtualBox used IDE for nostalgic purposes? Or to create a nice visual? For new students, they often confuse IDE with 'integrated development environment' programmers use to write code but this is not related at all. \nSo what do you attach to the IDE controller?\nI really like this analogy from lifewire: \n\nThink of an ISO file like a box that holds all the parts to something that needs to be built — like a child's toy you might buy that requires assembly. The box that the toy pieces come in does you no good as an actual toy but the contents inside of it, once taken out and put together, become what you're actually wanting to use.\n\nThis means an iso file doesn't HAVE to be an operating system, these files are similar to a zip file but uncompressed. I know bootable antivirus programs are in an iso format. Like the analogy above, all the components to make something work is in this file, and if bootable, has a special set of code that begins to run to utilize all these components in the iso file.\nInterestingly, you can use software like 7 Zip to extract files from an ISO image. Creating them is easy, but relatively tough to modify the data already in one. Since we are on an Ubuntu forum, imagine the Ubuntu iso you downloaded as having the Linux kernel, but many more folders/files/drivers/executables that make Ubuntu different(and similar in some ways) from the other distros; say Manjaro, CentOS, the list goes on and on. \n", "Q: A tinkered PC resets its nameserver (resolv.conf) on each boot The Ubuntu 11.10 PC resets resolv.conf on each boot, only with a comment remaining.\nHow do I fix this by setting the persistent storage?\nIt was tinkered by somebody else and I (and him!) cant trace his actions.

First thing in the morning I started Ubuntu, and the Chrome browser. In the browser I visited a page with a password-field on it. So the password-ring popped up. Then a dialog popped up asking for a password in order to send a bug report about the system. Then the ususal bug-report dialog showed up. (Something about Gud & color)\nI am not sure about the exact order of dialogs.\nIs the extra question for a password for a bug report normal behaviour?\n\nA: Sometimes, but not usually.\nReporting Crashes in System Processes\nMost of the time when an application crashes or you report a bug manually, you don't have to put in a password for information to be automatically gathered and sent to Launchpad.\nHowever, when a program or service that runs as root crashes, collecting data about that crash requires accessing data that is only accessible as root. In Ubuntu, you can perform actions as root by authenticating with your password, provided that your account has administrative capabilities. (This is facilitated by sudo or one of its graphical frontends, or by PolicyKit.) If your account does not have administrative capabilities, then you will not be prompted to report a crash in a root-owned process until you log in with an account that has administrative capabilities.\nWhen you're logged in as an administrator and you're prompted to report a crash in a root-owned process, you see a password dialog like this:\n\nThis is one of the two situations where you may have to enter a password to report a bug in Ubuntu.\nOnce you've authenticated, then the crash-reporting process continues the same way as for regular non-root processes.\nFiling Bug Reports for Crashes\nBefore Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, when Apport crash reporting was enabled, you would be asked to submit a bug report to contain the data gathered automatically. This is still what happens in alpha and beta versions of Ubuntu (and versions before 12.04 LTS). But starting with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Apport is set up by default so that, if you are running a stable version of Ubuntu and a crash occurs, it will automatically (with your permission) submit the information to a database that doesn't require you to fill out a bug report. This is potentially less useful than having a bug report, but it means that information can effectively be gathered from many more users--plus, bug reports are often most valuable for alpha and beta releases where the bugs are more likely to be fixed as a result of the report.\nHowever, if you re-enable bug filing for crashes, or you report a bug by invoking ubuntu-bug manually with a package name or process ID, then you will be given the opportunity to file a bug report. Bug reports in Ubuntu are filed on Launchpad. So once data for the bug are collected and submitted to Launchpad, a Launchpad page to file the bug report with those data automatically attached will appear in a web browser. (Unless your default web browser doesn't work and that's what the bug is about, of course.)\nIf you're not logged in to Launchpad, then you'll be brought to the Launchpad sign-in page in your web browser, to report the bug. This is the second of the two situations where you may have to enter a password, to report a bug in Ubuntu.\n\n", "Q: Internet not working in LAN, Ubuntu 11.10 I have two Ethernet cards.

I read in another question here somewhere that a user did sudo -H gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf and put in Acquire::http::proxy \"http://user:pass@proxy:port\" even though he didn't use a username and a password for the proxy and it worked for him.\nI DO need to enter a username and a password, and my actual username and password entered in that string wouldn't work, BUT when I just put in the actual words user:pass the Software Center started working!\n\nA: Enter this command in terminal\nsudo -H gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf\n\nAdd a line to the file as below:\nAcquire::http::Proxy\"http://user:password@proxy:port\";\n\nfor example\nAcquire::http::Proxy\"http://ravi:bnmp123@192.20.40.257:80\";\n\nUser and password are internet user id and password. You can do it in the same way for https, ftp, etc\n\nA: I also had the same problem... my proxy was 10.x.xxx.xxx and port xxxx and no userid and pass was required..i just turned off Airplane mode > dash>network and now everything is working fine\n\nA: Same problem in 14.04 - however the configuration is different (there is no 01proxy file nor commented out proxy info in the configuration), in directory\n/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/\n\nI added a file named 40proxy with contents:\nAcquire::http::proxy \"http://user:password@proxy:port\"; \n\nWhere I replaced the proxy with my proxy name and port number, this solved issue, and enabled Software Center to work (actually install packages).\n", "Q: Why is Ubuntu reporting a slightly different size for my Virtualbox disk? I'm installing Ubuntu in a VM using VirtualBox; I selected the dynamic expansion option (as opposed to fixed) in VirtualBox and set the limit to 85GB. Then, when I was installing Ubuntu, the virtual disk I created for it states it is 91.3GB. Did I make a mistake somewhere or is this difference normal? If it is normal, why does it exist? Thank you.\n\nA: Yes, this is normal.\nThis is happening because, unfortunately, in practice, the word \"gigabyte\" can refer to two different units of digital information storage.\nStrictly speaking, these days, a gigabyte (GB) is formally defined as exactly one billion bytes, and similarly, a megabyte (MB) is exactly one million bytes and a kilobyte (kB) is exactly one thousand bytes.\nHowever, using powers of two is more convenient for many purposes, and 210 is 1024, which is pretty close to 103. So historically, and in many instances today, people say \"kilobyte\" to mean 1024 bytes, \"megabyte\" to mean 1024 \"kilobytes\", and gigabyte to mean 1024 \"megabytes.\"\nThis is the distinction between \"decimal\" and \"binary\" kilobytes/megabytes/gigabytes/terabytes/etc.\nThese days, we have separate unit names and symbols formally defined for the units that scale by factors of 1024 rather than 1000: A kibibyte (KiB, and informally a \"binary kilobyte\") is 1024 bytes, a mebibyte (MiB, \"binary megabyte\") is 1024 kibibytes, a gibibyte (GiB, \"binary gigabyte\") is 1024 kibibytes, a tebibyte (TiB, \"binary terabyte\") is 1024 gibibytes, and so forth.\nWhat's happening is that, apparently, VirtualBox is showing you storage capacity in units of gibibytes, while Ubuntu's installer shows it in units of (decimal) gigabytes.\nSee this article for more details and historical information.\n", "Q: /usr/bin/make overwritten accidentally I am extremely new to Ubuntu and Linux in general. I accidentally replaced /usr/bin/make with another executable and now I need to fix this.

I have used gtk-recordMyDesktop to make a video as an OGV file using the default settings. I need to do 3 things: \n\n\n*\n\n*How can I reduce the screen resolution (height and width) so that it can fit into a smaller video size on my website?\n\n*How can I pull out like every third frame so that the file size is not so large, yet not mess up the sound?\n\n*Not all Windows IE users can view OGV files. How can I convert to FLV (or, as a fallback, MP4) so that I can share on my blog?\n\nA: You can resize and convert with ffmpeg using ffmpeg -i input.ogv -s widthxheight -sameq output.flv. You can also change the video bit rate with -b:v bitarate and control the frame rate with -r framerate to reduce the size of outcome. As izx has mentioned the bit rate option is recommended over changing frame rate or dropping frames.\n\nA: You can use Avidemux\n\n\nAvidemux is a free video editor used mainly for simple cutting,\n  filtering and encoding tasks. It is often dubbed as the VirtualDub for\n  Linux as it can do many things that VirtualDub can do. It supports\n  many files types, including avi, DVD compatible mpeg files, mp4, asf\n  and even the not-so-common ogm and matroska format.\nSome of the useful features of Avidemux include a simple WYSIWYG\n  interface, easy conversion from one format to another, plenty of\n  filtering effects and a built-in subtitles processing capabilities.\n\nSource: USC\nYou can also use Pitivi Video Editor\n\nAdding a Screencast / Video Clip into Pitivi\n\nIn order to add video clips into your Pitivi project, simply click on\n  IMPORT CLIPS and select the appropriate video file.

I'm using Ubuntu 11.10, and when running in GNOME Classic I no longer see an icon for the nm-applet in the top panel.  However the applet is running:\njsteele@jsteele-00:~$ ps aux | grep nm-applet\njsteele   2767  0.0  0.2 454584 16576 ?

Ideally I would like an icon to be visible.\nIn Unity the nm-applet icon is present and operates as I would expect - is this a compatibility issue between Unity and GNOME Classic?\n(Possibly similar to this question, but doesn't indicate that the applet is still operational and sufficiently different for me to raise this separate question; equally there isn't an answer that resolves the issue for me:\nNetwork Manager icon doesn't appear in top panel)\n\nA: *\n\n*I believe this demonstrates the \"invisible nm-applet\" problem you're experiencing:\n\n\n\n*Running nm-applet from the terminal gave me this debug information, which leads me to believe that the behavior you see is a side effect of this known bug regarding visibility of the nm-applet indicator in non-Unity environments.

How do I correctly install Ubuntu 12.04 in UEFI mode on this machine???\n\nA: Well,\nIt seems the HP ProBook firmware is broken or i need to find a way to re-create the\nHP_TOOLS partition and add some obscure HP-configuration tool\nI now have a booting system.\nI did copy\n/boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi\n\nto \n/boot/efi/EFI/boot/bootx64.efi\n\nand the system works.\nI still don't get how I can physically change the NVRAM to accept ubuntu settings.\n\nA: It sounds like you've installed Ubuntu on the SSD but it will only boot by manually selecting the boot loader in the firmware's boot manager. If this is incorrect, please clarify. I'll proceed under the assumption that I've correctly summarized the situation.\nYou should first check your boot settings by booting manually and typing sudo efibootmgr -v. This will produce output resembling the following:\n$ sudo efibootmgr -v\nTimeout: 10 seconds\nBootOrder: 0000,0007,0006,0008\nBoot0000* Ubuntu    HD(2,1b8,64000,f1b7598e-baa8-16ea-4ef6-3ff3b606ac1e)File(\\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi)\nBoot0006* Hard Drive    BIOS(2,0,00)SATA: ST32000542AS            .\nBoot0007* CD/DVD Drive  BIOS(3,0,00)PATA: HP DVD Writer 1040r     .\nBoot0008* INTERNAL EFI SHELL: ST32000542AS  ACPI(a0341d0,0)PCI(1f,2)ATAPI(1,0,0)HD(2,1b8,64000,f1b7598e-baa8-16ea-4ef6-3ff3b606ac1e)File(\\EFI\\BOOT\\BOOTX64.EFI)\n\nDetails are likely to be different for you. This example shows the Boot0000 variable points to a GRUB boot loader file (\\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi), and specified on the BootOrder line as being the first boot loader.\nIf you don't see an entry for GRUB, you can try to create one with efibootmgr:\nsudo efibootmgr -c -l \\\\EFI\\\\ubuntu\\\\grubx64.efi -L Ubuntu\n\nThis example creates a new entry for the /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi boot loader on the ESP and gives it the name \"Ubuntu\". Note that you must specify the boot loader program name relative to the ESP's root directory, and you must use doubled-up backslashes (\\\\) rather than Linux-style forward slashes (/) to separate directory elements. You may also need to add more options if your ESP isn't /dev/sda1. (See the efibootmgr man page for details.)\nIf you've got an entry for GRUB, then it sounds like your firmware is broken and isn't using the NVRAM entries. It's probably looking for a boot loader using a default filename on the ESP -- probably /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi, or perhaps /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi. You should be able to copy grubx64.efi from wherever it's located (probably /EFI/ubuntu) to one of those default names to get it to launch automatically.\n\nA: If you are not EFI booting Windows 7 and you are already trying to use grub EFI, you may copy everything from /boot/grub/ to HP_TOOLS/Microsoft/Boot/ and rename grub.efi to bootmgfw.efi. When you do this, you can boot grub_efi from the OS Boot Manager selection on the HP boot selection menu. This is actually pretty hackish but it works for me since Windows will boot automatically and Ubuntu can be launched using the EFI BIOS selection with minimal user input.\nI primarily use Ubuntu, but in my line of work I find myself using Windows more often since they use the poorer choice for their operating environment of which I need to support. If you're in a similar situation this hack may suit you as well.\n", "Q: SSD Tweaks for Ubuntu 12.04 \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I optimize the OS for SSDs? \n\nI need to tweak my Dell XPS 13z SSD for maximum performance and life cycle than I read the solutions explained here, but it is for 11.10 and my fstab is different. \nFor now my fstab is looks like this:\n    proc            /proc           proc    nodev,noexec,nosuid 0       0\n# / was on /dev/sda1 during installation\nUUID=abf5ce9e-bdb7-4b2f-a7bd-bbd9efa72a98 /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n# /home was on /dev/sda2 during installation\nUUID=491427b2-7482-4483-b6eb-7c564b991aff /home           ext4    defaults        0       2\n# swap was on /dev/sda3 during installation\n#UUID=7551000d-e708-4e0f-9fd2-9f93119f63fb none            swap    sw              0       0\n/dev/mapper/cryptswap1 none swap sw 0 0\ntmpfs     /tmp         tmpfs      mode=1777\n\nAnd my rc.local is looks like this:\necho noop > /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler\necho deadline > /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler\necho 1 > /sys/block/sda/queue/iosched/fifo_batch\n\nexit 0\n\nDo you have any suggestions, what should I do?\nRegards\n\nA: \nThere are lots of tips out there for tweaking your SSD in Linux and\n  lots of anecdotal reports on what works and what doesn’t.

You can find an installation guide also in the wiki.\n\nIf you've already compiled this from SVN, try adding the --ignore-negative-one argument to your injection command.\nTo have Gerix do that for you, you're going to need to open the script and look for where it calls aireplay (et al).\n\nA: Check if your driver is compatible.\nAnd have a look in the aircrack-ng wiki for the channel-1 issue\nhttp://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compat-wireless\n\nA: Recently I was commissioned to teach someone how to crack wifi, the pc used to perform the wireless audit was Ubuntu 12.04.  I had this same issue but was able to overcome the problem by updating the kernel from 3.2 to 3.6. This fixed the problem.  I tried a patch and that was unsuccessful.  Best of luck, should solve your issues.\n", "Q: Wireless Connection Troubles I just recently switched from Windows 7 over to Ubuntu 12.04 and have been experiencing some issues connecting to my home's wireless network. \nThe only way I can get it to connect to the network is by disabling IPv4 and IPv6 settings. Even then while it says its connected to the network (3 bars), I'm unable to access the Internet. \nIt connected for a little while after I first installed Ubuntu, but after the first reboot I haven't been able to access the web at all. I have very basic knowledge when it comes to computers and barely any when dealing with Ubuntu and Linux. \nI'm very happy with Ubuntu apart from this one issue, as before my computer was overheating and crashing, I've yet to experience any of those problems since installing Ubuntu. The information I can give may be very limited since I'm having to use my cell phone to figure out the solution to this. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: I got it figured out. I disabled IPv4 and got it connected to the device, then found out the IP, subnet, gateway, and DNS in terminal using ifconfig and route -n then put them in manually and now everything works fine. Can't believe it took me several days to find out something so simple! Anyway, I look forward to using and learning about Ubuntu for years to come. So glad I don't have to deal with all the hassle that comes with Windows anymore. Hope everyone has a wonderful day!\n", "Q: Is there a way to get a separate desktop/Gnome terminal for each user logged in through VNC? Is there a way to get a separate desktop/Gnome terminal for each user logged in through VNC? I want to be able to have several people working simultanously on the same machine in Ubuntu.\n\nA: You need xinetd and vnc4server, which allows a very elegant solution. I have installed this on a large server at my college and use it as a virtual hardware lab. \nThe server has a number of vnc ports open, each with a resolution configured. If a user connects to the port, a new vnc sesssion is created and the graphical login screeen is shown. I have added the configuration for xinetd as well in the post below.\nFind all details here: http://blog.epr.ch/2012/10/elegant-solution-for-remotely-accessible-vnc-desktops/\n\nA: You can start a new X11 session on your desktop by first switching to a new virtual console with Ctrl+Alt+Fn and then starting X-server with startx -- :n where n is display number starting from 1. Then start /usr/lib/vino/vino-server. Then remote users can connect to your other X11-session with vinagre host:n, you can change to your display with Ctrl+Alt+F[n] then.\n", "Q: Cannot turn off password \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhy does Ubuntu force users to create a password upon installation? \n\nCannot authenticate without a password It did not fix my problem. If I create an admin account without password in the first place, what should I enter in place of the password? Also, how to perform administrative actions (such as sudo or downloading apps from Ubuntu Software Center) without password? How to remove the password entirely from my admin accounts?\nNote: In Windows 7, when you do not set a password or remove the existing password for an administrator, that administrator can be used to authenticate without a password. Leave the password blank and you can do anything.\n\nA: This is a security feature. If your administrator (or 'root') account didn't have a password, it would be ridiculously easy for a virus or other malicious program to cause a lot of trouble. So, really, you shouldn't try to disable it.\nIf you're doing a lot of stuff using sudo in one terminal, you can always use sudo su - to go into administrator mode in that terminal, and then omit sudo in that session.\n\nA: You should use a password! But if you want to avoid retyping it during a session (e.g. sudo) then try this\nvisudo\nadd the following line \n admin      ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nSave and quit. This allows the user admin to run everything (sudo apt-get ...) without password\nIf you want that for a whole group of accounts, add them to a group, e.g. admin and visudo again this time with this line\n%admin      ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nThis means any member of the admin GROUP is allowed to do everything without password.\n", "Q: Adjust mouse keys in 12.04? I checked under keyboard and there is no option to adjust \"Mouse Keys\". I turned it on under \"Universal Access\", but there was no option to adjust sensitivity or acceleration there. Under \"Mouse and Touchpad\", there were two tabs, one for a touchpad and one for a mouse, neither of which affected \"Mouse Keys\". Anybody have any idea where the devs decided to put the options in precise?\n\nA: This is more of a workaround than an answer to your question. You can use xkbset to adjust the speed of the cursor when using the mouse keys feature. The idea came from this post:\nhttp://www.exuro.co.uk/2012/07/114/\nThe setting I found most comfortable was:\nxkbset ma 60 10 10 5 2\n\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: boot failure after upgrade ubuntu 12.04 My laptop cannot boot up after I upgrade ubuntu 12.04.

I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 on a laptop, I was wondering if there is a way to get notified when the battery become full.\n\nA: This feature was present on old gnome2, but mising from latest gnome.Gnome power manager is supposed to give notification when battery is full, but it doesn't(It could be a bug). I couldn't find any option with dconf either.To me it appears that the only way to achieve this through a cron job which regulary checks whether battery is full or not.\nFirst open terminal & type ls /proc/acpi/battery/. In my case, the output is C241. Your could be different(generally batt0 ot batt1).Also check the type of ac adapter,ls /proc/acpi/ac_adapter. Its C240 for me. Open gedit & copy the following script.\nRemember to replace C241 & C240 with your battery type & ac adapter.\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd ~/.scripts\nnotification=$(grep 'notification:' notification|awk '{print $2}')\n\ncd /proc/acpi/ac_adapter/C240;\npower=$(grep 'state:' state|awk '{print $2}')\ns1=\"$power\"\n\ns2=\"charged\"\ns3=\"on-line\"\ns4=\"on\"\n\nexport DISPLAY=:0\n\nif [ \"$s1\" = \"on-line\" ]; then\n  cd /proc/acpi/battery/C241;\n  state=$(grep 'charging state:' state|awk '{print $3}')\n  if [ $state = $s2 ] && [ \"$notification\" = \"$s4\" ];\n    then\n            notify-send  --urgency=critical \"Power Manager\" \"battery is full\" -i battery_full\n            echo \"notification: off\" >~/.scripts/notification\n\n    fi\n\nelse\n  if [ $notification != \"on\" ]; then\n    echo \"notification: on\" >~/.scripts/notification\n  fi\nfi\n\nsave the file as batteryfull.sh at ~/.scripts (or anywhere you like).\nMake the file executable chmod a+x batteryfull.sh. \nOn terminal type echo \"notification: on\" >~/.scripts/notification. Also add the same line at the end of your ~/.profile.\nInstall gnome-schedule (sudo apt-get install gnome-schedule).Launch it, choose new task & select \"a task that launches recuurently\". On command section put full path of the script file.In my case its ~/.scripts/batteryfull.sh.You can set corn-job duration every min or every 5 min.click apply.You can check running jobs by typing crontab -l in terminal.\n\nYou can run this script at every boot by adding gnome-schedule as a startup application(may not be required in your case).\nNote: This is probably not the perfect way to do this, but it works.So far this much i can do with my little knowledge with bash scripting.I will improve the script if i find something better.\n", "Q: Could I use Ubuntu One to sync my calendar? Is there a way (supported/unsupported or even in theory) that I can create a calendar on my desktop via Thunderbird's lightning extension then sync that calendar file with Ubuntu One and then sync that same file on my Android phone in a way that the calendar application on it can update the file (and sync it back to the Ubuntu One cloud).\n\nA: While I can't offer a solution concerning Ubuntu One, I can offer an alternative:\nRainlendar\nIt's unbelievably easy to install, use and configure.

Here's the problem(s) my drive only READS DVDs, if i put a blank in it, it will ignore it and my mac has the updated EFI, so no booting from a USB connected device! I also tried Wubi, but then i cant make it a FULL partition and get rid of windows!!! Thank you!\n\nA: If I understand, you want to download a new version of Ubuntu and put it on some media and boot from that media to install it to the whole disk on your Mac OS system. You are constrained in that the media you can write to you can't boot from and you can boot from the CD/DVD drive but have no means of writing one. Further, I assume you can't write a CD from that old PC running Ubuntu.\nIf all of that is correct, I can see three choices. (If it's not correct, please correct me by editing your question).\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy an Ubuntu 12.04 CD. Canonical has them here . At one time Canonical would give away single CD's on request but I don't see that on the Get Ubuntu part of the Ubuntu site anymore. The cost is about five pounds.\n\n*Get an Ubuntu CD from your LOCO (or maybe one nearby). If it's inconvenient to meet with LOCO members perhaps someone would mail you a CD. LOCO's are Ubuntu Local Community Teams. You can find LOCO's starting from here. A LOCO near me always seems to have extra CD's they give away. A LOCO is a good alternative for getting help and advice too. This would be my choice if I were in your situation.\nIn France, for example, please see this site.\n\n*As a final alternative, if you still have the old CD you used to install Ubuntu on that old PC, perhaps you could install from that CD onto your Mac, and then upgrade the system to 12.04. If you installed from USB, however, I see from your question that USB booting won't work.\n", "Q: Installing Age of Empires II using PlayOnLinux doesn't work?

the wubi installer (using a 15 Gb install size, presuming this was the amount it would use as its partition of the hard drive, but apparently it doesn't use a partition) on Windows 7. On reboot Ubuntu booted up without a dual boot menu. What can I do to get back into my Windows environment?\nI do use 2 hard drives with Windows files on the C: drive (along with music and photos) and the wubi installed on the D: drive (along with games and a back up of the Windows on the C: drive). Even when booting from C: drive it still boots up Ubuntu.\nI need a fix that does not involve reformatting either hard drive preferably, or perhaps I am just missing an obvious option in the Ubuntu environment.\n\nA: I had this problem with a Compaq computer, when you turn it on, change the boot-order and put the C:\\ Drive first\nYou can access this by pressing ESC when you turn on your computer, although im not sure if its equal for ALL computers, hope it helped!

I've started using zsh for my login shell.\nI've create an a ~/.zprofile, but in order for it to be put into effect, I have to manually source it.\nHow can I have my settings load automatically?\n\nA: Commands from ~/.zprofile are only read if the shell is a login shell. Did you set zsh as your default shell using cshsh or just in the preferences of the terminal emulator? If the former, logging out and back in should do the trick (although, the file will be only read when you actually perform the login, not when you start a new shell), or you have to tell your terminal emulator to execute the shell as a login shell. If you are using gnome-terminal, go to Edit->Profile Preferences, select the Title and command tab and check the Run command as a login shell box.\n", "Q: How to get Ubuntu Server installed from Ubuntu Minimal?

I am looking for an automated way similar to the one present in Ubuntu server distribution.\n\nA: That functionality is provided by tasksel (unsurprisingly, it's in the tasksel package):\nsudo apt-get install tasksel\nsudo tasksel\n\nthis will present you with a menu of options, such as:\n [*] OpenSSH server\n [ ] DNS server\n [ ] LAMP server\n [*] Mail server\n [ ] Openstack\n [ ] PostgreSQL database\n [*] Print server\n\nYou should then be able to select the ones you want, and tasksel will handle the package installation.\n", "Q: SQLite binary file does not work on my Ubuntu, I'm new to sqlite , I just got the binary of sqlite by using wget http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-shell-linux-x86-3071300.zip, then extract sqlite3 from the zip file, it does not work, it's driving me crazy, please HELP.\nMy OS is Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit, the steps of execution of sqlite as follows,\nu1@newhost:/tmp$ ls -hl sqli*\n-rwxrwxr-x 1 u1 u1 568K Jun 11 17:35 sqlite3\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 u1 u1 310K Jun 12 02:53 sqlite-shell-linux-x86-3071300.zip\nu1@newhost:/tmp$ file sqlite3\nsqlite3: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, BuildID[sha1]=0x8637c6613a485b675a05f155564cc0eda4b2d3cc, stripped\nu1@newhost:/tmp$ ./sqlite3 mydb.db\n-bash: ./sqlite3: No such file or directory\nu1@newhost:/tmp$\n\nFor security reason, I removed . from the $PATH, so I just use ./sqlite3 to launch\nUPDATE BELOW:\nthis way works for Fedora 15 32-bit\n[root@newhostfedora15 ~]# ./sqlite3 test.db\nSQLite version 3.7.13 2012-06-11 02:05:22\nEnter \".help\" for instructions\nEnter SQL statements terminated with a \";\"\nsqlite> .e\n\nthis also works on CentOS 5.6 64-bit\nBUT DOES NOT work for root on My Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit either,\nroot@newhost:~# unzip sqlite-shell-linux-x86-3071300.zip\nArchive:  sqlite-shell-linux-x86-3071300.zip\n  inflating: sqlite3\nroot@newhost:~# ./sqlite3 f\n-bash: ./sqlite3: No such file or directory\nroot@newhost:~# ldd ./sqlite3\n        not a dynamic executable\n\nI got this issue as the result, it works on Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit, CenetOS 5.6 64-bit, DOES NOT WORK on Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit, Fedora 17 64-bit, sqlite's 32-bit binary is great enough although it doesn't work for every platform. I'll keep it in mind that to it is best to compile my own 64-bit binary from the source or it will be awesome if sqlite 64-bit binary is provide through the official web-site :P \n\nA: With Ubuntu (as well as many other Linux distributions) the preferred method of installing software is to use the package management infrastructure. One tool for package management on Ubuntu is apt-get.\nFor example, to install sqlite3:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install sqlite3\n\nthis will download the official Ubuntu build of sqlite, and install it on your system. This way, you don't have to deal with the downloading yourself, or debugging problems with incompatible binary versions.\n[The first command, sudo apt-get update just downloads the most recent list of packages available. You don't need to do this every time you want to install a package]\nThen, you can just run sqlite3:\nsqlite3\n\n\nIn case you really want to run the non-packaged sqlite binary, you need to ensure you have all the necessary bits for your machine. The sqlite binary in the archive is a 32-bit dynamically linked executable (as you saw by running file), so we'll at least need a 32-bit dynamic linker, plus any necessary libraries.\nFor the dynamic linker, we need the i386 build of the libc6 package. You can install this with:\nsudo apt-get install libc6:i386\n\nThen, you should be able to run ldd on the binary to show what other libraries it may need. For example, on my system:\n[jk@pablo sqlite]$ ldd ./sqlite3 \nlinux-gate.so.1 =>  (0xf76f1000)\nlibdl.so.2 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0xf76c1000)\nlibc.so.6 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0xf750d000)\n/lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xf76f2000)\n\nSince all of those libraries are present (ldd will report not found if something is missing), we should be fine to run the sqlite3 command.\n", "Q: Is it possible to copy Wubi install to another computer? I am new to Ubuntu and Linux overall.

But I can't go through all the trouble and terminal and stuff. So I was wondering is there a way to copy my whole Ubuntu system (OS and all apps and files) and install them on my desktop? (so I have everything like I did on my netbook?) \n\nA: yup\n1 . Install wubi in new pc\n2 . Replace the ubuntu folder in the c:\\ drive with ubuntu folder in the previous wubi installation\nIf it wont work backup the data and packages using aptoncd ,install fresh wubi , :)\n\nA: You could migrate wubi to a real partition - as it stands it's a file within windows.\nThen clone that, seems like a lot of work given than the install is fairly short.\nYou could make backups of system files you have edited and copy them to the new install.\nYou could copy specific files from your /home folder to the new system - that is where all your personal configurations are.\nIf you copy your .bash_history file it will at least show you waht you had done in the wubi install.\nEdit - \nYou can in fact access the wubi files from a livecd.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide#How_can_I_access_my_Wubi_install_and_repair_my_install_if_it_won.27t_boot.3F\n\nA: You can boot your PC with the linux live cd or USB stick and then you will be easily able to install it in Graphical Interface mode.

I have to restart to get it back. When listing the /dev/ directory there is no /dev/video after wake. Is there a way to get it back without restarting since I practically use suspend instead shutdown?\n\nA: Suspend/wake events are handled by the pm-utils package.

I'm very used to use edge bindings in my workflow, but since I've updated to 12.04 Unity forget my edge bindings settings on every new session.\nWhy it is appening and how to fix it?\n\nA: Okay here it is.\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Why is it happening?\"\n\n\n*\n\n*It's a bug, already reported https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/752687\n\n\n*\"How to fix it?\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Here I'll share two answer, that solves my edge binding problem for my 12.04.But, it might not work on other computer.\nFirst\n\n\n*\n\n*One problem that I found is, python-compizconfig, which is Compizconfig bindings for python is not included with compizconfig-setting-manager.\n\n\n*\n\n*So you have to install it manually, or, it will be automatically installed with Ubuntu Tweak (That's why I recommend you Ubuntu Tweak).\n\n*With Ubuntu Tweak, you can find the edge binding settings under Tweak > Workspace.\n\nSecond\n\n\n*\n\n*Another one is taken from @sachinr's answer.\nAdd Compiz to the startup applications.\nName    : Compiz\nCommand : bash -c \"sleep 3; compiz --replace\"\n\nNow with those, my edge binding settings \"remembered\" whenever I start a new session.\n\nA: I think that the real problem is not that \"Unity dosn't remeber the bindings\" but rather that something is blocking the edge pixels from being reached. If you do anything that forces compiz to refresh the settings (enable or disable widget layer for example), the edges are working again. I think it's like that compiz is running but it is behind unity not on top (like an inactiv window i supose). \nThis explains the working solution for startup programs, because its runs again compiz and forces that refresh. \nI haven't thought so, i all i did to fix the problem was a restart with alt+f2 and runing compiz --replace command as soon as the desktop started. \nIn conclusion, something is blocking compiz edges, and stays on top, till you resfresh it in anyway.\nI like to believe it will be fixed, cause the edges is THE most amazing thing for ubuntu in general.\n", "Q: Difference between launching an application from a keyboard shortcut vs the terminal? What I have observed:\nWhen I type emacs in gnome-terminal, it launches in the same environment, with variables set in .bashrc. If I use a keyboard shortcut to the command emacs, it opens in an environment that does not have these variables. \nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a reason for this behaviour?\n\n*How can I get emacs to open in an environment with settings from .bashrc? \n\n*If I have root access, can I set these variables 'system-wide'?\n\n\nAdditional background: I need is to be able to access the variables from within R, as described in a related SO question (How to access a bash environment variable from within R in emacs), and I also need the path to my texlive distribution for Auctex. The present question is different in that I am more generally interested in the difference between launching emacs from within the terminal and launching emacs from the Applications menu, Gnome-do, or keyboard shortcut that call either emacs or /usr/bin/emacs23 %F.\n\nA: ~/.bashrc is usually read for secondary interactive shells after you log in. If you want to initialise your parameters on login the use ~/.profile instead. To apply you parameters system-wide use /etc/profile. It's the first file read by bash.To make things clearer I think I'd explain a bit more.\n\n\n*\n\n*When you login, your login shell reads first the global /etc/profile, then ~/.profile and parameters/variables mentioned there are initialised. However you don't see this shell as terminal because the X-window system GUI is running.\n\n*After login when you open a secondary terminal/terminal-emulator e.g. gnome-terminal ~/.bashrc is read and and the parameters/variables declared in it are available to the secondary terminal only. Note that this secondary terminal is a child process of your login shell.\n\n*When you launch an application from menu, it's executed as a child process of your login shell and it inherits the parameters from it's ancestor process. But .bashrc was not available for the main login shell; so it's not available for applications too. So anything in .bashrc won't be available for those applications if run from menu. But when you open a gnome-terminal and executes command from there, applications are launched as children of gnome-terminal and inherits .bashrc's parameters from it.\n\n", "Q: Slow performance on HP DC7800 SFF desktop I have installed latest Ubuntu 64 bit on the hp dc7800 with core 2 duo e6550.\nIt has 2gb ram.

I recently tried booting into the Grub2's menu entry \"Ubuntu GNU/Linux, with Linux 3.2.0-24-generic-pae (Recovery Mode) just to see what was there.  It booted successfully, but I had no idea what to do after I was there.  My question is where can I find some documentation on the recovery mode and what to do if I truly needed to be there.  I'm running Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: The recovery mode is normally used when you need an exclusive admin access to your system. You normally go into the root shell and recover/repair the system through the command line.\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch on your computer.\n\n*Wait until the BIOS has finished loading, or has almost finished. (During this time you will probably see a logo of your computer manufacturer.)\n\n*Quickly press and hold the Shift key (or Escape key on some computers), which will bring up the GNU GRUB menu. (If you see the Ubuntu logo, you've missed the point where you can enter the GRUB menu.) **\n\n*Select the line which starts with \"Advanced options\". *\n\n*Select the line ending with \"(recovery mode)\", probably the second line, something like:\n\nUbuntu GNU/Linux, with Linux 3.8.0-26-generic (recovery mode)\n\n\n*Press Return and your machine will begin the boot process.\n\n*After a few moments, your workstation should display a menu with a number of options. One of the options (you may need to scroll down to the bottom of the list) will be \"Drop to root shell prompt\". Press Return with this option highlighted.\n\n*The root partition is mounted read-only. To mount it read/write, enter the command\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\n\n*If you have /home, /boot, /tmp, or any other mount point on a separate partition, you can mount them with the command\nmount --all\n\n(This must be done following step 8 so that /etc/mtab is writable.) Alternatively, you could try to select \"Enable networking\" in step 7, though this has been found to cause the system to hang.\n* If you have Ubuntu Quantal (12.10) or earlier, omit step 4 (the recovery mode menu items are displayed on the top-level menu).\n** If you reboot, there is no need to hold the Shift key in step 3. The GNU GRUB menu will continue to be displayed automatically on each boot until a normal startup of Ubuntu completes. To configure GRUB so the menu is always displayed, even after a normal startup, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Setup. \nSource: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveryMode\n", "Q: A routine update wrote Grub in the MBR; how do I undo it? I have Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows7 installed onto a machine so that I could boot into either one.  I wanted to keep using the Windows bootloader (actually EasyBCD), so I made sure that I didn't install Grub into the MBR, and all was well.\nHowever, a week or two ago, just doing a routine update with Update Manager, it updated Grub but put it into the MBR (without telling me and without asking my permission), disabling the Windows bootloader, so now the machine boots into Grub instead.  I'd like to get it back to booting into the Windows bootloader.\nI've read it is easy to fix this, but I don't know how.  Any help?\n\nA: Go to the \"BCD Deployment\" menu in EasyBCD.  Then click the \"Write MBR\" button.\n\nReboot, and you're all set!\n\nA: To reinstall the Windows boot loader you will need to boot the windows recovery console ( possibly via the install cd ) and run the FIXMBR command.\nTo make sure grub isn't (re)installed to the MBR, you need to run sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc and make sure it is not configured to install to the whole drive ( /dev/sda ).\n\nA: Both answers were great so I upvoted them.  In the end, I found it easier than I might have imagined.\nSince I had used EasyBCD on Windows to set up the Windows boot manager, I opened it and found an option to repair the MBR.

It runs right up to the very last sector of the disk, which is not allowed since the GPT stores a backup copy in the last 33 sectors of the disk.  If there isn't anything important on the partition, you should be able to just delete it in gdisk.\n\nA: I'm the author of gdisk, and I agree with what psusi has written, with the caveat that I can't know what's really on /dev/sda5, so I can't say if it's safe to remove it. If it's the stuff that you've burned to your recovery DVDs, it should be safe to delete it, though.\nIf there's sufficient free space on /dev/sda5 (about 17 KiB), you should be able to resize the partition using GParted or a Windows tool, IF that tool doesn't flake out because of the illegal partition table. You might be better off backing it up to another disk, deleting it, and then restoring it. You'll need to use a backup/restore method that enables restoring to a smaller partition, though. (Alternatively, you could shrink /dev/sda4 by just a bit to make room to create a new /dev/sda5 that's as big as it is now.)\nAlso, on an unrelated matter, you seem to have a UEFI-based PC. On such systems, the advice to install Linux second isn't as important as it is on BIOS-based systems. (U)EFI still has a lot of flaws, but despite those problems, it's got much saner boot management than does BIOS, and Windows behaves itself better with respect to other OSes on EFI than it does on BIOS.\nYou might want to use gdisk to change your Linux partitions' type codes from 0700 to 8300 to keep them from showing up as unformatted disks in Windows. See here for more on this issue.\n", "Q: How do I rip a dvd including menus and extras to a menu driven divx file (or any lossy format that supports menus)? I am asking exactly this question for the same reason, but would like to archive dvds as small, low quality video, while preserving the menu choosing experience.\nI would like to rip my dvds to something that has the same menus but whose video is in a much more compressed format.  I do not want to copy a dvd to an .iso image.\nHow can this be done in the most automatic (hopefully CLI) way possible?  Any format is fine so long as playback on linux is possible.\n\nA: Try Dvdrip.  \n\nDvdrip is a full-featured DVD copy program written in Perl. It\n  provides an easy to use, but feature-rich Gtk+ GUI to control almost\n  all aspects of the ripping and transcoding process.

My first thought is to run Ubuntu within some sort of virtual machine, such as Vbox.  However, my primary drive is an SSD (Samsung 470/256gb), and I've heard that it is a bad idea for your SSD to run VM's on it (I guess it decreases its longevity substantially, due to the nature of write methodology or something?).  For what I want to do, dual boot would not be realistic, since I basically just want Ubuntu running in the background, mostly, and to shell into it when I need to do stuff.\nI like Ubuntu specifically, because that's what we use on our production server; this would allow me a dev environment local to my machine (this probably .  I realize this is probably a stupid question - after all, how could two OS's share the same physical resources?  Googling wasn't very helpful, but maybe there is some sort of software or methodology I'm not thinking to search for.  Thoughts?  Suggestions?  I suppose another take could be some solution that makes virtualization on SSD's safe?\n\nA: It is absolutely no issue to run Virtual Box with virtual disks, and machine folders located anywhere. This can perfectly be another hard drive or an external USB drive. \nThe only thing we have to do is to set this up in the Virtual Box preferences where we can define a path for the default machine folder. The virtual disks used by a given machine can even be stored anywhere else.\nWhen starting a virtual machine we then only have to take care that all the locations we may have defined are accessible.\nIn case you need simultaneous access to both, Windows, and Ubuntu you have little choice other than running one of them in a virtual machine.\n\nA: I think the easiest way to do something close to that, is to run Cygwin in windows.  \nAlthough I don't know if you will be able to get every thing you need to run in it, you may want to give it a shot. I have only ever use it for SSH access and GCC on a windows machine at work, and it works great for that.  \n\nA: Well, if you still wanting to run VM on your SSD, here's a little information that I have for you.\nAs I know, that VM is using a virtual hard drive, isn't it?\nLast time I used VirtualBox, it was using 2 types of VHD. \nA fixed size one, and another one that have it's size increasing as much as you use your VM.\nIn my opinion, it is safer for you to use a fixed VHD.\nBecause a fixed size VHD has it's file size fixed, it won't increase or decrease at any conditions.\nIn other words, there will be no such a massive read/write progress on your SSD as you use the VM.\nIf you know what I mean.\nBut still, it is possible that my research is not right by any circumstances.\n", "Q: Can you recommend some softwares for Ubuntu 12.04 I would like to install some softwares to my newly installed Ubuntu.

Can I apt-get install ubuntu-server on my Ubuntu desktop? I am running 12.04 x64 desktop in VirtualBox.

I don't know if this exists but it seems like it should.\n\nA: ubuntu-desktop is a meta package for installing a desktop environment (ubuntu), not the whole ubuntu system (desktop version). \nI don't know about a meta package for LAMP, but I'm quite sure that \"ubuntu server\" refers to a whole system, not to a package, as you can see in the Ubuntu releases' download page.\n\nA: If the goal is to have Apache, MySQL and PHP installed on your desktop, just install the Apache, MySQL and PHP packages. A 'server' package wouldn't necessarily install all these for yet, and may also include some other packages you don't want. \n\nA: There are no differences between packages in the different flavours of Ubuntu. The only difference is which packages comes \"preinstalled\" in them. \nSo, the package for installing MySQL is the same in all Ubuntu versions, like the desktop, server, kde etc versions.\nSo just install the packages for LAMP, and you turn your ordinary Desktop installation of Ubuntu to a Server one.

Automatic DHCP (default) will set both.  Your other choices under the IPv4 Settings tab, are:  \nAutomatic (DHCP) addresses only, which sets the IP addresses via DHCP, but allows you to set the DNS addresses yourself, in case you want to use an alternate such as Google or EasyDNS, etc.\nManual, means you set both the IP address and the DNS address.  This may be what you selected, and so you have an IP address, but you cannot use domain names, only IP addresses, to connect out, since DNS translates the names to IP addresses.\nUnder \"DNS servers:\" in the IPv4 Settings tab, you can enter any number of DNS addresses, separated by commas.  For example, if you wanted to use Google's public DNS servers, you would enter 8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4.  If you want to use the same ones as your Windows system, you can check them under Windows using \"IPCONFIG\", or if you have the original Default network profile (you should), you can switch to that, then enter nmcli dev list iface eth0 | grep IP4 at a commandline prompt, and get the DNS addresses (usually 2).\nAnother way is to look into whether your router can assign static IP addresses.  I find this to be easier to maintain.\nAlso, if you're worried about router security, you can probably simply disable external access completely.  Most people never use it anyway.\n\nA: You most likely have an incorrect setting, I'm guessing either your default gateway or DNS server.

How do I revert this back to notify-osd? \n\nA: from http://www.techmansworld.com/2012/07/how-to-restore-unitys-notification.html\nSo first off, open up a terminal You can do this by accessing the applications menu from XFCE, or in Unity by opening the dash and typing in “terminal”. Once the terminal is open, paste the following line into the terminal and press enter.\ngksu gedit /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.xfce.xfce4-notifyd.Notifications.service\n\nAfter pressing enter, you should receive a prompt for your password because this is modifying high level parts of your system. Just enter your password and continue. A new gedit (text editor) window should open with that config file.\nAll you have to do now is replace one line of text in that file.

However, my hard drive was corrupted and I lost all my data yesterday, so after it was replaced, I installed Ubuntu 12.04 64x again after installing Windows 7. \nI booted up Ubuntu after installation, and noticed it was by default using Unity 2D... Gnome 3.4 wasn't working properly either, so I guessed that the NVIDIA G210M driver wasn't installed/working and the OS was instead using the integrated graphics. I checked the \"Additional Drivers\" thing, but there were no proprietary drivers listed there, so I went to the NVIDIA website, downloaded the driver directly and installed it. I restarted, but there was no change.\nAfter this, I read somewhere that I should change my SATA in the BIOS to \"Compatible\" rather than \"Enhanced\". This worked fine and fixed the problem (both Unity and Gnome were working perfectly) but then when I tried booting up Windows 7, I recieved the BSOD. So I changed it back to Enhanced, and once again, the NVIDIA 210M graphics isn't working on Ubuntu, but on Windows 7 it is. I do not want to keep changing from Enhanced to Compatible every time I reboot to Ubuntu and neither do I want to simply just use one OS.\nNote that NVIDIA 210M and integrated graphics work perfectly on Windows 7. Also, I don't care about switching between them, I just want to be able to use the NVIDIA one. \nWhat can I do so that both Windows 7 and Ubuntu work and NVIDIA G210M works on Ubuntu?\n\nA: To be honest, I think your problem is just related with your configurations. As far as I know, if you installed W7 with one HDD mode in the BIOS, you cannot change it back to the other mode, b/c Windows won't recognize those changes on the SATA controller.\nWhy I said that? Because I had a similar problem with an Acer laptop.\nProbably there is another option, but the way I solve it was by re-installing everything again, but this time be sure the SATA mode is the \"compatible\" instead of \"enhanced\". Install w7 again and it should work properly under both, W7 and Ubuntu.\nI know it is a brute solution, but it was the only that really works for me.\n\nA: There is a setting in BIOS setup for VGA Controller selection in most BIOS. Set that to 'Others' and you should get the graphics card.\n\nA: Open up your xorg.conf file from /usr/share/x11/xorg.conf.d/\nNote:  I can't remember if its this directory or this one...\n/etc/x11/xorg.conf.d/\nMaybe someone else remembers?  I'm not at my PC now, and 13.04 doesn't create an xorg.conf file anymore so I've never actually used the file, just studied about it.\nLook for the line about your display device, and if you can't find one write your own.  Make it match the exact device description, which can be found by opening the terminal and typing \nlspci\nto display all detected PCI hardware.  If its not listed then you have a \"Linux doesn't detect my video card\" problem.  \nIf this doesn't work try entering a tty with Ctrl+alt+F6 and enter the command to reinstall the entire Ubuntu desktop including unity, xorg, etc.\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\nGood luck.\n", "Q: How do I submit a full bug report with crash dump and steps to reproduce? I have found a reproducable crash bug in xserver-xephyr. When I run the following command:\napport-bug /var/crash/_usr_bin_Xephyr.1000.crash\nit sends a whoopsie report and does not ask me for any extra information such as how to reproduce the bug, which I know. It also doesn't file a real bug report. How am I supposed to do it?\n\nA: A good way to report this is to configure Apport to send crash data to Launchpad.\nYou can configure it back afterwards, if you don't generally want to do this when a program crashes.\nBackground\nWhat you want is for Apport to collect crash data and submit it to Launchpad, so you can write and submit a bug report with the data attached. This is the behavior of Apport on alpha and beta releases, as well as the behavior (when Apport was enabled) on all releases prior to 12.04.\nIn Ubuntu 12.04, Whoopsie was introduced.\nWhoopsie submits Apport crash data to a database (Daisy) where it can be processed and analyzed in aggregate (then viewed). This is much better than not having the data reported at all, and better than bug reports with insufficient information where the reporter does not provide requested information. Furthermore, bugs in stable releases are sometimes less likely to be fixed unless they can be reproduced in the development release (and with Whoopsie, users are not asked to read bug reporting instructions and file a report, only to find that the bug is not fixed for a long time).\nHowever, well-written bug reports with enough information are still welcomed, for supported Ubuntu releases (which includes your situation).\nYou can reconfigure Apport so it submits crash data to Launchpad for bug reporting, instead of Daisy for statistical analysis.\nReconfiguring Apport to Send Crash Data to Launchpad\nIf you disabled Whoopsie as explained here, Apport will be disabled too. So if your goal is to report crash bugs, that's not what you want.\nIn one of Apport's configuration files, /etc/apport/crashdb.conf, there is a line that says:\n        'problem_types': ['Bug', 'Package'],\n\nThis is the line that lists the problem types for which data are sent to Launchpad. It lists Bug and Package. Add Crash:\n        'problem_types': ['Bug', 'Package', 'Crash'],\n\nNow, when crash data are automatically collected, they will be submitted to Launchpad and a browser window/tab will appear where you can describe the bug (just like before Whoopsie).\nReferences\n\n*\n\n*Bob Bib (bobbib), Comment 5 for bug 994921\n\n*Neal McBurnett (nealmcb), Comment 13 for bug 993450\n", "Q: .desktop howto: persistent terminal, custom $HOME I have a web server .jar file (it's a jetty application) that I've created a .desktop file for. Clicking on the .desktop file opens a terminal, begins running the application, and then closes the terminal (and the application with it).\nTwo questions: first, how can I make this terminal persist? And secondly, the application needs to be launched from a particular directory, is there a way to specify that?\n\nA: You can change the Exec line of your .desktop file as Exec=xterm -hold -e \"cd <your desired directory>&&<command for your application startup here>\". This will spawn a xterm terminal emulator and hold it even after your application terminates until you explicitly close the xterm window. \n", "Q: How can Ubuntu update running applications without having to close them while Windows cannot? Running Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit.\nI mostly update through terminal using sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade.\nI don't understand this: having Firefox or any other such integrated application actively running along with update process running concurrently in terminal, which is updating Firefox to a newer version. I am aware that restarting Firefox will cause Firefox to be opened as the newer version.\nFor example, when updating in MS Windows 7, it asks for closing the active instance of the same application (if it is active) before updating.\nHow does Ubuntu replace the active working application to a newer version without interfering with its active instance?\nWhat exactly happens at the back-end of updating process in this case?\n\nA: \nFor Example-Updating in MS Windows 7 , it asks for closing the Active Instance of same application (if active) for updating.\nHow does Ubuntu replaces the active working application to newer version without interfering with its active Instance. [Noticed for many Packages]\n\nI'll try to explain this as simply as possible. Most Linux filesystems are slightly different from Windows' filesystems (NTFS). At their core, both essentially contain an index table of file names (entries) pointing to the actual data stored on the disk. In NTFS this is called the MFT (master file table) -- you may have seen that name scroll by if you run a chkdsk.\nHowever, the \"slight difference\" I mentioned is that Linux's index tables, if you will, consists of two levels: the index, and inodes. The inodes contain the actual file metadata, including its physical location on disk; the \"file name\" in the index is simply a (hard) link to the inode.\nWhen you update/upgrade a running application, the updated files are written to disk, inodes pointing to the new data created/updated, and the file names are also updated to link to these new inodes. But, for any files that already in use by a running application (i.e. file handles exist), their file names will continue to point to the old inodes (which contain the old data) until the file handles are closed. This usually happens when you exit the application, or for some system files, when you reboot. At this point, the old data is actually removed from your disk.\n", "Q: USB flash drive wont detect hard drive/SATA OK here goes nothing. I had a problem installing ubuntu desktop from a CD drive. Live system not detected issue. Got the install process going a few times but it seemed to crash towards the end (tried 15 times got it to boot once which also crashed).\n So I decided to do it with a USB stick HP(4GB). I used the universal boot loader to create the iso. So there's no issue with the credibility of the iso. BIOS was configured to boot from the usb stick. \nThe system booted from the USB drive but when I tried installing ubuntu into the hard drive, I got the error of not enough disk space. So i figured the flash drive was trying to install Ubuntu in itself and not into the hard drive. Thus didnt detect my hard drive.\nMy question is how do you do a BIOS update/upgrade? How do I get the flash drive to detect the hard drive? Is there any other way that you have in mind that i might try?\nNote: My BIOS is American Megatrends. Manufacturer XFX. MI-A78S-8209. \nHard drive Hitachi 1T.    \n\nA: To update your BIOS, you will have to go to the website of your motherboard (or PC, if you bought a pre-built, i.e. Dell, HP) to find the correct download. They are typically an iso that you burn to a CD and run.\nTo install to the hard drive, instead of the flash drive, when you get to the \"Installation Type\" screen, choose \"Something Else\".\n\nThat will allow you to manually partition your drive and set where you want to install. Create a 2GB partition for swap, and make the rest an ext4 partition, using \"/\" as the mount point.\n\nA: Thanks reverendj1, for your help but that wasn't the issue. I never even made it to that window you posted above. Also when I did make it to that window (after running in AHCI mode), I choose the other option of using the entire disk, considering I didn't need windows anymore. Still though your comments are appreciated. \nNote: This I would not recommend (dangerous) (what I did was tried to run in RAID5 mode, but it didn't work so I deleted the MBR tables, thus windows was gone). RAID5 mode didn't work.\nI would not recommend deleteting MBR tables unless:\n1) You can boot the USB drive, at least you will have a way to get back into the system through ubuntu 12.04 64 bit. \n2) You want Windows to be gone. (You wont be able to get back into windows if you delete the MBR)\n3) If you've tried everything and you just haven't been able to get UBUNTU 12.04 64bit AMD installed through a USB stick. Also I used a 1GB flash drive to install the system, so much for 2GB minimum requirement.  \nThe problem was in the BIOS. Although my manufacturer told me I cant boot from a USB, I still managed to do it...with some side effects :), I went into BIOS, changed SATA to AHCI mode, so that the computer boots from AHCI. This way it thinks that its running a USB drive...I think...could be wrong. \nNote: I dont know if running in AHCI mode will have any side effects later but from what I read it can have some performance advantages?\n", "Q: Can't mount or unmount virtual discs- gives option for \"force unmounting\" I've installed Ubuntu (64-bit version) on a vm through VirtualBox on a Windows 7 64-bit host, but I fear that I've done something wrong.

Is there a separate step to have a selection menu at start-up or does this not apply for VirtualBox runs of Ubuntu?\n\nThat's normal.

How can I explore my Ubuntu partition when I'm booted in Windows?\nIf it's possible I'd like to have the partition appear under the Hard Disc Drives in Computer.\nHow would I do this or something similar?\n\nA: Ubuntu uses ext4 for its file system.  Unfortunately, this is incompatible with Windows 7.  There are ext2 and ext3 compatibility layers you can obtain and install, but not ext4.

You will have to specify the .iso file to use and carefully provide it with the device you want to install to. Before you proceed with installing you can tell the Disk Creator that you want persistent memory and specify how much (with a maximum of 4GB for a big stick).\nThe installed system will have the Ubuntu version you selected, and will have gparted.\nYou can then boot the USB stick and partition disks or install Ubuntu from it, etc. You can also install additional packages on it (I wouldn't update linux, however) and make other changes. Due to the persistence setting these will be saved to the USB stick from boot-to-boot.\nIn his comment I believe @Lord of Time was referring to the fact that flash memory has a somewhat limited lifetime, limited in the number of writes to its sectors before those particular sectors are marked lost and the flash memory loses capacity. The controller on the flash memory stick tries to spread the wear around the stick. If I understand his comment, that's the reason for using a couple of sticks and using only part of each, rather than combining them--it should allow them to last longer.\nIt should also be simpler, and therefore less troublesome, but a little more expensive.\n", "Q: Bars do not disappear watching videos full screen I just installed Ubuntu 12.04.

The weird thing is, the cursor seems to react to what I had opened when going into suspend to RAM, so for instance one day I had writer open and then my cursor was a \"I\" for most of the screen.\nI only get this in 12.04, never had any problems with this in 9.04-11.10.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I have the same problem as you and used to have a similar problem on previous versions (< 12.04). My solution used to be to go tty1 by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 and then killing the gnome-screensaver program. Things would go back to normal.\nThis has not worked for me in 12.04, but maybe it might work for you. In 12.04, all I can do is killall -u myusername to close my session and then I have to log back in just to avoid having to reboot.\n\nA: Better still:\nBefore closing the lid initiate the suspend via the GUI. (The option right above shutdown)\nWait for the laptop to suspend then close the lid. Once you open the lid you can input the password and return to your work without having to restart anything.\nI tried this on a ThinkPad Edge.\nCan anyone verify that this works for other models/brands?\n\nA: This seems to primarily be a Gnome 3.6.1 bug.\nAfter changing to TTY (Ctrl-Alt-F1) and logging in, set your DISPLAY variable, then send the command to gnome-screensaver to disable the screensaver:\n$ export DISPLAY=:0.0\n$ gnome-screensaver-command -d\n\nYou can then switch back to Gnome with Ctrl+Alt+F7.\nThis is already fixed in Gnome 3.6.2.\nSolution source, but more vague\nMultiple reports of this bug\n", "Q: How to make XFCE show the Shutdown Menu? I have installed XFCE on an \"Ubuntu Server\" (in a Virtual Machine) so I have a small and fast environment. But when I want to log out, I usually (not always) see a gray shutdown and reboot button, but I like to be able to shutdown via that menu (I know of shutdown -h now, but the users of my machine don't necessarily know).\nI use the display manager 'slim'. \n\nQuestion: how can I enable these buttons permanently?\n\nA: Short solution:\nMake sure that xfce4-session and upower are installed, and that the affected user is in the \"power\" group. If this doesn't help, here comes the scary part:\nSystem shutdowns must always be issued from a root context. Different desktop environments use different approaches to achieve this. Mostly the shutdown is requested via a dbus call from the login manager, which in turn runs as root.\nXFCE however, in an approach to make things less bloated and employ simpler technologies, uses its own helper programs. (Hey, I think that's cool!)\nThe shutdown helper should be contained in the package xfce4-session.\nIf this package isn't installed in your system, there could be the solution to your problem already.\nFurthermore your user should be able to run the shutdown helper with root permissions.   The xfce wiki has a paragraph on this:\nhttp://wiki.xfce.org/faq#session_manager\nDifferent distributions prefer different solutions described in this wiki. I cannot check right now what applies to you, since I'm neither using XFCE nor Ubuntu. I would start by making sure your user belongs to the \"power\" group. You might need to install upower to set up this group and its infrastructure in the first place.\nApart from configuring sudo or polkit as described in the wiki, issuing \"chmod +s /usr/bin/xfce4-shutdown-helper\" is a less secure but more convenient way to make sure the helper runs as root.\nWell or has xfce4-shutdown helper become xfsm-shutdonw-helper? And is it placed in /usr/bin or /usr/sbin or /usr/lib/xfce4/ ..? I've lost track, it differs from distro to distro and from version to version. But maybe you don't need to get this deep into it.\nHope I could help ;-)\n", "Q: Only run CRON job if connected to specific wifi network I am a newbie to scripting on Linux (Lubuntu), but I would like to make a script that runs a cron job only if my laptop is connected to my home wifi.\nIs this possible?\nI guess, I could do something with iwconfig and pull the ESSID from there with grep?\nSo far, I tried this and it seems to work:\n#!/bin/bash\n# CRON, connected to specific WIFI\nclear\nnetid=HOFF216\nif iwconfig | grep $netid\nthen \n    clear   \n    echo \"True, we are connected to $netid\"\n    rsync ...........\nelse\n    clear       \n    echo \"False, we are not connected to $netid\"\nfi\n\n\nA: I'd suggest running a cronjob script unconditionally (ie, regardless of whether or not you're connected to wifi). The script itself would then check for the wifi network, and exit if you're not connected to the right one.\nTo check which network you're connected to, I'd suggest using nmcli.

See the below picture.\n\nI wanted to see this by doing a needless actual install, And also wanted to take a screenshot, with Alt key pressing, To my surprise, As soon as I press ALT, It revealed the actual partition of Ubuntu !!\n\nA: If Windows was installed previously, it will typically be located in the beginning of the partition; meaning it will be the first, left-most part of the bar.\nCaution: this might not be your case. A screenshot or diagram of some kind would be helpful.\n//After selecting \"install along side windows 7\" and you enter the easy partitioning press alt to view which side is which. Windows is usally on the left, but after pressing alt it will tell you which side is Ubuntu.\n\nA: Your existing partition (Windows) is on the left, Ubuntu is on the right.

I am running Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit as a guest on a Windows 7 Sony Vaio laptop (64-bit). Here is what happens:\nI start up Ubuntu via the VirtualBox manager (by clicking start)- it runs in scale mode to start out (windowed mode). In this scale mode, I have two options to close Ubuntu:\n1)Click the \"X\" in the upper right-hand corner of the Ubuntu window and just close it like a normal window. A menu pops up with 3 options: a)Save the machine state; b)Send the shutdown signal; and c)Power off the machine.\nIf I choose option 'c', the window just closes and Ubuntu is no more- I am back in my host Windows 7 environment.\n2)The second option I have is by clicking the power symbol while in Ubuntu (which is right below the \"X\" that closes out the window). When I click \"shutdown\", I get an error message from Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager: \"Orcale VM VirtualBox Manager has stopped working.\"\nIt searches for a solution, but does not find one, and the only option I have is to \"close program.\"\nSo why does closing Ubuntu by \"sending the shutdown signal\" crash VirtualBox but if I simply close the Ubuntu window by \"x\"ing out of it, and click \"power down machine,\" I have no problems? \nP.S. I can also post the VBox log if that will help ID the root of this problem. \n\nA: Option C is basically like pressing and holding the power button on the virtual machine. It's not a proper shutdown, is never recommended as the \"normal\" way to shutdown, and you could end up losing data or with an unbootable VM if you're unlucky. \nThe other way (from within Ubuntu) is correct, but it appears that Virtualbox has a problem with the signals Ubuntu sends upon shutdown. Does it crash immediately after, or do you see Ubuntu beginning shutdown first? In any case, this alternative is better than the power off because Ubuntu probably gets partly shutdown.\nTo fix it, try updating Virtualbox and/or include vbox logs. \n", "Q: How to configure screen brightness when not using a laptop For a way too strange reason, my TV (which I'm using with a Dell Inspiron 1145 laptop running Ubuntu 11.10) does not allow me to do a fine-grained brightness configuration.

What distribution volume is  it talking about and where did it detect it? What does \"upgrade from it automatically mean\"?\n\nA: When you mount a CD or USB device that has an Ubuntu OS on it (either the same version or a newer, I think), Ubuntu will detect it and offer to upgrade. So, my guess is that after you create the bootable USB or CD, it gets automatically mounted, and Ubuntu goes through the normal detection routine.  \nYou can confirm this by unmounting, then reinserting the device to see if you get the same message.\n", "Q: How to get full rights in Ubuntu to manipulate a file that is owned by root \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I elevate nautilus privileges to move or copy a folder as root? \n\nI want to have full rights in Ubuntu 11.10 so I don't have to use the terminal every time I want to copy and paste or edit a file that is owned by root.

So depending from your goals it might be sufficient to encrypt this file.\nYou can use TrueCrypt. This software is available as a portable app and can be used with all major operating systems. So first prepare Virtualbox and install Ubuntu. Now encrypt the virtualbox file with TrueCrypt.\nWhen you insert your USB stick in another computer, you can decrypt the file with TrueCrypt. When this finishes successful, you can boot your Ubuntu.\n\nA: VirtualBox allows encryption of the virtual hard disk file automatically. You have to install the extensions though.\n", "Q: Why nvidiabl module is not working in precise?

When using nouveau the fps are low compared to nvidia closed driver. But when booting, nvidia drivers show the ubuntu splash screen in a 900x800 resolution like nvidia its not loaded yet. When nouveau it splash in a decent resolution.\nThe problem I'm having since karmic koala is I cant switch to virtual terminals with nvidia closed drivers. By the way, is the same PC: VAIO VPCCW19FX with NVIDIA G210M, now with precise amd64.\nTo make easy to read the configs, I pastedbin'ed each file in differents pastes.\n/etc/X11/xorg.conf >> http://pastebin.com/Ly7n5d2T\n/etc/default/grub >> http://pastebin.com/VPBYkRVS\nlsmod  >> http://pastebin.com/a7q3z9ZL\nlspci  >> http://pastebin.com/bd4vPCPf\n\nA: \nwhen booting, nvidia drivers show the ubuntu splash screen in a 900x800 resolution like nvidia its not loaded yet. When nouveau it splash in a decent resolution.\n\nThis is because the nvidia proprietary drivers do not support Kernel Modesetting (KMS).  This is normal when you are using the nvidia proprietary drivers - with these drivers you should not normally expect your screen to switch to full resolution prior to boot, like you do with other open source drivers.\nIt's possible that a framebuffer mode is being entered and there is a problem with that somehow.\nI don't know a fix but I can suggest troubleshooting steps that may help you get what you want.\nIn my /etc/default/grub, I have removed \"splash\" from the kernel command line, and uncommented the GRUB_TERMINAL=console line in order to give up totally on graphical boot.\nBut you could also try, instead, just adding \"vga=normal\" to your kernel command line (next to \"quiet splash\").  This should try and prevent a framebuffer mode loading.\n\nA: As mentioned by neon_overload, adding \"vga=normal\" to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line in /etc/default/grub totally fixed the vterm problem for me, while keeping the same boot behaviour (i.e. the grub menu and splash screen are unchanged)!\nEDIT: Sadly, after changing the screen resolution with NVIDIA's configuration tool, switching to virtual terminals again gives me no output. Nonetheless, this is still a partial fix.\n", "Q: How to tell Ubuntu where to install a program and how to tell where an existing program was installed? I'm totally new to Ubuntu/Linux, using Ubuntu Server at the moment. Just trying to  figure out something basic.\nHow can you tell where you are installing a program. For example I just installed Sphinx search engine by placing the tarball that I downloaded from their site in /home/sphinx. I created the sphinx directory to place that tarball in. Then I ran these commands:\ntar xvzf sphinx-0.9.8.1.tar.gz\ncd sphinx-0.9.8.1/\n./configure --with-mysql-includes=/usr/include/mysql --with-mysql-libs=/usr/lib/mysql\n\nand then these:\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nNow I have a lot of files sitting in the directory where I ran these commands. Is this my Sphinx installation or did it install somewhere else?\nIn Windows if you run an installer (.exe file) anywhere the program will still install in your C:\\\\Program Files directory. Does something similar apply to Linux where all programs are installed in a central place, or can you install programs anywhere on the system?\nI would prefer to keep all my installed programs in one place so what is the right place for this in terms of best practice. In other words what is the Linux equivalent of C:\\\\Program Files?\nAnd how does one always install at this location, is it just a matter of placing the tarball and running the install commands from this location?\nWhat about if I use sudo apt-get to install a package. How can I point to this location to tell apt-get to always install there?\n\nA: Usually programs are installed in a couple of directories under one top directory, called a prefix.  Which top directory to use depends on who is installing, for what purpose and who will manage the software.\nThe prefix /usr is used software packed by your distribution. You should not install any other software there, because it will confuse the distribution when installing and upgrading software packed by the distribution.\nFor commercial software, the prefix /opt is used. It's reserved for them to interfere least with distributions and the local system administrator.\nFor software the system administrator installs for all users, the prefix /usr/local is used.\nIf you are an ordinary user installing software for yourself, you could use your home directory as prefix, by using the --prefix option to configure with prefix directory \"~/\" or $HOME/. I used that a lot when I was a student. :-)\nUsually software does the right thing when you execute configure with the option --prefix with the right value and then make; make install.\nUnder any of these prefixes, you usually find these directories in a standard installation.\n\n*\n\n*bin - the executable programs, binaries.\n\n*sbin - system binaries,  which usually should not be executed by ordinary users.\n\n*man - manual pages for programs, libraries and config files etc.\n\n*etc - config files with default values for the software.\n\n*lib - program libraries and data files that are dependent on architecture (like the CPU) in your computer.\n\n*share - data files that are not different on different architectures, and can be shared between different computers.\n\n*var - directories with data that changes during program execution like log files etc.\n\nMost of those directories can be used with write protected file systems to increase security.  The only one that users need to write to is the var/ directory.\nWhen the software is updated these directories need to have write privileges. Usually one does not need to do anything, but if needed that can be done with a remount with write privileges during installation and then remounted with read only after installation. But this is advanced, and I only give it as an example of advanced package management.\nThere are also some directories directly under / (the root directory) which don't exists under any other prefix, like /dev, /tmp, /proc and /srv (for server data directories, but they are usually under /var/lib or /var/www and directories like that, so you need to change configuration to use this directory. I do recommend that you do that when you are running a server. Only use /var/ for testing out a standard installation).\nDifferent programs have different installation methods. --prefix is useful for programs using configure. Best way to know is probably to read the README.txt file or something like that, which is probably provided with in the tar archive.\nThe tar archive can be extracted in any place, like your home directory. After the installation steps are done, you can remove the extracted tar archive if you are short of storage. But it's better to keep the directory as you can often use it for uninstallation.\nPrograms installed with apt-get or aptitude are always installed in the proper place for the distribution. You can't change that place.\n\nA: When you install programs from a repository using the normal install, it will install to the correct place, create configuration files in the right place (functionally similar to Windows registry), and create menu entries automatically.\nWhen you download a file (non-preferred, but often necessary when the app isn't in a repository), then the first thing you did was to run tar, equivalent to unzip on Windows.  This creates the files you are most likely seeing.\nThen, when you run make install, that will usually put the results in the right place, maybe create menus, but it won't erase the un-tarred files.  You can most likely do that, but you may want to save them temporarily just in case.\nHere is an interesting article on Debian Directory Structure.\n\nA: \nDoes something similar apply to linux where all programs are installed in a central place\n\nApproximate equivalents of Windows install directories in Linux\n\n*\n\n*\\Windows = /bin\n\n*\\Windows\\System32 = /lib and /sbin\n\n*\\Program Files = /usr/bin and /usr/lib\n\n\nI would prefer to keep all my installed programs in one place so what is the right place for this in terms of best practice. In other words what is the Linux equivalent of C:\\Program Files?\n\nThat would be the directories under /usr, specifically /usr/bin and /usr/lib.\n\nAnd how does one always install at this location, is it just a matter of placing the tarball and running the install commands from this location?\n\n\n*\n\n*No.  Where you are when you run the install commands almost never matters.\n\n\n*Programs you install via apt-get (or aptitude) will almost always end up appropriately in /usr. BUT programs you compile from source and make install will more often end up in /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, etc, and you may have problems with that since the user-installed path in Debian/Ubuntu is /usr and not /usr/local.\n\n\n*When compiling from source, add this switch to configure: ./configure --prefix=/usr. This way when you make install the files will end up in the right directory\n\n\n*Also look into the checkinstall program, which keeps track of the files a package compiled from source installs, makes a deb file, and allows for easy uninstall/reinstall.\n\nWhat about if I use sudo apt-get to install a package. How can I point to this location to tell apt-get to always install there?\n\napt-get/dpkg take care of this automatically. You can use dpkg -L name-of-package to see all the files installed by a package and where they were installed.\n", "Q: Graphics cards not waking from sleep I'm fairly new to Ubuntu and Unix based systems as a whole. So far, my only concern is that my graphics cards are not waking from sleep (hibernate?) mode. When I move my mouse or hit a key on my keyboard while it is in sleep, I hear my CPU and case fans turning on. However, I do not hear my GPUs. I have two HD Radeon 6870s with AMD's proprietary driver installed from their website. I am also running Ubuntu alongside Windows using Wubi.\nAny help would be much appreciated.\n\nA: This sounds similar to a problem that I have occasionally.  When it happens I am able to get the graphics to show by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F7 which goes to the terminal that your desktop loads on.  I have only my integrated graphics card so I have no idea if this will works for your gpu cards.   If the next time this happens Ctl+Alt+F7 does not work, this should get your desktop back but it WILL close all your running programs and restart your desktop so you will lose any unsaved work that was open a the time the computer suspended.\nPress Ctrl+Alt+F(2-6, any will do) to get to your other terminals. enter your username and password at the prompts.  after you are logged in type the following:\nsudo stop lightdm\n\nyou will get a message that says lightdm stop/wait  then type:\nsudo start lightdm\n\nthis will restart your desktop and then go to your log in screen or straight to your desktop if you have it set for automatic login. \n", "Q: Ctrl+C does not quit a running program in terminal Ok,\n I don't know why, but I've seen this question been asked many times, but none of the answers seem to be helpful, yet the problem is quite obvious, because I verified it on several computers.\n Ctrl+C does NOT kill a running program in terminal (Ubuntu v10) even though it's supposed to. I wonder if anyone can actually point a solution that actually works.\nSo far I've tried Ctrl+\\, Ctrl+SysRq+K, and much more - nothing works!\nThe only thing that did work, sort of, is Ctrl+Z, but it doesn't actually kill/exit the program, but simply puts it in a background and then you still have to do kill %1 to actually kill it.\nThanks!\n\nA: Note:  Answer andded after comments...\nI'm pretty sure it will kill most terminal programs; of course, it won't kill the ones that fork a new process, then return the prompt immediately. \nSome programs may catch this interrupt and handle it however they want, or even ignore it. It may depend a lot on whether the program is designed to be run in a terminal or from a GUI.\nA few of the programs I just tried in 10.04 and 11.10 that will end are:\nping - which runs continuously by default, so this is the only way to stop it;\nfind - often takes a long time, so it's useful to be able to end it.\ngedit\n\n\nA: Actually, many programs will not stop on Ctrl+C because all it does is create an exception in currently running thread. Multithread programs as well as programs with \"In case of any exception, go on forward.\" sort of instructions will continue. \nThe proper case of actions will be either one of:   \n\n\n*\n\n*Use Ctrl + Break key combo.\n\n*Press Ctrl + Z. This will not stop program but will return you the command prompt. Then, do ps -ax | grep *%program_name%*. Find the line corresponding to the one yopu want to stop. The first integer in line will be program ID. Do kill -9 %id% to finally stop it. \n\n*If program also eats a lot of resources, you can use top command in a separate terminal to see the ID faster. \n\n\nA: I have faced this problem with one of my user having 10.04.\nThe same issue has been discussed here CTRL+C no longer works in terminal\nYou can however terminate command using CTRL+SHIFT+C\nIt seems like copy-to-clipboard and terminate commands switched their keyboard shortcuts.\n\nA: If you know the program's name, you can use pkill in another terminal. For example, if the program's name is mutt:\npkill mutt\n\nwill terminate the mutt program who wouldn't respond to CTRL + C\n\nA: First: top (See the PID number of the program that you want to kill its run.)\nSecond: kill PID\n", "Q: How to use host names rather than ip addresses on home network? I've a small home network up and running and managed to set up ssh. Can anyone tell me what I need to do to refer to one computer on the network from another by host name rather than IP address (which is what I'm doing now)?\n\nA: You can refer to machines by by tacking a .local to the hostname, like so:\nssh machinename.local\n\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*What does \".local\" do?\n\nA: There are more elaborate ways, but my method is to use static IP addressed, which I can assign from my router, and enter the addresses into my hosts file.\nOnce you get a static address assigned, either from the router or from the Network Connections dialog (in the IPv4 tab under the Wired or Wireless tab), you edit /etc/hosts, using sudo or gksu with your preferred text editor, such as gedit or vim, and add a line for each host like so:  \n192.168.1.100    ComputerName1\n192.168.1.101    ComputerName2\n\nThe numbers I use are common ones, but your LAN could be different.  The names are whatever you want to call the remote computer, and can be anything (though probably best to match the real name).  You can also create local websites by name here, if you have a local web server.\n", "Q: After installing 'World of Goo'...very bad things happened...help?

But only files currently opened/written should be affected, Firefox, Gnome or KDE settings would be obvious candidates, while other files should be fine. Which files exactly did you lose?\nSome file systems are extremely susceptible to those problems, namely I had so much issues with XFS that I would recommend to stay the hell away from that. With other file systems I never had those issues, namely Ext3 always worked just fine even with regular system crashes. Ext4 had those issues early in development, but it should have been fixed since then and I didn't have issues with that either so far. Which file system are you using?\nAs for data recovery, there is no automatic system wide backup/undo/restore in Linux.

This line tells the kernel to load the driver file, at boot time.\n\n\n*Then run this command sudo depmod -a -e.\n\n\n*Then sudo update-initramfs -u\n\n\n*Then restart. This problem should never arise again after that.\nBut as a precaution, You can do this to prevent errors.\nOpen a terminal and type lsmod | grep bcm, if it returns a line like below,\n    bcm_wimax             244941  2\n\nYou are free to insert the modem. If it does not return any line, you should do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and type sudo modprobe bcm_wimax to insert the module manually.\n\nNote: From my experience, I see that, you have to wait around 10-15 seconds to get the driver ready. So, do not insert the modem after just running the command.\n", "Q: Creating Quicklist for Tomboy Notes I tried to create a tomboy quicklist for Unity by copying the tomboy.desktop\nusing the guide here\nWhat Custom Launchers and Unity Quicklists are available?\nusing the man page for Tomboy it says you can open tomboy using \ntomboy  --open-note [title/url]\nThis works well when the application is closed.

I need to install a non-PAE kernel for a 64-bit machine that supports PAE. 32-bit 12.04 currently comes with a PAE kernel but I need to get a non-PAE kernel. An older version of Ubuntu is also acceptable as long as it runs in 32-bit mode. \n\nA: \n32-bit 12.04 currently comes with a PAE kernel but I need to get a non-PAE kernel.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*It's as simple as doing this on your existing 32-bit 12.04 installation:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install linux-image-generic\n\n\n*followed by a this to remove the PAE kernel (so the system boots from the non-PAE by default):\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get remove linux-image-generic-pae\n\n*Alternatively, comment out the GRUB_HIDDEN lines in /etc/default/grub and run sudo update-grub to display the grub menu upon boot, from which you can select the kernel to use.\n\n\n*If you want to install a non-PAE kernel as part of a new installation, start with Xubuntu or Lubuntu 12.04 32-bit, both of which come with the non-PAE kernel.

I have a new 2TB external hard drive I will be using for additional storage and backup. I will only use it on two Ubuntu machines. Is it recommended to format the drive to ext4? Are there any advantages in doing so?\n\nA: I'd recommend it. ext4 is the default file system for Ubuntu for good reason. As a side benefit, you can use the Disk Utility to encrypt the entire drive with a very strong password. That way if you ever lose the external drive (or if it is stolen), your data can't ever be accessed by a third party.\nI use ext4 on all my drives, internal and external. For those drives that need to work with a friends Windows machine, I'll have a small FAT or NTFS partition.\n\nA: In the time since this question received its answers, Windows support for reading and writing ext4 has improved substantially. See for example the Ext2Fsd project. What I do is create a small extra FAT partition containing a recent version of Ext2Fsd so that I can access the ext4 partition from other Windows computers (permissions allowing).\nI should also add that another good reason for preferring ext4 to NTFS is efficiency of linux support for NTFS. In my case, while using rsnapshot to do backups to external media from Ubuntu, moving to ext4 substantially lessened the time taken to recursively unlink directories.\n\nA: I think the core part of your question that is important is\n\nI will only use it on two Ubuntu machines.\n\nI faced the same dilemma as you and chose EXT4. The primary reasons I chose EXT4 are because 1) EXT4 will preserve my file permissions and 2) EXT4 better manages the storage of the data on it (e.g., it doesn't need to be constantly defragged and \"coddled\" like NTFS does). EXT4 is a more self-reliant file system than NTFS.\nThe only negative to using EXT4 is that you won't be able to access the data on it via a Windows machine. But as you said in your question, this won't be a problem because you are only using Ubuntu machines.\nIMHO, the only reason to use NTFS is if you need to access the filesystem with Windows. If you don't, NTFS is really an inferior file system.\n\nA: I would say no, simply because, for your own convenience, you may well want to use it on other machines in the future.  (specifically Windows).\nI was in a similar position to you a couple of years back.  Later, I had a requirement to install Windows 7 as a Virtual Machine and wanted to access files on the external drive.  Although it was possible by installing extfs on the Windows VM, the settings wouldn't save - so now whenever I need Windows, the first thing I have to do is hunt down the extfs installer, configure, then I can access the drive.\nOf course you may be 99.99999% certain you'll never touch Windows (lucky you if that's the case :-) ) but my point is just it's difficult to fully judge future requirements, and so for the sake of losing the few benefits you'd get from Ext4 on an external drive, you're probably best going with fat32 - if just for compatibility reasons.\nBut, as I mentioned above, it's worth noting you can access Ext3 drives on Windows (not sure about Ext4) - it's just a hassle to get access to them set up on Windows 7.  So it is an option, even given what I've said.\n\nA: If you will be using it only on those two machines and plan to be religious about properly unmounting the drive before disconnecting the USB/powering it off, then yes, ext4 is highly recommended.\n\n\n*\n\n*ext4 will give you improved performance over ext3, particularly when trying to write multiple files at the same time or when creating a large file. \n\n*The tradeoff is a slightly higher chance of data loss if the drive is not properly unmounted.\n\nA: The answer depends on your precise requirements.\next4 has become the default filesystem for several of the popular Linux distributions including Ubuntu, Fedora and openSUSE. ext4 features several improvements over its predecessor, amongst which include support for files upto 16 tebibytes ( 1 tebibytes equals 1,024 gibibyes , with 1gibibyte equal to 1.074 gigabytes) and a maximum volume size of upto 1 Exbibyte. It is backward compatible with ext3 and ext2, making it possible to mount ext3 and ext2 as ext4. This will slightly improve performance, because certain new features of ext4 can also be used with ext3 and ext2, such as the new block allocation algorithm.\nXFS is a highly scalable, high-performance file system which was originally designed at Silicon Graphics, Inc. It was created to support extremely large filesystems.  XFS supports a maximum file system size of 8 exbibytes minus one (i.e. 263-1 bytes), though this is subject to block limits imposed by the host operating system. 32-bit Linux systems limit both file and file system size to 16 tebibytes.\nThere is a lot of information out there on this subject, but I would Start Here and try to explore if you want to take this further.\nI hope this helps.\nSources:\n\n*\n\n*http://techie-buzz.com/foss/google-implements-ext4.html\n\n\n*http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/6.0_Release_Notes/filesystems.html\n", "Q: Accidentally deleted a folder I've been using Ubuntu 12.04 and accidentally deleted a folder using Shift+Del.\nDoes anyone have any idea how to recover the folder?\n\nA: Yes, you can use extundelete command.

It also doesn't work with forwarding URLs like Google Docs\nhttps://docs.google.com/?pli=1#home.\nOn a side note wasn't this meant to be a feature for web apps, a buzz word today.\n\nA: The Chrome extension, Clutter Free, does exactly what you asked:\n\n\n*\n\n*switches to already open duplicate tab, when a new one is opened,\n\n*works on redirects as long as the final redirected url is already open\n\n\nDisclaimer: I'm the author for this extension. I too was looking for this solution, and ended up making the extension.\n\nA: There are two ways to do this: on the client, or on the server.\nFrom the server side, this would be possible, but Google would have to make changes in the code at the Gmail end. That's unlikely to occur because some people desire multiple tabs open at once.\nFrom the client side, this could be done in JavaScript but for the fact that browser vendors deliberately take steps to eliminate cross-site scripting vulnerabilities - browser tabs/windows mustn't know about each other's contents by design.\nThe most realistic way to achieve this is with a browser extension to handle this situation.  If you're thinking of writing it yourself, a good place to start is at StackOverflow with, i.e. \"How can I get a list of open URLs from a running instance of chromium-browser/chrome?\"  But it sounds like you're already pretty close to what you want by using the extension mentioned above.\n", "Q: \"Battery not present\" on Toshiba Satellite L500D I bought a new battery for my laptop a week ago and it worked fine up until last night when it wouldn't boot up.

I want to run fully functional Ubuntu on my Android device in chroot.\nBut I have some trouble with upstart. In chroot \"it will actually run /sbin/telinit\", so how i can run upstart or replace it with something else?\n\nA: You can't really run upstart itself in a chroot. For it to work, you'd need something like an LXC container. Unfortunately most Android kernels don't have the required options to allow LXC to work.\nWithout LXC, the way of getting a chroot on your phone is to run:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo debootstrap --foreign --arch=armhf precise precise\n\n*then copy precise/ to your phone\n\n*then on your phone (as root): chroot precise debootstrap/debootstrap --second-stage\n\n\nThat will give you a standard Ubuntu chroot on your phone, that you can then chroot into with \"chroot precise /bin/bash\".\nYou'll then need to mount /proc and /sys for it to be somewhat usable.\nShould you be lucky enough to have a phone where the kernel and userspace works with LXC and can get it manually installed on your phone, the following should work:\n\n\n*\n\n*lxc-create -t ubuntu -n my-container -- -r precise -a armhf\n\n*lxc-start -n my-container\n\n\nThis will create an Ubuntu 12.04 armhf container and start it, you'll then get the usual login prompt (login/password is ubuntu/ubuntu by default).\n\nA: See Linux Deploy and my recent pull request which supports using Upstart in user session mode for running services in a chroot.  I think this is a much better approach than symlinking /bin/true to /sbin/telinit.\n", "Q: What dangers can come from using packages like janitor,compiz? As I look around on askubuntu I frequently see that programs intended for ubuntu are suggested not to  be used because they could break Ubuntu.\nSuch as janitor,compiz and I am sure there are also others.\nOn one hand you have people raving about ubuntu tweak and on the other you have people saying stay away from janitor.I personally came over to ubuntu thinking it was customizable.\nDoes anyone have a list of things that could break ubuntu ? Or is this just a hit and miss based on different hardware configurations?\n\nA: This will always depend on the level of skills and understanding a user has about Linux in general and Ubuntu.\nLike everything in computers doing stuff around were you have no idea what is going to happen is never a good choice. It can happen with Linux, Windows, Mac OS and all the rest.\nThe thing is most people will see all packages that run in Ubuntu as something that is part of Ubuntu and should be Ubuntu's responsibility to support them and fix everything related to then in case something happens.\nAt the same time if a Windows user crashes a system because he remembered to install some random software that clean up his registry, he will probably blame the software he installed. This is just an example.\nUbuntu tests in Alpha and Beta stages of a release for problems with packages, it is not in anyways responsible to what happens to your system by using them. The same goes for guides and random commands you see in the Internet. If you do not know what you are doing or what a package will do to your system the best choice will be not to use them.\nA clear case of that is CCSM, normally people will recommend it every time someone asks Is there a way of customizing X in Compiz.\nCCSM is great! But a very elaborate and complex tool because Compiz is elaborate and complex. People need to realize that using it can break your system if you do not know what you are doing. People still want to use it to customize X and Y, but that is their choice. You cannot blame Ubuntu for what you do to your system using it.\nUnless you know what you are doing or you know how to revert back I would stay away from anything that involves:\n\n\n*\n\n*Random PPAs with improved versions or bleeding edge versions for your system;\n\n*Random packages that promise automation of of cleaning and managing packages;\n\n*Customization software that is proven to be unstable or has a red tag on it saying This might break stuff up!;\n\n*Random commands that promise to turn your computer in to a super dupper Unicorn powered system, which you don't understand or you have no idea how to revert them in case something goes kapot.\n\n\nMake sure you learn your system and make sure that what you are using is really required, most of the times it will prove not to be the case. In the end it up to the user, low are the cases were a actual package breaks stuff around just because it is installed.\n\nA: Or is this just a hit and miss based on different hardware configurations\nFor that matter , ubuntu has a Cautionary warning ( Could break System Components) for the  use of third party PPA's . Ubuntu Tweak being one of them , Specifically i won't trust use of ubuntu Tweak Janitor, Neither Computer-Janitor ( for it being dropped since last version).I believe Ubuntu architects and programmer know the design and interface of Ubuntu better than Third Party providers, perhaps they also have better CLI tools for that ,such as \nFor clearing up of the packages from the apt-cache which are no longer downloadable:  \n\nsudo apt-get autoclean\n\nFor clearing up of the apt-cache : \n\nsudo apt-get clean\n\nFor cleaning up of any unused dependencies: \n\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nAlthough i tried Bleachbit till Oneric , but it was somehow not recommended for 12.04 LTS version , so i tried using the above alternates which are seriously safe .\nAs far as Dangers from such programs are concerned , it highly depends on the Choice of  User based on his Os and its inner working-understanding Knowledge. \nEven Compiz is  being dropped from next Ubuntu Version ( I guess so).\nBasically if third Party or not recommended programs are used for system cleaning , tunning ( Not  tweaking), some imbalances are bound to occur availing  End-User to be  Responsible for it.\n", "Q: wireless networking I want to connect to the internet through my ipod by creating a wireless network on my laptop.

What is the differences between Ubuntu existing general kernel of 11.10 vs so called linux rt kernel?\n\n\n*\n\n*does audio delay depends on general kernel vs rt kernel?

In technical slang hard realtime systems should always meet their deadlines. Thus developers should use the most advanced programming techniques (sleeping spinlocks, PI Mutex, Full preemption, IRQ Threads and others) and sacrifice things like reliability, power-saving and throughput. Almost all parts of kernel should be analysed to guarantee that right behaviour always occurs.\nThe goal of -preempt and -lowlatency (soft real-time) kernels is to achieve good realtime characteristics, meanwhile offering welcomed features like rock-solid reliability, good power-saving features and also good throughput. But in this way it can't guarantee lowest latency under all conditions.\n\n\nYou audio Delay Issue\nTo you audio delay problem, the -realtime and -rt (hard real-time) kernels are your best option to achieve the lowest possible latency at every cost, thus reducing the sound delay.\nTake note that other mitigating circumstances may be influencing your audio performance.\n\nTo answer your question directly\n\ndoes audio delay depends on general kernel vs rt kernel? Where some audio capture looks like it has always a few MS delay.\n\nYes, the kernel type being used influences the hardware performance, thus influencing details like the audio delay.\nHave it said, using -realtime and -rt (hard real-time) kernels, that have a more aggressive configuration, can further reduce latency, being this your best choice.\n", "Q: Where can I download Liberation Font family for use on Windows 7?

Is there some way to have a custom grid for resizing windows? CompizConfig allows me to configure the \"grid\" feature, but it only supports resizing to half the screen. Is there some way that I can set a custom size and location for the active window using key bindings? I've tried using xdotool, but it's not working.\n\nA: The answer is QuickTile, which can be found here:\nhttp://ssokolow.com/quicktile/\nI never figured out how to customize it, because I changed my monitor setup to an entirely different solution, but if you come across this question and want a solution, this program should work quite well.\n", "Q: difference between bash.bashrc and /etc/environment file Till date I used to set my environment variables in the bash.bashrc file. Recently I was told to use the /etc/environment file. Well, both work fine.\nSo, what is the difference between them?\nI googled this and I found \"bashrc is used for particular user and environment, system wide\". What is meant by system wide here? /etc/bash.bashrc is also applying changes system wide I guess. Correct me if I am wrong. Any kind of help will be appreciated..\n\nA: And as you are asking about \"system wide\":\nConfiguration files located in the /etc directory apply to all users on the system. For /etc/bash.bashrc this would mean to all and everything that's using the \"Borne Again SHell\" aka Bash on that machine. Even if you're the only human using it, there could be \"technical users\" affected (simply take a look into the /etc/passwd and check how often the term \"/bin/bash\" is stated there -- or use grep bash /etc/passwd | wc -l, which should give you that number directly (meaning: \"grab\" all lines containing the string \"bash\" from the file \"/etc/passwd\", and send the results (\"|\") to the command \"wc\" (word count) to count the lines (\"-l\").\nSo for your user, it is much safer to modify ~/.bashrc instead (meaning the file \".bashrc\" -- with a leading dot, yes -- in your home-directory, e.g. /home/ankur/.bashrc), which then just affects your user and leaves everything else alone. Files in /etc should only be changed if system-wide changes are really intended.\nBesides: Both configurations will be used if they exist. First, the system-wide file (here: /etc/bash.bashrc) is read and \"sourced\" (it's settings applied to the current session), and then the users /home/username/.bashrc is handled the same, and thus can add to or even change/overwrite settings from the global /etc/bash.bashrc file.\n\nA: Beyond the system wide and user wide scope discussion, one most significant difference is /etc/environment is not a script other than ~/.bashrc.\nYou cannot dereference variable inside /etc/environment, its variable assignment which takes line value literally (as already mentioned by roadmr).\nYour Ubuntu will lock you out if you screw up the $PATH inside /etc/environment by trying to append new path\nPATH=$PATH:/new_path\n\nIf your Ubuntu Gnome or Unity login page failed in letting you in without complaining wrong password. And you have recently modified /etc/environment, it's most likely the case.\nA fix is to login virtual console CTRL+ALT+F1 login console, manually check $PATH, and fix /etc/environment file.\nAccording to this, /etc/environment is loaded by PAM stack, which populates environment variable line by line.\n\nA: One difference is that /etc/environment contains only variable definitions and doesn't appear to go through any sort of variable expansion/interpolation. Thus, you can't reference variables in definitions. This for instance won't work:\nA=\"else\"\nB=\"something $A\"\n\nB will literally be something $A, not the expected something else.\nSee this question.\nBy the way, the answer you found through Google appears to be referring to a user's ~/.bashrc, rather than the system-wide /etc/bash.bashrc. That may be causing your confusion.\n\nA: The /etc/environment file sets the variable system wide for every user on boot. Commands in the /etc/bash.bashrc are is executed if the bash shell is opened by any user. So the variables would not be set unless a bash shell is opened at least one time.\n\nA: The difference between the two is that the /etc/enivironment file will work for all of the users while the bash.bashrc file will particularly work for that user only. And if you do anything wrong in the /etc/environment file then the consequences may be severe while you can easily undo the changes in the bash.bashrc file by copying the contents of the /etc/environment file. But the first preference is give to the bash.bashrc file and then to /etc/environment file. It is not that if you make changes in the bash.bashrc file then the terminal will give first preference to the local user file (i.e., bash.bashrc) and then to the main file (i.e., /etc/environment).\n", "Q: How do I run a script on a dbus signal? Is it possible to run a script on an arbitrary dbus signal? Something like Upstart that runs as an unprivileged user and doesn't require root perms to modify?\nI ask because I've already written a silly script that waits for bluetooth events to start my music player. Now I'd like to do something similar when my machine connects to specific networks, or other devices attach. \nEDIT: My original question didn't specify this, but I meant \"associate a number of scripts with one of a set of events\" - so I'd have the same launcher-y thing (like Upstart) that manages a number of scripts, each of which cares about a different dbus signal. All in user space. \n\nA: I wrote a simple tool for this purpose: https://github.com/jluttine/dbus-listen\nThe same example as in the other answer could look as follows. Write the script that should be executed when the signal is received:\n#!/bin/bash\nprintf \"Now playing: \"\nrhythmbox-client --print-playing\n\nListen to the signal (assuming the above script is named myscript.sh):\ndbus-listen --interface org.gnome.Rhythmbox.Player --member playingUriChanged myscript.sh\n\nThe other answer using dbus-monitor doesn't work when you need to listen to the system bus.\n\nA: You need the dbus-monitor\nThe script will look something like\n#!/bin/bash\n\ninterface=org.gnome.Rhythmbox.Player\nmember=playingUriChanged\n\n# listen for playingUriChanged DBus events,\n# each time we enter the loop, we just got an event\n# so handle the event, e.g. by printing the artist and title\n# see rhythmbox-client --print-playing-format for more output options\n\ndbus-monitor --profile \"interface='$interface',member='$member'\" |\nwhile read -r line; do\n  printf \"Now playing: \"\n  rhythmbox-client --print-playing\ndone\n\nTaken from stackoverflow.\n", "Q: How to recover from a partial system upgrade? When I was given the option to Upgrade to Ubuntu 12.10 I did try to Upgrade, but while it was upgrading the internet connection was lost and the system went through a partial upgrade.\nNow when I try to open the Update  Manager or the Software Sources it opens and crashes automatically.\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: When package upgrades are interrupted in midway, normally doing sudo dpkg --configure -a && sudo apt-get -f install && sudo apt-get upgrade will save the situation, but when is a full release upgrade (jumping from a version to another) the steps becomes more tricky.\nWhat's the best solution for this cases? Reinstall. If you are not capable to reinstall, you may want to continue the upgrade using sudo update-manager-text or sudo apt-get dist-upgrade (the last one you shall modify your sources.list from oneiric to precise, see my command at the end), but that I won't guarantee will work. Other option is sudo do-releases-upgrade, but you must make sure that the process is not interrupted this time around.\nTo use apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo sed s/oneiric/precise/g /etc/apt/sources.list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n\nA: Experienced a similar problem with my old laptop. I tried most of the suggestions above but kept coming with the same \"partial upgrade\" problem which when you run it fails giving other permissions/upgrade errors. \nAfter many attempts I decided to give synaptic package manager a try. I chose the option for custom filters - then the option for \"marked changes\" and found one linux header marked as upgradable. Immediately upgraded the package which went smoothly. Then reloaded synaptic again and went down the same options in custom filters - this time I chose the option \"upgradable(upstream). Found more packages that had failed in the upgrade and upgraded those. \nReloaded synaptic once more and this time around synaptic found fewer packages that needed upgrading. After upgrading the last few packages I rebooted and everything went on smooth from there.

It could be a hardware fault (bad RAM, say) that caused the installer to flake out and corrupt everything; or it could be a bug in the installer; or it could be a buggy EFI implementation; or any number of other possibilities. Unless you can find somebody who's had the same problem on the same or a closely-related model, it'll take some effort to debug this problem.\n\n*Will Ubuntu install on a GPT disk partition? -- Yes, at least, assuming there are no bugs in the firmware or hardware problems to block it. I've done numerous Ubuntu installations to GPT disks, under both BIOS and EFI firmware.\n\n*Will it install alongside Windows 7? -- Yes, although boot loader issues can sometimes require tweaking the setup afterward. For instance, on EFI-based systems, GRUB 2 often fails to add an appropriate entry for Windows, which requires adding a new entry manually (or, IMHO better, replacing GRUB 2 with a more reliable boot loader).\n\n*How do I do it? -- I recommend you begin by running some hardware diagnostics. If you find no hardware faults, you'll have to track down the problem with your system, which is likely to be extremely system-specific, and so better suited for solving in a Web forum, Usenet newsgroup, or other more interactive place than this one.\n\n", "Q: interpreting Sensors command line output I need some help in interpreting  the output of sensors command :\nacpitz-virtual-0\nAdapter: Virtual device\ntemp1:        +56.0°C  (crit = +128.0°C)\ntemp2:        +67.0°C  (crit = +128.0°C)\ntemp3:        +38.0°C  (crit = +128.0°C)\ntemp4:        +51.0°C  (crit = +128.0°C)\ntemp5:        +27.0°C  (crit = +128.0°C)\ntemp6:         +0.0°C  (crit = +128.0°C)\ntemp7:         +0.0°C  (crit = +128.0°C)\ntemp8:         +0.0°C  (crit = +128.0°C)\n\ncoretemp-isa-0000\nAdapter: ISA adapter\nPhysical id 0:  +59.0°C  (high = +86.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\nCore 0:         +59.0°C  (high = +86.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\nCore 1:         +57.0°C  (high = +86.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\n\nradeon-pci-0100\nAdapter: PCI adapter\ntemp1:        +67.0°C  \n\nthanks a lot\n\nA: The output of sensors is usually pretty raw and it really depends on the Kernel support for your particular I²C bus, and how the monitors are attached to the system.\nHaving said that, the coretemp-isa-0000 ones are obviously your CPU.\nThe rest are a bit more of a guess.

How do I get it to work?\n\nA: Quite frankly you can't \"enable\" it (file preview). It is an application specific feature, which most developers don't seem to bother with. You will notice that in some applications, (for example the GIMP) you will get image previews, but for the most part you won't see any.\nAs for other features like creating/deleting folders, these have (for some reason) not been implemented.\nUpdate:\nIn Gnome 3.18, renaming and deleting folders will now be possible from the file manager, though some of the other outstanding features are not yet known to be in development at this time. Seems there is some hope for common sense out of the Gnome camp.\n\nA: Not sure if this is an option for you, but Nautilus(called Files) in Ubuntu 13.04 has the image preview, via a \"Grid\" view of a folder.\nAlso, you can still create a folder (or delete) using keyboard shortcuts.

I know that to launch an application and still keep working on the terminal, & is put in the end of command (like emacs&)\nBut some commands still keep printing on the terminal, like this \n\nSo how to really keep the command quiet on the terminal?\n\nA: What you are seeing are the errors, being printed to stderr (standard error). By default stderr is printed to the terminal used to start the program. We can change this easily though, to point to /dev/null, which is basically a black hole. It's a device that doesn't do anything, so when you write to it, nothing actually happens. The following command will redirect ALL output (stderr and stdout) to /dev/null and then give you back your terminal.\nfirefox &> /dev/null &\n\nThe &> is the redirector, /dev/null is where we are redirecting to, and the last & means to \"background\" the process, so we can have our terminal back.\nOn a side note, if you ever want to bring a backgrounded program back to the terminal, you can use the fg (short for foreground) command to bring it back. And if you type the combination of keys Ctrl+Z you will be able to \"suspend\" the process, then you can type bg to send it back to background. \n", "Q: nvidia-settings not able to save my configuration (This is a continuation of thread: Installing nvidia driver?).\nI am able to detect and configure an external monitor using nvidia-settings program.

I want to perform just security updates on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, keeping the rest of the system unchanged. I need to do this from the command line, no the GUI update manager. I have implemented the solution described here, which seems to work great for this purpose. I merely substituted 'precise' for 'lucid' given that I am on 12.04.\nMy question is: by using apt pinning as described in that answer, will I still receive security updates for packages distributed through the \"other\" repositories - partner,  restricted, multiverse, etc? Or will it only get me updates for the packages in the \"core\" distribution?\nthanks!\n~l\n\nA: No security updates for partner by default\nYou will get security updates for all your regular repositories, including main, restricted, universe and multiverse, but not for partner.\nThe top-level structure of the precise-security repository makes this quite clear:\n\nWhy not?\nThe packages in partners are basically proprietary binaries wrapped in a .deb. Incremental \"security\" updates are not released for these, just regular updates (new versions), which may include security updates. To find out if an update addresses security issues, either look at the provider's page for the update or in the changelog at the launchpad \"source\" page. The latter is typically easier, e.g. for Adobe Reader (acroread), go to:\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/acroread\n\n\n*\n\n*Expanding the latest release for Precise 12.04 shows you the changelog (emphasis added):\n\nNew upstream release, addresses security issues:\nhttp://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb12-08.html\nCVE-2012-0774\nCVE-2012-0775\nCVE-2012-0776\nCVE-2012-0777\n\nWell, how do I quickly check for regular updates to partner, then?\nThe partners repository contains just fifteen packages, and I imagine even regular updates are infrequent (think Adobe Reader). Given the tiny size (5 kb) of the partner update file, I'd just add the actual repository (deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu precise partner) to any \"quick check\" sources.list file.\n\nNote: While precise-security exists on the partner server, it is (as expected) empty.\n\n\nA: The Security Updates includes all the repositories (restricted, multiverse, etc.).\nAnd the solution you say (which is useful and I recommend it) is only to receive Security Updates.

Basically it's working fine -- but it is very slow to react in certain situations.\nHelper questions\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Could it be that changing away from Bonobo has to do with slowing-down? \n  \n*There might be some trouble with the new engine and \"asynchronous actions\". What to do about it? Are there e.g. any configuration files?\n  \n*I want to get the previous \"working mood\" back. How can I speed this thing up?\n\nDifferent scenarios\n\n  \n*\n  \n*when sending a mail, the composer window hangs there inactive for a couple of seconds, everything grayed out (the bigger the message/attachments, the longer it takes). Though there is a green check mark saying it's sent, I'm not sure a) why it's still blocking everything and b) whether I could simply close it without \"breaking\"/\"losing\" anything. In earlier versions, the composer window was closing pretty fast, and one could see the message being stored into the local \"outbox\" until it was sent, and one could immediately continue with the next task. I prefer that behaviour over the current, where I cannot do anything in the application until the window closes.\n  \n*switching between modules. Coming from mail and switching to the address book takes a couple of seconds. Same for switching to the\n  calendar. I read about different \"possible causes\" and tried a few\n  things:\n  \n*\n  \n*I only have 3 local address books, so no networking should be involved here. To make sure, I switched to offline mode and then tried\n  to access the address book. No noticeable difference.\n  \n*I use 3 Google Calendars. Switching to offline mode made a minor difference, but so minor that it also could be \"imagination\" since one\n  might have expected this in this case\n  \n*according to some reports, disabling the tasks should help. Well, it didn't in my case, as I don't use them regularly (just two local items stored here)\n  \n  \n\nMaybe I should also mention that I'm using the KDE4 desktop (so no Unity or Gnome, though both is installed on the computer). And I did not have this issue before I updated to 12.04.\n\nA: While I did it for different reasons, it may help to upgrade to Evolution 3.4. Ubuntu intentionally remained on an older version of Evolution (and some other Gnome applications) for 12.04, due to insufficient testing. That said, I haven't had any of the issues you're describing.\nThanks to a helpful fellow AU member, I found the Stracciatella PPA, which has all the Gnome 3.4 stuff. Installing Evolution itself was pretty painless, though Ubuntu really doesn't want you to, so you have to tell it to do so explicitly.\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the repo: sudo apt-add-repository ppa:janvitus/gnomestracciatella\n\n*Update apt (sudo apt-get update)\n\n*Install Evolution (sudo apt-get install evolution)\n\n*Remove or disable the PPA, so Ubuntu doesn't continue to complain that it can't update everything.\n\n\nA: After doing some more Google-Fu I found a similar looking problem for an (even) older version of Evolution, where a \"buggy\" plugin was causing the trouble. Not having that particular plugin enabled or even installed, I went over the ones which were enabled. Everything being clearly not needed in my case, I disabled:\n\n\n*\n\n*dbx-import (MS Outlook stuff -- I never needed)\n\n*pst-import (again MS Outlook)\n\n*face (I prefer plain-text mails either, so no need to attach my face)\n\n*auto-contacts (everytime you answer a mail, the recipient gets added to your address book -- I never needed that)\n\n*email-custom-header (nice stuff to play with, adding custom headers to all mails you send -- but certainly not essential)\n\n*mark-all-read (rarely used this)\n\n\nLooks like I managed to improve the situation a lot: Switching between components got much faster (instead of 5-10s, it now takes less than 1s), the composer window now closes within ~2s (instead of 10+ seconds).\nSo things are almost back to normal. Still doesn't feel that smooth as before the update to 12.04 (especially the composer window \"hanging around\") -- but that might as well be imagination. The small delay now left is something I can really live with -- as opposed to the laggy behaviour before.\nI still might narrow down the responsible plugins when I feel the need for one of them (which might only happen with the last two), in which case I will update my answer here. But for now I'm happy things got so much smother -- and don't want to \"touch the running system\" at the moment :)\n\nEDIT: This seemed to only have brought a temporary improvement. After Evolution has been running for several hours, it slows down again. Not so much in component switching -- but the composer window still stays open until the message has been completely sent, which is especially annoying with large messages having e.g. large attachments. So I'm still looking for a solution on this -- what I have now is, if at all, just a partly work-around at best.\n\nA: How it magically solved\nI had already given up on this, when it suddenly solved itself as side-effect of something else. The culprit once more (and I should already have expected that plus being used to it) seemed to be KDE4's plasma desktop: Having switched to LXDE about a week ago, a lot of things became excitingly snappy (including Firefox and Evolution), a bunch of other problems mysteriously disappeared1,2, and I'm left almost happy with the situation -- except for the mail-window on sending a message, which still does not close immediately as in previous versions (but neither does take that long anymore), and the \"switch\" introduced a really minor new issue concerning my SuperKaramba status bar.\nTL;DR:\nBeing a KDE user for almost 20 years now (yeah, that long, when in the 1990s KDE1 was introduced), I never wanted that plasma-desktop in the first place. So until I had to switch to a new machine last year, I was still using KUbuntu 8.04 as the latest LTE supporting KDE 3.5.*. I didn't want to setup my new machine with an outdated system either, which made me install Ubuntu 12.04 with KDE 4.x (including its plasma-desktop). If you browse my questions (not that many), you will see I immediately had a bunch of problems: plasma ate my memory3, Evolution got slow until being almost unusable if not closed and restarted twice a week (this question here), plus more things I didn't even dare asking1,2. And the hard time getting rid of Nepomuk, Akonadi, and all the other unwanted services I didn't ask for!\nSo it's a somehow sad thing to break up with KDesktop after almost 20 years -- but it looks like it's time for a change. About 8 days into being a LXDE user, I must say I hardly miss a thing -- except for my SuperKaramba status bar which I configured and adjusted over the last 10 years to exactly fit my needs, and does not behave correctly anymore4.\n\nSo to stop my \"rant\": If you're using a lot of Gnome apps (especially Evolution), KDE4 is no good choice for your desktop environment. If you neither a friend of Unity (and all its background services, like in my case), consider using LXDE, XFCE or E17 (Enlightment) instead -- saves you a lot of headache! You still can use your favorite KDE apps if needed (for me this includes Okular, Gwenview, Qps, K3B, and KTerminal).\nAnd if you didn't see me updating this question/answer within the next 3 months, you can safely assume this answer really solved it. Being cautions, I still will wait a little time before accepting it :)\n\nFootnotes\n1 one other problem solved along: when editing a mail, and switching signatur or formatting via the corresponding drop-downs, I was no longer able to write in the editor window. After a few weeks I found a work-around (opening some menu, closing it again, and writing became possible), but it still was annoying\n2 using the desktop pager to switch to another desktop took up to a minute, while plasma was completely frozen. Until the switch finally fired, I could still work in apps open on the \"old\" desktop, though.\n3 without showing up such in top, memstat, and other tools -- see Free RAM disappears - Memory leak?\n4 see Superkaramba on LXDE ignores theme position and cannot handle lock/unlock?. I tried it with Screenlets (which claims to handle SuperKaramba themes), but all I get to see with it is the background image. It currently displays everything fine using superkaramba from plasma, but all actions are dead.\n\nA: Sad to see this is still an issue, but... something seems to be working for me now.\nI'm using Evolution 3.10.4 on an Ubuntu 14.04 install, and I have two google IMAP accounts (and a few other non-google accounts).

Instead do something like:\nxrandr --addmode VGA1 1024x768\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1024x768 --right-of LVDS1\n\nFor other users with a similar problem on all video outputs, first run xrandr to see what outputs you have.\n~$ xrandr -q\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1920 x 1080, maximum 8192 x 8192\neDP1 connected 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 294mm x 165mm\n   1920x1080      60.0*+   59.9     40.0  \n   1680x1050      60.0     59.9  \n   1600x1024      60.2  \n   1400x1050      60.0  \n   1280x1024      60.0  \n   1440x900       59.9  \n   1280x960       60.0  \n   1360x768       59.8     60.0  \n   1152x864       60.0  \n   1024x768       60.0  \n   800x600        60.3     56.2  \n   640x480        59.9  \nVGA1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n   1024x768       60.0  \nHDMI1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nDP1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n   1024x768       60.0  \n\nIn this case the main screen is called eDP1 and the additional outputs are VGA1, HDMI1 and DP1 (Mini DisplayPort)\nAs an example, to force output to the Mini DisplayPort at 720x480 run\nxrandr --addmode DP1 720x480\n\nand then\nxrandr --output DP1 --mode 720x480 --right-of eDP1\n\n\nA: If you has a display port, for example DP1, and needs to send the VGA signal into the display port because it is not detected, you should adapt the adapt the line proposed by Daniel Alder. Assuming your normal screen is eDP1 and your displayport is DP1:\n# Put your normal screen in 1024x768\nxrandr --output eDP1 --mode 1024x768\n# Add a mode for display port\nxrandr --addmode DP1 1024x768\n# Clone the normal screen to the display port\nxrandr --output DP1 --mode 1024x768 --same-as eDP1\n\nFor me it solve the non detection problem of some external projectors when there is a box that choose automatically what VGA input should be sent to the projector.\n\nA: I had problems with some VGA cables that has DDC (display data channel) broken or not connected.\nI found this useful workaround using boot parameter to force kernel to see a disconnected VGA: \nvideo={conn}:{res}e\nconn should match xrandr device name\nres 1024x768 (or what ever you prefer)\ne means to enable the port (even if no device/monitor is detected). \nSee:\nhttp://distro.ibiblio.org/fatdog/web/faqs/boot-options.html\n\nA: I have come to this page several times to fix the same problem as you guys have.\nHowever, It just happened to me recently that I had two exact the same monitors. One, my linux notebook have no problem detecting the correct resolution. The other it can't and stuck at 1024x768. \nAfter replacing the VGA cable, everything works perfectly fine. \nSo it may be worth checking your VGA cable. \n\nA: I've been experiencing this problem for a while now (Dell XPS13 9300 running xfce4 on 20.04 - driving HP V28 4K) and the only solution I've found thus far is to adopt the M$ approach and logout of the session and back in.\n", "Q: Upgrade Ubuntu CD Hello guys from Ask Ubuntu, I have a cd of Ubuntu 11.04 and I started it the Live CD, but it asks to upgrade to Ubuntu 11.10, I wonder if it will update my CD for ubuntu live CD without installing anything on my computer. \nthank you\n\nA: The LiveCD if it is written to a CD or DVD cannot be upgraded. You can ignore any warnings if it is giving you those. You would need to create a new LiveCD if this is the case.\n", "Q: Questions on Loop Devices and Mounting a Disk Image The commands are from here: Mount single partition from image of entire disk (device)\nAbout the first command' I need to \"Calculate the offset from the start of the image to the partition start\", but don't know what the numbers quoted in ** mean (512 in this example):\n$ sudo fdisk -lu sda.img\n...\nUnits = sectors of 1 * **512** = **512** bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): **512** bytes / **512** bytes\n...\n  Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\nsda.img1   *          56     6400000     3199972+   c  W95 FAT32 (LBA)\n\nabout the second command, what is the \"loop0\":\nsudo losetup -o 28672 /dev/loop0 sda.img\n\nI looked there and it looked like a text file but it isn't, it also not a folder.\nwhat is that file? Can I choose another name to it? If yes, should I create it before?\nHow does the third command works? What does every part in it mean?:\nsudo mount /dev/loop0 /mnt\n\nI already successfully ran the commands to do what I wanted, it's just important to me to understand it more for next time and for helping other.\nThanks for your answers and teaching me (:\n\nA: In the first command, the 512 number is referring to the block size of the image. When a file is written to a disk, it uses x amount of blocks. The remainder of any block not used is wasted space. This is why you sometimes see things listed as size (actual size of the file, folder, etc) and size on disk (amount of space actually taken up on disk, allowing for block size mismatch. Take, for example a 1234 byte file, if we were using 512 byte blocks, then it would actually take up 3 blocks, or 1536 bytes (512 * 3) and 302 bytes (1536 - 1234) bytes would be \"wasted\".\nThe loop0 is a loopback device. All files under /dev are actually devices (hence the name :-)). Linux treats devices as files which makes it very easy to accomplish some things when dealing with hardware. i.e. the following command will send an audio file directly to the soundcard to play (no software needed, neat!)\ncat sound.wav > /dev/audio\n\nLoopback devices are special pseudo or fake devices that Linux uses in cases like yours. What you are saying in that command is that you want Linux to treat your image file as a hard drive. This allows you to run any command that you would normally run on a hard drive, on your image file. \nFor the last command, we are simply mounting the file system on your fake drive (your image file) to a location on the local filesystem. With Linux, we use a flat directory structure, which is why every file location (including devices, network drives and external hard drives, etc) begins with '/', which is also referred to as the root of the filesystem. Mounting a filesystem simply puts it in a place accessible tot he rest of the system (somewhere under /).\nNow, by default only a user called \"root\" can mount filesystems. The root user is basically the same as an administrator user on Windows. Someone who can do anything on the computer. In Ubuntu, the root user is hidden for security, so we need to use sudo. The sudo command, basically means \"hey, make me the root user to run this one command\". \nmount here is the command that we are running as root (sudo), /dev/loop0 is our fake drive we created earlier, and /mnt is the location that we want the image to be accessible at. /mnt and /media are the standard locations in Linux where we mount filesystems, although this can be anywhere you want. It is best practice to create subfolder under /mnt or /media to mount to, instead of just /mnt. This is because you may have other filesystems mounted there, and if you mount over top of them, they will not be accessible! The only caveat to this, is that you need root privileges to create a folder here, so your last command should really be two commands, and look like this:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/myimg\nsudo mount /dev/loop0 /mnt/myimg\n\nmkdir is just the command to make a directory.\n", "Q: how to find the ppa of a package found in launchpad? I am trying to install a program (valgrind) which needs libc6-dbg. On the other hand, I cannot install libc6-dbg because:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n   libc6-dbg: Depends: libc6 (= 2.11.1-0ubuntu7) but 2.11.1-0ubuntu7.2 is to be installed\nE: Broken packages\n\nwhich means I have a newer version of libc6 installed. However:\nsudo apt-get install libc6-dbg=2.11.1-0ubuntu7.2\n\ndoesn't find anything. I am guessing I need to add the PPA containing that package, which is where I ran out of luck.\nI found the package I need here (my ubuntu is Lucid): https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/i386/libc6-dbg/2.11.1-0ubuntu7.2, however, I can't seem to figure out what I should do to get apt-get to see and install this package.\nHelp?\n\nA: -dbg packages provide debug symbols for programs and libraries provided by the packages that are named like them but without -dbg. (Sometimes they provide debug symbols for a whole group packages, typically whose names start like them without -dbg and then contain more text.)\nIn this case, you have libc6 installed (that's a core package without which no Ubuntu system can run), and you want to install libc6-dbg. This must correspond exactly to the installed version of libc6. Getting a separate version of libc6-dbg from a PPA that didn't correspond to the installed version of libc6 would be very bad--it would not be usable.\nAs this page indicates, on a Lucid system both libc6 and (if it is installed) libc6-dbg should be at version 2.11.1-0ubuntu7.10. So it looks like you have an old version of libc6 installed (which is possibly vulnerable to well-known security bugs!), for which libc6-dbg may no longer be available.\nNot only do you have an old version of libc6, but your information about what the latest versions of libc6 and libc6-dbg is out of date. Try this to correct it:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nIf you're installing packages on the command-line, you should always run that first (unless you've run it just recently).\nThen run this to upgrade your system's packages (including libc6):\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThen try again:\nsudo apt-get install libc6-dbg\n\nIf that still doesn't work, check your Software Sources (by going to the Update Manager and clicking the Settings... button at the lower-left corner). Click on the Updates Tab. Make sure that Important security updates (lucid-security) and Recommended updates (lucid-updates) are enabled (checked).\n\nThat image is taken from these instructions, written by Contributors to the Ubuntu documentation wiki and licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.

Thus my incorporation of that image is permitted here.\nThen after enabling those software sources, run these commands again:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nAnd then try again:\nsudo apt-get install libc6-dbg\n\n\nA: In general (answering your title question): for searching/adding ppa's you could use Y PPA Manager.\nAfter adding you update your sources and install the package from source you want...\n\nA: You should update your system, for example with\n sudo apt-get update\n sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nIf that doesn't help make sure you have the security updates enabled.\nThe current version of libc6 in Lucid is 2.11.1-0ubuntu7.10, the corresponding libc6-dbg is available from the official software sources.\n\nA: It looks like 'libc6-dbg' is the package name, and '=2.11.1-0ubuntu7.2' is the version. Try using\nsudo apt-get install libc6-dbg\n\nOr use the synaptic package manager. \nThese two methods will install a newer version of libc6-dbg. If you have to have the older one, you can download the .deb file for it on the right side of the launchpad page you linked.\n\nA: Maybe an update of libc6 and libc6-dbg would help?\nThere are newer versions (with security updates) of both packages available:\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/i386/libc6/2.11.1-0ubuntu7.10\nhttps://launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/i386/libc6-dbg/2.11.1-0ubuntu7.10\nI think 2.11.1-0ubuntu7 is not in the repositories anymore.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nshould solve the problem.\n", "Q: Stop sound from speakers when connecting headphones The problem is that I can hear the sound from my laptop's speakers even if I plugged in my headphones.

So I opened the command line alsamixer and navigated to the Auto-Mute Mode using the arrows (only Auto-Mut is visible in the terminal window) and set it from Disabled to Enabled. Now connecting the headphones mutes the internal speakers.\n\nA: What worked for me was to run alsamixer and enable the auto-mute option.

This happened to me once and then after fixing that pin of the headphones correctly it worked properly.\n\nA: I had the same exact problem with a fresh install of Xubuntu. I tried a buch of things including typing alsamixer in terminal. The option was not there for me to turn on the Headphone Jack Sense. I installed gnome-alsamixer and found the Headphone Jack Sense option, checked it and alas no audio from the pc speakers while headphones are plugged in. This worked for me. \n\nA: Running alsamixer in terminal worked for me, set it to Auto Mute and you should find your machine will play sound through one or the other rather than both\n\nA: in alsamixer, try using arrow key Up, then turn everything up to 100% and you will see the right bar turns up. After that turn down arrow key to % you like. Now it should be down together and your right speaker will work on both sides.\n\nA: On an Asus X551MA I was having this problem as soon as I replaced Windows with Ubuntu 14.04. Even if I muted the speakers in aslamixer, they would come back on unexpectedly. \nWhen I got to step three in this troubleshooting procedure, that seems to have fixed everything. It's a long complicated command which installed various packages, so I'm not sure which part(s) were really necessary:\nsudo apt-get update;sudo apt-get dist-upgrade; sudo apt-get install pavucontrol linux-sound-base alsa-base alsa-utils lightdm ubuntu-desktop linux-image-`uname -r` libasound2; sudo apt-get -y --reinstall install linux- sound-base alsa-base alsa-utils lightdm ubuntu-desktop linux-image-`uname -r` libasound2; killall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.pulse*; ubuntu-support-status; sudo usermod -aG `cat /etc/group | grep -e '^pulse:' -e '^audio:' -e '^pulse- access:' -e '^pulse-rt:' -e '^video:' | awk -F: '{print $1}' | tr '\\n' ',' | sed 's:,$::g'` `whoami`\n\n\nA: Simply just go to the alsamixer (alsamixer in terminal) and use the right/left arrow keys to navigate to the speakers setting and click M. This will disable the speakers but not the headphones.\n\nA: This worked for me (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS running on Compaq NC6120 laptop):\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl+Alt+T (to open terminal)\n\n*Type alsamixer\n\n*Press → until you get to the \"Headphone Jack Sense\" option\n\n*Press m to enable (automatically mute the speakers when headphone is plugged in)\n\n", "Q: Unity quicklist for home is messed up I can't change Home Folder quicklist options.

When the system asks me for the password when installing anything, I found everything useless means non of my old password work. \n\nA: I tried to follow reverendj1's instructions (See above?  Below?  Every time I refresh this page, the articles swap positions), and they didn't work for me on Ubuntu 12.04.1.  I had two issues:\n1) Simply booting into recovery mode apparently mounts your root partition as read-only, so you can't modify any system files.  Another page addresses this, you need to execute this command from the root prompt in order to obtain write privileges:\nmount -o remount /dev/[your root partition]\n\n2) But even after I had write privileges, the useradd -G command wasn't working for me.  When I tried to execute it, the system would just return the help screen for the useradd command.  I don't know why.  But I decided to use usermod -aG instead, and that worked.  I added my user name to each of the 16 groups in reverendj1's instructions, one at a time.  I was being conservative, I saw some error messages I didn't understand when I was experimenting with useradd.  Afterwards, I looked at the man page for usermod, and it looks like you could just list the 16 groups all at once, tacking on the user name at the end.\nHere's how you can double-check that you did everything correctly.  Compare the output of the following command, before and after you make changes:\nmore /etc/group\n\nYou should see that your user name has been added to the groups you specified.\n\nA: This is actually fairly easy. By making yourself a non-administrator, you just removed yourself from several groups. First you will need to boot into recovery mode. To do that, reboot your computer, and when the grub menu pops up, highlight the top option that says \"(recover mode)\" at the end. More information on recovery mode can be found here, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveryMode\nOnce everything boots up, you will be dumped at a terminal, logged in as root (no password required). Simply enter the following command (for Ubuntu 11.10):\nuseradd -G root adm dialout fax cdrom floppy tape admin audio dip video plugdev fuse lpadmin netdev sambashare jay\n\nfor Ubuntu 12.04+ it would be:\nuseradd -G root adm dialout fax cdrom floppy tape sudo audio dip video plugdev fuse lpadmin netdev sambashare jay\n\nJust change \"jay\" to your actual username. This will make you a member of all the administrative groups again. Reboot and enjoy your new administrativorness. :-)\n", "Q: How to install old version of ffmpeg?

You can try compiling ffmpeg (from the FFmpeg project, not libav). ffmpeg often works when avconv fails, in my experience. This will create a \"local\" build of ffmpeg, so it won't interfere with your ffmpeg/avconv from the repository:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential yasm\ncd\nwget -O ffmpeg.tar.gz \"http://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=snapshot;h=HEAD;sf=tgz\"\ntar xzvf ffmpeg.tar.gz\ncd ffmpeg-HEAD-*\n./configure\nmake\n\nNow try ffmpeg. Note the ./ before ffmpeg, and this example assumes the input file is in your home directory. The output will be placed in your home directory:\ncd ~/ffmpeg-HEAD-*\n./ffmpeg -i ~/input.mp3 ~/output.wav\n\nIf this works you may consider actually replacing libav and installing ffmpeg: How To Compile FFmpeg and x264 on Ubuntu.\n\nA: Browse through the package archive on http://www.packages.ubuntu.com/.\nI found the version you asked for in the Oneiric repisoties.\nJust download and install the .deb package and, if needed, its dependencies.\n\nA: I had this same question because I wanted to downgrade from ffmpeg 4.2.2 to 3.4.6. Here is how I did it:\nBecause of this answer, I learned about apt policy ffmpeg, so I ran it and saw:\nvagrant@vboxHomestead:~/Code/$ apt policy ffmpeg\nffmpeg:\n  Installed: 7:4.2.2-0york0~18.04\n  Candidate: 7:4.2.2-0york0~18.04\n  Version table:\n *** 7:4.2.2-0york0~18.04 500\n        500 http://ppa.launchpad.net/jonathonf/ffmpeg-4/ubuntu bionic/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     7:3.4.6-0ubuntu0.18.04.1 500\n        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic-updates/universe amd64 Packages\n        500 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic-security/universe amd64 Packages\n     7:3.4.2-2 500\n        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic/universe amd64 Packages\n\nI knew I wanted to downgrade to 7:3.4.6-0ubuntu0.18.04.1.\nhttps://www.linuxuprising.com/2019/02/how-to-downgrade-packages-to-specific.html was very helpful.\nSo I ran sudo apt install ffmpeg=7:3.4.6-0ubuntu0.18.04.1.\n", "Q: Plex won't enter my home directory or other partitions I just installed the Plex media server from the Ubuntu Software Center, and opened the web interface. I wanted to start by adding a collection. When it gave me a file browser, I wanted to go to /home/robin/Videos. /home is as far as I got. It showed robin, with an arrow in front of it, but when I tried to expand the directory tree it was empty. The same happened when trying to access /media/Data.\nFor me it's quite useless like this, as all of my media files are inside those 2 directories.\nHelp would be much appreciated.\nMy first guess seemed to be a correct one; It is, as always, a permissions problem.\nHow do I give plex access to my home folder without also giving other users access to it? My home folder is encrypted by the way, so that'll probably complicate things a little.\nrobin@RobinJ:~$ sudo -u plex bash\n[sudo] password for robin: \nbash: /home/robin/.bashrc: Permission denied\nplex@RobinJ:~$ ls -al\nls: cannot open directory .: Permission denied\nplex@RobinJ:~$ cd /home\nplex@RobinJ:/home$ cd robin\nbash: cd: robin: Permission denied\nplex@RobinJ:/home$ ls -al robin\nls: cannot open directory robin: Permission denied\n\n\nA: You've got two options I think.  You can run plex media server as your user, or you can add yourself and plex to a group and give that group access to your home folder.  I run Plex Media Server on OS X for the time being, so I haven't run into this problem myself, but the fix should be fairly trivial.  This link explains how to add users to groups in linux, that's the way I think I'll be going when I switch  my Plex server to Ubuntu.\n\nA: Plex is run under plex username, so you may encounter the following permission issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu restricts access to /media/$USER through ACL (that's the \"+\" when you ls -l /media). Solution below.\n\n*Your drives may not be mounted to allow plex user to read it. Check it with ls -l on the drive or folder that cause issue, to see the group owner, group permissions and user permissions. Solution below.\n\n*Your folder may not allow plex user or group to read it. Use sudo chmod -R u+r FOLDER to allow all users. Or add flex user to the folder group (see below) and use sudo chmod -R g+r FOLDER.\n\n\n\nFix permissions to allow Plex to access /media/$USER\nCheck which group you and plex belong to:\ngroups\ngroups plex\n\nNow, add plex user to your user group, and allow this group to access /media/$USER:\nMYGROUP=\"$USER\"\nsudo usermod -a -G $MYGROUP plex\nsudo chown $USER:$MYGROUP /media/$USER\nsudo chmod 750 /media/$USER\nsudo setfacl -m g:$MYGROUP:rwx /media/$USER\nsudo service plexmediaserver restart\n\n\nFix permissions of NTFS partitions\nNTFS partitions must be mounted with appropriate read rights in /etc/fstab:\nCheck your user and group id (1000 and 1000 in example):\nid\n\nEdit /etc/fstab to mount the drive with read permissions for your user group and for all users (cf. umask, which is 777 less the desired \"chmod\" number):\nUUID=\"XXXXXX\" /media/USERNAME/MOUNTPOINT ntfs rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,default_permissions,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=002 0 0\n\n\nFix permissions of mdadm RAID disks\nIf you're using mdadm, this may be needed in /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf:\nCREATE mode=0775\n\n\nA: Add plex as a user in your group , then add root as a user in your group . \nthen type sudo gpasswd -a root yourusernamehere,sudo gpasswd -a plex yourusernamehere you will have to give sudo password which is your password and then run this command using your drive path , mine is /media/PLEX for my external drive input your path here where u see /media/PLEX\nfind /media/PLEX -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \\;; find /media/PLEX -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\;\nThis will ultimately allow plex to use your files & folders. Hope this helps.\n\nA: Try adding Plex to the plugdev group.\nOpen a terminal (Press ControlAltT) and enter \nsudo gpasswd -a plex plugdev\nVerify that plex was added to the plugdev group by entering:\ngroups plex\nwhich should display what groups plex belongs too. Next, reboot the computer and start plex to verify this corrected the problem.\nIf just adding plex to plugdev works for you, then you are much better off than adding plex to your usergroup as suggested in other answers. That may work but it's not a great idea security wise. \n\nA: *\n\n*Install Plex.  \n\n*Open terminal.\n\n*Install samba - sudo apt-get install samba.\n\n*From ~ do cd ...

JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler.\nhttps://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler/releases\n\nA: You can decompile, edit, and recompile SWF using swfmill. This tool turns a SWF into XML and back again, e.g.:\nswfmill swf2xml movie.swf movie.xml\nswfmill xml2swf movie.xml movie.swf\nHowever, whether this will be useful to you depends on how the SWF is put together. You can edit images, videos, audio etc within the movie using this method. They are present in the XML file as base64 encoded blocks which you can replace.\nEditing text is much harder because text in SWF files is usually converted to curves so that the fonts do not need to be embedded.\n", "Q: Save my emails in files So as said in the title, i want to find a way download my emails on my pc and save them in a file.

But first, it seems like it doesn't get all my emails. And then, I didn't find a way to save the emails i get in a file.\nSo if anyone knows any way of doing it, please make me know.\n\nA: When accessing the emails in Gmail it takes some time to download and sometimes Google will kick you out and you need to reconnect. If you make to many requests it may even quick you out for a full day. \nYou can use Thunderbird to download the messages. It archives the emails in mbox format. Here's the part you are going to love: \n\nAll messages in an mbox mailbox are concatenated and stored as plain text in a single file. The beginning of each message is indicated by a line whose first five characters consist of \"From\" followed by a space (the so named \"From_ line\" or \"'From ' line\" or simply \"From line\") and the return path e-mail address. A blank line is appended to the end of each message\n\nThunderbird does use a slightly modified version (more info here.)\nHope it helps :) \n", "Q: No firmware found for Broadcom wireless card (BCM4318) on Dell Latitude D610 Trying to get my 03:03.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4318 [AirForce One 54g] 802.11g Wireless LAN Controller (rev 02) working.

On startup, or after restarting the router, I am able to load a couple of websites, but after that the internet stops working (though the wirless/ethernet continue to indicate that they are connected). Strangely, I am still able to do things with the websites I have already loaded - for example, loading/sending messages in gmail. It's just loading certain new websites that is the issue.

I hope it works for you too.\n\nA: Your problem apears to be with the network stack and not with the drivers.\nMost problems I had were with name resolution try pinging a known site to check if name resolves ok.\n\nA: Hooray I fixed it.\nSetting it IPV6 to Local-Link Only did the trick.\nIt is odd though that everything was going fine until about 2 days ago.\n", "Q: Linux and windows kernel I work on Linux and a friend on a Windows 7.\nI was amazed about the speed that NetBeans, Eclipse, pgAdmin and other programs open a lot, really, a LOT faster on Linux than on windows.\nWhat is the main difference between Linux and windows kernel that causes that time load difference?\nBoth machines have exactly the same hardware configuration.\n\nA: This is just my guess, but I think that when you work for a company, where once everything is compiled (converted to binary data, which computers can execute), nobody can see the source code anymore, you tend to be a lot lazier, as it doesn't matter as long as it works.\nLinux is open source, so everyone can see the source code if they would wish to do so. If you are lazy, and write a really crappy piece of code which will really slow down the system or something of the sorts, there goes your reputation, as everyone just saw. Developers and users alike. I think that's one of the reasons why open souyce developers tend to be less lazy.\nIt's also a fact that the core of the Windows kernel was never written with the intention of becoming what it is today (neither was Linux', but they did the effort to optimize the old bits), and developers have simply always been adding and adding on top of it, until the code was so cryptic that nobody could make something out of it anymore. Two properties of messy code is that there's often a lot of  redundancy, and that you don't see the links between two pieces of code so easily anymore, which makes that you can't even try to start optimizing it. Just an example (not a cryptic one);\nfor (int i = 0; i < 20; i++)\n{\n    if (x == y)\n    {\n        if (z <= u)\n        {\n            goto banana;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe example above could be done much more efficiently;\nfor (int i = 0; (i < 20) && (x == y) && (z <= u); i++)\n{\n    banana ();\n}\n\n\nA: Another big one not mentioned yet is that Linux has better filesystems. NTFS's performance with small files isn't that great -- ext3 is better, and ext4 is much, much better. There's some interesting speculation on why in another question.\nWhen you're opening a program, a significant amount of the startup time is loading a bunch of tiny files from the disk, so having a filesystem that does that quickly is very important.\n\nA: This is just my opinion but i think there are various reasons for GNU/Linux systems being faster than Windows and not all are related to kernel:\n\n\n*\n\n*Obviously there is the reason explained by RobinJ, it's quite obvious that if software is open source the code tends to be more efficiently-written\n\n*Linux makes use of very optimized components for example it uses a very optimized scheduler that tends to maximize CPU utilization.\n\n*Linux systems suffer less from memory fragmentation\n\n*Linux systems have a better use of the main memory and usually tend to massively use cache, Windows systems instead tend to massively use virtual memory\n\n*Linux kernel is continuosly updated and useless parts are usually removed, although Linus Torvalds said that Linux kernel is becoming \"huge and bloated\", in opposition updates to the NT kernel are usually built on top of the existing ones.\n\n\nA: I believe the kernel alone isn't the answer. Windows 7 is the first time Windows was responsive enough that I consider it to be acceptable. \nI believe more of the speed differential is related to @RobinJ's thoughts on software engineering. Everything* in Windows is built on the MSDN via some kind of Microsoft framework or another. This is actually related to how Big Business loves Microsoft; Microsoft is all about helping different programs/suites/technologies talk to each other. \nNext... to make it easier for the developers to have the essentials covered (and not reinvent the wheel) Microsoft allows makers to bundle and/or require precompiled libraries like Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable. Or .Net4.0, MSSQL 2005, ad nauseum. There are something like ten years worth of packages developers can use and build upon and require end users to install on their Windows computers in order to use the new software.\nSo in order for program Zyzzyx to load and run, one or more MSDN redistributable libraries have to be present and running. These libraries determine how programs interact with the OS.\nTo boil it down, I would opine that Window's intentional compatibility across decades of software makes it bloated and occasionally more slow than a comparable linux system. Also note that I have developed visual software for windows but not any for linux... not GTK, Qt, Py, anything, so my assumptions about linux being less bloated are just that.\nedited to add: further, FOSS software does have people improving it all the time, so GTK will improve as time passes rather than GTK-2005 and GTK-2008 being on same computer, while Microsoft does that all the time.\n*- ok there are exceptions, I'm sure.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu on an (U)EFI device with existing GPT? I had Ubuntu 11.04 running till now. Now I want to reinstall Ubuntu with nearly fresh 12.04. I had much trouble last time to install Ubuntu because of EFI. Yet somehow I somehow got it running. But I can't remember how.\nNow I have a gpt partition with my personal data on sda4, an EFI partition on sda1 and between a swap and a root partition. I want to install Ubuntu on the root partition without clearing the hole SSD. \nEverytime I try to install ubuntu my \"BIOS\" can't find it. When I press the right key at the right time I get an overview over the possible booting options. There is a \"grub\" entry but when I enter it I get to the overview again after a redraw of the display.\nI tried all possibilities for the bootloader section (yes I installed Ubuntu 5 times today) and have no clue how to get my system running again. I also tried repairing grub via chroot. What should I do?\nedit: Yes the installation completes without error.  But as far as I can tell grub isn't even loaded. I would say my computer knows it should start grub, but can't excess the ssd. Or it doesn't find what it is looking for. And this behaviour didn't change by installing elilo(though I can't tell if I did it right). Grub is usually going to some shell when started with errors, but here simply nothing happens. \n\nA: If I understand correctly, your problem is that your boot loader is broken after Ubuntu installation has completed; when you launch GRUB from your firmware, it dumps you back to the firmware's boot manager. If that's incorrect (if you're having problems getting the installer to start, for instance), please clarify.\nMy recommendation is that you install another boot loader. In my experience, GRUB 2 is the least reliable of the available Linux boot loaders, and when it malfunctions, it's usually easier to replace it than to try to fix it. If this is a Linux-only system, I recommend you try ELILO. If you're dual-booting with Windows, either use ELILO in conjunction with rEFInd or try Fedora's patched GRUB Legacy. You can install any of these from the Ubuntu installer in its \"try before installing\" mode, but you may need to do a sudo apt-get install efibootmgr followed by use of that tool to add the new boot program to the firmware's list of boot programs. See my Web page on EFI boot loaders for more information, including details of how to use efibootmgr.\nThe drawback to doing this is that you'll need to manage your boot loader manually; the scripts for updating the boot loader when you update your kernel will no longer work. Thus, you'll have to be sure to upgrade your boot loader configuration whenever you upgrade your kernel.\n\nA: Grub works great installed to a disk with GPT partition tables, however in order to install to a GPT partitioned disk that disk must have a small (1mb is plenty) partition especially for grub. (on msdos partitioned drives there is a space that grub uses, but that is not present on GPT partitions). Recent versions of gparted is able to make these small partitions. Unfortunately, if your drive was partitioned without this partition you are quite out of luck, as moving a partition even a single megabyte is a large ordeal. \nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/html_node/BIOS-installation.html\nGrub 2 support booting from GPT even from a BIOS, as not not require UEFI native mode. All non-apple x86 computers I know of support booting in BIOS mode, and this is recommended over UEFI booting.\n\nA: As I wrote in the comments the answer for me was to delete the existing EFI partition and the following swap partition and make them new as efi (not as fat16) and swap. And I configured the bootloader to install on the efi partition.\nsudo parted -l gives (german):\nModell: ATA C300-MTFDBAK128M (scsi)\nFestplatte  /dev/sda:  128GB\nSektorgröße (logisch/physisch): 512B/512B\nPartitionstabelle: gpt\n\nNummer  Anfang  Ende    Größe   Dateisystem     Name  Flags\n 1      17,4kB  200MB   200MB   fat32                 boot\n 3      200MB   3888MB  3688MB  linux-swap(v1)\n 2      3888MB  27,9GB  24,0GB  ext4\n 4      27,9GB  128GB   100GB   ext4\n\n", "Q: Wireless Xbox 360 controller on Humble Bundle V I got the Humble Indie Bundle Complete (including Bastion, Lone Survivor, Braid and Super Meat Boy... the whole bundle is excellent). \nThe fact is that Braid, Super Meat Boy, nor any game in the bundle, has XBox 360 wireless support (it's logical, but disappointing at the same time), nor any kind of gamepad support. \nI wanted to know if there is a solution for this conflict, having in mind that I am acctualy a newcomer (I know how to use a terminal and apt-get, though) and everything I've read by now didn't gave me a concrete solution to my predicament. \nI tried using xboxdrv in SUDO mode, and get the controller to be recognised and working correctly, but I cannot bind the controllers POV, analog sticks or buttons. I also tried using joy2key, but it's frustrating for me to configure. \nI wanted, also, to know if there exist any kind of GUI or at least a guide to use joy2key and saving the templates and configurations for it.\n\nA: xboxdrv allows you to do full keyboard and mouse emulation, so it can do everything you need.

What you need to do for your timeout is use GLib's timeout function to set up a delay, and change the label in that callback.  The code would probably look something like:\ndef set_label(self):\n    self.ind.set_label(\"SSH\")\n    GLib.timeout_add(4, self.respond_to_timeout)\n\ndef respond_to_timeout(self):\n    self.ind.set_label(\"HSS\")\n\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How do I convert only a portion of an MP3 file to WAV at a certain frequency, from the command-line?

Look at existing files to see how the format looks like.\nOnce the connection is created, you can use the nmcli command to manage NetworkManager from the command line, doing things such as enabling, disabling and querying connections.\nIncidentally, the System Testing tool (checkbox) has a script that does exactly this: creates a connection and enables it, with parameters that you supply on the command line. \nFor instance, this creates a connection to the open \"duck\" network:\nsudo /usr/share/checkbox/scripts/create_connection duck\n\nThis will create a connection to a network using WPA2 security, with \"wings\" password:\nsudo /usr/share/checkbox/scripts/create_connection -S wpa -K wings duck\n\nThe script is written in Python so it should be easy for you to look at and adapt to your needs.\nThe script's help says this:\nUsage: create_connection [options] SSID\n\nOptions:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -S SECURITY, --security=SECURITY\n                        The type of security to be used by the connection.\n                        One of wpa and wep.

What should I look / grep for in the logs? This is not the first time that Ubuntu has froze. Last time, I checked 'recently updated files' in /var/log/ and /var/crash/ and the cause of the problem appeared to be 'LibreOffice'.\nNow, it has happened again.\nNothing works, except the power-down button (based on previous experience).

The computer passed a memtest.\nWhat should I look (grep) for in the logs?\nUpdate: I have submitted a bug here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg/+bug/1023916/ \n\nA: A freeze sounds a lot like an error either in Xorg or in the kernel. Have you tried to ssh to the box? Sometimes that works even if local user interfaces are all irresponsive. A working ssh connection might be very helpful debugging this kind of issue.\nFrom the data you provided, I'd go for the kernel log. It seems libreoffice crashed for some reason, and within a second, chrome was gone as well. So there was definitely some kind of problem at that time. Have a closer look at the log around those error lines, and see whether you can identify the first error message of that event cascade. The timestamps to the left should be useful, as any event related to the freeze should be pretty close to the two I mentioned.\nJust judging from the two events included in your log, it seems likely that the libreoffice crash somehow made X unstable, causing both the UI freeze and the chrome crash. You will notice that chrome crashed in an X library.\n\nA: \nI was running in the 'vanilla' default mode, although I do have xfce\n  and kde installed.\n\nA vanilla installation, to my understanding means a clean installation of a distribution. Try a clean install (as in format everything, create a new user and try again). Of course, backup your important files before doing this.\nAlso, instead of reinstalling, you could try creating a new user. This can pin-point the problem: If the new user works, the problem is located in your home user settings. If it doesn't, it's a system problem (and reinstalling would solve it probably)\nDo not install anything else. Do not use PPAs. Only update the software through update manager or apt-get, without altering/adding the sources.list. That means vanilla installation. See how the system responds for 3-4 days. Then start adding software one-by-one in order to discover the problematic package.\nAfter a reboot, the system usually appends a \".old\" or \".0\" in the filename.\nI'd say these log files would be informative:\ntar czf mylogs.tar.gz --ignore-failed-read ~/.xsession-errors.old /var/log/Xorg.0.log.old /var/log/dmesg.0 /var/log/syslog.1 /var/log/kern.log.1 /var/log/apport.log.1 /var/log/pm-powersave.log.1\nfile-roller mylogs.tar.gz\n\n...or if you prefer it separately:\ncat ~/.xsession-errors.old\ncat /var/log/Xorg.0.log.old\ncat /var/log/dmesg.0\ncat /var/log/syslog.1\ncat /var/log/kern.log.1\ncat /var/log/apport.log.1\ncat /var/log/pm-powersave.log.1\n\n\nA: Various applications segfault and kernel oops usually are symptoms of hardware problems.

I'd like to install some themes made for Gnome-Shell, like to know if they will work on Unity as well?\n\nA: Most of the elements will work, I would recommend downloading \"My Unity\" to allow you to easily change the parts of the themes that you want to change. It will also allow you to customise other Unity setting easily, additionally it will come with some themes already installed.\n\nSome of the indicator apps will have unusual icon when you change the theme(classic-menu is one I know about) but as I said above most will work. \n\nA: The Gnome Shell themes themselves will not work , but the GTK themes that come with them for your window themes will, 9 times out of 10 work inside Unity.\nLike posted earlier using \"my unity\" will show you themes and icons installed that can be used in Unity.\n", "Q: Computer completely shuts down I've been having a problem with my Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit machine which is happening quite often and randomly.\nDuring a normal session and without any indication that something is wrong the computer just shuts down completely as if I unplugged it from the wall..\nI read somewhere that this is probably caused due to overheating so I installed the \"sensors\" program to monitor the CPU temperature which running it after the crash indicates that all Core temperatures are at normal levels.\nDoes anyone have an idea as to what might be causing the problem and most importantly if there are any log files I could examine to troubleshoot this.\n\nA: If it does a clean shutdown, and it is a temperature problem as you guessed, that is usually indicated in /var/log/syslog as mentioned by irrational john above. I had this with a laptop and a failing CPU fan. So if e.g. it says there it's shutting down because the CPU is overheating, check also whether your CPU fan is working. Same for the other fans if anything is overheating.\nOn the other hand: if it simply powers-off without a clean shutdown, it rather points to a hardware failure. I had this when one core of my CPU gave up on another machine. In those cases, there won't be a related entry in the syslog (as there was no clean shutdown, but just a power-off). Here you could run some hardware checks:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot to memtest to run a complete RAM check\n\n*use S.M.A.R.T. capabilities of your harddrive for a health check (e.g. with the smartmontools package)\n\n\nJust to give a few examples.\n\nA: This is what I would do in your situation\nThe Problem:\n\"It randomly shuts off while im doing something...\"\n*as if i just unplugged it.\nFirst(if possible) get to XTerm, mess with preferences and create an infinite scrollable history.

But you have to eliminate possibilities.\n\nA: When you say \"normal temperature\" what temperature is it? Different processors have different temperatures at which they shutdown.\nSometimes old computers have \"earthing problems\". Some of their circuits get accidentally grounded.

Now that there is no password set for it, I cannot put a new one nor do any actions which needs administrator privileges.\nI tried different fixes found on askubuntu, including resetting of password using recovery mode. However my problem is that when I'm on the part where the console asks for password, I cannot type anything, thus I can only send a blank respond.\nThen it's unchanged. I also experience this kind of problem that I'm unable to enter password on consoles like when I tried on the free Debian server I got (just putting it up an example just in case you can help me to this problem).\nThank you very much! And I'll appreciate immediate help. More power to Ubuntu.\n\nA: Here's a shorter one if you can still log in:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Type \"passwd.\"\n\n*You will be asked to type your new password right away since you\ncurrently have none. Type away!\n\n\nDone!\nI had this problem too just yesterday. I changed the admin password at the login options to none so I wouldn't have to type anything at login. That was terrible placement because the password at the log-in options is \"the password.\" You can't have an administrator without a password but it's a bug that it allows you. Fortunately, I had auto login turned on.\n\nA: There is no administrator account, per se.  There is an admin group, but that has no password; the password is the person who may be a member of that group, along with many other groups.  Groups never have passwords\nThere is an account for root, which is equivalent to an administrator on some systems like windows.  But on Ubuntu, this defaults to effectively not being set, and is unknown to you unless you change it.  I think it may be set to a GUID, which is a very long number, but it doesn't really matter.\nSo, I'm guessing what you did was to remove yourself from the admin group; permissions on linux are by user or by group, and SUDO allows use either by user or by group, admin group being one parameter.\nThis happens a lot, it seems, and can be seen in this topic, or this one.  \nThis problem illustrates one of the reasons that normal users are not allowed to do things like you did.  Originally, you would need to be more knowledgeable to do these things that can mess up the system and lock people out.\n\nA: I think you are saying that you disabled the password on your main account?  If so this is a very similar question with answers that will help.\nHow to find an ubuntu password which i removed?\n\nA: i had the same problem, my password was set to \"none\" but it still asked me for authentification each time i tried installing anything. and of all the methods i tried to reboot my password, the one that worked is here: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/resetpassword\nThanks ! \n", "Q: How to put a (Start) Menu button on Fluxbox Toolbar I often run programs maximized (leaving no desktop area).

I have also found the #debian-mentors channel on the official Debian IRC to be a great situation-specific resource for beginning packagers/devs.\n\nTo create a deb for personal use, the easy solution for most cases is to simply use checkinstall, which will create a .deb file that you can not only install on other (compatible) systems with the appropriate dependencies installed, but also allows you to uninstall the package. Note that GCC is a large and complex package, so checkinstall may not work with it!\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install checkinstall -y\n\n*When done with make, run checkinstall instead of make install\n\n*checkinstall will install your application AND give you a .deb file in the current (source) folder which you can simply copy and install on other systems with dpkg -i\n\n*Use dpkg -r application-name to remove the application at any time (should also work from Synaptic)\n\n*\n\n*Please see this community help page and the author's home page if you need more information.\n\n\n\nA: There is a Guide:\nhttp://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/packaging-new-software.html\n", "Q: 12.04 screen resolution keeps changing after reboot running ubuntu 12.04 64-bit desktop on intel pentium 2 pc with 2gb of ram, ati hd3870 radeon, sony wega 50inch lcd tv.

I have a headless Ubuntu 12.04 server in a datacenter 1500 miles away. Twice now on reboot the system decided it had to fsck. Unfortunately Ubuntu ran fsck in interactive mode, so I had to ask someone at my datacenter to go over, plug in a console, and press the Y key. How do I set it up so that fsck runs in non-interactive mode at boot time with the -y or -p (aka -a) flag?\nIf I understand Ubuntu's boot process correctly, init invokes mountall which in turn invokes fsck. However I don't see any way to configure how fsck is invoked. Is this possible?\n(To head off one suggestion; I'm aware I can use tune2fs -i 0 -c 0 to prevent periodic fscks. That may help a little but I need the system to try to come back up even if it had a real reason to fsck, say after a power failure.)\nIn response to followup questions, here's the pertinent details of my /etc/fstab.

This means \"automatically repair filesystems with inconsistencies during boot\" and causes fsck to run with the -y flag. It was set to no in both of my Ubuntu systems.\nEven when set to no, the boot time fsck is still somewhat noninteractive. mountall runs fsck with -a, a synonym for -p, which means \"automatically fix any filesystem problems that can be safely fixed without human intervention\". Apparently -p drops to interactive mode if there are unsafe fixes to be made. To run fully automatically, you need -y or FSCKFIX=yes.\nHere's the relevant bit of code from mountall.c\nif (fsck_fix || mnt->fsck_fix) {\n  NIH_MUST (nih_str_array_add (&args, NULL, &args_len, \"-y\"));\n} else {\n  NIH_MUST (nih_str_array_add (&args, NULL, &args_len, \"-a\"));\n}\n\n\nA: For Ubuntu 15,16,17+ the FSCKFIX value setting is located in lib/init/vars.sh\nCan use command grep -r FSCKFIX * 2>/dev/null to fin it.\n\nA: Make sure you don't have any flags that might cause this in fstab, and check your init scripts.

(You need to consider whether it is safe to cancel a process, usually it's fine. like a browser firefox)\n\nA: Try to switch to a different workspace with Ctrl + Alt + (←/↑/↓/→). Unless your system is completely frozen it should be able to switch workspaces.\nIn the new workspace look for System Monitor in the dash, it is like Windows Taskmanager.\nyou should then be able to \"kill\" the process by right clicking on it.\nIf this doesn't work you can restart your desktop without having to do a hard shut-down by logging into one of your virtual desktops Ctrl + Alt + (F1 to F6) then enter the following commands\nsudo stop lightdm\n\nyou will get a notification: lightdm stop/wait   then enter the following\nsudo start lightdm\n\nthis will restart your Xserver and send you back to the login screen on your desktop or straight to your desktop if you log in automatically.\nNote; this is still a semi-nuclear  option, it will kill any programs that are running and you will lose any unsaved work but it is safer for your computer than holding the power button.\nThere is also a text based task manager called \"top\" that you can access from a terminal or your virtual desktops but it's directions are rather long, you can get information on how it works by entering this into a terminal\nman top\n\nand the command to launch the actual \"text task manager\" is:\ntop\n\n\nA: There's a safe way to reboot a frozen Ubuntu:\n\n\n*Hold down Alt+Sys Rq(PrtScn key)key combination. There will be no visible output,while hold down the key combination,\n\n*press these keys in the order,one by one\nR\nE\nI\nS\nU\nB\nSpells “busier” backwards,and the system will be reboot after B is typed in the safe way.\nlinks here\n", "Q: problem installing ubuntu 12.04 after downloading i have downloaded ubuntu 12.04 and the flle is in my hard drive as ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso.dap    but while installing ubuntu it opens with KM player and get hanged.i have checked the proper ties of the file and got - type of file:dap file and open with KM player.Please help me out.....\n\nA: dap is a partial download.

I am using Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit. My kernels are PAE kernels. I know these are the kernels we can use for 32-bit OS which have 4 GB RAM, to utilize all 4GB of RAM.\nMy system is a 32-bit system. So I thought I don't need them. What are the advantages and disadvantages I am going have if I keep running PAE kernels?\nraja@badfox:~$ uname -a\nLinux badfox 3.2.0-24-generic-pae #39-Ubuntu SMP Mon May 21 18:54:21 UTC 2012 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux\n\n\nA: Short answer: Go 64-bit if you can, which is faster than both PAE/non-PAE 32-bit; if you cannot, non-PAE may be 1-2% faster than PAE.\n\nIn theory PAE has a slight overhead over non-PAE...\n\n*\n\n*The big advantage of PAE is allowing a 32-bit processor/system to use more than 4GB of RAM\n\n*But this requires slightly more overhead over non-PAE, which can lead to slightly decreased performance.\n\n*\n\n*Here's a very simple explanation: in non-PAE mode, a 32-bit CPU must lookup (access) two tables to access a physical memory address; in PAE-mode, it must lookup three tables to do so. The one additional lookup requires some (very small) extra time, thus imposing additional overhead.\n\n*At the end of this answer are two images from the Wikipedia PAE article, illustrating the above point.\n\n*NX/XD bit: The PAE kernel also supports the No-eXecute/eXecute-Disable bit on 64-bit processors; this can help prevent some kinds of virus/malicious attacks (buffer overflows), but IMO this doesn't matter much when choosing 32-bit kernels for Ubuntu.\n\n\n\n...but in practice this overhead is negligible (almost nothing)...\n\n*\n\n*Phoronix has done a number of tests over the years which show that on systems with 4GB or less, the PAE kernel may be at most approximately 5% slower than the non-PAE kernel. This is only for a specific test application; the usual difference is less than 1%.\n\n*\n\n*Tests for 12.04 LTS - 8 GB system!\n\n*Tests for 11.04 - 4 and 8GB systems\nand 64-bit almost always beats BOTH 32-bit kernels - go for it!\n\n*\n\n*The one thing those Phoronix benchmarks above tell you is that 64-bit is king -- even if you have less than 4GB of RAM (although I'd recommend 1GB as the minimum)\n\n*If you have a 64-bit processor -- generally anything after 2006 except Intel Atoms -- you are probably losing performance by using a 32-bit kernel!\n\n\nComparing non-PAE vs. PAE page table accesses:\n\n*\n\n*Non-PAE\n\n\n\n*PAE\n\n\nA: For some real-world data, here are some benchmarks I gathered for i386, i386-pae and amd64 installs on an Atom based netbook and Sandybridge based laptop:\nhttp://kernel.ubuntu.com/~cking/power-benchmarking/blueprint-foundations-p-64bit-by-default/hpmini-and-x220-tests/results-3/results.txt\n..may give some insight into pros and cons.\n\nA: I had serious troubles using 32-bit 12.04 with certain software  (zfs filesystem), unveiling the vmalloc limitations of 32-bit systems ( I have tried both pae and non-pae and vmalloc and depmod params tuning, to death... but no success). \nThat is probbably a special case, but could be given as an example. Limitation somewhere deep inside 32-bit kernels is 1GB, even if upto some 3.2 GB is usable. \nGo for 64-bit if You can. \nI am pretty sure that Tou vcan... I guess that to date, it (=64bit cpu core) should be supported by almost any running system. Later \"upgrade\" is somehow uneasy (it means reinstall in fact, even if dpkg and copying /etc/ and /home/ may help bringing new installation running..) but still should be acceptable.\nI think that there are no problems to be afraid of with 64-bit, not even if You are forced to use old/closed source 32bit application or some libraries for some reason.\n", "Q: Problems about responsiveness and keyboard/mousepad not working So I installed Ubuntu 12.04, I'm very new at this and want to get into the world of Linux but have run into nothing but problems.

The solution suggested in that thread is to update the BIOS of the Acer Aspire 5553G to v1.17. \nThis supposedly fixes the keyboard problem. Could this possibly apply to your situation?\nThe most recent BIOS available from Acer for the Aspire 5553G now appears to be v1.23 and is dated May 23, 2011. If it was me I would (1) verify that BIOS could be used on my computer and, if it could, (2) download it and (carefully!) update my BIOS. \n"]
